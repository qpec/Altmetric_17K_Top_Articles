SUMMARY
The archaeological evidence for parasites in the Roman era is presented in order to demonstrate the species present at that
time, and highlight the health consequences for people living under Roman rule. Despite their large multi-seat public
latrines with washing facilities, sewer systems, sanitation legislation, fountains and piped drinking water from aqueducts,
we see the widespread presence of whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) and Entamoeba his-
tolytica that causes dysentery. This would suggest that the public sanitation measures were insufficient to protect the popu-
lation from parasites spread by fecal contamination. Ectoparasites such as fleas, head lice, body lice, pubic lice and bed bugs
were also present, and delousing combs have been found. The evidence fails to demonstrate that the Roman culture of
regular bathing in the public baths reduced the prevalence of these parasites. Fish tapeworm was noted to be widely
present, and was more common than in Bronze and Iron Age Europe. It is possible that the Roman enthusiasm for fer-
mented, uncooked fish sauce (garum) may have facilitated the spread of this helminth. Roman medical practitioners
such as Galen were aware of intestinal worms, explaining their existence and planning treatment using the humoural
theory of the period.

INTRODUCTION
The Romans

and spreads its ideas and philosophy, we might see
changes in the state of human health as a consequence.
The Romans conquered a huge empire and altered
the lives of its subjects for centuries. Using changes
in the ancient parasites present in the regions under
Roman control, this study investigates whether
Romanization can be seen to have altered the balance
of disease experienced by the people who lived in
Europe and the Mediterranean region 2000 years ago.
The city of Rome was traditionally founded in 753
BC, and in 509 BC, the Roman Republic was
founded (Lintott, 2000). In 31 BC, Augustus
became the first Roman Emperor following a series
of civil wars (Kershaw, 2013). Imperial Rome
reached its greatest extent in the 3rd century AD,
when the empire covered all the lands from coastal
North Africa, the Near East, southern and western
Europe and much of Britain (Fig. 1). While the
Western Roman Empire fell in 476 AD with the con-
quest of Rome, the Eastern Empire with its capital of
Constantinople lasted until 1453 AD as the Byzantine
Empire (Brownworth, 2009; Stathakopoulos, 2014).
The Roman Empire was a place of great mobil-
ity, both voluntary and forced. Soldiers, govern-
ment officials, merchants and slaves moved all
over the empire, and Rome itself was a major
draw
for
the
ambitious
(Handley,
2011).
We
might
potentially
find
evidence
for
spread
of
people with infections if we were to find parasites,
endemic in one part of the empire, in a region
where their life cycle would make an endemic
focus of disease impossible. While the process of
‘Romanization’
is
debated,
the
Romans
were
well-known for bringing their ideas about litera-
ture, engineering, culture, cuisine, religion and
hygiene wherever they ruled (Pitts and Versluys,
2015). It is clear from modern research and theor-
etical modelling that good sanitation should have
improved the health of past populations compared
with
those
who
have
no
sanitation
(Mitchell,
2015a). The spread of Roman knowledge such as
clean
fresh
water
in
aqueducts,
under
floor
heating
for
houses,
elaborate
bathhouses
for
washing, flushing toilets, civic drains and sewers
could in theory have improved the health of the
inhabitants (Hobson, 2009; Yegül, 2010; Jansen
et al. 2011; Koloski-Ostrow, 2015). In this paper,
we will look at the evidence for parasites in
Roman times, and by comparing with the situation
before and after the Romans we will assess if these

 forms of sanitation seem to have led to a health
benefit to those living under Roman rule.
How to study ancient parasites (palaeoparasitology)
The eggs of most intestinal helminths can be pre-
served for thousands of years in the right conditions,
due to their tough chitinous walls. Human feces in
archaeological
contexts
can
be
recovered
from
latrine soil, coprolites (preserved pieces of human
feces) and the pelvic soil from burials, where the in-
testinal contents would have decomposed after death
(Reinhard et al. 1986; Warnock and Reinhard, 1992;
Araújo et al. 2015; Rácz et al. 2015). While parasite
eggs may also be found in ancient rubbish tips, pits
or wells, it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate
whether these eggs originated from humans rather
than animals. For example, whipworm (Trichuris
trichiura) in humans is indistinguishable on light mi-
croscopy from Trichuris suis in pigs. In such cases,
archaeological context and the presence of other
parasites unique to animals can help us to determine
which origin is more likely (Da Rocha et al. 2006). If
coprolites are being analysed, then fecal bile acids
and sterols can help identify whether they are from
humans, carnivore or herbivore animals (Shillito
et al. 2011; Baeten et al. 2012). The ancient DNA
of parasites can also be studied to differentiate
species that appear similar on microscopy (Leles
et al. 2008; Oh et al. 2010). However, this has yet
to be undertaken on Roman period parasites.
Identifying ancient parasite eggs does require an
understanding of how certain eggs tend to change
over archaeological time, known as taphonomy.
Roundworm eggs may lose the mammillated outer
coat, whipworm may lose the polar plugs and fish
tapeworm may lose the operculum. The eggs of
some
parasite
species
such
as
hookworm
(Ancylostoma duodenale) and pinworm (Enterobius
vermicularis) are particularly fragile and may be
easily deformed or lost completely from archaeo-
logical samples (Reinhard and Pucu de Araújo,
2014).
Research
comparing
microscopy
with
genetic techniques suggests that microscopy can
underestimate past prevalence for some species,
since positive genetic results may occur even when
fragile eggs are no longer visible (Jaeger and
Iñiguez, 2014). Evidence for species with fragile
eggs are most likely to survive in dried coprolites,
but
while
these
are
commonly
found
in
the
Americas they are very rare in Europe. This means
that species with a fragile wall may appear to have
been rare or absent in Roman times, when they
may in fact have been present.
In order to detect parasite eggs from soil sedi-
ments we need to transform solid soil to a liquid sus-
pension, known as disaggregation (Reinhard et al.
1986; Anastasiou and Mitchell, 2013a). Then a
number of techniques are available to concentrate
the eggs, including flotation, sedimentation and
microsieves. This concentrate can be mixed with
glycerol and viewed with light microscopy. In a
coprolite it is possible to count the number of eggs
per gram of soil to estimate the degree of parasitism,
but in latrines the egg concentration may be effected
as much by the amount of rubbish thrown into the
latrine as how concentrated the eggs were in the
feces of the various users of the facilities. In conse-
quence, in this paper we will look at the geographic
distribution of parasite species rather than egg con-
centrations in order to evaluate change in parasite
infection.
The fragile cysts of intestinal amoeba such as
Entamoeba
histolytica,
Giardia
duodenalis
and
Cryptosporidium parvum do not survive well in arch-
aeological soils, and when deformed they are hard to
detect with microscopy. A more effective way to
detect them has been with enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA). This technique employs
antibodies that react to the proteins unique to these
organisms, regardless of whether the cysts are
deformed or broken (Gonçalves et al. 2002, 2004;
Frías et al. 2013). Ectoparasites can be detected by
fine sieving of soil, and also looking for them on
hair
combs,
mummies
or
ancient
textiles
(Mumcuoglu, 2008; Arriaza et al. 2013; Forbes
et al. 2013). Mummies also have the potential to pre-
serve the ancient DNA of endoparasites, the proteins
secreted by these parasites when alive, and possibly
the host antibodies made to fight the infection
(Anastasiou and Mitchell, 2013b).
Some endoparasites have the potential to cause
anaemia in their human hosts, and we can look for
this when we study the skeletal remains of past
populations. Examples of parasite infections that
often trigger anaemia include malaria, hookworm
and schistosomiasis (Garcia, 2009). Anaemia can
manifest itself in the skeleton with pitting in the
roof of the orbits (cribra orbitalia), on the cranial
vault of the skull (porotic hyperostosis) and thicken-
ing of the cranial vault (Polo-Cerdá et al. 2001;

Trajan, around 117 AD.

Human parasites in the Roman World

 Walker et al. 2009). One study investigated the
prevalence of these changes in a site close to
Imperial Rome (1st–3rd century AD) and compared
it with a 7th century AD population nearby
(Salvadei et al. 2001). Cribra orbitalia was present
in 60–80% of children at both sites, highlighting
how common anaemia was in Roman period Italy.
PARASITES PRIOR TO THE ROMAN PERIOD
In
order
to
appreciate
the
consequences
of
Romanization
following
the
expansion
of
the
Roman
Republic
and
the
subsequent
Roman
Empire, we need to determine which parasites
were present in those people living in the region
before the Romans.
In Europe, the inhabitants were hunter-gatherers
until around 4000 BC and then started to develop
farming in the Neolithic period (4000–2800 BC). The
development of metal tools led to the Bronze Age
(2800–500 BC) and then Iron Age (700–100 BC).
The overlap in dates is due to the gradual spread of
these technologies across the continent. In the
Neolithic, the intestinal parasites identified were beef
or pork tapeworm (Taenia asiatica, Taenia saginata
or Taenia solium), bile duct fluke (Opisthorchis sp.),
Capillaria sp., E. histolytica dysentery, Fasciola
genus liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica), fish tapeworm
(Diphyllobothrium
sp.),
giant
kidney
worm
(Dioctophymidae), hookworm (Ancylostomids), lancet
liver fluke (Dicrocoelium sp.), roundworm and whip-
worm (Bouchet et al. 2003; Anastasiou, 2015). It can
be seen that there was a mixture of zoonotic parasites
from eating raw or undercooked wild animals (beef/
pork tapeworm, bile duct fluke, capillariosis, fish tape-
worm, giant kidney worm, lancet liver fluke) and para-
sites transmitted by the fecal contamination in villages
(Entamoeba
dysentery,
hookworm,
roundworm,
whipworm).
In Bronze and Iron Age Europe the parasites
found were E. histolytica that can cause dysentery,
roundworm, whipworm, lancet liver fluke and so
far just two examples of fish tapeworm (Bouchet
et
al.
2003;
Le
Bailly
and
Bouchet,
2013;
Anastasiou, 2015). We do have to consider that
fewer Bronze and Iron Age archaeological sites
have been studied for parasites than is the case for
earlier Neolithic or later Roman and medieval
periods. However, we do nevertheless have parasites
identified from sites in 7 different European coun-
tries in the Bronze and Iron Age (Austria, Britain,
Czech
Republic,
Denmark,
France,
Germany,
Poland), so this evidence should reflect the species
present reasonably well. It does appear that over
time, the number of species affecting people in
Europe seems to have decreased from the Neolithic
to the Bronze and Iron Age. There seems to have
been a shift away from zoonotic parasites contracted
from eating raw or undercooked animals, to parasites
transmitted by poor personal hygiene (dysentery,
roundworm,
whipworm).
Whether
these
wild
animals were no longer being caught and eaten in
the Bronze and Iron Age, or whether the meat was
just being cooked better (so killing the parasites), is
not entirely clear.
In the Middle East, the ancient parasite evidence
before the time of the Romans is more complicated
to interpret. This is because human civilization
started in the region, where farming, herding and
early town and city formation began perhaps 5000
years before they did in Europe (Harris, 1996;
Zeder, 2011). Major civilizations developed in
Mesopotamia and Egypt several millennia before
the expansion of the Roman Empire, and so they
were already experiencing the effects of higher popu-
lation density, the challenges of sanitation and long
distance trade with the potential spread of infectious
diseases. Intestinal parasites found in the region
before Roman times include Fasciola genus liver
fluke, fish tapeworm, lancet liver fluke, pinworm,
roundworm, schistosomiasis (Schistosomiasis haema-
tobium and Schistosomiasis mansoni), Taenia genus
tapeworm, threadworm (Strongyloides stercoralis)
and whipworm. Mummification in Egypt also
allows the identification of endoparasites not pre-
served by the skeletonized burials of northern
Europe, such as the species that cause dracunculia-
sis, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, toxoplasmosis
and trichinosis (Anastasiou, 2015). It is clear that
there was a very broad range of parasites present in
the Middle East and North Africa region prior to
the arrival of the Romans. It is quite likely this
resulted from the higher population density from
existing civilizations, the warm climate and the fact
that many parasites of humans originated in Africa
(Kliks, 1990; Mitchell, 2013).
INTESTINAL PARASITES IN THE ROMAN PERIOD
As the geographical borders of Roman influence
varied over time, we will only include evidence
from Roman contexts, rather than merely regions
that were at some point governed by the Romans.
Parasites have been identified from Roman period
excavations undertaken in 10 modern countries:
Austria, Belgium, Britain, Egypt, France, Germany,
Israel, Italy, The Netherlands and Poland. The sites
in Italy itself include Rome, Pompeii and Parma.
Others are from cesspits, sewer drains, rubbish pits,
bog bodies and mummified burials from across
Europe and the Mediterranean region.
Human whipworms were found in 8 countries
(Table 1), and based on current evidence they
seem to have been the most widely spread intestinal
parasite in the Roman Empire (Jansen and Over,
1962, 1966; Pike, 1968; Wilson and Rackham,
1976; Jones and Hutchinson, 1991; Rousset et al.
1996; Aspöck et al. 1999; Heirbaut et al. 2011;

 Searcey et al. 2013). This is a fecal oral parasite
spread by the contamination of food with feces
(Garcia, 2009, 332). It could have been spread by
the use of unwashed hands to prepare food or by
the use of human feces as crop fertilizer.
Human roundworm was the next most widely
found parasite species in Roman sites, being iden-
tified in 6 countries (Jansen and Over, 1962, 1966;
Pike, 1968; Wilson and Rackham, 1976; Jones and
Hutchinson, 1991; Rousset et al. 1996; Aspöck
et al. 1999; Searcey et al. 2013). Just as was the
case for whipworm, roundworm is spread by the
fecal contamination of food, and so limited hand
hygiene and the manuring of crops with human
feces would have facilitated its spread.
The fish tapeworms were also found in 6 coun-
tries, namely Austria, Britain, France, Germany,
Israel and Poland (Szidat, 1944; Jansen and Over,
1962; De Rouffignac, 1985; Le Bailly and Bouchet,
2013). They are spread by eating fish of species
that spend at least part of their life cycle in fresh
water such as rivers or lakes. The parasite eggs of
this species will not develop in sea water. If the
fish is cooked, this will kill the parasite. Hence, fish
tapeworm is typically found in regions where raw,
smoked or pickled fish is eaten rather than cooked
fish (Garcia, 2009, 354).
Beef/pork/Asiatic tapeworms of humans and dog
tapeworm (Echinococcus sp.) eggs all appear similar
on microscopy so, these can only be identified to
species level using ancient DNA analysis. Eggs
have been recovered from Roman Period sites in
Britain, Egypt, Germany and Israel (Jansen and
Over, 1962; De Rouffignac, 1985; Harter et al.

Human parasites in the Roman World
https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182015001651

 2004; Le Bailly et al. 2010).From human feces, its
presence indicates that raw or undercooked beef,
pork or similar large farm animals were being eaten
by the population.
Lancet liver flukes have been found in Austria,
Britain, France, Israel and the Netherlands (Pike,
1968; Aspök et al. 1999; Le Bailly and Bouchet,
2010; Searcey et al. 2013). It is generally an infection
of animals such as cattle, so if undercooked cow liver
is eaten, the eggs of this parasite may end up in
human
feces,
an
example
of
false
parasitism.
However, Dicrocoelium genus parasites can poten-
tially infect humans and may cause diarrhoea and ab-
dominal bloating. A good example confirming
genuine infection of a person in Roman times is
the mummy known as Zweeloo woman, dating
from 78 to 233 AD (calibrated radiocarbon date).
This bog body from the Netherlands was found to
have whipworm and roundworm eggs in her intes-
tines, but the eggs of Dicrocoelium dendriticum in
the preserved liver (Searcey et al. 2013).
Entamoeba histolytica infection has been detected
using ELISA in Roman period samples from
latrines and cesspits in Belgium, France and Italy
(Gonçalves et al. 2004; Le Bailly and Bouchet,
2006, 2015). Entamoeba histolytica is spread by the
drinking of water contaminated by human feces,
and can cause outbreaks of dysentery, with bloody
diarrhoea,
abdominal
pain
and
fevers
(Garcia,
2009, 256).
Hydatid disease (Echinococcus granulosus) can be
identified
in
archaeological
samples
from
the
calcified cysts found in the abdomen or thorax of
human burials. If humans inadvertently consume
the eggs of this dog tapeworm, the hydatid cysts
develop in the organs of the body. Good examples
from the Roman period include calcified hydatid
cysts in the burial of a 3rd–4th century AD adoles-
cent at Amiens in France, and from 1st century
AD
Jerusalem
(Zias
and
Mumcuoglu,
1991;
Mowlavi et al. 2014).
Pinworm eggs have been found in the mummified
remains of a teenage girl and an adult male from the
Dakleh Oasis in Egypt (30BC–395 AD), and also in
latrine soil from the Essenes sect at Qumran in Israel
(100 BC–100 AD) (Horne, 2002; Zias et al. 2006). It
is spread by fecal contamination of hands or by air-
borne transmission, and causes intense anal itching
at night.
Fasciola genus liver fluke eggs have only been
found in one Roman period archaeological context,
in Egypt (Harter, 2003). The liver fluke is contracted
by humans who eat unwashed water plants grown in
locations where farm animals such as sheep and
cattle drop their dung (Garcia, 2009, 368).
Capillariosis (Capillaria hepatica) was identified
in a burial from France (Mowlavi et al. 2014).
Often capillaria eggs in the feces represent false para-
sitism, when uncooked animal organs had been
consumed and passed unchanged in the feces.
However, this example was of capillaria eggs embed-
ded in the calcified wall of a hydatid cyst. This
demonstrates genuine infection of the individual
with capillariosis while they were alive.
Malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and toxoplasmo-
sis (Toxoplasma gondii) have been identified from
their
preserved
ancient
DNA
in
an
Egyptian
mummy dating from the third intermediate to
Roman Period (Khairat et al. 2013). Malaria is
spread by the bite of mosquitos and infection
causes fevers, enlarged liver and spleen, and may
cause death especially in children (Garcia, 2009,
302). Toxoplasmosis is generally contracted by
humans who are in close contact with cats. Since
cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt with many
being mummified and used as religious offerings
(Ikram, 2005), it is possible this exposure to cats
put the inhabitants of Egypt at added risk of con-
tracting this parasite compared with other parts of
the Roman Empire.
ECTOPARASITES IN THE ROMAN PERIOD
Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice
(Pediculus humanus corporis), pubic lice (Phthirus
pubis), fleas (Pulex irritans) and bed bugs (Cimex lec-
tularius) have been identified at a range of archaeo-
logical sites across the world and across time
periods (Mumcuoglu, 2008). Ectoparasites from
Roman period settlements have been preserved in
combs,
textiles,
tombs
and
waterlogged
soils.
While they have not been identified in as many coun-
tries as the eggs of intestinal helminths, this seems to
reflect the location and interests of those who have
been searching for them, and probably does not ne-
cessarily indicate their absence from the rest of the
Roman Empire.
Head lice and their eggs have been recovered from
Roman period wooden combs from the Essene reli-
gious sect at Qumran (1st century BC–1st century
AD)
and
the
Jewish
fortress
of
Masada
(1st
century AD), Israel (Mumcuoglu and Zias, 1988).
Body lice have also been noted on textiles from
Masada dating to the time of Jewish revolt against
the Romans (66–73 AD) (Mumcuoglu et al. 2003).
In Britain, large numbers of human fleas have
been recovered from sediment layers in Roman
Period York (Hall and Kenward, 2015). A pubic
louse was recovered from a waterlogged Roman pit
dating from the late 1st to mid-2nd century AD
Carlisle (Kenward, 1999). The probable remains of
a bed bug were found at Roman Alcester in
Warwickshire (Osborne, 1971). One study has
assessed the number of ectoparasites in sediments
in the same town to compare the Roman period
with later times. In York, the concentration of ecto-
parasites in Roman, Viking and medieval layers were
similar across the centuries. For example, human

 head and body lice were found in over 50 archaeo-
logical layers and fleas were also routinely detected
(Kenward and Hall 1995, 488-91 and 700-3; Hall
and Kenward, 2015, 114). This suggests that the
Roman habit of washing at the public baths does
not seem to have decreased their risk of contracting
ectoparasites, compared with Vikings and medieval
people who did not use public baths in the same way.
Ectoparasites are also known to spread bacterial
infectious diseases amongst humans. For example,
the body louse can transmit louse-borne relapsing
fever
(Borrelia
recurrentis),
epidemic
typhus
(Rikkettsia prowazekii) and trench fever (Bartonella
qintana) (Gunn and Pitt, 2012, 157). The ancient
DNA of these organisms has been extracted from
human skeletal remains and from the lice themselves
from post-Roman archaeological sites in the past
(Raoult et al. 2006; Tran et al. 2011a). It is therefore
quite plausible that some Roman period epidemics
could have been caused by these bacterial diseases
spread by ectoparasites.
Rodent fleas such as Xenopsylla cheopis are
thought to have spread bubonic plague (Yersinia
pestis) in recent epidemics among humans. When
rats die from plague infection, it has been noted
that fleas have to transfer to feed from humans
rather than starve themselves, so spreading the
disease (Schotthoefer et al. 2011; Chouikha and
Hinnebusch, 2012; Bobrov et al. 2015). It is not en-
tirely clear which ectoparasites were responsible for
spreading plague in past pandemics, since the medi-
eval Black Death still spread across areas such as
Scandinavia where rats have been shown to have
been either absent or very rare (Hufthammer and
Walløe, 2013). The first pandemic of bubonic
plague is known as the plague of Justinian, and
took place from 541 to 543 AD. It started in the
Eastern Roman Empire and then spread across the
rest
of
Europe
and
the
Mediterranean
region
(Little, 2011). Ancient DNA analysis of human skel-
etal remains from mass graves dating to this event
has determined the genome sequence of the Y.
pestis strain responsible for the pandemic (Harbeck
et al. 2013; Wagner et al. 2014). This has demon-
strated that the strain was much earlier on the evolu-
tionary
tree
than
modern
plague
strains,
highlighting considerable evolution of the bacterium
over the last 1500 years.
HOW DID THE ROMANS CHANGE PARASITISM
ACROSS THE EMPIRE?
If we are going to assess the impact of Romanization
across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa,
then it is important to compare the evidence for
parasites before, during and after the Romans. We
have to be careful how we do this, to ensure the con-
clusions are not misleading due to limitations in the
evidence. Some parasites eggs are more fragile than
others (such as hookworm and pinworm) and so
could have been present in the past despite lack of
surviving evidence. In consequence, I will not
make claims about the meaning of the presence or
absence of these species here. Similarly, some time
periods may have been better studied in the past
and this might give us more evidence for parasites
at the time. In the geographic region under study,
there have extremely few studies of parasites in the
Paleolithic
period, a moderate number in the
Neolithic, fewer in the Bronze and Iron Age, a mod-
erate number in the Roman period and a large
number in the medieval period. This must be
borne in mind when comparing change between
the Bronze and Iron Ages with the Roman period,
in particular. However, I would argue that we actu-
ally have a fairly good idea of the parasites present in
the Bronze and Iron Ages for the region that would
later become the Roman Empire. There is evidence
for the species present in what is now Austria,
Britain, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel
and Poland, and in some countries a number of
different Bronze and Iron Age sites have been ana-
lysed
(Aspöck
et
al.
1999;
Anastasiou,
2015;
Anastasiou and Mitchell, 2015). This means that if
tough-walled parasite species are absent across all
or many of these excavations, it is quite likely to in-
dicate that the species was either rare or absent at
that time.
Before the Romans, the Neolithic farmers of
Europe and Mediterranean region could be infected
with a combination of zoonotic endoparasites such as
fish tapeworm, Lancet liver fluke, Fasciola genus
liver fluke, bile duct fluke, capillariosis and also para-
site species specifically evolved to infect humans
such as roundworm, whipworm, hookworm, beef/
pork tapeworm and Entamoeba dysentery protozoa.
However, by the time of the Bronze and Iron Age
there had already been a shift away from zoonotic
parasites so that parasites spread by poor sanitation
dominated.
Interestingly,
this
is
mirrored
by
modern nomadic hunter-gatherer societies who
settle and become farmers (Dounias and Froment,
2006). Hence, at the time the Romans expanded
their empire the dominant parasites in Europe
were roundworm, whipworm and Entamoeba proto-
zoa that cause dysentery. Interestingly, Lancet liver
fluke was also fairly widespread, suggesting that ants
were either accidentally or deliberately consumed.
The picture in the Middle East and North Africa
at the arrival of the Romans is more complex as
ancient civilizations already existed there. In these
regions, the range of endemic species was much
greater than was the case for Europe.
At the time of the Romans, we see the most wide-
spread and dominant species were roundworm and
whipworm. The Romans are credited with spread-
ing the concept of hygienic latrines across the
empire, with contoured seats, flushing systems,

(Hobson,
2009;
Jansen
et
al.
2011;
Antoniou and Angelakis, 2015; Koloski-Ostrow,
2015). They introduced the culture of person clean-
liness with the regular washing in heated public
baths (Yegül, 2010). The Romans also introduced
legislation whereby human waste from towns and
cities would be collected in carts and taken out to
the countryside (Taylor, 2015). Modern research
has shown that clean drinking water, latrine use
and hand washing all decrease the prevalence of geo-
helminths such as whipworm and roundworm
(Zeigelbauer et al. 2012). In view of this, we might
expect the prevalence of fecal oral parasites such as
whipworm and roundworm to drop in Roman
times rather than increase. However, this was not
the case and we must ask ourselves why.
One possibility is that the eggs of roundworms
and whipworms were spread via the warm commu-
nal waters of the Roman bathhouses. In some
baths the water was only changed intermittently,
and could acquire a scum on the surface from
human dirt and cosmetics. Clearly, not all Roman
baths were as clean as they might have been
(Fagan, 2000; Yegül, 2010). Another possible ex-
planation is that the Romans were known to have
used the human feces collected from towns to fertil-
ize crops growing in the fields (Jones, 2012; Taylor,
2015). This has been shown in modern research to
increase crop yields (Heinonen-Tanski and van-
Wijk-Sebesma, 2005). However, unless the feces
are composted for many months before being
added to the fields, this can result in the spread of
viable parasite eggs to the plants grown (Phuc et al.
2006; Jensen et al. 2008). Hence, it may be the use
of human feces as crop fertilizer under the Romans
that led to an increase in roundworm and whipworm
despite their use of sanitation technologies.
Fish tapeworms were found to be surprisingly
widespread in the Roman period. This is in contrast
to Bronze and Iron Age Europe, where fish tape-
worm eggs have only been in France and Germany
(Le Bailly and Bouchet, 2013). Bearing in mind
there are Bronze and Iron Age sites where parasites
have been identified from 7 different countries, the
identification of fish tapeworm in just 2 countries
suggests the parasite was relatively uncommon at
that time. In the Roman period it was identified in
6 countries, which was as many as roundworm.
Roundworm
and
whipworm
are
perceived
by
modern researchers to have been more ubiquitous
in past farming populations than all other intestinal
helminths (Reinhard et al. 2013; Reinhard and
Pucu de Araújo, 2014). However, this study has
shown for the first time quite how widespread fish
tapeworm was at the time of the Romans. It is unlike-
ly that the increase in its detection in Roman period
samples is due to chance. It is notable that five of
the 6 countries where fish tapeworm was identified
were in northern Europe. In northern Europe it
was common in the past to smoke, dry, salt or
pickle fish to preserve it, and it was often eaten un-
cooked (Hoffman, 2003; Hagen, 2006, 275–276).
The culture of eating uncooked fish may be one
element as to why the parasite was quite widespread
at this time, but does not explain why there appears
to have been an increase between the Bronze/Iron
Age and the Roman Period. We must ask ourselves
which aspect of Romanization in Europe seems to
have triggered this apparent rise in fish tapeworm.
One possibility that could explain a change in fish
tapeworm distribution in the Roman period is the
Roman enthusiasm for fish sauce, known as garum,
liquamen or muria (Cool, 2006, 58). It was not
only used as a culinary ingredient, but also as a medi-
cine (Curtis, 1984). Garum was a fermented sauce
made from pieces of fish, herbs, salt and flavourings.
This sauce was not cooked, but allowed to ferment in
the sun (Curtis, 1983). Garum seems to have its
origins in the Mediterranean region, but over time
was made in northern Europe where fish tapeworm
was much more common. Archaeological examples
of garum in Roman pottery vessels have been recov-
ered at many sites, and the bones of fish from these
pots include both sea fish and fresh water fish (Van
Neer et al. 2005; Locker, 2007). Garum was traded
right across the empire, ensuring that people living
in regions that were not endemic for fish tapeworm
would still have been at risk of contracting the para-
site (Curtis, 1988; Haley, 1990). It is quite possible
that this fermented fish sauce may have acted as a
vector for the spread of fish tapeworm and hence
contributed to the rise in the archaeological evidence
for fish tapeworm in the Roman Empire.
We can see that in Roman times we still have evi-
dence for genuine parasitism of humans by zoonotic
parasites that generally affect animals rather than
humans today. The Zweeloo woman bog body was
found to have infection by Lancet liver fluke in her
liver at the time of death (Searcey et al. 2013). An in-
dividual from 3rd to 4th century Amiens in France
was found to have the eggs of C. hepatica entombed
in the calcified walls of hydatid cysts, so demonstrat-
ing a case of true infective capillariosis during their
life (Mowlavi et al. 2014). This illustrates how
certain parasites that rarely infect humans today
may have caused active infection in past peoples
living a less hygienic life style than in modern times.
In Roman times, we have parasite species such as
beef and pork tapeworm spread by the consumption
of farm animals. We also see the appearance of echi-
nococcosis from dog tapeworm, compatible with the
close contact between humans and dogs kept for
herding animals or as pets (O’Connor, 2008). In
Egypt, the reverence for cats may have facilitated
the spread of toxoplasmosis in Roman times there.
It is also interesting to consider the absence of
certain parasites in the Roman Empire. We might

 expect to have found the eggs of S. haematobium or
S. mansoni in Roman latrines in Europe as soldiers,
officials and merchants moved between the Middle
East and the rest of the empire. There is good arch-
aeological evidence for such migrations from ana-
lysis of skull shape, stable isotopes in teeth and
written
Roman
texts
(Leach
et
al.
2009).
Schistosomiasis has been identified in Syria and
Egypt well before the Roman Period (Anastasiou
et al. 2014; Anastasiou and Mitchell, 2015). Both
S. haematobium and S. mansoni have been recovered
from medieval latrines in France dating from 1450 to
1550 AD, indicating the migration of travellers
between France and areas endemic for schistosomia-
sis (Bouchet and Paicheler, 1995; Bouchet et al.
2002). However, such evidence for migration with
parasites has yet to be identified at Roman period
sites.
We can get an indication of how parasite infection
changed after the Roman Period by comparing exca-
vations of levels from different time periods at the
same sites. In Italy, whipworm was the only
species of helminth egg recovered from Roman
Period Parma. This is in contrast to the 6 species
found in the same town during the medieval period
(roundworm, whipworm, lancet liver fluke, fish
tapeworm, Taenia/Echinococcus sp. and Capillaria
sp.) (Bosi et al. 2011; Florenzano et al. 2012). This
increase in species found in the same time over this
1000-year period gives an indication of how parasite
infections do appear to have been rather different in
Roman times compared with later periods. The
change may reflect the increasing population size of
medieval
towns
compared
with
most
classical
towns in Europe outside Rome itself, as larger popu-
lations generally sustain infectious diseases better
than small populations. In the medieval period fish
tapeworm was even more common than in the
Roman Empire, and this may reflect the spread of
Christianity and the eating of fish on Fridays and
other religious fast days in medieval times (Yeh
et al. 2014; Mitchell, 2015b).
MEDICAL HISTORY OF ROMAN PARASITES
Having demonstrated that a range of endoparasites
and ectoparasites infected people living in the
Roman Empire, it makes sense to consider what
they thought of their parasites, and whether they
may have tried to treat them medically.
The core philosophy underpinning Roman beliefs
about
medicine
originated
in
classical
Greece,
largely
from
the
Hippocratic
corpus
of
texts.
Hippocrates was a medical practitioner born on the
island of Kos in the Aegean Sea. He lived during
the 5th and 4th centuries BC and the texts he
wrote were augmented by those of his students and
laid out a new way of thinking about how disease ori-
ginated. Hippocrates argued that a state of disease
could be triggered by an imbalance in the propor-
tions of the four humours (black bile, yellow bile,
blood and phlegm) or a corruption of one of these
humours (Totelin, 2009; Mann, 2012). The key
texts that mention intestinal helminths were in the
three works entitled Prognostics, Epidemics and
Coan Prognoses (Hippocrates, 1839; Trompoukis
et al. 2007).
The leading Roman period medical practitioner
was Aelius Galenus, who lived from c.130 AD to
c.210AD. Galen was a physician to the Roman
Emperors Marcus Aurelius (ruled 161–180 AD),
Commodus (ruled 180–192 AD) and Septimus
Severus (ruled 193–211 AD), and wrote a large col-
lection of medical texts (Johnston, 2006; Hankinson,
2008; Mattern, 2013). He followed the humoural
theory of Hippocrates, and also adopted his basic
classification of helminths. Galen described three
groups of intestinal worms, named lumbrici lati,
teretes and ascarides. We do have to be careful
when using ancient texts to come to a modern diag-
nosis of past disease, as there are many factors that
might complicate a seemingly obvious description
(Mitchell, 2011). However, from these descriptions
it has been proposed that these terms probably
equate to Taenia genus tapeworms, roundworm
and pinworm, respectively (Jirsa and Winiwarter,
2010). Galen believed that helminths were formed
from spontaneous generation in putrified matter
under the effect of heat. He recommended treatment
with dietary modification, bloodletting and medi-
cines that were believed to have a cooling and
drying effect, in order to return the humoural
balance to normal. Galen’s beliefs as to the origin
and
treatment
of
intestinal
parasites
were
to
become the accepted view in Europe and the
Middle East for over 1000 years, until the time of
the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
While medical practitioners attempted to treat
certain types of parasite with medicines, we have
archaeological evidence that people also tried to
physically remove head lice with special combs. In
Roman Period Judea (Israel), two-sided combs of
wood, bone or ivory have been excavated. On one
side the teeth of the comb were well spaced, presum-
ably in order to comb the hair. On the other side the
teeth were placed very close together, in order to
remove the head lice and eggs. Indeed both lice and
their eggs have been noted on microscopy, caught
between the fine teeth (Mumcuoglu and Zias, 1988).
Concluding remarks
We can see that 12 species of endoparasite and 5
species of ectoparasite have been identified in
Roman Period archaeological sites. Roman technol-
ogy such as flushing latrines, clean piped water,
sewers and drains, hand washing and bath houses
does
not
seem
to
have
protected
them
from

 contracting either intestinal parasites or ectopara-
sites. Using human feces as crop fertilizer may
explain why roundworms and whipworms were so
common in the Roman period. Certain ectoparasites
may well have spread infectious diseases, and one
likely example to have been spread by flea bite was
the Plague of Justinian, now known to have been
an early strain of bubonic plague.
One unexpected finding from this analysis was
that fish tapeworms seem to have been fairly wide-
spread in Roman Period Europe, in contrast to the
evidence from the Bronze and Iron Age. After con-
sidering possible explanations, it seems plausible
that the Roman enthusiasm for the fermented fish
sauce known as garum may have acted as a method
where fish tapeworm eggs could have been trans-
ported large distances across the empire and then
be consumed without being subjected to cooking.
We have presented archaeological evidence for
genuine infection by parasites that rarely cause
disease in people living today. Examples of lancet
liver fluke and capillariosis that were not false para-
sitism suggest that the way of life under the
Romans
may
have
facilitated
the
invasion
of
human tissues by these organisms more easily than
do modern lifestyles.
Roman doctors believed intestinal worms were
formed by spontaneous generation from putrefied
matter under the effect of heat. They tried to treat
them by rebalancing the four bodily humours with
dietary modification, bloodletting and medicines.
There is also evidence for special delousing combs
to strip head lice from the hair, and delousing may
have been a daily routine for many people living
across the Roman Empire.
