Dogs were the first domesticated animal and, according to the archaeological evidence, have had a 
close relationship with humans for at least 15,000 years. Today, dogs are common pets in our society 
and have been linked to increased well-being and improved health outcomes in their owners. A dog in 
the family during childhood is associated with ownership in adult life. The underlying factors behind 
this association could be related to experiences or to genetic influences. We aimed to investigate the 
heritability of dog ownership in a large twin sample including all twins in the Swedish Twin Registry born 
between 1926 and 1996 and alive in 2006. Information about dog ownership was available from 2001 to 
2016 from national dog registers. The final data set included 85,542 twins from 50,507 twin pairs with 
known zygosity, where information on both twins were available in 35,035 pairs. Structural equation 
modeling was performed to estimate additive genetic effects (the heritability), common/shared 
environmental, and unique/non-shared environmental effects. We found that additive genetic factors 
largely contributed to dog ownership, with heritability estimated at 57% for females and 51% for males. 
An effect of shared environmental factors was only observed in early adulthood. In conclusion, we show 
a strong genetic contribution to dog ownership in adulthood in a large twin study. We see two main 
implications of this finding: (1) genetic variation may have contributed to our ability to domesticate 
dogs and other animals and (2) potential pleiotropic effects of genetic variation affecting dog ownership 
should be considered in studies examining health impacts of dog ownership.
The relationship between humans and dogs is the longest of all the domestic animals, yet the origin and history of 
perhaps our most iconic companion animal remains an enigma, and a topic of much ongoing scientific debate1. 
Decades of archaeological and more recent genetic investigations across the world have so far failed to resolve the 
fundamental questions of where, when and why wolves formed the transformational partnership with humans 
that finally resulted in the first domestic dog.
Although recent claims for the existence of so-called “Palaeolithic dogs”2–5 as early as 30,000 years ago 
remain controversial6,7, there is incontrovertible evidence for the existence of domestic dogs in pre-farming 
hunter-gatherer societies in Europe at least 15,000 years ago, the Far East 12,500, and the Americas 10,000 years 
ago8–10.
Over the subsequent millennia this ‘special relationship’ developed apace throughout most cultures of the 
world and is as strong and complex today as it has ever been. Dogs have long been important as an extension to 
the human ‘toolkit’
, assisting with various tasks such as hunting, herding, and protection, as well as for more social

activities such as ritual and companionship. The diverse roles that dogs fulfilled most likely introduced a range of 
selective advantages to those human groups with domesticated dogs. The anthropologist Dr. Pat Shipman went so 
far as to suggest that the close connection between dogs, other animals and their domesticators had a significant 
and tangible influence on our bio-cultural history - the animal connection hypothesis11. A number of experimental 
studies demonstrate that the view of dogs and other animal stimuli influence human behavior and interest from 
early childhood onward implicating innate mechanisms12,13, whilst others conversely highlight innate adverse 
responses to spiders and snakes in humans, indicating the evolutionary benefits of avoiding snakes and spiders14.
Inspired by assumed physical and psychosocial benefits of dog ownership, pet dogs are now increasingly being 
used in interventions for the rehabilitation of prisoners15, in-patient care16 and during pediatric post-surgical 
care17. A large number of studies have shown dog owners to be more physically active18–20, leading to acquisition 
of a dog being recommended as an intervention to improve health. There is also evidence that dog-owners feel 
less lonely21 and have an improved perception of wellbeing, particularly with regard to single people and the 
elderly22–24. We have previously shown that dog ownership is associated with longevity25 and lower risk of child-
hood asthma26. However, there are studies showing no relation (or even an inverse one) between dog ownership 
and these health outcomes27–29. One of the important limitations of the available evidence regarding health effects 
of dog ownership is that it is uncertain whether health differences between dog owners and non-dog owners 
reflect effects of dog ownership itself, or underlying pre-existing differences in personality, health and genetics. 
Such factors may impact the choice to acquire a dog in adult life as well as health outcomes – although these fac-
tors are difficult to disentangle.
Previous research has indicated that exposure to pets during childhood is positively associated with more 
positive attitudes towards pets30 and ownership in adulthood31,32, but it is unclear if genetic differences between 
families contribute to this association. The heritability of a trait can be estimated from studies comparing con-
cordance of the trait in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic twins (DZ) using structural equation modeling. These 
estimations rely on the underlying assumptions that MZ and DZ twin pairs share environment to a similar degree, 
that MZ twins share their entire genome, and that DZ twins on average share 50% of their segregating alleles33. 
A previous study of twin pairs aged 51–60 indicated that genetic factors account for up to 37% of the variation in 
the frequency of pet play and that less than 10% is attributable to the shared childhood environment34 indicating 
a strong contribution of genetic factors to the amount of playful interaction with pets.
Increased understanding of a potential genetic adaption towards dog ownership would support theories of 
co-evolution of humans and dogs and could also aid the understanding of differences in health outcomes today. 
However, there are no empirical data supporting a genetic contribution to dog ownership, likely due to lack of 
information on dog ownership in large twin cohorts. However, it is now possible to study this using register data 
in Sweden. It is mandatory by law that every dog in Sweden is registered with the Swedish Board of Agriculture. 
Moreover, all dogs sold with a certified pedigree are also registered with the Swedish Kennel Club. A survey con-
ducted by Statistics Sweden in 2012 estimated that 83% (95% confidence interval (CI), 78–87) of dogs are regis-
tered in either or both of the two registers35. In this study, we aimed to estimate the heritability of dog ownership 
in the Swedish Twin Registry, the largest twin cohort in the world.
Material and Methods
Study population. 
The Swedish Twin Registry was founded in the late 1950s and contains information from 
twins born in Sweden >188636. Twin pairs are systematically identified through population and birth registries 
and contacted for inclusion in the registry. Zygosity is determined based on intra-pair physical similarities and, 
for a subset, on DNA testing. In the present study, 93,524 individuals born between 1926 and 1996 were eligible 
for inclusion.
Information about dog ownership was available from Jan 1st 2001 to Dec 31st 2016 through linkage to the dog 
registers held by the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the Swedish Kennel Club. We defined the trait dog own-
ership in a participant as having a dog registered with his/her personal identity number in either of the two dog 
registers at any time after age 15 during follow-up. This implies that the youngest person in the cohort was aged 
20 years at the end of the study period. We excluded 4,042 individuals who had died prior to 2006 and/or those 
who died before age 20 to ensure a minimum of 5 years follow-up. We further excluded 3,940 individuals with 
unknown zygosity, resulting in a final analytical data set of 85,542 individuals. These individuals originated from 
50,507 twin pairs, where 35,035 pairs included both individuals, and 15,472 pairs included only one individual.
Statistical methods. 
We calculated concordance rates and within twin-pair tetrachoric correlations for 
female and male MZ and DZ pairs, respectively, as well as for opposite-sex DZ pairs. We found dog ownership 
frequencies to vary with sex and birth-year, and all further analyses were therefore performed with adjustments 
for these covariates. After initial inspection of data, we decided to model birth year with both linear and quadratic 
effects.
Structural equation modeling was performed to find maximum likelihood estimates for additive genetic 
effects A (the sum of the effects of individual genetic variants influencing the trait), shared environmental C 
(sum of the effects from shared family environment), and unique environmental effects E (sum of the effects from 
environmental factors specific to each individual). We used the liability-threshold model, wherein the liability of 
being a dog-owner is assumed to be normally distributed. We found a small difference in tetrachoric correlations 
across sex when opposite-sex DZ pairs were assumed to have equal correlation as same-sex DZ pairs (p = 0.01). 
We therefore assessed a series of models with and without qualitative and quantitative sex differences. Qualitative 
differences means that the genetic factors influencing dog ownership differ for males and females, and quantita-
tive means that the magnitude of effect differs between sexes. The model with lowest Akaike information crite-
rion37 without significant deterioration of model fit, when compared to the full ACE sex-difference model, was 
deemed as the most parsimonious model (further details in Supplementary Methods).

Finally, based on all same-sex twins, we fitted a model where A, C, and E were allowed to vary by age38. We 
defined age as the mean age of each twin during their individual follow-up, and focused on the range 20–75 years 
old. We adjusted the expected prevalence for age and, because age does not vary between twins in a pair, we 
did not need to adjust for residual genetic confounding39. Thus, the model was based on the classic moderation 
model38, while accounting for phenotype being binary40. Because the model had reduced performance towards 
the extreme ends (i.e., among the youngest and oldest pairs), we used both linear and quadratic moderation 
parameters. We calculated 95% likelihood intervals with a moving average approach to calculate the bounds.
All twin-based analyses were performed using the OpenMx package41 in R42.
Sensitivity analyses. 
We observed an increase of coverage in the dog register kept by the Swedish Board of 
Agriculture during the study period. We therefore performed sensitivity analyses by stratifying the follow-up time 
in two discrete periods, 2001–2007 and 2008–2016. We observed dog-ownership within each period separately, 
and estimated tetrachoric correlations based on this, while ensuring a minimum of 5 years of follow-up within 
each time-period.
Ethical permission. 
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden 
(2016/1392-31/1) and participants had given informed consent for inclusion in the Swedish Twin Registry. All 
research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Results
The participants are described in Table 1. Out of the 85,542 study participants, 8,503 (9.9%) were identified as 
dog-owners. Dog-owners were more commonly female (65.7%) than in the total study sample (53.7%). The most 
common dog breed was “Mixed breed” followed by Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds.
MZ twins had higher concordance rates and tetrachoric correlations (0.58 for females and 0.52 for males) than 
DZ twins (0.35 for females and 0.30 for males), in line with presence of genetic effects (Table 2).
Results from structural equation modelling are presented in Table 3. The estimates for the heritability (A) 
varied between 48% and 57%, with only minor influence indicated for shared environment (C; range 0% to 6%), 
and the remaining variance explained by non-shared environment (E; range 43% to 50%). The most parsimoni-
ous model was the AE-model with both quantitative and qualitative sex-differences. In this model females had a 
slightly higher heritability point estimates (57%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 52–61) than males (51%; 95% CI,

44–57). The opposite-sex DZ twin pairs had a correlation that was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36–0.77) times the expected 
correlation based on same-sex twins, supporting the contribution of qualitative sex differences. When modelling 
the contribution of A, C, and E over age, the relative contribution of A increased throughout ages 20 to 75 (Fig. 1). 
The contribution from shared environment (C) was present at lower ages, but decreased to zero at about age 50.
Sensitivity analyses. 
The tetrachoric correlations were similar when using information available in the 
different sub-periods 2001–2007 and 2008–2016 (Supplementary Table 1).
Discussion
The main finding from the present study was that genetic factors greatly contribute to dog ownership in Sweden, 
with heritability estimated to be 57% for females and 51% for males. Shared environmental factors only contrib-
uted in early adulthood. We see two main implications of this finding: (1) genetic variation may have impacted 
our ability to domesticate dogs and other animals and (2) potential pleiotropic effects of genetic variation affect-
ing dog ownership should be considered in studies examining health impacts of dog ownership.
Previous studies. 
Our findings are in line with a previous study in 614 male twin pairs (mean age 55.4) from 
the US Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging34. In that study, the response to the question “During the past 30 days, 
how often did you play with pets” was estimated to have heritability of 37% (95% CI, 28–44%) and <10% due to 
shared environmental factors. Although that estimate is slightly lower than in the present study, the phenotype 
and setting is also different.
Previous research has indicated that pet keeping during childhood is associated with more positive attitudes 
towards pets in adulthood30 and pet ownership in adulthood31. A study of 14,663 children from the UK birth 
cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), showed that mothers that had pets 
during her childhood was a strong predictor of current pet ownership; experience of the father were not inves-
tigated32. In our study, the estimated contribution of shared environmental factors, was small and only detected 
in early adult life. Our results thus indicate that previously reported associations of pet keeping in childhood and 
adulthood are likely to be partly caused by the shared genetic variation between parents and their children.
Biological mechanisms. 
Experimental studies suggest general interest toward live animal stimuli during 
early childhood13,43 with more viewing time spent on pets with certain infant-like facial traits44. According to 
the animal connection hypothesis, it is likely that unexplored genetic variations can explain differences in human 
preferences to keeping pet animals such as dogs11. The long relationship between dogs and humans has seen both 
phenotype and genotypes of wolves transformed to the incredible variation found in modern dogs. As is the case 
for all domesticates, during their long relationship with humans, selection has impacted the nature and trajectory 
of their development45, the retention of juvenile traits46 and for some dogs the ability to digest carbohydrates47. 
However, the selection has not necessarily been unidirectional.

The close connection between humans and their domesticates has almost certainly had significant influence 
on human evolution, genetics, and behavior through reciprocal influences11. One important example of such 
‘gene-culture co-evolution’ is the human lactase gene (LCT) mutation that enables adults in some human pop-
ulations across the world to consume fresh dairy products without gastric distress. Genetic and archaeological 
research has revealed that around 7,500 years ago the LCT mutation arose in Neolithic cattle herders in central 
Europe, providing them a significant selective advantage, as this so-called Linear Band-Keramic culture spread 
westwards across Northern Europe; where the allele is now common48.
Although our current study is the first to provide evidence that human genetic factors may perhaps be 
involved in our choice to keep dogs, our finding does not inform us as to which genes are involved. Like other 
personality-related traits, we expect polygenic inheritance49. Our findings do not provide firm evidence that 
dog ownership has been selected for in evolution. The gene variation of traits under high selection pressure in 
the population become fixed and will hence have low heritability estimates. Moreover, genes influencing dog 
ownership may be highly pleiotropic, and may have been under selection for other reasons. Whilst it is unclear 
from the literature whether there are personality differences between pet and non-pet owners50, there are a num-
ber of studies showing evidence of differences in personality between people who own cats and own dogs51–53. 
Personality measures are also associated with multiple health outcomes54. For example, dog people score higher 
on ‘agreeableness’
, and ‘conscientiousness’ than cat people51, people with higher ‘conscientiousness’ in childhood 
and early adulthood are reported to live longer55,56 and people with higher ‘agreeableness’ are reported to live 
longer and be at lower risk of cardiovascular disease57. Moreover, we have not identified the genes involved and 
future genome-wide association studies are required in order to better understand this topic. To tease out whether 
dog ownership has been under evolutionary selection, comparative molecular genetic studies can be undertaken 
in populations with different historical dependencies on dogs, which could be achieved through a series of care-
fully targeted ethnographic case studies. If genetic variation linked to dog ownership were identified, then these 
could potentially be explored further in the archaeological record using ancient DNA techniques.
Strengths and limitations. 
The strengths of our study lie in the large sample size, the continuously updated 
dog ownership data and the large age span studied. Its limitations, however, include potential misclassification of 
dog owners as non-owners due to two possible reasons. Firstly, not all owners register their ownership; in a survey 
in 2012, the registration rate was estimated at 83%35. If the propensity to report dog-ownership is positively asso-
ciated with the propensity of the co-twin and/or differentially affecting twin pairs depending on zygosity type, the 
estimates may be biased towards an over-estimation of the genetic contribution to dog ownership. However, when 
analyzing periods with worse coverage (prior to 2008) and better coverage, the associations were very similar, 
supporting the fact that different levels of coverage does not greatly influence the within twin pair associations. 
Secondly, each dog is registered to only one owner and as we did not have access to data of partners, by default 
we are misclassifying non-owners where the spouse or household partner is registered as the dog owner. If which 
spouse is registered as owner is purely random, we would have under-estimated the similarity between twins in 
pairs, and thus the heritability and/or shared environment contribution. If women in general are more likely to 
register a dog, this could explain the observed qualitative sex differences. Another limitation to our study is the 
possibility of non-random mating with respect to dog ownership, so called “assortative mating”
. If partner choice 
is influenced by similarities in preferences for or against dogs or by similarities in factors such as allergies hinder-
ing dog ownership, DZ twins will be more similar in dog phenotype than expected from random mating, which 
could yield a heritability estimate biased downwards33.
Conclusion
In this large twin study including 35,035 twin pairs, we show evidence of a strong genetic contribution to dog 
ownership in adulthood. In view of the deep history of animal domestication (the first and oldest being the dog) 
and our long and changing relationship with them, this evidence may be an important first step in unraveling some 
of the most fundamental and largely unanswered questions regarding animal domestication - i.e. how and why?

entirely smooth and a moving average for calculations of the bounds has been employed.
