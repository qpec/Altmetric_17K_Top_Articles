FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 
WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS 
COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV 
 
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 
before initiating treatment with SOVALDI. HBV reactivation has been reported in 
HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment 
with HCV direct acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. 
Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. 
Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation 
during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient 
management for HBV infection as clinically indicated [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)]. 
1

b. Dosage of ribavirin is weight-based (<75 kg = 1000 mg and ≥75 kg = 1200 mg). The daily dosage of ribavirin is 
administered orally in two divided doses with food. Patients with renal impairment (CrCl ≤50 mL/min) require 
ribavirin dosage reduction; refer to ribavirin prescribing information. 
c. Treatment-experienced patients have failed an interferon based regimen with or without ribavirin. 
Patients with Genotype 1 HCV Who are Ineligible to Receive an Interferon-Based 
Regimen 
SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin for 24 weeks can be considered as a therapeutic 
option for patients with genotype 1 infection who are ineligible to receive an interferon-
based regimen [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Treatment decision should be guided by an 
assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient. 
Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Awaiting Liver Transplantation 
Administer SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin for up to 48 weeks or until the time of 
liver transplantation, whichever occurs first, to prevent post-transplant HCV reinfection 
[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. 
2.3 
Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients 12 Years of Age and Older or 
Weighing at Least 35 kg 
The recommended dosage of SOVALDI in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older 
or weighing at least 35 kg is one 400 mg tablet taken orally once daily with or without 
 5 
 
food in combination with ribavirin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies 
(14.5)]. 
The recommended treatment regimen and duration for SOVALDI combination therapy is 
provided in Table 2. Table 3 provides the weight-based dosage of ribavirin when used in

Dosage Modification 
Dosage reduction of SOVALDI is not recommended. 
If a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to peginterferon alfa and/or 
ribavirin, the peginterferon alfa and/or ribavirin dosage should be reduced or 
discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. 
Refer to the peginterferon alfa and ribavirin prescribing information for additional 
information about how to reduce and/or discontinue the peginterferon alfa and/or 
ribavirin dosage.

2.5  
Discontinuation of Dosing 
If the other agents used in combination with SOVALDI are permanently discontinued, 
SOVALDI should also be discontinued. 
2.6  
Severe Renal Impairment and End Stage Renal Disease 
No dosage recommendation can be given for patients with severe renal impairment 
(estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2) or with end 
stage renal disease (ESRD) due to higher exposures (up to 20-fold) of the predominant 
sofosbuvir metabolite [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3)]. 
3 
DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 
SOVALDI is available as a yellow-colored, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet debossed 
with “GSI” on one side and “7977” on the other side. Each tablet contains 400 mg 
sofosbuvir. 
4 
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
When SOVALDI is used in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, the 
contraindications applicable to those agents are applicable to combination therapies. 
Refer to the prescribing information of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for a list of their 
contraindications. 
5 
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
5.1 
Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and 
HBV 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients 
who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals, and 
who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant 
hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are 
HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection 
(i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive).  HBV reactivation has also been reported 
in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of 
HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be 
increased in these patients. 
HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting 
as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, 
reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be 
accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe 
cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur. 
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and 
anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with SOVALDI. In patients with serologic 
evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or 
 7 
 
HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with SOVALDI and during post-treatment follow-
up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. 
5.2  
Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone  
Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker 
intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-
containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone 
who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI 
[ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but 
cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also 
taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced 
liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with 
coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of 
HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. 
Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI is not recommended. For patients taking 
amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be 
coadministered SOVALDI: 
• Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia 
• Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of 
coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the 
heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of 
treatment.  
Patients who are taking SOVALDI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no 
other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as 
outlined above. 
Due to amiodarone’s long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to 
starting SOVALDI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. 
Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation 
immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or 
lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest 
pains, confusion or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions 
(7.1)].  
5.3  
Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers 
Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin, St. John’s wort) may 
significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced 
therapeutic effect of SOVALDI.  The use of rifampin and St. John’s wort with SOVALDI 
is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 
5.4 
Risks Associated with Combination Treatment 
Because SOVALDI is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for treatment of 
HCV infection, consult the prescribing information for these drugs used in combination 
with SOVALDI. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use 
in SOVALDI combination treatment. 
 8 
 
6 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the 
labeling: 
• Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
6.1 
Clinical Trials Experience 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the 
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
When SOVALDI is administered with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, refer to the 
respective prescribing information for a description of adverse reactions associated with 
their use. 
Adverse Reactions in Adult Subjects 
The safety assessment of SOVALDI was based on pooled Phase 3 clinical trial data 
(both controlled and uncontrolled) including: 
• 650 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy for 
12 weeks,  
• 98 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy for 16 weeks,  
• 250 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy for 
24 weeks,  
• 327 subjects who received SOVALDI + peginterferon (Peg-IFN) alfa + ribavirin 
combination therapy for 12 weeks,  
• 243 subjects who received peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 24 weeks, and  
• 71 subjects who received placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 
The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse 
events was 4% for subjects receiving placebo, 1% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + 
ribavirin for 12 weeks, less than 1% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin for 24 
weeks, 11% for subjects receiving peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 24 weeks and 2% for 
subjects receiving SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 12 weeks.  
Adverse events observed in at least 15% of subjects in the Phase 3 clinical trials 
outlined above are provided in Table 4. A side-by-side tabulation is displayed to simplify 
presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial 
designs. 
The most common adverse events (at least 20%) for SOVALDI + ribavirin combination 
therapy were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events (at least 20%) 
for SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue, 
headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia.

a. Subjects received weight-based ribavirin (1000 mg per day if weighing <75 kg or 1200 mg per day if weighing 
≥75 kg). 
b. Subjects received 800 mg ribavirin per day regardless of weight. 
Bilirubin Elevations 
Total bilirubin elevation of more than 2.5xULN was observed in none of the subjects in 
the SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks group and in 1%, 3% and 3% of 
subjects in the peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks 
and SOVALDI + ribavirin 24 weeks groups, respectively. Bilirubin levels peaked during 
the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment and subsequently decreased and returned to baseline 
levels by post-treatment Week 4. These bilirubin elevations were not associated with 
transaminase elevations. 
Creatine Kinase Elevations 
Creatine kinase was assessed in the FISSION and NEUTRINO trials. Isolated, 
asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation of greater than or equal to 10xULN was 
observed in less than 1%, 1% and 2% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 
24 weeks, SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks and SOVALDI + ribavirin 
12 weeks groups, respectively.  
 11 
 
Lipase Elevations 
Isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevation of greater than 3xULN was observed in less 
than 1%, 2%, 2%, and 2% of subjects in the SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 
weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 24 weeks and 
peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks groups, respectively. 
Patients with HCV/HIV-1 Coinfection 
SOVALDI used in combination with ribavirin was assessed in 223 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected 
subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected 
subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Elevated total 
bilirubin (grade 3 or 4) was observed in 30/32 (94%) subjects receiving atazanavir as 
part of the antiretroviral regimen. None of the subjects had concomitant transaminase 
increases. Among subjects not taking atazanavir, grade 3 or 4 elevated total bilirubin 
was observed in 2 (1.5%) subjects, similar to the rate observed with HCV mono-infected 
subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin in Phase 3 trials. 
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older 
The safety assessment of SOVALDI in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older is 
based on data from 50 subjects who were treated with SOVALDI plus ribavirin for 
12 weeks (genotype 2 subjects) or 24 weeks (genotype 3 subjects) in a Phase 2, open-
label clinical trial. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed 
in clinical studies of SOVALDI plus ribavirin in adults [see Clinical Studies 14.5)]. 
6.2 
Postmarketing Experience 
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of 
SOVALDI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population 
of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 
establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. 
Cardiac Disorders 
Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who 
initiate treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen [see Warnings and Precautions 
(5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

DRUG INTERACTIONS 
7.1 
Potentially Significant Drug Interactions 
Sofosbuvir is a substrate of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) while the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 is not. Drugs that are 
P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin or St. John’s wort) may decrease 
sofosbuvir plasma concentration, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI, 
and thus concomitant use with SOVALDI is not recommended [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.3)]. 
 12 
 
Information on potential drug interactions with SOVALDI is summarized in Table 6. The 
table is not all-inclusive [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
Fluctuations in INR values may occur in patients receiving warfarin concomitant with 
HCV treatment, including treatment with SOVALDI. Frequent monitoring of INR values 
is recommended during treatment and post-treatment follow-up.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 
Pregnancy 
Risk Summary 
If SOVALDI is administered with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the 
combination regimen is contraindicated in pregnant women and in men whose female 
partners are pregnant. Refer to the ribavirin and/or peginterferon alfa prescribing 
information for more information on ribavirin- and peginterferon alfa-associated risks of 
use during pregnancy. 
No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not SOVALDI poses a 
risk to pregnancy outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse 
developmental outcomes was observed with sofosbuvir at exposures greater than those 
in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data]. During organogenesis 
in the rat and rabbit, systemic exposures (AUC) to the predominant circulating 
metabolite of sofosbuvir (GS-331007) were ≥5 (rats) and 12 (rabbits) times the 
exposure in humans at the RHD. In the rat pre/postnatal development study, maternal 
systemic exposure (AUC) to GS-331007 was ≥6 times the exposure in humans at the 
RHD. 
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population 
is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth 
defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, 
respectively. 
Data 
Animal Data 
Sofosbuvir was administered orally to pregnant rats (up to 500 mg/kg/day) and rabbits 
(up to 300 mg/kg/day) on gestation days 6 to 18 and 6 to 19, respectively, and also to 
rats (oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day) on gestation day 6 to lactation/post-partum day 
20. No significant effects on embryo-fetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal (rats) 
development were observed at the highest doses tested. Systemic exposures (AUC) to 
the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir (GS-331007) were ≥5 (rats) and 
12 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the RHD, with exposures increasing 
during gestation from approximately 5 to 10 (rats) and 12 to 28 (rabbits) times the 
exposure in humans at the RHD. 
8.2 
Lactation 
Risk Summary 
It is not known whether sofosbuvir or its metabolites are present in human breast milk, 
affect human milk production or have effects on the breastfed infant. The predominant 
circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir (GS-331007) was the primary component observed 
in the milk of lactating rats, without effect on nursing pups [see Data].  
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along 
with the mother’s clinical need for SOVALDI and any potential adverse effects on the 
breastfed child from SOVALDI or from the underlying maternal condition. 
 14 
 
If SOVALDI is administered with ribavirin, the nursing mother’s information for ribavirin 
also applies to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information 
for more information on use during lactation.   
Data 
Animal Data 
No effects of sofosbuvir on growth and postnatal development were observed in nursing 
pups at the highest dose tested in rats. Maternal systemic exposure (AUC) to the 
predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir (GS-331007) was approximately 
12 times the exposure in humans at the RHD, with exposure of approximately 2% that 
of maternal exposure observed in nursing pups on lactation day 10. In a lactation study, 
sofosbuvir metabolites (primarily GS-331007) were excreted into the milk of lactating 
rats following administration of a single oral dose of sofosbuvir (20 mg/kg) on lactation 
day 2, with milk concentrations of approximately 10% that of maternal plasma 
concentrations observed 1 hour post-dose. 
8.3 
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential 
If SOVALDI is administered with ribavirin or peginterferon and ribavirin, the information 
for ribavirin and peginterferon with regard to pregnancy testing, contraception, and 
infertility also applies to these combination regimens. Refer to ribavirin and/or 
peginterferon prescribing information for additional information. 
8.4 
Pediatric Use 
The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SOVALDI in pediatric patients 12 years of 
age and older or weighing at least 35 kg with genotype 2 and 3 infection have been 
established.  SOVALDI was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial (Study 1112), which 
included 50 subjects (13 genotype 2; 37 genotype 3) 12 years of age and older. The 
safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy were comparable to that observed in adults [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.5)]. 
The safety and efficacy of SOVALDI in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older or 
weighing at least 35 kg with compensated cirrhosis is supported by comparable 
sofosbuvir and GS-331007 exposures between: 1) adults and adolescents without 
cirrhosis and 2) adults without cirrhosis and adults with compensated cirrhosis. Thus, 
similar efficacy would be expected for adolescent patients with compensated cirrhosis 
as adults with compensated cirrhosis.  
The safety and efficacy of SOVALDI have not been established in pediatric patients less 
than 12 years of age and weighing less than 35 kg with HCV genotype 2 or 3.  The 
safety and efficacy of SOVALDI have not been established in pediatric patients with 
HCV genotype 1 or 4.  
 15 
 
8.5 
Geriatric Use 
SOVALDI was administered to 90 subjects aged 65 and over. The response rates 
observed for subjects over 65 years of age were similar to that of younger subjects 
across treatment groups. No dosage adjustment of SOVALDI is warranted in geriatric 
patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
8.6 
Renal Impairment 
No dosage adjustment of SOVALDI is required for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. The safety and efficacy of SOVALDI have not been established in patients 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2) or ESRD requiring 
hemodialysis. No dosage recommendation can be given for patients with severe renal 
impairment or ESRD [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3)]. Refer also to ribavirin and peginterferon alfa prescribing information for patients 
with CrCl less than 50 mL/min. 
8.7 
Hepatic Impairment 
No dosage adjustment of SOVALDI is required for patients with mild, moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B or C) [see Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3)]. Safety and efficacy of SOVALDI have not been established in patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis. See peginterferon alfa prescribing information for 
contraindication in hepatic decompensation. 
8.8 
Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Awaiting Liver Transplantation 
SOVALDI was studied in HCV-infected adult subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma 
prior to undergoing liver transplantation in an open-label clinical trial evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of SOVALDI and ribavirin administered pre-transplant to prevent 
post-transplant HCV reinfection. The primary endpoint of the trial was post-transplant 
virologic response (pTVR) defined as HCV RNA less than lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) at 12 weeks post-transplant.  HCV-infected subjects, regardless of genotype, 
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) meeting the MILAN criteria (defined as the 
presence of a tumor 5 cm or less in diameter in patients with single hepatocellular 
carcinomas and no more than three tumor nodules, each 3 cm or less in diameter in 
patients with multiple tumors and no extrahepatic manifestations of the cancer or 
evidence of vascular invasion of tumor) received 400 mg SOVALDI and weight-based 
1000-1200 mg ribavirin daily for 24-48 weeks or until the time of liver transplantation, 
whichever occurred first. An interim analysis was conducted on 61 subjects who 
received SOVALDI and ribavirin; 45 subjects had HCV genotype 1; 44 subjects had a 
baseline CPT score less than 7 and all subjects had a baseline unadjusted MELD score 
up to 14. Of these 61 subjects, 41 subjects underwent liver transplantation following up 
to 48 weeks of treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin; 37 had HCV RNA less than LLOQ 
at the time of transplantation. Of the 37 subjects, the post-transplant virologic response 
(pTVR) rate is 64% (23/36) in the 36 evaluable subjects who have reached the 12 week 
post-transplant time point. The safety profile of SOVALDI and ribavirin in HCV-infected 
subjects prior to liver transplantation was comparable to that observed in subjects 
treated with SOVALDI and ribavirin in Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 16 
 
8.9 
Post-Liver Transplant Patients 
The safety and efficacy of SOVALDI have not been established in post-liver transplant 
patients. 
8.10  Patients with Genotype 5 or 6 HCV Infection 
Available data on subjects with genotype 5 or 6 HCV infection are insufficient for dosing 
recommendations. 
10 
OVERDOSAGE 
The highest documented dosage of sofosbuvir was a single dose of sofosbuvir 1200 mg 
(three times the recommended dosage) administered to 59 healthy subjects. In that trial, 
there were no untoward effects observed at this dosage level, and adverse events were 
similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo and sofosbuvir 
400 mg treatment groups. The effects of higher dosages are not known.  
No specific antidote is available for overdose with SOVALDI. If overdose occurs, the 
patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with 
SOVALDI consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as 
well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. A 4-hour hemodialysis session 
removed 18% of the administered dose. 
11 
DESCRIPTION

Sofosbuvir is a white to off-white crystalline solid with a solubility of ≥ 2 mg/mL across 
the pH range of 2-7.7 at 37 oC and is slightly soluble in water. 
SOVALDI tablets are for oral administration.  Each tablet contains 400 mg of sofosbuvir. 
The tablets include the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, 
croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, mannitol, and microcrystalline cellulose. 
The tablets are film-coated with a coating material containing the following inactive 
 17 
 
ingredients: polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide, and yellow iron 
oxide. 
12 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Sofosbuvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus [see 
Microbiology (12.4)]. 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
Cardiac Electrophysiology 
The effect of sofosbuvir 400 and 1200 mg (three times the recommended dosage) on 
QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-dose, placebo- and active-
controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four period crossover thorough QT trial in 59 healthy 
subjects. At a dosage three times the maximum recommended dosage, SOVALDI does 
not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. 
12.3  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir and the predominant circulating 
metabolite GS-331007 have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in subjects 
with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral administration of SOVALDI, sofosbuvir was 
absorbed with a peak plasma concentration observed at ~0.5–2 hour post-dose, 
regardless of dose level. Peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed 
between 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 
subjects with genotype 1 to 6 HCV infection who were coadministered ribavirin (with or 
without pegylated interferon), geometric mean steady state AUC0-24 was 969 ng•hr/mL 
for sofosbuvir (N=838), and 6790 ng•hr/mL for GS-331007 (N=1695). Relative to 
healthy subjects administered sofosbuvir alone (N=272), the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 
60% higher; and GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 39% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected 
subjects. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose 
range of 200 mg to 1200 mg. 
Effect of Food 
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of SOVALDI with a 
standardized high fat meal did not substantially affect the sofosbuvir Cmax or AUC0-inf. 
The exposure of GS-331007 was not altered in the presence of a high-fat meal. 
Therefore, SOVALDI can be administered without regard to food. 
Distribution 
Sofosbuvir is approximately 61–65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding 
is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 microgram/mL to 
20 microgram/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a 
 18 
 
single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio 
of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. 
Metabolism  
Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active 
nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves 
sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalyzed by human cathepsin A 
(CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad 
nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine 
nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the formation of 
nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks 
anti-HCV activity in vitro. 
After a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir and GS-331007 
accounted for approximately 4% and greater than 90% of drug related material (sum of 
molecular weight-adjusted AUC of sofosbuvir and its metabolites) systemic exposure, 
respectively. 
Elimination 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose 
was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in 
urine, feces, and expired air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose 
recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. 
These data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for 
GS-331007. The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were 0.4 and 
27 hours, respectively. 
Specific Populations 
Race  
Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that race had 
no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS-331007. 
Gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between men 
and women for sofosbuvir and GS-331007.   
Pediatric Patients 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were determined in 50 pediatric 
subjects 12 years of age and older, infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3, receiving a daily 
dose of SOVALDI (400 mg sofosbuvir). The pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir 
and GS-331007 in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older are provided in Table 7. 
Exposures in pediatric subjects were similar to those observed in adults.

The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir have not been established in pediatric subjects less 
than 12 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].  
Geriatric Patients  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected subjects showed that within the 
age range (19 to 75 years) analyzed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the 
exposure to sofosbuvir and GS-331007 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
Patients with Renal Impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative subjects with mild 
(eGFR between 50 to less than 80 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (eGFR between 30 to 
less than 50 mL/min/1.73m2), severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 
30 mL/min/1.73m2) and subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring 
hemodialysis following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir. Relative to subjects with 
normal renal function (eGFR greater than 80 mL/min/1.73m2), the sofosbuvir AUC0-inf 
was 61%, 107% and 171% higher in mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, while 
the GS-331007 AUC0-inf was 55%, 88% and 451% higher, respectively. In subjects with 
ESRD, relative to subjects with normal renal function, sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-
inf was 28% and 1280% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour before hemodialysis 
compared with 60% and 2070% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 hour after 
hemodialysis, respectively. A 4 hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 18% 
of administered dose. No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of SOVALDI have not been 
established in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. No dosage 
recommendation can be given for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 
Patients with Hepatic Impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg 
sofosbuvir in HCV-infected subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class B and C). Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the 
sofosbuvir AUC0-24 were 126% and 143% higher in moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 were 18% and 9% higher, respectively. 
Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected subjects indicated that cirrhosis 
had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS-331007. No 
dosage adjustment of SOVALDI is recommended for patients with mild, moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].  
 20 
 
Assessment of Drug Interactions 
Sofosbuvir is a substrate of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) while GS-331007 is not. Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., 
rifampin or St. John’s wort) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration, leading to 
reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI, and thus concomitant use with SOVALDI is not 
recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].  
Coadministration of SOVALDI with drugs that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase 
sofosbuvir plasma concentration without increasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; 
accordingly, SOVALDI may be coadministered with P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP and thus are not 
expected to increase exposures of drugs that are substrates of these transporters. 
The intracellular metabolic activation pathway of sofosbuvir is mediated by generally low 
affinity and high capacity hydrolase and nucleotide phosphorylation pathways that are 
unlikely to be affected by concomitant drugs. 
The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are 
shown in Table 8. The effects of sofosbuvir on the exposure of coadministered drugs

12.4  Microbiology 
Mechanism of Action 
Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is 
essential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes 
intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog 
triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B 
polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a biochemical assay, GS-461203 
inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotype 1b, 2a, 
3a and 4a with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 micromolar. GS-461203 is neither an 
inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA 
polymerase. 
Antiviral Activity 
In HCV replicon assays, the EC50 values of sofosbuvir against full-length replicons from 
genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a, and chimeric 1b replicons encoding NS5B from 
genotype 2b, 5a or 6a ranged from 0.014 to 0.11 micromolar. The median EC50 value of 
sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons encoding NS5B sequences from clinical isolates 
was 0.062 micromolar for genotype 1a (range 0.029–0.128 micromolar; N=67), 
0.102 micromolar for genotype 1b (range 0.045–0.170 micromolar; N=29), 
0.029 micromolar for genotype 2 (range 0.014–0.081 micromolar; N=15) and 
0.081 micromolar for genotype 3a (range 0.024–0.181 micromolar; N=106). In infectious 
virus assays, the EC50 values of sofosbuvir against genotype 1a and 2a were 0.03 and 
0.02 micromolar, respectively. The presence of 40% human serum had no effect on the 
anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir. Evaluation of sofosbuvir in combination with interferon 
alpha or ribavirin showed no antagonistic effect in reducing HCV RNA levels in replicon 
cells. 
Resistance 
In Cell Culture 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell 
culture for multiple genotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated with the primary NS5B substitution S282T in 
all replicon genotypes examined. An M289L substitution developed along with the 
S282T substitution in genotype 2a, 5 and 6 replicons. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 
S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the replication viral capacity by 89% to 99% 
compared to the corresponding wild-type. In biochemical assays, recombinant NS5B 
polymerase from genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a expressing the S282T substitution 
showed reduced susceptibility to GS-461203 compared to respective wild-types. 
In Clinical Trials 
In a pooled analysis of 982 subjects who received SOVALDI in Phase 3 trials, 
224 subjects had post-baseline NS5B genotypic data from next generation nucleotide 
sequencing (assay cutoff of 1%). 
 23 
 
Treatment-emergent substitutions L159F (n=6) and V321A (n=5) were detected in post-
baseline samples from GT3a-infected subjects across the Phase 3 trials. No detectable 
shift in the phenotypic susceptibility to sofosbuvir of subject isolates with L159F or 
V321A substitutions was seen. The sofosbuvir-associated resistance substitution S282T 
was not detected at baseline or in the failure isolates from Phase 3 trials. However, an 
S282T substitution was detected in one genotype 2b subject who relapsed at Week 4 
post-treatment after 12 weeks of sofosbuvir monotherapy in the Phase 2 trial P7977-
0523 [ELECTRON].  The isolate from this subject displayed a mean 13.5-fold reduced 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir. For this subject, the S282T substitution was no longer 
detectable at Week 12 post-treatment by next generation sequencing with an assay 
cutoff of 1%. 
In the trial done in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma awaiting liver transplantation 
where subjects received up to 48 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin, the L159F 
substitution emerged in multiple subjects with GT1a or GT2b HCV who experienced 
virologic failure (breakthrough and relapse).  Furthermore, the presence of substitutions 
L159F and/or C316N at baseline was associated with sofosbuvir breakthrough and 
relapse post-transplant in multiple subjects infected with GT1b HCV. In addition, S282R 
and L320F substitutions were detected on-treatment by next generation sequencing in a 
subject infected with GT1a HCV with a partial treatment response.  
The clinical significance of these substitutions is not known. 
Cross Resistance  
HCV replicons expressing the sofosbuvir-associated resistance substitution S282T were 
susceptible to NS5A inhibitors and ribavirin. HCV replicons expressing the ribavirin-
associated substitutions T390I and F415Y were susceptible to sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir 
was active against HCV replicons with NS3/4A protease inhibitor, NS5B non-nucleoside 
inhibitor and NS5A inhibitor resistant variants.

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis 
Use with Ribavirin and/or Peginterferon alfa: Refer to prescribing information for 
ribavirin and/or peginterferon alfa for information on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. 
Sofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and 
in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. 
Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were conducted with sofosbuvir. Mice 
were administered doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day in males and 600 mg/kg/day in 
females, while rats were administered doses of up to 750 mg/kg/day in males and 
females. No increase in the incidence of drug-related neoplasms were observed at the 
highest doses tested in mice and rats, resulting in AUC exposure to the predominant 
circulating metabolite GS-331007 of approximately 7 and 30 times (in mice) and 13 and 
 24 
 
17 times (in rats), in males and females respectively, the exposure in humans at the 
recommended clinical dose. 
Impairment of Fertility 
Use with Ribavirin and/or Peginterferon alfa: Refer to prescribing information for 
ribavirin and/or peginterferon alfa for information on impairment of fertility. 
Sofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-fetal viability or on fertility when evaluated in rats. 
At the highest dose tested, AUC exposure to the predominant circulating metabolite 
GS-331007 was approximately 8 times the exposure in humans at the recommended 
clinical dose.

Subjects in the adult trials did not have cirrhosis or had compensated cirrhosis. 
SOVALDI was administered at a dose of 400 mg once daily. The ribavirin (RBV) dosage 
for adult subjects was weight-based at 1000-1200 mg daily administered in two divided 
doses when used in combination with SOVALDI, and the peginterferon alfa 2a dosage, 
where applicable, was 180 micrograms per week. Treatment duration was fixed in each 
trial and was not guided by subjects’ HCV RNA levels (no response guided algorithm). 
Plasma HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical trials using the COBAS 
TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System. The assay had a 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU per mL. Sustained virologic response 
(SVR12) was the primary endpoint which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 
12 weeks after the end of treatment. 
14.2 Clinical Trials in Subjects with Genotype 1 or 4 HCV 
Treatment-Naïve Adults ─ NEUTRINO (Study 110) 
NEUTRINO was an open-label, single-arm trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment 
with SOVALDI in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in treatment-naïve 
subjects with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 HCV infection compared to pre-specified historical 
control. 
Treated subjects (N=327) had a median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 70); 64% of the 
subjects were male; 79% were White, 17% were Black; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; 
mean body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 56 kg/m2); 78% had baseline HCV 
RNA greater than 6 log10 IU per mL; 17% had cirrhosis; 89% had HCV genotype 1; 9% 
had HCV genotype 4 and 2% had HCV genotype 5 or 6. Table 11 presents the SVR12 
for the treatment group of SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin in subjects with 
genotype 1 or 4 HCV. Available data on subjects with genotype 5 or 6 HCV treated with 
SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 12 weeks were insufficient for dosing 
recommendations; therefore these results are not presented in Table 11 [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.10)].

SVR12 rates were 99% (89/90) in subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV and baseline 
IL28B C/C allele and 87% (200/230) in subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV and baseline 
IL28B non-C/C alleles. 
It is estimated that the SVR12 in patients who previously failed pegylated interferon and 
ribavirin therapy will approximate the observed SVR12 in NEUTRINO subjects with 
multiple baseline factors traditionally associated with a lower response to interferon-
based treatment (Table 12). The SVR12 rate in the NEUTRINO trial in genotype 1 
subjects with IL28B non-C/C alleles, HCV RNA greater than 800,000 IU/mL and Metavir 
F3/F4 fibrosis was 71% (37/52).  
14.3 Clinical Trials in Subjects with Genotype 2 or 3 HCV 
Treatment-Naïve Adults ─ FISSION (Study 1231) 
FISSION was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that evaluated 12 weeks 
of treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin compared to 24 weeks of treatment with 
peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 2 and 3 
HCV. The ribavirin dosage used in the SOVALDI + ribavirin and peginterferon alfa 2a + 
ribavirin arms were weight-based 1000-1200 mg per day and 800 mg per day 
regardless of weight, respectively. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and stratified 
by cirrhosis (presence vs. absence), HCV genotype (2 vs. 3) and baseline HCV RNA 
level (less than 6 log10 IU/mL vs. at least 6 log10 IU/mL). Subjects with genotype 2 or 3 
HCV were enrolled in an approximately 1:3 ratio. 
Treated subjects (N=499) had a median age of 50 years (range: 19 to 77); 66% of the 
subjects were male; 87% were White, 3% were Black; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; 
 27 
 
mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 17 to 52 kg/m2); 57% had baseline HCV 
RNA levels greater than 6 log10 IU per mL; 20% had cirrhosis; 72% had HCV genotype 
3.  Table 13 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of SOVALDI + ribavirin and 
peginterferon alfa + ribavirin in subjects with genotype 2 HCV. SVR12 for genotype 3 
subjects treated with SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks was suboptimal; therefore these 
results are not presented in Table 13.

Interferon Intolerant, Ineligible or Unwilling Adults ─ POSITRON (Study 107) 
POSITRON was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated 
12 weeks of treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin (N=207) compared to placebo 
(N=71) in subjects who are interferon intolerant, ineligible or unwilling. Subjects were 
randomized in 3:1 ratio and stratified by cirrhosis (presence vs. absence). 
Treated subjects (N=278) had a median age of 54 years (range: 21 to 75); 54% of the 
subjects were male; 91% were White, 5% were Black; 11% were Hispanic or Latino; 
mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 53 kg/m2); 70% had baseline HCV 
 28 
 
RNA levels greater than 6 log10 IU per mL; 16% had cirrhosis; 49% had HCV genotype 
3. The proportions of subjects who were interferon intolerant, ineligible, or unwilling 
were 9%, 44%, and 47%, respectively. Most subjects had no prior HCV treatment 
(81%). Table 15 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of SOVALDI + ribavirin 
and placebo in subjects with genotype 2 HCV. SVR12 for genotype 3 subjects treated 
with SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks was suboptimal; therefore these results are not 
presented in Table 15.

Previously Treated Adults ─ FUSION (Study 108) 
FUSION was a randomized, double-blinded trial that evaluated 12 or 16 weeks of 
treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin in subjects who did not achieve SVR with prior 
interferon-based treatment (relapsers and nonresponders). Subjects were randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by cirrhosis (presence vs. absence) and HCV genotype (2 vs. 
3). 
 29 
 
Treated subjects (N=201) had a median age of 56 years (range: 24 to 70); 70% of the 
subjects were male; 87% were White; 3% were Black; 9% were Hispanic or Latino; 
mean body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (range: 19 to 44 kg/m2); 73% had baseline HCV 
RNA levels greater than 6 log10 IU per mL; 34% had cirrhosis; 63% had HCV genotype 
3; 75% were prior relapsers. Table 17 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of 
SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks in subjects with genotype 2 HCV. Treatment of 
16 weeks in subjects with genotype 2 HCV was not shown to increase the SVR12 
observed with 12 weeks of treatment.  SVR12 for genotype 3 subjects treated with 
SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 or 16 weeks was suboptimal; therefore these results are not 
presented in Table 17.

Treatment-Naïve and Previously Treated Adults ─ VALENCE (Study 133) 
The VALENCE trial evaluated SOVALDI in combination with weight-based ribavirin for 
the treatment of genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection in treatment-naïve subjects or subjects 
 30 
 
who did not achieve SVR with prior interferon-based treatment, including subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis. The original trial design was a 4 to 1 randomization to SOVALDI 
+ ribavirin for 12 weeks or placebo. Based on emerging data, this trial was unblinded 
and all genotype 2 HCV-infected subjects continued the original planned treatment and 
received SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks, and duration of treatment with SOVALDI + 
ribavirin in genotype 3 HCV-infected subjects was extended to 24 weeks. Eleven 
genotype 3 subjects had already completed SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks at the 
time of the amendment.  
Treated subjects (N=419) had a median age of 51 years (range: 19 to 74); 60% of the 
subjects were male; mean body mass index was 26 kg/m2 (range: 17 to 44 kg/m2); the 
mean baseline HCV RNA level was 6.4 log10 IU per mL; 78% had HCV genotype 3; 
58% of the subjects were treatment-experienced and 65% of those subjects 
experienced relapse/breakthrough to prior HCV treatment.

14.4 Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects Coinfected with HCV and HIV-1  
SOVALDI was studied in an open-label clinical trial (Study PHOTON-1) evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin in adult 
subjects with genotype 1, 2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C coinfected with HIV-1. Genotype 2 
and 3 subjects were either HCV treatment-naïve or experienced, whereas genotype 1 
subjects were all treatment-naïve. Subjects received 400 mg SOVALDI and weight-
based ribavirin (1000 mg for subjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg for subjects 
weighing at least 75 kg) daily for 12 or 24 weeks based on genotype and prior treatment 
history. Subjects were either not on antiretroviral therapy with a CD4+ cell count greater 
than 500 cells/mm3 or had virologically suppressed HIV-1 with a CD4+ cell count 
greater than 200 cells/mm3. Efficacy data 12 weeks post treatment are available for 
210 subjects (see Table 21).

 32 
 
In subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection, the SVR12 rate was 82% (74/90) in subjects 
with genotype 1a infection and 54% (13/24) in subjects with genotype 1b infection, with 
relapse accounting for the majority of treatment failures. SVR12 rates in subjects with 
HCV genotype 1 infection were 80% (24/30) in subjects with baseline IL28B C/C allele 
and 75% (62/83) in subjects with baseline IL28B non-C/C alleles. 
In the 223 HCV subjects with HIV-1 coinfection, the percentage of CD4+ cells did not 
change during treatment. Median CD4+ cell count decreases of 85 cells/mm3 and 
84 cells/mm3 were observed at the end of treatment with SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 or 
24 weeks, respectively. HIV-1 rebound during SOVALDI + ribavirin treatment occurred 
in 2 subjects (0.9%) on antiretroviral therapy. 
14.5 Clinical Trial in Pediatrics 
The efficacy of SOVALDI in HCV-infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older 
was evaluated in 50 subjects with HCV genotype 2 (N = 13) or genotype 3 (N = 37) in a 
Phase 2, open label clinical trial. Subjects with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the trial 
were treated with SOVALDI and weight-based ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 
Of the 50 treated subjects, the median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 42% of the 
subjects were female; 90% were White, 4% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 4% were 
Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 61 kg (range: 30 to 101 kg); 18% were treatment 
experienced; 66% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 
IU/mL; 74% of subjects had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); and no subjects had 
known cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (69%) had been infected through vertical 
transmission. 
The SVR12 rate was 100% (13/13) in genotype 2 subjects and 97% (36/37) in genotype 
3 subjects. No subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse.

Patient Information 
SOVALDI® (soh-VAHL-dee) 
(sofosbuvir) 
tablets 
Important: SOVALDI is used in combination with other antiviral medicines. When taking SOVALDI 
with ribavirin or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin you should also read those 
Medication Guides. The information in this Patient Information Leaflet talks about SOVALDI when it is 
used with ribavirin and in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. 
What is the most important information I should know about SOVALDI? 
SOVALDI can cause serious side effects, including: 
• 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Before starting treatment with SOVALDI, your healthcare provider 
will do blood tests to check for hepatitis B virus infection. If you have ever had hepatitis B virus 
infection, the hepatitis B virus could become active again during or after treatment of hepatitis C virus 
with SOVALDI. Hepatitis B virus becoming active again (called reactivation) may cause serious liver 
problems including liver failure and death. Your healthcare provider will monitor you if you are at risk 
for hepatitis B virus reactivation during treatment and after you stop taking SOVALDI. 
For more information about side effects, see the section “What are the possible side effects of 
SOVALDI?” 
What is SOVALDI?  
SOVALDI is a prescription medicine used with other antiviral medicines to treat adults with chronic 
(lasting a long time) hepatitis C virus (HCV): 
• 
genotype 1  or 4 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in combination with 
peginterferon alfa and ribavirin 
• 
genotype 2 or 3 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in combination with 
ribavirin 
SOVALDI is used to treat children 12 years of age and older or weighing at least 77 pounds (at least 35 
kg) with chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in 
combination with ribavirin. 
It is not known if SOVALDI is safe and effective in children under 12 years of age and weighing less than 
77 pounds (less than 35 kg) with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection, or with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. 
It is not known if SOVALDI is safe and effective in people who have had a liver transplant. 
Before taking SOVALDI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, 
including if you:  
• 
have ever had hepatitis B virus infection 
• 
have liver problems other than hepatitis C infection 
• 
have had a liver transplant 
• 
have severe kidney problems or you are on dialysis 
• 
have HIV infection 
• 
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.  It is not known if SOVALDI will harm your unborn 
baby. 
• 
Males and females who take SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin should also 
read the ribavirin Medication Guide for important pregnancy, contraception, and 
infertility information. 
• 
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if SOVALDI passes into your breast milk. 
Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with 
SOVALDI. 
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-
counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. SOVALDI and other medicines may affect each 
other. This can cause you to have too much or not enough SOVALDI or other medicines in your body. 
This may affect the way SOVALDI or your other medicines work, or may cause side effects.  
Keep a list of your medicines to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist. 
 36 
 
• 
You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with 
SOVALDI. 
• 
Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your healthcare provider. Your healthcare 
provider can tell you if it is safe to take SOVALDI with other medicines. 
How should I take SOVALDI?  
• 
Take SOVALDI exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it. Do not change your dose 
unless your healthcare provider tells you to. 
•

emergency room right away. 
What are the possible side effects of SOVALDI? 
SOVALDI can cause serious side effects, including: 
• 
Hepatitis B virus reactivation. See “What is the most important information I should know about 
SOVALDI?” 
• 
Slow heart rate (bradycardia). SOVALDI treatment may result in slowing of the heart rate along 
with other symptoms when taken with amiodarone (Cordarone®, Nexterone®, Pacerone®), a 
medicine used to treat certain heart problems. In some cases bradycardia has led to death or the 
need for a heart pacemaker when amiodarone is taken with SOVALDI. Get medical help right 
away if you take amiodarone with SOVALDI and get any of the following symptoms: 
• 
fainting or near-fainting 
•
