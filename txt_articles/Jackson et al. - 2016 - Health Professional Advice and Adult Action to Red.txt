Abstract
Introduction—Excessive sodium intake is a key modifiable risk factor for hypertension and 
cardiovascular disease. Although 95% of U.S. adults exceed intake recommendations, knowledge 
is limited regarding whether doctor or health professional advice motivates patients to reduce 
intake. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence and determinants of taking action to reduce 
sodium, and to test whether receiving advice was associated with action.
Methods—Analyses, conducted in 2014, used data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System, a state-based telephone survey representative of non-institutionalized adults. 
Respondents (n=173,778) from 26 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used the new 
optional sodium module. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) based on average marginal 
predictions, accounting for the complex survey design.
Results—Fifty-three percent of adults reported taking action to reduce sodium intake. Prevalence 
of action was highest among adults who received advice (83%), followed by adults taking 
antihypertensive medications, adults with diabetes, adults with kidney disease, or adults with a 
history of cardiovascular disease (range, 73%–75%), and lowest among adults aged 18–24 years 
(29%). Overall, 23% of adults reported receiving advice to reduce sodium intake. Receiving 
advice was associated with taking action (prevalence ratio=1.59; 95% CI=1.56, 1.61), independent 
of sociodemographic and health characteristics, although some disparities were observed across 
race/ethnicity and BMI categories.
Conclusions—Our results suggest that more than half of U.S. adults in 26 states and two 
territories are taking action to reduce sodium intake, and doctor or health professional advice is 
strongly associated with action.

 Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) results in nearly 800,000 deaths each year in the U.S.,1 and 
elevated blood pressure is a major risk factor for CVD.2 Sodium intake reduction is a key 
strategy for lowering blood pressure,3 with an estimated 9.5% of deaths from CVD 
worldwide attributable to excess sodium intake.4 Given that about 95% of U.S. adults exceed 
sodium intake guidelines,5 current recommendations encourage healthcare providers to 
counsel all patients with and without hypertension regarding sodium reduction.6 Although 
data exist on health professional advice given to hypertensive patients to reduce sodium 
intake,5,6 few studies have examined medical advice given to all patients to reduce sodium 
intake and the association of this advice with taking action.
One previous study reported that 24% of U.S. adults received doctor or other health 
professional advice to cut down on dietary sodium; the likelihood of receiving advice varied 
by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household income.7 Of those who received medical advice, 
87% reported taking action to cut down on sodium. This study was based on a consumer 
market panel, and did not provide data on the prevalence of taking action among the total 
sample or among those who did not receive advice. Thus, it is unclear whether health 
professional behavior influenced patient action to reduce sodium intake.
Data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System’s (BRFSS’s) new Sodium 
or Salt-Related Behavior optional module allowed us to examine doctor or other health 
professional advice and self-reported action to reduce sodium intake in a multistate, 
representative, probability-based sample. The main objectives of these analyses were to 
determine the prevalence and determinants of action to reduce sodium intake among U.S. 
adults and to investigate the association between receiving advice and taking action.
Methods
Study Population
We used data from the 2013 BRFSS survey, a state-based survey that uses a stratified 
multistage probability sampling design to produce a sample representative of the non-
institutionalized population aged ≥18 years of each state. A subset of 26 states (Arkansas, 
Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin), the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico implemented a new optional sodium-
related behavior module. For these areas, the median response rate, defined as the number of 
complete and partial interviews divided by an estimate of the number of eligible units in the 
sample, was 48.1%, with a range of 31.1%–60.3%.8 The median cooperation rate (the 
number of complete and partial interviews divided by the number of contacted, eligible 
respondents) was 66.9%, with a range of 51.8%–75.9% (American Association of Public 
Opinion Research, www.aapor.org/AAPORKentico/default.aspx). BRFSS uses a 
sophisticated weighting methodology to improve representation based on sex, age, race/
ethnicity, county, region, telephone service (landline, cell phone, or both), tenure (renting or 
owning a home), marital status, and education.9

 Unlike in previous years in which sodium-related questions were asked only of BRFSS 
respondents with self-reported hypertension, the new 2013 sodium questions were asked of 
all respondents in participating states. Of 187,426 participants offered the sodium module, 
we excluded 13,648 with missing data (7.3%), leaving 173,778 participants.
Measures
We examined self-reported action to reduce sodium intake (Are you currently watching or 
reducing your sodium or salt intake?) as our primary outcome of interest. In addition, we 
calculated duration of action to reduce sodium intake among those who reported taking 
action (Appendix, available online). Our primary exposure of interest was doctor or health 
professional advice to reduce sodium intake.10 During survey development, BRFSS 
conducted three rounds of cognitive testing to modify and improve these questions.
Participant characteristics potentially associated with sodium-related behavior or reported 
advice were sex; age; race/ethnicity; education; having a healthcare provider considered a 
“personal doctor” (none, one, or more than one); self-reported hypertension (no 
hypertension, hypertension without medications, or hypertension with medications), 
diabetes, or kidney disease; CVD history (including heart attack, coronary artery disease or 
angina, or stroke); and BMI category.10 Household income also is potentially associated 
with sodium-related behavior or medical advice, and we reported categories of household 
income in the descriptive results in Table 1. However, many respondents were missing 
income data (14%). Removing income from the regression model did not lessen the amount 
of variation in outcome explained by the model or affect relationships in the model (no 
confounding or interaction). Thus, we chose not to include household income in further 
analyses.
Statistical Analysis
We examined characteristics of people taking action to reduce sodium intake and of those 
reporting advice. We used multiple logistic regression to examine which characteristics were 
significantly associated with reported action or advice to reduce sodium. We also used 
multiple logistic regression to assess the association between reported advice and action to 
reduce sodium, and assessed interactions to determine whether this association differed 
among subgroups. In all models, we estimated model-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) on 
average marginal predictions.11 Because of the large sample size, small differences in 
behaviors were likely to be statistically significant. For this reason, in addition to calculating 
statistical significance, we set a meaningful difference level of PR <0.80 or >1.25. All 
analyses, conducted in 2014, used SAS, version 9.3 and SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 11, 
with sampling weights to account for the complex survey design.
Results
In this population, sampled from non-institutionalized U.S. adults in 26 states, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 53% of adults reported taking action (i.e., currently watching or 
reducing their sodium or salt intake in 2013) (Table 1). The prevalence of taking action was 
highest among adults who reported receiving advice (83%), followed by adults taking

 antihypertensive medications (75%), with a history of CVD (75%), with diabetes (74%), or 
with kidney disease (73%), and lowest among adults aged 18–24 years (29%). Among 
individuals who reported taking action to reduce sodium, the majority reported undertaking 
this behavior for at least 1 year (Table 2), and 40% reported ≥10 years. Older respondents 
reported a longer duration of taking action to reduce sodium, with more than half of the 
oldest respondents (aged ≥65 years) reporting watching or reducing sodium intake for ≥10 
years. In sensitivity analyses, the association between age and duration of action remained 
significant after adjusting for hypertension status, diabetes, and kidney disease.
Compared with those who did not report receiving advice, those who did were 1.59 times 
(95% CI=1.56, 1.61) as likely to take action to reduce sodium intake, after adjusting for 
sociodemographic and health characteristics (Table 3). Relative differences in the prevalence 
of action did not meet our criteria for meaningful differences (PR<0.80 or >1.25) for nearly 
all examined characteristics except for age and race/ethnicity, indicating that few 
characteristics were independently associated with a meaningful difference in prevalence of 
taking action to reduce sodium intake. Compared with adults aged 18–24 years, adults in 
older age groups were statistically more likely to report taking action; PR point estimates 
exceeded 1.25 for those aged 24–44 years (PR=1.27, 95% CI=1.21, 1.34), 45–64 years 
(PR=1.54, 95% CI=1.47, 1.61), and ≥65 years (PR=1.70, 95% CI=1.62, 1.78). Compared 
with non-Hispanic whites, adults in minority groups also were statistically more likely to 
report taking action to reduce sodium, with PRs exceeding 1.25 for non-Hispanic blacks 
(PR=1.35, 95% CI=1.31, 1.48) and Hispanics (PR=1.31, 95% CI=1.27, 1.34).
The relationship between receiving advice and taking action to reduce sodium intake was 
stronger among some groups compared with others (Table 4). Yet, among all subgroups, the 
PRs exceeded 1.25 for taking action to reduce sodium intake among those who received 
advice compared to those who did not. The association varied most by race/ethnicity (e.g., 
PR=1.27 [95% CI=1.21, 1.32] among Hispanics and PR 1.74 [95% CI=1.71, 1.78] among 
non-Hispanic whites).
Overall, 23% of adults reported that their doctor or another health professional had advised 
them to reduce sodium intake (Table 1). By contrast, more than half of adults with 
cardiovascular conditions reported receiving advice, including 56% of those with kidney 
disease, 54% of those with a history of CVD, 53% of those on antihypertensive medications, 
and 51% of those with diabetes. Adults aged 18–24 years were least likely (7%) to report 
advice to reduce sodium intake. Interestingly, some respondents (13%) who did not have a 
personal doctor reported receiving advice. These respondents may have received advice 
from a physician or other health care professional who they did not consider to be a personal 
doctor, or at a prior time when they did have a personal doctor.
After adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics (Table 3), the relative 
differences in the prevalence of advice to reduce sodium intake were statistically significant 
for most examined characteristics. The largest relative differences were for hypertensive 
status: compared with adults without hypertension, adults with hypertension who were not 
taking antihypertensive medications were 2.61 (95% CI=2.46, 2.77) times as likely to report 
receiving advice to reduce sodium or salt intake, and adults on antihypertensive medications

 were 3.55 times as likely (95% CI=3.38, 3.67). Controlling for hypertensive status and all 
other examined characteristics, Hispanics (PR=1.74 versus non-Hispanic whites, 95% 
CI=1.67, 1.81), non-Hispanic blacks (PR=1.49 versus non-Hispanic whites, 95% CI=1.42, 
1.55), those aged 45–64 years (PR=1.57 versus those aged 18–24 years, 95% CI=1.41, 1.74), 
and those aged ≥65 years (PR=1.54 versus those aged 18–24 years, 95% CI=1.39, 1.72) 
were more likely to receive advice. In relation to health characteristics, PRs for receiving 
advice were 1.52 among participants reporting a history of CVD, 1.46 among those 
reporting kidney disease, and 1.36 among those reporting being obese versus normal weight.
Discussion
Our study is the first to provide data on sodium reduction behaviors among a general 
population probability sample of adults living in multiple states and territories. A little over 
half (53%) of surveyed adults reported watching or reducing their sodium intake in 2013. A 
substantial proportion of those taking action did so within the last 3 years. About one in four 
adults reported receiving doctor or health professional advice to reduce sodium intake, and 
the association between receiving advice and taking action was positive and significant 
across all examined subgroups. These findings suggest a greater proportion of adults might 
watch or reduce their sodium intake if more health professionals provided sodium reduction 
advice.
Our finding that more than half of respondents were taking action to reduce sodium is 
consistent with previous reports of consumer interest in reducing sodium intake. For 
example, in a 2013 American Heart Association online survey, 58% of 1,000 surveyed U.S. 
adults reported they had tried to reduce the amount of sodium in their diets.12 In a 2011 
International Food Information Council web survey, 42% of U.S. adults reported currently 
trying to limit sodium intake.13 This proportion may be lower than the 53% observed in the 
present study because the BRFSS question was worded as “watching or reducing” sodium 
intake, which may be more broadly interpreted. In another online survey, 78% of 
respondents reported they had taken at least one of six specified actions to limit sodium 
consumption,14 although it may be that prompting with examples increased positive 
responses,15 or that participants responding to an online survey about nutrition may be 
interested in nutrition-related issues, introducing selection bias.16
Self-reported action to watch or reduce sodium intake does not necessarily reflect 
achievement of sodium reduction. One analysis of hypertensive adults showed that average 
sodium intake was 259 mg lower among those who reported taking action to reduce sodium 
versus those not taking action; however, this difference was not statistically significant.17 
Although that study may have been underpowered, its modest findings may reflect the 
substantial difficulty faced by U.S. consumers attempting to reduce sodium intake, given that 
processed and restaurant foods account for >75% of sodium intake.18 The difficulty in 
reducing sodium intake through individual behavioral change supports the involvement of 
the food industry in responding to consumer desires and facilitating efforts to reduce 
sodium.19

 Over the past four decades, various public health campaigns have not significantly reduced 
U.S. sodium intake.20 Evaluation of new programs requires surveillance of readiness to 
change sodium intake over time. Although 2013 saw the first implementation of the BRFSS 
sodium module, the question pertaining to duration of behavior change may offer some 
initial insight. New strategies to reduce sodium were issued in 2010,19 and it is noteworthy 
that more than one third of those taking action to reduce sodium in 2013 reported initiating 
this behavior within the previous 3 years. However, repeated monitoring would be necessary 
to detect changes in behavior over time.
The proportion of adults who reported receiving advice in this study is consistent with a 
panel survey of healthcare providers in 2010, among whom 23% reported counseling all 
adults to consume less salt.21 Extending this finding, our study suggests that the majority of 
adults with hypertension who are not treated with medication also do not receive advice to 
reduce sodium intake. Although previous research indicates that healthcare providers report 
counseling 74% of hypertensive patients and 65% of patients with chronic kidney disease to 
reduce sodium,21 the current study suggests a smaller portion of adults with cardiovascular 
conditions recall receiving this advice. In the present study, PRs for diabetes, kidney disease, 
and history of CVD were attenuated after adjustment for hypertension, suggesting that 
advice to patients with these conditions is not totally independent of their hypertensive 
status. Healthcare professionals face many competing demands during patient encounters, 
and may refrain from recommending sodium reduction because of insufficient training in 
nutrition22; controversy surrounding ideal sodium targets23–25; pressure to reduce office visit 
times and lack of financial incentive for educational counseling26; or focus on other 
behavioral counseling strategies, such as weight reduction, exercise, or smoking cessation 
among high-risk patients.27
Doctors and other health professionals may doubt whether recommendations to reduce 
sodium will affect behavior, as patients often do not comply with provider advice regarding 
lifestyle changes for the prevention and management of chronic disease.28 Our finding that 
reported advice is significantly and positively associated with action to reduce sodium is 
promising. In addition, our results remained robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded 
Puerto Rico, which had the highest hypertension prevalence of any state or territory (42%), 
as well as the highest prevalence of receiving advice (42%) and taking action (74%).
The weaker association between advice and action in racial/ethnic minorities and among 
overweight and obese participants was not examined previously. Potential explanations may 
be language or cultural barriers impairing the physician–patient relationship,29,30 or possible 
stereotyping, bias, or reduced rapport in the relationships of minorities or overweight and 
obese people with healthcare professionals.31–35 However, it is important to note that 
evidence of interaction by race/ethnicity and BMI category may be partly statistical because 
of higher baseline prevalence of action among some subgroups. Across all groups, receiving 
advice was associated with 18–39 percentage points greater prevalence of action and, among 
those reporting advice to reduce sodium, ≥74% of respondents took action regardless of 
race/ethnicity or BMI subgroup.

 Limitations
Self-reported data are subject to recall bias, and it may be that adults who are taking action 
to reduce sodium may be more likely to recall doctor or other healthcare professional advice, 
whereas individuals not taking action may be more likely to forget they received advice. 
Also, social desirability bias may have influenced our results if respondents felt social 
pressure to claim that they were taking action. In addition, the survey data may be subject to 
response bias, as the median response and cooperation rates were only 48.1% and 66.9%, 
respectively. Those who responded may have differed from those who did not, such as 
under-representation of racial/ethnic minorities.36 However, sample weights were adjusted 
for nonresponse. Another limitation of our study is that we do not know what actions were 
being taken among those who reported action. Cognitive testing indicated that a positive 
response captured a range of behavior, from heightened awareness to selection of low-
sodium products or use of less salt in cooking or at the table. Lastly, these results are 
representative of the 28 states and territories that opted to use the 2013 sodium module 
(which make up 39% of the total U.S. population), and may not be generalizable to the 
entire population. Examining Census estimates of the 2013 U.S. non-institutionalized adult 
population, our weighted results matched the U.S. sex distribution (51% female, 49% male), 
but minorities were slightly under-represented (74% non-Hispanic white versus 66% in the 
total U.S. population). Owing to the inclusion of Puerto Rico in this analysis, results for 
Hispanics are likely to include more Puerto Ricans than other Hispanic subgroups, compared 
with the general U.S. population. However, the prevalence of self-reported hypertension 
among BRFSS respondents in states that used the optional sodium module was comparable 
to the prevalence in nonparticipating states (median, 32% versus 31%, respectively).
Given sharply rising healthcare costs37 and an aging population facing an unprecedented 
burden of CVD,38 new strategies for prevention are urgently needed. Sodium reduction is 
one such strategy: a population-wide reduction in average sodium intake to 2,300 mg daily 
has been projected to reduce the U.S. prevalence of hypertension by 15% and save $18 
billion in annual healthcare spending.39 Sodium reduction is a key target of the U.S. 
DHHS’s Million Hearts initiative, which aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes 
by 2017.40
Conclusions
Our data suggest that advice from doctors and other health professionals can make a positive 
difference in patients’ efforts to reduce sodium. These professionals can recommend that 
patients follow a healthy dietary pattern—such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension— as an effective strategy to reduce sodium intake.41 They also can support 
environmental strategies such as the IOM’s recommendations to set phased targets for 
sodium content of commercially processed foods and for food procurement guidelines.19 It 
is remarkable that more than half of surveyed adults are currently attempting to reduce their 
sodium intake; health professionals, the public health community, and food industry partners 
should support consumer and population efforts to reduce sodium intake.
