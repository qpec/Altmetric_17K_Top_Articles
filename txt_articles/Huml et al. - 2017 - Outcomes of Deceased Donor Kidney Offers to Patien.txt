Abstract
Background and objectives Transplant centers may accept or refuse deceased-donor kidneys that are offered to
their patients at the top of the waiting list. We sought to determine the outcomes of deceased-donor kidney offers
and their association with characteristics of waitlisted patients and organ donors.
Design,setting,participants,&measurementsWe examinedall7milliondeceased-donoradultkidneyoffersinthe
United States from 2007 to 2012 that led to eventual transplantation. Data were obtained from the national organ
allocation system through the United Network of Organ Sharing. The study cohort consisted of 178,625 patients
waitlisted for a deceased-donor kidney transplant and 31,230 deceased donors. We evaluated offers made to
waitlisted patients and their outcomes (transplantation or specific reason for refusal).
ResultsDeceased-donorkidneyswereofferedamedianofseventimesbeforebeingacceptedfortransplantation.
The most common reasons for refusal of an offer were donor-related factors, e.g., age or organ quality (3.2
million offers, 45.0%), and transplant center bypass, e.g., minimal acceptance criteria not met (3.2 million offers,
44.0%). After adjustment for characteristics of waitlisted patients, organ donors, and transplant centers,
male (oddsratio[OR],0.93;95%confidenceinterval[95%CI],0.91to0.95) andHispanic(OR,0.96;95%CI,0.93to
0.99) waitlisted patients were less likely to have an offer accepted than female and white patients, respectively.
The likelihood of offer acceptance varied greatly across transplant centers (interquartile ratio, 2.28).
Conclusions Transplant centers frequently refuse deceased-donor kidneys. Such refusals differ by patient and
donor characteristics, may contribute to disparities in access to transplantation, and vary greatly across transplant
centers.

Introduction
About 600,000 Americans have ESRD and require
chronic dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant
to survive (1). Compared with chronic dialysis, kidney
transplantation results in better survival and quality of
life and lower health care costs (2). Despite Medicare
financing of virtually all kidney transplants, there are
sizeable race, sex, and socioeconomic disparities in
access to kidney transplantation (3–9).
About two-thirds of kidney transplants come from
deceased-donor organs. Patients awaiting a deceased-
donor organ are placed on a national waiting list and
typically wait several years to receive a transplant
(10). When a deceased-donor kidney becomes
available, a match run list is generated that ranks
patients in priority order on the basis of a combination
of immunologic criteria and waiting time. A trans-
plant center may accept or refuse a deceased-donor
kidney that is offered to its patient at the top of the
match run list. If refused, the kidney is then offered to
the next patient on the match run list. The results of
such offers are cataloged as part of a national
electronic allocation system. We sought to determine
the outcomes of deceased-donor kidney offers and
their association with characteristics of waitlisted
patients and organ donors. We hypothesized that
there are differences in offer acceptance rates due to
donor and waitlisted patient characteristics for
deceased-donor kidney offers for patients at the top
of the waiting list.
Materials and Methods
Data
We obtained data from the United Network for
Organ Sharing (UNOS) on all offers involving
deceased-donor kidneys in the United States that
led to a transplant from May of 2007 to July of 2012.
Each offer is defined as a single match between a
donor and potential kidney transplant recipient on a
match run list that occurs when a donor organ becomes
available. Transplant centers may accept offers (result-
ing in transplantation) or refuse offers (for a specific
reason). UNOS categorizes 37 different reasons for refus-
al into the following six categories: donor-related refusal,
transplant center bypassed for prespecified criteria,
recipient-related refusal, histocompatibility-related
refusal, program-related refusal, and other reason

 for refusal. We also obtained demographic and medical
characteristics of all waitlisted patients and organ donors
involved in these offers. Waitlisted patient characteristics
included age, race/ethnicity, sex, cause of ESRD, body
mass index, and panel of reactive antibodies. Donor
characteristics included age, race/ethnicity, sex, terminal
creatinine, presence of hypertension or diabetes, whether
the cause of death was a cerebrovascular accident, and
status of donation after cardiac death. Donor creatinine
and medical conditions were included because they are
commonly used as markers of donor organ quality (11,12).
Because reasons for refusal may vary as the number of
offers for a particular donor increases, we also analyzed
number of offers as a predictor for transplantation.
Number of offers was entered as quintiles to allow de-
tection of nonlinear relationships. Transplant center char-
acteristics included transplant volume, proportion of
minority patients that were waitlisted, and number of
living-donor kidney transplants at each center. The Scien-
tific Registry of Transplant Recipients’ annual program
specific reports were used to determine the number of
living donors per year for each center. Each offer up to and
including the offer that resulted in transplantation was
included in the data. We excluded kidney transplants that
involved children as recipients or that were part of multi-
organ transplants. This study was approved by the in-
stitutional review board of MetroHealth Medical Center,
Cleveland, Ohio. The clinical and research activities being
reported are consistent with the Principles of the Decla-
ration of Istanbul as outlined in the Declaration of Istanbul
on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism.
This study used data from the Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN). The OPTN data system
includes data on all donors, waitlisted candidates, and
transplant recipients in the United States, submitted by the
members of the OPTN. The Health Resources and Services
Administration, US Department of Health and Human
Services provides oversight to the activities of the OPTN
contractor.
Statistical Analyses
With offers as the unit of analysis, we used the chi-
squared test to compare waitlisted patient and donor
characteristics with each offer outcome (transplantation
or six categories of reasons for refusal). We then developed
separate logistic regression models to determine the in-
dependent relationship between each offer outcome and
waitlisted patient and donor characteristics. We used a
generalized estimating equations approach (with an in-
dependence working correlation structure) to obtain var-
iance estimates accounting for clustering of repeated offers
to multiple waitlisted patients from the same donor. We
performed generalized score tests to assess the overall
effect of each predictor variable on offer outcomes. A
multivariate interaction model was used to determine the
relationship between waitlisted patient age, ethnicity, and
sex with donor characteristics for transplantation (see
Supplemental Table 1). We analyzed 7,137,831 offers after
waitlisted patients (n=19,255) or donors (n=1059) with
incomplete data were omitted from the analysis. We
performed a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation
of missing variables that found nearly identical results.
Finally, we calculated standardized ratios (analogous to
standardized mortality ratios) to examine transplant cen-
ter–related variability in offer outcomes after adjustment
for differences in waitlisted patient and donor character-
istics. We summed the expected probabilities of offer
outcomes across all patients at each transplant center using
the logistic regression models. This expected number takes
into account the demographic and medical characteristics
of waitlisted patients and donors. We then calculated the
standardized ratio as the sum of the actual number of
patients with each offer outcome divided by the sum of the
expected number of patients with the particular offer
outcome for each transplant center (13–15). Statistical
analyses were conducted using JMP version 12.1.0 and
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 average age was 51 years, and nearly one-third had
diabetes as the cause of ESRD. A majority of donors
were also white (68%) and men (60%). Their average age
was 38 years, and about one-fourth had hypertension.
These waitlisted patients and donors were involved in a
total of 7 million deceased-donor kidney offers between
May of 2007 and July of 2012. Of all offers, 49,000 (0.7%)
resulted in a transplant. The median number of offers
before transplantation was 7 (interquartile range, 2–73).
The most common reasons for refusal of an offer were
donor-related factors, e.g., age or organ quality (3.2 million
offers, 45.0%) and transplant center bypass, e.g., minimal
acceptance criteria not met (3.2 million offers, 44.0%). Less
frequent reasons for offer refusal were due to recipient-
related, histocompatibility-related, and program-related
reasons (Table 2).
On univariate analysis, several waitlisted patient and
donor characteristics were associated with outcomes of
kidney offers (Table 3). For example, offers to non-White
waitlisted patients were less likely to lead to transplanta-
tion compared with offers to white patients (0.7% for black
and 0.5% for Hispanic patients versus 0.8% for white
patients, P,0.001). Offers to black waitlisted patients were
refused more often for histocompatibility reasons com-
pared with offers to white patients (1.6% versus 1.3%,
P,0.001). Offers from donors with a terminal creatinine
.1.5 mg/dl were refused more often for donor-related
reasons compared with offers from donors with a terminal
creatinine ,1.0 mg/dl (55.4% versus 42.4%, P,0.001).
Likewise, offers from donors with hypertension, diabetes,
and after cardiac death were more likely refused for donor-
related reasons (53.8% versus 40.7%, 59.8% versus 43.5%,
and 54.4% versus 43.8%).
On multivariate analysis, several waitlisted patient and
donor characteristics were also associated with outcomes of
kidney offers (Table 4). For example, offers to Hispanic
waitlisted patients were less likely to lead to transplanta-
tion compared with offers to white patients (odds ratio
[OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.93 to 0.99).
Offers to male waitlisted patients were less likely to lead to
transplantation than offers to female patients (OR, 0.93;
95% CI, 0.91 to 0.95). Waitlisted patients with diabetes as
the cause of their ESRD were less likely to be transplanted
(OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.93) and those with a high body
mass index ($30 kg/m2) were also less likely to be
transplanted (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.87). Waitlisted
patients with high panel reactive antibodies are more
likely to be transplanted (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.33 to 2.53).
Offers to older patients were less likely to be refused for a
histocompatibility-related reason. As in the univariate
analysis, offers from donors with a terminal creatinine
.1.5 mg/dl, hypertension, diabetes, or cardiac death were
less likely to lead to transplantation and more likely to be
refused for a donor-related reason. Compared with organs
offered many times (highest quintile), donor organs offered
fewer times are twice as likely to be accepted for transplant
(OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.67 to 2.35). Reasons for refusal of
organs with fewer numbers of offers were recipient- (OR,
1.75; 95% CI, 1.61 to 1.90) and histocompatibility-related
(OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 2.36 to 2.78). Offers to transplant centers
with more minority patients (percentage of black patients
and Hispanic patients waitlisted) on the waiting list were

 less likely to be accepted for transplant (OR, 0.83; 95% CI,
0.82 to 0.84, per 10% increase in number of black patients
waitlisted; and OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.82, per 10%
increase in the number of Hispanic waitlisted patients).
Offers to transplant centers with higher volumes were more
likely to be accepted for transplant (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.10 to
1.11, per 100 transplants). The number of living-donor kidney
transplants did not affect likelihood of offer acceptance. The
outcomes of offers varied greatly across transplant centers
after adjustment for the characteristics of waitlisted patients
and organ donors (Figure 1). The likelihood of offer accep-
tance varied across transplant centers (interquartile ratio,
2.28). Refusal of offers due to recipient-, histocompatibility-,
and program-related reasons also showed marked variation
across transplant centers.
Discussion
We found that deceased-donor kidneys are typically
offered and declined many times before being accepted for
transplantation. Such refusals differ by patient and donor
characteristics and may contribute to racial and ethnic
disparities in access to transplantation. We (and other
researchers) define disparities as racial or sex differences
that are not explained by clinical or biologic factors. Offers
to Hispanic patients were less likely to lead to trans-
plantation and more likely to be refused for transplant
center bypass. Offers to male patients were less likely to
lead to transplantation and more likely to be refused for
donor-related reasons. Moreover, both the acceptance of
offers and specific reasons for declining offers vary greatly
across transplant centers. Strengths of this study include a

 large sample size and the availability of uniformly collected
data on demographic and medical characteristics. Many
observations may be statistically significant simply because
of the large sample size; therefore, it is important to focus
on associations with large effect sizes.
Several previous studies have examined placement on
the deceased-donor waiting list or transplantation after
being placed on the waiting list. Those studies have found
that lower rates of kidney transplantation are associated
with black race, Hispanic ethnicity, female sex, low
socioeconomic status, rural geographic location, and spe-
cific dialysis facilities (3–8,16,17). Only one previous study
examined the process of accepting or refusing kidneys
for patients at the top of the waiting list. That study fo-
cused on transplants involving 4967 kidneys but excluded
another 4051 kidneys that were suboptimal or were refused
multiple times. As a result, its findings may not be
generalizable to all kidney offers. Moreover, that study
did not examine correlates of specific reasons for offer
refusal (18).
Our findings on differences in organ acceptance may be
due to clinical appropriateness, biologic factors, or sub-
conscious biases. For example, black patients are more
likely to be highly sensitized, i.e., to have exceptionally high
antibody levels that might react to a donor kidney. As a
result, it would be clinically inappropriate to proceed
with a transplant if there is a positive cross-match test when
recipient and donor blood cells are mixed together (19).
This is supported by our finding that black patients are
more likely to have histocompatibility-related refusals.
Similarly, younger waitlisted patients (who may have a
more robust immune system) and women (who are
exposed to fetal antigens during pregnancy) were more
likely to have histocompatibility-related refusals. An ex-
ample of a biologic factor is a mismatch in body size
between a small donor and larger recipient. This may lead
to insufficient nephrons for adequate renal function and
could be a reason for declining an offer (20–22). Not
unexpectedly, certain donor characteristics including
higher creatinine, or history of hypertension, diabetes, or
cardiac death, were associated with donor-related refusals.
Subconscious biases have been examined in other health
care areas but our data do not directly address this
possibility (23,24).
Our results have implications for patients, providers,
researchers, and policy makers. Waitlisted patients should
be aware of how the offer process works and may consider
selecting transplant centers on the basis of their acceptance
practices. Providers should accurately categorize reasons
for refusal and determine if the categories need to be
revised. They should also monitor refusals of offers, both
among all waitlisted patients and among specific sub-
groups. Our results will allow transplant providers to
compare their rates of and reasons for offer refusal with
national rates and reasons. Researchers should study the
effect of the offer process on short- and long-term outcomes
of kidney transplantation. Policy makers may be able to
develop performance metrics to assess the offer process and
disseminate best practices to providers at centers with
lower acceptance rates (18).
Several limitations must be considered in interpr-
eting our findings. We did not independently validate
the reasons for offer refusal. Nevertheless, the findings
reflect providers’ stated reasons for refusing organ offers as
reported to the national electronic allocation system. The
data source did not separate ethnicity and race, so His-
panics are categorized as a distinct racial/ethnic group. We
did not have information on some variables of interest that
may influence offer acceptance, such as cold ischemia time.
Individual physicians make decisions about accepting or
refusing deceased-donor offers but our data only links
patients to transplant centers. As a result, we were unable
to examine variability in acceptance practices across phy-
sicians. Furthermore, data about prespecified, unaccept-
able organ criteria that may be entered into the electronic
allocation system whereby centers forego offers for their
entire match run list likely vary by center, but were not
available. In 2014, movement of patients on the waiting list
was changed to better account for expected post-transplant
survival and time since onset of ESRD (25). Although these
changes will affect which patients are at the top of the
waiting list, they are unlikely to alter how transplant
centers accept or refuse kidney offers. Finally, it is worth
noting that patients’ relative positions on the deceased-
donor waiting list are not fixed. Instead, their positions are
reordered as each new kidney becomes available. In
conclusion, transplant centers frequently refuse deceased-
donor kidneys. Such refusals differ by patient and donor
characteristics, may contribute to disparities in access to
transplantation, and vary greatly across transplant centers.
Further work is needed to better understand and improve
the offer process to maximize the efficiency and equity of
organ allocation.
