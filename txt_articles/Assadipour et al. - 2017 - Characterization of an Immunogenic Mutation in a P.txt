Abstract
Purpose: The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) can mediate durable tumor regressions in
patients with melanoma likely based on the recognition of
immunogenic somatic mutations expressed by the cancer. There
are limited data regarding the immunogenicity of mutations in
breast cancer. We sought to identify immunogenic nonsynon-
ymous mutations in a patient with triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) to identify and isolate mutation-reactive TILs for possible
use in adoptive cell transfer.
Experimental Design: A TNBC metastasis was resected for
TIL generation and whole-exome sequencing. Tandem mini-
genes or long 25-mer peptides encoding selected mutations
were electroporated or pulsed onto autologous antigen-pre-
senting cells, and reactivity of TIL was screened by upregula-
tion of CD137 and IFNg ELISPOT. The nature of the T-cell
response against a unique nonsynonymous mutation was
characterized.
Results: We identified 72 nonsynonymous mutations from the
tumor of a patient with TNBC. CD4þ and HLA-DRB1
�1501–
restricted TILs isolated from this tumor recognized a single muta-
tion in RBPJ (recombination signal binding protein for immuno-
globulin kappa J region). Analysis of 16 metastatic sites revealed
that the mutation was ubiquitously present in all samples.
Conclusions: Breast cancers can express naturally processed
and presented unique nonsynonymous mutations that are
recognized by a patient's immune system. TILs recognizing
these immunogenic mutations can be isolated from a patient's
tumor, suggesting that adoptive cell transfer of mutation-reac-
tive TILs could be a viable treatment option for patients with
breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4347–53. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating lympho-
cytes (TILs) has been shown to mediate durable complete
responses in patients with metastatic melanoma (1, 2). Recent
evidence suggests that tumor regression is mediated by T-cell
recognition of unique mutated tumor antigens in melanoma
(3–5). Epithelial solid cancers, which make up the vast majority
of human malignancies, have far fewer somatic mutations com-
pared with melanoma, and therefore, potentially fewer immu-
nogenic mutations (6). Nine of 10 patients with a variety of
gastrointestinal cancers were found to have one to three muta-
tions that gave rise to mutation-reactive T cells. In one patient with
cholangiocarcinoma, 26 mutations were identified, one of which,
mutated ERBB2IP, generated a CD4þ T-cell response capable of
mediating an objective tumor response (7, 8). These data dem-
onstrate that a CD4þ T-cell response directed against a single
mutated antigen is sufficient to mediate an objective tumor
regression.
In the United States, one in eight women will develop
invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. Triple-negative breast
cancers (TNBCs) are the most aggressive subtype, with higher
recurrence, distant metastases, and decreased survival (9).
Although TILs have been identified in breast adenocarcinomas
by IHC and found to correlate with patient prognosis, little is
known about their reactivity or function within the tumor (10,
11). We aim to identify immunogenic mutations in patients
with metastatic breast cancer with the ultimate goal of devel-
oping an ACT therapy targeting immunogenic mutations for
patients with breast cancer.
Materials and Methods

Tumor 4062 (lung) was resected from a 61-year-old woman
diagnosed with metastatic TNBC (NCT00001823). 4062-TILs
were generated as described previously (12). Autologous

200 U/mL IL4 (Peprotech). Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were cultured in AIM-V medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 5% human AB serum (Valley Biomedical),
0.05 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids, 25 mmol/L HEPES, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Life Technologies). Cells were maintained at 37�C and 5%
CO2. Melanoma cell lines were isolated from surgically resected
metastases as described previously (13): mel624 (HLA-A2þ/
MART-1þ) and mel2963 (HLA-DPþ/MAGE-A3þ). These tumor
cell lines, authenticated by HLA typing and MART-1 and/or
MAGE-A3 expression in the Surgery Branch (SB), were cultured
in R10 medium consisting of RPMI1640 (Life Technologies)
containing 10% FBS (Hyclone). Partially HLA-DR–matched
allogeneic EBV-B cells (authenticated in the SB by HLA typing)
were grown in R10 supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.

Translational Relevance
The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lym-
phocytes (TILs) or checkpoint inhibitors can mediate durable
tumor regressions in patients with melanoma presumably by
targeting immunogenic tumor mutations. However, evidence
suggesting that patients with other solid malignancies can
benefit from such therapies is limited. We have recently
demonstrated that the administration of autologous CD4þ
TILs selected for reactivity against a unique somatic mutation
can mediate the regression of a metastatic epithelial bile duct
cancer. Despite the fact that breast cancers have fewer somatic
mutations than melanoma, in this article, we demonstrate that
CD4þ TILs recognize a unique somatic mutation in breast
cancer. Taken together, these data suggest that adoptive cell
transfer of tumor-specific, mutation-reactive TILs is a viable
treatment option and could be the basis for a personalized cell
therapy for the treatment of patients with breast cancer.

 libraries and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 desktop sequencer
(Illumina). The library was prepared using 3-mg genomic DNA
(gDNA) isolated from fresh tumor or ten 10-mm OCT sections
following the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies).
An mRNA sequencing library was prepared from fresh tumor
using Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit. In brief, poly(A)
mRNA was purified from 1 mg total RNA using oligo-dT mag-
netic beads and fragmented in the presence of divalent ions at
94�C for 8 minutes. Fragmented RNAs were reverse-transcribed
into first-strand cDNAs by random priming, and SuperScriptII
followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. Double-stranded
cDNAs were end-repaired, adenylated at the 30 ends, ligated to
indexed sequencing adaptors, and amplified (15 cycles).
Paired-end sequencing was carried out on a NextSeq500
sequencer using a mid-output flow cell kit (300 cycles, Illu-
mina). Alignments were performed at SB using Novoalign MPI
from
Novocraft
(http://www.novocraft.com/)
to
human
genome build hg19. Duplicates were marked using Picard's
MarkDuplicates tool. Indel realignment and base recalibration
was carried out according to the GATK best practices workflow
(https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/). After cleanup of data,
samtools mpileup (http://samtools.sourceforge.net) was used
to create pileup files, and Varscan2 (http://varscan.sourceforge.
net) was used to call somatic variants. These variants were
annotated
using
Annovar
(http://annovar.openbioinfor
matics.org). We used the following filters to generate putative
mutations for evaluation for patient 4062: variant frequency
cutoff of �10% and �2 variant reads in tumor. Patient 4062
mutations are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Determination of mutation clustering
4062 WES data were used in the copy-number analysis. The
data analysis was performed in the R statistical environment,
version 3.3.0. The segmented copy number, cellularity, and
ploidy were determined using Sequenza v2.1.2 with normal
samples as references and hg19 coordinates. The cancer cell
fraction of each mutation was estimated by integrating the local
copy number, tumor purity (obtained from Sequenza), and
variant allele frequency (VAF). For the given mutations, only
mutations with tumor coverage of at least 20� were used.
Mutations were defined as clonal if the 95% confidence interval
overlapped 1, and subclonal, otherwise (14). All mutations with
read depth greater than 3 and VAF greater than 5% were
clustered using PyClone v1.3.0 Dirichlet process clustering
(15). We ran PyClone with 50,000 iterations and a burn-in of
1,000. In addition, 16 metastases were obtained at autopsy. To
detect whether the mutation in recombination signal binding
protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ) was present,
cDNA was generated from the RNA using Superscript III First-
Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies). gDNA was gener-
ated using a DNeasy Kit. RBPJ-specific PCR was performed
using the following primers: forward 50CCTCAGCAAGCG-
GATAAAAG30 and reverse 30GCTGTGAACTGGCATGAAAA50, or
forward 50AGCGAAAGCACTTCATGTTG30 and reverse 30GACA-
TGGAGTGGCCTGAAAT50. Sequencing of PCR products was
performed by Macrogen using the first primer set. For genomic
DNA samples, RBPJ-specific PCR was performed with the primer
set forward 50CCACCTTCTGCTCCAATCAC30 and reverse 30TG-
TAGCCATCTCGGACTGTG50, followed by sequencing with the
same primer set.
Generation of tandem minigenes and peptides
Tandem minigenes were constructed as described previously
(7). RNA expression plasmids encoding the minigenes (12
minigenes per TMG) were linearized with the restriction
enzyme NsiI. B cells were washed once with PBS and resus-
pended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) at 1.0 � 106 cells/mL.
In vitro transcribed (IVT) TMG RNA (8 mg) was aliquoted to the
bottom of a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette and 100 mL of B

 cells were added. Electroporations were carried out using a BTX-
830 square wave electroporator (150 V, 20 ms, 1 pulse).
Following electroporation, cells were immediately transferred
to polypropylene tubes containing B-cell media, incubated
overnight at 37�C, 5% CO2, and washed once with PBS prior
to use in coculture assays.
Individual 25-mer-long long peptides were synthesized
(Genscript). Autologous B cells were harvested, washed, resus-
pended at 1.0 � 106 cells/mL in B-cell media, and incubated
with 10 mg/mL individual or pooled peptide overnight at
37�C, 5% CO2. A mutated peptide from 4051-TIL was used
as a negative control (ENSG00000132837, QWKDRAET-
VIIGDGCVGVSLAYHLA). MHC class II epitope predictions
were done using NetMHCIIpan3.1 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
NetMHCIIpan/).
Assessment of target cell recognition
TILs were cocultured with peptide-pulsed or electroporated B
cells at a 1:5 ratio or with plate-bound OKT3 (1 mg/mL, positive
control). Response to targets was measured using an IFNg
enzyme-linked
immunospot
assay
(IFNg
ELISPOT)
as
described previously (7). Spots were read and quantitated on
an
Immunospot
S6
Microanalyzer
(Cellular
Technology
Limited).
TILs were recovered from the plates and characterized by FACS
[CD3-APC-Cy7, CD4-PE, CD8-PE-Cy7, CD134-FITC (OX40),
and CD137-APC (4-1BB, BD Biosciences)], and T-cell activation
was assessed by upregulation of the activation markers 4-1BB and/
or OX40. Finally, TILs were cocultured with autologous EBV-B
cells pulsed with peptides in the presence of GolgiStop and
GolgiPlug and assessed for intracellular cytokine production
according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). TILs
were surface stained with CD3-PE-Cy7, CD4-PE prior to fixation
and permeabilization, then stained with IFNg-FITC, IL2-APC, and
TNFa-PerCP5.5. FACS was performed on a Canto I instrument
(BD Biosciences), and data analysis was performed using FlowJo
software (FlowJo LLC).
Assessment of restriction element and minimal epitope
HLA restriction mapping was performed by incubating pep-
tide-pulsed B cells with pan anti-HLA-I W6/32 (Abcam), pan
anti-HLA-II IVA12 (SB), anti-HLA-DP (Leinco), anti-HLA-DQ
(Beckman Coulter), or anti-HLA-DR (SB) antibodies at 10
mg/1.0 � 105 cells in 100 mL for 2 hours on ice. HLA-DR
restriction was confirmed using allogeneic EBV-B cells partially
matched at the HLA-DR locus. In an attempt to define the
minimal epitope, truncated mutated peptides were synthesized
(BioSynthesis) and pulsed onto autologous EBV-B cells at 10
mg/mL. T-cell avidity was assessed by peptide titration using
EBV-B cells pulsed with serial dilutions of mutated or wild-type
peptide (1–10,000 ng/mL). TIL recognition was assessed by
coculture and IFNg ELISPOT.
T-cell receptor identification
MutRBPJ-stimulated 4062-TILs (F9) were sorted on the
basis of expression of CD3þ, CD4þ, and 4-1BBþ using a
FacsJazz Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). T-cell receptor (TCR)
deep sequencing was performed on the sorted cells by Adaptive
Biotechnologies. Four TCRs were synthesized (Genscript) using
combinations of the two most dominant alpha and beta
sequences based on CDR3 frequency. Alternatively, 4-1BBþ–
sorted cells were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) on the Fluidigm C1, according to the manufac-
turer's protocol and paired TCR-alpha and beta sequences were
identified and synthesized (Genscript). Synthesized TCRs were

Results
Patient 4062, a patient with metastatic TNBC, had a lung
metastasis resected, and 72 nonsynonymous point mutations
were identified after WES of the lesion, 43 of which were
expressed on the basis of RNA-seq data (Supplementary
Table S1). 4062-TILs were predominantly CD4þ T cells, ranging
from 66%–94% (Supplementary Table S2). 4062-TILs were
screened and ELISPOT reactivity observed in fragment 9
(F9; 756, PP3 vs. 37, irrelevant peptide) from 4062-TILs to a
mutated antigen present in PP3 (Fig. 1A) as well as upregulation
of 4-1BB (19.6%, PP3 vs. 0.53%, irrelevant peptide) in
the CD4þ T-cell population (Fig. 1B). Similar findings were
observed following coculture of 4062-TILs (F9) with B cells
electroporated with TMG3 mRNA, which corresponds to the
same mutated peptides present in PP3 (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting
that

TCR-b (C) chains. Of note, 42.9% of the TCR-a chains were unresolved. On the basis of the frequency, the two most frequent TCR-a and TCR-b chains
were used to synthesize the four possible TCR combinations. PBL transduced with TCRAV05 (the second most frequent alpha chain) and TCRBV07
(the most frequent beta chain) recognized APCs specifically presenting mutRBPJ based on IFNg ELISPOT (D) and upregulation of 4-1BB (E) in the CD4þ
T-cell population (~, mutRBPJ; ~, wtRBPJ; *, irrelevant peptide). Data are representative of three separate patient TCR-transduced PBL.

 processed and cross-presented in the context of MHC class II.
When screened against the 12 individual peptides in PP3, 4062-
TILs (F9) recognized a peptide (RLRSQTVSTRYLLVEGGNF-
HASSQQ) encoding a mutation in RBPJ (RBPJc.A611T/p.H204L)
by ELISPOT (Fig. 1C) and upregulation of both 4-1BB and
OX40 in the CD4þ T-cell population (Fig. 1D). 4062-TIL (F9)
reactivity was specific for RBPJc.A611T/p.H204L (Fig. 2A) and
polyfunctional based on CD4þ T cytokine secretion (IL2, IFNg,
and TNFa, Fig. 2B).
62-TIL (F9) recognition of RBPJc.A611T/p.H204L was blocked by
both a pan anti-MHC class II and anti-HLA-DR antibody (Fig. 3A;
Supplementary Fig. S2). HLA-DRB1
�1501–restricted based on
recognition of allogeneic EBV-B cells partially matched at the
HLA-DR locus (Fig. 3B). We identified a core sequence of the
potential minimal epitope, RYLLVEGGN (Fig. 3C), suggesting the
minimal epitope is likely located within a 15 amino acid
sequence, RYLLVEGGNFHASSQ, predicted to be the third highest
binding HLA-DRB1
�1501 epitope [rank (17%), affinity (257
nmol/L), Fig. 3C]. In an attempt to isolate a reactive TCR,
4062-TILs (F9) were stimulated overnight and the top 7% of the
CD4þ/41BBþ T cells were sorted and sent for TCR deep sequenc-
ing (Fig. 4A). No dominant TCR clonotype was identified, sug-
gesting that the frequency of the RBPJA611T-reactive cells was
extremely low at the time of the sort. Four TCRs containing the
two most dominant TCRa [Fig. 4B, TCRAV26 (16.4%) and
TCRAV05 (14.5%)] and TCRb [Fig. 4C, TCRBV20 (41.1%) and
TCRVB07
(26.2%)]
were
synthesized
(TCRAV26/TCRBV20,
TCRAV26/TCRBV07,
TCRAV05/TCRBV20
and
TCRAV05/
TCRBV07) and cloned into pMSGV1 backbone. Only one low-
avidity TCR, TCRAV05/TCRBV07, recognized RBPJA611T in a dose-
dependent manner based on ELISPOT and upregulation of 4-1BB
(Fig. 4D and E, respectively). The low T-cell avidity was not based
on poor TCR expression, as the TCRAV05/TCRBV07 TCR T-cell
transduction efficiency was 70.0% � 3.2% (range, 63.7%–73.9%,
data not shown). In a separate experiment, 4-1BB–sorted T cells
were sorted to single cells and analyzed by RNA-seq; however, no
additional TCRs reactive against RBPJA611T were identified (data
not shown).
The
identification
and
isolation
of
mutation-reactive
lymphocytes were conducted with the intent to treat patient
4062; however, the patient's disease progressed rapidly, and she
expired prior to treatment. At autopsy, the RBPJ mutation was
detected in all 16 sites of metastases (Supplementary Table S3).
We were able to isolate mRNA of sufficient quality for RT-PCR
analysis in eight of 16 samples, all of which expressed the
mutation at the mRNA level. In addition, analysis of deep
sequencing data obtained from the original resected metastasis
indicated that 36 of 72 (50%) of the called mutations were clonal,
which included RBPJc.A611T/p.H204L, six of 72 (8.3%) were sub-
clonal, and 30 of 72 (41.7%) were unable to be determined due to
the number of reads being below the cut-off value (Supplemen-
tary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Discussion
We demonstrated that TILs isolated from the autologous
T-cell repertoire of a patient with TNBC recognized an immuno-
genic nonsynonymous mutation in RBPJ (RBPJc.A611T/p.H204L).
The mutation reactivity was mediated by HLA-DRB1
�15:01–
restricted CD4þ T cells (Fig. 1). 4062-TIL (F9) reactivity was
specific and highly avid against the mutated 25-mer peptide
(Fig. 2A) and demonstrated a polyfunctional cytokine profile
secreting multiple effector cytokines, including IFNg, IL2, and
TNFa (Fig. 2B). Given the specificity of mutation-reactive 4062-
TILs (F9), it was unexpected that we were unable to isolate an
avid TCR (Fig. 4). It is likely that the long-term expansion of
this culture required to achieve cell numbers sufficient for
analysis resulted in a decrease in the frequency of the desired
TCR. For TCR gene therapy, the inability to isolate a highly avid
TCR points to a potential limitation of this therapeutic
approach; however, one could modify the TCR complemen-
tarity determining regions (CDRs) to potentially enhance the
TCR avidity; however, there are risks associated with such
modifications (16).
RBPJ is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that, in the
absence of Notch, binds DNA promoter sites and acts as a
transcriptional repressor (17, 18). Thus, a mutated RBPJ could
potentially dysregulate Notch signaling as a constitutive transcrip-
tional activator or repressor, both of which could play a role in
tumor growth. Data suggest the loss of RBPJ function can promote
tumorigenesis (19, 20). The functional consequence of an RBPJ
mutation (RBPJc.A611T/p.H204L) is not known; however, this muta-
tion was present in all sites of metastasis, and our data suggest that
mutated RBPJ is likely a clonal mutation (Supplementary Fig. S3;
Supplementary Table S3). Ideally, identification of multiple
immunogenic mutations, of both MHC class I and II restriction
would likely increase the probability of developing a successful
tumor treatment and reduce the need to target clonal mutations.
Taken together, these data suggest that there is therapeutic poten-
tial for adoptive cell therapy in metastatic breast cancers using
mutation-specific TILs.
