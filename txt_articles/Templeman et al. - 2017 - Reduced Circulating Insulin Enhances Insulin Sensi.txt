In Brief
In a study examining the life-long effects
of lowering insulin levels in mice,
Templeman et al. provide evidence that
elevated insulin levels contribute to age-
dependent insulin resistance. Moreover,
they show that slightly reducing
circulating insulin is sufficient to extend
mammalian lifespan, independently of
Igf1.

SUMMARY
Thecausalrelationshipsbetweeninsulinlevels,insulin
resistance, and longevity are not fully elucidated.
Genetic downregulation of insulin/insulin-like growth
factor 1 (Igf1) signaling components can extend inver-
tebrate and mammalian lifespan, but insulin resis-
tance, a natural form of decreased insulin signaling,
is associated with greater risk of age-related disease
in mammals. We compared Ins2+/� mice to Ins2+/+
littermate controls, on a genetically stable Ins1
null
background.
Proteomic
and
transcriptomic
analyses of livers from 25-week-old mice suggested
potential for healthier aging and altered insulin sen-
sitivity in Ins2+/� mice. Halving Ins2 lowered circu-
lating insulin by 25%–34% in aged female mice,
without altering Igf1 or circulating Igf1. Remarkably,
decreased insulin led to lower fasting glucose and
improved insulin sensitivity in aged mice. Moreover,
lowered insulin caused significant lifespan extension,
observed across two diverse diets. Our study indi-
cates that elevated insulin contributes to age-depen-
dent insulin resistance and that limiting basal insulin
levels can extend lifespan.
INTRODUCTION
Metabolism
and
lifespan
are
influenced
by
evolutionarily
conserved gene networks (Kenyon, 2010). In both invertebrates
and mammals, genetic downregulation of the insulin/insulin-like
growth factor 1 (Igf1) signaling pathway can extend lifespan
(Kenyon, 2010). As insulin and Igf1 share nearly identical down-
stream signaling pathways in mammals, and act in part via
hybrid insulin/Igf1 heterodimer receptors that can bind to either
ligand, the relative functions of these two ligands have not
been completely delineated (Siddle, 2012; Taniguchi et al.,
2006). Many studies have focused on Igf1 as the primary ligand
which mediates the lifespan-altering effects through this sig-
naling cascade in mammals (Brown-Borg et al., 1996; Flurkey
et al., 2001; Holzenberger et al., 2003), but the impact of directly
altering insulin levels on longevity had not been evaluated.
Insulin resistance is a common feature of mammalian aging
and a risk factor for numerous age-related diseases (Barzilai
et al., 2012). Although this suggests that reducing insulin
signaling could be detrimental for mammalian healthspan, it is
important to consider that conventionally defined insulin resis-
tance (i.e., impaired insulin-stimulated glucose disposal) is not
a generalized reduction of all insulin signaling. Instead, some in-
sulin-regulated processes are maintained at normal capacity in
the ‘‘insulin resistant’’ state, while others are downregulated
(Biddinger and Kahn, 2006). Moreover, circulating levels of
the insulin ligand are elevated with insulin resistance. The
commonly accepted paradigm posits that insulin levels rise as
a compensatory response to prevent hyperglycemia when
there is insufficient insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Prentki
and Nolan, 2006). However, causality between the closely
associated conditions of systemic insulin resistance and insulin
hypersecretion has remained controversial, and it has been
suggested that hyperinsulinemia could be an early, primary
cause of insulin resistance, obesity, and eventually type 2
diabetes (Corkey, 2012; Dankner et al., 2012; Le Stunff and
Bougne
` res, 1994; Shanik et al., 2008). Genetic loss-of-function
experiments targeting insulin itself present an ideal opportunity
to disentangle hyperinsulinemia from insulin resistance and to
evaluate the lifelong effects of limiting endogenous insulin pro-
duction and secretion.
To determine how moderately lowering the insulin ligand
would affect late-life glucose homeostasis and longevity in mam-
mals, we compared mice with either full or partial expression of
the ancestral insulin gene Ins2. Since altering insulin gene
dosage does not affect circulating insulin levels in all contexts
(Dionne et al., 2016; Leroux et al., 2001; Templeman et al.,
2016), we used a mouse model in which the rodent-specific insu-
lin gene (Ins1) was fully inactivated to prevent compensatory Ins1
expression. We also provided the mice with diet formulations
that support relatively robust insulin production and secretion,
because reducing insulin gene dosage cannot always diminish
circulating insulin levels under the minimally stimulatory condi-
tions of a low-energy, low-fat diet (Dionne et al., 2016) or in
male Ins1 null mice (Templeman et al., 2016). We designed our

 experiment to evaluate these animals in the context of two
distinct diets (diet A: moderate-energy diet of 4.68 kcal/g, with
20% of calories from protein, 25% from fat, and 55% from car-
bohydrate; diet B: high-energy diet of 5.56 kcal/g, with 16% of
calories from protein, 58% from fat, and 26% from carbohydrate)
to allow us to assess the effects of insulin levels across diverse
dietary parameters that were not limited to a specific macronu-
trient and micronutrient composition (Solon-Biet et al., 2014).
Remarkably, we found that across both diets, mice with
reduced circulating insulin levels had improved insulin sensitivity
with advanced age and exhibited lifespan extension without
changing Igf1 levels. These results suggest a causal contribution
for hyperinsulinemia in age-dependent insulin resistance and
point to the modest suppression of insulin as a safe and attain-
able strategy for extending lifespan.
RESULTS
Proteomic Analysis of Livers from Mice with Reduced
Insulin Gene Dosage
We have previously shown that genetically reducing circulating
insulin leads to sustained protection from high-fat diet-induced
obesity in female mice (Templeman et al., 2015). However, we
did not thoroughly characterize the proteome and transcriptome
profiles of metabolically relevant tissues in these mice. To gain
insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with the
phenotype, we focused initially on the liver as a key organ con-
trolling glucose homeostasis. We conducted quantitative prote-
omics on a pilot cohort of female Ins2+/� mice and their Ins2+/+
littermate controls, randomized to either the moderate-fat diet
A or the high-fat diet B (Figure 1A). We obtained reliable identifi-
cation of 1,074 unique proteins across all groups from livers iso-
lated from 25-week-old mice (Table S1). The abundances of a
total of 52 proteins were significantly different between either
diet groups or genotype groups, with false discovery rate
(FDR) <0.05 (four proteins differed between genotypes, Fig-
ure 1B; and 48 proteins differed between diets, Figure 1C).
Regardless of diet, livers from Ins2+/� mice showed elevated
levels of Slco1b2, Dld, Cyb5b, and Rpl23a relative to their
Ins2+/+ littermate controls (Figure 1B). Interestingly, Slco1b2
(Oatp1b2) knockout mice have impaired glucose tolerance,
reduced liver Glut2 expression, and reduced liver glucose con-
tent (Meyer zu Schwabedissen et al., 2011), which suggests
that this protein normally plays a positive role in glucose homeo-
stasis. Dld was previously identified in a proteomic screen for
factors involved in insulin signaling (Foster et al., 2006), and
reduced Dld activity has been shown to lead to accelerated
oxidative damage (Vaubel et al., 2011). Cyb5b is enriched in liver
mitochondria and may participate in lipid synthesis (Neve et al.,
2012). Collectively, this unbiased proteomic analysis suggested
that mice with reduced circulating insulin levels might exhibit
improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.
Transcriptomic Analysis of Liver and Skeletal Muscle in
Mice with Reduced Insulin Gene Dosage
We were only able to examine a limited part (<10%) of the prote-
ome from our liver samples. To provide a more comprehensive
survey, we turned to RNA sequencing analyses of muscle and
liver tissue from 25-week-old mice (Figures 2, S1, and S2; Tables
S2, S3, and S4). A multifactorial analysis of all samples found that
a single gene, Grpel2, was consistently and significantly downre-
gulated in mice with reduced Ins2 gene dosage across both diets
and both tissues (Figure 2A). Grpel2 is an essential component of
the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) complex
that regulates the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix
(Schneider et al., 1996) and is predicted by String or Biological
General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) (Stark
et al., 2006) to bind to several essential regulators of mitochon-
drial function (Figures 2B and S3). By querying published tran-
scriptomic datasets, we found that liver Grpel2 mRNA is consis-
tently decreased with caloric restriction and increased in a
number of high-fat diet studies, as well as in obese ob/ob mice
and Clock or Cyr knockout mice (Figure 2C).
When examining liver alone, we found that many other net-
works of genes related to cellular metabolism, oxidative stress,
circadian rhythm, proteostasis, and cell cycle progression were
altered by reducing Ins2 dosage under one or both diets (Figures
2D and 2E; Table S5). Many of the altered genes are known to
be associated with insulin signaling or glucocorticoid signaling
(Figure 2E) and are established regulators of longevity, cancer,
and metabolic homeostasis (Table S5). Interestingly, functional
clustering identified cholesterol metabolic processes as signifi-
cantly enriched (FDR < 1.35 3 10�6) with changed Ins2 gene
dosage in the context of diet B (Figure S2). Notably, several of
the significantly altered genes have been previously associated
with aging or longevity in humans or other animals, or in cellular
models (Table S5). Therefore, these unbiased transcriptomic
data suggested the possibility that Ins2+/� mice would eventually
exhibit improved metabolic homeostasis and perhaps extended
lifespan.
Improved Age-Dependent Glucose Homeostasis and
Insulin Sensitivity in Mice with Reduced Insulin
Our previous studies of Ins2+/� mice and their Ins2+/+ littermate
controls were limited to mice that were less than 1 year of age
(Templeman et al., 2015) and therefore provided no information
about age-dependent insulin resistance and longevity. Here,
we assessed the effects of reduced Ins2 gene dosage on circu-
lating insulin levels in aged mice. At 1.5 years of age, Ins2+/�
female mice showed only a modest reduction in fasting insulin
compared to Ins2+/+ littermates under both diets. Specifically,
Ins2+/� mice had on average 25% lower insulin compared to their
Ins2+/+ littermates when fed diet A (Figure 3A), which was in fact a
greater divergence in circulating insulin than any preceding mea-
surements in these cohorts of diet A-fed mice (Templeman et al.,

(B and C) Proteomic analyses of livers from 25-week-old mice revealed proteins with statistically significant differences in levels between Ins2+/+ mice and Ins2+/�
mice (B) and between mice on diet A versus diet B (C). FDR < 0.05 (n = 5). Proteins were clustered on the heatmap by the magnitude of the average difference in
log2 transformed values between genotype (B) or diet (C).

 2015). On diet B, Ins2+/� mice had 34% lower insulin than Ins2+/+
littermate controls (Figure 3A), consistent with the magnitude of
reduction evident at young ages (Templeman et al., 2015).
Importantly, we did not observe changes in Igf1 expression or
total circulating Igf1 with reduced Ins2 dosage in young or
aged female mice on either diet (Figures 3B and 3C), nor were
there changes in the expression of Igf1, Igfbp3, or Igf1r in muscle
or liver (Tables S2, S3, and S4). Together, these observations
suggest that our model allowed us to evaluate for the first time
the effects of altering levels of the insulin ligand independent
from detectable changes in circulating Igf1 levels. It should be
noted that inactivating one Ins2 allele in the male littermates
did not consistently or robustly reduce circulating insulin in old
age (Figure S4A), or at younger ages (Templeman et al., 2016).
Sex-dependent metabolic differences (Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015)
could potentially contribute to the often-observed differences
in longevity between sexes (Austad and Bartke, 2015), but our
model did not allow us to evaluate whether changing circulating
insulin would affect insulin sensitivity or lifespan in male mice.
Therefore, we used female mice as the means to test our hypo-
theses that lowering circulating insulin levels might modulate
age-dependent insulin resistance and extend lifespan.
We previously reported that reduced circulating insulin in
female Ins2+/� mice does not have a prolonged negative impact
on glucose homeostasis across the first year of life (Templeman
et al., 2015). However, aging has been reported to be associated
with insulin secretory defects and increased demand on pancre-
atic b cells (Chang and Halter, 2003), so lowering Ins2 dosage
could potentially have had adverse effects on glucose homeo-
stasis late in life. Counter to this possibility, aged Ins2+/� female
mice exhibited a significant reduction in fasting glucose
compared to Ins2+/+ controls (Figure 3D) and at 80 weeks had
lower value for the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resis-
tance (HOMA-IR), a measure of insulin resistance (Figure 3E). In-
sulin tolerance tests confirmed that aged Ins2+/� female mice on
both diets had superior peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to
their Ins2+/+ littermates (Figure 3F). In a preliminary experiment,
we were unable to observe marked differences in Akt or Erk
phosphorylation in liver, skeletal muscle, or white adipose tissue
in a subset of 70-week-old Ins2+/� mice (Figure S5A), although
this result does not preclude alterations that could have been
more subtle, state-dependent, or involved other insulin signaling
components or phosphorylation sites. There were no statistically
significant effects of genotype detected for the insulin secretory
response (Figure 3G) or blood glucose response (Figure 3H) to
intraperitoneal glucose in 1.5-year-old female mice. Collectively,
these data demonstrate that slightly lowering basal insulin levels
led to lower fasting glucose levels via improved insulin sensi-
tivity, suggesting a healthier metabolic state with age.
Ins2+/� mice with modestly lowered circulating insulin had
reduced body mass (Figure 4A) and fat mass (Figure 4B) at
85 weeks of age compared to their Ins2+/+ littermates, consistent
with measurements of these same animals at younger ages
(Templeman et al., 2015) and confirming the causal requirement
for elevated insulin in obesity (Mehran et al., 2012; Templeman
et al., 2015). Other parameters of body composition were un-
changed between genotypes, including skeletal muscle strength
and bone mineral density (Figures 4C–4E and S5B–S5D). At
90 weeks of age, we also did not observe differences between
genotypes in metabolism-regulating hormones such as leptin,
resistin, interleukin-6, glucose-dependent insulinotropic poly-
peptide, peptide YY, or glucagon (Figures S5E–S5J). Similarly,
circulating cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-esterified fatty
acids in 90-week-old Ins2+/� mice were not different from
Ins2+/+ controls (Figures S5K–S5M). Nonetheless, post-mortem
histopathological analyses revealed that while 12.5% (four of
32 analyzed mice) of diet B-fed Ins2+/+ mice had moderate or se-
vere hepatic lipidosis, none of the 29 analyzed diet B-fed Ins2+/�
mice showed evidence of lipid accumulation in liver (p % 0.05;
Figure 4F). Thus, diet B-fed Ins2+/� mice with lowered circulating
insulin experienced a lifelong attenuation of high-fat diet-
induced obesity and protection from some obesity-associated
sequelae, compared to Ins2+/+ controls (Templeman et al.,
2015).
Lifespan Extension in Mice with Reduced Insulin Levels
Our metabolic data revealed that reducing Ins2 gene dosage had
only modest effects on circulating insulin levels, unlike the exten-
sive endocrine disruption evident in many long-lived mouse
models (Chen et al., 2010). Remarkably, we found that this slight
change in circulating insulin was sufficient for Ins2+/� mice to
have a significant increase in lifespan, compared to Ins2+/+ litter-
mates (p % 0.05; Figure 5A). The maximum lifespan of Ins2+/�
mice also tended to be higher than Ins2+/+ controls across
both diets, whether evaluated as the average lifespan of the
longest-lived decile (p = 0.059; Figure 5B) or as an assessment
of distribution differences in the 90th percentile of the population
(p = 0.058; Figure 5A). The degree of median lifespan extension
afforded by reduced Ins2 dosage was similar for female mice on
both diets, if slightly blunted on diet B (diet A: 11% and diet B:
3%), suggesting that attenuation of diet B-associated obesity
(Templeman et al., 2015) was mechanistically distinct from life-
span extension in this study. Other than a tendency for delayed
and reduced occurrence of mortality associated with malignant

 cancers in Ins2+/� mice (p = 0.058; Figure S4H), there was no
clear effect of genotype on lifespan of male mice (Figure S4K);
since our experimental manipulation did not consistently lower
plasma insulin levels in the Ins2+/� males, we were unable to
ascertain whether reduced circulating insulin could affect
longevity in males.
One evolutionarily conserved feature of aging is increased
reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage, and many
long-lived organisms exhibit resistance to oxidative stress
(Bratic and Larsson, 2013). Although there were no differences
observed in 30-week-old mice, 90-week-old Ins2+/� female
mice showed diminished effects of oxidative damage compared

 to their Ins2+/+ littermates across both diets, as indicated by
reduced plasma levels of 8-isoprostane, a circulating marker of
oxidative stress (Figure 5C).
Histopathological evaluation of post-mortem tissues was
conducted for >90% of all mice to determine if lowering insulin
protected mice from specific conditions or whether it had a
more general effect on health. Interestingly, diet B-fed Ins2+/�
female mice tended to show delayed and reduced occurrence
of malignant cancer-associated mortality compared to Ins2+/+
littermates (Figures 5D–5F). There was also a statistically signif-
icant delay in mortality associated with renal degeneration and
kidney diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis,
tubule atrophy or dilation, protein deposits or mineralization,
cysts, and renal infarcts) in Ins2+/� female mice compared to
their Ins2+/+ littermates (Figure 5H). Diet A appeared to induce
disease in middle-aged female mice (Figure 5A), but since de-
tected lesions were not considered severe enough to have
caused mortality or morbidity for many diet A-fed mice (Fig-
ure 5I), we were unable to link any one disease category to
diet A consumption. It is important to note that diets A and B
were not matched for the type of fat content, protein levels, or
micronutrient composition, so there are numerous potential
factors that could have impacted diet-dependent outcomes. It
is well known that diet composition has profound impacts on
lifespan (e.g., Solon-Biet et al., 2014) and on metabolic param-
eters, such as circulating insulin levels. Therefore, it was not a
goal of our study to evaluate the effects of different diet formu-
lations on lifespan, but rather to ascertain whether genetically
limiting production and secretion of insulin, a key metabolic
enzyme, could have consistent effects on lifespan under
diverse dietary circumstances. As the relative proportion of
mice experiencing any of the identified major pathologies was
largely comparable between Ins2+/� and Ins2+/+ mice within
each tested diet, our results indicate that lowering insulin levels
appears to provide a general extension of healthspan and life-
span, rather than alleviating one specific type of disease.

 DISCUSSION
The aims of this study were to examine molecular sequelae of
moderately reduced circulating insulin and to test the hypo-
theses that directly reducing insulin levels could improve meta-
bolic homeostasis, healthspan, and longevity in old mice. We
compared Ins2+/� mice to Ins2+/+ littermate controls on a genetic
background that was stable between experimental groups and
assessed mice that were exposed to two diverse diets. Protein
and mRNA changes consistent with improvements to insulin
sensitivity and healthspan were already evident at a young
age in mice with reduced insulin gene dosage. Furthermore,
we found that when reducing insulin gene dosage successfully
suppressed circulating levels of the hormone, mice showed
enhanced insulin sensitivity with age and lifespan extension.
The concept that limiting circulating insulin levels could
improve
glucose
homeostasis
may seem
counterintuitive.
Indeed, at 6 weeks of age, the female Ins2+/� mice from this
study did exhibit a slight, temporary elevation in fasting glucose
relative to their Ins2+/+ littermate controls, indicating that their in-
sulin levels may have been not quite sufficient for full glycemic
control when they were young (Templeman et al., 2015). How-
ever, these differences were only evident for a very brief period
in young mice, and rather than having lasting adverse effects
on glucose homeostasis, we found that a moderate reduction
in basal insulin levels led to improved insulin responsiveness
and lowered fasting glucose in aged Ins2+/� mice. Since aging
has been reported to be associated with the emergence of insu-
lin secretory defects and worsening insulin responsiveness
(Chang and Halter, 2003), a lifetime of lessening the demands
of insulin production in the b cell and also limiting insulin stimu-
lation in the periphery could have contributed to improvements
in metabolic health of aged Ins2+/� mice. Although many inves-
tigators in the type 2 diabetes research field believe that insulin
resistance is an early and causal factor in the progression to hy-
perinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes, there is evidence that insulin
resistance can instead be the result of elevated or continuous
exposure to the insulin ligand, causing tissue ‘‘desensitization’’
at the receptor or post-receptor level (Shanik et al., 2008). Our
observation that moderately lowering insulin improved insulin
responsiveness in aged mice suggests that insulin hypersecre-
tion is a key upstream contributor to the insulin resistance that
commonly develops with aging in mammals. Similarly, alleviating
insulin hypersecretion in obese mammals has been shown to
lead to improvements in insulin signaling and sensitivity (Alemza-
deh et al., 1996; Gray et al., 2010; Pedersen et al., 2015).
Together, these findings indicate that hyperinsulinemia and insu-
lin resistance have a more complex relationship with each other
than widely appreciated.
Many of the environmental and genetic manipulations that
have been shown to modulate mammalian lifespan have been
associated with changes in insulin levels or downstream insulin
signaling pathways, but the role of the insulin ligand itself had
not been directly addressed. For instance, dietary restriction,
one of the most effective environmental manipulations for ex-
tending healthspan and lifespan, causes extensive physiological
changes and alters circulating levels of many hormones,
including both Igf1 and insulin (Barzilai et al., 2012; Fontana
and Partridge, 2015). Multiple studies have pointed to a key
conserved role for the shared insulin/Igf1 signaling pathway in
longevity. While the extent of the effect varies depending on
sex and strain background, extended lifespan has been reported
in mice with partially inactivated Igf1 receptors (Holzenberger
et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2014), insulin receptors knocked out in
adipocyte protein 2-expressing tissues (Bl€
uher et al., 2003),
genetic knock down of the p110a catalytic subunit of phosphoi-
nositide 3-kinase (Foukas et al., 2013), deleted Irs1 (Selman
et al., 2008, 2011), genetic knockdown of Irs2 (Taguchi et al.,
2007), and transgenic overexpression of one of the pathway’s
negative repressors, Pten (Ortega-Molina et al., 2012). More-
over, genetic variations in INSR (Kojima et al., 2004), IGF1R
(Suh et al., 2008), AKT (Pawlikowska et al., 2009), FOXO1
(Li et al., 2009; Lunetta et al., 2007), and FOXO3A (Flachsbart
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Pawlikowska et al., 2009; Willcox
et al., 2008) have been linked to long human lifespan. However,
none of the studies examining their common signaling network
can distinguish the roles of the insulin versus Igf1 ligands. While
genetic reduction of Igf1 has been reported to extend mean life-
span of female mice by 16% (Svensson et al., 2011), or signifi-
cantly extend only maximum lifespan (Lorenzini et al., 2014),
the effects of specifically reducing the insulin ligand without
changing Igf1 were not known.
Reduced circulating insulin has been noted in many mamma-
lian models of lifespan extension, including human centenarians
(Bl€
uher et al., 2002; Coschigano et al., 2003; Dominici et al.,
2002; Ortega-Molina et al., 2012; Paolisso et al., 1996; Sun
et al., 2013; Taguchi et al., 2007). It has also been suggested
that, of all the endocrine alterations associated with diminished
somatotropic signaling, enhancement of insulin sensitivity and
the concurrent reduction in insulin is key for mediating lifespan
extension in mice with reduced growth hormone signaling
(Arum et al., 2014; Bonkowski et al., 2006; Masternak et al.,
2009). However, it was previously unclear if lowered insulin
had a causal role in extending lifespan or if it was simply an auxil-
iary feature of metabolic health in long-lived mammals (Barzilai
et al., 2012). In our study, halving Ins2 gene dosage in female
mice reduced circulating insulin levels by at most 25%–34%
and did not affect Igf1 expression or total circulating Igf1 levels.
Nevertheless, this minor manipulation was sufficient to improve
health in aging Ins2+/� mice, leading to decreased oxidative
damage and improved whole-animal insulin sensitivity, and
culminating in a significant extension of lifespan.
Our data suggest that mild insulin reduction has general
effects on healthspan, rather than affecting the risk of a specific
set of ailments. Thus, we expected the underlying molecular
mechanisms to be mediated through multiple pathways. Indeed,
proteomic and transcriptomic analyses identified a broad range
of pathways that were modulated in the direction expected for
longevity and improved glucose homeostasis before these phe-
notypes became evident. Specifically, we noted differences in
genes related to cellular metabolism and redox state, circadian
rhythm, cell cycle, cholesterol/lipid homeostasis, and proteosta-
sis. We identified Grpel2 as a transcript that was consistently and
significantly decreased in both skeletal muscle and liver in
Ins2+/� mice across both diets. Grpel2 has been reported to
interact with the longevity-regulating mitochondrial Hsp70
Cell Reports 20, 451–463, July 11, 2017
459
 (Naylor et al., 1998) and is linked to mitochondrial function and
protein import into the matrix, which is particularly interesting
in light of the putative roles for the mitochondrial unfolded pro-
tein response and mild energy stress in mediating longevity
(Sun et al., 2016).
In summary, limiting insulin hypersecretion within the normal
physiological range of endogenous insulin production in mice is
sufficient to enhance insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis
with age, as well as extend lifespan. Complex variation in the
human INSULIN gene locus can lead to a range of insulin secre-
tion, and within this range, insulin levels are correlated with BMI in
children (Le Fur et al., 2006), but have not been carefully investi-
gated with respect to lifespan. In healthy non-diabetic individ-
uals, slight reductions in fasting insulin have no known side
effects and are relatively easy to achieve by dietary and lifestyle
interventions (Demontis et al., 2013; Mattson et al., 2014; Varady
and Hellerstein, 2007). Further exploration of the effects of
lowering insulin levels under different diets and at various life
stages should be conducted in experimental systems and in
humans. We suggest that modestly reducing circulating insulin
could be a promising approach for improving healthspan.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Experimental Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia
Animal Care Committee in accordance with Canadian Council for Animal
Care guidelines. The Ins1 null and Ins2 null alleles were generated and pro-
vided by J. Jami and colleagues (Duvillie
´ et al., 1997), and our closed colony
of mice was maintained by interbreeding Ins1�/�;Ins2+/� and Ins1�/�;Ins2+/+
littermates. SNP analyses (detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Proced-
ures) confirmed that the genetic background of the inbred experimental mice
did not differ between genotypes and consisted of approximately 45% C57BL/
6 and 55% 129 strains. To further ensure that any genetic variability was
randomly segregated between experimental groups, our experimental design
always employed Ins2+/� and Ins2+/+ littermates (i.e., siblings from each litter
distributed among all experimental groups) for making comparisons. The pro-
teomic and transcriptomic data were from one group of mice, distinct from
those evaluated in longevity experiments (Figure 1A). Lifespan assessments
were performed for two separate large cohorts of mice (born approximately
1 year apart), and the covariate of ‘‘cohort’’ was never statistically significant
in survival curve evaluations.
Shortly after weaning (i.e., at 3–4 weeks of age), male and female Ins2+/+ and
Ins2+/� mice on an Ins1�/� background were assigned to one of two diet
groups: diet A (LabDiet 5LJ5; PMI Nutrition International) or diet B (Research
Diets D12330; Research Diets). Each litter was distributed between the two
diet assignments based on matching the initial average body mass between
groups. Food was provided ad libitum throughout their lives except during
fasting periods. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions
at 21�C, on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle.
Proteomics and RNA Sequencing
The livers and triceps surae hindlimb muscle groups were dissected from
25-week-old female mice euthanized after 4 hr of fasting, flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at �80�C for RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses.
Proteomic analysis of liver samples is described in detail in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. In brief, homogenized samples were prefractio-
nated using gel electrophoresis and trypsin-digested for peptide extraction.
Triplex dimethyl labeling was conducted after dried peptides were resus-
pended, then equal amounts of light, medium, and heavy labeled peptides
were mixed and desalted before peptides were dried and resuspended prior
to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide identification
and quantification was carried out using MaxQuant (v.1.5.2.8), with a search
performed against the mouse (Mus musculus) database downloaded from
UniProt (January, 2016).
RNA isolation and purification from livers and triceps surae hindlimb muscle
groups were performed using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
Sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation
v2 Kit (Illumina) from 400 ng of total RNA. Sample quality was assessed using a
Bioanalyzer and samples were quantified using Qubit. Libraries were multi-
plexed and sequenced over two rapid-run lanes on HiSeq2500, and raw
data were converted to FASTQ format with bcl2fastq-v.1.8.4 (Illumina).
Following extensive preliminary analyses comparing differential expression
evaluation
methods
(see
Supplemental
Experimental
Procedures),
the
kallisto-DESeq2 pipeline was used to generate the presented results.
Bioinformatic Analyses of Transcriptomic Data
Genetic network modeling of GRPEL2 was conducted using StringDB em-
ploying default settings. To identify dietary and genetic factors related to meta-
bolism and longevity that modulate the expression of Grpel2 in liver, we
queried the NCBI GEO Profiles database for studies in which the mRNA was
measured. Of the 3,601 records, 276 experiments containing the keyword
‘‘liver’’ were manually searched for relevant studies employing caloric restric-
tion, high-fat feeding, and genetic knock outs of genes known to control meta-
bolism and/or longevity. Eight microarray studies were identified, and the
deposited values of each sample were normalized around the average of the
control samples.
Lifespan Assay
For mice used in evaluating longevity and metabolic parameters, most in vivo
experiments (Templeman et al., 2015, 2016) were performed within the first
1.5 years of murine life on a subset of mice. After this, animals were left largely
undisturbed, with the exception of daily visual assessment and regular
health monitoring. Ill mice were subject to more frequent health monitoring
and were euthanized if they reached a humane endpoint. Humane endpoint
was determined based on a set of criteria that involved scoring body weight
(cumulative and/or rapid weight loss), activity levels and responsiveness, tu-
mor size and/or ulceration, and signs of general well-being. Researchers
were blinded to genotype while scoring mouse health. For the purposes of
this study, euthanization at a humane endpoint was considered an estimate
of natural lifespan.
Necropsies were performed on nearly all (>90%) of the mice. Following fix-
ation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, major vital organs and any gross tissue
abnormalities were sectioned, stained with H&E, and assessed by a board-
certified veterinary pathologist. The pathologist, who was blinded to genotype,
scored the severity of lesions and provided an evaluation of which lesions likely
contributed to natural death or the clinical signs leading to euthanization.
In Vivo Physiological Evaluations
A subset of mice (distributed between all experimental groups) underwent
physiological tests that included infrequent blood sampling and/or evaluations
of body composition and forelimb grip strength. Mice were fasted for 4 hr
during the light period prior to any measurements of circulating factors. Intra-
peritoneal glucose-stimulated (2 g/kg) insulin secretion was measured in a
subset of mice, as well as blood glucose response to intraperitoneal delivery
of glucose or an insulin analog (0.75 U/kg of Humalog; Eli Lilly). Commercially
available kits (outlined in Supplemental Experimental Procedures) were used
according to manufacturers’ instructions to evaluate levels of insulin and other
plasma analytes in collected blood samples. In vivo body composition,
including total-fat and fat-free mass, as well as bone mineral density, was
assessed periodically in a subset of mice using dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry (DEXA; Lunar PIXImus densitometer; GE Medical Systems LUNAR). A grip
strength meter (Columbus Instruments) was used to evaluate forelimb grip
strength in these animals.
Statistics
Statistical tests on proteomic data were performed in Perseus (v.1.5.0.9) using
imported values for MaxQuant (normalized protein ratios). For these statistical
tests, data were log2 transformed prior to analysis. Two-tailed two-sample
t tests were used to compare protein expression between groups of different
460
Cell Reports 20, 451–463, July 11, 2017
 genotype (using heavy/light and medium/light values), with a permutation-
based FDR correction (p < 0.05) applied. R was used to analyze RNA
sequencing data, with multifactorial analyses carried out, either: (1) with all
samples incorporated, to assess the overall effects of genotype across both
diets and both tissues or (2) within each tissue, to assess the effects of geno-
type across both diets for muscle and liver separately. In addition, pairwise
comparisons were performed between genotypes for each diet separately in
a further examination of gene expression in liver. Most other statistical ana-
lyses were performed with SPSS 15.0. For many analyses, two-way ANOVA
models were used to assess factors of genotype and diet, and a significant
interaction led to a one-way ANOVA comparison of groups, with Bonferroni
corrections applied. Chi-square tests were used to statistically evaluate inci-
dence of hepatic steatosis in diet B-fed female mice. Survival curves consisted
of: (1) assessments of lifespan incorporating mortality due to all causes, with
the exceptions of euthanization due to severe fight wounds, self-mutilation,
or malocclusions (which led to eight animals being censored, evenly distrib-
uted between genotypes) and (2) assessments of mortality associated with
the main categories of identified pathologies. Kaplan-Meir analyses were per-
formed with log-rank comparisons stratified by diet, including censored mice
up to the date of euthanasia. In addition, survival curve results were validated
with Cox proportional hazards regression analyses incorporating covariates of
diet and cohort. R was used for statistical analyses of distribution differences in
the 90th percentile according to Gao et al. (2008), applying a Wilcoxen test
stratified by diet. A critical a-level was set as p % 0.05, and p values were
adjusted to account for multiple comparisons.
