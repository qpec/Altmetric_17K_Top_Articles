 Impact of Insulin and Metformin
Versus Metformin Alone on b-Cell
Function in Youth With Impaired
Glucose Tolerance or Recently
Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes
https://doi.org/10.2337/dc18-0787
OBJECTIVE
Pediatric type 2 diabetes prevalence is increasing, with b-cell dysfunction key in
its pathogenesis. The RISE Pediatric Medication Study compared two approachesd
glargine followed by metformin with metformin alonedin preserving or improving
b-cell function in youth with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed
type 2 diabetes during and after therapy withdrawal.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Ninety-one pubertal, overweight/obese 10–19-year-old youth with IGT (60%)
or type 2 diabetes of <6 months duration (40%) were randomized to either 3 months
of insulin glargine with a target glucose of 4.4–5.0 mmol/L followed by 9 months of
metformin or to 12 months of metformin alone. b-Cell function (insulin sensitivity
paired with b-cell responses) was assessed by hyperglycemic clamp at baseline,
12 months (on treatment), and 15 months (3 months off treatment).
RESULTS
No significant differences were observed between treatment groups at baseline,
12 months, or 15 months in b-cell function, BMI percentile, HbA1c, fasting glucose,
or oral glucose tolerance test 2-h glucose results. In both treatment groups, clamp-
measured b-cell function was significantly lower at 12 and 15 months versus
baseline. HbA1c fell transiently at 6 months within both groups. BMI was higher
in the glargine followed by metformin versus metformin alone group between
3 and 9 months. Only 5% of participants discontinued the interventions, and
both treatments were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS
In youth with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, neither 3 months of glargine
followed by 9 months of metformin nor 12 months of metformin alone halted
the progressive deterioration of b-cell function. Alternate approaches to preserve
b-cell function in youth are needed.
The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth epidemiological study has highlighted a continued
increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents age 10–19 years,
particularly among ethnic minority groups. The Treatment Options for Type 2
Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study demonstrated that in 50% of

 youth with type 2 diabetes, initial as-
signed treatment failed, requiring the
initiation of insulin therapy after an
average follow-up of 3.9 years, which
is in keeping with faster disease pro-
gression than reported in adults (1–3).
In TODAY, lower b-cell function at base-
line as well as a greater decline in b-cell
function over time predicted worse glyce-
mic control and treatment failure (4). Thus,
interventions to preserve or improve
b-cell function in youth are critically
needed.
Metformin and insulin each has been
shown to improve b-cell function in
adults with impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT) or recent-onset type 2 diabetes. The
Diabetes Prevention Program demon-
strated that metformin improves b-cell
function and reduces diabetes progres-
sion by 31% over 3 years in adults with
IGT (5,6). Weng et al. (7) showed in adults
with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
that ,2 weeks of intensive insulin ther-
apy improves and maintains b-cell func-
tion, resulting in prolonged remission
from requiring diabetes medication.
Whether such interventions have similar
benefits in youth is unclear. The Re-
storing Insulin Secretion (RISE) Pediatric
Medication Study was designed as a
proof-of-principle trial to test in youth
across a continuum of b-cell dysfunction
from IGT to mild, recently diagnosed
type 2 diabetes the hypothesis that initial
short-term treatment with insulin glargine
for 3 months followed by metformin for
9 months would preserve or improve b-cell
function compared with metformin alone,
with a sustained effect after withdrawal
of therapy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Protocol
The RISE Pediatric Medication Study
was a four-center, randomized, open-
label clinical trial funded by the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases. The rationale and meth-
ods have been described in detail else-
where (8–10); additional specifics are
provided in the Supplementary Data.
Each center’s institutional review board
approved the protocol. Written parental
consent and child assent were obtained
consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki
and each center’s institutional review
board guidelines. The protocol can be
foundathttps://rise.bsc.gwu.edu/web/
rise/collaborators.
Participants
A summary of study visits is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1, and a summary of
participants enrolled and their rates of
completion of study visits is shown in a
CONSORT diagram (Supplementary Fig.
2). Enrollment occurred between July
2013 and April 2016. Youth age 10–19
years with a BMI $85th percentile for
age and sex but ,50 kg/m2, IGT or re-
cently diagnosed (,6monthsduration)
type 2 diabetes, and Tanner stage $II
(females, Tanner stage $II breast de-
velopment; and males, testicular volume
.3mL) were eligible. Screening included
a history and physical examination, lab-
oratory tests, and a 75-g oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT). Eligibility criteria
included the simultaneous presence of all
the following: negative GAD and IA2 auto-
antibodies, fasting glucose $5 mmol/L,
OGTT 2-h glucose $7.8 mmol/L, and
HbA1c #8.0% (64 mmol/mol) if drug
na¨
ıve. In youth with type 2 diabetes
already taking metformin, eligibility was
modified to HbA1c #7.5% (58 mmol/mol)
if on metformin for ,3 months and #7.0%
(53 mmol/mol) if on metformin for
3–6 months.
Final eligibility required $80% com-
pliance with 3 weeks of placebo medi-
cation (or study-provided metformin if
already taking metformin) and atten-
dance at scheduled run-in visits. Eligi-
ble participants underwent a baseline
hyperglycemic clamp and OGTT followed
by random 1:1 treatment assignment by
study site, stratified by glycemic status.
Interventions
The glargine followed by metformin
groupreceived3monthsofinsulinglargine
titrated at least twice weekly by a preset
algorithm (Supplementary Study Methods)
to achieve a fasting glucose of 4.4–
5.0 mmol/L on the basis of daily self-
monitored blood glucose (SMBG, Free-
style Lite, Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff,
IL), which was followed immediately
by 9 months of metformin (titrated to
1,000 mg twice daily). Youth already
taking metformin and randomized to
glargine therapy discontinued active
metformin at the time of initiation of
glargine treatment. The metformin group
received metformin alone (titrated to
1,000 mg twice daily) for 12 months.
Participants took their assigned inter-
vention for 12 months, after which it
was withdrawn, and follow-up continued
while off study medication for an additional
3 months to determine the 15-month
primary outcome of treatment durability.
Anthropometrics, HbA1c, and safety eval-
uations were performed every 3 months,
and hyperglycemic clamps and OGTTs
were repeated at 12 and 15 months
(8–10) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Labora-
tory assessments were performed in a
central laboratory at the University of
Washington as summarized below and
described in greater detail elsewhere (9).
Medication adverse effects, symptoms
of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and
adherence (returned medication bottle
pill count, returned insulin pen residual
volume) were assessed at all study
visits. A detailed algorithm was used for
addressing hypoglycemia, hyperglyce-
mia, and acute metabolic decompen-
sation at each visit (Supplementary Study
Methods). If protocol-specified HbA1c
safety thresholds were exceeded at any
visit, outcome assessments were per-
formed whenever possible. The partici-
pant was then withdrawn from the study
and referred for additional diabetes treat-
ment as appropriate. Safety was moni-
tored by an independent data and safety
monitoring board.
Procedures and Calculations
A two-step hyperglycemic clamp (11.1
mmol/L, .25 mmol/L) paired with the
insulin secretagogue arginine at the
second step was performed at baseline,
12 months, and 15 months as previously
described (8–10). If the participant was
on metformin, the last dose of metformin
was taken the evening before the hy-
perglycemic clamp. The hyperglycemic
clamp was used to quantify simulta-
neouslyinsulinsensitivity(M/I)andthree
b-cell response measures: 1) steady-
state(second-phase) C-peptide, 2) acute
C-peptide response to arginine at maximal
glycemic potentiation (ACPRmax), and
3) acute (first-phase)C-peptideresponse
toglucose(ACPRg).M/Iwascalculatedas
themeanglucoseinfusionrate(M)at100,
110, and 120 min of the clamp divided
by the corresponding mean steady-
state plasma insulin concentration (I)
(11–13). Mean steady-state (second-
phase) C-peptide and insulin concentra-
tions were calculated at 100, 110, and
120 min (13). ACPRmax was calculated
as the mean incremental response above
concentrations before the arginine bolus
(14) and ACPRg as the mean incremental

 response above baseline for the first 10
min after glucose bolus (15).
The 15-month (3 months after discon-
tinuation of metformin) steady-state C-
peptide and ACPRmax, each paired with
15-month insulin sensitivity, represent the
coprimary outcomes. These were paired
to express the magnitude of the b-cell re-
sponse as a function of the prevailing insulin
sensitivity (15). Secondary outcomes from
the hyperglycemic clamp included the 15-
month ACPRg paired with the 15-month M/I
and the 12-month C-peptide response
measures (steady-state C-peptide, ACPR-
max, ACPRg) each paired with M/I at the
same time point.
A 3-h 75-g OGTT also was performed
on a separate day and used to determine
fasting and 2-h glucose at baseline, 12
months,and15months.Iftheparticipant
was on metformin, the last dose of
metformin was taken the evening before
the OGTT. Additional HbA1c testing was
done at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15
months for robust phenotyping of par-
ticipants over time.
Assays
Glucose was measured using the glu-
cose hexokinase method on a Roche
c501 autoanalyzer. C-peptide and insulin
were measured by a two-site immunoen-
zymometric assay performed on the Tosoh
2000 autoanalyzer (Tosoh Bioscience, Inc.,
South San Francisco, CA). Interassay co-
efficients of variation on quality control
samples with low, medium, medium-high,
and high concentrations were #2.0% for
glucose,#4.3%for C-peptide, and#3.5%
for insulin.
Statistics
Data were accumulated centrally, and
analyses were performed according to a
prespecified analysis plan. For this proof-
of-principle trial, we chose two mea-
sures of b-cell function as coprimary
outcomes: clamp-derived steady-state
C-peptide and ACPRmax at 15 months
(both evaluated jointly with M/I). These
two measures evaluate different compo-
nents of b-cell function and were selected
because there were no data in youth to
determinewhetheroneortheother was
likely to change after the interventions.
No preliminary data were available in
youth on the expected differences in
either primary outcome after a period
of intervention withdrawal (washout).
Several unpublished analyses provided
a range of possible differences between
individuals taking medication and those
taking placebo as well as expected corre-
lations between baseline and follow-up
measures. Therefore, sample size was
based on a minimum effect size equal to
the difference between the two groups
divided by the SD in favor of the glargine
followed by metformin group at a power
of 80%. Because we targeted improve-
ments in b-cell function, a one-sided
significance level of 0.05 to detect a ben-
efit of glargine followed by metformin
was used for each comparison, with a
conservative correlation of 0.5 between
baseline and follow-up measures. Thirty-
nine participants per arm (78 total) at the
end of the washout provided $80% power
to detect a minimum effect size of 0.57 in
favor of glargine followed by metformin
foreitherprimaryoutcomemeasurement
using baseline-adjusted ANCOVA. Ninety
participants were sought, allowing for an
;10% loss to follow-up.
The primary analysis was the compar-
ison of b-cell responses paired with M/I
between treatment groups at 15 months,
adjusted for baseline b-cell response and
M/I. Joint models for b-cell response and
M/I were fit simultaneously using seem-
ingly unrelated regression techniques
(16–18), which provide a two degrees
of freedom x2 test of the treatment arm
difference in the joint values of b-cell
response and M/I between treatment
groups. The same methods were used to
compare treatment groups at 12 months.
To evaluate changes within each treat-
ment arm over time, Hotelling T2 distri-
bution was used to test changes in b-cell
responses and M/I simultaneously (19).
Additional secondary analyses compared
means across treatment arms at specific
time points by using ANCOVA adjusted
for the baseline value of the measure and
by repeated-measures ANCOVA across the
active 12-month intervention period ad-
justed for thebaselinevalue ofthe measure.
Two participants had an HbA1c elevation
requiring study withdrawal before their
15-monthprimaryoutcomevisit.Theclamp-
derived outcome data for these partic-
ipants were imputed using the midpoint
between zero and the lowest value in
their respective treatment arm.
RESULTS
Demographic, Physical, and Metabolic
Characteristics
We screened 236 youth and randomized
91 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Table 1 lists
baseline demographic and metabolic
characteristics of participants by treat-
ment arm. The metformin alone group
was slightly younger but not different
in Tanner stage. All other baseline phys-
ical, metabolic, b-cell response, and in-
sulin sensitivity measures were similar
between treatment groups. Of the 91
participants, 21 with type 2 diabetes
were receiving metformin at random-
ization or were previously exposed to it,
with a similar distribution of metformin
exposure and IGT versus type 2 diabetes
status between treatment groups.
Adherence to Interventions
During weeks 11–12, the mean 6 SD
glargine dose in the glargine followed
by metformin group was 0.7 6 0.4 units/
kg/day, and fasting blood glucose had
decreased from a mean of 6.0 6 0.8
mmol/L at the baseline OGTT to a fasting
SMBG mean of 5.2 6 0.7 mmol/L, with
50% achieving the 4.4–5.0 mmol/L goal
(Fig. 1). As assessed by residual volume,
68% of participants were .80% compliant
with the insulin. Metformin adherence
by pill count was 88 6 18% over the
entire study, not differing by treatment
group.
Treatment Effects on Temporal
Changes in b-Cell Function
Figure 2 illustrates glucose and C-peptide
concentrations during the hyperglyce-
mic clamps performed at baseline, 12
months, and 15 months. Of note, iden-
tical target glucose concentrations of
11.1 and .25 mmol/L were achieved
and not different between treatment
groups at baseline, 12 months, and 15
months. Supplementary Table 1 shows
b-cell responses and M/I by treatment
group.
No significant differences were found
between treatment groups at 12 or 15
months in either primary measure of
b-cell function (e.g., response [steady-
state C-peptide, ACPRmax] paired with
M/I) or in the secondary measure of
b-cell function (ACPRg paired with M/I).

from baseline to 12 and 15 months for
each of the two coprimary clamp-derived
b-cell responses (steady-state C-peptide,

 figure legends. Two participants in the
metformin alone arm met HbA1c criteria
for study withdrawal at 9 months; thus
they had a 12-month visit but did not
complete the 15-month visit. The inclu-
sion of imputed values for their b-cell
responses and M/I at 15 months did not
alter the results.
Neither treatment improved nor main-
tained b-cell function at the end of
or after active treatment (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 3). Rather, b-cell
function declined significantly from
baseline while on active treatment
through 12 months within each treatment
group for steady-state C-peptide with
M/I (glargine followed by metformin P =
0.019, metformin alone P = 0.025) and
ACPRmax with M/I (glargine followed by
metformin P , 0.001, metformin alone
P = 0.001). b-Cell function remained
significantly worse at 15 months com-
pared with baseline within both treat-
ments for steady-state C-peptide with
M/I (glargine followed by metformin
P , 0.001, metformin alone P = 0.031),
ACPRmax with M/I (glargine followed
by metforminP=0.001,metforminalone
P , 0.001), and ACPRg with M/I (glargine
followed by metformin P , 0.001, met-
formin alone P = 0.014).
Approximately 60% of participants had
IGT at baseline; by study design, none had
received metformin before randomiza-
tion. In this IGT subgroup, we observed
patterns similar to those seen in the full
cohort, with no evidence of a beneficial
effect on b-cell function of glargine fol-
lowed by metformin versus metfor-
min alone, and a worsening of b-cell
function through 12 and 15 months in
both treatment groups (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4).
Temporal Patterns of BMI and
Glycemic Measures Over 15 Months
Several transient changes were seen in
body size and glycemic parameters (Fig.
4). BMI did not differ between treatment
groups at 12 or 15 months. However,
BMI declined from baseline within the
metformin alone group over the first
9 months, resulting in a significantly lower
BMI across the 12-month intervention
period in the metformin alone versus
glargine followed by metformin group
(P = 0.008) and specifically at 3 (P , 0.001),
6 (P , 0.02), and 9 (P , 0.04) months.
HbA1c did not significantly differ be-
tween treatment groups across the
12-month intervention period or at any
individual time point (Fig. 4). However,
compared with baseline, HbA1c de-
clined significantly within the glargine
followed by metformin group at 3 months
while on glargine treatment (P , 0.03)
and within both groups at 6 months
(glargine followed by metformin P =
0.001, metformin alone P = 0.01) before
rebounding to baseline levels in both
groups at months 9 and 12, despite
continued active metformin treatment.
By 15 months, HbA1c had increased sig-
nificantly from baseline in the glargine
followed by metformin group (P = 0.03),
ending at ;6% (42 mmol/mol) in both
treatment groups.
No differences were found between
treatment groups in fasting or OGTT 2-h
glucose concentrations at 12 or 15 months.
Within the glargine followed by metformin
group, fasting glucose was not different at
12 months compared with baseline but
rose higher than baseline by 15 months
(off treatment) (P = 0.02). Within the
glargine followed by metformin group,
2-h glucose was significantly lower than
baseline at 12 months (P = 0.02) but

15 months. Within the metformin alone
group, no significant changes were found
infastingor2-hglucoseat12monthswhile
on active treatment or at 15 months.
Safety Outcomes
Seven serious adverse events occurred
(one hospitalization each for suicidal
ideation/anxiety, newly diagnosed Ewing
sarcoma, otitis externa, appendicitis/
appendectomy, and pneumonia and
two hospitalizations for tonsillectomy/
adenoidectomy), all deemed unrelated
to the study interventions. Other non-
serious adverse events are summarized in
Supplementary Table 2. No participants
had severe hypoglycemia or acute meta-
bolic decompensation as defined in Sup-
plementary Study Methods. Accordingly,
no participants required rescue therapy
with insulin.
Over the 15 months, three participants
in the glargine followed by metformin
group with IGT at baseline and none in
the metformin alone group with IGT at
baseline developed diabetes as defined
by OGTT criteria and HbA1c $6.5%
(48 mmol/mol) (20). In each treatment
group, three participants met hypergly-
cemic criteria for study withdrawal. The
last outcome visits for these partici-
pants were three at 15 months in the
glargine followed by metformin group
and two at 12 and one at 15 months in
the metformin alone group, after which
the participants were withdrawn from
the study and returned to their primary
diabetes provider for additional diabe-
tes treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
In youth along the glycemic continuum
of IGT to mild, recently diagnosed type
2 diabetes, we tested whether initial short-
term treatment with insulin glargine for
3 months followed by metformin for 9
months would preserve or improve b-cell
function compared with metformin alone
for 12 months and a sustained effect after
withdrawal of therapy. No significant dif-
ferences were found between groups in
b-cell function at 12 or 15 months, and all
b-cell measures at 12 months (on treat-
ment) and 15 months (off treatment) were
worse than at baseline. Thus, the only two
agents approved for treating type 2 di-
abetes in youth both failed to preserve or
improve b-cell function during or after
withdrawal of treatment in youth with IGT
or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
Trials of insulin therapy in adults with
IGT or early type 2 diabetes support the
concept that early use of insulin may
have a beneficial long-term effect on
dysglycemia. In the Outcome Reduction
With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN
Trial), adults with high cardiovascular dis-
ease risk and prediabetes were treated
with insulin glargine to a similar target
glucose (#5.3 mmol/L) as we achieved
(21). A median of 3.3 months after in-
sulin discontinuation, a similar duration
of durability as we evaluated, those with
prediabetes randomized to glargine treat-
ment had a 20% reduction in the odds of
developing diabetes on the basis of OGTT
criteria compared with standard care (21).
In adults with recently diagnosed type
2 diabetes, Weng et al. (7) found that up
to 2 weeks of intensive insulin therapy
as either multiple daily injections or con-
tinuous subcutaneous infusion, an even
shorter treatment duration than we
tested, resulted in remission and no
need for diabetes medications 1 year
later in 45% and 51% of participants,
respectively. Furthermore, after the
2-week insulin treatment, the b-cell re-
sponse increased, and this improvement
was sustained in the participants who re-
mained in remission while off medications.

gested benefit from ,2 weeks of insulin

 ORIGIN Trial to maximize the effect of the
insulintreatment.Tofurtherincreasethe
likelihood of insulin having an effect, we
added the oral glucose-lowering agent
metformin shown in the Diabetes Pre-
vention Program to be effective in pre-
venting the development of diabetes in
adults with IGT (6). In contrast to the
adult studies, we found no durable effect
of insulin glargine targeted to achieve a
plasma glucose of 4.4–5.0 mmol/L fol-
lowed by metformin on measures of b-cell
function or glycemia in youth. Further-
more, the lack of a beneficial effect of
metformin alone on b-cell function, even
when youth were still on the medication
at 12 months, contrastswithobservations
after 1 year of therapy in adults with
IGT (5) or type 2 diabetes (22). Although
a longer duration of insulin treatment
may have had more of an effect on b-cell
function, longer-term treatment also
may have led to additional weight gain,
with an uncertain net balance of benefit
and harm. Moreover, the injections and
glucose monitoring required for longer-
term insulin treatment might be met with
resistance by youth, particularly those
who are not yet diagnosed with diabetes.
The RISE Consortium (9) reported
that youth with IGT or recently diag-
nosed, drug-na¨
ıve type 2 diabetes are
profoundly more insulin resistant, have
greater insulin responses for any de-
gree of insulin sensitivity, and have
lower hepatic insulin clearance than
adults. This finding, combined with the
poor response of youth to the RISE
interventions, suggests that although
b-cell dysfunction is the foundation
for dy-sglycemia in both age-groups,
greater b-cell demand may place youth
at a higher risk for more-rapid b-cell
damage. Additional support for this
interpretation comes from the appar-
ently more-rapid progression of type 2
diabetes observed in youth in the TO-
DAY study than in a similar study in
adults treated with the same glucose-
lowering
medications
(2,3).
Further-
more, the current observation of a
lack of a beneficial effect of metformin
on b-cell function in youth after
12 months of therapy contrasts the
improvement in b-cell function ob-
served in adults with IGT (5) or type 2
diabetes (22). The RISE Adult Medica-
tion Study, which includes these same
two intervention arms as part of a four-
arm study, should provide additional
insight into these differences (8).
The current study has several strengths,
including the randomized design and
a robust, multicenter approach to
quantification of insulin sensitivity and
b-cell responses to both glucose and
Figure 2—Glucose and C-peptide values during the hyperglycemic clamp at baseline, after 12 months of treatment, and 3 months after discontinuing
the intervention (15 months). The glargine followed by metformin group (n = 44 [green]) and the metformin alone group (n = 47 [brown]) are shown.
The steady-state glucose targets were 11.1 mmol/L between 90 and 120 min and .25 mmol/L at 150 min. Data are mean 6 SEM.

 nonglucose secretagogue arginine per-
formed to provide thorough, longitudinal
phenotyping of participants. By quan-
tifying both insulin sensitivity and b-cell
responses simultaneously, we were
able to account for the well-recognized
relationship between insulin sensitivity
and b-cell responsivity (15) and thus
gain mechanistic insight into the effect
of the interventions on b-cell function
over time. Of key importance for this
multicenter study, we reached matching
levels of hyperglycemia during each of
three repeated hyperglycemic clamp
tests, showing a high degree of both
reproducibility and reliability for the out-
come measures across time points and
across study sites. Study retention and
metformin adherence also were excellent
despite adolescents presenting a challeng-
ing study population. Limitations include
the absence of a placebo arm because of
the inclusion of youth with type 2 diabetes
who could not remain untreated. Although
a decline in b-cell function might have
been even greater in a placebo group, the
marked decline in b-cell function evident
duringandafterstoppingtheinterventions
suggests that the medications largely were
masking disease progression. In addition,
despite the high reported insulin doses,
50% of the participants in the insulin
glargine followed by metformin arm did
not fully meet the fasting goal of 4.4–
5.0 mmol/L, regardless of IGT or type 2
diabetes status. Of note, adults with pre-
diabetes or type 2 diabetes in the ORIGIN
Trial were treated with insulin glargine to
a target fasting glucose of #5.3 mmol/L,
a slightly less-aggressive target than we
chose, yet we still observed no significant
beneficial effect on b-cell function despite
reaching a mean fasting glucose of 5.2
mmol/L (21). Moreover, after 1 year in the
ORIGIN Trial, only 50% of the adult par-
ticipants achieved the targeted glucose,
similar to the proportion of youth in the
current study, yet positive effects still
were seen on diabetes development in
these adults (21). Finally, the sample size
was too small to obtain reliable estimates
of the effects of the interventions in the
subgroups of IGT versus type 2 diabetes.
However, in a sensitivity analysis of the
subgroup with IGT who had not received
metformin before randomization and com-
prised the majority of participants in each
arm, results were similar to the full cohort
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Specifically, in the
IGT group, treatment with glargine fol-
lowed by metformin did not have a ben-
eficial effect on b-cell function outcomes
compared with metformin alone, and
b-cell function declined within both treat-
ment groups.
In conclusion, neither 3 months of in-
sulin glargine followed by 9 months of
metformin nor 12 months of metformin
alone improved or preserved b-cell func-
tion when administered to youth with IGT
or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. b-
Cell function deteriorated with both treat-
ments, the only treatments approved for
useintype2diabetesinyouth, highlighting
an urgent need foralternate approaches to
preserve b-cell function in youth and pre-
vent the progression of dysglycemia.

responses (steady-state C-peptide and ACPRmax) paired with M/I. Changes are shown from
baseline to 12 and 15 months for the clamp-derived b-cell responses of steady-state C-peptide
(A) and ACPRmax (B) paired with M/I. The black line depicts the joint relationship between
b-cell response and M/I at baseline for the full cohort, with the mean value at baseline for the
full cohort indicated by the black box with a 0. The dotted lines to boxes at months 12 and
15 show the trajectory of values from baseline to 12 months of intervention and then to
3 months after discontinuation of the intervention (15 months) for glargine followed by
metformin (green) and metformin alone (brown). Values above the black line represent
improved b-cell function, and values below the line represent poorer b-cell function. The
ellipses depict the 95% confidence bands around the points at months 12 and 15. No significant
differences were observed at any time point between treatment arms; however, significant
within-group declines were seen from baseline while on active treatment through 12 months
for steady-state C-peptide with M/I (glargine followed by metformin P = 0.019, metformin
alone P = 0.025) and ACPRmax with M/I (glargine followed by metformin P , 0.001, metformin
alone P = 0.001) and through 15 months for steady-state C-peptide with M/I (glargine followed by
metformin P , 0.001, metformin alone P = 0.031) and ACPRmax with M/I (glargine followed by
metformin P = 0.001, metformin alone P , 0.001).
