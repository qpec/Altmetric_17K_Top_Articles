Abstract
To compare lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and to 
identify new drivers of lung carcinogenesis, we examined exome sequences and copy number 
profiles of 660 lung ADC and 484 lung SqCC tumor/normal pairs. Recurrent alterations in lung 
SqCCs were more similar to other squamous carcinomas than to lung ADCs. Novel significantly 
mutated genes included PPP3CA, DOT1L, and FTSJD1 in lung ADC, RASA1 in lung SqCC, and 
KLF5, EP300, and CREBBP in both tumor types. Novel amplification peaks encompassed MIR21 
in lung ADC, MIR205 in lung SqCC, and MAPK1 in both. Lung ADCs lacking receptor tyrosine 
kinase/Ras/Raf alterations revealed mutations in SOS1, VAV1, RASA1, and ARHGAP35. 
Regarding neoantigens, 47% of the lung ADC and 53% of the lung SqCC tumors had at least 5 
predicted neoepitopes. While targeted therapies for lung ADC and lung SqCC are largely distinct, 
immunotherapies may aid in treatment for both subtypes.
 INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of death from cancer around the world1. An 
estimated 221,000 new cases and 158,000 deaths from lung cancer occurred in the United 
States alone in 20152. The two major histological classes are non-small cell lung cancers 
(NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancers (SCLC). NSCLCs are mostly comprised of lung 
adenocarcinomas (ADC) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC). These two NSCLC 
subtypes have both unique and shared clinical and histopathological characteristics. For 
example, while smoking is the major risk factor for both subtypes, approximately 10–15% 
of lung ADCs are observed in never smokers3. Molecularly targeted therapies directed 
against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) lead to dramatic responses in subsets of patients 
with lung ADCs harboring activating genomic alterations in the corresponding kinase genes, 
including EGFR, ALK, and ROS14. Other targeted therapies under current investigation are 
directed against activating alterations in the MET, RET, NTRK1, NTRK2, ERBB2, and 
BRAF kinases4,5.
Recent efforts have focused on comprehensively characterizing the changes found within the 
genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome of lung ADCs and SqCCs in order to 
discover novel cancer driver genes that may be clinically actionable6–8. Identifying novel 
cancer genes can be challenging due to the large number of passenger mutations that can

 accumulate from prolonged exposure to tobacco carcinogens and from inherent mutagenic 
processes such as those caused by the aberrant activity of APOBEC cytidine deaminases9. 
Profiling larger numbers of samples within a tumor type and combining samples across 
tumor types can help overcome this problem, by providing the additional statistical power 
necessary to distinguish important genes mutated at a lower frequency from other genes with 
passenger mutations10. In addition, a comprehensive comparison of recurrently altered genes 
found in lung ADC and SqCC has not been performed. Such analyses may yield insights 
into the similarities and differences in carcinogenesis between the diseases and elucidate the 
degree to which common or distinct targeted and immunologic therapeutic strategies can be 
used to treat each cancer type.
 RESULTS
 Comparison of somatically altered genes
In order to compare the somatic profiles of lung ADC and lung SqCC and to identify novel 
genetic alterations, we studied 660 lung adenocarcinoma/normal paired exome sequences 
(including 274 previously unpublished cases, 227 previously described from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA)6, and 159 cases from the Imielinski et al8 cohort) and 484 lung 
SqCC/normal paired exome sequences (including 308 previously unpublished cases and 176 
previously described from TCGA7; Supplementary Tables 1–4). Similarly to previous 
studies6,7, we observed a median somatic mutation rate of 8.7/Mb and 9.7/Mb for lung 
ADCs and SqCCs, respectively. After excluding genes with lower median expression (6.16 
log2 FPKM for ADCs and 6.27 log2 FPKM for SqCCs; Supplementary Fig. 1; Online 
Methods), we identified 38 genes as significantly mutated in ADC and 20 genes 
significantly mutated in SqCC using MutSig2CV10 (q-value < 0.1; Supplementary Table 
5,6). Only 6 genes, TP53, RB1, ARID1A, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, and NF1, were significantly 
mutated in both tumor types and of these, the frequency of TP53, CDKN2A, and PIK3CA 
mutation was significantly higher in SqCC tumors (p < 0.01; Fisher’s exact test; Figure 1a). 
Likewise, only 11 out of 42 focal amplification peaks were identified as altered in both 
tumor types (Figure 1b), while 13 out of 50 focal deletion peaks were altered in both tumor 
types (Figure 1c). Interestingly, when compared to 19 other tumor types from TCGA10, the 
lists of significantly mutated genes for lung ADC and SqCC had a greater overlap with 
significantly mutated gene lists from other tumor types (>13% overlap; FDR q-value < 0.1) 
than to each other (12% overlap; p = 0.105; Supplementary Fig. 2), consistent with previous 
pan-cancer analyses11. Recurrently mutated and amplified genes in lung SqCC most closely 
resembled the alterations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and bladder 
cancer (BLCA), two other epithelial cancers with epidemiological associations with 
smoking (>25% overlap; Supplementary Fig. 2). Within these overlapping genes, TP53, 
CDKN2A, and FAT1 are specifically enriched in HPV- HNSC12. In contrast, the 
significantly mutated genes in lung ADC were most similar to glioblastoma (GBM) and 
colorectal cancer (CRC) (FDR q-value < 0.1). While lung ADC and lung SqCC did share 
several focal deletion peaks, five of these peaks were putative fragile sites (shown in green in 
Figure 1c). Taken together, these results suggest that the somatic drivers of carcinogenesis 
may be largely distinct between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma.

  Mutational signatures in lung cancer
Various carcinogenic and cancer-related processes contribute to the mutational patterns 
observed in tumors13,14. Previous large-scale studies of lung cancer genomes have identified 
signatures associated with non-smoking and smoking cases6,8,15; here we extend these 
findings based on the improved statistical power of our larger sample set. Using non-
negative matrix factorization13,16 (NMF, Online Methods), we identified six mutational 
signatures in this cohort, many of which are strongly correlated with previously defined 
signatures in the COSMIC database13,17 (Supplementary Figs. 3–5; Supplementary Table 7). 
These included a UV-related signature of C>T at TpCpC or CpCpC (COSMIC Signature 7, 
abbreviated SI7), a smoking-related signature of C>A transversions (SI4), a mismatch repair 
(MMR) signature of C>T at GpCpG (SI15/SI6), two APOBEC-related signatures of C>G or 
C>T at TpCpT or TpCpA (SI13 and SI2), and a final signature with a moderate correlation 
to COSMIC signature 5 (SI5) with putative “molecular clock” properties18 (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). In addition to identifying mutational signatures, NMF also estimates the number of 
mutations contributed by each signature within each tumor. The estimated number of SI4 
(i.e. smoking-related) mutations per Mb displayed a bimodal pattern in lung ADC but not in 
lung SqCC (Figure 2a). Furthermore, the rate of SI4 mutations per Mb was able to classify 
tumors into those from never vs. ever smokers substantially better in lung ADCs 
(AUC=0.87; Supplementary Fig. 6) than in lung SqCCs (AUC=0.62) suggesting that the 
smoking statuses for the 18 never smokers with lung SqCC may be inaccurate. 87% of lung 
ADCs from never smokers were categorized as transversion-low (TV-L; ≤0.696 of SI4 per 
Mb; p = 8.5 × 10−37; Fisher’s exact test; Figure 2b; Supplementary Fig. 6). However, only 
45% of transversion-low lung ADCs were from patients who were never smokers (Figure 
2b). Within each tumor, we also derived the fraction of estimated mutations for a signature 
by dividing the number of estimated mutations for that signature by the sum of estimated 
mutations from all signatures. Lung SqCCs displayed significantly higher overall rates of 
SI5 mutations per Mb compared to all lung ADCs (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). 
However, lung ADCs from never smokers displayed the highest fraction of estimated 
mutations from this signature on average (Figure 2c; Supplementary Fig. 7). In lung SqCC, 
we also observed moderate associations of tumor stage with SI5 activity and total mutation 
rate (p < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 8).
The mutational profiles of three lung SqCCs (~1% of lung SqCCs) exhibited a pattern of 
UV-related mutations (SI7) commonly observed in melanoma and displayed a significantly 
higher mutation rate of somatic single nucleotide variants (SSNVs) and somatic dinucleotide 
polymorphisms (DNPs) compared to the other lung tumors (p < 0.01) but not higher rates of 
indels (p > 0.05; Figure 2d). One of these patients (TCGA-18–3409) had a previous history 
of basal cell carcinoma in the forehead raising the possibility that metastasis from the skin to 
the lung had occurred. The other two lung SqCCs with this signature may also represent 
squamous cell skin carcinomas metastatic to the lung. Mutational profiles for another 7 
tumors (4 lung ADCs and 3 lung SqCCs) exhibited an MMR-like signature (SI15/SI6) 
commonly observed in microsatellite instable (MSI) colorectal carcinomas (Figure 2e)13. 
These tumors had significantly higher rates of both SSNVs and short indels (p < 0.00). They 
also displayed lower expression levels of the mismatch repair gene MLH1 (p = 0.011) 
suggesting a potential etiology for this signature in lung.

  Novel significantly mutated genes
Comparing the significantly mutated genes to other tumor types from the TCGA Pan-Cancer 
study10 revealed that there were several genes significantly mutated exclusively in lung ADC 
including STK11, RBM10, KEAP1, RAF1, RIT1, and MET (MutSig2CV q-value < 0.1; 
Figure 3a; Supplementary Table 5). NFE2L2, KDM6A, RASA1, NOTCH1, and HRAS were 
significantly mutated in lung SqCC but not in other cancer types (excluding HNSC and 
BLCA) (Figure 3b; Supplementary Table 6). Genes that reached modest statistical 
significance in lung ADC that have been observed previously in lung cancer or in other 
tumor types include AKT1 with a recurrent mutation at p.E17K, CDK4 with a recurrent 
mutation at p.R24L, and DNMT3A (p < 0.005; Supplementary Table 5). Novel significantly 
mutated genes exclusive to lung ADC and which are absent in other tumor types include 
PPP3CA, which is the catalytic subunit for the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. 
The mutations in PPP3CA clustered in the autoinhibitory domain near the C-terminus 
suggesting they may be gain-of-fuction alterations (Figure 4a). In addition, mutations in the 
autoinhibitory domain also tended to co-occur with activating KRAS mutations (p = 0.033) 
suggesting a potential relationship between K-Ras and calcineurin signaling pathways. 
Significantly mutated methyltransferase genes included MLL3 (KMT2C) and SETD2. A 
novel gene in this class was the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L, which was mutated in 
3% of lung adenocarcinomas with enrichment for truncating mutations (Figure 4a). 
Recurrent mutations in lung adenocarcinoma have been previously reported in splicing 
factors such as U2AF1 and loss of function mutations in the RNA binding protein RBM108. 
In the current dataset, a cap methyltransferase, FTSJD1 (also known as CMTR2), was 
significantly mutated and enriched for frame shift mutations (Figure 4a). We also examined 
genes for other known proteins in this class and found recurrent mutations in SF3B119 and 
SNRPD3 (Supplementary Fig. 9). EGFR mutations were enriched in females, and 
SMARCA4 mutations were enriched in males (FDR q-value < 0.1; Supplementary Table 8). 
RBM10 mutations were modestly enriched in males as previously reported (q-value = 
0.219)6. Novel significantly mutated genes in lung SqCC that were enriched for frame shift 
mutations (p < 0.001) included RASA1, whose protein product is p120GAP20 (Figure 4b). 
CUL3, whose protein product is a known interaction partner of KEAP1, also reached 
statistical significance in the lung SqCC cohort21 (Figure 4b). RB1 mutations were enriched 
in females, whereas PASK mutations were exclusive to males (FDR q-value < 0.1; 
Supplementary Table 9). We did not observe significant associations between mutation 
status and patient survival or tumor stage after correction for multiple hypothesis testing 
(Supplementary Tables 10–13). Controlling for tumor stage did not reveal additional 
significant associations between mutation status and survival.
Previous studies have shown that joint analysis of different tumor types can yield additional 
statistical power to detect low-frequency events even if the tumor types are from vastly 
different tissues of origin and/or etiologies10. Additionally, although the individual drivers 
may be distinct between two tumor types, pathways such as MAP kinase are often altered 
similarly in both. We therefore hypothesized that combining the lung ADC and SqCC tumor 
cohorts (i.e. Pan-Lung) would reveal additional recurrent somatic pathway alterations 
common to both. We found 14 genes to be significantly mutated in the Pan-Lung cohort but 
not significantly mutated in either individual tumor type (q-value < 0.1; Supplementary Fig. 
Campbell et al.

 10; Supplementary Table 14). Many of these genes are involved in epigenetic regulation or 
immune-related pathways. KLF5, a transcription factor critical for lung development22 
contained a novel recurrent mutation in the zinc finger domain, which was observed in both 
ADCs and SqCCs (Figure 4c). A regulator of KLF5, the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW723, was 
also significantly mutated in the lung SqCC and Pan-Lung cohorts but did not co-occur with 
KLF5 mutations. A super-enhancer duplication associated with increased KLF5 expression 
has also been recently reported in HNSC by our group24. The paralogs EP300 and CREBBP 
had a mutational hotspot region within the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain. All 
missense mutations in the HAT domains and other loss-of-function mutations outside this 
domain were non-overlapping within these two proteins. For sites with sufficient sequencing 
depth in the RNA-seq (power > 95%), we observed a somatic SNV validation rate of 88%.
 Novel somatic copy number alterations
With a larger sample size, we had better resolution to detect novel copy number changes and 
ascertain the putative target genes of focal amplifications and deletions. For some peaks that 
still contained many genes, we inferred the most likely target gene by examining the same 
peak in a Pan-Cancer copy number analysis across 11 tumor types25 that included a subset 
of lung cancers from this set. The most significantly focally amplified genes in lung ADC 
were NKX2-1, MYC, TERT, MCL1, and MDM2 (Figure 5a; Supplementary Table 15), 
while peaks at SOX2, CCND1, WHSC1L1/FGFR1, MYC, and EGFR were among the top 
for lung SqCC (Figure 5b; Supplementary Table 16). Amplification peaks previously 
described in other tumor types but less characterized before in the lung tumors included 
KAT6A, ZNF217, and MYCL1 for lung ADC (Figure 5a) and IGF1R, KDM5A, PTP4A1/
PHF3, and MYCL1 for lung SqCC (Figure 5b). CCND3 was specifically amplified in lung 
ADC while an amplification peak near MIR21/TUBD1 (Figure 5c) was also observed in 
breast cancer25. MIR21 expression has been shown to be a prognostic factor for early stage 
ADC26,27. Likewise, novel amplification peaks for lung SqCC included YES1, a Src family 
non-receptor protein kinase, and MIR205 (Figure 5d). Expression of MIR205 has been used 
to distinguish lung squamous cell carcinomas from other NSCLC types28 suggesting that 
amplification of this microRNA may represent a lineage specific alteration similar to that of 
SOX2 amplification. Finally, combined Pan-Lung copy number analysis revealed additional 
amplification peaks around MAPK1 (Figure 5a–d; Supplementary Table 17).
Focal deletion peaks in lung ADC included the chromatin modifier genes SMARCA4 and 
ARID2 (Supplementary Fig. 11; Supplementary Table 18), which were also significantly 
mutated and enriched for loss-of-function mutations. Novel lung SqCC focal deletions 
observed in other tumor types included ZMYND11, CREBBP, ROBO1, USP22, and 
KDM6A (Supplementary Fig. 11; Supplementary Table 19). B2M (Beta2-microglobulin), a 
component of the MHC complex, was focally deleted in both tumor types, enriched for loss-
of-function mutations in both tumor types (p < 0.01), and was significantly mutated in the 
Pan-Lung analysis (FDR q-value = 0.006). Combined Pan-Lung copy number analysis 
revealed another focal deletion peak around TRAF3 (Supplementary Table 20), which was 
also reported in HNSC12. In general, mRNA expression was significantly associated with 
copy number levels for target genes (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). We did not observe

 substantial batch effects within or across tumor types in both the mRNA expression and 
CNV data (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15).
 Identifying Ras/Raf/RTK drivers in lung ADC
In lung ADC, mutually exclusive alterations have been characterized in members of the 
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/Raf signaling pathways. These alterations are of 
particular interest because of the dramatic responses that have been observed in response to 
RTK inhibitors in clinical trials such as those for lung ADC patients harboring EGFR 
mutation or ALK or ROS1 translocations29. However, many lung ADCs do not exhibit a 
known activating mutation in the pathway raising the possibility that additional genes with 
low frequency somatic events are yet to be identified. To further understand the somatic 
landscape of this pathway, we first characterized alterations among the known pathway 
members and then identified novel genes with mutually exclusive alterations. Novel 
alterations in known pathway genes included a recurrent in-frame-insertion in MAP2K1 and 
a fusion of MET with its neighboring gene, CAPZA2 (Figure 6; Supplementary Table 21)30. 
Previously reported TRIM24-NTRK2 and KIF5B-MET fusions30 were observed in tumors 
without other known activating alterations. Interestingly, another NTRK2 fusion with TP63 
was also found in a lung SqCC (Figure 6; Supplementary Table 21). As observed previously, 
high MET and ERBB2 amplifications were enriched in tumors without other known 
activating alterations in this pathway (p < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 16)6. A single lung 
adenocarcinoma (TCGA-49–4512) contained an activating EGFR kinase domain 
duplication31. By manual review, we found additional canonical mutations in KRAS, EGFR, 
or ERBB2 in 17 tumors and complex indels in EGFR or MET in 11 tumors, some of which 
have been previously reported6,8,32 (Supplementary Table 22).
Lung ADCs that had an activating SSNV, indel, amplification or gene fusion in a known 
RTK/Ras/Raf driver6,33,34 were designated “oncogene positive” (n=418) while the 
remaining lung ADCs were considered “oncogene negative” (n=242). For the purposes of 
this analysis, we did not include NF1-altered tumors in the oncogene positive group as 
mutations in this gene are not entirely mutually exclusive with alterations in other 
Ras/Raf/RTK related genes. To identify additional potential drivers in this pathway, we 
determined if genes that are significantly mutated in any of the MutSig2CV analyses 
(Supplementary Tables 5, 6, and 14) or that are important in regulation of the Ras pathway35 
were enriched in oncogene negative samples using a Fisher’s exact test. In total, 15 genes 
were significantly enriched among oncogene negative samples including known Ras 
pathway members SOS1 and RASA1, and Rho kinase pathway members VAV1 and 
ARHGAP35 (q-value < 0.1; Figure 7a,c; Supplementary Table 23). SOS1 is a guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) bound to the RTK complex and assists in the activation of 
Ras proteins36. Recurrent p.N233Y mutations were observed in the autoinhibitory domain 
(DH) of SOS1 in 4 lung ADCs and the mutation p.D309Y in the same region has been 
reported in Noonan syndrome37,38 (Supplementary Fig. 17). Similarly, VAV1 is a GEF for 
the Rho family GTPases. Interactions between the calponin homology (CH), Acidic (Ac), 
and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are important for autoinhibition of the catalytic Dbl 
homology domain39. The p.S67Y mutation is located near the interface of the CH, Ac and 
PH domains and mutagenesis at this site has been shown to increase overall GEF activity39

 (Supplementary Fig. 17). RASA1 and ARHGAP35 (p190RhoGAP) are GTPase activating 
proteins (GAPs) for the Ras and Rho kinases, respectively, and are each enriched for loss-of-
function mutations (p < 0.01). We also identified amplifications peaks near FGFR1/
WHSC1L1 (8p11.21), PDGFRA/KIT/KDR (4q12), and MAPK1 (chr22q11) that were only 
significant in the oncogene negative tumor set (q-value < 0.25; Figure 7b,c). In total, 499 
(76%) lung ADCs displayed an alteration in known or putative Ras/Raf/RTK driver genes 
(Figure 7c). Moreover, 193 out of 227 (85%) lung ADCs that previously underwent 
secondary expert pathological review and had RNA-seq data available for fusion analysis6 
contained a predicted activating alteration in the RTK/Ras/Raf pathway.
Novel co-occurrences included MET amplifications and NF1 mutations (p = 0.019; 
Supplementary Figure 16). Additionally, high EGFR amplification significantly overlapped 
with activating EGFR mutations (p = 1.9 × 10−8)40,41 and STK11 mutations significantly 
overlapped with activating KRAS mutations (p = 1.1 × 10−6; Figure 7c)42,43. Furthermore, 
28 lung ADCs that remain oncogene-negative for the RTK/Ras/Raf pathway harbor STK11 
mutations (Figure 7c), suggesting the possibility of an additional hitherto-unrecognized 
KRAS-related genome alteration complementary to STK11 mutation in these cancer 
samples.
 Assessment of neoantigen load and recurrence
With increasing interest in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer44,45, we 
comprehensively analyzed the potential immunogenic properties of the mutational 
landscape. Within each patient, we evaluated the ability of each somatic missense mutation 
to be processed and presented to immune cells by any one of the patient-specific HLA 
alleles46,47. We then assessed the association between the number of immunogenic 
mutations (i.e. neoepitopes or neoantigens) and clinical characteristics and identified the 
most common neoepitopes observed in lung cancer. Both nonsynonymous mutation and 
neoepitope counts were not significantly different between lung ADCs and lung SqCCs from 
ever smokers (Figure 8a,b). However, these counts were significantly lower in lung ADCs 
from never smokers compared to lung ADCs from ever smokers (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-
sum test; Figure 8a,b) and associated with overall smoking history in lung ADCs but not 
lung SqCCs (p < 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test; Supplementary Fig. 18). Mutations predicted to 
be neoepitopes in at least 4 tumors included PIK3CA p.E542K, NFE2L2 p.E79Q, BRAF 
p.G466V, and EGFR p.G719A and several mutations in TP53, including p.V157F, p.G154V, 
p.R175G, and p.P278A (Figure 8c). A gene not previously implicated in lung cancer, 
C3orf59 (also known as MB21D2), contained a recurrent mutation at p.Q311E with 
predicted neoepitope properties (Figure 8c). Overall, 47% of lung ADC and 53% of lung 
SqCC samples had at least 5 predicted neoepitopes suggesting a great potential for 
immunotherapy.
 DISCUSSION
We examined exome sequences and copy number profiles of 1,144 lung cancers to explore 
similarities and differences between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell 
carcinoma. Consistent with studies of gene expression11, this comparison showed that both

 mutated genes and recurrent SCNAs are largely distinct between the two lung cancer types. 
The similarity between lung SqCCs, head and neck squamous carcinomas, and a subset of 
bladder carcinomas was also observed when 12 tumor types were reclassified using 
clustering of five molecular data types48. These differences suggest that somatic alterations 
can have different oncogenic potential in different cellular contexts. Thus, cancers arising 
from developmentally similar cells of origin across different tissues will be more similar 
than cancers arising from different cells of origin within an anatomically defined tissue. As 
we had only one tumor sample per patient, we were not able to analyze intra-tumoral 
heterogeneity, as has been done in other studies49,50.
Several novel focal amplification peaks containing protein-coding genes, including MAPK1, 
YES1, and CCND3, were identified. Interestingly, we also found two peaks that contained 
or were near microRNAs (MIR21 in lung ADC and MIR205 in lung SqCC). We have also 
recently reported a non-coding super-enhancer duplication that results in increased MYC 
expression24. As the mutational analyses in this study focused on whole-exome sequencing 
of protein-coding genes, we were not able to examine mutations in non-coding genes or 
regulatory elements. Future studies examining large numbers of lung cancer whole-genomes 
may be better suited for discovery of other oncogenic alterations in non-coding genes or 
regulatory elements.
Our study has uncovered multiple significantly mutated genes in the RTK/Ras/Raf pathway, 
including newly identified genes such as RASA1, SOS1, and VAV1. Previous studies 
examining smaller numbers of lung tumors were not able to detect recurrent mutations in 
SOS18,38. The fact that we were able to detect these mutants further highlights the utility of 
increasing sample size to detect rare events. Since we did not have matching RNA-seq data 
for every tumor, we may be underestimating the rates of oncogenic fusions or MET exon 14 
skipping events. As 15% to 25% of lung ADCs still do not contain a known detectable 
alteration in the RTK/Ras/Raf pathway, we may yet be underpowered to find additional rare 
recurrent mutations in known and novel pathway members. Similar considerations may be 
present for other pathways. For example, we identified new epigenetic modifier mutations in 
CREBBP and EP300, previously shown in small cell lung cancer51.
Finally, we examined the immunogenicity of individual missense mutations to understand 
more fully the association between neoepitope loads, overall nonsynonymous rates, and 
clinical variables such as smoking status. Some highly recurrent mutations were predicted to 
be neoepitopes. Future studies may further unravel the relationship between these candidates 
and clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors and customized vaccine therapies.
 ONLINE METHODS
 Sample collection and pathology review
Sample collection and DNA sequencing were performed for the Imielinski et al and TCGA 
cohorts as previously described6–8. All specimens were obtained from patients with 
appropriate consent and with approval from the relevant institutional review boards. All 
patients were treatment-naïve with the exception of four patients with lung SqCC and three 
with lung ADC who received neoadjuvant treatment prior to resection (Supplementary Table

 2). Initial pathological review was performed at the contributing tissue source sites (TSS) 
where each tumor was given an initial histological classification. After shipment of the 
frozen tissue to the Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR), one or two additional frozen 
sections were cut and stained with H&E to confirm the histological classification of the 
original TSS. 159 of the lung ADCs from Imielinski et al, 289 of the lung ADCs from 
TCGA, and 213 of the lung SqCCs from TCGA had also undergone additional histological 
review by an expert pathology committee led by Dr. William Travis (MSKCC) in previous 
studies6–8. Nucleic acid extraction and molecular quality control were performed at the 
BCR.
 DNA-sequencing, alignment, and mutation calling
Exome capture was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50MB kit 
followed by Illumina paired-end sequencing. Reads were processed using the Picard 
pipeline6. This pipeline utilizes BWA for read alignment, Picard tools for marking 
duplicates, and the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) for realignment around small 
insertions and deletions (indels) as well as base quality recalibration52. Contamination in 
tumor exomes was estimated using ContEst53. Only tumors with <5% contamination, an 
available SNP6.0 array for copy number analysis, and a valid ABSOLUTE54 solution were 
considered in the final analysis. The final sample set included 227 previously described lung 
ADCs from the TCGA6, 274 newly reported lung ADCs from the TCGA, and 159 lung 
ADCs from the Imielinski et al8 cohort, together with 176 previously described lung SqCCs 
from TCGA7, and 308 newly reported lung SqCCs from TCGA. Somatic single nucleotide 
variants (SSNVs) and indels were called using MuTect55 and Indelocator 
(www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/indelocator), respectively. These algorithms compare 
the tumor to the matched normal in order to exclude germline variants. Somatic calls were 
excluded if found in a panel of over 2,900 normal exomes as previously described10. Coding 
mutation patterns can be viewed for individual genes at pubs.broadinstitute.org/panlung.
 Identification of significantly mutated genes
Significantly mutated genes were identified using MutSig2CV which combines p-values 
from tests for high mutational frequency relative to the background mutation rate (pCV), 
clustering of mutations within the gene (pCL), and enrichment of mutations within 
evolutionarily conserved sites (pFN)10. For 660 lung adenocarcinomas, we had 100% power 
to detect genes mutated in 10% of patients and 73% power for genes mutated in 5% of 
patients assuming a mutation rate of 8.7/Mb10. For 484 lung squamous cell carcinomas, we 
had 100% power to detect genes mutated in 10% of patients and 41% power for genes 
mutated in 5% of patients assuming a mutation rate of 9.7/Mb10. In order to reduce the 
number of hypotheses tested in the MutSig2CV analysis, we excluded genes that exhibited 
low expression across tumors with relatively high purity. The median log2 FPKM value for 
each gene was obtained for 185 ADCs or 238 SqCCs which had a purity estimate from 
ABSOLUTE of >50% and available RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. 1). For each tumor 
type, a mixture model of two normal distributions was fit in R using the mclust package 
v4.2. Genes with 95% probability of belonging to the cluster with higher expression were 
considered in the multiple hypothesis correction of the MutSig2CV combined p-values. One 
gene, TRERF1, was excluded from the final results as closer inspection of its mutations

 revealed a recurrent frameshift deletion that was likely a false positive as all of these 
mutations had low allelic fractions (<1.5%) and had no supporting reads in matching RNA-
seq data. A one-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if the proportion of loss-of-
function mutations (including nonsense, frameshift, and de novo start out-of-frame 
mutations) to other mutations for a given gene was significantly higher compared to the 
proportion of loss-of-function mutations to other mutations across all other genes.
 Identification of recurrent copy number changes
DNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays and normalized as previously 
described6. Segmentation was performed using Circular Binary Segmentation algorithm56 
followed by Ziggurat Deconstruction to infer the length and amplitude each segment. 
Recurrent focal SCNA peaks were identified using GISTIC2.057. A peak was considered 
focally amplified or deleted within a tumor if the GISTIC2.0-estimated focal copy number 
ratio was greater than 0.1 or less than −0.1, respectively. Purity and ploidy were estimated 
using ABSOLUTE54. Two peaks were considered the same across tumor types if 1) the 
known target gene of each peak was the same or 2) the genomic location of the peaks 
overlapped +/− 1 Mb and each of the overlapping peaks had less than 25 genes and was 
smaller than 10 Mb.
 RNA sequencing for expression and fusion analyses
Of the 1,144 tumors examined in this study, 495 lung ADCs and 476 lung SqCCs also had 
corresponding RNA-seq data from TCGA. RNA reads were generated, aligned to the hg19 
genome assembly with Mapsplice58, and normalized with RSEM59 to Fragment per 
Kilobase per Million (FPKM) expression estimates as previously described6. Expression 
values less than 1 FPKM were set to 1 and all data were log2 transformed. Exon skipping of 
MET exon 14 was identified with juncBASE60 as previously described6. Lists of fusions 
were obtained from previous studies6,3061. Fusions for additional tumors were identified 
with the PRADA pipeline62. For plotting of exonic expression of fusion transcripts, exon 
expression levels were counted and normalized to reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) as 
previously described6. Expression for an individual exon was first Z-score transformed 
across all tumors within each tumor type. Subsequently, all exons for a gene were Z-score 
transformed again within each tumor. Transcript annotations used for this analysis included 
ENST00000397752 for MET, ENST00000361183 for CAPZA2, ENST00000302418 for 
KIF5B, ENST00000323115 for NTRK2, ENST00000343526 for TRIM24, and 
ENST00000354600 for TP63.
 Identification of mutational signatures
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to deconvolute a K × G matrix of 
mutation catalogues into a K × N matrix of mutational processes and an N × G matrix of 
mutational exposures (where G is the number of lung exomes, K is the number of mutational 
states, and N is the number of estimated mutational processes)16. Code to run NMF was 
obtained from MATLAB Central (see URLs) and run using the nnmf function from the 
MATLAB Statistics Toolbox. We used 6 mutation types with 16 different trinucleotide 
contexts and 2 transcriptional strands for a total of 192 mutational states. The number of 
possible signatures was varied from 1 to 10 and signature stability was assessed via

 bootstrapping as previously described16. Within each tumor, the fraction of estimated 
mutations for a signature was derived by dividing the number of estimated mutations for that 
signature by the sum of estimated mutations from all signatures.
 Predicting Immunogenicity
HLA alleles were called with POLYSOLVER46 for all lung cancer exomes. Within each 
tumor, epitope predictions were made between confidently called alleles and single amino 
acid missense mutations. Separate lists were made consisting of wildtype and mutant 
peptides of length 8, 9, 10 and 11 amino acids since these are the possible peptide lengths 
known to be presented by human MHC class I molecules63. We then predicted MHC 
binding affinity for each of the peptide as described previously47. First, the proteasome 
processing score was calculated using the NetChop program64. Then, we used the 
NetMHC65, NetMHCpan66, SMM67, and SMMPMBEC68 methods to predict the MHC 
binding affinity values for each peptide and used the median affinity value across all 
algorithms as a composite measure of binding strength. We also defined the neoepitope ratio 
for each mutant-wildtype peptide pair as the mutant median affinity value divided by 
wildtype median affinity value. This value was found to be a reliable comparator of the 
relative immunogenicities of the mutant versus wildtype peptide sequences47. Peptide pairs 
were further considered if the mutant peptide displayed a processing score ≥0.7, a median 
affinity value ≥0.01, a neoepitope ratio ≥1, and the mRNA transcript of the gene was 
expressed in the RNA-seq data for that tumor (top 15,000 expressed genes within each 
tumor). Since epitope binding is HLA-dependent, the previous steps were performed for 
each of the called MHC-I alleles. After that, only those peptides predicted to be the best 
epitopes for each mutation were considered.
 Statistical comparisons
Nonparametric tests such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (comparison between 2 groups) or 
the Kruskal-Wallis test (comparison between more than two groups) were used for 
continuous variables unless otherwise noted. The Fisher’s exact test was used when 
comparing 2 categorical variables. In total, longitudinal data on survival were available for 
481 patients with lung ADC and 473 patients with lung SqCC from TCGA. The Cox 
proportional hazards model was used to examine associations between patient survival and 
mutation status, with and without controlling for stage. Correction for multiple hypothesis 
testing was performed with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

 Figure 1. Distinct somatic alterations in lung ADC and SqCC
(a) The MutSig2CV algorithm10 was used to identify significantly mutated genes across 660 
lung ADCs and 484 lung SqCCs. Genes with q-values < 0.1 were considered significant. 
The q-value for each gene in the lung ADC cohort is plotted against its respective q-value in 
the lung SqCC cohort. The majority of significantly mutated genes were unique to either 
tumor type. The GISTIC2.0 algorithm was used to identify significantly recurrent copy 
number gains and losses. The q-values for (b) amplifications and (c) deletions in the lung 
ADC cohort are plotted against the q-values in the lung SqCC cohort. Peaks with q-values <

 Figure 2. Comparison of mutational signatures in lung cancer
Six mutational signatures were identified using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on 
192 distinct mutation types. (a) The estimated number of SI4 (smoking-related) mutations 
per Mb within each tumor displayed a bimodal pattern in lung ADC (red). (b) Lung ADCs 
categorized as transversion-low (TV-L) were enriched in clinically-annotated life-long never 
smokers (p = 8.5 × 10−37). (c) The estimated number of mutations for each signature per Mb 
(top) or the fraction of estimated mutations for each signature (bottom) was averaged across 
life-long never smokers (NS), longer-term former smokers (LFS), shorter-term former

 smokers (SFS), and current smokers (CS) for both lung ADCs and lung SqCCs (excluding 
UV-High and MMR-High tumors discussed below). (d) Three lung SqCCs had a high 
number of estimated mutations from a UV-associated signature commonly observed in 
melanoma. These tumors displayed a significantly higher overall rate of SSNVs and DNPs 
compared to all other lung tumors (p < 0.01). (e) Mutational profiles for another 7 tumors 
exhibited an MMR-like signature commonly observed in MSI colorectal carcinomas. These 
tumors had significantly higher rates of both SSNVs and short indels (p < 0.001), as well as 
lower levels of MHL1 expression (p = 0.011). Asterisks indicate significance level from a 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Boxplots show median 
(middle bar), 1st quartile (bottom of box), 3rd quartile (top of box). Boxplot whiskers demark 
1.5 times the interquartile range or minimum/maximum value.

 Figure 3. Significantly mutated genes in lung cancer compared to other cancer types
(a) The q-value for each significantly mutated gene in the lung ADC cohort is plotted 
against the best q-value for the same gene from 19 other tumor types from a Pan-Cancer 
study10. (b) The q-values from the lung SqCC cohort were similarly compared to the other 
tumor types excluding head and neck squamous cell (HNSC) and bladder urothelial 
carcinomas (BLCA). Size of the point is proportional to the frequency of mutations in the 
gene. The color of the point indicates enrichment for mutation clustering defined by 
MutSig2CV (−log10 pCL) and/or enrichment for loss-of-function mutations (−log10 p-value 
from a Fisher’s exact test, Online Methods). Black circles in the lower quadrant indicate 
genes significant in another cancer type but not in lung ADC and/or lung SqCC.

 Figure 4. Novel significantly mutated genes in lung cancer
Mutation profiles of novel genes specific to each lung tumor type include (a) PPP3CA, 
DOT1L, and FTSJD1 in lung ADC and (b) RASA1 and CUL3 in lung SqCC. (c) Combined 
analysis of both tumor types (Pan-Lung) revealed additional significantly mutated genes 
with hotspots including KLF5 and two paralogs, EP300 and CREBBP.

 Figure 5. Significant amplifications in lung cancer
(a) The q-value for amplifications in lung ADC are plotted against the best q-value for the 
same gene across 9 other non-lung tumor types25. (b) The q-values for amplifications in 
lung SqCC are compared against 7 other tumor types excluding HNSC and BLCA. Size of 
the point is proportional to the frequency of focal alterations. Brackets around gene names 
indicate that the most likely target gene was inferred from Pan-Cancer copy number analysis 
across 11 tumor types or from the combined Pan-Lung copy number analysis. Black circles 
in the lower quadrant indicate genes significantly altered in another cancer type but not in

 Figure 6. Fusions in MET and NTRK2
Two fusions in MET were identified which retained the receptor tyrosine kinase domain 
including one with its neighboring gene, CAPZA2. This fusion mostly likely arose via 
tandem duplication resulting in the 3’ end of MET being fused with the 5’ end of CAPZA2. 
Previously reported TRIM24, NTRK2 and KIF5B-MET fusions30 were observed in lung 
ADCs without other known Ras/Raf/RTK activating alterations. Another NTRK2 fusion 
with TP63 was also found in a lung SqCC. The expression of exons retained in the putative 
fusion transcript was relatively higher than the expression of exons not in the putative fusion 
transcript (as indicated by the grey box).

 Figure 7. Novel alterations in the Ras/Raf/Rho/RTK pathway in lung ADC
Lung ADCs were classified as “oncogene positive” if they contained a known activating or 
recurrent alteration in previously characterized pathway members and classified as 
“oncogene negative” otherwise. (a) Mutations from 15 genes (red points) were significantly 
enriched among oncogene negative tumors (Fisher’s exact test; FDR q-value < 0.1; 
Supplementary Table 23). A log odds ratio (LOR) greater than zero indicates that the 
frequency of mutations was higher in the oncogene negative set. (B) Significant 
amplification peaks near FGFR1/WHSC1L1, PDGFRA/KIT/KDR, and MAPK1 were only

mutation plot for known and novel activators of this pathway. Tumors were considered to 
have high amplification for a given gene if they had a total log2 copy number ratio greater 
than 1. For genes with gain-of-function SSNVs or indels, only recurrently mutated sites or 
sites with previous experimental functional evidence are included. Novel oncogene negative 
enriched genes that are members of the Ras/Raf/Rho/RTK pathway are indicated with red 
labels in all panels.

 Figure 8. Neoepitope load in lung cancer
The immunogenicity of each missense mutation was predicted after inferring HLA alleles 
within each tumor with available RNA-seq data (n=971). (a) Nonsynonymous mutation 
counts and (b) neoepitope counts were not significantly different between ever smokers from 
lung ADCs and lung SqCCs (p > 0.05). However, these counts were significantly lower in 
lung ADCs from never smokers compared to lung ADCs from ever smokers (p < 0.001). (c)
