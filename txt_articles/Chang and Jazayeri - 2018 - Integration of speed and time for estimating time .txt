To coordinate movements with events in a dynamic environment
the brain has to anticipate when those events occur. A classic
example is the estimation of time to contact (TTC), that is, when an
object reaches a target. It is thought that TTC is estimated from
kinematic variables. For example, a tennis player might use an
estimate of distance (d) and speed (v) to estimate TTC (TTC = d/v).
However, the tennis player may instead estimate TTC as twice the
time it takes for the ball to move from the serve line to the net line.
This latter strategy does not rely on kinematics and instead com-
putes TTC solely from temporal cues. Which of these two strategies
do humans use to estimate TTC? Considering that both speed and
time estimates are inherently uncertain and the ability of the hu-
man brain to combine different sources of information, we hypoth-
esized that humans estimate TTC by integrating speed information
with temporal cues. We evaluated this hypothesis systematically
using psychophysics and Bayesian modeling. Results indicated that
humans rely on both speed information and temporal cues and in-
tegrate them to optimize their TTC estimates when both cues are
present. These findings suggest that the brain’s timing mechanisms
are actively engaged when interacting with dynamic stimuli.

M
ovements of our body and of objects around us create
temporal events that demand our attention and command
appropriate behavioral responses. For example, to catch a
bouncing ball one must determine the moment the ball reaches
the hand. To capture a tennis shot on camera one must antici-
pate the moment the ball reaches the racket. To catch an es-
caping prey the predator has to determine the time of the final
leap. To shoot a flying disk one must estimate the moment to
pull the trigger. Anticipating and reacting to such movement-
related temporal events require an ability to estimate time to
contact (TTC), that is, the time when a moving entity reaches
a target location.
How does the brain estimate TTC? Early studies hypothesized
that humans rely on variables derived from an object’s visual
angle and its rate of expansion on the retina, of which the so-
called tau is a classic example (1–3). Later, this proposal was
deemed inadequate as it failed to capture many empirical ob-
servations (4–17). Most current theories posit that TTC estima-
tion
results
from
computations
that
rely
on
kinematic
information (4–17). Specifically, it is assumed that the brain uses
information about distance, speed, and acceleration to de-
termine when an object reaches a designated target point. In this
view, if we denote the distance by d and assume that the object
moves with constant speed, v, TTC can be derived as TTC = d/v.
This seems like a natural solution and matches our intuition of
how to compute time from kinematic variables. However, the
algorithms the brain uses for computing TTC need not match
what is taught in physics classrooms. Here, we asked whether
humans solely rely on kinematics (e.g., speed and distance) or if
they additionally rely on temporal cues.
We use an example to demonstrate the potential relevance of
temporal cues as an independent source of information for es-
timating TTC. Imagine catching an approaching bouncing ball.
At first glance it may seem that TTC can be readily inferred from
kinematic variables and equations without any need to explicitly
estimate when the ball bounces. However, if estimates of speed
and position are unreliable, for example when it is too dim to see
the ball, one may infer TTC from the temporal structure of the
sounds the ball makes upon bouncing off the ground. This ex-
ample highlights a general and unresolved question in sensori-
motor processing: When estimating TTC, do we rely solely on
kinematic equations, or do we additionally rely on timing in-
formation that can be derived from positional information as-
sociated with moving objects (Fig. 1)?
Several decades of research in human psychophysics suggest
that humans estimate behaviorally relevant variables by in-
tegrating information from multiple modalities (18–21). For
example, to estimate the size of an object, humans optimally
combine visual and tactile information (19), and to reach for an
object, subjects combine uncertain spatial cues with prior expec-
tation (18). With these considerations in mind, we hypothesized
that humans estimate TTC by combining kinematic variables
derived from visual information (e.g., speed) with estimates of
elapsed time derived from the times when an object appears at
different locations (e.g., the time it takes for an object to move
from one point in space to another). However, testing this hy-
pothesis is challenging because when an object moves between
two points the brain can either directly estimate speed from vi-
sual motion (22–24), or it may infer speed from measuring the
time it takes for the object to move between various locations
along the movement path.
Significance
Existing theories suggest that reacting to dynamic stimuli is
made possible by relying on internal estimates of kinematic
variables. For example, to catch a bouncing ball the brain relies
on the position and speed of the ball. However, when kine-
matic information is unreliable one may additionally rely on
temporal cues. In the bouncing ball example, when visibility is
low one may benefit from the temporal information provided
by the sound of the bounces. Our work provides evidence that
humans rely on such temporal cues and automatically integrate
them with kinematic information to optimize their perfor-
mance. This finding reveals a hitherto unappreciated role of
the brain’s timing mechanisms in sensorimotor function.

 To investigate the complementary role of speed and timing
mechanisms we designed a series of experiments in which we
varied the temporal structure between visible and occluded
segments of the path to systematically manipulate the reliability
of the speed and the temporal information independently (Fig.
2). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that subjects in-
tegrated temporal information that is available during both vis-
ible and occluded segments of the path with speed information
that is only available during the visible segment to improve their
estimate of TTC. To better understand the nature of the un-
derlying computations we compared subjects’ behavior to that of
an ideal Bayesian observer who optimally integrates speed and
timing information. Similar to work in other sensorimotor do-
mains (18–21, 25–38), the model was able to accurately capture
subjects’ estimation strategy, indicating that humans efficiently
integrate prior statistics with measurements of both speed and
elapsed time. These results highlight a hitherto unappreciated
function of the brain’s capacity to utilize time—independent of
speed—to inform sensorimotor function while interacting with
dynamic stimuli.
Results
We first describe the general task design that we employed for all
of the experiments (Fig. 2). On each trial, subjects held their
gaze on a fixation point (FP) at the center of the screen (XFP = 0)
throughout the trial and viewed one stimulus to the left of FP
(XInit) and another to the right of FP (XTar). After a random
delay, a bar began to move horizontally from XInit toward XTar
with a fixed speed, v. In each trial, v was sampled from a discrete
uniform prior distribution with five values ranging between 8°
and 16°/s (Fig. 2D). Subjects had to press a button the moment
the bar reached XTar.
We tested subjects in three conditions (Fig. 2 A–C). In the first
condition the bar was initially visible and then occluded. The
visible segment extended from XInit to a transition point, denoted
by Xtran. The subsequent occluded segment extended from Xtran
to XTar. The distance of the visible and occluded segments were
denoted by d1 and d2, respectively, and added up to the full
length of the movement path (L). We refer to this condition as
V-O (visible-occluded; Fig. 2A). In the second condition, the
moving bar was occluded throughout the path but the position of
the bar was flashed at XInit and at FP. We refer to this condition
by O-F-O (occluded-flashed-occluded; Fig. 2B). In the third
condition, the bar was initially visible and was additionally
flashed when it reached FP. We refer to this condition by V-F-O
(visible-flashed-occluded; Fig. 2C).
Exp. 1: TTC Estimation Benefits from Explicit Timing Cues. In the first
experiment, the path was 16°, and XInit and XTar were located
symmetrically at a distance of 8° to the left and right of FP. In
this experiment, subjects were tested in all three conditions (i.e.,
V-O, O-F-O, and V-F-O). As described by the space of hypoth-
eses in Fig. 1, in conditions in which the moving bar is visible
(V-O and V-F-O) subjects could adopt one of two strategies to
perform the task. First, they could decide when to press the
button by relying on an estimate of the bar’s speed, ^
v (hat de-
notes subjective estimate), derived from visual motion. We refer
to this as the speed strategy (Fig. 1, speed strategy). Alterna-
tively, subjects could rely on timing information to perform the
task. For example, in the V-O condition they could derive an
estimate of the duration of the visible segment b
t1 (hat denotes
subjective estimate) and scale it by the ratio of the distance be-
tween the occluded and visible segments (d2/d1). We refer to this
as the timing strategy (Fig. 1, timing strategy). This timing
strategy can also be used in the V-F-O condition and is the only
strategy that can be used in the O-F-O condition, in which no
explicit visual cue about speed is present.
Our aim was to compare behavior in these conditions to assess
whether subjects combine both strategies to compute TTC (Fig.
1, integration strategy). To quantify behavior, we compared the
time it took for the bar to go from FP to XTar, which we refer to
as actual TTC (TTCa = XTar/v) to the subjects’ produced TTC
(TTCp). In the V-F-O and O-F-O conditions, in which the bar
was flashed at FP, we defined TTCp as the interval between the
flash at FP and button press. In the V-O condition, quantification
of TTCp was less straightforward because the bar was not flashed
at FP. In this condition we first measured the interval between
Xtran and button press and then scaled that interval by the ratio of
XTar to the occluded distance (XTar/d2). This method of esti-
mating TTCp for the V-O condition assumes that the internal
estimate of the speed after Xtran remains relatively stable.
As evident from the TTCp pattern for a typical subject (Fig.
3A), subjects were able to perform the task in all three conditions
with different degrees of sensitivity. TTCp values were variable
and exhibited a characteristic regression to the mean in which the
average TTCp for each TTCa was systematically biased away from
the identity line and toward the mean of the average TTCa
(750 ms). As numerous previous experiments have demonstrated,
this bias toward the mean is indicative of a Bayesian estimation
strategy in which subjects reduce uncertainty associated with their
sensory measurements (of speed and/or time) by using their
knowledge about the prior statistics of TTCa (19, 21, 25–38).
We quantified this regression using a BIAS term that quan-
tifies the overall deviation from the identity line (Materials and
Methods). When measurements are accurate, responses would be
on average unbiased (i.e., near the identity line), and the cor-
responding BIAS would be small. However, when measurements

General task design and space of hypotheses for estimating TTC.
(A) An illustration of the task design we used for investigating how subjects
estimate TTC. A bar moves along a path that is divided into two segments, a
first segment of length d1 where the bar is visible (orange arrow) and a
second segment of length d2 where the bar is occluded (gray rectangle). The
bar moves at speed v, and the time it takes for it to reach the occluded
segment is t1 = d1/v. (B) Three alternative strategies a subject can use to
estimate the time it takes for the bar to get to the end of the occluded
segment, which we denote as TTC. (Left) The relevant stimulus variables for
estimating TTC are the distances of the two segments (d1 and d2), speed of
the bar (v), and the visible duration (t1). (Middle) To estimate TTC, one has to
rely on measured stimulus variables, which are denoted by subscript m (vm,
tm, d1m, and d2m). (Right) Three alternative strategies for estimating TTC.
Speed strategy: Subjects estimate TTC by combining information about the
occluded distance and the measured speed, that is, f(vm, d2m). Timing
strategy: Subjects measure the visible duration and estimate TTC by com-
bining this timing cue with information about the distance of the two
segments, that is, f(vm, d1m, d2m). Integration strategy: Subjects combine
both speed and timing cues to compute a more accurate estimate of TTC,
that is, f(vm, tm, d1m, d2m). The key variables that distinguish between
strategies (vm, tm) are shown in red.

 are highly noisy we expect stronger regression to the means and
larger BIAS values. In our dataset there was significant BIAS in
all conditions. The magnitude of BIAS was significantly smaller
in the V-F-O condition compared with both the V-O condition
(t198 = 26.6435, P < 0.001, Hedges’ g = 3.7537) and the O-F-O
condition (t198 = 27.4602, P < 0.001, Hedges’ g = 3.8687) (Fig.

and was significant across subjects (Wilcoxon one-side signed-

Behavioral task conditions. (A) V-O condition. (Top) Schematic illustration of the V-O condition in which a bar moves along a path that is divided to
two segments, a visible segment extending from an initial point (XInit) to a transition point (Xtran) and an occluded segment (i.e., invisible) from Xtran to a
target point (XTar). (Bottom) Trial structure for the V-O condition. Subjects were asked to fixate at the central fixation point (gray circle). Afterward, a bar
(blue) moved from XInit to the left of the fixation point (white circle) to XTar to the right of the fixation point (white vertical line). The bar was visible initially
and occluded afterward (Top). Subjects had to press a key when they judged the moving bar to have arrived at XTar. When responses were sufficiently
accurate (Materials and Methods), the moving bar and the target bar both turned green (shown). Otherwise, they both turned red (not shown). (B) O-F-O

experiments where we tested the O-F-O condition the distance between the two flashes was varied. (Bottom) Trial structure for the O-F-O condition in the
same format as A. The example trial shows a case where the flashed position coincided with the fixed point, corresponding to the design in Exp. 1. In this
example the feedback is shown as red, indicating a hypothetical trial where the response was too early. (C) V-F-O condition. This condition includes both an
initial visible segment (from XInit to Xtran) and a flashed position some time after the visible segment (black circle). In experiments where we tested the V-F-O
condition the flashed position was always in the middle of the segment. (Bottom) Trial structure for the V-F-O condition in the same format as A. (D) Prior
distribution of the bar speed (v). Speed was fixed in each trial but was sampled from a discrete uniform distribution ranging between 8–16°/s across trials.

 (speed and possibly timing) with the additional explicit timing
cue provided by the flash at FP to reduce uncertainty.
Although BIAS provides an overall estimate of deviations
from veridical TTCa, it does not specify the direction of bias. In
other words, both positive and negative biases would lead to an
overall increase in BIAS. To ensure that the direction of bias in
the data was consistent with a regression toward the mean (i.e.,
overestimation of small TTCa and underestimation of large
TTCa), we additionally quantified the relationship between
TTCp and TTCa using linear regression. In all conditions the
slope of the regression was significantly smaller than unity, in-
dicating that the BIAS was indeed consistent with the hypothe-
sized regression to the mean (Fig. S4).
While this result is consistent with subjects integrating the two
cues, it is also possible that the flashed stimulus at FP was not
used as an explicit timing cue, and instead was used to simply
reset the internal estimate of the position of the bar along the
path. To test this possibility, we tested a subset of subjects in a
cue conflict version of the V-F-O condition in which the flash at
FP occurred either at the correct time (i.e., when the bar reached
FP), 100 ms too early, or 100 ms too late (Fig. S1). This exper-
imental manipulation enabled us to distinguish between multiple
hypotheses.
H1: Position-reset hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, at the
time of flash subjects reset the position of the bar to the location of
FP without changing their estimate of the speed of the bar and
without using the time of the flash as an additional cue. Since we
quantified TTCp from the time of the flash to the button press, we
should see no change in the relationship between TTCp and TTCa.
Note that this hypothesis was not explicitly considered in Fig. 1.
H2: Speed-only hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, subjects
ignore the flashed stimuli entirely and therefore TTCp measured
with respect to the time of flash would be shifted by the same
amount as the jitter but in the opposite direction. In other words,
TTCp should increase by 100 ms when the flash was presented
100 ms too early and decrease by the same amount when the
flash was presented 100 ms too late. The original experiment
already rejects this hypothesis since there were clear differences
between subjects’ performance in the V-O and V-F-O conditions.
However, the results from the jitter experiments could further
validate the importance of the external timing cue. This hy-
pothesis is referred to as the speed strategy in Fig. 1.
H3: Timing-only hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, subjects
only rely on the timing cues and ignore the opportunity to esti-
mate speed from the visual segment of the path. If subjects were
only using the time of the flash to estimate TTC, the average
TTCp should be shifted exactly by the same duration as the jitter
and in the same direction. Therefore, TTCp should decrease by
100 ms when the flash was presented 100 ms too early and in-
crease by the same amount when the flash was presented 100 ms
too late. Again, the original experiment already rejects this hy-
pothesis since there were clear differences between performance
in the V-F-O and V-O conditions. However, we expected the re-
sults of the cue conflict experiments to also reject this hypothesis.
This hypothesis is referred to as the timing strategy in Fig. 1.
H4: Cue-integration hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the jit-
tered flash time would alter the timing-based evidence and would
therefore cause a concomitant bias in TTCp. Importantly, how-
ever, this bias should be less than the size of the jitter (i.e., less
than 100 ms) since temporal cues only serve as part of the in-
formation that guides subjects’ behavior (the other part being the
speed information gleaned from the visual segment of the path).
This hypothesis is referred to as the integration strategy in Fig. 1.
We found that TTCp changed significantly in the presence of
jittered flashes (t test, P < 0.001 for subjects JT, CN, and BS and
P = 0.377 for subject MD), which rejected H1 and H2, and that
the overall shift in TTCp was significantly smaller than 100 ms
(t test, P < 0.001 for all subjects), rejecting H3 (Fig. S1). To-
gether with the main results of Exp. 1, the observations indicate
that subjects integrated both speed and explicit timing informa-
tion to estimate TTC.
Exp. 2: TTC Estimation Benefits from Implicit Timing Cues. The per-
formance improvement in V-F-O compared with V-O and O-F-O
demonstrated that humans benefited from an explicit timing cue
provided by the flash at FP. This raises the intriguing possibility
that humans utilize timing information even if it is not in the
form of an explicit flashed position. For example, it may be the
case that even in the V-O condition where there are no flashed
stimuli subjects determine when to press the button by combin-
ing two cues, one coming from speed information (e.g., XTar/v)
and the other from scaling the duration of the visible segment
(t1) by the ratio of the occluded to visible segments (d2/d1). The
former follows directly from kinematic equations (e.g., “if speed
is doubled, it would take half as long”), and the latter derives
from an ability to scale time intervals (e.g., “if distance is dou-
bled, it should take twice as long”).
To validate if such implicit temporal cue is used for estimating
TTC, we designed a variant of the V-O condition in which we
varied the ratio of the visible and occluded segments (d1 and d2,
respectively). We reasoned that when the visible and occluded
intervals have the same duration, subjects would find the timing
information more reliable and give it more weight for estimating
TTC. However, since our objective was to assess the importance
of implicit timing, we needed to make sure that varying the vis-
ible segments would not cause an appreciable change in the
subjects’ estimate of speed. Therefore, we first designed an ex-
periment to quantify how changes in the visible segment influ-
ence the accuracy of subjects’ speed estimate (Fig. S2).
The experiment was a variant of the V-O condition in which we
changed the length of the visible segment parametrically from
0.625° to 5° in log scale while keeping the occluded distance fixed
at 8° (XTar = 8°). We found that performance quantified in terms
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) improved significantly as the
visible lengths increased from 0.625° to 1.25° (paired-sample t test,
t399 = 56.61, P < 0.001) and saturated afterward (paired-sample
t test, t399 = 0.9031, P = 0.3670). In other words, the fidelity of the
speed estimate saturated at a visible length of 1.25°.
We then tested subjects’ behavior in the V-O condition in a
separate experiment where we varied the ratio of the visible and
occluded segments while keeping the visible length longer than
the empirically observed saturation point of 1.25°. This ensured
that any change in performance could not be attributed to an
improvement or degradation of speed estimates and must there-
fore reflect a capacity to measure and scale time intervals. We
tested subjects’ performance in three conditions. In all conditions
the occluded length was fixed (d2 = 8°). Across conditions the
ratio of the occluded to visible length (d2/d1) was varied by a gain
factor (G = d2/d1). The three gain factors were 0.667, 1, and 1.6.
Fig. 4 A and B show the performance of a typical subject in the
three conditions. Notably, the best performance was not associated
with G = 0.667 when the visible length was longest. Instead, RMSE
was smallest when the visible and occluded lengths were equal
(G = 0.667, t198 = 20.3981, P < 0.001, Hedges’ g = 2.9308; G = 1.6,
t198 = 22.9261, P < 0.001, Hedges’ g = 3.2299), which we refer to as
the temporal identity condition. The same was true across subjects
(Fig. 4C; Wilcoxon one-side signed-rank test, statistics = 28, P <
0.01), revealing a systematic and consistent improvement of per-
formance in the identity condition (i.e., when G = 1).
The same subjects were also tested in the O-F-O condition,
and for the same three gain values. As evident from the behavior
of the same typical subject, RMSE was smaller when the two
segments (i.e., before and after the flash) were the same (Fig. 4
D and E) compared with when the first segment before the flash
was longer (G = 0.667, t198 = 29.7316, P < 0.001, Hedges’ g =
4.1887) or shorter (G = 1.6, t198 = 25.6390, P < 0.001, Hedges’

 g = 3.6122). This effect was present across subjects (Fig. 4F;
Wilcoxon one-side signed-rank test, statistics = 28, P < 0.01),
indicating that temporal identity helped subjects improve their
estimate of TTC.
One potential concern in the case of G = 1 is that subjects may
have detected that the two segments were temporally identical
and switched to a purely timing strategy. To evaluate this pos-
sibility we compared subjects’ performance in the V-O and O-F-
O conditions in the specific case when the two segments are
identical (Fig. S3). If subjects were only relying on a timing
strategy, we would expect subjects’ performance in these two
conditions to be the same (since both have the timing in-
formation with G = 1). However, if the presence of G = 1 only
serves to make the timing cue more reliable, we would expect
performance to be better in the V-O condition since that con-
dition provides the additional speed-dependent information.
We found that RMSE was consistently and significantly
smaller in the V-O condition (Wilcoxon one-side signed-rank
test, statistics = 3, P < 0.001), ruling out the hypothesis that
G = 1 motivated subjects to abandon the speed information and
rely only on the identity temporal structure. These results suggest
that subjects exploited the temporal structure in addition to
speed cue to improve their performance.
One question that we did not address in this experiment is why
G = 1 provides a more reliable timing cue. While it is not sur-
prising that reproducing a time interval may be more reliable
than producing an interval that is scaled by an arbitrary gain
factor, a detailed quantification of this factor requires additional
experiments. However, our results are fully consistent with a
recent study (39) that demonstrated that mental transformation
of time intervals (i.e., multiplication by a gain) increases noise
levels and reduces the reliability of timing cues.
Exp. 3: TTC Estimation Improves with Temporal Identity. Exp.
2 clearly demonstrated that TTC estimation was most accurate
when the visible and occluded segments of the path were iden-
tical. This is consistent with our hypothesis that performance
benefited from temporal identity (i.e., G = 1). However, it is also
possible that when the visible and occluded segments are the
same length (d1 = d2) performance improves because subjects
can estimate the distances more accurately. In other words, it
may be that subjects benefited from distance identity (same
lengths) and not temporal identity (same durations). This seems
unlikely given that d2 was fixed throughout all experiments.
Nonetheless, we conducted an additional experiment to assess
which of the two properties helped subjects in estimating TTC.
Since distance and duration are related through speed, the
only way to dissociate the two is to make the speed of the bar
differ between the visible and occluded parts of the path.
Therefore, we designed a variant of the V-O condition in which,
unbeknownst to the subjects, the speed of the bar behind the
occluder was made 1.25 times faster than the speed in the visible
portion (Fig. 5A). The nonidentical speed ratio enables us to
create conditions in which the distance and temporal identity
were dissociated. In one condition, the visible and occluded
distances were the same but the corresponding durations were
not. We refer to this condition as the distance identity condition
(Gd = 1, Gt = 0.8). In another condition, we matched the ratio of
the distances to the ratio of the speeds so that the corresponding

for three G values, G = 0.667 (green), G = 1 (red), and G = 1.6 (blue). Since the bar moved at a constant speed throughout each trial, the gain also reflected the

 durations were the same. We refer to this condition as the
temporal identity condition (Gt = 1, Gd = 1.25).
New subjects were recruited for this experiment to ensure that
sensitivity to temporal identity could not be attributed to expo-
sure to previous experiments. Since subjects were not aware of
the speed change behind the occluder, they could only adjust
their performance based on feedback. We compared subjects’
performance between the Gd = 1 and Gt = 1 conditions. We
reasoned that an observer that relies on the distance identity
should have better performance (lower RMSE) in the Gd =
1 condition. In contrast, an observer that relies on the temporal
identity would have a lower RMSE in the Gt = 1 condition de-
spite the fact that the distances between the visible and occluded
parts are not the same.
We found that RMSE was lower for the temporal identity
compared with the distance identity condition as shown for a typical
subject (Fig. 5 B and C; t198 = 25.6431, P < 0.001, Hedges’ g =
3.6127) and across subjects (Wilcoxon one-side signed-rank test,
statistics = 34, P < 0.05). This finding further substantiates our
conclusion that subjects benefit from temporal identity. We note
that this experiment does not rule out a potential complementary
role for distance identity, but it reveals the importance of tem-
poral structure in estimating TTC.
Bayesian Integration of Speed and Time Explains Performance of TTC
Estimation. Exps. 1–3 established that subjects rely on both speed
and timing strategies to estimate TTC. Another salient feature of
subjects’ behavior across all conditions was the regression to the
mean of TTCp across the range of TTCa. This was true for the
external timing cue conditions in Exp. 1, for the implicit timing
condition in Exp. 2, and in the control condition in Exp. 3. This
observation suggests that, in addition to speed and timing in-
formation, subjects rely on their prior knowledge of the range of
TTCa they encounter in the experiment. Following previous
work (38), we hypothesized that the subjects’ responses may
follow the prediction of a Bayesian model that optimally inte-
grates both the speed and timing measurements with the prior
distribution (Materials and Methods) (Fig. 6A).
To test this hypothesis rigorously we developed a Bayesian
observer model to explain subjects’ behavior in the V-O condi-
tion. The observer model combined two conditionally indepen-
dent measurements from the visible segment of the path, one
associated with the speed of the bar (vm) and another associated
with the duration of the first visible segment (t1m). Following
previous work, we assumed that these measurements were sub-
ject to scalar variability (28, 40–43). In particular, we assumed
that the SD of noise on speed scaled with the bar’s speed (v) with
constant of proportionality (wmV) and SD of noise on elapsed
time scaled with visible duration (t1) with constant of pro-
portionality (wmT). The ideal observer first computes the pos-
terior from the product of the prior, p(t1), the likelihood of the
bar speed, λ(vmjv), and the likelihood of the visible duration,
λ(t1m jt1), and then uses the mean of the posterior as the optimal
estimate of TTC (TTCe in Fig. 6). In other words, TTCe corre-
sponds to the so-called Bayes-least-squares (BLS) estimate. To
compare the model to subjects’ behavior we augmented the ideal
observer with a production stage by adding scalar noise to the
TTCe with constant of proportionality (wp) to generate TTCp.
We first estimated wmV and wmT for each subject. In most
Bayesian models the model is evaluated by assessing the goodness
of fit. A more powerful approach is to fit the model to a training
dataset and examine how well it explains a test dataset. An even
more powerful approach is to fit the model to one set of condi-
tions and ask whether it predicts data in another condition to
which it was not fitted. We employed the last approach. For each
subject we estimated wmT from the O-F-O condition with G = 1
(Fig. 6B, Left), and wmV from the V-O condition with G = 0.667
(Fig. 6B, Right) and used those estimates to predict subjects’ be-
havior in the V-O condition with G = 1 (Fig. 6C).
To estimate wmT we developed a Bayesian observer for the
O-F-O condition with G = 1. In this case, the sensory information
provided was the interval between when the bar flashed at initial
start and when it reached FP (halfway along the path), which we
denote by t1. We fitted subjects’ behavior by a BLS estimator that
only relied on the likelihood of t1, λ(tmjt1) and the prior distri-
bution, p(t1). As shown for one subject (Fig. 6B, Left), and
consistent with previous work in a similar task (37, 44–46), the
model accurately captured behavior.
Next, we estimated wmV from fits of the Bayesian model to the
V-O condition with G = 0.667. For this fitting procedure we used
the corresponding wmT derived from the O-F-O condition with
G = 0.667 (Materials and Methods). As shown for the same
subject (Fig. 6B, Right), the model successfully accounted for the
behavior. Recall that in the V-O condition we had made the

section). Gt = 1 (purple): The durations of movement in the visible and occluded sections were the same. Because of speed difference between the two
sections, the visible distance was shorter than the occluded distance (i.e., Gd = 0.8). Gd = 1 (orange): The visible distance was same as the occluded distance, but

 visible length long enough so that subjects’ estimate of speed had
saturated and was thus no longer dependent on G (Fig. S2). This
allowed us to safely use the fit to wmV derived from the G =
0.667 condition to predict behavior in the G = 1 condition.
Finally, we used each subject’s fits to wmV, wmT to predict the
behavior in the V-O condition for G = 1. The model was able to
predict the observed TTCp values as shown for one example
subject (Fig. 6C) and captured the summary statistics (BIAS and
VAR) across subjects (Fig. 6D). This is remarkable considering
that both wmV and wmT were estimated from other task condi-
tions and provides strong support that subjects integrate prior
information, speed information, and timing information to op-
timize their estimate of TTC.
A point of potential concern in our modeling work is that we
modeled both the prior distribution over the speed and the time
intervals as uniform. This formulation is inaccurate. Given that
the objective prior distribution of speed was uniform and that
duration was inversely proportional to speed, the objective prior
on intervals cannot be uniform. In our original model, we made
this approximation because both distributions were discrete and
because the exact formulation of the prior was not relevant to
our main conclusion about the integration of the likelihood
functions associated with speed and duration. However, to en-
sure that our results did not depend on the specific assumption
of a uniform prior over time intervals, we constructed another
model in which the prior more accurately reflected the distri-
bution used in the experiment. For this model, we followed
previous work (47) and derived a “subjective” prior of time in-
tervals by blurring (i.e., convolving) the objective distribution
with a normal distribution whose SD was proportional to elapsed
time. This alternative formulation did not change our main
conclusion about the integration of speed and timing informa-
tion but provided an overall better fit to behavior, suggesting that
subjects relied on the empirically observed samples to form their
prior over time intervals (Fig. S5).

The Bayesian observer model with integration of speed and implicit timing cues for the V-O condition. (A) The Bayesian observer model for the V-O
condition. On each trial, the speed (v) was drawn from a uniform prior distribution. We used the relationship between the distance of the visible section (d1)
and speed to express the prior in terms of the duration the bar is visible [p(t1), Left] and assumed this to be uniform as well. We assumed that the observer
makes two conditionally independent measurements of v and t1, which we denoted by vm (red vertical line) and tm (green vertical line), respectively. We
assumed that vm and tm are perturbed by zero-mean Gaussian noise with SDs (σmV and σmT) proportional to v and t1 (Gaussian curves, Top) with constant of
proportionality of wmV and wmT, respectively. The Bayesian observer computes the posterior from the likelihood functions, λ(vmjv) and λ(tmjt1), and the prior,
and uses a BLS estimator, fBLS, to infer the movement duration in the visible section, which we denoted by te (brown vertical line). This estimate is then
multiplied by the gain (G) to obtain an optimal estimated TTC (TTCe). Finally, the model incorporates motor variability via additional noise in the production
stage. We modeled this noise as a sample from a zero-mean Gaussian with SD scaling with TTCe with scaling factor wp. (B, Left) The wmT estimation shows the
behavior of a Bayesian observer model (black) fitted to the data (red) for a typical subject in the O-F-O condition with G = 1. Since the movement of the bar in
the O-F-O condition was not visible, we estimated wmT from a Bayesian model that relies on the prior and tm, but not vm. (B, Right) The wmV estimation shows
the Bayesian model (black) fitted to its corresponding data (green) for the V-O condition with G = 0.667. In the V-O condition the observer had access to both
speed and timing cues. Therefore, we estimated wmV from a Bayesian model that uses the prior tm and vm with wmT inferred from the O-F-O condition with
G = 0.667. (C) Behavior (black) and model prediction (cyan) for a typical subject in the V-O condition with G = 1. The prediction was made based on a Bayesian

 depth (4–17, 48–51). Our work reveals that humans additionally
exploit timing information gleaned from the temporal structure
of events in the environment as an alternative source of in-
formation to estimate TTC. Moreover, we show that humans
automatically combine this timing strategy with kinematics to
derive more accurate estimates of TTC.
We demonstrated the role of timing in two complementary
sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments we presented
subjects with a task in which estimation of TTC could benefit
from either timing or speed information. Results indicated that
when explicit timing cues were available subjects integrated
timing information with their measurements of speed to derive
more accurate estimates of when a moving bar would reach a
target position. This result extends a large body of evidence
showing that humans fuse information from multiple modalities
to improve their performance (19–21).
In the second set of experiments we removed the explicit timing
cue and instead asked whether subjects could exploit implicit
timing cues in the environment. In our experiment we varied the
ratio between the intervals when the bar was visible and occluded.
Based on recent work (39), we hypothesized that when the visible
and occluded segments have the same duration subjects would
automatically make use of this temporal identity and rely more on
the timing information to estimate TTC. Results validated that
subjects relied on the temporal identity structure to improve their
performance. Notably, performance in the temporal identity con-
text was even better than when the occluded length was the same
and the visible length was made longer. In other words, prolonging
the visible portion, which could only improve subjects’ estimate of
speed, was harmful to performance when it broke the temporal
structure conferred by the identity context. This result powerfully
demonstrated that the key factor driving the performance im-
provement was the presence of temporal identity. This conclusion
was reinforced by a control experiment showing that the result was
due to temporal—not distance—identity. Finally, it is also im-
portant to note that the role of timing strategy in our experiment
cannot be attributed to apparent motion because the distances
and time intervals we used in our experiment were well outside
the range that typically induces an apparent motion percept (52).
Our work also intersects with the body of work revealing sub-
jects’ ability to integrate sensory information with prior expecta-
tions (19, 21, 25–38). This integration is often characterized in the
context of Bayesian models that formalize how prior knowledge
and sensory cues must be integrated to optimize performance. We
found that a Bayesian model that optimally integrates the prior
distribution of TTC with evidence derived from both speed and
temporal cues accurately captured subjects’ behavior. This result
suggests that the human brain is optimized to combine speed and
time information for object interception. Note that the integration
of speed and time information is distinct from the indirect role
that time would play by improving one’s estimate of speed (53–
55). As we demonstrated in the control experiment (Fig. S2), the
improvement of speed estimate saturates rapidly as viewing time
increases and cannot account for our finding in Exp. 2. In other
words, our results reveal that humans actively integrate elapsed
time with speed information to estimate TTC.
These experiments lead to a simple conclusion that humans
actively engage timing mechanisms during estimation of TTC. To
put this finding in context, it is important to distinguish between
the role of time during the visible and occluded regions of the
path. When an object moves behind an occluder, subjects can no
longer measure the object’s speed and thus have no choice but to
rely on their sense of time. This idea was formalized by Tresillian
and others in relation to humans’ ability to extrapolate an object’s
location behind an occluder (56, 57). This is fundamentally dif-
ferent from what we propose; our findings indicate that humans
actively integrate information about temporal contexts and events
even when the object is visible. In other words, timing seems to be
an integral component of how we interact with dynamic stimuli,
both to better estimate where they are when they are visible and to
infer where they might be when they are occluded.
One important implication of our work is for studies of object
interception. Real-world object interception involves a decision
to initiate a movement followed by ongoing adjustments based
on sensorimotor feedback. Although successful interception re-
quires a tight coordination between the initiation and the sub-
sequent adjustments, the two processes typically involve different
computations (58). The decision of when to initiate is de-
termined by a prediction of how long it would take to reach the
object, which is directly related to our work on TTC estimation.
While our work does not address any potential role of timing for
the sensorimotor coordination after movement initiation, it does
invite a revision of the computational models that specify how
the brain computes the movement initiation time. In particular,
it suggests that the cognitive and/or motor planning stage of in-
terception behavior may be particularly sensitive to preceding
temporal events in the environment, as recent physiology experi-
ments suggest (44). It is also consistent with numerous imaging
and electrophysiological studies that find an important role for
premotor and supplementary motor areas in timing (59–63). In
contrast, temporal cues may not play an active role during the
adjustments that follow movement initiation when the brain has
access to movement-related, state-dependent information (64–66).
It is worthwhile considering why the role of time was not noted
in prior research on object interception. We think that the an-
swer has to do with the simplicity of behavioral tasks commonly
used in laboratory experiments (but see refs. 67 and 68). Many
previous experiments lacked a rich spatiotemporal context that
could reveal the relevance of temporal structure. However, real-
world examples of object interception take place in the presence
of temporal statistics, spatial landmarks, and temporal events
such as collisions and/or reflections, all of which make knowl-
edge about time highly informative. A notable observation in our
experiment was that TTC estimates were more accurate in the
temporal identity context, which replicates results from a recent
study showing nonidentity transformations are associated with
higher sensorimotor noise (39).
We speculate that the improvement of performance we found in
the temporal identity context may be an instance of a more general
principle related to temporal structures for which the human brain
has a strong internal prior. If so, we would expect stronger effects of
timing information in the presence of sounds that form rhythms
or for integer ratios for which strong internal priors have been
reported (69). A real-world example of this conjecture applies to
intercepting a bouncing ball. According to our results, we predict
that subjects benefit from the bounce sound, especially when visual
information is uncertain (e.g., dribbling a basketball without looking
at the ball). These considerations highlight the need for future re-
search to move beyond simple behavioral tasks and examine object
interception and TTC estimation in more naturalistic settings where
the underlying dynamics are governed by richer spatiotemporal
contexts. Exploration of behavior in more naturalistic settings may
further substantiate the importance of temporal events and contexts
in processing dynamic stimuli.
Materials and Methods
All experiments were approved by the Committee on the Use of Humans as
Experimental Subjects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and all
subjects provided informed consent before participation. We used three
experiments to examine how people infer TTC. Seven adult subjects partic-
ipated in Exp. 1. A different group of seven adult subjects participated in
Exp. 2. Another group of eight adult subjects participated in Exp. 3. All
subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. In all experiments we
quantified behavior by comparing the statistics of experimentally specified
actual TTC (TTCa) with the subjects’ TTC (TTCp).
We developed and fitted Bayesian observer model to describe perfor-
mance in the V-O condition (Fig. 6A) based on previous work on interval

 reproduction (38). Model details and fitting procedures are provided in
Supporting Information.
Instead of fitting the Bayesian model to each dataset, we asked whether
we could fit the model to some conditions and then use parameters of the
fitted model to predict behavior in other conditions. We aimed to predict
behavior in the most important condition where subjects integrated speed
with the identity temporal context (i.e., V-O with G = 1). We assumed that
the noise associated with the measurement of time is the same in the V-O
and O-F-O conditions and therefore used the Bayesian model to the O-F-O
condition for G = 1 to estimate wmT (Fig. 6B, Left). We further assumed that
the measurement of speed in V-O condition would be the same across two
different gains (G = 1 and G = 0.667), given that the accuracy of speed
measurement saturated rapidly (Fig. S2). We first found wmT for G =
0.667 from the O-F-O condition and then used this value to fit a Bayesian
model to the V-O condition with G = 0.667 to estimate wmV (Fig. 6B, Right).
Finally, we used the wmT inferred from O-F-O with G = 1 and wmT inferred
from V-O with G = 0.667 to predict behavior in the V-O condition with
G = 1 (Fig. 6C).
