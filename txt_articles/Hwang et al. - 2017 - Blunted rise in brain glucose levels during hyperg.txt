Introduction
The current obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics in the US and across the world show no signs of abat-
ing, and with a growing number of individuals diagnosed at a younger age, there is greater exposure to 
the long-term adverse effects of these disorders. The lack of effective, long-term treatment options lends a 
particular urgency to understanding the underlying physiologic mechanisms driving obesity and diabetes 
development.
Dysregulation of cerebral cellular metabolic processes is thought to play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of obesity as well as obesity- and type 2 diabetes mellitus–associated (T2DM-associated) 
neurodegenerative diseases (1, 2). However, the underlying mechanisms linked to these associations remain 
unclear. Glucose is the primary energy source for the brain, which consumes more glucose (~60% of total 
glucose-derived energy) than any other organ in the body (3). Glucose is supplied across the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) via facilitated diffusion through glucose transporters, predominately GLUT1 (4). Studies in 
healthy, lean subjects using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a powerful, noninvasive technique to 
measure concentrations of metabolites within living tissue, have shown that brain glucose levels rise in a 
linear fashion with rising plasma glucose levels (5, 6).
However, fundamental questions regarding the effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes on glucose entry 
into the brain remain unresolved. Animal studies have suggested that chronic hyperglycemia decreases glu-
cose transport through downregulation of GLUT1 at the BBB (7, 8). However, data in humans using MRS 
have mainly focused on type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and suggest a more complex picture. Men with T1DM were 
reported to have lower glucose uptake during acute hyperglycemia in the thalamus compared with control 
subjects (9). In another study, poorly controlled diabetic patients (T1DM and T2DM together) tended to 
In rodent models, obesity and hyperglycemia alter cerebral glucose metabolism and glucose 
transport into the brain, resulting in disordered cerebral function as well as inappropriate responses 
to homeostatic and hedonic inputs. Whether similar findings are seen in the human brain remains 
unclear. In this study, 25 participants (9 healthy participants; 10 obese nondiabetic participants; and 
6 poorly controlled, insulin- and metformin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participants) 
underwent 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy scanning in the occipital lobe to measure the 
change in intracerebral glucose levels during a 2-hour hyperglycemic clamp (glucose ~220 mg/dl). 
The change in intracerebral glucose was significantly different across groups after controlling for 
age and sex, despite similar plasma glucose levels at baseline and during hyperglycemia. Compared 
with lean participants, brain glucose increments were lower in participants with obesity and 
T2DM. Furthermore, the change in brain glucose correlated inversely with plasma free fatty acid 
(FFA) levels during hyperglycemia. These data suggest that obesity and poorly controlled T2DM 
progressively diminish brain glucose responses to hyperglycemia, which has important implications 
for understanding not only the altered feeding behavior, but also the adverse neurocognitive 
consequences associated with obesity and T2DM.

have modest decreases in brain glucose levels compared with control subjects following a hyperglycemic 
clamp at 300 mg/dl (10). In contrast, other studies in well-controlled T1DM patients have found that an 
increased frequency of hypoglycemia may lead to increased glucose entry into the brain (11, 12). No studies, 
however, have directly examined in the human brain how glucose transport into the brain in response to 
acute increases in plasma glucose is modified by obesity and T2DM, despite evidence that insulin (13, 14) 
and free fatty acid (FFA) (15) may also modulate glucose transport across the BBB. It is noteworthy in this 
regard that in rats high-fat feeding for 3 days suppresses brain glucose uptake by downregulating GLUT1 
independently from effects of blood glucose (15). Whether similar changes in cerebral glucose entry occur 
among obese, nondiabetic individuals remains unknown. This study was therefore undertaken to determine 
how obesity and poorly controlled T2DM modify changes in brain glucose levels in response to acute hyper-
glycemia using 1H MRS scanning.
Results
Participant characteristics. The lean and obese groups were similar in age and HbA1C levels; however, T2DM 
participants were older and had poor glycemic control with HbA1C levels of 9.5% ± 0.5% (Table 1). As 
expected, the mean glucose infusion rate during the clamp (P = 0.003) was progressively lower when compar-
ing lean participants to obese participants and comparing obese participants to T2DM participants. Lean indi-
viduals had significantly lower fasting insulin and leptin levels compared with the obese and T2DM groups. 
There were no significant differences in fasting FFA, ghrelin, and IGF-1 levels between the groups (Table 2).
Plasma and brain glucose levels. Using a mixed-effects regression model, plasma glucose levels during the 
study did not differ across the 3 groups and rose comparably in all groups (Figure 1, A and B). Despite a lack of 
differences in absolute or change in plasma glucose levels, the change in intracerebral glucose was significantly 
different across groups (P = 0.0001) (Figure 1C). Moreover, when plasma and brain glucose levels had reached 
steady state (between 60 and 120 minutes), individuals with obesity and those with T2DM had significantly 
reduced increments in brain glucose concentrations compared with lean controls (lean 1.46 ± 0.1 mmol/l 
vs. obese 1.06 ± 0.06 mmol/l vs. T2DM 0.71 ± 0.1 mmol/l) (Figure 1D). Individuals with poorly controlled 
T2DM showed a further blunting of brain glucose levels compared with obese individuals (P = 0.04).
Hormone and metabolite response to hyperglycemia. To begin to assess what factors might be driving these dif-
ferences, we looked at relationships between changes in brain glucose levels and plasma levels of hormones or 
metabolites. In response to hyperglycemia, there were significant differences in insulin and FFA levels across 
the groups. Lean and obese nondiabetic individuals had a predictable rise in plasma insulin levels during 
hyperglycemia, but obese individuals had a much more pronounced rise in insulin levels (Table 2). Individuals 
with poorly controlled T2DM (who were receiving exogenous insulin) had no significant changes in insulin 
levels in response to hyperglycemia (Table 2). As expected, while lean individuals had virtually undetectable 
FFA levels after hyperglycemia, the obese and T2DM individuals did not suppress FFA levels to a similar 
extent (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the FFA levels during hyperglycemia were inversely correlated with the 
mean change in brain glucose level between time 60 and 120 minutes (ρ = –0.56, P = 0.04) (Figure 2B).
Hunger and fullness ratings. Hunger, satisfaction, and fullness ratings were scored immediately before and 
after the hyperglycemia clamp and MRS scan. There were no differences across groups in baseline measures 
of hunger (P = 0.121), satisfaction (P = 0.715), or fullness (P = 0.687). Furthermore, there were no reported 
differences across groups in the hunger (P = 0.305), satisfaction (P = 0.858), and fullness (P = 0.834) ratings,

which were obtained immediately after the scan. However, in an exploratory analysis, changes in brain 
glucose levels during the hyperglycemia clamp were correlated against hunger and fullness scores obtained 
immediately upon exiting the scanner and prior to any meals. The average brain glucose levels (between 60 
and 120 minutes) correlated positively and significantly with feelings of fullness (r = 0.57, P = 0.02) and 
satiety (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) but not hunger (P = 0.33) (Figure 3).
Discussion
Understanding how obesity and type 2 diabetes affect the ability of the brain to detect changes in circu-
lating glucose is central to defining the downstream metabolic changes contributing to disordered eating 
behavior in obesity and T2DM. This study demonstrates that obese individuals without diabetes and poorly 
controlled T2DM individuals have significantly and progressively diminished elevations of intracerebral 
glucose levels in response to identical increments in plasma glucose as compared with healthy nondiabetic 
subjects. Most prior human studies examining glucose entry into the brain have focused on the effects of 
hypoglycemia on brain glucose transport and found that patients with T1DM and frequent episodes of 
hypoglycemia have augmented brain glucose entry (12, 16), presumably to minimize the adverse effects of 
acute hypoglycemia. The current data provide evidence that the reverse is true in poorly controlled patients 
with T2DM, suggesting that this may be a protective adaptation to reduce the brain’s exposure to excessive 
circulating levels of glucose. These findings are consistent with studies in diabetic rodents showing that 
glucose entry into the brain is decreased following hyperglycemia via downregulation of GLUT1 expres-
sion (17). Thus, our findings add another facet to a growing body of evidence indicating that glucose entry

into the human brain is plastic and able to adapt to peripheral metabolic factors associated with poorly 
controlled diabetes.
What is less intuitive is our finding that obesity alone, in the absence of diabetes and chronic exposure 
to hyperglycemia, can also significantly blunt the rise of brain glucose during comparable acute elevations 
in plasma glucose levels. Prior human studies have provided indirect evidence that, at euglycemia, obesi-
ty may be associated with decreased brain metabolic activity. A study that utilized 31P-MRS brain scan-
ning reported that lower levels of cerebral high-energy phosphates (18) are measured in obese individuals. 
Another study involving a cohort of 21 healthy individuals (including 3 obese participants) found that BMI 
was inversely correlated with brain metabolic activity, as measured by 18F-FDG PET scanning in the pre-
frontal cortex (19). Taken together with the current data, these observations suggest that obesity might be 
associated with defects in cerebral glucose metabolism stemming from decreased glucose transport across 
the BBB, a finding that might limit the brain’s ability to sense and respond appropriately to increments in 
peripheral glucose. This obesity-induced defect may be driven by increasing insulin resistance, which is 
then further magnified by progression to T2DM, leading to further blunting of the brain glucose response 
to elevations in peripheral glucose.
Our findings in the human brain are consistent with a recent study in rats showing that high-fat diet 
feeding for 3 days suppresses glucose transport across the BBB via downregulation of GLUT1, in conjunc-
tion with decreased functional glucose uptake, as measured by 18F-FDG scanning (15). Interestingly, in 
the study by Jais and colleagues, FFA, particularly palmitic acid, were sufficient to downregulate GLUT1 
expression in brain endothelial cells. In rodents, hypothalamic FFA sensing has been associated with con-
trol of energy balance (20) and glucose homeostasis (21, 22). Moreover, humans with metabolic syndrome 
have been found to have higher cerebral FFA uptake (23). Thus, it is notable that, in our human study, we 
observed that higher plasma FFA levels correlate significantly with reduced brain glucose levels. Because 
FFA levels have been reported to mediate peripheral insulin resistance (24, 25) and are also directly regu-
lated by plasma insulin levels, further studies will be needed to help clarify how plasma insulin levels mod-
ulate the association we observed between FFA levels and brain glucose.
In our study design, we elected not to standardize plasma insulin levels by using somatostatin in order 
to more closely mimic normal physiologic responses and avoid potential confounding somatostatin-in-
duced effects on the brain. Whether insulin regulates BBB passage of glucose remains the subject of some 
debate, with some studies suggesting that it increases BBB glucose transport (13), while others failed to 
detect such effects (26, 27). In a study using MRS to assess the effects of insulin on brain glucose in lean, 
healthy subjects, insulin was shown to have no effect on intracerebral glucose levels during hyperglyce-
mic clamps (26). Furthermore, our obese participants were nondiabetic, and there were no differences in 
HbA1C percentage or fasting plasma glucose levels compared with lean controls; however, it is theoret-
ically possible that the more insulin-resistant obese individuals would have slightly higher postprandial 
elevations in blood glucose levels in real-life conditions. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that if such modest

increases in postprandial plasma glucose levels occurred they would be of sufficient magnitude to induce 
reductions in GLUT1 at the BBB.
It should be noted that the T2DM subjects were also significantly older than the lean and obese nondi-
abetic individuals, and although we controlled for age and sex in our statistical analysis, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that cerebrovascular changes related to chronic diabetes may also be associated with changes 
in brain glucose transport. However, when examining the relationship between age and brain glucose in 
nondiabetic lean and obese individuals (and thereby excluding the effects of diabetes and chronic hypergly-
cemia), we noted no correlations between age and change in brain glucose (P = 0.72), despite a wide range 
of ages (22–56 years) for the lean and obese groups. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the need for future 
studies designed to identify the additional factors that may be driving the magnified difference seen among 
T2DM individuals.
It is noteworthy that our brain glucose measurements were obtained in the occipital cortex due to its 
relative ease and reliability for spectral acquisition. However, there might be regional differences in cerebral 
glucose uptake, and thus further studies will be needed to determine if obesity might specifically alter brain 
glucose uptake in regions important for energy homeostasis, food intake, or cognitive function. This pos-
sibility is, however, not supported by rodent studies showing that high-fat diets caused comparable down-
regulation of GLUT1 in cortical and hippocampal endothelial cells (15). Because only steady-state levels 
of glucose were measured, it is not possible to know if the differences resulted from decreased transport of 
glucose across the BBB or increased rates of glucose utilization. However, given the large body of evidence 
that obesity is associated with relative cerebral hypometabolism (18, 19, 28), increased cerebral glucose 
utilization among obese and T2DM individuals appears unlikely, thus suggesting decreases in transport 
activity are driving the observed changes.
A potential limitation of the study is that, in order to maximize measurement accuracy, we measured 
the change in brain glucose as opposed to the absolute level. However, as shown in Supplemental Figure 1 
(supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95913DS1), 
the ratio of transport to metabolism can be derived from the changes in steady-state brain and plasma glu-
cose levels from euglycemic values (6) (Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, it 
is possible to derive the absolute intracellular glucose concentration from the change in brain glucose and 
the Michaelis-Menten constant, Kt, using a previously published reversible Michaelis-Menten model for 
glucose transport across the human BBB (6, 29).
Studies using 13C-MRS have established that absolute brain glucose levels are roughly 0.5 –1.5 mmol/l 
at euglycemia (5, 26) in lean, healthy individuals. We estimate that the baseline brain glucose concen-
trations among our healthy control subjects (assuming plasma glucose 5 mmol/l) range from 0.84 ± 0.1 
mmol/l using Kt = 0.6 mM (6) to 0.7 ± 0.1 mmol/l using Kt = 1.1 mM (29); both of which are consistent 
with prior reports (5, 26) (Supplemental Table 2). Moreover, using these models, we calculate that at a

had FFA levels below the detection limits of the assay.

plasma glucose of 12 mmol/l, healthy lean individuals would have an estimat-
ed absolute brain glucose concentration of 2.3 ± 0.2 mmol/l (with Kt = 0.6 
mM) and 2.1 ± 0.2 mmol/l (with Kt = 1.1 mM), which is also consistent with 
prior reports (5, 26). Whether obesity and T2DM alter glucose transport across 
the BBB and/or alter absolute baseline concentrations of glucose in the brain 
remains unknown. However, the possibility that the obese and diabetic subjects 
had higher brain glucose levels specifically at euglycemia would be very unlike-
ly, since, based upon glucose transport kinetics, a decreased increment would 
be consistent with lower brain glucose concentrations at all plasma levels (29).
Blunted increments in cerebral glucose levels in response to acute elevations 
in plasma glucose levels in obese and T2DM patients could have wide-ranging 
clinical implications. Circulating glucose levels are known to regulate human 
feeding behavior through modulation of brain activity in regions associated 
with reward and motivation (30). Thus, it is interesting that those individuals 
with higher brain glucose levels during the study also reported higher ratings 
of fullness and satiety after the study, despite having fasted for nearly 12 hours. 
The blunted intracerebral glucose levels may thus be one mechanism by which 
postprandial satiety signaling may be diminished in obesity. Finally, defective 
cerebral glucose entry across the BBB may also be one mechanism contributing 
to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (and other neurodegenerative disor-
ders), which is associated with obesity (31) and cerebral hypometabolism (32).
In summary, we demonstrate that obese and poorly controlled T2DM 
individuals have a blunted rise in brain glucose concentrations in response to 
comparable increases in plasma glucose levels. These findings have potential 
implications for not only regulation of feeding behavior and body weight, but 
also for understanding the increased risk of neurocognitive deficits in patients 
with obesity and poorly controlled T2DM.
Methods
Participants. Nine healthy individuals with normal weight, ten obese individu-
als, and six individuals with poorly controlled T2DM were recruited from the 
greater New Haven area and participated in the study (Table 1). Exclusion cri-
teria included inability to enter the MRI, smoking, illicit drug or recent steroid 
use, known psychiatric or neurological disorders, active infection, malignancy, abnormal thyroid function, 
cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, hepatobiliary disease, or weight change in last 3 months. 
For lean and obese participants, any medication use (other than contraceptives for women) was exclusion-
ary. All T2DM individuals were treated with metformin as well as with basal/bolus insulin regimens; one 
individual was also using a GLP-1 agonist. Women who were breastfeeding, seeking pregnancy, or shown 
to be pregnant by urine test were also excluded.
Experimental protocol. On the evening prior to MRS scanning, individuals with T2DM were admitted to the 
Yale University Hospital Research Unit and placed on a standard hospital protocol insulin drip overnight to nor-
malize plasma glucose levels. T2DM participants received an average of 8.4 ± 2 units of insulin overnight, and 
mean plasma glucose levels were 126 ± 6 mg/dl overnight. The insulin infusion was maintained until the start of 
the scanning. At the start of scanning, the insulin infusion rate was fixed at 1 unit/hour for the duration of the 
study in order to minimize risk of ketosis. Neither lean nor obese participants received any exogenous insulin.
Hyperglycemia (target plasma glucose 220 mg/dl) was maintained using a variable 20% dextrose infu-
sion, adjusted every 5–10 minutes for 2 hours. Insulin, leptin, ghrelin, and FFA were measured every 60 
minutes. Immediately before and after the study, subjects rated their subjective feelings of hunger, fullness, 
and satiety/satisfaction (33) using a visual analog scale (10 cm).

1H MRS scanning. Participants were positioned supine in a 4.0 T whole-body magnet interfaced to a 
Bruker AVANCE spectrometer (Bruker Instruments), with the head immobilized using foam inserts on top 
of a radiofrequency probe with a 1H circular coil as previously described (34, 35). After tuning, calibration, 
and acquisition of scout images for anatomical localization, intracerebral glucose concentration signals were 
obtained using stimulated echo acquisition mode localization (36) in 30 × 20 × 30 mm3 voxels in the occip-
ital lobe for 20 minutes at baseline and then every 10 minutes for at least 2 hours of hyperglycemia. The 
sequence parameters were TR = 2,000 ms, TE/TM = 15 ms/10 ms, bandwidth = 5,000 Hz, sampling points 
= 2,048. Spectra were acquired with B0-lock and retrospective frequency adjustment for motion correction.
Baseline spectra were subtracted from subsequently obtained spectra to eliminate overlap from other 
brain metabolites as previously described (9, 10) (Figure 4). Changes in glucose levels were measured by 
peak integration referenced to creatine using baseline spectra to determine concentration. Glucose integrals 
were obtained by integrating the large peak from 3.32 to 3.54 ppm and scaled back to total intensity from 
3.10 to 3.96 ppm in the free glucose spectrum (1:2.9), which contains 11 protons. The concentration of glu-
cose was then compared with the creatine CH3 peak in the in vivo spectrum, which was assumed to be 10 
mmol/kg and which contains 3 protons.
Laboratory analysis. Plasma glucose levels were measured via glucose oxidase (YSI Inc.). Plasma free 
insulin, leptin, and ghrelin were measured by double-antibody radioimmunoassay (Millipore), IGF-1 was 
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems), and FFA was measured using a colo-
rimetric assay (WAKO).
Statistics. One-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there were statistical differences among 
the three groups for all normally distributed hormones and metabolites as well as average brain and plasma 
glucose levels between times 60 and 120 minutes, followed by Fisher’s least significant difference test for 
pairwise comparisons. For nonparametric variables, the corresponding Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney 
U tests were used. Analyses of every repeatedly measured variable, including intracerebral glucose and 
plasma metabolite levels, were performed using the mixed-effects regression model method, taking into 
account both between-subject and within-subject correlations of repeated measures using the combination 
of a prespecified compound symmetry covariance matrix and an autoregressive covariance matrix. Age 
and sex were adjusted as covariates (i.e., as fixed effects). All analyses were performed using SAS, version 
9.4, and SPSS, version 22. A 2-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Study approval. The Yale University Human Investigation Committee approved the protocol, and all 
participants provided written informed consent prior to study participation.

was obtained 10 minutes later. The black spectrum underneath is the 
difference between the red and blue spectra. The green spectrum rep-
resents a glucose reference spectrum obtained under in vivo conditions 
of temperature 37°C, pH 7.4, and ionic strength of 150 mM.
