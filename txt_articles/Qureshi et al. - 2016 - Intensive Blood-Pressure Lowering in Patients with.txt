Abstract
Background—Limited data are available to guide the choice of a target for the systolic blood-
pressure level when treating acute hypertensive response in patients with intracerebral 
hemorrhage.
Methods—We randomly assigned eligible participants with intracerebral hemorrhage (volume, 
<60 cm3) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 or more (on a scale from 3 to 15, with 
lower scores indicating worse condition) to a systolic blood-pressure target of 110 to 139 mm Hg 
(intensive treatment) or a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg (standard treatment) in order to test the 
superiority of intensive reduction of systolic blood pressure to standard reduction; intravenous 
nicardipine to lower blood pressure was administered within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The 
primary outcome was death or disability (modified Rankin scale score of 4 to 6, on a scale ranging 
from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 3 months after randomization, as ascertained by an 
investigator who was unaware of the treatment assignments.
Results—Among 1000 participants with a mean (±SD) systolic blood pressure of 200.6±27.0 
mm Hg at baseline, 500 were assigned to intensive treatment and 500 to standard treatment. The 
mean age of the patients was 61.9 years, and 56.2% were Asian. Enrollment was stopped because 
of futility after a prespecified interim analysis. The primary outcome of death or disability was 
observed in 38.7% of the participants (186 of 481) in the intensive-treatment group and in 37.7% 
(181 of 480) in the standard-treatment group (relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 
1.27; analysis was adjusted for age, initial GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular 
hemorrhage). Serious adverse events occurring within 72 hours after randomization that were 
considered by the site investigator to be related to treatment were reported in 1.6% of the patients 
in the intensive-treatment group and in 1.2% of those in the standard-treatment group. The rate of

 renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization was significantly higher in the intensive-
treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (9.0% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.002).
Conclusions—The treatment of participants with intracerebral hemorrhage to achieve a target 
systolic blood pressure of 110 to 139 mm Hg did not result in a lower rate of death or disability 
than standard reduction to a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg. (Funded by the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center; 
ATACH-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01176565.)
An acute hypertensive response in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is common1 and 
may be associated with hematoma expansion and increased mortality.2,3,4 The second 
Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial5 (INTERACT2) 
included patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage who had a systolic blood 
pressure of 150 to 220 mm Hg within 6 hours after symptom onset. The rate of death or 
disability among patients randomly assigned to intensive reduction in the systolic blood-
pressure level, with a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg within 1 hour, 
was nonsignificantly lower than the rate among those assigned to guideline-recommended 
treatment, with a target systolic blood pressure of less than 180 mm Hg, with the use of a 
variety of antihypertensive medications (absolute difference, 3.6 percentage points; P = 
0.06).5
We designed the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-2) 
trial6 to determine the efficacy of rapidly lowering the systolic blood-pressure level in 
patients in an earlier time window after symptom onset than that evaluated in previous 
trials.4,5,7 The trial was based on evidence that hematoma expansion and the rate of 
subsequent death or disability might be reduced with very early and more aggressive 
reduction in the systolic blood-pressure level8,9 among persons at high risk owing to a high 
systolic blood-pressure level (≥170 mm Hg10 to ≥200 mm Hg11) at presentation.
Methods
Trial Design
We designed this randomized, multicenter, two-group, open-label trial to determine the 
relative efficacy of intensive versus standard antihypertensive treatment that was initiated 
within 4.5 hours after symptom onset and continued for the next 24 hours in patients with 
spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage. At least one reading of systolic blood 
pressure of 180 mm Hg or more between symptom onset and the initiation of intravenous 
antihypertensive treatment was required for eligibility.6 Treatment could be initiated before 
randomization to lower the systolic blood pressure to less than 180 mm Hg, which is 
consistent with guidelines from the American Stroke Association Stroke Council,12 but 
patients were not eligible if the systolic blood pressure was reduced to less than 140 mm Hg 
before randomization. The initiation of intravenous antihypertensive treatment according to 
the trial protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) and randomization 
had to occur within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.
The trial initially recruited patients within 3 hours after symptom onset, but the recruitment 
window was extended to 4.5 hours.13 The extension was based on new data suggesting that

 the occurrence of hematoma expansion, the primary target for reduction in the systolic 
blood-pressure level, was equally prevalent among patients who presented between 0 and 3 
hours after symptom onset and those who presented between 3 and 4.5 hours after symptom 
onset.13 Data from the pilot study13 also supported the reductions in hematoma expansion 
and the rate of death or disability among participants whose systolic blood pressure was 
reduced within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. Patients 18 years of age or older with a 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 or more (on a scale from 3 to 15, with lower scores 
indicating a worse condition) at the time of arrival in the emergency department and with a 
measurement of the intraparenchymal hematoma of less than 60 cm3 on initial computed 
tomographic (CT) scan were eligible for inclusion in the trial if antihypertensive treatment 
could be initiated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.
Randomization was performed centrally through the trial website with the use of a 
minimization algorithm combined with the biased-coin method to ensure a balance of 
treatment assignment within and across clinical sites, baseline GCS score, age (divided into 
seven strata), and presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage at baseline. An 
independent oversight committee adjudicated the trial safety outcomes and evaluated 
adherence to the protocol at participating sites by review of summary reports of collected 
data and deidentified medical records.14
Trial Oversight
The trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board whose 
members were appointed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 
The protocol and consent forms were approved by the institutional review board or 
equivalent ethics committee at each participating site, and all participants or their legally 
authorized representative provided written informed consent before randomization. The 
members of the steering committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org designed the trial and performed the analyses. The first author wrote the first 
draft of the manuscript, and the members of the steering committee contributed to revisions. 
All the investigators and coordinators who were provided access to the results were asked to 
sign a confidentiality agreement to ensure that the results were not disclosed to third parties 
before publication and presentation of primary results as determined by the steering 
committee. Chiesi USA and Astellas Pharma supplied intravenous nicardipine for use during 
the trial but had no other role in the design or conduct of the trial or in the review of the 
manuscript.
The statistical analysis plan was revised and finalized before data analysis. The investigators 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses reported and for the 
fidelity of this report to the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan.
Trial Intervention
The goal of treatment was to reduce and maintain the hourly minimum systolic blood 
pressure in the range of 140 to 179 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group and in the range 
of 110 to 139 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group throughout the period of 24 hours 
after randomization. Before randomization, intravenous anti-hypertensive medication,

 including nicardipine, could be administered to lower the systolic blood pressure to less than 
180 mm Hg,12 but patients were not eligible if the systolic blood pressure was lowered to 
less than 140 mm Hg. After randomization, nicardipine, administered by intravenous 
infusion, was the first-line antihypertensive agent and was initiated at a dose of 5 mg per 
hour, which was then increased by 2.5 mg per hour every 15 minutes as needed, up to a 
maximum dose of 15 mg per hour. If the systolic blood-pressure level was higher than the 
target, despite infusion of the maximum dose of nicardipine for 30 minutes, a prespecified 
second agent, intravenous labetalol, was used. In countries where labetalol was not available, 
intravenous diltiazem or urapidil was used. Additional care was based on the best available 
evidence15 and the guidelines from the American Stroke Association Stroke Council12 and 
the European Stroke Initiative Writing Committee.16
We assessed the success, or lack thereof, of the reduction in the systolic blood-pressure 
level. Primary treatment failure was defined as not reaching the target systolic blood 
pressure of less than 140 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and less than 180 mm Hg 
in the standard-treatment group within 2 hours after randomization. Secondary treatment 
failure was defined as the hourly minimum systolic blood pressure remaining higher than the 
upper limit of the target range for 2 consecutive hours during the period of 2 to 24 hours 
after randomization. No effort was made to conceal the treatment assignment from the 
participants or treating physicians.
Trial Assessments
A CT scan of the head without the use of contrast material was obtained at 24 hours after the 
initiation of treatment. Baseline and 24-hour CT scans were forwarded to the core image 
analysis center. The reader, who was unaware of the treatment assignments, clinical findings, 
and time points of image acquisition, determined the site of hemorrhage, the presence or 
absence of blood in the ventricles, and the volume of the parenchymal hematoma. The area 
of the hematoma was delineated by image analysis software with the use of density 
thresholds on each slice, followed by manual correction; those performing manual correction 
were unaware of the treatment assignments. The software provided total volume 
measurements by summing up volumes (product of area and slice thickness) from all the 
slices containing the hematoma. Serious adverse events were systematically reported up to 3 
months after randomization. Nonserious adverse events were systematically reported up to 
day 7 or hospital discharge, whichever came first.
Follow-up after discharge included telephone contact at 1 month and in-person clinical 
evaluation at 3 months. During the telephone interview, the site staff obtained information 
regarding serious adverse events and deaths. The data collection at the 3-month visit 
consisted of the score on the modified Rankin scale (which assesses the degree of disability 
or dependence in daily activities, with scores ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]); 
quality of life as assessed by means of the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 
questionnaire17; serious adverse events; and results of physical and neurologic examinations. 
The assessments were conducted by a qualified investigator who did not participate in the 
randomization, treatment, or in-hospital clinical treatment of the patient.

 Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had moderately severe or severe 
disability or who had died (modified Rankin scale score, 4 to 6; hereafter referred to as 
“death or disability”) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were the scores on the EQ-5D utility 
index and visual-analogue scale (VAS) at 3 months and the proportion of participants with 
expansion of 33% or more in the volume of the hematoma on the CT scan obtained at 24 
hours after randomization, as compared with the entry scan. The 3-month EQ-5D utility 
index (on which scores range from −0.109 [least favorable health state] to 1 [most favorable 
health state], with 0 imputed for death) was derived by applying Shaw's weight18 to the 
response patterns of the five questions regarding mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and 
discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The EQ-5D VAS score was obtained by requesting 
that patients indicate their perception of their own health state on a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 
(best), with a score of 0 assigned to those who died.17 Safety outcomes were neurologic 
deterioration, defined as a decrease from baseline of 2 or more points in the GCS score or an 
increase of 4 or more points in the score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(on which scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe stroke) that 
was not related to sedation or hypnotic-agent use and was sustained for at least 8 hours 
within the 24 hours after randomization; serious adverse events occurring within 72 hours 
after randomization that were considered by the site investigator to be related to treatment; 
and death within 3 months after randomization.
Statistical Analysis
The primary hypothesis was that intensive treatment would be associated with a likelihood 
of death or disability at 3 months after intracerebral hemorrhage that was at least 10 
percentage points lower than the likelihood associated with standard treatment. For an effect 
size of 10 percentage points (relative risk, 0.83), assuming a rate of death or disability of 
60% in the standard-treatment group (derived from the literature), a type I error probability 
of 0.05, and a type II error probability of 0.10, we estimated that the total sample should be 
1042 participants; two interim analyses for overwhelming efficacy and for futility were to be 
performed (Section D1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A sample size of 1280 participants 
was calculated after inflation by a factor of 1.23 as derived from the following calculation: 
1/(1 − R)2, where R was the proportion of patients with anticipated nonadherence (e.g., 
treatment failure or loss to follow-up). Two prespecified interim analyses and one unplanned 
interim analysis of the primary outcome were conducted; the unplanned analysis was 
requested by the data and safety monitoring board. Enrollment was stopped because of 
futility after the prespecified second interim analysis.
The prespecified primary analysis was conducted under the intention-to-treat principle, with 
adjustment for the effects of age, GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular 
hemorrhage as determined by the central imaging evaluator. The analysis of the 
dichotomized 3-month modified Rankin scale score (4 to 6 vs. 0 to 3) was based on the 
generalized linear model with log-link function with Poisson distribution (rather than 
binomial distribution, because of convergence issues). The PROC GENMOD procedure of 
SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), was used for all the analyses.

 Missing data were imputed with the use of the multiple-imputation method that generated 
and analyzed 100 samples (with the use of a computer simulation) of the trial data, each with 
a variable imputed value for the missing data, and results were subsequently compiled as 
described in the statistical analysis plan (Section D2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the 
prespecified sensitivity analysis, we imputed missing data using the worst outcome 
(modified Rankin scale score, 4 to 6). To address multiple comparisons, we prespecified in 
our statistical analysis plan that for secondary outcomes, we considered test results with P 
values of less than 0.025 to indicate statistical significance.
Any adverse events and serious adverse events were classified with the use of terminology 
from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A post hoc analysis was performed 
after grouping the related events (events that represent the same condition of interest 
according to body system) so that the true occurrence rate of an event with relationship to 
blood-pressure lowering was not obscured. The unplanned analysis was performed because 
of a between-group difference in the rates of serious adverse events within 3 months after 
randomization.
Results
Participant Population
The trial enrolled the first patient in May 2011 and the last in September 2015. We 
conducted the trial at 110 sites in the United States, Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and 
Germany. A total of 8532 patients were screened, of whom 1000 under-went randomization; 
500 patients were assigned to the intensive-treatment group and 500 to the standard-
treatment group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean age of the enrolled 
patients was 61.9 years. A total of 38.0% of the patients were women, and 56.2% of the 
patients were Asian. The mean (±SD) systolic blood pressure at baseline was 200.6±27.0 
mm Hg. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants at baseline, which 
are shown in Table 1, were similar in the two treatment groups.
Intervention
The mean interval between symptom onset and randomization was 182.2±57.2 minutes in 
the intensive-treatment group and 184.7±56.7 minutes in the standard-treatment group 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean values of hourly minimum systolic 
blood pressure for the first 24 hours after randomization according to treatment group are 
shown in Fig. 1. The mean minimum systolic blood pressure during the first 2 hours was 
128.9±16 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 141.1±14.8 mm Hg in the standard-
treatment group.
Primary treatment failure occurred in 61 patients (12.2%) in the intensive-treatment group 
versus 4 (0.8%) in the standard-treatment group (P<0.001); secondary treatment failure 
occurred in 78 patients (15.6%) in the intensive-treatment group versus 7 (1.4%) in the 
standard-treatment group (P<0.001). Among patients who died, withdrawal of care was 
reported in 61% (20 of 33) of those in the intensive-treatment group and in 76% (26 of 34) 
in the standard-treatment group.

 Outcomes
Among the 961 participants in whom the primary outcome was ascertained, death or 
disability was observed in 186 participants (38.7%) in the intensive-treatment group and in 
181 (37.7%) in the standard-treatment group (Table 2). In the primary analysis that used the 
multiple-imputation method for the 39 participants with missing outcome data, the relative 
risk was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.27), with adjustment for age, initial 
GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage. The prespecified 
sensitivity analysis that used the worst-case imputation yielded a relative risk of 1.04 (95% 
CI, 0.85 to 1.26). There was no significant between-group difference in the ordinal 
distribution of the modified Rankin scale score at 3 months (Fig. 2). The post hoc 
proportional-odds logistic-regression analysis yielded a common odds ratio of 1.07 (P = 
0.56) without violation of assumption of proportionality of the odds. Analysis of the primary 
outcome according to prespecified subgroups showed no significant differences (Fig. 3). In 
addition, neither the EQ-5D measures nor the percentages of patients with hematoma 
expansion differed significantly between the treatment groups (Table 2).
There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of death at 3 months or in 
neurologic deterioration at 24 hours after randomization. The percentage of patients with 
treatment-related serious adverse events within 72 hours after randomization was 1.6% in 
the intensive-treatment group and 1.2% in the standard-treatment group. However, the 
percentage of patients with any serious adverse event during the 3 months after 
randomization was higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment 
group (25.6% vs. 20.0%; adjusted relative risk, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.69; P = 0.05) (Table 
2). Lists of adverse events and serious adverse events, according to treatment group, are 
provided in Tables S2 and S3, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix.
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix lists adverse events and serious adverse events that 
were related to renal function, cardiac function, brain hemorrhage, and brain infarction after 
randomization. The rate of renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization was 
significantly higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group 
(9.0% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in the rates in any of the 
other adverse-event groups.
Discussion
The ATACH-2 trial was discontinued for futility before we reached the target enrollment of 
1280 participants. The absolute difference between the two groups in the rate of death or 
disability was 1 percentage point. The trial was powered to identify a difference in risk of 10 
percentage points or more with intensive treatment as compared with standard treatment, 
because a smaller difference in risk was expected to be viewed as insufficient for broad 
acceptance of a new intervention.5 A higher proportion of patients with primary treatment 
failure was observed in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group, 
and perhaps the treatment effect would have been greater if the treatment goals had been met 
in a higher proportion of participants.

 In the subgroup analysis (Fig. 3), the relative risk of death or disability with intensive 
treatment as compared with standard treatment was 1.02 among participants who met the 
specified target within 2 hours after randomization and 0.61 among those who did not meet 
the specified target. However, the test for interaction was not significant, and the precision of 
relative-risk estimates is too wide to make any definitive conclusions.
The recruitment window was extended during the trial on the basis of evidence that an 
intensive reduction in the systolic blood-pressure level could benefit participants who were 
treated between 3 and 4.5 hours after symptom onset. A time-dependent loss of benefit of 
intensive reduction in the systolic blood-pressure level in participants who were recruited 
between 3 and 4.5 hours after symptom onset is possible, although it was not observed in the 
subgroup analysis of INTERACT2.5 A relatively high proportion of Asian participants were 
recruited in our trial, although the percentage was lower than that in INTERACT2. However, 
there was no significant difference in treatment effect between Asian patients and non-Asian 
patients in our trial or between participants recruited in China and those recruited in other 
countries in INTERACT2.5
Our trial incorporated the prerandomization use of intravenous antihypertensive agents to 
ensure timely compliance with existing guidelines,16 but this strategy may have obscured the 
effectiveness of the trial intervention. The observed rate of death or disability at 3 months in 
the standard-treatment group (37.7%) was lower than the rate that was anticipated in the trial 
design on the basis of previous literature (60%).6,19,20 A high percentage of patients with 
favorable characteristics at baseline (e.g., 56% of the patients had a baseline GCS score of 
15) may have conferred a predisposition to a favorable outcome in our trial sample 
regardless of treatment (ceiling effect), making it difficult to discern the beneficial effect of 
an intensive reduction in the systolic blood-pressure level in this trial.6 The high proportion 
of favorable outcomes may also have resulted from the monitoring and standardizing 
intensity of medical care provided at each site and a low rate of withdrawal of care among 
participants recruited in the trial (as compared with a 34% rate outside clinical trials).21
There were several key differences between INTERACT2 and the ATACH-2 trial. An 
estimated 41% of the participants in INTERACT2 underwent randomization 4 or more hours 
after symptom onset, whereas all the participants in the ATACH-2 trial underwent 
randomization and were treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. In INTERACT2,5 
only 48% of the 2839 participants underwent randomization with an initial systolic blood 
pressure of 180 mm Hg or more, whereas all the participants in the ATACH-2 trial had an 
initial systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or more. Primary treatment failure was seen in 
66% of the participants within 1 hour after randomization in INTERACT2 and in 12.2% of 
those in the intensive-treatment group within 2 hours after randomization in the ATACH-2 
trial.
In our trial, the mean minimum systolic blood pressure in the first 2 hours after 
randomization was 128.9 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 141.1 mm Hg in the 
standard-treatment group. In INTERACT2, the mean systolic blood pressure was 150 mm 
Hg in the first hour in the intensive-treatment group and 164 mm Hg in the standard-
treatment group. Thus, the early profile of the systolic blood-pressure level in the standard-

 treatment group in the ATACH-2 trial was similar to values observed early in the intensive-
treatment group in INTERACT2. We had postulated that a more rapid intensive reduction in 
the systolic blood-pressure level than that used in INTERACT2 and the exclusion of patients 
with no requirement for intravenous antihypertensive medication would make it more likely 
to show a larger magnitude of therapeutic benefit, but our results did not confirm this 
hypothesis.
The results of our trial suggest that intensive reduction in the systolic blood-pressure level 
does not provide an incremental clinical benefit. It is also possible that the blunting of 
fluctuations in the systolic blood-pressure level in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage 
and an acute hypertensive response22,23 may exert a therapeutic benefit that is independent 
of the magnitude of lowering the systolic blood-pressure level. We observed a higher 
occurrence of serious adverse events within 3 months after randomization (but not a higher 
occurrence of serious adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be related to 
treatment within 72 hours after randomization) among participants who were randomly 
assigned to intensive treatment than among those randomly assigned to standard treatment. 
A post hoc comparison after the grouping of related events identified a higher proportion of 
renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization among participants randomly 
assigned to intensive treatment than among those randomly assigned to standard treatment. 
It should be noted that the results of this trial cannot be generalized to patients with large 
intracerebral hemorrhage, intracranial pressure elevation, or compromised cerebral perfusion 
pressure. Therefore, the possibility of precipitating global or regional cerebral hypoperfusion 
with the intensive reduction of the systolic blood-pressure level in such patients may still be 
a concern.
In conclusion, our results do not support the notion that acute reduction to a target systolic 
blood pressure of 110 to 139 mm Hg in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is more 
effective in improving functional outcome than a reduction to a target systolic blood 
pressure of 140 to 179 mm Hg.

 Figure 2. Distribution of Scores on the Modified Rankin Scale, According to Treatment Group
The data are presented only for participants for whom a score on the modified Rankin scale 
score was obtained at 90 days. The percentage of participants with each score on the 
modified Rankin scale is shown in or above each cell. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 
indicating no symptoms, 1 no clinically significant disability (able to carry out all usual 
activities, despite some symptoms), 2 slight disability (able to look after own affairs without 
assistance but unable to carry out all previous activities), 3 moderate disability (requires 
some help but able to walk unassisted), 4 moderately severe disability (unable to attend to 
bodily needs without assistance and unable to walk unassisted), 5 severe disability (requires 
constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, and incontinent), and 6 death. Percentages 
may not sum to exactly 100.0 owing to rounding.

 Figure 3. Unadjusted Relative Risk of Death or Disability at 3 Months, According to Subgroup
The Glasgow Coma Scale is a measure of level of consciousness, with a score of 3 
indicating deep unconsciousness and higher scores indicating milder impairment of 
consciousness; scores range from 3 to 15. The data are presented only for participants for 
whom a score on the modified Rankin scale score was obtained at 90 days. Data were 
missing on the following characteristics: on presence or absence of intraventricular 
hemorrhage for 4 patients in the intensive-treatment group and 7 in the standard-treatment 
group; on baseline hematoma volume for 4 in the intensive-treatment group and 7 in the 
standard-treatment group; on location of hematoma for 4 in the intensive-treatment group 
and 7 in the standard-treatment group; and on presence or absence of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus for 10 in the intensive-treatment group and 7 in the standard-treatment group. Data 
on location of hematoma are not shown for 1 patient in the intensive-treatment group whose 
hematoma was in the cerebellum (no patient in the standard-treatment group had a 
hematoma in this location). Data for patients with other or unknown race are not shown. The 
size of the squares is proportional to the precision of the estimates.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline.
†Race and ethnic group were self-reported. Asian race included patients enrolled in Asian countries and non-Asian countries.
‡The Glasgow Coma Scale score (range, 3 to 15), a measure of level of consciousness, is a scale that quantifies response in three components, with 
a score of 3 indicating deep unconsciousness and higher scores indicating milder impairment of consciousness.
§Data were missing for 1 patient in the standard-treatment group.
¶The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a serial measure of neurologic deficit, is a 42-point scale that quantifies neurologic 
deficits in 11 categories, with a score of 0 indicating normal function without neurologic deficit and higher scores indicating greater severity of 
deficit. Data were missing or were obtained outside the specified time window for 30 patients in the intensive-treatment group and for 41 in the 
standard-treatment group.

*The relative risk or beta estimate with 95% confidence intervals for the modified Rankin scale score, hematoma expansion, European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility index score, and EQ-5D 
visual-analogue scale score were based on analyses inclusive of missing data imputed by the multiple-imputation method.
†The analysis was adjusted for age, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and the presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage at baseline.
‡The modified Rankin scale grades the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities using scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). The primary outcome was defined as a score of 4 to 
6.
§Hematoma expansion was defined as an increase of 33% or more in the hematoma volume from baseline to 24 hours.
¶Neurologic deterioration was defined as decrease from baseline of 2 or more points on the GCS score or an increase from baseline of 4 or more points on the NIHSS score that was not related to sedation 
or hypnotic-agent use and that was sustained for at least 8 hours.

║Treatment-related serious adverse events were assessed by the site investigator.
**Since the EQ-5D utility index and the visual-analogue scale scores are continuous variables, beta is the regression coefficient for the treatment effect (standard-treatment group divided by intensive-
treatment group) in the generalized linear model. A beta of 0 indicates there was no effect of the treatment on the outcome.
††The EQ-5D utility index (with scores ranging from −0.109 [least favorable health state] to 1 [most favorable health state], with 0 imputed for death) was derived by applying Shaw's weight18 to the 
response combinations of five questions regarding mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Data were missing for 28 patients in the intensive-treatment group 
and for 27 in standard-treatment group.
‡‡On the EQ-5D visual-analogue scale, patients were requested to indicate their perception of their own health state on a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Data were missing for 144 patients in the intensive-
treatment group and for 146 in the standard-treatment group.
