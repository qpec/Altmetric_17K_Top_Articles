Background-—The proportion of foreign-born US adults has almost tripled since 1970. However, less is known about the
cardiovascular morbidity by birthplace among adults residing in the United States. This study’s objective was to compare the
prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke among US adults by birthplace.
Methods and Results-—We used data from the 2006 to 2014 National Health Interview Survey. Birthplace was categorized as
United States or foreign born. Foreign born was then grouped into 6 birthplace regions. We defined CHD and stroke as ever
being told by a physician that she or he had CHD or stroke. We adjusted for select demographic and health characteristics in
the analysis. Of US adults, 16% were classified as foreign born. Age-standardized prevalence of both CHD and stroke were
higher among US- than foreign-born adults (CHD: 8.2% versus 5.5% for men and 4.8% versus 4.1% for women; stroke: 2.7%
versus 2.1% for men and 2.7% versus 1.9% for women; all P<0.05). Comparing individual regions with those of US- born adults,
CHD prevalence was lower among foreign-born adults from Asia and Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean. For stroke,
although men from South America or Africa had the lowest prevalence, women from Europe had the lowest prevalence. Years of
living in the United States was not related to risk of CHD or stroke after adjustment with demographic and health
characteristics.
Conclusions-—Overall, foreign-born adults residing in the United States had a lower prevalence of CHD and stroke than US-born
adults. However, considerable heterogeneity of CHD and stroke risk was found by region of birth. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:

Key Words: birthplace • coronary heart disease • stroke • surveillance
H
eart disease and stroke are the first and fifth leading
causes of death in the United States, respectively.1
Previous studies have shown significant associations between
birthplace and cardiovascular disease mortality.2,3 In general,
studies have found that foreign-born adults had lower
cardiovascular mortality rates than those born in the United
States.3 In addition, studies have shown birthplace had a
significant impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors,
including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.4–8
The foreign-born population in the United States has been
increasing during the past 4 decades, from 9.6 million (4.7%)
in 1970 to 31.1 million (11.1%) in 2000,9 then to 40.0 million
(12.9%) in 2010.10 During this period, there has also been a
shift in the regions of the world from which the foreign-born
population hails. For example, in the 1960s, 75% of foreign-
born residents were from Europe, whereas in 2010, >80% of
foreign-born individuals were from Latin America and the
Caribbean or Asia.10 With the increasing and changing
foreign-born populations in the United States and differential
prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors and related
health behaviors compared with US-born adults, there is need
for information on the relationship between birthplace and
coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in the United States.
In this study, we used data from the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) to test the hypothesis that, among US adults,
the self-reported prevalence of CHD and stroke would differ
by region of birth.

 Methods
Data
We analyzed data from the 2006 to 2014 NHIS, a nationally
representative survey of civilian noninstitutionalized US
residents conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics.11 The data, analytic methods, and study materials
are available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing
the results or replicating the procedure.12 NHIS data were
collected by Census Bureau staff during in-person interviews,
although some telephone interviewing was permitted to
complete missing portions of the interview. Most interviews
were conducted in English or Spanish. If respondents
preferred, interpreters could be used to conduct the interview
in another language. In this study, 9 years of data were
combined to have sufficient sample size to produce reliable
estimates of CHD and stroke by the world regions of interest.
During these years, no new sample design was implemented,
so the strata and primary sampling units (PSUs) were largely
consistent across years. Therefore, the inferences reflect an
“average” target population for the 9-year period.
We used data from the NHIS Sample Adult and Family Core
survey modules in this study. In the Family module, data were
collected via self-reporting or proxy reporting from a family
respondent. An adult (the “sample adult”) was then randomly
selected to receive the Sample Adult module, in which she or
he self-reported on additional health information (unless she
or he was mentally or physically unable to do so, then a
knowledgeable adult served as a proxy respondent). The final
response rate for sample adults (≥18 years of age) ranged
from 70.8% in 2006 to 58.9% in 2014. The NHIS used a
multistage
complex
probability
sample,
which
included
clustering, stratification, and oversampling of minority sub-
populations (including non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-
Hispanic Asian). Detailed information about the NHIS can be
found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm.
The NHIS has maintained approval to operate by the
Research Ethics Review Board of the National Center for
Health Statistics (current protocol 2015-08) and the US Office
of Management and Budget (current control 0920-0214).
Written consent to participate in the NHIS was not received,
but instead informed consent was given orally by all
respondents before participation.
Study Measures
Birthplace information was obtained with the question, “Were
you born in the United States?” Respondents who were born
outside of the 50 US states were then asked, “In what country
were you born?” Although information about individual US
territory or country is obtained during the interview, birthplace
is recoded into regions in the publicly available NHIS files. We
classified respondents as “US born,” representing those born
in the 50 US states or “foreign born,” representing those born
outside of the 50 US states. Foreign-born respondents were
further classified into 6 regions: “Mexico, Central America,
and Caribbean,” “South America,” “Europe” (including those
born in Russia and the Middle East), “Africa,” “Indian
subcontinent,” and “Asia” (including those born in Southeast
Asia). The 0.5% of foreign-born respondents not categorized
into these 6 categories (including those born in Guam,
Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, Oceania, or elsewhere) were
omitted from these analyses. People born outside of the 50
US states were also asked, “About how long have you been in
the United States?” Years of living in the United States were
categorized as follows: <5, ≥5 to <10, ≥10 to <15, or
≥15 years. Pregnant women were excluded from the analysis
to eliminate the impact of specific cardiovascular risk factors
(eg, hypertensive pregnancy disorders, gestational diabetes
mellitus, and eclampsia) that could differ between US- and
foreign-born women.13,14
Respondents were identified as having CHD if they
answered “yes” to any of the following 3 questions: (1) “Have
you ever been told by a physician or other health professional
that you had CHD?,” (2) “Have you ever been told by a
physician or other health professional that you had angina
(also called angina pectoris)?,” and (3) “Have you ever been
told by a physician or other health professional that you
had a heart attack (also called myocardial infarction)?”
Respondents were identified as having had a stroke if they
answered “yes” to the question “Have you ever been told by
a physician or other health professional that you had a
stroke?”
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In the United States, the prevalence of coronary heart
disease and stroke was higher among US-born adults
compared with those of foreign-born adults; however, this
effect was attenuated when the comparison included race/
ethnicity.
• There was heterogeneity in the risk of coronary heart
disease and stroke among foreign-born adults by region of
birth.
• Among foreign-born adults, after adjusting for health and
demographic factors, risk for coronary heart disease or
stroke was not related to the length of time they had
resided in the United States.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Identifying high-risk populations with cardiovascular disease
could help to target prevention interventions.

 Other health conditions used as covariates in this analysis
included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Diabetes melli-
tus was assessed using the question “[Other than during
pregnancy], have you ever been told by a physician or other
health professional that you have diabetes mellitus or sugar
diabetes mellitus?” Hypertension was defined by affirmative
answers to both of the following questions: (1) “Have you ever
been told by a physician or other health professional that you
had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?” and
(2) “Were you told on ≥2 different visits that you had
hypertension, also called high blood pressure?”
Demographic characteristics included age (18–24, 25–44,
45–64, or ≥65 years), sex, and level of education (less than
high school graduate, high school graduate, some college, or
college graduate). Health insurance status was defined as
insured (adults who had health insurance at the time of the
interview, including private health insurance, Medicare, Med-
icaid, State Children’s Health Insurance Program, a state-
sponsored health plan, other government programs, or
military health plan) and not insured. Health risk factors
included smoking status (current smoker or not current
smoker) and body mass index (BMI). BMI was based on self-
reported height and weight and categorized as underweight/
normal weight (BMI <25.0 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0–
29.9 kg/m2), or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), using a standard
calculation (weight in kilograms/height in meter squared).15
Statistical Analysis
Respondents’ characteristics by birthplace were compared
between US- and foreign-born adults, overall, and by foreign-
born region, using the v2 test for categorical variables and
ANOVA for continuous variables. Age-standardized preva-
lences of CHD and stroke were estimated by birthplace for
men and women, as well as by years of living in the United
States among foreign-born respondents using the projected
2000 US standard population, with the age groups of 18 to
24, 25 to 44, 45 to 64, and ≥65 years as the standard.16
Using multiple logistical regression models, we calculated
unadjusted odds ratios of risk for CHD and stroke among
foreign-born adults by birthplace, using US-born adults as
reference (model 1). Adjusted odds ratios were then calcu-
lated (models 2–3). Model 2 adjusted for age, sex, education,
health insurance, smoking, BMI, diabetes mellitus, and
hypertension. Model 3 adjusted for all variables from model
2 plus years of living in the United States (for US-born adults,
age was used as years of living in the United States). In
addition, among foreign-born adults, we conducted logistic
regression analysis to assess whether duration of US
residence was associated with risk of CHD and stroke, using
foreign born with <5 years of residence in the Unites States
as reference. Model 1 was used to assess unadjusted odds
ratios. Model 2 was adjusted for age only. Model 3 was
adjusted for age, plus region of birth, sex, health insurance,
education, BMI, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.
Although the main objective of this report is to assess the
impact of regions of birth on risk of CHD and stroke among
US adults, supplemental analyses were conducted to assess
the impact of race/ethnicity on the association of birthplace
and risk of CHD/stroke. Comparisons made in the supple-
mental analysis explored differences between (1) US-born
Hispanics and Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean born,
as well as South America born; (2) US-born white and
European-born white; (3) US-born black and African-born
black; and (4) US-born Asian and Indian subcontinent born
and Asia born. (Approximately 7% of US-born Asian sample
adults in the NHIS are “Asian Indian,” which reflects Indian
subcontinent ancestry.)
Sampling weights were used to produce national estimates
that are representative of the adult civilian noninstitutional-
ized population living in the United States.17 All analyses,
including subgroup analyses and regressions, were performed
using SAS, version 9.3, and SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 10
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)18 to
account for the complex sample design. For all subgroup
analyses, the entire survey data set was used. The SUDAAN
SUBPOPN statement was used to define the subgroup(s) of
interest in the analyses. All statistical tests were 2 tailed, and
statistical significance was defined at P<0.05.
Results
The total sample adults from 2006 to 2014 were 263 130.
After excluding those from unknown regions (n=267) or
regions outside of the preassigned categories (n=1304) and
women who were pregnant (n=2697), the final analytic
sample included 258 862 sample adults. Among US adults,
16.4% were foreign born (Table 1). Among those classified as
foreign born, approximately half (50.1%) were from Mexico,
Central American, or the Caribbean; 17.3% were from Asia;
16.2% were from Europe; and 6.5%, 6.0%, and 4.0% were from
South America, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa, respec-
tively. Overall, 60.6% of foreign-born adults reported living in
the United States for ≥15 years, and 10.2%, 14.0%, and 15.2%
reported living in the United States for <5, ≥5 to <10, and ≥10
to <15 years, respectively. Table 1 shows heterogeneity
between the groups. On average, those born in Africa were
the youngest group (mean age, 40.0 years), and those born in
Europe were the oldest group (mean age, 48.9 years). The
percentage of men ranged from 43.5% (Asia) to 56.7% (Indian
subcontinent). Those without health insurance ranged from
13.7% (US-born adults) to 46.4% (those born in Mexico,
Central America, or the Caribbean). The percentage with a
college degree ranged from 9.5% (Mexico, Central America, or

 the Caribbean born) to 72.5% (Indian subcontinent born). The
percentage of current smoking and obesity was highest
among US-born adults (20.9% and 29.1%, respectively); the
percentage with diabetes mellitus was highest among foreign-
born adults from Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean
(10.0%); and the percentage with hypertension was highest
among US-born adults (30.9%). Adults from the Indian
subcontinent represented the largest percentage of foreign-
born adults living in the United States for <5 years (23.5%).
The overall age-standardized prevalences of CHD and
stroke were higher among US-born than foreign-born adults
for
both
men
and
women
(Figure 1).
By
region,
the
age-standardized percentage of CHD ranged from 3.1%
(African-born adults) to 6.4% (US-born adults) (Table 2). The
age-standardized percentage of stroke ranged from 1.1%
(South American–born adults) to 2.7% (US-born adults)
(Table 2). However, the prevalence of both CHD and stroke
by sex differed by region. For example, prevalence of CHD
among women was lowest among those born in Africa (1.6%);
for men, the lowest prevalence was found among those born
in Asia (3.9%). Although African-born men had the lowest
percentage of stroke (0.8%), African-born women had the
highest percentage (2.9%). In addition, age-standardized
percentage of CHD increased with length of years living in
the United States; however, this trend was not observed for
stroke (Figure 2).
Both unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, with US-born
adults as the referent, indicated that risk for CHD and stroke
among foreign-born adults varied by region of birthplace
(Table 3). Although most foreign-born adults had lower risk of
CHD and stroke than US-born adults, after full adjustment
with demographic, behavioral, and health characteristics, as
well as years living in the United States, men from Mexico,
Central America, or the Caribbean had 43% lower risk of CHD
and those from Asia had 53% lower risk of CHD than US-born
men. This reduction was also seen for women (albeit at a
smaller magnitude). Compared with US-born women, the risk
of CHD was 17% lower among foreign-born adults from
Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean and 35% lower
among foreign-born adults from Asia. In addition, compared
with US-born women, those born in South America had 40%
lower risk of CHD and those born in Africa had 73% lower risk
of CHD. For stroke, men from Mexico, Central America, or the
Caribbean (26%), South America (64%), and Africa (67%), and
women from Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean (25%),
Europe (38%), and Asia (28%) had lower risk than those of
US-born adults (Table 3). Adjustment for demographic char-
acteristics and cardiovascular risk factors eliminated the
association of CHD and stroke for some regions. Further
adjustment for years living in the United States did not affect
the associations with CHD and stroke for most groups, with
the exception of risk of stroke among women. After adjust-
ment for years in the United States, the risk of stroke for
women born in South American and the Indian subcontinent
was no longer significantly different from women born in the
United States.
Among all foreign-born residents, unadjusted odds ratios
showed those living in the United States ≥10 to <15 or
≥15 years had higher risk of CHD, whereas those living in the
United States ≥15 years had higher risk of stroke than those

 living in the United States <5 years (Table 4). After adjusting
for age, those living in the United States ≥15 years had higher
risk of both CHD and stroke than those living in the United
States <5 years. When further adjusted by birthplace, sex,
education, health insurance, BMI, smoking status, history of
hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (model 3), there was no
association between years living in the United States and
history of CHD or stroke.
Supplemental analyses were conducted to examine differ-
ences in US-born adults by racial/ethnic groups and foreign-
born adults from comparable regions. Table S1 included the
age-standardized prevalence of CHD and stroke for US-born
adults by race/ethnicity and by foreign-born regions. Table S2
included data from logistic regression models assessing the
odds of CHD and stroke among foreign-born adults from
different regions, using comparable racial/ethnic groups
among those US-born adults as referent. The protective
associations
of
birth
in
Mexico,
Central
America,
the
Caribbean, South America, or Asia did not persist when
compared with US-born Hispanics or US-born Asians, respec-
tively. In fact, Indian subcontinent–born men had a signifi-
cantly higher risk of CHD than US-born Asian men. However,
the lower risk of CHD among African-born women and the
lower risk of stroke among African-born men persisted when
compared with US-born non-Hispanic black women and men,
respectively. The lower risk of stroke among European-born
women persisted when compared with US-born non-Hispanic
white women.

 Discussion
The findings of this study showed that US-born residents had
a higher risk of CHD and stroke compared with foreign-born
residents; however, these differences were heterogeneous
and only existed for foreign-born adults from certain regions.
For example, the prevalence of CHD and stroke among
foreign-born residents varied, with prevalence of CHD ranging
from 3.1%
among African-born adults
to 5.4% among
European-born adults. In addition, the prevalence of stroke
ranged from 1.1% among South American–born adults to 2.3%
among those born in Mexico, Central America, or the
Caribbean. The number of years of living in the United States
did not affect the risk of CHD or stroke after adjustment for
sociodemographic and health characteristics.

 The disparities of respondent-reported prevalence of CHD
and stroke observed in the current study are, in some ways,
consistent with the earlier studies assessing cardiovascular
disease mortality. Previous studies in the United States have
shown that risk for death attributable to cardiovascular
disease is higher among US-born residents than among
foreign-born residents.2,3,19 Although our data showed that
foreign-born adults with a longer history of living in the United
States (>15 years) had a higher reported history of CHD and
stroke than those living in the United States for a shorter
duration (<5 years), the comparison was no longer significant
after adjustments for demographic and health characteristics.
Although mortality ranking data show that most countries
of Europe, Asia, and Africa have higher CHD or stroke
mortality than the United States,20 our analyses found that
foreign-born adults from these regions had an overall lower
risk of nonfatal CHD and stroke than those US-born adults.
This could potentially be explained by the “healthy immigrant
effect,”21 where those who decide to immigrate to another
country
are
usually
healthier
than
those
left
behind,
attributable to either self-selection or physical/legal barriers
to entering the receiving country.22
In Canada, a large cohort study of first-generation adult
immigrants from different global regions found 30% lower
10-year age-standardized incidence of major cardiovascular
disease among immigrants compared with long-term Cana-
dian residents.23 In general, immigrants from Eastern Euro-
pean, South Asian, and Middle Eastern countries had higher
risk of CHD and stroke than long-term Canadian residents.24
In addition, immigrants from East Asia had the lowest
incidence of cardiovascular disease, whereas immigrants
from South Asia had the highest incident rates in the same
study.23 A comparable mortality study among Asian Ameri-
cans showed the heterogeneity of cardiovascular mortality
among those traditionally classified as Asian American. In this
study, Asian Americans had a higher mortality burden from
cerebrovascular disease than non-Hispanic whites, and Asian
Indians had higher mortality burden from CHD.25 Unlike these
studies, we were not able to separate European-born adults
into Eastern and Western European-born adults. However, our
data from supplemental analyses showed that Indian-born
men had 89% higher risk of CHD than US-born Asian men.
These findings demonstrate the complexity of these relation-
ships. Previous research has also shown general agreement
with our supplemental analyses (eg, South Asian immigrants
had 1.5 to 2 times greater risk of cardiovascular disease than
long-term Canadian residents,23,24 and Asian Indians in the
United States had higher mortality from CHD than non-
Hispanic whites).25
For Hispanic immigrants in the United States, previous
reports have found that Hispanic immigrants had a lower
prevalence of cardiovascular disease compared with non-
Hispanic white adults.26 This is often noted as the “Hispanic
health paradox,” in which Hispanics in the United States,
while having a lower socioeconomic status and a higher
prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and obesity), have lower cardiovascular disease
outcomes than non-Hispanic whites.27–29 This is consistent
with findings in the current study, where respondents born in
Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean had lower risk of
reported CHD and stroke among both men and women than
those US-born adults. For participants born in South America,
a lower risk of CHD among women and lower risk of stroke
among men was found compared with those born in the
United States. Although there is no specific explanation for
the Hispanic health paradox, it has been suggested that
multiple factors could contribute to it, including dietary habits,
culture, and social dynamics.28 The “Healthy Migrant Effect”
(self-selected immigration of healthy individuals, as well as
reverse migration) indicates that when illness occurs, His-
panic immigrants could return to their native countries.30
When comparing with US-born Hispanics, no differences in
the risk for CHD and stroke were observed for those born in
Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America.
Previous research has also explored the attribution of
cardiovascular risk factors by country of origin. For example, a
Canadian study found that the prevalence of traditional
cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, high cholesterol, and smoking, differed by country of
origin. In general, the mean cardiovascular disease risk score
(eg, risk of cardiovascular disease event) was lower among
immigrants
than
among
long-term
residents.23

 comparable study using NHIS data, a higher overall preva-
lence of hypertension was found among US-born adults than
among foreign-born adults.5 This study also revealed the
overall prevalence of hypertension among immigrants who
lived in the United States for ≥15 years was significantly
higher than those who had lived in the United States for
<5 years. In a similar study among US immigrants focused on
obesity, years of living in the United States was associated
with an increased obesity rate after living in the United States
for >10 years.7 In addition, the prevalence of being over-
weight and having diabetes mellitus differed between groups
of US immigrants by region, with overweight being lowest
among those from Central Asia and highest among those from
Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, and diabetes
mellitus being lowest among those from Europe and highest in
those from the Indian subcontinent.4 These studies suggest
wide variation in cardiovascular risk factors among immi-
grants in the United States. The observed low percentage of
hypertension among those from Mexico, Central America, the
Caribbean, and South America could be attributable to lower
awareness of hypertension status among these populations
because these immigrants also had lower rates of health
insurance.31
The NHIS provides the opportunity to assess CHD and
stroke prevalence by region of birthplace; however, there are
several limitations for this report. First, the NHIS was
conducted among noninstitutionalized US residents, and
therefore, those in long-term care facilities were not included
in the survey. It is possible that adults with CHD and/or stroke
were more likely to be in these facilities than those without
CHD and/or stroke, especially immediately after a cardiovas-
cular disease event. It is also possible that foreign-born adults,
who were less likely to have health insurance coverage, will be
less likely to be in long-term care facilities. Second, the types of
survey data collected were limited in method and breadth,
because they were collected by self-report and proxy report.
Questions on CHD and stroke may be subject to recall bias, and
self-reported immigration status could be less reliable among
those with unauthorized status in the United States.32
Additional factors important in CHD and stroke risk that may
vary by region of birth, such as diet, were not collected on the
NHIS for all of the years examined in this study. Third, the
outcome of this study was prevalence of CHD and stroke,
which could be affected by diagnosis, treatment, and survival. It
is possible that the higher prevalence of CHD and stroke could
be attributable to factors other than increased cardiovascular
risk, such as increased diagnostic testing or increased survival
rate. However, there is no information to determine which
factors could have contributed to the observed prevalence.
Fourth, birthplace information was obtained solely by the
question “Were you born in the United States?” Further
analysis showed that �4% of those classified as “foreign born”
were children born abroad to US parents. An additional 4% of
those classified as foreign born were born in US territories,
such as Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Guam. If these
individuals were more similar to US-born adults in their CHD
and stroke risk, then this analysis may have underestimated
the protective association of foreign-born status with CHD and
stroke. Finally, because of relatively small numbers of partic-
ipants in some regions and relative low event rates (stroke <3%
and CHD <8%), we were unable to closely examine race/
ethnic-specific percentages of CHD and stroke among foreign-
born adults from each region. Self-reported race and ethnic
categories were used for sensitivity analyses and are concep-
tually different than birthplace. Although these 2 concepts are
correlated, they should not be used interchangeably.
Using a nationally representative sample of US adults,
these analyses found that the prevalence of CHD and stroke
was higher among US-born adults compared with those
classified as foreign-born adults, although this effect was
attenuated when the comparison included race/ethnicity. In
addition, there was heterogeneity in the risk of CHD and
stroke among foreign-born adults by region of birth. We also
found that among foreign-born adults, risk for CHD or stroke
was not related to the length of time they had resided in the
United States after adjusting for health and demographic
factors. These results may support efforts to target high-risk
groups with public health interventions.
