Abstract
Objective—To identify risk and protective factors for weapon involvement among African-
American, Latino, and white adolescents.
Study design—The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health is a nationally-
representative survey of 7th–12th grade students. Predictors at Wave 1 and outcome at Wave 2 
were analyzed. Data were collected in the mid-1990s, when rates of violent crime had been 
declining. The outcome was a dichotomous measure of weapon-involvement in the past year, 
created using 3 items (weapon-carrying, pulled gun/knife, shot/stabbed someone). Bivariate and 
multilevel logistic regression analyses examined associations of individual, peer, family, and 
community characteristics with weapon involvement; stratified analyses were conducted with 
African-American, Latino, and white subsamples.
Results—Emotional distress and substance use were risk factors for all groups. Violence 
exposure and peer delinquency were risk factors for whites and African Americans. Gun 
availability in the home was associated with weapon involvement for African Americans only. 
High educational aspirations were protective for African Americans and Latinos, but higher family 
connectedness was protective for Latinos only.
Conclusions—Interventions to prevent weapon-related behaviors among African American, 
Latino, and white adolescents may benefit from addressing emotional distress and substance use. 
Risk and protective factors vary by race/ethnicity after adjusting for individual, peer, family, and 
community characteristics. Addressing violence exposure, minimizing the influence of delinquent

Keywords
weapons; violence; adolescent; risk factors; protective factors
Weapon-related violence among adolescents leads to physical and mental health problems, 
and results in substantial costs due to injuries and loss of productivity.1 Almost 13% of high 
school students have been victimized with weapons.2 Weapon-carrying is highest among 
whites (21%), followed by Latinos (16%), and African Americans (13%).3 Risk factors 
increase the odds of engaging in weapon-related behaviors,4 and include male sex, 5–7 drug 
and alcohol use,5–7 violent victimization,5 and emotional distress.8 Peer and community risk 
factors include peer delinquency,8 weapon availability,9 unsafe neighborhoods, community 
violence, and community economic disadvantage.5,7 Protective factors include closeness to 
parents,6 and high educational aspirations.8
There may be racial/ethnic differences in risk and protective factors for weapon 
involvement. The influence of substance use,10 peer delinquency,10 academic achievement,5 
neighborhood safety,7 and community economic disadvantage9 on weapon-related behaviors 
may vary by race/ethnicity. Family connectedness and educational aspirations also may 
differ by race/ethnicity,9,11 with some studies demonstrating a greater protective influence 
of family connectedness for Latinos.12 Racial/ethnic disparities may reflect socioeconomic 
disparities, therefore, it is particularly important to adjust for socioeconomic status in 
examining racial/ethnic differences.13 The purpose of the this study was to identify risk and 
protective factors for involvement in weapon-related behaviors among a nationally-
representative sample of African American, Latino, and white adolescents, after adjusting 
for socioeconomic status. Our hypothesis was that the predictors of weapon involvement 
would differ by race/ethnicity.
METHODS
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) consists of 
surveys of a nationally-representative sample of 7th–12th grade students followed from 
adolescence into adulthood.14 Add Health used a school-based clustered sampling design, 
with over-sampling of Cubans and Puerto Ricans. Wave 1, conducted in 1994–1995, 
consisted of 20,745 surveys with adolescents in 7th–12th grades and 17,670 surveys with 
their parents.14 Wave 2, conducted in 1996, consisted of 14,738 surveys with adolescent 
participants from Wave 1. Surveys were conducted via face-to-face interviews with 
respondents in their homes. In order to protect adolescents’ confidentiality, data were 
entered into laptop computers by interviewers,; for sensitive topics, respondents listened to 
questions through earphones and entered their answers directly into the laptops.14 Predictors 
at Wave 1 and the outcome at Wave 2 were analyzed. The study was approved by the UT 
Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Add Health was selected over 
other datasets (eg Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, 
and Monitoring the Future Survey) due to its longitudinal nature, and relatively high

 samples of racial/ethnic minorities. It was selected over other longitudinal studies (e.g. 
Pittsburgh Youth Study, Denver Youth Survey, and Rochester Youth Development Study) 
due to its national representativeness. Although survey data are from the 1990s, Add Health 
provides a unique opportunity to examine racial/ethnic similarities and differences in 
predictors of adolescent weapon involvement over time. It is important to note that rates of 
violent crime began declining in the early 1990s, presumed to be primarily due to policies 
related to policing and incarceration.15 Weapon-carrying continued to decline until 1999, 
but there has been no significant decline since.16
Outcome
A dichotomous variable for weapon involvement was created using three items from Wave 
2. Adolescents self-reported about frequency of carrying a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or 
club, to school during the past 30 days, and frequency of pulling a knife or gun on someone, 
or shooting or stabbing someone, in the past 12 months. Respondents who reported 
involvement in any of these three behaviors one or more times were categorized as involved 
in weapon-related behaviors, whereas those who reported that they were not involved in any 
of these behaviors were categorized as uninvolved. These variables from Add Health have 
previously been used to assess engagement in severe violence.12
Independent variables
Wave 1 predictors (Table I) were chosen based on demonstrated association with youth 
violence and repeated weapon-related behaviors,5–8,12,17 and on validated measures 
previously used in Add Health analyses.4,8 Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, 
family structure, urban residence,5–7 and immigrant generational status.12 Race/ethnicity 
was categorized as Latino, non-Latino white, African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, 
American Indian/Alaska Native, or Other racial/ethnic group.8 Parental receipt of public 
assistance was used as a measure of socioeconomic status.8
Wave 1 weapon involvement, constructed identically to the dependent variable in Wave 2, 
was included as a control variable. Individual child risk factors included youth self-reports 
of prior violence exposure,17 alcohol use in the past 12 months, lifetime drug use,18 and 
emotional distress.8 Peer level risk factors included social isolation8 and peer delinquency.8 
Gun availability in the home17 and community economic disadvantage17 also were 
examined.
Youth self-reports of educational aspirations,8 family connectedness,8 and neighborhood 
safety were examined as potential protective factors.
Statistical Analyses
Add Health sample weights were used to obtain national estimates and account for 
clustering. Missing data across independent variables were computed using five-dataset 
multiple imputation.19,20 Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2. Bivariate analyses were 
performed using t-tests and chi-square tests. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used 
to examine associations between risk and protective factors and weapon involvement. All 
independent variables that were associated with the outcome in bivariate analyses were

 included in the multivariable model. Separate stratified analyses, using the same model, 
were conducted for whites, African-Americans, and Latinos to examine group similarities 
and differences. Analyses of other racial/ethnic groups are not presented due to small sample 
sizes. Survey weights were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals for factors associated with weapon involvement. Stratified stepwise multivariable 
analyses20 resulted in similar findings and therefore are not presented.
RESULTS
Weapon involvement differed significantly by racial/ethnic group (Table II), with 7% of 
whites, 13.5% of African-Americans, and 10.4% of Latinos reporting involvement. Of those 
who carried weapons, 17% had also shot/stabbed someone in the past 12 months.
Risk Factors
In bivariate analyses for the full sample, African Americans had the highest unadjusted odds 
associated with the outcome (OR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6–2.3), followed by Latinos (OR 1.3; 95% 
CI, 1.01–1.7). All variables analyzed as potential risk factors demonstrated odds ratios 
greater than one in bivariate analyses, and therefore were associated with higher odds of 
wave 2 weapon involvement. In multivariable analyses (Table III), white youth who were 
weapon-involved in wave 1 had more than five times the odds of weapon involvement at 
wave 2; African Americans had more than four times the odds and Latinos more than six 
times. Emotional distress was associated with higher odds of weapon involvement across 
racial/ethnic groups. Violence exposure, alcohol use, and peer delinquency were risk factors 
for whites and African Americans. Community factors were not associated with weapon 
involvement.
Protective Factors
In bivariate analyses, family connectedness and educational aspirations demonstrated odds 
ratios less than one for all groups, and therefore were associated with lower odds of wave 2 
weapon involvement, as would be expected for protective factors. In multivariable analyses, 
high educational aspirations were protective for both African Americans and Latinos. 
Family connectedness was protective only for Latinos (OR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9), indicating 
that a one point increase on the family connectedness scale was associated with a 30% lower 
odds of weapon involvement for Latinos.
DISCUSSION
This study examined risk and protective factors for weapon-related behaviors among white, 
African American, and Latino adolescents. Study findings indicate that some predictors of 
weapon involvement differ between racial/ethnic groups even after adjusting for 
socioeconomic status and multiple individual, peer, family, and community characteristics. 
Emotional distress emerged as a risk factor for all groups, and peer and family influences 
differed across groups.
Several individual level risk factors were associated with weapon involvement in our study. 
Violence exposure was associated with higher odds of weapon involvement among whites

 and African Americans. Among those who have been exposed to violence, weapon-carrying 
may be in self-defense, due to fear of violence,21,22 or may be associated with delinquency23 
and aggression.24 The relationship between violence exposure and weapon involvement also 
may be mediated by mental health. Violence exposure is associated with anxiety, 
depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder,25 and suicidal ideation is associated with 
weapon-carrying.6 Given that, in our study, emotional distress was associated with weapon 
involvement for all racial/ethnic groups, it is important to further study the mechanisms 
underlying this relationship. Interventions to address weapon-related behaviors need to 
address adolescent mental health for all racial/ethnic groups, in addition to reducing violence 
exposure.
Baseline weapon involvement and substance use were risk factors for weapon involvement 
for all racial/ethnic groups. These findings are consistent with Jessor’s Problem Behavior 
Theory which suggests that high-risk behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, and violence 
co-occur among some adolescents.26 Prior studies also have shown that substance use is 
associated with increased weapon involvement.6,7,27 It may be beneficial to screen for and 
address substance use in violence prevention interventions.
Our findings suggest that the influence of peer and family factors on weapon involvement 
may differ by race/ethnicity. Peer delinquency increased risk for whites and African 
Americans, but not for Latinos. Conversely, family connectedness was protective for 
Latinos but not statistically significant for whites or African Americans. Strong relationships 
with parents can be protective against weapon violence28 and some Latino families may be 
more family-oriented compared with whites.29 There is conflicting research on the 
relationship between family factors and youth violence for Latinos and African Americans. 
Family cohesion is more strongly associated with lower aggression among Latinos 
compared with African Americans,29 but higher family-centered beliefs are associated with 
more violence among Latinos and with less violence among African Americans.30 In our 
study, the level of family connectedness did not vary across groups, but the association with 
weapon involvement did, suggesting there are ethnic differences in the relationship between 
family connectedness and weapon involvement. Promoting family connectedness may be a 
particularly important strategy for preventing youth violence.
Another protective factor for Latinos and African Americans is having high educational 
aspirations. Educational aspirations may be a component of future orientation, and are 
associated with decreased violence involvement and drug use.31 There are racial/ethnic 
disparities in educational aspirations and achievement.32 Educational aspirations of Latinos 
were found to be lower compared with whites,32 whereas those of African Americans were 
similar.12,32 Promoting adolescents’ educational aspirations may protect against weapon 
involvement. It is necessary to also provide youth with the opportunities and resources to 
achieve these aspirations, while considering the unique barriers and challenges faced by 
youth from different cultural groups. Some variables potentially related to the outcome were 
not examined because they were not available in the dataset (e.g. family violence exposure) 
or were highly correlated with others in the model (e.g. parental education). Socioeconomic 
status was measured as receipt of public assistance, and family structure was categorized as 
two-parent vs. other, which may not capture all dimensions of these constructs. Data on

 students who were not in school or who were incarcerated, were unavailable, therefore, this 
study may underestimate the prevalence of weapon involvement. Data were collected by 
youth and parent self-report, which may be subject to bias, however, the use of anonymous 
data collection, with data for sensitive topics entered directly into laptop computers by 
respondents, minimizes bias.33 Data were collected in the mid-1990s. Rates of weapon-
carrying in our study (4.6%) were comparable with 2013 rates (5.2%).3 Despite these 
limitations, the large sample size, with over-sampling of Latino subgroups, allowed the 
examination of a serious, but less frequent type of violence, and of racial/ethnic differences. 
Although studies suggest there may be Latino subgroup differences in violence 
involvement,18 Latinos in this study were analyzed as one group, as sample size did not 
allow subgroup analysis. Future studies must examine Latino sub-group differences.
The effectiveness of current youth violence prevention interventions varies,34,35 with one 
review suggesting smaller effect sizes for racial/ethnic minorities.35 Findings from our study 
suggest that interventions to prevent weapon-related behaviors among white, African 
American, and Latino adolescents should address emotional distress and substance use. It is 
important to also mitigate the effects of violence exposure, promote educational aspirations, 
minimize the influence of delinquent peer groups, and focus on family connectedness to 
appropriately tailor programs for different racial/ethnic groups.
