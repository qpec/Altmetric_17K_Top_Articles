Running Title: Cerebral oxygen delivery in COPD
Abstract: We investigated the role of hypoxemia on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen
delivery (CDO2), and neurovascular coupling (coupling of CBF to neural activity, NVC) in
hypoxemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (n=14). Resting CBF
(duplex ultrasound), peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2; pulse-oximetry), and
NVC (transcranial Doppler) were assessed prior to and following a 20-minute wash-in of
supplemental oxygen (~3L/min). While SpO2 increased from 91.0{plus minus}3.3 to
97.4{plus minus}3.0% (P<0.01), CBF was unaltered (593.0{plus minus}162.8 vs.
590.1{plus minus}138.5 mL·min-1; P=0.91) with supplemental O2. In contrast, both

 CDO2 (98.1{plus minus}25.7 vs. 108.7{plus minus}28.4 mL·dL-1; P=0.02) and NVC
were improved. Specifically, the increase in PCA cerebrovascular conductance was
increased to a greater extent following O2 normalization (+40%, from a 20.4{plus
minus}9.9 to 28.0{plus minus}10.4% increase in conductance; P=0.04) while the PCA
cerebrovascular resistance decreased to a greater extent during O2 normalization
(+22% from a -16.7{plus minus}7.3 to -21.4{plus minus}6.6% decrease in resistance;
P=0.04). The cerebral vasculature of COPD patients appears insensitive to oxygen as
CBF was unaltered in response to O2 supplementation leading to improved CDO2. In
patients, the improvements in CDO2 and neurovascular function with supplemental O2
may underscore the cognitive benefits associated with O2 therapy.

ABSTRACT 
41 
We investigated the role of hypoxemia on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery 
42 
(CDO2), and neurovascular coupling (coupling of CBF to neural activity, NVC) in hypoxemic 
43 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (n=14). Resting CBF (duplex 
44 
ultrasound), peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2; pulse-oximetry), and NVC (transcranial 
45 
Doppler) were assessed prior to and following a 20-minute wash-in of supplemental oxygen 
46 
(~3L/min). While SpO2 increased from 91.0±3.3 to 97.4±3.0% (P<0.01), CBF was unaltered 
47 
(593.0±162.8 vs. 590.1±138.5 mL·min-1; P=0.91) with supplemental O2. In contrast, both CDO2 
48 
(98.1±25.7 vs. 108.7±28.4 mL·dL-1; P=0.02) and NVC were improved. Specifically, the increase 
49 
in PCA cerebrovascular conductance was increased to a greater extent following O2 
50 
normalization (+40%, from a 20.4±9.9 to 28.0±10.4% increase in conductance; P=0.04) while 
51 
the PCA cerebrovascular resistance decreased to a greater extent during O2 normalization (+22% 
52 
from a -16.7±7.3 to -21.4±6.6% decrease in resistance; P=0.04). The cerebral vasculature of 
53 
COPD patients appears insensitive to oxygen as CBF was unaltered in response to O2 
54 
supplementation leading to improved CDO2. In patients, the improvements in CDO2 and

INTRODUCTION 
87 
 
88 
Patients with moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) endure a 
89 
state of chronic hypoxemia - a consequence of sub optimal gas exchange. Literature on cerebral 
90 
vascular regulation in COPD is sparse (Beaudin et al., 2017), despite an elevated risk of 
91 
cognitive impairment (Thakur et al., 2010), dementia (Liao et al., 2015) and ischemic stroke 
92 
(Feary et al., 2010); this risk increases in proportion to disease severity (Portegies et al., 2016). 
93 
Physiological links between COPD, cerebrovascular dysfunction and risk of the aforementioned 
94 
diseases have yet to be established.  
95 
 
96 
In healthy individuals, a reduction in arterial oxygen content (CaO2) leads to an increase in 
97 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to cerebral vasodilator mechanisms (Kety & Schmidt, 1948; 
98 
Hoiland et al., 2016), which may be continuously active in hypoxemic COPD patients. Indeed, 
99 
CBF is elevated in COPD commensurate to the level of hypoxemia (Albayrak et al., 2006); 
100 
however, whether this elevated CBF is great enough in magnitude to maintain cerebral oxygen 
101 
delivery (CDO2) is unknown. If patients are hypoxemic, low flow oxygen (~3L · min-1) is 
102 
typically prescribed (NOTTG, 1980; MRCWP, 1981) with the goal of increasing the partial 
103 
pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to >60mmHg while avoiding hyperoxia (Qaseem et al., 2011). 
104 
This therapy reduces mortality (NOTTG, 1980; MRCWP, 1981) and the risk of cognitive 
105 
impairment (Thakur et al., 2010). Given the potential link between chronic cerebral hypo-
106 
perfusion (i.e. vascular insufficiency – reduced CDO2) and the pathogenesis of neurovascular 
107 
injury and dementia (Iadecola, 2010), understanding the influence of oxygen therapy on CBF, 
108 
CDO2 and neurovascular function in COPD is of immediate importance.  
109 
 
110 
We examined two primary hypotheses: 1) that CBF would be reduced in COPD patients 
111 
following O2 normalization leading to unchanged CDO2 despite elevated CaO2, and 2) in the face 
112 
of unchanged CDO2 no change in neurovascular function would be observed.

The study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee (University of Split, Croatia; Reg. 
118 
no. 2181-198-03-03-13-0017) and the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics 
119 
Board (H16-01028). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and all 
120 
experimental procedures conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki, except 
121 
for registration in a database.  
122 
 
123 
Participants (COPD) 
124 
At the Split Clinical Hospital Centre Pulmonary Diseases Clinic (Split, Croatia), 342 COPD 
125 
patients were screened for eligibility during hospital stays or ambulatory visits. Diagnosis of 
126 
COPD was classified according to the criteria of the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung 
127 
Disease (GOLD) (Vestbo et al., 2013). The primary inclusion criterion was chronic hypoxemia 
128 
defined as arterial oxygen saturation of ≤93% objectively confirmed on at least two different 
129 
occasions during the six previous months (n=84). The related arterial blood gas values from 
130 
these measurements are reported in Table 1. Patients who had suffered from an acute 
131 
exacerbation, active respiratory infection or infection of other localisation within six weeks prior 
132 
to the visit were excluded (n=32). Likewise, patients who had a relevant coexisting condition 
133 
such as interstitial lung disease, cancer, renal failure, thromboembolic disease or major 
134 
cardiovascular event during the previous year were also excluded (n=25). Those patients who 
135 
could not provide informed consent or comply with the study protocol due to a mental or 
136 
physical condition were also excluded (n=10). One patient did not participate due to scheduling 
137 
conflicts. Details on the remaining 16 patients included in the present study are presented in 
138 
Table 1.

Experimental overview (COPD) 
141 
Patients arrived at the laboratory having abstained from exercise, alcohol and caffeine for a 
142 
minimum of 12 hours. Additionally, the patients had fasted for four hours, and current smokers 
143 
had their last cigarette a minimum of eight hours prior to testing. 
144 
 
145 
All cardiorespiratory variables were sampled continuously at 1KHz via an analogue-to-digital 
146 
converter (Powerlab, 16/30; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Heart rate (HR) was 
147 
 Cerebral oxygen delivery in COPD 
6 
 
measured by an electrocardiogram (Lead II; ADI bioamp ML132), while beat-to-beat blood 
148 
pressure was measured by finger photoplethysmography (Finapres NOVA, Finapres Medical 
149 
Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The Finapres reconstructed brachial waveform was used for 
150 
the calculation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) after values were back calibrated to an 
151 
automated brachial blood pressure measurement made at rest. Pulse oximetry (Finapres NOVA) 
152 
was utilized to determine peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2). Patients were 
153 
instrumented with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (Spencer Technologies, Seattle, WA) 
154 
according to previously described methods for location and standardization techniques (Willie et 
155 
al., 2011). Raw velocity traces of the MCA (right side) and PCA (left side) were recorded. All 
156 
data were interfaced with LabChart (Version 7). 
157 
 
158 
Following at least 20 minutes of supine rest, resting volumetric CBF measurements were made 
159 
using duplex ultrasound (Terason T3200, Teratech, Burlington, MA) according to previously 
160 
described methods (Thomas et al., 2015). Measurements of the internal carotid (ICA) and 
161 
vertebral (VA) were made ipsilateral to the MCA and PCA, respectively. Images were recorded 
162 
and stored as video files for offline analysis using automated edge detection software (Woodman 
163 
et al., 2001). No less than a one-minute video was used for the assessment of ICA and VA flow. 
164 
Global CBF (gCBF) was estimated as the twice the sum of the unilateral ICA and VA flow 
165 
measurements. Reliable images of the ICA were collected in all patients; however, due to 
166 
excessive neck movement from respiration (e.g. sternocleidomastoid contraction), reliable VA 
167 
images were only captured in seven patients. Therefore, the resulting sample size for VA and 
168 
gCBF is based on n=7. 
169 
 
170 
After the resting measures, the neurovascular coupling (NVC) response was assessed. For this 
171 
test, participants performed five cycles of 30-seconds eyes open followed by 30-seconds eyes 
172 
closed while PCA and MCA blood velocities were recorded. During the 30-seconds of eyes open 
173 
patients read standardized material. This test was conducted in accordance to published 
174 
guidelines (Phillips et al., 2016). The hemodynamic response to the five cycles was averaged and 
175 
used for analysis. Reductions in NVC are an indicator of impaired cerebrovascular function and 
176 
have been reported in a number of pathologies (e.g. stroke & dementia) (Phillips et al., 2016). 
177

Following initial resting measurements and NVC, low flow O2 was administered via nasal 
179 
cannula to normalize SpO2 to ≥96% for 20 minutes, following which time resting measurements 
180 
and NVC were repeated while O2 supplementation was continued. Therefore, measurements of 
181 
NVC and gCBF occurring 26.5±3 and 30.0±5.5 minutes following onset of O2 normalization, 
182 
respectively. Two subjects withdrew for reasons unstated, rendering the final maximum sample 
183 
size as n=14 for pre- and post- O2 normalization data. 
184 
 
185 
Calculations 
186 
 
187 
To provide further insight into the role of oxygen therapy on cerebral vascular function we have 
188 
estimated CDO2 by combining our pulse-oximetry data and gCBF measures as follows: 
189 
 
190 
eCDO2 (mL · min-1) = gCBF (mL · min-1) x eCaO2 (mL · dL-1)/100 
191 
 
192 
Where eCDO2 represents estimated cerebral oxygen delivery and CaO2 represents arterial oxygen 
193 
content. Given the negligible contribution of dissolved O2 to total CaO2 (i.e. PaO2 x 0.003) under 
194 
physiological ranges of PaO2, we estimated CaO2 from SpO2 and [Hb] as follows: 
195 
 
196 
eCaO2 (mL · dL-1) = 1.35 x [Hb] (g · dL-1) x SpO2 (%) ÷ 100  
197 
 
198 
Where eCaO2 represents estimated arterial oxygen content and [Hb] represents hemoglobin 
199 
concentration. In the COPD patients [Hb] was taken from two separate arterial blood gases over 
200 
6-months prior to testing (i.e. same values as in Table 1).  
201 
 
202 
Statistical Analyses 
203 
 
204 
Sample size was determined a priori based upon similar studies (Patterson et al., 1952; Albayrak 
205 
et al., 2006) and sample size calculations (G*Power, V3.1). It was determined that with a power 
206 
of 0.8, 15 subjects would be required to detect a 100 mL · min-1 change in gCBF (e.g., 13% 
207 
change from typical value of 750mL mL · min-1) – or 25 mL · min-1 change in unilateral ICA 
208 
flow. Resting variables pre- and post- O2 normalization, as well as NVC parameters were 
209 
 Cerebral oxygen delivery in COPD 
8 
 
compared using two-tailed paired t-tests. When significant main effects were determined 
210 
Bonferroni post hoc tests were ran, and corrected for multiple comparisons. Effect size was 
211 
calculated as the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of the difference. Statistical 
212 
analyses were performed in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (V24) with 
213 
significance determined a prior as P<0.05.  
214 
 
215 
RESULTS 
216 
 
217 
O2 normalization in COPD patients  
218 
 
219 
In total, 14 participants completed both pre and post O2 normalization testing. Resting variables 
220 
are presented in Table 2. As expected, SpO2 increased following O2 normalization from 91.0±3.3 
221 
to 97.4±3.0 % (P<0.01). There was no change in internal carotid artery flow (QICA), vertebral 
222 
artery flow (QVA), gCBF (Figure 1), MCAv, PCAv, or MAP following O2 normalization; 
223 
however, there was a reduction in HR (P=0.03). Maintained gCBF in combination with elevated 
224 
SpO2 resulted in improved eCDO2 in the COPD patients (98.1±25.7 vs. 108.7±28.4 mL · dL-1; 
225 
P=0.02). The sample sizes for each comparison are noted in Table 2.  
226 
 
227 
Results from the neurovascular coupling trials (n=11) pre and post O2 normalization are 
228 
presented in Table 3 and Figure 2. Notably, the peak relative and absolute increases in PCAv 
229 
were unaltered following O2 normalization (Table 3 & Figure 2). Despite this the peak percent 
230 
increase in PCA cerebrovascular conductance (CVC) upon transition from eyes closed to eyes 
231 
open increased by 40% (from 20.4±9.9 to 28.0±10.4%) following O2 normalization (P=0.04). 
232 
Accordingly, the peak drop in PCA cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) was also increased from -
233 
16.7±7.3 to -21.4±6.6% (P=0.04) following O2 normalization. We also observed a significant 
234 
improvement in the magnitude of the peak absolute reduction in CVR (-0.46±0.25 vs. -
235 
0.64±0.27; P<0.01). The lack of change in PCAv despite the apparent influence on changes in 
236 
vasomotor tone (i.e. CVC & CVR) following can be attributed to a differing MAP response 
237 
during NVC prior to and during O2 normalization (Figure 3). It can be seen by the mean trace 
238 
(Figure 3A) and the peak (Figure 3B) and average (Figure 3C) change in MAP during NVC that 
239 
the greater average and peak increase in MAP during room air breathing facilitated the increase 
240 
 Cerebral oxygen delivery in COPD 
9 
 
in PCAv during NVC. Therefore, the same magnitude of PCAv response (Figure 2A, B & C) 
241 
despite a lower driving force (i.e. MAP) resulted in the larger changes in vasomotor tone during 
242 
O2 normalization (Figure 2, panels D-I). 
243 
 
244 
 
245 
 
246 
DISCUSSION 
247 
 
248 
The primary novel findings of the current study are that, contrary to our hypothesis, acute 
249 
normalization of SpO2 with low flow supplemental O2 does not alter resting CBF in COPD 
250 
patients; however, O2 normalization improves both CDO2 and NVC (a functional marker of 
251 
cerebrovascular health). Collectively our results indicate that O2 therapy is related to an 
252 
improvement in neurovascular function in COPD, potentially related to improved CDO2. Further, 
253 
our results indicate a cerebrovascular insensitivity to normalization of SpO2 in patients with 
254 
COPD; however, this insensitivity of CBF to acute increases in SpO2 appears to possess a 
255 
positive effect, as increased CaO2 without a reduction in gCBF is responsible for the improved 
256 
CDO2 in COPD. 
257 
 
258 
There is a paucity of experimental studies examining how altered resting arterial blood gases 
259 
effect CBF in COPD patients (Beaudin et al., 2017). Herein we have provided support for the 
260 
notion that O2 normalization does not affect CBF in moderate-to-very severe COPD patients. 
261 
While we are aware our gCBF measures are limited in sample size (n=7), we did collect ICA 
262 
flow and intracranial velocity data in a larger percentage of our subjects (n=14 for ICA flow) and 
263 
these data reinforce our gCBF findings of no change with O2 normalization. In comparison, the 
264 
first study to investigate the influence of oxygen on CBF in COPD patients was in 1952, where 
265 
investigators administered 85-100% oxygen to hypoxemic emphysema patients for 20-minutes 
266 
increasing SaO2 from 68 to 93% (Patterson et al., 1952). While one would expect removal of a 
267 
hypoxic stimulus to reduce CBF secondary to disengaging hypoxic cerebral vasodilation, the 
268 
opposite effect was observed - CBF was elevated by ~14% (Patterson et al., 1952). However, 
269 
this elevation in CBF was likely due to the 12 mmHg increase in the partial pressure of carbon 
270 
dioxide that occurred during O2 breathing (presumably as a result of hypoventilation). More 
271 
 Cerebral oxygen delivery in COPD 
10 
 
recently, a transcranial Doppler study by Cannizzaro and colleagues observed no influence of O2 
272 
normalization on intra-cranial cerebral blood velocity in hypercapnic COPD patients (Cannizzaro 
273 
et al., 1997). These latter findings may be due to: 1) transcranial Doppler ultrasound is limited in 
274 
its capacity to assess changes in volumetric CBF due to exclusively quantifying blood velocity 
275 
(Ainslie & Hoiland, 2014; Hoiland & Ainslie, 2016); 2) the hypercapnic vasodilation typically 
276 
associated with the high PaCO2 observed in the patients (mean: 64.7mmHg) may have 
277 
overridden any influence of disengaging hypoxic cerebral vasodilation to hypoxia; or 3) there is 
278 
no influence of O2 normalization on CBF in COPD patients (i.e. a lack of O2 sensitivity). Our 
279 
study supports the notion that O2 normalization does not affect CBF in moderate to very severe 
280 
CODP patients.  
281 
 
282 
Our data in COPD patients are at odds with those previously collected in healthy individuals 
283 
whereby a reduction in gCBF is observed following O2 normalization 1 week after arrival to 
284 
5050 m (Willie et al., 2015). Indeed, the prototypical response to withdrawal of a hypoxic 
285 
stimulus is a reduction in CBF. This indicates that the lack of responsiveness to O2 normalization 
286 
in COPD is not representative of normal cerebrovascular function. To judiciously interpret this 
287 
notion, it is important to consider that differences between healthy individuals and COPD 
288 
patients to O2 normalization may be the result of differences in systemic inflammation, oxidative 
289 
stress, age, or medications and their potential influences in vascular control (Hoffman et al., 
290 
1984; Barnes, 2014; Austin et al., 2016). Importantly, this abnormal response (i.e. lack of 
291 
response) in COPD patients to O2 normalization underlies the primary finding of unchanged 
292 
CBF with concurrently improved CDO2 and NVC following O2 normalization in COPD. Of 
293 
relevance to the experimental stimulus, previous data providing similar O2 supplementation have 
294 
shown an increase in PaO2 without a concurrent change in PaCO2 (van Helvoort et al., 2006) in 
295 
COPD patients indicating the lack of change of gCBF in our COPD patients is unlikely due to 
296 
altered PaCO2 but related to vascular changes that may be a result of their disease and/or 
297 
medications. However, while it cannot be ignored that the physiological consequences of O2 
298 
normalization depend to an extent on whether the stimulus is poikilocapnic or isocapnic, our 
299 
current experimental design reflects the stimulus associated with home O2 therapy.

 Cerebral oxygen delivery in COPD 
11 
 
A recently conducted clinical trial (LTOTTR, 2017) has called into question the efficacy of long-
302 
term oxygen therapy on reducing mortality in COPD patients although previous landmark trials 
303 
have displayed a reduction in mortality with long-term oxygen therapy (NOTTG, 1980; 
304 
MRCWP, 1981). Differences in study patients notwithstanding, this important question arises: 
305 
Are there other potential benefits of long-term oxygen therapy worth considering? For example, 
306 
there is an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment in patients with 
307 
COPD (reviewed in: (Lahousse et al., 2015)). However, the physiological pathways linking 
308 
COPD to deteriorated cerebral vascular function and increased risk have yet to be disentangled. 
309 
While cerebrovascular insufficiency is a contributory factor to coinciding cerebral vascular 
310 
dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Iadecola, 2010), O2 therapy reduces the risk of cognitive 
311 
impairment in COPD patients (Thakur et al., 2010). Thus, it stands to reason that a mechanism 
312 
for this is an improvement in CDO2. Indeed, the observed improvement in NVC coincided with 
313 
improved CDO2 and may represent a physiological link between long-term O2 therapy and the 
314 
reduced risk for dementia. As CDO2 is the product of CaO2 and CBF, an increase in SaO2 will 
315 
improve CDO2 if the consequent increase in CaO2 is not outweighed by disengagement of 
316 
hypoxic cerebral vasodilation and a reduction in CBF. The lack of sensitivity to O2 normalization 
317 
observed in our COPD patients contributed to the increase in CDO2 with low flow 
318 
supplementation O2 and may be fortuitously beneficial in the context of low O2 therapy and 
319 
cerebrovascular function.  
320 
 
321 
CONCLUSIONS 
322 
 
323 
Although low flow supplemental O2 does not alter volumetric gCBF in COPD patients, the 
324 
increased SpO2 results in improved CDO2 and neurovascular function. This improvement in 
325 
CDO2 and neurovascular function with supplemental O2 may underscore the cognitive benefits, 
326 
and reduced risk of cognitive impairment associated with O2 therapy in COPD.

476 
normalization data are represented by the open circles (○), while the post O2 normalization data 
477 
are represented by the closed square symbol (■) with error bars representing the standard error. 
478 
Panel B highlights the individual data for the peak absolute (mmHg) change in mean arterial 
479 
pressure (MAP) during NVC – the MAP response was significantly lower during O2 
480 
normalization (P=0.01; Effect size=0.91). Panel C highlights the individual data for the average 
481 
absolute (mmHg) change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during NVC (analogous to area under 
482 
the curve as time is matched between trials) – the MAP response was significantly lower during 
483 
O2 normalization (P=0.02; Effect size=0.84).
