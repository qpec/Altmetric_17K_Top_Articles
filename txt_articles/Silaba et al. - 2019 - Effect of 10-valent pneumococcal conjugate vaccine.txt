Summary
Background Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) are highly protective against invasive pneumococcal disease 
caused by vaccine serotypes, but the burden of pneumococcal disease in low-income and middle-income countries is 
dominated by pneumonia, most of which is non-bacteraemic. We examined the effect of 10-valent PCV on the 
incidence of pneumonia in Kenya.
Methods We linked prospective hospital surveillance for clinically-defined WHO severe or very severe pneumonia at 
Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, from 2002 to 2015, to population surveillance at Kilifi Health and Demographic 
Surveillance System, comprising 45 000 children younger than 5 years. Chest radiographs were read according to a 
WHO standard. A 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PCV10) 
was introduced in Kenya in January, 2011. In Kilifi, there was a three-dose catch-up campaign for infants (aged <1 year) 
and a two-dose catch-up campaign for children aged 1–4 years, between January and March, 2011. We estimated the 
effect of PCV10 on the incidence of clinically-defined and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia through interrupted 
time-series analysis, accounting for seasonal and temporal trends.
Findings Between May 1, 2002 and March 31, 2015, 44 771 children aged 2–143 months were admitted to Kilifi County 
Hospital. We excluded 810 admissions between January and March, 2011, and 182 admissions during nurses’ strikes. 
In 2002–03, the incidence of admission with clinically-defined pneumonia was 2170 per 100 000 in children aged 
2–59 months. By the end of the catch-up campaign in 2011, 4997 (61·1%) of 8181 children aged 2–11 months had 
received at least two doses of PCV10 and 23 298 (62·3%) of 37 416 children aged 12–59 months had received at least 
one dose. Across the 13 years of surveillance, the incidence of clinically-defined pneumonia declined by 0·5% 
per month, independent of vaccine introduction. There was no secular trend in the incidence of radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia over 8 years of study. After adjustment for secular trend and season, incidence rate ratios for 
admission with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, clinically-defined pneumonia, and diarrhoea (control condition), 
associated temporally with PCV10 introduction and the catch-up campaign, were 0·52 (95% CI 0·32–0·86), 0·73 
(0·54–0·97), and 0·63 (0·31–1·26), respectively. Immediately before PCV10 was introduced, the annual incidence of 
clinically-defined pneumonia was 1220 per 100 000; this value was reduced by 329 per 100 000 at the point of PCV10 
introduction.
Interpretation Over 13 years, admissions to Kilifi County Hospital for clinically-defined pneumonia decreased sharply 
(by 27%) in association with the introduction of PCV10, as did the incidence of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia 
(by 48%). The burden of hospital admissions for childhood pneumonia in Kilifi, Kenya, has been reduced substantially 
by the introduction of PCV10.

Introduction
After the neonatal period, pneumonia is the greatest cause 
of death in children younger than 5 years1 and, before 
the intro 
duction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 
(PCVs), the most common cause of fatal pneumonia was 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).2 PCVs are 
highly efficacious against invasive pneumococcal disease 
caused by vaccine serotypes and their introduction in 
high-income countries has decreased transmission of 
vaccine serotypes and reduced invasive pneumococcal 
disease among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. 
However, invasive pneumococcal disease represents only

a small fraction of the burden of pneumococcal disease. 
For example, in a randomised controlled trial3 of 9-valent 
PCV (PCV9) in The Gambia, 15 cases of radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia were prevented for every two cases 
of invasive pneumococcal disease.
In low-income and middle-income countries, the 
efficacy of PCV against clinically-defined pneumonia is 
lower (0–17%) than the efficacy against invasive pneumo-
coccal disease or radiologically-confirmed pneu 
monia.3–5 
This finding suggests that clinically-defined pneumonia 
as an endpoint has poor specificity for pneumococcal 
pneu 
monia. WHO developed a set of interpretive criteria 
and procedures to standardise the reading of paediatric 
chest radiographs in pneumonia cases,6,7 which defined 
an endpoint that has increased specificity for pneu-
mococcal pneumonia and commensurately increased 
estimates of vaccine efficacy (20–37%).3,4,8,9
Longitudinal studies of disease incidence, with an 
interrupted time-series analysis, are likely to capture 
the beneficial effects of herd protection due to reduced 
transmission of vaccine-serotype pneumococci and the 
effects of direct vaccine protection. These studies are also 
sensitive to serotype replacement disease if infection 
with non-vaccine serotypes leads to pneumonia. To 
date, there have been only two field studies of PCV 
effectiveness against pneumonia in low-income settings; 
one study10 had just 2 years of pre-vaccine surveillance, 
the other had none.11
In the USA, the effect of PCV7 on routine hospital 
admissions with all-cause pneumonia was estimated, 
using interrupted time-series analysis, to be a 
39% reduction in children younger than 2 years, which 
is substantially greater than the efficacy estimates 
against clinically-defined pneumonia or radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia in a randomised controlled 
trial.12–14 Unfortunately, in most low-income settings, 
the quality of routine administrative hospital data is 
insufficient for evaluation with this study design.
In an interrupted time-series analysis, after adjusting 
for seasonal and temporal trends in pneumonia hospital-
isation, the residual change in incidence associated 
with vaccine introduction is as robust an estimate of 
vaccine impact as is possible in a non-randomised 
design.15,16 Here, we aimed to use this method to capture 
the effect of PCV10 on clinically-defined and radio-
logically-confirmed pneumonia in a unique clinical and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between inception 
and Sept 1, 2018, using the MeSH keywords: “pneumonia, 
pneumococcal/prevention and control” AND “vaccines, 
conjugate” AND (“child” OR “infant”) AND (“South America” OR 
“central America” OR “Asia”, western” OR “Asia, southeastern” OR 
“Africa, south of the Sahara”), with no language restrictions. 
Our search showed that three randomised controlled trials of 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) among children aged 
0–2 years old in low-income and middle-income countries have 
examined radiologically-confirmed pneumonia as an endpoint. 
The efficacy of a 9-valent PCV was 37% (95% CI 25–48) in 
The Gambia, and 20% (2–35) in South Africa among HIV 
uninfected children. In the Philippines, the 95% CI for vaccine 
efficacy of an 11-valent PCV was –1% to 41% with a point 
estimate of 23%. Against clinically-defined severe pneumonia, 
PCV9 had an efficacy estimate of 17% (4–27) in South Africa 
(HIV uninfected) and 12% (–9 to 29) in The Gambia. PCV11 was 
not protective against severe pneumonia in the Philippines. 
These trials do not capture herd protection, which is a strong 
feature of the use of PCV in practice, or the effect on older 
children aged 2–4 years. The introduction of PCV7 in the USA 
caused a 39% reduction in admissions to hospital for pneumonia 
among children younger than 2 years; however, in low-income 
and middle-income countries, the magnitude of the effect is less 
clear. In The Gambia, the introduction of PCV7/PCV13 led to a 
24–31% reduction in radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, 
but the effect on clinically-defined pneumonia was 5–15%, 
dependent on age. A retrospective case-review study of 
admission to hospital with pneumonia in Rwanda estimated 
that vaccine effectiveness of PCV7 was as high as 54%. 
A randomised controlled trial of 10-valent PCV, done in 
Argentina, Colombia and Panama, showed a vaccine efficacy 
against radiologically-confirmed pneumonia of 25·7%.
Added value of this study
This study, with its long time-span, consistency of methods, 
and rapid introduction of vaccination to children younger than 
5 years with a catch-up campaign, provides robust evidence of 
the effect of PCV on pneumonia in tropical Africa. It is the 
first study to show the effect of PCV10 in a low-income setting. 
The introduction of PCV10 was associated with a reduction in 
admissions to hospital with clinically-defined pneumonia 
of 27% and with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia of 48%, 
among children aged 2–59 months. These effects are larger 
than those seen in randomised controlled trials, and are 
compatible with the development of herd protection. Our 
findings show that Streptococcus pneumoniae was responsible 
for at least 27% of all admissions to hospital with pneumonia in 
the pre-vaccine era and that the introduction of PCV10 has led 
to a substantial decline in childhood morbidity in Kenya and in 
the burden of hospital admissions.
Implications of all the available evidence
Pneumonia is the greatest cause of child death outside the 
neonatal period. It is also the most common manifestation of 
pneumococcal disease and, therefore, is the strongest driver of 
vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses. The evidence of a substantial 
effect of PCV10 against pneumonia will underpin policy making 
in African countries as they confront the challenge of sustaining 
PCV programmes independently from Gavi.

demographic surveillance platform in Kenya with real-
time monitoring of vaccine coverage.17,18 We introduced 
PCV10 with a catch-up campaign for children younger 
than 5 years to increase temporal specificity of the time-
series effect.
Methods
Study design and participants
We studied residents (aged ≥2 months to <12 years) of 
the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System 
(KHDSS). KHDSS has monitored births, deaths, and 
migration events in a population of 280 000 through 
4-monthly household visits since 2001.18
Kilifi County Hospital (Kilifi, Kenya) is centrally located 
within KHDSS and is the only paediatric inpatient facility 
in the study area. It has 55 paediatric beds. Since 2002, 
all admissions have been recorded using a standard 
electronic clinical record linked to the KHDSS population 
register.
We used WHO definitions of clinical pneumonia 
applicable at the start of the surveillance based on 
presentation with cough or difficulty breathing.19 Those 
with lower chest-wall indrawing but no danger signs 
had an admission diagnosis of severe pneumonia; those 
with at least one danger sign had very severe pneumonia. 
Danger signs were central cyanosis, inability to drink, 
convulsions, lethargy, prostration, unconsciousness, or 
head nodding.19 Since there were no specific definitions 
for children aged 5–11 years, we applied the same 
criteria as for younger children. Children with non-
severe pneumonia are not normally admitted and were 
not included in the surveillance. Admission to hospital 
with diarrhoea was the control condition. Diarrhoea was 
defined as at least three loose stools in the past 24 hours.
From April, 2006 onwards, children with WHO-defined 
severe or very severe pneumonia were investigated, 
whenever possible, with a single frontal chest radiograph. 
Presentation with convulsions or lethargy alone, without 
other signs of pneumonia, was not considered by the 
local ethical review committee to be sufficient justification 
for investigation with a chest radiograph.
Written informed consent was obtained from the 
parents or guardians of all participants in the study. The 
study was approved by the KEMRI National Ethical 
Review Committee and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics 
Committee.
Radiological reading and interpretation
Chest radiographs were taken with a Philips Cosmos-BS 
machine throughout the study period. A Philips Practix 
360 portable machine became available in March, 2012. 
The radiology system was digitised in August, 2011; 
thereafter, a Philips PCR Eleva-S was used to process digi-
tal cassettes (10 × 12 inches; 1670 × 2010 pixels). Archived 
film images were digitised using a Vidar Pro Advantage 
digitiser. Images were encoded using Hipax software into 
DICOM format at 150 dpi and 12 bits. All images were 
cropped to de-identify patients and remove peripheral 
clues about the radiological method used, before being 
distributed in JPEG format in batches of 100 selected at 
random from pre-vaccine and post-vaccine introduction 
images.
Radiological interpretation followed the standard de-
fined by WHO for the identification of primary endpoint 
pneumonia, which was used in the phase 3 trials of 
PCVs.6,7 We categorised images by quality: adequate, 
suboptimal, or uninterpretable. Uninterpretable images 
were not assigned a diagnosis. Primary endpoint pneu-
monia was defined by the presence of consolidation or 
pleural effusion, or both.
Each image was read independently by two primary 
readers: a consultant radiologist and a trainee paediatrician 
in Kenya.20 All images with discordant interpretations, and 
13% of those with agreement (as per our previous work20), 
were referred to three consultant radiologists in Oxford, 
UK, who arbitrated the readings. Concordant readings of 
the primary readers were considered final.
Vaccine introduction and monitoring
In January, 2011, a 10-valent PCV (Synflorix; Glaxo-
SmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), consisting 
of capsular polysaccharides of serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F conjugated to either non-
typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) protein D, 
diphtheria, or tetanus toxoid, was introduced in Kenya 
in three doses at weeks 6, 10, and 14. There was a 
three-dose catch-up campaign for infants during 2011. 
In addition, in Kilifi County, children aged 12–59 months 
were offered two doses of vaccine via campaigns on 
Jan 31 to Feb 6, 2011, and March 21–27, 2011.
Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine was 
introduced in Kenya in 2001. Rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix; 
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) was introduced, without a 
catch-up campaign, in July, 2014.
Vaccine surveillance was established in April, 2009, 
in 26 vaccine clinics serving KDHSS.17 Data clerks recorded 
all immunisations given against the identity of the child in 
the KHDSS population register at the point of vaccination. 
However, during the catch-up campaign, vaccinations 
were recorded against lists of KHDSS residents.
Statistical analysis
The incidence of admission to hospital with clinically-
defined pneumonia or diarrhoea was calculated for each 
month between May, 2002, and March, 2015. Children 
who had both pneumonia and diarrhoea were classified 
as having pneumonia alone. The monthly incidence 
of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was calculated 
between April, 2006, and March, 2014. Mid-month 
population counts from the KHDSS were used to 
estimate child years at risk in each month.
We fitted linear regression models to log-transformed 
monthly rates of radiologically-confirmed and clinically-
defined pneumonia to estimate the effect of PCV10.

The models included a period effect (pre-PCV10 vs post-
PCV10), monthly time trend, and seasonality, which was 
modelled using the month of the year. Differences in 
the time trends before and after vaccination were tested 
through the inclusion of an interaction term. We 
modelled the error as an autoregressive moving average 
process, using Aikake’s information criterion and plots 
of the autocorrelation function of residuals to choose 
the order of the process.21 After observing the results of 
the analysis of the control condition, we further analysed 
the effect of PCV10 on clinically-defined pneumonia by 
adjusting 
for 
monthly 
incidence 
of 
diarrhoea 
admissions, instead of time in months. Because of the 
opposite pattern of seasonal incidence for diarrhoea and 
clinically-defined pneumonia (appendix), we desea-
sonalised the log-diarrhoea series by subtracting trend-
adjusted estimates for the effect of each month. We 
smoothed the data using locally weighted scatterplot 
smoothing.
We excluded January to March, 2011, as a transition 
period during which PCV10 was introduced among 
children younger than 5 years. We also excluded

admissions in December, 2012, and December, 2013, 
because of nurses’ strikes.
When radiographs were not obtained, we used multiple 
imputations based on information on admission year, 
month of admission, sex, age, HIV status, malaria slide 
positivity, pneumonia severity, outcome of hospital 
admission (alive at discharge or died), referral, and day of 
the week when the patient was admitted. We created 
20 imputed datasets, via chained equations,22,23 and used 
Rubin’s rules to combine estimates across the imputed 
datasets.
We calculated vaccine effectiveness as 1 – incidence 
rate ratio (IRR) using the IRRs estimated from the re-
gression model for each disease classification. We 
estimated the absolute reduction in admission rates by 
multiplying the vaccine effectiveness estimates against 
the model predictions of incidence in the month 
immediately before the introduction of PCV10 in 
December, 2010. All statistical analyses were using 
STATA software (version 14).

Results
In May, 2002, there were 37 556 residents in KHDSS 
aged 
2–59 
months 
and 
44 672 
residents 
aged 
60–143 months. By March, 2015, these figures were 45 601 
and 62 502, respectively. By March 31, 2011, 4997 (61·1%) of 
8181 children aged 2–11 months had received at least 
two doses of PCV10 and 23298 (62·3%) of 37416 children 
aged 12–59 months had received at least one dose of 
PCV10. Coverage increased throughout the rest of the 
study period (table 1).
Between May 1, 2002, and March 31, 2015, 
44 771 children aged 2–143 months were admitted to 
Kilifi 
County 
Hospital 
(table 
1). 
We 
excluded 
810 ad 
missions during the PCV10 introduction and 
catch-up campaign period  (between January, 2011, and 
March, 2011), and 182 ad 
missions during nurses’ strikes. 
Of the remaining 43 779 admissions, 24 783 (57%) were 
residents of KHDSS (figure 1); of these, 8488 (34%) had 
severe or very severe clinically-defined pneumonia. 
Throughout the 13-year study period, the number of 
admissions to hospital among KHDSS residents aged 
2–59 months fell progressively, particularly those with 
severe under 
nutrition (defined as weight for age Z score 
less than –3) and a positive malaria slide (table 1). The 
prevalence of HIV infection among mothers attending 
the antenatal clinic in Kilifi County Hospital was 4·1% in 
2005–07, 4·2% in 2008–10, and 2·7% in 2011–15.
Among pneumonia patients, 4522 (53%) were admitted 
during the radiological study period (April, 2006, to 
March, 2014) and at least one chest radiograph was 
obtained from 2506 (55%). Radiographs were obtained 
from 51% (1732 of 3373) of patients in the pre-vaccine 
period and 67% (774 of 1149) in the post-vaccine period. 
During the pre-vaccination period (ie, before Jan 1, 2011), 
primary endpoint pneumonia was identified in 21% 
(185 of 867) of readable radiograph images among children 
aged 2–11 months, 26% (109 of 423) among children aged 
12–23 months, 24% (79 of 327) among children 
aged 24–59 months, and 34% (35 of 104)  among children 
aged 60–143 months.

children aged 2–59 months were 180·9 (95% CI 
163·0–200·2) per 100 000 person-years for the period 
before PCV10 was introduced and 110·7 (93·3–130·3) 
for the period after PCV10 introduction; the crude IRR 
was 0·61 (0·50–0·74). In the interrupted time-series 
model, which adjusted for season and time (figure 2, 
table 2), the IRR for radiologically-confirmed pneumonia 
associated with PCV10 intro 
duction among children aged 
2–59 months was 0·52 (0·32–0·86). The effect was 
greatest among those aged 12–59 months. There was no 
effect among children aged 60–143 months (table 2). 
Radiologically-confirmed pneumonia varied substantially 
by season, with a peak in November to January and a 
trough in April to June (appendix). After accounting for 
season and the vaccine effect, the under 
lying incidence of 
radiologically-confirmed pneumonia among children 
2–59 months was stable over time (IRR per month 0·999, 
0·990–1·007; appendix).
The annual incidence of admission with clinically-
defined pneumonia in 2002–03 was 2170 per 100 000 in 
children aged 2–59 months; incidence of admission to 
hospital significantly reduced across the study period by 
0·5% per month (figure 3). Pneumonia admissions also 
had marked seasonal variation, which closely followed 
that of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia (appendix). 
After adjusting for these factors, the IRR for admissions 
with severe or very severe pneumonia associated with 
introduction of the PCV10 programme was 0·73 
(95% CI 0·54–0·97; table 3). Vaccine impact was greater 
for severe pneumonia than for very severe pneumonia 
(table 3). There was no evidence of benefit to children 
aged 60–143 months.
There was no interaction between study time and 
vaccine era in the analysis of the incidence of clinically-
defined pneumonia, nor of radiologically-confirmed 
pneumonia among children aged 2–59 months. This 
finding indicates that there was no further development 
of indirect protection after the catch-up campaign.
After adjusting for seasonal variation and secular 
trends, the modelled incidence rate of clinically-
defined pneumonia in December, 2010, was 1220 per 
100 000 person-years among children aged 2–59 months; 
for radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, this value was 
301 per 100 000 person-years. By multiplying these 
incidence rates against the vaccine effectiveness estimates 
for clinically-defined and radiologically-confirmed pneu-
monia, the reduction in disease incidence attri 
butable to 
vaccine introduction was 329 and 144 cases per 100 000 
person-years, respectively.
The control condition—incidence of admission with 
diarrhoea among children aged 2–59 months—was not 
associated with PCV10 introduction (IRR 0·63, 95% CI 
0·31–1·26; figure 3). However, in age-stratified analyses, 
there was an association between PCV10 introduction 
and incidence of diarrhoeal admissions in those aged 
12–23 months (0·63, 0·41–0·99), 24–59 months (0·62, 
0·39–0·99), and 60–143 months (0·66, 0·46–0·95; ap-
pendix). The IRR among infants (0·79) was less extreme 
than the IRRs seen in older age groups (0·62–0·66). 
Truncating analysis time at the point when rotavirus 
vaccination was introduced did not alter these findings.
We explored whether the observed effect of PCV10 
on diarrhoea in some age groups suggested residual 
confounding in patterns of hospital presentation. To 
select a suitable control condition, we examined the 
correlation between annual counts of admissions with 
clinically-defined pneumonia in the pre-vaccine period 
against annual counts of admissions with other 
discharge diagnoses. The greatest correlations were 
with unclassi 
fied discharges and with gastroenteritis,

diarrhoea was greater yet (appendix). After adjusting for 
log-transformed monthly rates of diarrhoea admissions, 
instead of time in months, the IRR for clinically-defined

Discussion
This interrupted time-series analysis of the rates of 
hospital admission from a rolling cohort of about 
43 000 children aged 2–59 months in Kilifi, Kenya, 
suggests that the introduction of PCV10, with a 
simultaneous catch-up campaign for children younger 
than 5 years, was associated with a reduction in childhood 
admissions to hospital with clinically-defined pneumonia 
(by 27%) and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia 
(by 48%). The vaccine reduced the incidence of admis-
sion to hospital with clinically-defined pneumonia 
(by 329 per 100 000 person-years) and radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia (by 144 per 100 000 person-years). 
There was no effect among children aged 5 years or older.
The observed effect in Kilifi was considerably greater 
than the vaccine efficacy estimates from individually 
randomised controlled trials of PCVs. Against severe 
clinically-defined pneumonia, the vaccine efficacy of a 
9-valent PCV was 12% (95% CI –9 to 29) in The Gambia3 
and 17% (7 to 26) in South Africa.5 Against radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia, the vaccine efficacies were 37% 
in The Gambia3 and 20% in South Africa.8 In Bohol, 
the Philippines, the point estimate for vaccine efficacy 
of an 11-valent PCV against radiologically-confirmed 
pneu 
monia was 22·9% (–1·1 to 41·2); there was no 
protection against clinically-defined pneumonia.4 A 
randomised con 
trolled trial9 of PCV10, done in 
Argentina, Panama, and Colombia, estimated vaccine 
efficacy against radiologically-confirmed pneumonia at 
22·4%. These vaccine efficacy estimates, derived from 
individually randomised trials, measure only the direct 
protective effect of the vaccine, whereas the impact 
estimates in the present study combine direct and 
indirect effects. In the USA, the indirect effect of PCV7 
against pneumonia was substantial;24 it is not surprising, 
therefore, that the impact estimates in a real-world 
implementation in Africa are considerably greater than 
the efficacy estimates from trials.
There is relatively little information on the effect of 
PCV elsewhere in tropical Africa. In a retrospective 
analysis25 (2002–12) of clinically-defined pneumonia 
among admission case-records from five district 
hospitals in Rwanda, the impact of PCV7, introduced in 
2009, was similar to that observed in Kilifi (vaccine 
effectiveness 54%, 95% CI 42–63). However, a study of 
the effect of PCV in children younger than 5 years in 
The Gambia, comparing rates in the post-PCV13 era 
(2014–15) with those in the pre-PCV7 era (2008–10), 
found a 5–15% reduction in hospitalised clinically-
defined pneumonia, depending on age. For children 
admitted to hospital with radiologically-confirmed 
pneumonia, the reductions were 24–31%,10 which were 
lower than the 37% estimate derived from a randomised 
controlled trial3 of PCV9 in the same setting.
In Kilifi, across the 13-year study period, admission 
incidence rates were consistently reduced, particularly 
for malaria, malnutrition, and clinically-defined pneu-
monia. Over the same period, mortality ratios in infants 
and children younger than 5 years decreased sub-
stantially, suggesting that changing admission rates

reflect a genuine improvement in health, rather than a 
change in health-seeking behaviour. The effect of general 
health trends on the incidence of clinically-defined 
pneumonia in the pre-vaccine period was greater than 
the effect of PCV10 introduction in 2011. Among children 
aged 2–59 months, the annual incidence of clinically-
defined pneumonia per 100 000 children declined from 
2170 in 2002–03 to 1220 in December, 2010; however, 
with the introduction of PCV10, this incidence declined 
further by 329. In other settings across Africa, which 
have a higher baseline incidence than in Kenya, the 
absolute benefits of PCV10 are probably considerably 
greater. However, the full magnitude of the effect might 
take longer in the absence of a catch-up campaign.
The observed effect of PCV10 against radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia is substantially greater than that 
against clinically-defined pneumonia, suggesting that 
vaccine serotype pneumococci account for proportionately 
more cases of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia than 
of clinically-defined pneumonia. The WHO radiological 
standard was developed to generate an endpoint that was 
specific for bacterial pneumonia and, in the presence of a 
vaccine programme for H influenzae type b, it is relatively 
specific for pneumococcal pneumonia.3,6 However, as 
well as differences in effect, we saw marked differences 
in temporal trends; radiologically-confirmed pneu-
monia was stable, whereas clinically-defined pneumonia 
declined sharply with time. Clinical presentations of 
pneumonia and malaria are difficult to distinguish26 and 
the prevalence of malaria has declined sharply from 
1999 to 2007,27 suggesting that some of the temporal 
trends in clinically-defined pneumonia admissions might 
be attributable to changes in malaria incidence.
We estimated the absolute reduction in admissions 
with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia attributable to 
PCV10 introduction as 144 cases per 100 000 person-years. 
Separately,20 we have evaluated the performance of the 
study’s chest-radiograph readers in Kenya by comparing 
their readings of 1179 images against the consensus 
interpretation of three experienced consultant radio-
logists in Oxford, UK. Although the specificity of the 
local readers for radiologically-confirmed pneumonia 
was high (0·95–0·96), the sensitivity was relatively low 
(0·69–0·73).20 This disparity is unlikely to affect the 
relative estimates of the effect of PCV10, expressed as 
IRRs, but it does suggest that we underestimated the 
absolute reduction in incidence of radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia attributable to the vaccine 
programme by about 30%.
Following the example of previous studies, we selected 
diarrhoea as a control condition because it was common 
and should be unaffected by PCV10.12 However, we 
observed an unexpected decrease in diarrhoea admissions 
among children 2–59 months associated with the timing 
of PCV10 introduction (IRR 0·63, 95% CI 0·31–1·26). 
We examined whether there was residual confounding in 
the temporal pattern of hospital presentations by 
adjusting for diarrhoea admissions, instead of time in 
years. The point estimates for these incidence rate ratios 
are consistent with the hypothesis that the vaccine is 
protective, but the estimates lose statistical significance.
The decline in diarrhoeal admissions after PCV10 
introduction is unlikely to be due to a biological effect of 
PCV10. However, it might be a marker of another 
intervention in this area that is targeting diarrhoea at the 
same time as PCV10 introduction. The effect was 
significant in all age groups beyond infancy and was 
especially marked in those aged 5–11 years, who were too 
old to be vaccinated with PCV10 (appendix). In 2007, 
a campaign of community-led total sanitation was

introduced into Kilifi County to eliminate open 
defecation by encouraging behaviour change and 
building toilets. By 2012, 25% of the villages in Kilifi
 
County had this programme. It is possible that the 
campaign had some effect on the incidence of diarrhoea 
at the same time as PCV10 introduction. If so, the use of 
diarrhoea as an adjustment variable for temporal trends 
in hospital presentation would underestimate the true 
effect of PCV10 against clinically-defined pneumonia. 
Despite the ambiguity of the diarrhoea results, PCV10 
had a large and significant effect on radiologically-con-
firmed pneumonia in children younger than 5 years and 
the temporally-adjusted impact estimates for severe 
(IRR 0·60) and very severe clinically-defined pneumonia 
(IRR 0·87) are consistent with this finding.
The reduction, by 27%, in admissions with clinically-
defined pneumonia implies that at least 27% of these 
admissions were attributable to pneumococcal infections 
of vaccine serotypes.28 As we inferred for radiologically-
confirmed pneumonia, the greater effect of PCV10 on 
severe versus very severe clinically-defined pneumonia 
probably reflects the greater role of pneumococcus among 
cases of severe pneumonia compared with very severe 
pneumonia. Severe pneumonia was defined by lower 
chest wall indrawing, which is a marker of poor lung 
compliance during respiratory infection. Very severe 
pneumonia was diagnosed by danger signs used in the 
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness to define 
very severe disease.19 Children with danger signs, which 
included central cyanosis, inability to drink, convulsions, 
lethargy, prostration, or unconsciousness, probably 
include a reasonable propor 
tion of admissions who have 
febrile convulsions, malaria, sepsis, meningitis, and ence-
phalitis. Few of these children would have had an aetiology 
preventable by PCV10 and this observation might have 
diluted the estimate of vaccine effect against very severe 
clinically-defined pneumonia.
Several properties of the present study suggest that the 
associations observed between vaccine introduction and 
disease incidence were causal: the duration of surveillance 
was long and the surveillance methods were consistent; 
the vaccine programme was introduced with a rapid catch-
up campaign and nearly two-thirds of the target population 
were given an immunising schedule at the same time 
point; the analyses accounted for long-term trends in 
disease incidence and seasonal variation; and the mag-
nitude of the effects was large and therefore difficult to 
attribute to incidental unobserved improve 
ments in the 
environment. In addition, these changes in the incidence 
of pneumonia occurred simultaneously with a 64% reduc-
tion in the prevalence of carriage of the serotypes included 
in the vaccine29 and with a 68% decline in the incidence of 
cases of invasive pneumococcal disease.30
Taken together, these factors suggest that the intro-
duction of PCV10 in Kilifi, Kenya, has reduced the 
incidence of admissions to hospital with clinically-defined 
pneumonia by 27%, and of radiologically-confirmed 
pneumonia by 48%. Given that pneumonia, rather than 
invasive pneumococcal disease, causes the greatest burden 
of pneumococcal disease, these findings suggest that there 
is a considerable improvement in child health associated 
with the implementation of a PCV10 programme.
