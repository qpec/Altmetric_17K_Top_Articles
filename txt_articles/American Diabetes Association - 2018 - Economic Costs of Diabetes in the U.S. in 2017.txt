U.S. in 2017
Diabetes Care 2018;41:917–928 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dci18-0007
OBJECTIVE
This study updatesprevious estimatesofthe economicburden of diagnoseddiabetes
and quantifies the increased health resource use and lost productivity associated
with diabetes in 2017.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We use a prevalence-based approach that combines the demographics of the U.S.
population in 2017 with diabetes prevalence, epidemiological data, health care cost,
andeconomic data intoaCostofDiabetesModel.Health resourceuse and associated
medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance coverage, medical
condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys, Medi-
care standard analytical files, and one of the largest claims databases for the com-
mercially insured population in the U.S.
RESULTS
The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 is $327 billion, including $237
billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity. For the cost
categories analyzed, care for people with diagnosed diabetes accounts for 1 in
4 health care dollars in the U.S., and more than half of that expenditure is directly
attributable to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical
expenditures of ∼$16,750 per year, of which ∼$9,600 is attributed to diabetes.
People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures ∼2.3 times
higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. Indirect costs
include increased absenteeism ($3.3 billion) and reduced productivity while at work
($26.9 billion) for the employed population, reduced productivity for those not in the
labor force ($2.3 billion), inability to work because of disease-related disability ($37.5
billion),and lost productivity due to 277,000premature deaths attributedtodiabetes
($19.9 billion).
CONCLUSIONS
After adjusting for inflation, economic costs of diabetes increased by 26% from 2012
to 2017 due to the increased prevalence of diabetes and the increased cost per
person with diabetes. The growth in diabetes prevalence and medical costs is pri-
marily among the population aged 65 years and older, contributing to a growing
economic cost to the Medicare program. The estimates in this article highlight the
substantial financial burden that diabetes imposes on society, in addition to intan-
gible costs from pain and suffering, resources from care provided by nonpaid care-
givers, and costs associated with undiagnosed diabetes.

THE COSTS OF DIABETES
 Diabetes imposes a substantial burden
on society in the form of higher medical
costs, lost productivity, premature mor-
tality, and intangible costs in the form of
reducedqualityoflife.The estimatedeco-
nomic burden associated with diagnosed
diabetes in the U.S. in 2012 was $245
billion in the form of higher medical costs
($176 billion) and reduced productivity
($69 billion) (1). The population diag-
nosed with diabetes has continued to
grow, by ;700,000 people annually be-
tween 2012 and 2015, with prevalence
projected to continue rising over time as
the population grows and ages (2,3). Fur-
thermore, there continue to be changes
in the demographics of the population
with diabetes, health care use and deliv-
ery patterns, technology, medical costs,
insurance coverage, and economic condi-
tions that affect the economic burden
associated with diabetes. This study up-
dates previous estimates, with the goal to
quantify the economic burdenofdiabetes
at the national and state levels in 2017.
Such information can help inform and mo-
tivate strategies to reduce diabetes prev-
alence and burden.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The methodology usedis similar to that of
previous diabetes burden studies spon-
sored by the American Diabetes Associa-
tion (1,4), with updated data sources and
modifications to refine the analyses
where appropriate. Although the primary
focus of this analysis is the national eco-
nomic burden of disease, the national es-
timates are calculated by summing the
state-level estimates that reflect variation
across states in demographics, health risk
factors and lifestyle choices, prices, and
economic outcomes. (State-level estimates
of diabetes prevalence and costs are pro-
videdinSupplementaryTableA-16.)Allcost
and utilization estimates are extrapolated
to the U.S. population in 2017, with cost
estimates calculated in 2017 dollars using
thehospitalservices,physicianservices,and
prescription drug components of the med-
icalconsumerpriceindexortotalconsumer
price index (5).
Inputs to the study include both state-
level and national-level data. Sources for
state-level data include the American
Community Survey (ACS), Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS), and Long Term Care Minimum
Data Set (MDS). Sources for national
data (which are extrapolated to the state
level) include the Current Population Sur-
vey (CPS), OptumInsight de-identified
Normative Health Information (dNHI) da-
tabase,MedicalExpenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS), National Ambulatory Medical
CareSurvey(NAMCS),NationalHospitalAm-
bulatoryMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS),
National Home and Hospice Care Survey
(NHHCS), National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS), National (Nationwide) Inpatient
Sample(NIS),andMedicare5%sampleStan-
dardAnalyticalFiles(SAFs).Weusethemost
recent year’s data available for each of
these data sources, though for certain anal-
yses we combine multiple years of data to
increase sample size. Supplementary Table
A-1 describes how these data sources are
used along with their respective strengths
and limitations as pertinent to this study.
Estimating the Size of the Population
With Diabetes
For each of the 50 states and the District
of Columbia, we estimate the prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes for 480 population
strata defined by age-group (,18, 18–34,
35–44, 45–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69,
and $70 years), sex, race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic), insur-
ance status (commercial; government, in-
cluding Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s
Health Insurance Program, Veterans Health
Administration, and other government-
sponsored coverage; and uninsured),
and whether residing in the community,
a residential care facility, or a nursing
home. (Government employees and military
personnel and dependents with insurance
are counted under private insurance.) The
reason for modeling the large number of
strata reflects differences in diabetes preva-
lence and costs across these strata and that
different data sources are used to estimate
diabetes prevalence for people residing in
the community, in a residential care facility,
or in a nursing home.
The population database starts with
the 2016 ACS, which contains state-level
population estimates by age, sex, race/
ethnicity, whether the person has medi-
cal insurance, and whether the person re-
sides in a group setting. We use random
sampling with replacement to statistically
match each person in the 2016 ACS with a
similar person in a file containing patient
health information and risk factors. ACS
individuals residing in the community are
matched to a similar individual in the
2015–2016 BRFSS of the same age, sex,
race/ethnicity, state, family income level,
and insurance type. ACS individuals resid-
ing in residential care facilities and nursing
homes are matched to a person of similar
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state from the
2015 MDS and 2013 MCBS, respectively.
Diabetes status in the MDS and MCBS
is based on clinical diagnosis, whereas
diabetes status in the BRFSS is based
on respondents answering “yes” to the
question, “Have you EVER been told by a
doctor or health professional that you
have diabetes or sugar diabetes?” The
prevalence estimates exclude gestational
diabetes mellitus. These sources do not
contain diabetes status for children.
Therefore, we combined the 2014–2016
NHIS files to estimate national diabetes
prevalence rates for childrendbased on
self-report(6)like the BRFSS informationd
which we then extrapolated to the state
population files by age (6–12 and 13–17
years), sex, and race/ethnicity.
To estimate diabetes prevalence in
2017, we scaled the state estimates based
on population growth between 2016 and
2017 by demographic group. For valida-
tion, when we apply prevalence rates for
eachstrata(demographic,insurance,state)
to the 2015 population, our national esti-
mate of diagnosed diabetes is slightly
higher than that reported by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
(23.4 million vs. 23.0 million). Our higher
estimate possibly reflects that our analysis
incorporates data from residential care and
nursing facilities, whereas the CDC estimate
is based on a representative sample of the
noninstitutionalized population.
Estimating the Direct Medical Cost
Attributed to Diabetes
We estimate health resource use among
the population with diabetes in excess of
resource use that would be expected in
the absence of diabetes. Diabetes in-
creases the risk of developing neurologi-
cal, peripheral vascular, cardiovascular,
renal, endocrine/metabolic, ophthalmic,
and other complications (see Supplemen-
tary Appendix 2 for a more comprehen-
sive list of medical conditions and ICD-9
and ICD-10 codes). Diabetes also in-
creases the cost of treating general con-
ditions that are not directly related to
diabetes. Therefore, only the relevant por-
tion of health care expenditures for these
medicalconditionsisattributedtodiabetes.

 Theapproachusedtoquantifytheexcess
health resource use associated with diabe-
tes was influenced by four data limitations:
1) absence of a single data source for all
estimates, 2) small sample size in some
data sources, 3) correlation of both dia-
betes and its comorbidities with other
factors such as age and obesity, and 4)
underreportingofdiabetes anditscomor-
bidities in certain data sources such as the
NIS, NAMCS, and NHAMCS. Because of
these limitations, we estimate diabetes-
attributed costs using one of two ap-
proaches for each cost component.
For cost components estimated solely
from MEPS (ambulance services, home
health, podiatry, diabetes supplies, and
other equipment and supplies), we use a
comparison of annual per capita health re-
source use for people with and without di-
abetes controlling for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity. For nursing/residential facility
use (which is not captured by MEPS) and
for cost components that rely on analysis of
medical encounter data (hospital inpatient,
emergency care, and ambulatory visits), we
employ an attributed risk methodology of-
ten used in disease burden studies that re-
lies on population etiological fractions (7).
Etiological fractions estimate the excess
use of health care services among the di-
abetespopulationrelativetoasimilarpop-
ulation that does not have diabetes. Both
approaches used in this study are equiva-
lent under a reasonable set of assump-
tions. However, the first approach cannot
be used with some national data sources
analyzedde.g., visit/hospital discharge–
level files such as NIS, NAMCS, and
NHAMCS, which may not identify the
patient as having diabetes even if the
patient does indeed have diabetes.
The attributable fraction approach
combines etiological fractions («) with to-
tal projected U.S. health service use (U) in
2017 for each age-group (a), sex (s), med-
ical condition (c), and care delivery setting
(H), which includes hospital inpatient,
emergency department, and ambulatory
service(physician officevisits andhospital
outpatient/clinic visits):

Diabetes and its comorbidities are corre-
lated with other patient characteristics
such as demographics and body weight. To
mitigate bias caused by correlation, we
estimate age/sex/setting–specific etio-
logical fractions for each medical condition.
The primary data sources for calculat-
ing etiological fractions are the 2015
OptumInsight dNHI data and the 2014
Medicare 5% sample SAF. The dNHI data
contain a complete set of medical claims
for more than 31 million commercially
insured beneficiaries in 2015 and allows
patient records to be linked during the
year and across health delivery settings.
This allows us to identify people with a
diabetes ICD-9 (250.xx) or ICD-10 diagnosis
code in at least one of their inpatient med-
ical claims or in two or more separate
noninpatient claims during the year. The
Medicare 5% sample SAF contains claims
data filed on behalf of Medicare benefi-
ciaries under both Part A and Part B, and
as with the dNHI data, we identify people
with diabetes based on diabetes ICD-9
diagnosis codes. The large size of these
two claims databases enables the gener-
ation of age/sex/setting–specific rate ratios
for each medical condition that are more
stable than the rates estimated using
MEPS.
Unlike the MEPS data, the dNHI data
and Medicare 5% claims data do not con-
tain race/ethnicity and select patient
characteristics that could affect both pa-
tient health status and health-seeking
behaviors. For the 10 medical conditions
that are the largest contributors to the
overall cost of diabetesdgeneral medical
condition, other chronic ischemic heart
disease, myocardial infarction, heart fail-
ure, hypertension, conduction disorders
and cardiac dysrhythmias, cellulitis, occlu-
sion of cerebral arteries, end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), and renal failure and its
sequelaedwe estimate two multivariate
Poisson regressions, using data from
2011–2015 MEPS, to determine the ex-
tent to which controlling only for age
and sex might bias the rate ratios. First,
we estimate a naive model that produces
diabetes-related rate ratios for hospital
inpatient days, emergency visits, and
ambulatory visits controlling for age
and sex only. Then, we estimate a full
model that includes diabetes status as
the main explanatory variable and vari-
ous known predictors of health service
utilization including age, sex, education
level, income, marital status, medical
insurance status, and race/ethnicity as
covariates.
For the full model, our focus is not on
the relationship between health care use
and the covariates (other than diabetes);
instead, these covariates are included to
control for patient characteristics not
available in medical claimsdatathatcould
be correlated with both medical condi-
tions and health-seeking behavior. The
full model omits indicators for presence
of coexisting conditions or complications
of diabetes (e.g., hypertension), since in-
cluding such variables could downward
bias the estimated relationship between
diabetes and health care use for each of
the 10 medical conditions. The rate ratio
coefficients for the diabetes flag variable
in the naive and full models are then com-
pared. The findings suggest statistically
significant overestimates of the rate ra-
tios for eight condition categories for
both emergency visits and impatient
days when using the naive model. For
ambulatory visits, we find significant
overestimates in the rate ratios for five
condition categories from the MEPS-
based naive model compared with the
full model.
To remedy the relative risk overestima-
tion for these condition categories, we
scaled the rate ratios estimated from
dNHI and Medicare 5% sample SAFs using
the regression results from the MEPS
analysis by applying a scalar (with the sca-
lar calculated as the full model rate ratio
divided bythe naive model rate ratio). For
emergency department visits, claims-
based rate ratios are scaled down for
other chronic ischemic heart disease
(scale 5 0.89), myocardial infarction
(0.89), heart failure (0.86), hypertension
(0.63), cellulitis (0.89), occlusion of cere-
bral arteries (0.94), chronic renal failure–
ESRD (0.73), and renal failure and its
sequelae (0.77). For inpatient days, claims-
based rate ratios are scaled down for other

 chronic ischemic heart disease (0.99),
myocardial infarction (0.92), heart failure
(0.81), hypertension (0.69), cellulitis
(0.85), occlusion of cerebral arteries
(0.98), chronic renal failure–ESRD (0.72),
and renal failure and its sequelae (0.64).
Physician office visits are scaled down for
myocardial infarction (0.98), heart failure
(0.76), hypertension (0.87), occlusion of
cerebral arteries (0.93), and renal failure
and its sequelae (0.25). We did not find a
significant overestimate of the rate ratios
for general medical conditions for any of
the three health service delivery settings
comparing the MEPS-based naive model
andthefullmodel.However,acomparison
of the claims-based rate ratios with the
rate ratios calculated from the MEPS-
based naive model finds that the claims-
basedrateratiosforgeneralconditions are
significantly higher than the MEPS-based
rate ratios for emergency department vis-
its and inpatient days. Therefore, to be
conservative in our cost estimates, we
downward adjusted claims-based rate ra-
tios for emergency department visits (0.52)
and inpatient days (0.50) for the general
condition group by applying a scalar calcu-
lated as the MEPS-based naive model rate
ratio divided by the claims-based rate ratio.
Estimates of health resource use attrib-
uted to diabetes are combined with
estimates of the average medical cost
per unit of health care utilization, in 2017
dollars, to compute total medical costs
attributed to diabetes. For hospital inpa-
tient days, office visits, emergency visits,
and outpatient visits, we use the average
cost per visit/day specific to the medical
conditions modeled. We pooled the
2011–2015 MEPS files to estimate aver-
age cost per unit of health care utilized.
Although MEPS contains both inpatient
facility and professional expenditures
and NIS contains only facility charges
(which are converted to costs using
hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios),
the NIS has a much larger sample (n 5
;7 million discharges in 2014) and also
contains five-digit diagnosis codes. There-
fore, we use the 2014 NIS data to esti-
mate inpatient facility costs and use
the pooled 2011–2015 MEPS files to esti-
mate the cost for professional services.
Average costs per event orday bymedical
condition are shown in Supplementary
Table A-3.
Utilization of prescription medication
(excluding insulin and other antidiabetes
agents) for each medical condition is
estimated from medications prescribed
during physician office, emergency de-
partment, and outpatientvisits attributed
to diabetes. Average number of medica-
tions prescribed during a physician office
visit for each age/sex/race stratum is es-
timated using data from the 2013–2015
NAMCS along with 2012–2014 NHAMCS
for emergency department visits and
2009–2011 NHAMCS for outpatient vis-
its. We calculate the total number of
people with diabetes who use insulin
and other antidiabetes agents by combin-
ing diabetes prevalence and the rate of
use for these antidiabetes agents ob-
tained from the 2013–2015 NHIS. Aver-
age cost per prescription filled, yearly
average cost per insulin user, and yearly
average cost per oral agent and other
antidiabetes agent user are obtained
fromthe 2013–2015MEPS. Wecombined
the utilization of these medications with
the average cost per prescription to esti-
mate the cost by age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and insurance status. Average per capita
cost for diabetes supplies by age/sex/race
stratum is calculated from MEPS (exclud-
ing over-the-counter medications owing
to lack of data on whether diabetes in-
creases use of such medications).
The 2012 cost study estimated preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes among the
population in nursing homes by demo-
graphic using the 2004 National Nursing
Home Survey (NNHS) data but scaled the
diabetes prevalence estimates to be con-
sistent with an estimated 32.8% preva-
lence among nursing home residents
obtained from the existing literature (8).
In this iteration of the study, we use the
2015 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) MDS data to estimate di-
abetes prevalence among this population
and find that the estimated prevalence of
diagnosed diabetes is 25% among the
nursing home population in 2017.
Nursing/residential facility use attrib-
uted to diabetes is estimated using an
attributable risk approach where the
prevalence of diabetes among residents
is compared with the prevalence of dia-
betes among the overall population in the
same age/sex stratum. The analysis is
conducted separately for long-stay and
residential facility residents to estimate
total days of care. Unlike the 2012 study,
due to data unavailability there is no
separate analysis done for short stays at
nursing/residential facilities. Similar to
the previous studies, cost per day per
residentis obtained froma geographically
representative cost of care survey for
2017 (9).
Hospice days attributed to diabetes
represent a combination of length of
stay and diabetes prevalence among hos-
pice residents. The 2007 NHHCS is used to
calculate the number of hospice residents
with diabetes and those that have a pri-
mary diagnosis of diabetes along with the
average length of stay for each age/sex/
race stratum. Based on more recent esti-
mates available from the National Hos-
pice and Palliative Care Organization
(NHPCO) on diabetes prevalence among
hospice residents (10), the 2007 NHHCS-
based prevalence estimates for the vari-
ous strata are adjusted and updated to
impute the 2017 diabetes prevalence.
Cost per hospice resident per day is based
on the 2017 report from NHPCO (11) and
is combined with hospice days attributed
to diabetes to estimate total cost of hos-
pice care attributed to diabetes.
The 2011–2015 MEPS files are pooled
to increase sample size to analyze use of
home health, podiatry, ambulance serv-
ices, and other equipment and supplies.
These cost components are estimated
by comparing annual per capita cost for
people with and without diabetes, con-
trolling for age. Due to small sample size,
sex and race/ethnicity are not included
as a stratum when calculating costs per
capita.
Estimating the Indirect Cost Attributed
to Diabetes
The indirect costs associated with diabetes
include work days missed due to health con-
ditions(absenteeism),reducedworkproduc-
tivity while working due to health conditions
(presenteeism), reduced workforce partici-
pation due to disability, household produc-
tivity losses, and lost productivity due to
premature mortality (12). The approach
mirrors that used in the 2012 study but
with more recent data.
c Absenteeism is defined as the number
ofwork days missed due topoorhealth
among employed individuals, and prior
research finds that people with diabe-
tes have higher rates of absenteeism
than the population without diabetes.
Estimates from the literature range
from no statistically significant diabetes
effect on absenteeismto studies report-
ing 1–6 extra missed work days (and
odds ratios of more absences ranging
920
ADA Statement
Diabetes Care Volume 41, May 2018
 from 1.5 to 3.3) (12–14). Analyzing
2014–2016 NHIS data and using a neg-
ative binomial regression to control for
overdispersion in self-reported missed
work days, we estimate that people
with diabetes have statistically higher
missed work daysdranging from 1.0
to 4.2 additional days missed per year
by demographic group, or 1.7 days on
averagedafter controlling for age-
group, sex, race/ethnicity, diagnosed
hypertension status (yes/no), and body
weight status (normal, overweight,
obese, unknown). Diabetes is entered
as a dichotomous variable (diagnosed
diabetes 5 1; otherwise 0) as well as
an interaction term with age-group.
Controlling for hypertension and body
weight produces more conservative
estimates of the diabetes impact on
absenteeism, as comorbidities of dia-
betes are correlated with body weight
status and a portion of hypertension
is attributed to diabetes.
c Presenteeism is defined as reduced
productivity while at work among em-
ployed individuals and is generally
measured through worker responses
to surveys. These surveys rely on the
self-reported inputs on the number of
reduced productivity hours incurred
over a given time frame. Multiple recent
studies report that individuals with dia-
betes display higher rates of presentee-
ism than their peers without diabetes
(12,15–17). We model productivity
loss associated with diabetes-attributed
presenteeism using the estimate (6.6%)
from the 2012 studydwhich is toward
the lower end of the 1.8–38% range
reported in the literature.
c Inability to work associated with dia-
betes is estimated using a conservative
approach that focuses on unemploy-
ment related to long-term disability.
Logistic regression with 2014–2016
NHIS data suggests that people aged
18–65 years with diabetes are signifi-
cantly less likely to be in the workforce
than people without diabetes. It is un-
clear to what extent people with dia-
betes voluntarily leave the workforce
or do so because of diabetes. There-
fore, we use a conservative approach
(which likely underestimates the cost
associated with inability to work) to
estimate the economic burden associ-
ated with reduced labor force partici-
pation. Using logistic regression, we
estimate the relationship between di-
abetes and receipt of Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) payments for
disabilitydcontrolling for age-group,
sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension sta-
tus, and body weight status (normal,
overweight, obese). Diabetes status is
included in the regression both as a
separate variable and interacted with
age-group to provide age-specific
impacts. Study results suggest that
people with diabetes have a 3.1 per-
centage point higher rate of being out
of the workforce and receiving disabil-
ity payments compared with their
peers without diabetes. The diabetes
effect increases with age and varies
by demographicdranging from 2.1
percentage points for non-Hispanic
white males aged 60–64 years to 10.6
percentage points for non-Hispanic
black females aged 55–59 years. The
average daily earnings estimated from
the CPS for those in the workforce are
used as a proxy for the economic im-
pact of reduced employment due to
chronic disability. SSI payments are
considered transfer payments and
therefore are not included in the cost
estimates.
c Reduced productivity for those not in
the workforce is included in our esti-
mate of the national burden. This pop-
ulation includes all adults aged ,65
years who are not employed (including
those voluntarily or involuntarily not in
the workforce). The contribution of
people not in the workforce to national
productivity includes time spent pro-
viding child care, household activities,
and other activities such as volunteer-
ing in the community. We use per cap-
ita absenteeism estimates for the
working population as a proxy for re-
duced productivity days among the
nonemployed population in a similar
demographic. Whereas each work
day lost due to absenteeism is based
on estimated average daily earnings,
there is no readily available measure
of the value of a day lost for those
not in the workforce. Some studies
use minimum wage as a proxy for the
value of time lost, but this may under-
estimate the value of time. Using average
earnings for their employed counterparts
will overestimate the value of time. Sim-
ilar to the 2012 study, we use 75% of the
average earnings for people in the work-
force as a productivity proxy for those
aged ,65 years not in the labor force
(which is close to the midpoint be-
tween minimum wage and average
hourly wage earned by a demographic

c Premature mortality associated with
diabetes reduces future productivity
(and not just the current year produc-
tivity). Ideally, to model the value of
lost productivity in 2017 associated
with premature mortality, one would
calculate the number and characteris-
tics of all people who would have
been alive in 2017 but who died prior
to 2017 because of diabetes. Data
limitations prevent using this ap-
proach. Instead, we estimate the num-
ber of premature deaths associated
with diabetes in 2017 and calculate
the present value of their expected
future earnings. To estimate the total

 number of deaths attributable to dia-
betes, we analyzed the CDC’s 2015
Mortality Multiple Cause File to obtain
mortality data by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity for cardiovascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, renal failure,
and diabetes. We use the same esti-
mates as our previous study: ;16%
of cardiovascular disease (excluding ce-
rebrovascular disease) deaths can be at-
tributed to diabetes, and ;28% of
deaths listing cerebrovascular disease
as the primary cause and ;55% of
deaths listing renal failure as the
primary cause can be attributed to di-
abetes. To generate 2017 estimates,
we grow the 2015 CDC mortality data
using the annual population growth
rate from 2015 to 2017 for each age,
sex, and race/ethnicity group.
Productivity loss associated with early
mortality is calculated by taking the net
present value of future productivity
(PVFP) for men and women by age and
race/ethnicity using the same discount
rate (3%), assumptions, and equation
outlined in the 2008 American Diabetes
Association report (4). We combined
average annual earnings from the CPS,
expected mortality rates from the CDC,
and employment rates from the CPS by
age, sex, and race/ethnicity to calculate
the net present value of future earn-
ings of a person who dies prematurely.

 Employment rates for 2015 are used to
calculate PVFP.
We do not count productivity loss for
the population aged ,18 years. While
children constitute a small proportion of
the population with diabetes, omitting
productivity loss associated with diabetes
among children could bias low the cost
estimates. For example, the economic
cost associated with parents who take
time off from work to take their children
to the doctor for diabetes-related visits is
omitted from these cost estimates.
RESULTS
In 2017, an estimated 24.7 million people
in the U.S. are diagnosed with diabetes,
representing ;7.6% of the total popula-
tion (and 9.7% of the adult population).
The estimated national cost of diabetes in
2017 is $327 billion, of which $237 billion
(73%) represents direct health care ex-
penditures attributed to diabetes and
$90 billion (27%) represents lost produc-
tivity from work-related absenteeism, re-
duced productivity at work and at home,
unemployment from chronic disability,
and premature mortality. Particularly
noteworthy is that excess costs associ-
ated with medications constitute 43% of
the total direct medical burden. This in-
cludes nearly $15 billion for insulin, $15.9
billion for other antidiabetes agents, and
$71.2 billion in excess use of other prescrip-
tion medications attributed to higher dis-
ease prevalence associated with diabetes.
Health Resource Use Attributed
to Diabetes
Table 1 shows estimates of health
resource utilization attributed to diabetes
and incurred by people with diabetes as a
percentage of total national utilization.
For example, of the projected 162 million
hospital inpatient days in the U.S. in 2017,
an estimated 40.3 million days (24.8%)
are incurred by people with diabetes, of
which 22.6 million days are attributed to
diabetes. About one-fourth of all nursing/
residential facility days are incurred by
people with diabetes. About half of all
physician office visits, emergency depart-
ment visits, hospital outpatient visits, and
medication prescriptions (excludinginsulin
and other antidiabetes agents) incurred by
people with diabetes are attributed to
their diabetes.
Health Care Expenditures Attributed
to Diabetes
Health care expenditures attributed to
diabetes reflect the additional expendi-
tures the nation incurs because of diabe-
tes. This equates to the total health care
expenditures for people with diabetes
minus the projected level of expenditures
that would have occurred for those peo-
ple in the absence of diabetes. Table 2
summarizes national expenditure for the
cost components included, accounting for
nearly $1.7 trillion in projected expendi-
ture for 2017. Approximately $414 billion
of the total is incurred by people with di-
abetes, reflecting 1 in 4 (24%) of all health
care dollars. Costs attributed to diabetes
exceed $237 billion, or 57% of total med-
ical costs incurred by people with diabe-
tes. For the cost components included,
1 in every 7 health care dollars (14%) is
attributed to diabetes.
National health-related expenditures
are projected to exceed $3.5 trillion in
2017 (18), but slightly less than half of
these expenditures are included in our
analysis.Thesecostestimatesomitnational
expenditures (and any portion of such ex-
penditures that might be attributable to
diabetes) for administering government
health and private insurance programs, in-
vestment in research and infrastructure,
over-the-counter medications, disease
management and wellness programs,
and office visits to nonphysician providers
other than podiatrists (e.g., dentists and
optometrists).
The largest contributors to the cost of
diabetes are higher use of prescription

 medications beyond antihyperglycemic
medications ($71.2 billion), higher use of
hospital inpatient services ($69.7 billion),
medications and supplies to directly treat
diabetes ($34.6 billion), and more office
visits to physicians and other health pro-
viders ($30.0 billion).
Approximately 61% of all health care
expenditures attributed to diabetes are
for health resources used by the population
aged $65 years, much of which is borne
by the Medicare program (Table 3). Divid-
ing total attributed health care expendi-
tures by the number of people with
diabetes, we estimate the average annual
excess expenditures for the population
aged ,65 years and $65 years, respec-
tively, at $6,675 and $13,239. Health care
expenditures attributed to diabetes gen-
erally increase with age, although among
younger people, average costs are slightly
higher likely due to a higher proportion of
these cases being type 1 versus type 2
diabetes, are slightly higher for men
(mainly due to men having higher attrib-
utable fractions onseveralkey measures),
andarehighestfor thenon-Hispanic black
population due to a higher use of emer-
gency care and hospital outpatient care
(Table 4).
Figure 1 summarizes the proportion of
medicalexpendituresattributedtodiabetes
for each chronic complication over total
U.S. health care expenditure, combining
expenditures for hospital inpatient, hos-
pital outpatient, emergency department,
and physician and other provider office
visits as well as prescription medications.
For patients with diabetes who receive
care for peripheral vascular conditions,
39% of these expenditures are attrib-
uted to diabetes. For the general med-
ical conditions category (which includes
all care not included in the other cate-
gories), 8% of expenditures incurred by
people with diabetes are attributed to
their diabetes.
The population with diabetes is older
and sicker than the population without
diabetes, and consequently annual med-
ical expenditures are much higher (on av-
erage) than for people without diabetes
(Table 5). When we compare expendi-
tures for people with diabetes to expen-
ditures for a population of similar age and
sex, people with diabetes have health
care expenditures that are 2.3 times
higher ($16,752 vs. $7,151) than expendi-
tures would be expected for this same
population in the absence of diabetes.
This suggests that diabetes is responsible
for an estimated $9,601 in excess expen-
ditures per year per person with diabetes.
This 2.3 multiple is unchanged from the
2007 and 2012 studies.
After adjusting for inflation, the total
cost of insulin and other medications to
control blood glucose increased by 45%
from2012to 2017, to atotal of$31 billion.
The inflation-adjusted cost of insulin in-
creased by 110% during the same period.
These increases are attributable to both
an increase in the number of people using
these medications and the cost of the
medications themselves.
Indirect Costs Attributed to Diabetes
The total indirect cost of diabetes is esti-
mated at $89.9 billion (Table 6). Major
contributors to this burden are reduced
employment ($37.5 billion), presentee-
ism($26.9 billion),and premature mortal-
ity ($19.9 billion). Work days absent ($3.3
billion) and reduced productivity for
those not in the workforce ($2.3 billion)
represent a relatively small portion of the
total burden.
Of the estimated 24.7 million people
with diagnosed diabetes, analysis of
NHIS data suggests that ;8.1 million are
in the workforce. If people with diabetes
participated in the labor force at rates
similar to their peers without diabetes,
there would be ;2 million additional
people aged 18–64 years in the work-
force. However, using a more conserva-
tive approach (described previously)
where reduced labor force participation
is associated with receiving disability
payments, we estimate 756,000 fewer
working-age adults in the workforce in
2017dequivalent to 182 million lost

 work days. While disability payments
themselves are a cost to the government,
from a societal perspective they are con-
sidered transfer payments and thus not
included in the burden estimates.
The cost of missed work days due to
absenteeism is estimated at $3.3 billion,
representing 14 million days. If people
not in the workforce had similar rates of
days where they are unable to work due
to poor health as their employed peers,
this would equate to 14 million excess
sick days with estimated productivity
loss valued at $2.3 billion.
Reduced performance at work (presen-
teeism) accounted for 30% of the indirect
cost of diabetes. The estimate of a 6.6%
annual decline in productivity attributed
to diabetes equates to 114 million lost
work days per year.
The estimated number of deaths in
2017 attributable to diabetes is 277,000
(Table 7); for 85,000 deaths, diabetes is
listed as the primary cause. Of the 689,000
deaths where cardiovascular disease is
listed as the primary cause, ;111,000
(16%) are attributable to diabetes. Ap-
proximately 42,000 cases where cere-
brovascular disease is listed as the
primary cause of death are attributable
to diabetes, and 39,000 cases where re-
nal disease is listed as the primary cause
of death are attributable to diabetes.
The average cost per premature death
declines with age (reflecting fewer re-
maining expected working years), and
across all premature deaths, cost aver-
aged ;$71,700 per case.
Trends in Diabetes Costs, 2007–2017
Between 2012 and 2017, we estimate
that medical costs associated with diabe-
tes increased by 26% (from $188 billion to
$237.3 billion) when adjusted for general
inflation (Fig. 2). Adjusting for both infla-
tion and growth in diabetes prevalence,
the excess medical cost per person with
diabetes grew by 14% (from $8,417 to
$9,601 in 2017 dollars) (Fig. 5).
The indirect costs of diabetes grew
by 23% when adjusted for general in-
flation (Fig. 3), which on a per capita
basis reflects 11% growth (from $3,283
to $3,640 per person in 2017 dollars)
(Fig. 5).
Combined, the inflation adjusted total
economic burden of diabetes increased
from ;$261 billion in 2012 to $327.3 bil-
lion in 2017 (or 25% growth) (Fig. 4). Ad-
justed forinflation andgrowthin diabetes
prevalence, the average economic cost
associated with diabetes increased from
$11,700 to $13,247 (in 2017 dollars), or
13% growth (Fig. 5).
CONCLUSIONS
This study estimates ;24.7 million peo-
ple (;9.7% of adults) had diagnosed di-
abetes in the U.S. in 2017. Diabetes costs
the nation ;$327 billion, which includes
$237 billion in direct medical cost and
$90 billion in lost productivity. Similar to
estimatesin2007and2012,afteradjusting
for age and sex, annual per capita health
care expenditure is 2.3 times higher for
peoplewithdiabetescomparedwiththose
without diabetes. A large portion of med-

 For coststhatincludehospitalandoffice-
based services as well as prescription med-
ications and supplies, the costs to directly
treat diabetes are estimated at $29.3
billion. An estimated $37.3 billion in
cardiovascular-related spending is asso-
ciated with diabetes (with the presence
of diabetes contributing to higher medical
expenditures among patients seeking
cardiovascular-related care). Outside of
the chronic complication categories mod-
eled, the presence of diabetes is associated
with greater use of health care services
in generaldincluding longer stays in the
hospital regardless of primary reason for
hospitalization. This underscores that
simply aggregating all costs associated
only with diabetes diagnosis codes grossly
underestimates the medical costs directly
attributable to diabetes.
While much of the cost of diabetes
appears to fall on insurers (especially Medi-
care)andemployers(intheformofreduced
productivity at work, missed work days, and
higher employer expenditures for health
care), in reality such costs are passed along
to all of society in the form of higher insur-
ance premiums and taxes, reduced earn-
ings, and reduced standard of living.
Comparing the 2017 estimates with
those produced for 2012, the overall cost
of diabetes appears to have increased by
;25% after adjusting for inflation, reflect-
ing an 11% increase in national prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes and a 13% increase
in the average annual diabetes-attributed
cost per person with diabetes.
Study limitations include the following:
c Duetodatalimitations, we omitted from
this analysis potential increase in the use
of over-the-counter medications and
optometry and dental services. Diabetes
increases the risk of periodontal disease,
so one would expect dental costs to be
higher for people with diabetes. Small
sample size in MEPS data prevented
meaningfulanalysisofthesecostcompo-
nents. We also omitted expenditures for
prevention programs targeted to people
with diabetes, research activities, and
health administration costs. These omis-
sions underestimate the full medical
costs associated with diabetes.
c The study omits lost productivity asso-
ciated with care for diabetes of family
members (e.g., time off from work to
care for a child or an elderly parent
with diabetes). The value of informal
care and personal aides is excluded
from our cost estimate. Time and costs
associated with traveling to doctor vis-
its and other medical emergencies are
omitted. These omissions underesti-
mate the indirect costs associated
with diabetes.
c Also omitted from the cost estimates are
the intangible costs of diabetes such as
pain,suffering,andreducedqualityoflife.
c A complicating factor in estimating
costs attributed to diabetes is that
health behavior that affects both the
presence of diabetes and the presence
of other comorbidities, unless con-
trolled for, could result in an overesti-
mate of the link between diabetes
and use of health resources. Control-
ling for demographics helps to control
for this correlation. In addition, for
the top 10 cost drivers we conducted

 additional analysis controlling for other
important explanatory variables using
MEPS data, and based on the results
we reduced the etiological fractions
for several diabetes complications
and for the general medical conditions
groupddepending on care delivery
setting. This potential limitation also
applies to the estimates of indirect
costs attributed to diabetes, especially
the estimated productivity loss due to
presenteeism, potentiallybiasing these
estimates high.
c Other study limitations discussed previ-
ously include small sample size for some
data sources used, the use of a data
source (dNHI) that overrepresents the
commercially insured population for
the population younger than age
65 years, and the need to use different
approachestomodeldifferentcost com-
ponents because of data limitations.
Another limitation common to claims-
based analysis is the possibility of inac-
curate diagnosis codes. Claims data tend
to be less accurate than medical records
in identifying patients with specific con-
ditions due to reasons such as rule-out
diagnosis,codingerror,etc.Thedirection
of such bias on our risk ratio calculations
is unknown, although it is anticipated to
be small as there is no reason to believe
that the coding of comorbidities would
be significantly different for people with
and without diabetes.
Using a methodology that is largely con-
sistent with our previous studies conducted
in 2007 and 2012, with updated national
survey and claims data from previous data
sources, we estimate the total burden of di-
abetes in 2017. The estimates presented
here show that diabetes places an enormous
burden on society and has increased over
timedboth in the economic terms pre-
sented here and in reduced quality of life.
