Abstract
Background: Dendritic cells (DC) induce adaptive responses against foreign antigens, and play an essential role in
maintaining peripheral tolerance to self-antigens. Therefore they are involved in preventing fatal autoimmunity.
Selective delivery of antigens to immature DC via the endocytic DEC-205 receptor on their surface promotes
antigen-specific T cell tolerance, both by recessive and dominant mechanisms. We provide evidence that the
induction of antigen-specific T cell tolerance is not a unique property of CD11c+CD8+DEC-205+ DCs.
Methods: We employed a fusion between αDCIR2 antibodies and the highly encephalitogenic peptide 139–151 of
myelin-derived proteolipid protein (PLP139–151), to target CD11c +CD8- DCs with a DEC-205−DCIR2+ phenotype in
vivo, and to substantially improve clinical symptoms in the PLP139–151-induced model of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Results: Consistent with previous studies targeting other cell surface receptors, EAE protection mediated by
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 fusion antibody (Ab) depended on an immature state of targeted DCIR2+ DCs. The mechanism
of αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb function included the deletion of IL-17- and IFN-γ-producing pathogenic T cells, as well
as the enhancement of regulatory T (Treg) cell activity. In contrast to the effect of αDEC-205+ fusion antibodies,
which involves extrathymic induction of a Foxp3+ Treg cell phenotype in naïve CD4+Foxp3- T cells, treatment of
animals with DCIR2+ fusion antibodies resulted in antigen-specific activation and proliferative expansion of natural
Foxp3+ Treg cells.
Conclusions: These results suggest that multiple mechanisms can lead to the expansion of the Treg population,
depending on the DC subset and receptor targeted.

 Background
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a
disease that can be induced by several methods, and it is
a widely accepted mouse model for the human disease
multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is characterized demyelin-
ation of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) due
to autoimmune attack (Tabansky et al., 2015). Mice with
EAE display acute and chronic inflammation and demye-
lination similar to MS patients (Raine et al., 1980). In
mice, EAE results in progressive paralysis that begins at
the tip of the tail and moves forward along the body.
The most common method of EAE induction involves
injection of antigenic protein fragments of myelin, along
with an adjuvant. Recognition and uptake of these pro-
tein fragments by dendritic cells (DC) are necessary for
the subsequent inflammatory response to myelin (Izikson
et al., 2000). While DC comprise the smallest population
of leukocytes, they appear to be the principle antigen pre-
senting cells (APCs) of the immune system (Jung et al.,
2002; Steinman & Witmer, 1978). DC play a key role in
activating naïve T cells, including autoreactive T cells that
escape selection in the thymus (Serafini et al., 2000). They
also regulate the inflammatory response in EAE by
presenting antigen to T cells (Serafini et al., 2000;
Dittel et al., 1999).
While T cells are thought to be the primary effectors
of CNS damage in autoimmune disease, they interact
and communicate with various cell types, including DC
and B cells (Stern et al., 2014). Shortly after injection
with myelin protein fragments and adjuvant to induce
EAE, an influx of DC into the spinal cord and surround-
ing regions can be observed (Izikson et al., 2000; Greter
et al., 2005; McMenamin, 1999; Bailey et al., 2007; Lande
et al., 2008). This increase in cell numbers—which has
been proposed to be due to in situ differentiation (Gott-
fried-Blackmore et al., 2009)—is thought to indicate an
ongoing immune response targeting the myelin sheath
of neurons.
The target of the fusion antibody in the present study
was Dendritic cell inhibitory receptor 2 (DCIR2), which
is a transmembrane protein with a single C-type II lectin
domain (Nussenzweig et al., 1982; Steinman et al., 1983;
Dudziak et al., 2007). DCIR2’s ligands are thought to be
biantennary complex-type glycans containing bisecting
N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (Nagae et al., 2013). It is
expressed primarily on CD8- DC, which function in
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II anti-
gen presentation to induce maturation of helper T cells
(Th cells) (Dudziak et al., 2007; Kasahara & Clark, 2012).
In the absence of maturation stimuli, these DC are cap-
able of stimulating natural Foxp3+ regulatory T cells
(Treg) and mediating tolerance to self-antigens (Yamazaki
& Morita, 2013; Yamazaki et al., 2008). However, antigen
delivered with an adjuvant or another maturation stimulus
leads to T cell expansion and production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ (Kool et al., 2008;
Sharp et al., 2009). Inflammatory autoimmune demyelin-
ating diseases in mammals are thought to involve the acti-
vation of Th1 and Th17 autoreactive T cells that secrete
the pathogenic interleukins IFN-γ and IL-17 (Bettelli et al.
, 2004; Korn et al., 2009; Ghoreschi et al., 2010). In the
case of EAE, autoreactive T cells recognize the myelin pro-
tein fragment presented on the class II MHC molecules of
DC,
along
with
costimulatory
molecules
such
as
CD80 and CD86. This activates the T cells instead of
promoting tolerance, resulting in an autoimmune at-
tack on the myelin surrounding the nerves in the
CNS (Guidetti et al., 2001).
Several previous studies have indicated that targeting
DCs with αDEC-205 fused to MOG35–55 (myelin oligo-
dendrocyte glycoprotein, amino acids 35–55), results in
the amelioration of EAE in the MOG35–55 mouse model
(Idoyaga et al., 2013). αDEC-205 is a monoclonal anti-
body specific to CD8+ DC, and MOG35–55 is a minor
component of myelin employed in the induction of EAE
in C57/BL6 mice. DEC-205 is co-expressed with Langerin-
1 on conventional CD11c+CD8+DCIR2− DCs, and some
migratory DC subsets such as Langerhans cells and
CD103+ DCs. Different mechanisms have been proposed
for how DC targeting causes amelioration of EAE. Initially,
deletion or anergization of autoreactive T cells was
emphasized (Stern et al., 2010), but subsequent experiments
have revealed a prominent role for generation of Tregs,
resulting in antigen-specific tolerance. Thus, multiple mech-
anisms of tolerance induction can account for the effective-
ness of the αDEC-205 fusion mAb (Petzold et al., 2012).
Several EAE models exist, including the PLP139–151
model in SJL/J mice and the MOG35–55 in Bl6/DBA
mice. In each of the models, EAE can be induced via
the delivery of the appropriate peptide in synchrony
with Complete Freud’s Adjuvant (CFA). Previous stud-
ies have indicated that in the MOG35–55 model,
αDEC-205-MOG35–55
fusion
antibody
treatment
worked by two distinct mechanisms: T cell anergy and
CD5-mediated conversion of T regs (Hawiger et al.,
2004). In addition to examining whether the targeting
of a different DC subtype would also ameliorate the
symptoms of EAE, we were curious to investigate
whether the effects of DC targeting on the immune
systems are conserved between mouse models of EAE.
We therefore opted to use the SJL/J PLP139–151 model
because PLP is highly abundant in the CNS and the model
has clinical features that have been reported to be similar
to MS (Miller & Karpus, 2007). We have previously used
the SJL/J PLP139–151 model to characterize the αDEC-205-
PLP139–151 mAb mediated protection against EAE (Stern
et al., 2010), and the more detailed mechanistic analysis
presented here will enable us to compare the effect in the

 SJL/J model against existing C57/Bl6 literature (Miller &
Karpus, 2007).
In the SJL/J model, we addressed three separate func-
tional and mechanistic issues. First, we investigated
whether using the αDCIR2 fusion antibody (Nussenzweig
et al., 1982; Dudziak et al., 2007) to target a different sub-
set of DC (separate from subset targeted by αDEC-205)
will also result in EAE amelioration. Thus, we targeted
CD11b+ DCs, which in their mature state have recently
been proposed to be involved in the generation of
memory T cells, as opposed to effector cells (Kim et al.,
2014). We further sought to compare the effect of
pretreatment with each of the two different fusion
antibodies (αDCIR2 and αDEC-205) on the immune sys-
tem during active disease. Finally, we sought to investigate
whether the T regs induced by antibody treatment would
confer a protective effect in EAE.
Methods
Mice
SJL/J mice (H-2s) were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and maintained at
the animal facilities of Harvard University according to
the animal protocol guidelines of Harvard University
and Harvard Medical School. Thy-1.2 BALB/c mice,
congenic Thy1.1 BALB/c.Foxp3IRES-GFP mice (Haribhai
et al., 2007) with expression of a transgenic TCR reactive
to the influenza haemagglutinin peptide 109–117 (TCR-
HA109–117), and Thy1.1 BALB/c.Foxp3IRES-GFP x TCR-
HA109–117 mice that additionally express the HA protein
under control of a ubiquitous phosphoglycerate kinase
promoter (Pgk-HA) (Klein et al., 2003) were bred and
maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the
Experimental Center of the Medical Theoretical Center
(Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany).
All animal experiments that involved Thy-1.2 BALB/c and
Thy1.1 BALB/c.Foxp3IRES-GFP x TCR-HA109–117 mice with
or without additional Pgk-HA expression were performed
as
approved
by
the
Regieriungspräsidium
Dresden
(Dresden Germany).
Recombinant fusion antibody production
Eukaryotic expression vectors encoding the IgH and IgL
chain cDNA of cloned αDEC-205 (NLDC-145), αDCIR2
and the respective isotype control mAbs were produced
in the Nussenzweig laboratory (Rockefeller University,
New York, USA). For the generation of recombinant
mAbs fused to peptide antigens of interest, we first con-
structed double-stranded DNA fragments coding for ei-
ther PLP139–151 or HA109–117 with spacer residues on
both sides using synthetic oligonucleotides, which were
then added in frame to the C terminus of the cloned
IgH
chain
encoding
cDNA,
as
described
before
(Kretschmer et al., 2006). Recombinant mAbs were
produced, using the FreeStyle™ 293 Expression System
(Invitrogen), as described previously (Kretschmer et al.,
2006; Petzold et al., 2010). In brief, HEK-293 cells were
grown as suspension cultures in serum-free FreeStyle™
293 medium and transiently co-transfected with the re-
spective IgH and IgL chain plasmids using FreeStyle™
MAX reagent. The produced mAbs were purified on
HiTrapTM Protein G HP columns (GE Healthcare).
Effect of αDCIR2-PLP139–151 fusion mAbs on the induction
of EAE
To determine the therapeutic effect of DCIR2+ DC
targeting on the clinical outcome of EAE, cohorts of 6
to 10-week-old female SJL/J mice were either left un-
treated
or
injected
i.p.
with
1μg of
fusion
mAbs
(αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb, isotype control/ PLP139–151
mAb) 10 days before inducing EAE. Where indicated,
cohorts of control mice were injected with 1 μg of con-
ventional αDCIR2 mAb. For EAE induction, SJL/J fe-
males were immunized s.c. with 75 μg of synthetic
PLP139–151 peptide emulsified in CFA. Pertussis toxin
(200 ng, List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was
administered i.v. on the next day. The mice were regu-
larly monitored for appearance of clinical signs of EAE
(clinical score: 0–5: 1, limp tail; 2, hind limb paralysis; 3,
complete hind limb paralysis; 4, four limbs paralyzed; 5,
moribund).
Cell sorting and flow cytometry
Single cell suspensions of spleen, mesenteric lymph
nodes (mLNs), or various subcutaneous lymph nodes
(scLN) (Schallenberg et al., 2010) were prepared using
70 μm cell strainers (BD Biosciences). mAbs to CD4
(RM4–5, GK1.5), CD25 (PC61, 7D4), CD62L (MEL-14)
and Thy1.1 (OX-7), as well as Fc receptor–blocking
mAbs to CD16/32 (93) and Pacific Blue- and APC-
conjugated streptavidin were obtained from eBioscience
or BD Biosciences. The mAb to TCR-HA107–119 (6.5)
was purified and conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen)
in our laboratory according to standard protocols. Before
FACS, for some experiments, CD4+ CD25+ cells were
enriched using biotinylated mAbs against CD4 or CD25,
respectively, streptavidin-conjugated microbeads and the
AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). Samples were analyzed on a
LSR II or sorted using a FACSAria II or III (BD). Data were
analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.).
Adoptive cell transfers and mechanistic studies on DC
targeting
To assess the relative contribution of dominant toler-
ance to DCIR2+ DC-mediated protection from EAE,
cohorts of SJL/J mice were pre-treated with either re-
combinant αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb or conventional
αDCIR2 mAb (1 μg per mouse). EAE was induced as
Tabansky et al. Molecular Medicine  (2018) 24:17

 described above. At day 10 after EAE induction, the
spleens were harvested and 5 × 106 total splenocytes
were i.v. injected into naïve 6–8-week-old SJL/J females.
After EAE induction, the recipient mice were scored
daily for clinical signs of EAE (see above for details). For
mechanistic studies, CD4+TCR-HA+ T cells with a naïve
(CD4+TCR-HA+ CD62LhighCD25−Foxp3IRES-GFP−) and a
Foxp3+ Treg cell (CD4+TCR-HA+CD25+Foxp3IRES-GFP+)
phenotype were isolated
by FACS from peripheral
lymphoid tissues (pooled spleen and LNs) of Thy1.1
BALB/c.Foxp3IRES-GFP x TCR-HA109–117 mice and Thy1.
1 BALB/c.Foxp3IRES-GFP x TCR-HA109–117 x Pgk-HA
mice, respectively. Prior to i.v. injection into Thy1.2
BALB/c recipient mice, highly pure populations of
sorted CD4+TCR-HA+ T cells were labeled with 20 μM
eFluor670. The next day, recipient mice were either left
untreated, or injected with indicated amounts (100 ng,
1 μg) of recombinant fusion mAbs (αDEC-205-HA109–
117, αDCIR2-HA109–117). On days 7 and 14 after adoptive
T cell transfer and recombinant fusion mAb administration,
congenic Thy1.1+CD4+TCR-HA+ T cells in peripheral
lymphoid tissues (spleen, mLNs, scLNs) of Thy1.2 recipient
mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for Foxp3 expression
and cell division, as judged by eFluor670 dilution.
IL-17 and IFN-γ ELISpot assay
10 days after EAE induction, the fraction of cytokine-
producing cells among total splenocytes was determined,
either by using a mouse IL-17 ELISpot kit (R&D
Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
or by performing IFN-γ ELISpot assays as described
previously (Stern et al., 2010). All ELISpots assay plates
were counted using an Immunospot™ counter.
Statistical analysis
Differences between mean EAE scores were analyzed by
Student’s t-test. Elispot results were analyzed by the
Dunnett’s comparisons test.
Results
Preimmunization with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb reduces
disease severity of EAE induced with PLP139–151
To determine whether targeting DCIR2 could induce
immune tolerance, we tested whether preimmunization
with
the
αDCIR2-PLP139–151
fusion
mAb
improves
clinical symptoms in the SJL/J mouse model of PLP139–
151-induced EAE. Prior to EAE induction, cohorts of fe-
male SJL/J mice were either left untreated (no preimmu-
nization), received a single dose injection of 1 μg
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb, or equivalent amounts of a re-
combinant isotype control mAb fused to thePLP139–151
peptide (ISO-PLP139–151). After 10 days, EAE was in-
duced with 75 μg of free synthetic PLP139–151 peptide in
Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA), along with 200 ng
of pertussis toxin (PT) administered the following day.
Mice were scored for clinical symptoms every day after
disease induction. Overall, and as compared to control
groups (no preimmunization, ISO-PLP139–151), αDCIR2-
PLP139–151 pre-administration resulted in a substantial
delay in disease onset and a marked reduction in disease se-
verity, as revealed by mean maximum EAE scores (Fig. 1a).
All mice in the control cohorts developed clinical signs of
EAE by day 10 after disease induction, whereas EAE symp-
toms were not observed in mice that had been preimmu-
nized with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb until day 18. In
addition, disease severity was significantly reduced (p < 0.
003, Student’s t-test on multiple days, Fig. 1a) in mice that
had been treated with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb, as com-
pared to the control groups, which had not been preimmu-
nized or which received the isotype control antibody,
ISO-PLP139–151. Notably, the slight amelioration that was
observed in the mice treated with ISO-PLP139–151 was con-
sistent with previously published findings using other iso-
type controls (Stern et al., 2010). As this first experiment
indicated that there is a dramatic and statistically significant
difference between mice treated with ISO-PLP139–151 and
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAbs, we opted not to use the isotype
control in subsequent experiment, partly due to animal
welfare concerns. In the control groups, one mouse died
shortly after disease induction, and the remaining mice en-
tered a chronic phase of the disease, with a mean max-
imum score of 3 on day 14. In contrast, the maximum
mean score of αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb treated mice was
1.2 (tail paralysis) on day 20 (Fig. 1a). No mortalities oc-
curred in any of the mice preimmunized with the αDCIR2-
PLP139–151 mAb.
Steady-state DC are required for EAE protection conferred
by αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb treatment
Current thinking suggests that immature DC are re-
quired for immunization with fusion mAbs to be able to
protect against disease. To determine immature DC also
mediate
the
function
of
αDCIR2-PLP139–151,
co-
administered the antibody with the toll-like receptor 4
(TLR) ligand monophospholipid A (MPLA): a low-
toxicity derivative of LPS with potent proinflammatory
activity that induces maturation and activation of imma-
ture DCs. Ten days prior to disease induction, we preim-
munized a cohort of initially naïve SJL/J mice with
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb (1 μg) and MPLA, while SJL/J
mice injected with 1 μg αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb only
were used as a control. EAE was induced in both groups
of mice by administration of PLP139–151/CFA and PT.
Strikingly, 80% of SJL/J mice that had been preimmu-
nized with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb/MPLA died by day
15 after EAE induction, resulting in a mean maximum
score of 4.7 (Fig. 1b). The rapid progressive paralysis ex-
hibited by these animals was consistent with EAE as the

 cause of death. In contrast, control mice that received
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb only exhibited a mean max-
imal score of only 0.5 (tail paralysis) and no mortality
(Fig. 1b). Thus, the maturation and/or activation of DCs
by MPLA completely abrogates DCIR2+ DC-targeted
protection from EAE.
Adoptive transfer of splenocytes mice preimmunized with
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb reduces disease severity in
recipients
DCIR2+ DC have previously been documented to induce
expansion of T regs to produce a dominant mechanism of
disease suppression (Yamazaki et al., 2008). If this is the
case, than transfer of immune cells from mice immunized

ameliorates EAE (PLP139–151 abbreviated in the figure as PLP due to
space concerns). a Preimmunization with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb
(αDCIR2-PLP) ameliorates EAE in SJL/J mice. Pretreatment with
the αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb prior to disease induction decreased
severity of EAE in mice. Mice were injected i.p. with 1 μg of fusion
antibodies (either αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb or ISO-PLP139–151 mAb
(ISO-PLP) 10 days prior to disease induction (labeled as − 10),
and EAE was induced starting on day 1. Mice were monitored
daily for clinical signs of EAE, and disease severity was scored.
Mean EAE scores for mice in each group (n = 5) are shown. Disease
severity was decreased, and disease onset was delayed in mice that
had been preimmunized with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb. Mice that
received αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb had significantly lower disease
scores compared to controls that had not been pre-treated with
any mAbs. Significant reduction of disease was observed on days
12 to 19 (p < 0.003) and days 22 to 30 (p < 0.009). Mice treated
with DCIR2-PLP139–151 were also significantly different from control
mice treated with ISO-PLP139–151 (p < 0.02 from days 12 to 17 and 24
to 28). The data presented represent three pooled independent
experiments. b Using MPLA to induce maturation of DC concurrent
with mAb administration abrogated the protective effect of
preimmunization with DCIR2-PLP139–151. MPLA (10 μg) was co-administered
with either αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb (n= 5) or ISO-PLP139–151 10 days before
induction of EAE. To induce EAE, mice were injected with PLP139–151 in CFA.
Pertussis toxin (PT) (200 ng) was administered into the tail vein the following
day. Disease progression in mice that received MPLA with αDCIR2-PLP139–
151 mAb was not significantly different from control mice treated
with ISO/PLP139–151 mAb and MPLA (p > 0.05). c Adoptive transfer
of splenocytes from mice treated with αDCIR2-PLP139–151. SJL/J
mice were preimmunized i.p. with 1 μg of either αDCIR2-PLP139–151
mAb or αDCIR2 mAb alone ten days prior to induction of EAE. To
induce disease, mice were immunized with 75 μg s.c. of PLP139–151
peptide, and 200 ng of pertussis toxin (pt) i.v. the next day. Splenocytes
(5 × 106) were isolated from these animals 10 days after disease
induction and injected intravenously into naïve SJL/J mice along
with 75 μg s.c. of PLP139–151 in CFA, followed by PT (200 ng i.v.)
the next day. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of EAE
and disease severity was scored. Mean EAE scores mice in each
group (n = 5) are shown. Mice that received splenocytes from
animals that had been treated with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb had
significantly lower disease scores compared to recipients of spenocytes
from control animals treated with αDCIR2 mAb alone. The difference in
disease scores was observed days 15, 20–24 and 28 to 29 (p < 0.02,
Student’s t-test). The experiment was repeated several times with
similar results; a representative experiment is shown

 with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb into naïve congenic recipi-
ents should confer protection against EAE. To test whether
this is the case, cohorts of SJL/J mice were preimmunized
with 1 μg of either recombinant αDCIR2-PLP139–151 fusion
mAb or conventional (unconjugated to peptide) αDCIR2
mAb 10 days before induction of EAE. At day 10 after EAE
induction (20 days total after immunization), single cell sus-
pensions were prepared from the spleens of both cohorts,
and 0.5–1 × 107 splenocytes were injected i.v. into naïve
SJL/J mice. EAE was induced in transfer recipients the next
day. As expected, all mice that received splenocytes from
unconjugated αDCIR2 mAb-treated donor mice developed
severe EAE with high clinical scores (Fig. 1c). In contrast,
mice that had received splenocytes from αDCIR2-PLP139–
151 fusion mAb-pretreated donor mice exhibited substan-
tially lower disease scores at all time points analyzed.
Pretreatment with αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb reduces activity
of pathogenic T helper cells
Another potential mechanism for induction of immuno-
logical tolerance is the deletion or anergy of pathogenic
T cells. To determine whether this mechanism contributes
to EAE protection induced by preimmunization with anti-
bodies, assessed the impact of tolerogenic DCIR2+ DC
vaccination on the activity of encephalitogenic T helper
(Th) cells. For this experiment, cohorts of SJL/J mice were
either preimmunized with recombinant αDCIR2-PLP139–
151 or ISO-PLP139–151 mAbs (1 μg/mouse), or were left
untreated. Ten days post preimmunization, EAE was in-
duced in all groups of mice by administration of PLP139–
151/CFA and PT. Total splenocytes were isolated 10 days
after EAE induction and the number of PLP139–151-react-
ive Th cells secreting IL-17 and IFN-γ was quantified by
the ELISPOT assay (Fig. 2). Consistent with the slight EAE
amelioration observed in this treatment group, pre-
administration of the ISO-PLP139–151 mAb resulted in
somewhat decreased numbers of Th cells secreting cyto-
kines, as compared to control mice that were not preim-
munized (Fig. 2a-d). While the decrease in IL-17+ Th cells
in ISO-PLP139–151 treated mice was not significant com-
pared to controls, the decrease in IFN-γ+ secreting Th
cells was (p < 0.02). In contrast, preimmunization with
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 caused significant decreases the num-
bers of IL-17+ Th cells as compared to un-preimmunized
controls (p = 0.0059, Fig. 2a, b) and a highly significant de-
crease in IFN-γ+ secreting Th cells (p = 0.0001, Fig. 2c, d),
as compared to both control groups. Thus, αDCIR2-
PLP139–151 mAb administration prior to EAE induction
results in a substantial reduction in encephalitogenic Th
cell activity, possibly due to deletion and/or induction of
an anergic state in PLP139–151-reactive Th cells. Alterna-
tively, DCIR2+ DC targeting may promote the antigen-
specific suppressor activity of Foxp3+ Treg cells.

To
obtain
further
mechanistic
insight,
we
tracked
changes
in
numbers of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells after selective
delivery of antigen either to DEC-205+ or to DCIR2+ DCs
in the steady state. For this experiment, we took advantage
of a well-established TCR/agonist ligand transgenic model
system that can be used as a source of truly naïve
CD4+Foxp3− T cells and CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells with the
same antigen specificity (Klein et al., 2003; Hinterberger et
al., 2010; D'Cruz & Klein, 2005). In peripheral lymphoid
tissues of these mice, which have transgenic expression of
TCR-HA109–117, CD4+TCR-HAhigh T cells exhibit a naïve
CD62L+CD25−Foxp3− phenotype, due to the absence of
the TCR agonist ligand (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). In
contrast, in double-transgenic mice that co-express the
TCR-HA109–117 on CD4+ T cells and the HA protein under
control
of
the
ubiquitous
phosphoglycerate
kinase
promoter (Pgk-HA), the neo-self-antigen HA promotes
intrathymic induction and peripheral accumulation of
TCR-HA+Foxp3+ Treg cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1B)
(Klein et al., 2003; Hinterberger et al., 2010; D'Cruz &
Klein, 2005).
To test how CD4+ Tcells respond to treatment with differ-
ent fusion mAbs, we adoptively transferred small numbers of
FACS-purified populations of naïve CD4+Foxp3−TCR-HA+ T
cells into fully immunocompetent recipient mice. These mice
were either left untreated or injected with recombinant
αDEC-205-HA109–117 or αDCIR2-HA109–117 fusion mAbs
post-transfer (Fig. 3). In untreated CD4+Foxp3−TCR-HA+ T
recipient mice, congenic marker+ CD4+TCR-HA+ T cells
were still detectable in the peripheral lymphoid tissues on day
7 after adoptive transfer (Fig. 3a), but were below the level of
detection on day 14 (Fig. 3b). As expected (Kretschmer et al.,
2006; Schallenberg et al., 2010; Kretschmer et al., 2005), a
single dose injection of 100 ng αDEC-205-HA109–117 mAb re-
sulted in moderate proliferation (Fig. 3a-c) and concomitant
induction of Foxp3 expression in a significant proportion of
initially naïve CD4+Foxp3−TCR-HA+ T cells (Fig. 3d, e). In
contrast, upon administration of equivalent amounts of
αDCIR2-HA109–117 fusion mAb, CD4+TCR-HA+Thy1.1+ T
cells vigorously proliferated and exhibited only marginal
Foxp3 expression at day 7 after transfer (Fig. 3a, c). This
proliferation was followed by efficient deletion of essentially
all cells by day 14 after adoptive transfer (Fig. 3b, e).

seen in Fig. 1, pre-treatment with ISO-PLP139–151 mAb also resulted in a reduction of IFN-γ producing cells as compared to PLP-treated
mice (n = 2, p = 0.0124). Number of spots per million cells was calculated by multiplying the average of triplicate wells (2 × 105) splenocyes per well)

 Next, we assessed the impact of the two antibodies on
the maintenance, activation and proliferative expansion of
pre-formed CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells. To this end, we
injected
FACS-purified
Foxp3+TCR-HA+
Treg
cells
(CD4+CD25+TCR-HA+Foxp3IRES-GFP+) from the peripheral
lymphoid tissues of TCR-HA109–117 x Pgk-HA mice
(Additional file 1: Figure S1B) into fully immunocom-
petent, congenic recipient mice. Subsequently, the re-
cipients were either left untreated or injected with
recombinant αDEC-205-HA109–117 or αDCIR2-HA109–
117 fusion mAbs (Fig. 4). In peripheral lymphoid
tissues of untreated recipients, small populations of
congenic
marker+
TCR-HA+
Treg
cells
could
be
tracked 6 days after adoptive transfer. These cells did
not undergo proliferation in the absence of cognate
antigen, but maintained Foxp3 and CD25 expression
(Fig. 4). In contrast, treatment with both αDEC-205-
HA109–117 mAb (Fig. 4a) and αDEC-205-HA109–117
mAb (Fig. 4c) targeting of HA109–117 induced substan-
tial proliferative expansion of pre-formed, antigen-
specific Treg cells. This expansion led to an overall
increase in the number and relative percentages of
Foxp3IRES-GFP+ cells as a fraction of total CD4+ T cells, as
compared to untreated control mice (Fig. 4b and d).

were subsequently injected with either αDEC-205-HA109–117 or αDCIR2-HA109–117 fusion mAb. In both, a cases antigen-specific Thy1.1+ T cells can
be tracked in various peripheral lymphoid organs, and c αDCIR2 immunization results in somewhat increased proliferation. b However, on day 14,
essentially all Thy1.1+ T cells appeared to be deleted in mice immunized with αDCIR2-HA, whereas significant populations of Thy1.1+ T cells could
still be detected in mice that had received the same amount of αDEC-205-HA109–117 fusion mAb. Additionally, immunization with αDEC-205-
HA109–117 mAb results in increased Foxp3 expression, as detected on d day 7 and e day 14. In contrast, immunization with αDCIR2-HA109–117
mAb leads to a marginal increase in Foxp3 expression on d day 7, and e efficient deletion of all cells on day 14

 Notably, administration of αDCIR2-HA109–117 mAb lead
to at least 2.5-fold increases in numbers of natural
Foxp3IRES-GFP+ Treg cells selectively in the spleen, as
compared to untreated and αDEC-205-HA109–117 mAb-
treated mice. This increase was much less notable in other
peripheral lymphoid tissues, such as mesenteric or sub-
cutaneous lymph nodes. This observation could account
for dominant tolerance in DCIR2+ DC-targeted EAE
protection of SJL/J mice, as observed in the cell
transfer studies described above.
Discussion
Studies describe multiple methods of administering anti-
gens to induce tolerogenic mechanisms (Miller et al., 2007),
but the problem with repeated administration of antigens is
its ability to induce fatal autoimmune responses in mice
(Pugliese et al., 2001). This problem can be circumvented
by direct targeting of minute amounts of antigens to imma-
ture DC in vivo, allowing the antigen to be delivered effi-
ciently and raising the probability of a tolerogenic response,
while lowering the probability of adverse reactions.
It has previously been known that DCIR2+ DC induce
tolerance by expansion of existing Tregs (Yamazaki et al.,
2008; Kretschmer et al., 2006; Yamazaki & Steinman,
2009), but it was unclear whether targeting the receptor
with a fusion antibody in the EAE mouse model would
cause immune tolerance, and if so, what the mechanism
of this tolerance would be.
One notable difference between the MOG35–55 model
used in previous studies and PLP139–151 induced EAE

 used in the present study, is that preimmunization of an-
imals with large doses of MOG35–55 in the absence of
adjuvants is protective against EAE, whereas similar pre-
immunization with PLP139–151 is not (Kuchroo et al.,
2002). The striking amelioration of EAE by preimmuni-
zation with the αDCIR2-PLP139–151 fusion mAb suggests
that the binding of fusion mAb to the DC receptors al-
ters the response of these cells to antigen. The lack of
protection caused by free PLP139–151 preimmunization
in SJL/J mice indicates that protection conferred by the
fusion mAb is likely due to DC targeting. In addition,
while the SJL/ PLP139–151 model is a relapsing-remitting
model of MS, we could not compare the rate of relapse
between different treatment groups due to high mortal-
ity in the control group.
A dominant suppressive mechanism of immunological
tolerance probably plays a role in EAE amelioration in
mice
preimmunized
with
αDCIR2-PLP139–151
fusion
mAb. We did observe that splenocytes adoptively trans-
ferred from αDCIR2-PLP139–151 mAb treated mice effi-
ciently prevented EAE induction in recipients, suggesting
that the regulatory phenotype was mediated by a type of
immune cell (Fig. 1). However, as we couldn’t track anti-
gen specific T cells within the polyclonal T cell repertoire,
we could not assess conversion to Tregs.
Our subsequent experiments appears to indicate that
the amelioration of EAE by the αDCIR2-PLP139–151 fu-
sion mAb results at least partly from a block of early
antigen-specific T cell production in the peripheral
lymphoid organs. The reduced proportions of IFN-γ-
and IL-17-producing pathogenic T cells in preimmu-
nized mice supports this hypothesis (Fig. 2). It is likely
that both deletion and induction of an anergic pheno-
type in pathogenic T cells contributes to αDCIR2 mAb
mediated amelioration of EAE.
To assess how this phenotype may come about, we
tracked antigen-specific Thy1.1+ T cells transferred into
αDCIR2 or αDEC-205-HA109–117 fusion mAb treated
mice. Treatment with αDCIR2-HA109–117 mAb initially
resulted in somewhat increased proliferation of Thy1.1+
T cells (Fig. 4a and c), but by day 14, essentially all the
cells were deleted in these mice. In contrast, on day 14,
significant populations of Thy1.1+ T cells were still de-
tectable in mice that had received the same amount of
αDEC-205-HA109–117 fusion antibody. This important
finding may indicate that a primary mechanism of EAE
amelioration by αDCIR2 treatment is T cell deletion. To
confirm this finding, we quantified Foxp3 cells in
αDCIR2 treated mice and found an insignificant increase
in Foxp3 induction on day 7 after transfer (Fig. 3d),
followed by efficient deletion of all cells on day 14
(Fig. 3e). It should be noted that this observation is in
contrast to αDEC-205 studies, which found a prominent
role for regulatory T cells in EAE amelioration.
We also tested whether the low induction of Foxp3+
cells in the Thy1.1+ T cell transfer experiment was due
to a failure of Treg conversion or expansion by
transferring a small number of TCR transgenic CD4 +
CD25 + Foxp3+ Treg cells able to recognize an HA
peptide into immunocompetent congenic recipients.
The recipient mice were subsequently injected with
either
αDEC-205-HA109–117
or
αDCIR2-HA109–117
fusion
antibodies.
Interestingly,
both
αDEC-205-
HA109–117 (Fig. 3c) and αDCIR2-HA109–117 fusion
mAb (Fig. 3d) promote proliferative expansion of
antigen-specific Treg cells. Thus, both fusion mAbs
are able to induce Treg expansion, suggesting that the
low levels of Treg induction in the Thy1.1+ positive T
cell transfer experiment are due to a failure to induce
Treg conversion.
Fig. 5 Potential mechanism of action of a αDEC-205 and b αDCIR2 fusion mAbs. The fusion mAb consist of an antibody against either receptor,
with an antigen fused to the constant region. Both antibodies will target receptors on the surface of the DC. Once bound to DC, the fusion mAb
delivers the antigen. This antigen delivery leads to anergization or deletion of pathogenic T cells, expansion of thymus derived Tregs, or
induction of peripherally derived Tregs. The dominant mechanism of αDEC-205 fusion mAb is induction of peripherally derived Tregs, whereas
the dominant mechanism of αDCIR2 fusion mAb is expansion of thymus derived Tregs
Tabansky et al. Molecular Medicine  (2018) 24:17 
Page 10 of 13
 These observations confirm the recently proposed dif-
ference between DEC205 expressing DCs and DCIR2 ex-
pressing DCs, where only DEC-205+ cells induce Tregs.
(Yamazaki et al., 2008; Kretschmer et al., 2005; Yamazaki
& Steinman, 2009; Liu et al., 2013) Our results also
suggest that targeting of DEC-205+ DCs is able to in-
duce Treg expansion as well as Treg conversion. Pre-
sumably, since both fusion mAbs are able to efficiently
ameliorate disease, either Treg induction has a minor
role in EAE amelioration or another effect of the
αDCIR2 antibody is able to compensate for its lack of
ability to efficiently induce Tregs.
Another interesting observation to emerge from our
study is that amelioration of EAE triggered by αDCIR2
pre-treatment (Fig. 1a) requires immature DC, since
when
MPLA
was
administered
together
with
the
αDCIR2-PLP139–151 (Fig. 1b) there was no protective ef-
fect. These mice developed severe paralysis compared to
controls that were only administered PLP139–151. This
clearly suggests that targeting immature DC is necessary
for programming tolerogenic DC and is consistent with
current thinking about DC biology (Lutz, 2012). Imma-
ture DCs do not express co-stimulatory markers and
antigen presentation by these cells will tolerize T cells
and induce anergy.
Our study contains several technical caveats that need
to be considered when interpreting the results. Chief
among them is differences in efficiency of EAE induction
between different animals. This could be a result of the
variation in the reagents that were used for disease in-
duction, or even the health and prior environmental ex-
posure of different mouse cohorts used. It is important
to note that while there were differences between induc-
tion efficiency between experiments, within each individ-
ual experiment, the protective effect of the fusion mAb
was significant.
Another technical caveat is the slight amelioration of
EAE observed as a result of pre-treatment with isotype
controls. This effect has been documented previously
(Stern et al., 2010). While the mechanism of this action
is unclear, it might be due to cross-reactivity between
the isotype antibodies and immature DC, or phagocyt-
osis and presentation of antigen by macrophages or
other APC. The isotype-only controls are therefore a
more stringent control for EAE amelioration than un-
treated mice. In the present study, the dramatic amelior-
ation of EAE compared to all controls illustrates the
potency of αDCIR2-PLP fusion mAbs.
Additionally, it is worthwhile to note the lack of avail-
able means to identify PLP139–151 specific T cells, neces-
sitating a change of antigen to explore the mechanism of
the fusion mAb. It would be beneficial to evaluate the
PLP139–151 specific T cells in an SJL/J mouse once a
method
of
identifying
PLP139–151
specific
T
cells
becomes available. However, it is reassuring that many
of the results obtained using the HA antigen were con-
sistent with what was previously known about the action
of αDEC-205 antibodies. Therefore, it appears that HA-
specific T cells are likely to be a good alternative model
for exploring the effect of fusion antibodies, if desired
transgenic animals are unavailable.
Conclusion
In summary, our results indicate that using antibodies
other than αDEC-205 to target various subsets of conven-
tional DCs can lead to amelioration of EAE. αDCIR2-PLP
fusion mAbs are able to induce expansion of Tregs while
having less influence over converting them than DEC-205,
yet amelioration of disease is not affected. Thus, induction
of Tregs may not be essential for the protective effects of
αDCIR2 fusion antibodies. In contrast, deletion of patho-
genic T cells seems to play an important role in the mech-
anism of action of αDCIR2 fusion antibodies. Further
analysis of the response of the immune system to different
fusion mAbs can give us insight into the function of DC
and the mechanisms of tolerance induction.
