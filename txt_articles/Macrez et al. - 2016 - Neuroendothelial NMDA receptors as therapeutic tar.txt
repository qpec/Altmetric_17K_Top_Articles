Multiple sclerosis is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults. Here we provide the preclinical
proof of concept of the benefit of a novel strategy of treatment for multiple sclerosis targeting neuroendothelial N-methyl-D-
aspartate glutamate receptors. We designed a monoclonal antibody against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which targets a regu-
latory site of the GluN1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor sensitive to the protease tissue plasminogen activator. This
antibody reverted the effect of tissue plasminogen activator on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function without affecting basal N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity (n = 21, P 5 0.01). This antibody bound N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors on the luminal sur-
face of neurovascular endothelium in human tissues and in mouse, at the vicinity of tight junctions of the blood–spinal cord
barrier. Noteworthy, it reduced human leucocyte transmigration in an in vitro model of the blood–brain barrier (n = 12, P 5 0.05).
When injected during the effector phase of MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (n = 24), it blocked the
progression of neurological impairments, reducing cumulative clinical score (P 5 0.001) and mean peak score (P 5 0.001). This
effect was observed in wild-type animals but not in tissue plasminogen activator knock-out animals (n = 10). This therapeutic effect
was associated to a preservation of the blood–spinal cord barrier (n = 6, P 5 0.001), leading to reduced leucocyte infiltration
(n = 6, P 5 0.001). Overall, this study unveils a critical function of endothelial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in multiple sclerosis,
and highlights the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting the protease-regulated site of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease characterized
by an alteration of the blood–brain and the blood–spinal
cord barriers, and the infiltration of immune cells into the
CNS parenchyma, leading to myelin degradation and
axonal damage.
Studies in animal models of multiple sclerosis have sug-
gested that excitotoxicity, a toxic process resulting from the
excessive activation of glutamatergic receptors, could play a
role in this disease (Pitt et al., 2000; Docagne et al., 2007).
Accordingly, antagonists of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptors (NMDAR), such as memantine, attenu-
ate white matter damages in experimental multiple sclerosis
(Manning et al., 2008). In addition to neurons, where they
drive glutamatergic neurotransmission, NMDAR are ex-
pressed in a variety of cell types (Skerry and Genever,
2001; Boldyrev, 2005; Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff, 2007;
Boldyrev et al., 2013). In particular, brain endothelial cells
express NMDAR, which could be involved in blood–brain
barrier maintenance and alteration (Andra
´s et al., 2007;
Reijerkerk et al., 2010).
Several regulatory sites exist on the GluN1 subunit of
NMDAR. Among them, a protease-regulated site has
been identified (Nicole et al., 2001; Ferna
´ndez-Monreal
et al., 2004; Samson and Medcalf, 2006; Benchenane
et al., 2007), which leads to the potentiation of NMDAR
signalling by the serine-protease tissue plasminogen activa-
tor (tPA). Interestingly, tPA was suggested to participate in
the pathological features of animal models of multiple scler-
osis. For instance, tPA was reported to promote demyelin-
ation by activation of plasminogen into plasmin (Cammer
et al., 1978) and indirect matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
activation (Cuzner and Opdenakker, 1999). In parallel, tPA
was described to promote inflammatory reactions in the
CNS by increasing the permeability of the blood–brain bar-
rier (Lopes Pinheiro et al., 2016) and by facilitating mono-
cyte migration through the rat and human blood–brain
barrier
in
vitro
(Reijerkerk
et
al.,
2008,
2010).
Noteworthy, tPA immunoreactivity in post-mortem tissues
of patients with multiple sclerosis is associated with inflam-
matory cells in the perivascular compartment (Cuzner
et al., 1996) and tPA activity in the circulation correlates
with disease progression (Akenami et al., 1996).
In an earlier study, we showed that the blockade of the
protease-regulated site of NMDAR provides therapeutic
benefits in an animal model of stroke, an effect associated
with reduced blood–brain barrier alteration (Macrez et al.,
2011). Also, previous work showed that NMDAR partici-
pate in leucocyte transmigration (Reijerkerk et al., 2010).
Therefore,
we
hypothesize
that
the
protease-driven
regulation of NMDAR may also play an important role
in the pathology of multiple sclerosis.
In this study, we tested a strategy of immuno-intervention
aimed at blocking the tPA-induced potentiation of endothe-
lial NMDAR function. Interestingly, this strategy led to a
prevention of disease progression in mouse experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We then show that
this therapeutic effect occurs via a direct action on endo-
thelial cells, preventing the alteration of the blood–spinal
cord barrier, resulting in a dramatic reduction of immune
cell entry into the nervous system and a subsequent pres-
ervation of myelin.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57BL6/J mice (Janvier) were housed in our local con-
ventional animal facility (CURB, University of Caen). All pro-
cedures
were
performed
according
to
guidelines
of
the
institutional ethics committee (Comite
´ Normand d’e
´thique en
matie
`re
d’expe
´rimentation

CeNomExA).
Projects
were submitted to this committee for approval in accordance
with
the
European
directive
no
2010/63/UE
(agreement
number D14 118 001).
Experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
Monophasic EAE was induced in 12-week-old male C57BL6/J
mice (Janvier) via subcutaneous immunization with 200 mg re-
combinant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rMOG35-55)
in an emulsion mixed (volume ratio 1:1) with Complete
Freund’s
Adjuvant
(CFA;
Difco
Laboratories)
containing
600 mg of
heat-killed
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
H37Ra
(Difco). Control animals were injected with saline mixed
with CFA containing 600 mg of heat-killed M. tuberculosis.
All animals were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 200 ng
pertussis toxin derived from Bordetella pertussis (Sigma-
Aldrich) in 200 ml saline at the time of, and 24 h after
immunization.
Clinical score
Mice were examined daily for clinical signs of EAE and were
scored as follows: 0, no disease; 1, limp tail; 2, hindlimb weak-
ness; 3, complete hindlimb paralysis; 4, hindlimb paralysis plus
forelimb paralysis; and 5, moribund or dead. Animals were
euthanized if showing a loss of weight of �10%. Clinical
score was assessed daily by one person blinded to the
treatment.

 Transfection, immunocytochemistry
and calcium video imaging in
HEK-293 cells
Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293 cells) were
grown
in the
presence
of
reversible NMDA
antagonists
(200 mM AP5 and 2 mM MgCl2) in a RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum. Cells were trans-
fected by the lipofection method (8 ml, FuGENE-6�), with a
mixture containing 2 mg of pcDNA3-GluN1–1 b and 2 mg of
pcDNA3-GluN2A. For immunostaining experiments, trans-
fected HEK-293 cells were fixed and incubated overnight
(4�C) with the Glunomab (1 mg/ml) in PBS with 4% bovine
serum albumin (BSA). Finally, cells were incubated with a sec-
ondary anti-mouse FITC antibody (1:800) for 1 h at room
temperature. Images were taken on a confocal microscope
(Leica SP5). For calcium video imaging, cells were loaded in
the presence of a HEPES-buffered saline solution containing
10 mM fura-2/AM plus 0.1% pluronic F-127 and 20% solu-
tion in dimethyl sulphoxide (30 min, 37�C) and incubated for
an additional 45-min period in a HEPES-buffered saline solu-
tion. Experiments were performed on the stage of a Leica
DMI6000B inverted microscope equipped of a Leica 40� ob-
jective. Fura-2 ratio images were digitized using Metafluor�
6.1 software (Universal Imaging Corporation).
Epitope mapping
A total of 141 overlapping pentadecapeptides, frame-shifted by
three residues covering the entire amino acid sequence of
GluN1 N-terminal domain (residues 19–371). Briefly, peptides
were assembled using Fmoc chemistry on a cellulose mem-
brane containing an aminopolyethyleneglycol moiety. The C-
terminal residue of each peptide was coupled to the moiety.
After Fmoc deprotection, the other amino acids were sequen-
tially added. Finally the side-chain protecting groups were
removed by trifluoroacetic acid treatment in the presence of
appropriate scavengers, while the linkage of the peptides to the
membrane was maintained. Free cysteines were replaced with
non-reactive acetamidomethyl cysteines. Purified monoclonal
antibodies were incubated on the membrane, and revealed by
a classical western blotting method.
Monocyte and T cell migration
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy
coats obtained from healthy donors (Sanquin Blood Bank,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using Ficoll density gradient
(LymphoprepTM, Axis-Shield). For isolation of monocytes
and T cells, we used anti-CD14 magnetic beads (Miltenyi
Biotec) with a MACS� MultiStand and LS Column by passing
3 ml of MACS buffer [2 mM EDTA and 0.1% foetal calf
serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] according to the
manufacturers’ protocol. Human T cell purity was 496% as
assessed by expression of CD3 using flow cytometry per-
formed (FACSCalibur
TM) using CELLQuestTM software (BD
Biosciences). Isolated T cells were cultured for 48 h before ex-
periments. Effector T cells were generated by adding IL-2
(10 ng/ml) and phytohaemagglutinin (1 mg/ml) during 48 h
(Kooij et al., 2014). The immortalized human brain endothe-
lial cell line hCMEC/D3, which establishes the key features of
brain
endothelium,
was
cultured
as
described
previously
(Weksler et al., 2005). Migration of primary human mono-
cytes and T cells across confluent monolayers of hCMEC/D3
cells
was
studied
with
time-lapse
video
microscopy
as
described previously (Mizee et al., 2014). Freshly isolated
human monocytes or lymphocytes were added (7.5 � 105
cells/ml) to hCMEC/D3 cells, and the number of migrated
cells was assessed after 4 h.
Passive immunization
Injection in the tail vein with the anti-NMDAR monoclonal
antibody (15A4B2E5: Glunomab) or control anti-NMDAR
monoclonal antibody (6C9B6G11: control isotype) (160 mg in
200 ml each) was performed at the time indicated (Fig. 1A)
after EAE onset (MOG). Animals were randomly assigned to
the experimental groups. Mortality was null for all procedures/
treatments.
Tissue sampling, histology and
immunohistochemistry
Three animals from each group were perfused transcardially
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4, and their brain and spinal cords were dissected out
and post-fixed in the same fixative for 4 h at room tempera-
ture. In addition, human post-mortem tissue of non-neuro-
logical control cases (n = 3) was obtained by rapid autopsy
and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (The Netherlands
Brain
Bank,
Amsterdam,
coordinator
Dr
Huitinga).
The
Netherlands Brain Bank received permission to perform autop-
sies for the use of tissue and for access to medical records for
research purposes from the Ethical Committee of the VU
University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. All
patients and controls, or their next of kin, had given informed
consent for autopsy and use of their brain tissue for research
purposes.
In the case of NMDAR immunohistochemistry, the animal
underwent perfusion with saline-heparin only (without PFA
fixation). After immersion in increasing concentrations of su-
crose [until 30% (w/v)], tissue was cut in coronal cryostat
sections (20 -mm thick: Leica, Nussloch) and thaw-mounted
on Superfrost� Plus slide. After several rinses with phosphate
buffer, the sections used for all immunohistochemistry experi-
ments except for NMDAR, were pre-treated for 20 min with
phosphate buffer containing 3% H2O2, 10% methanol (or
methanol alone for immunofluorescence experiments) and
they were then preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in
incubation buffer: 5% appropriate normal serum (Vector) and
0.2% Triton
TM X-100 (Merck) diluted in PBS. In the case of
NMDAR immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were post-
fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, blocked with 0.2% BSA in
Coon’s
buffer,
and
washed
in
Coon’s
buffer.
Immunohistochemistry was performed by incubating sections
overnight at 4�C with the following primary antibodies
(diluted in incubation buffer): Glunomab (1:500), polyclonal
goat anti-collagen IV antibody (1:1000), monoclonal rat anti-
podocalyxin (R&D Systems #192703, 1:250. Kindly provided

were digested with collagenase IV (54 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich)
for 45 min at 37�C, resuspended in 30% Percoll�, and
loaded onto 30/70% Percoll� gradient. After centrifuge at
1300g for 30 min, myelin was removed from the top of the
gradient and the CNS inflammatory cells were collected in
PBS. Cells (105) were resuspended in 50 ml of staining buffer
(sterile PBS supplemented with 1% BSA, 1% foetal bovine
serum) and the Fc receptors were blocked for 10 min at 4�C
with anti-CD16/CD32 antibodies (BD Biosciences 553142,
10 mg/ml). After blocking, the cells were labelled with various
fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-mouse
CD11b PerCP Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences 550993), anti-mouse
F4/80-eFluor 450 (eBiosciences 48-4801-82) and anti-mouse
CD3" APC (BD Biosciences 553066). CNS inflammatory
cells were washed twice with staining buffer, they were re-
covered by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min at room tem-
perature, resuspended in PBS and finally, the samples were

 Statistical analyses
Results are presented as mean � standard error of the mean
(SEM). For calcium video imaging of HEK-293 cells, the re-
sponsiveness was analysed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test to
compare pre-and post-incubation response. In addition, for
group comparison, Kruskal-Wallis tests were used followed
by Mann-Whitney U-tests as post hoc tests. Other statistical
analyses were performed by the Kruskall-Wallis’ test, followed
by post hoc comparison with the Mann-Whitney’s test.
Results
Design of a blocking monoclonal
antibody directed against the
protease-regulated site of NMDAR
The main goal of this study was to elaborate a strategy of
immune-intervention directed against the site of interaction
of tPA with NMDAR. To this end, we developed a mono-
clonal antibody directed against the precise site of inter-
action of tPA with NMDAR, which could prevent the
effects of tPA on NMDAR function. We first screened a
series of monoclonal antibodies generated using the recom-
binant N-terminal domain (residues 19–371) of GluN1
NTD
as
antigen.
Positive
antibodies
on
ELISA
for
GluN1-NTD (data not shown) were then selected for
their ability to block the potentiating effects of tPA on
NMDAR function as assessed by calcium imaging in
HEK-293 cells engineered to express NMDAR (Fig. 1).
One clone (15A4B2E5: Glunomab) was chosen on this
functional basis (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1A). In
transfected
HEK-293
cells,
tPA
(300 nM)
increased
NMDA-induced Ca2 + influx by �40%. Noteworthy, the
co-application of Glunomab prevented this effect of tPA
(Fig. 1A; P 5 0.01), while Glunomab did not influence
NMDA-evoked signalling in the absence of tPA (Fig. 1A).
As expected, Glunomab stained HEK-293 cells transfected
with GluN1, but not untransfected cells (Fig. 1B). Another
clone, 6C9B6G11 (control isotype, Supplementary Fig. 1A
and B), failed to block tPA-mediated potentiation of
NMDAR function (Fig. 1A) and was used as a control
isotype throughout the rest of the study. Epitope mapping
showed that Glunomab epitope was localized between
amino acids 169 and 192 of GluN1 sequence (Fig. 1C).
This portion of GluN1 sequence is fully conserved between
mouse, rat and human (data not shown).
Glunomab prevents leucocyte trans-
migration through the blood–brain
barrier in vitro
We used a human in vitro model of the blood–brain barrier
(hCMEC/D3 cells; Weksler et al., 2005) to test the ability
of Glunomab to block leucocyte transmigration. First, we
confirmed that Glunomab antibody was able to stain
NMDAR on endothelial cells in this model (Fig. 2A). We
next showed that, under inflammatory condition (TNF
treatment), Glunomab significantly blocked human mono-
cyte migration ( + 50% of migrated monocytes for TNF
alone compared to basal condition and �63% of migrated
monocytes for the condition TNF + Glunomab compared
to TNF alone; n = 12, P 5 0.05; Fig. 2B). tPA treatment
increased the transendothelial migration of human mono-
cytes in non–inflammatory condition and in the presence of
TNF ( + 38% compared to control and 16% compared to
TNF condition, respectively; n = 12, P 5 0.05; Fig. 2C).
Importantly, Glunomab antibody was also able to block
the increase in human monocyte migration induced by
tPA
treatment
( + 38%
of
migrated
monocytes
for
TNF + tPA compared to TNF alone, �53% of migrated
monocytes
for
TNF + tPA + Glunomab
compared
to
TNF + tPA
and
�38%
of
migrated
monocytes
for
TNF + tPA + Glunomab compared to TNF + tPA + con-
trol isoptype; n = 12, P 5 0.05 Fig. 2D). This effect was
not limited to monocyte migration, as it also significantly
blocked human T cell migration using similar conditions
( + 70% of migrated T cells for TNF as compared to
basal
condition
and
�58%
of
migrated
T
cells
for
TNF + tPA + Glunomab
as
compared
to
TNF + tPA;
n = 12, P 5 0.05; Fig. 2E). Control isotype displayed lim-
ited, non-significant effects in these experiments (Fig. 2B, D
and E).
Glunomab binds to NMDAR in the
vicinity of neuroendothelial tight
junctions of the blood–spinal and
blood–brain barrier
Based on these in vitro data, our next step was to test if
Glunomab was able to bind and stain NMDAR on spinal
cord endothelium. We observed a positive immunostaining
with Glunomab on mouse spinal cord microvessels of con-
trol animals (Fig. 3A). A similar pattern of staining was
observed when using an antibody directed against the C-
terminal end of GluN1 (Fig. 3A). Glunomab also revealed
endothelial
NMDAR
in
human
tissues
(Fig.
3B).
Interestingly, Glunomab revealed NMDAR co-localized
with the tight junction proteins claudin 5, occludin 1 and
zona occludens 1 on mouse spinal cord endothelium (Fig.
3C and Supplementary Fig. 2A). Similar pattern of expres-
sion and co-localization was observed on mouse brain
microvessels (Supplementary Fig. 2B). In contrast, no stain-
ing was observed with Glunomab in brain microvessels
devoid of tight junctions, such as fenestrated capillaries of
the external zone of the median eminence (Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Fig. 3). These data show that NMDAR
are expressed on tight junction-containing, blood–brain/
blood–spinal cord barrier-forming endothelial cells. Using

Glunomab stops symptom progres-
sion in EAE by preventing blood–
spinal cord barrier leakage and
immune cell infiltration
The above data show that Glunomab is able to block
immune
cell
migration
across
neurendothelial
cells
in vitro and that this antibody binds NMDAR expressed
on the neuroendothelium in vivo. We thus hypothesized
that Glunomab could provide therapeutic effects in experi-
mental multiple sclerosis. Based on this, we then tested the
effects of Glunomab in MOG-induced EAE. Our first ap-
proach was to perform three intravenous injections of
Glunomab (160 mg per mouse) at the onset, the effector
phase and the chronic phase of EAE. This treatment led
to a general reduction of clinical score throughout the dis-
ease (P 5 0.001 from Day 6 post-onset to the end of treat-
ment, Fig. 5A), illustrated by a reduced cumulative clinical
score (36.7 � 5.5 versus 72.4 � 14; n = 24 mice per group,
P 5 0.001; Fig. 5B) and a reduced mean peak score
(1.9 � 0.37 for Glunomab treated mice versus 3.4 � 0.44
for the isotype control; n = 24 mice per group, P 5 0.001;
Fig. 5C). We then tested the therapeutic efficacy of a single
injection of Glunomab performed during the effector phase
of the disease. This single injection was enough to provide
a conspicuous therapeutic effect characterized by a com-
plete blockade of disease progression (Fig. 5D, P 5 0.001
from Day 9 post-onset to the end of treatment), illustrated
by a reduced cumulative clinical score (63.4 � 2.2 versus
41.3 � 3.3, n = 24 per group, P 5 0.001; Fig. 5E) and a
reduced mean peak score (2.2 � 0.56 for Glunomab treated
mice versus 3.9 � 0.18 for the isotype control; n = 24 mice
per group, P 5 0.001; Fig. 5F). Noteworthy, in tPA knock-
out animals, Glunomab did not induce any modification of
clinical score throughout the disease (Supplementary Fig.
4A), cumulative clinical score (Supplementary Fig. 4B) or
mean peak score (Supplementary Fig. 4C).
Histological analysis showed that mice treated with
Glunomab displayed a dramatically reduced demyelination
within inflammatory lesions (14.69% � 2.05% for EAE
mice treated with the control isotype antibody versus
0.3% � 0.1%
for
EAE
mice
treated
with
Glunomab;
n = 6, P 5 0.001; Fig. 5G–I).
One week after the injection of the isotype antibody
during the effector phase of EAE, we observed a classical
pattern of endothelium activation characterized by the ex-
pression of tomato lectin and VCAM-1 on microvessels of
the spinal cord (Fig. 6A and B), together with an increase in

 Glunomab acts on the neurovasculature in EAE by restor-
ing blood–spinal cord barrier function.
We next asked whether this action on blood–spinal cord
barrier functions could lead to modifications of immune
cell entry towards the parenchyma in EAE mice. Flow cyto-
metry analysis showed a reduction in both myeloid and
lymphoid populations in the spinal cord of MOG-induced
EAE mice when treated with a single injection of the
Glunomab (Fig. 7A and B). These data were confirmed
by histological analysis of the demyelinated area of the
spinal cord, with drastic reductions in the number of
CD11b + (macrophages/microglia), Ly6B.2 + (neutrophils),
MHC-II +
(antigen-presenting
cells),
CD11c +
(dendritic
cells) and CD4 + (T4 lymphocytes) cells (Fig. 7C and D)
in EAE mice treated with the Glunomab [�86%, �100%
(non-detected), �79%, �90% and �100% (v), respectively
compared to control isotype treatment; n = 6 mice per
group, P 5 0.001; Fig. 7D]. Flow cytometry analysis from
spleens showed that Glunomab treatment did not influence
lymphocyte activation (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Discussion
The present study reports the therapeutic effects of a strat-
egy
of
immunointervention
targeting
neuroendothelial
NMDAR in experimental multiple sclerosis. Blocking the
action of the serine protease tPA on NMDAR by using a
novel
monoclonal
antibody
(Glunomab)
results
in
a
reduced severity of the disease with a drastic reduction of
inflammation and demyelination. Glunomab targets endo-
thelial cells and leads to a reduced transmigration of
immune cell through the blood–spinal cord barrier, which
sustains its therapeutic effects. Glunomab is effective when

 injected during the effector phase of EAE, in symptomatic
animals (clinical score 2). Noteworthy, this timing of treat-
ment corresponds to a stage of ongoing blood–brain barrier
and blood–spinal cord barrier alterations (Floris et al.,
2004), which is compatible with the proposed mechanism
of action on blood–brain/blood–spinal cord barriers. In
addition to this, Glunomab binds the luminal surface of
the neurovascular endothelium, in the vicinity of tight junc-
tion proteins. This sustains the proposed mode of action,
which resides in a blockade of blood–brain/blood–spinal
cord barrier alterations and subsequent entry of immune
cells into the parenchyma.
We describe that NMDARs are localized at the luminal
surface of neurovascular endothelium, in relation to tight
junction proteins zona occludens 1, claudin 5 and occludin.
This complements the previous observation of NMDAR in
cultured human brain endothelial cells, as well as in vivo,
in the mouse brain vasculature (Reijerkerk et al., 2010).
The fact that NMDAR are displayed by endothelial cells
raises the question of their function. Our study highlights
their role in the regulation of the blood–spinal cord barrier
during
neuroinflammatory
conditions.
Previous
reports
showed that EAE symptoms were reduced by the voltage-
dependent
NMDAR
antagonist
memantine
(Paul
and
Bolton, 2002; Sulkowski et al., 2013), together with a
reduced blood–brain barrier permeability. However, the ul-
timate
mechanisms
involved
are
not
fully
understood.
NMDAR activation could lead to blood–brain or blood–
spinal cord barrier permeability by alteration of occludin
expression and distribution (Andra
´s et al., 2007) or mito-
chondrial toxicity (Kamat et al., 2015). Production of react-
ive oxygen species (Sharp et al., 2003; Scott et al., 2007) and
polyamines (Bolton and Paul, 2006), rise in intracellular cal-
cium (Sharp et al., 2003) or activation of intracellular kin-
ases (Basuroy et al., 2006) have all been proposed as
potential mediators of this effect. All of these processes are
known mediators of excitotoxicity in neurons, which sug-
gests that endothelial NMDAR-induced blood–brain or
blood–spinal cord barrier permeability could share features
with neuronal NMDAR-induced excitotoxic death. Beyond
these toxic effects due to excessive stimulation of NMDAR,
a physiological pathway mediated by NMDAR must exist in
endothelial cells. The role of this physiological pathway and
its precise description should be addressed in further studies.

increased upon TNF treatment in vitro in hCMEC/D3

 cells suggests that NMDAR expression by brain endothe-
lium is upregulated in inflammatory conditions. If this is
confirmed by further in vivo studies, this would suggest
that NMDAR expression on endothelial cells could be
part of the endothelium activation that occurs during in-
flammation, together with the expression of cell adhesion
molecules. On a functional point of view, this would mean
that NMDAR effects on leucocyte transmigration would be
silenced
in
non-inflammatory
conditions
and
unveiled
during inflammation. In addition, endothelial NMDAR ex-
pression could also be a marker of endothelial activation
during inflammation and could be targeted by diagnostic
tools such as molecular MRI for instance.
Another important issue is the origin of the endogenous
ligands
which
activate
endothelial
NMDAR.
Platelets
(Tremolizzo et al., 2006), monocytes (Lee et al., 2011)
and lymphocytes (Garg et al., 2008) release glutamate. Of
note, glutamate plasma levels are elevated in patients with
multiple
sclerosis,
as
compared
to
control
patients
(Pampliega et al., 2008). These data suggest that leuco-
cyte-derived glutamate could be responsible for NMDAR
activation in multiple sclerosis.
Our data suggest that endogenous tPA is involved in the
neuroinflammatory processes during EAE. This comes in
complement to recent observations of a deleterious, pro-
inflammatory effect of exogenously administered tPA in
the same model (Wang et al., 2014). Previous studies
using tPA knockout mice had described a dual role for
endogenous tPA in EAE: tPA was suggested to participate
in leucocyte infiltration during the onset and effector phase

 of EAE (delayed lymphocyte infiltration in tPA knock-out
animals) (Cuzner et al., 1996), and to protect axons via
parenchymal fibrinolysis during the recovery phase of
EAE (fibrin accumulation on damaged axons in tPA
knock-out animals) (Akenami et al., 1996). These studies
in knock-out animals did not allow discrimination between
the multiple effects of tPA, in particular between NMDAR-
dependent and NMDAR-independent effects, which can ex-
plain the dual effects observed. The strategy used in the
present study allows selective blockade of NMDAR- de-
pendent effects of tPA at specific time points of EAE. By
using this strategy, we show here that tPA, by acting on
NMDAR during the effector phase of EAE, promotes
leucocyte infiltration through the blood–spinal cord barrier.
tPA effects on blood–brain barrier function, though never
addressed before in multiple sclerosis models, have been
previously studied in the context of stroke. In endothelial
cells, tPA induces LRP signalling through NF-�B to induce
the synthesis of metalloproteinases MMP9 and MMP3,
which in turn contribute to blood–brain barrier breakdown
and intracranial bleeding (Wang et al., 2003; Suzuki et al.,
2009). In parallel, tPA, through LRP shedding (Polavarapu
et al., 2007) on perivascular astrocytes, induces the expres-
sion of MMP9 (Wang et al., 2006), and promotes the de-
tachment of astrocyte end-feet processes (Polavarapu et al.,
2007). Our present results suggest that the mechanisms of
action of tPA in EAE differ from what previously described
in experimental stroke: in EAE, particularly during the ef-
fector phase, tPA would act on endothelial NMDAR to
sustain leucocyte infiltration, as it was previously suggested
in a cell culture model of blood–brain barrier (Reijerkerk
et al., 2010). This difference in the mechanism is consistent
with the idea that blood–brain barrier breakdown in stroke
and its animal models is different from blood–brain barrier/
blood–spinal cord barrier alteration in multiple sclerosis
and its animal models, in terms of cause, characteristics,
timing,
intensity
and
consequences
(Obermeier
et
al.,
2013). Our study shows the relevance of this newly-
described mechanism in an appropriate animal model.
Two recent studies allow hypothesizing on the pathway
which links tPA, NMDAR and leucocyte transmigration:
Wang et al. (2014) reported that tPA upregulates ICAM-
1 expression in brain endothelial cells through an action
dependent on the LRP1 receptor (a tPA receptor); and
Mantuano et al. (2013) showed that LRP1 associates
with NMDAR to trigger cell signalling in Schwann cells.
This suggests that in endothelial cells, tPA, through a sig-
nalling pathway dependent on the association of LRP1 and
NMDAR, could increase the expression of cell adhesion
molecules, which would facilitate leucocyte transmigration.
The main described source of tPA is endothelial cells,
which suggests that tPA could act in an autocrine fashion
on endothelial NMDAR. Another exciting hypothesis is
that immune cells could produce tPA during the processes
of adhesion/transmigration, which would act as a signal for
endothelial cells via endothelial NMDAR. In fact, neutro-
phils and macrophages have been shown to produce tPA,
which in turn can promote their recruitment to the sites of
inflammation (Lin et al., 2014; Uhl et al., 2014). In accord-
ance with this, neutrophils have been shown to mediate
blood–spinal cord barrier opening in EAE (Aube
´ et al.,
2014). The drastic reduction of immune cell infiltration to
the spinal cord of the animals treated with Glunomab,
observed
in
the
present
study,
is
in
favour
of
this
hypothesis.
Anti-NMDAR antibodies are present in subpopulations
of patients with CNS diseases, the prototype of which being
anti-NMDAR encephalitis (Dalmau et al., 2008), and are
known to be pathogenic in most cases. Nevertheless,
Glunomab targets a different region of NMDAR than the
epitope targeted in anti-NMDAR encephalitis (N368/G369)
(Gleichman et al., 2012). On a functional point of view,
antibodies from anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients reduce
basal NMDAR function (Mikasova et al., 2012), while
Glunomab does not, but rather reduces the potentiation
of this response by tPA (Fig. 1A). This absence of effect
on basal NMDAR function is likely to impede toxic effects
of
our
antibody
on
physiological
glutamatergic
transmission.
The development of this site-specific antibody against the
tPA/NMDAR binding site provides hopes for efficient
translation to the clinical situation. NMDAR function is
crucial
for
various
physiological
processes,
such
as
normal synaptic transmission. For that reason, unaccept-
able side effects have been reported from clinical trials
using compounds that fully block NMDAR. Thus, com-
pounds targeting modulatory sites on the NMDAR without
affecting basal NMDAR transmission are expected to pro-
mote therapeutic effects without the unacceptable side ef-
fects. The monoclonal antibody developed in this study
fulfils this criterion, as it can block the potentiating effects
of tPA on NMDAR, rather than fully inhibit NMDAR-
mediated processes. This makes of our novel antibody-
based strategy a promising new therapeutic tool for dis-
eases in which tPA/NMDA interactions are causal of
tissue damage, including multiple sclerosis.
