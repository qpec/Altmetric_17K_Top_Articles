Despite the high prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), therapeutic options and noninvasive
markers of disease activity and severity remain limited. We investigated the association between plasma biomarkers
and liver histology in order to identify markers of disease activity and severity in patients with biopsy-proven
NAFLD. Thirty-two plasma biomarkers chosen a priori as possible discriminators of NAFLD were measured in
participants enrolled in the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network. Dichotomized histo-
logic outcomes were evaluated using centrally read biopsies. Biomarkers with statistically significant associations
with NAFLD histology were evaluated in multivariable models adjusted for clinical factors. Of 648 participants
(74.4% white, 61.7% female, mean age 47.7 years), 58.0% had definite NASH, 55.5% had mild/no fibrosis (stage 0-
1), and 44.4% had significant fibrosis (stage 2-4). Increased activated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 had a strong
association with definite NASH compared to not NASH or borderline NASH in multivariable analysis (odds ratio
5 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.34, P < 0.001). Biomarkers associated with significant fibrosis (versus mild/
no fibrosis) in multivariable analysis included higher levels of interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
resistin, soluble interleukin-1 receptor I, soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and
lower levels of insulin-like growth factor 2. Conclusions: Specific plasma biomarkers are significantly associated with
disease activity and severity of fibrosis in NAFLD and are potentially valuable tools for noninvasive stratification of
patients with NAFLD and identification of targets for therapeutic intervention. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;65:65-77).

A
pproximately one-third of the US adult popula-
tion is estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD).(1) NAFLD is characterized
by a spectrum of histologically defined stages from steato-
sis to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma.(2) However, only a subset of
patients progress through each stage. An improved under-
standing of risk factors associated with disease severity
could help in risk stratification of patients with NAFLD.
The diagnosis and staging of NAFLD rely on histo-
logic evaluation of a liver biopsy, an invasive test that is
associated
with
some
risk
of
complications
and
inconvenient as a repeat measure of disease severity.

 Moreover, a liver biopsy is susceptible to significant
sampling variability.(3) A growing appreciation of the
relationship of mediators of inflammation with the his-
tologic features of NAFLD coupled with the ability to
detect many mediators of inflammation in the periph-
eral blood has resulted in a growing interest in novel
biomarkers that could improve the utility of or even
replace liver biopsy.(4)
Plasma levels of several candidate biomarkers that
correlate with steatosis, steatohepatitis, or fibrosis have
been identified in small clinical studies of patients with
NAFLD. Interleukin (IL)-6 levels were higher in
patients with NAFLD than controls; however, the
authors did not discriminate between those with stea-
tosis and those with steatohepatitis.(5) IL-8 levels were
higher in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) than steatosis; however, other studies showed
no difference.(6,7) Elevated monocyte chemoattractant
protein 1 (MCP-1) levels and increased MCP1 gene
expression
were
associated
with
NAFLD
and
NASH.(5,8) Reduced adiponectin levels were indepen-
dently associated with NASH, and increasing tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) levels correlated with
insulin resistance, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis.(9,10)
Multiple other biomarkers (resistin, leptin, retinol
binding protein-4, hyaluronic acid, procollagen type 3
N-terminal peptide, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotei-
nases 1, transforming growth factor beta 1) have also
been associated with NAFLD severity and fibrosis, but
all of these studies were limited by a small to modest
sample size or examination of only a limited number of
biomarkers.(11-14)
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a broad set of
candidate biomarkers of inflammation, fibrosis, angiogen-
esis, and insulin and glucose metabolism in a large, well-
characterized cohort of adults with NAFLD to determine
their association with the histologic features of NAFLD.
Participants and Methods
STUDY DESIGN AND
PARTICIPANTS
This was a cross-sectional study of adult participants
recruited into the NASH Clinical Research Network
(NASH CRN), a multicenter network sponsored by
the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases. Participants were drawn from two
groups, at baseline, within the NASH CRN: (1) the
NAFLD Database study, a prospective observational
cohort which enrolled participants beginning in 2004,
and (2) the Pioglitazone or Vitamin E for Nonalcohol-
ic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial. Both studies have
institutional review board approval at each of the eight
clinical centers participating in the NASH CRN (Sup-
porting Information). Informed consent was obtained
at entry into the study.
The NAFLD Database is a prospective observational
study of participants at least 18 years of age with either a
histologic diagnosis of NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis,
suspected NAFLD based on imaging studies, or clinical
evidence of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Exclusion criteria
included clinical evidence of alcoholic liver disease or
alcohol consumption during the 2 years before entry of
more than 20 g daily for men and 10 g daily for women
and evidence of other forms of chronic liver disease,
including suspected or confirmed hepatocellular carcino-
ma and known human immunodeficiency virus positivity.
Additional details of the study have been published.(15)
The PIVENS trial was conducted from 2005 to 2008
and included nondiabetic adults without cirrhosis but
with definite or possible steatohepatitis. The details of
the study protocol and the main results of the trial have
been published.(16,17) This study included all adult partic-
ipants at the time of study selection on April 1, 2010,

 with available plasma samples drawn within 6 months of
a centrally read liver biopsy at the baseline visit. Of the
1,048 adult participants of the Database study, 1,020 had
sufficient plasma available for this study; of these, 850
participants had a centrally reviewed enrollment liver
biopsy, 414 of these being within 6 months of the plasma
blood draw. The final number of participants with assay
data on at least one analyte was 411. Of the 247 adults
enrolled in the PIVENS trial, 237 had available baseline
serum and were included in this study, bringing the total
study population to 648.
CLINICAL AND LABORATORY
ASSESSMENT
Demographic data and self-reported doctor-diag-
nosed comorbidities were obtained by structured inter-
view. Height, weight, waist, and hip measurements
were taken in duplicate while standing and wearing
light clothing and averaged for analyses. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kilograms)
divided by height (meters) squared.
Fasting whole blood samples were obtained by veni-
puncture after an overnight fast of 8 hours or more and
processed for plasma and serum within 2 hours. Labo-
ratory assays were performed at individual clinical cen-
ters and included white blood cell count (103 cells per
microliter), hematocrit (percentage), platelet count
(103 cells per microliter), total bilirubin (milligrams per
deciliter), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, units per
liter), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, units per liter),
alkaline
phosphatase
(units
per
liter),
gamma-
glutamyltransferase (units per liter), albumin (grams
per deciliter), fasting lipids including triglycerides and
cholesterol fractions (milligrams per deciliter), fasting
glucose (milligrams per deciliter), and fasting insulin
(milliunits per milliliter). Homeostasis model assess-
ment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated
using the equation (fasting glucose [millimoles per
liter] 3 fasting insulin [milliunits per liter])/22.5.
HISTOLOGIC EVALUATION
Biopsy specimens were evaluated centrally by the
NASH CRN Pathology Committee for the following
histologic features, according to the validated histolog-
ic scoring system (NAFLD Activity Score) by Kleiner
et al.(18): steatosis (grade 0 [<5% macrovesicular fat],
grade 1 [5%-33%], grade 2 [34%-66%], and grade 3
[>66%]), portal inflammation (grade 0 [none], grade 1
[mild], and grade 2 [>mild]), lobular inflammation
(grade 0 [none per 320 field], grade 1 [<2 foci per
320 field], grade 2 [2-4 foci per 320 field], and grade
3 [>4 foci per 320 field]), ballooning degeneration
(grade 0 [none], grade 1 [few], and grade 2 [many]),
and fibrosis (stage 0, stage 1a [mild perisinusoidal],
stage 1b [moderate perisinusoidal], stage 1c [portal/
periportal fibrosis only], stage 2 [zone 3 and peripor-
tal], stage 3 [bridging fibrosis], and stage 4 [cirrhosis]).
For analysis, steatosis was dichotomized into grade 1
compared to grade 2 or 3. Lobular inflammation was
dichotomized as grades 0-1 versus grades 2-3. Bal-
looning degeneration was dichotomized as grade 0 ver-
sus grades 1-2. Significant fibrosis was defined as
stages 2-4 and compared to mild or no fibrosis (stages
0-1). Diagnosis of NASH was classified as definite
NASH, NAFLD not NASH, or suspicious for
NASH (“borderline” NASH) based upon central
pathology reading, as defined.(18) These categories
were assigned prior to conducting statistical analyses.
PLASMA BIOMARKER
MULTIPLEX ASSAY
Thirty-two plasma biomarkers were chosen a priori
as possible predictors of NASH and its histologic com-
ponents (i.e., steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis). Plasma
samples were stored at -808C until testing. Plasma
samples were measured in duplicate using the Luminex
Multiplex platform (Millipore, St. Louis, MO) and
processed according to standard protocol. Cytokine
detection by Luminex is comparable to that with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,(19,20) but the
required input plasma volume is drastically reduced.
Quality control procedures were employed to ensure
high-quality data for downstream analyses. The coeffi-
cient of variation for plasma biomarkers was required
to be <20%, a criterion met for all 32 biomarkers
(Supporting Information). Four biomarkers that were
unable to be measured in at least 90% of the samples
were excluded (glucagon-like peptide 1, soluble vascu-
lar endothelial growth factor receptor 1, IL1a, trans-
forming growth factor beta 3).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
This
exploratory
analysis
evaluated
associations
between plasma biomarkers, clinical factors, and spe-
cific histologic outcomes: NASH diagnosis (primary
outcome of interest), steatosis grade, lobular inflamma-
tion, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis stage. Histo-
logic outcomes with more than two categories were

 collapsed into binary outcomes based on clinical signif-
icance. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribu-
tions were generated on the sample demographic and
clinical characteristics as well as plasma biomarker
measurements (Table 1). Logistic regression was used
for univariable analysis of the association between bio-
markers and histologic outcomes, with the biomarkers
scaled per 0.5 standard deviation change based on
standard deviations for the total group as reported in
Table 2. To account for multiple comparisons, the
Benjamini-Hochberg
false
discovery
rate
(FDR)
adjusted threshold for statistical significance was calcu-
lated for the association between plasma biomarkers
and histologic outcomes. Multiple imputation was per-
formed with progressive mean matching and iterative-
chained equations with the mean of 20 imputed values
retained and used for multivariable models. Univariable
linear regression of clinical factors chosen a priori for
their known association with NASH diagnosis and
severity (age, sex, BMI, AST, ALT, triglycerides,
high-density lipoprotein, and HOMA-IR) on statisti-
cally significant biomarkers was used for analysis of the
association between biomarkers and clinical factors.
Pearson’s correlation was used to evaluate the correla-
tion among statistically significant biomarkers. Finally,
biomarkers meeting the threshold for statistical signifi-
cance in univariable analysis (P < 0.05) were evaluated
in a multivariable model with the aforementioned clin-
ical factors. In this analysis, the biomarkers meeting
the threshold for statistical significance but not meet-
ing the FDR adjusted threshold on univariable analysis
were highlighted (with an asterisk). All statistical anal-
yses were performed using STATA (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX).
Results
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
STUDY POPULATION
Six hundred and forty-eight patients with NAFLD
from the NASH CRN were included in the analysis.
Participants had a mean age of 47.7 years and were
predominantly female (61.7%), white (74.4%), and
obese (mean BMI 5 34.6 kg/m2). Diabetes (22.1%),
hypertension (46.1%), and hyperlipidemia (55.7%)
were common comorbidities. Of the 648 adult partici-
pants, 376 were classified as definite NASH (58.0%),
143 as not NASH (22.1%), and 129 as “borderline”
NASH (19.9%).
BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF
DEFINITE NASH
In univariable logistic regression analysis, partici-
pants with definite NASH had significantly higher lev-
els of total plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (tPAI1),
activated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (aPAI1),
IL-8, and soluble IL-1 receptor 1 (sIL-1R1) than
those with no or borderline NASH (Tables 2 and 3).

 only increased aPAI1 was independently associated
with definite NASH (odds ratio [OR] 5 1.20, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.34, P 5 0.001) (Table
4). aPAI1 was associated with BMI, HOMA-IR,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides
(Table 5); and levels strongly correlated with tPAI1, q
5 0.65 (Supporting Table S3). In sensitivity analysis
excluding patients with borderline NASH from the
comparison group, only aPAI1 remained associated
with definite NASH after multivariable adjustment
(Supporting Table S4).
BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED
WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE
STEATOSIS, HEPATOCYTE

INFLAMMATION
Twenty-five percent of participants had >66% stea-
tosis (grade 3), 34% had 34%-66% (grade 2), 37% had
5%-33% (grade 1), and 5% had <5% steatosis (grade
0). Participants with moderate to severe steatosis
(>33%) had lower levels of adiponectin and sIL-2Ra
as well as elevated tPAI1, aPAI1, and insulin-like
growth factor 2 (IGFII) (Table 3; Supporting Table
S1) compared to those with no or mild steatosis
(�33%) in univariable logistic regression. sIL-2Ra did
not meet the FDR adjusted threshold for statistical
significance. In a multivariable analysis of biomarkers
associated with steatosis >33% compared to steatosis
�33%, decreased adiponectin (OR 5 0.91, 95% CI
0.83-0.99, P 5 0.029) and increased aPAI1 (OR 5
1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32, P < 0.001), tPAI1 (OR 5
1.31, 95% CI 1.18-1.45, P < 0.001) and IGFII (OR
5 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28, P 5 0.005) were associated
with higher grades of steatosis (Table 4). Adiponectin
was associated with female sex and increased age and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inversely asso-
ciated with ALT, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides (Table
5). IGFII was associated with male sex and increased
ALT and triglycerides and inversely associated with
age and BMI. tPAI1 was associated with increased
age, BMI, AST, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides. IGFII
was inversely correlated with IL-8 and sIL-2Ra q 5
-0.20 and q 5 -0.22, respectively (Supporting Table
S3). Adiponectin was not strongly correlated with any

 other biomarker, and tPAI1 only correlated strongly
with aPAI1.
Thirty-two percent of participants had no evidence
of hepatocyte ballooning (grade 0), 28% had a few
ballooned hepatocytes (grade 1), and 39% displayed
many ballooned hepatocytes (grade 2). In univariable
logistic regression, participants with hepatocellular
ballooning
had
increased
aPAI1,
tPAI1,
IL-8,
MCP-1, sIL-1R1, and TNFa and decreased IGFII
compared to those without ballooning (Table 3; Sup-
porting Table S1). MCP-1 and tPAI1 did not meet
the FDR adjusted threshold for statistical signifi-
cance. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis,
the presence of hepatocyte ballooning was associated
with increased IL-8 (OR 5 1.27, 95% CI 1.04-1.56,
P 5 0.021) and decreased IGFII (OR 5 0.86, 95%
CI 0.77-0.96, P 5 0.006) (Table 4). IL-8 was associ-
ated with increased age, AST, and HOMA-IR
(Table 5).
Lobular inflammation was seen in fewer than two
foci per 320 field (grade 1) in 52% of participants, two
to four foci (grade 2) in 37% of participants, and more
than four foci (grade 3) in 11% of participants. Com-
pared to participants with grade 0-1 lobular inflamma-
tion, those with grade 2-3 lobular inflammation had
decreased MCP-1 (Table 3; Supporting Table S2) in
univariable logistic regression. MCP-1 did not meet
the FDR adjusted threshold for statistical significance.
In multivariable logistic regression analysis for the
presence of grade 2-3 lobular inflammation compared
to grade 0-1 lobular inflammation, decreased MCP-1
(OR 5 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99, P 5 0.025) was asso-
ciated with increased odds of lobular inflammation
(Table 4). In addition, MCP-1 was associated with
increased age, BMI, and HOMA-IR. Because advanc-
ing fibrosis in NAFLD is associated with a shift from
lobular inflammation to more portal-based inflamma-
tion(21) and MCP-1 is associated with fibrosis, we per-
formed sensitivity analysis on the association between
MCP-1 and lobular inflammation excluding patients
with cirrhosis; and the association was no longer statis-
tically significant (OR 5 0.92, 95% CI 0.83-1.01, P 5
0.073).
BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED
WITH FIBROSIS
Twenty-six percent of participants had no fibrosis
on liver biopsy, 29% had stage 1, 20% had stage 2,
17% had stage 3, and 8% had stage 4 fibrosis. In uni-
variable logistic regression participants with significant
fibrosis (stage 2-4) had lower levels of IGFII and hap-
toglobin and higher levels of IL-8, resistin, sIL-1R1,
sIL-2Ra, MCP-1, and TNFa compared with no or
mild
fibrosis

3;

In a multivariable analysis of significant fibrosis
compared to no or mild fibrosis, increased IL-8 (OR
5 1.81, 95% CI 1.47-2.23, P < 0.001), MCP-1 (OR
5 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, P 5 0.020), resistin (OR
5 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.20, P 5 0.040), sIL-1R1 (OR
5 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29, P 5 0.009), sIL-2Ra (OR
5 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.43, P < 0.001), and TNFa
(OR 5 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.44, P 5 0.018) and
decreased IGFII (OR 5 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.84, P <
0.001) were associated with significant fibrosis (Table
4). Resistin was associated with female sex and
increased HOMA-IR and BMI and inversely associat-
ed with ALT. sIL-1R1 was associated with female sex
and increased BMI, ALT, AST, and HOMA-IR.
sIL-2Ra was associated with female sex and increased
age, BMI, and AST and inversely associated with tri-
glycerides. TNFa was associated with increased age
(Table 5). sIL-2Ra correlated with IL-8, MCP-1,
resistin, and sIL-1R1. IL-8 correlated with MCP-1
and TNFa as well. IGFII was inversely correlated with
IL-8 and sIL-2Ra (Supporting Table S3).
Discussion
In this study, using a large population with well-
characterized histological NAFLD, we explored the
relationship between putative biomarkers and the his-
tologic disease spectrum associated with NAFLD. We
identified
biomarkers
that
remain
strongly
and
independently associated with specific NAFLD phe-
notypes after adjustment for clinical factors. We found
that higher aPAI1 levels were associated with NASH
(versus non-NASH or borderline NASH). Higher
aPAI1, tPAI1, and IGFII and lower adiponectin were
associated with significant steatosis; and increased IL-
8 levels and decreased IGFII were associated with
hepatocyte ballooning. In addition, among seven bio-
markers associated with the presence of significant
fibrosis, increased IL-8 and sIL-2Ra and decreased
IGFII demonstrated the strongest associations.
The diagnosis and staging of NASH have long
relied on histologic evaluation of liver biopsy, which is
invasive, potentially subject to sampling error, and
inconvenient as a repeat measure of disease severity
over time. Many studies have explored the ability of
biomarkers to predict disease activity.(9,11,22-24) These
studies have been plagued by small sample sizes, have
often lacked liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis, and
have measured very few candidate biomarkers. To
date, the most promising biomarker for NAFLD has
been cytokeratin 18. Wieckowska et al. initially exam-
ined the relationship between cytokeratin 18, a protein
cleaved during apoptosis, and NASH in 44 consecutive
patients with suspected NAFLD. While cytokeratin
18 levels yielded an area under the receiver operating
curve of 0.93, only 21 patients had NASH.(25) More-
over, attempts to validate these findings in a larger
population of 318 patients yielded unacceptable perfor-
mance characteristics for the diagnosis of NASH and
provided little additional data beyond ALT levels,

 leaving the need for a biomarker(s) to predict disease
activity in NAFLD unmet.(26)
In our study, the only biomarker that remained asso-
ciated with the histological diagnosis of NASH after
adjustment for clinical factors was aPAI1. PAI1 is a
serine protease inhibitor and a primary regulator of the
fibrinolytic system but also has significant effects on
cell adhesion, detachment, and migration.(27) PAI1
gene expression in the liver is up-regulated by endotox-
in and inflammatory mediators, and levels may reflect
TNFa signal dysregulation.(28,29) PAI1 gene expres-
sion is up-regulated in livers with NASH, and plasma
levels are increased in patients with NASH.(30,31) Pre-
vious studies have not evaluated differences in levels of
aPAI1 and tPAI1 and their relationship to NAFLD.
The active form is secreted by cells but is unstable and
spontaneously converts into the latent form within 1-2
hours.(32) The latent form can be converted to the
active form, and the increased inflammatory milieu
associated with NASH could drive this process. This
finding warrants evaluation in further studies.
Our study found an association between increased
aPAI1, tPAI1, and IGFII as well as decreased adipo-
nectin and significant steatosis. PAI1 levels correlate
more with liver fat content than visceral adipose con-
tent.(33) Insulin induces PAI1 expression, and improve-
ment
in
insulin
resistance
with
weight
loss
or
troglitazone is associated with a reduction in PAI1 lev-
els.(34-36) Multiple studies have shown an association
between PAI1 levels and NAFLD, which our study
corroborates.(30,37,38) IGFII is part of the family of
ligands that mediate growth, development, and differ-
entiation and act primarily through IGF1 receptor.(39)
IGFII has significant structural homology with insu-
lin,(40) shares biological actions through the insulin
receptor,(41) and thereby could lead to decreased lipolyt-
ic activity and increased steatosis, as was seen in our
study. Adiponectin is an adipokine with anti-inflamma-
tory(42) and insulin-sensitizing(43) effects. Our study
confirms previously documented inverse associations
with hepatic steatosis(44) but contrasts with previous
studies suggesting an inverse association with NASH
severity.(9)
We found that increased IL-8 was associated with
the presence of hepatocyte ballooning. IL-8 is a che-
mokine that serves as a chemoattractant for neutrophils
and contributes to acute liver inflammation.(45) Previ-
ous studies have shown an association between NASH
and increased IL-8 levels; however, ours is the first to
document a significant association specifically between
IL-8 levels and hepatocyte ballooning.(46,47) Increased
lobular inflammation was associated with decreased
MCP-1. MCP-1 is a chemoattractant that activates
target cells including macrophages and has been asso-
ciated with hepatic steatosis and NASH; however, pri-
or
studies
had
no
or
few
participants
with
fibrosis.(5,8,48)
Our
finding
of
decreased
MCP-1
among those with more lobular inflammation is likely
confounded by the presence of cirrhosis. Patients with
cirrhosis had higher MCP-1 and less lobular inflam-
mation, and when excluded from the analysis the asso-
ciation between MCP-1 and lobular inflammation was
no longer statistically significant. Furthermore, MCP-
1 did not meet the FDR adjusted threshold for statisti-
cal significance on univariable analysis. Therefore,
these results should be interpreted with caution.
Seven biomarkers were strongly associated with sig-
nificant fibrosis in the multivariable model: IL-8,
MCP-1, resistin, sIL-1R1, sIL-2Ra, TNFa, and
IGFII. The strongest associations in terms of statistical
significance and effect size were IL-8, sIL-2Ra, and
IGFII. In addition to its relationship with hepatocyte
ballooning, increased IL-8 was associated with signifi-
cant fibrosis. In hepatitis C virus models of hepatic
fibrosis, IL-8 was the strongest inducer of alpha-
smooth muscle actin expression in primary hepatic
stellate cells.(49) IL-8 serum levels and increased gene
expression were associated with fibrosis and advanced
cirrhosis in a study of other causes of chronic liver dis-
ease,(50) and our study supports these findings in
patients with NAFLD. sIL-2Ra is formed by proteo-
lytic cleavage of the IL-2 receptor from the cell surface
of multiple immune cells and is proportional to its
membrane-bound
expression.(51)
An
association
between increased levels and advanced fibrosis has
been documented in non-NAFLD liver disease.(52-54)
Our study is the first to document this association in
patients with NAFLD. Finally, our study found an
association between decreased IGFII and significant
fibrosis, in addition to the previously highlighted asso-
ciation between increased IGFII and steatosis. Prior
studies of IGFII have revealed that levels are lower in
patients with cirrhosis.(55) In a small study of pediatric
patients with NAFLD, lower IGFII levels correlated
with the degree of fibrosis; and our study corroborates
this finding in adults.(56) IGFII was found to protect
against the effects of caspases 3 and 9 in the liver,
thereby decreasing free radical damage and apoptosis
in rats; and this may underlie the association of IGFII
with fibrosis.(57) Further studies are warranted.
Our study has a number of strengths, including the
large number of well-characterized participants and the

 number of biomarkers evaluated. All of the biomarkers
were chosen based on a priori hypotheses regarding
their relationship with NAFLD, and our findings are
well supported by previous literature. We did evaluate
multiple biomarkers and outcomes in this study; how-
ever, we have highlighted only those with strong asso-
ciations in multivariable models in our discussion. We
provided FDR adjusted P value thresholds in univari-
able analysis for readers to interpret. By applying the
FDR adjusted thresholds to biomarker selection for
multivariable models, only the association between
MCP-1 and lobular inflammation would have been
eliminated from our multivariable models. Further-
more, a corresponding study among pediatric patients
in the NASH-CRN corroborates many of our findings
including the associations between IGFII and steatosis
and between IL-8 and fibrosis. While we have demon-
strated significant relationships between plasma levels
of biomarkers and the pathological spectrum of
NAFLD, we cannot evaluate causal relationships.
Therefore, while certain biomarkers may be critical to
the pathogenesis of NAFLD, their plasma levels may
not correlate with disease activity or the relationship
may have been diminished by a clinical factor included
in the multivariable model. However, the goal of this
study was to explore the most impactful biomarkers in
NAFLD and evaluate the relationships between bio-
markers and clinical factors. Therefore, we also evalu-
ated the associations between significant biomarkers
and clinical factors to provide context for the potential
role of the biomarker in NAFLD. Our study was lim-
ited by the cross-sectional measurement of our out-
come, which does not allow evaluation of the temporal
relationship between specific biomarkers and disease
activity or prediction of how changes in biomarkers
will affect disease progression. However, the findings
of this study should inform biomarker selection for
future longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Finally,
the patients drawn from the NASH CRN represent
those with an a priori diagnosis of NAFLD. Inclusion
of patients from the PIVENS trial decreased the prev-
alence of diabetic patients in our study sample com-
pared to the NAFLD population at large and may
affect generalizability. However, our multivariable
models adjusted for HOMA-IR, and strong associa-
tions between biomarkers and histology remained
present.
In conclusion, our study explored relationships
between clinical factors, biomarkers, and histologic
severity of disease in NAFLD. We found strong asso-
ciations, after multivariable adjustment for clinical
factors, of specific biomarkers with the histologic man-
ifestations of NAFLD. Measurement of serum bio-
markers will advance our ability to stratify disease
severity in NAFLD and may identify additional path-
ways to target for therapeutic intervention.
