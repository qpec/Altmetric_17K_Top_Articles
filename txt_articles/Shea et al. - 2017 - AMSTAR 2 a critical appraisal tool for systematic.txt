AMSTAR 2: a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews that 
include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare 
interventions, or both

The number of published systematic 
reviews of studies of healthcare 
interventions has increased rapidly and 
these are used extensively for clinical 
and policy decisions. Systematic 
reviews are subject to a range of biases 
and increasingly include non-
randomised studies of interventions. It 
is important that users can distinguish 
high quality reviews. Many instruments 
have been designed to evaluate 
different aspects of reviews, but there 
are few comprehensive critical 
appraisal instruments. AMSTAR was 
developed to evaluate systematic 
reviews of randomised trials. In this 
paper, we report on the updating of 
AMSTAR and its adaptation to enable 
more detailed assessment of 
systematic reviews that include 
randomised or non-randomised 
studies of healthcare interventions, or 
both. With moves to base more 
decisions on real world observational 
evidence we believe that AMSTAR 2 will 
assist decision makers in the 
identification of high quality systematic 
reviews, including those based on 
non-randomised studies of healthcare 
interventions.
With the rapid increase in biomedical publishing, 
keeping up with primary research has become 
almost impossible for healthcare practitioners and 
policy makers.1 Consequently, healthcare decision 
makers rely on systematic reviews as one of the 
key tools for achieving evidence based healthcare.2 
Systematic reviews provide an opportunity to base 
decisions on accurate, succinct, credible, and 
comprehensive summaries of the best available 
evidence on a topic.2
Uncritically accepting the results of a single 
systematic review has risks. One of us (DM) led efforts 
to improve standards for reporting of systematic 
reviews, which led to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
statement.3 The reporting guide for systematic 
reviews of observational (non-randomised) studies 
is MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology).4 The quality of reporting of a systematic 
review may, however, more accurately reflect authors’ 
ability to write in a comprehensible manner rather than 
the way they conducted their review. This underscores 
the need for guidelines that evaluate the way in which 
reviews are planned and conducted.5 6
The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook provides a 
comprehensive guide for review authors, but it does 
not provide a concise critical appraisal instrument for 
completed reviews.5 Several instruments have been 
designed to evaluate individual studies that are being 
included in systematic reviews or how certain steps 
(eg, meta-analysis, testing for publication bias) should 
be conducted.7-15 But relatively few instruments assess 
all important steps in the conduct of a review.16-21
AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic 
Reviews), published in 2007, is one of the most widely 
used instruments.22-24 AMSTAR was designed by us 
and our colleagues as a practical critical appraisal 
tool for use by health professionals and policy makers 
who do not necessarily have advanced training in 
epidemiology, to enable them to carry out rapid and 
reproducible assessments of the quality of conduct 
of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials 
of interventions. Since publication, several critiques

of the instrument have been published.25-31 These 
critiques plus feedback received at workshops and 
developments in the science of systematic reviews 
pointed to a need to revise and update the original 
AMSTAR instrument.
inclusion of non-randomised studies in systematic 
reviews
Almost half of published systematic reviews now 
include non-randomised studies of intervention 
effects.4 32-34 There are many concerns about the conduct 
and reporting of systematic reviews of non-randomised 
studies.32 35 36 To summarise, non-randomised studies 
of healthcare interventions (an important focus of this 
revision of AMSTAR) are subject to a range of biases 
that are either not present or are less noticeable in 
randomised controlled trials, thus requiring different 
risk of bias assessments. Observational studies are 
increasingly conducted within large population 
databases, sometimes with hundreds of thousands or 
even millions of recipients of healthcare interventions. 
These generate precise estimates of intervention 
effects, which may be inaccurate because of residual 
biases. If these estimates are combined with those 
from the (generally smaller) randomised controlled 
trials, the meta-estimates will be weighted towards the 
observational study estimates. The original AMSTAR 
instrument did not include an assessment of the risk of 
bias in non-randomised studies included in a review, 
which is a key issue given the diversity of designs that 
such studies may use and the biases that may affect 
them.
Development of amStar 2
The development and validation of the original 
AMSTAR instrument (published in 2007) has been 
described in detail elsewhere.22-24 Briefly, the original 
list of items was created from the results of a scoping 
review of the then available rating instruments. This 
review identified many over-lapping appraisal items, 
mainly from two extensively cited reports.16 17 The 
lists of items from these reports were combined and 
reduced by factor analysis. After pilot testing, items 
were reworded as needed and the reliability and 
usability of the tool was assessed. A modified version 
was validated externally and performed well against 
the global judgments of a panel of content experts.23 
The publications describing the original AMSTAR 
instrument were widely cited and the instrument has 
been used and critiqued extensively.22-31
We convened an expert group, comprising authors 
of the original instrument, members with expertise in 
the conduct of non-randomised studies, development 
of appraisal instruments, biostatistics, and study 
designs. The expert group met for a day in Ottawa, 
Canada and members were presented with the results 
of updated literature reviews on relevant critical 
appraisal instruments, the results of surveys of 
AMSTAR users, recorded experience of participants in 
AMSTAR workshops at Cochrane Colloquiums in 2015 
and 2016, feedback from the AMSTAR website (www.
amstar.ca), and published critiques of the original 
instrument.16-26 The perspective adopted by the expert 
group was to increase the value of AMSTAR as a broad 
critical appraisal instrument designed primarily 
for systematic reviews of studies of healthcare 
interventions. The expert group considered that 
revisions should address all aspects of the conduct of 
a systematic review, and the challenges of including 
non-randomised studies. They also thought the revised 
instrument should function as a teaching aid and as 
a concise checklist for those conducting reviews. The 
revisions were not intended to deal with the special 
requirements of diagnostic test reviews, individual 
patient data meta-analyses or network meta-analyses, 
scoping reviews, or realist reviews.37-41
We used a nominal group technique to propose and 
then prioritise specific changes to the instrument and 
to agree on the draft wording of items. Based on their 
experience of the instrument and the presentations 
made at the meeting, participants were asked to 
record their ideas independently and privately. The 
ideas were then enunciated in a round-robin format. 
One idea was collected from everyone, in turn, 
and presented to the group by the facilitator. This 
process was continued until all ideas had been listed. 
Individuals then privately recorded their judgments 
and rankings. These were aggregated statistically to 
derive the group judgments. The following changes 
were agreed on (these are not listed in order of priority 
as all were considered important enough to mandate 
modifications to the instrument):
•  
Simplify the response categories
•  
Align the definition of research questions with the 
PICO (population, intervention, control group, 
outcome) framework
•  
Seek justification for the review authors’ selection 
of different study designs (randomised and non-
randomised) for inclusion in systematic reviews
•  
Seek more details on reasons for exclusion of studies 
from the review
•  
Determine whether the review authors had made a 
sufficiently detailed assessment of risk of bias for 
the included studies (whether randomised or non-
randomised)
•  
Determine whether risk of bias with included studies 
was considered adequately during statistical pooling 
of results (if this was performed)
•  
Determine whether risk of bias with included studies 
was considered adequately when interpreting and 
discussing the review findings.
A description was formulated for each of the draft 
items. A small subgroup refined the wording of the 
items and assembled the draft instrument for testing. 
Initial pilot testing was performed by group members. 
Draft versions were presented at workshops held 
at the Cochrane Colloquiums in 2015 and 2016, 
where feedback directed further modifications and 
redrafting of the instrument. The version of the 
instrument presented here was subject to inter-rater 
reliability and usability testing.

Comparison with the original instrument
The supplementary figure provides details of the new 
instrument (AMSTAR 2). Ten domains were retained 
from the original tool, with changes to the wording of 
items based on feedback about the original instrument 
and experience of testing drafts of the new instrument. 
Two domains were given more detailed coverage in 
AMSTAR 2 than in the original instrument: duplicate 
study selection and data extraction now have their 
own items (they were combined in the original tool). 
The possible influence of funding sources is now 
considered separately for individual studies included 
in the review and for the review itself. Previously 
they were combined in one item. We added more 
detailed and separate considerations of risk of bias 
for randomised and non-randomised studies. Both 
sub-items are based on content from the Cochrane 
risk of bias instruments for randomised and non-
randomised (ROBINS-I) studies.42 43 One domain was 
removed—consideration of grey literature, previously a 
separate item, is now handled in the item on literature 
searching.
In total, four domains were added. Two of these 
came directly from the ROBINS-I tool—namely, 
elaboration of the PICO and the way in which risk of 
bias was handled during evidence synthesis.43 One of 
the other new domains—discussion of possible causes 
and significance of heterogeneity—is an elaboration 
of content in the original AMSTAR tool. Another new 
domain—justification of selection of study designs—
was part of the adaptation of AMSTAR to deal with 
non-randomised designs.
The domain specific questions in AMSTAR 2 are 
framed so that a “Yes” answer denotes a positive result. 
We removed the “not applicable” and “cannot answer” 
options in the original AMSTAR instrument because we 
believe that all domains are relevant to contemporary 
systematic reviews of healthcare interventions. If no 
information is provided to rate an item, the review 
authors should not be given the benefit of doubt and 
the item should be rated as a “No.” We have provided 
a “partial Yes” response in some instances where we 
considered it worthwhile to identify partial adherence 
to the standard.
rationale for selection of items
Here we summarise our thinking behind the items in 
AMSTAR 2, which are numbered as in the instrument 
(see supplementary figure). Supplementary appendix 1 
provides a more complete user’s guide.
1. Did the research questions and inclusion criteria for 
the review include the components of PICO?
It is common practice to use the PICO description 
(population, intervention, control group, and outcome) 
as a convenient and easily memorised framework for 
a study question. Sometimes a timeframe should be 
added if this is critical in determining the likelihood 
of a study capturing relevant clinical outcomes (eg, an 
effect of the intervention is only expected after several 
years).
2. Did the report of the review contain an explicit 
statement that the review methods were established 
prior to the conduct of the review and did the report 
justify any significantdeviations from the protocol?
Systematic reviews are a form of observational 
research, and the methods for the review should be 
agreed on before the review commences. Adherence to 
a well developed protocol reduces the risk of bias in the 
review. Authors should show that they worked with a 
written protocol with independent verification.
3. Did the review authors explain their selection of the 
study designs for inclusion in the review?
For some questions, for instance the effects of policy 
changes, or for ethical reasons, non-randomised 
studies may be the only studies addressing the review 
question. With an expansion of AMSTAR 2 to appraise 
reviews that include randomised controlled trials or 
non-randomised studies, or both, it is important that 
authors justify the inclusion of different study designs 
in systematic reviews. The authors should indicate that 
they followed a strategy. When both randomised and 
non-randomised studies address the same question 
about the effects of an intervention, we believe that 
authors should consider whether a review that is 
restricted to randomised controlled trials will give 
an incomplete summary of the important effects of a 
treatment.
4. Did the review authors use a comprehensive 
literature search strategy?
The importance of adequate literature searching in 
systematic reviews is well established.5 This item was 
carried over with minimal changes to the wording from 
the original instrument. We have made the response 
options clearer in AMSTAR 2 and provide more detailed 
guidance on completion of the item, particularly 
in relation to the identification of non-randomised 
studies (see supplementary appendix 1).
5. Did the review authors perform study selection in 
duplicate?
Best practice requires two review authors to determine 
eligibility of studies for inclusion in systematic 
reviews.5 This involves checking the characteristics of 
a study against the elements of the research question. 
In the original AMSTAR, this item covered determining 
both study eligibility and data extraction. The expert 
group believed that they were sufficiently distinct 
processes to merit separate items in AMSTAR 2.
6. Did the review authors perform data extraction in 
duplicate?
The expert group recognised that data extraction 
might be more complex for non-randomised studies 
of healthcare interventions as it usually involves 
extraction of measures of treatment effects and other 
associations that have been adjusted for potential 
confounding, rather than raw outcome data from 
treated and control groups. A study report may present 
multiple treatment effects; judgment is therefore 
needed to select the one that conforms best to the PICO 
question and is at lowest risk from confounding.

7. Did the review authors provide a list of excluded 
studies and justify the exclusions?
In the revised instrument we consider excluded and 
included studies separately. Excluded studies should 
be accounted for fully by review authors, otherwise 
there is a risk that they remain invisible and the impact 
of their exclusion from the review is unknown.
8. Did the review authors describe the included studies 
in adequate detail?
The revised instrument requires review authors 
to provide detail about research designs, study 
populations, 
interventions, 
comparators, 
and 
outcomes. The detail should be sufficient for appraisers 
to make a judgment about the extent to which the 
studies were appropriately chosen (in relation to 
the PICO) and whether the study populations and 
interventions were relevant to their questions. This 
information is needed to determine the extent to which 
the results of different studies should be combined, 
help explain heterogeneity, and assist those applying 
the results.
9. Did the review authors use a satisfactory technique 
for assessing the risk of bias (RoB) in individual studies 
that were included in the review?
Biases can be introduced at several stages in the 
design, planning, conduct, and analysis of a study. 
This item replaces a less detailed item on “scientific 
quality.” The item specifies domains of bias for 
randomised and non-randomised studies that should 
have been considered by reviewers, based on the 
relevant Cochrane instruments.42 43 In AMSTAR 2 we 
ask whether the review authors made an adequate 
assessment of study level efforts to avoid, control, 
or adjust for baseline confounding, selection biases, 
bias in measurement of exposures and outcomes, 
and selective reporting of analyses or outcomes, or 
both. The guidance document (see supplementary 
appendix 1) and the ROBINS-I report provide more 
detail.43 We decided not to include assessment of 
time varying confounding, performance biases, 
and biases due to missing data, although they are 
currently included in ROBINS-I.43 This was because 
of the complex nature of techniques used to adjust for 
these potential sources of bias and the frequent lack 
of data (in contemporary primary studies) to enable 
assessment of these items. Version 2.0 of the Cochrane 
risk of bias instrument for randomised controlled 
trials is now available in draft form, and AMSTAR 2 
will be aligned with this in the future.44
10. Did the review authors report on the sources of 
funding for the studies included in the review?
We added a consideration of funding sources in 
the light of evidence from several sources that 
the results of industry funded studies sometimes 
favoured sponsored products, and that industry 
funded studies were less likely to be published than 
those that were independently funded.45-47 Such 
influences may not be detected as flaws in design or 
methods (item 9).
11. If meta-analysis was performed, did the review 
authors use appropriate methods for statistical 
combination of results?
This is a modified version of an item in the original 
instrument and is judged separately for randomised 
and non-randomised studies. Review authors should 
have stated explicitly in the review protocol the 
principles on which they based their decision to 
perform meta-analysis of data from the included 
studies. This includes the extent to which the studies 
are compatible (in terms of patients, controls, and 
interventions) and the value of a single pooled 
effect (for instance from several compatible but 
underpowered studies). Where reviewers consider it 
appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis, the inclusion 
of non-randomised studies increases the complexity 
of the analyses and may increase heterogeneity (see 
supplementary appendix 1).
12. If meta-analysis was performed, did the review 
authors assess the potential impact of RoB in individual 
studies on the results of the meta-analysis or other 
evidence synthesis?
This is a new item that requires reviewers to examine 
how results vary with inclusion or exclusion of primary 
studies judged to be at high risk of bias. In cases 
where review authors have chosen to include only 
high quality randomised controlled trials there may 
be little discussion of the potential impact of bias on 
the results. But where they have included randomised 
controlled trials of variable quality or non-randomised 
studies they should assess the impact of study level 
risk of bias on the results of the review.48
13. Did the review authors account for RoB in primary 
studies when interpreting/discussing the results of the 
review?
This is a modification of an item from the original 
instrument. With a greater emphasis on assessing risk 
of bias, the expectation is that reviewers will make 
explicit reference to the potential impacts of risk of 
bias when interpreting and discussing the results of 
their review and in drawing conclusions or making 
recommendations.
14. Did the review authors provide a satisfactory 
explanation for, and discussion of, any heterogeneity 
observed in the results of the review?
This item is carried over with modified wording from 
the original instrument. It is important that reviewers 
investigate possible causes of heterogeneity, including 
variation in those elements included in the PICO 
framework (see item 1) and those arising from design 
and methodological considerations (see item 9). With 
the inclusion of non-randomised studies, variations in 
design and analysis may contribute to heterogeneity.
15. If they performed quantitative synthesis did the 
review authors carry out an adequate investigation 
of publication bias (small study bias) and discuss its 
likely impact on the results of the review?
This item is carried over from the original instrument 
but with modified wording. Publication bias is an

important problem but it can be difficult for authors to 
resolve completely. Typically, statistical tests (several 
are available) or graphical displays are used and if 
the results are positive they indicate the presence 
of publication bias. Negative test results are not a 
guarantee of the absence of publication bias as they 
are insensitive. A minimum of 10 studies are required 
to show funnel plot asymmetry.5 The underlying 
tendency to selectively publish small positive 
studies may be compounded by the effects of lower 
methodological quality of small studies, a greater 
tendency to selectively report results, and increased 
clinical heterogeneity when conducted in patient 
subgroups.49
16. Did the review authors report any potential sources 
of conflict of interest, including any funding they 
received for conducting the review?
This item is carried over with modified wording from 
the original instrument and is now separate from 
consideration of funding of the primary studies 
included in the review (item 10). As with primary 
studies, review authors should report their funding 
sources.50 51
Identification of critical domains
All steps in the conduct of a systematic review and 
meta-analysis are important, but we believe that seven 
domains can critically affect the validity of a review and 
its conclusions (box 1). Two of these concern risk of 
bias, whether it has been assessed adequately and how 
it can influence the results of a review. The prominence 
we give to risk of bias is because AMSTAR 2 is going 
to be used to appraise many systematic reviews that 
include non-randomised studies.
We recognise that the items listed in box 1 will not 
always be regarded as critical; for example, risk of 
bias related items may be considered less important 
when a review is confined to high quality randomised 
controlled trials. Other circumstances where the 
critical nature of items may be questioned are when 
a review team are using meta-analysis to summarise 
a known literature base (eg, the output from one or 
more established clinical trial collaborative groups). 
In this circumstance the adequacy of the literature 
search (item 4), listing of excluded studies (item 7), 
and possibility of publication bias (item 15) may 
not be considered critical. If a meta-analysis was not 
performed, the item covering the appropriateness of 
the meta-analytical methods (item 11) will not apply. 
However, it is important in this circumstance that 
appraisers are alert to the possible impact of risk of 
bias when review authors select individual studies to 
highlight in a narrative summary.
Flaws in the items that we have identified as critical 
may not be fatal if further information (eg, directly from 
the review authors) indicates that the original response 
option was wrong. This may provide reassurance about 
the review findings or enable an amendment of the 
review through additional analyses. We emphasise 
that our listing is a suggestion and appraisers may add 
or substitute other critical domains. For example, the 
failure to include non-randomised studies (item 3) 
in a review of adverse outcomes of treatment may be 
a critical flaw, as would the inability to explain large 
variations in treatment effects across a body of studies 
(item 14).
Applying AMSTAR 2 to systematic reviews
If one or more systematic reviews will be the basis of 
important practice and policy decisions we recommend 
that the appraisal team agree on how the AMSTAR 2 
items should be applied. This includes the practice 
or policy context and the questions that should be 
addressed, based on the relevant PICO components. 
For example, available systematic reviews may 
have included studies with different comparators or 
different follow-up times, and their relevance to the 
policy relevant questions needs to be established. 
The likely sources of bias should also be agreed on. 
For instance, in observational studies of intervention 
effects, confounding by indication (or disease 
severity) may be problematic when interventions are 
reserved for certain subgroups of patients.52 It is good 
practice to recruit new users of a technology or drug 
into studies to avoid prevalence bias.53 If the start 
of one intervention tends to be delayed the choice 
of comparator may introduce immortal time bias.54 
Measurement errors can misclassify exposure and 
outcomes and may be unbalanced across comparison 
groups. Selective reporting among multiple analyses 
and outcomes may give an inaccurate measure of 
intervention effects.
Supplementary appendix 1 provides guidance 
on sections of AMSTAR 2. Some of the judgments 
(particularly whether review authors have adequately 
assessed risk of bias with individual non-randomised 
studies) are complex, and advice on both methodology 
and content may be needed. Content knowledge is 
sometimes necessary to determine if the review authors 
have made an adequate assessment of the relevant 
PICO elements (item 1), and to identify potential 
confounders.
We strongly recommend that individual item ratings 
are not combined to create an overall score.55 56 Rather, 
users should consider the potential impact of an 
inadequate rating for each item.
In box 2 we propose a scheme for interpreting 
weaknesses detected in critical and non-critical 
items. This is advisory and appraisers should decide 
which items are most important for the reviews under 
consideration.

Inter-rater reliability of AMSTAR 2
We measured inter-rater agreement with three pairs 
of raters and three sets of systematic reviews (see 
supplementary appendix 2). The first pair of raters 
was involved in the development of AMSTAR 2 
(coauthors MT and CH). They individually appraised 
20 systematic reviews derived from a rapid search 
(conducted in 2015 on the terms “systematic review” 
and “meta-analysis” in the title) using Google Scholar. 
From the first 200 we selected 20 systematic reviews 
of any healthcare intervention. The other two pairs of 
raters were experienced in the appraisal of systematic 
reviews and were not involved in the development 
of AMSTAR or AMSTAR 2. They applied AMSTAR 2 
during their routine work, performing appraisals 
of systematic reviews of two topics: interventions 
to reduce medication errors (14 reviews) and non-
pharmacological therapies for Parkinson’s disease (20 
reviews) (see references in supplementary appendix 2). 
In both cases systematic reviews had been identified 
through comprehensive literature searches (details 
available on request). All raters had access to the user 
guide (see supplementary appendix 1), applied the 
instrument individually, and did not try to achieve 
consensus. In total, six raters applied the instrument 
to 54 systematic reviews, of which 20 included only 
randomised controlled trials, 18 included only non-
randomised studies of interventions, and 16 included 
a mixture of both designs.
Supplementary appendix 2 provides summaries of 
the κ scores for agreement between the three pairs of 
raters across the three sets of reviews. The values varied 
substantially across items and between pairs of raters. 
Most values were in an acceptable range, with 46 of the 
50 κ scores falling in the range of moderate or better 
agreement and 39 displaying good or better agreement. 
There were no large differences between raters, and 
those who had been involved in the development of 
AMSTAR 2 did not have higher levels of agreement 
than the rater who was not involved. Items 9, 12, and 
13 are concerned with measurement of risk of bias and 
how this is handled during discussion of the meta-
analysis and interpretation of the results. The ranges 
of κ scores for these items were similar to those seen 
with other items in the instrument (see supplementary 
appendix 2). For items 9 and 11 the κ values for risk of 
bias judgments for randomised controlled trials were 
similar to those for non-randomised studies.
Usability of AMSTAR 2
The completion times for the 20 reviews used by 
reviewers 1 and 2 ranged from 15-32 minutes. These 
estimates do not include the time taken to read 
the reviews. This is almost twice the time taken to 
complete the original AMSTAR instrument (range 10-
15 minutes), when it was applied to systematic reviews 
that were limited to randomised controlled trials.57 
The comments from the reviewers included: that the 
removal of the “can’t answer” and “not applicable” 
response options in the original instrument forced 
them to make judgments; that it takes longer to 
evaluate the non-randomised and mixed study 
reviews, but this requires the reviewer to confront 
important methodological issues; that it was common 
for review authors to mention the presence or absence 
of publication bias, but not provide any evidence; and 
that review authors would disclose their potential 
competing interests but not how they managed them.
Discussion
AMSTAR 2 is a major revision of the original AMSTAR 
instrument, which was designed to appraise systematic 
reviews that included randomised controlled trials.22-24 
The main modifications include simplified response 
categories; a more detailed consideration of risk of 
bias with included studies, and how this was handled 
by review authors in summarising and interpreting the 
results of their reviews; better alignment with the PICO 
framework for research questions; a more detailed 
justification of selection of study designs for inclusion 
in a review; and more information on studies that were 
excluded from reviews. In addition, we recommend 
defining critical domains before starting an appraisal 
of a systematic review. Identification of weaknesses in 
these domains should undermine confidence in the 
results of a systematic review.
We stress that responses to AMSTAR 2 items should 
not be used to derive an overall score.55 56 The original 
AMSTAR instrument was often used for this purpose 
and this was facilitated by the website (www.amstar.
ca). We accept that an overall score may disguise critical 
weaknesses that should diminish confidence in the 
results of a systematic review and we recommend that 
users adopt the rating process based on identification 
of critical domains (see box 2), or some variation based 
on these principles.56
We envisage that AMTAR 2, like its predecessor, 
may have a role as a convenient teaching aid and 
as a brief checklist for those conducting systematic 
reviews. However, we stress that the instrument 
does not explain in detail the logic and methods of 
conducting systematic reviews, and those looking for 
Box 2: Rating overall confidence in the results of the review
•  
High
•  
No or one non-critical weakness: the systematic review provides an accurate and 
comprehensive summary of the results of the available studies that address the 
question of interest
•  
Moderate
•  
More than one non-critical weakness*: the systematic review has more than one 
weakness but no critical flaws. It may provide an accurate summary of the results of 
the available studies that were included in the review
•  
Low
•  
One critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses: the review has a critical 
flaw and may not provide an accurate and comprehensive summary of the available 
studies that address the question of interest
•  
Critically low
•  
More than one critical flaw with or without non-critical weaknesses: the review has 
more than one critical flaw and should not be relied on to provide an accurate and 
comprehensive summary of the available studies
*Multiple non-critical weaknesses may diminish confidence in the review and it may be 
appropriate to move the overall appraisal down from moderate to low confidence.

comprehensive advice should consult the Cochrane 
Handbook.5
The consideration of risk of bias in individual studies is 
equally important for randomised and non-randomised 
studies of healthcare interventions but is generally better 
understood with the former. Large non-randomised 
studies, often conducted in large administrative 
databases, are increasingly being used to assess the real 
world impact of a wide range of healthcare technologies 
and practices. Although such studies often use 
sophisticated methods, residual confounding or failure 
to deal with other sources of bias may lead to inaccurate 
estimates of effect. Inclusion of large observational 
studies in meta-analyses may generate precise but 
biased estimates of intervention effects.32
The items in AMSTAR 2 that deal with risk of bias 
identify domains specified in the Cochrane risk of bias 
instruments for randomised and non-randomised 
studies.42 43 These represent a consensus, in each case 
developed with input from more than 30 experts in 
methodology. However, AMSTAR 2 does not currently 
specify which risk of bias instruments review authors 
should have used to assess non-randomised studies 
included in a systematic review. The ROBINS-I 
instrument, which is the most comprehensive tool 
for non-randomised studies evaluating the effects of 
healthcare interventions, was released in 2016 and it is 
unrealistic to expect authors of reviews started before 
its release to have used it.43 Presently, AMSTAR 2 leaves 
it to the review authors and those appraising the review 
to satisfy themselves that the risk of bias instrument 
used by review authors has sufficient discriminatory 
ability for the specified risk of bias domains. A review 
by Sanderson and colleagues identified 86 tools for 
assessing quality of observational studies, without a 
clear preference among them.58 The authors pointed 
to the need to agree on critical elements for assessing 
susceptibility to bias in observational epidemiology. In 
part this review led to the development of ROBINS-I.43 
Popular 
appraisal 
instruments 
for 
individual 
studies, such as the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 
checklist may not focus on validity alone.59 60 The 
Newcastle Ottawa Scale appears to lack sensitivity 
and is sometimes used to generate an overall score, 
something that is not recommended because it may 
disguise critical weaknesses in a review.56 61
AMSTAR 2, as a critical appraisal instrument for 
systematic reviews, joins several published instruments 
designed for this purpose.3 4 16 17 19 20 25 62 Two 
prominent examples are concerned with guidelines 
for reporting systematic reviews, rather than their 
conduct.3 4 Two highly cited instruments were the basis 
for the development of the original AMSTAR tool.16 17 22 
Two published instruments are direct derivatives of the 
original AMSTAR.19 25 Another publication includes 
a checklist used to appraise systematic reviews that 
are being included in an umbrella review.20 Overlap 
between the content of this checklist and the original 
AMSTAR is considerable.22
AMSTAR 2 provides a broad assessment of quality, 
including flaws that may have arisen through poor 
conduct of the review (with uncertain impact on 
findings). In this respect it differs from another 
instrument, the Risk Of Bias In Systematic reviews 
(ROBIS).62 ROBIS is a sophisticated three phase 
instrument that focuses specifically on the risk of 
bias introduced by the conduct of the review. It covers 
most types of research question, including diagnosis, 
prognosis, and aetiology. In contrast, AMSTAR 2 
is intended to be used for reviews of healthcare 
interventions. Inevitably there is overlap in the 
items considered by ROBIS and AMSTAR 2; indeed, 
two investigators (BCR, BJS) were involved in the 
development of both.
In developing AMSTAR 2 we sought to maintain its 
familiar and popular stepwise checklist approach and 
augmented this by the addition and modification of 
items. AMSTAR 2 will be familiar to users of the original 
instrument, although more demanding to use for reasons 
discussed previously. Because AMSTAR 2 is structured 
around the key sequential steps in the conduct of a 
systematic review, it may be used as a brief teaching aid 
or as a checklist by those conducting systematic reviews.
Unlike the original instrument, AMSTAR 2 identifies 
critical weaknesses (see box 1) that should reduce 
confidence in the findings of a review, and it asks 
users to prespecify how this list will vary for the review 
topic. We understand that there will be debate about 
membership of this list and propose that users may 
wish to prespecify a different set of critical items for a 
specific PICO research question or setting.
We did not perform an extensive validation of 
the revised AMSTAR 2 tool. In its development, 10 
domains were retained from the original validated 
tool, albeit with some wording changes based on 
feedback and extensive experience of using it. Two 
domains were given more detailed coverage: duplicate 
study selection and data extraction now have their 
own items (they were combined in the original 
tool); we have added more detailed, and separate, 
considerations of risk of bias for randomised and 
non-randomised studies. The sub-items were derived 
from widely used Cochrane instruments. One domain 
was removed; consideration of grey literature, 
previously a separate item, is now handled in the item 
on literature searching. In total, four domains were 
added. Two of these come directly from the ROBINS-I 
tool—namely, elaboration of PICO in the review and 
the way in which risk of bias was handled during 
evidence synthesis.43 One of the other new domains, 
discussion of possible causes and importance of 
heterogeneity, is elaboration of content in the original 
AMSTAR tool.22 The final domain, justification of 
selection of study designs, is justified by adapting 
AMSTAR to deal with non-randomised designs. We do 
not think this needs validation because we believe it 
is obvious that authors of systematic reviews should 
justify why they have included study designs that are 
more susceptible to bias.

The levels of agreement achieved by the three pairs 
of raters varied across items, but they were moderate 
to substantial for most items. Notably, the agreement 
between two raters involved in the development 
of AMSTAR 2 was no higher than that achieved by 
experienced raters who had not been involved its 
development. We did not expect perfect agreement, 
and differences between raters reflect the demanding 
nature of some item level judgments and should prompt 
group discussion of their causes and importance, and, 
if needed, consultation with experts in subject matter 
and methods.
In developing AMSTAR 2 we relied heavily on the 
consensus of the expert panel, but we also received 
extensive feedback from users of the original 
instrument in the form of direct communications, 
website comments, and evaluations made at teaching 
workshops at Cochrane Colloquiums. In the later 
phases of development of AMSTAR 2 we had access 
to, and discussed, recently published critiques of 
AMSTAR.25-31
Our experience of releasing and using the original 
AMSTAR instrument is that judgments need to be made 
and users may sometimes decide to make modifications 
to the instrument.25 26 30 We encourage investigators to 
provide feedback, and, if they adapt the instrument for 
particular settings, to report their experience at www.
amstar.ca.
