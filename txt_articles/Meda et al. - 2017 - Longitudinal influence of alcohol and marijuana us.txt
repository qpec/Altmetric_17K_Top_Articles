Abstract
Background
Alcohol and marijuana are the two most abused substances in US colleges. However,
research on the combined influence (cross sectional or longitudinal) of these substances on
academic performance is currently scant.
Methods
Data were derived from the longitudinal 2-year Brain and Alcohol Research in College Stu-
dents (BARCS) study including 1142 freshman students who completed monthly marijuana
use and alcohol consumption surveys. Subjects were classified into data-driven groups
based on their alcohol and marijuana consumption. A linear mixed-model (LMM) was
employed using this grouping factor to predict grade point average (GPA), adjusted for a
variety of socio-demographic and clinical factors.
Results
Three data-driven clusters emerged: 1) No/low users of both, 2) medium-high alcohol/no-
low marijuana, and 3) medium-high users of both substances. Individual cluster derivations
between consecutive semesters remained stable. No significant interaction between clus-
ters and semester (time) was noted. Post-hoc analysis suggest that at the outset, compared
to sober peers, students using moderate to high levels of alcohol and low marijuana demon-
strate lower GPAs, but this difference becomes non-significant over time. In contrast, stu-
dents consuming both substances at moderate-to-high levels score significantly lower at
both the outset and across the 2-year investigation period. Our follow-up analysis also

Conclusions
Overall, our study validates and extends the current literature by providing important impli-
cations of concurrent alcohol and marijuana use on academic achievement in college.
Introduction
Substance abuse (including alcohol) by students is prevalent at U.S. colleges and universities.
About 4 of 5 college students drink alcohol and among these, half binge drink [1–3]. Following
alcohol, marijuana (MJ) is the most frequent substance of choice among college students [4].
National surveys of individuals aged 18–25 indicate 52% report lifetime use, 31% report usage
within the prior twelve months and 21% within the past month [1–3]. Further, 58% of alcohol
drinking adolescents report using alcohol and marijuana simultaneously [5].
Recent research indicates that both alcohol and marijuana tend to alter brain structure/
function, and are associated with impaired decision making, memory and impulsivity in
young adults and adolescents [6–12]. Evidence suggests that adolescents who drink alcohol
and also smoke tobacco cigarettes/marijuana are more likely to manifest alcohol and other
substance use disorders as young adults compared to those who delay using these substances
[13]. More recent evidence also points to the concomitant use of both alcohol and marijuana
being associated with abnormal neural tissue development in young adults [14] and worse
critical skills such as complex attention, memory, processing speed and visuospatial func-
tioning in adolescents [15]. Despite these documented ill-effects of alcohol and marijuana
there has been little change in substance use trends among college students in the past
decade [4].
Substance use also has a larger adverse effect on cognitive functions when initiated earlier
in life [7, 16, 17]. Early-onset marijuana users demonstrate poorer attention, cognitive inhibi-
tion and abstract reasoning, all of which are critical skills needed to function and succeed in a
college environment [17]. A large longitudinal study confirmed that adolescent-onset mari-
juana users showed the largest full scale IQ drop between childhood and adulthood. Moreover,
adolescent subjects who used marijuana regularly never reached their predicted IQ levels, even
after sustained abstinence [18]. This study also documented that persistent cannabis use was
associated with neuropsychological decline across broad functional domains, thus highlighting
cannabis’ detrimental long term effects.
Relative to the larger costs to society raised by substance use, academic costs might appear
to be minimal. However the impact on academic achievement due to substance use may mean-
ingfully influence long-term student success. Most academic performance research with col-
lege students has focused on examining alcohol and marijuana effects separately, with little
examination of their combined effects. Because substance use patterns tend to cluster among
students, it is important to recognize that their influence on academic outcomes may have sep-
arable additive or synergistic effects. Substance use has been directly related to a variety of aca-
demic problems; substance-using college students skip more classes, spend less time studying,
show decreased motivation and have disrupted sleep patterns [19–24]. Arria et al. performed a
large scale longitudinal study which indicated that college students who used marijuana very

 frequently during all four years were twice as likely as minimal users to experience discontinu-
ous enrollment [20]. These intermediary processes ultimately cascade into more short- and
long- term issues such as dropping out of college, losing potential in-college work opportuni-
ties, delayed graduation and unemployment [20, 25].
It is important to note that alcohol and marijuana are not the only factors that contribute
to poor academic achievement. A variety of other mediating and/or comorbid factors such
as socioeconomic status, mental health (anxiety and depression in particular), cultural and
family values, stress handling capability, peer pressure, intelligence quotient (IQ), tobacco
smoking etc can play a major role in determining academic performance in college students
[19, 22, 26–29].
The aim of the current study was therefore to examine the effects of concurrent alcohol and
marijuana use on academic performance in a large sample of college students over a two year
period. We hypothesized that a) heavy users of either substance would have lower grades than
minimal users of both substances and b) students who consumed both alcohol and marijuana
heavily would experience a larger decline in GPA over time.
Methods and materials
A convenience sample of first-year students (age range 18–23 years) was recruited from two
local colleges with diverse populations through e-mail, flyers and classroom visits to solicit par-
ticipation in the Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students (BARCS) study [30]. The
recruitment captured greater than 95% of possible participants. Given no minors were
recruited; consent was obtained only from subjects and not their parents. All subjects provided
written informed consent, including consent to obtain their GPAs each semester of the study.
The study was approved by institutional review boards at Central Connecticut State University
(CCSU), Trinity College, Hartford Hospital and Yale University. As part of the ongoing study,
participants completed online demographic, clinical and substance use surveys every month
for two years excluding summer months.
Variables acquired longitudinally
Grade Point Average (GPA).
Individual GPA data (up to 2 decimal places) were collected
for each semester from college records.
Alcohol use.
Two different measures of alcohol use were recorded for each subject on the
monthly substance use questionnaires a) the number of days an individual consumed alcohol
in the past 30 days and b) the number of drinks he/she had on each occasion.
Marijuana use. Students reported their monthly marijuana use in a scaled manner, rang-
ing from 1–6. 1 was defined as having never used marijuana in the past 30 days, 2—having
used 1–2 times, 3—having used 3–5 times, 4 –having used 6–9 times, 5 -having used 10–19
times and 6 having used 20+ times in the past month.
Variables acquired only at semester 1
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).
Individual SAT scores for math, verbal and writing were
obtained from college records. SAT scores were explicitly included as they have been previ-
ously demonstrated to be good predictors of intelligence quotient (IQ) [31].
Socio-Economic Status (SES).
SES was calculated using Hollingshead’s four-factor index
at the initial visit [32]. Occupational and educational scores were calculated for both parents
and then summed to compute a total SES score. Although the direct impact of SES on aca-
demic achievement is debatable, we wanted to adjust for any overlapping variance it shared
with substance abuse in our current study.

 Tobacco (Cigarette) smoking. Data on cigarette smoking status was used as a covariate
in the current study as it has been shown to be linked with adverse health outcomes in college
students [33], which might be an important mediator for academic achievement. Smoking sta-
tus was assessed using the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence [34]. Individual responses
from item 4 from the Fagerstrom (How many cigarettes do you smoke per day) was used to
identify cigarette-smokers and non-smokers, converted into a binary yes/no format and
employed for further analyses.
Family History for Alcoholism (FHA).
Students were asked to self-report if they had at
least one affected first-degree relative with alcoholism. The above ‘yes/no’ answer was binary
coded and used for further analysis. Although studies examining FHA abuse among college
students have been largely conflicting, there has been evidence showing FHA is associated
with increased levels of alcohol use [28]. We therefore included the above variable as a means
to control for such effects in the current analysis.
Lastly, given that anxiety disorders [29, 35, 36] and depression [26, 29] have a direct impact
on academic success and often co-exist with substance abuse [37], we administered the mental
health questionnaires below at study entry (semester 1) to capture and control such confound-
ing aspects in analysis.
State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI). Students completed the trait sections of the STAI
questionnaire [38] at study entry. A total score was computed for each student by summing all
these values.
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
Students were administered the BDI to assess depres-
sive symptoms at study entry [39], all items from the inventory were summed to yield a total
score.
Pre-Processing
Before conducting statistical analysis, alcohol use quantity and frequency were multiplied
for each subject to derive total counts of alcoholic drinks consumed per month. Similarly,
marijuana scale measures were transformed to continuous measures by taking their mid-
point values for each monthly survey input. For example if a student reported consuming
marijuana between 6–9 times in the past month, this was converted to a value of 7.5 (mid-
point of 6–9). Given that our outcome variable (GPA) was based on a semester basis, we
therefore averaged substance use across all months in a semester to derive use measures for
that semester. Semester-wise substance use data were then log-transformed and used for fur-
ther analysis.
Given that the MJ and alcohol use data were highly correlated and skewed (see S1 Fig) we
chose to cluster substance use data into groups rather than retaining them as continuous inde-
pendent predictors in the model in order to estimate valid and non-biased coefficients. A
2-step cluster classifying algorithm was implemented in SPSS based on both alcohol and mari-
juana consumption measures as input to estimate the underlying data clusters in each semester
separately [40, 41]. This clustering algorithm as implemented in SPSS, first constructed a clus-
ter feature tree by placing the first case at the root of the tree in a leaf node, then each succes-
sive case was added to an existing node or forms a new node based on its similarity to existing
nodes using a distance measure as the similarity criterion. Finally, Individuals were grouped
into data-driven clusters using an agglomerative clustering algorithm [39]. These data driven
clusters were deemed time-varying and depending on each subjects’ combined substance use
patterns for that particular semester, individuals could potentially be categorized under a dif-
ferent cluster membership across each of the four semesters. Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC) was used to select the number of optimal data clusters across each semester. Resulting

 cluster assignments of individuals were then tested for their longitudinal inter-reliability using
Cohen’s kappa statistic [42].
Statistical analysis
A longitudinal linear mixed model (LMM) was implemented to assess whether cluster mem-
bership predicted changes in GPA across the four semesters. In leiu of missing data the mixed
effects approach is advantageous in a few ways over a conventional repeated measures
ANOVA model a) it uses all available data on each subject despite missing data by using a
maximum likelihood estimation process b) allows greater flexibility in modeling the correla-
tion structure of repeated measures data [43] and c) it relaxes the randomness constraints of
the missing data. In the current study, we first considered a full model which included main
effects of cluster membership (within-subject, time-varying), sex, semester (within-subject),
and the following covariates (captured at semester 1): age, SAT (math, verbal and writing)
scores, tobacco smoking status, FHA status, SES, anxiety- and depression-related scores. All
interactions between categorical predictors (i.e. sex, semester and cluster) were included in the
full model. For parsimony, non-significant interactions, except for the cluster�semester term
which interrogated GPA relationship with clusters over time, were dropped in the final model.
Post-hoc analyses, including simple cluster effects within each semester, were performed and
adjusted for Type I error using the Sidak method. In the above models, the correlation between
repeated observations within each subject was modeled by including random subject effects
and the best-fitting variance-covariance structure across time. The best fitting model was
based on the smallest Akaike information criteria (AIC) [41]. As a secondary analysis, we fit a
model including only the main and interactive effects of cluster and semester to examine the
overall effects of covariates on the result. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
v21 (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/). A total of 1142 subjects were included
in the final model; however the number of subjects with fully available data varied for each
semester (see Fig 1). Differential data missingness across substance use clusters for semesters
2–4 in relation to semester 1 cluster assignment was assessed using a chi-square test.
In order to get a broad sense of how change in cluster membership (substance use patterns)
over the two year period impacted academic GPA we conducted a secondary pseudo-trajectory
analysis. In order to do this, each subjects’ data was coded into one of three groups in terms of
their substance use as follows a) stable—those who remained in the same cluster at the start
and end of the study b) declining—those who moved from a better to worse cluster (cluster 1
to 3, cluster 2 to 3 or cluster 1 to 2) and c) improving—those who moved from a worse to a bet-
ter cluster (cluster 3 to 2, cluster 3 to 1 and cluster 2 to 1). For simplicity, we only used the
starting and the ending semester’s information to decide the above transition groups. Given

 that there were missing data, the ending semesters were not the same for all subjects. We then
performed a LMM similar to our primary analysis, however in this case we replaced the cluster
membership predictor that we previously used with the newly coined cluster (group) transi-
tion variable and also included semester 1 cluster membership as an additional control
variable.
Results
For subjects in the current study, there were no missing data for alcohol use variables across
the four semesters (among subjects that provided data). However, the refusal and/or missing
rates for marijuana data were as follows: semester 1: 0.4%, semester 2: 0%, semester 3: 22.3%
and semester 4: 32.2% which therefore resulted in 22% of students in the 3rd semester and 32%
of students in the 4th semester missing a cluster assignment. S1 Table provides details regard-
ing frequency and missingness of all variables included in the LMM.
Substance use cluster (group) identification
Three data-driven clusters were identified individually for each of the four semesters. Based on
substance use distribution, clusters were labeled as: No-low use of both substances (cluster 1),
medium-high alcohol/No-low marijuana (cluster 2), and medium-high use of both substances
(cluster 3; see Fig 1). The Silhouette measure of cohesion and separation for the data clusters
was 0.7. The silhouette measure represents how close each point in one cluster is to points in
the neighboring clusters and thus provides a way to assess parameters such as number of clus-
ters. Silhouette coefficients (as these values are referred to as) near +1 indicates that the sample
is far away from the neighboring clusters. A value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very
close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters and negative values indicates
that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster. In our study a value of 0.7
would refer to a good-very good separation of data. Demographics and clinical characteristics
of the clusters at baseline (first semester) are reported in Table 1. Scatter plots of alcohol/mari-
juana consumption for clusters across semesters are also shown in Fig 1.
Data missingness in semester 3 and 4 (in relation to semester 1 cluster assignment) was sig-
nificantly different across the three substance use clusters. For semester 3, missingness statis-
tics (chi-square 19.81; p<0.001) were as follows: 17.3% for cluster 1, 23.3% for cluster 2 and
32.9% of cluster 3. Similarly missingness for semester 4 (chi-square 36.83; p<0.001) data was
as follows: 26.1% for cluster 1, 31.3% for cluster 2 and 50% of cluster 3.
Cluster coherence among individuals was fairly stable when assessed in relation to baseline
(SEM1!SEM2: κ = 0.64; p<0.001, SEM1!SEM3: κ = 0.70; p<0.001, SEM1!SEM4: κ =
0.67; p<0.001). These kappa values suggested good-very good agreement of designated cluster
assignment of subjects across semesters compared to semester 1 values. Comparable cluster
coherence emerged when assessed on a semester-to-semester basis.
Linear Mixed-Model (LMM) analysis
As expected, the main effect of cluster membership (F (2,2267.8) = 20.6; p<0.001) was a signif-
icant predictor of academic performance after controlling for clinical and demographic vari-
ables. Post-hoc analyses showed that compared to cluster 1 students (who consumed little-no
alcohol/marijuana); those who consumed moderate-high level of alcohol (cluster 2) obtained
lower average GPAs (averaged across semester). Further, students in cluster 3 (who consumed
medium-high quantities of both substances) obtained lower grades compared to both cluster 1
and cluster 2 students. No significant higher-order interactions were observed. Although not
significant, per our initial hypothesis, the cluster�semester term was retained. Simple effects of

 cluster within each semester (cluster�semester) revealed differences in GPA between clusters 1
and 2 were significant only at semester 1 (See Fig 2). However, significantly reduced GPA was
noted in cluster 3 subjects compared to cluster 1 or 2 students across each of the four semes-
ters. In addition to cluster membership, tobacco smokers (shown in Fig 3) had significantly
lower GPA than non-smokers (F(1,873.2) = 4.16; p<0.05), males had significantly lower GPA
compared to females (F(1,844.6) = 12.26; p<0.001), SAT scores positively predicted GPA
(math (F(1,822.27) = 22.27; p<0.0001), writing (F(1,830.16) = 16.24; p<0.001)) and BDI was
negatively associated with GPA (F(1,851.80) = 4.51; p = 0.03)). LMM evaluated without any
covariates yielded exactly the same conclusions as above for the main effect of cluster, semester
and their interaction.
Our secondary pseudo-trajectory analysis indicated a significant main effect of the cluster
transition predictor. Post-hoc effects revealed that the improving group had significantly
higher academic GPA compared to the stable group (see Fig 4). All other post-hoc compari-
sons were non-significant for this predictor. In addition we also noted semester 1 cluster

Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first large-scale study to simultaneously integrate the effects of
alcohol and marijuana use on college GPA using a longitudinal statistical model. Given the
challenges presented by comorbid and collinear use of both alcohol and marijuana in college
students, we performed a data-driven categorization of cumulative substance use and then
used a LMM approach to evaluate the longitudinal effects of both alcohol and marijuana use
on individual college GPA in a cohort of 1000+ college students. However, it is important to
note that our study design or analysis was not geared to examine causation. Given the analysis
presented in the paper, all we can infer is that academic performance and substance use was

 significantly associated. Our data-driven analysis revealed that roughly 40% of the students did
not use, or consumed very light amounts of alcohol and MJ. Students who consumed moder-
ate-to-large amounts of alcohol but only small-no MJ comprised another 40%, and the rest of
the sample was heavy users of both substances. We also found almost no individuals with min-
imal alcohol and heavy MJ use. This is interesting given the popular belief that MJ-only users

 are much more common than individuals who use both substances together. However, the
data driven patterns of substance use clusters we found was largely consistent with past
reported data in college students [22].
The substance-use clusters identified across individuals in our study were relatively stable
across semesters. Thus, heavy substance users during freshman year were more likely to main-
tain the same use pattern throughout the 2 study years. As hypothesized, even after controlling
for a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics, cluster 3 students (who were moder-
ate-heavy users of both substances) had poorer grades (from study outset to completion) than
their peers who consumed little or no alcohol/marijuana. Overall, cluster 2 students (moder-
ate-high alcohol + low-or-no marijuana) had lower GPA’s compared to their non/low sub-
stance use peers. However, contrary to our hypothesis we found no cluster by semester
interaction, which suggests that the overall relationship between cluster and GPA is the same
across each semester (as seen in Fig 2). Despite a non-significant interaction term, we looked
at post-hoc simple effects to better interpret the data. These analyses revealed that the differ-
ence in GPA between cluster 1 and 2 diminished to trend-level significance during semester 2
and was non-significant for semesters 3 and 4. One possible explanation is that students con-
suming moderate-to-high levels of alcohol and only low levels or no marijuana (cluster 2),
adapt over time, develop tolerance to substance effects and/or regulate their behavior to even-
tually catch up academically with their sober peers. Alternatively, it is possible that cluster 2
students chose to switch to less academically challenging courses. We were not able to distin-
guish among these possibilities.
The above was however not true for students who heavily used both MJ and alcohol (cluster
3). Despite the fact that cluster 3 students had similar SAT scores of academic achievement
coming into college, compared to cluster 1 and 2, we noted that by the end of semester 1, they
had significantly reduced GPAs. Our results therefore suggest that consuming moderate-to-
high levels of both substances were associated with significantly lower GPA, which seemed to
follow across subsequent semesters (see Fig 2). However, this level of consumption was not
associated with a decline in GPA from semester 1, i.e. when we tracked cluster 3 academic per-
formance over time, there was no significant change in GPA over the two-year period.
Although partly consistent with our initial hypothesis, this particular finding was not entirely
expected, as we had initially predicted that engaging in heavy substance use of both substances
would also result in a faster decline in academic achievement over time (i.e. we would see a sig-
nificant cluster by semester interaction). One simple possibility is that we had too few time
points in the study in later semesters to detect a significant GPA decline over time. Also, larger
attrition of subjects across substance use clusters over time could have resulted in a non-signif-
icant decline of GPA as well. Finally, it could be possible that heavy substance users are able to
tolerate deleterious effects of those substances, due to perhaps a combination of genetic predis-
position and adaptive cellular or systemic tolerance, thus preventing them from a continuing
decline in academic performance. This hypothesis is supported in-part by evidence from both
the animal and human literature. A rodent study demonstrated that exposures to large quanti-
ties of alcohol led to functional tolerance independent of environmental influences [44]. In
humans, a study investigating alcohol tolerance in offspring of alcoholics and non-alcoholics,
found that the former experience alcohol’s pleasurable effects at the start of drinking and are
less affected by its subsequent impairing effects during the drinking session, that in turn might
contribute to increased drinking behaviors [45, 46]. Similar animal-based evidence for toler-
ance effects at both the observational and neuronal levels has been noted for heavy marijuana
use [47]. It is possible that a large number of students belonging to cluster 3 fit the above pat-
tern and were thus able to maintain their grades over time due to adaptive tolerance to heavy
substance use.

 A key strength of the current study is its focus on a critical age group, college-attending
late adolescents to early adults, when substance use and initiation is prevalent. Animal stud-
ies suggest that compared to adults, adolescents may be particularly sensitive and vulnerable
to neurotoxic effects of substances including alcohol and marijuana [48–50]. Preclinical
studies also report increased cellular changes in adolescents compared to adults associated
with exposure to THC (delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol), a major psychoactive compound in
marijuana [48, 49]. Human studies indicate that regular marijuana use starting before age
18 is associated with deficits in attention, visual search, executive functioning and IQ [7, 9,
16–18]. Newer research seems to indicate that persistent cannabis use across four years of
high school is associated with lower GPA, SAT scores and higher externalizing symptoms
[51]. A recently-published large longitudinal cohort study that utilized trajectory analyses,
seems to indicate that students who smoked cannabis (irrespective of use being infrequent,
frequent, increasing or decreasing) during college had significantly lower college GPA and
other related academic outcomes (even at study onset) [52]. Another study used structural
equation modeling to conclude that MJ use during the first semester was directly related to
lower GPA in college students. The study also found similar indirect effects of alcohol and
other substances on academic outcomes such as GPA and graduation time [53]. Our results
both confirm and extend previous reports by suggesting that students who consume moder-
ate-large quantities of both alcohol and marijuana show significantly lowered college aca-
demic performance that is seen consistently over a two-year period. It was also encouraging
to observe that students who in general were able to moderate or lower substance use pat-
terns while in college over time performed significantly better academically compared to
students who remained in the same substance use cluster. Our pseudo-trajectory analysis
might therefore provide important clues in terms of how regulating, curtailing and modify-
ing substance use behavior while in college could have a significant impact on academic
GPA.
Our results suggest that early intervention to substance abuse in college students might be
vital in shaping their academic success over time. Students who use alcohol and MJ (espe-
cially MJ) minimally during their incoming semester seem to do better academically over
time. This might in-turn lead to significantly better life outcomes upon graduation. It was
interesting to note that despite no differences in SAT scores between clusters, we begin to see
a dramatic difference in GPA associated with heavy substance use by the end of the first
semester. First-year students typically have exaggerated ideas about how much college stu-
dents drink. Wanting to fit in and being free of parental control for the first time, these stu-
dents can be led by this misperception into a pattern of heavy drinking that increases their
risk of academic failure, serious injury, sexual assault, and even death. As stated by Moos
et al 1976, “College health and academic counseling services may benefit from knowledge of
individuals at high risk for poor physical health, academic dropout, and alcohol abuse.” This
could translate into identification of heavy student alcohol and substance users through
improved substance use education and readily available counseling programs, with the aim
of reducing substance-associated morbidity. It is typical for freshman students to be sub-
jected to peer pressure of drinking given the somewhat false sense of excessive drinking and
substance use culture in colleges. One way to counteract this would be to roll out social
norms marketing campaigns that try to convey accurate survey data about student drinking
norms. The idea is that once students learn that far fewer students are drinking heavily than
they once thought, they will feel less social pressure to drink and, therefore, moderate their
alcohol use. In addition to enforcing strict rules and disseminating knowledge on alcohol
and substance abuse during social events especially during the freshman year, schools could
also take a more proactive role in creating a substance-free environment by promoting

 alcohol-free events for students and supporting student clubs and organizations that are sub-
stance-free and create and promote service learning and volunteer opportunities that are an
integral part of the academic curriculum.
As mentioned previously mental illness is an important piece of the picture, given that
psychiatric disorders and substance abuse are often co-morbid; we tried to control for these
important factors. However, these measures were only collected at study onset, future stud-
ies might therefore benefit by collecting history of tobacco use, depression and anxiety mea-
sures longitudinally to better account for variability in these potentially important
mediating factors. In the current study however, exploratory analyses performed within the
LMM framework found no interaction between depression or anxiety scores with cluster
definition.
Other strengths of the current study included being among the first to assess simultaneous
longitudinal influences of both alcohol and marijuana on academic performance. Further, we
controlled for a variety of demographic and clinical variables that might otherwise be comor-
bid with substance use. The study also had several limitations. We were not able to detect a
meaningful group of individuals with low alcohol and moderate-high marijuana use, which
would have allowed us to better parse effects of substance use on academic performance.
Unfortunately we did not capture a variety of other interesting mediating factors such as “pre-
college” drinking or marijuana use patterns, high school GPA, skipping classes, course diffi-
culty or degree of college engagement which could have enabled us to draw better inferences.
There was a significant degree of non-reporting of marijuana use in later semesters, in subjects
who volunteered other types of data; we do not have a ready explanation for the specific failure
to report these substance data. However, given that missingness seemed to increase from clus-
ter 1 to cluster 3 in a step-wise manner, one might speculate that participants who frequently
abused substances were less motivated to provide survey data as time progressed. The above
missing data was also significantly different across substance use clusters which could have
possibly impacted our findings.
Conclusions
Overall, our study adds to the growing body of adolescent/early adulthood substance use
literature by showing that combined alcohol and marijuana effects can pose a threat to col-
lege GPA. Although we detected significant differences in academic GPA across different
substance use groups, the association between substance use (clusters) and GPA did not
change over the 2-year follow up period. Students consuming moderate-heavy alcohol and
little-no marijuana seemed to show significantly lower GPA only at study onset. However
the impact on GPA in students who consumed moderate-heavy doses of both alcohol and
marijuana seemed to be more severe as these students had a significantly lowered GPA at
both outset and throughout the 2-year study period, suggesting serious implications
towards academic achievement when both substances are prevalently used while attending
college. Supplementary results also suggest that moderating or curtailing substance use
while in college might help improving academic GPA.
