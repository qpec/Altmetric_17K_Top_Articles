BACKGROUND: States routinely may consider rollbacks of Medicaid expansions to address statewide economic conditions. To the
authors’ knowledge, little is known regarding the effects of public insurance contractions on health outcomes. The current study
examined the effects of the 2005 Medicaid disenrollment in Tennessee on breast cancer stage at the time of diagnosis and delays in
treatment among nonelderly women. METHODS: The authors used Tennessee Cancer Registry data from 2002 through 2008 and
estimated a difference-in-difference model comparing women diagnosed with breast cancer who lived in low-income zip codes (and
therefore were more likely to be subject to disenrollment) with a similar group of women who lived in high-income zip codes before
and after the 2005 Medicaid disenrollment. The study outcomes were changes in stage of disease at the time of diagnosis and delays
in treatment of >60 days and >90 days. RESULTS: Overall, nonelderly women in Tennessee were diagnosed at later stages of disease
and experienced more delays in treatment in the period after disenrollment. Disenrollment was found to be associated with a 3.3-per-
centage point increase in late stage of disease at the time of diagnosis (P 5 .024), a 1.9-percentage point decrease in having a delay
of >60 days in surgery (P 5 .024), and a 1.4-percentage point decrease in having a delay of >90 days in treatment (P 5 .054) for
women living in low-income zip codes compared with women residing in high-income zip codes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
the current study indicate that Medicaid disenrollment is associated with a later stage of disease at the time of breast cancer
diagnosis, thereby providing evidence of the potential negative health impacts of Medicaid contractions. Cancer 2017;123:3312-9. V

INTRODUCTION
In 2005, Tennessee’s Medicaid program faced financial difficulties and terminated coverage for nonelderly adults who
failed to meet traditional requirements for Medicaid coverage. To the best of our knowledge, the change was the largest
disenrollment in the history of Medicaid and terminated coverage for nearly 170,000 enrollees, or approximately 4% of
the state’s nonelderly adults.1,2 Disenrollment left these patients without health insurance coverage that enables access to
health care services, including breast cancer screening and treatment.
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women, and an estimated 12% of women in the
United States will develop breast cancer during their lifetime.3 The 5-year relative survival rate for patients with localized
breast cancer is 98.5%, compared with 25% for those with distant stage disease.4 Likewise, waiting �60 days to initiate
treatment is associated with a significant increase in both overall and breast cancer-related mortality rates by 66% and
85%, respectively.5 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women aged 50 to 74 years receive a mam-
mogram every 2 years.6 The American Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for women aged 45 to 54 years
and biennial mammograms (or optional every-year mammograms) for women aged �55 years without restricting the
screening to an upper age limit.7
Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested that health insurance coverage is associated with earlier diagnosis and
improved health outcomes among women diagnosed with breast cancer.8-10 Furthermore, studies concerning Medicaid
disenrollment in different states found that termination of coverage was high among vulnerable populations, and that loss
of coverage increased the use of emergency departments and discontinuity of care.11-13 In a study of a single Tennessee
county, emergency room visits by uninsured individuals increased by 18 percentage points.14 To our knowledge, the

 broader statewide effects of disenrollment are unknown.
Relatedly, recent studies have found that expansions in
insurance coverage reduce overall mortality, although
there is less evidence regarding the underlying mecha-
nisms.15 The impact of loss of Medicaid coverage in Ten-
nessee on health care outcomes and on cancer-related
outcomes such as diagnosis and treatment in particular
remains unanswered.
In the current study, we provide evidence of the
impact of Medicaid disenrollment on timely breast cancer
diagnosis and treatment by examining the impact of the
2005 Tennessee Medicaid disenrollment on delays in
breast cancer staging, delays in surgery (when surgery was
the first line of treatment), and delays in treatment (when
nonsurgical therapy was the first line of treatment). To
examine the association between disenrollment and breast
cancer diagnosis and treatment, a difference-in-difference
estimation approach was used.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The main data source was the Tennessee Cancer Registry
(TCR), a population-based cancer registry that collects
information regarding Tennessee residents with cancer.16
The TCR collects comprehensive and timely data from all
hospitals, laboratories, facilities, and health care practi-
tioners in the state. The data include information regard-
ing cancer incidence, stage of disease, treatment, and vital
status. TCR data have met national standards for data
completeness and quality since 2004, but did not consis-
tently record and report metastasis and lymph node
involvement until 2004. Nevertheless, the information
regarding stage of disease at the time of diagnosis was
complete throughout the study period.
We merged TCR data with zip code median income
data (2006-2011 release) from the Population Studies
Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,17 and
restricted the study sample to women aged 21 to 64 years
who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2002 and
2008. We analyzed the 3 years before (2002-2004) and
the 3 years after (2006-2008) Medicaid disenrollment.
The analytic sample for stage at diagnosis consisted of
19,100 nonelderly women who had complete data and
were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2002 and
2008 (excluding 2005).
To estimate surgical and treatment delay, we
selected 15,590 women who underwent surgery as their
first line of treatment (surgery only or surgery followed by
adjuvant treatment) and 3510 women who received
neoadjuvant therapy as their first line of treatment. We
excluded 366 women who were diagnosed at a distant
stage of disease because these patients may not undergo
surgery. We also excluded women who had a date of sur-
gery that was the same as their date of diagnosis (1690
women), leaving 13,534 women for the analysis of surgi-
cal delay.
Dependent Variables
Our main dependent variable was stage of disease at the
time of diagnosis, but we estimated delays in surgery and
treatment to examine patterns of change in these variables
before and after the disenrollment. To define stage of dis-
ease at diagnosis, we recoded the Surveillance, Epidemiol-
ogy, and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage into a
binary variable that equals 1 for late diagnoses (regional or
distant) and 0 for in situ or localized stage of disease at
diagnosis. For delays in surgery and treatment, we created
2 binary variables; the first indicated a delay >60 days
from the date of diagnosis and the second indicated a
delay >90 days from the date of diagnosis. The date of
the most definitive surgery was missing for many observa-
tions. Therefore, we primarily used the date of surgery of
the primary tumor site to construct the variable regarding
delay in surgery outcome. However, we used the date of
most definitive surgery instead of the date of surgery in sit-
uations in which the date of surgery was the same as the
date of diagnosis (because it could be a diagnostic biopsy
performed at the time of diagnosis) (2215 women), when
surgery was a resection (23 women), and when the date of
the most definitive surgery was before the date of surgery
of the primary tumor site (because the second surgery is
likely the most definitive) (18 women).
The Institutional Review Boards of both Virginia
Commonwealth University and the Tennessee Depart-
ment of Health approved the current study.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated difference-in-difference models for the out-
comes of interest (stage of disease at the time of diagnosis,
delay in surgery, and delay in treatment). The difference-
in-difference models compare changes in outcomes for
women living in low-income zip codes (who therefore are
more likely to be disenrolled) with changes for women liv-
ing in high-income zip codes before and after Tennessee’s
2005 Medicaid disenrollment. We defined low-income
zip codes as those with a median income of �$38,700 in
2005 (equivalent to 200% of the federal poverty level
[FPL] for a family of 4) and high-income zip codes as
those with a median income of >$38,700 in 2005. We

 controlled for age at diagnosis, race, ethnicity, marital sta-
tus, and number of comorbidities. We estimated linear
probability models for ease of interpretation.18
We constructed another control group from the
publicly available SEER database of women diagnosed
with breast cancer outside of Tennessee.19
Sensitivity Analysis
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we
defined high-income zip codes as those with a median
income �$48,375 (equivalent to 250% of the FPL) and
kept the definition of low-income zip codes as �200% of
the FPL. This comparison excluded women who may be
eligible for Medicaid but resided in middle-income zip
codes. Second, we used data regarding the primary insur-
ance carrier that were available from the registry. We cate-
gorized uninsured women and those covered by Medicaid
into 1 group (as a proxy for low-income zip codes) and
other insurance carriers into another group. Third, we
conducted analyses including observations for patients
with localized or regional stages of disease who had the
same date for both diagnosis and surgery. Third, we used
a sample of women aged 40 to 64 years, a group that was
eligible for regular mammography screening during the
study period.
RESULTS
Table 1 reports sample characteristics by disenrollment
and median income of the patients’ zip codes. The average
age of women in the sample was 51 years, and >60% of
the women were aged 50 to 64 years. The majority of
women in the sample were white, married, and insured.
In the period before Tennessee’s Medicaid disenrollment,
approximately 20% of women in both low-income and
high-income zip codes reported having at least 1 comor-
bid condition. After the policy change, approximately
36% reported having �1 comorbid conditions. Before
disenrollment, 15.9% of women in the sample lived in

 low-income zip codes compared with 18.3% after disen-
rollment. The percentage of cases diagnosed at a late stage
of disease (regional or distant stage) increased in both low-
income and high-income zip codes in the period after dis-
enrollment (35.4% to 40.2% vs 34.6% to 36.2%).
Among women living in low-income zip codes in the
period before disenrollment, a significantly higher per-
centage of individuals were found to have delays of >60
days in surgery (difference, 1.8; P<.001) and treatment
(difference, 0.9; P 5 .03) compared with women living in
high-income zip codes. Although women living in both
low-income and high-income zip codes had higher rates
of delays in surgery and treatment after disenrollment, the
change in rates of delays for women living in high-income
zip codes was greater. For example, for women living in
low-income zip codes, the rate for a delay in surgery of
>60 days increased significantly from 12% in the period
before disenrollment to 14.3% in the period after disen-
rollment (P 5 .005). Among women residing in high-
income zip codes, the rate for a delay of >60 days in sur-
gery increased from 10.2% in the period before disenroll-
ment to 14.4% in the period after disenrollment
(P<.001).
Table 2 reports the results from the difference-in-
difference models from within Tennessee for all outcome
variables. Tennessee’s Medicaid disenrollment was found to
be associated with a 3.3-percentage point increase in late-
stage diagnoses (P 5 .02) for women living in low-income
zip codes compared with changes among women living in
high-income zip codes. This change represents a 12.7%
increase in the probability of a late stage of disease at the
time of diagnosis compared with the predisenrollment base-
line in Tennessee. Furthermore, Tennessee’s Medicaid dis-
enrollment was associated with a 1.9-percentage point
decrease in having a delay of >60 days in surgery (P 5
.02), and a 1.4-percentage point decrease in having a delay
of >90 days in treatment (P 5 .05) for women living in
low-income zip codes compared with changes among
women living in high-income zip codes. All the women in
the sample had statistically significant or marginally signifi-
cant increases in delays in surgery and treatment (except for
a delay of >90 days in treatment) after disenrollment.
Table 3 reports the difference-in-difference results
when we use the SEER control group. Tennessee’s Medic-
aid disenrollment was associated with a 3.8-percentage
point increase in late-stage diagnosis (P<.001) for women

 living in Tennessee compared with changes among
women living in SEER states.
Sensitivity Analysis
Table 4 reports the results of the first sensitivity analysis.
Regression analyses using women residing in higher-
income zip codes as a comparison group demonstrated a
similar association between Tennessee’s Medicaid disen-
rollment and the outcomes (a 3.4-percentage point
increase in diagnosis at a late stage of disease [P 5 .04], a
1.9-percentage point decrease in having a delay >60 days
in surgery [P 5 .04], and a 1.5-percentage point decrease
in having a delay >90 days in treatment [P 5 .09]).
When we used information regarding insurance type
instead of zip code income level to identify those
women most likely to be affected by the Medicaid disen-
rollment, the results increased in magnitude and remained
statistically significant (a 4.6-percentage point increase in
diagnosis at a late stage of disease [P 5 .03], a 3.1-percent-
age point decrease in having a delay >60 days in surgery [P
5 .02], and a 2.9-percentage point decrease in having a
delay >60 days in treatment [P 5 .05]). The changes were
slightly smaller when we included women with localized or
regional stage of disease at the time of diagnosis who had
the same date for both diagnosis and surgery from the sur-
gery sample. A delay of >60 days in surgery decreased by
0.4% (compared with 1.9% in the primary analysis) and
remained statistically significant (P 5 .04). When we used
a sample of women aged 40 to 64 years, the estimate of the
impact of disenrollment on stage of disease at the time of
diagnosis slightly decreased and remained statistically sig-
nificant (3.0 percentage points; P 5 .02).
DISCUSSION
We examined the effect of Tennessee’s 2005 Medicaid
disenrollment on breast cancer stage at the time of diag-
nosis. We also considered the effect of disenrollment on
mechanisms such as delays in surgery and treatment
that may be associated with mortality. Previous research
has found that Medicaid expansion is associated with a
reduction in mortality but to our knowledge these stud-
ies did not examine specific mechanisms.15 In the cur-
rent study, Tennessee’s Medicaid disenrollment was
found to be associated with a worsening in the stage of
breast cancer at the time of diagnosis, but there was less
delay in surgery or treatment for women living in low-
income zip codes. Furthermore, we found that women
living in Tennessee were more likely to be diagnosed

Abbreviation: FPL, federal poverty level.
a Each column represents a separate regression analysis.
b An interaction term of “Low-income” and “Post”. The coefficient represents the change in outcome for women living in low-income zip codes compared with
those living in high-income zip codes after disenrollment.
c Low-income is defined as women living within zip codes with a median income $38,700 (200% of the federal poverty level); high-income indicates everyone else.
d “Post” indicates after disenrollment (2006-2008).

 with breast cancer at a later stage after the disenrollment
compared with women living in the SEER states. The
findings regarding stage of disease at the time of diagno-
sis were the most robust and in the expected direction.
Women living in low-income zip codes were found to
have the largest increase in late stage of disease at the
time of diagnosis after the disenrollment, which limited
insurance coverage that would allow for timely access to
health care services such as mammography screening.
Although the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early
Detection Program in Tennessee provided free mammo-
grams to uninsured and underinsured women who had
income below 250% of the FPL, the program, like simi-
lar programs across the country, could only reach on
average approximately 20% of eligible women.20,21
Hence, many uninsured women were unable to receive
regular mammograms.
The sample in the current study was restricted to
women aged 21 to 64 years and may not be consistent
with national trends that include women of all ages.22 We
reported an increase in regional stage disease at the time of
diagnosis whereas national trends show this rate decreas-
ing.22 Nevertheless, the rates in the sample are consistent
with trends noted in Tennessee.23,24
The descriptive results of the current study demon-
strate that women living in both low-income and high-
income zip codes were more likely to be diagnosed at a late
stage of disease and had increased delays in receipt of surgery
and treatment after the disenrollment. Women living in
high-income zip codes were found to be less likely to experi-
ence delays in the period before disenrollment compared
with women living in low-income zip codes, and yet women
living in high-income zip codes experienced a larger increase
in delays in the period after disenrollment. These results are
consistent with results from previous research that found
that women residing within the highest income quintiles
were 1.5 times more likely to experience a delay between the
time of diagnosis of breast cancer and surgery than women
living in the lowest income quintiles.25
There are several potential explanations for the find-
ings of the current study regarding late stage of disease at
the time of diagnosis and fewer delays in receipt of surgery
and treatment for low-income women. First, the diagnosis
of cancer depends on regular access to preventive services
offered by a primary care provider, not an oncologist or a
surgeon. Low-income women who were disenrolled from
Medicaid coverage were likely to lose access to preventive
services such as mammography screening, which is an
important tool for the detection of breast cancer at early
stages. Furthermore, these women may be more likely to
lose their usual source of care, which will likely decrease
their opportunities to seek timely medical care if they
develop symptoms. Once uninsured low-income women
are diagnosed with breast cancer, they can be covered by
Medicaid through the Breast and Cervical Cancer Preven-
tion and Treatment Act of 2000 and initiate treatment as
indicated by their surgeons and oncologists.26 However,
Medicaid coverage after diagnosis is not as beneficial as
continuous insurance coverage beginning before diagno-
sis. A previous study highlighted the importance of Med-
icaid coverage before diagnosis, finding that uninsured
women were twice as likely to be diagnosed with late-stage
breast cancer compared with women who were insured by
Medicaid in the same month of diagnosis.27
Second, women living in high-income zip codes are
assumed to have private insurance and thus be less
affected by the disenrollment. Because these women are
more likely to have access to preventive services, they are
more likely to undergo regular mammography screenings.
Once high-income women are diagnosed with breast can-
cer, those with private insurance may require extra time
to schedule appointments and begin treatment because
they may choose to undergo simultaneous breast recon-
struction, performed by both the general surgeon and
plastic surgeon. National trends of undergoing recon-
struction along with mastectomy increased significantly
from 11.6% in 1998 to 36.4% in 2011.28 In addition,
high-income women may seek a second opinion from
other oncologists. Previous research has found that
higher-income women are more likely to receive a second
opinion and patient education materials, representing
options that could lengthen the time to treatment.29
The current study has limitations. First, the results
may not be generalizable to other states. Second, data
quality varied. The TCR met the national gold standards
for data completeness and quality for the period between
2005 and 2008, but met silver standards in 2004. How-
ever, stage of disease at the time of diagnosis was complete
for all observations in the study sample. Third, we did not
have information regarding individual Medicaid enroll-
ment; disenrollment; income; or risk factors such as smok-
ing, alcohol consumption, and obesity, which can affect
cancer stage or receipt of treatment. We addressed this
limitation to the extent possible through multiple analyses
(within Tennessee and compared with SEER states) to
establish the robustness of the results. In addition, we
used residence within a zip code with a low median
income as a proxy for income and Medicaid eligibility.
We were unable to control for metastasis or lymph node
involvement in our analyses because these variables were

 missing in data from 2002 and 2003. Finally, although
we focused on the timing of the 2005 Medicaid disenroll-
ment in the current analysis, other macroeconomic condi-
tions (eg, economic recession, unemployment rates) may
be associated with delays in diagnosis.
The findings of the current study may have impor-
tant public health and policy implications for states con-
sidering potential rollbacks of Medicaid expansions
implemented under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act. The 2005 Medicaid disenrollment in Tennessee
provides several lessons concerning access to and use of
preventive care services and subsequent delays in the diag-
nosis and treatment of breast cancer, which has a better
prognosis when diagnosed early. Contractions in the
availability of Medicaid coverage have important health
consequences for low-income women, and may increase
income-related disparities, morbidity, and mortality for
those diagnosed with breast cancer. These negative health
consequences should be considered by policymakers who
weigh the costs and benefits of implementing or discon-
tinuing expanded Medicaid coverage under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act and future federal
and state policies.
