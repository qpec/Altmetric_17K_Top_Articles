Abstract
Current treatment options for depression are limited by efficacy, cost, availability, side
effects, and acceptability to patients. Several studies have looked at the association
between magnesium and depression, yet its role in symptom management is unclear. The
objective of this trial was to test whether supplementation with over-the-counter magnesium
chloride improves symptoms of depression. An open-label, blocked, randomized, cross-
over trial was carried out in outpatient primary care clinics on 126 adults (mean age 52; 38%
male) diagnosed with and currently experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms with Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores of 5–19. The intervention was 6 weeks of active
treatment (248 mg of elemental magnesium per day) compared to 6 weeks of control (no
treatment). Assessments of depression symptoms were completed at bi-weekly phone
calls. The primary outcome was the net difference in the change in depression symptoms
from baseline to the end of each treatment period. Secondary outcomes included changes
in anxiety symptoms as well as adherence to the supplement regimen, appearance of
adverse effects, and intention to use magnesium supplements in the future. Between June
2015 and May 2016, 112 participants provided analyzable data. Consumption of magne-
sium chloride for 6 weeks resulted in a clinically significant net improvement in PHQ-9
scores of -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P<0.001) and net improvement in Generalized Anxiety
Disorders-7 scores of -4.5 points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P<0.001). Average adherence was 83% by
pill count. The supplements were well tolerated and 61% of participants reported they would
use magnesium in the future. Similar effects were observed regardless of age, gender,
baseline severity of depression, baseline magnesium level, or use of antidepressant treat-
ments. Effects were observed within two weeks. Magnesium is effective for mild-to-moder-
ate depression in adults. It works quickly and is well tolerated without the need for close
monitoring for toxicity.

 Introduction
Depression affects 350 million people worldwide and is predicted to be the leading cause of
disease burden by 2030, based on disability-adjusted-life-year [1]. Initial antidepressant trials
of adequate dose and duration result in only about 50% of patients achieving remission [2].
Even after the addition of other treatments, 20% still suffer from symptoms after 2 years. Non-
pharmacologic approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and lifestyle interventions
require highly trained therapists and several weeks to months to achieve effectiveness [3].
There is a great need for additional treatment options.
The association between magnesium intake and depression is well documented [4–7].
Improvement in depression with magnesium supplementation has been reported inconsis-
tently [8, 9], although few clinical trials exist. One trial found magnesium chloride to be effec-
tive for depression in seniors with type 2 diabetes [10] while another trial found magnesium
citrate decreased depression in patients with fibromyalgia [11]. One negative trial used magne-
sium oxide [12], known to be poorly absorbed.
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 6 weeks of oral magnesium chloride
(MgCl2) supplementation will improve symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression in a pri-
mary care population.
Methods
Trial design
This was a 12-week open label randomized cross-over control trial. Participants were
recruited through primary care providers (PCPs) within a single academic medical center
and randomized to begin MgCl2 supplementation immediately or at week 7 (delayed).
During the other 6-week period, they took no MgCl2. Prior to the start of the study the Insti-
tutional Review Board of the University of Vermont approved the study. All subjects pro-
vided written informed consent. Trial registry can be found at clinicatrials.gov (Identifier:
02466087).
Participants
The target population was adults with mild-to-moderate depression. Inclusion criteria were:
1) 18 years of age or older; 2) no change in treatment plan for depression for the past 2
months and going forward (including no current treatment, stable use of antidepressant
medication, or ongoing nonpharmacologic therapy); 3) Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9) score of 5–19 [13]. Exclusion criteria were: 1) Schizophrenia, bipolar disease, active
delirium, dementia, kidney disease (due to the role of the kidneys in magnesium homeosta-
sis), myasthenia gravis (magnesium may worsen symptoms of the disease), or gastrointestinal
(GI) disease (diarrhea is a common side effect of magnesium); 2) pregnant or trying to get
pregnant; 3) planned surgery in the next 3 months; 5) taking a medication known to interact
with magnesium; 6) unwilling to stop taking non-study magnesium supplements for the
duration of the study.
Magnesium supplements
Tablets of MgCl2 (Alta Health Products, Idaho City, ID) were provided free of charge. Partici-
pants were instructed to take four 500 mg tablets of magnesium chloride daily for a total of 248
mg of elemental magnesium per day. MgCl2 was used because of its high bioavailability and
tolerability compared to other salts [14, 15].

 Study procedures and randomization
PCPs reviewed lists of their patients with a diagnosis of depression in their medical record
and indicated which ones may be sent a letter describing the study. PCPs were encouraged to
remove patients from their list if they knew depression was no longer an active problem, the
patient was also suffering from severe mental illness, or the patient was not able to start or stop
taking magnesium. Those patients that did not opt out after receiving the letter were contacted
by phone to determine interest and eligibility. Eligibility and diagnosis of depression was con-
firmed with an initial telephone PHQ-9 score between 5 and 19. Participants next met with
study staff for a baseline visit during which they provided written informed consent and base-
line data including demographics, medication use, the PHQ-9 [13], the Generalized Anxiety
Disorders-7 (GAD-7) [16], the Modified Morisky Scale [17] to assess medication adherence
behavior, the PhenX Tobacco Smoking Status Questionnaire for Adults, and the PhenX Alco-
hol 30 Day Quantity and Frequency Questionnaire [18]. Randomization to Immediate and
Delayed treatment was stratified based on PHQ-9 score (5–9, 10–14, and 15–19) and blocked
in groups of 10. Treatment assignments were sealed in an opaque envelope and shuffled and
then numbered and opened in that order. The principal investigator (PI) assigned the partici-
pants to their randomization order. The PI also gave the volunteers the supplements at either
week 1 or week 7, based on randomization, and educated each participant on the dosage and
possible side effects. Data were collected every 2 weeks via telephone and included the PHQ-9,
GAD-7, questions about changes in medications, changes in treatment for depression, and
side effects.
Outcome measures
The primary hypothesis was that magnesium supplementation decreases symptoms of depres-
sion and therefore the primary outcome was the difference in the change in PHQ-9 scores
between baseline and the end of each six-week period (difference in differences). The PHQ-9
is a validated questionnaire with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of depression
[13]. The PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27, with the following severity scores: 0–4 None;
5–9 Mild; 10–14 Moderate; 15–19 Moderate to Severe; 20–27 Severe. Telephone administra-
tion is comparable to in-person tracking [19].
Secondary outcomes were exploratory and included changes in the GAD-7 score as well as
adherence to the supplement regimen and intention to use magnesium supplements in the
future. GAD-7 score was recorded in the same fashion as the PHQ-9 and has been shown to be
a valid indication of anxiety symptoms [16]. The GAD-7 score can range from 0 to 21, with
the following severity scores: 0–4 None; 5–9 Mild; 10–14 Moderate; 15–21 Severe. To assess
side effects, participants were asked to compare symptoms (headache, diarrhea, nausea, consti-
pation, dizziness, oliguria, and polyuria) to baseline using a standardized 0–4 point scale
(none, mild, moderate, or severe). At the end of week 12, a pill count was used to calculate
adherence to the supplement regimen and participants were asked whether they planned to
continue using magnesium and why.
Data analysis
All data were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle. The age and gender of patients
who were contacted but ineligible were compared to those who were randomized. Baseline char-
acteristics of eligible participants were compared by randomization group. Student t-tests or Wil-
coxon Rank Sum tests were used for continuous values and Chi-square tests for categorical values.
The change in outcome for each patient was calculated as the last value measured during
that treatment arm minus the last value measured before that treatment arm. Before crossing

 over, this was the week 6 measure minus the baseline measure. After cross-over, this was the
week 12 measure minus the week 6 measure. If a week 12 measure was not available, the week
10 or week 8 measure was used. Participants who did not provide at least one outcome mea-
sure in each treatment period were excluded. Treatment efficacy was assessed as the net
improvement in outcome. The mean change in the outcomes during the 6 weeks of the control
(no treatment) period was compared to the change in scores during the 6 weeks of treatment.
Linear regression was used to test the significance in the net improvement in the outcome
while controlling for potential confounders.
Each potential confounder was tested in a separate univariate linear regression for associa-
tion (P<0.05) with the primary outcome and secondary outcome. Potential confounders were
included in multivariate models. We explored the effectiveness of treatment among various
subgroups using multivariate models. Linear regression adjusting for randomization and clus-
tering was used to identify adverse effects. Cuzick’s test of trend [20] was used to explore the
relationships between both the Modified Morisky score and treatment response with adher-
ence. A two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were completed
using Stata14�1 (College Station, TX).
The targeted sample size was based on detection of a difference in difference in PHQ-9
scores of 1.5, which was felt to be clinically significant. The calculation, assuming a paired t-
test, with 84% power, type I error rate of 5%, and a standard deviation of 5 [21], resulted in a
sample size of 50 participants in each group.
Results
Recruitment occurred between June 2015 and May 2016. Of 1,930 patients identified from
medical records, 1,340 (68%) were contacted and 126 (7%) were eligible and randomized (Fig
1). The mean age of the contacted patients was 50 years compared to a mean age of 52 years in
the randomized group (P = 0.06). The randomized group had fewer males than the other con-
tacted patients (38% vs.47%; P = 0.07).
Sixty-two participants (49%) were randomized to Immediate Treatment and 64 (51%) to
Delayed Treatment (P = 0.95). The two groups were similar in all baseline characteristics
except age. The mean age in the Immediate group was 55.6 versus 49.1 in the Delayed group
(P = 0.006). All participants commenced treatment based on allocation. Seven participants
withdrew from each group before crossing over (11%) (Fig 1). The most common reason was
a change in other depression treatment (n = 7) (Table 1). No participants withdrew due to
non-compliance. 108 participants completed all 12 weeks of the study. Four withdrew between
week 8 and 12; their last results recorded before withdrawal were included in the final sample,
resulting in 112 participants analyzed (Fig 1). The characteristics of the final analyzed sample
appear in Table 2. The Immediate group was similar to the Delayed group except that they
were 5.1 years older (P = 0.04).
The characteristics of the 14 subjects who withdrew before crossing over were similar in all
measured characteristics to the 112 in the final sample except that they were more anxious
(GAD-7 12.5 vs. 8.6; P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in age, gender, race,
smoking, alcohol consumption, baseline PHQ-9 score, Modified Morisky score, or use of
depression therapies at the time of randomization.
Outcomes
Unadjusted PHQ-9 depression scores improved during magnesium treatment (-4.3 points;
95% confidence interval (CI) -5.0, -3.6), but not during the control period (-0.1; CI -0.9, +0.7)
for the final analyzable cohort of 112 adults. The net improvement was -4.2 points (CI -5.4,

 -2.9; P<0.001). Participants who were randomized to Immediate Treatment first experienced
a decrease in PHQ-9 score within 2 weeks; their scores increased slightly towards baseline dur-
ing the 6 weeks of control (Fig 2). Those in the Delayed Treatment group experienced a slight
improvement in PHQ-9 score during the control weeks and a further improvement during the
active treatment.
Age, gender, race, smoking status, drinks of alcohol per week, adherence to the supple-
ment regimen, and other treatments for depression were not associated with response to treat-
ment and were not included in the adjusted model. Mean PHQ-9 change during the control
weeks, randomization order, and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) were
retained in the multivariate analyses. When adjusted for these potential confounders, the net

 improvement with supplementation was -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P<0.001). See Table 3. Data
for all participants (N = 126) follow a similar pattern (Table 4).
Unadjusted GAD-7 anxiety scores improved during magnesium supplementation (-3.9
points; CI -4.7, -3.1), but worsened during the control period (+0.8; CI +0.02, +1.6) for a net
benefit of -4�7 points (CI -6.0, -3.3; P<0.001) (Fig 3). After adjustment for potential confound-
ers (Table 3), the net improvement in anxiety with magnesium supplementation was -4.5
points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P<0.001). Again, the data are similar for all participants as well (Table 4).
Subgroup analyses were performed using the adjusted models of the association of magne-
sium with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Subgroups were defined by gender, age above or below
55, PHQ above or below 9, GAD above or below 9, use of any antidepressant medications, use
of specific medications (SSRIs, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, bupropion,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antipsychotics), use of behavioral therapy or counseling, and
adherence above or below 80% by pill count. The analyses indicated that magnesium was effec-
tive in all subgroups (Table 3).
Participants were less likely to report headaches while taking magnesium compared to the
control period (unadjusted mean headache score 0.41 vs. 0.57 on the 0–3 scale). The adjusted
difference was -0.16 (CI -0.25, -0.03; P = 0.013). There was no difference in the reporting of
diarrhea, constipation, nausea, dizziness or urinary symptoms (Table 5).
Using the adjusted model, we explored the effect of magnesium supplementation on
the answers to individual PHQ-9 and GAD-7 items. All items in the PHQ-9 improved

 significantly during active treatment except question 8 (abnormal movement speed) and ques-
tion 9 (thoughts of suicide). Of note, question 9 was positive on only 3 of 892 occasions. The
only GAD-7 questions that did not improve significantly were questions 1 (feeling nervous,
anxious, or on edge) and 5 (experiencing restlessness).
Percent adherence in the Immediate Treatment group (83%) and Delayed Treatment group
(82%) were similar (P = 0�85). Treatment response for both the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tended to
be greater with increased adherence; however, the trend was not significant for either at
P = 0.19 and P = 0.64, respectively.
When asked whether they would take magnesium in the future, 68 (61%) answered yes, 22
(20%) answered maybe and 22 (20%) answered no. The most common reasons for a positive
answer were “the magnesium helped my mood” (58%) and “it helped in other ways” (23%),
such as by increasing energy, decreasing constipation, and decreasing muscle aches and
cramps. The most common reason for a negative response was that “magnesium did not help
mood” (46%), followed by side effects (20%). The most common side effect, diarrhea, was
reported by 8 participants.
Discussion
This trial was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of over-the-counter magnesium and to
determine its role in the treatment of depression. Consumption of 248 mg of elemental MgCl2
daily for 6 weeks improved depression scores by a statistically and clinically significant mean
of 6 points and anxiety by over 4 points. This effect was not due to natural history, regression
to the mean, or confounding, and was seen in a wide range of patients with varying ages, co-
treatments, and severity of baseline symptoms. The similar effects seen in the univariate and
multivariate models indicates that the potential confounders had little impact on the estimates
of treatment effect.

 As with other studies, [8, 11, 22] the improvement in symptoms was seen within weeks.
The effect was somewhat diminished within 2 weeks of stopping supplementation, indicating
relatively quick clearance as well. Although females are more likely to be diagnosed with
depression [23], there was no difference in effect based on gender. The finding that high and
low adherence subgroups had similar improvement suggests that a smaller dose may suffice
with less risk for side effects and lower cost.
Adverse effects were not so severe as to lead to discontinuation except in one case in which
nausea and lethargy led to withdrawal after two weeks. Participants did report experiencing
other clinically significant, and well documented, positive effects of taking magnesium, such as
decreases in headaches and muscle cramps [24]. The fact that nearly all specific PHQ-9 and
GAD-7 items improved significantly while on treatment corresponds with the qualitative
reports.
Although the association between magnesium and depression is well documented, the
mechanism is unknown. However, magnesium plays a role in many of the pathways, enzymes,
hormones, and neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation [25]. It is a calcium antagonist
and voltage-dependent blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel which regulates the flow
of calcium into the neuron [26]. In low magnesium states, high levels of calcium and glutamate
may deregulate synaptic function, resulting in depression [9]. Depression and magnesium are
also both associated with systemic inflammation [27, 28]. The finding that those participants
taking an SSRI experienced an even greater positive effect points toward magnesium’s possible
role in augmenting the effect of antidepressants. Since the mechanism of magnesium’s role in

 depression is still not clear, it is difficult to say why this relationship with antidepressants may
exist. In a sample of treatment resistant depressed patients with normal magnesium levels,
those with high normal magnesium levels had a more robust response to antidepressants [29].
In another study, severity of depression correlated with reduced intracellular magnesium, and
that cellular levels normalized after successful treatment with antidepressants [30]. Patients
may have normal plasma concentration of magnesium yet have depleted intracellular stores

 [31]. There may also be differential effects for SSRIs compared to other antidepressants. Some
evidence to support adjunctive use of other nutraceuticals with antidepressants exists. The mech-
anism may be related to their anti-inflammatory properties or role in NMDA and glutamate
activity [32]. Magnesium supplementation may allow for lower antidepressant dosage or avoid
the need for use of a second medication, both of which could reduce overall side effect burden.
Implications for practice
The net improvement in PHQ-9 score of 6 points is statistically and clinically significant. A
change in score of 5 or greater reflects a clinically relevant change in individuals receiving
depression treatment. After 6 weeks of psychological counseling, a drop in 5 points from base-
line PHQ-9 indicates the treatment response is adequate and no treatment change is needed.
The same guidelines can be applied to 4 weeks of an adequate dose of an antidepressant.[33]
Magnesium supplementation provides a safe, fast and inexpensive approach to controlling
depressive symptoms. Most patients who experience improvement do so within two weeks of
starting supplements. Oral magnesium supplementation is safe in adults with normal kidney
function who are not taking medications that interact with the supplement and when used in
dosages below the upper tolerable limit set by the Institute of Medicine (350 mg elemental
magnesium per day) [34]. Hypermagnesemia is most commonly associated with the combina-
tion of impaired renal function and excessive intake of nonfood magnesium; few serious
adverse effects are reported until very high doses are ingested [34].
Similar to national surveys [35], some participants with depression were not on any treat-
ment. There are many barriers to treatment for depression including stigma associated with
diagnosis, cost, side effects, non-adherence, and loss to follow-up [36]. Magnesium supple-
ments do not come with the added stigma associated with other therapies and, while monitor-
ing response is still important, the risk of side effects is not as great as from antidepressants.
Over-the-counter magnesium can be offered as an alternative therapy to those patients hesi-
tant to begin antidepressant treatment and is easily accessible without a prescription for
around $14.00 per month.
Strengths
This is the first clinical trial done on magnesium for depression in the U.S. Exclusion criteria
were minimal, increasing generalizability, and it used a well-absorbed form of magnesium. The
paired analysis allowed each subject to serve as his or her own control, minimizing variance and
improving statistical power. Random assignment of treatment order allowed for controlling for
regression to the mean as an explanation for the apparent treatment effects. Enrolling patients
over a full year minimized the effects of seasonal changes in depression. The withdrawal rate
was low and adherence was high, confirming patient reports of high acceptability.
Limitations
There was no placebo arm and randomization was not blinded for either the study team or the
volunteer. The use of placebo and blinding are essential for a study that seeks to understand
the mechanism of action of an intervention. However, they are not useful when the research
seeks to assess the presence and magnitude of the effect of an intervention. Whether magne-
sium works because it induces a physiological change in the subject, or only because of the pla-
cebo effect (or a combination of the two), it remains that subjects do report better levels of
depression and anxiety when taking magnesium than when not.
Enrolling patients with depression listed on their medical chart resulted in missing people
with undiagnosed depression or who do not use Primary Care. PCPs may have introduced

 selection bias by differentially disapproving patients they thought were unlikely to be open to
alternative treatments. This may not be an important limitation to generalizability since nutra-
ceuticals would probably not be recommended for these patients anyway. The low response
rate to our letter of invitation and follow up calls may have also introduced selection bias.
The study excluded subjects with malabsorption because the main known side effect of
magnesium is diarrhea. However, because diarrhea was rare in the study, it would be worth
determining the tolerance and effect in those with GI disease. Some of the subgroups are
small, limiting our ability to detect variation in efficacy, although none was seen. Due to the
makeup of the local community, the study population lacked racial diversity.
Although improvement in symptoms occurred within two weeks and was maintained while
on treatment, long-term effectiveness is unknown and longer trials are needed.
Measurement of serum magnesium was outside the scope of the study. A recent meta-anal-
ysis of observational studies found an overall 1.3-fold increased risk of depression in people
with hypomagnesaemia [37] yet a previous met-analysis was inconclusive [38]. It is not clear if
hypomagnesaemia influences the efficacy of magnesium supplementation for depression.
Conclusions
Daily supplementation with 248 mg of elemental magnesium as four 500 mg tablets of magne-
sium chloride per day leads to a significant decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms
regardless of age, gender, baseline severity of depression, or use of antidepressant medications.
While the cross over design of this trial is robust in controlling for internal biases, it would be
reassuring to see the results replicated in larger clinical trials that test long term efficacy and
provide additional data on subgroups. However, this efficacy trial showed magnesium supple-
ments may be a fast, safe, and easily accessible alternative, or adjunct, to starting or increasing
the dose of antidepressant medications.
