Purpose
We evaluated the impact of early integrated palliative care (PC) in patients with newly diagnosed
lung and GI cancer.
Patients and Methods
We randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed incurable lung or noncolorectal GI cancer to
receive either early integrated PC and oncology care (n 5 175) or usual care (n 5 175) between May
2011 and July 2015. Patients who were assigned to the intervention met with a PC clinician at least
once per month until death, whereas those who received usual care consulted a PC clinician upon
request. The primary end point was change in quality of life (QOL) from baseline to week 12, per
scoring by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scale. Secondary end points
included change in QOL from baseline to week 24, change in depression per the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9, and differences in end-of-life communication.
Results
Intervention patients (v usual care) reported greater improvement in QOL from baseline to week 24 (1.59
v 23.40; P 5 .010) but not week 12 (0.39 v 21.13; P 5 .339). Intervention patients also reported lower
depression at week 24, controlling for baseline scores (adjusted mean difference, 21.17; 95% CI, 22.33
to 20.01; P 5 .048). Intervention effects varied by cancer type, such that intervention patients with lung
cancer reported improvements in QOL and depression at 12 and 24 weeks, whereas usual care patients
with lung cancer reported deterioration. Patients with GI cancers in both study groups reported im-
provements in QOL and mood by week 12. Intervention patients versus usual care patients were more
likely to discuss their wishes with their oncologist if they were dying (30.2% v 14.5%; P 5 .004).
Conclusion
For patients with newly diagnosed incurable cancers, early integrated PC improved QOL and other
salient outcomes, with differential effects by cancer type. Early integrated PC may be most effective
if targeted to the specific needs of each patient population.

INTRODUCTION
Growing evidence supports a new role for palliative
care (PC)–trained specialists in the outpatient care
of patients with advanced cancer.1 The aim of this
research has been to improve symptom burden and
quality of life (QOL) in these patients with high
morbidity and incurable disease.2 Several ran-
domized trials have shown that simultaneous
delivery of palliative and oncology care in the
outpatient setting improves patient-reported out-
comes.3 For example, in patients with advanced
cancer and a limited life expectancy, both
telephone-based and in-person PC interventions
led to improved QOL, reduced symptom burden,
and greater satisfaction with care4-6; however, the
impact of providing PC early in the course of
disease for patients with newly diagnosed advanced
cancers has received less attention. In one trial of
patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non–
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), early integrated PC
significantly improved QOL, depression symptoms,
and illness understanding.7,8 Additional studies are
needed to confirm these findings in diverse cancer
populations with distinct disease trajectories.
Whereas improving patient QOL and symp-
tom burden are key goals of any supportive care
intervention, the practice of PC encompasses more

 than just symptom management.9 Patients with advanced cancer
often fail to understand the intent of their cancer treatment and
rarely engage in discussions about their preferences for care at the
end of life (EOL).10,11 Such misperceptions are associated with worse
EOL-care outcomes.10-12 PC clinicians are trained to help patients
understand their prognosis and treatment goals and to facilitate
informed decisions about their care throughout the illness trajectory
and at EOL.13 Through early integration, PC clinicians are posi-
tioned to support patients and oncologists in communicating about
prognosis, treatment goals, and care preferences over time.
The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of early in-
tegrated PC on patient-reported outcomes in a large cohort of
patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancers. We hypothesized
that patients who were randomly assigned to the intervention would
report better QOL, lower rates of depression, improved prognostic
understanding, and more frequent discussions about their EOL-care
preferences compared with those who were assigned to usual care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
We enrolled patients with newly diagnosed incurable cancers from
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in a nonblinded, randomized trial
of early PC integrated with oncology care compared with usual oncology
care. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Cancer Center In-
stitutional Review Board approved the study protocol, and all patients
provided written informed consent.
Patients
Patients were eligible to participate if they were within 8 weeks of
a diagnosis of incurable lung (NSCLC, small-cell, or mesothelioma) or
noncolorectal GI (pancreatic, esophageal, gastric, or hepatobiliary) cancer.
Patients were also required to receive their care at MGH, be $ 18 years of
age, have no history of therapy for metastatic disease, have an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and be able to
read and respond to questions in English or complete questionnaires with
minimal assistance. We excluded patients who were already receiving PC
services, needed immediate referral for PC or hospice, or who had sig-
nificant psychiatric or other comorbid disease prohibiting participation.
Study staff screened consecutive patients who presented to the oncology
clinics and notified clinicians via e-mail when patients were eligible to par-
ticipate. At the time of visit, study staff placed a reminder about eligibility on
patient charts. Oncology clinicians invited their patients to enroll in the study.
Random Assignment
The Office of Data Quality randomly assigned patients in a 1:1
fashion to receive early integrated PC and oncology care versus usual
oncology care, stratified by cancer type, using a computer-generated
number sequence, which was concealed until after group assignment.
Procedures
Patients who were assigned to early PC met with a member of the
outpatient PC team within 4 weeks of enrollment and at least once per
month until death. Consisting of physicians and advanced practice nurses,
the MGH outpatient team practices per guidelines of the National Con-
sensus Project for Quality Palliative Care.14 PC clinicians contacted pa-
tients via telephone when an in-person visit was not possible. The patient,
oncologist, or PC clinician could schedule additional PC visits at their
discretion. Finally, for patients who were admitted to MGH, the inpatient
PC team observed them throughout their hospitalization.
Patients who were assigned to usual oncology care were able to meet
with a PC clinician only upon request by the oncologist, patient, or family.
When these patients received PC services, they did not cross study groups or
follow the intervention protocol. All patients, regardless of group assignment,
continued to receive routine oncology care throughout the study period.
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
We measured QOL with the 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale, which assesses four dimensions of QOL
(physical, functional, emotional, and social well-being).15 To evaluate mood
and anxiety, patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).16,17 The PHQ-9
is a nine-item measure that detects symptoms of major depressive disorder
according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders-IV, with higher scores indicating worse depression.17 The 14-item
HADS consists of two subscales that assess anxiety and depression symp-
toms. Subscale scores range from 0 (no distress) to 21 (maximum distress).
We used the Prognosis and Treatment Perceptions Questionnaire
developed by El-Jawahri et al18 to measure patients’ understanding of their
prognosis and report of their communication with oncologists. The 13
items inquire about patient information preferences, perceptions of their
prognosis and health status, and communication about their prognosis and
EOL preferences.
Data Collection
Patients completed a demographic questionnaire and baseline self-
report measures after providing written informed consent and before
random assignment. Follow-up assessments occurred at 12 weeks and
24 weeks(or within 3 weeks of those time points). Protocol staff who were
separate from the research team administered study questionnaires. Pa-
tients who were unable to complete questionnaires in clinic received the
questionnaires by e-mail or mail. In addition, PC clinicians used a study-
specific, Web-based data capture tool to access a standardized template and
record the focus of their clinic visits after each outpatient encounter and
once during any hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
We performed statistical analyses using STATA software (version 9.3;
STATA, College Station, TX; Computing Resource Center, Santa Monica,
CA) and R software (version 3.3.1; The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Data
obtained through May 2016 were included. The primary outcome was
change in FACT-G score from baseline to 12 weeks; a 4- to 5-point change in
FACT-G score is considered clinically meaningful. We estimated that with
280 patients, the study would have 80% power to detect a 4-point difference
in the change in FACT-G scores from baseline to 12 weeks between study
groups (with P , .05). Given the rate of missing data observed in our
previous study, we increased our sample size to 350 patients.
To examine QOL and mood we used independent-samples t tests and
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models that controlled for baseline
criterion scores and potential confounders such as age and comorbidity,
which were imbalanced between groups and associated with outcomes of
interest. We also used ANCOVA to explore whether the effect of intervention
on outcomes varied by cancer cohort, that is, cancer cohort 3 group as-
signment interaction. Observing an interaction effect (P , .15),19 we then
conducted separate subgroup analyses in the lung and GI cancer cohorts
with ANCOVA to assess the effect of intervention on QOL and mood.
We also compared patient-reported outcomes between the two
groups by using a terminal decline joint modeling approach, which models
the trend in outcomes backward from death, rather than prospectively
from enrollment20. We did not prespecify the use of this approach in our
protocol as it was first published in 2013, after initiation of this study;
however, this technique offers an advantageous approach to account for
deterioration in patient-reported outcomes closer to death and uses
a mixed-effects model for longitudinal outcomes to provide valid estimates

 for missing data.20 We estimated terminal decline and survival distribu-
tions with semiparametric models, comparing QOL and mood between
study groups at 2, 4, and 6 months before death. All models adjusted for
baseline criterion scores and potential confounders such as age and
comorbidity. Given the observed interaction effect between cancer type
and intervention effect, we also conducted subgroup analyses in the lung
and GI cancer cohorts using terminal decline.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Three hundred fifty patients enrolled in the study (Appendix
Fig A1, online only) between May 2, 2011 and July 20, 2015.
Patients were mostly white (92.3%), with a mean age of 64.84 years
(standard deviation, 10.88 years), and 54.0% were male. In-
tervention patients were slightly older and had greater comor-
bidities than did those in the usual care group (Table 1).
PC Visits
The mean number of PC visits by 24 weeks was 6.54 (range,
0 to 14) in the intervention group and 0.89 visits (range, 0 to 7) in
the usual care group. The PC team met with 20.0% and 34.3% of
usual care patients by weeks 12 and 24, respectively. Figure 1
depicts the number of PC visits by study group and the content PC
clinicians addressed with intervention patients by 24 weeks.
QOL and Mood
Intervention patients reported a mean 0.39-point increase in
FACT-G scores from baseline to 12 weeks compared with usual
care patients who reported a 1.13-point decrease from baseline
(t[296] 5 20.96; SE 5 1.59; P 5 .339; Cohen’s d, 0.11). At
24 weeks, intervention patients reported a 1.59-point increase in
FACT-G scores from baseline whereas usual care patients reported
a 3.40-point decrease from baseline (t[238] 5 22.59; SE 5 1.93;
P 5.010; Cohen’s d, 0.33). Patient PHQ-9, HADS-Depression, and
HADS-Anxiety scores did not differ significantly between study
groups from baseline to weeks 12 or 24; however, ANCOVA models
that controlled for baseline variables demonstrated significant
differences that favored the intervention for FACT-G and PHQ-9
scores at 24 weeks (Table 2). Using the terminal decline model,
intervention participants had significantly higher QOL (FACT-G)
and lower depression symptom (PHQ-9) scores at 2 and 4 months,
but not at 6 months, before death (Table 3). Use of psychosocial
services, including psychiatry, psychology, and social work, did not
differ between study groups (data not shown).
Prognostic Understanding and Communication
At 12 weeks, similar proportions of patients in both study groups
reported that their primary goal of cancer treatment was cure (in-
tervention, 28.7% [n 5 41 of 143] v usual care, 34.5% [n 5 50 of
145]; P 5.289). However, intervention patients were more likely than
usual care patients to report that knowing about their prognosis was
“very helpful” or “extremely helpful” in making decisions about
treatment (96.5% [n 5 110 of 114] v 89.8% [n 5 115 of 128];
P 5.043) and coping with the disease (97.3% [n 5 108 of 111) v 83.6%
[n 5 107 of 128]; P , .001) at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, more
intervention patients reported that they had discussed their EOL
wishes with their oncologist compared with usual care patients
(30.2% [n 5 35 of 116] v 14.5% [n 5 17 of 117]; P 5.004). Study
groups did not differ with respect to information preferences,

Effect of PC Intervention by Cancer Type
Figure 2 depicts QOL and depression data longitudinally by
cancer cohort. Effects of the intervention varied by cancer cohort
over time for both FACT-G (cancer cohort 3 group assignment
interaction F[1,291] 5 2.94; P 5 .088) and PHQ-9 (cancer
cohort 3 group assignment interaction F[1,293] 5 3.05; P 5.082)
scores. We therefore conducted separate subgroup analyses to
examine differences in outcomes for the lung and GI cancer co-
horts. ANCOVA models that controlled for baseline variables
demonstrated significant intervention effects in the lung cancer
cohort for FACT-G and PHQ-9 scores at both 12 and 24 weeks, but
not in the GI cohort (Table 2).
By using the terminal decline model, intervention par-
ticipants with lung cancer had significantly higher QOL and
lower depression symptom scores at 2, 4, and 6 months before
death. In contrast, QOL and depression did not differ between
study groups in the GI cancer cohort before death (Table 3).
Given these results, we explored characteristics between pa-
tients with lung and GI cancer and found no differences in
baseline measures or in the number of PC visits among those
patients who received intervention (Appendix Table A1, online
only). However, the GI cancer cohort had a higher proportion
of male patients and a greater number of hospitalizations from
baseline to week 24 compared with the lung cancer cohort.
DISCUSSION
The results from this trial add to the growing literature on the
benefits of integrating PC services earlier in the course of disease
for patients with advanced cancer. We not only confirmed previous
findings that early integrated PC improves QOL and mood in
patients with incurable cancers, but also that these positive effects on

Early Palliative Care in Lung and GI Cancer
 patient outcomes vary by cancer type. We further identified new
benefits of the integrated PC model in improving patients’ ability to
cope with their prognosis and in enhancing their communication
about EOL-care preferences with clinicians. Of importance, these
data elucidate key elements of the early PC intervention, encom-
passing much more than symptom management.
Given our prior study in patients with advanced NSCLC,21 the
primary outcome of this trial was change in QOL from baseline to
12 weeks; however, we did not detect a significant improvement in
QOL with early integrated PC until the 24-week time point. These
results are consistent with the three prior randomized trials of early
PC that all failed to show a significant improvement in QOL at

 12 weeks.4,5,22 Similar to the Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends
(ENABLE) Project, our terminal decline analysisconfirmed that patients
assigned to early integrated PC reported better QOL and mood in the
months before death.4 Thus, longer follow-up might be needed to fully
assess the effect of the early PC model on patient-reported outcomes.
Prior randomized trials of PC interventions included patients
with different cancer diagnoses with considerable heterogeneity in
their time from diagnosis, clinical course, and overall survival. Given
these trials in mixed cancer populations, we did not expect dif-
ferential outcomes by cancer type. Whereas subgroup analyses are
exploratory, we did demonstrate differences in study outcomes
between patients with lung and GI cancers. Similar to our previous
study, patients with lung cancer who received usual care reported
worsened QOL from baseline to 12 weeks, whereas intervention
patients had improved QOL over this timeframe.7 This QOL dif-
ference in the lung cancer cohort became even more pronounced by
24 weeks and in the months before death. In contrast, regardless of
group assignment, the GI cohort reported an improvement in their
QOL over the initial 12 weeks of the trial, with no differences in
study outcomes in the months before death. Thus, the QOL and
mood trajectories, as well as the impact of PC integration on these
patient-reported outcomes, vary between patients with lung and GI
cancers. Although further research is needed to understand these
differences, a possible explanation for these findings is that patients
with GI cancer spent significantly more time in the hospital than did
patients with lung cancer, which may have affected their QOL and
mood. In future work, investigators should explore the role of
targeted PC interventions to address the specialized needs of specific
cancer populations with particular attention to appropriate timing
for PC integration within the context of patients’ illness trajectories.
This trial is the first, to our knowledge, to show an effect of
early PC on patients’ communication about EOL-care preferences.
We observed that intervention patients were twice as likely to
report that they had discussed their EOL-care wishes compared
with usual care patients. Intervention patients were also more likely
to report that knowing about their prognoses helped them make
decisions about treatment and to cope with their illness. As
a clinical care model, PC intervention in this trial was not strictly
manualized.5,7 In contrast, a recent study of a structured com-
munication intervention delivered by PC clinicians in the intensive
care unit failed to improve family caregiver–reported outcomes.23
Allowing PC clinicians the freedom to address the concerns that are
most salient for the patient may be the optimal approach to provide
personalized care; however, this patient-centered approach has also
made it challenging to describe the elements of early PC in-
tervention. Results from this trial regarding both the nature of the

Early Palliative Care in Lung and GI Cancer
 PC visits and the impact of early PC on patients’ coping and
communication shed new light on the key processes of this care
model. Whereas symptom management is a core component of
PC, providing patients with the skills they need to cope with and
communicate about their life-threatening illness is another es-
sential element of PC for patients with advanced cancer.
Our study has several limitations. First, patients and clinicians
were not blinded to group assignment. Second, we did not anticipate
the difference in QOL and mood trajectories between patients with
lung and GI cancers; thus, we did not plan the sample size to evaluate
outcomes by cancer subtype. Third, because usual care at our in-
stitution often entails involvement of PC in the outpatient setting,
more than one third of patients who were assigned to usual care met
with the PC team during the first 24 weeks of the study. This contact
may have diluted the effect of the intervention, though such practice
likely represents current national standards. Similarly, our PC team
has been well integrated in our cancer center for the last decade,
which has perhaps enhanced the PC skills of oncologists.24 Lastly, we
conducted the trial at a single institution with a predominantly white
and English-speaking population, which may limit the generaliz-
ability of the results to other care settings and clinical populations.
Early integration of palliative and oncology care in patients with
newly diagnosed incurable cancers improves QOL, reduces depression
symptoms, and enhances coping with prognosis and communication
about EOL-care preferences. These findings provide further evidence
to support early integrated PC as the standard of care for patients
with newly diagnosed incurable cancers. With the recent Dying in
America25 report strongly urging research to improve patient-clinician
communication about EOL care, the finding that intervention pa-
tients were twice as likely as usual care patients to discuss EOL-care
preferences is notable and timely. Although the outcomes of this trial
demonstrate meaningful benefits of early PC, they raise new questions
about how best to integrate and evaluate PC in populations with
different disease and QOL trajectories. This study also highlights the
complexities of studying supportive care interventions during a time
of rapid advances in cancer treatment, as recent discoveries are having
an undeniable impact on patient survival, but also perhaps on QOL
and mood. Thus, further research is needed to define optimal PC
delivery models that target the specific needs of different patient
populations in the modern era of cancer therapeutics.
