ABSTRACT
Elevated levels of fine particulate matter ,2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) are associated with
increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes and death, but their association with risk of CKD and ESRD is
unknown. We linked the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs data-
bases to build an observational cohort of 2,482,737 United States veterans, and used survival models to
evaluate the association of PM2.5 concentrations and risk of incident eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, in-
cident CKD, eGFR decline $30%, and ESRD over a median follow-up of 8.52 years. County-level exposure
was defined at baseline as the annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2004, and separately as time-varying
where it was updated annually and as cohort participants moved. In analyses of baseline exposure (median,
11.8 [interquartile range, 10.1–13.7] mg/m3), a 10-mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated
with increased risk of eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.14 to 1.29), CKD (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.38), eGFR decline $30% (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.39),
and ESRD (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.35). In time-varying analyses, a 10-mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concen-
tration was associated with similarly increased risk of eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, CKD, eGFR decline
$30%, and ESRD. Spline analyses showed a linear relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and risk of
kidney outcomes. Exposure estimates derived from National Aeronautics and Space Administration sat-
ellite data yielded consistent results. Our findings demonstrate a significant association between exposure
to PM2.5 and risk of incident CKD, eGFR decline, and ESRD.

 Lue et al.17 showed that residential proximity to major roads is
associated with reduced eGFR. In seminal findings, Mehta etal.18
examined the relationship between long-term exposure to PM2.5
and longitudinal changes in eGFR in a regional cohort of 669
older men who were participants in the Boston-based Veterans
Administration Normative Aging Study, and found that higher
1-year PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower eGFR and an
additional annual decrease in eGFR. In a large Chinese study, Xu
et al.19 examined an 11-year (for indication) renal biopsy seriesof
71,151 native kidney biopsies and reported that long-term expo-
sure to high levels of PM2.5 was associated with increased odds of
membranous nephropathy, but not other glomerular diseases.
The sum of the experimental and clinical findings provides
biologic plausibility and supports the hypothesis that environ-
mental exposure to elevated levels of PM2.5 is associated with
increased risk of kidney disease. However, whether exposure to
elevated levels of PM2.5 is associated with increased risk of
development of CKD and CKD progression has not been
examined in large national longitudinal epidemiologic studies.
Identification of air pollution as a potential contributor to kid-
ney disease will inform national and global burden of disease
estimates, stimulate further policy discussions on the impor-
tance of curbing air pollution on health and disease, and in-
form the public about the hazards of air pollution. In this work,
we built a longitudinal national cohort of 2,482,737 United
States veterans and characterized the relationship of PM2.5
and risk of incident CKD, and progression to ESRD.
RESULTS
There were 2,482,737 cohort participants followed for a median
of 8.52 years (interquartile range, 8.04–8.80). PM2.5 concentra-
tions ranged from 5.0 to 9.1 mg/m3, 9.2 to 11.0 mg/m3, 11.1 to
12.6, and 12.7 to 22.1 mg/m3 in quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respec-
tively. Overall cohort participants were mostly white men (Table
1). Cohort participants living in counties in the highest quartile
of PM2.5 concentrations were more likely to be black, more likely
to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease,
and higher eGFR at time of cohort entry (Table 1). They were
also more likely to be current or former smokers (Table 1).
Counties in the highest quartile of PM2.5 concentrations had
significantly higher population density. There was a gradual in-
crease in incident rate of eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, CKD,
eGFR decline $30%, and ESRD across quartiles of county level
PM2.5 concentrations (Table 2). Adjusted survival curves by
PM2.5 quartiles are presented in Figure 1, A–D.
Exposure to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter and the
Risk of Incident eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and
Incident CKD
We examined the association of PM2.5 concentrations and the
risk of incident eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 among those
who had no history of eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 before
time of cohort entry. Where exposure was defined at baseline
as the annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2004, a 10-mg/m3
increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with increased
risk of incident eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.14 to 1.29)
(Table 3). In analyses where exposure was time-varying
throughout duration in the cohort (exposure for each cohort
participant was matched with his/her county of residence at a
given time and the county’s average annual particulate matter
concentration for that year), the risk was also increased (HR,
1.25; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.34) (Table 3). In analyses where ex-
posure was considered in quartiles, compared with cohort
participants in the lowest quartile (quartile 1) of PM2.5 con-
centrations, those in quartile 2, 3, and 4 had graded increased
risk of incident eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in analyses
considering baseline 2004 exposure and time-varying exposure
(Supplemental Table 1). Spline analyses suggested a linear re-
lationship between PM2.5 concentrations and risk incident
eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (P for nonlinearity =0.90);
the linear representation of the association of PM2.5 concen-
trations and risk is depicted in Figure 2A.
We evaluated the riskof incidentCKD (defined as two eGFR
measurements ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at least 90 days apart)
in a subcohort of people with at least two eGFR measurements
separated by at least 90 days during follow-up and who had no
history of eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 before time of co-
hort entry. The results were consistent (Figure 2B, Supple-
mental Table 1, Table 3).
Exposure to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter and the
Risk of eGFR Decline and Progression to ESRD
In the overall cohort, an increase in PM2.5 of 10 mg/m3 was
associated with increased risk of eGFR decline $30% in analyses
consideringbaselineexposure(HR,1.28;95%CI,1.18to1.39),and
time-varying exposure (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.46) (Table 3).
Compared with the lowest quartile (quartile 1) of PM2.5 con-
centrations, quartiles 2, 3, and 4 exhibited a graded increase in risk
ofeGFRdecline$30%(SupplementalTable1).Therewasalinear
relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and risk of eGFR de-
cline $30% (Figure 2C) (P for nonlinearity =0.84). The results
were consistent in analyses considering the outcome of ESRD
(Figure 2D, Supplemental Table 1, Table 3).
Significance Statement
Exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (,2.5mm) is asso-
ciated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death, but
its impact on CKD and ESRD is not known. Analyses of data from a
large cohort of United States Veterans demonstrate a linear re-
lationship between exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution
and risk of incident CKD or progression to ESRD. The study provides
a quantitative assessment of the US burden of CKD and ESRD at-
tributable to air pollution and establishes air pollution as an im-
portant risk factor. The findings contribute to understanding the
geographic variation in burden of CKD in the US and globally.
Further study is needed to understand the mechanisms by which
small particulate air-borne pollutants effect the progression of CKD.

 PM2.5 and Risk of Adverse Kidney Outcomes Using
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Data
We additionally considered PM2.5 estimates derived from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
space-borne satellite sensors as an alternative data source to
define ambient PM2.5 exposure levels. Analyses considering
the NASA satellites remote sensing data yielded results con-
sistent with those shown using exposure data obtained from
ground-based air monitoring stations (Table 4).
Population Attributable Fraction
Population attributable fraction (PAF) represents the propor-
tional reduction in population disease that would occur if
exposure to PM2.5 was reduced to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency’s (EPA) recommended levels of 12 mg/m3. PAF for
incident eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and incident CKD
were 1.51% (95% CI, 1.44 to 1.58), and 2.06% (95% CI, 1.96
to 2.17), respectively. PAF for eGFR decline $30%, and ESRD
were 2.21% (95% CI, 2.14 to 2.30), and 2.31% (95% CI, 1.86
to 2.75), respectively. Our estimate of the national burden of
CKD attributable to elevated levels of PM2.5 exceeding the EPA
standard (where the theoretical minimum risk exposure level
[TMREL] was set at the EPA standard of 12 mg/m3) in the
contiguous United States was 44,793 incident cases per year
(95% uncertainty interval [95% UI], 42,716 to 46,869). The
national burden of ESRD attributable to PM2.5 levels in excess
of EPA standards was 2438 incident cases per year (95% UI,
1963 to 2902). We conducted analyses where we defined
TMREL on the basis of the methodologies of the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) studies; this TMREL was assigned
on the basis of a uniform distribution of PM2.5 from 2.4 to 5.9
mg/m3 representing exposure values between the minimum
and fifth percentiles of exposure distributions from outdoor
air pollution cohort studies.20–22 Using the GBD definition of
TMREL, the estimate of the national burden of incident CKD
attributable to air pollution was 337,032 (95% UI, 207,976 to
466,087) and the national burden of incident ESRD attribut-
able to air pollution was 13,537 (95% UI, 8377 to 18,696).
Maps depicting the geographicdistribution of theburden of
incident CKD where the theoretical minimum was set at the
EPA standard, and according to the GBD methodologies are
presented in Figures 3, A and B, respectively.
Sensitivity Analyses
In order to test different distance thresholds (and spatial res-
olutions) for exposure definition, we assigned PM2.5 exposure
levels to each cohort participant on the basis of the nearest air
monitoring station in those who were within 30, 10, and 5
miles of an air monitoring station (Supplemental Table 2); the
results were consistent and yielded slightly higher risk esti-
mates in time-varying analyses where the maximum distance
from an air monitoring station was ,5 miles (Supplemental
Table 2). In order to evaluate the robustness of study findings
in the most populated counties in the United States, the anal-
yses were restricted to the 100 counties with highest numbers

 of population, and results were consistent in terms of direction
and magnitude of risk estimates (Supplemental Table 3). Be-
cause variation in regional characteristics may confound the
association of PM2.5 and kidney disease, we developed strategies
to evaluate the association in analyses, considering city-adjusted
and within-city models (as described in Supplemental Material);
the results suggest that within metropolitan areas (city-adjusted
or within-city models), higher PM2.5 concentrations were asso-
ciated with higher risk of renal outcomes (Supplemental Table
4). Between-city risk estimates were slightly higher than within-
city estimates (Supplemental Table 4). Because characteristics of
geographies might confound the association between PM2.5 and
risk of kidney outcomes,23 we curated the County Health Rank-
ings datasets24,25 and built analyses additionally controlling for
55 United States county-level variables in six domains, including
demographics, physical environment, social and economic
factors, health behaviors, clinical care, and health outcomes;
the results remained consistent (Supplemental Table 5). We re-
peated the analyses using expanded and more sensitive definitions
of hypertension and diabetes: the definition of hypertension in-
cluded relevant diagnostic codes and average systolic BP (treated
as a continuous variable) in the year before time zero (T0); the
definition of diabetes included relevant diagnostic codes as well
as use of diabetic medications (including oral hypoglycemic
agents and insulin) and hemoglobin A1c levels .6.4%. The
results remained stable to this challenge of using expanded
definitions of key drivers of kidney disease (Supplemental Table
6). The results were reproduced in analyses considering alter-
native renal outcomes, including odds of rapid eGFR decline
(eGFR slope ,25 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year), and risk of
ESRD or eGFR decline $50% (Supplemental Table 7). As a
measure of calibration, we examined the association of PM2.5
and risk of death where a priori observations suggest that an
association is expected (positive control).6,10 Our results
show a significant association between PM2.5 concentrations
and risk of death (Supplemental Table 8). We also considered
the outcome of myocardial infarction as an additional positive
control3,26; the results were consistent with published litera-
ture6,10 inthat an increase inPM2.5 was associated with increased
risk of myocardial infarction (Supplemental Table 9). Results

with those shown in primary analyses27 (Supplemental Table 10).
Negative control is a valuable complement to other epidemi-
ologic methods and serves to identify and resolve both suspected
and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference, including
confounding, mismeasurements, and other biases, design, or
analytic flaws.28 Ambient air sodium concentration is one of
the parameters measured by air monitoring stations. There is
no biologic basis to support an association between levels of
sodium concentrations in the air and risk of adverse renal out-
comes; this renders ambient air sodium a suitable negative con-
trol.28 We therefore, as a negative exposure control, tested the
association between ambient air sodium levels and the risk of
renal outcomes, and the results show a vanishingly weak or non-
significant association in models, considering baseline exposure

DISCUSSION
InalargenationalcohortofUnitedStatesveterans,weobserveda
linear relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and risk of
incident CKD and progression to ESRD. The results were con-
sistent where baseline exposure was defined as the annual aver-
age PM2.5 concentrations in the year 2004, and where exposure
was time-varying to reflect movement ofcohortparticipants and
changes in PM2.5 concentrations over the years. Furthermore,
we examined a range of kidney outcomes including develop-
ment of kidney disease, kidney function decline (eGFR decline
$30%), and the terminal outcome of ESRD. The results consis-
tently showed a linear relationship between PM2.5 levels and risk
of kidney outcomes. The results were robust in sensitivity anal-
yses including the examination of different distance thresholds
from an air monitoring station, and analyses evaluating the as-
sociation within metropolitan areas. The results were also con-
sistent in analyses using ambient PM2.5 estimates derived from
NASA’s satellite data. Ambient air sodium concentrations (used
as a negative control) were not associated with increased risk of
adverse renal outcomes. The constellation of findings suggests
that chronic exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution is a
significant risk factor for the development and progression of
kidney disease.
Although air quality has significantly improved in the
United States over the past several decades, air quality remains
suboptimal in many parts of the country and in multiple ge-
ographies around the world. In our analyses, the risk of CKD
and its progression was most pronounced at the highest levels
of fine particulate matter concentrations. However, analyses
where PM2.5 concentrations were categorized in quartiles
suggest a graded relationship; spline analyses (and tests of
nonlinearity) endorse a linear relationship where risk starts to
increase at relatively low concentrations of particulate matter
that are well below the recommended levels by the World Health
Organization (10 mg/m3) and the EPA (12 mg/m3). We used a
conservative approach to estimate the attributable burden of
CKD and ESRD in the contiguous United States, and our results
suggest a small but significant number of incident cases of CKD
(44,793 per year) and ESRD (2438 per year) are attributable to
levels of particulate matter air pollution exceeding the EPA

 recommended level of 12 mg/m3. A lower and more stringent
TMREL of PM2.5 between 2.4 and 5.9 mg/m3 yielded a higher
estimate of incident CKD (337,032 per year) and incident ESRD
(13,537 per year). The findings provide a quantitative assess-
ment of the potential reduction in burden of CKD that is achiev-
able with improvement in air quality in the United States, and
suggest the need for a broader assessment of the global burden of
kidney disease attributable to air pollution.
Multiple studies reported substantial geographic variation in
theburdenofCKDandESRDintheUnitedStatesandglobally;the
variation was persistent after accounting for diabetes, hyperten-
sion, and obesity conditions generally considered to be major
drivers of kidney disease, suggesting that variation in burden of
disease is likely due to factors other than these traditional driv-
ers.23,29 It has been hypothesized that some of the geographic
variation in kidney disease burden may be due to environmental
factors.23 Our study results suggest that particulate matter air
pollution is an important, but yet unrecognized risk factor for
kidneydisease and its progression, which mayexplain some of the
geographic variation in kidney disease burden in the United
States. Examination of the effect of particulate matter on risk of
incident kidney disease and its progression outside the United
States, and particularly in areas with much higher levels of par-
ticulate matter air pollution is warranted.
Threedistincthypotheseshavebeenproposedtoexplainthe
epidemiologic observations of a relationship between PM2.5
and cardiovascular outcomes; these may also be pertinent in
the evaluation of renal outcomes.30 The first suggests that in-
haled particles provoke pulmonary inflammation which may
then lead to systemic inflammation.30 The second suggests
that the mechanism involves pollutant-induced disturbances
in the lung autonomic nervous system.30 The third (and most
plausible hypothesis) is predicated on the premise that air-
borne particulates enter the bloodstream where they may
then interact with tissue components to promote the observed
pathologic effects30,31; the latter is supported by emerging ev-
idence suggesting that inhaled inert gold nanoparticles not
only enter the bloodstream of healthy adult volunteers, but
are detected in the urine within minutes after exposure,
providingaproofofconceptthatinhalednanoparticlesgetfiltered
and excreted by the kidney.31 These three hypotheses provide
contextual background to evaluate the experimental and clinical
findings describing the extrapulmonary effect of particulate mat-
ter air pollution, where it has been reported that exposure to
elevated levels of PM2.5 is associated with increased inflammatory
mediators (including TNF-a, IL-6, and plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1), oxidative stress,32–34 increased atherosclerotic plaque
area, and exaggerated vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine
and serotonin.35 Evidence suggests that increased PM2.5 concen-
trations are associated with significant decrease in flow-mediated
dilatation,36,37 increases in systolic BP and pulse pressure,38–40
and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.41
Emerging evidence also suggests that exposure to ambient air
pollutants can lead to metabolic disturbances, including glucose
intolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, higher blood lipid con-
centrations, weight gain, and increased risk of diabetes melli-
tus.42–44 It is plausible that one or more of these mechanistic
pathways may explain the association described here.
This study has several limitations. Cohort participants were
United States veterans and mostly older white men; therefore,
the findings may not be generalizable to other populations.
Althoughweaccountedforknownconfounders,thepossibility
ofresidualconfoundingduetoeitherunknownorunmeasured
confounders cannot be completely excluded. We specifically
note that the counties with the highest measures of PM2.5 had
higher population density and greater percentage of citizens
living in poverty. Although we took care to develop analyses
for the 100 most populated counties, built city-adjusted and
within-city analyses, and also accounted for United States
county-level characteristics23 in domains including demo-
graphics, physical environment, social and economic condi-
tions, health behaviors, clinical care, and health outcomes, it is
possible that individual differences in genomic makeup,
dietary habits, physical activity, other environmental or occu-
pational attributes, variation in exposure to heavy metals, or
other factors not captured in our analyses might explain
the described results. To define covariates we relied on VA
administrative databases, and although we used comorbidity
definitions validated for use in administrative datasets, mis-
classification or inaccurate measurement of predictor variable

 is not impossible. Our analyses did not consider the compo-
sition of PM2.5, which may vary by region and over time;
however, estimates using nonspecific PM2.5 mass alone may
underestimate the total effect of PM2.5 on health outcomes
and bias the results toward the null hypothesis.10 Our datasets
did not contain information on time spent in traffic or out-
doors, and did not include information on potential exposure
to indoor air pollutants, which may result in misclassification
of exposure. The study has a number of strengths, including
the large national cohort of veterans who are recipients of care
in a single integrated network of health care systems designed
to reduce variation in care practices, and the analyses benefited
from the merging of large databases including those of the VA,
EPA, Census Bureau, and other data sources. We followed our
cohort participants for a median of 8.52 years (interquartile
range, 8.04–8.80), designed analytic strategies using time-varying
exposure (to capture updated exposure levels as participants
moved over the years), and evaluated a range of well defined
chronic kidney outcomes, including development of kidney
disease, CKD progression, and the terminal outcome of ESRD.
Our analytic approach to examine within-city and city-adjusted
effect reduces concern about confounding due to variation in
regional characteristics, and potential geographic variation in
composition and toxic content of PM2.5. The analyses also con-
sidered NASA’s satellite data as alternative data source to define
PM2.5 exposure. The analytic strategies also included the de-
velopment and testing of positive and negative controls to detect
possible hidden bias. In summary, our results demonstrate a
significant association between PM2.5 concentrations and risk
of development of kidney disease, and its progression to ESRD.
Effort to improve air quality might ease the burden of kidney
disease in the United States and globally.
CONCISE METHODS
Cohort Participants
We selected users of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System, using
data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, who had at least one
outpatient eGFRmeasurement between October 1,2003and September
30, 2004 and no prior history of ESRD, and designated the date of last
eGFR measurement in this time period as T0 (n=2,751,717). Patients
were further chosen on having at least one eGFR measurement after
T0 (n=2,680,431), and were followed until September 30, 2012 ordeath.
Participants were then limited to those who had data on PM2.5
(n=2,628,465) and data on all covariates, yielding an analytic cohort

National United States–based estimates of incident rates of CKD and treat-

zipcodecentroidwereobtainedfromtheUSCensusBureau.Moredetailed
description of data sources is provided in Supplemental Material.
Exposure Assessment
The primary predictor variable for analyses was PM2.5 concentrations.
Cohort participants were assigned geographic location, which may have
varied over time, on the basis of their county information contained in
outpatient or inpatient data closest to but before a given time point. Using
annual monitor and modeled data, exposure (in micrograms per cubic
meter) was defined as (1) the annual average in year 2004, where a pa-
tient’s geographic location was designated as location at T0 (used in base-
linemodels);and(2)timevaryingwheregeographiclocationwasupdated
as cohort participants moved (and average annual exposure was matched
to their updated geographic location at any specific time). In all primary
analyses, unless otherwise indicated, measures correspond to a 10-mg/m3
increaseinPM2.5.9PM2.5exposurewasadditionallycategorizedintoquar-
tiles defined by the county-level distribution. In the time-varying model,
quartiles were independently defined by exposure distributions among
the counties in each given year. PM2.5 was alternatively defined by NASA’s
SEDAC Global Annual PM2.5 grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS
aerosol optical depth data through linkage to participant’s zip code of
residence.55,56 Further details are provided in Supplemental Material.
Ascertainment of Outcomes
Outcomes evaluated included the risk of incident eGFR ,60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2, the risk of incident CKD where CKD was defined as two
eGFR measurements ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at least 90 days apart,47
time until $30% decline in eGFR from eGFR at T0, and time until
ESRD.59 Patients were censored after onset of ESRD, for all outcomes
other than ESRD, and at time of death or end of study follow-up. The
date of first ESRD services was ascertained through linkage of VA and
USRDS databases. Outpatient eGFR was used in the assessment of all
outcomes except for ESRD. eGFR was calculated using the four-variable
abbreviated CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation on the basis of
age, race, sex, and serum creatinine.60
Covariates
Covariate selection was on the basis of factors that could potentially
confound the association of PM2.5 and kidney disease outcomes, and
was informed by prior studies.3,23,47,61–64 Baseline covariates were
ascertained from October 1, 1999 until cohort entry (T0). Covariates
included age, race, sex, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung
disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, T0 eGFR,
BMI, smoking status, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/
angiotensin receptor blocker use, county population density, number
of outpatient eGFR measurements, number of hospitalizations, and
county percent in poverty. Details of covariate definitions are pro-
vided in Supplemental Material. Covariates were treated as continu-
ous variables where appropriate, unless otherwise indicated.

and as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for con-
tinuous variables if normally or non-normally distributed, respectively.
PM2.5 quartiles for Table 1 and baseline models were derived from the
distribution of 2004 monitor and modeled PM2.5 among counties. Age,
race, sex, and eGFR adjusted incident rates are presented, and were stan-
dardized to the distribution of these variables in the overall cohort. Sur-
vival curves for PM2.5 quartiles, adjusted for age, race, sex, and eGFR, are
presented. Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for covariates as
described. In order to account for intracounty correlation, a robust sand-
wich estimator was used. Analyses were performed in baseline models and
time varying models, where PM2.5 exposure was treated as time varying.
Patients were excluded from time-varying analyses if their county of resi-
dence had missing data at any time during follow-up. The inclusion of
time-varying models in the analytic strategies was in consideration of the
fact that cohort participants may have moved over time, but also impor-
tantly in recognition of the fact that the Clean Air Act and other environ-
mental policies at state and local levels have resulted in reduction in PM2.5
over the years.65 The primary analyses were repeated utilizing PM2.5 expo-
sures derived from NASA satellite data. Effect modification of the associ-
ation between PM2.5 exposure and renal outcomes by age, race, sex, and
BMI was examined through the addition of interaction terms in separate
baseline models using above and below median age, black and nonblack,
men and women, and above and below median BMI interactions.
Cubic spline analyses were performed.66 A Wald chi-squared test
for nonlinearity of spline terms indicated that, for all outcomes, there
was no statistical evidence of deviation from linearity. Further infor-
mation on the spline analysis is provided in Supplemental Material. A
