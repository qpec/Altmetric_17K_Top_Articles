ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
 
Neuroendocrine tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies with a 
broad spectrum of clinical behavior. Poorly differentiated tumors follow an aggres-
sive course with limited treatment options, and new approaches are needed. Oncogenic  
BRAF V600E 
( 
BRAF 
 
V600E 
) substitutions are observed primarily in melanoma, colon cancer, and non–small cell lung 
cancer, but have been identifi
 ed in multiple tumor types. Here, we describe the fi
 rst reported recur-
rent  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 mutations in advanced high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and identify a 
 
BRAF alteration frequency of 9% in 108 cases. Among these  
BRAF alterations, 80% were  
BRAF 
V600E 
. 
Dramatic response to BRAF–MEK combination therapy occurred in two cases of metastatic high-grade 
rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma refractory to standard therapy. Urinary  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 circulating tumor 
DNA monitoring paralleled disease response. Our series represents the largest study of genomic profi
 l-
ing in colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and provides strong evidence that BRAF 
V600E 
 is an oncogenic 
driver responsive to BRAF–MEK combination therapy in this molecular subset. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: BRAF 
V600E is an established oncogenic driver, but signifi
 cant disparities in response 
exist among tumor types. Two patients with treatment-refractory high-grade colorectal neuroendo-
crine tumors harboring BRAF 
V600E 
 exhibited rapid and durable response to combined BRAF–MEK inhibi-
tion, providing the fi
 rst clinical evidence of effi
 cacy in this aggressive tumor type.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the digestive tract 
are increasing, with an estimated annual incidence of 
3.65/100,000 ( 
1 
). The current therapeutic approach is dic-
tated by site of origin, disease stage, and surrogate biologic 
features such as proliferative rate and overall histologic grade. 
Surgical resection is frequently undertaken in nonmetastatic 
disease, although it is rarely curative due to distant failure, 
and large prospective studies to guide therapy are lacking. 
Poorly differentiated (high-grade) NETs are often considered 
for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)–like chemotherapies based

BRAF–MEK Responses in Colorectal Neuroendocrine Tumors
RESEARCH BRIEF
on aggressive biologic behavior, and data from small retro-
spective series suggesting a multimodality approach with 
chemoradiation and surgery may be optimal for localized 
nonpancreatic high-grade NETs ( 
2–4 
). The prognosis for 
advanced high-grade NETs remains poor, with median sur-
vival of less than 12 months ( 
5, 6 
). 
 
The molecular features of NETs are not comprehensively 
characterized and have focused on alterations in the tumor 
suppressor  
MEN1 
, occurring primarily in pancreatic neu-
roendocrine tumors (pNET), which differ from nonpancre-
atic NETs ( 
7–9 
). Limited data exist on molecular features in 
nonpancreatic NETs, and alterations in  
SRC 
, SMAD family 
genes,  
AURKA, EGFR, HSP90, PDGFR 
, and amplifi
 cation of 
 
AKT1 
 and  
AKT2 
 were observed in a limited series of low-grade, 
well-differentiated small intestinal NETs ( 
10 
). Colorectal and 
high-grade NETs are even less well characterized, further 
limiting therapeutic options. 
 
Here, we identify recurrent somatic  
BRAF 
 alterations 
in high-grade colorectal NETs and describe two patients 
with treatment-refractory metastatic high-grade rectal NET 
harboring a  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 substitution who achieved a rapid 
and dramatic response to combination BRAF–MEK-directed 
therapy. This is the largest published colorectal NET series 
and the fi
 rst reported oncogenic  
BRAF 
 mutation in high-
grade NET, demonstrating the ability of genomic profi
 ling to 
identify therapeutically relevant alterations in this aggressive 
disease with no standard treatment approach. 
 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Case 1 
 
A 70-year-old woman presented with rectal bleeding from 
a fungating rectal mass, which on biopsy revealed a poorly 
differentiated high-grade (grade 3) rectal NET with a Ki67 
proliferation index greater than 60% ( 
Fig. 1A–D 
). Immunohis-
tochemistry demonstrated microsatellite stability (MSI-stable). 
She received neoadjuvant chemoradiation with carboplatin and 
etoposide followed by low anterior resection and end colos-
tomy. Histopathologic analysis confi
 rmed residual NET, grade 
2/3, Ki67 3%–4%, positive margins, and 4/22 positive lymph 
nodes. A PET-CT scan 1 month after resection demonstrated 
metastatic disease, confi
 rmed on liver biopsy as high-grade 
NET ( 
Figs. 1E–H 
 and  
2A 
). She was treated with temozolomide 
but developed rapid radiographic progression, left-leg paresthe-
sia, and abdominal pain within 3 months of therapy ( 
Fig. 2A 
). 
To investigate further therapeutic options, her liver biopsy was 
subjected to comprehensive genomic profi
 ling as previously 
described ( 
11 
). Genomic analysis revealed a  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 substitu-
tion at a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 26%, with a median 
sample coverage depth of 529 
× ( 
Table 1 
). The initial surgical 
specimen was retrospectively tested and also found to harbor 
a  
BRAF 
 
V600E mutation. In the absence of an available clinical 
trial, she was transitioned to dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily 
and trametinib 2 mg once daily, and her symptoms resolved 
within 10 days of treatment. Concurrent decrease in serum 
chromo 
granin A and urinary  
BRAF 
 
V600E circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) using a clinical laboratory improvement amendment 
(CLIA)–approved assay correlated with rapid disease response 
( 
Fig. 2B and C 
). She obtained a dramatic radiographic response 
within 5 weeks that had continued for over 7 months at the 
time of manuscript submission  
( 
Fig. 2A 
). Serial chromogranin 
A remains decreased, and a quantitative algorithm applied to 
the CLIA test result indicated a nondetectable urinary  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 
level from a peak ctDNA MAF of 0.6% ( 
Fig. 2B and C 
). 
 
 
Case 2 
 
A 39-year-old woman presented with rectal bleeding and 
was found to have a large locally advanced high-grade rectal 
NET with a proliferative index of over 70% ( 
Fig. 3A–D 
). She was 
treated with cisplatin and etoposide for 3 cycles with concurrent 
 
Figure 1.

consisting of nested/organoid proliferation of variably small cells with stippled chromatin with some cells exhibiting pink granular cytoplasm (A and B). 
Immunohistochemical stains are diffusely positive for synaptophysin (C) and chromogranin (not shown), with variable CDX2 staining (D). E–H highlight 
similar features from the liver biopsy with uniform cells (E and F), scattered mitotic fi
 gures (arrows), diffuse synaptophysin positivity (G), and Ki67 
proliferative index of 40%–50% (H 
).

radiation but developed progressive disease with hepatic, pul-
monary, and inguinal nodal metastases. She received carbo-
platin/docetaxel for 6 cycles and achieved initial stable disease 
followed by disease progression and worsening rectal pain. 
Comprehensive genomic profi
 ling of the rectal mass revealed a 
 
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 substitution at an MAF of 53% at a coverage depth 
of 734 
× 
 ( 
Table 1 
). An appropriate clinical trial was not avail-
able, and she was treated with vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily 
and trametinib 2 mg once daily and achieved a resolution of 
her pain within 3 days, followed by a dramatic radiographic 
response ( 
Fig. 3E 
). She remains on combination BRAF–MEK 
therapy with an ongoing response lasting 9 months. 
 
 
 
 
BRAF 
 Alterations Occur Frequently in Advanced 
Colorectal NET 
 
To identify additional neuroendocrine cases harboring 
 
BRAF alterations, we retrospectively reviewed a database of 
over 55,000 clinical samples subjected to comprehensive 
genomic profi
 ling as previously described ( 
11 
). Including 
the incident case (case 1), we identifi
 ed a total of 109 cases 
of colorectal NETs. Ten samples (9%) harbored alterations in 
 
BRAF 
 (80%  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
;  
Table 1 
). Two non-V600 alterations 
(G469A and R671Q) were found.  
BRAF 
V600E 
 was mutually 
exclusive with oncogenic  
KRAS/NRAS 
 alterations and other 
established driver alterations ( 
Table 1 
). Among the 109 colo-
rectal NETs, alterations in  
NRAS 
 were observed in 2 of 109 
cases (1.8%), and  
KRAS 
 alterations occurred in a total of 35 of 
109 cases (32%). The mean age was 61.4 years, and BRAF alter-
ations were split between male and female patients and colon 
and rectal locations. The majority of  
BRAF 
-mutant samples 
(8/10) were of high-grade (grade 3) histologic appearance 
( 
Table 1 
).  
PIK3CA 
 
E545K and N1068fs*3 alterations occurred in 
cases 5 and 9, respectively ( 
Table 1 
). Other established onco-
genic genomic alterations and alterations in  
MLH1 
,  
MSH6 
, 
and  
MSH2 
 were not identifi
 ed.

RESEARCH BRIEF
improvement and tumor responses with a combination of 
BRAF- and MEK-directed therapies. 
 
The rectum is the most common site of NET involvement, 
comprising of 29% of all gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs 
( 
1 
). Outside of colorectal adenocarcinoma,  
BRAF 
 mutations 
(5%–9%) have not been described in tubular gastrointestinal 
malignancies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or the Cata-
logue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer (COSMIC) datasets. How-
ever, NETs are signifi
 cantly underrepresented, and true  
BRAF 
 
alteration frequency is likely underestimated. In our database 
including 109 colorectal NET samples, we identifi
 ed  
BRAF 
 
mutations at a frequency of 9%, with the vast majority being 
 
BRAF 
 
V600E 
. Our homogeneous series suggests that  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 
mutations are more common (9%) than previous limited stud-
ies of nonpancreatic NETs had indicated ( 
10, 12 
). Recently, a 
subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas with large-cell neuroen-
docrine features and signet ring cells in which  
BRAF 
 alterations 
may be enriched has been described, although the clinical 
impact is not known ( 
13 
). A review of our cases did not identify 
signet ring features. Our series represents the largest dataset 
of colorectal NETs subjected to comprehensive genomic pro-
fi
 ling and suggests that further clinical investigation with 
BRAF-directed therapies is warranted in high-grade colorectal 
NETs. Interestingly, alterations in  
KRAS/NRAS 
 were 34%, sig-
nifi
 cantly lower than the 45% to 53% incidence of  
KRAS/NRAS 
 
alterations reported from colorectal adenocarcinoma ( 
14, 15 
). 
Whether or not these frequencies suggest a shared origin with 
early evolutionary divergence is beyond the scope of our study. 
In our samples,  
BRAF 
 mutations and oncogenic  
KRAS 
 altera-
tions were mutually exclusive, consistent with observations in 
traditional colorectal adenocarcinoma. 
 
The rationale for the superiority of combined  
BRAF 
 and 
MEK inhibition over  
BRAF 
 monotherapy is well established 
in BRAF 
V600E 
-mutant melanoma ( 
16, 17 
). Recently, vemu-
rafenib monotherapy demonstrated benefi
 t across multiple 
tumor types, and the combination of BRAF–MEK inhibition 
in BRAF 
V600E 
 rare tumors is the subject of an ongoing study 
(NCT02034110; ref.  
18 
). However, vemurafenib monotherapy 
is not active in BRAF 
V600E 
 colorectal cancers owing to the rapid 
development of  
EGFR 
-mediated feedback MAPK reactivation 
( 
19, 20 
).  
BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer are commonly 
associated with right-sided lesions originating from serrated 
adenomas with high rates of hypermethylation and micro-
satellite instability, something not observed in our cases ( 
14, 
21 
). Recently, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib 
in  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
-mutant advanced colorectal cancer confi
 rmed a 
partial response rate of 12% (5/43) and one durable complete 
response ( 
22 
). Whether or not neuroendocrine features were 
present in the complete response observed by Corcoran and 
colleagues is not reported. Although limited by small numbers, 
both patient responses in our series occurred in patients with 
rectal high-grade NETs wild-type for  
KRAS, APC 
, and  
PIK3CA 
 
( 
Table 1 
). Although the  
BRAF 
 
G469A mutation is frequently 
observed in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is known 
to activate downstream MAPK signaling, the responsiveness to 
BRAF and MEK inhibition is not well studied ( 
23 
). Similarly, 
case 4 in our series harbors concurrent  
KRAS 
 
G12S 
 and  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 
mutations at a low MAF (1%). Recently, the  
KRAS 
 
G12S 
 mutation 
was shown to be non-tumorigenic in a pancreatic cancer model 
( 
24 
). More data are needed to determine the impact of concur-
rent exon 2  
KRAS 
 mutations on BRAF-inhibitor sensitivity in 
 
BRAF 
-mutant colorectal adenocarcinomas and high-grade colo-
rectal NETs ( 
24, 25 
). Despite sharing anatomic locations within 
the colon, our results are suggestive of signifi
 cant biologic 
differences between advanced colorectal adenocarcinomas and 
high-grade colorectal NETs. Functional validation in preclinical 
studies will be an important step in determining the behavior 
and genomic context of response in  
BRAF 
-mutant NET.

BRAF–MEK Responses in Colorectal Neuroendocrine Tumors
RESEARCH BRIEF
A levels that paralleled clinical resolution of symptoms and 
preceded radiologic response. Although the serum chro-
mogranin A never completely normalized, the correlation 
between serum chromogranin A, clinical improvement, and 
 
BRAF 
 
V600E urinary ctDNA detection (lower limit 0.03% MAF) 
provides early validation for the clinical utility of ctDNA test-
ing methodologies in monitoring of tumor dynamics ( 
26 
). 
Noninvasive methodologies allowing for molecular monitor-
ing will play an increasing role in future clinical care, particu-
larly in monitoring for drug resistance and early progression/
recurrence ( 
26 
). 
 
Recent data suggest that in  
BRAF 
 
V600E colorectal cancer, 
resistance to combination of BRAF–MEK may be mediated 
by acquired MEK1 ( 
MAP2K1 
) alterations (MEK1 
F53L 
; ref.  
27 
). 
Further work focusing on combination therapies and refi
 n-
ing understanding of resistance will be essential to optimize 
outcomes in rare tumors harboring  
BRAF alterations, includ-
ing our cases. 
 
Overall, our series underscores the oncogenic potential 
and therapeutic implications of BRAF-directed therapies in 
high-grade colorectal NETs and identifi
 es a new molecu-
larly defi
 ned disease subset. Although prospective validation 
through clinical trials is the optimal approach to confi
 rm our 
fi
 ndings, this was not available to either of our patients, and 
important issues surrounding off-label treatment costs are 
beyond the scope of this report. 
 
 
 
METHODS 
 
Next-Generation Sequencing Analysis of Tumor Biopsies 
 
DNA and RNA were extracted, and adaptor ligated sequencing 
libraries were captured by solution hybridization using custom 
bait-sets targeting 315 cancer-related genes and 28 frequently rear-
ranged genes by DNA sequencing (FoundationOne, Foundation 
Medicine). All captured libraries were sequenced to high depth 
(Illumina HiSeq) in a CLIA-certifi
 ed CAP-accredited laboratory 
(Foundation Medicine), averaging >500 
× for DNA. Sequence data 
from gDNA and cDNA were mapped to the reference human 
genome (hg19) and analyzed through a computational analysis 
pipeline to call genomic alterations present in the sample, including 
substitutions, short insertions and deletions, rearrangements, and 
copy-number variants. 
 
 
Identifi
 cation of BRAF Altered NET 
 
Following the identifi
 cation of  
BRAF 
V600E in the incident case 
(case 1), a large database containing comprehensive genomic pro-
fi
 ling sequencing data for over 55,000 clinical samples was ret-
rospectively interrogated to identify additional neuroendocrine 
patient samples. DNA sequences associated with clinical samples 
carrying a colorectal neuroendocrine diagnosis were analyzed for 
base substitutions, short insertions, deletions, gene copy-number 
alterations (focal amplifi
 cations and homozygous deletions), and 
gene fusions. Basic clinicopathologic characteristics were captured; 
however, treatment and disease response data were not available 
in all cases.

V600E was performed in a CLIA-certifi
 ed CAP-accredited labo-
ratory (Trovagene) as previously described ( 
28 
). Following urinary 
ctDNA extraction and quantitation, a two-step PCR assay targeting 
a very short (31 bp) amplicon was used to enhance detection of rare 
mutant alleles in ctDNA. The fi
 rst-step amplifi
 cation was done with 
two primers fl
 anking the  
BRAF 
 
V600 
 locus and a complementary block-
ing oligonucleotide, which suppressed wild-type  
BRAF 
 amplifi
 cation, 
achieving enrichment of the mutant  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 sequence. The sec-
ond step entailed a duplex ddPCR reaction using FAM ( 
BRAF 
 
V600E 
) 
and VIC (wild-type  
BRAF 
) TaqMan probes to enable quantifi
 cation 
of mutant versus wild-type fragments, respectively. The RainDrop 
ddPCR platform (Rain-Dance) was used for PCR droplet separa-
tion, fl
 uorescent reading, and counting droplets containing mutant 
sequence, wild-type sequence, or unreacted probe. For each patient 
sample, the assay identifi
 ed  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
-mutant fragments detected as 
a percentage of detected wild-type  
BRAF 
. Thresholds for  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 
detection were developed by evaluating a training set of urinary 
ctDNA from patients with  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 metastatic cancer (positives) 
and healthy volunteers (negatives) by applying a classifi
 cation tree 
algorithm that maximizes the true-positive and true-negative rates, 
yielding two threshold values (<0.05 not detected; 0.05–0.107 inde-
terminate; >0.107 detected; ref.  
25 
). A quantitative algorithm was 
applied to the CLIA test result to obtain the values for  
BRAF 
 
V600E 
 
allele frequencies. 
 
 
 
Patient Studies 
 
A review of available treatment options and detailed risk–ben-
efi
 t discussion was undertaken, and informed consent was obtained 
from both patients prior to treatment initiation. Patient care was 
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Study 
medications were obtained through insurance and/or the drug man-
ufacturer and monitored in accordance with the approved label. 
Treatment was conducted in the absence of Institutional Review 
Board approval.
