Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease: Lessons Learned and Applied
James E. Galvin, MD, MPH
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than 5 million
Americans, with substantial consequences for individuals
with AD, families, and society in terms of morbidity, mor-
tality, and healthcare costs. With disease-modifying treat-
ment trials unsuccessful at the present time and only
medications to treat symptoms available, an emerging
approach is prevention. Advances in diagnostic criteria,
biomarker development, and greater understanding of the
biophysiological basis of AD make these initiatives feasi-
ble. Ongoing pharmacological trials using anti-amyloid
therapies are underway in sporadic and genetic forms of
AD, although a large number of modifiable risk factors for
AD have been identified in observational studies, many of
which do not appear to exert effects through amyloid or
tau. This suggests that prevention studies focusing on risk
reduction and lifestyle modification may offer additional
benefits. Rather than relying solely on large-sample, long-
duration, randomized clinical trial designs, a precision
medicine approach using N-of-1 trials may provide more-
rapid information on whether personalized prevention
plans can improve person-centered outcomes. Because
there appear to be multiple pathways to developing AD,
there may also be multiple ways to prevent or delay the
onset of AD. Even if these precision approaches alone are
not successful in preventing AD, they may greatly improve
the likelihood of amyloid- or tau-specific therapies to reach
their endpoints by reducing comorbidities. Keeping this in
mind, dementia may be a disorder that develops over a
lifetime, with individualized ways to build a better brain
as we age. J Am Geriatr Soc 65:2128–2133, 2017.

A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than 5 million
Americans, with substantial costs to individuals with
AD, families, and society.1 Projections by the Alzheimer
Association are that, if nothing is done, by 2050, there will
be more than 16 million people with AD in the United
States and more than 60 million worldwide. Over the past
25 years, only five symptomatic medications have met
their primary clinical trial endpoints in Phase III clinical
trials and successfully come to market; of these, four are
still available. Since 2003, every symptom- and disease-
modifying agent has failed in Phase II or III trials because
of challenges with safety or efficacy. This led to a bold ini-
tiative put forth in the National Alzheimer Plan Act to
develop a disease-modifying treatment (DMT) by 2025.2
Two important concepts are associated with success to
reach this target date. First, only medications that have
already entered Phase II testing can make it to market by
2025.2 Second, if a DMT were available by 2025, then the
2050 projection of 16 million Americans with AD would
be reduced by 5.7 million cases, with societal savings of
$367 billion.1 To complement efforts to develop a DMT
for individuals with symptomatic AD, a concerted effort is
underway to initiate preventive measures in asymptomatic
individuals. Such efforts are also consistent with the 2025
target goal.
An important question, is whether AD can be pre-
vented. A large number of modifiable (e.g., exposures, life-
style and social habits) and nonmodifiable (e.g., age, sex,
genetics) risk factors have been identified (Table 1). Recent
revisions to the clinical criteria for AD3 and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI)4 helped clarify the role of biomarkers in
defining the pathological cascade, and the addition of
research criteria for presymptomatic disease5 sets the stage
for better modeling of the preclinical and prodromal stages
of disease.6 Efforts developing and validating fluid (blood
and cerebrospinal fluid) and imaging biomarkers make it
possible to explore underlying pathological changes in amy-
loid, tau, dopamine transport, inflammation, signaling path-
ways, and in the future, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 in
symptomatic, prodromal, and presymptomatic individuals.
Advances in genetic, epigenetic, and “omic” (e.g., pro-
teomic, lipidomic, metabolomic) approaches will permit the
modeling of transcriptional, translational, and posttransla-
tional changes. Furthermore, precision medicine approaches

 with demonstrable benefits in oncology are being applied to
neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the platform is in place
to begin prevention initiatives.
These efforts have a great potential for pharmaceutical
and nonpharmacological approaches, with earlier identifi-
cation of at-risk individuals, expanding opportunities for
faster and earlier diagnoses, better stratification of at-risk
individuals, higher enrollment into randomized clinical tri-
als (RCTs) by reducing screen failure rates, and eventually
more-effective treatments. Although the focus of this arti-
cle is on AD, the principles discussed are relevant to
related neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s dis-
ease, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia). Assuming
that curing AD remains a substantial unsolved challenge,
preventing or simply delaying the onset of dementia could
significantly change the face of disease.
PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO
PREVENTION
A number of prevention studies are ongoing in sporadic
and autosomal-dominant forms of AD. Results are still
pending, but a review of ClinicalTrials.gov7 provides
important details about these studies. One such study is
the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s
study, which is recruiting individuals aged 65 to 86 with
normal cognitive function but positive AD biomarkers
(amyloid deposition according to positron emission tomog-
raphy). These individuals are followed for 3 years of treat-
ment with an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody. The
Alzheimer Prevention Initiative will study individuals aged
60 to 75 with normal cognition who have two copies of
the apolipoprotein E e4 allele, putting them at high risk of
AD. These individuals are followed for 2 years of treat-
ment with a different anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody.
The TOMMORROW Study will enroll individuals aged
65 to 83 with normal cognition who have a polymorphism
of the TOMM40 gene that is associated with greater risk
of AD. Individuals are followed for 5 years of treatment
with pioglitazone, an anti-diabetes drug. In parallel to
these trials in sporadic cases with enhanced risk, trials are
ongoing in individuals with autosomal-dominant forms of
AD, including the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative and
Dominantly
Inherited
Alzheimer
Network—Treatment
Unit using monoclonal antibodies. A particular advantage
of the trials in familial AD is that age of onset is pre-
dictable so that, if a DMT effect exists, it is more likely to
be detected. A potential disadvantage of these trials is that
the results may not be generalizable to the much more
common sporadic forms in which risk factors other than
genetics may predominate.
Similar to prevention trials, there are number of pro-
dromal studies with a major focus on individuals with
MCI. Results are pending for many of these trials, but at
least one Phase II study had promising results. Adu-
canumab immunotherapy8 against the amyloid protein not
only demonstrated changes in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid
over 54 weeks in a dose-dependent manner, but also
demonstrated significant changes in cognitive and func-
tional measures. These findings support the concept that
there may be a critical window for these agents to be
administered to increase the likelihood of success.
LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION INTERVENTIONS
Modifiable Lifestyle Factors
A number of modifiable risk and preventive factors for AD
have been described in observational studies (Table 1).
Risk factors that have been found in several studies include
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal dysfunction, alcohol
and smoking patterns, high cholesterol, coronary heart dis-
ease, depression, sedentary life style, low cognitive activity,
and diet. These factors combined account for more than
half of the attributable risk for AD.9 The most difficult of
these factors to address is diet because it is highly depen-
dent on income and access to fresh foods.10 In a 16-year
observational study of 949 individuals using the Lifestyle
for Brain Health (LIBRA) measure of modifiable risk fac-
tors, a 1-point increase in LIBRA score was associated
with a 19% greater risk of dementia.11 In a metaanalyses
of 19 studies, cognitive leisure activities,12 including cross-
word puzzles, card games, computer use, arts and crafts,
life-long learning, group discussions, and music, had a pro-
tective effect (odds ratio (OR) = 0.58). In addition, physi-
cal activities may lead to a 20% to 65% risk reduction
depending on the type and intensity of activity through
mechanisms involving lower vascular disease risk, better
respiratory function, stimulation of trophic factors, and
lower oxidative stress and inflammation.13 Objective mea-
surement of midlife vascular risk factors demonstrated
greater risk of dementia in late life.14 In a study of 2,000

 individuals aged 71 to 78, work-related stress increased
the risk of MCI (OR = 1.38), dementia (OR = 1.53), and
AD (OR = 1.55).15
Despite the differences between countries of origin,
culture, language, educational attainment, and ages stud-
ied, the aforementioned studies and many others are con-
vergent for a short list of risk factors that seem to play a
critical role in the development or prevention of AD and
related disorders. This consistency has led to the imple-
mentation of a number of dementia prevention initiatives
to modify these risk factors, most of which cannot be
directly linked to amyloid or tau deposition.
Ongoing Prevention Initiatives
The European Prevention of AD16 initiative is recruiting
participants to examine whether alteration of risk factors
for AD that occur in early and mid-life potentiate patho-
physiological changes decades before dementia onset. The
Innovative Midlife Intervention for Dementia Deterrence
trial9 is examining 11 identified risk factors (e.g., diabetes,
hypertension, renal) that account for half of the attributa-
ble risk and has enrolled 600 individuals to participate in
an on-line education intervention. The largest initiative to
date is the FINGER study,17 enrolling 1,260 individuals in
an educational intervention that includes modules in diet,
exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk reduction.
Overall between-group differences were statistically signifi-
cant for global cognition, executive function, and process-
ing speed but not episodic memory.17 These results suggest
that lifestyle modification may offer some benefit in cogni-
tive function, albeit with a small effect size.
PRECISION MEDICINE APPROACHES TO
PREVENTION
Although age is the single greatest risk factor for AD, AD
is not inevitable. The best estimates suggest that, at age
85, there is 42% risk of developing AD,1 which means
that 58% of older adults do not develop dementia, even if
amyloid can be detected in the brain. The reasons are
unknown, but may be explained in part by a host of modi-
fiable and nonmodifiable risk factors (Table 1). Up to
30% of AD cases may be preventable through modifica-
tion of risk factors and behavioral changes to mitigate the
effect of those risk factors that are not modifiable.18 There
is an ongoing debate as to whether the current evidence
base is sufficient to initiate prevention programs because it
is difficult to prove causation from observational studies,
and it is difficult to pool multiple RCTs because of differ-
ences in study design, measurements used, and anticipated
outcomes.18 Although a well-balanced, healthy lifestyle
may be the cornerstone of disease prevention and brain
health, each risk factor (vascular, lifestyle choices, psy-
chosocial) may both act independently and potentiate the
effects of each other.19,20 Therefore, a prevention initiative
needs to be multimodal and tailored to address individual
risks.
These requirements lead to a number of design and
analytical challenges. Many prevention RCTs use time-to-
event analytical strategies to demonstrate a DMT effect.
Such
designs are optimal when
anticipated treatment
effects remain constant over time, but in the case of
dementia prevention, this is unknown. Thus, time-to-event
analyses such hazard ratios may not be the best way to
model effects, particularly if the detectable signal is a late
effect of the intervention.21 Because AD is heterogeneous
in terms of risk factors, age of onset, presentation, progres-
sion, and pathology burden, designing a study to treat
individuals as a homogenous population requires large
sample sizes (thousands to tens of thousands) to be fol-
lowed for long periods of time (years to decades).22 This
results in large study costs, staff burden, and participant
burden. In the absence of robust biomarkers that mark dis-
ease onset and progression, rather than just the presence
of pathology, RCT design will remain a challenge.23 Barri-
ers to prevention studies include limited understanding of
the real relationship between dementia risk factors and the
effect of risk reduction; complexity of the effect of life
course on dementia risk factors; lack of standardization of
study design, definitions, and outcomes; difficulty translat-
ing RCT findings into real-world practice; cultural and
social barriers to implementation; lack of research capacity
to enroll large research cohorts for long periods of time;
and pervasive social stigma associated with AD.18
Because
effective
prevention
strategies
are
elusive
despite significant advances in understanding of the biol-
ogy and pathophysiology of AD, an alternative approach
would be to take advantage of precision medicine designs
used in oncology trials to tailor interventions to an individ-
ual’s phenotypic and genotypic expression. With better
classification and phenotyping of individuals with AD,
trial-ready cohorts can be targeted more appropriately
with interventions (pharmacological and nonpharmacologi-
cal) designed to ameliorate specific pathological mecha-
nisms,
based
on
specific
biomarkers
and
individual
characteristics.23 Future trials could then be created to
determine efficacy and safety (fast to fail) more quickly by
moving away from one-size-fits-all approaches to person-
specific precision treatments.
This would also require rethinking trial design for pre-
vention measures, moving to more N-of-1 designs. N-of-1
trials consider the individual as the sole unit of observation
to study the efficacy and adverse effects of an interven-
tion22 and are guided by objective data-driven criteria
while leveraging the study designs and statistical tech-
niques common to RCTs.22 Because risk and molecular
profiles of AD vary widely by person, grouping individuals
into single entities (placebo vs treatment arm) may mix
“super-responders” with “nonresponders,” washing out
treatment effects that only become apparent in post hoc
analyses.24 Instead, comparing time-to-disease progression
of an individual using a novel therapeutic approach to the
time-to-disease progression for that same individuals for
the immediately preceding treatment paradigm may be
preferable.25 N-of-1 trials may be less bound by threats to
generalizability of large RCTs due to recruitment delays
and challenges to translate significant p-values in large
treatment groups to the care of an individual, which is the
ultimate goal of clinical practice. In a metaanalyses of
70 N-of-1 trials, 50 of 57 completed trials provided defini-
tive clinical or statistical answers, with 39% prompting
physicians to change the plan of care.26 Another metaanal-
ysis examined 108 trials involving 2,154 participants and
2130

 found that 54% of participants had subsequent treatment
decisions changed based on the results.27 To create the
platform for such trials, several conditions must be met
(Table 2). Participants must be deeply phenotyped with
characterization of sociodemographic, psychological, clini-
cal, cognitive, functional, biomarker, and genetic traits.
Ideally, these individuals would agree to be followed longi-
tudinally, have samples banked for future analyses, and
consent to autopsy to provide confirmation of diagnosis
and treatment effects on brain pathology. Statistical con-
siderations may take advantage of alternative time-series
analyses and within- and between-subject comparisons.
Lastly, an important concern is the cost of care when a
high-cost intervention is planned—for example, off-label
treatment with an expensive medication.22
EXAMPLE OF A PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
APPROACH TO DEMENTIA PREVENTION
As an example of how this may applied in a pragmatic
sense, N-of-1 trials are being developed to personalize
dementia prevention using an evidence-base derived from
an extensive literature review and results of a National
Institutes of Health–funded project to conduct dementia
screening in multicultural communities (R01 AG0402–11-
A1, study design reviewed28,29). In addition to screening
for cognitive impairment, broader medical screening for
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, vascular risk factors, obe-
sity, mobility, physical performance, frailty, and depression
was incorporated into a “healthy body, healthy mind”
approach to make the concept of dementia screening more
acceptable and to understand the effect of comorbid dis-
ease on cognitive performance. This cross-sectional study
confirmed many findings of observational studies regarding
the association between cognitive performance and dia-
betes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, vascular risk factors,
and depression while providing novel findings linking cog-
nitive performance to sarcopenia28 and mobility.29 These
collective findings were prospectively applied to develop
N-of-1 trials. For example, a 68-year-old college-educated
woman (although an actual case, some features were
altered to preserve anonymity) presented with a 1-year his-
tory of subjective memory complaints (misplacing car keys,
forgetting
conversations,
defensiveness
about
memory
issues) but with independent functioning in everyday activ-
ities. Her relevant past history was significant for hyper-
tension and hypercholesterolemia. Physical examination
findings included mild hypertension (blood pressure 132/
92 mmHg) but normal cardiac and peripheral vascular
examinations. Pertinent neurological findings included mild
symmetric weakness, poor vibration sensation in the lower
extremities, and mild postural instability. Cognitive testing
revealed global deficits (Montreal Cognitive Assessment
score 19/30), working memory and executive dysfunction,
and episodic memory deficits on list learning that disap-
peared with cued recognition. Physical and functional test-
ing revealed low lean muscle mass, at-risk nutritional
status, modest daily physical activity, mild deficits in phys-
ical functionality (Short Physical Performance Battery score
7/12), and mild frailty (Fried Frailty Phenotype Score 3/5).
Gait
and
balance
testing
revealed
slowed
gait
speed
(1.07 m/s), marked slowing (22.9%) with a dual-task chal-
lenge (walking while talking), and postural sway with eyes
closed. Blood-based biomarkers revealed an abnormal lipid
profile (high total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and
non–high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; high LDL
and small LDL particles; and low HDL particles), high
inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
and myeloperoxidase), apolipoprotein (Apo)E 3/4 geno-
type, and evidence of insulin resistance (high fasting glu-
cose,
glycosylated
hemoglobin,
and
estimated
average
glucose). Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
revealed normal hippocampal size and lateral ventricle vol-
ume but confluent white matter hyperintensities with fron-
tal lobe predominance. Auditory event–related potentials
demonstrated slow median reaction times and low ampli-
tude at the N200 peak (linked to impaired attention and
executive function) and left–right asymmetry with frontal
predominance
(linked
to
vascular
injury)
but
normal
amplitudes and latencies at all other peaks, including the
P50 peak associated with amyloid deposition.30 This deep

MRI
(preservation of hippocampal and cortical volume, exten-
sive white matter disease), and electroencephalography (ex-

could be treated and supported a diagnosis of vascular

then developed focusing on dietary counseling (Mediter-

 for stress reduction; cognitive exercise focusing on prob-
lem-solving skills; omega-3 supplementation and possible
resin therapy for cholesterol lowering; better blood pres-
sure monitoring; and initiation of low-dose aspirin to
improve blood flow. Longitudinal follow-up is needed to
monitor adherence to recommendations and for evidence
of improvement in outcomes. Such a trial could provide a
direct estimate of individual treatment effects, fine-tune
personalized care plans, enhance precision of future treat-
ment decisions, improve person-centered outcomes, and if
successful, reduce long-term healthcare costs.25
DISCUSSION
There is increasing evidence that multiple medical condi-
tions increase the risk of neurodegeneration and subse-
quent development of dementia (Figure 1). It is also
becoming clear that the majority of these risk factors act
in amyloid- and tau-independent ways. Trials testing the
amyloid hypothesis (b- and c-secretase inhibitors, antiag-
gregation medications, mono- and polyclonal antibody
approaches),
antiinflammatory
agents,
and
early-phase
anti-tau therapies have failed to meet outcomes or have
been discontinued because of safety concerns. While we
wait for successful pharmacotherapy, these multiple path-
ways leading to AD can be taken advantage of to test
hypotheses regarding risk reduction and mitigation. In all
likelihood, efforts to prevent cognitive decline and devel-
opment of dementia may be more successful when they are
multimodal and directed to at-risk individuals based on
their personal health profile, rather than using “one-size-
fits-all” approaches. The detection of and interventions
addressing root causes may offer novel approaches to diag-
nosing, treating, curing, or preventing AD. AD offers a
large array of potentially modifiable risk factors (lifestyle,
exposure, environment, comorbid disease) that are excel-
lent targets to personalize the approach to medical care.
Precision
medicine
approaches
specifically
target
the
heterogeneity of AD by identifying person-specific risk fac-
tors
and
applying
a
customized
intervention
directed
against this risk profile. Even if these precision approaches
do not cure or prevent AD, removing other pathways to
neurodegeneration may greatly improve the likelihood that
amyloid- or tau-specific therapies reach their endpoints.
Perhaps it is time to abandon generalized approaches to
AD and consider neurodegenerative disorders as diseases
of a lifetime and that there may be individualized ways to
build a better brain as we age.

Figure 1. Model of a dementia-prevention initiative. (A) Hypothetical model of the development of clinical dementia. Before
diagnosis, there would be evidence of cognitive decline, which reflects neurodegenerative changes including cellular dysfunction
and loss, synaptic dysfunction, and loss of connectivity. Presumably, accumulation of one or more pathologies cause these down-
stream changes. If more than one pathology is present, each should have its own risk factor or factors (e.g., Risk Factor A causes
Pathology A, Risk Factor B causes Pathology B). (B) Application of model in N-of-1 trial (described in detail in text). Six risk
factors were identified during the clinical evaluation, presumably working through different pathways, with the end result being
neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and if unchecked, eventually clinical dementia. A personalized prevention plan directed at
root causes of impairment, if successful, would prevent the conversion of cognitive decline to dementia (marked by X). Because
root causes may interact or potentiate each other’s effect on neurodegeneration (connecting arrows on the left side), multimodal
approaches are more likely to have an effect than single approaches. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
