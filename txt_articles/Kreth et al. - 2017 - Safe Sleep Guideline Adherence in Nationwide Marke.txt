abstract
BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome and sleep-related sudden unexpected infant 
death remain leading causes of infant mortality in the United States despite 4 safe sleep 
guideline restatements over the previous 24 years. Advertising and retail crib displays 
often promote infant sleep environments that are counter to the most recent American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines.
METHODS: Magazine advertisements featuring sleep in parenting magazines from 1992, 
2010, and 2015 were reviewed for adherence. Crib displays from nationwide retailers were 
surveyed for adherence to the latest AAP safe sleep guidelines. The primary outcome was 
adherence to the guidelines.
RESULTS: Of 1758 retail crib displays reviewed, only half adhered to the latest AAP guidelines. 
The most common reasons for nonadherence were the use of bumper pads and loose 
bedding. The depiction of infant cribs and sleep products in magazine advertising has 
become significantly more adherent over time; however, 35% of current advertisements 
depict nonadherent, unsafe sleep environments. Magazine advertising portraying safe sleep 
environments revealed racial and ethnic disparities.
CONCLUSIONS: Although improvements have been made over time with increased adherence to 
AAP safe sleep guidelines, significant deficiencies remain. Advertising continues to depict 
unsafe sleep environments. Crib manufacturers and retail establishments continue to 
market and sell bedding and sleep products considered unsafe by the AAP in approximately 
half of retail crib displays. Pediatric and public health care providers should continue 
educational and advocacy efforts aimed at the public, but should also include retailers, 
manufacturers, and advertising professionals to foster improved sleep environments for all 
children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: There have been 
few published studies examining the marketing of 
infant cribs and products for adherence to the most 
recent American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep 
guidelines. Retail marketing often includes items that 
are not adherent to the guidelines.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the fi
 rst survey of 
infant cribs and product marketing with respect 
to safe sleep guideline adherence since the 2011 
American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. These 
data may inform health care providers and help tailor 
future policy and advocacy efforts.

KRETH et al 
In 1992, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) first released 
recommendations that all infants 
should be placed in a supine position 
for sleep to lower the incidence 
of sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS). 
1 After revisions in 1996 and 
2005, the guidelines were expanded in 
2011 to address sudden unexpected 
infant deaths (SUID) during sleep. 
2 
– 
4 
Despite these official statements, 
SIDS/SUID remains the leading cause 
of infant mortality in the United 
States for children 1 month to 1 year 
of age according to the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.5 
After the initial publication of the AAP 
safe sleep recommendations in 1992, 
the rate of SIDS/SUID in the United 
States decreased from 1.2 per 1000 
live births to 0.56 per 1000 live births, 
where it has remained. 
4, 
 
6 
– 
8 More than 
95% of infant deaths attributed to 
SIDS/SUID are associated with ≥1 
modifiable risk factors.9 Over the 
ensuing 2 decades, there has been 
increasing awareness of, and national 
attention directed at, strategies to 
decrease these preventable deaths. 
Such efforts have included changing 
hospital practices, instituting parent/
caregiver education programs, 
information campaigns, and 
substantive public health efforts. 
10 
– 
12 
Despite these recommendations and 
public health efforts, unsafe sleep 
practices have continued. 
13, 
14
Although most pediatricians counsel 
parents on safe sleep practices, the 
total amount of time spent with a 
primary care provider during a well-
child visit is brief compared with the 
amount of time parents are exposed 
to advertising for infant products. 
A recent survey on the duration of 
well-child checks showed that 33.6% 
of visits were <10 minutes long, 
whereas 47.1% were between 11 and 
20 minutes long. 
15 Although there are 
no published data showing the length 
of time parents spend shopping for 
infant sleep-related products, it is 
likely >20 minutes. According to the 
third edition of the Bright Futures 
guidelines, anticipatory guidance 
on safe sleep is just one of >20 
suggested topics to cover during the 
prenatal visit, the newborn visit, and 
the 1-week visit. 
16 The advertising 
onslaught parents experience while 
shopping for infant cribs or reading 
parent-oriented magazines easily 
eclipses the brief safe sleep advice 
received from primary care providers 
during these visits.
The socioecological model endorsed 
by the National Action Partnership to 
Promote Safe Sleep recognizes that 
the normative beliefs of others and 
societal pressures influence parents 
and caregivers. 
17 Advertisements 
by crib manufacturers, national 
retailers, and magazines directed 
at parents are sources of societal 
pressure. Despite at least 1 national 
effort by a major advertising trade 
association to portray safe sleep 
environments adherent to the 
most recent AAP guidelines in the 
marketing of infant sleep-related 
products, 
 
18 such advertising 
continues to show nonadherent sleep 
environments.
The purpose of this study is to 
examine the online, print, and 
physical marketing of infant cribs 
and sleep environments by major 
retailers for adherence to the AAP 
safe sleep guidelines. We postulated 
that there would be a trend toward 
more guideline-adherent sleep 
depicted in parent-oriented magazine 
advertisements after the original 
guideline introduction and improving 
guideline adherence seen over time. 
We hypothesized that there would 
be significant differences in guideline 
adherence among retail settings and 
that more expensive cribs would be 
less adherent to the AAP safe sleep 
recommendations due to the addition 
of bedding or bumper pads in their 
displays.
METHODS
A member of the University of 
Alabama at Birmingham Institutional 
Review Board reviewed the 
research protocol and approved 
the project as not human research. 
The investigators reviewed print 
advertisements from a nationally 
distributed parenting magazine, 
with a monthly circulation of >10 
million readers, for depictions of 
safe sleep in the advertisements. Six 
consecutive issues from 3 temporal 
cohorts were chosen a priori for 
assessment: preceding the initial 
1992 sleep guidelines, before the 
most recent guideline restatement 
in 2011, and the current year. All 
advertisements in these cohorts 
were reviewed, totaling 1893 ads 
across the 3 cohorts. Information 
collected from each advertisement 
included company, product, whether 
sleep was featured, and whether the 
sleep environment portrayed was 
adherent to the 2011 guidelines. Data 
on the race of portrayed adults and 
children were gathered. The race 
of subjects portrayed was analyzed 
by a 2-reviewer visual assessment 
of the advertisement. If agreement 
was not reached, the race was 
considered indeterminate. Analysis 
focused on advertisements depicting 
sleep and featuring children <1 
year of age. Two investigators 
independently reviewed and 
scored all advertisements depicting 
sleep. Scoring discrepancies were 
resolved by an open review of the 
advertisement by the research team.
The research team performed a 
comprehensive review of infant 
crib retail displays across multiple 
settings. The physical in-store 
displays as well as the online crib 
displays for 11 national retail 
establishments were chosen for 
assessment a priori and were 
classified as “big box” retail 
establishments, “warehouse club” 
establishments, baby-specific 
retailers, department stores, and 
furniture stores. The 2011 AAP policy 
statement was used to develop a 
standardized review form consisting 
of a 6-question checklist that

determined each crib’s adherence to 
the guidelines. Specific questions are 
detailed in  
Table 1. Information was 
gathered on the crib manufacturer, 
model, price, the retail store 
classification as listed above, and 
whether the display was online or in 
a physical store. One local store from 
each national brand was chosen and 
every physical in-store crib display 
as well as every crib displayed on 
that store’s national Web site were 
reviewed by 1 of 2 reviewers. These 
reviewers independently assessed 
the same store (108 cribs total) to 
assess for validity and reproducibility 
of their results.
All data were entered into a 
FileMaker 13 Advanced database 
(FileMaker, Inc, Santa Clara, 
CA). Descriptive statistical 
analysis (histograms and quartile 
determination) was performed. 
Nonparametric continuous data were 
analyzed by using the Kruskal–Wallis 
test. Nominal data were analyzed 
by using the χ2 test. In instances 
where the sample size was deemed 
too small to use χ2, Fisher’s exact 
test was used. Interrater reliability 
was assessed by using Cronbach’s α. 
Statistical analysis and visualization 
were performed by using 
commercially available software, 
GraphPad Prism version 6.0e for Mac 
(GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA) and 
Aabel version 3.0 (GigaWiz, Tulsa, 
OK). Two-sided P values < .05 were 
deemed significant.
RESULTS
Investigators analyzed a total of 
1893 print advertisements: 767 
from the 1991–1992 cohort, 698 
from the 2010–2011 cohort, and 
428 from the 2015–2016 cohort. 
The total number of advertisements 
declined in the most recent 
magazine cohort with 44.2% fewer 
advertisements compared with the 
1991–1992 cohort (P < .001). Only 95 
advertisements featured sleep, cribs, 
or bedding in any form, and only 
66 depicted sleep or sleep-related 
products for children estimated 
to be <1 year of age (3.5% of total 
advertisements reviewed). Overall, 
the percentage of advertisements 
depicting safe sleep has improved 
significantly over time ( 
Fig 1).
White children were featured 
most often in advertisements 
overall, occurring in 93.6% of 
all advertisements with children 
present, whereas nonwhite 
children were depicted in 34.0% 
of all advertisements with children 
present. Indeterminate race 
comprised 7.6% of all advertisements 
featuring sleep in children <1 year 
of age. In the 1991–1992 cohort, 
there were 2 advertisements 
featuring children with adherent 
sleep environments for which race 
could not be determined. When 
race was able to be determined, 
safe sleep was far more likely to 
be shown using white children 
versus nonwhite children (P = 
.028). Excluding the advertisements 
depicting children of indeterminable 
race, guideline-adherent sleep was 
only depicted with white children. 
Out of the 1893 advertisements 
reviewed, no children identified from 
underrepresented minorities were 
featured in any guideline-adherent 
sleep advertisements ( 
Fig 2).
Advertisements were reviewed 
to determine the sleep position of 
children featured in the images. Only 
54% of advertisements featuring 
a sleeping child not being held by 
an adult depicted the child asleep 
in the supine position. There was 
no significant difference in the 
rates of supine sleep position in 
advertisements before or after the 
publication of the AAP Safe Sleep 
Guidelines, with 57% of children 
depicted sleeping supine in the 
1991–1992 cohort compared with 
61.5% in the 2011–2012 cohort and 
40% in the 2015–2016 cohort.
Researchers reviewed a total of 
1758 individual crib displays from 
11 nationwide chain stores from 
both in-store physical displays

and online displays as outlined in 
 
Table 2. Cronbach’s α for interrater 
reliability was 0.927. Although 
online crib displays far outnumbered 
the physical store displays, overall 
guideline adherence was not 
significantly different between the 
in-store and online displays, with 
51.1% of cribs overall adherent to the 
guidelines. Big box retail stores were 
more likely to be guideline-adherent 
than any other category at 55.1% 
adherence (P = .035). Warehouse 
clubs were the most likely to be 
nonadherent (61.1% nonadherent). 
Almost half of all crib displays 
reviewed (48.9%) were deemed 
unsafe as infant sleep environments 
based on the AAP guidelines.
Crib price correlated with adherence 
to the safe sleep recommendations. 
Crib prices ranged from $99.98 
to $2200 for the most expensive 
complete nursery furniture set that 
included a crib. The median price for 
a crib purchased online was $250 
compared with $399 for physical 
stores (P < .001). When cribs were 
analyzed by price quartile, there was 
a statistically significant difference 
(P < .001) with more adherent cribs 
in the mid-range pricing and more 
nonadherent cribs being in the most 
and least expensive quartiles ( 
Fig 3).
The presence of bumper pads in 
the advertised cribs (70.2% of 
nonadherent cribs) was the most 
common reason for guideline 
nonadherence, followed by 
inclusion of loose bedding (55.7% of 
nonadherent cribs), and soft objects 
in the crib (12.9% of nonadherent 
cribs). Physical stores were more 
likely to have crib displays that 
were nonadherent because of loose 
bedding and soft objects in the crib 
than online displays. Online images 
were more likely to display bumper 
pads in use compared with physical 
stores (P < .001). When analyzed 
by price quartile, the least and most 
expensive cribs were more likely to 
have bumper pads (P = .008) and 
loose bedding (P = .002) than the 
mid-range priced cribs. The most 
expensive cribs were more likely to 
have soft objects present in them 
compared with the other quartiles 
(P < .001).
DISCUSSION
By examining magazine 
advertisements, we were able to 
assess changes in marketing over 
time. Although the total number 
of advertisements decreased 
over this time frame by ∼44%, 
the percentage of advertisements 
featuring sleep in children <1 year 
of age remained stable at 3% to 4% 
of advertisements. In the 24 years 
since the publication of the original 
guideline, advertisement content 
featuring sleep environments has 
changed significantly. Before the 
publication of the initial safe sleep 
guidelines in 1992, only 23.1% of 
advertisements depicting a sleep 
environment were adherent. By 2010 
to 2011, 34.7% of advertisements 
including a sleep environment were 
adherent. In the most recent cohort, 
64.7% of advertisements depicting 
sleep were adherent to the AAP safe 
sleep recommendations. This is a

significant shift (P = .021) and likely 
reflects the continued advocacy by 
the AAP, pediatricians, and other 
health care professionals. Our study 
expands on the work described by 
Joyner et al 
19 in their 2008 review of 
images of sleep environments in 28 
magazines with large readership of 
women of child-bearing age. Their 
study demonstrated that 36.4% of 
sleep environments shown were 
adherent to the latest AAP guidelines 
available at the time. Their findings 
included images from articles, not 
just advertisements, possibly leading 
to greater adherence in their study 
compared with the 2010–2011 
cohort described in this study. Joyner 
did not assess the changes over 
time, which we have shown to be 
significant.
The racial/ethnic disparities 
observed in the advertisement of 
safe sleep are of particular concern. 
Among advertisements in which the 
race of the child could be determined, 
the adherent sleep environments 
only featured white children. In 
contrast, nonwhite children were 
depicted in 18.5% of advertisements, 
all showing unsafe sleep 
environments. The lack of guideline-
adherent sleep environments in 
advertising depicting minority 
children is alarming considering 
that infants of non-Hispanic, African-
American mothers had more than 
double the rate of death by SIDS/
SUID when compared with all race 
mortality. 
20 The reason for this 
disparity is unclear, but the overall 
number of children shown in unsafe 
sleep environments in present day 
advertising demonstrates the need 
for ongoing education and advocacy 
on behalf of all children, especially 
for children from underrepresented 
minorities.
A 2014 study by Gaydos et al 
21 of 92 
African-American mothers and 20 
health care providers outlines the 
understanding of and reasons for 
nonadherence to the AAP safe sleep 
guidelines among this community. 
They note “almost universally, 
both mothers and providers stated 
that mothers understand the 
content of the AAP safe sleeping 
recommendations.” 
21 All mothers 
in this study had either a crib or 
a bassinet available to them to 
use; however, 96.7% of mothers 
in the study reported unsafe sleep 
environments for their infants. 
Gaydos et al 
21 demonstrate that 
more than counseling by providers 
is needed to reach this at-risk 
population; the cultural norm of safe 
infant bedding needs to change.
Overall, a slight majority of marketed 
cribs were adherent to the AAP safe 
sleep recommendations. Big-box 
retail establishments and department 
store physical crib displays were 
100% guideline-adherent ( 
Table 2). 
This finding was in contrast to the 
in-store displays for furniture stores 
and baby-specific retailers, who had 
far less adherence. We hypothesized 
that baby-specific stores would be 
less likely to be guideline-adherent 
compared with other store types due 
to these stores attempting to increase 
sales of bedding, bumper pads, 
and soft toys. Both baby-specific 
and furniture stores marketed 
a significant number of bedding 
accessories under their store’s own 
brand that increased the inclusion 
of nonadherent items in their 
displays. Department and big box 
stores may not focus on marketing 
these nonadherent items or may be 
adopting and promoting the AAP’s 
safe sleep message. Regardless of 
the reason, they deserve a special 
mention for 100% in-store guideline 
adherence.
The majority of online crib displays 
used stock images provided by 
the manufacturers and, therefore, 
reflected the manufacturer’s display 
preferences. Stores that sold their 
own brand of cribs did not follow 
this pattern. There was 1 store that 
allowed parents and other reviewers 
to submit user-generated photos. 
These reviews and photos were then 
approved by the individual store 
before they were posted online and 
so were included in our analysis.
The inclusion of bumper pads, loose 
bedding, and soft objects in the crib 
were the most common reasons 
for displays to be nonadherent. 
In physical stores, 95.8% of 
nonadherent cribs had loose 
bedding included in the display. The 
removal of these items from retail 
crib displays would convert the 
5

found to be $250.00. The 25th percentile was $194.50 and the 75th percentile was $350.00.

KRETH et al 
majority of nonadherent displays to 
safe sleep environments. Shapiro-
Mendoza et al 
13 demonstrated that 
more than half of mothers reported 
using some form of loose bedding 
with their sleeping infants. Although 
Shapiro-Mendoza et al 
13 showed an 
improving trend away from bedding 
use with time, the declines seen with 
other racial groups stagnated among 
black infants. The presence of loose 
bedding in retail displays only serves 
to normalize their use. Due to their 
continued high prevalence, pediatric 
and public health care providers 
should target loose bedding and 
bumper pads for discussion with 
parents, manufacturers, and retailers.
Limitations of this study include the 
review of only 1 parent-oriented 
magazine. We were able to find 
only 1 parent-oriented magazine 
that was continuously published 
throughout the time span assessed. 
We postulate that this magazine has 
a majority white readership that may 
skew the advertisements included. 
Bias of magazine advertisers may 
help to explain the limited number 
of minority children featured in 
advertising, because companies 
likely focus advertisements to match 
the subscriber demographics. Due 
to the limitations of some print 
advertisements, we were unable to 
determine the race of every child <1 
year of age featured, which may have 
affected the analysis.
The review of in-store crib displays 
was limited by the inclusion of only 
a single store of each national chain 
in 1 geographic region. Because 
these were national chain stores, the 
displays in each store should adhere 
to the standards of the national store 
brand; however, this may vary from 
store to store and by geographic 
region. The review of online crib 
displays was limited by the stock 
images manufacturers provided 
to each retailer. Stores that sold 
cribs that were not manufactured 
under their own store brand used 
images of the cribs supplied by 
the manufacturers, which may not 
represent the sleeping environment 
that the stores wish to promote. 
However, each store is advertising 
using these images and is reflective 
of the sleep environment that is 
being portrayed to consumers 
and parents.
Finally, the study did not assess the 
type of soft object in the crib and so 
was unable to address the percentage 
of cribs that contained pillows or 
blankets. These objects have been 
associated with an increased risk of 
SIDS/SUID and should be evaluated 
in subsequent studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Although much has improved 
in terms of safe sleep guideline 
adherence in advertising over the 
years, much more is still left to 
be done. Almost 40% of current 
advertisements featuring sleep in 
children <1 year of age continue to 
show unsafe sleep environments 
as defined by the AAP and 60% 
of these advertisements depict 
infants sleeping in nonsupine 
positions. Almost half of all online 
and in-store crib displays featured 
items specifically mentioned by the 
AAP as not recommended in a safe 
sleep environment. Although the 
recommendations have clearly made 
an impact over time, the message has 
not been adopted by all. Parents are 
likely to hear about safe sleep from 
their providers during office visits, 
but as one of >20 recommended 
topics to be discussed in early visits, 
 
16 
this discussion can be easily 
overshadowed by what parents see 
when shopping for cribs or reading 
parent-oriented magazines. The 
lack of safe sleep in advertising 
depicting underrepresented 
minority children along with the 
high incidence of SIDS/SUID in this 
population makes messaging for this 
population a priority. The AAP and 
public health care providers need 
to broaden current educational and 
advocacy efforts beyond parents and 
caregivers to include advertisers, 
stores, and crib manufacturers. 
By doing this, we may change the 
advertisements that shape societal 
norms of what an infant sleep 
environment should look like to 
ensure a safe place to sleep for all 
children.
