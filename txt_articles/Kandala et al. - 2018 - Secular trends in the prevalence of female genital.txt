background Current evidence on the decline in the 
prevalence of female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C) 
has been lacking worldwide. This study analyses the 
prevalence estimates and secular trends in FGM/C over 
sustained periods (ie, 1990–2017). Its aim is to provide 
analytical evidence on the changing prevalence of FGM/C 
over time among girls aged 0–14 years and examine 
geographical variations in low-income and middle-income 
countries.
Methods Analysis on the shift in prevalence of FGM/C was 
undertaken using the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 
and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data sets 
from Africa and Middle East. A random-effects model was 
used to derive overall prevalence estimates. Using Poisson 
regression models, we conducted time trends analyses on 
the FGM/C prevalence estimates between 1990 and 2017.
Findings We included 90 DHS and MICS data sets for 
208 195 children (0–14 years) from 29 countries spread 
across Africa and two countries in Western Asia. The 
prevalence of FGM/C among children varied greatly 
between countries and regions and also within countries 
over the survey periods. The percentage decline in the 
prevalence of FGM/C among children aged 0–14 years 
old was highest in East Africa, followed by North and West 
Africa. The prevalence decreased from 71.4% in 1995 to 
8.0% in 2016 in East Africa. In North Africa, the prevalence 
decreased from 57.7% in 1990 to 14.1% in 2015. In West 
Africa, the prevalence decreased from 73.6% in 1996 to 
25.4% in 2017. The results of the trend analysis showed 
a significant shift downwards in the prevalence of FGM/C 
among children aged 0–14 years in such regions and 
subregions of East Africa, North Africa and West Africa. 
East Africa has experienced a much faster decrease in the 
prevalence of the practice (trend=−7.3%, 95% CI −7.5% 
to −7.1%) per year from 1995 to 2014. By contrast, the 
decline in prevalence has been much slower in North Africa 
(trend=−4.4%, 95% CI −4.5% to −4.3%) and West Africa 
(trend=−3.0%, 95% CI −3.1% to −2.9%).
Conclusion The prevalence of FGM/C among children 
aged 0–14 years varied greatly between countries and 
regions and also within countries over the survey periods. 
There is evidence of huge and significant decline in the 
prevalence of FGM/C among children across countries 
and regions. There is a need to sustain comprehensive 
intervention efforts and further targeted efforts in countries 
and regions still showing high prevalence of FGM/C among 
children, where the practice is still pervasive.
InTroduCTIon
Recent estimates show that more than 200 
million women and children around the 
world have undergone female genital muti-
lation and cutting (FGM/C).1 2 All the avail-
able data clearly refer to Africa and some 
Middle Eastern regions (including Iraq and 
Yemen) as areas where the practice is particu-
larly most prevalent. Further findings from 
recent global research revealed the existence 
Key questions
What is already known?
 
► Female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C) is high-
ly concentrated in many low-income and middle-in-
come countries (LMICs), particularly in Africa and 
Western Asia.
 
► The practice is viewed as a child abuse and a gross 
violation of children’s and women’s human rights, 
and is deemed unlawful by many countries and con-
demned by many organisations.
 
► It has devastating health consequences especially in 
terms of sexual, childbirth and mental health.
What are the new findings?
 
► The prevalence of FGM/C among children varied 
greatly between countries and regions and also 
within countries over the survey periods.
 
► We found evidence of significant decline in the prev-
alence of FGM/C in the last three decades among 
children aged 0–14 years in most of the countries 
and regions, particularly in East, North and West 
Africa.
 
► We show that the picture looks different in Western 
Asia, where the practice remains and affects the 
same age group.
What do the new findings imply?
 
► Evidence-based policies targeting socioeconomic 
and cultural support for children at risk of FGM/C in 
LMICs should be pursued vigorously.
 
► Appropriate research design, data collection and 
interventions containing religious and culturally sen-
sitive elements remain an important public health 
policy priority.

of such a practice in India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, 
Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. Likewise, data 
from censuses and household and hospital records indi-
cate that FGM/C constitutes a massive global health 
challenge in the sense that the high burden of FGM/C 
is clearly not confined to African and Middle Eastern 
countries, but extends to Europe and North and South 
America, especially as a result of migration.2–6 Incidents 
of FGM/C in the Western world are reported particu-
larly from among asylum seekers and immigrants who 
have moved from regions where FGM/C is practised in 
order to settle in developed countries.3–6 Those who live 
in Africa have been affected by the practice as a result 
of socioeconomic and cultural issues. Thus, there is an 
emerging consensus that more than three million chil-
dren in Africa are now at risk each year.7 In the present 
paper, we first offer an analytical picture of the esti-
mates on the prevalence of FGM/C and identify secular 
trends limiting the study population to young girls aged 
0–14 years in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs).
The ultimate aim of this study is to inform deci-
sion-making processes and influence policy responses 
and public health intervention across many geographical 
regions and countries sharing the same socioeconomic 
and cultural backgrounds (such as unemployment level, 
level of education, and religion and ethnicity). The 
focus on these backgrounds is accounted for by a large 
number of selected regions in which well-tailored inter-
vention programmes may be necessary to combat the 
practice.
Accurate, up-to-date information on the prevalence 
of FGM/C among children is necessary for the devel-
opment of national and international health policies 
for prevention of this practice, and would allow inter-
national public health policy-makers to assign sufficient 
priority and resources to its prevention. Although there 
are existing systematic reviews and reports on current 
prevalence estimates of FGM/C emanating from most 
international agencies,8–14 there are no pooled analyses 
of nationally representative survey data to examine the 
burden of FGM/C among children. Children aged 0–14 
years were considered in this review partly because we 
wanted to understand whether the years-long campaigns 
on FGM/C among mothers have an impact on the reduc-
tion in the prevalence among their children, as children 
are relatively too young to understand what is best for 
themselves, compared with their adult women coun-
terparts who, on personal, cultural and socioeconomic 
grounds, may engage in FGM/C. To fill this research 
gap, we therefore systematically gathered all survey data 
sets to assess (1) the contemporary prevalence estimates 
of FGM/C among children aged 0–14 years; (2) whether 
there is significant downward trend in the prevalence 
estimates or not; and (3) whether the burden of FGM/C 
among children varies across different geographical 
regions.
MeTHods
study design and data
We used data from the Demographic Health Survey 
(DHS) as developed by ICF International and the 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) directed by 
Unicef. ICF International and Unicef provide tech-
nical assistance to countries conducting these national 
surveys. The two surveys are highly comparable and the 
technical teams developing and supporting them are in 
close collaboration. Both DHS and MICS surveys provide 
national representative data of households and estimates 
of adult women and children. This study examines the 
secular trends in the prevalence of FGM/C, focusing 
on countries where DHS/MICS data are available and 
on regions which significantly contribute to the global 
prevalence in FGM/C. Evidence suggests that interna-
tional response has targeted such countries on account 
of the high prevalence observed in FGM/C practice or 
based on the number of women and girls at risk. This is 
the case despite evidence that prevalence may be low in 
those regions. Among other things, the DHS and MICS 
survey data sets give details about the health and well-
being of children as well as women in countries affected 
by FGM/C practices. The surveys used a two-stage cluster 
and probability sampling design, with oversampling of 
certain categories of respondents. In the first stage, ‘clus-
ters’ were selected from larger regional units within coun-
tries using sample weights techniques to obtain nation-
ally representative estimates of indicators. Subsequently, 
the second stage of sampling, which involved the system-
atic sampling of households from the selected enumer-
ation areas, was carried out. Data collection procedures 
and response rates for all DHS and MICS surveys were all 
published in each survey report.
The data sets on FGM/C are available in 29 countries 
spread across five United Nations subregions. Based on 
nationally representative samples of women and chil-
dren, these surveys produce data that make it possible to 
calculate both the FGM/C prevalence and secular trends 
at both the national and subregional levels. In many of 
the targeted countries, more recent surveys have been 
produced.15–18 In order to provide an accurate and reli-
able estimate of the current FGM/C practices in these 
countries and regions, we searched the DHS and MICS 
databases (without restriction on language or date of 
publication) to look for FGM/C data on women and 
their daughters or children.
statistical analysis
Meta-analysis of FGM/C prevalence estimates
Apparent prevalence estimates were computed using 
the total reported number of children who have under-
gone FGM/C in each country. The overall prevalence of 
FGM/C was pooled and compared by proportion across 
countries and regions using a meta-analysis technique. 
Before making such a move, we used the Freeman-Tukey 
variant of the arcsine square root transformed propor-
tion suitable for pooling.19 This was necessary to stabilise

the raw proportions of children who have undergone 
FGM/C from each of the included data.20 Thereafter, the 
DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used 
to summarise the data.21

where p represents the proportion (percentage) of chil-

the sample surveyed. The final pooled logit results and 
95% CIs were transformed back into proportion for ease 
of interpretation using the following:
 
P =

(4)
To assess the variation percentage across surveys, we 
inspected the forest plot and used the χ2 test and the I2 
statistics.22 The result was presented as a forest plot with 
95% CIs expressed in percentage. Study-level influence 
on the estimated FGM/C prevalence was also evalu-
ated using study-level characteristics such as survey year, 
survey country, survey period and the type of survey 
(DHS/MICS) in a univariate and multivariate meta-re-
gression. We used a significance level of 0.05 for p values 
in all statistical analyses. The bulk of data analysis was 
conducted using Stata V.14 for Windows. This study was 
conducted and reported in line with the Meta-analysis of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline.23
Secular trend analysis
Using Poisson regression models, we conducted time 
trends analyses on the FGM/C prevalence estimates 
between 1990 and 2017. Regression analyses were 
conducted using annual data on prevalence, with girls 
who have been mutilated as the outcome and the survey 
calendar year as the predictor. This method allows for 
estimation of time trends across individual calendar 
years to obtain the average annual percentage change 
(AAPC), depending on whether the rate of change over 
the previous year is constant.24 The Poisson regression 
procedure fits a model of the following form:
 
Log (Casesy) = b0 + b1y + log (sample size) 
 
(1)
where ‘cases’ equals the number of FGM/C cases 
reported per year, ‘log’ is the natural log, b0 is the inter-
cept, b1 is the trend and y is the year. In the equation, 
each year is represented by 0, 1, 2……14 (where year 0 
is 1990, year 1 is 1991 and so on until 2017). The log of 
‘sample size’ was subsequently entered as the offset. The 
AAPC was calculated using the following formula:
 
AAPC = (eb1 − 1) × 100 
 
(2)
We also chose to meta-estimate one temporal trend 
from all the studies, accounting for correlations among 
multiple time intervals within studies.25 This indicates 
that the number of time points for which FCM/C was esti-
mated varied across studies, and some of these included 
only one time point.

description of included survey data sets
The countries, year of data collection and the survey 
characteristics are listed in table 1. The surveys were 
conducted between 1990 and 2017. This analysis 
included 90 DHS and MICS data sets for 208 195 chil-
dren (0–14 years) from 29 countries spread across Africa 
and two countries in Western Asia. Most of the surveys 
were DHS (n=55) and 35 were MICS. Most of the surveys 
were from West Africa (n=54), followed by East Africa 
(n=17), North Africa (n=10), Central Africa (n=6) and 
Western Asia (n=3) (figure 1). The highest numbers of 
surveys were conducted in Nigeria (n=7), Senegal (n=7) 
and Mali (n=6).
Variations in prevalence of FGM/C among children by country 
and geographical regions
The prevalence of FGM/C among children and the 95% 
CIs from individual countries with a pooled estimate 
are shown in online supplementary figure 1 for Central 
Africa, online supplementary figure 2 for East Africa, 
online supplementary figure 3 for North Africa, online 
supplementary figure 4 for West Africa and online supple-
mentary figure 5 for Western Asia, and are summarised 
in table 1. In Central Africa, the FGM/C ‘annualized 
year average’ was highest for Chad (13.9%), followed by 
Central Africa Republic (3.0%) and Cameroon (0.7%). 
The FGM/C ‘annualized year average’ ranged from 2.0% 
(Kenya) to 67.0% (Eritrea) in East Africa; from 28.4% 
(Egypt) to 41.9% (Sudan) in North Africa.
secular trend in the prevalence of FGM/C among children 
aged 0–14 years
Table 2 and figure 2 show the trends in the prevalence of 
FGM/C among children within the 0–14 age range who 
have been subjected to FGM/C. The percentage decline 
in the prevalence of FGM/C among children aged 0–14 
years old was highest in East Africa, followed by North 
and West Africa. The prevalence decreased from 71.4% 
in 1995 to 8.0% in 2016 in East Africa. In North Africa, 
the percentage decreased from 57.7% in 1990 to 14.1% 
in 2015. In West Africa, the prevalence decreased from 
73.6% in 1996 to 25.4% in 2017. This is to be contrasted 
with the picture in Western Asia, where the percentage 
increased only by 1.0% in 1997 and 15.9% in 2013.
The results of the trend analysis showed a significant 
shift downwards in the prevalence of FGM/C among chil-
dren aged 0–14 years in such regions and subregions of 
East Africa, North Africa and West Africa. East Africa has 
experienced a much faster decrease in the prevalence 
of the practice (trend=−7.3%, 95% CI −7.5% to −7.1%)

Main findings
We found that the prevalence of FGM/C among chil-
dren varied greatly between countries and regions and 
also within countries over the survey periods. Specifically, 
West, East and North African countries, including Mali, 
Mauritania, Gambia, Guinea, Djibouti and Sudan, have 
pooled prevalence estimates well over 40%. These rates 
may be consistent with the influence of different predic-
tors, including geographical mobility, socioeconomic and 
cultural factors acting at individual, family and tertiary 
levels.26 Our study found a huge and significant decline 
in the prevalence of FGM/C among children aged 0–14 
years across countries and regions. This current evidence 
points towards the success of the national and interna-
tional investment and policy intervention in the last three 
decades.27 One possible explanation in the decrease of 
FGM/C among young girls (0–14 years) could be the 
legal ban currently in place in most of these countries, 
where strong cultural and traditional influence may have 
acted as an effective deterrent as seen in the decline 
among these cohorts.28
Although there is clear evidence of significant decline 
in the prevalence among the population studied here 
(children aged 0–14 years old), the FGM/C risk factors 
still prevail, which potentially heightens the likelihood 
of reverse trend in some countries. These risk factors 
include lack of, or poor, education, poverty, gendered 
cultural forces, weak social fitness and continued 
perception of FGM/C as a potential marriage market 
activity.29–34 The health and socioeconomic conse-
quences of FGM/C coupled with its risk factors may mean

growing underinvestment and gross domestic product 
losses, which itself reflects increased loss in productivity 
and reduced labour efficiency in LMICs. Moreover, 
those regions and subregions showing high prevalence 
of FGM/C should be the focus of renewed government 
and donors’ policy efforts. If the goal of public policy is 
to ensure that the practice is eliminated, further efforts 
and interventions as well as service planning are urgently 
needed. This package of comprehensive intervention 
could include legislation, advocacy, education and multi-
media communication, in order to come up with more 
culturally sensitive and community-engaging strategies 
such as forging partnership with religious and commu-
nity leaders, youths and health workers to drive the prac-
tice downward.16 18 35–41
strengths and limitations
There are a number of caveats to be considered when 
interpreting these results. The main limitation of the 
study is the risk of reporting bias, as with similar studies 
of this kind; we were unable to deal with bias associated 
with self-reports.42 This is particularly common in Africa, 
where there are multiple burden of public health issues 
including illiteracy, poverty, and communicable and 
non-communicable diseases.43 It is possible that responses 
to culturally sensitive issues such as FGM/C will have 
distorted the findings; it may be under-reported. In fact, a 
recent body of evidence suggests that under-reporting of 
FGM/C cases could occur.8 Such an under-reporting may 
be due to fear that the new legislation banning the prac-
tice across many jurisdictions would lead to prosecution 
of relatives if disclosure was made about their FGM/C 
status. Another limitation is that we did not consider all 
the study-level participants’ characteristics, which may 
have further increased the knowledge of the dynamics of 
FGM/C practices.
Despite these limitations, the strengths of the study 
are significant. It is a large, population-based study with 
national coverage. In addition, the DHS data are widely 
perceived to be of high quality, as they were based on 
sound sampling methodology with high response rate. 
The DHS also adheres to stringent ethical rules in the 
collection of sensitive topics such as FGM/C. Another 
important strength of this study is the number of included 
countries, and geographical and socioeconomic diversi-
ties constitute a good yardstick for the region and help to 
strengthen the findings from the study.
ConClusIons
The prevalence of FGM/C among children aged 0–14 
years varied greatly between countries and regions and 
also within countries over the survey periods. There is 
evidence of huge and significant decline in the preva-
lence of FGM/C among children across countries and 
regions. There is a need to sustain comprehensive inter-
vention efforts. In addition, further targeted culturally 
sensitive policy intervention and other effective strategies 
for preventing FGM/C should be a major public health 
priority in countries and regions still showing high prev-
alence of FGM/C among children, where the practice is 
still pervasive.
