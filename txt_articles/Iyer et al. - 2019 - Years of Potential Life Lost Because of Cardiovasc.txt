Background-—Asian-American subgroups (Asian-Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese) display varied
cardiovascular disease mortality patterns, especially at younger ages. This study aims to examine the years of potential life lost
because of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease among the 6 largest Asian-American subgroups compared with
non-Hispanic whites.
Methods and Results-—We used National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Causes of Death mortality files from 2003 to 2012
to calculate race-specific life expectancy, mean years of potential life lost, and years of potential life lost per 100 000 population
for each Asian subgroup and non-Hispanic whites. Asian-American subgroups display heterogeneity in cardiovascular disease
burden. Asian-Indians had a high burden of ischemic heart disease; Asian-Indian men lost 724 years per 100 000 population in
2012 and a mean of 17 years to ischemic heart disease. Respectively, Vietnamese and Filipino men and women lost a mean of 17
and 16 years of life to cerebrovascular disease; Filipino men lost 352 years per 100 000 population in 2012. All Asian subgroups
for both sexes had higher years of life lost to cerebrovascular disease compared with non-Hispanic whites.
Conclusions-—Cardiovascular disease burden varies among Asian subgroups, and contributes to greater premature mortality in
certain subgroups. Asian-Indian and Filipino populations have the highest years of life lost because of ischemic heart disease and
Filipino and Vietnamese have the highest years of life lost because of cerebrovascular disease. Analysis of risk factors and
development of subgroup-specific interventions are required to address these health disparities. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:

sian-Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic
group in the United States, having experienced a 46%
increase in population from 2000 to 2010, and with an
expected population of 34 million by the year 2050.1 National
mortality surveys have only recently in 2003 separated the 6
largest Asian-American subgroups (Asian-Indians, Chinese,
Filipinos, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese).2 This disaggre-
gation has allowed study of individual Asian subgroups,
revealing substantial heterogeneity in disease patterns.3–6
Notably, the leading cause of death varies among Asian-
American subgroups.6 Heart disease is the leading cause of
death in Asian-Indian, Filipino, and Japanese men.6 Asian-
Indian men and women, and Filipino men have a greater
proportionate mortality because of ischemic heart disease
(IHD) compared with other racial groups and subgroups.1 The
third leading cause of death in men, among all Asian
subgroups, is stroke.6
Furthermore, studies of cardiovascular risk factors and age
of onset of first acute myocardial infarction have suggested
that certain Asian-American subpopulations have cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) at a younger age.7–10 This finding raises
concern that CVD may contribute to premature mortality in
Asian-American populations. While previous studies1 showed
greater proportionate mortality because of CVD in Asian-
Indians, this methodology (proportion of deaths because of
CVD over total deaths in Asian Indians) does not provide
differential weight to premature deaths that occur among
younger people.
Preventing premature mortality is an important public health
goal. Premature mortality can be quantified by measuring years
of potential life lost (YPLL).11,12 YPLL compares age at death

 with average life expectancy to estimate the average time an
individual would have lived had he/she not died prematurely
from a specific disease.13 YPLL is a superior measure of
premature mortality when compared with age-adjusted mor-
tality rate because it can be used to demonstrate the social and
economic burden of disease in a population.13 YPLL has been
proposed as a useful outcome measure in cardiovascular
medicine, specifically, because it avoids some important
limitations of more commonly used measures such as overall
population death rate and case-fatality rate.14
An analysis of YPLL in all Americans revealed acute
myocardial infarction as one of the top 10 causes of YPLL,
and acute cerebrovascular disease as one of the top 5 causes of
YPLL.15 However, an analysis of YPLL because of CVD in the
diverse and rapidly growing Asian-American population specif-
ically has not yet been conducted. In this study, we have
evaluated disease burden in Asian-American subgroups by
calculating the YPLL because of IHD and cerebrovascular
disease. In this analysis, the age at death because of IHD and
cerebrovascular disease is compared with Asian-specific life
expectancy, calculated by the US Census Bureau projections.16
The aim of our study is to use YPLL to better characterize
the burden of CVD in each Asian-American subgroup. To our
knowledge, this is the first analysis of YPLL from CVD in
Asian-Americans using national-level data.
Methods
The data that support the findings of this study are available
from the first author upon request.
Study Population
Asian-American individuals were identified in US mortality
records from the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple
Causes of Death mortality files from 2003 to 2012. The
Stanford University institutional review board provided a
waiver for use of these publicly available mortality and census
data. We used death records from states that adopted the
2003 revision of the US Standard Certificate of Death, which
disaggregated Asian-American subgroups by providing a
check box for the 6 largest subgroups. The following 36 of
51 states that adopted this revision were included in this
study: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ken-
tucky,
Maine,
Michigan,
Minnesota,
Missouri,
Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont,
Washington, and Wyoming. Death certificate data from
National Center for Health Statistics provided cause of death,
race/ethnicity of the decedent, and participant’s age at death.
International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
codes I20-I25 identified death from IHD, and codes I60-I69
identified death from cerebrovascular disease. An aggregate
Asian category comprised data from the 6 main Asian-
American groups used in this analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated in each Asian-American
subgroup, including total decedents, sex distribution, total
deaths from IHD and cerebrovascular disease, percent of
deaths because of IHD and cerebrovascular disease, mean
age at death for both diseases with standard deviation,
percent of each population born in the United States, percent
born in a foreign country, and distribution of highest
education level attained.
Race-specific life expectancy was calculated using the
most recent available Census data on Asian life expectancy
during the study period 2003 to 2012.16 Linear interpolation
was used to estimate the life expectancy of Non-Hispanic
Asian and Non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations for 2007,
the midpoint year of the study period. Non-Hispanic Asian life
expectancy for the year 2007 was calculated to be 81 for
men, and 87 for women. NHW life expectancy for the year
2007 was calculated to be 76 for men, and 81 for women. Life
expectancy was also calculated for the final year in the study
period, 2012, and was found to be 82 for Non-Hispanic Asian
men and 87 for Non-Hispanic Asian women, and 76 for NHW
men and 82 for NHW women. Linear interpolation is an
appropriate method to estimate race-specific life expectancy
from the limited available data on Asian-American mortality,
and has been used in prior study to obtain Asian-American
demographic information.17
Mean YPLL was calculated to estimate YPLL because of
IHD and cerebrovascular disease for an individual patient, and
Clinical Perspective

 to compare differences across Asian subgroups. This analysis
was completed by subtracting mean age at death from race-
specific life expectancy, and included deaths that occurred
before the average life expectancy for that subgroup.
In order to compare differences in the burden of disease
between each subgroup population and in comparison to the
NHW population, YPLL in years per 100 000 individuals was
calculated based on standard epidemiologic methods.13 Mean
age at death was subtracted from a reference age, and was
standardized and age-adjusted (Data S1). The reference age
used in this analysis was race-specific life expectancy, as
calculated above. Each Asian subgroup was compared with
the aggregated Asian-specific life expectancy, and NHW
populations were compared with the NHW-specific life
expectancy.
YPLL was standardized and age-adjusted to allow compar-
ison between each cause of death within each race, sex, and
year group. The formula used for standardization and age-
adjustment utilized age categories and took into account
percentage of total individuals in each age category. This
method is based on standard techniques used for the
calculation of YPLL when comparing groups with varying
age structures, as is the case among Asian-American
subpopulations and NHW populations.18
Results
From 2003 to 2012, there were a total of 354 256 Asian-
American decedents aged 25 years or older. In this group,
59 936 deaths were because of IHD and 28 489 deaths were
because of cerebrovascular disease. Mean age at death varied
across each Asian-American subgroup and with respect to the
aggregated Asian population estimate (Table). Mean age at

 death from IHD was lowest for Asian-Indians, 71.8 years and
highest in Japanese, 81.1 years. Vietnamese decedents had
the lowest mean age at death because of cerebrovascular
disease, 72.5, followed by Asian-Indians and Filipinos, while
Japanese had the highest mean age at death, 81.4 years.
Mean YPLL
Mean YPLL because of IHD and cerebrovascular disease is
depicted in Figure 1A and gives an estimate of the average
years lost for a patient who died prematurely in that subgroup
during the study period, 2003 to 2012. For ischemic heart
disease, Asian-Indian men and Vietnamese men had the
highest mean YPLL, 17 and 18 years, respectively, while
Japanese men had a mean YPLL comparable to NHWs,
�14 years (Figure 1A-i). Asian-Indian women on average lost
13 years, followed by Vietnamese and Filipino women who
lost an average of 12 years. Similar to men, Japanese and
Chinese women had the lowest mean YPLL because of IHD
(Figure 1A-ii). For comparison, mean YPLL was calculated for
Asians as an aggregate group to yield 15 years of mean YPLL
for men, and 11 years for women. Mean YPLL was also
calculated for the final year in the study period, 2012, and is
depicted in Figure 1B. Asian-Indian and Vietnamese men
again had the highest mean YPPL, 12 years, while NHW men
had a mean YPLL of 1 year (Figure 1B-i). Asian-Indian women
in the year 2012 had a mean YPLL of 8 years (Figure 1B-ii).
Calculation of mean YPLL because of cerebrovascular
disease during the study period 2003 to 2012 also revealed
distinct differences between Asian subgroups. Asian-Indian,
Vietnamese, and Korean men had the highest YPLL because
of cerebrovascular disease, 17 years, followed by Filipino
men, 16 years (Figure 1A-iii). Vietnamese women had the
highest mean YPLL, 17 years, followed by Korean and Filipino
women, who lost an average of 16 years because of
cerebrovascular disease (Figure 1A-iv). Mean YPLL because
of cerebrovascular disease in the Asian population as an
aggregate was lower in total than when it was calculated
specifically for certain subgroups; the mean YPLL was
15 years for men and 14 years for women. Additionally,
NHW men and women had much lower mean YPLL because
of cerebrovascular disease, 13 and 11 years, respectively.
Mean YPLL from the year 2012 was calculated to be 11 for
Asian-Indian men, and 10 for Filipino and Vietnamese men

 (Figure 1B-iii). Korean women lost 13 years, while Filipino and
Vietnamese women lost 11 years to cerebrovascular disease
(Figure 1B-iv).
Ischemic Heart Disease
Using race-specific life expectancy to calculate YPLL because
of IHD, Asian men in aggregate lost 779 years per 100 000
people in 2003, which decreased to 574 years per 100 000
people in 2012. Disaggregation of Asian male subgroups
showed a range of YPLL because of IHD across the study
period (Figure 2). In 2003, Asian-Indian men lost 1216 years
per 100 000 people, which was higher than all other Asian
male subgroups and higher than NHW men. To further
characterize the impact of IHD on premature mortality in the
Asian-Indian population, we calculated the proportion of YPLL
because of IHD compared with total YPLL from all causes. The
proportion of YPLL because of IHD ranged from 25% to 16%
over the course of the study period.
By 2012, Filipino-American men had the highest YPLL
compared with the other Asian subgroups, 799 years per
100 000; similar to NHW men in the same year, 807 YPLL per
100 000 population. Furthermore, use of race-specific life
expectancy revealed greater heterogeneity in YPLL across all
Asian subgroups. Japanese and Filipino men experienced
more YPLL than the aggregate Asian men, while Vietnamese
and Korean men experienced fewer YPLL than the aggregate.
In women, trends in YPLL because of IHD were similar to
those in men. Figure 3 shows that Asian-Indian women had
the highest YPLL consistently over the study period, ranging
from 818 years per 100 000 in 2003, to 477 years per
100 000 in 2012. In contrast, NHW women ranged from
577 years per 100 000 to 426 years per 100 000. Chinese
women, like Chinese men, had the lowest YPLL because of
IHD, ranging from 348 years per 100 000 to 189 years per
100 000 at the end of the study period.
Cerebrovascular Disease
Men in every Asian subgroup lost more years of life to
cerebrovascular disease than NHW men. Filipino men had the
highest values for YPLL consistently across the study period
ranging from 404 years per 100 000 in 2003 to 352 years
per 100 000 in 2012, which was higher than NHW males; 170
per 100 000 in 2003 to 143 per 100 000 in 2012 (Figure 4).
Vietnamese men had the second highest cerebrovascular
disease burden, peaking in the middle of the study period,
2009, when this population lost 337 years per 100 000
individuals, which decreased to 261 years per 100 000 in
2012.
YPLL because of cerebrovascular disease in women was
higher for women in each Asian subgroup when compared
with NHW women (Figure 5). Filipino and Vietnamese women
had the highest YPLL during the study period, similar to the
pattern seen in men. Filipino women lost 474 years per

Chinese and Asian-Indian women lost fewer years of life than
the aggregate Asian estimate, but still more than NHW women
during the study period. Chinese women lost 288 years per
100 000 in 2003, and 195 years per 100 000 in 2012, while
the aggregate Asian estimate was 362 years per 100 000 in
2003, and 250 years per 100 000 in 2012.
Discussion
Our analysis of YPLL in Asian-Americans reveals substantial
heterogeneity in the burden of CVD among Asian-American
subpopulations and varied years of life lost at the level of the
individual patient.
Asian-Indians in the study population had a high burden of
years lost to IHD and the possibility of losing a decade of life
or more to this disease. For this population, almost one fourth
of total years lost to any disease were because of IHD,
revealing the notable contribution of IHD to overall premature
mortality in Asian-Indians. There are several possible expla-
nations for the greater number of premature IHD deaths
among Asian-Indians. South Asians experience higher death
rates from CVD at younger ages and demonstrate higher
levels of traditional risk factors at younger ages; a study by
Joshi et al found the prevalence of elevated apolipoprotein
B100/apolipoprotein A-1 ratio in South Asians to be 61.5%
compared with 48.3% in patients from other countries.7,19–22.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is especially important to consider as
a contributor to early CVD development and mortality since
South Asians tend to develop diabetes mellitus at younger
ages.23 Additionally, cardiovascular risk in Asian-Indians may
go unnoticed in the clinical setting, and therefore manifest as
CVD at a relatively younger age. Support of this notion
includes the finding that normal-weight South Asians have a
high prevalence of cardiometabolic abnormalities24 and that
traditional risk calculation tools, such as the Framingham Risk
Score, underestimate risk for Asian Indians.25 A recent study
also found that South Asian patients have signs of cardiac
aging earlier in life, which may contribute to the increased
CVD mortality.26
Regarding cerebrovascular disease, our study builds upon
the prior finding that from 2003 to 2010, every Asian
subgroup, except Asian-Indians, had higher mortality rates
and greater proportionate mortality because of hemorrhagic
stroke than NHWs.1 Our analysis of YPLL found that
specifically Filipino and Vietnamese populations lost more
years of life than the aggregate Asian population and the NHW
population studied. Our findings of high YPLL because of
cerebrovascular disease in Filipino populations is consistent
with a prior study that has demonstrated increased risk for
intracerebral hemorrhage in Filipino patients, which could be
explained by increased risk of hypertension in this population,
with an odds ratio for hypertension of 1.4 for Filipino men and
1.8 for Filipino women.27,28
We present novel measures of the burden of cerebrovas-
cular disease in Vietnamese-Americans, the study of which is
currently very limited. The Vietnamese population in the
United States grew 40% from 2000 to 2010 and is currently
the fourth largest Asian subgroup, with large communities
in
certain
southern
and
western
states.29

 communities have a unique migration history, cultural prac-
tices, and risk factors warranting more specific attention from
the medical community at large. A study found Vietnamese
patients had worse self-reported health status when com-
pared with NHW, possibly because of lower rates of English
language proficiency and/or immigration trauma, as many
Vietnamese came to the United States as war refugees.30 The
burden of cerebrovascular disease may be because of
increased risk factors such as high rates of smoking among
Vietnamese men, with a prevalence of 29.8% in Vietnamese
men compared with 19.0% in NHW men, or lower health
literacy regarding stroke; only 67% of Vietnamese patients
knew that numbness or weakness of the face, arms, or legs
was a symptom of stroke.31 This combination of risk factors,
history, and disease burden highlight a distinct health
disparity in the Vietnamese-American population.
Study Impact
Our use of race-specific life expectancy emphasizes the need
to understand determinants of health and evaluate health
outcomes of Asian-Americans as a disaggregated group. Asian
subgroups have vastly different immigration histories, level of
acculturation, risk factors, genetic markers, and cultural
practices related to health care.32–35
Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether
Asian-Americans benefit from a mortality advantage when
compared with NHW populations. The “model minority”
stereotype of Asian-Americans having higher socioeconomic
status and education levels, and lower mortality rates
compared with NHWs continues to persist.36 Conversely, a
study from 2017 found that in certain regions of the United
States, some Asian populations (Filipino and Japanese men,
Korean and Vietnamese men and women) possessed no
mortality advantage in the setting of cerebrovascular dis-
ease.4 A study in Canada found that IHD in South Asian
women was the leading cause of avoidable mortality, and that
South Asian women have a disadvantage relative to Canadian-
born women.37 Our study shows that a substantial number of
Asian patients with CVD, especially Asian-Indians, Filipinos,
and Vietnamese, have a lower age at death and more years of
life lost to the disease, meaning they actually experience a
mortality disadvantage.
In our study, the determination of YPLL per 100 000 and
mean YPLL provide measures of premature mortality in Asian-
American subgroups in a format that is particularly useful for
studies of both population health and clinical cardiology.14
Population health analyses of premature mortality commonly
use gross mortality rate or age-adjusted mortality rate;
however, these measures can be dominated by deaths of
the elderly.13 YPLL more appropriately characterizes disease
burden in populations because it can be weighed to take into
account death at younger ages, can be adjusted to compare
populations with varying age structures, and can be altered to
use age limits specific to the populations under study that
may differ from the majority population.18 These adjustments
are especially useful and relevant in the study of Asian-
American subgroups.
Limitations
Limitations of this study arise from the relatively small
amount of available data about mortality and health out-
comes for Asian-Americans, especially when evaluating each
subgroup separately. In the calculation for race-specific life
expectancy, we used a Census report from 2000, because it
is the most recent data set published relevant to our study
period, 2003 to 2012. Census data for Asian-Americans are
released only once every 4 years, or at longer intervals. The
National Vital Statistics Report does not include information
about Asian-Americans, and therefore could not be used to
calculate life expectancy using a life table. Census data for
our study period only reported life expectancy for the non-
Hispanic Asian population. Although this should not affect our
results greatly, since the proportion of Hispanic Asians is 3%
in general, and just 1.5% in our study population, it includes
the possibility of omitting small populations that may report
as Hispanic, such as Filipino-Americans. Other limitations
include the potential for misclassification of race/ethnicity on
death records that were used to gather mortality data for this
study. A recent report confirmed that there was 7% to 3%
misclassification for the Asian or Pacific Islander population
death records.38
Conclusions
Mean YPLL provides clinicians with a measure of the impact
of cardiovascular disease on the life expectancy of their Asian
patients, specific to each ethnic subgroup. YPLL in years per
100 000 individuals in each population during the study
period gives a measure of the total burden of disease on each
subgroup. Our study also provides evidence that evaluating
the Asian population together as one aggregated group
underestimates the burden of CVD.

Formula 1. Standardized age-adjusted YPLL per 100,000 individuals  
 
 
𝑌𝑃𝐿𝐿 = ∑({

} ∗ 𝑆𝑎𝑐)  
Where, 
• Xac = number of deaths from a specific cause (e.g. IHD), in a specific year (e.g. 2003), for a 
specific race/sex (e.g. Chinese American men), in a specific age category (e.g., 72-81 years, 
for Chinese American men, as detailed below) 
• LE = Race-specific life expectancy  
• MPac = mid-point of age category. Age categories for age-adjustment were created for each 
group. Categories were defined as 10-year increments, starting from the pre-defined life 
expectancy (as above) minus 10 years. The youngest age category range was larger or 
smaller than 10 years as the life expectancy ages for these groups were not multiples of 10. 
The midpoint of each age category was calculated.  
• Pac = total population of individuals of a certain race/sex in each age category in each year.  
• Sac = percentage of total individuals of a specific race/sex group in the 2000 population.
