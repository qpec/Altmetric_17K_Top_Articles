Abstract
Background—Research on data sharing from clinical trials has focused on elucidating 
perceptions, barriers, and attitudes among trialists and study participants with respect to sharing 
data. However, little information exists regarding utilization or associated publication of articles 
once clinical trial data have been widely shared.
Methods—We analyzed administrative records of investigator requests for data access, linked 
publications, and bibliometrics to describe the use of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
data repository.
Results—From January 2000 through May 2016, a total of 370 investigators requested data from 
1 or more clinical trials. Requests for trial data have been increasing, with 195 investigators (53%) 
initiating requests during the last 4.4 years of the study period. The predominant reason for 
requesting data was post hoc secondary analysis of new questions (72%), followed by analytic or 
statistical approaches to clinical trials (9%) and meta-analyses or pooled study research (7%). Of 
172 requests with online project descriptions, only 2 requests were initiated for reanalysis of 
primary-outcome findings. Data from 88 of 100 available clinical trials were requested at least 
once, and the median time from repository availability to first request was 235 days. A total of 277 
articles were published on the basis of data from 47 trials. Citation metrics from 224 articles 
indicated that half of the publications have cumulative citations that rank in the top 34% 
normalized for subject category and year of publication.
Conclusions—Demand for trial data for secondary analysis has been increasing. Requesting 
data for the a priori purpose of reanalysis or verification of original findings was rare.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) initiated a formal data repository in 2000 to facilitate the sharing of data from clinical 
trials and observational studies with the general scientific community. The goal of the data

 repository is to maximize the research value of NHLBI-supported clinical studies by 
providing data to the widest possible audience of investigators. Overviews of the NHLBI 
data repository have been published previously.1,2 Briefly, large clinical trials and 
observational studies that are funded by the NHLBI deposit a copy of their deidentified, 
individual-level data sets in the repository after a proprietary-use period (approximately 2 
years). Investigators requesting data from the repository provide a basic description of their 
project, provide evidence of approval by the institutional review board or ethics committee at 
the participating site or certification that their project is exempt from such approval, and 
agree to the terms and conditions of a data-use agreement. The data-use agreement is valid 
for 3 years, after which the researcher must renew the agreement or confirm that the data 
have been permanently destroyed. In October 2009, the Biologic Specimen and Data 
Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC)3 began to coordinate the activities 
of the NHLBI biorepository and data repository.
Much of the published research on data sharing has focused on surveys of trialists and study 
participants to elucidate barriers to sharing, attitudes toward sharing, sharing practices, and 
participant perspectives.4-11 However, there is little information regarding outcomes such as 
utilization and associated publication of articles once clinical trial data have been released 
for wide sharing. Sharing data from clinical trials has received particular attention recently 
owing to the publication of the Institute of Medicine report on the responsible sharing of 
clinical trial data,12 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors editorial on the 
rapid sharing of individual-level data from clinical trial publications,13 and the National 
Library of Medicine report on incorporating the sharing of individual participant data in 
clinical trial reporting.14
Preparing data for wide release is a nontrivial activity. Generally, data and documentation 
were prepared by the study submitting the data; however, in some instances, BioLINCC 
prepared the data. In instances in which the data preparation was done by BioLINCC, the 
effort to prepare the data and documentation for wide release ranged from 85 to 350 full-
time-equivalent (FTE) hours, depending primarily on the quality of the documentation rather 
than the complexity of the data. Review of data and documentation already prepared by the 
study investigators has generally required approximately 80 hours of FTE effort. This 
process involves initial deidentification checks, interaction with data preparers to resolve 
questions or discrepancies, remediation of documents for the website to be compliant with 
Section 508 (accessible to persons with disabilities) standards, and composition of the 
website description. However, this phase can also vary widely. Furthermore, replication of 
the primary results as a check on the system process can add an additional 70 FTE hours to 
the review.
Given the level of effort needed to prepare data for release, host the data, and monitor use, 
an understanding of the benefits of wide sharing of trial data is needed. In this article, we 
describe the use of clinical trial data from the NHLBI data repository. Specifically, this 
report describes trends in the number of data requests, characteristics of investigators who 
requested data, and the reasons for requesting data. In addition, this report describes the time 
from data availability to first request and first publication and describes the number and 
citation metrics of resulting publications. Although this article is focused on clinical trial

 data shared through the repository, data related to the sharing of observational study data are 
also presented to provide context and further perspective on widely shared data.
Methods
Coding of Administrative Records
Detailed methods for coding data-requester characteristics and linkage to publications are 
available in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. In brief, data-requester characteristics were derived from administrative records 
collected as part of program management. The institution of each data requester was 
classified as an academic, nonprofit, or for-profit entity. Requests were categorized into a 
research area on the basis of the study data requested. A listing of available clinical trials (as 
of May 31, 2016) and the classification scheme is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
The primary purpose of each request was based on project titles (beginning in 2007) and 
categorized as follows: new question, defined as a secondary analysis designed to explore 
associations, prognostic factors, subgroup analyses, or similar issues; meta-analysis or 
pooled study, defined as a formal meta-analysis of individual participant data, combined 
study analysis, or consortium of studies with participant-level data; statistical methods, 
defined as a project focused on the development and testing of new statistical approaches; 
clinical trial methods, defined as a project examining statistical methods or analytic 
approaches that are generalizable to all or specific types of clinical trials; and other projects, 
examples of which include pilot data for a subsequent grant submission, simulation studies, 
and development of prediction equations. In addition, project plans were searched for any 
mention of a reanalysis of previously published findings; however, online project 
descriptions (as opposed to an uploaded document) have only recently been required as part 
of the data-request process. Therefore, this search was limited to 172 of 419 requests 
processed by BioLINCC. Access to external funding and funding source were reported by 
the data requesters at the time of the request.
Characteristics of clinical trials that are shared through the data repository (year trial started, 
intervention type, and purpose) were abstracted from ClinicalTrials.gov. If the information 
was not reported, the data were extracted from the study protocol or a study manual.
Publication Citation Metrics
Citation metrics for publications that are linked to data requested from the repository were 
derived from the Thomson Reuters InCites database, a research and bibliometric assessment 
tool providing citation-based metrics for most articles indexed by the Web of Science Core 
Collection. The citation metric that was used was the citation percentile, which was defined 
as the top percentile of cumulative citations that an article has generated as compared with 
all other articles published in the same subject category and year. Thus, the lower the 
percentile for a publication, the more citations it has received relative to other publications, 
normalized for the subject category and publication year.

 Time Frames for Data Use and Associated Publications
Data requests, available trial data sets, and publication results were those known as of May 
31, 2016. Years were grouped into 4-year blocks (with 2016 combined into the 2012+ year 
group) to simplify the presentation of trends. Citation metrics were limited to articles 
published before May 31, 2015, to allow at least 1 year for the accumulation of citations.
Results
Repository Use by External Investigators
A total of 1116 data requests were initiated by 844 investigators, and 2104 study databases 
were provided to investigators initiating data requests. In terms of provided databases, 
observational study data historically exceeded those for clinical trials (1237 of 2104 study 
databases provided [59%]); however, since 2014, delivery of clinical trial databases outpaced 
that for observational studies (350 of 635 study databases provided [55%]). The cumulative 
number of provided clinical trial databases (excluding repeated deliveries of the same study 
to the same investigator), along with the cumulative number of available clinical trials, are 
shown in Figure 1A, and the results for observational study data are shown in Figure 1B. 
The rate of acquisition of clinical trials available for request has increased over time, with 
16% of the total available trials being released during the 2000–2003 period and 37% of 
trials released since 2012. However, 4% of all requests for trial data occurred during the 
2000–2003 period, and 57% of trial data requests have occurred since 2012 (4.4 years), 
indicating an increasing demand for trial data that has outpaced acquisition. In contrast, 
demand for observational data has increased in a pattern more directly proportional to time.
Characteristics of investigators and requests that included at least one clinical trial are shown 
in Table 1. Approximately 25% of investigators requested both clinical trial data and 
observational study data; however, the percentage that simultaneously requested 
observational study data declined over time. Most requesters were from academic 
institutions; however, requesters from nonprofit and for-profit institutions represent a 
considerable proportion of the investigator pool.
Most requests were for trials of prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disorders; 
however, 22% of requesters asked to obtain data on lung disorders (excluding asthma), 
which represented 17% of the trial portfolio. Among data requests with a coded purpose, 
72% of requests were initiated to address a new question or hypothesis, 7% to perform a 
meta-analysis or combined study analysis, 2% to test statistical methods, 9% to investigate 
methods relevant to clinical trials, and 9% for other reasons. Defining a reanalysis as a 
project in which the aim is to critically reassess the primary-outcome findings of the trial 
revealed only two requests in which the available description suggested a reanalysis. Both of 
the reanalyses examined prespecified interactions between the intervention and a specific 
cofactor with the primary or secondary outcome. Both of these reanalyses were published, 
and neither disputed the published primary result. Projects that focused on examination of 
specific subgroups or new statistical approaches were not considered to be reanalyses. 
Among requesters for which there was information on external funding, approximately two 
thirds reported no external funding at the time of the initial request. A total of 45 of 370

 requesters (12%) were from outside the United States or Canada (Fig. 2, and see the 
interactive graphic, available at NEJM.org), and 111 (30%) published at least one article 
based on trial data obtained from the repository.
Technical support for investigators who request data is an important, often overlooked, 
consideration for widely shared data. Once data have been released for wide sharing, there is 
an expectation of access to a reasonable level of support. Although support for investigators 
who have received a data set was not specifically tracked, investigators who receive data 
through BioLINCC can post questions through the comments area of their data-request page. 
An examination of 238 “incident” (investigator's first request for data) requests for clinical 
trial data revealed that 54 investigators (23%) had questions related to the data, 
documentation, access to data not included in the download, download issues, or data-format 
issues.
Use Characteristics According to Clinical Trial
As of May 31, 2016, the repository contained data from 100 studies initiated between 1972 
and 2010, with a cumulative total of nearly 350,000 participants. More than half of the trials 
dealt with cardiovascular conditions, 43% used a drug intervention, and 65% were treatment 
trials (Table 2). On the basis of a Poisson regression model, factors associated with higher 
rates of access requests included trials with a larger size (rate ratio, 1.02 for each additional 
1000 participants; P<0.001), more recent completion (rate ratio, 1.05 per calendar year of 
project completion; P<0.001), a focus on prevention (rate ratio, 1.42 relative to treatment 
trials; P<0.001), and a focus on lung disorders (rate ratio, 1.30 relative to cardiovascular 
trials; P = 0.008) (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Kaplan–Meier 
survival curves were used to examine the time from release of a study data set in the 
repository to the date of the first request for that data set (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). A total of 88 trial data sets were requested at least once, and 62% were first 
requested within a year after repository release. The median time until the first request was 
235 days (range, 3 days to 11.3 years). By comparison, observational studies in the 
repository had a median time until the first request of 204 days (range, 4 days to 5 years).
Kaplan–Meier curves for the time from study release to first publication for both clinical 
trials and observational studies are shown in Figure 3. The time until the publication of the 
first article associated with a request was similar for clinical trials and observational studies 
(P = 0.96 by log-rank test). Within 1 year after availability in the repository, 4% of clinical 
trials and 3% of observational studies had a first publication; at 5 years, 35% of clinical trials 
and 48% of observational studies had at least one publication. The median time to first 
publication was 7.2 years for clinical trials and 9.8 years for observational studies.
Publication Metrics
A total of 711 journal publications from 293 requesters were based on repository data. 
Among the requesters who published journal articles, 111 published 277 articles that 
included data from at least one clinical trial in the repository. The distribution of citation 
percentiles is shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. A total of 243 articles had 
a publication date before May 31, 2015, and 224 (92%) were linked to the InCites database.

 For comparison, the citation percentile distribution of publications that used repository 
observational study data (357 of 393 [91%]) as well as a 10% random sample of all NHLBI-
supported articles published during the same period (January 1, 2000, through May 31, 
2015; 16,856 articles) are also shown. Approximately 23% of the articles that used clinical 
trial data from the repository had cumulative citations that ranked in the top 10% of all 
articles normalized for the publication year and subject category, and the median citation 
percentile was 34.0. Similarly, the median percentile was 28.3 for articles using 
observational study data from the repository and 29.0 for the NHLBI 10% random sample. 
No significant difference was detected between distributions based on the nonparametric 
Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test (P = 0.52).
Abstracts of published articles that involved one or more clinical trials were reviewed for 
any mention of original results, regardless of the context. A total of 21 abstracts cited 
original findings. Of these abstracts, 4 restated principal findings to describe the parent 
study, and 6 extended the findings to subgroups or to a shorter follow-up period. Of the 
remaining 11 publications, 1 was a protocol describing simulation of the trial with the use of 
adaptive designs, 5 involved new statistical approaches, and 5 were reanalyses examining 
cofactor-by-treatment interactions. Four of these publications were related to reanalyses 
identified above, whereas the last one described the project more in terms of subgroup 
analysis than effect modification.
Publications were also examined in terms of published comments. Ascertainment of 
published comments is described in the Supplementary Appendix. Of the 277 publications 
that were based on repository clinical trial data, 115 published comments were associated 
with 57 articles (21%). Of these 115 comments, 12 were author replies, 8 did not have a 
PubMed-accessible reprint, and 2 were in a language other than English. Full-text reprints 
were retrieved for the remaining 93 comment articles. None of the comments raised serious 
concerns regarding misrepresentation of the original study results or serious concerns with 
the analysis or conclusions; however, 24 (26%) were critical of the article to some degree, 
such as overstating conclusions, inadequate control of confounders, or questions about the 
analytic design. One of these commentaries was from the original study investigators who 
recommended caution in the interpretation of reanalysis results. Commentaries or editorials 
regarding the clinical significance of the article, future research directions, or how the article 
may expand the current state of knowledge were found in 58 comment articles (62%). The 
remainder (11 of 93) consisted of summaries of the article without substantial editorial 
content.
Discussion
Since inception of the repository, there has been an increasing demand for reuse of clinical 
trial data. Although there were a variety of reasons for requesting data, the primary use was 
to examine new hypotheses-generating questions. Kaplan–Meier analysis suggested that 
approximately 35% of clinical trials were associated with at least one publication within 5 
years after release to the general scientific community. In a survey of users of the NHLBI 
data repository that was conducted by Ross et al., factors that were cited as being burdens to 
publication included time constraints, lack of funding, lack of statistical support, and a need

 for additional data.15 Citation metrics indicated that resulting publications were, on average, 
of a similar quality to all publications supported by the NHLBI. Support for released trial 
data was a non-trivial activity, because approximately one in five requests required some 
level of assistance.
Requesting clinical trial data for reanalysis or replication of original results was a relatively 
rare aim among investigators using trial data from the NHLBI repository. Among project 
descriptions recorded in BioLINCC, only two projects indicated a reanalysis as a primary 
reason for the data request. This finding is consistent with the survey by Ross et al. of 
investigators who used data from the NHLBI repository during the 2007–2014 period, in 
which only seven respondents (4%) indicated that verification of primary results was a 
principal research objective.15 That survey of BioLINCC users showed that nearly two thirds 
of the respondents were new or early-stage investigators (≤10 years of active engagement in 
clinical research) and that 24% of respondents contacted original investigators to request a 
collaboration and two thirds of these had the collaboration request accepted, findings that 
indicate a potential role for repositories in the development of new trialists and 
epidemiologists.
There is little information regarding what happens once data are released for wide data 
sharing. In a 2011 commentary based on the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), Walker et al. reported on activities during 
the 2007–2010 period and included 2724 data-access requests from 851 investigators.16 The 
principal reason for dbGaP requests involved exploration of new association analysis (39%), 
followed by methodologic research (26%), replication (18%), and control groups (11%). The 
dbGaP summary, however, was unable to link requests to subsequent publications. In an 
evaluation of three open-access platforms with industry-sponsored trial data, Navar et al. 
found that during the 2013–2015 period, data from approximately 15.5% of more than 3000 
available clinical trials had been requested.17 Of 113 requests with a data-use agreement, 5 
indicated validation of the primary end point as a goal of the project, and the lone 
publication was a validation study in which the results contradicted those of the original 
publication.17 An industry-initiated repository reported on the first-year results of open 
access to approximately 1200 industry-supported trials.18 Although relatively new, the 
industry repository reported processing 58 formal requests for data. Strom et al. found that 
of 177 proposals for data access to the GlaxoSmith-Kline repository (https://
clinicalstudydatarequest.com), 148 (84%) were for a new study, with few proposals for 
confirmation of original results (2%)19 — a utilization pattern similar to that observed for 
the NHLBI data repository.
There are limitations in our study that should be acknowledged. The NHLBI data repository 
consists primarily of data from large trials or trials from large clinical networks, and the 
results of widely sharing these data may not be generalizable to all trials. A crude portfolio 
analysis was conducted with the use of the NIH Query, View, Report (QVR) system. QVR 
was searched for funded R01 and U01 (investigator-initiated research project) grants 
meeting the data-repository submission criteria of new or renewed grants funded on or after 
January 2006 with direct costs of $500,000 or more in any given year. Abstracts and aims 
were reviewed and projects were excluded if there was no interaction with human

 participants, the number of participants was less than 500, the project was principally 
genomic, the project was ancillary to another study, or the project end date was 2018 or later. 
Of 133 R01s and 81 U01s involving a clinical trial, 38 R01s and 35 U01s were potentially 
eligible, with only 2 R01s (5%) and 10 U01s (29%) currently in the repository or with 
known plans to submit. Verification of findings, an oft-cited reason for the wide release of 
trial data, may be less relevant to the studies in the NHLBI repository owing to established 
publication histories before repository release. Although considerable effort is expended to 
discover and validate publications based on repository data, it is likely that some 
publications were missed. The administrative nature of the data on investigators and data 
requests introduces inherent limitations in characterizing investigators' experiences with the 
data repository. Furthermore, because an intent to publish is not a criterion for data access, 
focusing on publications underestimates the potential value of repository data.
The results of this study of the NHLBI data repository suggest that release of clinical trial 
data for wide sharing can contribute to the scientific community in multiple ways, including 
increasing the transparency of findings, examining new hypothesis-generating questions, 
providing pilot data for grant submissions, testing statistical methods, performing meta-
analyses, and developing prediction algorithms. Although the current results provide 
information on the value of repositories, additional research is certainly warranted. In 
addition to data on the concerns and attitudes of trialists and study participants, information 
is needed on a variety of topics related to the wide sharing of data (e.g., the value of a 
proprietary period for study-generated publications), potential barriers to secondary use of 
data (e.g., the role of funding), and the value of secondary data analysis in training the next 
generation of trialists.
