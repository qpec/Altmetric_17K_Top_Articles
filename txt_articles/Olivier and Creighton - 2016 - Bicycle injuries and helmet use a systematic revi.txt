Abstract
Background: The research literature was systematically reviewed and results were sum-
marized from studies assessing bicycle helmet effectiveness to mitigate head, serious
head, face, neck and fatal head injury in a crash or fall.
Methods: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, COMPENDEX and SCOPUS)
were searched for relevant, peer-reviewed articles in English. Included studies reported
medically diagnosed head, face and neck injuries where helmet use was known. Non-
approved helmets were excluded where possible. Summary odds ratios (OR) were ob-
tained using multivariate meta-regression models stratified by injury type and severity.
Time trends and publication bias were assessed.
Results: A total of 43 studies met inclusion criteria and 40 studies were included in the
meta-analysis with data from over 64 000 injured cyclists. For cyclists involved in a crash
or fall, helmet use was associated with odds reductions for head (OR ¼ 0.49, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 0.42–0.57), serious head (OR ¼ 0.31, 95% CI: 0.25–0.37), face
(OR ¼ 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56–0.81) and fatal head injury (OR ¼ 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14–0.88). No
clear evidence of an association between helmet use and neck injury was found
(OR ¼ 0.96, 95% CI: 0.74–1.25). There was no evidence of time trends or publication bias.
Conclusions: Bicycle helmet use was associated with reduced odds of head injury, ser-
ious head injury, facial injury and fatal head injury. The reduction was greater for serious
or fatal head injury. Neck injury was rare and not associated with helmet use. These re-
sults support the use of strategies to increase the uptake of bicycle helmets as part of a
comprehensive cycling safety plan.
Key words: Cycling, injury, helmet, meta-analysis, systematic review

 Introduction
Cycling is a healthy activity and can be an efficient form of
transport; however, cycling is not without risk. Bicycle
crashes and falls are rare, but they can cause a range of
injuries from minor to permanent disability or fatality.
A recent Australian cohort study of adult cyclists estimated
0.29 crashes per 1000 km cycled (95% CI: 0.26–0.32),
with cyclists seeking medical treatment in 8% of these
crashes.1 Head injuries, in particular, are an important
fraction of cycling-related injuries. In a recent Australian
study of linked police and hospital data for cyclists in
motor vehicle collisions, 34% of hospital-admitted cyclists
had a head injury and 15% had a serious head injury.2 In a
coroner’s review of cycling fatalities in Canada, 55% of
deaths were caused by head injuries.3
Bicycle helmets are designed for head protection in the
event of a fall or crash.4 Research into helmet effectiveness
to mitigate cycling head injury has primarily consisted of
case-control and population-based studies. Alternative
study designs include laboratory testing of helmet perform-
ance in dummy crash tests and computer simulation.5–8
Randomized controlled trials in this area are not possible
due to ethical considerations.
The first large, case-control study of helmet effective-
ness found very large protective effects, estimating 85%
and 88% reductions in head and brain injury, respectively,
for helmeted cyclists relative to unhelmeted cyclists.9 Later
studies have also found protective effects, but not often to
the same extent. For example, a recent case-control study
in France found risk reductions of 24–31% (depending on
adjustment methods) for head injury and 70% for head
injuries greater than 2 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale
(AIS).10
In addition to head injuries, previous researchers have
investigated whether helmet use is associated with face or
neck injuries.11,12 In particular, a recent review found hel-
met use was protective for upper and middle facial inju-
ries;13 the evidence is mixed with regards to neck injuries,
although the incidence of such injuries is uncommon.14,15
If helmet use is associated with head, face or neck injuries,
then cyclists with any such injuries should be excluded
from the control group. Otherwise, the use of other injuries
may not be a valid control group.10,16 In practice, very few
studies limit controls to those injured below the neck.
There have been two systematic reviews with meta-
analysis published on case-control studies of bicycle helmet
effectiveness.11,17 Both reviews concluded that helmets are ef-
fective at reducing head injury in a crash, although they differ
with regards to inclusion criteria and their estimates of effect-
iveness. In a Cochrane Review, Thompson et al.17 included
studies that collected data prospectively, injuries were medic-
ally verified and analyses controlled for selection bias, obser-
vational bias or confounding. Attewell et al.,11 on the other
hand, did not exclude on the basis of study design and only
required studies report data for a 2� 2 cross-classification
table of helmet use and injury. Additionally, both reviews
included studies reporting head, brain or facial injury, and
Attewell and colleagues also included neck and fatal injury.
With regards to helmet effectiveness, Thompson and col-
leagues estimated that helmet use is associated with reduc-
tions of 63–88% in head, brain or severe brain injury.
Attewell and colleagues estimated more conservative reduc-
tions of 60% for head injury and 58% for brain injury.
A more recent meta-analysis was performed by adding
four studies to the Attewell et al. review for head, face and
neck injuries only.12,18 Elvik, in a re-analysis of previous
reviews, identified publication and trend bias and he indi-
cated that the authors of the Cochrane review have con-
flicts of interest as they co-authored four of the seven
included studies. He also identified publication bias and
time trend bias as affecting the summary estimates. Using
the trim-and-fill method to adjust for publication bias,19
Elvik reported that helmet use was associated with a 50%
reduction in head injury and a 21% reduction in face in-
jury. He also found helmet use increased the odds of neck
injury by 28% with no adjustment for publication bias.
Additionally, Elvik combined effect sizes for head, face
and neck injury into one analysis while again adjusting for
publication bias using the trim-and-fill method. He re-
ported that helmet use was associated with a 33% reduc-
tion in injury to the head, face or neck.
Elvik’s meta-analysis could also be improved. For ex-
ample, the assessment of publication bias requires an inde-
pendent review of the research literature by two authors,
Key messages
• This is the largest ever systematic review and meta-analysis of bicycle injury and helmet use, with over 64 000
injured cyclists from 40 studies.
• Bicycle helmet use was associated with reductions in head, serious head, face and fatal head injury.
• Reductions were greater for serious injury than for injuries of any severity.
• Neck and diffuse axonal injury were rare among cyclists and were not associated with helmet use.

 and this is not possible when there is a sole author.
Further, the protective effect for head, face and neck inju-
ries were assumed to be identical, although there is no evi-
dence that helmets affect different injuries in the same
manner. Importantly, such heterogeneity among effect
sizes for different body locations could be the cause of fun-
nel plot asymmetry, and not publication bias. Third, the
use of the trim-and-fill method to adjust for publication
bias is usually not recommended.20–22 Terrin et al.22 dem-
onstrated that trim-and-fill adjustment can underestimate
the true effect size when there is no publication bias, and
Simonsohn et al.21 found that this method does not gener-
ally correct for publication bias when it does exist.
Additionally, the journal published two full-length correc-
tions due to data and analytical errors.12,23
In sum, the research literature on bicycle helmet effective-
ness was last systematically reviewed by Attewell and col-
leagues in 1999, and past reviews have been criticized for
methodological weaknesses and did not account for sources
of bias. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct
an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
that assess whether helmet use mitigates head, serious head,
face, neck and fatal head injury. If publication or time trend
bias is detected, appropriate adjustment methods will be
used.
Methods
In accordance with study protocol (unpublished, available
from first author), four electronic databases (MEDLINE,
EMBASE, COMPENDEX and SCOPUS) were searched to
identify relevant articles. An initial search was performed on
2 February 2015, which was updated 26 January 2016.
Broad search terms were used (helmet* AND (cycl* OR bi-
cycle*)), to include as many studies as possible. Full-text,
English language studies were included if injuries were med-
ically
diagnosed
(i.e.
self-reported
injury
data
were
excluded), helmet status was known and data were available
to construct a 2� 2 table of injury by helmet status. When
two or more studies include data from the same source, the
study with the most complete data was included. Study au-
thors were contacted if relevant data were not published but
the study met other criteria. When published abstracts met
other inclusion criteria, a search was conducted for a full-
text report of the study and the authors were contacted. The
two study authors independently searched/assessed articles
against inclusion criteria and extracted data with adherence
to
the
PRISMA
statement.24
Conflicts
were
resolved
through discussion. A research librarian was consulted be-
fore the search for articles.
The data were categorized as relating to head, serious
head, face, neck or fatal head injuries. Head, face or neck
injuries were of any severity. Studies that reported cyclists
with AIS3þ head injuries, skull fractures, intracranial
haemorrhage, intracranial injury, loss of consciousness,
survival risk ratio less than 0.965 or head injuries reported
as ‘serious’, ‘severe’ or ‘brain’ injury were classified as ser-
ious head injury. Concussions in isolation were not con-
sidered serious head injuries, as they are usually less than
AIS3.25 The categorization of serious head injury is ap-
proximately equivalent to ‘brain injury’ from past re-
views.11,17 Studies reporting fatalities were included if
injured body regions were reported. Cycling fatalities with
multiple injuries including the head were categorized as a
head injury. Whenever possible, cyclists wearing un-
approved, no shell, foam or leather helmets were excluded
and controls were limited to those injured solely below the
neck. The information extracted from each study included
the number of injured cyclists available for analysis, the
number of cases and controls by helmet use, the country
where data were collected, whether the data were collected
prospectively or retrospectively, age categories of cyclists
included (all, child or adult), the proportion of missing hel-
met data, the proportion of males, the proportion of motor
vehicle collisions and whether injuries to the head, face or
neck were included in the controls.
A series of hierarchical random effects meta-regression
models were fit for the log odds ratio using all extracted
data. Before analysis, 0.5 was added to each cell when no
injuries were reported in any 2 � 2 table. Model 1 was a
baseline model with no moderators, Model 2 included in-
jury type as a moderator, Model 3 included a random ef-
fect for study and Model 4 included a random effect for
injury type. The final model was chosen by the likelihood
ratio test and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The
use of multivariate meta-regression methods allows the
analysis to consider the injured cyclist as a whole as
opposed to individual body regions.
Residual heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran’s Q
statistic and the index of heterogeneity I2. Publication bias
was inspected visually using funnel plots and formally
tested using the rank correlation test. Time trend bias was
inspected visually using cumulative forest plots and for-
mally tested by including year as a covariate (centred at
2016, the year of the last included study). All statistical
analyses were performed using the R metafor package.20
The data file and an R markdown file that performs all
analyses are available as supplementary material (available
as Supplementary data at IJE online).

 1190 were duplicates. A title and abstract search elimi-
nated a further 1125 records; 91 full-text articles were as-
sessed for eligibility and 48 studies did not meet study
criteria. The primary reasons for exclusion were: the in-
ability to construct a 2 � 2 table of injury by helmet sta-
tus;26–43 the study data were a subset of data used in an
included study;44–53 collected data were a case series;54–60
injuries were self-reported;61–65 the published report was
an abstract only;66–69 helmet data were unreliable;70,71 and
there was conflicting information in the paper.72,73 A fur-
ther three studies were not included in a meta-analysis as
there were too few helmeted cyclists to reliably estimate
odds ratios.74–76 The 40 studies included in the meta-
analysis comprised 64 708 injured cyclists and 89 total ef-
fect sizes (28 head, 30 serious head, 17 face, 12 neck and 2
fatal head injuries). By contrast, the most recent review by
Elvik included data on 19 580 cyclists from 20 studies.
Characteristics of the studies included for the meta-
analysis are given in Table 1. The included studies span 28
years (1989–16) representing four continents (Asia: 2,
Australia: 9, Europe: 8, North America: 21); 26 studies re-
ported multiple injury types; and only 14 studies limited
controls to injuries below the neck. Data were collected
prospectively in 23 studies and retrospectively in 17. The
reported
injuries
were
diagnosed
in:
an
emergency
department or trauma centre (n ¼ 23); a hospital which
may include emergency or trauma data (n ¼ 9); an injury
or trauma database (n ¼ 6); or coronial reports (n ¼ 2).
Although most studies reported cycling injuries for all ages
(n ¼ 24), some studies reported injuries solely for children
(n ¼ 10) or adults (n ¼ 6). Across all studies, males were
more common than females (75%, range: 48–90%) and
collisions with motor vehicles varied greatly (31%, range:
3–100%, n ¼ 8 studies missing data).
The results from the random effects meta-analysis mod-
els are given in Table 2. Model 4 was chosen as the final
model which includes injury type as a moderator and ran-
dom effects for injury type by study. The inclusion of each
model component greatly improved model fit. Study-level
moderators for continent where data were collected, set-
ting for data collection, prospective or retrospective data
collection, an indicator for mandatory helmet legislation
for data collection jurisdiction, age category, proportion of
males and proportion of cyclists in a motor vehicle colli-
sion were individually added to Model 4. None of these
moderators improved model fit or substantially modified
estimates of helmet effectiveness by injury type.
There was no strong evidence of publication bias in the
overall model (s ¼ �0.08, P ¼ 0.25) or the funnel plot of the
model residuals (see Figure 2). There is some asymmetry

 from three effect sizes taken from two small sample studies
and which therefore have little statistical weight in the ana-
lysis.77,78 There was no evidence of time trends when year
was included in the overall model (P ¼ 0.68).
A forest plot for injuries of any severity is given in
Figure 3 and a forest plot of serious and fatal head injury is
given in Figure 4. In both figures, summary estimates were
taken from Model 4. Helmet use was associated with a
51% reduction in the odds of head injury (OR ¼ 0.49,
95% CI: 0.42–0.57), a 69% reduction in serious head in-
jury (OR ¼ 0.31, 95% CI: 0.25–0.37), a 33% reduction in
facial injury (OR ¼ 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56–0.81) and a 65%

 reduction in fatal head injury (OR ¼ 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14–
0.88). The odds ratio for helmet use and neck injury was
near a null effect (OR ¼ 0.96, 95% CI: 0.74–1.25).
Discussion
This systematic review of bicycle helmet effectiveness iden-
tified 43 relevant studies of which 40 were included in a
meta-analysis. This includes 24 studies not included in pre-
vious meta-analyses (see Figure 5). The effectiveness of bi-
cycle helmets differed by injury type and, unlike a recent
review, there was no evidence of publication or time trend
bias. Helmet use among cyclists in a crash was associated
with reduced odds of head, serious head, face and fatal
head injury. In particular, the magnitude of the reduction
was greater for serious injury (serious head, OR ¼ 0.31;
fatal head, OR ¼ 0.35) than those for any injury severity
(head, OR ¼ 0.49; face, OR ¼ 0.67).
Comparison with other meta-analyses
This study differs from previous reviews and meta-analyses
in several ways. Due to criticisms of the Cochrane Review,
minimal selection criteria were chosen similar to Attewell
and colleagues; however, medically verified injuries were
required to minimize the influence of bias in self-reported
data. This eliminated three studies included in other re-
views.62,64,65 The search was also limited to English lan-
guage publications, and Elvik included two non-English
language studies–a French technical report by Amoros
et al.79 and a German medical insurance report.80 Amoros
and colleagues later published their work in an English lan-
guage journal which has been included in this review. To
assess the influence of excluded studies, the final multivari-
ate meta-regression model was refit including the three
studies with self-reported injury data and the German lan-
guage study. The summary odds ratios for each injury type
changed
very
little
(see
Table
A1,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Table 3 contrasts the current results from those in previ-
ous meta-analyses. With regards to head injury of any se-
verity, the current results are most similar to Elvik. The
inclusion of more studies, therefore, may support Elvik’s
claim that estimates of helmet effectiveness have evolved
over time. However, no evidence of time trend bias was
found and the summary results change very little if the ana-
lysis is restricted to studies published in the past 10 years
(see Table A1, available as Supplementary data at IJE on-
line). Note that any visual evidence of publication bias
vanishes when considering only recently published studies,
which may indicate higher quality data, improved diagnos-
tics or more acceptance of studies that do not pass the
P < 0.05 threshold in this area.
Similar protective effects were found for serious head
and facial injuries to those by Thompson et al. in their
Cochrane Review. Elvik was highly critical of the inclusion
criteria used in the Cochrane Review and suggested sensi-
tivity analyses be performed to assess its impact on the
summary measures. Since the inclusion criteria of this re-
view were more similar to Elvik, the final model was refit
only on studies that collected data prospectively, which is
similar to the Cochrane Review. With the exception of
studies with fatal head injury which collected data retro-
spectively, the summary estimates were similar to the final
model (see Table A1, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online).
The estimates of neck injuries differ substantially from
both Attewell et al. and Elvik. Like head injuries, the asso-
ciation of helmet use and neck injuries has lessened in mag-
nitude from the first included study (OR ¼ 1.80), to Elvik’s
estimate from four studies (OR ¼ 1.28) and then to the cur-
rent
summary
measure
that
includes
12
studies
(OR ¼ 0.96). Fatal head injury was not included in previ-
ous meta-analyses, but the current estimate is similar to
that reported by Attewell and colleagues for fatal versus
non-fatal injury by helmet use.
With the exception of the summary estimate for head
injury, the current results run counter to the most recent
meta-analysis by Elvik. No strong evidence was found of
either publication or time trend bias. There is some visual
evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, but this is due to two

 studies with small sample sizes and therefore has little to
no impact on the analysis. As a demonstration, three effect
sizes were added to the right of their summary odds ratios
to ‘balance’ the funnel plot. The summary odds ratios were
nearly identical to the final model (see Table A1, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online). Following a system-
atic search for studies, 24 studies not included in Elvik’s
meta-analysis were identified, with five published before
2011. Therefore, it is possible the previously identified
biases are partly an artefact of not performing a systematic
search for studies. Large, protective effects associated with
helmet use were found for serious or fatal head injuries
which were not included by Elvik.
Elvik also claimed that bicycle helmets offer no overall
protection to the head, face or neck, from an analysis of
‘new’ studies that estimated a summary odds ratio from
the trim-and-fill method. When Elvik’s method of analysis
was repeated to the ‘new’ studies (i.e. a no-moderator, ran-
dom effects model on head, face and neck injuries using
studies not included in Attewell and colleagues), little evi-
dence was found for funnel plot asymmetry by the rank
correlation test (s ¼ �0.08, P ¼ 0.43). The trim-and-fill
method does add five hypothetical studies; however, the
summary odds ratio changes little (OR ¼ 0.60 versus
OR ¼ 0.64) and the statistical results are not consistent
with Elvik’s results (95% CI: 0.55–0.75). Note that as
with the primary analysis where injury type is included as a
moderator, the odds ratio for head injury differs from face
(P ¼ 0.012) and neck injury (P < 0.001) and heterogeneity
is reduced compared with Elvik’s approach of combining
injury types (I2¼ 88.8% versus I2¼ 74.4% with injury
type). This suggests that helmets affect head, face and neck
injuries differentially, thereby invalidating any overall
summary measure that combines these injuries.
Risk compensation
In a series of commentaries in 2001, the Cochrane Review
was criticized for not accounting for risk compensation.81
As defined by Adams and Hillman in this context, the risk
compensation hypothesis posits that bicycle helmet use
alters a cyclist’s behaviour in a manner that offsets the pro-
tective effect of wearing a helmet in a crash. In a response,
Thompson et al.82 found little empirical support for the hy-
pothesis and called for a systematic review of the published
evidence around risk compensation and bicycle helmets.
Since this debate, there has been very little published re-
search on the topic and no systematic review.
With regards to this review, adjusted summary esti-
mates are not possible without study-level data on risk
compensation, irrespective of whether the hypothesis is
supported by evidence. For example, Messiah et al.83 used
average cycling speed as a measure of risk; however, the
speed of the cyclist at the time of a crash is unknown for
every study included in this review.
The results from two recent, large studies do shed some
light on the risk compensation hypothesis. Amoros and
colleagues used multivariable logistic regression models to
adjust for several factors including injury severity score for
injuries below the neck as a proxy for crash severity.10
Covariate adjustment increased the estimates of helmet
protectiveness, as opposed to a decrease under the risk
compensation hypothesis, for any head injury [OR ¼ 0.78,
95% CI: 0.67–0.90; adjusted OR (aOR) ¼ 0.69, 95% CI:
0.59–0.81] and for AIS3þ head injuries (OR ¼ 0.41, 95%
CI: 0.24–0.70; rural area, aOR ¼ 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02–
0.23; urban area, aOR ¼ 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15–0.65).
Bambach et al.,2 in an analysis of head injury severity for
cyclists in a motor vehicle collision using multinomial lo-
gistic regression, also adjusted for other serious injuries as
well as behavioural factors such as posted speed limit, dis-
obeying a traffic control, blood alcohol content over 5%
and riding on a footpath. Compared with possible minor
injury, the crude and adjusted odds ratios are nearly identi-
cal
for
moderate
head
injury
(OR ¼ 0.513
versus
aOR ¼ 0.506), serious head injury (OR ¼ 0.330 versus
aOR ¼ 0.378) and severe head injury (OR ¼ 0.259 versus
aOR ¼ 0.257). These results suggest that an adjustment for
risk compensation is difficult due to a lack of data and
such an adjustment may also be unnecessary.
Neck and diffuse axonal injury
In his meta-analysis, Elvik found that helmet use was asso-
ciated with increased odds of neck injury; however, the in-
clusion of more studies brings those results into question.
The current estimate of helmet use and neck injuries is near
a
null
effect
(OR ¼ 0.96,
95%
CI:
0.74–1.25).
Additionally, the review of the literature found that neck
injury is not common and usually of low severity.
McDermott et al.14 found that 3.8% (65/1710) of injured
cyclists had neck injuries, with only four with severities
greater than AIS1. Airaksinen et al.84 reported 300 injuries
from 216 cyclists, of which there were two AIS1 neck inju-
ries and no AIS2þ neck injuries. From data found in the
publication or provided by the authors, the proportion of
neck injured cyclists was 2.5% (76/3004) for Rivara
et al.,15 0.3% (2/682) for Sze et al.,85 6.3% (529/8373) for
Amoros et al.,10 0.9% (1/110) for Dinh et al.86, 3.6% (5/

 et al.,93 1.6% (11/699) for Sethi et al.94 and 1.5% (57/
3711) for Olofsson et al.95 The proportion of those with
head injuries was always much greater except for Rivara
et al. and Hooten and Murad, who did not report head
injuries. Across all studies, the proportion of cyclists with
neck injuries (2.6%) was much less than of those with inju-
ries to the head (29.0%), serious head (7.4%) or face
(21.9%).
Some authors have posited that helmet use exacerbates
the occurrence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI), which has
prompted biomechanical research into helmet use and an-
gular acceleration.5 There is biomechanical evidence that
rotational forces are associated with certain types of brain
injuries;96 however, there is a paucity of research on the in-
fluence of helmet use on head rotation, although recent
biomechanical studies suggest a protective effect of hel-
mets.5,6 Like neck injuries, this review found a DAI

 diagnosis is rare among cyclists in a crash. There were no
DAI diagnoses reported by Dinh et al.86 (0/110), McIntosh
et al.25 (0/137) or Malczyk et al.97 (0/239), whereas
Javouhey et al.50 reported DAI in 2.3% of cyclists (28/
1238). Sethi and colleagues94 reported DAI in 2/225 unhel-
meted cyclists and 1/110 helmeted cyclists (OR ¼ 1.02,
P ¼ 0.99), and Bambach et al.2 identified only 0.1% (8/
6745) of cyclists in a motor vehicle collision that met one
criterion for DAI. There is some evidence in the motorcycle
helmet literature that travel speed interacts with helmet ef-
fectiveness,98 i.e. there is a threshold where helmet use
switches from beneficial to detrimental. However, this
study estimated a switch at 124 km/h which is only pos-
sible under extreme conditions on a bicycle.
Mandatory helmet legislation
The legislation of mandatory helmets for cyclists is a con-
troversial topic, and past research on its effectiveness has
been somewhat mixed. A 2008 Cochrane Review con-
cluded that helmet legislation was beneficial,99 whereas
later studies found benefits,89,100,101 no effect102 or mixed
results by gender.103 Irrespective of past research, the re-
sults of this review do not support arguments against hel-
met legislation from an injury prevention perspective. With
consideration of the difficulty in generalizing a meta-
analysis of case-control studies to a population level, these
results could be used as one source of evidence for the pro-
motion of bicycle helmets for mitigating head, serious
head, face and fatal head injuries without increased risk of
other injuries. However, bicycle helmets are not a panacea
for cycling injury, as they do not eliminate head or face in-
jury and they do not offer protection to other body regions.
Any comprehensive cycling safety strategy should consider
the promotion or legislation of bicycle helmets only in con-
cert with other injury prevention strategies.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this systematic review and
meta-analysis. Several relevant studies were not included
due to lack of or unreliable published data (n ¼ 22), or the
study only reported data on cases (n ¼ 7) or the published
report was an abstract only (n ¼ 4). Whenever relevant
data were missing from the published paper, study authors
were contacted. In the 33 instances described above, study
authors did not supply relevant information to warrant in-
clusion in the meta-analysis or the study authors did not re-
spond to communication. Data were provided on cases not
reported in the publication or the number of cyclists
injured below the neck for 11 other studies.2,85–87,89–
91,93,95,104,105 Many of the reviewed studies were published
10 or more years ago, and this is likely the reason for the
poor response rate.
There was a moderate to high amount of residual het-
erogeneity
among
effect
sizes
in
the
final
model
(I2¼ 68.1%). This may have been influenced by a wide
variety of injury definitions from study to study, although
analysis of individual injury types indicates this is primarily
for
head
injury
of
any
severity
and
facial
injuries
(I2¼ 84.0% for head, I2¼ 78.9% for face) as there was
much less heterogeneity for serious head injury (I2¼ 42.3)
or neck injury (I2¼ 35.7%). The high level of heterogeneity
may also be due to differences in the cycling environment,
attitudes towards cyclists by other road users or differences
in bicycle helmet standards adopted by the USA (CPSC),
Europe (EN 1078) and Australia/New Zealand (AS/NZS
2063). When continent is used as a moderator for helmet
use and head injury of any severity, heterogeneity is
reduced somewhat (I2¼ 74.3%) and the summary odds
ratios vary considerably (Australia, OR ¼ 0.42; Asia,
OR ¼ 0.55;
Europe,
OR ¼ 0.62;
North
America,
OR ¼ 0.45). However, the inclusion of continent does not
improve model fit (AIC: 46.4 versus 44.5, LRT ¼ 4.14,
P ¼ 0.247).
The statistical methods used assume that the log odds
ratios are independent between studies, although it is

 possible that an injured cyclist could be included in more
than one study. The influence of double counting was
minimized by excluding studies whose data were a subset
of another study. For example, data from the German In-
Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) were used in five stud-
ies,46,51,52,60,106 and the article with the most complete
data that met inclusion criteria was included. It was not
possible to choose one study for a series of studies from
New South Wales, Australia.2,25,86,107 The study by
Bambach and colleagues covers a much longer period of
time than the other studies; however, they limited the study
population to police-reported motor vehicle collisions. The
other studies included all admissions regardless of injury
mechanism or whether the incident was reported to the po-
lice. To assess the influence of these potentially related
studies, the analysis was repeated only including the NSW
study with the most conservative odds ratios, and the re-
sults did not change appreciably (see Table A1, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online).
If helmet use has an influence on head, face or neck
injuries, cyclists with those injuries should be excluded
from the control group. Poorly chosen controls could bias
the statistical results. Of the 14 studies with data on cyc-
lists injured solely below the neck, only three included
these data in the published report. To investigate the influ-
ence of choice of controls, the final model was re-analysed
only with studies with no head, face or neck controls. The
results were similar to the analysis on the full data with the
exception of fatal head injury (see Table A1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). This discrepancy is due
to the inclusion of only one fatal head injury study.
There were only two studies that reported fatal head in-
jury, and the summary estimates could be greatly improved
with more research using coronial data. Two studies re-
ported no serious head injuries for helmeted cyclists, and a
continuity correction of adding 0.5 to each cell was used to
allow for estimation of the log odds ratio and its variance.
This method is known to perform poorly in some circum-
stances.108 The analysis was repeated using a random ef-
fects logistic regression model in SAS PROC GLIMMIX
which does not require adjustment of the raw data. The
summary odds ratios for each injury type did not change
appreciably (see Table A1, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online).
Conclusion
Helmet use is associated with odds reductions of 51% for
head injury, 69% for serious head injury, 33% for face in-
jury and 65% for fatal head injury. Injuries to the neck
were rare and not associated with helmet use. These results
suggest that strategies to increase the uptake of bicycle
helmets should be considered along with other injury pre-
vention strategies as part of a comprehensive cycling safety
plan.
