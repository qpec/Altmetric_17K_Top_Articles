Abstract
Background: The effect of infant feeding practices on the development of food allergy 
remains controversial. We examined the relationship between timing and patterns of 
food introduction and sensitization to foods at age 1 year in the Canadian Healthy 
Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study.
Methods: Nutrition questionnaire data prospectively collected at age 3, 6, 12, 18, and 
24 months were used to determine timing of introduction of cow’s milk products, egg, 
and peanut. At age 1 year, infants underwent skin prick testing to cow’s milk, egg 
white, and peanut. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the impact of tim-
ing of food exposures on sensitization outcomes, and latent class analysis was used to 
study patterns of food introduction within the cohort.
Results: Among 2124 children with sufficient data, delaying introduction of cow’s milk 
products, egg, and peanut beyond the first year of life significantly increased the odds of 
sensitization to that food (cow’s milk adjOR 3.69, 95% CI 1.37- 
9.08; egg adjOR 1.89, 95% 
CI 1.25- 
2.80; peanut adjOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.07- 
3.01). Latent class analysis produced a 
three- 
class model: early, usual, and delayed introduction. A pattern of delayed introduc-
tion, characterized by avoidance of egg and peanut during the first year of life, increased 
the odds of sensitization to any of the three tested foods (adjOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.26- 
2.49).
Conclusions: Avoidance of potentially allergenic foods during the first year of life sig-
nificantly increased the odds of sensitization to the corresponding foods.

1 | INTRODUCTION
The effect of timing of food introduction on the development of 
food allergy remains controversial. In 2000, infants at high risk 
for atopy were recommended to delay introduction of cow’s milk 
products until 1 year; eggs until 2 years; and peanuts until 3 years 
of age.1 In 2006, a review of 52 studies reaffirmed concerns that 
early food introduction increased the risk of food allergy.2 In 2008, 
results from later studies3,4 suggested only weak evidence for de-
laying introduction of complementary foods beyond 4- 
6 months 
of age.5 More recent birth cohort6-8 and cross- 
sectional studies9,10 
now suggest that early food introduction may protect against atopic

diseases. In the Learning Early About Peanut allergy (LEAP) Study, 
infants randomized to regular peanut consumption had a greatly re-
duced risk of peanut allergy at 5 years.11 Most infant feeding guide-
lines currently indicate that parents should not delay introduction 
of “allergenic” foods beyond 4- 
6 months, provided that children are 
developmentally ready.12,13
However, a recent trial has again cast doubt on the safety 
and efficacy of early feeding of allergenic foods, particularly egg. 
Infants not already sensitized to egg at 4- 
6 months were random-
ized to receive either verum (egg white powder) or placebo.14 At 
age 1 year, egg sensitization in the verum group was doubled com-
pared with the placebo group, although statistical significance was 
not reached.
The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) 
Study, a population- 
based prospective birth cohort,15 has extensive 
longitudinal data on breastfeeding, formula, and solid food con-
sumption, and one of the few databases with skin test reactivity at 
age 1. We examined the relationship between timing of introduction 
of specific “allergenic” foods and sensitization to those foods at age 
1 year.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Subjects and study design
From 2008 to 12, 3495 pregnant women recruited from the general 
population in Toronto, Manitoba, Edmonton, and Vancouver, with 
local Research Ethics Board approval, commenced the longitudinal 
study. 2124 children included in this analysis all had skin testing be-
tween 9 and 18 months of age, skin prick test data for both mothers 
and fathers, and sufficient data to determine timing of introduction of 
cow’s milk products, egg, and peanut.
2.2 | Food introduction data
Nutrition data were collected at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. To 
reduce recall bias, the first positive report of feeding for each food 
(cow’s milk products, egg, and peanut) was used. The timing ranges 
were as follows: introduced between birth and 6 months; introduced 
between 7 and 12 months; or avoided during the first year. Cow’s milk 
products encompassed cow’s milk, dairy products (eg, yogurt, cheese, 
ice cream, butter), and cow’s milk- 
based infant formula. Duration of 
any breastfeeding was defined by the earliest parent report of breast-
feeding cessation.
2.3 | Skin prick testing
Infants underwent standardized skin prick testing at their 1- 
year as-
sessment to six inhalant (Alternaria, house- 
dust mite [Der p and Der 
f], cat, dog, and cockroach) and four food (cow’s milk, egg white, pea-
nut, and soybean) allergens (ALK Abello, Mississauga, ON, Canada) 
using Duotip- 
Test® II devices (Lincoln Diagnostics Inc., Decatur, IL, 
USA). Parents were tested with 13 inhalant allergens and peanut. 
Food sensitization was defined as a positive skin prick test (wheal 
diameter ≥2 mm greater than negative control) to cow’s milk, egg 
white, or peanut. Soy was excluded from analyses due to few intro-
duction and sensitization events. Parental atopy was defined by ≥1 
positive skin tests.
2.4 | Statistical analyses
2.4.1 | Confounders
Factors considered for possible confounding effects were assessed 
pairwise for associations with food sensitization outcomes and for 
their balance between the different ranges of timing of cow’s milk 
products, egg, and peanut introduction. Significance levels for as-
sociations and balance were obtained using chi- 
square tests or 
Fisher’s exact tests of independence; those associated (P<.2) with 
both outcomes and exposures were included as covariates in all 
subsequent multivariate models. Study center, firstborn status, 
maternal and paternal atopy, self- 
reported paternal peanut allergy, 
maternal pollen, milk, egg, and peanut allergies, as well as maternal 
and paternal ethnicity, were included in further regression analyses 
as possible confounders. Although not significantly associated with 
the outcomes, the duration of breastfeeding has been associated 
with allergic sensitization,16-19 and thus, we retained it as a poten-
tial confounder.
2.4.2 | Logistic regression
Multivariate penalized (Firth) logistic regressions were fitted to as-
sess the associations between timing of individual food introduction 
and patterns of food introduction, respectively, with food sensitiza-
tion outcomes at age 1 year, adjusting for potential confounders. Four 
outcomes were considered: sensitization to cow’s milk, egg white, 
peanut, and to any of the three allergens.
2.4.3 | Pattern of food introduction
Latent class analysis (LCA) was used as an unsupervised explanatory 
tool to reveal feeding patterns in relation to timing of introduction to 
cow’s milk products, egg, and peanut.
2.4.4 | Reverse causality sensitivity analysis
To assess potential reverse causality whereby food introduction was 
delayed due to early allergic manifestations, we performed sensi-
tivity analyses excluding infants with eczema/atopic dermatitis or 
hives before age 6 months, determined by parental reports of these 
diagnoses by a physician or healthcare professional. Infants with a 
history of a wet or red rash on the face, inside elbows, wrist/hands, 
or the back of the knees were also excluded, whether or not diag-
nosed as having atopic dermatitis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed in R version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria).

3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Study sample characteristics
Of 2124 children, 54% were male and 76% were delivered vaginally 
(Table 1). Maternal and paternal atopy was common: 58% of moth-
ers and 68% of fathers had one or more positive skin prick tests 
(Table S2). Parents self- 
reported predominantly White Caucasian 
ethnicity (76%) and high socioeconomic status (54% with income 
≥$100 000).
At 3 months, 87% of infants were being breastfed, 62% exclu-
sively (Table 1). At 6 months, 77% of infants were breastfeeding, but 
exclusive breastfeeding had decreased to 19%. The average duration 
of exclusive breastfeeding was 3.3 months, and of any breastfeeding 
11.2 months.
3.2 | Infant feeding practices
Cow’s milk products were given to 45% of infants in the first 6 months 
and to 97% by 1 year (Table 1), dominantly as cow’s milk- 
based for-
mula. Parents rarely introduced egg before 6 months (3%), with most 
introducing egg between 7 and 12 months (76%). Very few parents 
introduced peanut before 6 months (1%); more introduced peanut be-
tween 7 and 12 months (36%), but most parents (63%) avoided giving 
peanut during the first year of life.
3.3 | Timing of introduction of individual foods and 
food sensitization
Avoidance of these potentially allergenic foods during the first year 
of life was associated with an increased risk of food sensitization 
at age 1 year, after adjusting for potential confounders including 
breastfeeding (Table 2). The odds of sensitization to any of cow’s 
milk, egg white, or peanut were significantly elevated in infants 
who avoided egg (adjOR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.44- 
2.82) and peanut 
(adjOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.07- 
2.10) during the first year. Introducing 
cow’s milk products between 0 and 6 months of age, compared to 
7- 
12 months, was highly protective against the development of 
cow’s milk sensitization (adjOR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10- 
0.70), whereas 
avoidance of cow’s milk products during the first year of life greatly 
increased the risk of sensitization (adjOR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.37- 
9.08). 
Avoidance of egg and peanut during the first year of life similarly 
increased the risk of sensitization to the corresponding food aller-
gens (egg adjOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.25- 
2.80; peanut adjOR: 1.76, 95% 
CI: 1.07- 
3.01). These effects related to egg and peanut remained 
statistically significant after excluding children with atopic dermati-
tis before age 6 months, indicating low evidence for reverse causal-
ity (Table 2).
3.4 | Patterns of food introduction
The latent class model revealed early (n=50), usual (n=1653), and 
delayed (n=421) patterns of feeding (Table 3). The small “early 
feeding” group was composed predominantly of infants who 
were introduced to cow’s milk products (98% of group) and egg 
(100%) by 6 months of age, while many (62%) of these 50 were 
also introduced to peanut before age 1 year. The “usual feeding” 
group was uniquely characterized by introduction of egg between 
7 and 12 months of age (96% of the group). The “delayed feed-
ing” group was marked by avoidance of egg (93% of the group) and

increased the risk of sensitization to egg white (adjOR: 1.67, 95%

eczema/atopic dermatitis or hives before age 6 months were ex-
cluded, although statistical significance was lost due to the smaller 
sample size (Table 4).
4 | DISCUSSION
Many Canadian infants were introduced to cow’s milk products during 
the first 6 months of life, but parents often delayed introduction of egg 
and especially peanut beyond age 12 months. These feeding patterns 
were observed despite recommendations published in the year that 
study recruitment began, which stated that parents need not delay

introduction of complementary foods beyond 4- 
6 months of age.5 
Avoidance of cow’s milk products, egg, and peanut during the first 
year was associated with significantly increased odds of sensitization 
to the corresponding foods at age 1 year. Early introduction of cow’s 
milk products and egg between 0 and 6 months, vs 7- 
12 months, did 
not increase the risk of food sensitization. Introduction of cow’s milk 
products before 6 months of age was, in fact, highly protective against 
the development of sensitization to cow’s milk.
Besides assessing individual foods, we identified three distinct pat-
terns of introduction across the foods assessed in our study. Compared 
to usual feeding, a pattern of delayed feeding, characterized by avoid-
ance of egg and peanut during the first year, was associated with signifi-
cantly increased odds of sensitization to egg white, peanut, and to any 
of the three tested food allergens. All results were adjusted for potential 
confounding factors, and we found low evidence for reverse causality.
Previous observational studies have focused on single food aller-
gens,3,7,9,10 outcomes in later childhood,4,6,8,20 and/or studied high- 
risk 
cohorts.6 To our knowledge, this is the first observational study to ex-
amine the introduction of multiple foods in relation to food sensitiza-
tion during infancy in a general population- 
based cohort.
The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) randomized controlled trial 
found reduced food allergy in children randomized to early introduc-
tion of six allergenic foods, vs standard timing.21 Our study confirms 
these results in a general population- 
based birth cohort, namely that 
earlier food introduction is more beneficial for allergy prevention than 
food avoidance. Our results are also consistent with a recent system-
atic review and meta- 
analysis, which found moderate- 
certainty evi-
dence that early egg introduction between age 4 and 6 months, and 
early peanut introduction between age 4 and 11 months, were asso-
ciated with reduced egg and peanut allergy, respectively.22 Hence, 
the study provides epidemiological support to the changing paradigm 
that early exposure to food antigens can induce tolerance rather than 
sensitization.
Our findings contradict results from a recent randomized con-
trolled trial of early egg consumption.14 Infants not sensitized to hen’s 
egg at age 4- 
6 months were randomized to receive either verum (egg 
white powder) or placebo until age 1 year, under a concurrent egg- 
avoidance diet. At age 1 year, the risk of egg sensitization in the verum 
group was double that in the placebo group (RR=2.20), although sta-
tistical significance was not reached. In another study, infants aged 
4- 
6.5 months, with atopic mothers but no eczema, were randomized 
to daily pasteurized whole egg powder or a color- 
matched rice pow-
der.23 All infants avoided egg until their first exposure to cooked egg at 
10 months. Between the two groups, there was no significant differ-
ence in the proportion of infants with IgE- 
mediated egg allergy.
In our study, infants who avoided egg until after 1 year were at 
significantly increased risk of egg white sensitization, although there 
was no significant difference in sensitization at 1 year between infants 
introduced to egg before 6 months or between 7 and 12 months. We 
were not able to assess sensitization to food allergens prior to food 
introduction, as Bellach et al.14 did, or the number of perceived or con-
firmed allergic reactions to foods, as Palmer et al.23 reported. Both of 
these recent trials suggest that many infants are already allergic to 
egg by 4- 
6 months.14,23 Elevated T helper type 2 (TH2) cytokine re-
sponses at age 4 months, particularly interleukin- 
5 (IL- 
5) and IL- 
13, 
may predict egg allergy at age 1 year, and are unaltered by dietary egg 
introduction.24
It is clear from our study that food sensitization may occur among 
infants who reportedly had not ingested the food(s) in question. Our 
results may therefore have been influenced by unmeasured variables. 
One possible explanation is that small amounts of allergen could have 
been present in breast milk or hidden in foods,25,26 especially egg- 
containing foods. Infants may have developed cutaneous sensitiza-
tion through non- 
oral routes such as the skin and respiratory tract. 
An association between use of peanut- 
containing skin care products 
and peanut allergy has been observed.27 Moreover, food allergens in

the home environment could cause sensitization. A Norwegian study 
found peanut allergen in 41%, milk allergen in 39%, and egg allergen 
in 22% of samples of mattress dust.28 Another study detected peanut 
allergen in 19 of 21 households in the eating area or in bed; levels in 
house dust correlated with the frequency of peanut consumption.29 
These studies suggest that infants may be inadvertently exposed to 
food allergens through inhalation or cutaneous contact leading to food 
sensitization.
4.1 | Strengths and limitations of the study
Strengths of our study include prospective data collection reducing 
recall bias; large sample size; extensive data on potential confounding 
variables allowing adjustment in regression modeling; objective as-
sessment of atopy by skin prick testing; and use of latent class analy-
sis to identify patterns of food introduction. We also examined the 
potential for reverse causality, as in previous studies,4,6 by conducting 
a sensitivity analysis excluding infants with eczema/atopic dermatitis 
or hives by age 6 months.
Several limitations are noted. To reduce the burden of this multi-
disciplinary longitudinal study, daily food diaries were not used, po-
tentially allowing recall bias. To minimize this, we used the first parent 
report of food introduction and broad ranges for timing of food intro-
duction (0- 
6 months, 7- 
12 months, or avoided during the first year). 
We could not conduct oral food challenges to confirm food allergy 
in sensitized infants. While early life food sensitization is often asso-
ciated with allergic diseases in later childhood, many food- 
sensitized 
infants do not develop allergic symptoms. Lastly, the families in our co-
hort had higher household income than the general Canadian popula-
tion, meaning that the results may not be fully generalizable, although 
univariate analysis did not show an association between household 
income and food sensitization outcomes.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
Infant diet provides a modifiable factor for reducing the risk of allergy 
development. Most parents introduced cow’s milk products, particu-
larly cow’s milk- 
based formula, early in life, but hesitated to intro-
duce egg, and delayed peanut introduction beyond age 1. Avoidance 
of these foods during the first year was associated with significantly 
increased odds of sensitization to the corresponding foods at 1 year. 
Across all three foods, a pattern of delayed food introduction was 
associated with significantly increased odds of food sensitization. 
Our epidemiological findings support the paradigm shift away from 
avoidance to early food introduction for reducing allergy.
