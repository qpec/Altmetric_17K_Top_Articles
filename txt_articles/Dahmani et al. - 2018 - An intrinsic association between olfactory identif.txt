It was recently proposed that olfaction evolved to aid navigation. Consistent with this
hypothesis, olfactory identification and spatial memory are linked to overlapping brain areas
which include the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus. However, the relationship between
these two processes has never been specifically investigated. Here, we show that olfactory
identification covaries with spatial memory in humans. We also found that the cortical
thickness of the left medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the volume of the right hippocampus,
predict both olfactory identification and spatial memory. Finally, we demonstrate deficits in
both olfactory identification and spatial memory in patients with lesions of the medial orbi-
tofrontal cortex. Our findings reveal an intrinsic relationship between olfaction and spatial
memory that is supported by a shared reliance on the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal
cortex. This relationship may find its roots in the parallel evolution of the olfactory and
hippocampal systems.

ecently, it was suggested that the primary function of
olfaction is navigation, a hypothesis termed the olfactory
spatial hypothesis1. There is evidence that olfaction and
navigation are two processes that may be linked: the size of the
olfactory bulb, or its equivalent, covaries with hippocampal size in
many mammals2 and with navigational demand in many animals,
including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and arthropods1. This is
particularly striking given that all animals use chemical cues to
navigate, find food, or avoid predation, while vision and audition
are less common and not present in all animals1,3. Together, these
pieces of evidence indicate that navigation and olfaction may be
intrinsically linked. If this is the case, we would expect olfactory
performance to covary with navigation ability.
When it comes to navigation, there are different strategies that
can be used to learn to find our way, and these strategies are
supported by distinct memory systems. The spatial memory
strategy, which involves learning the relationships between the
landmarks in the environment and building a cognitive map4,
relies on a network of areas that includes the hippocampus and
the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC)5–7. The stimulus-
response strategy, on the other hand, is a habit-based form of
navigation and involves making stimulus-response associations8,
such as learning a series of motor actions in response to stimuli
(e.g., turn left at the brown building). This strategy develops when
one routinely travels the same route6,9, and critically relies on the
caudate nucleus8,10. Thus, navigation is a broad process that
includes two distinct strategies or categories, one being spatial
learning and memory (spatial memory strategy) and the other
being
stimulus-response
learning
and
memory
(stimulus-
response strategy).
We hypothesized that olfactory identification would be speci-
fically associated with the spatial memory strategy and not the
stimulus-response strategy. Animals who learn to navigate in a
new environment are more likely to use a spatial memory strat-
egy11, possibly because learning the relationships between dif-
ferent cues (olfactory or otherwise) and landmarks allows for
more flexible behavior, and thus more adaptive responses, com-
pared to stimulus-response navigation which is rigid in nature4.
Integrating olfactory or chemosensory information into a cogni-
tive map is a crucial step for most animals, for example when
learning where food is located. There is already some evidence
that olfactory identification may be associated with spatial
memory, as both processes appear to involve similar brain
regions, which amongst others include the hippocampus and
orbitofrontal cortex5–7,12–18. However, this has not been tested
directly.
In two studies, we sought direct evidence that olfactory iden-
tification and spatial memory are related to one another, and
tested the hypothesis that such a relationship reflects shared
neural substrates. In the first study, we investigated the rela-
tionship between olfactory identification and navigation, and
found olfactory identification to be specifically associated with
spatial memory. We additionally found that structural measures
of the mOFC and hippocampus are associated with olfactory
identification and spatial memory. The critical role of the hip-
pocampus in spatial memory16,19–21 and olfaction17,18,22,23 has
already been demonstrated in human lesion studies. The mOFC,
while critical to olfaction18,24,25, has not yet been demonstrated to
be critical to spatial memory. Therefore, in the second study, we
sought to fill this gap in the literature by testing the critical role of
the mOFC in both olfactory identification and spatial memory,
and found patients with mOFC damage to exhibit impairments in
both processes.
Results
Olfactory identification and spatial memory are correlated. In a
neuroimaging study, we assessed olfactory identification, navi-
gation, and measured mOFC cortical thickness and hippocampal
volumes in 57 healthy young adult participants. To evaluate
navigation, we used two tasks. One is a wayfinding task26, which
measures the ability to build and use a cognitive map of a virtual
environment containing landmarks (e.g., pool, shops, etc.), and
which therefore requires using spatial memory. This type of
spatial memory task has been shown to rely on the hippo-
campus9. To assess whether olfactory identification is specifically
associated with spatial memory and not all forms of navigation,
we also included a dual-solution task, called the 4-on-8 virtual
maze (4/8 VM), which can be solved using either a spatial
memory or stimulus-response strategy in the same sample of
participants. We hypothesized in this study that olfactory iden-
tification would be associated with spatial—and not stimulus-
response—learning and memory, and that only spatial learners
would show an association between navigation, olfactory identi-
fication, and mOFC and hippocampal structure measures. Details
on the analyses are described in the Methods section.
The correlation between olfactory identification task and
wayfinding (Fig. 1a) performance was first tested. We found a
significant positive correlation between olfactory identification
and the percentage of target destinations found, controlling for
sex (r = 0.26, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [0.06, 0.45]) (Fig. 1b) and a
significant negative correlation with path tortuosity, a measure of

Participants first explore the town for at least 20 min, until they have visited every street and alley and passed by each key landmark twice. Then, in eight
probe trials, participants are placed in front of one landmark and are asked to find the most direct route to another given landmark. b We found olfactory
identification to be positively correlated with the percentage of target locations found (r = 0.26, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [0.06, 0.45])

 path indirectness (r = −0.26, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.43,
–0.08]). These findings suggest that the two processes are indeed
related; better olfactory identification is associated with better
spatial memory, as measured by wayfinding ability.
Next, we investigated whether olfactory identification was
specifically related to spatial memory, or whether it was
associated with other types of navigation, in this case stimulus-
response learning. We looked at performance on the 4/8 VM
(Fig. 2a) and found, at the group level, a significant negative
correlation between olfactory identification and average naviga-
tional learning errors made on the 4/8 VM (r = −0.37, Bootstrap
BCa 95% CI [−0.52, −0.21]) (Fig. 2b). This indicates that the
greater the ability to identify odors, the fewer errors were made
while learning the location of the objects, a finding consistent
with the wayfinding results. When we looked at those who used a
spatial memory strategy ('spatial learners') and those who used a
stimulus-response strategy ('response learners') separately, we
found that the correlation was driven by the spatial learners.
Spatial learners (n = 24) showed a strong and significant negative
association between olfactory identification and average naviga-
tional learning errors (r = −0.57, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.77,
−0.33]) (Fig. 2c, left), while response learners (n = 33) did not
show this association (r = −0.22, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.49,
0.14]) (Fig. 2c, right). To ensure that the lack of an association in
response learners was not due to a ceiling effect, as their average
navigational learning errors was lower than that of spatial
learners (mean difference = –0.90, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−1.39,
−0.39]), we conducted the same analysis based on a trial where
spatial and response learners did not significantly differ in the
number of errors they made. While spatial and response learners
significantly differed in the first trial (mean difference = −2.52,
Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−3.49, −1.47]), they did not significantly

Fig. 2 Olfactory identification correlates with spatial memory. a The 4-on-8 Virtual Maze (4/8 VM) consists in an 8-arm radial maze surrounded by
landmarks. In Part 1, four of the paths are blocked and four are open. Participants have to retrieve objects at the end of the open paths. In Part 2, the barriers
are removed. Participants have to avoid the paths they visited in Part 1 to retrieve the remaining objects. They can learn the object locations using a spatial
memory strategy (e.g., “the path is to the left of the boulder”) or a stimulus-response strategy (“From the starting position, I have to take the path straight
ahead and then skip a path on the right”). Once participants learn the task to criterion, they are taken to a probe stage, where a wall is raised around the
maze which hides the landmarks. People who used a spatial memory strategy during learning ('spatial learners') make more errors than people who used
a stimulus-response strategy ('response learners'), as they can no longer use landmarks to find the target paths. At the end of the task, participants
complete a verbal report, which serves to determine the strategy they used as well as the number of landmarks they used (e.g., “I used the rock and the
tree to find the objects”) and noticed (e.g., “I saw a mountain but I did not use it”). b There was a negative correlation between olfactory identification and
the average number of navigational errors made in Part 2 of the learning trials (r = −0.37, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.52, −0.21]). c When we looked
within navigation strategies, we found that this effect was driven by spatial learners (left) (r = −0.57, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.77, −0.33]), while
response learners did not show such a relationship (right) (r = −0.22, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.49, 0.14]). Thus, it appears that the relationship
between olfactory identification and navigation is specific to those who use a hippocampal-dependent navigation strategy. In other words, olfactory
identification correlates with spatial learning, but not with stimulus-response learning

 differ on the second trial of the 4/8 VM (mean difference = 0.13,
Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.46, 0.75]). We proceeded to calculate
the correlation between olfactory identification and the number
of navigational learning errors made on the second trial. Within
spatial learners, there was a significant correlation (r = −0.61,
Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.81, −0.24]), whereby better olfactory
identification was associated with fewer navigational learning
errors, while response learners showed no such correlation (r =
−0.18, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [–0.59, 0.33]. Thus, this analysis
shows that the initial effect we found between olfactory
identification and spatial memory is not due to a ceiling effect
in response learners. Together, these results argue that the
association between navigation and olfactory identification is only
present in those who use hippocampus-dependent navigation
strategies.
mOFC thickness predicts olfaction and spatial memory. We
then investigated the gray matter structure of two brain regions
shown to be involved in olfactory identification and spatial
memory in separate reports: the mOFC and hippocampus. We
also included the caudate nucleus as a control region.
In terms of the mOFC, spatial learners (n = 23) exhibited a
significant positive correlation between left mOFC cortical
thickness and olfactory identification (r = 0.33, Bootstrap BCa
95% CI [0.02, 0.64]) (Fig. 3a, left) and a significant negative
correlation between left mOFC cortical thickness and average
navigational learning errors (r = −0.49, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI
[−0.69, −0.24]) (Fig. 3a, right). These results indicate that greater
mOFC cortical thickness is associated with both fewer errors
during spatial learning and better olfactory identification. In
response learners (n = 31), there was no significant correlation
between left mOFC cortical thickness and olfactory identification
(r = 0.23, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.07, 0.59]) (Fig. 3b, left).

Fig. 3 Left medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) cortical thickness correlates with both olfactory identification and spatial memory. a We measured mOFC

 navigational learning errors, on the other hand, did significantly
correlate with right mOFC cortical thickness in both strategy
groups, albeit in different directions. In spatial learners, this
correlation was negative, in that greater cortical thickness was
associated with fewer errors (r = −0.49, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI
[−0.70, −0.16], consistent with left mOFC results. In response
learners, the correlation was positive (r = 0.34, Bootstrap BCa
95% CI [0.05, 0.60]), indicating an interference effect, as was seen
with the left mOFC. Thus, as hypothesized, greater mOFC
cortical thickness covaries positively with both navigational
learning and olfactory identification within spatial learners. This
was true for the left mOFC. While the right mOFC also showed a

learners,

Hippocampal volume predicts olfaction and spatial memory.
We hypothesized that, similar to the mOFC results, hippocampal
volume would show an association with olfactory identification
and navigational learning within spatial learners but not response
learners. In spatial learners (n = 23), there was a significant
positive correlation between right hippocampal volume and
olfactory identification (r = 0.32, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [0.03,
0.60]) (Fig. 4a, left) and a significant negative correlation between
right hippocampal volume and average navigational learning
errors (r = −0.51, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.75, −0.20])
(Fig. 4a, right). Response learners (n = 32) did not show these
associations: there were no correlations between right hippo-
campal volume and olfactory identification (r = 0.08, Bootstrap
BCa 95% CI [−0.32, 0.35]) (Fig. 4b, left), or average navigational
learning errors (r = −0.03, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.42, 0.28])
(Fig. 4b, right). At the whole-group level, combining spatial and
response learners, there were non-significant correlations between
right hippocampal volume and olfactory identification (r = 0.17,
Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.09, 0.38] and between right hippo-
campal volume and average navigational learning errors (r =
−0.30, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.57, 0.03]. In terms of the left
hippocampus, there were no significant correlations with olfac-
tory identification in either spatial learners (r = 0.11, Bootstrap
BCa 95% CI [−0.22, 0.46]) or response learners (r = 0.09, Boot-
strap BCa 95% CI [-0.29, 0.37]). Similarly, there were no sig-
nificant correlations between left hippocampal volume and
average navigational learning errors in either spatial learners (r =
−0.38, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.70, 0.10]) or response learners
(r = −0.11, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.40, 0.12]). These analyses

 indicate that greater volume of the right hippocampus is asso-
ciated with better olfactory identification and fewer navigational
learning errors within spatial learners. In accordance with our
hypotheses, only those who relied on hippocampus-dependent
navigation strategies (spatial memory) exhibited an association
between navigational learning, olfactory identification, and hip-
pocampal volume.
The control region, the caudate nucleus, showed no signifi-
cant associations with olfactory identification nor with naviga-
tional learning within either strategy group. In spatial learners,
there was no significant correlation between caudate nucleus
volume and either olfactory identification (left caudate: r = 0.28,
Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.20, 0.63]; right caudate: r = 0.30,
Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.19, 0.64]), or average navigational
learning errors (left caudate: r = −0.28, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI
[−0.65, 0.13]; right caudate: r = −0.32, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI
[−0.66, 0.07]). The results were the same in response learners:
there was no significant association between caudate nucleus
volume and either olfactory identification (left caudate: r =
−0.21, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.12, 0.52]; right caudate: r =
−0.21, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.17, 0.60]), or average
navigational learning errors (left caudate: r = 0.00, Bootstrap
BCa 95% CI [−0.36, 0.37]; right caudate: r = −0.003, Bootstrap
BCa 95% CI [−0.38, 0.38]). These control analyses serve to
support the specificity of the connection of the mOFC and
hippocampus with olfactory identification and spatial memory.
Lateralization of olfaction and spatial memory. We found
effects in the right hippocampus and left mOFC. The right
lateralization of the hippocampus for spatial memory and olfac-
tory identification is consistent with the literature12,14–16,24,29–34.
This right hippocampal lateralization is unlikely to be due to an
unspecific effect of the right hemisphere as there were no effects
found with the right caudate nucleus. In terms of the mOFC, an
effect is also usually found in the right hemisphere with regards
to olfaction. While we found an association between spatial
learning and both the right and left mOFC, only the left mOFC
showed an association with olfactory identification in spatial
learners. There have been reports of left orbitofrontal cortex
involvement in olfaction12,32,35 as well as reports showing no
association between left or right orbitofrontal cortex and olfactory
identification14,35–37. Therefore, the lateralization of the orbito-
frontal cortex in olfactory function and more specifically in
olfactory identification may not be as clear-cut as previously
suggested in the literature. The discrepancies between studies are
likely due to the methods used, including the olfactory identifi-
cation tasks, brain imaging methods, and participant cohorts.
Episodic and semantic memory do not mediate this associa-
tion. Olfactory identification has been proposed to involve both
episodic and semantic memory processes12,38. To verify whether
an
underlying
episodic
or,
less
likely,
semantic
memory
mechanism is not responsible for the association between spatial
memory and olfactory identification, we correlated olfactory
identification with performance on the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Task (RAVLT)39, an episodic memory task, and the
Verbal Fluency test of the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function
System40, a semantic memory task. There was no significant
association between olfactory identification and performance on
the RAVLT (total recall: r = 0.12, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.14,
0.37]; delayed recall: r = 0.003, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.29,
0.30]). There was also no significant association with the Verbal
Fluency test (all Bootstrap BCa 95% CI crossed 0), consistent with
a study that showed that older adults exhibited impairments in
olfactory identification but not semantic memory41. Thus, these
results suggest that olfactory identification and spatial memory
are not spuriously correlated because of a shared underlying
episodic or semantic memory component.
In order to assess whether other neuropsychological factors
could explain our results, we compared spatial and response
learners’ performance in various cognitive domains. Specifically,
there was no between-group difference in performance on a
battery of standard neuropsychological tests which included the
RAVLT39, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure42, and the Test of
Non-verbal Intelligence-343 (all Bootstrap BCa 95% CI crossed 0).
Olfaction and spatial memory critically rely on the mOFC.
Overall, our neuroimaging results are consistent with work in
patients with medial temporal lobe damage, who exhibit deficits
in both olfaction17,18,22,23 and spatial memory16,19–21, demon-
strating a critical role of the medial temporal lobe, and likely the
hippocampus, in both processes. Our findings are also consistent
with work in patients with mOFC damage, who present with
olfactory deficits18,24,25. However, whether mOFC damage also
yields spatial memory deficits has not yet been reported. In a
second study, we directly tested whether mOFC is critical for both
spatial memory and olfactory identification. In rodents, orbito-
frontal cortex neurons appear to be tuned to certain navigational
characteristics. For example, some neurons in this or surrounding
regions are path-selective44, encode odor-place associations45,
and fire when the rat is in a specific location and expects a
reward46. In primates, there is little evidence that the orbito-
frontal cortex processes spatial information47–49. However, the
tasks used in primate studies do not involve cognitive mapping or
navigation, which may explain the discrepancy with rodent and
human studies, whose tasks are much more similar in that
respect. In healthy young adult humans, we showed that mOFC
fMRI BOLD activity and gray matter is associated with spatial
learning in a dual-solution navigation task7. In a lesion study,
therefore, we investigated whether patients with frontal lobe
damage that affects the mOFC (mOFC + group) exhibit both
olfactory and spatial memory deficits, compared to patients with
frontal lobe damage sparing the mOFC (mOFC- group) and
demographically-matched control participants with no brain
damage (Fig. 5a).
We first investigated wayfinding performance across groups,
and found no difference between the groups (all Bootstrap BCa
95% CI crossed 0). This suggested that, if spatial memory
impairments are present in the mOFC + group, that they may be
subtle in nature and may not be adequately captured using a
wayfinding task. The 4/8 VM allows us to investigate various
facets of navigation, including strategy use, navigational learning,
and landmark use. In the 4/8 VM, the mOFC + group noticed
significantly fewer landmarks in the environment compared to
the mOFC- group (mean difference = −1.17, Bootstrap BCa 95%
CI [−2.20, −0.27]) (Fig. 5b). However, there was no significant
difference between any of the groups in the reported number of
landmarks used to learn the object locations (all Bootstrap BCa
95% CI crossed 0). In the probe phase, the mOFC + group made
significantly fewer probe errors compared to the control group
(mean difference = −0.24, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−0.55,
−0.02]) (Fig. 5c), indicating that they relied less on landmarks,
even though subjectively they reported no difference in terms of
the number of landmarks they used. The groups significantly
differed in their ability to reach the learning criterion (p < 0.05,
Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly, pairwise comparisons showed
that the mOFC + group learned normally compared to the
control group (Bootstrap BCa 95% CI crossed 0). Therefore, the
fact that the mOFC + group noticed fewer landmarks, described
above, is not related to a learning impairment. The mOFC- group

 had more difficulty completing the 4/8 VM task than the control
group (p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test), as three mOFC- patients
could not reach the learning criterion, compared to one patient in
the mOFC + group and zero control participants.

scorers on the olfactory identification task based on their scores
according to the median across the three groups (median = 27.5):
those who scored below the median were categorized as low
scorers and those who scored above the median were categorized
as high scorers. When comparing the percentage of low and high

olfaction, as it is is associated with a lesser reliance on landmarks and worse olfactory identification. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.

Control analyses. The three groups did not differ in age, edu-
cation, lesion volumes (all Bootstrap BCa 95% CI crossed 0), or
sex (p > 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2). We also compared the
three groups on the same battery of standard neuropsychological
tests as in the neuroimaging study, namely the Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Task39, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure42,
and the Test of Non-verbal Intelligence-343. The mOFC- group
had a significantly lower non-verbal intelligence quotient than the
mOFC + group (mean difference = −9.74, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI
[−19.75, −0.36]) and the control group (mean difference =
−13.37, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−24.25, −3.25]) (Table 2). The
mOFC- group also presented verbal memory deficits, as evi-
denced by significantly lower performance on the total recall of
the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test compared to the control
group
(mean

[−20.52, −4.71]) (Table 2). The navigational learning impair-
ments exhibited by the mOFC- group may therefore be due to
global cognitive deficits.
In summary, in this lesion study, we showed for the first time
that mOFC damage affects performance on both olfactory
identification and spatial memory tasks. These deficits were not
explained by general cognitive impairment, as patients with
mOFC damage performed similarly to control participants on
standard neuropsychological tests. This argues for a specific
contribution of this frontal region to both olfactory identification
and spatial memory.
Discussion
In the current set of studies, we report for the first time that
olfactory identification and spatial memory are related in
humans. There was a positive relationship between olfactory
identification and spatial memory but not stimulus-response
navigation, across both studies. The association between olfactory
identification and spatial memory may be explained, at least in
part, by common neural substrates for these two processes, i.e. the
hippocampus and mOFC.
In the literature, approximately half of the studies report that
the hippocampus is associated with olfactory identification per-
formance, while the other half reports no such involvement of the
hippocampus (e.g., refs. 12,15,37,41,50). The fact that the hippo-
campus is not consistently associated with olfactory identification
may reflect inter-individual variability in hippocampal involve-
ment. Our finding that the correlation between olfactory identi-
fication and hippocampal volume is present among spatial
learners but not response learners suggests that identifying peo-
ple’s spontaneous navigation strategies is useful in capturing this
inter-individual variability.
Besides the hippocampus, we investigated the role of the
mOFC. Similar to the hippocampal volume results, we found that
mOFC cortical thickness is associated with both olfactory iden-
tification and navigational learning within spatial learners but not
response learners. We also demonstrate a critical role of the
mOFC in both processes, as patients with mOFC damage exhibit
impaired olfactory identification as well as reduced spatial
memory, as they encoded less spatial information and relied less
on landmarks. Thus, our findings are consistent with previous
lesion studies that have shown the orbitofrontal cortex to be
critical for olfaction24, and additionally provide new evidence for
the mOFC’s critical role in spatial memory. Interestingly, patients
with mOFC damage made fewer errors on the probe trial than the
control group, which indicates that stimulus-response learning
may have been facilitated. Supporting this, patients from this
group who used a spatial strategy reported having incidentally
learned the sequence of target paths. In concordance with this, we
found in the young adult cohort that greater mOFC cortical
thickness is associated with worse stimulus-response learning.
Thus, when intact, the mOFC appears to interfere with stimulus-
response learning, while when it is damaged, stimulus-response
learning seems to be facilitated. This is consistent with the rodent
literature, whereby lesioning the hippocampus or the fimbria-
fornix, which are part of the spatial memory neural circuit,
facilitates stimulus-response learning10,51. Our results show that
the mOFC has a critical role not only in olfactory identification,
but in spatial memory as well.
It would be of interest for future lines of study to investigate
other olfactory processes such as olfactory recognition, dis-
crimination, and threshold, and their relationship with spatial
memory. The olfactory hypothesis does not discriminate among
these distinct functions, and so we may hypothesize that these too
would be associated with spatial memory. Similarly, it would also
be of interest to investigate identification performance in other
modalities, and whether there would be a relationship with spatial
memory and its neural correlates. However, based on the fact that
H.M., who had bilateral medial temporal lobe damage, did not
exhibit visual or tactile identification impairments17, we hypo-
thesize that the relationship seen between spatial memory and
olfactory identification is in fact specific to the olfactory domain.
Taken together, our findings point to a close relationship
between spatial memory and olfactory identification. We showed
that these two processes covary in healthy young adults, that they
correlate with right hippocampal volume, and that they are
impaired in patients with damage affecting the mOFC. Thus, the
behavioral relationship between olfactory identification and spa-
tial memory is reflected in their shared neural substrates, which
may have come about due to the parallel evolution of the olfac-
tory and hippocampal systems3. While further research remains
to be done, these findings bring evidence that is consistent with
the suggestion that the original function of the olfactory sense
may have been to support cognitive mapping and spatial
memory.

 history of head trauma with loss of consciousness, were excluded. In the behavioral
analyses in which we assessed the relationship between olfactory identification and
navigation, 57 participants were included as three participants did not complete the
virtual navigation tasks due to lack of time. Two participants did not undergo MRI
scanning, also due to lack of time. Therefore, 55 participants (23 spatial learners, 32
response learners) were included in the volumetry analyses. One participant’s
cortical thickness processing failed, and thus 54 participants (23 spatial learners, 31
response learners) were included in the cortical thickness analyses. In previous
studies, effects were found with as few as 15 participants per group, so we expected
to find an effect with groups of at least 20 participants. Informed consent was
obtained from the participants in conformity with the ethics committee of the
Douglas Mental Health University Institute. Participants received monetary com-
pensation for their participation.
We recruited 18 patients with focal lesions to the frontal lobes from the
Cognitive Neuroscience Research Registry at McGill University. Patients’
demographic information and performance on neuropsychological tests are shown
in Table 2. Patients were tested a minimum of six months after their lesions
occurred (median = 6.6 years; range: 1–48 years). No other criteria were used for
inclusion in the study. However, if patients suffered damage to primary olfactory
regions, such as the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb, they were excluded from the
olfactory analyses, as this damage is a confounding factor when investigating the
role of the mOFC in olfactory identification. They were categorized a posteriori into
mOFC-involved (mOFC + ) or mOFC-spared (mOFC-) groups by L.D., who was
blind to task performance at the moment of categorization, based on their most
recent clinical CT or MRI imaging. The anatomical landmarks for the mOFC
included the ventromedial margin of the cerebral hemisphere on the medial edge,
the medial orbital sulcus on the lateral edge, and a line was drawn from the
posterior branch of the medial orbital sulcus to the medial portion of the
subcallosal gyrus to delineate the caudal edge of the mOFC52. The mOFC + group
included six women and three men; mean age = 56.56 ± 16.18; mean education:
14.509 ± 3.72. The mOFC- group also included six women and three men; mean
age = 60.00 ± 6.71; mean education: 14.89 ± 2.93). We previously found differences
between lesion groups of as few as five participants, so we expected significant
results with groups of at least five participants. Lesion etiology in the mOFC +
group included six cases of tumor resection, two cases of aneurysm rupture, and
one case of stroke. In the mOFC- group, there were six cases of tumor resection
and three cases of stroke. Three mOFC + patients and one mOFC- patient had a
history of psychiatric disorders (anxiety and depression). Among them, at the time
of testing, one mOFC + patient was depressed and another mOFC + patient had
an anxiety disorder. At the time of testing, one mOFC + patient and one mOFC-
patient were taking psychoactive medication—anti-depressants in both cases.
Twenty control participants matched to the patients on age and education were
recruited using local advertisement (15 women, 5 men; mean age = 57.30 ± 11.02;
mean education: 16.48 ± 3.39). Six participants had a history of psychiatric
disorders (anxiety and depression). Among them, one participant was depressed
and one participant had an anxiety disorder at the time of testing. In terms of
psychoactive medication, one participant was taking anti-depressants, one
participant was taking anxiolytics, and one participant was taking both anti-
depressants and anxiolytics at the time of testing. The incidence of psychoactive
drug use was similar across the three groups (p > 0.05, Fisher’s exact test).
Two patients were excluded from the olfactory identification analyses due to
structural damage to sensory regions of the olfactory system. Medical information
in the patient database indicated that one mOFC + patient had a severed olfactory
nerve and another mOFC + patient had damage to the olfactory bulb. Four
additional patients provided incomplete data: one mOFC + patient and three
mOFC- patients could not reach the learning criterion in the 4/8 VM. They
understood the task instructions but were unable to learn the location of the
objects. For this reason, their learning stage data were included but probe trial data
was not available for these patients. One mOFC + patient, one mOFC- patient, and
one control participant did not perform the wayfinding task due to lack of time.
All participants in the lesion study gave written informed consent in accordance
with the McGill University Research Ethics Board and received monetary
compensation for their participation.
Lesion analysis. The lesions identified from each patient’s most recent clinical CT
or MRI scan were traced onto the ICBM52 MNI template by a neurologist (L.K.F.)
experienced in imaging analysis and blind to patients’ task performance, using
MRIcro (www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/). The same software was used to
create lesion overlap images for each group (Fig. 5a).
Olfactory identification. We used the Monell Extended Sniffin’ Sticks Identifi-
cation Test (MONEX-40) to assess olfactory identification53. The MONEX-40
consists of 40 felt-tip pens, each infused with an odor. Experimenters washed their
hands with unscented soap prior to testing. Each pen is placed for one to two
seconds under the participant’ nose as the participant inhales the odor. For each
pen, participants are shown four words on a screen and identify the one associated
with the presented odor. The pens were originally developed to yield at least 35%
accuracy across participants (Lundström, personal communication). In the neu-
roimaging study, two pens yielded an overall accuracy of less than 35% (warm milk
and honey) and were therefore excluded from the analysis. Potential reasons for
low accuracy include degradation of the odor over time or unfamiliarity due to
cultural differences.
Most of the participants in the lesion study were francophone. For this reason,
the MONEX-40 was translated into French. The English and French versions
yielded similar scores (mean difference = 1.18, Bootstrap BCa 95% CI [−5.41,
6.57]). In the lesion study, three pens were discarded based on low accuracy (warm
milk, apple, and peanut). Scores were therefore based on 37 items.
Wayfinding in a virtual town. This task involves moving through a virtual town
with a dimension of about 151 m × 153 m (23,10 m2) in an exploration phase and a
probe phase. The town has many streets and buildings, and there are eight target
landmarks that are identified with signs (e.g., movie theater, school, stores; Fig. 1a).
This task was developed with the Unreal Tournament 2003 development kit (Epic
Games, Raleigh, NC).
Exploration phase: Participants were given a minimum of 20 min to visit the
town and to learn the location of the eight target landmarks. This exploration phase
allowed participants to learn the relationships between the various landmarks, i.e.
to construct a cognitive map4. Participants were required to reach two criteria; they
had to pass by each of the eight landmarks at least twice and to walk every street at
least once before moving on to the probe phase. If they did not do so
spontaneously, an experimenter prompted them to move to unexplored areas by
giving step-by-step directions when participants happened to be close to the area
that was not visited. These directions were minimal and far apart to encourage
learning from self-directed exploration. The exploration phase ended when
participants reached the two criteria, which prevented participants from using a
stimulus-response strategy, as they were not allowed to visit the town extensively
and therefore could not learn habitual routes between each of the landmarks.
Probe phase: There were eight probe trials, in which participants started in front
of a landmark and were asked to take the most direct route to another landmark.
They were told that speed is not important. However, unbeknownst to them, there
was a five-minute limit to each trial, which was only reached in 3.51% of the trials.
Each landmark served as a start and/or target destination only once so that the
direct routes between them were relatively unfamiliar.
The dependent variables were the average path tortuosity (indirectness of a
path), the percentage of target landmarks found, and the average path error for
successful trials. Average path tortuosity was calculated by dividing the total path
length in a given trial by the shortest possible path length for that trial. We
considered that targets may have been found by chance due to the generous time
limit of five minutes per trial. Therefore, we also calculated two measures that
minimized the impact of chance. We used a path cut-off that equaled three times
the ideal distance for any given trial. This cut-off serves to minimize the impact of
trials in which target locations were found by chance on the percentage of target
landmarks found and average path error. For example, if a participant reached the
target landmark but traveled more than three times the ideal distance, then the
path error for this trial was not taken into account in the calculation of the average
path error because it was assumed that the target was found by chance. It was

4-on-8 Virtual Maze (4/8 VM). The 4/8 VM5,6 was adapted from a maze task
used in rodents10. It was comprised of a radial maze (a central platform with eight
paths branching from it, each ending with a pit at the bottom of a staircase),
surrounded by a rich landscape with proximal and distal landmarks (Fig. 2a). This
task was developed with the Unreal Tournament 2003 development kit (Epic
Games, Raleigh, NC).
The task involved a learning phase and a probe phase. Each of those phases was
divided into two parts: in the first part, only 4 of the 8 paths were open.
Participants were instructed to visit the accessible paths, to retrieve the objects at
the bottom of the pits. Once they retrieved all four objects, participants were given
time to look around and memorize the location of the paths that led to the objects.
When they were ready, they moved to Part 2. Here, all the barriers were removed,
making all the paths accessible. Participants were instructed to visit the remaining
arms in order to retrieve the objects. In other words, they must avoid the paths that
they visited in Part 1.
Before moving on to the probe phase, participants had to reach the learning
criterion by finding the objects in Part 2 without making errors in at least one of
the learning trials. We administered a minimum of three and a maximum of eight
trials. In Part 1 of the probe phase, four of the eight paths were open, just as in the
learning phase. However, in Part 2, a wall was erected around the radial maze,
blocking the landmarks from participants’ view. The probe score measured
participants’ reliance on landmarks when retrieving the objects.
At the end of the task, we conducted a verbal report, where we asked
participants to describe how they solved the task from beginning to end. We used a
specific structured questioning procedure and asked participants to describe their
method of navigation for the whole task. Based on their response concerning the
first trial, we categorized each participant as either a spatial or a response learner.
Participants were categorized as spatial learners if they reported using two or more
landmarks to remember the location of the pathways containing the objects, and
did not report using a sequence (e.g., “There was a pathway on the left of the
blossom tree, one next to the mountain peak, on the right […]”). They were
categorized as response learners if they reported using a sequence or pattern from a
single starting position to learn the location of the target pathways (e.g., “I started
from the pathway directly in front of me, and remembered ‘open, open, closed,
closed, open, closed, open, closed”). This verbal report procedure has previously
been shown to be a robust measure of participants’ spontaneous navigation
strategies and was shown to be sensitive to hippocampal function and structure5–7.
We also used the verbal report to determine how many landmarks participants
noticed and how many landmarks they used on average throughout the learning
trials.
Based on our previous work5,6, the primary dependent measures were probe
errors, number of trials to criterion, and average navigational learning errors,
defined as the average number of errors on Part 2 of the learning trials. Other
dependent variables included the number of landmarks noticed and average
number of landmarks used during the learning phase of the task.
A few modifications were made to the 4/8 VM for patients with frontal lobe
damage. The original task involves reversal learning, as participants have to
memorize a different set of paths in the second trial and have to visit the opposite
set of paths in Part 2 compared to Part 1 (participants have to locate the unvisited
paths). Patients with mOFC damage are known to have reversal learning
deficits54,55. To ensure that any deficit would be due to spatial memory
impairments and not reversal learning deficits, we made the following changes: (1)
all the trials have the same reward contingency, and (2) participants must visit the
same arms in Part 2 as in Part 1. Because some patients with brain damage have
working memory deficits, we administered a short verbal report after each trial to
ensure that participants accurately reported the navigation strategies that they used.
The dependent variables were the same as for the original 4/8 VM.
Neuropsychological tests. To ensure that spatial and response learners did not
differ in various cognitive domains which may confound the results, we admi-
nistered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task39 to assess verbal episo-
dic memory, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure42 to assess visuo-spatial
episodic memory, the Test of Non-verbal Intelligence-343 to evaluate non-verbal
intelligence, and the Verbal Flency test40 to assess semantic memory. The same
tests were administered in the lesion study to assess cognitive differences between
the three groups, with the exception of the Verbal Fluency test.
MRI data acquisition. Participants underwent brain MRI on a 3 Tesla Siemens
Trio scanner at the Douglas Cerebral Imaging Centre. Their heads were immo-
bilized with support cushions. The session started with a localizer scan, followed by
a 9-min MPRAGE anatomical scan. We used a three-dimensional gradient echo
acquisition to collect 192 contiguous 1 mm T1-weighted images in the sagittal
plane (TR = 2300 ms; TE = 2.98 ms; flip angle = 9; field of view = 256 mm²).
Behavioral analysis. In the neuroimaging study, we conducted partial correlations
between navigation variables (wayfinding and 4/8 VM) and olfactory identification
scores, with sex included as a covariate. Sex affects both wayfinding ability (men
tend to outperform women56) and olfactory identification (women tend to out-
perform men53,57). In all analyses, we used bootstrapped bias-corrected and
accelerated 95% confidence intervals (Bootstrap BCa 95% CI) to account for
deviations from parametric assumptions and to determine significance. Boot-
strapping uses a sample dataset and simulates 1000 datasets by resampling from the
sample dataset with replacement. Resampling methods are advantageous in that
they inherently correct for multiple comparisons58,59. Additionally, confidence
intervals are more informative as they are an estimation of the population’s true
value, rendering them more accurate and more robust than p values60, properties
that are boosted when using bootstrapping methods58. Another advantage of
resampling methods is that they estimate Type I and Type II error rates more
precisely than classical p value adjustment methods59 as the experimental data is
compared with a chance distribution. Multiple comparison corrections are there-
fore unnecessary. Lastly, bootstrapping is a non-parametric method and thus does
not require transforming the data in cases where the data is not normally dis-
tributed59. One-tailed confidence intervals were calculated when analyses were
hypothesis-driven. The analysis was implemented in SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM).
Correlation graphs (Figs 1–4) were produced with SPSS.
In the lesion study, task performance was compared for the three groups
(mOFC + , mOFC-, and control participants) with an analysis of covariance. Age
was included as a covariate as the groups had large standard deviations, and
because aging has an impact on both spatial memory and olfactory
identification61,62. TONI-3 IQ varied across the three groups, and so was also
included as a covariate. Navigation strategies were used as a covariate in the
analyses pertaining to the number of landmarks noticed and used as the
proportions of spatial to response learners were unequal between groups (see
Table 2), and as spatial memory strategies are associated with a greater number of
landmarks noticed and used. For the analyses pertaining to the neuropsychological
tests, only age was used as a covariate. We used bootstrapped bias-corrected and
accelerated 95% confidence intervals (Bootstrap BCa 95% CI) to account for
deviations from parametric assumptions and to determine significance. One-tailed
confidence intervals were calculated when analyses were hypothesis-driven. We
also compared the proportion of participants who reached the learning criterion on
the 4/8 VM and the proportion of low and high scorers on the olfactory
identification task using Fisher’s exact test. For hypothesis-driven analyses, one-
sided tests were conducted and were deemed significant if they returned a p value
below 0.05. The lesion overlap figure (Fig. 5a) was produced with MRIcro and the
bar graphs (Fig. 5b-e) were produced with Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Cortical thickness analysis. Structural images in the neuroimaging study were
processed using CIVET (Version 1.12) (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/
ServicesSoftware/CIVET)63. Images were linearly transformed and registered to the
ICBM152 nonlinear template. Following this, image inhomogeneities were cor-
rected using N3 non-uniformity artifact correction64, at which point the images
were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using
INSECT65. Gray and white matter surfaces were subsequently produced for each
hemisphere. The distances between the white and gray matter surfaces were
measured in native space using the t-link method66. Each participant’s cortical
thickness data was then smoothed using a 30-mm full-width at half-maximum
(FWHM) surface-based diffusion blurring kernel. The resulting gray and white
matter surfaces were quality controlled. CIVET was unsuccessfully run in one
participant (a response learner). Following this, the cortical thickness maps were
parcellated using the DKT atlas67. SurfStat (http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/
surfstat/) was used to extract the mean cortical thickness values for the DKT
regions in MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.). Finally, in SPSS, we conducted correlations
between mOFC cortical thickness and behavioral measures, with sex as a covariate
as men generally have larger brains than women and as sex impacts both navi-
gation and olfaction.
Volumetric analysis. We used the Multiple Automatically Generated Templates
(MAGeT) Brain tool to measure right and left hippocampal volumes68 as well as
right and left caudate nucleus volumes69 in the neuroimaging study. This multi-atlas
segmentation tool segments the hippocampal subfields and caudate nucleus in a fully
automated fashion, and was designed to use as input a small set of high-quality
manually-segmented atlases. We preprocessed the structural scans using N4 inten-
sity correction70 and applied a head mask before running MAGeT-Brain to aid
registration. Hippocampal subfield and subcortical atlases68,69 were used to manu-
ally segment the hippocampus and caudate nucleus in a set of atlas brains. In
MAGeT-Brain, a library of 21 templates, an optimal number for segmentation
accuracy68, is used to bootstrap each participant’s segmentation. We chose the 21
templates by first segmenting all the samples using the five manually segmented
brains and selecting the ones with the best segmentations as a means of identifying
participant scans which best register to the manually segmented atlases. Non-linear
atlas-to-template registration is used to segment and label each template, resulting in
a unique delineation of the subfields for each individual template. The bootstrapping
technique yields 105 candidate labels for each participant (5 atlases × 21 templates),
which are then fused through voxel-wise majority vote to produce one final seg-
mentation. The Automatic Normalization Tools (ANTS) registration technique
was used for the non-linear registration (https://github.com/vfonov/mincANTS).

 We determined the total hippocampal volume for each hemisphere by calculating
the sum of the five subfield volumes: CA1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, subiculum,
and stratum radiatum, lacunosum, and moleculare. We visually inspected each
output segmentation for quality control, which all segmentations passed. MAGeT-
Brain volume correlations were covaried with sex, as men generally have larger
brains than women and as sex impacts both navigation and olfaction, using SPSS.
Intracranial volume was not used as a covariate as it did not correlate with any of our
behavioral dependent variables (all Bootstrap BCa 95% CI crossed 0).
