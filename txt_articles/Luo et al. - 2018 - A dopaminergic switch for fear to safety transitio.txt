Overcoming aversive emotional memories requires neural systems that detect when fear
responses are no longer appropriate so that they can be extinguished. The midbrain ventral
tegmental area (VTA) dopamine system has been implicated in reward and more broadly in
signaling when a better-than-expected outcome has occurred. This suggests that it may be
important in guiding fear to safety transitions. We report that when an expected aversive
outcome does not occur, activity in midbrain dopamine neurons is necessary to extinguish
behavioral fear responses and engage molecular signaling events in extinction learning cir-
cuits. Furthermore, a specific dopamine projection to the nucleus accumbens medial shell is
partially responsible for this effect. In contrast, a separate dopamine projection to the medial
prefrontal cortex opposes extinction learning. This demonstrates a novel function for the
canonical VTA-dopamine reward system and reveals opposing behavioral roles for different
dopamine neuron projections in fear extinction learning.

xposure therapy, a form of extinction learning, is an
important psychological treatment for anxiety disorders
such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction of
classically conditioned fear responses is a model of exposure
therapy. In the laboratory, animals learn that a sensory stimulus
predicts the occurrence of an aversive outcome through fear
conditioning. During extinction, the omission of an expected
aversive event signals a transition from fear responding to safety.
To switch from fear responding to extinction learning, a brain
system that recognizes when an expected aversive event does not
occur is required. While molecular changes occurring in the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala are
known to be important for storing and consolidating extinction
memories1,2, the brain mechanisms for detecting when an
expected aversive event did not occur and fear responses are no
longer appropriate are less well understood3.
One candidate circuit for this function is the midbrain ventral
tegmental
area
(VTA)-dopamine
system.
VTA-dopamine
neurons signal reward through phasic responses to better-than-
expected outcomes. They are more strongly activated by unex-
pected, compared with expected, rewards and inhibited when an
expected reward does not occur, thereby encoding reward pre-
diction errors4–6. The omission of an expected aversive outcome,
as occurs during extinction is also known to activate dopamine
neurons and increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc)7–11, particularly in the NAc medial shell (mShell)10.
Dopamine neurons are also activated by the cessation of ongoing
aversive stimuli and activity in VTA-dopamine neurons and their
projections to the NAc are important in relief learning, a process
which may be similar to extinction11–13. Dopamine neurons are
heterogeneous in their response to rewarding and aversive
outcomes7,8,14, with some cells responding specifically to reward
and others more generally to salient stimuli. A recent study in
Drosophila also reported that a distinct population of dopamine
neurons are involved specifically in extinction of reward learning
based on their connectivity with a specific area of the mushroom
body15. In mammalian systems, separable populations of dopa-
mine neurons project to the NAc, amygdala and mPFC16 and
distinct calcium changes have been reported in different VTA-
dopamine terminal fields17,18. Importantly, dopamine receptor
activation in the vmPFC, amygdala and NAc modulates extinc-
tion learning and memory19–23. This suggests that based on their
projection targets, distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons
may differentially regulate fear extinction. What is unknown is
whether activation of VTA-dopamine neurons during the omis-
sion of an expected aversive outcome is necessary for fear
extinction learning and, if so, whether this effect is mediated by
specific populations and projections of dopamine neurons.
Using a circuit specific optogenetic-behavioral approach, we
show that optogenetic inhibition of VTA-dopamine neurons
during expected shock omission is necessary for extinction
learning. Furthermore, we report that specific populations of
VTA-dopamine neurons project to the NAc mShell or core and
inhibition of the mShell projecting cells reduces the long-term
retention of extinction. In contrast, a separate projection of the
VTA-dopamine system to the vmPFC opposes extinction learn-
ing. Together, these results demonstrate that the VTA-dopamine
system is necessary for detecting when aversive responses should
be reduced and reveal that distinct populations of dopamine
neurons make unique and specific contributions to this process.
Results
VTA-dopamine activity switches fear responding to extinction
learning. We first examined whether activity in VTA-dopamine
neurons during the shock omission period of fear extinction was
necessary for extinction learning. To do this we expressed
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) alone or the inhibi-
tory Halorhodopsin fused to eYFP (eNpHR3.0-eYFP) specifically
in VTA-dopamine cells of tyrosine hydroxylase-cre recombinase
(TH-Cre) rats24 by injecting a Cre-dependent adeno-associated
virus (AAV) into the VTA (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Optical silencing of VTA-dopamine neurons and dopamine
release using NpHR has been demonstrated previously, providing
validation of our approach25,26. Animals then underwent fear
conditioning during which a neutral auditory conditioned sti-
mulus (CS) was paired with an aversive footshock unconditioned
stimulus (US). This was followed 24 h later by presentation of the
auditory CS without the aversive US during an “extinction”
learning session (Fig. 1a) in which animals first show behavioral
freezing responses that gradually diminish over the course of
extinction. 24 h later an extinction “retrieval” session occurred in
which animals were presented with the CS alone again to deter-
mine their retention of extinction memories. During extinction
trials, illumination of VTA occurred during either the shock
omission period (Fig. 1a, c and Supplementary Fig. 2a) or during
each auditory CS period (Fig. 1a, d and Supplementary Fig. 2b) of
extinction training in animals expressing eNpHR3.0 or eYFP.
While eYFP controls and animals in which optical inhibition
occurred during the auditory CS period reduced their freezing
responses
during
extinction,
extinction
learning
and
sub-
sequent retrieval were significantly reduced in animals with
optical inhibition occurring during the expected shock omission
period (Fig. 1c, d). There were no detectable differences between
eYFP and NpHr animals in freezing responses prior to the onset
of the first CS (% freezing in 20 s before 1st CS onset: NpHR =
2.7 ± 1.8% SEM, eYFP = 5.6 ± 2.0% SEM; p = 0.33, student’s
t-test). To determine whether extinction was completely blocked
we used a more specific analysis comparing freezing during the
first CS of extinction to the last CS of extinction and to the first
CS of extinction “retrieval”. This showed that compared with
freezing to the first CS of extinction training, there was a sig-
nificant reduction in freezing by the final CS of the extinction
training session and this reduction persisted to the first CS of
extinction retrieval (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Together this shows
that although laser application produced a large attenuation of
extinction learning during training, some extinction did occur in
eNpHR3.0 treated animals. Notably, pairing an auditory CS with
optical inhibition of dopamine neurons alone, in the absence of
shock, was not sufficient to produce fear conditioning (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3b, c). Combined with the data showing normal
extinction when inhibition occurred during the entire CS period
(rather than during the shock omission period) of extinction, this
suggests that inhibition of dopamine neurons did not reduce
extinction by acting as an aversive stimulus in place of the shock.
Together, these data demonstrate that dopamine activity during
the expected shock omission period, but not during the auditory
CS period is necessary for normal extinction learning to occur.
Phosphorylation of MAP kinase (pMAPK) occurs in the
amygdala and vmPFC and is necessary in these regions for
normal extinction learning27–29. We next investigated whether
inactivation
of
VTA-dopamine
neurons
during
the
shock
omission period reduced extinction learning induced increases
in pMAPK.27–29. We expressed eNpHR3.0 or eYFP in VTA-
dopamine cells, optogenetically inhibited these cells during the
shock omission period of fear extinction and used immunohis-
tochemistry to quantify MAPK phosphorylation (pMAPK). We
compared this to chamber exposed control animals who were fear
conditioned but did not undergo extinction training (Fig. 1e). In
the eYFP treated groups, extinction training increased pMAPK
levels in lateral amygdala (LA) and infralimbic (IL) subregion of
mPFC compared to chamber exposed controls (Fig. 1f–h). In

 contrast, optogenetic inhibition of VTA-dopamine cells in the
eNpHR3.0 treated group during shock omission prevented the
increase in pMAPK associated with extinction learning in
the amygdala and IL. This shows that activation of dopamine
neurons during shock omissions in extinction training promotes
molecular changes in LA and IL that support extinction learning.
Inhibiting shock activity in dopamine neurons enhances fear.
Electrophysiological studies of the dopamine system have sug-
gested that one function of dopamine could be to signal the
occurrence
of
any
salient
event7,30.
While
activation
of
VTA-dopamine neurons is necessary during rewards for learning
to occur and VTA-dopamine signaling has been implicated in
aversive learning31–33, the role of shock-evoked activity in
dopamine neurons in fear learning is not clear. We tested this
question using the same approach described above to inhibit the
activity of VTA-dopamine neurons during the shock US period of
fear conditioning (Fig. 2a). We found that optogenetic inhibition
of VTA-dopamine neurons during the shock (“NpHR” group)
enhanced fear learning compared with eYFP expressing animals
or NpHR expressing animals that received laser inhibition after
the shock had already occurred (Offset group, Fig. 2b). Further-
more, inhibition during the auditory CS period of conditioning
had no effect on learning (Fig. 2c). Combined with the findings
above that inhibition of dopamine neurons alone paired with
shock does not produce fear learning (Supplementary Fig. 3c),
this suggests that neural activity in dopamine neurons during the
shock period serves to restrain fear learning. However, although
global inhibition of VTA-dopamine neurons enhanced fear
learning, specific dopamine projections may individually facilitate
fear learning34.
Different dopamine projections enhance or reduce extinction.
VTA-dopamine neurons are heterogeneous based on their dif-
ferential projections to distinct efferent targets14,16–18. To test
whether different VTA-dopamine neuronal projections serve
distinct functions for fear extinction learning, we expressed the
inhibitory opsin ArchT-GFP in VTA-dopamine cells and exam-
ined the effect of inactivating the terminals of these cells in var-
ious dopaminergic target regions. We used ArchT here because
NpHR3.0 did not express well in rat dopamine nerve terminals/
axons and because previous studies have demonstrated the effi-
cacy of inhibiting terminal release with archaerhodopsin using
short time duration laser illumination ( < 60 s)35,36. To verify that
optogenetic manipulation of dopamine nerve terminals inhibited
dopamine release, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)
to measure dopamine release in NAc (Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Fig. 4a–c). We chose the NAc to confirm optogenetic control of
dopamine release because it is a well-established site for dopa-
mine measurement37–39. Also, among the neuromodulators
detectable by FSCV, MFB stimulation elicits predominantly
dopamine release within the NAc40. We found that evoked
dopamine release in the NAc was attenuated by light inhibition in
ArchT animals, but not in GFP control animals or in ArchT
animals without laser illumination (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary
Fig. 4d, e). The observed inhibition was limited, likely because
dopamine
fibers
were
stimulated
electrically
which
would
strongly activate most dopamine fibers, many of which may not
be expressing ArchT. We then investigated the effect of opto-
genetically inhibiting dopamine terminals in different projection
targets during the shock omission period of extinction training.
Consistent with evidence of increased dopamine release in the
NAc during omission of expected aversive outcomes9,10, we
found that inhibition of dopamine terminals in NAc during
extinction training impaired retention of extinction memories
(Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5a). In contrast, inhibition of
dopamine nerve terminals in the vmPFC enhanced extinction
memory consolidation/retention (Fig. 3f, g and Supplementary
Fig. 5b) while inhibition of terminals in the lateral/basal amygdala
had no effect (Fig. 3h, i and Supplementary Fig. 5c). To determine
the extent to which extinction was affected by NAc terminal
inactivation we again compared the first CS of extinction with the
last CS of extinction as well as with the first CS of extinction
retrieval in the ArchT treated group. We found a significant
reduction in freezing comparing 1st to last CS of extinction
training, but freezing completely recovered 24 h later during the
retrieval test (Supplementary Fig. 5d). We also found no differ-
ences in baseline freezing levels between ArchT and GFP
expressing animals prior to the onset of the first CS of extinction
retrieval test (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Together this shows that
specific projections of dopamine neurons serve opposing roles in
fear extinction learning, with NAc projections facilitating and
vmPFC projections opposing long-term retention of extinction
memories.
NAc-mShell projecting dopamine cells regulates extinction.
Previous work has shown that release of dopamine in the NAc
core and mShell can be decoupled during different behaviors and
in response to distinct stimuli10,41. Notably, increases in dopa-
mine release when an expected shock is omitted occurs in the
mShell10, but dopamine release is reduced in core in response to
aversive predictive cues9,10. This suggests either that distinct

 populations of dopamine neurons project to core and mShell or
that terminal release of dopamine is uniquely modulated in each
of these regions. Retrograde tracing studies have suggested that
dopamine inputs to these NAc subregions may arise from dif-
ferent parts of the VTA42, but no study has directly tested this
question using a multi-tracer approach. To do so we injected two
different colored retrograde tracers into the NAc core and mShell
and quantified the degree of overlap in VTA neurons labeled with
these differently colored tracers. We found completely non-
overlapping VTA dopaminergic cell populations projecting to
NAc core and mShell (0% overlap, n = 4 animals, Fig. 4a)
explained partially by a medial (dominated by mShell projecting
cells) to lateral (dominated by core projecting cells) segregated,
topographic organization as has been suggested by previous
work42, but also by distinct cell populations in VTA areas where
intermingled cells were apparent.
Next we examined whether inhibition of mShell or core
projecting VTA-dopamine neurons during the shock omission

 period of extinction affected behavioral extinction. Because some
retrogradely labeled neurons were not TH-positive/dopaminergic
we used a combinatorial retrograde infection approach that
targets opsin expression specifically to dopamine projection
neurons. Specifically, we injected a retrograde canine adenovirus
expressing a cre-recombinase-dependent-Flp-recombinase (CAV-
FLEX-flp, Fig. 4b) into the core or mShell of TH-cre rats followed
by injection of AAVs expressing Flp dependent ArchT3.0 (AAV-
fDIO-ArchT-eYFP) into the VTA. This produced expression of
ArchT3.0 specifically in dopamine cells projecting the NAc core
or mShell (Supplementary Fig. 6) allowing for selective inhibition
of these distinct cell populations during extinction. We found that
inhibition of mShell, but not core, projecting dopamine neurons
reduced the consolidation/long-term retention of extinction
memories (Fig. 4c). This demonstrates distinct VTA-dopamine
cell populations projecting to core and mShell and reveals a novel
function for the mShell projecting cells in modulating the
persistence of extinction memories.
Discussion
These findings show that activation of VTA-dopamine neurons
during the expected shock omission time period is necessary for
normal extinction learning and the upregulation of extinction-
related plasticity markers in the vmPFC and amygdala. Notably,
inhibition of VTA-dopamine neurons during the shock period of
fear conditioning facilitates learning, suggesting that activity in
VTA-dopamine neurons is not simply important for learning in
response to any salient event. These results also reveal that dis-
tinct populations of VTA-dopamine neurons project to NAc core
vs. mShell and that the mShell projecting cells are important for
the formation of stable, long-term extinction memories. In con-
trast, a different VTA-dopamine cell population which projects
to the vmPFC actively suppresses extinction as inhibition of their
inputs to vmPFC during the shock omission period enhanced the
retention of extinction memories. Together these findings suggest
that activity in the VTA-dopamine system detects the omission of
anticipated shocks and triggers a transition from fear to safety
and that this is at least partially mediated through dopamine
projections to the NAc.
One potential alternative interpretation of these results is that
inhibition of VTA-dopamine neurons alone produced an aversive
state that sustained fear responding during extinction43,44.
However, inhibiting VTA-dopamine neurons during most of the
auditory CS period had no effect on fear expression or extinction
(Fig. 1d). Furthermore, pairing an auditory CS with VTA-
dopamine neurons inhibition in place of shock was not sufficient
to produce fear learning (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). In addition,
inhibiting VTA-dopamine cells during the CS period of fear
learning did not enhance fear conditioning (Fig. 2c). Finally,
omission of expected aversive events increases dopamine neural
activity and NAc dopamine release7,10. Together, this provides
strong support for the conclusion that inhibition of this cell
population specifically during the shock omission period of fear
learning reduced extinction by blocking dopamine release evoked
by unexpected shock omission and not because the inhibition by
itself produced an aversive state.
These results reveal a novel function for the NAc projecting
dopaminergic reward pathway and demonstrates a behavioral
role for the enhanced dopamine release in the NAc mShell that
occurs when an expected aversive outcome does not occur9,10.
Specifically, our results show that activity in DA cells specifically
during expected shock omission facilitates a switch from fear
responding to extinction and that this is mediated partially
through projections to the NAc mShell. This projection could
work in concert with amygdala inputs to the NAc which also
participate in extinction learning45. Surprisingly, our findings also
show that activity during shock omission in mPFC projecting DA
neurons actively opposes extinction learning while dopamine
inputs to the amygdala during this time period do not appear to
be involved in this process. Although vmPFC itself is important
for extinction learning1,2, our findings suggest that dopamine
inputs to the vmPFC can play an opposing role. This is consistent
with previous reports showing that D1 receptor activation in
mPFC is important for reinstatement of fear memories following
extinction46 and that activation of mPFC projecting DA neurons
produces aversive learning34. Possibly inconsistent with our
results are reports that pharmacological blockade of dopamine
receptors in both amygdala and vmPFC reduce extinction
learning or consolidation of extinction20,21, respectively. This
discrepancy may be due to differences in the temporal specificity
of dopamine manipulations as pharmacological approaches affect
tonic dopamine signaling occurring during and after extinction
while our optogenetic manipulations more specifically targeted
responses occurring during the shock omission time period. In
fact, phasic dopamine signaling in vmPFC, as may occur during
shock omission, could more readily recruit D1 receptors which
are less sensitive to dopamine than D2 receptors47. In contrast,
D2 receptors could participate more in tonic dopamine signaling
through their higher dopamine affinity and serve to facilitate fear
extinction, a possibility directly supported by the finding that
pharmacological D2 receptor blockade in vmPFC reduces
extinction21. The different receptors may modulate distinct cell
populations to produce these differential effects as D1 and D2
receptors are known to be preferentially expressed in distinct
neuronal subpopulations in other brain regions48,49.
A notable aspect of our findings is the discovery of a specific
dopamine projection to the NAc mShell which is distinct from

 projections to the NAc core and regulates fear extinction. This is
consistent with a previous in vivo microdialysis study which
found that dopamine in mShell increased at the cessation of an
aversive predictive cue10, while dopamine levels decreased in
response to the cue itself in the NAc core9,10. The changes
in dopamine levels in both regions were only present early in
extinction learning, further suggesting an involvement in learn-
ing/consolidation. The enhanced dopamine signaling in mShell
restricted to early extinction trials also suggests that dopamine
release there reflects a prediction error signal that guides learning.
The medial to lateral gradient of mShell vs. core projecting
dopamine neurons also extends to more laterally situated
VTA-dopamine populations which project to the lateral Shell
(lShell)50,51. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that
GABAergic D1 receptor expressing medium spiny neurons in
NAc mShell and lShell have distinct connectivity with reciprocally
connected and distinct mShell and lShell projecting VTA-
dopamine neurons51, suggesting a possible mechanism for indi-
vidualized regulation of these different populations of dopamine
neurons. While another microdialysis study52 reported increases
in dopamine in mShell in response to aversive predictive cues,
because of the limited temporal specificity of the microdialysis
technique this increase could reflect CS offset responses similar to
what has been seen in previous work10. This may be related to
the role of NAc dopamine in pain relief learning11–13, which may
share similar neural substrates with fear extinction. Together with
our results, these previous studies support a role for dopamine
release in the NAc mShell in modulating fear extinction memory
consolidation. The fact that inhibition of this dopamine projec-
tion only affected long-term retention of extinction, while the
VTA-dopamine cell body manipulations affected both extinction
learning and retention suggests that there may be other popula-
tions of dopamine neurons which project to different brain
regions that participate in extinction learning. These populations
may work together with substantia nigra dopamine projections to
the
dorsal
striatum
which
have
been
implicated
in
fear
extinction53.
These results also suggest a differential involvement of NAc
core vs. mShell in extinction learning, but how dopamine in
mShell relates to MAPK phosphorylation in vmPFC and amyg-
dala is not clear. One possibility is that the mShell regulates
vmPFC and amygdala through basal ganglia connectivity loops.
In fact, the NAc projects indirectly to both the amygdala and
vmPFC54–58. Furthermore, previous work has demonstrated that
the NAc core and mShell are functionally distinct37,54,59 and
maintain differential connectivity with the rest of the basal
ganglia54.
For
example,
anatomical
studies
have
found
that vmPFC projects preferentially to NAc mShell while dor-
somedial PFC preferentially innervates NAc core, though these
distinctions are not absolute54–56. NAc projects to ventral

 pallidum, which projects in turn to distinct thalamic subregions
which innervate either vm- or dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) as well as
amygdala54–58. From the perspective of fear and reward learning
these distinctions could be important as vm- and dmPFC have
been implicated in distinct reward and aversive functions2,60,
with vmPFC participating in extinction and dmPFC being
important in producing fear responses2,61. Providing functional
support for the idea that NAc regulates extinction related net-
works, deep brain electrical stimulation of NAc facilitates fear
extinction and MAPK phosphorylation in vmPFC and amygdala
and this effect is dependent on neural activity in the NAc62.
Furthermore, stimulation of amygdala inputs to NAc also
enhanced extinction learning and activated vmPFC and, to a
lesser extent, dmPFC neurons45. Together, this suggests that the
NAc mShell modulates vmPFC and amygdala function during
fear extinction learning, possibly through distributed, but pre-
ferential connectivity with these regions.
These findings could also have relevance for the treatment of
human anxiety disorders. The importance of dopamine in fear
extinction learning in humans was highlighted by one study
reporting that a polymorphism in the dopamine transporter 1
(DAT1) gene, which likely increases dopamine levels, enhanced
fear extinction63. Similarly, pharmacologically enhancing dopa-
mine neurotransmission in humans facilitates fear extinction
learning64. Exposure therapies such as extinction are first line
treatments for anxiety disorders such as PTSD. Our results
combined with the human work implicating the dopamine sys-
tem in extinction suggest that enhancing dopamine signaling, and
particularly dopamine release in the NAc during extinction could
be an important therapeutic adjuvant when combined with
exposure therapy. This could be accomplished through pharma-
cological means64 and/or through counterconditioning45,65,66
(but see ref. 67), a treatment technique which combines exposure
therapy with rewarding experiences and may preferentially
engage the NAc projecting dopamine circuit.
Methods
Subjects. Male Long-Evans TH-Cre rats24 9–20-week old were housed individually
in temperature and humidity controlled environments on 12-h light-dark cycles
(lights on from 8AM to 8PM) and provided with food and water ad libitum. TH-
Cre breeding males were mated with 9 weeks old or older Long-Evans females
(Japan SLC, Inc) in 2 week breeding periods to generate the TH-Cre colony.
Littermates were assigned to experiment and control groups whenever possible.
Experiments were all conducted during the animal’s light cycle. All procedures
conformed to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the
RIKEN Brain Science Institute.
Viruses. AAV5-EF1α-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP, AAV5-EF1α-DIO-eYFP, AAV9-
CAG-FLEX-ArchT-GFP, AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GFP were produced by the University
of North Carolina Vector Core (UNC, North Carolina, USA). CAV2-FLEX-flp was
produced by the Montpellier vector core. AAV9-CAG-fDIO-eArchT3.0-eYFP and
AAV9-CAG-fDIO-eYFP were produced and packaged in our lab.
Virus or tracer injection and implantation. Animals were induced and main-
tained under isoflurane anesthesia (Pfizer) at 1.5–3%. Animals were then placed in
a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments) for virus injection and optical fiber
insertion. For VTA manipulation experiments, AAV5 constructs were injected
bilaterally into the VTA (AP -5.4, ML ±0.8, DV -7.9) using a Hamilton syringe
(catalog #80100) attached to a Harvard Apparatus pump (PHD2000) at a rate of
0.1 µl/min (1 µl per side). 20 min post-injection, injection cannulae were with-
drawn, and a dual fiber optic cannula (200 µm diameter, NA 0.37, Doric Lenses)
was inserted bilaterally dorsal to the injection sites (AP -5.7, ML ±0.8, DV -7.6).
Fiber optic cannulae were secured using head screws, a layer of Super Bond cement
(Sun Medical) followed by application of acrylic dental cement. Animals were
trained 3 weeks post-surgery. For terminal manipulation and voltammetry
experiments, AAV9 constructs were injected bilaterally at 0.1 µl/min into four sites
(0.5 µl per site) in VTA (AP -6.2 and -5.3, ML ±0.7, DV -8.4 and -7.4). For terminal
manipulations, 6–9 weeks after the virus injection animals were anesthetized again
and implanted with two optical fibers (200 µm diameter, NA 0.39, Thorlabs) on
each side of the NAc (AP + 1.5, ML ±1.5, DV -6.75), LA (AP -2.9, ML ±5.3,
DV -8), or IL (30° angle at AP + 2.8, ML ±3.1, DV -3.5; tip of the fibers at
AP + 2.8, ML ±0.9, DV -4.6). For manipulation of mShell or core projecting
VTA-dopamine neuron experiments, CAV2-FLEX-flp was injected bilaterally at
0.1 µl/min (0.3 µl/site) in either NAc shell (AP + 1.0 and + 2.0, ML ±0.6, DV -7.6)
or core (AP + 1 and + 2, ML ±2.0, DV -7.6) and flp-dependent AAV constructs
(1.0 µl/side) were injected into VTA (AP -5.7, ML ±0.8, DV -7.9). A dual fiber
optical cannula was implanted above the VTA using the same procedures described
above. Animals were then allowed to recover for one week before behavioral
experiments began at which time they were handled for 5 min each, 4 days before
fear conditioning. For retrograde tracer experiment, 0.3 μl of Alexa Fluor 555 or
647 conjugated cholera toxin subunitB was ipsilaterally injected into Nac shell
(AP + 1.5, ML 0.6, DV-7.6) and core (AP + 1.5, ML 2.0, DV-7.6).
In vivo surgery and stimulation. For voltammetry experiments, rats injected with
AAV9 contructs in VTA 6–12 weeks previously were anesthetized with isoflurane
and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Anesthesia was maintained with 0.5–1% iso-
flurane inhalation concentration. Craniotomies were made over the nucleus
accumbens (1.9 mm anterior, 1 mm lateral relative to bregma) and medial fore-
brain bundle (-2.8 mm posterior, 1.8 mm lateral) in one hemisphere (left) for sti-
mulating and recording electrode insertion. A third craniotomy was made over the
opposite hemisphere for reference and auxiliary electrode insertion. A carbon fiber
(cf)-optrode was lowered into the NAc (~7.2 mm V) with the cf-containing silica
tube placed at the coordinates above. One silver wire (auxiliary electrode) and one
silver/silver chloride wire (reference electrode) was inserted into the cortex of the
contralateral hemisphere. A pair of stainless steel bipolar stimulating electro-
des were lowered to the MFB. The dorsal–ventral placement of the stimulating
electrode was adjusted to obtain maximal dopamine overflow during initial sti-
mulation (24 pulses, 60 Hz, 0.3 mA, 4 ms/pulse). After stable and maximal striatal
dopamine release was confirmed, trials with stimulation preceded by light appli-
cation (Laser) alternated with trials without light application (No Laser).
Behavioral conditioning experiments. Animals were randomly assigned to
groups prior to the start of each experiment. Animal numbers/groups were decided
based on standard practices in fear conditioning and extinction experiments.
During fear conditioning, animals were placed in a sound-isolating chamber
(MED-PC, Med Associates) and presented with auditory conditioned stimuli (CS)
paired with an aversive footshock unconditioned stimulus (US) 3X. The CS was a
series of 20 kHz-pitch tone pips presented at 1 Hz (250 ms pulse width, 20 pulses,
74 dB, 750 ms inter-pip interval). The shock US (1 s, 0.7 mA) began at the onset of
the last pip and lasted for 1 s (so outlasted final pip by 750 ms). Variable intertrial
intervals (ITIs) averaged at 130 s were used. During fear extinction training 24 h
later, animals were attached to a laser through fiber optic cabling and placed in a
novel chamber with fluorescent lights off and a different scent in the box and the
CS was presented repeatedly (22 × ) without the shock US. During each CS pre-
sentation laser illumination occurred starting either at the onset of the final pip and
lasting for 3 s (the shock omission period) or throughout the auditory CS period
(light onset occurred 400 ms prior to CS/first pip onset and terminated 50 ms after
final pip termination). For the inhibition during shock omission experiments, the
3 s laser stimulation period was selected because a previous study10 showed that
dopamine levels increased in the NAc mShell after an expected shock was omitted
and that the dopamine peaked after the offset of where the shock would have
occurred. Intertrial intervals were variable averaging 150.9 s. Before each experi-
ment laser power was adjusted to 12–15 mW of power at the tip of optical fibers.
During extinction retrieval trials 24 h later, animals were returned to the extinction
context with the same lighting and scent conditions as extinction training, and
given five presentations of the same CS with variable ITIs averaging 150 s. Freezing
levels were averaged in two trial bins during extinction training, and in a five trial
average during testing. In the pMAPK study, control animals were placed in the
same environment but without tones for the same amount of time. In the LA/B
terminal inhibition studies, six of the ArchT and seven of the GFP injected animals
were trained using a 1 kHz-pitch tone CS after previously being trained with 5 kHz-
pitch tones. Twenty-four hours later, the animals were given extinction trials with
light inhibition as in other animals, but with 1 kHz tones. The rest of the LA/B
animals received the same training as the other experiments described above. No
significant differences in freezing rates were found between groups experiencing 1
kHz vs. 5 kHz extinction and extinction retrieval trials, so their data were grouped.
Freezing behavior during the 20 s CS period of fear training and during the 5 CS
presentations of extinction retrieval were scored automatically using the Video
Freeze program v2.7.1 (SOF 843, Med Associates) or a customized optical flow-
based freezing program designed in Matlab. To avoid conflating freezing with
sleeping during the longer extinction trials, all extinction freezing was scored
manually by a rater blind to the identity of the treatment groups using a stopwatch.
Freezing was defined as the cessation of all bodily movements except for breathing
or sleep. The methods used to quantify freezing were identical across all experi-
mental runs and were the same across all experimental groups.
For fear conditioning studies (Fig. 2) stimuli and presentation were identical to
that described above for fear conditioning before extinction except that laser onset
occurred 400 ms prior to shock US onset and was turned off 50 ms after US offset
(total duration = 1.45 s). For the offset control group, laser onset occurred 30–50 s
(pseudorandom selection) after US offset. 24 h later animals were presented with 5
tone CSs as described above during a retrieval test.

 Histology. Within 3 days of the final experiment, animals were overdosed with
25% chloral hydrate and perfused with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS). Brains were
then post-fixed in a 30% sucrose PBS solution and then embedded in optimal
cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek) and sliced into 40 µm
coronal sections using cryostat. Slices were then mounted on subbed glass slides
(Matsunami, FRC-02), coverslipped using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Mole-
cular Probes) for microscopic examination. Additional sections were stored in
0.05% Sodium Azide PBS. In the pMAPK study, animals are sacrificed and per-
fused one hour after extinction training or one hour after being placed in the box
for the same amount of time. Animals were excluded from analyses if virus
expression was minimal/off-target or if fiber optic placements were incorrect
(assessed blindly).
Immunohistochemistry. For verification of TH specificity of expression and
visualization of terminals, immunohistochemistry was performed prior to
mounting/coverslipping. Sections were washed 3 × in PBST (0.3% Triton-X in PBS)
and blocked for 30 min in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST. Slices were
then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in BSA-PBST overnight at 4°C in the
dark. Next day, sections were washed 3× in PBS and incubated for 1 h in secondary
antibodies (if necessary) diluted in BSA-PBST. After rinsing with PBS, slices were
mounted as stated above. Primary antibodies used were goat anti-GFP Alexa Fluor
488 conjugate (1:1000, sc-5385 Santa Cruz), rabbit or mouse anti-TH (1:2000,
AB152 MAB5280 Millipore), rabbit or mouse anti-GFP (1:2000, A11122 A11120
Life Technologies). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-
mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:500, A11034 A11029 A10037 A11032 Invitrogen).
In the pMAPK study, sections were incubated in 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for
30 min before wash. The primary antibody used was rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42
MAPK Erk1/2 Thr202/204 (1:2000, #9101 Cell Signaling Technology). Sections
were incubated for 72 h at 4°C. After incubation and 3 × PBS wash, sections were
placed in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min (1:200, Vectastain Elite PK-
6101 ABC HRP Kit, Vector). Following another 3 × PBS wash, sections were
incubated in avidin-biotinylated HRP for 30 min (ABC HRP Kit) and washed again
3 × PBS. For visualization, slices were placed in a solution containing diamino-
benzidine (DAB), hydrogen peroxide, and nickel (DAB Substrate Kit, SK-4100
Vector) for 5–10 min until staining of cell bodies was apparent. We used the same
staining time for sections from all groups once the sufficient amount of time was
determined. Sections were washed in distilled water, mounted on gelatin-coated
slides, dehydrated using a series of 70%–95%–100% EtOH and finally xylene
solutions, and coverslipped in Permount (Fisher).
Electrochemistry. Electrochemical recordings using FSCV were made in anes-
thetized rats with carbon fiber (cf) microelectrodes. The cf electrodes consisted of
7-μm-diameter carbon fibers (Goodfellow, Cambridge, England) threaded through
silica tubing (100 µm i.d., 160 µm o.d., Polymicro Technologies) backfilled with
epoxy resin. To make a cf optrode, the cf-threaded silica tubing was appended with
silver paint (Dottite, Fujikura Kasei, Japan) to the metal holder for a 200 µm-
diameter optic fiber such that the tubing extended parallel with the optic fiber at a
distance of approximately 0.5 mm. The cf tip was cut to extend approximately
300 µm from the tip of the silica tubing. A commercial counter electrode-grounded
type potentiostat (Model HECS-972E, Huso Electrochemical Systems, Kawasaki,
Japan) was used for electrochemical recordings. Data acquisition was performed by
a commercial control/recording system (TH-1; ESA Biosciences, Inc., MA, USA
with two multifunction boards (NI-PCI-6221, National Instruments, TX, USA)
implemented on a Windows PC (MODEL). The gain of the amplifier was 500 nA/
V and the low-pass filter time-constant was 0.2 ms. Voltage scans from -0.4 V to
1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference, and back from 1.3 V to -0.4 V, were applied to the cf
electrode. This triangle-positive waveform was repeated at 10 Hz. Using this
waveform, in vitro calibration of the cf electrodes was performed where a flow of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was switched to PBS containing known con-
centrations of dopamine, pH shifts or adenosine. The pH shifts were set using a
pH-meter and adjusted with HCl or NaOH solution. Further calibration of light-
generated artifact signals was made in vivo (see Electrochemistry analysis).
Confocal imaging. For quantification of the specificity of TH expression (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1), VTA sections were doubled stained for TH (594 mm) and GFP
(488 mm) and imaged under a confocal laser microscope (Fluoview FV-1000,
Olympus). Images of lateral VTA were taken with a 20× objective. Counts of green
cell bodies (GFP positive cells) which were also labeled for TH (red) were made and
averaged across different sections as percentage of double labeled GFP+ cells.
Assessment was performed by an individual blind as to treatment condition.
Data analysis. Two-way ANOVA, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, and
unpaired Student’s t-tests were calculated using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad). Significant
interactions or main effects in the ANOVAs were analyzed for multiple compar-
isons (α = 0.05) using Holm–Sidak test, which gives greater power than the Bon-
ferroni and Tukey methods68. In the pMAPK study, immunoreactivity was
quantified using four slices for each animal imaged with 10 × tiles on a microscope
in bright field (BX63, Olympus). An experimenter blind to the identity of the
groups cut out the IL and LA areas in the images and thresholded the brightness
levels to obtain a count of the number of cells in the predefined areas using ImageJ.
Results were calibrated by dividing by the area where counts were made to get
counts of number of positive cells per mm2. All behavioral experiments were run at
least 2 × with groups consisting of experimental and control animals.
Electrochemistry analysis. Voltammetric data were first analyzed as background-
subtracted currents relative to the mean of 10 waveform applications 1 s before the
time of light application (3 s before electrical stimulation). The differential currents
across the voltage scan were analyzed with principal component regression analysis
using modified TH-1 CV-Analysis software (Paul Phillips Laboratory). Calibration
templates were constructed using in vivo dopamine and pH templates that corre-
sponded to known values obtained in vitro. In vivo adenosine templates were
additionally used but were assigned nA current values for regression instead of
concentration. Although optic fibers were not directly oriented toward the cf
electrodes, 600 nm wavelength light application generated a voltammetric artifact
similar to that observed previously with 460 nm69 (Supplementary Fig. 4a and c).
Although the same laser power was applied to all optic fibers, the amplitudes of light-
generated artifact were unique for each animal due to variation in relative tip position
between the optic fiber and cf probes. Therefore, calibration curves for light-generated
current voltage curves were constructed based on graded laser power within each
animal. Application of principal component regression analysis to calibration tem-
plates that included these light-generated calibration curves successfully separated
DA-like signals from light-generated signals. The DA-calibrated signals were averaged
over five stimulation trials of Laser and No Laser within each subject. Since there was
no significant difference in dopamine release evoked in ArchT vs. GFP animals in No
Laser trials (Supplementary Fig. 5) we calculated the percent difference in the peak
value during light application relative to without light for each group and compared
their means using an unpaired t-test.
