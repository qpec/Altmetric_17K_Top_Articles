Evaluation of determinants of walking
fitness in patients attending cardiac
rehabilitation
Patrick Doherty, Jassas FM Alotaibi
ABSTRACT
Aim This study aims to investigate the ability of
patients’ baseline characteristics to predict the distance
walked during the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT)
in the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) population and to
produce reference values to guide practice.
Methods Secondary analysis was conducted on
National Audit Cardiac Rehabilitation data collected
between 2010 and 2015. Patients (n=8863) were
included if they were aged �18 years and had a
recorded ISWT score assessed before starting CR.
Stepwise regression was used to identify factors
predicting the ISWT distance. Age, gender, body mass
index, height, weight; presence of hypertension,
dyslipidemia or diabetes; smoking and physical activity
were independent variables. ISWT distance was the
dependent variable. The 25th, 50th and 75th
percentiles of the ISWT distance were used as
reference values.
Results Age and gender explained 27% of the
variance of the distance covered in the ISWT (R2=0.27,
adjusted R2=0.27,Standard Error of the Estimate (SEE)
= 148.7, p<0.001). Reference values using age and
gender categories were developed.
Conclusion Age and gender were the significant
factors for predicting the walking fitness in the CR
population, with age being the best predictor. The age
and gender reference values produced represent a
potentially valuable tool to be used in the clinical
setting.
INTRODUCTION
Assessing physical fitness at baseline and
end of programme in patients attending
cardiac
rehabilitation
(CR)
is
strongly
recommended in clinical guidelines and
national standards.1–3 Assessing a patient’s
fitness
level
at
the
beginning
of
the
programme enables the appropriate inten-
sity of exercise to be prescribed, determines
the level of supervision and monitoring
required and allows for the assessment of
the effectiveness of the intervention.3 4
Using laboratory maximal tests on tread-
mills
or
cycle
ergometers
to
assess
cardiorespiratory
fitness
by
directly
measuring the maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2
max or Vo2 peak) is regarded as the gold
standard.
However,
these
tests
are
not
widely available.1 5 Compared with the gold
standard methods, functional fitness walk
tests are simple and safe to use and are a
reasonable surrogate measure of fitness.6 In
the UK, the most commonly used field test
in CR and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease patients is the incremental shuttle
walk test (ISWT), which is an objective test
widely used in clinical settings to assess the
extent of physical fitness.5 6 This type of
test is shown to be reliable and strongly
correlated with the cardiopulmonary exer-
cise
test
(CPET).7
8
The
ISWT
is
a
submaximal, incremental, externally paced
test that evaluates physical fitness based on
the distance
covered
during the assess-
ment.6 8 The recommended protocol is a
20 min test followed by a 30 min rest period
before
the
test
is
repeated.
The
best
outcome of the two tests is then recorded.
However, in routine clinical practice, the
ISWT
is
generally
performed
just
once
despite emerging research suggesting that
the
learning
effect
may
influence
the
distance achieved as evidenced through a
second baseline test.9 Most CR programmes
struggle to carry out even a single baseline
fitness test,10 which makes undertaking a
second test unrealistic. To date, very few
studies have tried to establish reference
values as a comparison with the first ISWT
attempt, and where it has been attempted,
the sample size has been insufficient within
the proposed categories.11 12
Healthy individuals have been shown to
walk double the distance of patients with
cardiac disease during the ISWT (600–800
m vs 300–400 m, respectively).11 Predicting
the distance covered during the ISWT has
been attempted in several studies in healthy
populations13–17; however, to date, only two
studies have been published using a CR

These
two
studies
conducted
by
Pepera et al (2013) and Cardoso et al (2016) explained
20% and 25%, respectively, of the variance in distance
walked, and the latter study attempted to produce
reference values for CR patients. Age, height, body
mass index (BMI) and the presence of diabetes were
found to be significant predictors in the study by
Cardoso et al while Pepera et al found only height and
BMI to be significant. However, the limited number of
female participants and the small number of centres
used limit the generalisability and clinical usefulness of
these results. The need for reference values remains
important as they could help reduce or even eliminate
the need to do the ISWT a second time and could be
used as feedback for patients in respect of their level of
fitness.
The aims of this study were (1) to identify any addi-
tional important predictors, beyond age and gender, of
the distance covered during the ISWT at baseline, (2)
to produce reference values for the distance walked by
CR patients during the ISWT and (3) to propose an
approach for benchmarking performance following the
test. This information has the potential to be used to
guide
clinical
practitioners’
expectations
of
the
patients’ performance in an ISWT and help them set
realistic CR goals.
METHODS
This observational study was reported according to the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology.18
Data collection
Secondary analysis was conducted using anonymised
individual
patient
data
from
the
National
Audit
Cardiac Rehabilitation (NACR) database from 2010 to
2015. NACR is a national quality-assurance project
which is designed to ensure that the optimum CR
outcomes are achieved with patients with cardiovas-
cular disease and that the CR programmes follow good
practice as defined by the clinical minimum stand-
ards.10
19 The NACR data are collected under 251
approval by National Health Service Digital. The data
are entered by the centres themselves into the NACR
database.
This
database
includes
information
concerning the patients’ demographic and anthropo-
metric details, initial event, risk factors, treatment,
medications,
physical
activity
status
and
clinical
outcomes following CR.10
Patients were included in the analysis if they were
adults (>18 years); were postmyocardial infarction,
coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary
intervention or valve surgery patients; had already
been assessed at baseline before starting CR; had
undertaken the ISWT and hence their fitness had been
assessed and their age, gender, height, weight, BMI
and comorbidities had also been recorded.
Incremental shuttle walk test
In this test, the patient walks a 10 metre course, known as
a shuttle. The patient walks continuously back and forth
between two cones and an audio signal dictates the
walking speed. The test has 12 levels, at each level the
number of shuttles the patient is required to walk
increases. The test ends when the patient completes the
12 levels, achieves 80% of the maximum heart rate
(HRmax= 220�age), rate perceived exertion (RPE) is
more than 15, is no longer able to keep up with the audio
signal, or is too breathless. When the patient finishes the
test, the number of shuttles, and hence the distance
covered, is recorded.20 21
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean and standard deviation
(SD). An independent t-test was used to determine the
differences between men and women at baseline. Pear-
son’s correlation was used to study the relationship
between outcome and the potential predicted variables.
By accounting for age, the difference in the distance
walked between men and women was assessed using
two-way ANOVA. Stepwise multiple regression analysis
was used to investigate which factors predict ISWT
distance. Age, gender, BMI, height and weight; pres-
ence
of
hypertension,
dyslipidemia
or
diabetes;
smoking (yes, no) and physical activity level at baseline
based on meeting the 150 min/week recommendation
(yes, no) were entered into the regression as indepen-
dent variables. The key outcome was the distance
covered in metres during the ISWT. Prior to the anal-
ysis, it was decided to consider only variables which
explained more than 5% of the variance. The assump-
tions of the regression model were checked and there
were no violations.
The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the distance
walked were produced to provide reference values. Data
were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science
V.23. A p value <0.05 is considered to be significant.
RESULTS
The study population comprised patients from 48 centres
in the UK who had undertaken the ISWT as a baseline
assessment (figure 1). Of the 8863 patients, 6893
(77.78%) were male and 1970 (23.22%) were female.
The patient demographics and the baseline charac-
teristics are summarised in table 1. The mean age of
the group was 63.26±11.09 years and ranged from 20
to 99 years; the mean BMI was 27.86±4.56 kg/m2
(table 1). There was a significant difference between
the ages of men and women (62.7±11 vs 65.11±11.24,
p<0.001), respectively. Men were also significantly
taller (174.27±7.00) than women (160.16±6.64). The
mean distance covered by the overall sample was
358.11±174.40 m. After taking account of age in the
analysis, the men walked significantly further than
women
(384.24±175.41

 The equation developed in this study to predict the
ISWT distance was:
719.2�(6.95xage)+(101.18xgender) (Where male=1
and female=0)
None of the following variables; BMI, height, weight,
smoking, physical activity level or the presence of
hypertension,
dyslipidemia
and
diabetes
made
no
considerable contribution as predictors to the model.
Tables 3 and 4 show the age-related reference
values according to patient gender. In each age band,
the distances walked by women were significantly
shorter than those walked by men. There was an
inverse relationship between the values of distance
walked and age bands for both men and women. The
youngest age group (�44 years) for both genders
walked the farthest and the oldest age group (�80)
walked the shortest distance, and this remained true
for each centile value.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the factors which best predict the distance
covered in the ISWT and the reference values for this
distance at the baseline of the CR assessment were
produced
using
national
level
data
from
routine
clinical practice. The main findings of this study were
that age and gender were significant predictors of the
variance in distance walked during the ISWT.
The results indicated that age was the best predictor
explaining 21% of the variance in the distance covered
and
was
inversely
correlated
with
fitness.
It
was
reported that the direction of this correlation might be
due to changes which occur in parallel with ageing
such as cardiovascular responses related to a decrease
in the maximal heart rate, arteriovenous oxygen differ-
ence, ejection fraction and a reduction in maximal
cardiac output,22–24 or the decrease in maximal oxygen
uptake and a reduction in both muscle mass and
muscle strength.13 This 21% value is in agreement with
the result reported in the study by Cardoso et al11 in
female participants, higher than the 4% reported in a
previous study in healthy subjects.14 This study found
that gender explained 6% of the variance, which is in
agreement with the study by Dourado et al; however,
gender was reported to explain more in the study by
Cardoso et al (11%).
The current results explained more of the variance
in distance walked than that reported in previous
studies in a similar CR population.11

BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med: first published as 10.1136/bmjsem-2016-000203 on 10 March 2017. Downloaded from 
 conducted recently by Cardoso et al reported that
age, height and the presence of diabetes explained
24% and 25% of the variance in the distance walked
by female and male participants, respectively, while
in men, an additional significant predictor was BMI.
However, in that study, the results for the female
participants were based on a very small sample of
patients with diabetes (n=35), whereas, in this study
(n=8863),
the
presence
of
diabetes
did
not
contribute significantly to the explanation of the vari-
ance in either men or women. In the earlier study
by Pepera et al12, height and BMI explained 20% of
this variance; however, unlike in the current study,
neither age nor gender were significant predictors,
which might be due to the lower age range of the
participants and the small sample of women.
Conversely, the results from this study showed a
lower
R2
value
(R2=0.27,
adjusted
R2=0.27,
SEE=148.7, p<0.001) than that reported in previous
studies where reference equations were developed to
predict
the
distance
covered
during
ISWT
in
a
healthy population.13–17 However, the protocol of the
ISWT was extended in these studies from 12 to 15
levels to avoid the ceiling effect,13–15 whereas in a
typical CR patient, achieving a distance over and
above the standard ISWT (12 levels) is unlikely.10
Reference values
On the basis of the results obtained from this study, we
have created reference values according to age and
gender. Age was the stronger predictor and gender, in
addition to its modest predictive function, is routinely
used in literature to differentiate fitness values.1 11 25
26 The practical implications of these reference values
are to guide practitioners’ expectations about how well
patients might perform in an ISWT, to assist in the
initial interpretation of the ISWT results to assess the
need for a second test, to help patients understand
their fitness level in relation to their peers and to set
realistic goals to improve their physical condition as
part of the CR intervention.
As mentioned previously, there is only one study
which
has
attempted
to
produce
ISWT
reference
values
for
the
CR
population.11
Cardoso
et
al
produced reference values for patients who joined
the
outpatient
CR
programme
based
on
547
patients: 132 women and 415 men. The patients
were divided into age bands at 5-year intervals from
25 to 90 (13 bands) according to gender. However,
the use of these reference values might be consid-
ered
unrealistic
due
to
the
small
number
of
participants,
most
notably
fewer
females,
which
resulted in an average number of approximately 10
participants in each band. In addition, the data were
obtained from only four UK hospitals, compared
with 48 CR programmes in this study, which might
be considered unrepresentative of the general popu-
lation with cardiac disease.
In
this
study,
we
divided
the
group
into
nine
bands, seven of them at 5-year intervals. The two
remaining bands, namely the first and the last band,
were larger as we found that there was no significant
difference in the mean of the ISWT distance walked
between the patients within each of these marginal
bands regardless of age. The median distance walked
by men and women in the youngest age band (�44
years) was 520 m and 375 m, respectively, which was
more than twice the distance walked in the oldest
age band (�80 years) at 200 m for men and 160 m
for women. We used the 25th and 75th percentiles
as they are a useful guide for CR practitioners to
evaluate baseline score and assist with goal setting as
part of core CR delivery.
The major strength of this study was the large
sample, covering a wide age range in the CR popu-
lation suffering from different comorbidities, which
was sufficient to enable the analysis. However, the
study was not without limitations. Due to the retro-
spective
nature
of
the
study,
some
significant
predictors that
were
reported in
previous studies
were
not
found
in
the
NACR
database
such
as
resting heart rate, rate of perceived exertion and
hand strength grip, and so these were not taken into
consideration.16
The normative values proposed in this article assume
that the ISWT was carried out in a rigorous way but we
are unable to substantiate this. The test is supported by
a clinician, and the patient follows the verbal and bleep
commands from the ISWT audio recording, which
gives some confidence that it was delivered in a consis-
tent manner.
CONCLUSION
Age and gender were the commonly determined key
factors in predicting the ISWT distance in the CR
population, with age being the best predictor. The
reference values produced in this study represent a
valuable tool to be used in a clinical setting. These
findings may assist practitioners in their initial expecta-
tions of patients’ performance in the ISWT, enable
them to interpret the test results to better inform
patients
of
their
fitness
level
and
potentially
aid
patients in the setting of realistic CR goals in respect to
their walking ability.
Implications for practice
" Reference values in this study have the potential to be used as
a tool to help guide CR practitioners’ expectations of ISWT
performance.
" These values can inform practitioners of the need to perform a
second ISWT test.
" Reference values enable CR patients to understand their age
and gender-related walking fitness level prior to starting CR,
which could help set realistic goals.
