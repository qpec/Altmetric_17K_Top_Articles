Background-—Albuminuria is a marker of inflammation and an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
The current study evaluated whether eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation attenuates
progression of albuminuria in subjects with coronary artery disease.
Methods and Results-—Two-hundred sixty-two subjects with stable coronary artery disease were randomized to either Lovaza
(1.86 g of EPA and 1.5 g of DHA daily) or no Lovaza (control) for 1 year. Percent change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)
was compared. Mean (SD) age was 63.3 (7.6) years; 17% were women and 30% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. In nondiabetic
subjects, no change in urine ACR occurred in either the Lovaza or control groups. In contrast, ACR increased 72.3% (P<0.001) in
diabetic subjects not receiving Lovaza, whereas those receiving Lovaza had no change. In diabetic subjects on an angiotensin-
converting enzyme-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, those receiving Lovaza had no change in urine ACR, whereas those
not receiving Lovaza had a 64.2% increase (P<0.001). Change in ACR was directly correlated with change in systolic blood pressure
(r=0.394, P=0.01).
Conclusions-—EPA and DHA supplementation attenuated progression of albuminuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
coronary artery disease, most of whom were on an angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Thus,
EPA and DHA supplementation should be considered as additional therapy to an angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor or
angiotensin-receptor blocker in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus remains the leading cause of
chronic kidney disease worldwide. The prevalence of
diabetic nephropathy, a type of chronic kidney disease, has
been increasing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.1,2
Albuminuria is common in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus,3
hypertension,4
and
the
general
population.5,6
Prospective and epidemiologic studies have shown that
albuminuria is an independent predictor of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality in subjects
with hypertension,7,8 type 2 diabetes mellitus,9–12 and the
general population.13–19 Moreover, urine albumin-to-creati-
nine ratio (ACR) <30 lg/mg, which has generally been
considered in the normal range, has been shown to predict
incident hypertension and cardiovascular disease mortality at
11-year follow-up in subjects who were healthy and nondia-
betic at baseline.20 Furthermore, albuminuria is a better
predictor for long-term mortality after acute myocardial
infarction than C-reactive protein (hazard ratio: 1.8; 95% CI,
1.1–3.1 for albuminuria versus 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7–1.8 for
C-reactive protein).21
Subclinical inflammation may link albuminuria to cardio-
vascular
disease.22

 inflammation; for every 1 mg/L increase in C-reactive protein,
there was a 2% increased odds of albuminuria.23 Albuminuria
is also a marker of generalized endothelial dysfunction, a key
step in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD).24–
26 Albuminuria is also associated with activation of the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone
system.22
Previous
intervention
studies have shown that inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB)
reduced albuminuria and associated cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality in diabetic subjects.27–29 Therefore, ACE-I or
ARB therapy is now considered standard of care for diabetic
patients to reduce albuminuria and associated cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality.30
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are a dietary com-
ponent that can be obtained in fatty fish or as supplements.
Results of prior studies examining the effect of omega-3 fatty
acids on albuminuria have had variable results in nondiabetic
and diabetic subjects,31–36 but no study has examined their
effect on albuminuria in patients with CAD. The objective of
the current study was to assess the effect of very long-chain
omega-3
fatty
acids—eicosapentaenoic
acid
(EPA)
and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of Lovaza—on
albuminuria in patients with stable CAD both with and without
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
Study Design
The study was an open-label, prospective, single-center,
randomized, parallel study of subjects with CAD recruited
from the cardiovascular clinic at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. The protocol was approved by the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and all
subjects signed informed consent. The primary end point of
the trial is to examine the effect of Lovaza on progression of
fatty, fibrous, and calcified plaque in the coronary arteries
over a 30-month period. A prespecified secondary outcome is
change in albuminuria over a 12-month period.
Participants
Eligible participants were aged 36 to 80 years at time of
enrollment and had stable CAD defined as at least 1 of the
following: ≥50% stenosis in at least 1 coronary artery at
catheterization, previous myocardial infarction (≥6 months
prior) or percutaneous coronary intervention (≥6 months
prior), coronary bypass surgery (>12 months prior), abnormal
exercise treadmill test (defined as at least 1 mm of horizontal
or downsloping ST depression in at least 2 contiguous ECG
leads) or an area of reversible ischemia on nuclear imaging,
pharmacologic stress, or stress echocardiography with sub-
sequent
revascularization.
Additional
inclusion
criteria
included normal renal function as measured by estimated
creatinine
clearance
using
the
Cockcroft-Gault
equa-
tion ≥60 mL/min.37 Our aim was to target inflammation with
an omega-3 fatty acid (Lovaza) to prevent progression of
coronary plaque; therefore, we recruited subjects predicted to
have a higher underlying inflammatory burden. Inflammation
underlies overweight/obesity38; thus, additional inclusion
criteria included a body mass index of ≥27 kg/m2 or a body
mass index of 25 to 26.5 kg/m2 with an increased waist
circumference (to reflect abdominal obesity) based on criteria
of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on
Epidemiology and Prevention or at least 2 components of
the metabolic syndrome, which include the following: triglyc-
eride
>150 mg/dL,
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
<40 mg/dL if male or <50 mg/dL if female, glucose
>100 mg/dL or treated hypertension or blood pressure
>135/85 mm Hg.39
Randomization and Study Intervention
Randomization was computer-allocated in blocks of 4 and
stratified by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either open-
label, omega-3 ethyl esters prepared from fish oil (Lovaza) in
the form of 4 capsules daily or no omega-3 supplementation
(termed control). All subjects were taking a statin and aspirin.
Subjects in the Lovaza group received 3.36 g of Lovaza as 4
soft gels, each 1000-mg capsule containing predominantly
EPA (465 mg) and DHA (375 mg) for a total daily dose of
1.86 g EPA and 1.5 g DHA for 12 months. Lovaza was
provided by GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC).
Data Collection and Laboratory Measurements
Data were collected at baseline and at 1 year of intervention
in the Clinical Research Center at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. A detailed history, physical examination,
height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure
measurements and ECG were obtained. Blood samples were
obtained after a 12-hour fast, and plasma and serum were
prepared. Glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), chemical profile,
total white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte,
monocyte, and platelet counts and lipid panel were measured
at Quest Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA).
A morning spot urine sample was collected before
randomization and at 1 year. We did the following in our
urine collection process to minimize variability in ACR.
Circadian variation in albuminuria has been well documented,
with lowest levels during sleep and early morning and highest
during the day40–42; therefore, we collected samples at the

 same time—between 7:30 to 8:30 AM—on both collection
days. Diet and exercise also raise ACR43–46; therefore, we
collected samples in the fasting state and prior to exercise on
the collection day. Because storage of samples prior to
measurement can affect variability,47,48 our samples were
immediately stored at 1 to 4°C and measured within 24 hours
on a single analyzer to minimize variability. Urine albumin was
measured by immunoturbidimetric assay, and urine creatinine
was measured by a colorimetric, kinetic assay at Quest
Diagnostics. Urine albumin (micrograms per milliliter) to
creatinine (milligrams per deciliter) ratio (ACR) was calculated
as a measure of albuminuria. The Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease formula
was
employed
to calculate
estimated
glomerular filtration rate (mL/min per 1.73 m2).
Statistical Analysis
The analysis was performed following intention-to-treat prin-
ciples to compare whether Lovaza attenuated worsening of
albuminuria in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects over a 1-year
period. A similar analysis was done in a prespecified subgroup
of diabetic subjects receiving an ACE-I or an ARB. Normality
tests were conducted using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous
variables were reported as the mean (SD) for normally
distributed variables and as median (interquartile range) for
ACR, which was not normally distributed. Continuous vari-
ables were compared using paired (within group) and unpaired
(control versus Lovaza) t tests for normally distributed
variables. Non-normally distributed variables were compared
using the signed-rank test (within group comparisons) and
Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney (control versus Lovaza). Pairwise
comparisons for each of the study arms compared the
percent change at 1 year compared to baseline and were
stratified according to diabetes mellitus status. All analyses
were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.) or
SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). All tests were 2-
sided and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Participants
Of 336 subjects assessed for eligibility, 13 were excluded as
they did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 32 declined to
participate (Figure). The remaining 291 subjects were ran-
domized with 147 allocated to Lovaza and 144 assigned to no
Lovaza (control). Thirteen of those receiving Lovaza and 15 of
those not receiving Lovaza discontinued the intervention and
did not have 1-year follow-up. The intention-to-treat analysis
included 262 subjects (134 receiving Lovaza and 128 in
control) with measurements of ACR at baseline and 1-year
follow-up. Four subjects did not tolerate Lovaza; 17 controls
took fish oil.
For the total group, mean age (SD) was 63.3 (7.6) years,
17.2% (45) were women, and 30% (79) had type 2 diabetes
mellitus; 85% of diabetic subjects were receiving an ACE-I or
ARB. The baseline characteristics stratified by diabetes
mellitus status are shown in Table 1. Glucose, HbA1c, and
ACR levels were significantly lower in the nondiabetic subjects
compared to the diabetic subjects. There was no significant
difference in any baseline characteristics in the control and
Lovaza groups stratified by diabetes mellitus status (Table 2).
Outcomes
Table 3 shows the change at 1-year follow-up in the control
versus Lovaza groups for the nondiabetic subjects. Those
receiving Lovaza had a significant reduction in triglyceride
level (P<0.001) and increase in high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level (P=0.01). The triglyceride reduction in those
receiving Lovaza was significantly different compared to those
not receiving Lovaza (P<0.001), but high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol change was not (P=0.23). Of note, there was no
significant change in glucose levels in either group.
Table 4 shows the change at 1-year follow-up in the
control versus Lovaza groups for the diabetic subjects. Those
receiving Lovaza had a significant reduction in triglyceride
level (P=0.005) without a change in high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol. Although glucose level significantly increased in
the Lovaza group (P=0.04), there was no significant difference
in percent change in levels of glucose or HbA1c between the
Lovaza and control groups.
ACR was not normally distributed; therefore, we calculated
median change at 1 year compared to baseline in control
versus Lovaza groups stratified by diabetes mellitus status.
Table 5 shows that in nondiabetic subjects, there was no
difference in percent change in ACR in those on Lovaza
compared to those in the control group (�5.85% versus
4.29%, respectively, P=0.56). In contrast, in diabetic subjects,
the controls had a significant 72.3% increase in ACR
(P<0.001) compared to no significant change in those on
Lovaza (4.63%) (P=0.04 for Lovaza versus control). Therefore,
Lovaza attenuated the worsening of ACR in diabetic subjects.
Of note, 61 of the 79 diabetic subjects had ACR <30 lg/mg,
15 had ACR of 30 to 300 lg/mg, and 3 had ACR >300 lg/
mg. In the 7 diabetic controls with baseline ACR 30 to
300 lg/mg, none had improvement in their ACR to <30 lg/
mg at 1-year follow-up. In contrast, among the 8 subjects who
were on Lovaza, 3 had reversal of ACR from 30 to 300 lg/mg
to ACR <30 lg/mg (between group P=0.20). We next
examined the number who had any decrease in ACR. Five in
the control group (12.5%) and 17 in the Lovaza group (43%)
(P=0.002) had a decrease in ACR. This 3-fold difference is

 very significant and demonstrates an important change in an
early phase of albuminuria.
Table 6 stratifies diabetic subjects by ACR <30, 30 to 300,
and >300 lg/mg and shows the change in each group. In
those with ACR <30 lg/mg, the controls had a significant
increase in ACR (P<0.001), whereas those on Lovaza had a
decrease that approached significance (P=0.096) as did the
between-group comparison (P=0.10). In those with ACR 30 to
300 lg/mg, the increase in ACR in controls approached
significance (0.063), whereas those on Lovaza did not have a
significant change. Those on Lovaza with ACR >300 lg/mg
had a decrease in ACR with a small number of subjects. These
results suggest that Lovaza prevents the progression of
albuminuria at an early stage of disease in those with ACR
<30 lg/mg.
Subgroup Analysis in Diabetic Subjects
ACE-I and ARB treatment have been shown to attenuate
worsening of albuminuria in diabetic subjects27–29; therefore,
we examined results in only the diabetic subjects receiving either
an ACE-I or ARB. There were no significant differences in
creatinine clearance at baseline compared to 1 year within the
control group (95.2�22.1 mL/min versus 95.3�26.3 mL/min,

or
within
the
Lovaza
group
(109.7�38.7 mL/min versus 109.3�33.7 mL/min, respec-
tively, P=0.67) and no significant differences in estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
within
the
control
group
(75.7�15.5 mL/min per 1.73 m2 versus 72.9�17.0 mL/min
per 1.73 m2, respectively, P=0.94) or within the Lovaza group
(82.0�17.4 mL/min per 1.73 m2 versus 81.3�14.4 mL/min
per 1.73 m2, respectively, P=0.81). Table 5 shows that, in those
diabetic subjects on an ACE-I or ARB (which includes 85% of
diabetic subjects), diabetic subjects not receiving Lovaza had a
64.2%increaseinACRat1-yearfollow-up,whichwassignificantly
higher than the 2.7% increase in diabetic subjects receiving
Lovaza (P=0.02 for Lovaza versus control). Therefore, Lovaza
attenuated the increase in ACR in those on an ACE-I or ARB.
In the diabetic subjects receiving Lovaza, there was a
significant direct correlation between change in ACR and
change in systolic blood pressure (r=0.394, P=0.01). Because
those on Lovaza did not have a reduction in blood pressure,
we examined this relationship further by comparing the
median change in ACR in the total group of diabetic subjects
stratified by whether they had a decrease or increase in
systolic blood pressure. Table 7 shows that those with a
reduction in systolic blood pressure in the total group of
diabetic
subjects
have
a
significant
decrease
in
ACR
(P=0.005), a finding consistent with the known literature.49
This expected reduction in ACR with decrease in systolic
blood pressure suggests that the ACRs in our study are likely
to be pathological even though the majority had ACR in what
has been considered a normal range. The point is that an ACR
<30 lg/mg may not be normal for diabetic subjects, the
majority of whom will eventually develop worsening ACR. We
then stratified the group by treatment arm. Among controls,
median ACR increased in both those with a decrease and
increase in systolic blood pressure (P=0.81) (Table 7). On the
other hand, among the Lovaza group, those with a reduction
in systolic blood pressure had a median 19% reduction in ACR
compared to a median 49.6% increase in those with an
increase in systolic blood pressure (between-group P<0.001),
a finding suggesting that the effect of Lovaza on ACR is more
pronounced in those with a decrease in blood pressure. When
comparing the treatment arms among those with a reduction
in blood pressure, those receiving Lovaza had a median 19%

 Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial of subjects with CAD, daily
supplementation with Lovaza for 1 year attenuated the
worsening of albuminuria in diabetic subjects, the majority
of whom had an ACR <30 lg/mg. Moreover, significantly
more (3-fold) subjects on Lovaza had a decrease in ACR
compared to control, and 3 on Lovaza had a change in

 category from >30 to <30 lg/mg whereas no controls did.
These results suggest that there is benefit and perhaps even
reversal of ACR with Lovaza at an early stage of disease in
those with ACR <30 lg/mg and those with microalbuminuria.
Since ACE-I or ARB therapy has been shown to reduce
pathologic albuminuria and associated cardiovascular mor-
bidity and mortality27–29 and is now considered standard of
care for diabetic patients,30 we examined whether Lovaza
added any benefit in diabetic subjects who were receiving
ACE-I or ARB treatment and had normal renal function. The
current results show that Lovaza attenuated the increase in
ACR in diabetic subjects on an ACE-I or ARB. Thus, this is the
first study to show that Lovaza may provide benefit in slowing
progression of early-stage albuminuria in diabetic subjects
with CAD on an ACE-I or ARB.
An ACR <30 lg/mg has generally been considered to be
in the normal range; however, nondiabetic, healthy subjects
with an ACR of 7.4 to 30 lg/mg at baseline were recently
reported to have an increased incidence of hypertension and
cardiovascular
mortality
compared
to
those
with
ACR
<7.4 lg/mg in 11-year follow-up.20 Therefore, an ACR
<30 lg/mg may be an early indicator of pathology. The
majority of our subjects had an ACR <30 lg/mg, a finding
which could partially be attributable to the fact that we
minimized variability in ACR measurements by collecting urine
samples in the fasting state at the same time in the early
morning on both collection days, in the absence of exercise
and with measurements on fresh samples within 24 hours. In
this manner, we also minimized level of ACR since ACR levels
are lowest during waking hours in the early morning and
increase postprandially and with exercise.40–42 Under these
conditions, any albumin excretion in the <30 lg/mg range
may be indicative of early pathology. Changes in albuminuria,
including ACR <30 lg/mg, are predictive of cardiovascular
outcomes.20,50 The majority of diabetic subjects will eventu-
ally develop albuminuria; therefore, strategies to lower
progression of albuminuria in the earliest stages may be
important and may prevent or delay atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular disease.51 Our results suggest that if we start a
preventive
strategy
early,
significant
disease
might
be
preventable in some instances or mitigated in others. If one
waits until significant disease is present, reduction in
albuminuria because of structural renal change may not be
possible in the majority of patients.
Prior trials of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on
albuminuria have examined primarily nondiabetic subjects
without known clinical CAD and with various causes of
chronic kidney disease. In a meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials
in patients with albuminuria attributable to either diabetes
mellitus, IgA nephropathy, or mixed causes of renal disease,
omega-3 fatty acids of various doses reduced urinary protein
excretion 19% (95% CI, �34 to �4; P=0.01).32 Previous
studies of the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on albuminuria in
diabetic subjects have been limited. A 21% reduction was
noted in 7 trials of subjects with both type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus, but it was not significant, possibly due to a
small sample size (95% CI, �46 to 4, P=0.10).32 In 2 prior
clinical trials limited to subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus
but without CAD (Table 8), pure EPA significantly reduced
albuminuria over a 12-month period; however, the number of
patients was small, ranging from 21 to 45, and only 1 trial was
randomized.33,34 A third trial of 3.6 g/day of EPA and DHA in
a crossover design of 6-month duration showed no significant
benefit.35 In a fourth trial of 6 weeks duration in type 2
diabetes mellitus, omega-3 fatty acids had no benefit on
albuminuria in the total group, but a significant reduction
occurred when omega-3 fatty acids were added to an ACE-I or
ARB (Table 8).36
The differences in outcome in these previous trials may be
attributable to dose, duration, and differences in study design
and study subject characteristics, which can lead to weakness
in generating conclusions. Compared to these prior studies,
strengths of our clinical trial are that it is the first to examine
CAD patients, included both diabetic and nondiabetic sub-
jects, included a larger number (79) of diabetic subjects than
previous trials, and randomization was stratified by diabetes

 mellitus status. Moreover, it is the first trial to use a high dose
of EPA and DHA for 1 year. Thus, our study design strength-
ens confidence in our findings and the scientific premise that
EPA and DHA may be beneficial.
Potential mechanisms for the beneficial effect of EPA and
DHA include a beneficial effect on renal hemodynamics as
shown in several prior studies.36,52,53 In subjects with
diabetes mellitus receiving Lovaza in the current study, the
change in ACR was significantly directly correlated with the
change in systolic blood pressure; however, Lovaza itself was
not associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure.
Rather, those with a reduction in blood pressure on Lovaza
had a significant reduction in ACR, in contrast to controls who
did not have benefit with blood pressure reduction, a finding
suggesting that beneficial hemodynamic effects may be
contributing to the attenuation of worsening of ACR in those
receiving Lovaza.
A second postulated beneficial effect is through improve-
ment of dyslipidemia. The development of chronic kidney
disease and albuminuria are associated with elevated levels of
serum triglyceride,54 and tissue accumulation of lipids in the
kidney may underlie the development of diabetic nephropa-
thy.55,56 In the current study, diabetic subjects receiving Lovaza
had a significant reduction in triglyceride level; however, there
was nocorrelation between reduction in plasma triglyceride and
attenuation of worsening of albuminuria, a finding suggesting
that plasma triglyceride reduction is not responsible for
attenuation of worsening of albuminuria, although we cannot
exclude changes in tissue accumulation of triglyceride.
In the current study, diabetic subjects receiving Lovaza had
a significant increase in glucose level over 12 months
(P=0.022); however, the between-group change (Lovaza
versus control) in glucose was not significant. This increase
in glucose level could be linked to the triglyceride-lowering
effect of Lovaza which, by impairing hepatic triglyceride
synthesis, may divert substrates from lipogenesis to gluco-
neogenesis in the fasting state. In support of this, Basu et al57
reported that gluconeogenesis was higher in diabetic com-
pared to obese nondiabetic subjects (P<0.05) with omega-3
fatty
acid
supplementation.
Moreover,
Glauber
et al58
reported a significant increase in fasting glucose from 13.1
to 15.3 mmol/L (P=0.03) with omega-3 fatty acid supple-
mentation for 1 month in 6 men with type 2, non-insulin-
dependent
diabetes
mellitus.
They
also
demonstrated
increased
basal
hepatic
glucose
output
(from
97
to
122 mg/m2; P=0.004). On the other hand, in the nonfasting
period, hepatic glucose production is suppressed by the
availability of glucose in the blood. HbA1c reflects the average
glucose level within the prior 3 months in which subjects are
nonfasting and therefore, hepatic gluconeogenesis is sup-
pressed. This may account for the observation of no
significant change in HbA1c levels in the diabetic subjects
receiving Lovaza in the current study.
Limitations of the study include the open-label study
design. Although the trial was randomized, our report of ACR
is a secondary outcome, which may be subject to unmeasured
bias. The number of diabetic subjects in the 30 to 300 lg/mg
ACR category is small and may account for the borderline
statistical significance for worsening of ACR in the control
group. Finally, the number of diabetic subjects on ACE-I or
ARB is small; therefore, the results are exploratory and
hypothesis-generating.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that Lovaza attenuates
progression of albuminuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes
mellitus and CAD, most of whom were on an ACE-I or ARB.

 Dietary modalities that can prevent albuminuria progression
would be cost-effective on a population basis; their relative
lack of side effects and easy availability make them attractive
interventions. Based on our results, the potential benefit of
Lovaza added to ACE-I or ARB therapy should be investigated
in a larger clinical trial of patients with diabetes mellitus and
with albuminuria as the primary end point. If confirmed in a
larger clinical trial of longer duration with albuminuria as the
primary end point, Lovaza may be of benefit to subjects with
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
