Abstract
Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and has been suggested to
play a role in the prevention of age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia). Although leucine supplementation may be
beneficial, the efficacious dose of leucine is unknown. Before conducting studies with increased doses of leucine, the
Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for leucine needs to be determined. The objective of this review is to describe 2 current
studies to determine the UL for leucine in young and elderly men. Initially, in young men we tested the conceptual model
of determining the maximum oxidative capacity of an amino acid to be an ideal marker for identifying the UL. Leucine
oxidation, measured with the use of L-[1-13C]leucine, increased with increasing leucine intakes and reached a plateau at higher
intakes. Two-phase linear regression analysis identified a breakpoint of 550 mg � kg21 � d21 (95% CI: 454, 646 mg � kg21 � d21),
with a simultaneous increase in blood ammonia concentrations above normal values (35 mmol/L). Recently, a similar
study was conducted in elderly men (;72 y old). A breakpoint in leucine oxidation was observed at 431 mg � kg21 � d21 (95%
CI: 351, 511 mg � kg21 � d21), with blood ammonia concentrations above normal (35 mmol/L) at leucine intakes >550 mg �
kg21 � d21. Taking the data together, the UL for leucine intake in healthy elderly men could be set at a value similar to young
men, at 500 mg � kg21 � d–1, or ;35 g/d for an individual weighing 70 kg; or, as a cautious estimate, the leucine UL could
also be considered as 351 mg � kg21 � d21 (the lower 95% CI), which would be ;24.5 g/d for an elderly individual weighing
70 kg. These studies to determine the UL for leucine in humans are acute diet studies, and future studies with additional
biomarkers and long-term supplementation of leucine will be necessary.

Introduction
Leucine, along with isoleucine and valine, is 1 of the 3 BCAAs
(1) and is popular as a dietary supplement among strength-
training athletes and elderly individuals (2). Dietary supplemen-
tation with specific amino acids in excess of the requirement for
protein synthesis may have adverse effects, or it may be
beneficial in some situations. Thus, the determination of the
highest possible intake of each amino acid at which no adverse
effect occurs is important (3).
Dietary protein and amino acids have been explored widely to
help mitigate or treat sarcopenia, which is defined as the progressive
age-associated loss of lean muscle mass and is a major health
concern because it affects the quality of life in elderly individuals
(4–7). In particular, leucine has been proposed as a ‘‘pharmaconu-
trient’’to prevent muscle atrophy (8) since the early findings by Buse
and Reid (9), which showed that leucine stimulates muscle protein
synthesis directly. Leucine supplementation may have potential
benefits in improving muscle strength and function in elderly
populations as shown earlier by Casperson et al. (10) and Ohtani
et al. (11) and more recently by Trabal et al. (12) and Ispoglou et al.
(13), although the efficacious dose of leucine supplementation is
still unknown. Thus, future studies may be conducted with higher
leucine supplement doses (14). Before the conduct of such studies
we need to determine the upper limit of leucine intake in elderly
populations. The objective of this brief review is to cover current
reported leucine intakes in young and elderly men, to describe the

 concept of the DRIs� Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), and to
review the recent studies conducted to determine the UL for leucine
in healthy young and elderly men.
Leucine Intakes in Humans
Reported intakes for leucine are available from the 1988–1994
NHANES III data set. The mean daily intake for all life-stage
and sex groups of leucine from food and supplements was 6100
mg/d in the 2005 DRI report (15). The highest intakes were for
men (aged 51–70 y), with the 99th percentile for leucine at
14,100 mg/d (;201 mg � kg21 � d21 for a 70-kg man). However,
leucine intakes were lower for men aged >71 y, with the 99th
percentile intake being 11,300 mg/d (;161 mg � kg21 � d21
for a 70-kg man). Leucine intakes for women aged >71 y
were even lower, with the 99th percentile intake being
7860 mg/d (;131 mg � kg21 � d21 for a 60-kg woman). Thus,
with aging, a reduction in leucine intakes is normally observed,
which is potentially due to a combination of reasons (16)
including reduced intakes of protein-rich foods, or reduced
food intake due to inability to chew or to disease onset.
DRI Paradigm for Setting ULs
The DRIs refer to the safe upper limits of a nutrient as the UL,
defined as ‘‘the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is
likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all
individuals in the general population. As intake increases above
the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase’’ (15).
The term ‘‘tolerable’’ was chosen to avoid implying a possible
beneficial effect. The recommendation was intended to set a level
of intake that can, with high probability, be tolerated biolog-
ically. In the 2005 DRI report, no UL for leucine was set due to
a paucity of controlled dose-response studies with a focus on
adverse effects (15). In addition, most of the reported supple-
ment studies included all 3 BCAAs as supplements. Intakes of
15–60 g/d (;200–850 mg � kg21 � d–1 for a 70-kg man) of total
BCAAs did not result in adverse event outcomes in athletes,
healthy adults, and patients with clinical disorders such as
phenylketonuria, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and cancer (17,
18). Almost all of these experiments included supplements of
all BCAAs, at many different doses, different ratios among
the BCAAs in intake, different routes of infusion or feed-
ing (intravenous compared with oral), and different athletic
training regimes. Thus, there is a need for well-designed dose-
response studies in both animals and humans, with a specific
criterion to identify the onset of adverse effects. It should also be
noted that the definition of UL for amino acids should be set for
different age groups, because there might be some cases of
alterations or adaptations in metabolism, which could poten-
tially alter the UL. For example, it has been reported that
elderly individuals have increased splanchnic extraction of
leucine and phenylalanine compared with younger individuals
(19, 20). Whether this altered utilization of amino acids with
aging affects the UL for amino acids has not been determined
before now.
Concept for ULs Based on Amino Acid
Oxidation
On the basis of the observations in the DRI (16) report about the
paucity of data from well-controlled dose-response studies, a
conceptual model (21) was proposed to help design studies to
identify the UL for amino acids. The primary idea was that
markers for identifying excess intake of an amino acid should
have specific dose-response characteristics. With graded amino
acid intakes, the marker(s) should display an inflection point
that would identify the onset of the amino acid excess. In an
experiment to identify phenylalanine requirements in neonatal
piglets, direct phenylalanine oxidation with the use of
[1-14C]phenylalanine was used with graded phenylalanine
intakes (22). The objective of the experiment was to define the
minimum requirement for phenylalanine; however, at higher
intakes of phenylalanine, and once the maximum level of
phenylalanine oxidation was reached, plasma phenylalanine
concentrations, and retention, increased rapidly. This maximum
oxidation level was proposed as a potential marker to define the
upper limit of tolerance for a dietary amino acid. The above-
described response pattern for increasing phenylalanine intake
should be observable for most amino acids in a dose-response
relation. Conceptually, once the minimum requirement for the
amino acid is met for protein synthesis and other body functions,
additional intakes of the test amino acid will be primarily
catabolized in proportion to the extra intake (Figure 1). This will
occur because each additional increment in intake will be in
excess of the requirements for metabolism and will be oxidized.
Generally, the catabolic pathways are sufficient to deal with the
excess intake, and the excess amino acid is broken down and
used for energy. However, additional intakes beyond a certain
threshold will lead to increased retention of the amino acid, and
related metabolites within the body pool, including increased
accumulation in the blood, as well as excretion via the urinary
route. The increased retention is a result of dietary intake
exceeding the metabolic capacity to catabolize the amino acid in
direct proportion to intake. This threshold point at which the
metabolic capacity to catabolize or oxidize the excess amino
acid is exceeded can be regarded as one estimate of the UL because
it represents the intake at which the normal regulatory mecha-
nisms are no longer sufficient to dispose of the excess (Figure 1).
The amino acid intake corresponding to this inflection point does
not necessarily represent a toxic intake level, but rather suggests
that, with increasing dietary intakes above this level, the potential
for or risk of adverse events will increase.
FIGURE 1
Concept of determining the UL for dietary amino acids.
With increasing intakes of amino acid above the minimum require-
ment, oxidation of the amino acid will increase and will reach a plateau
once the upper limit to oxidize the amino acid is reached. Increases in
amino acid intake beyond this level will potentially increase the
accumulation of the excess amino acid and its related metabolites.
The risk of adverse effects will increase beyond this threshold. AA,

 Studies to Determine the UL for Leucine
Animal study to determine the UL for leucine. The above-
described approach to use carbon-oxidation methods to identify
an excess intake of leucine was first attempted in young rats (23).
The metabolic limit to catabolize leucine was measured by
testing graded leucine intakes from 0% to 30% of the diet with
U-13C-leucine production to 13CO2. The test diets represented a
range in leucine intakes from 250 to 20,000 mg � kg21 � d21. The
maximum limit to oxidize excess leucine was reached at 10% of
dietary intake, or ;890 mg � kg21 � d21. The oxidation achieved
a plateau above the intakes of 890 mg � kg21 � d21. This
inflection point was noted to be the UL for leucine intake in rats.
Plasma leucine and amino acid concentrations were not signif-
icantly different among all the leucine intakes. Thus, the authors
were unable to identify other potential biomarkers, or metab-
olites. However, in an earlier study, they observed significant
growth inhibition in rats fed 15% leucine or 12,400 mg � kg21 � d21
(23). Thus, the authors suggested that the point at which the
maximum limit to oxidize excess leucine is reached could be an
early marker for an adverse event. In this particular study,
growth inhibition provided that additional marker, although it
was only possible because the study was in growing rats. Thus,
additional markers for other life stages may be necessary.
Study in young men to determine the UL for leucine. We
tested the same model of determining the UL, as proposed
above, initially in young men (24). Young men (aged ;27 y)
participated in a dose-escalated response study, in which each
subject was initially studied at a leucine intake of 50 mg � kg21 � d21
[because the current leucine Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)
is set at 50 mg � kg21 � d21]. The leucine test doses were then set at
EARs 33, 35, 310, 315, 320, and 325, corresponding to 150,
250, 500, 750, 1000, and 1250 mg � kg21 � d21, respectively, on
separate study days, with each study day separated by $2 wk
(24). The study diets had adequate protein (1.0 g � kg21 � d21),
calories (1.5 times the resting energy expenditure), and all other
nutrients. On each study day, at baseline, and at the end of the
study, blood and urine samples were collected for analysis of
blood and urine biochemistry. Leucine oxidation measured by
using of L-[1-13C]leucine and expressed as label tracer oxidation in
breath (F13CO2) increased with increasing leucine intakes and
reached a plateau at higher intakes. Two-phase linear regression
analysis identified a breakpoint in F13CO2 at a leucine intake of
550 mg � kg21 � d21 (95% CI: 454, 646 mg � kg21 � d21) (24). With
intakes >500 mg � kg21 � d21, blood ammonia concentrations
above normal values (35 mmol/L) with simultaneous and signif-
icant increases in plasma leucine concentrations and urinary
leucine excretion were observed, suggesting that higher intakes
might be harmful. No significant changes were observed for
blood and urine biochemical measures. Although leucine has
been suggested to act as an insulin secretagogue, we did not
observe significant changes in plasma insulin and plasma glucose
due to increasing leucine intakes (24). Taking all of the data
together, 500 mg � kg21 � d–1 was suggested as the UL for leucine
intake under acute dietary conditions (24, 25).
Study in elderly men to determine the UL for leucine.
Whether aging affects the leucine UL and leucine oxidative
capacity was unknown. As stated earlier in this review, Boirie
et al. (19) reported a significantly higher splanchnic extraction of
leucine in elderly individuals compared with young men.
Whether this leads to an adaptation in the metabolic capacity
to dispose of excess amino acids has not been determined. Six
healthy elderly men (aged ;72.2 y) participated in a similar
dose-escalation study (26), with leucine intakes of 150, 250,
350, 450, 550, 650, and 750 mg � kg21 � d21 corresponding to
the EAR and EARs 33, 37, 39, 311, 313, and 315,
respectively, on separate study days. We predicted that there
would be an age-related decline in the ability to dispose of
leucine and therefore decided to increase leucine intake only up
to 750 mg � kg21 � d21. All of the participants were ensured
to be nonsarcopenic and of a healthy mental status (26).
L-[1-13C]Leucine oxidation increased with increasing intakes of
leucine but reached a plateau after 450 mg � kg21 � d21. Two-
phase linear regression analysis identified a breakpoint of
431 mg � kg21 � d21 (95% CI: 351, 511 mg � kg21 � d21) (26).
These values are numerically lower than the previous study in
young men (550 mg � kg21 � d21), although the 95% CIs overlap (24).
Blood ammonia concentrations were significantly above normal
values (35 mmol/L) after leucine intakes of 550 mg � kg21 � d21, and
blood urea concentrations were significantly above normal vales
(2.9–7.5 mmol/L) at leucine intake of 650 mg � kg21 � d21. All other
biochemical and urinary measures remained unaffected due to
increasing leucine intakes. Considering that the 95% CIs overlap
between the 2 breakpoints (previously, young men compared
with elderly men), and the fact that blood ammonia concentrations
(considered an adverse event) were above normal values in the elderly
study only at leucine intakes >550 mg � kg21 � d21, we suggest that the
UL for leucine in elderly men could be set at the same values as for
adult men, at 500 mg � kg21 � d21.
Practical Relevance of the Determined
Leucine UL
On the basis of the 2 studies in adults, it appears that the leucine
UL could be set at 500 mg � kg21 � d21. To relate this value to
habitual leucine intakes, we previously performed an analysis in
strength-trained athletes (24). On the basis of an average
reported protein intake in these athletes of ;2 g � kg21 � d21
(27) and assuming that, on average, the leucine content of food
is ;15%, for an athlete weighing 80 kg the leucine intake from
food would be 300 mg � kg21 � d21. Commonly available
leucine supplements contain 1800 mg/dose, with a recommen-
dation to consume #3 doses/d (28), would lead to 67.5 mg
leucine � kg21 � d21 (for an 80-kg athlete), adding to a total of
;367.5 mg � kg21 � d21. Some supplements are available in even
higher doses of 5 g leucine/dose, with the recommendation to
consume 2 doses to a total of 10 g/d (29). For an athlete weighing
80 kg, this would amount to 125 mg � kg21 � d21; adding this to
the 300 mg � kg21 � d21 from food would lead to a total of 425 mg
leucine � kg21 � d21. In healthy elderly populations, protein and
leucine intakes would be considerably less, as described earlier in
this review. Leucine intakes in the NHANES data suggest ;160 mg
leucine � kg21 � d21 intake from the diet for men aged >70 y. If
combined with a high-dose leucine supplement (10 g/d, or
;143 mg � kg21 � d21 for a 70-kg elderly individual), this
would lead to ;303 mg leucine � kg21 � d21. Thus, it does not
appear that the current food and supplement use pattern in
athletes or healthy elderly individuals would exceed the leucine
UL determined in our studies.
Recently, there were 2 meta-analyses reported for leucine
supplementation studies in the elderly (30, 31). The studies
included in the meta-analysis had leucine doses ranging from 2
to 17 g/d, but with varying lengths of supplementation time
(2 wk to 6 mo). Although the results suggest that there is
potentially some benefit in sarcopenic elderly individuals with

 leucine supplementation, the wide range of doses studied does
not provide any confirmed dose for efficacy. We caution readers
that although our determined UL for leucine is high (500 mg �
kg21 � d21), our studies, as well as most of the reported
supplementation studies, were short term. As shown recently by
Imamura et al. (32), supplementation of leucine in rats with
deficient protein intakes had adverse effects on growth retarda-
tion and showed differences in candidate gene markers from
liver samples. Furthermore, rats fed a high-fat diet with
supplemental BCAAs developed insulin resistance and showed
impaired glucose homeostasis (33). Similar supporting evidence
is available from human studies as well (34), which suggests that
obese individuals have altered adipose tissue BCAA metabolism,
leading to elevated concentrations of plasma leucine, and may
play a role in the development of insulin resistance (33, 35, 36).
In addition, in our short-term studies of leucine supplemen-
tation, plasma isoleucine and valine concentrations were
significantly decreased by the determined UL of 500 mg � kg21 � d21
(24, 26). The effect, known as BCAA antagonism (1), can be quite
restrictive for maintaining muscle mass and needs to be explored
further. Excess leucine and its first breakdown product, a-ketoiso-
caproic acid, can be neurotoxic and has been suggested to increase
oxidative stress (37). Their role in age-related degenerative
disorders needs to be elucidated in future studies. All of the above
need to be considered when conducting future chronic leucine
supplementation studies, especially in the elderly.
Summary
In summary, our earlier study in young men (24) led Cynober
et al. (25) to propose a leucine UL of 500 mg � kg21 � d21. The
results from the recent study in elderly men (26) suggest that
there is a decrease in age-related oxidative ability to dispose of
excess leucine with a breakpoint observed at 431 (95% CI: 351,
511 mg � kg21 � d21), although the 95% CIs overlapped between
the 2 studies and the other marker of leucine excess (blood
ammonia concentrations) did not increase above normal values until
intakes of 550 mg � kg21 � d21. Taking the data together, we predict
that the UL for leucine is not different between young men and
elderly men and suggest that the leucine UL is 500 mg � kg21 � d21,
which is ;35 g/d for an individual weighing 70 kg when consuming
a diet adequate in protein and balanced in calories. The ULs for
leucine studies in humans were acute in nature and perhaps one
additional aspect could be suggested. Similar to the concept of the
DRIs� RDA for amino acids, which is based on the upper 95% CI
and considered to meet 97.5% of the population�s minimum amino
acid requirement, we could also consider the lower 95% CI as the
UL to ensure that nearly all individuals in a population are safe
from excess amino acid intake. Thus, as a cautious estimate, the
leucine UL could also be considered as 351 mg � kg21 � d21, which
would be ;24.5 g/d for an elderly individual weighing 70 kg.
