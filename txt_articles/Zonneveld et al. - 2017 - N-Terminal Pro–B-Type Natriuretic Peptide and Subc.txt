Purpose:
To investigate the association between N-terminal pro–B-
type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which is a marker 
of heart disease, and markers of subclinical brain damage 
on magnetic resonance (MR) images in community-dwell-
ing middle-aged and elderly subjects without dementia 
and without a clinical diagnosis of heart disease.
Materials and 
Methods:
This prospective population-based cohort study was ap-
proved by a medical ethics committee overseen by the 
national government, and all participants gave written 
informed consent. Serum levels of NT-proBNP were mea-
sured in 2397 participants without dementia or stroke 
(mean age, 56.6 years; age range, 45.7–87.3 years) and 
without clinical diagnosis of heart disease who were 
drawn from the population-based Rotterdam Study. All 
participants were examined with a 1.5-T MR imager. Mul-
tivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used 
to investigate the association between NT-proBNP level 
and MR imaging markers of subclinical brain damage, in-
cluding volumetric, focal, and microstructural markers.
Results:
A higher NT-proBNP level was associated with smaller 
total brain volume (mean difference in z score per stan-
dard deviation increase in NT-proBNP level, 20.021; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 20.034, 20.007; P = .003) and 
was predominantly driven by gray matter volume (mean 
difference in z score per standard deviation increase in 
NT-proBNP level, 20.037; 95% CI: 20.057, 20.017; P 
, .001). Higher NT-proBNP level was associated with 
larger white matter lesion volume (mean difference in z 
score per standard deviation increase in NT-proBNP level, 
0.090; 95% CI: 0.051, 0.129; P , .001), with lower frac-
tional anisotropy (mean difference in z score per standard 
deviation increase in NT-proBNP level, 20.048; 95% CI: 
20.088, 20.008; P = .019) and higher mean diffusivity 
(mean difference in z score per standard deviation in-
crease in NT-proBNP level, 0.054; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.091; 
P = .004) of normal-appearing white matter.
Conclusion:
In community-dwelling persons, higher serum NT-proBNP 
levels are associated with volumetric and microstructural 
MR imaging markers of subclinical brain damage.

random subset had serum samples col-
lected around the time of MR imaging 
(median interval, 21 days; interquartile 
range, 13–39 days). NT-proBNP was 
measured between 2006 and 2009 in 
2824 participants who underwent brain 
MR imaging. We excluded participants 
with prevalent clinical stroke (n = 34); 
those with prevalent dementia based 
on a three-step protocol described in 
detail previously (16); those in whom 
screening was insufficient to deter-
mine if the subject had dementia (n = 
35); those with prevalent overt heart 
disease, including a clinical diagnosis of 
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or coro-
nary heart disease (17) (n = 146); those 
with insufficient follow-up data for overt 
heart disease (n = 56); and those with 
an NT-proBNP level higher than the age-
specific heart failure limit (54 pmol/L 
in patients younger than 50 years; 108 
pmol/L in patients aged 50–75 years; 
216 pmol/L in patients older than 75 
years) (18) (n = 3) to be able to explore 
the association between NT-proBNP and 
brain disease in a subclinical population. 
Furthermore, we excluded participants 
with inadequate MR image quality (n 
= 88) or cortical brain infarcts on MR 
images (n = 55). In total, 2397 partic-
ipants were included for analysis (Fig 
E1 [online]). The Rotterdam Study has 
been approved by the medical ethics 
determinants of subclinical brain dam-
age. Recently, interest in the heart-brain 
link has been increasing (5). Several clin-
ical studies have related coronary heart 
disease, heart failure, and atrial fibril-
lation to an increased risk of dementia 
and stroke (6–9). Interestingly, cardiac 
function may already be impaired in a 
preclinical stage.
Cardiac dysfunction can be eval-
uated by using serum levels of amino-
terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP), which is a biomarker 
released in response to myocardial 
wall stress and excreted by the kidneys 
(10). NT-proBNP yields information on 
cardiac dysfunction and overload even 
in the absence of overt heart disease; 
therefore, it could serve as a marker 
of subclinical cardiac dysfunction (11). 
Although few studies have related NT-
proBNP with dementia and stroke 
(12,13), the association between NT-
proBNP with the entire spectrum of 
imaging markers of subclinical brain 
damage remains to be elucidated.
Linking these two entities would yield 
more insight into the heart-brain link, 
which is essential since both cardiac 
dysfunction and subclinical brain dam-
age are growing problems in the aging 
population. Thus, in the current study, 
we aimed to investigate the associa-
tion between NT-proBNP and imaging 
markers of subclinical brain damage on 
MR images in community-dwelling mid-
dle-aged or elderly people who did not 
have dementia or clinical diagnosis of 
heart disease.

Study Population
This study was conducted within the 
Rotterdam Study, an ongoing prospec-

living in the geographically defined Om-
moord district in Rotterdam, the Neth-
erlands. The cohort originated in 1990 
and comprised 7983 participants aged 
at least 55 years. In 2000 and 2006, 
the cohort was expanded and now com-
prises 14 
926 participants aged at least 
45 years (14). Brain MR imaging was 
implemented from 2005 on (15), and a

Advances in Knowledge
 
n In the general population, sub-
clinical cardiac dysfunction, as 
reflected by higher serum N-ter-
minal pro–B-type natriuretic pep-
tide (NT-proBNP) levels, is asso-
ciated with global MR imaging 
markers of subclinical brain 
damage (difference in standard-
ized total brain volume per stan-
dard deviation increase in NT-
proBNP level,20.021; P = .003), 
driven by gray matter volume 
(difference in standardized gray 
matter volume per standard devi-
ation increase in NT-proBNP 
level, 20.037; P , .001), and 
white matter lesion (WML) 
volume (difference in standard-
ized WML volume per standard 
deviation increase in NT-proBNP 
level, 0.090; P , .001).
 
n We showed that serum NT-
proBNP levels are associated 
with microstructural MR imaging 
markers of subclinical brain 
damage (difference in standard-
ized fractional anisotropy per 
standard deviation increase in 
NT-proBNP, 20.048; P = .019; 
difference in standardized mean 
diffusivity per standard deviation 
increase in NT-proBNP, 0.054;  
P = .004).
A
bout 44 million people world-
wide are living with dementia, 
and every year about 15 million 
people have a stroke (1,2). The social 
and economic burden of these diseases 
is increasingly enormously due to the 
rapidly aging population. A common 
substrate between dementia and stroke 
is the presence of subclinical brain 
damage, which is partly affected by 
vascular damage (3). Subclinical brain 
damage can be assessed noninvasively 
with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 
as volumetric (smaller brain volumes), 
focal (presence of lacunae and micro-
bleeds), and microstructural (poorer 
organization of the white matter) 
measures (4).
In the past few decades, research 
has been conducted to identify the

participants’ home, during a physical 
examination by a research nurse at the 
research center, and via blood sam-
pling. Body mass index was calculated 
by dividing weight (in kilograms) by 
height squared (in meters). Systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (in millimeters 
of mercury) was measured twice with a 
random-zero sphygmomanometer, and 
the average of the two measurements 
was used. Serum glucose, total cho-
lesterol, and high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels (all in millimoles per 
liter) were measured with standard lab-
oratory techniques. Diabetes mellitus 
was defined as a fasting serum glucose 
level of at least 7.0 mmol/L, a non-
fasting serum glucose level of at least 
11.1 mmol/L, or use of antidiabetic 
medication. Smoking habits were as-
sessed in an interview, and participants 
were categorized as current smokers, 
former smokers, and those who had 
never smoked. Information on use of 
antihypertensive medication and lipid-
lowering medication was obtained in 
an interview. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
genotyping was performed for coded 
genomic DNA samples. APOE ´4 car-
rier status was defined as a person who 
carried one or two ´4 alleles. Estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 
calculated on the basis of creatinine 
level by using the chronic kidney disease 
epidemiology collaboration formula. 
Cerebral blood flow was measured in 
2294 of 2297 (99.9%) participants and 
was calculated from the phase-contrast 
images with custom software (Cinetool 
version 4; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, 
Wis), as described previously (25). To-
tal cerebral blood flow was determined 
by adding flow rates for the carotid 
arteries and the basilar artery and was 
expressed in milliliters per minute (25). 
This method, which is similar to flow 
measurement methods described pre-
viously, has been validated extensively 
(26).
Statistical Analyses
NT-proBNP level (in picomoles per li-
ter) was first natural log transformed 
and then was modeled continuously per 
standard deviation increase. WML vol-
ume was natural log transformed and 
According to our study protocol, all im-
ages were rated by a group of trained 
reviewers to determine the presence 
and location of cortical infarcts, lacunar 
infarcts, and microbleeds. This group 
of trained reviewers consisted of re-
searchers with doctor of medicine–level 
training or training in academic neuro-
psychology (15,22) (Appendix E1 [on-
line]). Lacunae were rated visually as 
focal lesions at least 3 mm and less than 
15 mm in size, with the same signal in-
tensity as that of cerebrospinal fluid for 
all sequences and a hyperintense rim 
on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
images (when located supratentori-
ally) (23). Infarcts showing involvement 
of gray matter were classified as cor-
tical infarcts. Microbleeds were rated 
as small focal areas of signal intensity 
loss on three-dimensional T2* gradient-
echo images (23). Intra- and interrater 
observer reliability testing has been 
performed for all focal measures, as 
described previously (15,22).
All diffusion data were prepro-
cessed with a standardized pipeline, 
including correction for motion and 
eddy currents. Subsequently, the dif-
fusion tensor was estimated, and the 
diffusion-tensor imaging data were 
registered to the tissue segmentation 
to obtain global mean diffusion-tensor 
imaging measures in normal-appearing 
white matter. These measures included 
fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, 
axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity 
(24). In general, lower fractional an-
isotropy and higher mean diffusivity are 
indicative of poorer microstructural or-
ganization of the white matter.
Volumetric 
measures 
comprised 
total brain, gray matter, white mat-
ter, and WML volume. Focal measures 
comprised lacunar infarcts and mi-
crobleeds. Microstructural measures 
comprised fractional anisotropy and 
mean diffusivity in normal-appearing 
white matter. Figure 1 shows an over-
view of all measures of subclinical brain 
damage.
Covariates
Information on cardiovascular determi-
nants was obtained during a structured 
interview by a research nurse at the 
committee in accordance with the Popu-
lation Study Act Rotterdam Study exe-
cuted by the Ministry of Health, Welfare 
and Sports of the Netherlands. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all 
participants.
NT-proBNP Measurement
Blood samples for NT-proBNP assess-
ment were collected in glass tubes con-
taining clot activator and gel for serum 
separation and were stored at 280°C. 
NT-proBNP level was determined by us-
ing a commercially available electroche-
miluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys 
proBNP; F Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland) and an Elecsys 2010 an-
alyzer (19). Precision, analytic sensi-
tivity, and stability of the system have 
been described elsewhere (20).
MR Imaging
Brain MR imaging was performed with 
a 1.5-T MR imager (Signa Excite II; GE 
Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) and an 
eight-channel head coil. In short, the 
following sequences were performed: 
T1-weighted imaging, proton density–
weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated in-
version recovery imaging, three-dimen-
sional T2* gradient-echo imaging, and 
diffusion-tensor imaging (15). More 
details are provided in Appendix E1 
(online).
Markers of Subclinical Brain Damage
Automated tissue segmentation, includ-
ing the conventional k-nearest neighbor 
brain tissue classifier extended with 
white matter lesion (WML) segmen-
tation, was used to segment the brain 
into gray matter, white matter, WML, 
and cerebrospinal fluid (21). Total brain 
volume was defined as the sum of gray 
matter and white matter. White matter 
was a summation of normal-appearing 
white matter and WML. Intracranial 
volume (excluding the cerebellum with 
surrounding cerebrospinal fluid) was 
estimated by summing the total gray 
and white matter volume and cere-
brospinal fluid volume. The automated 
tissue segmentation method has been 
evaluated extensively, and the accu-
racy is close to the interobserver var-
iability of manual segmentations (21).

measures were also adjusted for in-
tracranial volume. Gray matter volume 
and white matter volume were adjusted 
for each other in analyses. Microstruc-
tural measures were adjusted for in-
tracranial volume, normal-appearing 
white matter, and WML volume.
Also, to compare the magnitude of 
the association of age as a well-known 
risk factor for subclinical brain damage, 
we calculated the effect estimates for 
the association of age with MR imaging 
markers of subclinical brain damage. 
Then, we divided the b values of NT-
proBNP (per standard deviation) by the 
b value of age in relation to markers of 
subclinical brain disease and reported 
the corresponding ratios.
we performed analyses by categories of 
lacune and microbleed count, assigning 
participants as having no (reference 
category) lacunae or microbleeds, one 
lacuna or microbleed, or two or more 
lacunae or microbleeds. We performed 
all analyses in two models. In the first 
model, we adjusted for age, age2, and 
sex. In the second model, we further 
adjusted for body mass index, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, total and 
high-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol 
level, diabetes mellitus, smoking, an-
tihypertensive and lipid-lowering med-
ication, and APOE ´4 carrier status to 
minimize confounding by cardiovas-
cular disease based on biologic plau-
sibility. Analyses involving volumetric 
was investigated continuously. Lacu-
nae and microbleeds were investigated 
dichotomously (present vs absent). 
Volumetric measures and diffusion-
tensor imaging measures were z-stan-
dardized (subtracting the mean and 
dividing by the standard deviation). 
 
We used multivariable linear regres-
sion models to obtain mean differences 
in total brain volume, gray matter vol-
ume, white matter volume, WML vol-
umes, and diffusion-tensor imaging 
measures for every standard deviation 
increase in NT-proBNP. Logistic re-
gression models were used to calculate 
odds ratios to investigate the associ-
ation of NT-proBNP with presence of 
lacunae and microbleeds. In addition,

Table 3 shows the association be-
tween NT-proBNP level and MR im-
aging markers of subclinical brain 
disease. In model 1, higher NT-proBNP 
level was associated with smaller to-
tal brain volume (mean difference in z 
score per standard deviation increase 
in NT-proBNP level, 20.021; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 20.034, 20.007; 
P = .003) and is driven predominantly 
by smaller gray matter volume (mean 
difference in z score per standard de-
viation increase in NT-proBNP level, 
20.037; 95% CI: 20.057, 20.017; P 
, .001) and less by white matter vol-
ume. In model 1, higher NT-proBNP 
level was associated with larger WML 
volume (mean difference in z score 
per standard deviation increase in NT-
proBNP level: 0.090; 95% CI: 0.051, 
0.129; P , .001), with lower fractional 
anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity 
in the white matter (Table 3, Table E1 
[online]). No associations were found 
between NT-proBNP level and lacunae 
or cerebral microbleeds. Estimates 
threshold for significance of P , 5.1 
3 1023. All analyses were performed 
with statistical software (SPSS, version 
21.0.0.1; SPSS).
Results
Characteristics of the study population 
are presented in Table 1. Of the 2397 
participants, 57.5% were women (mean 
age, 56.6 years; age range, 45.7–87.3 
years). Median NT-proBNP level was 
5.37 pmol/L (interquartile range, 3.09–
9.43 pmol/L). Mean total brain volume, 
gray matter volume, and white matter 
volume were 963 mL 6 98, 540 mL 
6 53, and 423 mL 6 57, respectively. 
Median WML volume was 2.0 mL (in-
terquartile range, 1.3–3.4 mL). In total, 
3.0% of the participants had at least 
one lacuna, and 11.5% had at least one 
microbleed. Mean fractional anisotropy 
was 0.34 (range, 0.25–0.39), and mean 
diffusivity was 0.73 31023 mm2/sec 
(range, [0.67–0.87] 31023 mm2/sec) 
(Table 2).
In sensitivity analyses, we addition-
ally adjusted for eGFR because partici-
pants with renal insufficiency may have 
had higher NT-proBNP levels. Also, we 
adjusted for total cerebral blood flow 
as a marker of cerebral perfusion. Fur-
thermore, we computed tertiles of NT-
proBNP and compared the highest ter-
tile to the lowest tertile, and we studied 
linear trends of NT-proBNP in relation 
to markers of subclinical brain damage. 
To investigate whether the association 
between NT-proBNP level and sub-
clinical brain damage was modified by 
sex, we tested the interaction by add-
ing an interaction term to the regres-
sion models. When evaluating linearity 
assumption, there was no departure 
from linearity for the linear regression 
models (normal distribution of resid-
uals) or the logistic regression models 
(goodness-of-fit statistics). We correct-
ed the P value (a = .05) for multiple 
comparisons by using the Sidák cor-
rection after we estimated the number 
of independent tests, resulting in a

had a larger WML volume, and had 
poorer microstructural organization of 
the normal-appearing white matter, 
independent of potential confounding 
variables. Our findings imply that the 
heart and brain are intimately linked, 
even in presumably healthy individuals.
Although several studies have shown 
cardiac dysfunction is associated with 
stroke and dementia, only a few stud-
ies have addressed the link between 
NT-proBNP level and markers of sub-
clinical brain damage. We found that 
higher NT-proBNP level was associated 
with smaller total brain volume and 
gray matter volume, a finding that was 
in line with findings of the Age Gene/
Environment 
Susceptibility-Reykjavik 
Study on community-dwelling elderly 
persons (27). A study of Framingham 
offspring who had not experienced a 
stroke found no association between 
B-type natriuretic peptide level and pa-
renchymal volumes (28). In a study of 
patients with diabetes, NT-proBNP level 
Figure 2 shows the association of 
NT-proBNP level in tertiles with vol-
umetric, focal, and microstructural 
measures (model 2). Participants in the 
highest tertile of NT-proBNP level had 
lower gray matter volume, higher WML 
volume, and higher mean diffusivity of 
normal-appearing white matter com-
pared with those in the lowest tertile (P 
, .05 for all linear trend tests).
There was no difference between 
men and women for the association 
between NT-proBNP level and subclini-
cal brain damage (P . .05 for all inter-
actions) (data not shown).
Discussion
In this population-based study of par-
ticipants without dementia who were 
free of overt cardiovascular disease, we 
found that higher serum NT-proBNP 
level was associated with smaller to-
tal brain volume, was predominantly 
driven by smaller gray matter volume, 
were slightly attenuated by additional 
adjustment for cardiovascular risk 
factors and APOE ´4 carrier status 
(model 2), such that associations with 
total brain volume and mean diffusiv-
ity remained significant but did not 
survive correction for multiple testing 
(Table 3).
When we compared the effect es-
timates of NT-proBNP level in relation 
to markers of subclinical brain damage 
with the estimates for age, we found 
that each 1-standard-deviation increase 
in NT-proBNP level corresponded to a 
1.2-year increase in age for gray matter 
volume, a 1.4-year increase in age for 
WML volume, and a 3.9-year increase 
in age for fractional anisotropy (Table 
E2 [online]).
Furthermore, adjustment for eGFR 
and total cerebral blood flow did not al-
ter any of the aforementioned results 
(Tables E3, E4 [online]).

for tertile 3 (Fig 2 continues).  
was associated with higher WML vol-
ume (29). The Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities Study found that partici-
pants in the highest NT-proBNP quar-
tile had more silent brain infarcts and 
larger WML volume (30). We did not 
find an association between higher NT-
proBNP level and presence of lacunae 
or cerebral microbleeds. This discrep-
ancy may be due to a lack of statistical 
power in our study. Second, presence 
of lacunae and cerebral microbleeds 
may mark more downstream neuropa-
thology or, alternatively, it may mark 
different neuropathology. Third, differ-
ences in ethnicity of study populations 
may yield different cardiovascular risk 
profiles.
The association between NT-proB-
NP level and microstructural MR imag-
ing markers has not been well estab-
lished in the literature. Interestingly, 
NT-proBNP corresponded to larger in-
creases in age for the microstructural 
markers than for the macrostructural 
markers. There is evidence that micro-
structural brain changes precede mac-
rostructural brain changes (eg, white 
matter atrophy, WML); thus, they may 
indicate more subtle brain disease 
(31). White matter microstructure 
has been shown to be of great impor-
tance for cognitive function, gait, and 
basic activities of daily living (4). We 
found that a higher serum NT-proB-
NP level was associated with poorer 
microstructural organization of nor-
mal-appearing white matter and that 
this association was independent of the 
presence of atrophy and WML. This 
suggests that changes in the normal-
appearing white matter organization, 
which are invisible at conventional MR 
imaging, are associated with subclini-
cal cardiac dysfunction. The fact that 
the association between NT-proBNP 
level and white matter macrostructure 
was most pronounced in WML rather 
than white matter volume might sug-
gest different pathophysiologic pro-
cesses that underlie white matter atro-
phy and WML.
Several mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain the link between

cerebral blood flow measurement was 
extensively validated previously, it is 
still rather coarse and may not cancel 
out all variability in brain perfusion. In 
addition, cerebral blood flow measure-
ment is obtained at only one time point; 
thus, it might not be fully representa-
tive of cerebral perfusion.
As a second explanatory mecha-
nism, the brain relies on several hemo-
dynamic parameters, such as cerebral 
autoregulation, including endothelial 
function and cardiac output, to meet 
its metabolic demands (33). There is 
evidence that cardiovascular risk fac-
tors may cause concurrent endothelial 
dysfunction in the heart and brain that 
supporting the concept that cerebral 
hypoperfusion precedes neurodegen-
eration (32). When investigating NT-
proBNP with gray and white matter 
volumes, we observed the strongest 
association with gray matter volume. 
Because gray matter is more metabol-
ically active than white matter, it re-
quires more cerebral blood flow (32). 
Thus, cerebral hypoperfusion may have 
a greater effect on gray matter volume 
than on white matter volume. Inter-
estingly, adjustment for total cerebral 
blood flow as an indicator for cerebral 
perfusion did not alter the associations 
in our analyses. A possible explanation 
for this might be that although our 
cardiac dysfunction and clinical or sub-
clinical brain disease. A direct mecha-
nism by which NT-proBNP itself causes 
brain disease is highly unlikely since 
NT-proBNP is not known to be neu-
rotoxic. Potential indirect mechanisms 
include cerebral hypoperfusion, shared 
cardiovascular risk factors, cardio-
embolic stroke, and ischemia due to 
atherosclerosis.
First, maintaining continuous cere-
bral perfusion is essential for normal 
brain function. Experimental evidence 
from animal studies suggests that ce-
rebral hypoperfusion leads to cerebral 
microvascular 
damage, 
neuropatho-
logic processes, and cognitive decline,

ing a missing link in the pathophysiology of 
may lead to problems in maintaining 
microcirculation and blood-brain bar-
rier function (34). Remarkably, in our 
study, adjustments for cardiovascular 
risk factors did not essentially alter the 
associations. However, we cannot rule 
out the possibility of residual confound-
ing due to an unmeasured (cardiovascu-
lar) risk factor.
Third, cardioembolic stroke from 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is not 
picked up at diagnostic electrocardiog-
raphy also may affect the brain due to 
hemodynamic compromise (35). The 
largest effect was detected for WML 
volume. It has been hypothesized that 
atherosclerosis causes arterial stiff-
ness, which may limit the perfusion of 
the brain and heart. Indeed, on the one 
hand, arterial stiffness has been associ-
ated with markers of brain disease, such 
as larger WML volume, presence of lacu-
nae, and cortical brain atrophy (36,37). 
On the other hand, arterial stiffness 
has been associated with cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality (38). Lastly, it 
has been hypothesized that B-type na-
triuretic peptide is secreted in response 
to systemic inflammatory factors (39). 
Inflammatory factors may damage the 
blood brain barrier, which may cause 
increased 
permeability 
resulting 
in 
WMLs, cerebral microbleeds, and lacu-
nar infarcts (40).
There are also some limitations that 
must be acknowledged. First, ours was 
a cross-sectional study; thus, we could 
not draw conclusions regarding causal-
ity or the direction of the associations. 
However, from a biologic perspective, 
and on the basis of animal studies, it is 
more likely that cardiac dysfunction af-
fects brain changes than vice versa (6). 
Second, our study consisted largely of 
white participants, and this may have 
limited extrapolation of our results to 
patients of other ethnicities.
In conclusion, we found that in 
community-dwelling middle-aged and 
elderly persons, subclinical cardiac dys-
function as reflected by serum NT-proB-
NP levels is associated with global and 
microstructural MR imaging markers of 
subclinical brain damage. Our findings 
suggest that the heart and brain are 
intimately linked, even in presumably
