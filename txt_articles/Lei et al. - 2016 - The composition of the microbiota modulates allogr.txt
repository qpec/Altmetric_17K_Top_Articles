Introduction
Although solid organ transplantation is the only cure for end-stage 
organ failure, recognition of the transplanted tissue as foreign invari-
ably leads, in the absence of immunosuppression, to its acute rejec-
tion in a T cell–dependent manner. The kinetics of graft rejection 
mostly depend on the extent of genetic disparities between the donor 
and the recipient, as allelic differences can result in protein polymor-
phisms recognized by alloreactive host T cells. Whether environmen-
tal factors modulate the intensity of the alloresponse is not clear.
We have previously reported that infections with Listeria mono-
cytogenes or Staphylococcus aureus at the time of transplantation can 
increase alloreactivity and prevent the induction of transplantation 
tolerance by costimulation-blocking agents (1, 2). This led us to 
consider whether more ubiquitous bacteria such as the commensal 
communities that colonize donors and recipients might also modu-
late alloreactivity. Indeed, it is now well established that the micro-
biota can modify local and distal immune responses (3), thus raising 
the possibility that it might fine-tune alloreactivity. Several lines of 
evidence indirectly support this hypothesis. First, organs colonized 
with bacteria such as lung and intestine have poorer outcomes than 
organs considered sterile such as heart and kidney (Organ Procure-
ment and Transplantation Network (OPTN), https:/
/optn.trans-
plant.hrsa.gov/data/; Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients 
(SRTR), http:/
/www.srtr.org/, December 2012). Second, the sur-
vival of minor antigen–mismatched skin grafts is prolonged when 
both donor and recipient lack MyD88-dependent TLR signaling (4), 
although the relative contribution of damage- versus microbe-asso-
ciated molecular patterns has not been elucidated. Third, emerg-
ing clinical literature suggests that acute rejection of intestine and 
lung may be associated with shifts in bacterial composition (5, 6), 
although it is not yet clear whether such shifts are a cause or a conse-
quence of acute rejection. Therefore, direct assessment of the role 
of the microbiota on alloimmunity is needed.
Results
Minor antigen–mismatched skin graft survival was prolonged in anti-
biotic-pretreated mice. To determine the consequence of reduced 
bacterial diversity on allograft outcome, 6- to 8-week-old male 
and female purchased C57BL/6 (B6) mice were left untreated or 
received a daily gavage of antibiotics (Abx) for 10 days. Skin from 
male donors was transplanted onto the flanks of female mice 1 
day later, and recipients did not receive further Abx treatment. 
Abx-pretreated recipients of skin grafts from Abx-pretreated 
donors displayed prolonged skin allograft survival (mean survival 
time [MST] = 53 ± 23 days) compared with controls (MST = 27 ± 
12 days) (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained when com-
paring untreated and Abx-pretreated in-house–bred littermates 
derived from the same maternal lineage to minimize microbiota 
differences between groups prior to treatment (Supplemental 
Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this arti-
cle; doi:10.1172/JCI85295DS1). In contrast, Abx pretreatment of 
Transplantation is the only cure for end-stage organ failure, but without immunosuppression, T cells rapidly reject allografts. 
While genetic disparities between donor and recipient are major determinants of the kinetics of transplant rejection, little 
is known about the contribution of environmental factors. Because colonized organs have worse transplant outcome than 
sterile organs, we tested the influence of host and donor microbiota on skin transplant rejection. Compared with untreated 
conventional mice, pretreatment of donors and recipients with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) or use of germ-free (GF) 
donors and recipients resulted in prolonged survival of minor antigen–mismatched skin grafts. Increased graft survival 
correlated with reduced type I IFN signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and decreased priming of alloreactive T cells. 
Colonization of GF mice with fecal material from untreated conventional mice, but not from Abx-pretreated mice, enhanced 
the ability of APCs to prime alloreactive T cells and accelerated graft rejection, suggesting that alloimmunity is modulated 
by the composition of microbiota rather than the quantity of bacteria. Abx pretreatment of conventional mice also delayed 
rejection of major antigen–mismatched skin and MHC class II–mismatched cardiac allografts. This study demonstrates that 
Abx pretreatment prolongs graft survival, suggesting that targeting microbial constituents is a potential therapeutic strategy 
for enhancing graft acceptance.

microbial communities of fecal and skin samples on day 10 of Abx 
pretreatment clustered separately from those of the control and 
the pretreatment groups (Figure 1E). In particular, Abx-pretreated 
mice had a relative expansion of Lactobacillales in their feces and 
a reduction of Clostridiales in both feces and skin (Supplemental 
Figure 1, B and C). Thus, Abx pretreatment changed the composi-
tion of the microbiota, but not the overall bacterial load.
Minor antigen–mismatched skin allograft survival was prolonged 
in GF mice. As a second approach to testing the role of the microbi-
ota on graft outcome, we used germ-free (GF) mice, devoid of live 
bacteria, and transplanted them in a biological safety cabinet in 
the gnotobiotic facility using sterile techniques (Figure 2A and ref. 
8). GF female recipients of GF male skin transplants also displayed 
prolonged graft survival when compared with specific pathogen–
free (SPF) mice transplanted in a sterile manner (Figure 2B). This 
donors or recipients alone did not delay rejection (Figure 1A), indi-
cating that Abx-induced changes in both the donor skin and the 
recipient mice are required for improved graft survival.
To understand the changes that had occurred in the microbio-
ta prior to transplantation, bacterial DNA was extracted from tail 
skin and fecal samples of female hosts. This Abx regimen in adult 
mice did not reduce overall fecal bacterial burden, as determined 
by qPCR using universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene (Figure 
1B), in contrast with the reduced bacterial load that occurs when 
a similar regimen is started in 2-week-old mice prior to weaning 
(7). However, 10-day Abx pretreatment resulted in significantly 
reduced bacterial richness and diversity on the day of trans-
plantation (Figure 1, C and D) in both fecal and skin samples, as 
determined by 16S rRNA sequencing using the MiSeq platform. 
Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that

(Supplemental Figure 2, A and B), such that whether it is the gut 
and/or skin microbiota that influences skin graft outcome remains 
to be elucidated.
Abx pretreatment resulted in reduced alloimmunity. To investi-
gate whether improved graft survival in Abx-pretreated mice was 
due to reduced alloimmunity, we analyzed graft-infiltrating leu-
kocytes isolated on day 10 after transplantation. Abx pretreatment 
was associated with a reduced percentage of CD4+ T cells and 
fewer IFN-γ–producing cells among them (Figure 3, A–C). To test 
whether the reduced percentage of intragraft effector CD4+ T cells 
was due to diminished expansion of alloreactive T cells, H-Y–spe-
cific CD45.1+ congenic CD4+ TCR/RAG-KO-Tg (Marilyn) T cells 
were CFSE-labeled and adoptively transferred into 10-day–Abx–
pretreated female recipients 1 day prior to transplantation with 
skin grafts from Abx-pretreated male donors. Marilyn T cells iso-
lated 4 days later from the skin graft draining LNs (dLNs), the site 
of initial T cell priming after skin transplantation (11), displayed 
reduced proliferation in Abx-pretreated mice compared with that 
in untreated hosts (Figure 3, D and E). Thus, Abx pretreatment 
triggered reduced priming of graft-reactive T cells, supporting the 
conclusion that the microbiota that associates with SPF B6 mice 
in our colony promotes the activation of alloreactive T cells and/
or that Abx pretreatment promotes a microbial community that 
reduces alloreactivity.
In order to modulate T cell priming, microbial signals might 
directly or indirectly affect T cells, antigen-presenting cells 
was not due to a reduced susceptibility of GF skin to rejection, as 
GF grafts were rejected as promptly as SPF grafts by SPF mice (Fig-
ure 2B). To test the causal role of the microbiota, GF mice received 
a gavage with feces from SPF mice 5 to 7 days prior to transplanta-
tion (GF-SPF.F). Although the microbial communities that estab-
lished in the intestine of GF-SPF.F mice differed from those in the 
donor fecal samples (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B), restoration 
of the microbiota was sufficient to accelerate rejection (Figure 2B), 
indicating that prolonged graft survival in sterile GF mice is due at 
least in part to their lack of microbiota.
To determine whether all microbial communities acceler-
ated graft rejection, GF mice were gavaged with feces from Abx-
pretreated SPF mice (GF-Abx.F) prior to transplantation. In con-
trast with GF-SPF.F mice, GF-Abx.F mice did not display faster 
rejection than GF mice (Figure 2B) and their cecal appearance 
remained enlarged, as is typical of GF mice (ref. 9 and Figure 2C), 
despite a bacterial load close to that in SPF mice (Figure 2D). The 
dysbiosis induced by Abx pretreatment in the fecal donors was 
transferred and remained stably established in GF-Abx.F recipi-
ents that were not exposed to other environmental bacteria, as 
supported by the persistent contraction of Blautia coccoides (for-
merly classified as Clostridium coccoides; ref. 10) and expansion of 
Lactobacillus spp. (Figure 2E), although their total bacterial com-
munities were still distinct from those in the donor fecal samples 
(Supplemental Figure 2, A and B). Interestingly, fecal transfer into 
GF mice not only resulted in intestinal, but also skin colonization

treated mice (Supplemental Figure 3, A–D), with the exception of 
a reduction in CD11b+ DCs. Moreover, expression levels of CD40, 
PDL1, CD80, CD86, ICOSL, OX40L, and I-Ab were similar on 
DCs from Abx-pretreated and control mice (Supplemental Figure 
3E). Thus, Abx treatment reduced the capacity of APCs to prime 
alloreactive T cells. In the gnotobiotic setting, skin dLN APCs 
from male GF and GF-Abx.F mice also induced less prolifera-
tion and IFN-γ production by Marilyn T cells than did APCs from 
SPF or GF-SPF.F mice (Figure 3, H–J). Together, these data argue 
against a direct effect of oral Abx on immune cells or skin grafts 
and suggest instead that Abx-sensitive taxa play a critical role in 
poising skin dLN APCs for alloreactive T cell priming.
Abx treatment downregulates the type I IFN pathway in DCs. 
Since DCs are the main APC subset that activates alloreactive H-Y– 
specific T cells (12), skin dLN CD11c+ DCs were sorted from con-
trol and 10-day–Abx–treated mice for gene expression profiling. 
(APCs), or both. To determine whether the Abx pretreatment 
affected APCs, we isolated T cell– and NK cell–depleted APCs 
from the skin dLNs of Abx-pretreated or control SPF male mice 
and used them to stimulate CFSE-labeled Marilyn T cells from 
naive mice in vitro. APCs from Abx-treated mice stimulated Mari-
lyn T cells less vigorously than control APCs (Figure 3F). Marilyn T 
cell proliferation was also reduced when stimulated with H-Y pep-
tide–pulsed APCs from Abx-pretreated females (Figure 3F) when 
compared with peptide-pulsed APCs from untreated females, 
suggesting that the APC defect is unlikely to be at the antigen-
processing level. Marilyn T cells stimulated with APCs from Abx-
treated mice also produced less IFN-γ (Figure 3G). Differences in 
T cell–priming ability were not due to an alteration in the composi-
tion of skin dLN APCs after Abx treatment, as the proportion of B 
cells, CD11b+ cells, and CD11c+ DCs as well as subsets of CD103+, 
CD8α+, or Siglec-H+ DCs was comparable in control and Abx-

mice can accelerate skin graft rejection after colonization of GF 
mice. This result underscores remarkable differences in the physi-
ological effects of these bacterial communities based on their 
composition rather than their load and suggests that the Abx have 
eliminated species with key microbial products or metabolic func-
tions for the priming of alloreactive T cells or enabled growth of 
inhibitory species. It is important to note that fecal gavage not 
only resulted in established intestinal species in the reconstitut-
ed GF mice, but also in colonization of their skin (Supplemental 
Figure 2A), presumably because the fur is in contact with soiled 
bedding in the gnotobiotic cages. Thus, it is yet unclear whether 
it is the microbial constituents of the intestine or of the skin that 
can promote alloreactivity. Indeed, defined skin commensals 
have recently been shown to modify local cutaneous immunity, 
affecting skin DCs and resident T cells and enhancing barrier 
immunity (13). The intestinal microbiota have also been shown 
to affect immunity as distal as the peripheral joints or the central 
nervous system in models of autoimmune arthritis or autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (14, 15).
Gene expression profiling of DCs isolated from the LNs of 
Abx-pretreated mice revealed reduced expression of genes in the 
NF-κB and type I IFN pathways. These pathways have been pre-
viously associated with transplant rejection, as NF-κB inhibition 
in DCs with decoy oligodeoxyribonucleotides has been shown to 
promote allograft survival (16). Similarly, type I IFN therapy has 
been associated with liver rejection in the clinic (17), and viral 
and bacterial infections that induce a type I IFN response were 
reported to prevent the induction of transplantation tolerance 
(18–20). Peritoneal and splenic mononuclear phagocytes have 
been shown to require signals from the microbiota to elicit NK 
cell priming and antiviral immunity, including expression of type I 
IFN genes, and to promote an activating epigenetic transcriptional 
landscape for cytokine production (21, 22). Recent work from our 
group has identified select bacterial species within the Bifidobac-
DCs from Abx-treated mice displayed reduced expression of genes 
associated with the type I IFN pathway, such as IRF3, IRF7, OAS2, 
OAS1G, OASL1, and OASL2, as well as of genes related to activa-
tion of the NF-κB pathway, such as RSAD2, SPHK1, and IRAK2. 
In addition, genes involved in cytokine regulation and production 
were also significantly less expressed in DCs from Abx-treated than 
control mice (Figure 4, A and B). In keeping with this gene profil-
ing analysis, survival of type I Ifnar-deficient male skin grafts was 
significantly prolonged in type I Ifnar-deficient females when com-
pared with control mice (Figure 4C), supporting a role for type I IFN 
signaling in the response to H-Y+ skin grafts. IFN-αR expression had 
to be absent in both donor and recipient mice for graft survival to 
be prolonged (not shown). Notably, Abx pretreatment of Ifnar-defi-
cient mice did not prolong survival compared with untreated coun-
terparts; they were all rejected within 50 days (not shown), further 
suggesting that the effects of Abx pretreatment were dependent at 
least in part on a reduction of the type I IFN pathway.
Abx pretreatment also prolongs survival of major antigen–mis-
matched skin and MHC class II–mismatched cardiac allografts. It was 
conceivable that the effects of the microbiota on graft outcome 
were limited to the H-Y skin graft mouse model or applicable only 
to transplantation of colonized organs. To this end, donor and 
recipient mice were pretreated with Abx prior to transplantation 
of BALB/c skin or Bm12 heart into B6 animals. Abx pretreatment 
resulted in a significant delay in graft rejection in both models 
(Figure 5, A and B), arguing for a more generalizable effect of the 
microbiota on allograft rejection.
Discussion
Collectively, our results suggest that Abx pretreatment reduces the 
priming capacity of alloreactive T cells by skin dLN APCs, in part 
by impairing activation of the type I IFN pathway.
Our study demonstrates that bacterial communities existing 
in the fecal samples of untreated, but not Abx-pretreated, SPF

terium genus capable of inducing the type I IFN pathway in DCs, 
resulting in improved tumor control (23). Our results indicate 
that the microbiota and type I IFN signaling promote rejection of 
H-Y+ skin grafts and that Abx may eliminate bacterial species that 
normally poise skin dLN APCs for stimulation of alloreactive T 
cells or favor outgrowth of species that do not activate the type I 
IFN pathway in skin dLN APCs. Finally, the APC-poising effects 
are rapidly reversible, suggesting a continuous dialogue between 
the micro 
biota and the immune system, as APCs from SPF mice 
can lose their priming function upon a 10-day Abx treatment and 
APCs from GF mice can regain it upon 5- to 7-day exposure to fecal 
microbiota from control SPF but not Abx-pretreated mice.
These studies raise the question of which microbial-associat-
ed molecular patterns may be responsible for signaling to the skin 
dLN APCs to prepare them to stimulate T cells. The more exten-
sive survival of male skin grafts by female hosts observed when 
both male donors and female recipients are deficient in MyD88 
KO (4) compared with the effects of Abx pretreatment in our study 
suggests the possibility that both microbial and sterile inflam-
mation ligands additively induce MyD88-dependent signaling 
following H-Y skin transplantation. Indeed, damage-associated 
molecules such as haptoglobin have been shown to contribute to 
the rejection of male skin grafts in a MyD88-dependent manner, 
with skin grafts from haptoglobin-deficient mice eliciting slower 
acute rejection than control skin grafts (24). In contrast, whether 
the prorejection effects of the microbiota are MyD88 dependent 
or not remains to be investigated. The fact that Abx pretreatment 
resulted in prolonged survival of fully MHC-mismatched alloge-
neic skin grafts in our study whereas rejection kinetics of major 
antigen–mismatched skin grafts were unmodified compared with 
controls when both donors and recipients lacked MyD88 (25) sug-
gests that the microbiota may exert at least some of its effects in 
a MyD88-independent manner. Many pattern-recognition recep-
tors can recognize microbial molecular patterns and signal in a 
MyD88-independent manner (26), including TLR3 and TLR4, 
NOD-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and sensors of intra-
cellular DNA and RNA. Moreover, the microbiota can elaborate 
metabolic products that may have local or distal immune effects 
independently of the expression of pattern-recognition receptors. 
For instance, Clostridia can generate short-chain fatty acids that 
have been shown to promote intestinal Treg differentiation (7, 
 
27–30). Thus, the microbial products capable of promoting 
allograft rejection and the sensors that recognize them need to 
be identified. In addition, whether immune cells are directly tar-
geted by such microbial products or whether DCs are poised by 
signals elicited by intermediary cells such as mucosal or epider-
mal cells will need to be established. Our observation that Abx 
pretreatment can prolong survival of cardiac allografts, which are 
considered sterile, demonstrates distal effects of the microbiota, 
further suggesting that microbes, their products, or the local cells 
they instruct presumably circulate to sites of priming or effector 
function of alloreactive T cells. It is conceivable that incisions to 
the skin for any kind of surgery, including cardiac transplantation, 
may allow some cutaneous bacteria to enter the bloodstream and 
signal at distant sites and/or that intestinal bacterial translocation 
during open abdominal surgery, as occurs in our model of het-
erotopic cardiac transplantation, may contribute to the enhanced 
alloimmunity observed in colonized compared with GF animals. 
Indeed, portal endotoxin has been detected after abdominal sur-
gery that did not involve intestinal sectioning (31).
The demonstration that the microbiota is an important envi-
ronmental factor that continuously modulates the activation state 
of skin dLN APCs and their ability to prime alloreactive T cells 
points to the control of the composition of the microbiota as a 
potential therapeutic target to improve transplant outcomes.
Methods
Mice. Six-week-old SPF C57BL/6NHsd male and female mice were 
purchased from Envigo or bred in house. B6(C)-H2-Ab1bm12/KhEgJ 
female mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. CD45.1+ 
Rag2-knockout (RAG-KO) Marilyn B6 mice whose CD4+ T cells are 
specific for an H-Y antigen (32) were obtained from Charles Main-
hart via Taconic Biosciences and bred in house under SPF conditions. 
Ifnar-KO mice were maintained in the University of Chicago animal 
facility. B6 GF mice were kept in plastic isolators at the University of 
Chicago’s Gnotobiotic Research Animal Facility and were fed auto-
claved food and water. Fecal aerobic and anaerobic cultures were car-
ried out weekly to ensure the absence of microbial colonization.

Abx treatment. Eight-week-old B6 mice that had been cohoused to 
equilibrate their microbiota were divided into control and Abx treat-
ment cages. Mice in Abx treatment cages received a daily gavage with 
200 μl of Abx based on a previous report (7) containing gentamycin 
(0.35 mg/ml, Fresenius Kabi), kanamycin (5.25 mg/ml, Gibco, Ther-
mo Fisher Scientific), colistin (8500 U, RPI), metronidazole (2.15 mg/
ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and vancomycin (0.5 mg/ml, Hospira) diluted in 
autoclaved water. Abx were administered by daily gavage rather than 
in the drinking water to ensure accurate dosing. Donor and recipient 
mice were treated for 10 days until the time of transplantation.
Transplantation. For aseptic surgery for SPF mice, tail skin from 
male B6 or from BALB/c donor mice was transplanted onto the flank 
of female recipients. Bandages were removed after 7 days. Graft 
survival was monitored every other day, and the day at which less 
than 20% of viable skin tissue was left was called the day of rejec-
tion. For sterile surgery for gnotobiotic and SPF mice, sterile surgical 
techniques in a biological safety cabinet as previously described (8) 
were used. Bm12 hearts were transplanted into B6 mice as previously 
described (33). Because this is a chronic rejection model (34), clini-
cal graft functional scores adapted from Tanaka et al. (35) were cal-
culated as follows: heart size (small = 1, large = 0), speed of heartbeat 
(too fast to count = 3, 100–200 beats/min = 2, <100 beats/min = 1, 
heartbeat cessation = 0).
Leukocyte isolation. Spleen, or skin dLN (inguinal, axillary, and 
brachial) cells were isolated at the indicated times, resuspended 
in complete DMEM (Corning) with 10%FBS, 1% penicillin/strep-
tomycin, 1% l-glutamine, 1% NEAA, 1% HEPES, and 0.028 mM 
β-mercaptoethanol, and counted using a Countess cell counter. For 
skin leukocyte isolation, skin grafts or shaved flank was harvested. 
The skin was cut into small pieces, resuspended in RPMI (Corning) 
medium supplemented with Liberase (0.4 mg/ml, Roche) and DNAse 
(0.01%, MP Biomedicals), and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. After 
incubation, the skin was homogenized using a 70-μm cell strainer, a 
petri dish, and a syringe plunger. Single-cell suspensions were cen-
trifuged, and pellets were resuspended in complete RPMI medium 
before cells were counted.
In vitro stimulation of graft-infiltrating cells. Isolated graft-infil-
trating cells (5 × 106) were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates. PMA 
(50 ng/ml), ionomycin (0.5 μg/ml), and brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) were 
added into each well, and cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C 
in 8% CO2. Stimulated cells were harvested for staining and flow 
cytometry analysis.
CFSE labeling. CD45.1+ RAG-KO CD4+ Marilyn T cells were col-
lected from peripheral LNs and spleen. Red blood cells in spleens were 
lysed with ACK lysis buffer for 5 minutes. Cells from LNs and spleen 
were combined, counted, and resuspended at a concentration of 
 
20 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM. CFSE (C34554, Life Technolo-
gies) was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μM and incubated with 
cells for 10 minutes at 37°C. Labeling was stopped with an equal vol-
ume of fetal bovine serum. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended 
in complete DMEM. For adoptive transfer, the cells were washed and 
resuspended in 1× PBS.
Adoptive transfer of Marilyn T cells. CFSE-labeled CD45.1+ RAG-
KO CD4 Marilyn T cells (1 × 106) were transferred i.v. into B6 mice 
 
1 day prior to skin transplantation. At day 4 after transplantation, skin 
dLNs (brachial and axillary) were harvested and isolated leukocytes 
stained to assess T cell proliferation.
Ex vivo stimulation of Marilyn T cells. APCs were isolated from skin 
dLNs of male or female B6 mice following magnetic enrichment with 
biotinylated anti-Thy1.2 (53-2.1, eBioscience) and anti-NK1.1 (Frank 
W. Fitch Monoclonal Antibody Facility, University of Chicago) anti-
bodies. Marilyn T cells were magnetically enriched from the periph-
eral LNs and spleens of Marilyn mice using streptavidin magnetic 
beads (catalog 88817, Pierce), anti–Ter119-biotin (TER-119, eBiosci-
ence), anti–CD11b-biotin (M1/70, eBioscience), and anti–NK1.1-bio-
tin (PK136, Frank W. Fitch Monoclonal Antibody Facility at the Uni-
versity of Chicago) prior to CFSE labeling. APCs (1–2 × 105/well) were 
cultured in triplicate with Marilyn T cells (1 × 105/well) in complete 
DMEM for 3 days. T cells were restimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) and 
ionomycin (0.5 μg/ml) in the presence of brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) for 
 
4 hours at 37°C and analyzed by flow cytometry. For stimulation with 
female APCs, the culture was supplemented with 1 to 20 pM of CD4 
H-Y peptide (NAGFNSNRANSSRSS), which was synthesized by Joel 
Collier (University of Chicago).
Flow cytometry. All cells were stained with 1:1000 Live Aqua Live/
Dead stain (Life Technologies) prior to phenotypic staining. For graft-
infiltrating cell analyses, cells were stained with anti–CD45.2-APC 
(104, eBioscience), anti–TCR-β–PerCP Cy5.5 (H57597, eBioscience), 
anti–CD4-PE-Cy7 (RM4-5, eBioscience), anti–CD8α-eF450 (53-6.7, 
 
eBioscience), and anti–TCR-γδ–PE (eBioGL3, eBioscience). For 
cell population analyses, cells were stained with anti–CD45.2-APC 
(104, eBioscience), anti–TCR-β–PerCP Cy5.5 (H57597, eBioscience), 
anti–CD19-FITC (eBio1D3, eBioscience), anti–CD4-BV605 (RM4-5, 
BioLegend), anti–CD8α-BV711 (53-6.7, BioLegend), anti–NK1.1-PE 
(PK136, BD Biosciences — Pharmingen), anti–CD11c-PECy7 (N418, 
eBioscience), anti–CD11b-APC-Cy7 (M1/70, eBioscience), and 
anti–Gr-1–AF700 (RB6-8C5, eBioscience). For adoptive transfer and 
in vitro stimulation analyses, cultured cells were stained with anti–
CD45.1-APC-eF780 (A20, eBioscience), anti–CD45.2-APC (104, 
eBioscience), anti–TCR-β–PerCP–Cy5.5 (H57597, eBioscience), anti–
CD4-PE-Cy7 (RM4-5, eBioscience), and anti–IFN-γ–PE (XMG1.2, 
eBioscience). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were fixed with 
1% formaldehyde for a 10-minute incubation at 37°C, followed by cold 
1× PBS and methanol treatment overnight. Fixed and permeabilized 
cells were stained with antibodies. All samples were analyzed with the 
LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences).
Fecal reconstitution. Fresh fecal pellets from untreated or Abx-
treated female mice were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile PBS. GF mice 
were reconstituted by oral gavage with 200 μl of such suspension 5 to 
7 days before skin transplantation. The status of fecal and cutaneous 
colonization was analyzed at different time points using quantitative 
PCR (qPCR) for bacterial load and presence of select bacterial taxa.
DNA extraction. Fecal samples were homogenized with 0.1 mm 
zirconia/silica beads in 1.4 ml ASL buffer (51504, QIAGEN) in a Mini-
Beadbeater (Biospec). DNA was extracted with the QIAamp DNA 
Stool Mini Kit (51504, QIAGEN). Tail skin samples were incubated in 
enzymatic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 1.2% Triton X-100, 
pH 8.0) and lysozyme (20 mg/ml) for 3 hours at 37°C. Standard pro-
tocols for DNA purification of MasterPure Yeast DNA Purification Kit 
(MPY80200, Epicentre Biotechnologies) and QIAamp DNA Stool 
Mini Kit (51504, QIAGEN) were followed for all subsequent steps.
16S rRNA gene sequencing and data analysis. 16S rRNA genes were 
amplified from purified DNA using PCR primers (F515/R806) spe-
cific for the V4–V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene and sequenced by

(DAVID; NIH) v6.7 for pathway analysis. Genes that were significantly 
enriched in the pathway analysis (P < 0.05) were chosen and plotted in 
a heat map using R. All original microarray data were deposited in the 
NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE80487).
Statistics. Graft survival curves were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
plots and log-rank post hoc tests. Comparisons between control and 
Abx samples for Shannon index, T cell populations, Marilyn T cell divi-
sion, and cytokine production were analyzed with 2-tailed unpaired 
t test. Analysis of DC subsets and costimulatory molecules was per-
formed with 2-way ANOVA. Multiple comparisons among control Abx, 
GF, GF-SPF.F, and GF-Abx.F samples were done with 1-way ANOVA, 
together with Bonferroni’s comparison. P values of less than 0.05 were 
considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using Graphpad Prism 6.
Study approval. Mouse studies were approved by the Animal 
Resources Center of the University of Chicago under IACUC guidelines 
(protocol 71095) and according to the NIH guidelines for animal use.

Illumina MiSeq at the High-Throughput Genome Analysis Core in the 
Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois, USA), using previ-
ously described sequencing primers (36). Quantitative Insights Into 
Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software (37) was used for de novo opera-
tional taxonomic unit (OTU) selection (with 97% identity threshold), 
rarefaction, and taxonomic classification. Microbial communities 
were compared using the unweighted UniFrac distance metric (38) 
and were displayed using PCA plots. The data were uploaded to the 
European Nucleotide Archive (ENA PRJEB13722).
qPCR for bacterial load and taxa assays. Bacterial load of extracted 
fecal DNA was determined by qPCR with the universal primers 8F and 
338R for the 16S rRNA gene, using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad 
Life Science) and the 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosys-
tems). DNA was quantified against a standard curve as described (7), 
and the results were normalized to the weight of fecal samples. For 
taxa assays, the following primers were used: B. coccoides, forward, 
5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGC-3′, 
reverse, 
5′-GCTTCTTAGT-
CAGGTACCGTCAT-3′; Lactobacillus spp., forward, 5′-AGCAG-
TAGGGAATCTTCCA-3′, reverse, 5′-CACCGCTACACATGGAG-3′. 
Data acquisition and analysis were done using iQ SYBR Green Super-
mix (Bio-Rad Life Science) and the 7300 Real-Time PCR system 
(Applied Biosystems).
Gene array of DCs. The inguinal, brachial, and axillary LNs were 
minced with a razor blade, treated with 400 U of Collagenase IV 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% DNase (MP Biomedicals), and incubated 
at 37°C for 30 minutes, followed by homogenization with a syringe 
plunger and 40-μM filters. Cells were stained with 1:1000 Live Aqua 
LIVE/DEAD stain (Life Technologies), anti–NK1.1-BV421 (PK136, 
BioLegend), anti–CD19-BV421 (6D5, BioLegend), anti–TCRβ-BV421 
(H57-597, BD Horizon), and anti–I-Ab-PE (AF6-120.1, BD Biosciences 
— Pharmingen) and sorted into RLT buffer (QIAGEN) using the BD 
FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). DCs were sorted in RLT buffer from 
the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was isolated according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol and analyzed at the University of Chi-
cago Genomics Core facility. RNA integrity and concentration were 
assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. RNA with an RNA integrity 
number greater than 9.0 was processed into cRNA and hybridized to 
the Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 array using the manufacturer’s proto-
col and scanned in Illumina HiScan. Quantile normalized and back-
ground-subtracted values were analyzed using R version 3.2.0. Genes 
with an expression value under 25 were removed from the analysis. 
Mean fold change in expression level between control and Abx DCs 
was calculated. Genes with a fold change of 1.5 were analyzed on the 
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
