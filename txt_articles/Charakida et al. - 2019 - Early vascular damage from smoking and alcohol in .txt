Aims
To determine the impact of smoking and alcohol exposure during adolescence on arterial stiffness at
17 years.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Smoking and alcohol use were assessed by questionnaires at 13, 15, and 17 years in 1266 participants (425 males
and 841 females) from the ALSPAC study. Smoking status (smokers and non-smoker) and intensity (‘high’ >
_100,
‘moderate’ 20–99, and ‘low or never’ <20 cigarettes in lifetime) were ascertained. Participants were classified by
frequency (low or high) and intensity of drinking [light (LI <2), medium (MI 3–9), and heavy (HI >10 drinks on a
typical drinking day)]. Carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed at 17 years [mean ± standard
deviation and/or mean difference (95% confidence intervals)]. Current smokers had higher PWV compared with
non-smokers (P = 0.003). Higher smoking exposure was associated with higher PWV compared with non-smokers
[5.81 ± 0.725 vs. 5.71 ± 0.677 m/s, mean adjusted difference 0.211 (0.087–0.334) m/s, P = 0.001]. Participants who
stopped smoking had similar PWV to never smokers (P = 0.160). High-intensity drinkers had increased PWV [HI
5.85 ± 0.8 vs. LI 5.67 ± 0.604 m/s, mean adjusted difference 0.266 (0.055–0.476) m/s, P = 0.013]. There was an addi-
tive effect of smoking intensity and alcohol intensity, so that ‘high’ smokers who were also HI drinkers had higher
PWV compared with never-smokers and LI drinkers [mean adjusted increase 0.603 (0.229–0.978) m/s, P = 0.002].
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Smoking exposure even at low levels and intensity of alcohol use were associated individually and together with
increased arterial stiffness. Public health strategies need to prevent adoption of these habits in adolescence to pre-
serve or restore arterial health.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking and consumption of alcohol are associated with
increased cardiovascular (CV) risk in adult life.1,2 Smokers are twice
as likely to suffer a myocardial infarction compared with people who
have never smoked. For alcohol, a J-shaped association has been
reported, with CV benefit for those consuming small or moderate
amount of alcohol daily. This has however been questioned in recent
studies,3 which showed that higher intake or binge drinking are asso-
ciated with increased CV morbidity and mortality4.
Most adult users of alcohol or tobacco first start in their early
teens.5,6 In the United States, each day approximately 6000 adoles-
cents, aged 12–18 years, smoke a cigarette for the first time, and
3000 adolescents become daily smokers.7 A large body of research
suggests that adolescents who participate in one health-risk behav-
iour are more likely to engage in additional risk behaviours.7
According to the Center of Disease Classification (CDC), 75% of
high school students report drinking alcoholic beverages at least
once.7 The early impact of unhealthy behaviours on contemporary
arterial disease is not well documented.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children was estab-
lished in 1991 to provide environmental information on participants
from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood and to study
the impact on their health (http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk).8 The cohort
has been followed with questionnaires through childhood and at
regular annual clinics since age of 7 years. Detailed information about
alcohol and smoking is available for participants through adolescence
from questionnaires, and vascular phenotyping was performed at age
17years. This provided a unique opportunity to assess the impact of
exposure to these substances on arterial phenotype and CV risk fac-
tor profile in young adulthood.
Methods
Vascular study population
We studied adolescents who attended the ALSPAC clinics in Bristol at
17years (Figure 1). The study was approved by the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
T
obacco use in adolescence
Information about tobacco use was obtained from questionnaires at ages
13, 15, and 17years. Participants were classified as smokers or no-
smokers at each period. Smoking exposure over the 5-year period was
assessed. Participants who stopped smoking were also identified.
Numbers of cigarettes smoked over lifetime were assessed by ques-
tionnaire at 17years and participants were classified in three groups to
reflect smoking intensity: ‘high’ (>
_100 cigarettes), moderate (20–99 ciga-
rettes), and low/never smokers (<20 cigarettes). Cotinine levels were
not measured. Exposure to parental smoking (passive smoking) was also
assessed by questionnaires.
Alcohol consumption in adolescence
Information about alcohol consumption was obtained from question-
naires at the ages of 13, 15, and 17years, and participants were classified
as drinkers or non-drinkers at each period. At 17years, more detailed in-
formation about patterns of alcohol use was obtained. The participants
were asked to report the age when they started drinking alcohol, fre-
quency of alcohol consumption/month, and intensity of alcohol consump-
tion (number of drinks on a typical drinking day, with one drink equating
to 8 g of alcohol). Heavy (HI), medium (MI), and light (LI) intensity

drinkers were defined as subjects consuming >10 drinks, 3–9 drinks, and
< 2 drinks, respectively on a typical day that they were drinking alcohol.
Preferences for different beverages (i.e. beer, wine, and spirits) were eval-
uated at 17years by questionnaires, which assessed the number of each
of the aforementioned drinks consumed. Participants were classified as
never, light, moderate and heavy beer, wine or spirit-drinking if they
reported no consumption or consumption of 1–5, 6–20, and over 20
drinks in the last 30days.
Aortic stiffness
Pressure-pulse waveforms were obtained using the Vicorder device by
placing a 100 mm wide blood pressure cuff around the upper thigh to
measure the femoral pulse pressure, and a 30mm partial cuff around the
neck at the level of the carotid artery. To measure carotid to femoral
pulse wave velocity (PWV), high quality waveforms were recorded
simultaneously for 3 s with the subject in the supine position, and the
foot-to-foot transit time was determined using an in-built cross-correl-
ation algorithm centred around the peak of the second derivative of
pressure. All measurements were performed independently by one of
two trained vascular technicians [inter-observer mean difference (stand-
ard deviation of difference) 0.2 (0.1) m/s].
Cardiovascular risk factors (confounders and
mediators)
Three seated right arm blood pressure measurements were made
(Omron 705 IT oscillometric BP monitor) after a 10min rest and the
mean of the last two were analysed. Simultaneous heart rate was meas-
ured. Waist circumference, weight, and height were measured, and body
mass index (BMI) was calculated. At 17years, fasting blood samples were
taken; all samples were immediately centrifuged and stored at -80�C for
lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), triglycerides], inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein
(CRP)], and liver function tests.9 Socioeconomic status (SES) was desig-
nated from 1 to 5 according to National Readership Survey (NRS) grad-
ing criteria based on father’s occupation, with Class 5 denoting unskilled
workers
(http://www.nrs.co.uk/nrs-print/lifestyle-and-classification-data/
social-grade). Physical activity (PA) was assessed by actigraph accelerom-
eter at 15years. Time spent in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) such as
cycling, swimming, and running was calculated, the cut-point being four
times resting metabolic rate (equivalent to brisk walking). Minutes of
MVPA was calculated as the average minutes of such activity/valid day of
measurement.
Statistical analysis
Standard analytical approaches to normally and non-normally distributed
measures were used and values are expressed as mean ± standard devi-
ation and median (interquartile range), respectively. Categorical variables
are expressed as N, percentage. Unadjusted comparisons for continuous
variables between groups of interest were performed using analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with a test for linear trend carried out across pre-
specified categories. Categorical variables were compared using the v2
test. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess the
association between smoking, alcohol and CV risk factors, and PWV.
Numeric estimates for comparisons of interest are provided as mean dif-
ference in PWV along with 95% confidence intervals around the mean dif-
ference. Multivariable models were built through an unbiased method of
a priori variable selection, based on previous medical literature and con-
ventional knowledge with adjustment for established CV risk factors and
exposure to variables previously associated with increased PWV
(Supplementary material online). An interaction effect between gender
and smoking/alcohol consumption behaviour was tested as well as a
potential additive or multiplicative adverse effect of combination of bad
behaviours on PWV at 17years (Supplementary material online).
To assess smoking and alcohol exposure across the range of 13–
17years, adolescents with complete questionnaires for smoking behav-
iour and alcohol consumption were included in longitudinal analyses
(Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2).
We replaced missing data for all variables of interest by multiple imput-
ation using the MCMC method.10 Variables with <5% missing values
were not imputed. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA pack-
age, version 11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). We deemed
statistical significance at alpha= 0.05.
Results
Participant characteristics
There was no difference in either smoking or alcohol use between
males and females (Table 1). At 17 years, 23.8% of participants were
smokers. One hundred and fifty-four (14.2%) participants drank 0–2
drinks/typical day, 822 (75.6%) 3–9/typical day, and 111 (10.2%) >10
drinks/typical day. Seven hundred and twenty-four (66.6%) partici-
pants were classified as low-frequency drinkers [10 never drinkers,
203 monthly or less, 511 (2–4 times/month), and 363 (33.4%)] and
were high-frequency drinkers (316 drank 2–3 times/week and 47
drank >
_4 times/week).
Smoking rates (P = 0.012) but not alcohol consumption (P = 0.130)
in adolescence increased progressively from social Class I (high sta-
tus) to V (manual unskilled). Parental smoking was associated with
smoking in adolescence (P = 0.046). Physical activity did not differ
across smoking and drinking intensity groups. Participants with higher
alcohol intensity had increased weight but normal BMI, increased TC
and mildly deranged liver function (Table 1). Following adjustment,
drinking intensity was still related to increased ALT (P = 0.014).
Patterns of smoking behaviour during
adolescence and arterial stiffness
Current smokers had increased arterial stiffness compared with non-
smokers [mean difference 0.176 (0.058–0.293) m/s, P = 0.003].
Number of cigarettes smoked over lifetime (smoking intensity) was
positively associated with PWV, with ‘high’ intensity smokers having
higher PWV compared with low/never-smokers [5.81± 0.725 vs.
5.71± 0.677 m/s, mean difference 0.104 (0.01–0.199) m/s, P = 0.032].
This association remained after adjustment for other CV risk factors
[mean increase in PWV for high smokers 3.7% or 0.211 (0.087–
0.334) m/s, P = 0.001 compared with low/never smokers] (Table 2)
and passive smoking (P = 0.004). Following imputation for missing val-
ues in covariates of interest [i.e. low-density lipoprotein (LDL), CRP,
family history of coronary artery disease (CAD), physical activity, and
passive smoking], the association of smoking intensity, and increased
PWV remained significant [mean increase 0.122 (0.032–0.212),
P = 0.008]. There was no interaction (Pfor interaction = 0.308) between
gender and smoking exposure on vascular profile.
Of 661 participants with measurements of smoking status at 13,
15, and 17 years, longitudinal analysis indicated that never smokers
(n = 269) had lower PWV at 17 years compared with those who had
been smoking since 13 years [-0.313 (-0.01 to -0.618) m/s, P = 0.044]
and to current smokers (i.e. at 17 years) [-0.196 (-0.034 to -0.357)

m/s, P = 0.018]. The longitudinal effect of smoking across the period
of 13–17years on PWV was consistent across categories of
increased duration [mean increase in PWV 0.143 (0.047–0.239) m/s
per category, Pfor linear trend= 0.004] (Figure 2) and when adjusted for
passive smoking [mean increase in PWV 0.211 (0.083–0.340) m/s per
category, Pfor
linear trend = 0.002] compared with never smokers
(Table 2). Subjects (n = 91) who smoked between 13 and 17 years
but who subsequently stopped, had comparable PWV with never
smokers [mean difference -0.152 (-0.364 to 0.06), P = 0.160]. Finally,
when missing values for longitudinal smoking status as well as for con-
founders were imputed, the association of increased duration of
smoking with PWV at 17 years remained significant [mean expected
increase 0.047 (0.01–0.089) m/s per category, P = 0.027] after
adjustment. Adolescents who smoked since 13 or 15 years, pre-
sented an adjusted increase of 0.157 (0.01–0.308) m/s in PWV com-
pared with participants who had never smoked (P = 0.042)
(n = 1225) (Table 2).
Patterns of alcohol consumption during
adolescence and arterial stiffness
There was no association between age of starting drinking alcohol or
frequency of drinking and PWV, whereas HI drinking was associated
with increased PWV [HI 5.85± 0.8 vs. LI 5.67± 0.604 m/s, mean dif-
ference 0.182 (0.019–0.346) m/s, P = 0.029]. This association
remained after adjustment for CV risk factors [relative mean increase
4.7% or 0.266 (0.055–0.476) m/s, P = 0.013] (Table 2). Complete ana-
lysis for imputed observations of drinking intensity at 17 years and
additional exposure variables, including physical activity, revealed a
similar association with increased PWV (P = 0.048) but additional ad-
justment for family history of CAD and parental smoking attenuated
this effect (P = 0.059). There was no interaction between gender and
alcohol consumption (P = 0.230). Increased drinking intensity as a
proxy to binge drinking (>
_10 drinks/typical drinking day) correlated
with increased arterial stiffness [5.85± 0.8 vs. 5.7± 0.625 m/s, mean
increase 0.147 (0.016–0.279), P = 0.028], even after controlling for
gender, SBP, SES, LDL, BMI, CRP [mean increase 0.231 (0.057–0.405)
m/s, P = 0.01]. In longitudinal analysis, drinking intensity was not asso-
ciated with PWV (P > 0.05 for all categories) (Table 2).
Over a month period, adolescents consumed more beer than
wine (P < 0.001) with no difference between consumption of beer-
and spirit-based drinks (P = 0.426). Three hundred twenty-seven
(26.7%) adolescents did not drink beer while 414 (33.8%), 371
(30.3%), and 112 (9.15%) were light, moderate, and heavy beer-
drinkers. Almost half of participants, 558 (46.5%) did not consume
wine, 458 (38.2%), 158 (13.16%), and 26 (2.17%) were light, moder-
ate, and heavy wine-drinkers, respectively. Finally, 264 (21.48%) par-
ticipants abstained from spirits in the last month, while 518 (42.14%),
372 (30.27%), and 75 (6.1%) adolescents were light, moderate, and
heavy spirit-drinkers. Light and moderate wine drinking were associ-

5.77± 0.684 m/s for no consumption, P = 0.02 and P = 0.008, respect-
ively). Moderate and heavy consumption of beer were related to
increased PWV (5.66± 0.672 m/s for moderate and 5.79± 0.690 m/s
for heavy vs. 5.62± 0.597 m/s for non-consumers, P = 0.001 and
P < 0.001, respectively) when compared with non-consumption.
However, these associations lost their significance following adjust-
ment for confounding exposure variables (P > 0.05 for all categories).
Spirit drinking pattern was not associated with arterial stiffness at
17years.
Higher alcohol intensity and smoking intensity had additive effects
on arterial stiffness [high alcohol and smoking vs. never smokers and
low alcohol; 5.89± 0.857 vs. 5.61± 0.589, mean increase 0.277
(0.028–0.525) m/s, P = 0.029] compared with never smoking and low
alcohol consumption. After adjustment, the combined index of
alcohol and smoking intensity remained an independent predictor of
PWV [mean increase 10.8% or 0.603 (0.229–0.978) m/s in PWV,
for adolescents with both high alcohol and smoking vs. never smok-
ers and low alcohol, P = 0.002] (Table 2) (Figure 3). The association
of the combined index of alcohol and smoking intensity with
increased PWV remained significant after additional adjustment for
parental smoking (P < 0.001) or imputation for missing values in con-
founders at 17 years [mean increase 0.331 (0.094–0.568) m/s,
P = 0.006] (Table 2). There was a non-multiplicative combined effect
of these unfavourable behaviours for the vascular profile of adoles-
cents (P for interaction> 0.1 in both unadjusted and adjusted models,
likelihood ratio test P > 0.1 for the addition of the interaction terms
smoking*drinking intensity over the core model).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that smoking and alcohol use up to age
17 years have both independent and additive associations with arter-
ial stiffness, a marker of vascular damage that predicts later CV dis-
ease and events. Smoking in youth, even at low levels, was associated
with increased arterial stiffness, but stopping during adolescence
could restore arterial health. In addition, patterns of alcohol use had a
significant impact on arterial stiffness with higher intensity, rather
than frequency of consumption, showing the greatest adverse effect
on PWV. These data demonstrate the importance of public health
measures, which focus on preventing the establishment of unhealthy
behaviours in children and adolescents.
Impact of smoking and excessive alcohol use on adverse CV out-
comes in adults is well established.11,12 While most adult users of al-
cohol or tobacco first tried these ‘drugs’ during their early teens, the
impact of smoking and alcohol consumption on the atherosclerotic
process at this early stage of the life course is less clear. To evaluate
the development of early atherosclerosis, we measured carotid to
femoral PWV in a well-characterized cohort of 17year olds. Previous
studies have demonstrated that PWV is reproducible and, in adults,
predicts CV outcomes independently from conventional risk
factors.13

Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that acute
and chronic cigarette use adversely affects vascular health in adult-
hood and promotes atherosclerosis progression.14 We quantified ex-
posure to cigarettes during adolescence and also assessed smoking
frequency. Both current cigarette use and chronic smoking exposure
had an adverse effect on arterial stiffness. This finding is consistent
with reports in adults which show that the longer and earlier a person
starts smoking, the higher the incidence of coronary artery disease
and hypertension and the worse the impact on life expectancy.15
Passive smoking has consistently been shown to adversely affect ar-
terial health in the young, however, no association with aortic stiff-
ness in adolescence was demonstrated in our cohort.16 Exposure to
parental smoking at home was assessed as binary variable, which pre-
cluded evaluation of potential differences in the degree in passive
smoking.
The pathophysiological mechanisms linking smoking to vascular
disease are still not fully elucidated.17,18 Tobacco contains many toxic
and vasoactive compounds, which can exert damage on vascular
endothelium and can activate inflammatory and thrombotic pathways
relevant to CV events.17 Although cigarette smoking is discouraged
in many countries with legislation and other initiatives, our findings
confirm that smoking continues to be prevalent in adolescence in
both genders in the UK. It was interesting that only a small percentage
of our cohort was in the highest smoking category of >100 cigarettes
in total. This is considerably less exposure than that of typical adult
smokers, in whom life time exposure is measured in pack-years (�20
cigarettes/day for 1 year). These data are consistent with a recent
NHS survey, which demonstrated that the number of children trying
cigarettes has fallen by three quarters since 2003. However, even at
these low levels of smoking exposure, we could detect an adverse ef-
fect on arterial stiffness even when adjusted for other CV risk factors.
Quitting smoking in adolescence could restore aortic stiffness,
emphasizing the benefit and opportunity from implementing inter-
ventional and educational strategies in the young to preserve arterial
health consistent with the recent European CV prevention
guidelines.12
There are conflicting findings on the impact of alcohol consump-
tion on atherosclerosis. Alcohol intake has been shown to prevent
atherosclerosis in some animal studies, but not in all,19,20 and results
from clinical studies are also inconsistent.21,22 High alcohol intake
(>34 g/day) is associated with higher blood pressure, but observa-
tional evidence does not support an association of alcohol intake
Take home figure Unhealthy behaviours in adolescents (drinking and cigarette smoking) are associated with increased carotid to femoral pulse
wave velocity (stiffer arteries) and accelerated atherosclerosis. Stopping smoking in adolescence and reducing binge drinking has potential for revers-
ibility of arterial stiffening.

with blood pressure below this level.23 Mild alcohol consumption
(<
_2 alcoholic beverages/day), can independently improve endothelial
function both in young healthy subjects and in those with Type 2 dia-
betes.24 In contrast, a Finnish study reported a direct linear adverse
effect of alcohol consumption on carotid intima media thickness in
the young, from as little as two alcoholic drinks per day.25 In support
of this, a recent Mendelian randomization meta-analysis implicated al-
cohol consumption as a causal factor for CV disease.11
We used a combination of frequency and intensity questionnaires
to describe better patterns of alcohol use. The age at which partici-
pants started consuming alcohol was not associated with vascular
stiffness, suggesting that duration of exposure might not be that im-
portant at this young age, and this was confirmed in our longitudinal
analysis. In contrast, higher intensity rather than frequency of alcohol
consumption had the greatest adverse relationship with arterial stiff-
ness. This finding is of particular concern since excessive drinking,
with the aim of getting drunk, is increasingly the norm for
teenagers.26
The mechanistic link between alcohol and arterial stiffness is not
well explored. Light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated
with an increase in HDL-C, a decrease in inflammatory mediators
and improvement in metabolic pathways.27,28 In contrast, excess al-
cohol consumption has been associated with elevation in blood pres-
sure, autonomic dysregulation, and derangements in coagulation and
fibrinolytic pathways.27 We did not find any beneficial effect of alco-
hol consumption on arterial stiffness even at lower consumption lev-
els. When we separated different alcoholic beverages, light and
moderate wine drinking groups and moderate to heavy beer drinkers
were associated with lower and higher PWV, respectively when
compared with non-consumers. However, these associations were
not significant in multivariable analysis, implying that drinking intensity
rather than type of alcoholic beverage may be more important. The
association between alcohol use and CV risk factors was modest and
only mild derangements in liver function tests were noted in partici-
pants with high alcohol intensity.29 Interestingly, lower heart rate was
noticed in adolescents with high drinking intensity and this might rep-
resent autonomic dysregulation.30
Our study has limitations as it is observational, so that causal asso-
ciations between smoking, alcohol exposure, and arterial stiffness
cannot be established. We relied on self-reported confidential ques-
tionnaires, collected every 2 years through adolescence, without any
biomarker-based assessment of smoking or alcohol exposure.
Although self-report of smoking and alcohol behaviour has been
shown to be a valid measure compared with biochemical measures,
we cannot exclude the possibility that some of our participants may
have been misclassified, particularly those from the heavier exposure
categories. This however, would be likely to result in underestima-
tion of the effect sizes observed. The presence of unmeasured or re-
sidual confounders on our results cannot be excluded. In addition, a
number of missing data were imputed in order not to reduce the
power of our multivariable longitudinal analysis. This is a well-estab-
lished statistical approach. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, we
were able to demonstrate important associations between patterns
of smoking and drinking use in adolescence with arterial stiffness.
In summary, in this large contemporary British cohort of adoles-
cents, we have demonstrated that drinking intensity and smoking in
adolescence, even at lower levels compared with those reported in
adult studies, is associated with arterial changes relevant to athero-
sclerosis progression. The effect of these unhealthy behaviours was
independent of one another and additive. Smoking cessation in ado-
lescence was associated with normalization of aortic stiffness. These
findings have significant public health implications and provide further
support for public health measures to discourage young adults adopt-
ing smoking and drinking habits and the benefit of discontinuing these
unhealthy behaviours.
