SUMMARY
Metabolic production of acetyl-CoA is linked to histone acetylation and gene regulation, yet the 
precise mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we show that the metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA 
synthetase 2 (ACSS2) is a direct regulator of histone acetylation in neurons and of spatial memory 
in mammals. In a neuronal cell culture model, ACSS2 increases in nuclei of differentiating 
neurons and localizes to upregulated neuronal genes near elevated histone acetylation. Reduction 
of ACSS2 lowers nuclear acetyl-CoA levels, histone acetylation, and responsive expression of the 
cohort of neuronal genes. In adult mice, attenuation of hippocampal ACSS2 expression impairs 
long-term spatial memory, a cognitive process reliant on histone acetylation. ACSS2 reduction in 
hippocampus also leads to defective upregulation of memory-related neuronal genes that are pre-
bound by ACSS2. These results reveal a unique connection between cellular metabolism, gene 
regulation, and neural plasticity, establishing a link between acetyl-CoA generation “on-site” at 
chromatin for histone acetylation and the transcription of critical neuronal genes.

 INTRODUCTION
Memory formation involves synaptic restructuring and requires the coordinated expression 
of neuronal genes via poorly understood processes that modify chromatin1,2. Histone 
acetylation has emerged as a key regulator of memory storage, and restructures chromatin in 
distinct brain regions implicated in learning and memory, most prominently in the 
hippocampus3. Critical to hippocampal memory consolidation are the transcription factor 
CREB and the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP), specifically the histone 
acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CBP4,5. Further, inhibitors of histone deacetylases 
enhance memory consolidation3. However, comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms 
that regulate neuronal histone acetylation in long-term memory remains elusive.
Direct sensing of intermediary metabolites by chromatin-modifying enzymes such as 
acetyltransferases can dynamically adapt chromatin structure and gene expression6,7. 
Altering pools of intracellular acetyl-CoA manipulates histone acetylation8,9, and thus, 
metabolic enzymes generating nuclear acetyl-CoA may directly control histone acetylation 
and gene expression10,11. In mammalian cells, there are two principal enzymes that generate 
acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation: acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) and 
citrate-dependent ATP-citrate lyase (ACL)11. The relative importance of ACSS2 vs. ACL for 
nuclear histone acetylation differs by tissue type, developmental state, and disease9,11; yet 
the roles for these enzymes in post-mitotic neuronal cells is unknown.
The observation that ACSS2 is highly expressed in mouse hippocampus12 led us to 
investigate ACSS2 in neuronal histone acetylation and gene expression. Our findings support 
a critical function of neuronal ACSS2 in linking acetate metabolism to neuronal gene 
regulation via direct chromatin binding of ACSS2, and identify a prominent role of this 
mechanism in hippocampal memory consolidation.
RESULTS
ACSS2 regulates neuronal gene expression
We investigated a neuronal function of ACSS2 using the Cath.-a-differentiated (CAD) cell 
line derived from mouse catecholaminergic cells. Upon serum deprivation, CAD cells 
differentiate to form neuronal processes and become excitable, similar to functional 
neurons13. We examined subcellular localization by immunofluorescence, finding that 
endogenous ACSS2 was primarily cytoplasmic in undifferentiated CAD cells (Fig. 1a), and, 
upon differentiation, shifted primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a). 
Whole cell and nuclear levels of ACSS2 increased upon CAD neuronal differentiation, 
contrasting with constant cytoplasmic ACL expression (Fig. 1c). In primary hippocampal 
and cortical neurons from mouse brain, even 14 days after isolation, ACSS2 was chiefly 
nuclear and ACL was primarily cytoplasmic (Extended Data Fig. 1c–f). We conclude that 
ACSS2, in contrast to ACL, is localized to nuclei during neuronal differentiation.
We investigated ACSS2 in upregulation of canonical neuron-specific protein markers in 
differentiated CAD neurons. Pre-differentiation ACSS2 knockdown (KD) lowered 
differentiation-linked expression of nuclear NeuN, the activity-regulated Nr4a2, and of

 cytoplasmic markers Synaptophysin, Map2 and Snap25, without associated decrease of ACL 
(Extended Data Fig. 1g), indicating a key ACSS2 role in neuronal differentiation.
Transcriptome analysis via mRNA-seq upon CAD neuronal differentiation identified 894 
upregulated genes (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c; Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis revealed that these differentiation-linked genes are neuron specific; GO terms 
included neuron differentiation, synaptic transmission, ion transport, and neuron projection 
morphogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 3e). We built a protein interaction framework that 
produced a neuronal network centered on activity-dependent signaling and synaptic 
plasticity: Calm1 (Calmodulin 1), Grin1, and Itpr1 (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Calm1 mediates 
Ca2+ control of neuronal proteins in synaptic plasticity, including Ca2+/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Such Ca2+ signaling is regulated by Grin1, an 
NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate-gated ion channels, and further by the ion channel 
Itpr1 which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ stores, an important process in activity-dependent 
signaling that underlies synaptic plasticity during learning.
The metabolite acetyl-CoA is required by HAT enzymes for histone acetylation. To 
investigate histone acetylation during CAD neuronal differentiation, we performed 
chromatin immunoprecipitation-high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) for histone 
H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac), H4K5ac, and H4K12ac (see Methods for details). All 
marks were enriched upon differentiation at upregulated neuronal genes, for example, at 
Nudix-Type Motif 1 (Nudt1) (Extended Fig. 2f). Overall, the 894 upregulated neuronal 
genes displayed higher acetylation compared to all other genes (Extended Data Fig. 2g).
We reduced ACSS2 or ACL using short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) prior to cell differentiation 
and performed RNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 2h–k). Neuronal genes lost induction in the 
ACSS2 KD (pearson r = 0.15; Fig. 1d–e), while these same genes retained strong correlation 
in transcriptional fold change in the ACL KD (pearson r = 0.53; Extended Fig. 1l). We 
stratified the top 10% upregulated genes in WT cell differentiation into quintiles (Fig. 1i), 
revealing that ACSS2 KD strongly lowered upregulation across all quintiles (Fig. 1i: green 
bars; p = 7.2*10−252, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The ACL KD showed the same upward trend 
as WT, contrasting the severe defect in ACSS2 KD (Extended Data Fig. 2m; p = 1.1*10−25, 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Of interest, the ACL KD showed lower global transcript levels (p 
= 1.91e-07, Mann-Whitney U test), different from the ACSS2 KD that showed a less severe 
defect genome-wide (Extended Data Fig. 2n, p = 0.04, Mann-Whitney U test). ACL thus has 
a broad but non-specific effect on gene expression, whereas ACSS2 is required for 
upregulation of the neuronal gene expression program upon CAD neuron differentiation.
Further, we tested the requirement for ACSS2 catalytic activity using a small molecule 
specific inhibitor of ACSS2 (ACSS2i)14. RNA-seq showed reduction of differentiation-
induced genes (Fig. 1g), and the genes reduced by ACSS2 KD were also highly sensitive to 
the ACSS2i (Extended Data Fig. 2o, p = 1.62E-6).
ACSS2 is recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin
We investigated direct association of ACSS2 with chromatin via ChIP-seq upon CAD 
neuron differentiation (see Methods for details). Two ACSS2 antibodies showed high

 correlation both for MACS overlapping peaks (spearman r = 0.82; Extended Data Fig. 3a), 
and for global enrichment over 1kb genomic windows (spearman r = 0.73; Extended Data 
Fig. 3b). Binding of ACSS2 correlated with increases in histone H3K9ac, H4K5ac, and 
H4K12ac in differentiated relative to undifferentiated CAD neurons, for instance at 
promoters of Nudt1 and TAK1-Binding Protein 2 (TAB2; Extended Data Fig. 3c–d). Both 
genes have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders: the Nudt1 hydrolase oxidizes purine 
nucleoside triphosphates to prevent RNA incorporation, and TAB2 regulates signal 
transduction pathways in neurons15. Gene Ontology (GO) showed that genes proximal to 
ACSS2 peaks link to neuronal differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Hence chromatin-
associated, neuronal gene promoter-proximal ACSS2 may provide a local source of acetyl-
CoA to HAT enzymes.
We examined ACSS2 binding relative to histone acetylation, finding that 80% of ACSS2 
peaks upstream of the nearest target gene overlapped an acetylation peak or have an 
acetylation peak downstream towards the targeted TSS (Extended Data Fig. 3f–g). A 
substantial number – 13–15% of all ACSS2 peaks genome-wide – directly overlapped peaks 
of H3 and H4 acetylation (Extended Data Fig. 3h). Also, ACSS2 peak height positively 
correlated overall with intersected histone acetylation peaks (Extended Data Fig. 3i–k). Peak 
height correlation suggests that H4 acetylation may be most responsive to ACSS2-derived 
acetyl-CoA, in particular H4K12ac, a mark that has been linked to defective memory 
formation during aging16. In general, the most enriched ACSS2 peaks displayed strongest 
histone acetylation enrichment (Extended Data Fig. 3l–n).
We investigated putative recruitment of ACSS2 via transcription factor binding using de 
novo motif discovery over ACSS2 ChIP-seq peaks, which revealed binding sequences 
predicted for neuronal transcription factors. The most enriched motif was Yin Yang1 (YY1) 
(Extended Data Fig. 3o; YY1, p = 1e-599) which recruits the two acetyl-CoA-dependent 
HAT enzymes CREB-binding protein (CBP) and E1A binding protein (p300)17, consistent 
with ACSS2 fueling nearby catalytic HAT activity.
Initial peak analysis did not identify all ACSS2/acetylation enriched peaks (Extended Data 
Fig. 4a–b), hence we analyzed gene body enrichment and found additional prominent 
examples, such as Camk2a (Fig. 2a) encoding calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
type II alpha chain, required for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial 
learning; ACSS2/acetylation co-occupancy profiles at Camk2a were similar to Nudt1 
(Extended Data Fig. 3c). Meta-gene analysis indicated that the top 5% ACSS2-enriched 
genes had acetylation up to three-fold higher than the mean across all genes (Extended Data 
Fig. 5a–d), and genes with greatest fold-change in differential ACSS2 binding had the 
highest histone acetylation levels (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 5e–h). GO term enrichment 
showed the top ACSS2-bound/acetylated genes are neuron-specific (Fig. 2b).
At all induced genes, ACSS2 binding was concomitant with increased histone acetylation 
(Extended Data Fig. 3p), and the 299 genes reduced upon ACSS2i treatment corresponded 
to the greatest gains of differentiation-linked histone acetylation (Fig. 2d). In total, about 9% 
of genes previously linked to neuronal differentiation (ND genes, AmiGO annotation set of 
1,315 genes) were induced in the CAD cell differentiation, and these induced genes were

 exceptionally sensitive to ACSS2i treatment (Fig. 2e, ‘Induced’ left side). Moreover, while 
the entire ND gene class did not change expression in CAD differentiation, they markedly 
lost expression upon ACSS2i treatment (Fig. 2e, ‘ND’ right side). We visualized the 
interaction between differentiation-linked gene expression changes and ACSS2 recruitment 
to chromatin using multiple linear regression analysis, and found a remarkable relationship 
between higher ACSS2 enrichment (red) and increased gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 
5i). Overall, the CAD cell genomic data demonstrate dynamic ACSS2 enrichment in 
differentiated neurons linked to increased histone acetylation and involvement in 
transcriptional upregulation of neuronal genes.
ACSS2 functions in neuronal histone acetylation
We assayed nuclear acetyl-CoA levels in the ACSS2 KD (Fig. 2f; mean Δ = −0.19 ± 0.03, p 
= 0.003) and also with ACSS2i treatment (Fig. 2f; mean Δ = −0.25 ± 0.05, p = 0.006), 
finding comparably decreased acetyl-CoA levels. This supported a role of ACSS2 enzymatic 
activity in supplying nuclear acetyl-CoA. Global histone acetylation levels of transcription-
linked H3K27ac and H3K9ac were reduced in the ACSS2 KD (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 
6a), and these are key substrates of CBP and p300 with roles in hippocampal LTP and long-
term memory18. ACSS2 co-immunoprecipitated acetylated chromatin, specifically H3K9ac, 
H3K27ac, and H4K12ac (Extended Data Fig. 6b), and also CBP (Fig. 2h), suggesting a 
mechanism for chromatin-binding of ACSS2 at transcriptionally active genes to increase 
histone acetylation during memory formation in vivo4,5,18.
We examined ACSS2 in primary mouse hippocampal (HPC) neurons, given their capacity 
for depolarization and expression of key neuronal genes functioning in memory. ACSS2 was 
nuclear localized (Fig. 2i), and ACSS2i treatment reduced neuronal marker expression and 
histone acetylation, without lowering ACSS2 levels (Fig. 2j, Extended Data Fig. 6c). ACL 
did not change (Fig. 2j), indicating that ACL is less important in regulation of histone 
acetylation in HPC neurons.
We investigated chromatin association of ACSS2 and H3K9ac in vivo via ChIP-seq in 
mouse hippocampus (HPC). Our HPC H3K9ac mapping strongly correlated with ENCODE 
mouse forebrain H3K9ac ChIP-seq (Spearman R = 0.67), with similar peak distribution 
(Extended Data Fig. 7a). HPC ACSS2 and H3K9ac corresponded genome-wide and over 
three canonical neuronal genes involved in memory, Arc, Egr2, and Nr2f2 (Fig. 3a–b). 
Additionally, ACSS2 promoter binding and H3K9ac correlated with RNA-seq in HPC (Fig. 
3c). We found a small number of genes that were ACSS2-bound but not H3K9ac enriched 
that were silent, similar to genes not enriched for ACSS2 or H3K9ac (Fig. 3d). In contrast, 
genes enriched for H3K9ac were actively transcribed, but genes enriched for both ACSS2 
and H3K9ac were most highly expressed (Fig. 3d).
Physical association of ACSS2/CBP in differentiated CAD cells (Fig. 2h) correlated with 
gene colocalization of ACSS2 and CBP in HPC, together with H3K27ac, sourcing public 
mouse cortex CBP and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (ACSS2:CBP overlap p-value = 3.23e–16 
by hypergeometric test). Overall, 57% of ACSS2-associated genes were co-targeted by 
H3K27ac (Fig. 3e), and ACSS2:CBP co-targeted genes enriched for GO terms involved in 
synaptic membrane potential (Extended Data Fig. 7b–c). Motif analysis at hippocampal

 ACSS2 peaks show NRF1 – a transcription factor regulating neurite growth – predicted 
binding at 45% of ACSS2 sites (Fig. 3f), evoking an ACSS2:CBP recruitment mechanism. 
Moreover, ACSS2 inhibitor-sensitive genes (50%: 145/289) had proximal ACSS2 within 
10kb of the TSS (hypergeometric analysis, p = 7.6986e-08), supporting a direct role for 
chromatin-bound ACSS2 in transcription.
ACSS2 regulates long-term memory storage
Hippocampus-dependent spatial memory occurs through activity-dependent changes in gene 
expression that are coordinated, in part, through epigenetic modifications, specifically 
histone acetylation19,20. ACSS2 is expressed throughout the hippocampus (Extended Data 
Fig. 8a)12,21, and thus may mediate histone acetylation to upregulate neuronal gene 
expression during memory consolidation19,22. To explore the role of ACSS2 in the adult 
hippocampus, we attenuated ACSS2 expression in the dorsal HPC by shRNA KD using viral 
vector (Fig. 4a–b). Compared to control-injected mice, ACSS2 KD animals showed similar 
levels in locomotion, coordination, body weight, and anxiety-related thigmotaxis during 
open field exploration23 (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d; p = ns, n = 10 per group), thus, ACSS2 
KD did not cause gross behavioral alterations.
To assess hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, we utilized an object-location memory 
paradigm24. Animals explore three different objects during training, and long-term memory 
is tested by re-exposure 24h later with one object moved to a novel location (Fig. 4a, right). 
In training, control and KD mice showed no difference in exploration (Fig. 4c, left). During 
memory retrieval, control mice displayed preferred exploration of novel location object (Fig. 
4c, right, grey bar NLO2). In contrast, ACSS2 KD mice were impaired in spatial object 
memory (Fig. 4c, right, black bar NLO2; Extended Data Fig. 8e, mean Δ = −5.01 ± 1.21; p = 
8.3e-05), and displayed a lower discrimination index (Fig. 4d; % ΔDI = −29.5 ± 11.4; p = 
0.02). ACSS2 KD mice showed reduced total object exploration during the test (Fig. 4c, 
right black bars), suggesting diminished novelty associated with intact recognition of the 
objects from the training session (mean Δ = −6.13 ± 2.15; p = 0.02, N = 10 per group).
Previous studies have found that long-term contextual fear memory is mediated by the 
ventral HPC when manipulations of the dorsal HPC occur prior to training25. Therefore, as a 
control experiment, mice injected with ACSS2 KD or eGFP in the dorsal hippocampus were 
subjected to a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. During the 24h test session, there was 
no significant difference in the amount of freezing behavior between ACSS2 KD or eGFP 
mice (Extended Data Fig. 8f–g) suggesting a successful context-shock association mediated 
by the ventral hippocampus. Overall, we conclude that ACSS2 plays a critical role in dorsal 
HPC-mediated long-term spatial memory.
ACSS2 regulates upregulation of immediate-early genes
Long-term spatial memory involves rapid increase of histone acetylation and immediate-
early gene transcription, occurring in a sensitive time window to enable memory 
consolidation19,26; during memory retrieval, gene transcription also occurs for memory 
reconsolidation – which is prevented by inhibiting mRNA synthesis during the sensitive 
post-retrieval period27. We tested ACSS2 involvement in dynamic gene upregulation for

 HPC memory consolidation and reconsolidation, performing mRNA-seq on the dorsal HPC. 
We first identified global gene expression changes induced by spatial object training, not 
previously investigated genome-wide. Dorsal HPC from control and shACSS2 KD mice 
were collected during the sensitive period of memory consolidation following spatial object 
training. To control for circadian oscillation, injected animals were included that had been 
handled but not trained.
Genes that are differentially expressed following training were discovered via transcriptome 
comparison of trained control injected mice to untrained circadian control injected mice 
using Cuffdiff. A small number of genes were induced immediately following training, 
featuring many known immediate-early genes, for example, Egr2, C-Fos, Nr2f2, Sgk1, and 
Arc (Fig. 4e; light grey bars). Importantly, baseline expression of these memory-associated 
genes in untrained mice was remarkably similar between control and ACSS2 KD (Extended 
Data Fig. 8h). In contrast, dynamic upregulation of these immediate-early genes was greatly 
reduced by ACSS2 KD (Fig. 4e; dark grey bars).
We further tested whether ACSS2 also regulates immediate-early gene expression in dorsal 
HPC during memory reconsolidation. Therefore, our HPC mRNA-seq analysis was focused 
on previously identified and validated genes that become upregulated following memory 
retrieval26,28. Remarkably, retrieval-associated induction of immediate-early genes did not 
occur during the sensitive reconsolidation period, whereas retrieval-linked downregulation 
during the same period was not affected by ACSS2 KD (Extended Data Fig. 9a–f).
DISCUSSION
Metabolic state can regulate chromatin structure, prominently involving histone 
modifications10. Here, we establish a unique connection between cellular metabolism and 
neuronal plasticity, and reveal a neuronal function of ACSS2 as a chromatin-bound 
transcriptional coactivator that stimulates histone acetylation and gene expression.
Acetyl-CoA metabolism is cell and tissue specific, and is frequently dysregulated in 
malignant transformation14,29. In adipose cells, ACSS2 partially localizes to the nucleus and 
contributes to histone acetylation in low glucose9,30, yet the principal metabolic determinant 
of histone acetylation is ACL9. In contrast, we show that post-mitotic neurons rely on 
chromatin-recruited ACSS2 to supply acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation. Of note, fasting 
lowers acetyl-CoA and protein acetylation in most tissues, yet acetyl-CoA levels remain 
unchanged in the brain31, indicating a key role of neuronal ACSS2 in the fasted state, when 
acetyl-CoA production by citrate-dependent ACL is reduced.
Optimal acetyltransferase activity requires an increased local acetyl-CoA to CoA ratio, 
which determines catalytic activity and substrate specificity of HAT enzymes8,9,32. This 
suggests that histone acetylation is controllable via changing levels of nuclear acetyl-CoA. 
In this view, chromatin-bound ACSS2 could provide acetyl-CoA to fuel HAT activity 
locally, instantaneously recycling CoA and, further, recapture acetate from deacetylation 
reactions. Here, we show specific chromatin binding by ACSS2 at neuronal genes and link 
localization to upregulation of histone acetylation and gene transcription in spatial memory

 (Fig. 4f), which requires increased histone acetylation3,20. We demonstrate a crucial role for 
ACSS2 in upregulation of immediate-early genes with key functions in neuronal plasticity 
and memory, leading to a critical role in long-term memory consolidation.
Epigenetic mechanisms continue to be revealed as important regulators of neural function 
and behavior, and are being implicated in neuropsychiatric disease, including anxiety 
disorders and depression1,3,33. In establishing ACSS2 as a key regulator at the interface of 
metabolic environment and neuronal chromatin, our study provides a novel enzymatic target 
in therapies of such neurological and cognitive disorders.
METHODS
Cell Culture
CAD cells (Cath.-a-differentiated; generously donated from the Holzbaur Lab at the 
University of Pennsylvania) were grown in DMEM:HAMS F12 (1:1), supplemented with 
2mM Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). To 
induce neuronal differentiation, sub-confluent CAD cell cultures (50–60%) were transferred 
to serum-free media (DMEM:HAMS F12 (1:1) supplemented with 2mM Glutamine) and 
maintained in 15 cm2 culturing dishes for 5 days. For knockdown experiments, CAD cells 
were infected with lentiviral hairpin constructs (TRC collection) designed against ACL 
(#TRCN0000055217) or ACSS2 (#TRCN0000076124, #TRCN0000076125) in medium 
containing 8 mg/mL polybrene and 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells then underwent selection in 
culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL puromycin for 5 days to obtain a stably 
infected population. Cell treatment with the ACSS2i (diluted in DMSO; 1-(2,3-
di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxalin-6-yl)-3-(2-methoxyethyl)urea from ChemBridge) was carried 
out for 24 hours total at a final concentration of 20 μm (treatment with DMSO alone served 
as control).
RNA-seq
To generate libraries for RNA-seq, polyA+ RNA was extracted using the Dynabeads mRNA 
Direct kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries for 
scrambled control (referred to in text as WT), shACL, and shACSS2 were made using a 
ScriptSeq v2 RNA-seq Library Preparation Kit from Epicentre (now Illumina). The quantity 
and quality of the libraries were assessed by BioAnalyzer (Agilent) and qPCR (Kapa 
Biosystems). The multiplexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a single lane on the 
Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (50bp, single-end reads). All RNA seq data was prepared for 
analysis as follows: NextSeq sequencing data was demultiplexed using bcl2fastq2-
v02.14.01.07. Demultiplexed FASTQs were aligned by RNA-STAR 2.3.0.e using the 
genome index mm10 generated from iGenome UCSC mm10 FASTQ genome sequence. The 
aligned reads were mapped to genomic features using cufflinks-2.2.1, (-G parameter to only 
quantitate known features), and iGenomes mm10 UCSC genomic transcript loci. The rRNA, 
mRNA, and tRNA of the mouse genome were downloaded from the goldenPath UCSC FTP 
and were masked from the transcript quantification. After quantification, all data processing 
was done using python pandas library v.0.14.0. Differential expression in CAD neurons was 
defined as the top 10% of genes by fold-change, corresponding roughly to 1.6-fold up-

 regulation or higher. Differential expression in the inhibitor and the hippocampal ACSS2 
knockdown in vivo were defined using Cuffdiff. The relationship between CAD cell 
differentiation and inhibitor function (2H) was inferred by assessing standardized scores 
over two RNA-seq replicates each of untreated and ACSS2i-treated cells. These were 
averaged and genes with |z| < 0.5 in either condition were dropped. Scores for remaining 
genes are plotted in order of increasing CAD differentiation fold change. Statistical 
significance of the trend and reproducibility were assessed by taking the top 20% of genes 
by loss of expression in the knockdown and comparing the expression of these genes in 
inhibitor-treated cells to a random sample of genes outside this set (Mann-Whitney test).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed sequencing (ChIP-seq)
CAD cells were fixed in 1% Formaldehyde for 10 minutes and fixation was quenched with 
the addition of glycine to 125mM for an additional 5 minutes. Cells were harvested by 
scraping from plates, and washed twice in 1x PBS before storage at −80°C. ChIP was 
performed as previously described (Shah, P.P., et al. 2013), except that chromatin was 
sheared to an average size of <500 bp using the Covaris S220 Ultrasonicator. Equal aliquots 
of sonicated chromatin from undifferentiated and differentiated CAD neurons were used per 
immunoprecipitation reaction, and 10% of the amount was saved as input. ACSS2 ChIPs 
were performed using 2000 μg of extract and 4 μg of antibody per sample; all other ChIPs 
were performed using 500 μg of extract and 4 μg of antibody per sample. 
Immunoprecipitation was performed using protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies). 
Sequencing libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra library preparation procedure, and 
then assessed for quality and quantity by BioAnalyzer (Agilent) and qPCR (Kapa 
Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. All ChIP-
seq data was prepared for analysis as follows: NextSeq sequencing data was demultiplexed 
using bcl2fastq. All reads were aligned to the mm9 or the mm10 referenence genome using 
bowtie2.2.1. 1 alignment was allowed per read and 1 mismatch was allowed in the seed 
region (-N1 -k1). Reads were tabulated in fixed windows or to genes provided in the 
iGenome mm10 UCSC annotations using featureCounts from the subread 1.4.6 software 
package. CAD cell ACSS2 ChIP-seq data was normalized to input controls, while all histone 
acetylation ChIP-seq data was H3-subtracted. The plot in S5I is the result of performing a 
multiple linear regression to determine the relationship of the undifferentiated and 
differentiated CAD expression (regressors) and enrichment of ACSS2 in differentiated CAD 
cells (target). The relationship was used to color the negative space in the plot by propensity 
of ACSS2 binding. For the in vivo ChIP, hippocampal tissue pooled from two animals was 
finely minced and cross-linked with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 15 minutes 
at room temperature, followed by glycine quenching for an additional 10 minutes at 4°C. To 
create a single cell suspension, samples were washed once with ice cold PBS and 
homogenized by passing through a 22G needle 10 times. Subsequent steps were performed 
in the same way as described for the in vitro ChIP. In vivo ChIP peaks (ACSS2 (T), H3K9ac, 
CBP – GSM1629373, and H3K27ac – GSM1629397) were called using MACS v2.1.0 with 
the FDR controlled at 1%. Peak scores were assessed by adjusting to millions of aligned tags 
and subtracting background. Tracks were similarly normalized and are visualized using the 
UCSC genome browser with a maximum value windowing function and smoothing at 5 
pixels (in vitro ChIP-seq) or using default parameters (in vivo ChIP-seq). The Venn diagram

 in Fig. 5B shows overlap of genes (official gene symbol) that feature ChIP-seq peaks within 
1kb of their nearest TSS. Venn diagrams in Fig. 5E and S6B display overlapping target gene 
sets (RefSeq transcripts) that were assigned to the entire set of ChIP-seq peaks, since CBP 
binds to few genes within 1kb of the TSS. The in vivo mRNA expression vs. ChIP analysis 
(Fig. 5C) was created by sorting genes on log2 transformed expression values (DESeq 
library-size adjusted, replicate-averaged values) in home cage control mice then displaying 
ChIP-seq AUCs (RPM-adjusted ChIP minus RPM-adjusted background, length adjusted) for 
each gene for the peak closest to its TSS within a distance of 1kb (all genes with more distal 
peaks were rendered as having a score of zero). Gene targets were inferred by the presence 
of peaks proximal to the TSS (within 1kb). To identify enriched motifs (Fig. 5F), in vivo 
ACSS2 peaks targeting genes up-regulated in differentiated CAD cells (without respect for 
distance to the nearest TSS) were compared to a background set of equal-sized regions 
selected from gene-rich regions using HOMER (peak sizes were fixed at 300bp). Discovered 
motifs were filtered for those present at 1/3 or more of the targeting peaks and with a 10-fold 
or higher enrichment over the gene-rich background. To assess the overlap of in ACSS2 and 
histone acetylation (Fig. 3E, S3D), ACSS2 peaks were filtered to include only those 
upstream of their nearest target genes. Downstream acetylation was assessed for similarly 
filtered peaks of H3K9ac, H4K5ac, and H4K12ac from the same cells, as well as cortical 
H3K27ac. For the in vivo analysis (5B), gene targets of ACSS2 or H3K9ac peaks within 1kb 
of their nearest TSS were examined for overlap. The acetylation pattern due to 
differentiation at induced or inhibitor-sensitive genes (Fig. 3J, 3K) was assessed by taking a 
20kb window around the TSS and measuring input-adjusted ChIP-seq signal. H3K9ac data 
were validated (Extended Data Fig. 6A) by comparing to ENCODE’s common-replicate 
peaks for H3K9ac in mouse forebrain (accession ENCSR369RBO) using CEAS (default 
parameters, with a 1kb–10kb window around the TSS and TES). Additional comparisons 
were made to H3K9ac (NCBI GEO: GSE82643) and H3K27ac (GSE82428), contrasting to 
input (GSE82659) to control for sonication efficiency. Cortical H3K27ac (NCBI GEO: 
GSM1629397) and CBP (GSM1629373) were aligned along with the corresponding input 
(GSM1629381) using bowtie2 (parameters -k 1 -N 1 --local) and peaks were called using 
MACS2 (input control, FDR controlled at 1%) (Fig. 5E, S6B). The combined effect of 
ACSS2 and histone acetylation targeting on gene expression in vivo (Fig. 5D) was 
demonstrated by box-plotting expression in home cage control mice at genes targeted by 
ACSS2 by itself, H3K9ac by itself, ACSS2 + H3K9ac, or neither. Only genes bound at the 
promoter (1kb distance) by ACSS2 were considered.
Acetyl-CoA Quantification
To extract and quantify acetyl-CoA in differentiated CAD neurons, 4 × 106 cells were 
washed and incubated in lysis buffer for 30 minutes (10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM 
MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). The nuclei were pelleted at 3000g for 5 minutes, and immediately re-
suspended in Acetyl CoA Assay Buffer provided in the PicoProbe Acetyl CoA Assay Kit 
available from Abcam (ab87546). The acetyl-CoA assay, including the deproteinization step, 
was prepared per instructions by the manufacturer. The PicoProbe assay was performed in 
96 well clear-bottom plates, and the resulting fluorescence was quantified using the 
Synergy™ HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments).

 Western blots
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% 
NP40, 1% SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Life Technologies, #78446). 
For subcellular fractionation experiments, the cells were processed using the subcellular 
fractionation kit for cultured cells (Thermo Scientific 78840) according to the manufacturer 
instructions. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Life 
Technologies, number 23227), and equal amounts of protein were used in co-
immunoprecipitation experiments or directly loaded on polyacrylamide gels. The 
endogenous co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed using antibody-
conjugated protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies) in buffer containing: 20 mM Tris, pH 
8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, with protease and 
phosphatase inhibitors, and 12.5 U ml−1benzonase (Novagen, 70746). Proteins or co-IP 
eluates were loaded and separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE). After 
transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, 3% BSA in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 
(TBST) was used to block the membrane at room temperature for 1 hour. Primary antibodies 
were diluted in TBST, and incubated at 4°C overnight. Primary antibodies are listed below. 
The membrane was washed 3 times with TBST, each for 10 minutes, followed by incubation 
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour, in TBST. The 
membrane was washed again 3 times, and imaged by Fujifilm LAS-4000 imager. Original 
gel blots provided as Supplementary Figure 1.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed 
twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes. After 
washing two times, cells were blocked in 10% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA in PBS supplemented with 0.1% 
Tween 20 (PBST) overnight at 4°C. Antibodies are listed below. Then cells were washed 
four times with PBST, each for 10 minutes, followed by incubation with fluorophore-
conjugated secondary antibody in 5% BSA in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. F-actin 
was labeled using Alexa Fluor® 488 Phalloidin (Thermo A12379). Cells were then washed 
three times in PBST, once with PBS, and incubated with 1 μg/ml of DAPI for 5 minutes. The 
cells were then washed twice with PBS, and mounted with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). The 
slides were observed and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse microscope. Microscopy settings 
were unchanged between samples.

 Intracranial injection of viral vector
Adult mice (8+ weeks of age) were anesthetized with isoflurane gas (1–5% to maintain 
surgical plane) and placed in a sterile field within a stereotaxic device. Animals received an 
injection of bupivacaine (2.5mg/Kg) for local anesthesia before the skin was disinfected with 
betadine solution and the skull exposed with a short incision using sterile surgical 
equipment. Artificial tears were applied to eyes to ensure sufficient lubricating. A small hole 
(about 0.5 millimeters) was be drilled in the skull over the target area using a stereotax and a 
stereotactic drill. A micro-syringe filled with viral vector was inserted into the dorsal 
hippocampus and slowly removed following injection (AP, −2.0mm; DV, −1.4mm; ML, +/
−1.5mm from Bregma; AAV2/9.U6.shACSS2.CMV.EGFP = ACSS2 knockdown vector; 
AAV2/9.CMV.EGFP.polyA = eGFP-control vector). All animals received a single dose of 
subcutaneous meloxicam (5 mg/kg) as analgesia (pain medicine) at induction and one dose 
per day for two days post-operatively as needed.
Object location memory (OLM) task
The OLM procedure is used to test spatial memory. The procedure consists of a training 
phase and a testing phase. Prior to training, each mouse was handled for 3 minutes a day for 
3 days. During the training day, mice are placed in an arena (approx. 1 square foot) 
containing 3 different objects. The objects used were a glass bottle, a metal tower (5H × 2W 
× 2L inches), and a plastic cylinder. Mice were habituated to an empty arena with a black 
and white striped spatial cue on the wall, followed by object exposure in three 6 minute trials 
with and interval of 3 minutes. The arena and objects were cleaned with 70% EtOH between 
trials. To diminish biases, the memory test was performed on control and KD mice on the 
same day in the same arena, using every combination of object location (n = 10 mice per 
study group). After 24 hours, the individual mice were placed back in the arena used in the 
testing phase. For testing, one of the objects was moved to different location in the arena. 
Mice were allowed to freely explore for 5 minutes. Each session was recorded using a video 
camera and time spent exploring (approaches and sniffing) each object was assessed offline.
Contextual fear conditioning
The animal was placed in the conditioning chamber (Med Associates) for 5 min before the 
onset of the unconditioned stimulus (US), a 1.5 mA of continuous foot shock. A mild 2 sec., 
1.5 mA foot shock is used as an aversive stimulus, which does not injure the mice in any 
way but provides the transient, yet startling and aversive, stimulus that is necessary for 
conditioning. After an additional 30 s in the chamber, the mouse was returned to its home 
cage. Twenty-four hours later, the mouse was tested for a freezing response to the chamber 
(contextual) where training occurred. Time spent freezing in the chamber (motionless except 
for respiratory movements) in the chamber was assessed for 5 consecutive minutes.

between genic ACSS2 enrichment and WT gene expression changes, and to visualize the 
interaction between differentiation-linked gene expression changes and ACSS2 recruitment 
to chromatin. The contour plot of this fitted regression model displays high levels of ACSS2 
enrichment in red and low levels in blue, and is overlaid with the scatter plot of the 
independent gene expression variables. The visualized model demonstrates that high ACSS2 
enrichment (red) corresponds to increased gene expression in the CAD neuronal 
differentiation.

ACSS2 regulates retrieval-induced upregulation immediate-early genes in vivo. (a) Genome-
wide RNA-seq was performed on the dorsal hippocampus of eGFP control and shACSS2 
knockdown animals. The analysis was focused on the set of previously identified and 
validated genes that become upregulated during the sensitive period following memory 
retrieval. The baseline expression of immediate-early genes in untrained animals is not 
changed in shACSS2-AAV9 mice when compared to eGFP-AAV9 control mice (CC – 
circadian control). (b) During the sensitive period following contextual memory retrieval 
(RT – 30 min post-exposure to conditioning chamber 24h following fear conditioning), 
immediate-early genes are upregulated in dorsal HPC in the control injected animals. In 
contrast, the dynamic retrieval-induced expression of these early response genes is absent in 
ACSS2 knockdown animals (p = 0.001, Paired T test). (c) Boxplot shows the induction

genes occurs both in eGFP control and ACSS2 knockdown mice, except Cldn5. (f) Boxplot 
compares retrieval-induced downregulation of retrieval-responsive genes in the dorsal 
hippocampus in eGFP control versus shACSS2 knockdown (RT/CC).

Nuclear ACSS2 supports neuronal gene expression. (a) ACSS2 localizes to the cytoplasm in 
undifferentiated CAD neurons. ACSS2 was imaged by immunofluorescence microscopy in 
CAD cells (DAPI and α-Tubulin immunostaining visualize nuclei and cytoplasm, 
respectively). Scale bar = 10 μm (b) ACSS2 localizes to the nucleus of differentiated CAD 
neurons. (c) Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic (CE) and nuclear (NE) extracts from 
undifferentiated CAD cells (u) and differentiated CAD neurons (d) for ACSS2, ACL, and 
histone H3. Nuclear ACSS2 expression is increased upon differentiation (t test p = 0.002, n 
= 3, SD). (d) ACSS2 KD reduces differentiation-linked upregulation of neuronal gene 
expression program. Scatter plot contrasts the fold-change FPKM of induced genes 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c) between WT and ACSS2 KD (pearson r = 0.15, p = 5.1e-06). 
Marginal distributions show histogram and kernel density estimation. Ordinary least squares 
linear regression is displayed with 95% confidence interval. (e) Western blot of lysates from 
differentiated CAD neurons that were infected with lentiviral control (WT) or ACSS2 
knockdown vector (shACSS2) (quantification shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g; n = 3). (f) 
ACSS2 KD greatly lowers gene upregulation. Quintiles of upregulated genes (red dots in 
Extended Data Fig. 2c) with the greatest fold-change increase in WT (grey). Corresponding 
gene quintiles depict fold-change FPKM in ACSS2 KD (green) (for each quintile, columns 
represent the mean induction value of genes, p = 7.2e-252, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, SE). (g) 
ACSS2i treatment in CAD neurons results in reduced expression of differentiation-induced 
genes. Plotted are all genes in order of fold-change in WT CAD differentiation, and z-scores 
were computed for ACSS2i-treatment and control, representing upregulation as blue and

ACSS2 is recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin and promotes neuronal histone 
acetylation. (a) Genome browser tracks showing ChIP-seq over the Camk2a locus shows that 
increases in H4K5, H4K12, and H3K9 acetylation co-occur with proximate ACSS2 
enrichment upon CAD neuron differentiation (chr18: 60,920,000–60,990,000). (b) GO term 
enrichment analysis of top 5% genes that become ACSS2-bound in CAD neuron 
differentiation show neuronal pathways. (c) Violin-contour plots show ChIP-seq enrichment 
of the indicated histone acetylation occurs with top-ranked ACSS2 enrichment during CAD 
neuronal differentiation. (d) ChIP-seq enrichment of the 299 genes that are reduced upon 
ACSS2i treatment (details in methods) shows high correlation with histone acetylation in the 
differentiated state (d – differentiated, u – undifferentiated). (e) Analysis of all genes 
previously linked to neuronal differentiation (ND genes, AmiGO annotation set of 1,315 
genes), and the subset of known ND genes that are induced in CAD cell differentiation 
(Induced), show reduced expression in ACSS2i-treated CAD neurons (inh) compared to 
DMSO control (con). (f) Nuclear acetyl-CoA levels are reduced in response to either KD of 
ACSS2 (mean Δ = −0.19 ± 0.03, p = 0.003) or application of the ACSS2 inhibitor (mean Δ = 
−0.25 ± 0.05, p = 0.006; n = 3, SD). (g) Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates shows 
that lentiviral shRNA-mediated KD of ACSS2 lowers H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation 
(quantifed in Extended Data Fig. 6a). (h) Western blot analysis of IP eluates shows that CBP 
is co-IPed in the ACSS2 IP, but not in the control IgG IP. (i) Immunofluorescence in primary 
hippocampal neurons shows nuclear localization of ACSS2 (day 7 of in vitro differentiation 
culture, isolated from C57BL/6 embryos). Scale bar = 50 μm (j) Western blots of lysates 
from primary hippocampal neurons (d7) treated for 24h with the ACSS2i, probed with the 
indicated antibodies (quantified in Extended Data Fig. 6c) shows reduction of histone 
acetylation.

ACSS2 ChIP-seq localization is linked to histone acetylation in vivo in mouse hippocampus 
(HPC). (a) ChIP-seq for ACSS2 and H3K9ac in mouse HPC. Track-views show ACSS2 and 
H3K9ac for three canonical neuronal genes involved in memory: Arc, Egr2, and Nr2f2 
(chr15:74496025–74506488, chr10:66991018–67006804, and chr7:77488549–77516626, 
respectively). (b) Venn diagram shows in vivo HPC ACSS2 and H3K9ac peaks co-localize 
with the nearest gene TSS (< 1kb from peak) among all RefSeq transcripts. (c) RNA-seq 
expression in dorsal HPC correlates with ACSS2 binding and enrichment of H3K9 
acetylation. (d) Expression profile of genes classified by way of their ACSS2 and H3K9ac

 Figure 4. 
ACSS2 knockdown in dorsal HPC impairs object location memory (OLM) and upregulation 
of immediate-early genes following training. (a) Stereotactic surgery was performed to 
deliver AAV9 knockdown vector into the dorsal HPC (AP, −2.0mm; DV, −1.4mm; ML, +/
−1.5mm from Bregma); four weeks later habituated mice received training for object 
location memory (four 5 min training sessions in arena with three different objects). 24 
hours later the mice were given a retention test in which one object was moved to a novel 
location (n = 10 per cohort). (b) Western blot analysis of HPC tissue harvested from animals 
injected dorsally with either eGFP control or ACSS2 KD vector (d – dorsal, v – ventral) 
shows specific reduction of ACSS2 in dorsal HPC. (c) ACSS2 KD animals are impaired in 
object location memory. eGFP-control and shACSS2-AAV9 mice display no preference for 
any of three objects (O1–3) during the OLM training session (TR – Training). In the 24h 
retention test, eGFP-AAV9 control mice show preference for novel object location (NL), 
whereas the shACSS2 KD mice display no preference for the novel object location (NL). (d) 
The spatial memory defect in ACSS2 KD animals manifests in lowered discrimination index 
(% DI = (t NL − t FL)/(t NL+ t FL)) compared to control mice (ΔDI = −29.5 ± 11.4, p = 
0.02; n = 10, SD). (e) Training-induced expression of a cohort of immediate-early genes (see 
Extended Data Fig. 8h) is greatly attenuated in ACSS2 KD animals (four animals per group,
