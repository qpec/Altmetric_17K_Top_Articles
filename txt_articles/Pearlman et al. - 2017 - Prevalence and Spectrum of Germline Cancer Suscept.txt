IMPORTANCE Hereditary cancer syndromes infer high cancer risks and require intensive
cancer surveillance, yet the prevalence and spectrum of these conditions among unselected
patients with early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is largely undetermined.
OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency and spectrum of cancer susceptibility gene
mutations among patients with early-onset CRC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Overall, 450 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer
younger than 50 years were prospectively accrued from 51 hospitals into the Ohio Colorectal
Cancer Prevention Initiative from January 1, 2013, to June 20, 2016. Mismatch repair (MMR)
deficiency was determined by microsatellite instability and/or immunohistochemistry.
Germline DNA was tested for mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes using
next-generation sequencing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mutation prevalence and spectrum in patients with
early-onset CRC was determined. Clinical characteristics were assessed by mutation status.
RESULTS In total 450 patients younger than 50 years were included in the study, and 75 gene
mutations were found in 72 patients (16%). Forty-eight patients (10.7%) had MMR-deficient
tumors, and 40 patients (83.3%) had at least 1 gene mutation: 37 had Lynch syndrome (13,
MLH1 [including one with constitutional MLH1 methylation]; 16, MSH2; 1, MSH2/monoallelic
MUTYH; 2, MSH6; 5, PMS2); 1 patient had the APC c.3920T>A, p.I1307K mutation and a PMS2
variant; 9 patients (18.8%) had double somatic MMR mutations (including 2 with germline
biallelic MUTYH mutations); and 1 patient had somatic MLH1 methylation. Four hundred two
patients (89.3%) had MMR-proficient tumors, and 32 patients (8%) had at least 1 gene
mutation: 9 had mutations in high-penetrance CRC genes (5, APC; 1, APC/PMS2; 2, biallelic
MUTYH; 1, SMAD4); 13 patients had mutations in high- or moderate-penetrance genes not
traditionally associated with CRC (3, ATM; 1, ATM/CHEK2; 2, BRCA1; 4, BRCA2; 1, CDKN2A; 2,
PALB2); 10 patients had mutations in low-penetrance CRC genes (3, APC c.3920T>A,
p.I1307K; 7, monoallelic MUTYH). Importantly, 24 of 72 patients (33.3%) who were mutation
positive did not meet established genetic testing criteria for the gene(s) in which they had a
mutation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Of 450 patients with early-onset CRC, 72 (16%) had gene
mutations. Given the high frequency and wide spectrum of mutations, genetic counseling
and testing with a multigene panel could be considered for all patients with early-onset CRC.

olorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common can-
cer diagnosed in the United States, excluding nonmela-
noma skin cancers.1 The median age of CRC diagnosis
is 69 years in males and 73 years in females; 10% of patients
with CRC are diagnosed when they are younger than 50 years.1
Early-onset cancer is a hallmark of inherited cancer predispo-
sition. Identification of hereditary cancer syndromes has sig-
nificant implications for patients and families, as it facilitates
risk assessment, directs clinical management, and can guide
treatment options.
Lynchsyndrome,causedbygermlinemutationsinthemis-
match repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, or
EPCAM, is the most common known cause of hereditary CRC
and accounts for 4% to 13.5% of patients with early-onset
CRC.2-6PatientswithtumorsexhibitingcharacteristicsofMMR
deficiency are more likely to have Lynch syndrome; there-
fore, professional guidelines recommend all patients with CRC
receive tumor screening for Lynch syndrome, with referral to
genetic counseling for those with MMR deficiency.7,8 The Na-
tional Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guide-
lines in Oncology for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assess-
ment: Colorectal (NCCN Guidelines) suggests that all patients
with CRC diagnosed younger than 50 years consider genetic
testing for Lynch syndrome.9
The prevalence of other hereditary cancer syndromes
among patients with early-onset CRC is largely unknown be-
cause previous studies are limited and have been confined to
selected (high-risk) patient populations.5,6 With the advent of
next-generation sequencing (NGS), genetic testing for heredi-
tary CRC has shifted from phenotype-specific single gene as-
sessment to broad panels providing simultaneous assess-
mentofmultiplegenesimplicatedinvarioushereditarycancer
syndromes. Previous studies have shown that multigene
panel testing for hereditary CRC is feasible, timely, and more
cost-effective than single gene testing.10 However, the clini-
cal utility of multigene panel testing among patients with
early-onset CRC is not known.
Using multigene panel testing, we determined the preva-
lence and spectrum of germline mutations in 25 genes asso-
ciated with various hereditary cancer syndromes in 450 pa-
tientswithCRCdiagnosedatyoungerthan50years,unselected
for family history or MMR status of the tumor.
Methods
Patients
As of June 20, 2016, 2785 patients who had surgical resection
in Ohio for newly diagnosed invasive colorectal adenocarci-
noma between the ages of 17 and 96 years, on or after January
1, 2013, were prospectively enrolled into the ongoing Ohio Co-
lorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative (OCCPI). The OCCPI was
created to decrease CRC incidence in Ohio by identifying pa-
tients with hereditary predisposition (statewide universal tu-
mor screening for newly diagnosed patients with CRC), in-
creasing colonoscopy compliance for first-degree relatives of
patients with CRC and encouraging future research through
the creation of a biorepository. The 51 Ohio hospitals partici-
pating in the OCCPI (eTable 1 in the Supplement) were se-
lectedtorepresentacross-sectionofclinicalcentersinthestate
based on high reported volume of patients with CRC, affilia-
tion with a high volume hospital, or interest in participation.
Institutional review board approval was obtained by the in-
dividual hospitals, Community Oncology Programs, or by
ceding review to the Ohio State University (OSU) institutional
review board. Written informed consent was obtained.
Of the total patients enrolled, 594 were diagnosed at
younger than 50 years, and 450 of those ostensibly unrelated
patients had all of their testing completed in time for inclu-
sion in this analysis (75.8% of the total patients enrolled
younger than 50 years). Using tumor registry numbers from
2013, there were an estimated 1207 patients diagnosed with
CRCatyoungerthan50yearsinthestateofOhiobetweenJanu-
ary 2013 and June 2016.11 Therefore, this analysis includes
37.3% (450 of 1207) of eligible patients.
Samples
Bloodandaparaffin-embeddedtumorblockorunstainedslides
were submitted for each patient. Study pathologists con-
firmed the tumor histology and marked areas with at least 30%
tumorandnormaladjacenttissue.Bloodandtissue(tumorand
normal) underwent DNA extraction using standard methods.12
Tumor Screening for Lynch Syndrome
All tumors were screened for MMR deficiency by microsatel-
liteinstability(MSI)testingand/orimmunohistochemical(IHC)
analysis. Tumor screening was performed centrally at OSU, if
not already completed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendmentsâ€“approved laboratory for clinical care. Microsat-
ellite instability testing was completed using tumor and nor-
mal DNA to detect a size change in microsatellites using the
Promega MSI Analysis System version 1.2 (Promega Corpora-
tion). This included fluorescently labeled primers for coam-
plification of 7 repeat markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21,
NR-24, MONO-27, Penta C, Penta D). Tumors showing MSI at
0 markers were classified as microsatellite stable (MSS). Tu-
mors showing MSI at 1 marker were classified as microsatel-
lite low. Tumors showing MSI at 2 or more markers were clas-
sified as microsatellite high (MSI-H). Immunohistochemistry
of the MMR proteins was performed using the 2-stain method
as previously described.13 Staining for all 4 MMR proteins was
Key Points
Question What is the frequency and spectrum of cancer
susceptibility gene mutations among patients with colorectal
cancer diagnosed at younger than 50 years?
Findings In this cohort study of 450 patients with early-onset
colorectal cancer, 72 (16%) had a pathogenic mutation. Panel
testing identified mutations in patients that may have otherwise
been missed; specifically, 24 of 72 patients (33.3%) who were
mutation positive did not meet testing criteria for the gene(s) in
which they had a mutation.
Meaning Multigene panel testing should be considered for all
patients with early-onset colorectal cancer.

mics EP49 (Rabbit: AC-0047), PMS-2 Clone: BD Pharmingen
A16-4 (Mouse: 556415). Proteins with convincing stain in more
than 1% of cells were considered present. Methylation of the
MLH1 promoter was assessed at 4 CpG sites between âˆ’209 and
âˆ’188 using pyrosequencing14 when tumors were MSI-H and/or
absent MLH1 and PMS2 proteins on IHC. The average percent
of methylation detected at the 4 CpG sites was used to clas-
sify tumors as methylated (â‰¥10% methylation) or not (<10%
methylation).
Germline Genetic Testing
The testing strategy is detailed in the Figure. All patients
underwent germline testing for 25 cancer susceptibility genes:
APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1,
CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
MUTYH,NBN,PALB2,PMS2,PTEN,RAD51C,RAD51D,SMAD4,
STK11, TP53. Two clinical laboratories were used for germline
testing based on the MMR status of the tumor. Genetic test-
ing for patients with MMR deficient tumors (MSI-H and/or ab-
normal IHC without MLH1 methylation) was performed at the
University of Washington (UW). Genomic regions were cap-
turedusingbiotinylatedRNAoliognucleotides(SureSelect;Agi-
lent Technologies) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000
instrument (Illumina Inc).15 Large rearrangements were
detected.16 Genetic testing for patients with MMR-proficient
tumors (MSS and/or normal IHC) or MLH1 methylation was
performed at Myriad Genetics Inc, and ultra-deep targeted se-
quencing was performed using the RainDance Thunder-
Storm platform (RainDance Technologies) for DNA amplifica-
tion and Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq2000 instruments.17 Large
rearrangements were detected. The Clinical Laboratory Im-
provement Amendmentsâ€“approved laboratories adjudicated
the pathogenicity of all mutations using criteria established by
the American College of Medical Genetics and International
Agency for Research on Cancer guidelines.18,19
Tumor Genetic Testing
Select patients underwent additional testing of the MMR genes
in tumor DNA at UW using methods previously described.20
For patients with unexplained MMR deficiency (MMR-
deficient tumor, no germline MMR mutation or MLH1 meth-
ylation), tumors were assessed for 2 MMR mutations or 1 MMR
mutation with loss of heterozygosity of the opposite allele
(double somatic MMR mutations), which has been shown to
cause sporadic MMR deficiency.20 For patients with MMR-
deficient tumors and a germline MMR variant of uncertain sig-
nificance, tumors were assessed for additional MMR muta-
tions or loss of heterozygosity to attempt to clarify the
pathogenicityofthevariant.Variantswerereclassifiedaslikely
pathogenic when tumor screening results supported patho-
genicity and 1 additional pathogenic mutation was identified
in the tumor using methods previously described.20
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were provided. Wilson score intervals
with continuity correction were used to compute confidence
intervals.PearsonÏ‡2testswithcontinuitycorrectionandFisher
exacttestwereusedtoestimatePvalues;alltestswere2-sided,
and level of significance was set at .05.
Results
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Men accounted for
52.2% (n = 235) of patients; the mean age at CRC diagnosis was
42.5 years. Over 85% of patients self-reported their race as
white (n = 385) and 9.1% of patients (n = 41) self-reported their
race as black. Among the patients, 8.2% (n = 37) had an addi-
tional malignancy. Overall, patients reported a family history
of at least 1 first-degree relative with cancer(s) of the colon
(n = 86 [19.1%]), endometrium (n = 19 [4.2%]), breast (n = 42
[9.3%]), ovary (n = 11 [2.4%]), and/or pancreas (n = 10 [2.2%]).
Tumor Screening for Lynch syndrome
Among the patients, 10.7% (n = 48) had MMR-deficient tu-
mors (n = 8 [16.7%], stage I; n = 13 [27.1%], stage II; n = 23
[47.9%], stage III; n = 4 [8.3%], stage IV). Three patients with
MMR-deficient tumors had MLH1 methylation. All tumor
screening results (MSI and IHC) were concordant for each pa-
tient, except for 1 (MSI-H, normal IHC). In total, 402 patients
(89.3%) had MMR-proficient tumors (n = 41 [10.2%], stage I;
n = 80 [19.9%] stage II; n = 174 [43.3%], stage III; n = 104
[25.9%], stage IV; n = 3 [0.7%], stage unavailable).
Overall Germline Genetic Testing
Among 450 patients with early-onset CRC, 75 pathogenic or
likely pathogenic cancer susceptibility gene mutations were
found in 72 patients (16%; 95% CI, 12.8%-19.8%). The spec-
trum of mutations is shown in Table 2. Thirty-six patients
(8%) had Lynch syndrome only; 2 patients (0.4%) had Lynch

syndrome and another hereditary cancer syndrome; 34 pa-
tients (7.6%) had a different hereditary cancer syndrome (in-
cluding a third patient with 2 syndromes). Sixty-one patients
(13.6%) had mutations in high- or moderate-penetrance genes,
and 11 patients (2.4%) had mutations in low-penetrance genes.
Genotype and phenotype data (including family history)
for patients with pathogenic mutations are provided in eTable
3 in the Supplement. Patients with pathogenic mutations were
more likely to report a family history of colon cancer (45.8%
vs 14%; P < .001) and endometrial cancer (11.1% vs 2.9%;
P = .005) compared with patients without mutations. Nine pa-
tients came from unique families with a known mutation in a
cancer susceptibility gene but had not undergone predictive
testing for the familial mutation prior to their CRC diagnosis.
Patients with Lynch syndrome (19 of 37) were diagnosed at ear-
lier stages (I, II) compared with patients with another heredi-
tary cancer syndrome (9 of 35) (51.4% vs 25.7%; P = .047).
Germline Results for Patients With MMR-Deficient Tumors
Forty(83.3%)ofthe48patientswithMMR-deficienttumorshad
at least 1 mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene. Thirty-
seven patients had Lynch syndrome (13, MLH1; 16, MSH2; 1,
MSH2/monoallelic MUTYH; 2, MSH6; 5, PMS2), 2 had biallelic
MUTYHmutations,and1hadthecommonlow-penetranceAPC
c.3920T>A, p.I1307K mutation21-23 and a variant of uncertain
significanceinPMS2(c.322G>T,p.G108W).Ninepatientsâ€™MMR-
deficient tumors were explained by double somatic MMR mu-
tations(including2patientswithgermlinebiallelicMUTYHmu-
tations) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Of the 3 patients with
MLH1 methylation, 1 was found to have a MSH2 mutation (the
tumor showed absence of all 4 MMR proteins on IHC), 1 was
foundtohaveconstitutionalMLH1methylationbytestingblood,
and the third patient did not have any germline mutations and
constitutional methylation was ruled out.
Germline Results for Patients With MMR-Proficient Tumors
Thirty-two (8%) of 402 patients with MMR-proficient tumors
had at least 1 mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene. Nine pa-
tients had mutations in high-penetrance genes with estab-
lished CRC risk (5, APC; 1, APC/PMS2; 2, biallelic MUTYH; 1,
SMAD4), 13 had mutations in high- or moderate-penetrance
genes not traditionally associated with CRC risk (3, ATM; 1,
ATM/CHEK2; 2, BRCA1; 4, BRCA2; 1, CDKN2A; 2, PALB2), and
10 had mutations in low-penetrance CRC genes (3, APC
c.3920T>A, p.I1307K; 7, monoallelic MUTYH).
Variants of Uncertain Significance
One hundred seventy-eight variants of uncertain significance
were found in 145 patients (32.2%) (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). The genes most likely to have a variant discovered

included ATM (n = 30 [16.9%]), APC (n = 19 [10.7%]), and
CHEK2 (n = 18 [10.1%]). Five variants were upgraded to
pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) after additional testing.
One patient with double somatic MMR mutations had a
germline pathogenic MUTYH mutation and MUTYH variant
c.698G>A, p.G233D, that was reclassified to likely patho-
genic based on segregation analysis and clinical history.
Tumor sequencing clarified that PMS2 c.215G>A, p.G72E and
MSH2 c.1832T>A, p.V611E were likely pathogenic owing to
the presence of the germline variant plus 1 additional patho-
genic somatic mutation, in addition to supportive tumor
screening results. RNA studies showing altered MLH1 splic-
ing (exon 2 skipping) in a majority of transcripts and coseg-
regation with disease proved that MLH1 c.207 + 5G>C was
pathogenic. Cosegregation with disease proved that MSH6
c.1109T>C, p.L370S was pathogenic.
Discussion
This prospective, statewide study indicates that 1 of every 6
patients with CRC diagnosed younger than 50 years has at least
1 pathogenic cancer susceptibility gene mutation (16%). While
the prevalence of Lynch syndrome reported herein (8.4%) is
consistent with previous publications,2,3 this is the first study
to our knowledge to determine the prevalence and spectrum
of other hereditary cancer syndromes (8%) found in an unse-
lected series of patients with early-onset CRC. All patients
found to have pathogenic mutations received genetic coun-
selingandcurrentevidence-basedguidelinesforintensivecan-
cer surveillance based on their mutation status.9 For some pa-
tients, the identification of MMR tumor status and/or gene
mutation(s) provided actionable therapeutic targets for their
current CRC (eg, PARP [poly adenosine diphosphateâ€“ribose
polymerase] inhibitors and anti-PD1 [programmed cell death
protein 1] immunotherapy).24,25 At-risk family members ben-
efited from genetic counseling and cascade testing to deter-
mine the necessity of potentially life-saving cancer surveil-
lance and prevention options.
Multigene panel testing facilitated identification of he-
reditary cancer syndromes in patients who may have other-
wise been missed. Importantly, 24 of 72 patients (33.3%) with
pathogenicmutationsdidnotmeetNCCNGuidelinesforatleast
1 of the gene(s) in which they were found to have a mutation.9
Forty-four of the 72 patients (61.1%) with pathogenic muta-
tions did meet NCCN Guidelines owing to having MMR-
deficient tumors and/or the presence of more than 10 adeno-
matous polyps; however, they likely would have only received
phenotype-specific genetic testing for Lynch syndrome or pol-
yposis had testing been done outside of this study.9 In that sce-
nario, 4 patients (5.6%) would have had at least 1 of their mu-
tations missed without the use of a broad multigene panel.
Three patients with MMR-deficient tumors were found to have
additional mutations in genes that would not have been as-
sessed: 1 had biallelic MUTYH mutations (without polyp-
osis), 1 had a monoallelic MUTYH mutation, and 1 had the APC
c.3920T>A,p.I1307Kmutation.Onepatientwithpolyposis(due
to a known APC mutation) and an MMR-proficient tumor was
unexpectedly found to also have Lynch syndrome caused by
a pathogenic PMS2 mutation.
While many of the detected mutations were in genes with
established CRC risk, 13 of 72 patients (18.1%) had mutations
in genes not traditionally associated with CRC: 3, ATM; 1, ATM/
CHEK2; 2, BRCA1; 4, BRCA2; 1, CDKN2A; and 2, PALB2. Nota-
bly, 6 patients had mutations in BRCA1/2 (known to cause he-
reditary breastâ€“ovarian cancer syndrome [HBOC]). Four
patientswithBRCA1/2mutationsmetNCCNgenetictestingcri-
teria for HBOC, and 2 patients with BRCA1/2 mutations did not
have personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer and
did not meet NCCN genetic testing criteria for HBOC. Previ-
ous studies have reported early-onset CRC in women with
BRCA1 mutations26 and BRCA2 mutations in families with fa-
milial colorectal cancer type X.27 It is possible that these 13 mu-
tations are incidental findings; however, the cancer spec-
trum and penetrance for many well-established and newly
discovered genes will likely be redefined now that multigene
panel testing is becoming more routine.
Another novel aspect of this study was the use of tumor
sequencing to elucidate the etiology of patients with early-
onset CRC with unexplained MMR deficiency and clarify the
pathogenicity of MMR variants of uncertain significance. It
was previously reported that 68% of patients with CRC and
endometrial cancer with unexplained MMR deficiency do not
have Lynch syndrome, and their MMR-deficient tumors were
the result of double somatic MMR mutations.20 In our study,
100% (9/9) of patients with early-onset CRC and unexplained
MMR deficiency were found to have double somatic MMR
mutations (including 2 patients with germline biallelic
MUTYH mutations). This finding has significant clinical
implications and underscores the importance of somatic test-
ing for patients with early-onset CRC and unexplained MMR
deficiency. Traditionally, patients with CRC (particularly
those diagnosed at a young age) with unexplained MMR defi-
ciency would be medically managed as if they had Lynch
syndrome with an unidentifiable germline MMR mutation.
Proving that their MMR deficiency was the result of double
somatic mutations likely means that they do not have Lynch
syndrome and may not need to follow intensive Lynch syn-
drome surveillance guidelines. It is possible that these
patients have something undiscovered that predisposes them
to the development of somatic MMR mutations, but most
likely, their CRC was sporadic and it would be appropriate for
their family members to follow screening guidelines based on
the family history of early-onset CRC. In addition, this is the
first time that we know of that somatic testing was used spe-
cifically to aid in MMR variant reclassification, assisting in
the reclassification of 2 variants among patients with MMR-
deficient tumors.
Limitations
While the recruiting personnel were strongly discouraged
from preferentially enrolling patients with a strong family
history of cancer or young age of diagnosis, it is possible
that this occurred. Patientâ€™
s self-reported family history is a
limitation; medical record review would have ensured accu-
racy but was not feasible. We had 3-generation pedigrees for

patients who tested positive and received genetic counsel-
ing. However, we only had first-degree relative cancer his-
tory for patients who tested negative, so we were unable to
provide complete risk assessment or determine who met
NCCN genetic testing criteria among patients who did not
have a mutation.
The16%prevalenceofhereditarycancersyndromesamong
patients with early-onset CRC reported herein is likely an un-
derestimate for several reasons. There are likely other CRC sus-
ceptibility genes, some of which have not yet been discov-
ered, for which our patients may not have been tested.
Additionally, some of the variants of uncertain significance
may eventually be found to be pathogenic. For example, at
the time of publication there were 2 mutations (CHEK2
c.470T>C, p.I157T and MLH1 c.1897-2A>G) with discrepant
pathogenicity classifications from various clinical laborato-
ries (ranging from variant of uncertain significance to
pathogenic). For this study, they were considered variants
of uncertain significance.
Conclusions
Overall, 75 pathogenic cancer susceptibility gene mutations
were found in 72 patients of 450 diagnosed with CRC younger
than 50 years (16%). While it is important to continue MMR
tumor screening for all patients with CRC for treatment pur-
poses (ie, checkpoint inhibitors, if initial findings are vali-
datedinsubsequenttrials),geneticcounselingandtestingwith
a broad multigene panel should be considered for all patients
with early-onset CRC due to their high prevalence of heredi-
tary cancer syndromes.
