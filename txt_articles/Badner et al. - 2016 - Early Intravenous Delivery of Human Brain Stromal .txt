ABSTRACT
Spinal cord injury (SCI) isa life-threatening condition with multifaceted complications and limited treat-
ment options. In SCI, the initial physical trauma is closely followed by a series of secondary events, in-
cluding inflammation and blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption, which further exacerbate injury.
This secondary pathology is partially mediated by the systemic immune response to trauma, in which
cytokine production leads to the recruitment/activation of inflammatory cells. Because early intrave-
nousdeliveryofmesenchymalstromalcells(MSCs)hasbeenshowntomitigateinflammation invarious
models of neurologic disease, this study aimed to assess these effects in a rat model of SCI (C7-T1, 35-
gram clip compression) using human brain-derived stromal cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reac-
tionforahuman-specificDNAsequencewasusedtoassesscellbiodistribution/clearanceandconfirmed
that only a small proportion (approximately 0.001%–0.002%) of cells are delivered to the spinal cord,
withthemajorityresidinginthelung,liver,andspleen.Intriguingly,althoughcellpopulationsdrastically
declined in all aforementioned organs, there remained a persistent population in the spleen at 7 days.
Furthermore, the cell infusion significantly increased splenic and circulating levels of interleukin-10—
a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Through this suppression of the systemic inflammatory re-
sponse, the cells also reduced acute spinal cord BSCB permeability, hemorrhage, and lesion volume.
These early effects further translated into enhanced functional recovery and tissue sparing 10 weeks
after SCI. This work demonstrates an exciting therapeutic approach whereby a minimally invasive
cell-transplantation procedure can effectively reduce secondary damage after SCI through systemic
immunomodulation. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2016;5:991–1003
SIGNIFICANCE
Central nervous system pericytes (perivascular stromal cells) have recently gained significant atten-
tionwithinthescientificcommunity.Inadditiontobeingrecognizedasmajorplayersinneurotrauma,
pericytes have been discovered to share a common origin and potentially function with traditionally
defined mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Although there have been several in vitro comparisons,
the in vivo therapeutic application of human brain-derived stromal cells has not been previously eval-
uated. This study demonstrates that these cells not only display a MSC phenotype in vitro but also
have similar in vivo immunomodulatory effects after spinal cord injury that are more potent than
those of non-central nervous system tissue-derived cells. Therefore, these cells are of great interest
for therapeutic use in spinal cord injury.
INTRODUCTION
Despiteimprovedmortality andadvancesinmed-
ical management, spinal cord injury (SCI) con-
tinues to result in severe sensorimotor deficits
and a reduced quality of life with limited treat-
ment options. As such, there is a need to advance
our understanding of SCI pathophysiology and
identify novel therapeutic strategies.
SCI occurs in two phases. The primary phase
results from physical trauma, causing immediate
structural disturbance and vascular damage [1].
The secondary phase includes inflammation and
blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption, in-
creasing tissueloss and,consequently, neurologic
dysfunction. Secondary pathology is partially me-
diated by the systemic immune response, in
which production of proteinases and inflamma-
tory cytokines leadstorecruitment andactivation
of peripheral leukocytes [2]. Although some im-
mune cells may have proregenerative and/or
neuroprotective functions [3], it is widely accepted

FETAL AND NEONATAL STEM CELLS
 that therapies aimed at modulating (rather than suppressing)
post-traumatic inflammation are an attractive treatment ap-
proach for acute SCI.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are under investigation
for their immunomodulatory potential [4] in various models
of central nervous system (CNS) disease [5]. In traumatic brain
injury (TBI), early intravenous delivery of MSCs has been report-
ed to mitigate the neuroinflammatory response by altering cy-
tokine production [6–8], as well as recruitment of inflammatory
cells [9–12]. These studies have also highlighted a role for cell
interaction with peripheral immune organs in the inflammatory
response [9, 13, 14], suggesting that local engraftment of trans-
planted MSCs is not necessary for therapeutic efficacy. Overall,
encouraging preclinical results have led to two U.S. Food and
Drug Administration-approved phase 1 safety trials using autol-
ogous bone marrow stromal cells for adult (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier NCT01575470 [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov])and pe-
diatric (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00254722) TBI [15]. It is
hoped that these will successfully translate into clinically mean-
ingful outcomes.
Mixed preclinical results have delayed clinical translation of
MSCs for SCI. Variability among injury model, cell sources, admin-
istration, and transplantation timing has generated controversy
[16] around cell therapy in SCI. Furthermore, the emphasis on cell
survival and engraftment in SCI [17] and the relatively quick clear-
ance of MSCs have led many to abandon their application. Sys-
temic MSC transplantation in SCI has been investigated [10],
but the relationship between transplanted cells and their effects
on the spinal cord has been poorly defined, and the mechanisms
of function are still unclear. To target this gap, this study profiles
donor-cell biodistribution and clearance. Furthermore, this is the
first study to identify a mechanism of systemic immunomodula-
tion for cell-mediated effects within the spinal cord.
The ideal source of cells remains controversial. Evidence
that MSCs can be found in the perivascular niche of most or-
gans [18–20] has sparked debate regarding tissue-source dif-
ferences in therapeutic potential of isolated cells. From an
immunomodulatory perspective, MSCs of varying tissue origin
have differential effects on the inhibition of T-cell proliferation
[21], dendritic cell differentiation [22], and B-cell immunoglob-
ulin production [23].
AlthoughCNSperivascularstromalcells(pericytes)areknown
to be uniquely immunoregulatory [24], their effectiveness for cell
therapy has remained unexplored. Given this, we evaluate
whether CNS-derived stromal cells are better suited to treat
SCI than cells derived from other sources. Hence, the present
study not only addresses whether intravenously delivered stro-
mal cells would alleviate the systemic inflammatory response,
but also compares the efficacy of human fetal brain-derived stro-
mal cells with those from the umbilical cord matrix—an alterna-
tive and ethical human fetal tissue source. Ultimately, we
demonstrate that brain-derived pericytes not only display a
MSCphenotype invitro but alsohavesimilarinvivoimmunomod-
ulatory effects after SCI that lead to better functional recovery
than those of non-CNS tissue-derived cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All animal experiments were approved by the animal care com-
mittee at the University Health Network (Toronto, Ontario, Can-
ada) in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Cell Isolation and Culture
Human umbilical cord matrix cells (HUCMCs) were obtained from
postpartum umbilical cord tissue (Chelsea and Westminster Hos-
pital, London, U.K.). After the removal of veins and arteries, the
Wharton’s jelly (umbilical cord matrix) was diced and treated with
collagenase I and II (1 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Oakwood
Village, OH, https://www.thermofisher.com) for 2 hours at 37°C.
The suspension was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes
before plating the cells on culture T175 flasks (Greiner Bio-One,
Monroe, NC, https://www.gbo.com) in Minimum Essential
Medium Eagle a Modification (a-MEM) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Wisent Bioproducts, St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada,
http://www.wisentbioproducts.com) and 0.1% gentamycin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com).
The human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs; 1200, ScienCell
Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, https://www.sciencellonline.
com) were cultured in pericyte medium (ScienCell Research
Laboratories). The medium was replaced every 3 days, and
the cells were grown to 80% confluence before passaging or
cryogenic storage.
Immunophenotypic Cell Antigen Profiling
At passage 6–7, HUCMCs and HBVPs were cultured in glass cham-
ber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with fibronectin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Once grown to 80%–90% confluence, the cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using
0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked us-
ing 2% FBS (Wisent), and incubated overnight (4°C) with primary
antibodiesfromthemesenchymal cellcharacterization kit(1:500;
SCR067, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, http://www.millipore.
com). Additional primary antibodies applied included mouse
anti-human CD13 (1:500; C8589, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-a
smooth muscle actin (1:300; AB124964, Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
http://www.abcam.com), and rabbit anti-neural/glial antigen 2
(NG2) (1:200; AB5320, EMD Millipore). Slides were subsequently
incubated with secondary antibody and with 49,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1,000) as nuclear counterstain (2 hours, room
temperature). Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
(HBM-MSCs; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, http://www.lonza.com)
were used as a positive control.
Clip-Compression SCI and Tail Vein Infusion of Human
Stromal Cells
Adult (10- to 11-week-old) female Wistar rats (250–300 g) were
used (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, http://www.
criver.com). A combination of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine and
5 ml of saline was administered before surgical SCI. Under
1%–2% isoflurane anesthesia (delivered in a 1:1 mixture of O2/
N2O),alaminectomyattheC7-T1levelwasperformed.A1-minute,
35-g aneurysm clip-compression injury to the cord was then
administered at C7. At 1 hour after SCI, 2.5 million passage-
matched (6–7) stromal cells in 1 ml of Hanks’ buffer/2 mM EDTA
(HE) were slowly infused (200 ml/minute) via the tail vein. Post-
operatively, buprenorphine, amoxicillin trihydrate/clavulanate
potassium, and subcutaneous saline injections (0.9%, 5 ml) were
administered. To reduce rejection, animals were immune-
suppressed with daily subcutaneous cyclosporine injections
(10 mg/kg). Animals were housed individually in standard cages
(at 26°C–27°C), and their bladders were manually expressed.

 In Vivo Very High-Resolution Ultrasound and Power
Doppler Imaging
Invivoveryhigh-resolution ultrasound (VHRUS)andpowerDopp-
ler imaging were performed as previously described [25]. At 1, 3,
and 7 days after injury, animals were anesthetized and placed
on an imaging platform (Vevo Imaging Station, VisualSonics,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada, http://www.visualsonics.com) with
a custom-made stabilization frame. The injury was exposed
through a midline incision andretraction ofthe paraspinal muscle
layers. Ultrasound gel (scanning gel, Medi-Inn, Cameron, Ontario,
Canada, http://info.cfimedical.com) was placed on the dura ma-
terandscannedwiththeVHRUSprobe(44MHz,Vevo770,Visual-
Sonics) in three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler and B-modes.
The 3D B-mode scans were analyzed by using ImageJ software
as previously described [25], with minor modifications. Briefly,
the bright pixels were delineated by three independent blinded
observers within 19 central sagittal image slices and used to gen-
erate a reproducible lesion volume with the TrakEM2 plugin.
The function vascularity (active blood flow) was quantified by
measuring the percent area of power Doppler signal [26] (color
threshold positive pixels) in a standardized spinal cord region
within the image slices. These values were normalized to time-
matched shams and expressed as percentage of sham Doppler
signal. The scan speed was 2.0 mm/second, and the wall filter
was 2.5 mm/second.
Multiorgan DNA Extraction
Based on previous biodistribution profiles of intravenously in-
fused MSCs [27], the heart, lung, liver, kidney, bladder, spleen,
and 5-mm segment of injured spinal cord were collected after cell
transplantation. The tissue samples were snap-frozen on dry ice
after transcardial perfusion (with 250 ml of PBS) and ground into
fine powder by using a mortar and pestle to produce a homoge-
nous sample. Approximately 100 mg of the sample was collected
for DNA extraction. A total of 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris [pH
8.0], 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS) was added to each
sample with 1 mg/ml of Proteinase K and incubated over-
night (65°C). After incubation, the samples were spun down at
14,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected.
A 1-volume equivalent of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1) was added to the supernatant, shaken, and allowed
to settle (1 minute). The samples were again centrifuged at
12,000 rpm (5 minutes), and the aqueous phase was collected.
A total of 4 ml of glycogen (5 mg/ml), 1 ml of ribonuclease, half-
volume equivalent of 7.5 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.5), and
2.5-volume equivalent of 100% alcohol were added to the sam-
ples for overnight incubation at 220°C. Next, samples were
centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes, and the pellet was col-
lected.Thepellet waswashedwith70% alcoholthree times,dried
at room temperature (20 minutes), and resuspended inTris-EDTA
buffer. The amount of DNA was quantified with a NanoDrop spec-
trophotometer (ND-1000; Thermo Scientific).
Multiorgan Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction for Human DNA Detection
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was executed in an
Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, http://www.appliedbiosystems.
com) by using SyBr Green Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life
Sciences, Waltham, MA, http://www.thermofisher.com). A
human-specific sequence of thymidine kinase was used
to generate human primers (forward: 59-ATGCTGATGGG-
TAGGGTG-39, reverse: 59-TGAGTCAGGAGCCAGCGTATG-39).
Reactions were incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed
by 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 seconds and 63.5°C for 1 minute.
Standard curves were generated by serial dilutions of hu-
man DNA in tissue-specific rodent DNA. Total DNA in the
samples was assessed by using primers that amplified both
the human and rodent gene for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (forward: 59-GCAAGAGAGCCCCTCAG-39, reverse:
59-TGTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGTC-39). Because of detected changes
in reaction efficiency between DNA extracted from varying tissue
sources, each organ was run on an independent plate with stan-
dard curves generated from a matched tissue source.
Multiorgan Interleukin-10 Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay
Homogenous tissue samples from the DNA extraction experi-
mentswereusedhere.Proteinwasisolatedfromthespleen,lung,
spinal cord, and liver (10 mg) by using 13 RIPA buffer (20-188;
EMD Millipore) with the Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (78440; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentrations
were quantified by using the microBCA protein assay kit (23235,
Thermo FisherScientific). Once diluted to a protein concentration
of 1 mg/mL, the samples were applied for the rat interleukin-10
(IL-10)enzyme-linkedimmunosorbentassay(ELISA)kit(AB100765;
Abcam) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was
read at 450 nm (Wallac 1420 VICTOR2; PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA, http://www.perkinelmer.com).
Prelabeling Cells (CellTracker Dye) and Multiorgan
Confocal Imaging
A concentration of 5 mM CellTracker Red CMTPX dye (C34552;
Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to label cells before infusion.
The spinal cord, lungs, and spleen were collected after transcar-
dial perfusion with 180 ml of PBS and 60 ml of 4% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA) at 1 day after cell infusion. The tissue was postfixed for
1 day, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (in PBS), embedded in opti-
mal cutting temperate (OCT) medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and cut into 30-mm-thick cross-sections. These tissue sections
were additionally stained with rat endothelial cell antigen 1
(RECA-1) and DAPI (described in immunohistochemistry meth-
ods). Images were taken with the Nikon C2+ confocal laser mi-
croscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan, http://www.nikon.com) at 360.
Tissue Processing and Immunohistochemistry
Animals were transcardially perfused with 180 ml of PBS and an-
other 60 ml of chilled 4% PFA. The tissue was postfixed for 1 day
and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before embedding in OCT
medium (Thermo Scientific). The 1.5-cm-length spinal cord seg-
ments were cut into 30-mm transverse sections. For immunohis-
tochemistry, the slides were dried and rinsed with 13 PBS and
blocked (blocking solution; 2% FBS and 0.1% Triton X in 13
PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies
for anti-mouse RECA-1 (1:250; AbD Serotec, Kidlington, U.K.,
https://www.abdserotec.com) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-
conjugated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (1:100; CLFAD51140,
Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, https://
www.cedarlanelabs.com) were diluted in blocking solution and

 left overnight at 4°C. After three washes (15 minutes), secondary
antibodies were applied as necessary with DAPI (1:1,000).
Quantitative Analysis of Immunohistochemistry: Blood
Vessel Density
Images were taken at 320 on the Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss, Stuttgart, Germany, http://www.zeiss.com).
ImageJ software was used to manually count all RECA1+ blood
vessels on three randomly selected view fields (ventral horn, dor-
sal horn, and lateral column) for each cross-section in a blinded
manner as previously described [28]. The rostro-caudal sampling
was evenly distributed (at 500-nm intervals) along 1 mm of the
spinal cord centered on the injury epicenter. The vessel count val-
ues were pooled, and data were expressed as the percentage of
time-matched sham values. Separate results are presented for
gray matter and white matter.
Evans Blue Assay for BSCB Integrity
Evans Blue (EB) extravasation was quantified through spectro-
photometry as previously described [29] with minor modifica-
tions. Briefly, 1 ml of 2% EB (in PBS) was infused via the
femoral vein and allowed to circulate for 30 minutes before trans-
cardial perfusion with 250 ml of PBS. A total of 5 mm of injured
spinal cord tissue was removed and weighed. The tissue was ho-
mogenized (pulse sonication on ice, 1 minute) in dimethylforma-
mide (D4551; Sigma-Aldrich), incubated at 50°C for 72 hours,
and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (centrifuge 5417, Eppendorf,
Hauppauge, NY, https://www.eppendorf.com). The supernatant
was transferred into a 96-well glass plate (Zeiss), and absorbance
was measured at 620 nm (Wallac 1420VICTOR2; PerkinElmer). EB
concentration was calculated based on a standard curve, and val-
ues were normalized to tissue weight (grams).
Drabkin’s Assay for Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage
Intraspinal hemoglobin was quantified as previously described
[30]. After transcardial perfusion with 250 ml of PBS, 5 mm of
the injured spinal cord was removed and weighed. Samples were
homogenized in 100 ml of distilled water on ice for approximately
1 minute. The homogenates were subsequently spun down at
13,000 rpm for 15 minute, and supernatant was collected. A total
of 20 ml of supernatant was added to 80 ml of Drabkin’s reagent
(Drabkin’sReagentpowder[D5941];Sigma-Aldrich]in1,000mlof
distilled H2O and 0.5 ml of 30% Brij 35 Solution) in a clear 96-well
plate and incubated for 15 minute. Absorbance was read at
560 nm (Wallac 1420 VICTOR2; PerkinElmer), normalized by
weight, and concentration was calculated based on a linear bo-
vine blood hemoglobin (H2500; Sigma-Aldrich) standard curve.
Cytokine Array for Rodent Plasma Analysis
Blood was collected into EDTA-coated Vacutainer tubes (K2 EDTA
Plus Blood Collection Tubes, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, http://
www.bdbiosciences.com) via cardiac puncture before perfusion.
Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (cen-
trifuge 5810R, Eppendorf) for 10 minutes (4°C), and the plasma
wascollected.TheratcytokineR&DELISAProteomeProfilerarray
(ARY008, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, https://www.
rndsystems.com) was used as per manufacturer’s instructions
with minor modifications. Briefly, IRDye 800CW Streptavidin
(926-32230, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, https://www.licor.com) was
used at a 1:2,000 dilution (30 minutes, room temperature) as re-
placement for the kit’s Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to in-
crease detection sensitivity. Proteome array membranes were
scannedonanOdysseyImagerCLx(LI-COR).Thescanswerequan-
tified by using a semiautomated ImageJ macro, in which the 700
channel was applied to generate detection spot coordinates for
mean gray value measurements on the 800 channel. These values
were normalized to time-matched controls and expressed as per-
centage of sham signal.
Lesion Morphometry (10 Weeks After SCI)
Cross-sectional (30 mm) serial sections (n = 4 per group) were
stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) and hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) as previously described [31]. Sections were systematically
sampled at every 300 mm over 5,400 mm, and unbiased measure-
ments weremadewith aCavalieriprobeusingStereoInvestigator
(MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, http://www.mbfbioscience.com)
for lesional tissue, gray matter, and white matter percent area.
Long-Term Neurobehavioral Assessment (10 Weeks
after SCI)
All neurobehavioral assessments were performed weekly for 10
weeks after SCI (vehicle, n = 11; HUCMC, n = 11; HVBPs, n = 10)
by examiners blinded to experimental group. Forelimb motor
function was assessed with a grip strength meter (SDI Grip
Strength System, model DFM-10; San Diego Instruments, San
Diego, CA, http://www.sandiegoinstruments.com) as previously
described [32].
Whole-body limb function and trunk stability was evaluated
with the inclined plane test [33]. Rats were placed on a horizontal
plane and the incline angle was incrementally raised until they
werenolonger abletomaintain theirposition. Hind-limblocomo-
tionwasassessed byusingthe 22-point(0–21) Basso,Beattie,and
Bresnahan (BBB) Locomotor Rating Scale as previously described
[34].
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative data are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Differences
amonggroupswereassessedbyone-andtwo-wayanalysisofvar-
iance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s (for profiling data) or Tukey’s (for
cell comparisons) post hoc tests (statistically significant at p #
.05). Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Soft-
ware Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA, http://www.graphpad.com).
RESULTS
Immunophenotypic Cell Antigen Profile
HUCMCs and HBVPs were screened for mesenchymal (STRO-1,
CD44, CD105, and CD146) and pericyte (CD13, NG2, and
a-smooth muscle actin [a-SMA]) markers at passage 6–7 and
80%–90% confluence (Fig. 1). Commercially available HBM-
MSCs were used as a positive staining control. Although the
marker expression was similar between HUCMCs and HBVPs,
HUCMCs did not express a-SMA (Fig. 1).
Biodistribution and Clearance of Intravenously
Delivered Stromal Cells
After cell infusion, the temporal biodistribution of transplanted
cells was assessed with quantitative reverse-transcription

 polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for a human-specific se-
quence (Fig. 2) in spinal cord as well as the heart, lungs, liver, kid-
neys, spleen, and bladder. As mentioned, real-time PCRs were
run independently for each organ with tissue-specific standard
curves. No human DNA was detected in the heart and bladder,
with only trace amounts in the kidneys. At 1 day after SCI, the ma-
jority of human DNA signal (converted to approximate number of
human cells) [27] was found in the lungs followed by the liver.
There were 355.3 6 74.8 HUCMCs and 180 6 100.1 HBVPs per
million rat cells in the lungs, compared with 35.9 6 5.9 HUCMCs
and 17.7 6 2.7 HBVPs per million rat cells in the liver. Although
most organs had no detectable human DNA by 7 days after SCI,
there were 175.3 6 30.5 HUCMCs and 298.2 6 65.5 HBVPs per
million rat cells in the spleen. To validate the quantitative poly-
merase chain reaction signal, HUCMCs were labeled with Cell-
Tracker Red CMTPX dye before infusion after SCI, and the
tissue was collected for immunohistochemistry 1 day after SCI.
Many of these were detected as clusters within blood vessels
(RECA-1+ cells) of the lungs (Fig. 2E). Within the liver and spleen,
there were significantly fewer cells present, and they were dis-
persed among the tissue (Fig. 2F, 2G).
Circulating Cytokine Changes After Intravenous Stromal
Cell Infusion After SCI
Of 29 cytokines evaluated with the R&D ELISA Proteome Profiler
array (Fig. 3), only plasma IL-10 had significantly increased levels
after HUCMC (0.42- 6 0.15-fold change, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
post hoc, p = .016) and HBVP (0.44- 6 0.06-fold change, one-way
ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc, p = .013) infusion (Fig. 3). Although only
lipopolysaccharide-inducedCXCchemokine(LIX;CXCL5)wassignif-
icantly affected by infusion of HBVPs (one-way ANOVA, p = .04),
thymus chemokine/CXCL7 and regulated on activation, normal
T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5 showed trends
toward increased (one-way ANOVA, p = .06) and decreased
(one-way ANOVA, p = .06) levels between the vehicle control
and HBVPs, respectively. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotei-
nase 1 (TIMP-1) levels (one-way ANOVA, p = .07) showed an in-
creasing trend after HUCMC (0.12- 6 0.01-fold change) and
HBVPs (0.14- 6 0.014-fold change) infusioncompared with the ve-
hicle control (0.05-6 0.04-fold change).
ToidentifythetissuesourceofIL-10synthesisandreleaseresult-
ing from stromal cell infusion, IL-10 changes were evaluated in the
organs retaining transplanted cells (Fig. 3F). Only the spleen had a
significant rise in IL-10 after HUCMC (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post
hoc, p = .03) and HBVP (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc, p = .01)
infusion. There was also a trend toward (one-way ANOVA, p = .068)
preservation of spleen mass 3 days after SCI (Fig. 3G).
Stromal Cells Reduce BSCB Permeability, Hemorrhage,
and Acute Lesion Volume
To identify the timing of secondary vascular pathology, BSCB per-
meability, hemorrhage, and lesion volume were profiled (Figs. 4

 Dunnett’s post hoc, p , .0001), respectively. The lesion volume,
as measured by VHRUS, reached maximum at 2 days after SCI
(26.5 6 2.1 mm3), only slightly larger than at 1 day after SCI
(20.7 6 1.0 mm3). Based on the profiling results, the effects of in-
travenous stromal cell delivery on vascular pathology were
assessed at 1 day after SCI. The vehicle control (29.41 6 1.38
34 mg/ml EB per gram of wet tissue) had significantly (p , .01)
more vascular permeability than HUCMC-infused (24.58 6
0.87 mg/ml EB per gram of wet tissue) or HBVP-infused
(23.91 mg/ml EB per gram of wet tissue) animals. Similarly, cell in-
fusion (338.5 6 24.2 and 318.7 6 20.6 ml of blood per gram of wet
tissue for HUCMC and HBVPs, respectively) reduced (p , .01) the
amount of hemorrhaging in the spinal cord relative to the vehicle
control (493.1 6 18.0 ml of blood per gram of wet tissue).
Changes in lesion volume were evaluated via VHRUS at 1, 3,
and 7 days after SCI (Fig. 5). Although there was a significant dif-
ference between cell-infused and vehicle control animals at each
time point, the most striking effects were found at 3 days. The

Stromal Cells Improve Functional Vascularity With No
Effect on Blood Vessel Density After SCI
Afterthesignificanteffectsofintravenousstromalcellinfusionon
vascular integrity, vessel function was evaluated by using 3D
power Doppler imaging with VHRUS at 1, 3, and 7 days after
SCI (Fig. 6). Consistent with previous results, vascular function
was significantly (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc, p = .014)
preserved with HBVPs (79.4 6 8.3% of sham signal) compared
with the vehicle control (50.5 6 4.1% of sham signal) at 1 day. Al-
though the effect of HUCMCs did not reach statistical significance
(one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc, p = .09), the mean power
Doppler functional vascularity (72.8 6 8.4% of sham signal)
was considerably greater than in controls. Because there was nat-
uralrecoveryoffunctionalvascularityat3and7daysafterSCI,cell
effects were lost at these time points.
To further assess whether detected vascular differences were
a result of anatomical changes after stromal cell infusion, the
number of vessels was quantified with immunohistochemistry
for RECA-1. Although there was a decrease in the number of ves-
sels at 1 day after injury compared with laminectomy-only con-
trols, there was no difference in gray or white matter vessel
counts between the groups (Fig. 6).
Stromal Cell Infusion Enhances Functional Recovery
and Tissue Sparing
We examined long-term functional recovery after stromal cell infu-
sion using standardized behavioral tests (Fig. 7B–7D). Both cell types
significantly (two-way ANOVA, p , .0001) enhanced the restoration
of grip strength (Fig. 7B). As early as 3 weeks after SCI, HUCMC
(970.8 6 73.5 g) and HBVP-treated (1,225.2 6 32.8 g) animals
had significantly (Tukey’s post hoc test, p , .05) improved grip
strength compared with vehicle controls (753.6 6 38.5 g). Interest-
ingly,HBVPsuniquelyimproved(two-wayANOVA,p,.0001)whole-

inclined plane test (Fig. 7C). HBVPs also improved hind-limb loco-
motion,assessedwiththeBBBscale(Fig.7D).At10weeksafterSCI,
HBVP-treated animals obtained an average BBB score of 11.35 6

 tissue changes at 10 weeks after SCI(Fig. 7E, 7F). Reduced lesional
tissue and increased white matter sparing was observed 300 mm
rostro-caudal and 600 mm rostral to the injury epicenter in cell-
treated animals (two-way ANOVA, p , .05). Preservation of gray
matter was observed rostral to the injury (1,200–1,800 mm). Be-
cause our injury model spans the boundary between cervical and
thoracic levels, it is interesting that gray matter sparing was re-
stricted to the more vascularized cervical region.
DISCUSSION
Here, we demonstrate that early intravenous infusion of human
stromal cells for SCI has protective effects on blood vessels. De-
spite limited engraftment and rapid clearance of cells, the infu-
sion increased levels of circulating and splenic IL-10. Moreover,
cell transplantation reduced EB extravasation and hemorrhaging
within the acutely injured spinal cord. Although there were no
changes in the number of perilesional blood vessels, HBVPs im-
proved functional vascularity and plasma LIX levels. Further-
more, HBVPs enhanced recovery of whole-body coordination
and trunk stability, as well as locomotion. Both cell types led
to similar improvements in grip strength. These results provide
evidence that stromal cells may mitigate secondary vascular pa-
thology through modulation of the systemic inflammatory re-
sponse. Furthermore, differences between results from HUCMCs
and HBVPs indicate cell source-dependent variations in immu-
nomodulatory potential. Although pericytes have been investi-
gated therapeutically in heart disease [35, 36] and retinal
vasculopathy [37], this is the first assessment of human brain-
derived pericytes for SCI. In addition to being the first study
to examine any stromal cell source in a cervical injury, it is also
one of the only studies to address the knowledge gap regarding
low cell engraftment at the lesion, quick cell clearance, and lo-
calized spinal cord effects.
Investigation of high thoracic/cervical-level injuries is
important for clinical translation. Because high-level injuries
disrupt the innervation of lymphoid tissue [38], they lead to al-
tered immune function and an inflammatory response distinct
from the lower-level injuries most commonly studied [39–41].
Splenicinnervation,inparticular,hasbeenshownto regulatecy-
tokine production/release [42], as well as leukocyte activation
[43] during inflammation. Furthermore, because the spleen
has been previously implicated as a site of MSC function
[9, 44], we were interested in splenic cell localization (Fig. 2)
and effects on spleen atrophy (Fig. 3). In TBI, Walker et al. dem-
onstrated that a primitive form of BM-MSCs was found in
the spleen within 6 hours of intravenous injection [9]. They
further showed that cell infusion reduced spleen atrophy and in-
creasedCD4+T-cellproliferationaswellasIL-4andIL-10produc-
tion in splenocytes [9]. Because reductions in spleen mass have
been attributed to the release of spleen-derived immune cells
[45], these results, combined with the production of splenic
anti-inflammatory cytokines, support the conclusion that trans-
planted MSCs can modulate the immunologic response. Inter-
estingly, here, splenic human DNA signal peaked at 7 days
after SCI (for both cell types), and there was a trend toward
spleen mass preservation after cell infusion (at 3 days after
SCI; Fig. 3). Furthermore, although we found CellTracker-labeled
HUCMCs in the spleen 1 day after SCI (Fig. 2), it is unclear whether
the cells gradually accumulate in the spleen to peak at 7 days.
Therefore, despite ample evidence of splenic involvement in SCI
and MSC mechanisms independently, their exact relationship re-
mains unclear and will be the subject of future studies.
Intravenous Stromal Cells for Vascular Protection
Consistent with our EB extravasation results, the literature re-
ports improvements in acute vascular integrity after CNS trauma
with systemic infusion of rodent [10, 46–48] and human stromal
cells [6, 8, 9]. Reductions in lesion volume [49], especially in the
early phases of injury [50], have also been described. Although
multiple mechanisms are likely implicated, the two best-
described molecular mediators to date have been TIMP-3 [6]

 and tumor necrosis factor-a-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) [8]. In
2012, Menge et al. demonstrated that increasedlevels of circulat-
ing human TIMP-3 after human MSC infusion led to preservation
of the blood-brain barrier after TBI [6]. They also showed that en-
dogenous TIMP-3 production was significantly increased in the
lungs and spleen, which suggests that, despite transient cell en-
graftment, organs can have an altered inflammatory response
[6]. Although we did not measure changes in TIMP-3 here, we
found a trend (two-way ANOVA, p = .07) toward increased levels
of circulating TIMP-1 with cell infusion (HUCMCs and HBVPs).
Alternatively, Watanabe et al. replicated the effects on de-
creasing blood-brain barrier permeability with systemic adminis-
tration of TSG-6 [8]. They demonstrated that both treatments
reducedneutrophilinfiltrationattheinjurysite[8]andimplicated
this as a potential mechanism of action. Although a significant dif-
ference in neutrophils within the spinal cord was not found here
(supplemental online Fig. 1), we did detect an increase of rodent
IL-10 in plasma (Fig. 3). Despite reports of raised IL-10 levels after
stromal cell delivery in various disease models [51–55], systemic
changes in IL-10 have not been previously implicated as the pri-
mary mechanism by which MSCs lead to neuroprotection.
Systemic IL-10 Is Neuroprotective in SCI
Several studies have evaluated IL-10 in CNS trauma [56]. Brewer
et al. demonstrated that intravenous infusion of IL-10 reduced le-
sion size and neuronal death after SCI [57]. Interestingly, the au-
thors found that intraspinal administration exacerbated the
damage [57]. This suggested that IL-10 benefits might uniquely
target the systemic response to neurotrauma. Knoblach and
Faden confirmed these findings by showing that vascular admin-
istration of IL-10 after TBI improved neurological recovery,
whereas delivery into the cerebral ventricles had no positive ef-
fects [58]. Together, these results are in agreement with our find-
ings, in which increased levels of circulating IL-10 and related
vascular effects do not coincide with changes in spinal cord IL-
10 levels (Fig. 4). There is also evidence that systemic IL-10 may
selectively target endothelial cells [59]. Through inhibition of
monocyte adhesion to vasculature, IL-10 can reduce the expres-
sion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and therefore the
degradation of the vascular basement membrane. Future work
should include assessment of monocyte adhesion and changes
in MMP activity. Overall, there is convincing evidence that IL-
10 has neuroprotective effects in CNS injuries, highlighting a po-
tential therapeutic mechanism of our cell infusion.
Differences Between HUCMCs and HBVPs
Recognized as major players in CNS trauma [60], pericytes have
been discovered to share a common origin [13] with traditionally
defined MSCs. This has led to growing interest in pericytes for cell
therapy and regenerative medicine [61].
Although HUCMCs and HBVPs had largely similar effects on
acute spinal cord pathology, there were notable differences. HBVPs
uniquely decreased levels of plasma LIX/CXCL5 and displayed a
trendtowardraisedthymuschemokine(CXCL7,p=.06)levels.There
was also a trend toward a reduction in circulating RANTES (p = .06)
and an improvement in functional vascularity at 1 day after SCI.
Moreover, long-term functional recovery was greater with
HBVP-infusion. Only HBVPs led to improvements on the inclined

 plane test and BBB scores. As a result, it is possible that HBVPs
may have other immunomodulatory effects outside of our detec-
tion, which would result in improved recovery after SCI. Further-
more, although HBVPs have availability and ethical limitations
compared with HUCMCs, advances in induced-pluripotent stem
cell technologies may have the potential to create patient-
specific cells in the future.
Technical Considerations
The rapid growth in MSC research and the clinical and commercial
potential of these cells has led researchers to seek highly specific
characteristics/functions from a diverse range of tissues [62].
However, artifacts in isolation procedures, culture conditions,
and general cell heterogeneity have limited progress [63]. Our
work, which involves cell source comparisons, is susceptible to
these limitations. Principally to maintain cell identity, HUCMCs
and HBVPs were grown in cell-specific medium. Although this
may be a confounding factor [64], we performed extensive an-
tigenic profiling (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all cells were passage-
matched at infusion and batch-randomized.
CONCLUSION
With growing developments in MSC applications, recognizing
the optimal cell source for CNS conditions is vital to clinical
translation. We show that a minimally invasive intravenous
stromal cell transplantation procedure can mitigate secondary
pathology. Despite low cell engraftment in the spinal cord, sig-
nificant systemic changes in inflammatory cytokines occurred
after cell infusions, likely facilitated through splenic changes. A
significant rise in splenic IL-10 and a trend toward preservation
of spleen mass further suggest that this is a major site of cell-
mediated immunomodulation. The early protective effects
also resulted in enhanced functional recovery and tissue
preservation after SCI. Together, these data warrant further
study of the splenic role in secondary pathology and cell-
based reparative mechanisms for future clinical translation.
