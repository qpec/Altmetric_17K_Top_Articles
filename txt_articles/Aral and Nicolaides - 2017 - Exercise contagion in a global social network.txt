Exercise contagion in a global social network
Sinan Aral1 & Christos Nicolaides1
We leveraged exogenous variation in weather patterns across geographies to identify social
contagion in exercise behaviours across a global social network. We estimated these
contagion effects by combining daily global weather data, which creates exogenous variation
in running among friends, with data on the network ties and daily exercise patterns of B1.1M
individuals who ran over 350M km in a global social network over 5 years. Here we show that
exercise is socially contagious and that its contagiousness varies with the relative activity of
and gender relationships between friends. Less active runners influence more active runners,
but not the reverse. Both men and women influence men, while only women influence other
women. While the Embeddedness and Structural Diversity theories of social contagion
explain the influence effects we observe, the Complex Contagion theory does not. These
results suggest interventions that account for social contagion will spread behaviour change
more effectively.

isciplines as diverse as economics1, sociology2, medicine3,
computer science4, political science5 and physics6 have
recently become interested in the interdependence of
behaviours across the human social network. In particular,
scientists have begun to ask whether our health7 and other
behaviours8 are contagious, in that our decisions and actions
affect the decisions and actions of our peers. If behavioural
contagions exist, understanding how, when and to what extent
they manifest in different behaviours will enable us to transition
from independent intervention strategies to more effective
interdependent interventions that incorporate individuals’ social
contexts into their treatments9. Although this line of inquiry has
tremendous potential to improve social, economic and business
policy, its scientific advancement has been hindered by three
distinct empirical challenges.
First, although correlations in the behaviours and outcomes of
socially connected individuals are ubiquitous, causal social
influence effects are harder to identify. Early work demonstrated
correlations in human behaviour in network space and time3,7,8,
signaling the possibility that health behaviours cascade through
social
interactions.
But,
subsequent
investigations
revealed
multiple statistical challenges to identifying causal peer effects
in networks, including homophily (the tendency for individuals
to choose similar friends10,11), confounding effects (the tendency
for connected individuals to be exposed to the same external
stimuli), simultaneity (the tendency for connected individuals to
co-influence each other) and other factors12–14. Recent work
has addressed some of these challenges by developing new
observational10 and experimental15–19 techniques. However,
observational techniques struggle to overcome the confounding
effects of unobservable factors20, while experimental studies,
which provide more robust causal inference, are complex, difficult
to implement and therefore more rare. To scale up scientific
investigations of peer effects, we advocate for the exploitation of
naturally occurring (rather than experimentally created) random
variation across network ties to identify causal social influence.
The generalization of such methods to the study of peer effects
could not only identify causal peer influence across behaviours
but also extend the effectiveness of causal inference in networked
studies beyond strictly experimental settings.
Second, studies of social contagion currently suffer from
substantial measurement error. On the one hand, survey-based
studies, which elicit data about meaningful offline health
behaviours such as smoking, obesity or happiness, rely on
infrequent and often inaccurate21,22 self-reports of behaviours
and outcomes3,7,8. On the other hand, experiments, which are
easier to conduct digitally, are almost exclusively applied to less
tangible and less potentially meaningful online behaviours, such
as the adoption and use of social applications17,18, clicking on
social advertisements23, the virality of internet memes24 or the
use of positive or negative emotive language in digital status
updates25. These behaviours may not proxy well for the more
tangible, costly, offline health behaviours that meaningfully
impact public health. Between these two extremes lies an
important alternative approach that aims to provide precise,
granular measurement, not of digital behaviours such as clicks or
shares but of more consequential, offline health behaviours, such
as diet or exercise. The coming wave of quantified self and fitness
tracking data, of the type we employ here, collected by wearable
devices that record detailed exercise activities time stamped to the
second, will likely advance and accelerate the effectiveness of this
alternative approach dramatically.
Third, current causal social influence research has limited
generalizability. While field experiments have taught us much
about the foundations of population-scale peer effects and their
consequences, they constrain us to focus on behaviours we can
easily randomize, such as the receipt of digital notifications17–19
or the social information contained in display advertisements23,
limiting our scope of inquiry to a small set of specific, narrow
conditions and behaviours. Increased experimental control in the
laboratory, on the other hand, enables tests of conditions that
are difficult to manipulate in the real world, such as the
network structure in which individuals are embedded16,26. But,
it is unknown whether these results generalize because the
relationships that individuals are randomly assigned to in the
laboratory are typically artificial. If the study of social influence is
to impact public health, we must overcome these limitations
by examining generalized peer effects, such as the effect of
individuals’ overall exercise behaviours on their friends, in data
on actual exercise behaviours and real relationships interacting in
their natural states. It is in precisely these settings that
experimentation is hardest.
Our analysis of the precisely recorded daily exercise patterns of
over a million people who ran over 350 million (M) km in a
global social network of runners over 5 years showed that exercise
is socially contagious and that its contagiousness varies with the
relative activity levels of and gender relationships between friends.
Less active runners influence more active runners, while the
reverse is not true. Both men and women influence men, while
only women influence other women. While the Embeddedness
and Structural Diversity theories of social contagion explain the
influence
effects
we
observed,
evidence
for
the
Complex
Contagion theory is mixed.
Results
Naive contagion estimates. We estimated social contagion in the
exercise behaviours of runners worldwide in a data set that
precisely records the geographic locations, social network ties
and daily running patterns of B1.1M individuals, who ran
B359M km in a global social network of runners over 5 years.
Following Aral12, we define the magnitude of peer effects or
contagion in exercise behaviour (which we also refer to as social
influence, social contagion, behavioural contagion and network
contagion) as the degree to which the exercise behaviours of one’s
peers change the likelihood that or extent to which one engages in
those behaviours. The data contain the daily distance, duration
and pace of, as well as calories burned during, runs undertaken by
these individuals, as recorded by a suite of digital fitness-tracking
devices. The data also track B3.4M social network ties formed
among runners to connect and keep track of each other’s running
behaviours. We analyse the B2.1M ties in the network for which
we can geographically locate and find weather information for
both nodes connected by a tie. Ties in this network link runners
who follow each other’s running habits. Running information was
not self-reported. When a run was completed, it was immediately
digitally shared with a runner’s friends. Runners could not choose
which runs they shared but rather comprehensively shared all
new running information with their friends upon connecting
their device to the platform.
These data give us unique insight into the daily, coevolving
running and social network patterns of these individuals over
5 years. For example, when we examined progressively more
sophisticated models of the correlations between an individual’s
(also called ego’s) running behaviour and that of his or her
friends (also called peers) (we use the terms friends and peers
interchangeably throughout the paper), we found strong evidence
of the possibility of social contagion in running behaviours in
both model-free correlations and ordinary least squares (OLS)
models that control for time invariant and time varying
characteristics of individuals and their peers, including gender,
height, weight, degree, device type and country. In the OLS

 models, an additional kilometre run by peers was associated with
an additional 6/10th of a kilometre run by ego and an additional
10 min run by peers was associated with an additional 5.3 min run
by ego (see ‘Comparison of IV Estimates with an OLS Model’ in
Supplementary Note 3 for more detail).
Unfortunately, these estimates are only suggestive because
they are subject to the well-known endogeneity biases created
by homophily, confounding effects, simultaneity and other
factors. We therefore focus our analysis on a natural experiment
created by exogenous variation in global weather patterns
across
geographies.
Our
approach
leverages
an
inference
technique called the instrumental variables (IV) framework,
which disentangles endogeneity by using exogenous variation
created by natural events as a shock to one endogenous variable
to estimate its causal effect on another variable (see the Methods
section for more detail).
IV estimation. The results of our IV analysis revealed strong
contagion effects: on the same day, on average, an additional
kilometre run by friends influences ego to run an additional
3/10th of a kilometre (Fig. 1a); an additional kilometre per
minute run by friends influences ego to run an additional 3/10th
of a kilometre per minute faster (Fig. 1b); an additional 10 min
run by friends influences ego to run 3 min longer (Fig. 1c); and an
additional 10 calories burned by friends influences ego to burn
three and a half additional calories (Fig. 1d). This peer influence
diminishes over time, with friends’ running today influencing ego
less tomorrow and the day after for every measure.
Peer effects in exercise behaviours are both statistically and
socially significant. Suppose, for example, that a runner (A)
usually runs 6 km at a pace of 7 min km � 1 (0.143 km min � 1)
and their friend (B) usually runs 6 km at a pace of 8 min km � 1
(0.125 km min � 1). An extra kilometre run by B (an increase from
6 to 7 km) causes A to increase their running distance by 0.3 km
(from 6 to 6.3 km). Also, a 0.01 km min � 1 increase in runner B’s
pace (from 0.125 to 0.135 km min � 1) causes runner A to increase
their pace by 0.003 km min � 1 (from 0.143 to 0.146 km min � 1).
The results in Fig. 1 also summarize the dangers of model
misspecification in the estimation of peer effects. Naive models
that do not account for endogeneity biases created by homophily,
confounding effects, simultaneity and other factors dramatically
overestimate social spillovers. As the table in Fig. 1e shows, OLS
models that control for ego’s (Xit) and peers’ Xp

time varying
and time invariant characteristics (including age, gender, height,
weight, degree, device type and country) but that do not
implement the IV identification strategy overestimate social
influence by between 72% and 81%.
Contagion heterogeneity. Peer effects in running are also het-
erogeneous across relationship types. For example, runners are
more influenced by peers whose performance is slightly worse,
but not far worse, than their own as well as by those who perform
slightly better, but not far better, than they do (Fig. 2a). Moreover,
less active runners influence more active runners more than more
active runners influence less active runners (Fig. 2b). These
results are corroborated by heterogeneity across consistent and
inconsistent runners. Inconsistent runners influence consistent
runners more than consistent runners influence inconsistent
runners (Fig. 2c). Social comparisons may provide an explanation
for these results. Festinger’s social comparison theory proposes
that we self-evaluate by comparing ourselves to others27. But,
in the context of exercise, a debate exists about whether we make
upward comparisons to those performing better than ourselves28
or downward comparisons to those performing worse than
ourselves29. Comparisons to those ahead of us may motivate our
own self-improvement, while comparisons to those behind us
may create ‘competitive behaviour to protect one’s superiority’
(27, p. 126). Our findings are consistent with both arguments, but
the effects are much larger for downward comparisons than for
upward comparisons.
We also found strong evidence that social influence depends on
gender relations. Influence among same sex pairs is strong, while
influence among mixed sex pairs is statistically significantly
weaker (Fig. 2d inset). Men strongly influence men, and women
moderately influence both men and women. But, men do not
influence women at all (Fig. 2d). This may be due to gender
differences in the motivations for exercise and competition. For
example, men report receiving and being more influenced by
social support in their decision to adopt exercise behaviours,
while women report being more motivated by self-regulation and
individual planning30. Moreover, men may be more competitive
and specifically more competitive with each other. Experimental
evidence suggests that women perform less well in mixed gender
competition than men, even though they perform equally well in
non-competitive or single sex competitive settings31.

 contagions. Centola and Macy32 argue that complex contagions,
involving costly behaviours, require multiple reinforcing signals
of adoption from different peers to induce behaviour change and
suggest that clustered social networks are therefore more likely
to spread a complex contagion from one neighborhood to
another. Centola16 goes on to predict that in real-world health
behaviours such as exercise, which are more costly in terms of
‘time, deprivation, or even physical pain’, the need for social
reinforcement should be greater than in his own study of less
costly online health behaviours. In contrast, Ugander et al.33
suggest that structural diversity, measured by the number of
unconnected clusters (called ‘components’) with at least one
adopter, not the number of distinct peers, is the critical structural
factor
moderating
influence.
Aral
and
Walker34,
on
the
other hand, suggest that embeddedness (the number of mutual
connections), rather than the number of unconnected clusters,
is
what
drives
behavioural
contagions.
We
tested
these
three structural theories of social contagion by examining how
contagion in running varied across different network structures
(see ‘Testing Structural Theories of Social Contagion’ section
in Supplementary Note 2 and ‘Structural Theories of Social
Contagion’ in Supplementary Note 3 for details).
We found strong evidence confirming both the Structural
Diversity and Embeddedness theories of social contagion, but the
evidence for Complex Contagion was mixed. Social influence
coefficients under the Complex Contagion theory (which argues
that the number of active friends is the key driver of diffusion
for complex contagions) and the Structural Diversity theory
(which argues that the number of active network components is
the key driver of diffusion) are statistically significantly different
(t-statistic ¼ 15.9, N ¼ 9.9M). The number of distinct friends who
run is positively correlated with social influence when analysed
alone (Fig. 3a), but this correlation disappears and becomes
negative when we control for the structural diversity of the
behaviourally active peer group (Fig. 3b). At the same time, the
structural diversity of peer group activation (the number of
unconnected network components that exhibit running) strongly
predicts greater positive social contagion effects, even when we
control for the number of distinct friends who run (Fig. 3b). This
replicates the results of Ugander et al.33, who found that, for the
social diffusion of Facebook, the number of active friends predicts
Facebook adoption but that this correlation disappears and
becomes negative when controlling for the structural diversity
of Facebook adopting friends. We describe the evidence for
Complex Contagion as mixed because the theory defines a
complex contagion as one that exhibits adoption thresholds
greater than one, meaning more than one adopter friend is
required for transmission, and suggests that clustering in
behavioural adoption is more conducive to the spread of
complex contagions. Our findings show that contagion occurs
even with only one adopter friend and that unconnected adopter
friends, rather than connected adopter friends, are more likely to
transmit exercise behaviours. These results suggest that exercise is
not a complex contagion, but they do not invalidate Complex
Contagion theory as other behaviours may indeed exhibit
complex contagion dynamics.

 The data also confirm that the embeddedness of a relationship
(the number of mutual friends between contacts) strongly
moderates social influence and contagion in running behaviours
(Fig. 3c), confirming the Embeddedness theory. Unlike Complex
Contagion and Structural Diversity, the Embeddedness theory
does not make predictions about the social structure of adopting
friends but rather about the social structure surrounding a
transmission, whether or not that structure contains other
adopting friends. The embeddedness of a relationship, measured
by the number of mutual friends a dyad shares, can promote
behavioural contagion because of the social monitoring that
embedded relationships facilitate. When two people have many
mutual
friends,
there
are
greater
opportunities
for
social
sanctions, reputational consequences for misbehaviour and social
rewards for positive behaviours. Mutual friends may therefore
provide an added incentive to keep up with running buddies
because shirking is widely observed in a set of mutually
reinforcing relationships.
Discussion
Scientists have recently made great strides in understanding social
contagion using longitudinal surveys and narrowly designed
digital experiments. But, if we are to develop a robust, general-
izable and precisely measured understanding of human health
interdependence, we must pursue an alternative approach that
examines generalized peer effects in data on actual behaviours
and real relationships interacting in their natural states. Our work
takes this approach to estimate social contagion in exercise
behaviour by examining detailed, daily exercise behaviours and
social network ties among B1.1M runners worldwide. We found
that exercise is socially contagious, revealing a behavioural
mechanism that could explain the correlations in obesity and
happiness found in earlier work7,8. These results suggest that
social intervention strategies, which account for peer effects, may
spread behaviour change in networks more effectively than
policies that ignore social spillovers9. The work also implies
several avenues for future research.
First, the granularity and precision with which fitness tracking
devices record real-world health behaviours portends a sea
change in our understanding of human behaviour and social
influence at scale. Compared with prior studies, which relied on
imprecise and frequently inaccurate self-reports, the potential for
these kinds of data to extend our understanding of social
behaviour in real-world settings is difficult to overstate. Although
there are limitations to the use of these kinds of data, in many
respects they enable significant advances in the fidelity of
observation and therefore the precision of the science.
Second,
the
analysis
of
heterogeneous
treatment
effects
suggests the broad importance of not focussing exclusively on
average social effects. Different subsegments of the population
react differently to social influence. Such differences suggest
that policies tailored for different types of people in different
subpopulations will be more effective than policies constructed
with
only
average
treatment
effects
in
mind.
In
fact,
if subpopulations experience countervailing treatment effects,
then average treatment effects may be zero even though different
people are experiencing strong and significant social effects in
opposite directions.
Third, the work points to the importance of examining theories
of social contagion in real-world settings. Although laboratory
experiments are instrumental to our understanding of social
phenomena and help us reason about what types of effects are
possible, people may not behave the same way in naturalistic
settings as they do in the laboratory. It is therefore important to
empirically examine competing theories of social contagion in the
field. Such work is essential, not just in testing the validity of the
theory in the real world but also in obtaining precise estimates of
social contagion that provide more realistic projections of the
outcomes of social and behavioural policy interventions.
Methods
IV framework. We estimated social contagion in exercise behaviours and avoided
well-known empirical challenges in estimating causal peer effects by combining the
running and social network data of B1.1M individuals who ran over 350M km in a
global social network of runners over 5 years with records of the daily global
temperature and precipitation patterns experienced by these same individuals over
time, recorded by over 47,000 weather stations in 196 countries. Similar to natural
experiments35, our approach leverages an inference technique developed by applied
econometricians to identify causal effects across a variety of phenomena, including

Panel (a) estimates the social influence effects of the number of distinct friends that run and the number of distinct components of friends that run
independently, in separate regressions (separated by the dotted line). Panel (b) directly compares, in the same regression, the number of distinct friends
that run (supporting Complex Contagion theory) and the number of distinct network components of friends that run (supporting Structural Diversity
theory) as structural moderators of social influence effects. The positive estimate for the number of distinct network components of friends that run and
the negative estimate for the number of distinct friends that run, when both are analysed together in (b), supports the Structural Diversity theory. Panel (c)
tests whether embedded dyadic relationships with mutual friends transmit influence more effectively than relationships with no mutual friends (supporting
Embeddedness theory). The social influence coefficient estimated for embedded relationships (Regression 2) is statistically significantly greater than the
social influence coefficient estimated for non-embedded relationships (Regression 1) (t-statistic ¼ 2.45, N ¼ 10.7M). Bars are 95% confidence intervals.

between precipitation in New York and Chicago at time t and precipitation in the rest of the United States at time t, t þ 1, t þ 2 and t þ 3. White colouring
indicates no correlation, while progressively darker green colouring indicates proportionally stronger correlations. Panel (b) displays daily correlations
between running activity per capita and binary indicators of rainfall above the annual average and temperature o35� or 485� in New York and Chicago,
respectively. At nearly each spike in rainfall or extreme temperature, running declines markedly, visually demonstrating the strength of the instruments at
the daily level. Panel (c) displays running activity per capita on the y axis and precipitation in millimetres on the x axis, while (d) displays running activity
per capita on the y axis and temperature in degrees Fahrenheit on the x axis for the top 15 running cities in the United States during the 5-year period.
These two panels show strong correlations between the weather and running behaviour and demonstrate that the correspondence of precipitation and
temperature to running display different functional forms, necessitating differential approaches to constructing the precipitation and temperature
instruments. The inset panel displays the aggregated run traces of the same number of randomly chosen global positioning system-enabled runners on a
dry and mild day, a rainy and mild day, a dry and cold day and a rainy and cold day in New York and Chicago, with fewer traces indicating fewer runs by
those runners.

 the impact of income on civil conflict36, poverty on crime37 and riots on labour
markets38. This technique, called the IV framework, disentangles endogeneity by
using variation created by exogenous events as a shock to one endogenous variable
to estimate its causal effect on another variable39.
For example, Angrist40 uses random variation in the likelihood of military
service created by the draft lottery to identify the causal effect of military service on
wages. Since individuals with lower expected wages are more likely to choose to
serve in the military, estimating the raw correlation between military service and
wages produces a biased estimate of the causal effect. However, since the draft
lottery is randomized and therefore uncorrelated with wages, an individual’s draft
lottery number can be used to identify the causal effect of military service on future
earnings. Military service is first regressed on randomly assigned draft lottery
numbers. Then, future wages are regressed on the predicted values of military
service from this first-stage regression. The draft lottery affects the likelihood of
military service because one’s lottery number determines whether one is drafted.
But, the lottery is uncorrelated with past wages and future wage potential (except
through their impact on the likelihood of military service) because lottery numbers
are randomly assigned. Since the military service driven by the draft lottery is
unrelated to the future wage potential of those who serve, unbiased estimates of the
average causal effect of military service on wages can be established by examining
the effect of military service mandated by the draft lottery on the future wages of
those who were randomly selected to serve.
To adapt the IV framework to the network setting, we need to identify a
naturally occurring source of variation in individuals’ running behaviour, which is
exogenous to, or uncorrelated with, the behaviour of their peers. For our purposes,
the weather is an ideal instrument41. As social ties span geographies, our data
record many relationships in which peers experience uncorrelated weather. In these
relationships, the weather experienced by one person is an excellent source of
exogenous variation that perturbs their running behaviour without affecting the
running behaviour of their geographically distant friends. We can then estimate
causal social influence effects in running behaviour in a two-stage least squares
specification, using the uncorrelated weather experienced by peers as an instrument
for identifying the social influence they exert on ego. We specified our model of
individual-level peer effects as follows:
1st stage : �

(including temperature and precipitation), ego’s time varying

, ego-level individual
fixed effects (Zi) and time fixed effects (vt).
The fitted values estimated in the first-stage regression capture only those
changes in peer behaviour caused by changes in weather that ego does not
experience. In the second stage, only the variation in peer behaviour precipitated by
exogenous weather events is used to estimate peers’ social influence on ego’s
behaviour. In this way, the IV approach enables causal inference by excluding ego’s
simultaneous effects on peers and variation created by observable and unobservable
confounding factors.
To estimate an unbiased causal effect, we must establish that j’s weather is
highly predictive of j’s running behaviour (a strong instrument) and uncorrelated
with i’s running behaviour (an exogenous instrument)42. We constructed an
optimal set of variables known as instruments by searching for cases in which j’s
weather is uncorrelated with i’s weather and therefore i’s running behaviour. This
search is non-trivial because weather patterns are correlated across geography and
time. We therefore searched over the daily weather correlation matrices of
individual and peer location pairs who run in different cities to find all location
pairs that have uncorrelated weather across time. For example, the weather in
Chicago today is typically uncorrelated with Boston’s weather today but correlated
with Boston’s weather tomorrow and 2 days from now (see Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 18). So, while the weather in Chicago today is a good
instrument for Chicagoans peer effects on runners in Boston today and 3 days from
now, it is not a good instrument for Chicagoan’s peer effects on runners in Boston
tomorrow or 2 days from now. Of the 2.1M located pairs with weather information,
we analysed the 600K to 1.2M friend pairs with uncorrelated weather across
different regressions, ensuring the validity of our instruments.
Temperature and precipitation also display different non-linear correlations
with running. While running is an approximately log linear function of
precipitation, it has an inverted U-shaped relationship with temperature
(see Fig. 4b,c). We therefore constructed optimal daily individual instruments for
the peer effect of j’s running behaviour on i’s running behaviour using percentile
discretized precipitation and temperature in j’s city for all location pairs that
exhibited uncorrelated weather across time, selecting the optimal instruments
using a Post-Lasso penalized first-stage regression that maximizes predictive
power and minimizes model complexity43. Diagnostics indicate that running is
strongly positively correlated with less precipitation and moderate temperatures
(see Fig. 4b–d) and that these instruments are both strong and exogenous
(see ‘Choosing Optimal Instruments: The Lasso (Post-Lasso) Method’ in
Supplementary Note 2 for details on the Post-Lasso IV method and its diagnostics,
each of which is listed individually for each regression in the table that displays that
regression’s results). On rainy and cold days, there are marked drops in running.
Figure 4b shows daily runner responses to weather changes over 6 months, whereas
Fig. 4c,d show responses per capita, thus underlining the fact that we are observing
real reactions to weather rather than perhaps the correlations between different
types of people who prefer to live in rainy or nice cites and their respective running
behaviours.
Robustness. Numerous diagnostic statistics, manipulation checks and falsification
tests validated our results and confirmed their robustness. Wu–Hausman tests
confirmed that peer effects in running behaviour are endogenous (we rejected the
null hypothesis of exogeneity with Po0.00001, N ¼ 9.5–12M observations, see
Supplementary Tables 4–7); F-statistics, which far exceeded the critical threshold of
19.93 for the 10% maximum relative bias due to weak instruments as suggested by
Stock and Yogo44, confirmed that our instruments are strong (F-statistics ranged
from 216 to 430, N ¼ 9.5M–12M observations, see Supplementary Tables 4–7);
and Kleinbergen–Paap rk LM statistics and Hansen–Sargan tests confirmed that
our estimates are not under- or over-identified, respectively (KP: Po0.00001;
Hansen–Sargan tests fail to reject the null hypothesis that our instruments are
valid with P values ranging from 0.13 to 0.25, N ¼ 9.5M–12M observations,
see Supplementary Tables 4–7). Our analyses were also robust to falsification tests
that examined (i) whether friends’ future running behaviours influenced ego and
(ii) whether unconnected friends influenced each other (both analyses showed no
effect); and to multiple econometric specifications and instrument realizations. For
example, an alternative specification based on simple binary weather instruments
confirmed the validity of our results (see Supplementary Note 4 for more detail on
estimation robustness).
But the work is not without its limitations. First, our influence estimates
may not generalize to other health behaviours. It could be that diet, alcohol
consumption, sexual contact, sleep patterns and other health behaviours are
subject to similar social spillovers or that they exhibit different patterns of
interdependence. Fortunately, new digital systems are recording and promoting the
socialization of these types of behaviours as well. The quantified self-movement
is proliferating the number of platforms that record and share health behaviours
and we encourage more work using these data to estimate human health
interdependence. Second, the individuals in our data may not represent the average
person. Our network sample is reasonably representative of the one in five
Americans who owns a wearable device and the over 100M people who use fitness
trackers worldwide. While this is a substantial and relevant group, they may not
represent the average person and peer effects may not operate similarly in the
absence of devices that socialize health behaviours. Third, we could not record
impression data on when runners observed their peers’ running, so we cannot rule
out heterogeneity in awareness as a possible explanation for heterogeneity in the
treatment effects (that is, that some runners check their friends’ activity more often
and are therefore more influenced by their friends). Finally, our instruments are
only valid for friends who live in different cities and are stronger for compliers than
for non-compliers in our sample (compliers are those who do not run in the rain or
during extreme temperatures and non-compliers are those who do). We report
average peer effects in running behaviour, but since the instruments are valid
for friend pairs in different cities and stronger for compliers, we further
examine and discuss complier and non-complier behaviour in the ‘Compliers and
Non-Compliers’ section in Supplementary Note 4 to more precisely characterize
our generalizations.
