Introduction
Naturally occurring classical or serotonergic hal-
lucinogens such as the tryptamines N,N-
dimethyltryptamine 
(DMT) 
and 
psilocybin 
(4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-DMT) have a long his-
tory of ritual use in Latin America [Harner, 1976; 
Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Dobkin de Rios, 
1984, 1990; Schultes, 1986, 1998; Wasson et al. 
1986; Schultes and Hofmann, 1992; Furst, 1994; 
Ott, 1994, 2004; Guzmán, 2008; McKenna and 
Riba, 2016]. DMT was first synthesized in 1931 
by the Canadian chemist Richard Manske and 
subsequently isolated by the Brazilian chemist 
Oswaldo Gonçalves de Lima in 1946 from 
Mimosa hostilis, a hallucinogenic plant used by 
northeastern Brazilian indigenous groups for the 
preparation of a sacred beverage called jurema 
[Ott, 1994, 1999, 2004; McKenna and Riba, 
2016]. DMT is also the main psychotropic com-
pound of ayahuasca, a psychotropic brew used for 
magico-ritual and therapeutic purposes by indig-
enous and urban populations of Amazonian 
countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Peru and 
Ecuador [Harner, 1976; Dobkin de Rios, 1984,

Abstract: To date, pharmacological treatments for mood and anxiety disorders and for drug 
dependence show limited efficacy, leaving a large number of patients suffering severe and 
persistent symptoms. Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, 
psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and 
antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published 
from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties. Electronic searches were 
performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in 
peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met 
the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant 
depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco 
and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin 
and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and 
anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may 
also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new 
therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them 
were open-label, proof-of-concept studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
studies with more patients are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.

1990; Schultes, 1986, 1998; Schultes and 
Hofmann, 1992; Furst, 1994; Ott, 1994, 2004; 
McKenna and Riba, 2016].
Ayahuasca is usually obtained by boiling the 
stems of the liana Banisteriopsis caapi with the 
leaves of the shrub Psychotria viridis [Harner, 
1976; Dobkin de Rios, 1984, 1990; McKenna 
et al. 1984; Schultes, 1986, 1998; Schultes and 
Hofmann, 1992; Furst, 1994; Ott, 1994, 1999, 
2004; Riba et al. 2001, 2003; McKenna and Riba, 
2016]. P. viridis is rich in DMT, while B. caapi 
contains β-carboline compounds that reversibly 
inhibit monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), such as 
harmine, tetrahydroharmine (THH) and harma-
line [Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977; Dobkin de 
Rios, 1984; McKenna et al. 1984; Schultes, 1986; 
Schultes and Hofmann, 1992; Ott, 1994, 1999, 
2004; Riba, et al. 2001, 2003; McKenna and 
Riba, 2016]. Due to peripheral (gastrointestinal 
and liver) MAO-A degradation, DMT is not 
orally active [Riba et al. 2001, 2003, 2015; 
McKenna and Riba, 2016]. Thus, MAO-A inhi-
bition by the β-carbolines in ayahuasca allows 
DMT to reach systemic circulation and the cen-
tral nervous system [Ott, 1999; Riba et al. 2001, 
2003, 2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016].
Psilocybin and its active dephosphorylated 
metabolite psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-DMT) are 
the primary psychoactive compounds of several 
species of hallucinogenic mushrooms found 
throughout the world [Harner, 1976; Grispoon 
and Bakalar, 1981; Wasson et al. 1986; Dobkin 
de Rios, 1990; Schultes and Hofmann, 1992; 
Furst, 1994; Schultes 1998; Passie et al. 2002; 
Ott, 2004; Guzmán, 2008; Tylš et al. 2014; 
McKenna and Riba, 2016]. Some of these spe-
cies, such as Psilocybe mexicana, have a crucial 
role in the religious and medicinal systems of 
indigenous groups in Mexico [Harner, 1976; 
Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Wasson et al. 1986; 
Dobkin de Rios, 1990; Schultes and Hofmann, 
1992; Furst, 1994; Schultes, 1998; Ott, 2004; 
Guzmán, 2008; McKenna and Riba, 2016]. The 
Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann first isolated psil-
ocybin and psilocin from P. mexicana in 1958 
after several self-experiments, and synthetized 
these compounds later in the same year [Passie 
et al. 2002; Ott, 2004; Hofmann, 2005; Guzmán, 
2008; Tylš et al. 2014; McKenna and Riba, 
2016]. Although psilocybin is usually referred to 
as being the main psychoactive compound in hal-
lucinogenic mushrooms, it is in fact a so-called 
prodrug of psilocin. Thus, after ingestion, it is 
rapidly dephosphorylated in the gut and liver into 
the active metabolite psilocin [Passie et al. 2002; 
Tylš et al. 2014; McKenna and Riba, 2016].
DMT and psilocybin are pharmacologically 
related to the ergoline D-lysergic acid diethyla-
mide (LSD or LSD-25), a semisynthetic deriva-
tive of the naturally occurring lysergic acid moiety, 
present in several alkaloids found in the rye ergot 
fungus (Claviceps purpurea) [Hofmann, 2005; 
Passie et al. 2008; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; 
Smith et al. 2014; McKenna and Riba, 2016]. 
LSD was first synthetized by Albert Hofmann in 
1938, and its psychoactive effects were discov-
ered when the Swiss chemist accidentally ingested 
the drug in 1943 [Hofmann, 2005; Passie et al. 
2008; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Smith et al. 
2014; McKenna and Riba, 2016].
DMT, psilocybin and LSD are agonists of seroto-
nin 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors [Pierce and Peroutka, 
1989; McKenna et al. 1990; Glennon et al. 2000; 
Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Nichols, 2004; Hintzen 
and Passie, 2010; Hanks and González-Maeso, 
2013; Tylš et al. 2014; Halberstadt, 2015]. 
Although the 5-HT1A/2C receptors modulate the 
effects of serotonergic hallucinogens, activation of 
frontocortical glutamate receptors secondary to 
5-HT2A receptor-related glutamate release appears 
to be the key mechanism of action of these drugs 
[Nichols, 2004; González-Maeso et al. 2008; 
Moreno et al. 2011, 2013; Hanks and González-
Maeso, 2013; Santini et al. 2014; Buchborn et al. 
2015; Carbonaro et al. 2015; Halberstadt, 2015]. 
The 5-HT2A and the metabotropic glutamate 2/3 
(mGluR2/3) receptors show an overlapping distri-
bution in the brain cortex, and their interaction 
has a crucial role in the neuropsychopharmacol-
ogy of classical hallucinogens [González-Maeso 
et al. 2008; Moreno et al. 2011].
In the last 25 years, the ritual and therapeutic use 
of ayahuasca has spread from small cities in the 
Amazonian jungle to the urban centers of South 
America, the United States, Europe, Asia and 
Africa [Labate et al. 2009; Labate and Jungaberle, 
2011; Labate and Cavnar, 2014]. Animal research

and preliminary experimental studies of aya-
huasca consumers [Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa 
et al. 2005, 2012; da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-
Silveira et al. 2005; dos Santos et al. 2007, 2016; 
Halpern et al. 2008; Barbosa et al. 2009; Labate 
et al. 2009, 2014; Fábregas et al. 2010; Labate 
and Jungaberle, 2011; Bouso et al. 2012; dos 
Santos, 2013; Thomas et al. 2013; Bouso and 
Riba, 2014; Fernández and Fábregas, 2014; 
Fernández et al. 2014; Loizaga-Velder and 
Loizaga Pazzi, 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Verres, 
2014; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2014; Winkelman, 
2014] suggest that ayahuasca and its isolated 
alkaloids have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and 
antiaddictive effects.
Moreover, experimental studies of acute aya-
huasca administration to healthy volunteers [Riba 
et al. 2001, 2003, 2006; dos Santos et al. 2011, 
2012; de Araujo et al. 2012; Palhano-Fontes et al. 
2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016] and mental 
health assessments of long-term ayahuasca con-
sumers [Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa et al. 2005, 
2009, 2012; da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-
Silveira et al. 2005; Halpern et al. 2008; Fábregas 
et al. 2010; Bouso et al. 2012, 2015; dos Santos, 
2013] suggest that this preparation is quite safe.
In the case of psilocybin and LSD between the 
mid-1950s and mid-1970s, several studies inves-
tigated the potential therapeutic use of these 
drugs in the treatment of neurosis, obsessive–
compulsive disorder (OCD), substance depend-
ence, and as an adjunctive therapy in the 
terminally ill [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin 
and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; 
Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 
1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; 
Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; 
Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; 
Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; 
Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 
2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Smith et al. 
2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016].
However, clinical research with hallucinogens was 
interrupted in the late 1960s mid-1970s due to an 
increase in the recreational use of these substances 
and their association with the countercultural 
movements 
[Grispoon 
and 
Bakalar, 
1981; 
Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Grob, 1998; 
Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen 
and Passie, 2010; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; 
Smith et al. 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 
2016]. Moreover, new rules for investigating novel 
pharmacological agents were introduced in the 
1960–1970s [Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014], creat-
ing many difficulties for human hallucinogen 
research since most of these studies had important 
methodological limitations, such as absence of 
adequate control groups and follow-up measure-
ments; substantial variation of dose and dosing 
duration among studies; lack of control for con-
founding factors such as pre-existing mental 
health problems or participant sex and age; non-
standardized criteria for therapeutic outcome; and 
use of diverse theoretical approaches for assessing 
beneficial effects (ranging from psychoanalysis or 
transpersonal psychology to hypnosis and senso-
rial isolation or overload) [Grispoon and Bakalar, 
1981; Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and 
Arnold, 1971; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; 
Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Dyck, 2006; Vollenweider 
and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 
2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 
2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister 
et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; 
Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016].
Therefore, although the early clinical studies with 
hallucinogens showed promising results, their 
methodological limitations suggest caution when 
interpreting their results. After a halt of almost 20 
years, controlled laboratory studies in humans 
involving the administration of hallucinogens 
resumed in the 1990s with the investigations in 
healthy volunteers of Leo Hermle and collabora-
tors in Germany, using orally administered mes-
caline [Hermle et al. 1992], and of Rick Strassman 
and coworkers in the United States, administer-
ing intravenous DMT [Strassman and Qualls, 
1994; Strassman et al. 1994].

2016; Schmid et al. 2016] suggest that classical 
hallucinogens such as psilocybin and LSD have 
anxiolytic, 
antidepressive, 
and 
antiaddictive 
properties.
Moreover, early clinical research [Kurland et al. 
1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon 
and Bakalar, 1981; Strassman, 1984; Riedlinger 
and Riedlinger, 1994; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; 
Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 
2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; 
Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; 
Liester, 2014; Smith et al. 2014; Tylš et al. 2014; 
Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016], and more recent 
observational studies [Krebs and Johansen, 2013; 
Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; Johansen and Krebs, 
2015], drug harm or risk assessments [Nutt et al. 
2010; van Amsterdam et al. 2011, 2013, 2015; 
Morgan et al. 2013], and pharmacological studies 
of acute drug administration to healthy volunteers 
[Griffiths et al. 2006, 2011; Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010; Studerus et al. 2011; Kometer 
et al. 2012; Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2012b, 
2013; Kraehenmann et al. 2016; Schmid et al. 
2016] suggest that these compounds have low tox-
icity and are reasonably safe when administered in 
supervised or controlled settings. Indeed, classic 
hallucinogens such as psilocybin and LSD are con-
sidered less toxic and harmful than most licit and 
illicit drugs [Nutt et al. 2010; van Amsterdam et al. 
2011, 2013, 2015; Morgan et al. 2013].
Thus, considering this context, this study aimed 
to conduct a systematic literature review of clini-
cal trials published in the last 25 years (1990–
2015) that investigated anxiolytic, antidepressive, 
and antiaddictive effects of ayahuasca, psilocybin 
and LSD.
Methods
Data for this systematic review were collected in 
accordance with the Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA) [Moher 
et al. 2009].
Data acquisition
We intended to identify all clinical trials available 
for review from 1 January 1990 to 1 July 2015, in 
which the anxiolytic, antidepressive, or antiaddic-
tive effects of ayahuasca, psilocybin or LSD were 
analyzed.
Search strategy
Electronic searches were performed using the 
PubMed (1 January 1990–1 July 2015), LILACS 
(1 January 1990–1 July 2015) and SciELO (1 
January 1990–1 July 2015) databases. The fol-
lowing key words were used: ayahuasca OR psilo-
cybin OR lysergic acid diethylamide AND anxiety 
OR depression OR dependence. References were 
retrieved through searching electronic databases 
and manual searches through reference lists of 
identified literature. All studies published in 
English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to 1 July 
2015 were included.
Eligibility criteria
The following inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were established prior to the literature search:
Article type. For purposes of this review, only 
clinical trials (open-label pilot studies, single-
blind trials, or double-blind placebo-controlled 
trials) published in peer-reviewed journals were 
included. Animal studies, experimental studies 
in healthy volunteers, observational studies, 
review papers, qualitative studies, opinion pieces 
or comments, letters or editorials, conference 
abstracts or posters, books or book chapters, 
case reports, and published abstracts were 
excluded.
Study design. The review included only clinical 
trials involving patients with a diagnosis of an 
anxiety, depressive, or dependence disorder 
based on a structured diagnostic interview [Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM)].
Participants. Only studies that included patients 
with a diagnosis of an anxiety, depressive, or 
dependence disorder based on a structured diag-
nostic interview (DSM) were included.
Interventions. All clinical trials evaluating the 
effects of ayahuasca, psilocybin, or LSD on anxi-
ety, depressive, or dependence symptoms were 
included.
Comparisons. The main comparators considered 
were placebo and active placebo.
Outcomes. Reductions in anxiety, depressive, or 
dependence symptoms measured with validated 
scales.

Data extraction
All studies were screened by two independent 
reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third 
reviewer. From the articles included we recorded 
names of authors, year of publication, study design 
(open label, single or double blind), characteris-
tics of the participants (anxiety, depressive, or 
dependence symptoms, and sample size), response 
criteria (anxiolytic, antidepressive, or antiaddic-
tive effect), type of intervention (drug, dose, and 
form of administration), and type of outcome 
measure (anxiety, depression, or dependence 
symptoms and scales).
Results
Study selection
A flow diagram illustrating the different phases of 
the systematic review is presented in Figure 1.
The search of the literature yielded 150 separate 
references. Owing to the overlap of coverage 
between the databases, six of the references were 
found to be duplicates. Thus, a total of 144 cita-
tions were reviewed for abstract screening (first 
pass). Following the first pass, five potentially rel-
evant references were identified [Moreno et al. 
Figure 1. Flow diagram illustrating the different phases of the systematic review.

2006; Grob et al. 2011; Gasser et al. 2014; 
Bogenschutz et al. 2015; Osório et al. 2015]. The 
remaining 139 studies were excluded according 
to the exclusion criteria. Full-text reports of the 
five selected citations were obtained for more 
detailed evaluation (second pass). Following 
detailed examination of the reports, all five cita-
tions were included. Another citation was found 
after hand search of the bibliography of the 
selected reports [Johnson et al. 2014]. Thus, six 
citations were included in the systematic review.
Studies were classified according to drug (aya-
huasca, psilocybin, or LSD) and symptom (anxi-
ety, depression, or dependence symptoms). The 
included studies comprised four studies with psil-
ocybin (one study of OCD: Moreno et al. 2006; 
one study of anxiety associated with advanced-
stage cancer: Grob et al. 2011; one study of 
tobacco dependence: Johnson et al. 2014; and 
one study of alcohol dependence: Bogenschutz 
et al. 2015], one study with LSD (anxiety associ-
ated with life-threatening diseases: Gasser et al. 
2014], and one study with ayahuasca [Osório 
et al. 2015]. The details of the selected studies are 
summarized in Table 1.
Despite the small number of studies, the small 
sample sizes (6–15 volunteers), the high degree of 
heterogeneity among studies, and the lack of pla-
cebo and control groups in three of the selected 
citations (open-label, proof-of-concept studies), 
the reported results consistently show that aya-
huasca, psilocybin, and LSD have anxiolytic, 
antidepressive, and antiaddictive properties. 
These findings will be further discussed in detail 
below.
Drugs
Psilocybin
Obsessive–compulsive disorder. In a dou-
ble-blind study, nine subjects (seven men, two 
women) with obsessive–compulsive disorder 
(OCD) and at least one treatment failure with 
a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (mean 3.4 ± 1.9 
treatment failures) received up to four differ-
ent doses of orally administered psilocybin (one 
dose for test session) in a dose-escalation blinded 
design [Moreno et al. 2006). Low (100 µg/kg), 
medium (200 µg/kg), and high (300 µg/kg) doses 
of psilocybin were administered in that order, and 
a very low dose (25 µg/kg) was inserted randomly 
and in double-blind design at any time after the 
first dose (100 µg/kg). Subjects met DSM-IV 
criteria for OCD and had a mean baseline Yale–
Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) 
score of 24.1 ± 5.9. YBOCS and Visual Analog 
Scales (VAS) scores for overall OCD symptom 
severity were measured immediately before drug 
ingestion and at 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion.
All subjects received the low dose, seven received 
the very low and medium doses, and six received 
all doses. Reductions in YBOCS scores ranging 
from 23% to 100% were observed in all subjects 
during one or more sessions. Moreover, 88.9% of 
subjects maintained no less than a 25% decrease 
and 66.7% maintained no less than a 50% 
decrease in YBOCS scores at 24 hours with at 
least one psilocybin dose. Symptom improvement 
during the following week was reported by two 
subjects, and one volunteer reported improve-
ment at the 6-month follow up. VAS scores were 
also reduced throughout the study period, and 
psilocybin was well tolerated by all volunteers.
Anxiety associated with advanced-stage cancer. A 
double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study assessed the safety and potential therapeu-
tic effects of psilocybin in the treatment of psy-
chological distress associated with the existential 
crisis of terminal disease [Grob et al. 2011]. 
Twelve subjects (11 women) with advanced-stage 
cancer and a DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress 
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety 
disorder due to cancer, or adjustment disorder 
with anxiety, received oral psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) 
or the active placebo niacin (250 mg) in a double-
blind fashion. The Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and 
the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were 
administered the day before, at the conclusion, 
the day after, and 2 weeks after each experimental 
session. The BDI, POMS, and STAI were admin-
istered again at monthly intervals for 6 months 
after the final session.
All 12 participants completed the 3 months of fol-
low up, 11 completed the 4-month follow up, and 
eight completed the 6-month follow up. During 
the study, two subjects died of their cancer and 
two became too ill to continue the study. 
Significant decreases were observed in STAI 
scores at the 1- and 3-month follow ups, and in 
BDI scores at the 6-month follow up. No signifi-
cant changes were observed in POMS scores, and 
psilocybin was well tolerated by all patients. By 
the time of the paper’s submission in 2010, 10 of 
the 12 subjects had died of their cancer.

Tobacco 
dependence. An 
open-label 
study 
assessed the effects of moderate (20 mg/70 kg) 
and high (30 mg/70 kg) doses of psilocybin in 15 
(ten men, five women; mean age of 51 years) nic-
otine-dependent smokers [Johnson et al. 2014]. 
Participants had a mean of six previous lifetime 
quit attempts, and smoked a mean of 19 cigarettes 
per day for a mean of 31 years. Volunteers partici-
pated in a 15-week smoking cessation treatment 
(cognitive behavioral therapy), with psilocybin 
administration occurring in weeks 5 (moderate 
dose), 7 (high dose), and 13 (high dose) (partici-
pants were permitted to repeat the moderate dose 
on sessions two and three). Changes in mean ciga-
rettes per day were compared between the 30 days 
prior to study intake and the 6 months after the 
first psilocybin session (at week 5 of treatment). 
Exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and urinary coti-
nine level were assessed at intake, weekly through-
out the intervention, and at 6-month follow up to 
measure recent smoking.
All participants completed the study. According 
to the Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB) and bio-
marker data (breath CO, urine cotinine), 80% 
(12 of 15) of participants were abstinent at 
6-month follow up. Among the entire sample, 
significant reductions from intake to the 6-month 
follow up were observed in breath CO levels, 
urine cotinine, and self-reported daily smoking. 
Moreover, craving [Questionnaire on Smoking 
Urges (QSU)] and temptation to smoke 
[Smoking Abstinence Self-Efficacy scale (SASE)] 
were significantly reduced across all time points.

Significant increases were reported for confi-
dence to abstain (SASE) from intake to the 
6-month follow up, and withdrawal scores 
[Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS)] 
peaked at 1-week postpsilocybin and decreased 
significantly through the 6-month follow up. No 
significant adverse events were reported during 
psilocybin sessions.
Alcohol dependence. Ten volunteers (four women, 
six men) with DSM-IV alcohol dependence 
(mean duration of dependence 15.1 ± 11.5 years, 
range 4–32) participated in an open-label trial 
that included a 12-session psychosocial interven-
tion and two oral doses of psilocybin [Bogen-
schutz et al. 2015]. Eight of the 10 volunteers had 
evidence of physical dependence (tolerance or 
withdrawal). The 
psychosocial 
intervention 
included seven sessions of Motivational Enhance-
ment 
Therapy (MET); three preparation sessions; 
two debriefing sessions; four sessions before the 
first psilocybin dose (0.3 mg/kg); four sessions 
between the first and second psilocybin dose (0.4 
mg/kg); and four sessions after the second psilo-
cybin dose. Outcome measures were collected for 
36 weeks.
Nine volunteers completed all follow-up assess-
ments; 10 completed the first psilocybin session, 
and seven the second session. However, only six 
patients were included in the analysis of the sec-
ond session since one volunteer did not receive 
the 0.4 mg/kg psilocybin dose, receiving the 0.3 
mg/kg due to meeting criteria for ‘complete mys-
tical 
experience’ 
[Mystical 
Experience 
Questionnaire (MEQ)] in the first session. One 
patient discontinued participation and was 
excluded from the analysis.
According to the TLFB, percent-drinking days 
(consumption of any amount of an alcoholic bev-
erage) and heavy-drinking days (consumption of 
four or more drinks of 14 g of alcohol) decreased 
significantly relative to weeks 1–4 prior to psilocy-
bin, and also during weeks 5–12 relative to base-
line. Following the first psilocybin session, 
percent-drinking days and heavy-drinking days 
were significantly lower than baseline at all fol-
low-up points.
Significant correlations were observed between 
the overall intensity (Hallucinogen Rating Scale 
Intensity score; Altered States of Consciousness 
Scale summary score) and mystical quality 
(MEQ) of the psilocybin session and changes in 
percent-drinking days (TLFB), craving [Penn 
Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS)], self-efficacy to 
abstain from drinking [Alcohol Abstinence Self-
Efficacy Confidence score (AASE)], and motiva-
tion [Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment 
Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES 8A)].
Improvements were largely maintained through-
out the 36 weeks follow up. At multiple time 
points relative to baseline and (or) week 4, psilo-
cybin reduced drinking consequences [Short 
Inventory of Problems, (SIP); weeks 8 to 36] and 
craving (PACS), and improved self-efficacy 
(AASE; weeks 5, 9, 24 and 36), motivation 
(SOCRATES 8A; weeks 5 to 36), and mood 
[Profile of Mood States, (POMS); weeks 4 and 
24]. No significant adverse effects were reported 
after psilocybin administration.
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
Anxiety associated with life-threatening dis-
eases. A double blind, randomized, active pla-
cebo-controlled study assessed the effects of 
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in 12 patients 
(seven men, four women) with anxiety associ-
ated with life-threatening diseases (cancer, or 
chronic motor or inflammatory diseases) [Gas-
ser et al. 2014]. Volunteers had a score of no less 
than 40 on the state or trait scales of the STAI 
and a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive dis-
order (MDD), reactive depression, dysthymia, 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic 
disorder, or social phobia. The study included 
drug-free psychotherapy sessions and two LSD-
assisted 
psychotherapy 
sessions. Volunteers 
received either an experimental dose (200 µg, n 
= 8) or an active placebo (20 µg, n = 3) of LSD 2 
to 3 weeks apart, with an open-label crossover to 
200 µg of LSD after the initial blinded treatment 
(n = 4). Outcome data were collected at base-
line, 1 week after LSD sessions, and at 2- and 
12-month follow ups.
At the 2-month point, STAI state anxiety was sig-
nificantly reduced, and a trend was found for 
reductions in STAI trait anxiety. STAI reductions 
were sustained for 12 months. Beneficial results 
were also observed in secondary outcome meas-
ures, including the European Cancer Quality of 
Life Questionnaire 30-item version 1.0 (EORTC-
QLQ-30), the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised 
(SCL-90-R), and the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS). However, due to con-
cerns about multiplicity, changes in secondary out-
come measures were not analyzed for statistical

significance. No adverse effects or treatment-
related serious adverse events were reported.
Ayahuasca
Major depressive disorder. An open-label trial 
assessed the antidepressive potential of ayahuasca 
in patients with diagnosis of recurrent major 
depressive disorder (MDD) [Osório et al. 2015]. 
A single dose of orally administered ayahuasca 
(2.2 ml/kg body weight) was administered to six 
volunteers (two men, four women) suffering a 
mild (n = 2), moderate (n = 3) or severe (n = 
1) depressive episode. Ayahuasca administration 
produced statistically significant reductions of up 
to 82% in depressive scores between baseline and 
1, 7 and 21 days after drug intake, according to 
the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-
D), the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating 
Scale (MADRS), and the Anxious–Depression 
subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
(BPRS). Ayahuasca did not produce significant 
effects in the 
Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
scores or in the other subscales of the BPRS. Aya-
huasca was well tolerated by all patients and vom-
iting was the only adverse effect recorded, being 
reported by 50% of the volunteers. Patients did 
not consider this emetic effect as causing severe 
discomfort.
Discussion
Possible mechanisms of therapeutic action
The mechanisms of action responsible for the ben-
eficial effects produced by ayahuasca, psilocybin 
and LSD are not completely understood. 
Preclinical evidence show that ayahuasca [Lima 
et al. 2006; Pic-Taylor et al. 2015] and its 
β-carbolines harmine [Aricioglu-Kartal et al. 2003; 
Farzin and Mansouri, 2006; Fortunato et al. 2009, 
2010a, 2010b; Réus et al. 2010, 2012; Brierley and 
Davidson, 2012; Owaisat et al. 2012] and harma-
line [Glick et al. 1994; Hilber and Chapillon, 2005; 
Wu et al. 2009], as well as psilocybin [Matsushima 
et al. 2009] and LSD [Zghoul and Blier, 2003; 
Buchborn et al. 2014], have antidepressive, anxio-
lytic, and antiaddictive properties. Experimental 
studies with healthy volunteers report that acute 
administration of DMT [Gillin et al. 1976; 
Strassman et al. 1994; Riba et al. 2015], psilocybin 
[Griffiths et al. 2006, 2011; Studerus et al. 2011; 
Kometer et al. 2012; Kraehenmann et al. 2016], 
and LSD [Schmid et al. 2016] increase positive 
mood. Furthermore, observational and prelimi-
nary experimental studies of ayahuasca consumers 
[Grob et al. 1996; Barbosa et al. 2005, 2009, 2012; 
da Silveira et al. 2005; Doering-Silveira et al. 2005; 
dos Santos et al. 2007, 2016; Halpern et al. 2008; 
Labate et al. 2009, 2014; Fábregas et al. 2010; 
Labate and Jungaberle, 2011; Bouso et al. 2012; 
dos Santos, 2013; Thomas et al. 2013; Bouso and 
Riba, 2014; Fernández and Fábregas, 2014; 
Fernández et al. 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Loizaga 
Pazzi, 2014; Loizaga-Velder and Verres, 2014; 
Palhano-Fontes et al. 2014; Winkelman, 2014], as 
well as case reports [Leonard and Rapoport, 1987; 
Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Hanes, 1996; 
Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Perrine, 1999; 
Wilcox, 2014] and observational studies [Krebs 
and Johansen, 2013; Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; 
Johansen and Krebs, 2015] involving psilocybin 
and LSD, also suggest that these drugs have thera-
peutic potentials.
Since DMT, psilocybin and LSD are agonists of 
serotonin 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors [Pierce and 
Peroutka, 1989; McKenna et al. 1990; Glennon 
et al. 2000; Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Nichols, 2004; 
Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Hanks and González-
Maeso, 2013; Tylš et al. 2014; Halberstadt, 2015], 
these receptors may be involved in the therapeutic 
effects of these tryptamines. In fact, cortical expres-
sion of 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptor is altered in post-
mortem samples of depressed patients, suggesting 
that these receptors are involved in emotional pro-
cessing [Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; 
Baumeister et al. 2014]. Furthermore, animal 
models and clinical studies show that 5-HT1A 
receptor agonists have anxiolytic and antidepres-
sive properties [Nutt, 2005; Katzman, 2009; 
Baumeister et al. 2014], and 5-HT2A/2C receptor 
agonists reduce anxiety- and depression-related 
behavior in animals [Masuda and Sugiyama, 2000; 
Nic Dhonnchadha et al. 2003a, 2003b; Baumeister 
et al. 2014].
Another possible mechanism of therapeutic 
action is the modulation of glutamatergic neuro-
transmission induced by 5-HT2A-receptor ago-
nism [Nichols, 2004; González-Maeso et al. 
2008; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Moreno 
et al. 2011, 2013; Hanks and González-Maeso, 
2013; Santini et al. 2014; Buchborn et al. 2015; 
Carbonaro et al. 2015; Halberstadt, 2015]. 
Activation of frontocortical glutamate networks 
by 5-HT2A receptor agonists could lead to 
increases in the expression of neurotrophic fac-
tors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic 
factor (GDNF) and in the size of dendritic spines 
 Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology 6(3)

on cortical neurons, thus enhancing neuroplasti-
city 
and 
neurogenesis 
[Vollenweider 
and 
Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; 
Ross, 2012; Baumeister et al. 2014; Bogenschutz 
and Johnson, 2016]. For instance, depression is 
associated with deficient neurogenesis and neuro-
trophic activity, and BDNF levels are decreased 
in depressed patients and normalized after anti-
depressant treatment [Baumeister et al. 2014]. 
Furthermore, alcohol self-administration and 
conditioned place preference are inversely related 
to BDNF or GDNF expression in animal models 
[Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; Bogenschutz 
and Johnson, 2016]. Interestingly, a low dose 
(0.1 mg/kg) of psilocybin produced a trend 
toward increased neurogenesis in the mouse hip-
pocampus 2 weeks after its administration, while 
a high dose (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased neu-
rogenesis [Catlow et al. 2013]. These results sug-
gest that the effects of psilocybin on neurogenesis 
are dose- and time-related.
Agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor could also pro-
duce beneficial effects due to an anti-inflamma-
tory action [Nau et al. 2013; Baumeister et al. 
2014; dos Santos, 2014; Szabo et al. 2014]. 
Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), inter-
leukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-1β are associated 
with depressive illness, while normalization of 
these levels are related to antidepressant effects 
[Baumeister et al. 2014; Réus et al. 2015]. The 
5-HT2A receptor is expressed in central and 
peripheral immune-related cells [Stefulj et al. 
2000; Nau et al. 2013], and 5-HT2A agonists may 
modulate the immune system [Forrer and 
Goldner, 1951; Feld et al. 1958; Sackler et al. 
1963, 1966; Hollister and Sjoberg, 1964; House 
et al. 1994, 1997; Stefulj et al. 2000; Passie et al. 
2002; Davydova et al. 2010; Hintzen and Passie, 
2010; dos Santos et al. 2011, 2012; Frecska et al. 
2013; Nau et al. 2013; Baumeister et al. 2014; dos 
Santos, 2014; Szabo et al. 2014]. Indeed, in vitro 
studies show that LSD inhibits the production of 
IL-6 [House et al. 1994, 1997], and the seroton-
ergic hallucinogen 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl-
isopropylamine (DOI, a 5-HT2A receptor agonist) 
produces anti-inflammatory effects in mice by 
blocking TNF-α-induced expression of pro-
inflammatory cell adhesion (Icam-1, Vcam-1), 
cytokine (IL-6, IL-1β), and chemokine (Mcp-1, 
Cx3cl1) genes, and expression of VCAM-1 pro-
tein [Nau et al. 2013]. These effects were blocked 
by a 5-HT2A selective antagonist, implicating this 
receptor in the anti-inflammatory effects of DOI.
Moreover, DMT and the related tryptamine 
5-methoxy-DMT (5-MeO-DMT) reduced the 
mRNA expression and the levels of IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-1β, and TNF-α, increased the levels of the anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and inhibited the 
immune responses of inflammatory T helper 1/17 
(Th1/Th17) cells [Szabo et al. 2014]. Interestingly, 
gene knock-down experiments showed that the 
effects of both tryptamines on TNFα, IL-10, and 
Th1/Th17 responses were mediated by the sigma-1 
receptor, and recent studies show that DMT is an 
endogenous agonist for the sigma-1 receptor 
[Fontanilla et al. 2009; Su et al. 2009; Frecska et al. 
2013; Szabo et al. 2014].
The possible modulation of the sigma-1 receptor 
by DMT shows that other mechanisms of action 
that are not dependent of the 5-HT1A/2A/2C recep-
tors may also be involved in the therapeutic action 
of classic hallucinogens. For instance, harmine, 
THH and harmaline reversibly inhibit MAO-A 
[Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977; McKenna et al. 
1984; Ott, 1994, 1999, 2004; Riba et al. 2001, 
2003; McKenna and Riba, 2016], and reversible 
inhibitors of MAO-A (RIMAs) are clinically used 
as anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs [Yamada 
and Yasuhara, 2004; Nutt, 2005]. Moreover, 
rodent studies show that the antidepressive effects 
of harmine are associated with increases in BDNF 
levels [Fortunato et al. 2009; 2010a; 2010b].
Neural oxidative stress and subsequent neuroin-
flammation are associated with psychiatric disor-
ders such as depression [Réus et al. 2015], and 
several preclinical studies show that harmine and 
harmaline have antioxidant and neuroprotective 
effects that seem to be mediated by MAO inhibi-
tion [Maher and Davis, 1996; Biradar et al. 2013], 
regulation of the dual specificity tyrosine-phospho-
rylation-regulated kinase DYRK1A [Frost et al. 
2011], modulation of dopaminergic [Lee et al. 
2000; Schwarz et al. 2003], cholinergic [Biradar 
et al. 2013], and glutamatergic [Maher and Davis, 
1996; Li et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2014] pathways, 
interaction with voltage-gated membrane channels 
[Splettstoesser et al. 2005], and regulation of cell-
energy homeostasis, mitochondrial functions, and 
oxygen free radical scavenging [Moura et al. 2007; 
Réus et al. 2010, 2012; Abelaira et al. 2013]. 
Furthermore, harmine also has anti-inflammatory 
properties that seem to be mediated at least in part 
by DYRK1A [Khor et al. 2015].
The antiaddictive effects of ayahuasca, psilocybin 
and LSD could also be related to the activation of 
 RG dos Santos, FL Osório et al.

203
the dopaminergic system. For instance, preclinical 
studies show that LSD [Nichols, 2004; Passie 
et al. 2008; Hintzen and Passie, 2010], psilocybin 
[Tylš et al. 2014; Sakashita et al. 2015], and aya-
huasca [de Castro-Neto et al. 2013] may indirectly 
stimulate 
dopaminergic 
pathways, 
probably 
through 5-HT2A-receptor activation (LSD, psilo-
cybin, 
and 
DMT) 
or 
MAO 
inhibition 
(β-carbolines). Moreover, acute psilocybin admin-
istration indirectly increased (through 5-HT1A/2A 
receptors) the release of dopamine in the ventral 
striatum in humans [Vollenweider et al. 1999]. 
Animal studies suggest that the antiaddictive 
potentials of harmine and harmaline appear to 
involve imidazoline, glutamate, and dopamine 
pathways [Glick et al. 1994; Iurlo et al. 2001; 
Aricioglu-Kartal et al. 2003; Schwarz et al. 2003; 
Brierley and Davidson, 2012, 2013; Owaisat et al. 
2012].
Recent neuroimaging studies in humans suggest 
that the mood-enhancing properties of ayahuasca 
and psilocybin could be related to modifications 
in the activity of brain regions such as the amyg-
dala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), 
involved in emotional processing, and the default 
mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions 
associated with introspection and other internally 
focused functions [Riba et al. 2006; Araujo et al. 
2012; Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2014; 
Tagliazucchi et al. 2014; Bouso et al. 2015; 
Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; Alonso et al. 2015; 
Kraehenmann et al. 2016; McKenna and Riba, 
2016]. Psilocybin reduced amygdala reactivity, 
which correlated with increases in positive mood 
[Kraehenmann et al. 2016]. Increased activity of 
the DMN is associated with intensification of the 
self-reference process of rumination, which is an 
important depressive symptom, and acute admin-
istration of ayahuasca [Palhano-Fontes et al. 
2015] and psilocybin [Carhart-Harris et al. 
2012a] reduces brain activity in key regions of the 
DMN, such as the posterior cingulate cortex 
(PCC). Moreover, regular ayahuasca use is asso-
ciated with cortical thinning in the PCC [Bouso 
et al. 2015].
Early human research with classical hallucino-
gens suggests that the therapeutic properties of 
these compounds are related at least in part to 
their effects on perceptions, emotions, and 
thoughts [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and 
Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; 
Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 
1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; 
Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; 
Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; 
Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; 
Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 
2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 
2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. The 
subjective experience produced by these drugs 
would create a ‘window of opportunity’ in which 
changes in unhealthy thoughts, emotions, and 
behaviors could take place in a psychotherapeutic 
context [Kurland et al. 1971; McGlothlin and 
Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; 
Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; Abraham et al. 
1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; Grob, 1998; 
Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 2006; 
Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 2012; 
Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 2013; 
Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister et al. 
2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić et al. 
2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. Recent 
neuroimaging studies with ayahuasca and psilo-
cybin seem to corroborate these early ideas by 
suggesting that the altered state of consciousness 
produced by these drugs would create a disrup-
tion or interruption of the repetitive, rigid, and 
pathological pattern of negative and compulsive 
thoughts present in anxiety and mood disorders 
and in drug dependence, contributing to mental 
flexibility and changes in perspective, values, and 
behavior [Carhart-Harris et al. 2012a, 2014; 
Tagliazucchi et al. 2014; Palhano-Fontes et al. 
2015; McKenna and Riba, 2016].
Furthermore, the ability of classical hallucinogens 
to elicit religious, mystical, transcendent, or peak 
experiences has also been proposed as a possible 
psychological mechanism associated with the 
beneficial effects of these drugs [Kurland et al. 
1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon 
and Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 
1994; Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 
1998; Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; 
Dyck, 2006; Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; 
Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider and 
Kometer, 2010; MacLean et al. 2011; Bogenschutz 
and Pommy, 2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; 
Bogenschutz, 2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; 
Baumeister et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 
2014; Majić et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and 
Johnson, 2016]. Indeed, recent studies in healthy 
individuals show that acute psilocybin adminis-
tration induces highly meaningful and spiritually 
significant experiences with sustained positive 
 Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology 6(3)

changes in attitudes, mood, personality, and 
behavior [Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; 
MacLean et al. 2011]. Moreover, a secondary 
analysis of the data from the study of psilocybin 
and tobacco dependence reported that the mysti-
cal-type effects of psilocybin and their personal 
meaning, spiritual significance, and impact on 
well-being were correlated with improvements in 
smoking cessation [Garcia-Romeu et al. 2014; 
Johnson et al. 2014]. A qualitative follow-up 
assessment of the patients enrolled in the study of 
LSD-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associ-
ated with a life-threatening disease also suggested 
that the intense emotional experiences with mys-
tic-like features produced by LSD could mediate 
the observed long-term beneficial changes in per-
spectives, attitudes, values, and quality of life 
[Gasser et al. 2014, 2015].
Interestingly, these findings are consistent with 
studies that suggest that the dissociative, psy-
chotomimetic, and mystical-type effects pro-
duced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
antagonist ketamine may mediate the anxiolytic 
[Kolp et al. 2007], antidepressive [Sos et al. 
2013; Luckenbaugh et al. 2014], and antiaddic-
tive [Krupitsky et al. 1992, 2002, 2007; Krupitsky 
and Grinenko, 1997; Jansen, 2001; Kolp et al. 
2006; Krupitsky and Kolp, 2007; Dakwar et al. 
2014a, 2014b] properties of this nonclassic hal-
lucinogen. Moreover, some authors suggested 
that the temporary mental state produced by 
classic hallucinogens might induce profound 
long-term effects by producing an ‘inverse post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like effect’ in 
which a highly significant and positive experi-
ence would cause lasting beneficial changes, as 
opposed to chronic negative mood and other 
detrimental symptoms caused by a single trau-
matic 
event, 
which 
characterizes 
PTSD 
[MacLean et al. 2011; Young 2013; Garcia-
Romeu et al. 2014].
Human hallucinogenic research performed in the 
1960s and 1970s also suggests that the context 
and the psychotherapeutic approach used in com-
bination with classic hallucinogens are also 
important components of the beneficial effects 
produced by these drugs [Kurland et al. 1971; 
McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; Grispoon and 
Bakalar, 1981; Riedlinger and Riedlinger, 1994; 
Abraham et al. 1996; Delgado and Moreno, 1998; 
Grob, 1998; Grof, 2001; Hofmann, 2005; Dyck, 
2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; Vollenweider 
and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz and Pommy, 
2012; Krebs and Johansen, 2012; Bogenschutz, 
2013; Burdick and Adinoff, 2013; Baumeister 
et al. 2014; Liester, 2014; Oram, 2014; Majić 
et al. 2015; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016]. 
The methodology of the clinical trials included in 
the present systematic review are very diverse 
regarding this topic: three studies assessed the 
effects of single-dose exposures without psycho-
therapeutic approaches [Moreno et al. 2006; 
Grob et al. 2011; Osório et al. 2015] and three 
trials included some form of psychological inter-
vention over a few weeks [Gasser et al. 2014; 
Johnson et al. 2014; Bogenschutz et al. 2015]. 
The studies without psychotherapy suggest that 
biochemical mechanisms may be involved in the 
beneficial effects observed. On the other hand, 
the inclusion of psychological interventions in the 
other studies suggests that at least some part of 
the therapeutic results is related to nondrug fac-
tors. Placebo effects and enhanced suggestibility 
may also play a role as adjuncts in hallucinogen-
assisted psychotherapy [Young, 2013; Carhart-
Harris et al. 2015].
Future research should investigate the possible 
influence 
of 
different 
psychotherapeutic 
approaches or other nondrug factors – such as 
patient preparation before drug administration 
and integration of the drug session afterwards – in 
mediating the therapeutic properties of classic 
hallucinogens.
Safety
No serious adverse reactions were reported in any 
of the clinical trials reviewed in the present sys-
tematic review, suggesting that classic hallucino-
gens can be safely administered to patients 
suffering anxiety, depression, or drug dependence. 
Previous experimental studies of acute ayahuasca 
administration to healthy volunteers [Riba et al. 
2001, 2003, 2006; dos Santos et al. 2011, 2012; 
de Araujo et al. 2012; Palhano-Fontes et al. 2015; 
McKenna and Riba, 2016] also suggest that this 
drug can be safely administered in controlled 
experimental settings. Observational studies of 
long-term ayahuasca consumers [Grob et al. 1996; 
Barbosa et al. 2005, 2009, 2012; da Silveira et al. 
2005; Doering-Silveira et al. 2005; Halpern et al. 
2008; Fábregas et al. 2010; Bouso et al. 2012, 
2015; dos Santos, 2013] also suggest that this 
brew has a low toxicity profile when consumed in 
ritual contexts. Previous clinical research [Kurland 
et al. 1971; McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971; 
Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; Strassman, 1984; 
 RG dos Santos, FL Osório et al.

Grof, 2001; Passie et al. 2002, 2008; Hofmann, 
2005; Dyck, 2006; Hintzen and Passie, 2010; 
Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Bogenschutz

Bogenschutz, 2013; Liester, 2014; Smith et al. 
2014; Tylš et al. 2014; Bogenschutz and Johnson, 
2016] and recent observational studies [Krebs 
and Johansen, 2013; Hendricks et al. 2014, 2015; 
Johansen and Krebs, 2015], drug harm or risk 
assessments [Nutt et al. 2010; van Amsterdam 
et al. 2011, 2013, 2015; Morgan et al. 2013], and 
experimental studies with healthy volunteers 
[Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010; Carhart-
Harris et al. 2012a, 2012b, 2013] also suggest that 
psilocybin and LSD can be safely administered in 
controlled settings.
Limitations
A main limitation of the present systematic review 
is the inclusion of a small number of studies (six) 
with small sample sizes (6–15 volunteers), which 
limits the generalization of the reported results. 
Included studies also show a high degree of het-
erogeneity, and three of the selected citations did 
not include placebo or a control group (open-
label, proof-of-concept studies). Another impor-
tant limitation is the difficulty in disentangling 
placebo effects, drug effects, and the influence of 
the psychological intervention included in the 
clinical trial.
However, despite these important limitations, 
results consistently showed that ayahuasca, psilo-
cybin, and LSD produced anxiolytic, antidepres-
sive, and antiaddictive effects in patients, and 
these results were also observed in animal studies 
and with healthy volunteers. Given the low suc-
cess rates of current pharmacological and non-
pharmacological treatments for drug dependence 
and anxiety and mood disorders, and considering 
the high morbidity and mortality associated with 
these disorders, it is necessary to perform more 
studies with these drugs, even if only a small por-
tion of patients may reduce their suffering with 
these drugs. Future studies should include more 
patients, placebo or active placebo, randomized 
and double-blind designs, and multiple doses 
during treatment. Moreover, the influence of psy-
chological interventions and the possible increases 
in therapeutic efficacy proportionated by these 
psychotherapeutic approaches should be better 
explored.
Conclusion
Currently available pharmacological treatments 
for drug dependence and anxiety and mood dis-
orders have limited efficacy and often produce 
important adverse reactions that may limit treat-
ment continuation. Classic tryptamine halluci-
nogens such as ayahuasca/DMT, psilocybin, and 
LSD are safely administered in controlled set-
tings and several basic, experimental, and clini-
cal studies suggest that these drugs have 
anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive 
effects. Such beneficial properties seem to be 
mediated by an agonist action of these com-
pounds on 5-HT1A/2A/2C receptors, which are 
involved in emotional processing, regulation of 
neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory actions, 
and modulation of frontal and medial brain 
structures. Other mechanisms of action not 
related to serotonergic receptors, such as regula-
tion of cell energy homeostasis, mitochondrial 
functions, and oxidative stress, also appear to 
mediate these therapeutic effects.
The reviewed studies suggest that the therapeutic 
use of classic hallucinogens may offer to some 
patients fast-acting and prolonged beneficial 
effects after a single dose, producing few adverse 
effects. Indeed, interest in the medicinal uses of 
this class of drugs is increasing: new clinical trials 
investigating the effects of psilocybin in the treat-
ment of alcoholism, cocaine dependence, tobacco 
dependence, and anxiety and depression associ-
ated 
with 
cancer 
are 
currently 
underway 
[ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02061293, 
NCT02037126, NCT01943994, NCT00957359, 
NCT00465595]. Moreover, our group recently 
replicated the results of the original open-label, 
proof-of-concept study [Osório et al. 2015] but 
including an increased sample size (n =17) and 
single-photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT), showing that ayahuasca antidepressive 
properties may be associated with increased blood 
perfusion in brain areas related to depressive 
symptoms (Sanches et al. 2016 “This reference 
was not included in the review because it was not 
published at the time of the electronic search”). 
Our group is currently performing randomized, 
double blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing 
the antidepressive and anxiolytic potentials of aya-
huasca [Frood, 2015].
Further studies are urgently needed to better 
understand the effects of classical tryptamine hal-
lucinogens in psychiatric disorders.
