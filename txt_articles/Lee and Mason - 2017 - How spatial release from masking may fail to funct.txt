How spatial release from masking may fail
to function in a highly directional auditory
system

Abstract Spatial release from masking (SRM) occurs when spatial separation between a signal
and masker decreases masked thresholds. The mechanically-coupled ears of Ormia ochracea are
specialized for hyperacute directional hearing, but the possible role of SRM, or whether such
specializations exhibit limitations for sound source segregation, is unknown. We recorded
phonotaxis to a cricket song masked by band-limited noise. With a masker, response thresholds
increased and localization was diverted away from the signal and masker. Increased separation
from 6˚ to 90˚ did not decrease response thresholds or improve localization accuracy, thus SRM
does not operate in this range of spatial separations. Tympanal vibrations and auditory nerve
responses reveal that localization errors were consistent with changes in peripheral coding of signal
location and flies localized towards the ear with better signal detection. Our results demonstrate
that, in a mechanically coupled auditory system, specialization for directional hearing does not
contribute to source segregation.

Introduction
Natural soundscapes are composed of numerous biotic and abiotic sound sources (Brumm and Slab-
bekoorn, 2005; Theunissen and Elie, 2014). Even in the presence of natural noise, auditory systems
are adept at detecting, recognizing, and localizing sound sources of interest for animals that rely on
hearing to mediate appropriate behavioural decisions (Bee and Micheyl, 2008; Lee et al., 2017).
Segregating sounds of interest from noise can be challenging because sound waves from multiple
sources combine to form a composite waveform prior to auditory transduction. From this input,
coherent representations of various sources are derived from the composite waveform and signals
of interest are segregated from other competing sound sources (McDermott, 2009). In humans, this
sensory challenge is known as the ‘cocktail party problem’ and it describes difficulties encountered
in perceiving speech in noisy social settings (Bregman, 1990; Bronkhorst, 2000; Brumm and Slab-
bekoorn, 2005; Cherry, 1953; Hulse, 2002; McDermott, 2009).
Non-human animals may encounter analogous situations in natural acoustic environments
(Bee, 2012; Bee and Micheyl, 2008; Hulse, 2002; Ro
¨mer, 2013). Some insect choruses are known
to produce sustained levels of background noise (Gerhardt and Huber, 2002; Ro
¨mer, 2013). These
choruses are often composed of mixed species with communication signals that may share spectral,
temporal, and spatial overlap. Such background noises have the potential to negatively impact the
performance of auditory systems in perceiving relevant signals (Brumm, 2013; Brumm and Slabbe-
koorn, 2005; Wiley, 2015).
Hearing with two ears provides important computational advantages for sound localization and
sound source segregation (Schnupp and Carr, 2009). When two ears are spatially separated, each
will experience different sound arrival times and sound pressure levels in response to an incident

 sound wave. Interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD respectively) are binaural cues that
the auditory system can utilize to compute sound direction (Knudsen and Konishi, 1979; Michel-
sen, 1998). Spatially separated sound sources will give rise to different ITDs and ILDs for each
source and sound diffraction between the two ears can generate different signal-to-noise ratios asso-
ciated with each source leading to a ‘better ear advantage’ for detecting a particular sound source
(Blauert, 1997). Both these auditory cues may contribute to spatial release from masking (SRM), a
sensory mechanism that allows for improved reception of target signals that are spatially separated
from noise sources (Bee and Micheyl, 2008).
Spatial release from masking has been documented in ears that function as independent pressure
receivers and in ears that are internally (acoustically) coupled to function as pressure difference
receivers
(Bee,
2007;

Christensen-Dalsgaard,

Caldwell et al., 2016; Dent et al., 1997; Hine et al., 1994; Nityananda and Bee, 2012;
Saberi et al., 1991; Schwartz and Gerhardt, 1989; Su
¨mer et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2013).
Whether spatial release from masking may contribute to sound source segregation in mechanically
coupled pressure receivers remains unknown. Mechanically coupled ears have been described in
some tachinid and sarcophagid flies that rely on directional hearing to localize the advertisement sig-
nals of suitable host species (Allen, 1995; Cade, 1975; Lakes-Harlan et al., 1999; Robert et al.,
1999). Upon source localization, larvae are deposited and develop as parasites within hosts
(Adamo et al., 1995; Allen et al., 1999; Cade, 1975).
The ability of Ormia ochracea (Diptera: Tachinidae) to localize cricket calling songs is remarkable
because their small physical size severely limits conventional acoustic cues for sound localization
(Michelsen, 1998; Robert, 2005). With bilaterally symmetric ears that are separated by a mere 500
mm (Robert et al., 1996a), diffraction of the ~7 cm wavelength field cricket calling song is insufficient
to result in measurable acoustic ILDs and the best possible ITD is 1.45 ms for a sound source at 90˚
relative to the midline (Robert et al., 1996b). Despite these minuscule sound field directional cues,
O. ochracea are still capable of localizing sound sources to the accuracy of 2˚ azimuth (Mason et al.,
2001). This hyperacute directionality is made possible by the mechanical coupling of the two tym-
pana with a flexible cuticular lever that amplifies the sound field ITDs into larger mechanical ITD and
ILDs sufficient for neural processing (Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002). The surprising acuity of directional
hearing in O. ochracea has led to considerable interest in mechanically coupled auditory systems as
models for novel acoustic technology (e.g. Bauer et al., 2016; Kuntzman and Hall, 2014), as well as
other applications involving localization of signal sources subject to the so-called ‘aperture problem’
(e.g. Akc
¸akaya and Nehorai, 2010).
In addition to computing sound direction, O. ochracea must also recognize the calling songs of
preferred host crickets (Gray et al., 2007). Field cricket calling songs consist of tonal sound pulses
with a dominant frequency of about 5 kHz that are repeated at a species-specific pulse rate
(Walker, 1962). After song detection, O. ochracea engage in flying (Mu
¨ller and Robert, 2001) and/
or walking phonotaxis to the source (Lee et al., 2009; Mason et al., 2005). Success in localizing
host crickets requires the auditory system to integrate two types of temporal information. The audi-
tory system must measure a difference in the timing of sound pulses that arrive at the two ears to
determine sound direction, and the timing between consecutive sound pulses for song pattern rec-
ognition (species recognition). In this study, we examine whether spatial release from masking may
contribute to improved host song recognition and localization in the presence of masking noise. We
exploit the directional characteristics of the mechanically coupled tympana and use a point-source
band-limited noise to asymmetrically interfere with the temporal pattern input to both sides of the
auditory system. If spatial release from masking confers hearing advantages in O. ochracea, behav-
ioural response thresholds are expected to decrease while localization accuracy is expected to
increase when noise is spatially separated from a signal of interest (relative to noise and signal sour-
ces in close proximity). However, over a range of spatial separations between a target signal and
masker (from 6˚ to 90˚ of spatial separation), we find no support for SRM in auditory responses of O.
ochracea. Rather, a localized masker interferes with auditory directionality, and this effect is more
severe for a larger spatial separation between the target signal and masker.

 Results
In behavioural experiments, we used a spherical treadmill system (Lott et al., 2007; Mason et al.,
2001) to measure walking phonotaxis to a frontal target signal (attractive synthetic cricket trill) and a
laterally positioned masker (band-limited noise) (Figure 1A). Test stimuli consisted of a 76 dB SPL 4
s burst of band-limited masker in combination with a 2 s target signal broadcast at different intensi-
ties to result in varied signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) (Figure 1B). Test stimulus presentation started
with the broadcast of the masker. The target signal was presented 1 s after the onset of the masker
such that the target signal was embedded in the masker.
Walking responses to the target signal and masker in isolation
Flies remained quiescent in the absence of stimulus presentation. When presented with the standard
76 dB SPL 2 s cricket song from 0˚ azimuth (Figure 1A) flies responded with a latency of
56.45 ± 2.76 ms after stimulus onset; forward velocity increased to a sustained level of 6.03 ± 0.28
cm/s (Figure 2A) while steering velocity fluctuated around 0 cm/s (Figure 2B). Flies exhibited sus-
tained walking with an angular heading of 2.93 ± 5.25˚ and covered a total distance of 16.91 ± 0.91
cm (Figure 2C). When subjected to the masker alone from the forward location (0˚ azimuth) at the
same intensity, flies responded with a similar latency of 52.19 ± 3.32 ms (Paired Sample T-Test:
n = 13 flies t = 0.741, p = 0.477). After masker onset, forward velocity increased transiently to levels
less than those observed in response to the target signal, but rapidly declined to near baseline levels
(Figure 2A). Steering velocity appeared to fluctuate more sporadically around 0 cm/s (Figure 2B) as
flies responded with a different mean angular heading of 0.76 ± 4.03˚ (Watson U2 Test: n = 13,
U2 = 0.256, p = 0.01). Although walking responses were directed toward the masker location,
responses were short-lived and thus flies traveled a significantly shorter total distance of 2.08 ± 1.01
cm (Paired Sample T-Test: n = 13 flies, t = 9.983, p < 0.001, Figure 2C). Flies did not perform nega-
tive phonotaxis (away from the masker) in response to the masker in isolation.
Increased spatial separation does not decrease masked behavioural
response thresholds
We estimated behavioural response thresholds using an approached described in Bee and Schwartz
(2009). Behavioural response thresholds depended on the masking condition (Repeated Measures
ANOVA: F(1.12, 12.33) = 72.36, p < 0.001, Figure 3). In quiet, flies responded with phonotaxis to the
target signal at a mean threshold intensity of 50.80 ± 5.44 dB SPL. Adding a masker that was spa-
tially separated by 6˚ from the frontal signal (small separation) significantly increased response
thresholds to 63.31 ± 2.64 dB SPL (F(1, 11) = 66.39, p < 0.001). Increasing the spatial separation from
6˚ to 90˚ (large separation) between the target signal and masker resulted in a mean response
threshold of 63.19 ± 2.96 dB SPL that did not differ significantly from response thresholds when the
signal and masker was separated by 6˚ (F(1, 11) = 0.07, p = 0.80).
Effects of SNR and source separation on sound localization
Response latencies for the target signal were not significantly affected by SNR (Repeated Measures
ANOVA: F(2,12) = 0.412, p = 0.671) or source separation (F(1,6) = 0.001, p = 0.974). Flies responded
with an average latency of 59.51 ± 3.51 ms. Total distance travelled did not depend on source sepa-
ration (F(1,9) = 0.092, p = 0.768) but was significantly affected by SNR (F(2,18) = 8.601, p = 0.002). A
linear contrast revealed that walking distance increased with SNR (linear contrast: F(1,9) = 15.456,
p = 0.03). With an increase in SNR from �6 dB to +6 dB, walking distance increased from
11.35 ± 1.81 cm to 16.36 ± 1.12 cm. Post Hoc contrasts revealed that a SNR of �6 dB resulted in sig-
nificantly shorter distances walked than at higher SNRs (�6 dB vs 0 dB SNR: F(1, 1) = 8.466,
p = 0.017; �6 dB vs +6 dB SNR: F(1, 1) = 15.456, p = 0.003).
Forward velocity profiles reveal a strong but brief walking component in response to the masker
that quickly decayed before song onset (Figure 4A). During song presentation, forward velocity
increased as a function of SNR (Repeated Measures ANOVA: F(2,14) = 25.381, p < 0.001) but not
song and masker separation (F(1,7) = 1.866, p = 0.214). With an increase in SNR from �6 dB to +6
dB SNR, average forward velocity increased from 2.26 ± 0.46 cm/s to 4.67 ± 0.39 cm/s but all were
significantly less than the average forward velocity of 6.03 ± 0.28 cm/s in response to the song in iso-
lation (Control vs. �6 dB SNR: F(1,9) = 56.86, p < 0.001, Control vs. 0 dB SNR: F(1,9) = 46.79,

 p < 0.001, Control vs.+6 dB SNR: F(1,9) = 26.24, p = 0.001). SNR-dependent changes in forward
velocity corresponded with SNR-dependent changes in walking distances (above).
At the onset of the masker, flies initiated small, transient steering responses toward the masker
(negative velocities) with durations that depended on masker intensity (F(2,14) = 7.804, p = 0.05,
Figure 4B) but not location (F(1,7) = 1.828, p = 0.218, Figure 4B). Steering toward the masker lasted
between 65.00 ± 20.44 ms and 157.01 ± 29.59 ms as masker intensity was dropped from 82 dB to
70 dB SPL. This was followed by a quick transition to steering away from the masker.
Overall walking direction (angular heading) depended on the spatial separation between the sig-
nal and masker (Two-way Circular ANOVA (hk test): n = 13, F(1,65) = 8.0324, p = 0.0061, Figure 4C),
but not SNR (F(2,65) = 1.2105, p = 0.3047), or the interaction between source separation and SNR
(F(2,65) = 0.7298, p = 0.4859). In response to the simultaneous broadcast of the target signal and
masker from speakers separated by 6˚ (small separation), there was a slight tendency for flies to
deviate further from the control direction with greater directional variability at the lowest SNRs. With
a short latency after the onset of signal presentation, flies steered away from the masker with an
overall average velocity of 0.37 ± 0.15 cm/s that did not significantly change to different SNRs (F(2,14)
= 1.115, p = 0.355, Figure 4B). Flies responded with similar angular headings (�6 dB:
�10.19 ± 14.99˚, 0 dB: �4.85 ± 7.41˚, +6 dB: �5.69 ± 4.41˚) for all SNR treatments and these dif-
fered significantly from controls (2.93 ± 5.25˚) (Hotelling’s Pair-Sample Test: control vs. �6 dB SNR,
n = 11, F = 5.7276, p = 0.0249; control vs. equal dB SNR, n = 13, F = 7.0532, p = 0.0107, control
vs. +6 dB SNR, n = 13, F = 14.1137, p = 0.0012, Figure 4C).
In response to the simultaneous broadcast of target signal and masker separated by 90˚ (large
separation), flies oriented to different
mean angular headings at different
SNRs (�6
dB:
�15.02 ± 7.42˚, 0 dB: �12.75 ± 3.75˚, +6 dB: �10.39 ± 2.19˚), all of which were significantly different
from responses to controls (control vs. �6 dB SNR, n = 13 F = 6.6895, p = 0.0238; control vs. equal
dB SNR, n = 13, F = 37.8136, p < 0.0001, control vs. +6 dB SNR, n = 13, F = 43.6432, p < 0.0001,
Figure 4C). At �6 dB SNR, angular heading did not differ for the two source separations (�6 dB
SNR 6˚ vs. 90˚: F = 0.7372, n = 13, p = 0.5173). However, signal and masker separation caused a sig-
nificant shift contralateral to the location of the masker for 0 dB and +6 dB SNR respectively (0 dB
SNR 6˚ vs. 90˚ separation: F = 7.0648, n = 13, p = 0.0106, +6 dB SNR 6˚ vs. 90˚ separation:
F = 3.9304, n = 13, p = 0.055, Figure 4C). Steering velocity depended on source separation (F(1,7) =
9.193, p = 0.019, Figure 4B). When the signal and masker were separated by 90˚, steering velocity
increased to 1.07 ± 0.34 cm/s and movement was directed away from the target signal and masker
(Figure 4C).
Effects of balanced temporal pattern interference on localization
accuracy
Additional behavioural experiments were conducted to establish whether binaurally balanced noise
would restore accurate signal localization. In these experiments, we equalized temporal pattern
interference with a second coherent (identical) masker positioned at a location that is a direct mirror
reflection of the other masker location (Figure 1A). When the signal was presented in isolation, flies
walked a total distance of 7.74 ± 0.45 cm and localized a frontal 76 dB SPL signal with an angular
heading of �0.32 ± 3.1˚ (Figure 5A). When the masker was broadcast along with the target signal at
equal intensity and spatially separated by 6˚ to the right (Figure 5B) or left (Figure 5C) of the target
signal speaker, flies responded with mean angular headings contralateral to the masker location
(right masker: �13.46 ± 7.95˚, left masker: 11.46 ± 7.80˚). When the signal and masker were sepa-
rated by 90˚ (Figure 5E,F) flies responded with significantly different mean angular headings (6˚ vs.
90˚ separation right masker: n = 12, U2 = 0.51, p < 0.001, 6˚ vs. 90˚ separation left masker: n = 12,
U2 = 0.51, p < 0.001) that were diverted further away from the signal location (right masker:
�47.04 ± 11.91˚, left masker: 46.93 ± 16.08˚). With a second identical masker, regardless of whether

Tympanal measurements
We hypothesized that these results could be explained by the interaction of an asymmetrically
placed masker with the directional properties of O. ochracea’s peripheral auditory system, which
would differentially bias the perceived SNR at each ear. Because the masker-ipsilateral ear would
show a stronger masker-driven response than the contralateral, whereas the signal-driven responses
of the two ears would be equal. We refer to this ear-specific SNR as the effective amplitude of

followed by steering movements away from the masker that were maintained for the remainder of stimulus presentation. Steering responses were
minimally affected by SNR but were enhanced at greater signal and masker separation. At song onset, forward velocities increased to speeds well

 responses (i.e. response to target signal above the response to masker) to avoid confusion with the
SNR of the broadcast stimulus, which we manipulated in our experiments (Figure 6A). The overall
effect of such a bias in effective response amplitude would be to mimic binaural cues for a lateral
signal source location (Figure 9). We verified that this was the case by recording tympanal vibrations
with a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). We recorded tympanal responses for repeated presentations
of a target signal and masker separated by 6˚ or 90˚, matching speaker configurations in behavioural
experiments (Figure 6). Both tympana vibrate at the onset of the masker and continued to do so
throughout masker presentation. Vibration amplitudes were elevated during target signal presenta-
tion. When the signal and masker were separated by 6˚, the effective amplitude was only slightly
larger in the masker-contralateral ear compared to the masker-ipsilateral ear (Figure 6B,D). When
the spatial separation between the target signal and masker was increased to 90˚, there was a pro-
nounced increase in effective amplitude measured from the masker-contralateral ear (Figure 6C,D).
To quantify this effect, tympanal vibrations were recorded in response to a range of broadcast
SNRs when the target signal and masker were separated by 90˚. Effective response amplitude
depended on the SNR (Repeated Measures ANOVA: n = 6, F(1.08, 5.41) = 34.13, p = 0.001) and
masker location (F(1, 5) = 14.44, p = 0.013), but not the interaction between SNR and masker location
(F(1.10, 5.46) = 2.46, p = 0.173). The effective amplitude increased with increasing SNR and was
greater for the masker-contralateral tympanum across all SNRs (Figure 7A).
We determined the ’effective’ interaural vibration amplitude difference (IVAD) as a difference in
the effective response amplitude between the ears. We applied our IVAD measurements and previ-
ously published tympanal directionality data (Robert et al., 1996b) to generate predictions of the
apparent incident sound direction for the target signal embedded in the masker (Figure 7B). Pre-
dicted incident sound directions closely matched mean angular headings measured in behavioural
experiments across all SNRs (Figure 7C). For example, at equal SNR (0 dB), the interaural effective
amplitude difference was measured to be �2.76 ± 0.54 dB which translates to a predicted incident
sound direction of �15.10 ± 5.16˚. At this SNR, flies localized a sound direction of �12.75 ± 3.75˚
and this did not differ significantly from the predicted incident sound direction of the target signal
(Watson-Williams F-test: F = 0.17, p = 0.69).
A SNR of �6 dB resulted in an interaural effective amplitude difference of 1.71 ± 0.75 dB and a
predicted incident sound direction of 10.85 ± 6.79˚. A mean interaural effective amplitude of
2.76 ± 0.54 dB was measured for a SNR of 0 dB and this corresponds to an incident sound direction
of 15.10 ± 5.16˚. When the SNR was increased to +6 dB, this resulted in a measured interaural effec-
tive amplitude difference of 2.35 ± 0.66 dB and a predicted sound direction of 13.48 ± 6.39˚. These
apparent incident sound directions, predicted by effective response amplitude differences, closely
matched actual angular headings in behavioural responses (see above) (all p-values > 0.05).

contralateral to the masker location.

 Neural measurements
To determine if peripheral neural responses support the hypothesis that the salience of auditory
stimuli is determined by the effective amplitude, we made multi-unit recordings from the left and
right frontal (auditory) nerve simultaneously in response to the target signal and masker separated
by 90˚ (Figure 8A). We applied signal detection theory to determine the masker level at which mask-
ing occurred for the frontal target signal masked by an ipsilateral or contralateral masker
(Figure 8B). In quiet, auditory-evoked impulses were stereotypically timed with the occurrence of
the pulse pattern (target signal) (Figure 8A). As masker intensity was increased, acoustically evoked
impulses occurred at the onset of the masker and continued to occur randomly in time throughout
masker presentation. Target signal-driven activity was readily discernible at high SNR, but became
obscured by masker-driven activity at lower SNRs (greater masker levels). The SNR at which target-
signal driven activity was masked was lower for the masker-contralateral ear compared to the
masker-ipsilateral ear (Figure 8A). For the masker-contralateral ear, signal detection occurred up to
a masker level of 66.75 ± 0.73 dB. However, signal detection from the masker-ipsilateral ear was lim-
ited to a significantly lower masker level of 59.66 ± 0.58 dB (Paired T-Test: n = 10, t = 7.562,
p < 0.001) (Figure 8C). In other words, target signal detection was possible at a much higher masker
level for the masker-contralateral ear compared to the masker-ipsilateral ear. Thus, the masker-con-
tralateral ear was most sensitive to target signal detection.
Discussion
Ormia ochracea responded with greater walking distances, consistent response latencies, and local-
ized the target signal with improved accuracy in the absence of a masker. Broadcasting the masker
over the target signal increased response thresholds and compromised the ability of flies to resolve
signal location at all SNRs. Changes in SNR altered walking distance, and to a lesser extent, walking
direction. However, increasing the spatial separation from 6˚ (small separation) to 90˚ (large separa-
tion) between the target signal and masker did not improve signal localization or decrease behaviou-
ral response thresholds, but caused flies to divert their walking responses even further away from
both sources. More interestingly, the direction of diverted walking was not random, but depended
on the masker location.
Beyond demonstrating the potential lack of SRM in O. ochracea, our goals were to show how
spatial separation between a target signal and masker affects localization responses, and peripheral
sensory mechanisms that may account for localization behaviour. In experiments that test for SRM, a
masker can be presented from a forward location while a target signal is displaced relative to the
masker (Caldwell et al., 2016; Holt and Schusterman, 2007). Similar to some previous studies that
have successfully shown SRM, we chose to present a target signal from a fixed forward direction
while a masker was displaced relative to the target signal (Dent et al., 2009; Litovsky, 2005; Turn-
bull, 1994). This target signal location allowed us to easily assess the accuracy of sound localization
(i.e. localization to 0˚ azimuth in response to a forward target signal). Several response characteristics
of open-loop walking phonotaxis in O. ochracea would render assessment of localization accuracy
difficult when a target signal is displaced relative to a forward masker. Under open-loop tethered
walking phonotaxis, O. ochracea receive no corrective sensory feedback when orienting on the
treadmill. As a result, turns toward a lateral target signal location tend to overshoot actual source
azimuth (Mason et al., 2005). Furthermore, O. ochracea exhibit graded turning responses that vary
with sound direction, but saturate for sound presentation angles greater than ±30˚ azimuth
(Mason et al., 2001). Both of these considerations would make it problematic to quantify the accu-
racy of phonotaxis, since the predicted orientation is only clearly defined for a forward-located
source.

 Diverted walking responses appear to be
driven by directional response properties of the
two tympana that altered the perceived location
of the target signal (Lee et al., 2009). For a fron-
tal sound source, both left and right tympana are
expected to respond equally in timing and ampli-
tude (Robert et al., 1996b), resulting in equiva-
lent afferent activity on both sides of the auditory
system. Under this symmetrical stimulation, flies
perceived the target signal location to be straight
ahead and responded by phonotaxis to a forward
location (Figure 2C). Our laser vibrometry meas-
urements indicate that adding a masker posi-
tioned off the midline axis caused the two
tympana to vibrate asymmetrically (Figures 6 and
7). The masker-ipsilateral tympanum exhibited a
stronger masker-driven response compared to
the masker-contralateral tympanum (Figure 7A).
Consequently, the masker-contralateral tympa-
num responded with a lower noise floor that
allowed
for
a
greater
signal-driven
effective
amplitude of vibration relative to the masker-ipsi-
lateral tympanum. Neural measurements from
the left and right auditory nerve also revealed
that target signal detection was possible at
higher masker levels for the masker-contralateral
ear and thus, resulted in better signal detection
(Figure 8). Consistent with our hypothesis, flies
orient to a sound-source direction that is a func-
tion of the relative effective amplitude between
the two tympana and in the direction of the ear
with the best signal detection (Figure 9). When a
second identical masker was broadcast to equal-
ize masking interference on both sides of the
auditory system, symmetry in target signal tem-
poral pattern input was restored and diverted
walking responses were corrected so that flies
localized the target signal location accurately
(Figure 5).
The nature of auditory coding in O. ochracea
suggests that an effect of continuous noise would
be to decrease the effective (or perceived) inten-
sity of an attractive stimulus. At the neural level
most auditory receptors in O. ochracea are Type
I afferents that are phasic and precisely mark the
onset of a sound pulse with a single spike fol-
lowed by a refractory period of approximately 4
ms (Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002). Type II afferents
respond similarly but with several spikes at pulse
onset (Oshinsky and Hoy, 2002). This is a coding
strategy that exploits the predictable, pulsatile
pattern of cricket songs by registering the onset
timing of successive pulses within a chirp with
synchronous bursts of phasic afferent activity. A
smaller population of afferents, Type III, are tonic
and
maintain spiking

 duration of sound pulses (Oshinsky and Hoy,
2002). Continuous noise is not expected to elicit
regular activity in Type I or II afferents (although
stochastic amplitude fluctuations in the noise
envelope may elicit synchronous afferent spikes).
The overall effect, therefore, is to set the noise
floor above which a signal-driven increment in
vibration amplitude is required to elicit a neural
response. For a point-source noise, these effects
are greater in the noise-ipsilateral ear and will
tend to simulate a directional bias of the song
location in the direction of the noise-contralat-
eral ear.
At the onset of the masker, our noise stimulus
may have evoked Type 1 afferents to fire simi-
larly to the onset of sound pulses within a cricket
song. Thus at the onset of the masker, flies ori-
ented transiently to the masker (Figure 4) but
did not sustain walking (Figure 3) in the absence
of an attractive temporal pattern. When flies per-
ceived an attractive source over the masker, the
strength of phonotaxis increased in a SNR-
dependent manner (Figures 3 and 5).
In our experiments, band-limited noise was used to interfere with temporal pattern input. In simi-
lar experiments, Wendler (1989) and Stabel et al. (1989) presented a constant tone from an azi-
muthal location that asymmetrically disrupted temporal pattern input to the cricket auditory system.
This resulted in diverted walking responses away from the tone location (Stabel et al., 1989; Wen-
dler, 1989). Neural measurements revealed that the activity of the tone-contralateral auditory inter-
neurons (AN1 and AN2) better represented the song temporal pattern (Stabel et al., 1989). More
recent behavioural experiments have shown that song pattern recognition modulates the strength of
phonotaxis, while the direction of localization depends on reactive steering to individual sound
pulses (Hedwig and Poulet, 2004, 2005; Poulet and Hedwig, 2005). These results suggest that
crickets responded to a direction that should balance auditory input. When we introduced a second
coherent masker on the opposite side of the auditory system to balance temporal pattern interfer-
ence, symmetrical auditory input was restored and flies accurately localized the frontal attractive
sound source. Our results extend these previous findings to show that the mechanically coupled ears
of O. ochracea function as a sensitive bilateral symmetry detector for song temporal pattern. Flies
engage in turning responses in attempt to balance temporal pattern input for accurate sound
localization.
Animals often experience lower masked thresholds when masking noise is spatially separated
from signals of interest (Caird et al., 1989; Dent et al., 1997; Hine et al., 1994; Holt and Schuster-
man, 2007; Ison and Agrawal, 1998; Schmidt and Ro
¨mer, 2011; Schwartz and Gerhardt, 1989;
Warnecke et al., 2014). SRM necessitates that peripheral directionality will give rise to different
interaural cues associated with a target signal and noise that vary as a function of spatial separation
(Caldwell et al., 2014). The magnitude of SRM may be further enhanced by central mechanisms
(Brunnhofer et al., 2016; Lin and Feng, 2003). Despite peripheral directionality provided by the
mechanically coupled ears of O. ochracea, our behavioural threshold measurements provide no evi-
dence of SRM in O. ochracea. Specifically, with increased spatial separations from 6˚ to 90˚ azimuth,
we did not observe any indication of SRM. This is in stark contrast to some other animals that
undoubtedly experience SRM over similar target signal and noise separations (i.e. from 7.5˚ to 90˚
separation between a target signal and masker) (Bee, 2007). However, our current results do not
exclude the possibility that SRM may occur at smaller azimuthal separations (<6˚ azimuth). Further
experiments that measure behavioural response thresholds to a target signal and masker presented
from the same spatial location would address this possibility. Even if SRM occurs at smaller spatial
separations, our results would suggest that any SRM in O. ochracea is rather limited and saturates
quickly beyond 6˚ of spatial separation.

 We suggest two reasons that may explain this unexpected result. When signal and noise arise
from the same spatial location, each ear will experience identical binaural cues (ITD and ILD) from
both sources. As signal and noise are spatially separated, differences in these cues associated with
each source will occur at both ears. First, the auditory system of O. ochracea may be unable to

 segregate interaural cues of the target signal from those that are associated with the noise source
and this may be one limitation to the function of mechanically coupled ears. SRM does not appear
to function in grasshoppers for similar reasons (Ronacher and Hoffmann, 2003). In grasshoppers,
directional information and temporal recognition are processed in parallel such that input from both
sides of the auditory system are summed internally (von Helversen, 1984; von Helversen and von
Helversen, 1995) and thus, binaural cues associated with an attractive signal would be mixed with
binaural cues associated with noise. Second, when a point source noise was positioned asymmetri-
cally about the midline axis, flies performed phonotaxis in the direction of the ear with better tempo-
ral pattern detection (‘better ear’). The noise source provided directional masking that caused a shift
in the perceived location of the target signal location away from the actual source location (Figures 5
and 6) and flies responded by turning in a direction that would balance temporal pattern input.
Under more natural conditions (with freely walking flies), this would still allow successful localization
of the target (host) source. Initially, misdirected movement would result in a shift of the relative spa-
tial positions of the target and noise sources allowing flies to arrive at the target by an indirect path.
Previous work has shown that for multiple competing attractive sources, flies rely on temporal cues
for source segregation, via a precedence effect, combined with a preference for forward locations
(Lee et al., 2009). We now show that noise can bias the perceived directionality of attractive sour-
ces. Future studies will examine how these processes interact to support the surprising spatial hear-
ing abilities of O. ochracea.
Materials and methods
Animals
Experiments were conducted on lab-reared gravid female Ormia ochracea derived from a popula-
tion originally collected in Gainesville FL. Flies were maintained in environmentally controlled cham-
bers (Power Scientific, Inc. Model DROS52503, Pipersville PA, USA) at 25˚C and 75% humidity on a
12 hr:12 hr light:dark regime and fed nectar solution (The Birding Company, Yarmouth MA, USA) ad
libitum.
Acoustic stimuli
The attractive stimulus (target signal) was a synthetic song modeled after Gryllus rubens trills that
was constructed from ramped (1 ms on/off) 10 ms duration sound pulses with a carrier frequency of
5 kHz. In behavioural experiments (Experiments 1, 2, and 3) individual sound pulses were repeated
at 50 pulses/s to form 2 s trills. In laser vibrometry experiments, the target signal consists of individ-
ual sound pulses repeated at 50 pulses/s to form 2 s trills or a simplified version was generated by
shortening the 2 s trill to 40 ms (2-pulse stimulus).
The 2-pulse stimulus was used in neurophysiology experiments. Noise stimuli (masker) were 4 s
bursts of band-limited (~2–7 kHz) random noise. Stimulus waveforms (Figure 1B) were synthesized in
MATLAB (R2009b, MathWorks, Natick, MA) and converted to analog signals using National Instru-
ments acquisition hardware (NI USB-6251, 44100 Hz, Austin TX), amplified (Realistic SA-10 Solid
State Amplifier MOD-31-1982B, Taiwan) and broadcast through Skullcandy earbuds (Model: INK’D,
China). Sound sources were calibrated at the start of each day of experiments. Target signal levels
were software controlled and calibrated (peak RMS, re. 20 mPa) using a probe microphone (B&K
Type 4182, Denmark) powered by B&K Nexus Conditioning Amplifier (Denmark). The continuous
masker lacked temporal structure and contained broad spectrum energy that overlapped and
masked temporal and spectral features of the 5 kHz cricket song (Figure 1B). Masker levels were

masker-driven random noise floor. Such binaural effective amplitude differences are larger for larger spatial
separations between the target signal and masker. This translates to better signal detection in the masker-
contralateral ear (exemplar multi-unit recordings from the auditory nerve shown when the target signal and masker
are separated by 90˚). Binaural effective amplitude differences potentially encode ‘perceived’ target signal
location. Flies respond by localizing a direction that is diverted away from the target signal and masker.

 calibrated as long-term RMS amplitudes of specific SPLs (re. 20 mPa; C- weighted) over 30 s using a
B&K sound level meter (Type 2231).
Behavioural experiments
Prior to behavioural testing, flies were anaesthetized by cooling on ice for 5 min, then mounted to a
tether attached to a micromanipulator (Narishige BC-4) with a small amount of wax applied to the
dorsum. Recovery from the tethering procedure usually occurred within 5 min. After recovery, flies
were positioned on top of the treadmill system and adjusted with the micromanipulator to assume
the natural walking posture (Mason et al., 2001). Flies were allowed to acclimate for another 20 min
before testing.
Experimental apparatus
Behavioural measurements were made from tethered flies performing walking phonotaxis on a high-
resolution treadmill system situated equidistant (Experiments 1 and 3: 20 cm, Experiment 2: 10 cm)
from all test speakers (Figure 1A) and surrounded by acoustic echo-attenuating foam. The treadmill
system consists of a light-weight table tennis ball held afloat by a constant airstream above a modi-
fied optical mouse sensor (ADNS 2620, Avago Technologies, USA). Walking responses were trans-
duced as rotations of the treadmill that actuated the optical mouse sensor to record changes in x
and y pixel units at a sampling rate of 2160 Hz (Lott et al., 2007). Pixel units were calibrated to
actual walking distances by measuring displacement of points on the ball from highspeed video foot-
age (Lightning RDT) synchronized to pixel data captured by the treadmill system (Midas, Xcitex).
Data collection by the treadmill system was controlled by Stimprog version 5.14b ‘treadmill’ devel-
oped as a MATLAB GUI that interfaced with the National Instruments data acquisition system to
ensure synchronous sound presentation and the recording of walking traces. Stimprog is available
via GitHub (https://github.com/Ormia/Stimprog.git, (Lee and Mason, 2017b); with a copy archived
at https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Stimprog).
In all experiments, the target signal was presented from a frontal speaker located at 0˚ azimuth
relative to the fly’s midline axis. In experiments involving a small spatial separation between the tar-
get signal and masker, the maskerwas broadcast from a speaker directly adjacent and to the left or
right of the target signal, giving 6˚ of spatial separation. In experiments involving a large spatial sep-
aration, the masker was broadcast from a laterally positioned speaker located at ±90˚ azimuth.
Experiment 1: Estimating behavioural response thresholds
Behavioural response thresholds were estimated using an adaptive tracking procedure as described
in Bee and Schwartz (2009). We considered translational movements greater than 1 cm to be valid
behavioural responses. To estimate behavioral response thresholds in quiet (absence of a masker),
the initial target signal level was set to 76 dB SPL and was decreased in 3 dB steps until a non-
response was reached. In a final test, the target signal level was increased by half a step size (1.5
dB). If the subject responded to this final test, this signal level was specified as the upper bound
(UB) of the estimate. Otherwise, the final signal level was deemed to be the lower bound (LB) of the
estimate. The estimated response threshold was calculated as:
Recognition threshold = 10*log10 [(10(UB/10)+10(LB/10))/2]
In a within-subjects design, this procedure was repeated for signal and masker speakers sepa-
rated by 6˚ and 90˚ angles. The masker intensity was set to 76 dB SPL. Response thresholds were
compared in a repeated measures ANOVA.
Experiment 2: Localizing an attractive signal in the presence of a directional
masker
The goal of this experiment was to determine if cricket song localization is impaired in the presence
of a masker and whether increased spatial separation between the target signal and masker would
ameliorate this impairment. The target signal (see above) presented at 76 dB SPL in the absence of
a masker served as the positive control stimulus. The masker was also broadcast at 76 dB SPL in the
absence of an attractive signal as a negative control. Test stimuli consisted of a combination of the
standard cricket trill (target signal) broadcast at different levels (70, 76, and 82 dB SPL) simulta-
neously with the masker to achieve three signal-to-noise ratios (�6 dB, 0 dB, +6 dB SNR) in two

 different spatial configurations (6˚ and 90˚ spatial separations) to form a 2 by 3 factorial design. Stim-
uli were timed such that the target signal occurred midway through the masker presentation (begin-
ning one second after the onset of the masker playback and finishing one second before the masker
offset) (Figure 1B). Flies were tested under a repeated measures design such that 3–6 responses
were collected for each unique combination of SNR and spatial separation (number of responses dif-
fered because response probability decreased at lowest SNR). A test sequence for a fly commenced
with three negative controls, a block of half the test stimuli in random order, one mid-sequence con-
trol stimulus, the remaining block of test stimuli in random order, and ended with three more posi-
tive and negative control stimulus presentations.
Data analysis
X and Y coordinates from treadmill data traces were collected at 2160 Hz to construct virtual walking
trajectories. Walking velocities were separated into two components: (1) steering velocities and (2)
forward velocities were calculated as changes in x or y coordinates respectively over time. Angular
heading was calculated as in Mason et al. (2005). Responses collected under the same speaker sep-
arations but for the reversed position were combined by mirroring responses relative to 0˚ azimuth.
Repeated responses for the same stimulus conditions were averaged within individuals. Unless other-
wise specified, data given as mean ± SEM.
Response latencies and walking distances may indicate signal detectability, but we cannot rule
out the possibility that they may also be influenced by the motivation to respond. Steering and for-
ward velocities are associated with walking direction. Steering velocities indicate the strength of
turning towards or away from a laterally positioned masker. Forward velocities indicate response
strength directed to the song location. Angular headings indicate the actual direction of walking.
Separate repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess the dependence of latency, distance,
steering and forward velocities, on spatial separation and SNR. Each ANOVA consist of 2 spatial sep-
arations (within subjects)�3 SNRs (within subjects). Currently, there is no consensus on statistical
models equivalent to a repeated measures ANOVA for circular data. Repeated measurements of
angular data across factors were treated as independent groups and a two-factor circular ANOVA
(hk test) was used to compare the effects of SNR and spatial separation on angular heading.
If target signal localization is impaired by the presence of a point-source masker, we predicted
that flies would exhibit longer response latencies, shorter walking distances, and walking directions
(angular heading) that deviate from the target signal location in the presence of a masker. We fur-
ther predicted that flies would show improvements in these response measures if the target signal
and masker are spatially separated and broadcast at greater SNRs.
Experiment 3: Examining the effects of balanced temporal pattern
interference on localization accuracy
The goal of this experiment was to test if symmetry in temporal pattern input may correct deviated
localization responses observed in Experiment 2 (Figure 4). A frontally located song results in sym-
metrical temporal pattern input to both sides of the auditory system. Asymmetry in temporal pattern
input was achieved by exploiting the inherent directional response characteristic of the ears to a
point source masker. We manipulated the degree of asymmetry by varying the spatial separation
between a target signal and masker with identical speaker arrangements as in Experiment 2
(referred to as: Asymmetric with a 6˚ (small) spatial separation and Asymmetric and with a 90˚ (large)
spatial separation). To induce symmetrical temporal pattern input in the presence of a point source
masker, we introduced an identical (coherent) masker positioned at a location that is a direct mirror
reflection of the other noise speaker (Figures 1A and 5D,G). In the Symmetric and small spatial sep-
aration condition, the signal speaker is flanked by two maskers at ±6˚, while in the Symmetric and
large separation condition the maskers are located at ±90˚ (Figure 5D,G). The control condition was
identical to that of Experiment 2. The test stimulus consists of the attractive stimulus broadcast at 76
dB SPL along with a single masker broadcast at 76 dB SPL (Asymmetric conditions) or two coherent
maskers each broadcast at 70 dB SPL to result in an overall level of 76 dB SPL (Symmetric condi-
tions). The timing of signal and masker broadcast was kept identical to timing relationships estab-
lished in Experiment 2. Each fly was tested five times per acoustic condition (type of symmetry and
target signal masker separation) in random order, for a total of 30 test responses per fly.

 Data analysis
If symmetrical temporal pattern input to both sides of the auditory system is critical for accurate
song localization, we predicted that the addition of a second masker (see above) should re-establish
symmetry and correct deviated localization responses. Mid-response angular heading is a direct
measure of walking direction, and was extracted from virtual walking trajectories as in Experiment 2.
According to our prediction, mid-angular headings to target signal alone should not differ from
responses to Symmetric acoustic conditions, but should significantly differ from responses to Asym-
metric acoustic conditions. We applied the Watson’s U test to compare differences in angular head-
ings under different acoustic conditions.
Experiments examining peripheral sensory mechanisms
In separate experiments, we explored peripheral sensory mechanisms that may contribute to
diverted walking responses at the level of the tympanum and the auditory nerve. Prior to experi-
ments, flies were mounted on a custom holder. In laser vibrometry experiments, the fly’s head was
removed to provide access to the two tympana. A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) (Polytec OFV
3001 controller, OFV 511 sensor head, or PSV-400) was used to record tympanal vibrations.
Responses from the masker-ipsilateral and masker-contralateral tympanum were measured by posi-
tioning the focused laser beam on each tympanal pit in separate measurements. In neurophysiology
experiments, the fly’s head was left intact but the wings, dorsum, flight muscles, and gut were
removed to provide access to the location at which the frontal (auditory) nerve converges onto the
prothoracic ganglion (CNS). Tungsten electrodes (A-M Systems Inc., 5 MW) were positioned on each
of the left and right frontal nerves using Leica micromanipulators (model # 117777). Multi-unit
recordings were made simultaneously from both auditory nerves and amplified using an A-M Sys-
tems Microelectrode Amplifier (Model 1800). Analog signals from laser vibrometry and neurophysiol-
ogy experiments were digitized with National Instruments data acquisition hardware (sampling rate
of 44100 Hz) and saved using custom software (Stimprog 5.2) developed in MATLAB.
Target signal and masker speakers were positioned in the large (90˚) spatial separation configura-
tion (as above) and presented at varied SNRs. In laser vibrometry experiments, different SNRs were
achieved by varying the signal level relative to the masker at 76 dB SPL. We recorded three sweeps
in response to each of 3 SNRs (�6, 0, +6 dB) within subjects. In neurophysiology experiments, differ-
ent SNRs were achieved by varying the masker level relative to a 76 dB SPL target signal. We
recorded 20 sweeps per SNR and tested 6 SNRs (�18 to +6 dB in 6 dB intervals) within subjects.
Data analysis
In laser vibrometry experiments, we calculated a sliding RMS amplitude for the masker alone during
a 1 s epoch leading up to the simultaneous presentation of the signal and masker. A sliding RMS
amplitude value was also calculated over an equivalent time window during the signal and masker
epoch. RMS values were converted to dB to calculate a dB difference between the response of the
tympanum during the masker alone epoch compared to the signal and masker epoch. This dB differ-
ence represents the magnitude of tympanal response to the target signal that is above the ‘noise
floor’ (Figure 6A). These dB differences were computed in response to an ipsilateral and contralat-
eral masker and statistically compared in a repeated measures ANOVA.
Target signal-driven effective interaural vibration amplitude differences (IVADs) were computed
using the dB difference values. Based on these IVAD measurements, we predicted the direction of
sound localizations by using eardrum directionality measurements from a previously published study.
Data points from a plot of IVAD as a function of incident sound direction (figure 7B from
Robert et al. (1996b) were digitally captured using Meazure 2.0 (written by Baron Roberts, C Thing
Software) and fitted to a sigmoid curve using fminsearch in MATLAB. The predicted direction of
apparent source location was determined as the angle of sound incidence along the fitted curve that
corresponded with our calculated IVAD measurements. These predictions were compared to the
actual direction of sound localization measured in behavioural experiments.
In neurophysiology experiments, we applied signal detection theory to determine masked thresh-
olds for the target signal embedded in the masker. Thresholds for counting auditory evoked
impulses were determined as three standard deviations above the RMS over an epoch of the record-
ing in the absence of any acoustic stimulation. The mean and variance of impulse rates were

 determined over an epoch of masker alone and a separate epoch of target signal plus
masker during an equivalent time window of 40 ms. We calculated detection thresholds using da
(standard separation), a modified version of the more well-known d0 (detectability index) because da
does not make any assumptions of equal variances in the distribution of impulse rates in response to
masker alone and target signal in noise. We calculated the standard separation da as (Simpson and
Fitter, 1973):
da = (m(n+s) - m(n))/H(s2
(n+s)-s2
(n))/2)
Sigmoid curves were fitted to da values for each masker location using fminsearch. The signal
detection threshold was determined as the lowest signal level along the fitted curve that corre-
sponded to a da value exceeding 1.0.
