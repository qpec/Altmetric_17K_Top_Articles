Abstract
Purpose Treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases
(PIDD) with subcutaneous (SC) infusions of IgG preceded
by injection of recombinant human hyaluronidase
(rHuPH20) (IGHy) to increase SC tissue permeability was
evaluated in two consecutive, prospective, non-controlled,
multi-center studies.
Methods Subjects >4 years of age received SC IgG replace-
ment at a weekly dose equivalent of 108 % of their previous
intravenous (IV) dose, facilitated by prior injection of 75 U/g
IgG of rHuPH20. Starting with weekly SC infusions, the in-
terval was increased (ramped-up) to a 3- or 4-week schedule.
Results Eighty-three subjects (24<18 years; 59≥18 years)
received 2729 infusions (excluding ramp-up) at a mean dose
of 0.155 g/kg/week in the pivotal and 0.156 g/kg/week in the
extension study. IGHy exposure exceeded 30 months in 48
subjects.
During 187.7 subject-years of IGHy exposure, 2005 ad-
verse events (AEs) (10.68 per subject-year) occurred. The rate
of related systemic AEs during consecutive 1-year periods
remained low; the rate of related local AEs decreased from
3.68/subject-year in months 1–12 to approximately 1.50/sub-
ject-year after 30 months of treatment. Fifteen subjects tran-

Introduction
Subcutaneous (SC) immunoglobulin (IgG) replacement ther-
apy in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases
(PIDD) has been shown to be as efficacious as intravenous
(IV) treatment while causing fewer systemic adverse reactions
[1–4]. SC infusion proved to be beneficial specifically in pa-
tients at risk of systemic reactions but also in patients, includ-
ing infants, in whom stable venous access is difficult to main-
tain [3–10]. Because the incidence of systemic adverse reac-
tions is low and venous access is not required, self-
infusion of IgG via the SC route can be performed by
patients at home providing greater ease and convenience
compared to IV administration in a hospital or infusion
center [3, 11–15].
The main disadvantages of SC therapy have been the
limited volume that can be infused in a single SC site and
the lower bioavailability of IgG after SC compared to IV
administration, necessitating the use of multiple infusion
sites on a weekly or every-other-week basis and an in-
creased dose compared to IV infusion in order to provide
the same exposure as measured by the area under the
time-concentration curve [16, 17].
Hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid), the main component of the
SC extracellular matrix (ECM), causes resistance to bulk fluid
flow through the SC tissue. Cleavage of hyaluronan by sub-
cutaneously injected hyaluronidase, a highly specific glycosi-
dase, increases the permeability of SC tissue. In the SC space,
hyaluronan is rapidly resynthesized, and the interstitial viscos-
ity is fully restored within 24 to 48 h [18]. Recombinant hu-
man hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), a highly purified soluble form
of a naturally occurring human hyaluronidase suitable for
chronic use in humans, is safe and effective in enhancing
dispersion and absorption of fluids and drugs administered
subcutaneously [19–23]. Preclinical studies showed that
rHuPH20 is short-acting, with a half-life of <30 min, and is
undetectable in plasma after administration at the doses used
to facilitate SC infusions [18, 23].
A recent pivotal study in 83 subjects with PIDD demon-
strated that pre-infusion of rHuPH20 allowed SC administra-
tion of large volumes of IgG in a single infusion site every 3–
4 weeks, comparable to an IV treatment schedule. SC infusion
of IgG facilitated by rHuPH20 (IGHy) was safe, effective, and
well tolerated despite high infusion volumes and rates [23].
Results after extended IGHy replacement therapy in the piv-
otal and an extension study are reported here.
Methods
Study Design
Long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IGHy treat-
ment in PIDD were evaluated in subjects participating in
two consecutive, phase 3, prospective, open-label, non-
controlled, multi-center studies. The studies were per-
formed in accordance with the International Conference
on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP)
and applicable legal requirements and registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00814320 and NCT01175213).
The study protocols and informed consent forms were
reviewed and approved by the appropriate ethics commit-
tees. Written informed consent was obtained from all sub-
jects and/or their legally authorized representatives prior
to performing any study-related procedures. Assent was
obtained when appropriate.
Treatment
A 10 % preparation of normal human immunoglobulin
stabilized with glycine (GAMMAGARD LIQUID in the
USA/Canada; elsewhere KIOVIG; Baxalta US Inc.,
Westlake Village, CA) was administered intravenously
(referred to as immune globulin intravenous [IGIV]) and
subcutaneously (immune globulin subcutaneous [IGSC])
in combination with rHuPH20 (IGHy). rHuPH20
(Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc., San Diego, CA) compo-
nent of IGHy is a preparation of purified recombinant
soluble human hyaluronidase produced in Chinese ham-
ster ovary cells formulated at a concentration of 160 U/
mL in a buffer solution containing 1 % human albumin.
The pivotal study comprised two epochs: In epoch 1,
subjects received IGIV at their pre-study dose and interval
for 3 months to determine pharmacokinetics of IGIV
treatment. Subjects who had participated in a previous
study which comprised a 3-month period of IGIV treat-
ment followed by 1 year of IGSC treatment could imme-
diately enter epoch 2, as pharmacokinetics of IGIV treat-
ment were already known from the previous study [3].
For epoch 2 infusions, rHuPH20 at a dose of 75 U/g
IgG was administered through a 24-gauge SC needle,
572
J Clin Immunol (2016) 36:571–582
 followed by IGSC at 108 % of the weekly IGIV dose
equivalent, via the same SC needle. Ramp-up to allow
adaptation to large SC doses began in epoch 2 with an
initial 1-week dose (25 % of the monthly dose) of IGHy
and increased until the full dose at the pre-study IGIV
interval (3 or 4 weeks) was reached [23]. After approxi-
mately 14 to 18 months of IGHy treatment in epoch 2,
subjects could enter the extension study. In that study,
IGHy dose and infusion interval were maintained for the
first three infusions. Thereafter, subjects had the option to
switch from a 3- or 4-week to a 2-week treatment interval
using one half the calculated 4-week dose for a maximum
of 4 months to allow evaluation of trough levels for the 2-
week SC interval. In a final safety follow-up, subjects
changed to IGIV or IGSC alone and anti-rHuPH20 anti-
body titers were monitored for up to 48 weeks.

 Study Population
Patients aged >2 years with PIDD involving an antibody pro-
duction defect and requiring antibody replacement as defined
by the International Union of Immunological Societies [24, 25]
were eligible for the pivotal study if they had been receiving
IgG for >3 months before enrollment at a dose of ≥300 mg/kg
of body weight/4 weeks. Completion of the pivotal study was a
prerequisite for inclusion in the extension study.
Endpoints
Efficacy was assessed during IGHy dosing in the pivotal and
extension studies. The primary objective was the rate of vali-
dated acute serious bacterial infections (VASBIs) per year.
Additional efficacy endpoints included the rate of any infec-
tion, days off school/work, days on antibiotics, number of
non-study out-patient visits, number of hospitalizations, and
days in hospital.
Safety and tolerability were monitored during the com-
bined pivotal and extension study periods lasting up to
3.5 years. Endpoints assessed included the annual rate of ad-
verse events (AEs); rates of AEs by subject and by infusion;
categorization of AEs by seriousness, severity, causality, and
temporal association with study treatment.
Study subjects were monitored for the development of
rHuPH20-reactive binding or neutralizing antibodies, and an
association between antibody formation and clinical or labo-
ratory AEs was assessed.
In the extension study, the effect of varying IGHy infusion
frequency on IgG trough levels was assessed. Specific anti-
bodies to relevant pathogens at the end of IGIV treatment in
the pivotal study and at the end of IGHy treatment in the
extension study were determined.
An exploratory endpoint of treatment preference was stud-
ied by surveying subjects at completion of IGHy treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses included the period from the first administration
through the end of IGHy treatment. Numbers and rates of
all, local, systemic, related and temporally associated AEs
and of infections were calculated per subject per year for the
entire study population and stratified for <18 and ≥18 years.
Analyses in 1-year periods over time included only subjects
who received IGHy treatment for the full 1-year period.
Trough levels of IgG at the end of IGHy infusion cycles
were analyzed in relation to dose frequency. Median trough
levels and their non-parametric 95 % confidence intervals
were calculated for 2-, 3-, and 4-week infusion intervals and
for age groups (<18 and ≥18).
Point estimates and 95 % CI were calculated for the annual
rates of days off work/school, days on antibiotics, number of
non-study out-patient visits, hospitalizations, and days in
hospital.
Results
Subjects and Exposure
A total of 89 subjects, 46 male and 43 female, at 14 sites in the
USA and Canada enrolled in the pivotal study. Age at enroll-
ment ranged from 4 to 78 years. Eighty-seven (87) subjects
received IGIV for a 3-month period either in epoch 1 (n=56)
or during a previous study (n=31). Eighty-three (83) subjects
(24<18 years and 59≥18 years) continued on to epoch 2 of
IGHy treatment. Sixty-six (66) subjects at 11 sites rolled over
into the extension study: 63 continued on IGHy and 3 on IGIV
treatment. For details of subject demographics and disposition
including age groups, refer to the online supplementary mate-
rial Table E1 and Fig. 1.
In the pivotal study, 365 IGIV infusions were administered
in epoch 1 and 1359 infusions of IGHy were administered in
epoch 2: 230 during and 1129 after ramp-up [23]. Subjects in
the extension study received 1600 IGHy infusions. Table 1
shows the exposure to IGHy, excluding ramp-up, by age
group. A mean±SD IGSC dose of 0.155±0.053 g/kg/week
(excluding ramp-up) was administered in the pivotal study
resulting in a mean volume of 292.2 mL per infusion site
[23]. The mean ± SD IGSC dose was similar in the exten-
sion study at 0.156 ± 0.051 g/kg/week (data not shown).

 Infusions were administered at a median maximum rate of
300 mL/h [23].
Including ramp-up, subjects experienced IGHy treat-
ment for a total of 187.7 subject-years (online
supplementary material Table E5). The mean ± SD dura-
tion of IGHy treatment was 367.7 ± 103.9 days in the piv-
otal study (excluding ramp-up) and 565.9 ± 211.8 days in
the extension study (data not shown). For 48 subjects,
IGHy exposure exceeded 30 months (Table 4).
Safety
A total of 2005 AEs (excluding infections) were reported dur-
ing IGHy exposure. Among 498 local AEs (2.65 per subject-
year), 488 (2.60 per subject-year) occurred during or within
72 h after infusion; 488 (2.60 per subject-year) were consid-
ered related to IGHy treatment by the investigator. Subjects
<18 years experienced fewer related local AEs (1.38 per sub-
ject-year) than subjects ≥18 years (3.03 per subject-year). A
total of 1507 systemic AEs (8.03 per subject-year), excluding
infections, were reported during IGHy exposure: 491 (2.62
per subject-year) occurred during or within 72 h after treat-
ment; 329 systemic AEs (1.75 per subject-year) were consid-
ered related to IGHy treatment by the investigator (online
supplementary material Table E2).
The rate of related systemic AEs over 1-year periods
remained consistently low while the rate of related local AEs
gradually decreased from 3.68 to 1.51 per subject year after
30 months of IGHy treatment (online supplementary material
Table E3).
During IGHy treatment, local AEs (including infections)
occurred at a rate of 0.17 per infusion. Overall, differences
in the frequency and severity of local AEs among body mass
index (BMI) groups were small. Rates of local AEs/infusion
were 0.13 in subjects with a BMI <25, 0.19 in subjects with a

 BMI of 25 to 30, and 0.23 in subjects with a BMI >30. The
majority of local AEs, irrespective of BMI, were mild (398/
500, 0.14 per infusion). In subjects with a BMI <25 (N=48),
47/205 local AEs (0.03 per infusion) were moderate and 2/205
(0.00 per infusion) were severe. In subjects with a BMI be-
tween 25 and 30 (N=17), 12/127 local AEs (0.02 per infu-
sion) were moderate and none was severe, and in subjects with
a BMI >30 (N=18), 39/168 local AEs (0.05 per infusion)
were moderate and 2/168 AEs (0.00 per infusion) were severe
(online supplementary material Table E4).
A total of 23 (0.12 per subject-year) serious systemic ad-
verse events (SAEs) occurred, none of which was related to
IGHy treatment (online supplementary material Table E5): 5
(0.10 per subject-year) in the <18 years and 18 (0.13 per
subject-year) in the ≥18-year age group.
During IGHy exposure, the AEs reported by most subjects
were headache (54.2 %), followed by infusion site pain
(53.0 %), nausea (32.5 %), vomiting and asthma (28.9 %
each), fatigue (26.5 %), infusion site erythema and pyrexia
(25.3 % each), diarrhea (24.1 %), and arthralgia and cough
(19.3 % each). All AEs occurring in ≥5 % of subjects are listed
in Table 2. No serious hypersensitivity reactions attributable to
IGHy occurred during long-term treatment.
No subject developed neutralizing antibodies to
rHuPH20. Low anti-rHuPH20 antibody titers were deter-
mined in PIDD subjects including those who, due to their
underlying immunodeficiency syndrome, were incapable
of producing any type of antibodies. As low anti-
rHuPH20 antibody titers were also identified in normal
healthy blood donors, titers <1:160 were considered to
be consistent with passive transfer from IGSC and there-
fore ignored in subsequent analyses [26]. However, 13
subjects developed anti-rHuPH20 antibody titers ≥1:160
during the pivotal study. Titers ≥1:160 persisted (i.e., two
or more consecutive values) in 6/11 subjects who rolled
over into the extension study; another two subjects devel-
oped a single increase to 1:160 during the extension
study. Anti-rHuPH20 antibody titers typically declined
during continued IGHy treatment and thereafter further
decreased during the safety follow-up on IGIV or IGSC
(data not shown). Annual rates of total, systemic, and
local AEs in subjects who developed anti-rHuPH20 anti-
bodies ≥1:160 were similar before and after the first pos-
itive titer of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies ≥1:160 (Fig. 2).
Infections
The annual rate of all infections during IGHy exposure
(N=83) was 2.99 (95 % CI 2.60–3.42) per subject. Infection
rates per subject-year were comparable between subjects
<18 years 3.02 (95 % CI 2.15–4.10) and those ≥18 years
2.98 (95 % CI 2.56–3.44) (Table 3).
A total of five infections, including one that occurred dur-
ing the IGHy ramp-up period, met the criteria for validated
acute serious bacterial infections (VASBIs) [27]. All five
VASBIs were pneumonias. The annual rate of VASBIs during
IGHy treatment was 0.03 (Table 3).
Common infections during IGHy exposure included sinus-
itis reported by 56.6 % of subjects followed by upper respira-
tory tract infection (49.4 %), viral upper respiratory tract in-
fection (21.7 %), and bronchitis (20.5 %) (Table 2).
The rate of infections determined over 1-year periods of
IGHy treatment remained stable over the studies, and rates
were comparable between subjects <18 years and subjects
≥18 years. As the duration of IGHy treatment varied, the
number of subjects exposed had substantially decreased by
the final 12-month period shown (months 25 to 36) (Table 4).
Trough Levels
Eighteen subjects infused IGHy at 2-week intervals at some
time during the IGHy treatment period (excluding ramp-up).
Median steady state trough levels did not substantially vary
with the length of the infusion interval and were similar for the
2- and 3-week regimens (1135 mg/dL [95 % CI 939–1440]
and 1195 mg/dL [95 % CI 958–1530], respectively) and
slightly lower for the 4-week regimen (983 mg/dL [95 % CI
946–1070] (Table 5). At all infusion intervals, trough levels
after SC administration of IGHy were substantially above the
500 mg/dL level considered the minimum target for IgG re-
placement [28, 29].
Specific Antibodies to Relevant Pathogens
No substantial differences were observed between the median
levels of antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae, hepatitis
B surface antigen (HBsAg), and Clostridium tetani toxoid at
the end of IGIV treatment in the pivotal study and at the end of
IGHy treatment in the extension study. For both treatment
modalities, the median levels determined were substantially
above protective ranges (online supplementary material
Table E6 and Table E7).
Days Off School/Work, in Hospital, and on Antibiotics
Rates per year of 5.75 (95 % CI 4.28–7.52) days off school/
work, 4.67 (95 % CI 3.84–5.60) non-study out-patient visits,
0.12 (95 % CI 0.08–0.18) hospitalizations, and 0.61 (95 % CI
0.36–0.94) days in hospital were determined during extended
IGHy replacement therapy in PIDD patients. The rate of days
receiving antibiotics per year, including brief infection pro-
phylaxis, e.g., for surgery or dental procedures, was 65.39
(95 % CI 48.32–86.09) (online supplementary material
Table E8).

J Clin Immunol (2016) 36:571–582
 Treatment Preference
Across the pivotal and extension studies, 48/69 (69.6 %) sub-
jects preferred IGHy treatment over alternative modes of treat-
ment. Fifteen of 69 (21.7 %) subjects preferred IV, and 4/69
(5.8 %) subjects preferred regular SC treatment. Twenty-one
of 28 (75.0 %) subjects who had received SC treatment before
switching to IGHy and 27/41 (65.9 %) subjects previously
treated IV indicated their preference for enzyme-facilitated
SC infusion (online supplementary material Table E9).
Discussion
Replacement therapy with IGSC facilitated by rHuPH20
(IGHy) combines the 3- to 4-week infusion frequency of
IGIV with the safety, tolerability, and convenience of IGSC
treatment of patients with PIDD [23].
The pivotal and subsequent extension study of IGHy re-
ported here spanned one of the longest phase 3 periods of
IGSC replacement in PIDD with the greatest IgG exposure
reported to date.
During a total of nearly 188 subject-years of IGHy expo-
sure, 4.35 AEs per subject-year (2.60 local and 1.75 systemic
AEs per subject-year) were considered related to IGHy by the
investigator.
The rate of related systemic AEs over 1-year periods
remained consistently low while the rate of related local AEs
gradually decreased from 3.68 during months 1–12 to 1.51 per
subject-year after 30 months of IGHy treatment, demonstrat-
ing that long-term exposure to IGHy did not increase the rate
of local AEs. The apparent decrease in local AEs is similar to
what has been seen in previous studies of SC IgG replacement
therapy [3, 17, 30].
Although the mean IGHy volume of 292.2 mL in a
single infusion site was approximately 10- to 15-fold
higher [23] and the median maximum infusion rate of
300 mL/h [23] was approximately 10- to 12-fold higher
than the typical SC IgG infusion volume and rate [3, 12,
17, 30], rates of local AEs per infusion during IGHy treat-
ment compare favorably with rates reported in previous
studies of SC IgG infusion [10, 17, 30]. Observations in a
recent analysis of SC IgG replacement patterns in an
obese population indicating a lower frequency of local
AEs in subjects with a BMI >30 [31] were not confirmed
in our study. The rate of local AEs/infusion was low in all
BMI groups, and although the proportion of moderate and
severe local AEs appeared to be highest in subjects with a
BMI >30 and lowest in subjects with a BMI between 25

 and 30, differences were small and BMI groups were not
coherent in the number of subjects in each group and the
length of observation period per subject. Therefore, no
firm conclusions on the relationship between rate/
severity of local AEs and BMI can be drawn from the
data.
Neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20 were not detected
at any time during or after exposure to IGHy. Fifteen of 83
subjects developed anti-rHuPH20 antibody titers ≥1:160
that were not consistent with passive transfer at least once
after the first IGHy exposure. All of these subjects had an
immunodeficiency disorder that could allow limited anti-
body formation, especially to protein antigens. The
treatment-emergent anti-rHuPH20 antibodies determined
in the patients with titers ≥1:160 exhibited an isotype dis-
tribution and binding characteristics similar to the antibod-
ies identified in healthy individuals with no exposure to
rHuPH20 [26]. Thus, qualitatively, the anti-rHuPH20 anti-
bodies seen in the clinical studies were similar to those
seen in normal individuals although the antibody titers
were higher in the study subjects. Interestingly, despite
continued exposure to rHuPH20, titers had declined sub-
stantially by the time IGHy treatment ended, and in the
majority of subjects, titers were below 1:160 by the end
of the safety follow-up period. Analyses of AEs in subjects
with anti-rHuPH20 antibodies showed that AE rates per
year were similar before and after the emergence of anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies.
The annual rate of all infections during IGHy exposure
of 2.99 is comparable to annualized infection rates of 4.5
observed during 3 months of IGIV treatment in the pivotal
study [23] and of 4.1 during a median exposure of
379 days to IGSC alone [3]. Infection rates with IGHy
were in line also with those reported with other IV
[32–34] and SC [10, 17, 30, 35] IgG preparations. In
addition, infection rates determined over 1-year periods
remained consistent throughout the study, indicating that
IGHy remained effective in the prevention of infections
during long-term exposure (>49 subjects who received up
to 30 months of IGHy treatment). The annual rate of
VASBIs during IGHy treatment was 0.03 (upper limit of
99 % CI 0.05), i.e., substantially lower than 1.0 VASBIs/
year, which is the threshold specified by regulatory guid-
ance as providing substantial evidence of efficacy [27].
Consistent with the low infection rate, high median steady-
state IgG trough levels of 1135, 1195, and 983 mg/dL were
attained after SC administration of IGHy at a 2-, 3-, and 4-
week schedule, respectively.
Rates per year for days off school/work (5.75), days receiv-
ing antibiotics (65.39), and days in hospital (0.61) were well
within the range reported for other IVand SC preparations [10,
15, 17, 30, 32–36] and confirmed that replacement therapy
with IGHy remained effective during long-term treatment of
subjects with PIDD. Irrespective of their previous route of
administration, subjects preferred IGHy treatment to IV and
SC replacement therapy.
Conclusions
Long-term replacement therapy with IGHy was safe and ef-
fective in pediatric and adult subjects with PIDD. The efficacy
of IGHy in preventing infections was maintained over time,
and IgG trough levels remained high after long-term exposure.
Rates of both systemic and local AEs were low, and the rate of
local AEs declined during the IGHy treatment course.
