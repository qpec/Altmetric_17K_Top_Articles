Abstract
Background: Little is known about how factors within the general family environment are associated with weight
and related behaviors among adolescents/young adults.
Methods: We studied 3768 females and 2614 males, 14–24 years old in 2011, participating in the Growing Up
Today Study 2. We used generalized mixed models to examine cross-sectional associations of family functioning
and quality of mother- and father-adolescent relationship with adolescent/young adult weight status, disordered
eating, intake of fast food and sugar-sweetened beverages, screen time, physical activity, and sleep duration. In all
models, we included participant’s age and family structure.
Results: Eighty percent of participants reported high family functioning and 60 % and 50 % of participants
reported high-quality mother and father relationship, respectively. Among both males and females, high
family functioning was associated with lower odds of disordered eating (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]
females = 0.53; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.45–0.63; AOR males = 0.48; CI = 0.39–0.60), insufficient physical
activity, i.e., less than 1 h/day, (AOR females = 0.74; CI = 0.61–0.89; AOR males = 0.73; CI = 0.58–0.92), and
insufficient sleep, i.e., less than 7 h/day, (AOR females = 0.56; CI = 0.45–0.68; AOR males = 0.65; CI 0.5–0.85).
High family functioning was also associated with lower odds of being overweight/obese (AOR = 0.73;
CI = 0.60–0.88) and eating fast food one or more times/week (AOR = 0.74; CI = 0.61–0.89) among females only.
Among females, high-quality mother and father relationship were both associated with lower odds of being
overweight/obese and disordered eating, eating fast food, and insufficient sleep and the magnitude of
associations were similar for mother and father relationship quality (AOR range 0.61–0.84). Among males,
high-quality mother and father relationship were both associated with lower odds of disordered eating,
insufficient physical activity and insufficient sleep, but only father relationship quality was associated with
lower odds of overweight/obesity.
Conclusions: Adolescents/young adults reporting high family functioning and more positive relationships
with their parents reported better weight-related behaviors. For weight status, females appear to be affected
equally by the quality of their relationship with both parents, whereas males may be more affected by their
relationship with fathers.

 Background
Currently, the majority of adolescents and young adults in
the United States are falling short of recommended dietary
and physical activity behavioral goals. For example, less
than 8 % of adolescents and 5 % of young adults meet the
recommended minimum of 60 min per day of physical
activity [1]; while 16 % of adolescents and 20 % of young
adults have been found to have high intakes of sugar-
sweetened beverage intake (≥500 kcal/day) [2]. Disordered
eating (e.g., fasting, purging and binge eating) [6] and
insufficient sleep (less than 7 h/night) are also common
among adolescents and young adults [3]; these behaviors
contribute alongside poor dietary quality and low physical
activity levels to excessive weight gain and a high inci-
dence of obesity during these life stages [4–7]. Obesity
during adolescence and early adulthood is associated with
increased risk of obesity in later adulthood [8], as well as
increased risk of chronic health conditions such as cardio-
vascular disease, type 2 diabetes and many forms of cancer
[9, 10]. Dietary, disordered eating, and physical activity
behaviors have been found to track between adolescence/
early adulthood and later adulthood [11, 12], suggesting
that understanding the key determinants of obesity and
related behaviors during these critical life stages is needed
to identify appropriate health promotion strategies.
The family environment serves a fundamental role in
the establishment of dietary, physical activity, and other
weight-related behaviors among youth. While a number
of studies have explored how diet- or activity-related
parental behaviors, including feeding practices [13–15],
modeling [16, 17] and providing support for health
behaviors [18, 19], as well as general parenting style
[20–22] may influence adolescent weight and related
behaviors, few studies have explored how other factors
in the general family environment, such as family func-
tioning or quality of parent-adolescent relationship, may
influence these outcomes. Family systems theory asserts
that an individual’s behaviors must be understood within
the family context [23]. These general family factors
reflect the overarching family context within which
adolescents develop; thus, these factors may be powerful
determinants of weight and related behaviors. Given that
adolescence and young adulthood are characterized by
increasing independence from family where peer and
other non-family factors may have increased influence
on behavior, it is particularly important to understand to
what degree these general family factors may still pro-
vide a foundation for behavior as youth move through
adolescence. Understanding how these general family
factors are associated with weight and related behav-
iors can help inform family-based obesity prevention
interventions.
Family functioning is a complex phenomenon describ-
ing structural and organizational properties of a family
group and the patterns of interactions between the
group’s members [24]. Specifically, it describes how
families manage their daily routines, fulfill their roles
within the family, and communicate and connect emo-
tionally [25]. Although research has shown that adoles-
cents with eating disorders report higher levels of family
dysfunction [26, 27], only a small number of studies have
examined whether family functioning is associated with
adolescent obesity [28–31]. Results of this existing
research are inconsistent; two studies found no signifi-
cant association between family functioning [30, 31] and
adolescent weight status and two found that higher
family dysfunction was associated with higher weight
status among youth [18, 19]. The majority of research
exploring the association between family functioning
and obesity risk has included small, convenience samples
[28, 30, 31]. A few studies have also explored how single
aspects of family functioning, i.e., emotional connection
and family conflict, are associated with obesity risk [32],
eating behavior [33] and physical activity among youth
[34]. Only one study has explored associations between
overall family functioning and obesity-related behaviors
among adolescents in the United States [29]. Berge and
colleagues found that higher family functioning was as-
sociated with more healthful dietary intake, less seden-
tary behavior and greater physical activity in their
sample of 2793 Minnesota youth [29]. Our research
builds on this existing research by examining the associ-
ations between family functioning and obesity and re-
lated
behaviors
in
a
large,
nationwide
sample
of
adolescents/young adults in the United States.
In addition to the overall functioning of the family
unit, the quality of the unique relationship between a
parent and his/her adolescent/young adult child may
influence adolescent weight status and related behaviors.
The quality of the parent-adolescent relationship has
been explored as the level of attachment, bonding and
emotional connection, and communication and in the
relationship [32]. Limited research has explored how
parent-adolescent relationship quality is associated with
adolescent obesity [35, 36], dietary intake [37] and
physical activity [34], however, the majority have found
positive associations between quality of the parent-
adolescent relationship and more healthful outcomes.
Existing
research
exploring
these
associations
has
combined information across parents without distin-
guishing fathers from mothers or has examined only
mother-adolescent relationship quality. Thus, little is
known about how father-adolescent relationship quality
is associated with adolescent weight status and weight-
related behaviors.
The objective of this study was to examine the extent
to which family functioning and mother- and father-
adolescent relationship quality are associated with weight

 status and weight-related behaviours, i.e., disordered
eating, intake of fast food and sugar sweetened beverages,
screen time, physical activity, and sleep duration, among a
large, nationwide sample of adolescents/young adults in
the United States. We hypothesized that high family
functioning and high quality mother-adolescent and
father-adolescent relationship would be associated with
less obesity/overweight weight status and more healthful
weight-related behaviors.
Methods
Study population
Growing Up Today Study 2 (GUTS 2) is a longitudinal
cohort study that was established in 2004 to assess
associations of diet and activity to height velocity and
weight gain among a nationwide sample of adolescents
in the United States. Participants are offspring of women
taking part in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II). To
recruit the participants in the GUTS 2 cohort, we mailed
letters to 20,700 women in NHS II who had children
aged 9–17 years, which described the purpose of the
study and requested permission for their child to partici-
pate. In 2004, we mailed questionnaires to 8826 females
and 8454 males whose mothers granted consent. A total
of 6002 girls and 4918 boys returned completed ques-
tionnaires, thereby assenting to participate. Follow-up
questionnaires (on-line and mailed paper copies) were
sent in 2006, 2008, and 2011.
For this study, we restricted analyses to participants
who responded to the 2011 questionnaire, when family
functioning and quality of parental-adolescent relation-
ship were assessed (n = 6659). Participants missing data
on family functioning and quality of parental-adolescent
relationship were excluded from the analyses (n = 277),
resulting in an analytic sample of 6382 (3768 females
and 2614 males). In the analytic sample, 21 % had at
least one sibling in the cohort (5013 unique families).
The study was approved by the Partners Human Research
Committee.
Measures
Exposure variables
Family functioning. Participants reported their level of
family functioning using 9 items from the 12-item
General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment
Device [24]. To meet space limitations on the survey, we
did not include similarly worded items for 3 of the items
(e.g., we included “individuals are accepted for who they
are” but did not include “we feel accepted for who we
are”). The items included on the General Functioning
Scale measure the overall health/pathology of the family
relating to six dimensions of family functioning: a)
problem solving, b) communication, c) roles, d) affective
responsiveness, e) affective involvement, and f) behav-
ioral control. The scale consists of statements about
families to which adolescents indicated the degree to
which they agree on a 4-point scale (strongly disagree to
strongly agree) [13, 33]. We divided the sum by 9 to give
a mean score from 1.0 to 4.0 with lower scores implying
better family functioning. We used the cut-point ≤ 2.17
as high functioning based on previous evidence that this
cut-point effectively discriminates between healthy and
unhealthy functioning in families with young children
and older adolescents [38–40].
Quality of mother-adolescent and father-adolescent
relationship. Participants reported separately their de-
gree of satisfaction with respect to conflict resolution,
emotional support, time spent together, and communica-
tion with their mothers and fathers using a 9-item parent-
adolescent relationship satisfaction scale [41]; sample
question: “I am satisfied with the amount of time my
parent and I spend together”. The scale was developed for
research in adolescents and has been shown to be asso-
ciated with other health behaviors among youth [41].
Participants were able to opt out of the scale regarding
either parent if the scale was not applicable; 3044 (81 %)
females and 1996 (76 %) males, provided information on
both mother and father-adolescent relationship quality.
Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly
disagree to strongly agree) and we divided the sum by 9
to give a mean score ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 with a
higher score representing higher quality of the parent-
adolescent relationship. No established cut-points exist
for this scale. We dichotomized mean scores into high
and low quality relationship using the cut-point ≥ 4 for
high quality relationship based on a priori classification
that agreement with most items would suggest a high
relationship quality.
Outcome variables
Disordered eating behaviors.
Participants who re-
ported that they were currently trying to lose weight
were asked if they engaged in any of the following
behaviors: vomiting, using laxatives, fasting, or binge
eating behaviors using items found to be valid compared
with interviews [42, 43]. Participants who answered
affirmatively to any of these questions were classified as
engaging in disordered eating behaviors.
Screen time. Participants self-reported their television
viewing and other screen time with a question reading:
“On average, how many hours per week do you spend in
each of the following activities?” which then lists four
categories of screen time: television, videos, computer
games, and Internet [44]. We summed the average hours
Haines et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2016) 13:68 
Page 3 of 12
 across these four categories, divided by seven to get the
average daily hours and dichotomized hours of screen
time as ≥ 2 h or < 2 h/day based on recommendations
from the American Academy of Pediatrics [45].
Physical activity. Participants self-reported their level of
physical activity with the Youth/Adolescent Activity
Questionnaire, which is based on the validated self-
administered physical activity assessment tool developed
for NHS II [46]. We dichotomized physical activity as ≥
1 h or < 1 h of activity/day based on recommendations
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[47].
Sleep duration. Participants self-reported their sleep
duration with an item reading: “In a typical 24 h, how
many hours of sleep do you get?” Eight response options
ranged from “less than 5 h” to “11 or more hours.” We
categorized sleep duration as < 7 h/day, 7–9 h/day
(referent), or > 9 h/day based on recommendations from
the National Sleep Foundation [48]. However, due to the
small number of participants in the > 9 h category, we
collapsed the 7–9 h/day and > 9 h/day into a single
category.
Fast food intake. Participants self-reported their fre-
quency of eating foods from a fast food restaurant (i.e.
McDonalds,
KFC
and
Wendy’s).
We
dichotomized
frequency of fast food intake as ≥ 1 servings/week or < 1
serving/week [49, 50].
Sugar sweetened beverage intake. Participants self-
reported their intake of sugar sweetened beverages,
including soda and fruit drinks, using items from the
Youth/Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire [51].
We dichotomized servings of sugar sweetened beverages
as ≥ 1 servings/day or < 1 servings/day [52].
Weight status. Participants self-reported their height
and weight, which we used to calculate body mass index
(BMI). We dichotomized weight status as overweight/
obese or normal weight based on the International
Obesity Task Force cut-points [50]. According to these
cut-offs, males and females were considered overweight/
obese at the 90.5 and 89.3 percentiles, respectively [53].
Covariates
Age. We calculated participants’ ages from their birth-
date and the date that the 2011 questionnaire was
returned.
Family
structure.
We
determined
family
structure
based
on
mothers’
most
recent
report
of
living
arrangement, which was the 2005 NHS II questionnaire.
Response options included: alone, with spouse or partner,
with other adult family member, and other. Mothers were
asked to identify all relevant responses. We coded family
structure as: Mother lives with spouse/partner and Other,
which included alone, with other adult family member,
and other.
Statistical analyses
We examined the correlations between family function-
ing, mother-adolescent relationship quality and father-
adolescent relationship quality using the phi coefficient.
The phi coefficient is similar in its interpretation to the
Pearson correlation coefficient, but it is a measure of
correlation between two binary variables [54]. To adjust
for covariates and to account for correlation between
siblings (5013 unique families), we used generalized
mixed models (Proc GLIMMIX) to model associations
between family functioning and quality of mother- and
father-adolescent relationship and adolescent weight
status and weight-related behaviors. We fit separate
models for each of the outcome variables. All models
adjusted for adolescent’s age and family structure. We
also fit models that additionally adjusted for mothers'
BMI at age 18 years, adolescent living situation (with
parents or other), and adolescent race/ethnicity; the
effect estimate remained virtually unchanged (results not
shown), so we report only estimates from the more
parsimonious model. To provide a point of reference for
the odds ratio estimates, the predictive prevalence for
each outcome variable was calculated for those with high
and low family functioning and for those with high and
low parent-adolescent relationship quality. We also fit
models that included interaction terms (e.g., family
functioning * family structure) to examine whether the
associations between these general family factors (i.e.,
family functioning, mother-adolescent relationship qual-
ity, or father-adolescent relationship quality) and ado-
lescent weight-related outcomes and behaviors differed
by family structure. We found limited evidence of inter-
action by family structure (results not shown), so report
only results from the main effect model. Due to known
differences in weight status and weight-related behaviors
by sex, all analyses were stratified by sex. We conducted
all analyses with SAS software (version 9.3 SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Results
Participant characteristics
Participants were between the ages of 14–24 years; the
mean age was 20 years (Table 1). The majority (92.4 %)
of the participants identified as ‘white’. Nearly 80 % of
both male and female participants reported a high level
of family functioning. A high-quality relationship with
Haines et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2016) 13:68

 mother was reported by 64 % of females and 60 % of
males. High-quality father relationship was reported by
50 % of females and 52 % of males (Table 1).
Correlation between family functioning, mother-, and
father-adolescent relationship quality
The correlation between family functioning and mother-
adolescent relationship quality was r = 0.41 among both
females and males. The correlation between family
functioning and quality of father-adolescent relationship
was r = 0.35 among females and r = 0.36 among males.
The correlation between mother and father-relationship
quality was r = 0.51 among females and r = 0.61 among
males.
Family functioning and adolescent weight status and
weight-related behaviors
Females
Among females, higher family functioning was associ-
ated with lower odds of being overweight or obese
(AOR = 0.73; 95 % CI 0.60, 0.88; Table 2). The predicted
prevalence of overweight or obesity was 20 % among
females with high family functioning, and 26 % for those
with low family functioning (Fig. 1a). Higher family
functioning was also associated with lower odds of en-
gaging in disordered eating behaviors (AOR = 0.53; 95 %
CI 0.45, 0.63), of eating fast food at least once/week
(AOR = 0.74; 95 % CI 0.61, 0.89), of getting less than 1 h
of physical activity/day (AOR = 0.74; 95 % CI 0.61, 0.89),
and of sleeping less than 7 h/day (AOR = 0.57; 95 % CI
0.46, 0.70). We did not find associations between level of
family functioning and either intake of sugar sweetened
beverages or screen time among females (Table 2).
Males
Among males, high family functioning was associated
with lower odds of engaging in disordered eating beha-
viors (AOR = 0.48; 95 % CI 0.39, 0.60; Table 2) of getting
less than 1 h of physical activity/day (AOR = 0.73; 95 %
CI 0.58, 0.92) and of sleeping less than 7 h/day (AOR =
0.65; 95 % CI 0.50, 0.85). Level of family functioning was
not associated with weight status, intake of fast food,

Mother and father relationship quality and adolescent
weight status and weight-related behaviors
Females
Among females, high-quality mother relationship was
associated with lower odds of being overweight or obese
(AOR = 0.75; 95 % CI 0.63, 0.91). The predicted preva-
lence of overweight or obesity was 19 % among females
with high-quality mother-adolescent relationship and
24 % for those with low-quality mother relationship
(Fig. 1b). High-quality mother relationship was also as-
sociated with lower odds of engaging in disordered eat-
ing behaviors (AOR = 0.64; 95 % CI 0.54, 2.22), of eating
fast food at least once/week (AOR = 0.81; 95 % CI 0.68,
0.97), of getting less than 1 h of physical activity/day
(AOR = 0.84; 95 % CI 0.72, 0.98) and of sleeping less
than 7 h/day (AOR = 0.64; 95 % CI 0.53, 0.77). We did
not find an association between mother relationship
quality and intake of sugar sweetened beverages or
screen time among females. Results for father relation-
ship quality were similar in direction and magnitude as
those seen for mother relationship quality (Table 2).
Males
Among males high-quality mother relationship was asso-
ciated with lower odds of engaging in disordered eating
behaviors (AOR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.51, 0.77; Table 2), of
getting less than 1 h of physical activity/day (AOR =
0.78; 95 % CI 0.64, 0.94), and of sleeping less than 7 h/
day (AOR = 0.63; 95 % CI 0.51, 0.79). Mother relation-
ship quality was not associated with weight status, intake
of fast food, intake of sugar sweetened beverages, or
screen time among males (Table 2).
High-quality father relationship was associated with
lower odds of being overweight or obese (AOR = 0.80;
95 % CI 0.66, 0.98). The predicted prevalence of over-
weight or obesity was 26 % among males with high-
quality father-adolescent relationship and 33 % for those
with low-quality father relationship (Fig. 2c). High-quality
father relationship was also associated with lower odds of
engaging in disordered eating behaviors (AOR = 0.72;
95 % CI 0.58, 0.89), of eating fast food at least once/week
(0.83; 95 % CI 0.69, 1.00), of getting less than 1 h of
physical activity/day (AOR = 0.69; 95 % CI 0.57, 0.83), and
of sleeping less than 7 h/day (AOR = 0.61; 95 % CI 0.49,
0.77). We did not find an association between father
relationship quality and intake of sugar-sweetened bever-
ages or screen time among males (Table 2).
Discussion
In this large, nationwide cohort of adolescents/young
adults, we observed that adolescents/young adults from
families with high family functioning and high-quality of
mother- and father-adolescent relationships were less
likely to have overweight or obesity and less likely to
engage in unhealthful weight-related behaviors, although
the pattern of these associations differed by sex. Asso-
ciations between family functioning and weight-related
behaviors were similar for males and females; however,
family functioning was associated with weight status among
females only. Both males and females who reported positive
relationships with their parents reported better weight-
related behaviors. Females were affected equally by the
quality of their relationship with their mothers and fathers,
whereas for males, weight status may be more affected by
their relationship with fathers.
Our results are consistent with previous studies with
smaller samples, which found that adolescents from
families with high family functioning are less likely to
engage in disordered eating behaviors [15, 16]. Epide-
miologic studies exploring associations between family
functioning and adolescent weight are few in number
[28–31] and our results extend this research by exami-
ning this association in a large, nationwide sample. Simi-
lar to our results, in their sample of ethnically-diverse
Minnesota youth, Berge and colleagues [29] found that
while higher family functioning was associated with
healthier eating and activity behaviors among both males
and females, higher family functioning was associated
with lower prevalence of overweight/obesity among
females only. While family dysfunction may interfere
with healthful behavior for both males and females due
to the families’ limited ability to organize and plan
routines related to these behaviors, the stronger asso-
ciation between family function and weight among
females may be due to stronger reactivity and response
to stress among females. Results from laboratory research
suggest that, when exposed to similar stressors, adolescent
females have stronger physiologic reactivity to stress than
adolescent males [55]; this physiologic reactivity can lead
to metabolic disturbances that can impair sensitization of
satiety signals [56, 57]. Epidemiologic [58] and laboratory
research [59] has also found that females engage in more
disinhibited eating in response to stress than males, which
could lead to greater weight gain among females. Eluci-
dating the mechanisms regarding how factors in the
general family environment influence weight outcomes
among adolescents/young adults is an important area for
future research.
Although our measure of mother- and father-adolescent
relationship quality assessed adolescent satisfaction with a
range of aspects of the parent-adolescent relationship,
including closeness, conflict resolution, emotional sup-
port, time spent together, and communication, our results
are similar to the majority of studies that have examined
specific
aspects
of
the
parent
relationship.

 example, using data from 977 participants in the
Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development,
Anderson and colleagues [36] found that lower mater-
nal attachment and sensitivity, assessed objectively during
the preschool years, were associated with higher preva-
lence of obesity during adolescence. Insecure parent at-
tachment in childhood was also found to be associated
with greater intake of high calorie food among children
and adults [37]. Level of bonding or closeness with a par-
ent has also been shown to moderate the association be-
tween maternal-BMI and daughter-BMI [17–60] and
parental and adolescent weight-related behaviors [17–61].
In contrast, using data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, Crossman and colleagues
[35] found that a higher degree of closeness with a parent
was associated with greater risk for excess weight gain
among males, but not females. Our study builds on these
findings by using a broad definition of parent-adolescent
relationship that includes numerous aspects of the rela-
tionship and by providing insight into how the father-
adolescent relationship may be associated with adolescent
weight and related behaviors, which was not explored in
these existing studies.
In our study, we found that among females, high qua-
lity father-adolescent relationship was associated with
healthful adolescent weight and weight-related behaviors
in a similar manner to the more frequently researched
mother relationship. Among males, however, the quality
of the father-adolescent relationship had a stronger rela-
tionship with weight status than did mother-adolescent
relationship quality. Although research has demonstrated
that fathers’ weight-related behaviors are associated with
adolescent diet [17–62] and activity behaviors [63], it is
possible that the same-sex parent relationship has a stron-
ger influence on sons than daughters. Additional etiologic
and intervention research involving fathers is needed to
identify mechanisms by which father-relationship quality
influences weight status in youth and to explore possible
differences in these mechanisms by child sex.
A number of studies have also examined how paren-
ting style is associated with adolescent weight and
related behaviors [20–22, 25]. Parenting style is typically
defined by level of parental warmth and control with four
key parenting styles examined: authoritative, authoritarian,
permissive and neglectful [25]. The majority of studies
show that authoritative parenting, characterized by high
warmth and high control, is associated with lower obesity
risk and healthier weight-related behaviors among adoles-
cents [64]. While adolescents with authoritative parents
have been found to report higher overall life satisfaction
[65], it is also possible that an authoritative parenting style
may be associated with increased satisfaction with their
relationship with their parents, which may be associated
with healthier weight-related behaviors and outcomes.
Taken together, this research suggests that the parent-
adolescent relationship may be an important determinant
of adolescent weight and related behaviors. Future re-
search is needed to determine which aspects of the parent-
adolescent relationship are the key determinants of adoles-
cent behavior as well as the specific pathways by which
these relationships influence adolescent behavior.
With
the
exception
of
obesity/overweight
among
males, which was only significantly associated with
father-adolescent relationship quality, we found that
family functioning and parent-adolescent relationship
quality had similar associations across the weight-related
behaviors and outcomes among both males and females.
While the correlations of these exposure variables sug-
gest they are somewhat distinct general family con-
structs, our results suggest that family functioning and
parent-adolescent relationship quality may have similar
influences on weight and related outcomes. However, for
all outcomes (again, except for obesity among males),
the association was stronger for family functioning,
which may suggest it may be a stronger determinant of
weight and related behaviors. Additional research is
needed to confirm our findings and to explore how asso-
ciations between general family factors and weight and
related outcomes differ by sex.
This study had several limitations that should be
considered when interpreting our results. As in all ob-
servational studies, residual and unmeasured confound-
ing could be present. However, adjustment for potential
socio-demographic confounders we did assess, including
family structure and race/ethnicity did not have a sub-
stantive influence on our estimates of association. The
data used to identify adolescents’ family structure was
collected in 2005 and thus may not have been an accur-
ate representation of adolescents’ family structure when
the predictor and outcome measures for this analysis
were assessed. Our analyses are cross-sectional; thus, we
are unable to rule out reverse causation in the observed
associations. However, this limitation applies mainly to
the outcome of disordered eating as reverse causation is
unlikely with the other outcomes explored. All measures
were collected by self-report and individuals with higher
BMIs are more likely to under-report their weight and
dietary intake and over-report their physical activity.
This reporting bias would most likely bias estimates
towards the null. We calculated 42 tests and did not
adjust for multiple comparisons. Of these tests, 25 were
statistically significant at the 0.05 level, much larger than
the 2 we would expect by chance. Although study
participants reside throughout the US, our cohort is not
a representative sample of US adolescents. Participants
are children of registered nurses and the cohort is > 90 %
white, which may reduce the generalizability of our
findings.

 Conclusion
To date, few obesity prevention interventions have
successfully changed dietary intake or physical activity
among adolescents and fewer yet have limited weight
gain [66]. Our results suggest that factors within the
general family environment, including family function-
ing and quality of parent-adolescent relationship, may
be important factors to address within interventions
design to support healthful behaviors and weight status
among adolescents. Future research should employ a
longitudinal design to help elucidate the temporal and
potentially bi-directional nature of the associations we
found. Experimental research, such as family-based psy-
chotherapy interventions, could also examine the extent
to which improving family functioning or parent-child
relations results in improved weight outcomes among
adolescents.
