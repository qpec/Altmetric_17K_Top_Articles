Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a prevalent public 
health concern that affects people of all genders and sex-
ual orientations. Though the focus of violence research 
has typically been on females experiencing violence from 
male perpetrators in heterosexual couples (Finneran & 
Stephenson, 2013; Kubicek, McNeeley, & Collins, 2015), 
recent studies have reported prevalence rates of IPV 
among men who have sex with men (MSM) comparable 
to those of heterosexual women (Carvalho, Lewis, 
Derlega, Winstead, & Viggiano, 2011; Davis et al., 2015; 
Feldman, Ream, Díaz, & El-Bassel, 2008; Houston & 
McKirnan, 2007; Stephenson, Rentsch, Salazar, & 
Sullivan, 2011). IPV refers to emotional, physical, or 
sexual violence between romantic or sexual partners 
(Davis et al., 2015; Kubicek et al., 2015) and may extend 
beyond physical and sexual violence to include monitor-
ing and controlling behaviors (Stephenson & Finneran, 
2013). Estimates for IPV prevalence in same-sex male 
relationships cover a wide range between 12% and 78% 
(Finneran & Stephenson, 2013; Greenwood et al., 2002; 
Houston & McKirnan, 2007; Kubicek et al., 2015; 
Stephenson, Rentsch et al., 2011; Stephenson, Sato, & 
Finneran, 2013). A study by Stephenson and associates 
(Stephenson, Rentsch et al., 2011) identified varying 
rates for specific types of IPV, with 33% of men experi-
encing emotional IPV, 23% physical IPV, and 10% sexual 
IPV. Collectively, these findings highlight alarmingly 
high rates of IPV among male couples and a pressing 
need for greater research and intervention efforts.
There is a wealth of evidence linking dyadic charac-
teristics and relationship factors to the experience of IPV 
in heterosexual relationships. Partner’s age negatively 
correlates with prevalence of IPV, while other partner 
characteristics such as dyadic differences in education 
level may contribute to increased violence in heterosex-
ual couples (Kim, Laurent, Capaldi, & Feingold, 2008;

Abstract
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a prevalent and pressing public health concern that affects people of all gender and 
sexual identities. Though studies have identified that male couples may experience IPV at rates as high as or higher 
than women in heterosexual partnerships, the body of literature addressing this population is still nascent. This 
study recruited 160 male–male couples in Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago to independently complete individual surveys 
measuring demographic information, partner violence experience and perpetration, and individual and relationship 
characteristics that may shape the experience of violence. Forty-six percent of respondents reported experiencing 
IPV in the past year. Internalized homophobia significantly increased the risk for reporting experiencing, perpetrating, 
or both for any type of IPV. This study is the first to independently gather data on IPV from both members of male 
dyads and indicates an association between internalized homophobia and risk for IPV among male couples. The results 
highlight the unique experiences of IPV in male–male couples and call for further research and programmatic attention 
to address the exorbitant levels of IPV experienced within some of these partnerships.

Rodriguez, Lasch, Chandra, & Lee, 2001; Stephenson 
et al., 2013). Younger heterosexual couples tend to 
exhibit higher rates of violence than do older partner-
ships, an outcome that may have roots in childhood 
experiences of violence, bullying, and harassment 
(Capaldi & Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2012). Only very 
recently has IPV research begun to examine dyadic and 
relationship factors as correlates of IPV in same-sex 
male couples. In recent research among this group, age 
has been reported to be a significant factor in IPV—with 
violence decreasing with age and having an older partner 
reducing the risk of experiencing violence (Stephenson 
et al., 2013). It has been suggested that for male–male 
couples, age differences may influence IPV through an 
older partner’s assertions of dominance and control over 
the younger partner (Goldenberg, Stephenson, Freeland, 
Finneran, & Hadley, 2016). Financial stress, depression, 
and alcohol and drug use in relationships are also corre-
lates of IPV for both heterosexual couples and same-sex 
male and female couples (Carvalho et al., 2011; 
Goldenberg et al., 2016; Leone, Crane, Parrott, & 
Eckhardt, 2016; Stall et al., 2003; Stephenson, Rentsch 
et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013). Substance use has 
long been identified to be a significant factor in violence 
among heterosexual couples (Leone et al., 2016) and 
more recently in male couples (Goldenberg et al., 2016; 
Stall et al., 2003; Stults, Javdani, Greenbaum, Kapadia, 
& Halkitis, 2015). As has been recognized in heterosex-
ual couples, differences in financial wealth and security 
may result in financial dependence or relational power 
dynamics that increases the risk of violence among male 
couples (Goldenberg et al., 2016). Emerging evidence 
suggests that IPV precipitants specific to male–male 
couples may include inter-partner differences in degree 
of “outness” (i.e., public recognition or disclosure of 
their sexuality), a difference that may precipitate bidirec-
tional violence as well as creating a power imbalance 
where the “out” partner may threaten to disclose his part-
ner’s sexual orientation and lead to further violence 
(Goldenberg et al., 2016).
IPV is a complex health risk that is affected by myriad 
individual and demographic characteristics in tandem 
with partner attributes and relationship quality factors. 
Studies of IPV among same-sex male couples have gen-
erally ignored dyadic factors and examined IPV as a fac-
tor associated with sexual risk-taking behaviors and drug 
use (Chakravarty, Hoff, Neilands, & Darbes, 2012; Davis 
et al., 2015; Feldman et al., 2008; Stall et al., 2003; 
Stephenson, de Voux, & Sullivan, 2011; Stults et al., 
2015; White & Stephenson, 2016) rather than taking a 
broader scope to examine factors that affect the risk for 
IPV. The few studies that have incorporated dyadic data 
are based on reports from only one partner (Stephenson, 
Rentsch et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013). The current 
study aims to fill gaps in the literature (a lack of compre-
hensive dyadic studies that include reporting from both 
members) on partner violence among same-sex male 
couples by examining a wide range of individual and 
dyadic factors being reported by both members of the 
couple. Through this analysis, the researchers aim to 
identify the individual and dyadic factors that influence 
IPV among male couples.
Methods
The data reported in this article come from the baseline 
survey of the project Stronger Together, an ongoing ran-
domized control trial of sero-discordant, same-sex male 
couples in Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago (ClinicalTrials.
org reference # NCT01772992). Self-identified gay or 
bisexual male (GBM) couples were recruited through 
online and in-person outreach efforts. Study recruitment 
was facilitated through the Facebook, Twitter, Scruff, 
Grindr, and social marketing campaigns of the sites con-
ducting the intervention. Flyers and posters were dis-
played in the sites and local gay-targeted venues, and 
information on the study was displayed at the HIV testing 
check-in at each site.
Inclusion criteria were: at least 18 years old; had been in 
a partnership for at least 1 month; had been residents of

metro Atlanta, Boston, or Chicago for at least 3 months; 
and not in a known sero-concordant positive relationship. 
Those who presented for participation in the trial com-
pleted informed consent documentation before taking the 
baseline survey. Of the 411 individuals who presented for 
participation and completed the check-in survey, 398 con-
sented and were eligible to take the baseline survey 
(96.8%). Of the 398 participants who completed the base-
line survey, 78 participants were purposefully excluded 
from analysis due to missing responses on HIV status, IPV, 
and demographic characteristics. A total of 320 partici-
pants were included in the analysis. Couples presented 
together, but each member of the couple took the baseline 
survey independently in separate rooms. Data were ana-
lyzed as individuals and compared to the partner’s 
responses. For example, partner A answered his experience 
of IPV and perpetration, and these answers were compared 
to partner B’s answers to the same questions. A description 
of the protocol for the full study can be found in Stephenson 
et al. (2017). Approval for this study was obtained from the 
(University) Institutional Review Boards.
Individual characteristics measured included age, race/
ethnicity, sexual orientation, HIV status, employment sta-
tus, education level, arrest history, internalized homopho-
bia, drug and alcohol use, and depression. Controlling for 
these characteristics, this study analyzed factors associ-
ated with IPV. IPV was measured using the IPV among 
Gay and Bisexual Men (IPV-GBM) scale, a validated 
scale with high reliability (Cronbach’s α > 0.78) adapted 
from the Conflict Tactics Scale to more accurately mea-
sure IPV among gay and bisexual men (Stephenson & 
Finneran, 2013). The scale encompasses five types of IPV: 
physical and sexual (including hitting partner and rape), 
emotional (such as criticizing clothes), controlling (pre-
venting seeing family or friends), monitoring (reading 
emails and text messages), and HIV-related IPV (lying 
about HIV status and intentional transmission of HIV). 
The scale measured experience of IPV by asking partici-
pants to rate how often their partner perpetrated IPV 
against them, and how often they perpetrated IPV against 
their partner. Responses to these questions were used to 
determine prevalence of past-year experience of IPV, per-
petration, and both experiencing and perpetrating.
The analysis explored individual and dyadic factors 
that have been identified in partner violence in hetero-
sexual partnerships as well as factors unique to MSM that 
may be potential correlates of IPV. The survey employed 
the 20-item subset of the Gay Identity Scale developed by 
Brady and Busse (1994) to measure the prevalence of 
internalized homophobia among respondents. This scale 
has proven reliability with Cronbach’s α of 0.84 (Meyer, 
Frost, Navarez, & Dietrich, 2006). Responses were trans-
lated into continuous total scores on the scale and a binary 
variable for whether respondents scored in the top 20th 
percentile to focus on respondents who report the highest 
degrees of internalized homophobia. Depression was 
measured using the short form Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies – Depression (CES-D) 11 Iowa depression scale, 
a validated scale derived from the original 20-item 
CES-D scale (Cronbach’s α = 0.81; Carpenter et al., 1998; 
Kohout, Berkman, Evans, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1993). 
Responses were analyzed as continuous variables of the 
total score and as a binary whether or not participants pre-
sented symptoms of clinical depression (defined as scor-
ing 8 or higher on the scale; Carpenter, Fowler, Maxwell, 
& Andersen, 2010). Poly-drug use and binge drinking 
behavior (i.e., having more than six drinks on one occa-
sion) were measured using behavioral self-reports in 
response to questions asking about past-year binge-drink-
ing frequency (Peacock, Andrinopoulos, & Hembling, 
2015; Rowe, Liou, Vittinghoff, Coffin, & Santos, 2016; 
Santos, Jin, & Raymond, 2015) and use of various club 
drugs, injection drugs, inhalants, and hallucinogens. For 
analysis, binge drinking was restricted to at least once a 
month, and poly-drug use was coded as a binary of using 
at least three of the drugs listed (Daskalopoulou et al., 
2014; Yu, Wall, Chiasson, & Hirshfield, 2015). The 
Communications Patterns Questionnaire short form 
assessed the degree to which participants use constructive 
communication behaviors when a problem with their 
partner arises (Heavey, Larson, Zumtobel, & Christensen, 
1996). Responses were analyzed categorically in refer-
ence to the partner; looking at who scored higher on the 
scale (i.e., who more frequently used constructive com-
munication behaviors). This scale has demonstrated reli-
ability with Cronbach’s α > 0.81 (Heavey et al., 1996). 
Perceptions of love within the relationship were mea-
sured through a 19-item validated scale examining inti-
macy, passion, and commitment (Lemieux & Hale, 1999). 
Dyadic trust was assessed using an 8-item validated scale 
developed by Larzelere and Huston (1980). Results for 
both love and trust scales were analyzed for differences 
between partner’s responses (i.e., respondent scores 
higher than partner). Both the love and trust scales have 
demonstrated reliability with Cronbach’s α > 0.78 for 
both scales. In order to assess dyadic quality, the survey 
included the 32-item validated Dyadic Adjustment Scale 
examining dyadic satisfaction, dyadic cohesion, dyadic 
consensus, and affectional expression wherein higher 
scores indicate higher degrees of these characteristics 
(Spanier, 1976). This scale has demonstrated reliability 
with Cronbach’s α = 0.96 (Spanier, 1976). Scores were 
interpreted as differences between partners’ responses.
Additional variables of interest included age (continu-
ous and comparatively between partners), race (White, 
Black, multiracial/other, and being in an interracial rela-
tionship), sexual orientation (partners have concordant or 
discordant orientations), highest education level (high 
school, some college, college or higher), employment 
status, arrest history, HIV status, and cohabitation.

Prevalence ratios with 95% confidence interval for 
past-year experience of IPV, perpetration of IPV, and both 
experience and perpetration were calculated with a 
Poisson model using Generalized Estimated Equations 
(GEE), with a robust standard error via the GENMOD 
procedure in SAS 9.4 (Barros & Hirakata, 2003; Zou, 
2004). Unadjusted prevalence ratios of any type of IPV 
were investigated in Table 4. This model underwent step-
wise regression to adjust for confounding variables, and a 
final, reduced model with adjusted prevalence ratios 
(PRs) was generated (Table 5).
Results
Respondents’ individual and relationship characteristics 
are summarized in Table 1, and dyadic differences are 
reported in Table 3. The mean age of this sample was 35.9 
years (19–69 years). The sample majority (77.5%) was 
White (248/320), with 12.2% Black (39/320), and 10.3% 
multiracial (33/320) or other. Less than a third of the sam-
ple (28.13%) was in an interracial relationship (90/320), 
and 39.4% was in an age-discordant relationship (126/320). 
This sample was mostly highly educated with 68.4% 
reporting having a college degree or higher (219/320), 
24.1% with some college education (77/320), and 7.5% 
with a high school education or less (24/320). Of the 320 
participants, 9.6% reported being unemployed or retired 
(36/320) and 27.2% reported having been arrested 
(87/320). Most of the participants self-identified as homo-
sexual or gay (287/320, 89.7%) and 15.6% reported being 
HIV positive (50/320). Relationship quality measures are 
noted in Table 2. In the past year, 45.6% of participants 
reported experiencing IPV of any kind (146/320), with 
9.7% reporting physical IPV (31/320); 6.8%, controlling 
IPV (22/320); 20.3%, monitoring IPV (65/320); and 
33.6%, emotional IPV (108/320). All violence reported 
here is with the respondent’s current intimate partner.
The unadjusted Poisson GEE model (Table 4) displays 
variables significantly correlated with the three IPV out-
comes (experience, perpetration, and both). Age and age 
difference, sero-discordant partnerships, discordance in 
sexual orientation, lower degrees of internalized 
homophobia, couples not cohabitating, and equal scores 
on the love scale were all negatively associated with the 
IPV outcomes. Differences in the love scale and differ-
ences in reports of internalized homophobia, however, 
had a positive relationship with the IPV outcomes, as 
well as both partners reporting polydrug use.
The adjusted Poisson GEE model summarized in Table 5 
indicates that the respondent’s age was negatively correlated 
with experiencing any type of IPV, perpetrating IPV, and 
both experiencing and perpetrating IPV (prevalence ratio 
[PR]: .99, 95% CI [.98, 1.0]; PR: .98, 95% CI [.97, .99]; PR: 
.97, 95% CI [.96, .99]). A respondent scoring in the top 20%

was positively correlated with any type of victimization, 
perpetration, and both (PR: 1.74, 95% CI [1.23, 2.45]; PR:

Discussion
The results of this study highlight individual and dyadic 
factors associated with minority stress as potential corre-
lates of IPV in same-sex male couples. This study is 
among the first studies of same-sex male dyads to exam-
ine violence where both partners of the dyad are indepen-
dently asked about IPV victimization and perpetration. 
This method of inquiry allows researchers to gather a 
more complete assessment of violence in these partner-
ships. These results inform the authors of the effects vari-
ous individual and dyadic factors may have on IPV in 
male couples and provide direction for future research 
and prevention interventions.
With respect to IPV, an alarmingly high rate of cou-
ples reported experiencing any form of IPV (nearly one 
in every two couples), with experiencing emotional IPV 
being especially high. This high prevalence is consistent 
with reports from other studies (Stephenson, Rentsch 
et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013), emphasizing the 
continued need for developing and testing culturally 
sensitive violence prevention programming. Similar to 
previous studies were perpetration rates of physical, 
emotional, and controlling IPV (Stephenson, Rentsch 
et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013), with higher rates 
of monitoring IPV reported in this study sample.

Minority stress theory postulates that negative societal 
attitudes toward social minority groups, such as MSM, 
contribute to social stressors among these groups 
(Hatzenbuehler, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Erickson, 2008; 
Meyer, 1995). The effects of minority stress on MSM in 
particular may include experiences of discrimination, 
internalized homophobia, and expectations of rejection, 
all of which have been associated with poor physical and 
behavioral health outcomes, including increased sub-
stance use disorders (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008). 
Internalized homophobia, a measure of internalized 
stigma and a factor in minority stress (Edwards & Sylaska, 
2013; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008), was reported by respon-
dents in this study at both the individual and dyadic levels 
and appeared to play an important role in understanding 
the high prevalence of violence observed in this sample. 
The stress created by this internalized stigma, coupled 
with other behaviors such as drug and alcohol use (which 
may also be exacerbated by minority stress factors), may 
have significant effects on IPV risk. Factors associated 
with minority stress and dyadic power struggles were 
among precipitants of IPV in a recent qualitative study of 
male couples (Goldenberg et al., 2016). Findings revealed 
that IPV was more common among partners who had 
experienced homophobic violence and who had tradition-
ally hegemonic views of masculinity that they had diffi-
culty negotiating, referred to as “struggling to be the 
alpha” (Goldenberg et al., 2016). Sexual risk behaviors, 
specifically condomless anal intercourse and stimulant 
use during sex, have been reported to co-occur with expe-
riencing IPV (Chakravarty et al., 2012; Kubicek et al., 
2015; Meyer, 1995; Stall et al., 2003; Stephenson, Rentsch 
et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013).
Results highlight the effects internalized homophobia 
and other relationship level and individual factors may 
have on violence prevalence. First, age had a negative 
effect on experience, perpetration, and both of any form of 
IPV, a finding mirrored in previous MSM violence studies 
(Greenwood et al., 2002; Stephenson et al., 2013). Older 
men may positively influence their partner and connect 
them to support networks, as well as be more understand-
ing and supportive partners by way of their lifetime expe-
riences. Cohabiting partners were at an increased risk of 
all IPV outcome categories (experience, perpetration, or 
both of any type of partner violence), which may be due to 
increased contact and possibility for violence when living 
together. This could also be tied to financial concerns and 
differences in home lifestyles that become more prevalent 
when a couple decides to live together, which may cause 
internal stress in the relationship that could lead to vio-
lence (Stephenson, Rentsch et al., 2011). Although few 
studies have explored the relationship between internal-
ized homophobia and violence and yielded similar results 
(Edwards & Sylaska, 2013; Finneran, Chard, Sineath, 
Sullivan, & Stephenson, 2012), these results do suggest a 
possible link between negative feelings of self and the 
prevalence of any form of violence which is especially 
pertinent to minority stress theory. The results of this anal-
ysis highlight that these covariates influence the presence 
of violence in a relationship, and this violence may often 
be mutually perpetrated within a partnership.
This study’s main limitations are in its sample size and 
the cross-sectional nature of the survey. The final included 
sample, comprised 160 male couples (320 individuals), 
was by no means a wholly representative sample of all 
male same-sex couples. Latino participants and those of 
other races were too few to be included in analysis and 
were thus grouped together as “multiracial/other,” though 
this may obscure possible unique relationships faced by 
those of non-White or non-Black racial backgrounds.

Public Health Implications
IPV among male–male couples has several implications on 
health, especially with behaviors associated with the risk 
of HIV transmission or acquisition, indicating a need for 
developing and testing culturally sensitive prevention 
intervention programs. This study is one of the first to 
independently gather data from both members of the dyad 
regarding partner violence and the first to do so while tak-
ing into account such a wide range of individual- and dyad-
level characteristics. This study demonstrates a high 
prevalence of violence among male same-sex couples and, 
despite its limitations, highlights an important connection 
between internalized homophobia and violence reporting 
among couples. Future dyad studies should incorporate 
mixed-methods approaches and repeated assessments in 
order to better understand factors that are causally related 
to IPV as possible intervention targets for this group.
