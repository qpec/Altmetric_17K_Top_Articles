Obesity is a growing public health problem, which has now been considered as a pandemic
non-communicable disease. However, the efficacy of several approaches for weight loss is
limited and variable. Thus, alternative anti-obesity treatments are urgently warranted, which
should be effective, safe, and widely available. Active compounds isolated from herbs are
similar with the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has a holistic approach
that can target to several organs and tissues in the whole body. Capsaicin, a major active
compound from chili peppers, has been clearly demonstrated for its numerous beneficial
roles in health. In this review, we will focus on the less highlighted aspect, in particular
how dietary chili peppers and capsaicin consumption reduce body weight and its potential
mechanisms of its anti-obesity effects. With the widespread pandemic of overweight and
obesity, the development of more strategies for the treatment of obesity is urgent. Therefore,
a better understanding of the role and mechanism of dietary capsaicin consumption and
metabolic health can provide critical implications for the early prevention and treatment of
obesity.
Introduction
The epidemic of obesity is a growing public health problem. The incidence of obesity has more than dou-
bled since 1980, and has now reached worldwide epidemic status [1]. In 2014, the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) estimated that 39% of the human adult population with 1.9 billion people were affected with
overweight (body mass index (BMI) �25 kg/m2), and that obesity (BMI �30 kg/m2) affected approxi-
mately 13% with 600 million people [2,3]. Obesity is a serious risk factor as it is associated with chronic
inflammation and metabolic syndrome [4], a cluster of morbidities that includes hypertension, hyperlipi-
demia, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [5]. It can increase the risks of developing serious health
problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and stroke [6,7]. Moreover, obese pa-
tients are more prone to contract several forms of cancer with reduced chances of survival [8]. Of particular
concern is the incidence of overweight and obesity in children, with an estimated one-third of children
and adolescents affected in the United States and over 41 million children are overweight before reaching
puberty [2]. As such, obesity and its related diseases yield enormous tolls at individual, public health, and
economic levels. In addition, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed compelling genetic
signals influencing obesity risk, and genetic polymorphism plays a major role in determining obesity [9].
An updated randomized controlled trial indicated the higher body weight and waist circumference reduc-
tions in risk carriers than in non-risk carriers of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene across
different levels of personalized nutrition [10]. These data signify that the interventions should be person-
alized and vary with each individual [11]. Thus, the development of novel and personalized strategies for
the early prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity is warranted.

Limitations in anti-obesity approaches
It has clearly established that weight loss will significantly diminish the complications of obesity [12]. Emerging hu-
man epidemiology studies indicated that reducing body weight, with weight loss of at least 5%, has long-term benefits
on metabolic health and reduces the risks of developing insulin resistance, T2DM, and cardiovascular diseases [13].
However, weight loss is difficult and the obese individuals are struggling to achieve it, and the efficacy of several ap-
proaches for weight loss is limited and variable [14,15]. Firstly, it is widely accepted that a combination of physical
exercise and low-calorie diet is the best approach to prevent and treat obesity. However, this strategy is difficult to
implement and its compliance is poor. Gupta et al. [16] aimed to explore treatment satisfaction associated with differ-
ent weight loss methods among patients with obesity. It showed that using self-modification weight loss techniques
such as diet, exercise, and weight loss supplements has lowest treatment satisfaction, compared with gastric bypass
and gastric banding, and prescription medication [16]. In addition, physical exercise and diet intervention also yield
enormous tolls at economic level. It reported that retail sales of weight loss supplements were estimated to be more
than $1.3 billion in 2001 in United States [17]. Thus, cheap, easily available therapies and supplements are urgently
needed. The second approach is pharmaceutical drugs, such as orlistat, a potent and specific inhibitor of intestinal
lipases. It can reduce body weight with an average weight loss of 3% during 1 year period [13]. However, its effi-
cacy is variable and it can lead to gastrointestinal adverse effects, liver failure, and acute kidney injury [18]. Other
anti-obesity drugs, such as rimonabant, fenfluramine, and sibutramine, have been withdrawn from the market due to
severe adverse effects, including increased cardiovascular risks, mood disorders, and even suicidal susceptibility [14].
Thirdly, anti-diabetic agents, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog, liraglutide has been shown its potential
anti-obesity efficacy [19]. But it needs to be injected subcutaneously daily. Moreover, the weight loss is limited and it
can increase the risk of pancreatitis [20]. Compared with aforementioned anti-obesity drugs, bariatric surgery such
as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy is more effective. However, it is physically invasive, relatively ex-
pensive, and its long-term effect is unclear [21]. Therefore, alternative anti-obesity treatments are urgently warranted,
which should be effective, safe, and widely available [15].
An overview of chili peppers and capsaicin
Chili pepper is generally used as a flavoring spice and is prominent in diets of various communities and cultures
worldwide since 7000BC, with a long history of flavoring, coloring, preserving food as well as medication [26]. In
chili pepper, more than 200 active constituents have been identified and some of its active constituents play multiple
roles in the whole body [27]. Capsaicin, as a major active compound from chili pepper, has been established for its nu-
merous beneficial roles in the human organism, including the treatment of pain inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis
[28], and vasomotor rhinitis (Figure 1) [29]. Furthermore, capsaicin has proven an effective anti-cancer agent. Sev-
eral preclinical studies showed that capsaicin could suppress various human neoplasia by generating reactive oxygen
species and increasing apoptosis [30,31]. Finally, capsaicin demonstrated significant antioxidant properties, and it
was postulated that this compound has important implications in the prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer’
s disease [32]. In addition to capsaicin as anti-obesity compounds, other types of natural
products also have shown to be considered as anti-obesity compounds. Celastrol (from roots of the thunder god vine)
can reduce appetite and food intake in mice that are fed a high-fat diet [33]. Stilbenoid resveratrol (from grapes and
red wine), genistein (an isoflavone from soy), glycyrrhizin (from liquorice), quercetin, ethanolic extract (from gin-
seng roots), and green tea extract (including camellia sinensis, catechin, caffeine, and epigallocatechin gallate) play
a role in adipogenesis inhibition, thus may have anti-obesity potency [15]. In this review, we will focus on the less

potential mechanisms of its anti-obesity effects. Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of capsaicin isolated from
chili peppers.
Clinical studies of the weight-loss effects of capsaicin
Weight-loss effects of capsaicin on lipid oxidation and energy expenditure
Epidemiological data revealed that the consumption of foods containing capsaicin was associated with a lower preva-
lence of obesity [34]. In one double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, it indicated that treatment of over-
weight or obese subjects with 6 mg/day capsinoid for 12 weeks was associated with abdominal fat loss measured by
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body weight was decreased as 0.9 and 0.5 kg in the capsinoid and placebo groups
respectively. Moreover, none of the patients developed any adverse events (Table 1) [35]. Lejeune et al. [36] aimed
to investigate whether capsaicin assists weight maintenance by limiting weight regain after weight loss of 5% to 10%.
The results showed that capsaicin treatment caused sustained fat oxidation during weight maintenance compared
with placebo (Table 1) [36]. Increase in the oxygen consumption (VO2) and body temperature reflecting increased
energy expenditure, thus play critical role in weight loss. Fat oxidation was reported to be sustained together with ele-
vation of the resting energy expenditure, and enhanced fat oxidation may contribute to increased energy expenditure.
In another randomized double-blind study, it indicated that subjects between 30 and 65 years old with a BMI >23
kg/m2 treated with capsinoid (10 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks safely and body weight tended to decrease during the
2- to 4-week period, with increased VO2, resting energy expenditure, and fat oxidation significantly (Table 1) [37].
Enhanced lipid oxidation and increased energy expenditure are potentially beneficial for weight management [38].
Weight-loss effects of capsaicin on appetite and brown adipose tissue
Dietary red pepper can suppress energy intake and modify macronutrient intake through appetite and satiety regula-
tion [39]. One prospective study aimed to investigate the effects of capsaicin on feeding behavior and energy intake. It
indicated that the addition of red pepper to the breakfast significantly decreased protein and fat intakes at lunch time,
and the addition of red pepper to the appetizer significantly reduced the cumulative ad libitum energy and carbohy-
drate intakes during the rest of the lunch. These effects might be related to an increase in sympathetic nervous system
activity (Table 1) [40]. BAT is known to play a critical role in cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis to maintain
body temperature, and it is expected to be a therapeutic target for obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans
[41]. It showed chili pepper affects energy expenditure by triggering the BAT in the same way as low temperature does,

leading to increased energy expenditure via non-shivering thermogenesis [42]. One recent clinical study showed that
9 mg of capsinoid for 8 weeks could increase BAT activity and increase thermogenesis in healthy subjects (Table 1)
[43]. The results suggest that dietary capsaicin consumption could have a beneficial effect for weight management,
by reducing energy intake and activation of BAT activity. The summary of the clinical studies about the weight-loss
effects of capsaicin was shown Table 1.
Preclinical studies about anti-obesity effects of capsaicin
and its potential mechanisms
Capsaicin and TRPV1 activation
Numerous epidemiology studies and animal studies indicated that capsaicin, as a transient receptor potential vanil-
loid 1 (TRPV1) agonist, may represent a potential strategy to treat obesity. Although it is well accepted that much of
the effect is caused by stimulation of the TRPV1 receptor, the mechanism of action is not presently fully understood.
Increasing evidence indicates that TRPV1 plays a critical role in the regulation of metabolic health for the whole body,
including body weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular system [44,45]. TRPV1 was deemed as a
potential target for the prevention of obesity due to its effect on energy metabolism and balance [46,47]. Activation
of TRPV1 by capsaicin can attenuate abnormal glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion and increasing
GLP-1 levels (Table 2) [48,49]. Furthermore, capsaicin also plays its role in a receptor-independent manner. It reported
that capsaicin was associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inactivation and peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-γ (PPARγ) activation, and then it could modulate the adipocyte function of adipose tissues in obese mouse
and suppressed the inflammatory responses of adipose tissue macrophages, which are independent on TRPV1 [50].
Additionally, TRPV1 can play a critical role in cell proliferation and cancer. It showed that TRPV1 implicated as a
regulator of growth factor signaling in the intestinal epithelium, which could subsequent suppress intestinal tumor-
genesis [51].
The potential mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity effects of capsaicin include: (1) increase lipid oxidation and
inhibit adipogenesis; (2) activate BAT activity and induce thermogenesis; (3) suppress appetite and increase satiety
regulated by neuronal circuits in the hypothalamus; (4) modulate the function of gastrointestinal tract and gut micro-
biome. The molecular mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of capsaicin were summarized in Figure 2. In addition,
we further collected most preclinical studies, including in vitro studies and rodent experiments about the anti-obesity
effects of capsaicin (Table 2).
Capsaicin and its role in adipogenesis
Adipogenesis is the critical and original process of fatty adipose accumulation. It suggested that decreased
preadipocyte differentiation, proliferation, and lipogenesis have the potential to reduce obesity. Hsu et al. [52]
demonstrated that capsaicin inhibited the expression of PPARγ, C/EBP-α, and leptin, but induced up-regulation
of adiponectin at the protein level. Thus, it efficiently induced apoptosis and inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1
preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro (Table 2, Figure 2) [52]. Zhang et al. [53] found that capsaicin treatment pre-
vented adipogenesis of 3T3-L1-preadipocytes in vitro, with increased intracellular calcium (Figure 2). Male C57BL/6
obese mice fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks received a supplement of 0.015% capsaicin showed decreased fasting glu-
cose, insulin, leptin concentrations, and markedly improved glucose intolerance in obese mice, accompanied with
decreased TRPV-1 expression in adipose tissue, increased adiponectin expression in the adipose tissue, and increased
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and PGC-1α expression in the liver (Table 2, Figure 2) [54].
Ohnuki et al. [55] demonstrated that mice treated with 10 mg/kg body weight capsaicin could markedly suppressed
body fat accumulation and promoted energy metabolism (Table 2). Hence, these studies supported that capsaicin
could decrease adipogenensis and regulate genes function related with lipid metabolism, and then it can has the po-
tential to lose weight.
Capsaicin and its role in brown adipose tissue
BAT is the main site of adaptive thermogenesis and experimental studies have associated BAT activity with protec-
tion against obesity and metabolic diseases [56]. A review illustrated that the activity of BAT can be activated and
recruited not only by cold exposure but also by various food ingredients, such as capsaicin in chili pepper (Table 2)
[57]. Capsinoids supplementation with exercise in C57BL/6J mice additively decreased body weight gain and fat accu-
mulation, and increased whole body energy expenditure compared with exercise alone. The underlying mechanisms
may be associated with increased energy expenditure, lipolysis activation in BAT, and increased cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) levels and PKA activity in BAT (Table 2, Figure 2) [58]. One up-to-date rodent experiment

showed that capsaicin could counter the detrimental effects of high-fat diet, including glucose intolerance, hyperc-
holesterolemia, and suppressed activity in BAT. These effects were mainly by increasing the expression of metabol-
ically important thermogenic genes, including UCP-1, BMP8b, SIRT-1, PGC-1α, and positive regulatory domain
containing zinc finger protein 16 (PRDM-16) in BAT. Furthermore, capsaicin supplementation, post high-fat diet,
promoted weight loss and enhanced the respiratory exchange ratio. All these data suggested that capsaicin is a novel
strategy to counter diet-induced obesity by enhancing metabolism and energy expenditure (Table 2, Figure 2) [59].
Baskaran et al. showed that activation of TRPV1 channels by dietary capsaicin triggered browning of adipose tissue
to counteract obesity (Table 2) [60]. Collectively, these observations provide evidence that capsaicin can activate and
recruit BAT, which would be a promising strategy to counter obesity.

Capsaicin and its role in appetite and satiety
Energy balance requires an ability of the brain to detect the status of energy stores and match energy intake with ex-
penditure, and energy homeostasis is mainly controlled by neuronal circuits in the hypothalamus [61]. Hypothalamic
endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs in individuals with obesity and is thought to induce low levels of leptin receptor
signaling and play a central role in development of leptin resistance [62]. The adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin
acts via its receptor in the brain to regulate energy balance and neuroendocrine function. Leptin resistance is a patho-
logical condition, which means the lack of appetite reduction in response to leptin and the body fails to adequately
respond to it [63]. Lee et al. [64] found that TRPV1 had a major role in regulating glucose metabolism and hypotha-
lamic leptin’
s effects in obesity, with hypothalamic STAT-3 activity blunted in the TRPV1 knockout mice (Figure 2).
Addition of dietary capsaicin has been shown to increase satiety and it indicated that capsaicin increased sensation
of fullness in energy balance, and decreased desire to eat after dinner in negative energy balance [65]. Although the
studies about capsaicin and its role in appetite is limited, it inspired us that neuronal circuits in the hypothalamus
may be a pivotal target of capsaicin.
Capsaicin and its role in gastrointestinal tract and gut microbiome
Capsaicin is passively absorbed in the stomach with greater than 80% efficiency and upper portion of the small in-
testine [66]. Thus, it may activate local TRPV1 channels in gastrointestinal tract to initiate a series of physiological
effects. Dietary capsaicin consumption triggered the intestinal mucosal afferent nerves and increased intestinal blood
flow [67]. Acute single administration of 640 μmol/l capsaicin into the duodenal lumen in anesthetized rats signif-
icantly increases superior mesenteric artery blood flow (Table 2) [68]. In addition, it showed that dietary capsaicin
ameliorated abnormal glucose homeostasis and increased GLP-1 levels in the plasma and ileum through the activation
of TRPV1-mediated GLP-1 secretion in the intestinal cells and tissues (Table 2, Figure 2) [49]. Recent study demon-
strated that anti-obesity effect of capsaicin in mice fed with high-fat diet was associated with an increase in population

of the gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila. Further studies found that capsaicin directly up-regulated the ex-
pression of Muc2 and antimicrobial protein gene Reg3g in the intestine (Table 2, Figure 2) [69]. These data suggested
that the anti-obesity effect of capsaicin is associated with a modest modulation of the function in gastrointestinal tract
and gut microbiome.
Conclusions
In summary, capsaicin plays a critical role in human and has multiple benefits for metabolic health, especially for
weight loss in obese individuals. It is well accepted that the potential application of active compounds isolated from
herbs are similar with the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, which has a holistic approach that can target to
different organs and tissues in the whole body. More importantly, no adverse effects with capsaicin were observed in
most studies. Thus, chili peppers and capsaicin are safely and easily applicable to our daily life. Considering that chili
peppers have been a vital part of culinary cultures worldwide and have a long history of use for flavoring, so it is more
feasible to be utilized to treat overweight and obesity, compare with medications or other interventions with certain
side effects. Dietary chili peppers supplementation or to be food additives, with ideal dosage may be tentative methods
for capsaicin to play its protective roles in metabolic health. With the widespread pandemic of overweight and obesity,
the development of more strategies for the treatment of obesity is urgent. Therefore, a better understanding of the
role and mechanism of dietary capsaicin consumption and metabolic health can provide critical implications for the
early prevention and treatment of obesity.
