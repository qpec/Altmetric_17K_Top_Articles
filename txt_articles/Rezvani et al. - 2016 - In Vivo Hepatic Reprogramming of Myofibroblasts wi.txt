SUMMARY
Liver fibrosis, a form of scarring, gradually develops in chronic liver diseases when hepatocyte 
regeneration cannot compensate for hepatocyte death. At earlier stages, collagen produced by 
activated myofibroblasts (MFs) functions to maintain tissue integrity, but upon repeated injury, 
collagen accumulation suppresses hepatocyte regeneration, ultimately leading to liver failure. As a

 strategy to generate new hepatocytes and limit collagen deposition in the chronically injured liver, 
we developed in vivo reprogramming of MFs into hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
vectors expressing hepatic transcription factors. We first identified the AAV6 subtype as effective 
in transducing MFs in mouse models of chronic liver disease. We then use lineage-tracing 
approaches to show that hepatocytes reprogrammed from MFs replicate primary hepatocyte 
function, and that liver fibrosis in AAV treated animals is reduced. Because AAV vectors are 
already used for liver-directed human gene therapy, our strategy has potential for clinical 
translation into a therapy for liver fibrosis.
INTRODUCTION
Liver fibrosis is a complication of chronic liver diseases associated with repeated hepatocyte 
death like viral hepatitis B and C, alcoholic liver disease and fatty liver disease (Bataller and 
Brenner, 2005; Friedman, 2008; Iredale, 2007; Schuppan and Afdhal, 2008). Liver fibrosis 
leads to liver cirrhosis, a common cause of death worldwide (Hoyert and Xu, 2012; Lim and 
Kim, 2008). In the United States alone, liver cirrhosis affects more than 600,000 patients 
(Scaglione et al., 2015). The only available cure is liver transplantation. Liver cell therapy is 
ineffective because of impaired engraftment (Hughes et al., 2012). The shortage of donor 
livers means only 6,000 patients benefit from this therapy and more than 35,000 patients die 
in the United States every year (Kim et al., 2014; Yoon et al.).
The biology of liver fibrosis has been studied extensively (Bataller and Brenner, 2005; 
Friedman, 2008; Iredale, 2007). Liver fibrosis is a repair mechanism that maintains the 
integrity of the injured liver through deposition of extracellular matrices such as collagen. 
Persistent liver injury causes collagen accumulation, which suppresses hepatocyte function 
and restricts intrahepatic blood flow, leading to liver failure, portal hypertension and liver 
cancer (Liu et al., 2012; Zhang and Friedman, 2012). Most of the collagen is produced by 
myofibroblasts (MFs), a mesenchymal liver cell type generated in large numbers by hepatic 
stellate cells (HSCs) or portal fibroblasts when they become activated in response to liver 
injury (Iwaisako et al., 2014; Mederacke et al., 2013). Because MFs are essential for liver 
fibrosis development and progression, we reasoned that in vivo reprogramming of MFs into 
hepatocytes would be effective as a therapy for liver fibrosis by replenishing the hepatocyte 
mass and limiting collagen production. For this, we built on previous studies of in vitro 
reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced hepatocytes (iHeps) by lentiviral or 
retroviral expression of the hepatic transcription factor (TF) genes Foxa3, Gata4 and Hnf1a 
(Huang et al., 2011) or Foxa1/Foxa2/Foxa3 and Hnf4a (Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011), 
respectively.
A prerequisite for clinical translation of in vivo reprogramming strategies is that delivery of 
TFs to the targeted cells is both efficient and safe (Addis and Epstein, 2013; Heinrich et al., 
2015). We therefore explored the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which have 
emerged as a safe and effective tool for gene delivery—including in clinical trials of liver-
directed gene therapy of hemophilia B (Nathwani et al., 2014; Nathwani et al., 2011)—
because they do not integrate into the genome or exhibit the strong immunogenicity that has 
hampered adenoviral vectors (Crystal, 2014).

 RESULTS
In Vivo Gene Delivery to MFs with an AAV Vector
Because AAV capsids with MF tropism were unknown, we performed a screen in the carbon 
tetrachloride (CCl4) mouse model of liver fibrosis (Liedtke et al., 2013). We focused on 
AAV capsids effective in transducing fibroblasts or other mesenchymal cell types, including 
the naturally occurring AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8 and AAV9 capsids (Blankinship 
et al., 2004; Di Pasquale et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2004; Grimm and Kay, 2003; Rutledge et 
al., 1998) and the engineered capsids AAV1P4 (seven amino acid re-targeting peptide 
displayed in an exposed capsid loop) (Borner et al., 2013), AAV2(Y444,500,730F) 
(mutation of three exposed tyrosines to phenylalanines) (Li et al., 2010) and AAV-DJ 
(chimera of AAV2/8/9) (Grimm et al., 2008). After treating wildtype mice with 12 doses of 
CCl4 we intravenously injected them with 1 × 1011 viral genomes of an AAV-EYFP vector 
pseudotyped with one of the nine capsids and analyzed the mouse organs after seven 
additional doses of CCl4. Only AAV6 had a relevant MF tropism, transducing 10.2 ± 5.3% 
of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive MFs (Figure 1A,B). Increasing the vector dose 
to 4 × 1011 viral genomes or intrahepatic injection increased the MF transduction efficiency 
to 23.6 ± 5.0% or 30.4 ± 4.36 %, respectively (Figure 1B,C). At a dose of 4 × 1011 viral 
genomes, AAV6 also transduced 7.9 ± 7.15% of Kupffer cells and 1.2 ± 0.53% of 
hepatocytes, but did not transduce cholangiocytes or endothelial cells (Figure S1A,B). 
Interestingly, the same AAV6 dose transduced only 2.3 ± 1.99% of desmin (DES)-positive 
HSCs in mice without liver injury (Figure S1C). As previously reported (Zincarelli et al., 
2008), intravenously injected AAV6 showed organ tropism for liver, skeletal muscle, heart 
and spleen (Figure S1D).
Hepatic Reprogramming of MFs
We used the AAV6 capsid to generate six AAV vectors expressing the TF genes Foxa1, 
Foxa2, Foxa3, Gata4, Hnf1a or Hnf4a from the CMV promoter (combination referred to as 
AAV6-6TFs). To test the efficacy of AAV6-6TFs, we transduced MFs generated by in vitro 
activation of primary mouse HSCs, which produced clones of cells that lost most of their 
original identity and acquired hepatocyte gene expression and function (Figure S1E-J).
To establish in vivo efficacy of AAV6-6TFs, we used a mouse model of MF fate tracing in 
which a constitutive reporter (R26R-ZsGreen) is activated by Cre recombinase expressed 
from the lecithin retinol acyltransferase (Lrat) promoter (Mederacke et al., 2013). We treated 
these mice with 12 doses of CCl4, intravenously injected them with 4 × 1011 viral genomes 
of AAV6-6TFs and analyzed their livers four weeks later (CCl4 stop protocol). We found 
cells expressing the MF fate-tracing marker ZsGreen and the hepatocyte markers HNF4α, 
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and major urinary protein (MUP) (Figure 2A,B), 
suggesting they were iHeps derived from MFs (MF-iHeps). To confirm this finding, we 
determined the specificity and efficiency of MF labeling in Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice 
treated with 12 doses of CCl4. As previously reported (Mederacke et al., 2013), we found 
that most (92.8%) MFs and few (0.021%) hepatocytes were labeled in these mice (Figure 
S2A). We also excluded cell fusion as the mechanism of MF-iHep formation (Figure S2B).

 Because AAV6 also transduced Kupffer cells (Figure S1A,B), we tested AAV6-6TFs in 
LysM-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen Kupffer cell fate-tracing mice (Clausen et al., 1999) (Figure 
S2A), which showed rare (< 0.01%) fate-traced hepatocytes after treatment with the CCl4 
stop protocol (Figure S2C). Moreover, AAV6-6TFs induced very few cells expressing 
hepatocyte markers in skeletal muscle, heart and spleen; none of these cells showed 
hepatocyte morphology (Figure S2D).
Next, we determined the efficiency of hepatic reprogramming of MFs by AAV6-6TFs under 
different conditions of fibrotic liver injury. In accord with our finding of low transduction of 
HSCs, we found only baseline levels of labeled hepatocytes in mice not treated with CCl4 
(Figure 2A,B). We found the most MF-iHeps—0.87% of all hepatocytes in the liver—in 
mice treated with 16 doses of CCl4 (Figure 2B,C). MF-iHeps were mostly single cells in 
these mice but clonally expanded in mice treated with 21 doses of CCl4, leading to a similar 
overall number of MF-iHeps despite a lower number of MF-iHep clones (Figure 2B). 
Findings were similar in mice in which we induced liver injury with 12 doses of CCl4 and 
reinstated it after a two-week break with additional 12 doses (recurring CCl4 protocol), and 
in mice continuously treated with CCl4—10 doses before and 12 doses after intravenous 
injection of AAV6-6TFs (continuous CCl4 protocol) (Figure 2A,B). We validated these 
results in mice with liver fibrosis due to steatohepatitis induced by continuous feeding of a 
choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet (Knight et al., 2007; Liedtke et al., 
2013) (Figure 2A,B). These findings suggest that severe liver fibrosis and ongoing liver 
injury reduce the efficiency of hepatic reprogramming of MFs, most likely because collagen-
engulfed MFs are less accessible to AAV vectors and because nonintegrating AAV vectors 
are lost from proliferating MFs (Li et al., 2011; Nakai et al., 2001). However, these findings 
also show that MF-iHep proliferation can compensate for reduced MF-iHep formation.
Normal Proliferation of MF-iHeps
Prompted by our finding of clonal expansion of MF-iHeps, we determined whether MF-
iHeps proliferate normally. For this, we compared clone size of MF-iHeps and primary 
hepatocytes between Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice treated with the recurring CCl4 protocol 
and R26R-ZsGreen mice receiving the same CCl4 treatment but intravenous injection of 2 × 
1010 viral genomes of hepatocyte-targeted AAV8-Ttr-Cre vector to label hepatocytes at low 
frequency (Tarlow et al., 2014a). We found a similar clone size distribution in MF-iHeps and 
primary hepatocytes (Figure S3A).
Because nonintegrating AAV vectors are lost from proliferating cells (Li et al., 2011; Nakai 
et al., 2001), these results also suggested that MF-iHeps are stably reprogrammed. We 
confirmed this hypothesis by showing that AAV6-6TFs were present in newly formed MF-
iHeps and absent in clonally expanded MF-iHeps isolated by laser-capture microdissection 
(LCM) (Figure S3B-D).
Normal Function of MF-iHeps
To determine whether MF-iHeps acquire full hepatocyte differentiation, we profiled their 
global gene expression with microarrays. For this, we isolated MF-iHeps by LCM from 
Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice four to 10 weeks after treatment with 16 doses of CCl4 and

 intravenous injection of AAV6-6TFs. As controls we used primary hepatocytes from the 
same mice and MFs from CCl4-treated littermates, isolated by LCM and FACS, respectively. 
We found that MF-iHeps closely resembled primary hepatocytes (Figures S3E). Few of the 
908 significantly differentially expressed (P ≤ 0.025) genes were associated with hepatocyte 
differentiation, as illustrated by mostly normal expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes 
specific for immature or mature hepatocytes (Peng et al., 2012) (Table S1 and Figure 3A,C). 
However, MF-iHeps expressed some genes associated with MF or HSC differentiation 
(Figure 3B,C), suggesting that they retained some original identity. Importantly, this 
MF/HSC memory was minimal and did not translate into impaired hepatocyte function, as 
evidenced by normal albumin secretion, CYP3A activity and urea production in MF-iHeps 
isolated from Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice by FACS (Figure 3D-F).
Antifibrotic Effect and Further Development of In Vivo Hepatic Reprogramming of MFs
To test the efficacy of our strategy in a model of chronic fibrotic liver injury, the most 
challenging clinical scenario, we used the continuous CCl4 protocol (Figure 2B). We found 
reduced liver fibrosis in AAV6-6TF recipients as assessed by Sirius red staining, αSMA IF 
and hydroxyproline measurement (Figure 4A,B). In addition, serum levels of the hepatocyte 
injury marker alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were reduced in these mice (Figure 4C). 
Findings were similar in mice continuously fed a CDE diet (Figures 2B and 4D-F).
Next, we defined the contribution of MF-iHeps to reduced liver fibrosis and injury. Because 
the number of Kupffer cell-derived hepatocytes induced by AAV6-6TFs was negligible 
(Figure S2C), we investigated the contribution of increased expression of hepatic TFs in 
hepatocytes (Nishikawa et al., 2015). For this, we generated hepatocyte-targeted AAV8 
vectors expressing the six TFs (AAV8-6TFs) and intravenously injected them—at a dose at 
which each of the six vectors transduced 1.2% of hepatocytes (Figure S1B and Table S2)—
into mice treated with the continuous CCl4 protocol (Figure 2B). We found that liver fibrosis 
and injury were not significantly reduced in these mice (Figure S4A-C), although whole 
liver gene expression of fibrolytic MMP9 and MMP12 was increased (Ramachandran et al., 
2012) (Figure S4D). We also used AAV8-6TFs to exclude unspecific activation of MF fate 
tracing in hepatocytes of Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice (Figure S4E). These results show 
that the therapeutic efficacy of our strategy is mainly due to hepatic reprogramming of MFs.
To identify the essential TFs, we determined which of the six AAV6-TF vectors are enriched 
in newly formed MF-iHeps in vivo (Figure S4F). Based on this analysis and in vitro and in 
vivo validation, we arrived at FOXA3, GATA4 and HNF1α as the most effective minimal TF 
combination (Figure S4G-M). These findings accord with a previous study that used 
lentiviral vectors for hepatic reprogramming of fibroblasts in vitro, except that AAV6-
mediated in vitro or in vivo hepatic reprogramming of MFs did not require p19 inactivation 
(Huang et al., 2011).
Finally, we established efficient transduction and hepatic reprogramming of primary human 
MFs with AAV6 vectors in vitro (Figure S4N-Q).

 DISCUSSION
Our study establishes the feasibility of in vivo reprogramming of MFs into fully functional 
hepatocytes using AAV vectors, a gene delivery tool that proved to be safe and effective in 
clinical trials of liver-directed gene therapy (Nathwani et al., 2014; Nathwani et al., 2011). 
To develop this strategy into a therapy for patients with liver fibrosis, the number of MFs 
that express the essential TFs needs to be increased. To maximize the efficacy of the 
wildtype AAV6 capsid, the essential TFs could be delivered with one vector, which would be 
feasible if a short promoter, self-cleaving 2A peptides and a synthetic polyA signal are used 
(Ostedgaard et al., 2005). In addition, the MF transduction efficiency could be improved, 
which—as illustrated by our findings made after intrahepatic vector injection—could be 
achieved by detargeting AAV6 from extrahepatic cells. For this, technologies like AAV 
capsid DNA shuffling or peptide display could be used (Grimm et al., 2008; Lisowski et al., 
2014). As a safety measure, residual extrahepatic TF expression could be prevented by 
tagging with target sequences of tissue-specific microRNAs (Xie et al., 2011). Further aided 
by the ability of MF-iHeps to expand in response to liver injury, our strategy of repurposing 
MFs has potential as a therapy for liver fibrosis that addresses both insufficient hepatocyte 
function and collagen accumulation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
All procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee at the University of California San Francisco. All mice were housed under 
barrier conditions. Wildtype mice and mice heterozygous for Lrat-Cre (Mederacke et al., 
2013) or LysM-Cre (Clausen et al., 1999) and heterozygous for R26R-ZsGreen (Madisen et 
al., 2010) were used. All mice were C57BL/6 and 5-16 weeks old. Littermates and male and 
female mice were equally distributed between experimental and control groups. Mice were 
not randomized and investigators were not blinded.
Liver Fibrosis Models
Mice received intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 μL/g body weight carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) 
diluted 1:4 in corn oil (both Sigma-Aldrich) every 2 days. Livers were analyzed 2 or 3 days 
after the last CCl4 dose. Alternatively, mice were fed a diet deficient in choline (MP 
Biomedicals) supplemented with 0.15% (w/v) ethionine (Sigma-Aldrich) in drinking water.
AAV Vectors
AAV vectors were produced in HEK293T cells (Agilent Technologies) and purified using 
iodixanol (Sigma-Aldrich) density gradients (Zolotukhin et al., 1999). To reduce iodixanol 
thickness for intravenous injection, AAV vectors were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS)/5% sorbitol at a ratio of 5:1. AAV vectors were also produced by Virovek in insect 
cells using the baculovirus expression system (Chen, 2008). AAV vectors from Virovek were 
purified using cesium chloride gradients and diluted in PBS containing 0.001% pluronic 
F-68 (Sigma-Aldrich) for intravenous injection. Mice were intravenously injected via the tail 
vein with 4 × 1011 viral genomes of each vector unless otherwise specified. Vector injections

 were performed slowly and the volume was limited to 300 μL for tail vein injection and 50 
μl for intrahepatic injection.
Calculation of Hepatic Reprogramming Efficiency and Liver Repopulation
The percentage of MF-iHep clones (single cells or nodules) of all hepatocytes in the liver is 
the hepatic reprogramming efficiency. The total number of hepatocytes per 10x field in a 
liver section was determined by FAH immunofluorescence and DAPI staining. After 
correcting for hepatocyte-free areas in a field, e.g., blood vessels and mesenchyme, MF-iHep 
clones were quantified in > 2,000 hepatocytes per mouse in randomly taken 10x images of ≥ 
2 liver sections from ≥ 2 liver lobes. MF-iHep clones were identified by co-expression of 
ZsGreen and FAH. The percentage of all MF-iHeps of all hepatocytes in the liver is the 
extent of liver repopulation.
Statistical Analyses
Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD). 
Statistical differences between experimental and control groups were determined by 
Student’s t test (unpaired, two-tailed) unless otherwise specified. A P value of less than 0.05 
was considered significant. Prism 6.0 (Graphpad) was used for statistical analyses.

 Figure 3. Characterization of MF-iHep Differentiation and Function
(A-C) Microarray and qRT-PCR analysis of MFs, primary hepatocytes (Heps) and MF-
iHeps (n = 3, 3 and 5 biological replicates). Color key includes log2 microarray values.
(A) Heatmap of genes reflecting hepatocyte differentiation in microarray analysis (brown 
cells in column A of Table S1). All CYP genes specific for immature or mature primary 
hepatocytes, i.e., enriched in neonatal or adult mouse liver (Peng et al., 2012), and expressed 
> 15-fold higher in Heps than in MFs were included. In addition, examples of intermediate 
CYP genes that peak in the adolescent mouse liver and decrease moderately (Cyp1a2) or 
markedly (Cyp2e1 and Cyp2c55) in the adult mouse liver were included (Peng et al., 2012). 
Immature or adolescent CYP genes are in italics. Other genes were derived from the 
literature (Huang et al., 2011; Tarlow et al., 2014b). Significantly differentially expressed (P 
≤ 0.025) genes are bold.
(B) Heatmap of genes reflecting MF/HSC differentiation in microarray analysis (gray cells 
in column A in Table S1). All collagen genes expressed > 10-fold higher in MFs than in 
Heps were included. Other genes were derived from the literature; genes expressed higher in 
MFs than in HSCs are in italics (Duarte et al., 2015; Hayes et al., 2014; Henderson et al., 
2013; Iwaisako et al., 2014; Lua et al., 2016; Mederacke et al., 2013; Schuppan et al., 2001). 
Significantly differentially expressed (P ≤ 0.025) genes are bold.
(C) qRT-PCR analysis of hepatocyte and MF/HSC genes in the microarray samples. Results 
are means ± SEM for biological replicates (n = 3 for MFs, n = 5 for MF-iHeps and n = 3 for 
Heps). n.d., not detected.
