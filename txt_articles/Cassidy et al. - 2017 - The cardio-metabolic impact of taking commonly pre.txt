Abstract
Objective
There has been a significant increase in the prescribing of medication for chronic non-can-
cer pain. In a UK population sample, we aimed to assess cardio-metabolic (CM) health in
those taking these chronic pain medications.
Methods
133,401 participants from the UK Biobank cohort were studied. BMI, waist cm and hyperten-
sion were compared between those on drugs prescribed for chronic pain and CM drugs to
those on CM drugs only. Multiple confounders were controlled for.
Results
Those taking opiates and CM drugs had the worst CM health profile with a 95%, 82% and
63% increased odds of reporting obesity, ‘very high risk’ waist circumference and hyperten-
sion, respectively (OR [95% CI] 1.95 [1.75–2.17], 1.82 [1.63–2.03], 1.63 [1.45–1.84]), com-
pared to those on CM drugs alone. Those taking neuropathic pain medications and CM
drugs also demonstrate worse CM profile than those taking CM drugs only.
Conclusions
The impact of medications for chronic pain and sleep upon CM health and obesity is of con-
cern for these classes of drugs which have been recently labelled as dependency forming
medications. The results from this cross sectional study warrants further investigation and
adds further support to calls for these medications to be prescribed for shorter periods.

 Introduction
Obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes represent significant personal, societal and
economic burden [1,2]. The inter-relationship between metabolic and cardiovascular disease
is termed cardio-metabolic (CM) health. Those with both CVD and type 2 diabetes have a par-
ticularly poor prognosis and require aggressive risk factor intervention [3]. Obesity now affects
34.9% of all US adults and 26% of UK adults with a greater than doubling of the prevalence
over the last 30 years [4].
There is increasing recognition of the metabolic impact of many prescribed analgesic medi-
cations used for relief of chronic pain. Certain medications have been used far more widely in
recent years, in particular those for chronic non cancer pain. This includes opioids, the alpha2-
delta ligands pregabilin and gabapentin and certain antidepressants shown to decrease neuro-
pathic pain, in particular amitriptyline and more recently duloxetine which is specifically
licensed for diabetic neuropathic pain. Many of these medications have been labelled as depen-
dence-forming medications (DFM) whereby patients require continual use to maintain a state
of normality and avoid symptoms of withdrawal [5]. Prescribing data shows a substantial rise
in these prescriptions over the last ten years in the UK and the US. An estimated 3–4% of US
adults are prescribed opioids [6]. The use of strong opioids has increased alongside gabapentin
and pregabilin [7].
The increased use of opioid medication has led to increasing recognition of their side effects
when used chronically and the use of long term opioid medication has become increasingly
controversial with recent, far reaching changes to reduce prescribing in the US [8]. The dan-
gers of addiction, sleep disordered breathing, daytime sedation and accidental overdose are
well known and researched [9]. The impact of opioids upon appetite, metabolism and the insu-
lin axis is less well studied [10]. More recently cohort studies have suggested that those using
chronic opiate prescriptions in particular have an increased mortality rate from all causes but
there may be many confounding factors when studying those with chronic pain and the rea-
sons for this association remain debated [11].
Weight gain with neuropathic pain meds is described but often in small studies looking at
the impact upon the first 6–12 weeks of prescription [12,13]. There have been few large studies
addressing the potential association between commonly prescribed analgesic drugs and CM
health. However, smaller studies following patients prescribed gabapentin, pregabilin, amitrip-
tyline have shown increased BMI in those followed up between periods of 3–6 months. Weight
gain is cited as one of the commonest reasons for discontinuing these medications [14]. Opi-
ates have been shown to cause insulin resistance but whether they clearly cause weight gain
over time remains debated [10]. Many of the analgesic drugs cause sedation and increase the
risk of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disturbance in itself causes insulin resistance with
increasing recognition of the association between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance,
worse CM health and increased obesity [15].
The UK Biobank is a large population-based cohort which allows measurement of com-
monly used prescription drugs alongside important indicators of CM health, physical activity
and lifestyle behaviours [16]. Our primary aim was to assess CM health in those taking com-
monly prescribed analgesic drugs. Our secondary objective was to further explore associations
with lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet and sleep duration to try and understand the
mechanism of any metabolic disturbance.
Given that many participants are prescribed combinations of opiates and neuropathic pain
relief, we elected to study those on any combination of prescribed analgesic medication includ-
ing opiates, antidepressants recommended for chronic pain and the alpha2delta ligands preg-
abilin and gabapentin. We hypothesized that this group would be more likely to have poor CM

 health and increased obesity and that this association would persist as an independent risk fac-
tor when controlling for other lifestyle factors.
Methods
Population and study design
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on baseline data from the UK Biobank. The UK
Biobank is a large, population-based cohort study examining the interrelationships between
environment, lifestyle and genes [16]. Around 9.2 million invitations were mailed to recruit
502,664 adults (response rate 5.5%) aged between 37 and 73 years. Between 2007–2010 partici-
pants attended a baseline assessment at one of the 22 centres located across the UK. During an
assessment centre visit, there were six stages; consent, touchscreen questionnaire, verbal inter-
view, eye measures, physical measures and blood/urine sample collection. Details of proce-
dures have been previously published [16]. Participant written informed consent was obtained
prior to data collection. All data extracted were deidentified for analysis.
Baseline measurements
Sociodemographic, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, dietary intake and sleep duration data
were collected from the touchscreen questionnaire. Smoking and alcohol status were obtained
by asking participants to respond to ‘Prefer not to answer’, ‘Never’, ‘Previous’ and ‘Current’.
Physical activity was assessed using adapted questions from the validated short International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)[17] which collects information on the frequency and
duration of time spent in walking, moderate and vigorous activity in the previous 7 days. Data
processing rules for IPAQ were followed [18]. According to the current UK physical activity
guidelines [19] we identified those who reached 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vig-
orous activity per week, or a combination of both. Walking was considered as moderate activ-
ity. Participants reported how long they spent watching television (TV) on a typical day. This
was asked twice to those who responded >8 hours, therefore high values were deemed robust.
Those who reported more than 3 hours/day were identified based upon previous literature
[20]. Diet was reported using the Food Frequency Questionnaire [21] and healthy eating was
assessed using the UK’s fruit and vegetable guidelines of 5 portions per day [21]. The townsend
deprivation index combines information on housing, employment, car availability and social
class, with higher values representing lower socioeconomic status. This was calculated before
participants joined the UK Biobank and was based on the preceding national census data, with
each participant assigned a score corresponding to the home postcode [16].
To measure sleep duration, participants were asked ‘About how many hours sleep do you
get in every 24 hours?’ (please include naps). This was asked twice to those who responded
>12 hours. As sleep shows a ‘U’ shaped relationship with CM risk [22], we created 3 sleep
duration groups of <6 (poor sleep), 6–9 (good sleep), and >9 hours (poor sleep) per night.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from: weight (kg)/height(m)2. Weight was measured
using the Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyser, to the nearest 0.1 kg and height was
measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the
level of the umbilicus using a Wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measure, which has previ-
ously been adopted in large health studies [23]. Participants were asked to adjust clothing for
accuracy, and all staff were trained in taking these measures. Self-report disease status (includ-
ing Sleep Apnoea and hypertension) and medication use was obtained from participants dur-
ing the touchscreen questionnaire, which was then entered and verified by a UK Biobank
nurse after further questioning during the verbal interview. The interview provided extra

 information such as time of diagnosis, and if the trained nurse decides that the illness or medi-
cation had been incorrectly selected, they could remove the selection.
Four groups were created depending on self-reported medication use. These included:
1. CM controls: those taking the most commonly prescribed CM drugs according to the UK
prescribing data available from 2010 (http://content.digital.nhs.uk/gpprescribingdata). This
included atenolol, ramipril, bendroflumethazide, losartan, clopidogrel, simvastatin, and
atorvastatin (the exact list from the UK biobank coding can be seen in S1 Table).
2. Neuropathic pain medication which was defined as; Pregabilin (Lyrica), Gabapentin (Neu-
rontin), Amitriptyline, Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Amitriptyline + chlordiazepoxide
3. Opiate medication, those who reported taking any of the following prescribed medications;
Morphine sulphate tablets (MST), Tramadol, Paracetomol + Tramadol, oramorph (9 differ-
ent doses), Cocodamol, codydramol (paracetamol + dihydrocodeine), Fentanyl patch,
Buprenorphine
4. Combination prescriptions that included those prescribed both neuropathic pain medica-
tion and opiates
Statistical analysis
Socio-demographics and lifestyle behaviours were compared across medication groups, but
owing to the large sample size, Pearson’s χ2 deemed any small difference in group proportions
as significant, therefore, these results are not reported. Individuals with missing data on either
BMI, waist cm, or hypertension (main outcomes) were excluded. Their socio-demographics,
which were similar to the main cohort, but included a higher proportion of males and higher
deprivation scores, can be seen in S2 Table. Binary logistic regression was used to determine
the odds of being obese, having a ‘very high risk’ waist cm, or hypertensive, across medication
groups. Adjusted ORs, with 95% CIs were reported. All logistic regression models were
adjusted for: age (reference = ‘37–49’); gender (reference = ‘Female’); townsend Deprivation
Index (reference = ‘least deprived); ethnicity (reference = ‘White/British); alcohol (reference =
‘Never’); smoking (reference = ‘Never’); meets fruit/vegetable guidelines (reference = ‘YES’);
meets physical activity guidelines (reference = ‘YES’) and sleep duration (reference = good
sleep). Of the 133,401 cohort, data was missing for; Townsend Deprivation Index (0.1%), eth-
nicity (0.5%), smoking status (0.6%), alcohol status (0.2%), physical activity (21.4%), and fruit
and vegetable guidelines (3.6%), sleep (1.0%) therefore, these cases were excluded from the
logistic regression models and the final model was n = 102,100. All statistical analysis was per-
formed using SPSS, V21.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) and significance was set at
p<0.05, two sided.
Results
Of the 502 664 UK Biobank participants, excluding those with missing data for BMI, waist cm,
or hypertension, 125,978 (25.2%) were taking CM drugs and 7,423 (1.5%) were taking some
form of prescribed analgesic alongside CM drugs, their demographics are shown in Table 1.
4461 were prescribed neuropathic pain medication, 2125 using opiates and 837 using both
neuropathic pain drugs and opiates, in addition to their CM drugs. There were a higher pro-
portion of females over 60 years old taking prescribed analgesics and were more deprived than
the CM control group (Table 1).
There was a higher proportion of current smokers in those taking analgesics, but a lower
proportion of current drinkers, compared to those on CM drugs only. The proportion of

 adults sleeping less than 6 hours or more than 9 hours per night was higher in the analgesic
groups. Those taking combination prescriptions of both neuropathic pain medication and opi-
ates showed the worst sleep patterns compared to CM controls (Good sleep (6-9hrs): 71.4% vs
91.3%, respectively). Those on analgesics reported lower physical activity levels, and greater
TV viewing but did not show worse eating behaviours compared to the CM controls (Table 2).
Compared with the CM controls, those taking analgesics were more likely to be obese, have
a ‘very high risk’ waist cm and be diagnosed with hypertension. The proportion of obese indi-
viduals in the ‘neuropathic pain meds + opiate’ group was greater than those in the ‘CM con-
trol’ group (58.3% vs.35.4%, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for ‘very high risk’
waist cm, and the proportion of those with hypertension was higher across all analgesic groups
(Neuropathic pain meds-67.8%, Opiates-74.5%, Neuropathic pain meds + opiates-70.7% vs.
62.4%). These CM characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The shift towards this poor CM
health profile is visualized in Fig 1.
After controlling for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors which impact upon CM health,
the odds of being obese, having a ‘very high risk’ waist cm and hypertension was significantly
increased in those on analgesic medication. Those taking opiates showed the worst CM profile
and were 95% more likely to be obese (OR [95%] 1.95 [1.75–2.17]), 82% more likely to have a
‘very high risk’ waist cm (1.82 [1.63–2.11]) and 63% more likely to have hypertension (1.63
[1.45–1.84]) compared to those on CM medication only. The data is shown in Table 3. The
risk is visualized for medication groups in Fig 2.
Given that analgesics are associated with sleep [24], the potential contribution to obesity
from poor sleep was explored further. This expands upon work published already showing
increased CM risk for those who sleep <7 hours or > 8 hours a night. Further analysis on an

showed that independent of sleep duration and other risk factors, those taking analgesics were
more likely to be obese, have a ‘very high risk’ waist cm and hypertension, this is summarized
in Table 3.

 We considered whether those with known sleep apnoea were seen more commonly in
those on medication and reviewed the patient self report data for those with a diagnosis of
sleep apnoea. Very few patients in any group reported a known diagnosis of sleep apnoea, only
0.6% of those on CM drugs only 1.2% of those on neuropathic pain medication, 1.5% of those
on opiates, and 1.3% of those on both opiates and neuropathic pain medication.
Discussion
This cross-sectional analysis of the UK Biobank cohort has shown that those using sedative
analgesic drugs, and in particular opiates, were far more likely to have poor CM health and
increased obesity compared to those on CM drugs only. Those prescribed analgesic drugs

 were more likely to have abnormal sleep. This is the largest study to assess the impact of anal-
gesic drugs on CM health. It also confirms that those with poor sleep have increased obesity.
In the last two decades there has been a significant increase in the prescribing of both opioid
and non-opioid medications to treat chronic pain [7]. However, this came with few trials

 assessing long term effects, under recognition of their potential for addiction and accidental
overdose and low therapeutic ratio. Now an estimated 3–4% of Americans are prescribed opi-
oids [8]. A recent meta-analysis showed no benefit for chronic spinal pain in those taking opi-
ates even up to the high doses of 240mg morphine a day [25]. Opioid overdose is now the
leading cause of non-injury death, quadrupling in the last 15 years [26]. However more
recently, an increased rate of death outside of accidental overdose has been described. A retro-
spective cohort study looked at total and cause specific mortality in over 22,000 long acting
opioid prescriptions and compared outcomes to those using tricyclic antidepressants or the
analgesic anticonvulsants. Excluding overdose, out of hospital deaths and cardiovascular
deaths were almost doubled over a six month follow up (Hazard ratio 1.72 and 1.68 respec-
tively) with the greatest risk coming in the first 30 days of therapy [11].
In our cohort, those on opioids had far worse CM health with increased rates of hyperten-
sion and obesity. There could be a number of possible mechanisms by which opioids might be
associated with weight gain. Sedation might decrease physical activity and therefore reduce
energy expenditure, those in our cohort taking opiates were less active and those taking both
opiates and other sedative drugs were the least active. Opioids have also been shown to alter

 taste perception with a craving for sugar and sweet foods described (9). Using fruit and vegeta-
ble consumption as an indicator of diet, the data suggest there was nono major difference in
diet between groups in our cohort. Many taking opioids have sleep disordered breathing and
disturbed sleep for any reason is associated with disruption of metabolic control (21).
Opioids are also known to worsen both snoring and untreated sleep apnoea. Only 1% of
those on opiates reported a known diagnosis of sleep apnoea but this condition is known to be
underdiagnosed (31) and this would appear to be the case with our cohort given an expected
prevalence of at least 10% of men and 5% of women over the age of 40 [27]. Therefore, undiag-
nosed sleep apnoea worsened or induced by opioids could cause both impaired CM health and
nocturnal hypertension.
The most widely used analgesic drugs in the antidepressant class are amitriptyline and
more recently duloxetine. A number of antidepressants have been shown to effect weight and
metabolism, typically via histaminergic activation [28]. Weight gain remains one of the most
commonly reported adverse events and reason for discontinuation [29]. The Alpha2delta
ligands pregabilin and gabapentin have been used far more frequently for chronic pain, often
as an alternative to opiates but sedation and weight gain are also commonly reported adverse
events with one study suggesting a dose responsive effect with 7% increase in BMI from base-
line over 14 weeks [30]. Separating gabaergic drugs from amitriptyline and duloxetine (S3
Table) shows increased risks of obesity but no difference in hypertension. The mechanism of
weight gain is not clear for these medications but could relate to reduction of physical activity
due to sedation. To date there has not been evidence of deteriorating glycaemic control [31].
Clearly the possibility of the underlying medical condition the drug is used for being the cause
of increased weight must be considered. However, weight gain is described with pregabilin,
gabapentin and amitrptyline used for a wide range of causes. Given that many conditions
including migraine, chronic low back pain and diabetic neuropathy are worse in those who are
more obese, this raises the possibility of a viscous circle with weight gain from medication that
might be effective when used acutely but when used chronically may perpetuate rather than
improve pain by increasing weight.
No previous studies have reported an association between hypnotics and worse CM health
and again it is not possible to determine causality but this warrants further investigation. Hyp-
notics have been associated with daytime sedation sufficient to impair driving and to cause
falls in an older population [32], they might therefore impact on daily physical activity to con-
tribute to obesity
The proportion of long (>9 hours/night) and short sleepers (<6 hours/night) increased
in all medication groups compared to those on no medication. Fig 3 shows an association
between short and long sleep and obesity (Fig 3), in agreement with previous work [33]. As
many chronic non-cancer pain drugs are known to disrupt sleep, the relationship between CM
health and these drugs could be driven primarily through sleep disruption. That being said,
those on medication had significantly higher odds of obesity, a ‘very high risk’ waist cm and
hypertension, independent of sleep duration.
Limitations of the data include a lack of knowledge about the dose of medications taken
given that previous studies have suggested that higher doses of drugs cause a greater increase
in BMI [12]. The additional limits of a cross sectional study is a lack of knowledge about the
duration of the prescription. Further analysis of the UK Biobank cohort over time will allow a
longitudinal study of the impact of those medications on long term obesity and CM health
and more precise dosage analysis. The 4 groups were chosen so that the metabolic impact of
drugs frequently used in combination within chronic pain could be investigated. However
within the 4 groups, medications have variable modes of action, therefore we performed extra
sub-group analysis with a ‘statin’ and ‘pregaballin/Gabapentin’ group due to their diverse

 neuromodulatory effects in the brain (S3 Table). Sleep duration was by self report only and
could not distinguish causes of sleep disturbance for example undiagnosed obstructive sleep
apnoea or restless legs. There may also be reporter inaccuracy. However, the findings of a U
shaped curve with both very short and very long sleepers having increased mortality has been
reported by a number of other large population studies, as has the association with obesity
[34].
Conclusions
This dataset has shown that those taking analgesic drugs had worse CM health and increased
obesity even when controlling for multiple confounders and other commonly prescribed CM
drugs. This warrants further investigation. The effect was most pronounced for opiates, and
the impact upon weight, blood pressure and sleep is of concern for these DFMs. The data from
this study adds further support to calls for these medications to be prescribed for shorter peri-
ods and raises further questions about the safety of their use.
