Anabolic steroids in the UK: an increasing issue for public health
Jim McVeigh and Emma Begley
Public Health Institute, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK
Abstract
Aim: The aim of the paper was to identify changes in the extent and patterns of anabolic steroid
use in the United Kingdom to better understand the public health implications within the
context of the current health-related evidence base. Methods: Using the two time points
between 1995 (prior to legislation changes in the United Kingdom) and 2015, a review of the
evidence related to health harms was conducted, in conjunction with needle and syringe
programme (NSP) data in Cheshire & Merseyside (UK) relating to anabolic steroid users.
Findings: Dramatic increase in the number of anabolic steroid users accessing NSPs, 553 in 1995
to 2446 in 2015, now accounting for 54.9% of clients. With the inclusion of pharmacy NSPs, this
rose to 5336 individual anabolic steroid users. Conclusions: Key changes in our knowledge
during the 20 years, in particular, in relation to HIV prevalence, changes in the market and
patterns of use make anabolic steroid use a public health concern. In the context of increasing
numbers of injectors, there is a need for comprehensive interventions.

Introduction
Whilst the media and much of society have focussed on the
use of drugs to enhance performance in elite sport, ‘‘doping’’
or ‘‘cheating’’, the reality is that the 21st century has seen
the use of anabolic steroids become commonplace within the
general population of a number of countries, including the
United Kingdom. The modern era of anabolic steroids
commenced in the early part of the 20th Century. This was
largely due to pharmacological developments, with the
isolation of testosterone (de Kruif, 1945) and the rapid
expansion of patent and secret remedies (British Medical
Association, 1909). During the last 20 years, with advances in
pharmacology, technology and the introduction and expansion
of the Internet, there has been an unprecedented increase in
interest, availability and use of enhancement drugs in general,
and anabolic steroids in particular (Evans-Brown, McVeigh,
Perkins, & Bellis, 2012). The term anabolic steroids (some-
times termed anabolic androgenic steroids) relate to testos-
terone and its synthetic derivatives. Anabolic steroids are used
illicitly for enhancing muscle growth and strength, boosting
physical activity or sports performance, and for aesthetic
purposes (Sagoe, Molde, Andreassen, Torsheim, & Pallesen,
2014). There are few circumstances in which anabolic steroids
are prescribed. Similarly, human growth hormone has limited
medical uses (Evans-Brown & McVeigh, 2009).
It is these muscular enhancement drugs, anabolic steroids
and associated substances that this paper will examine, and
take stock of the relative risks to the population. As our
understanding of the actions of these drugs and the potential
consequences of their self-directed use has become more
apparent over the last 20 years, we ask the question:
‘‘What are the public health implications of anabolic
steroids and associated drugs in 2016?’’
To assess the situation in the United Kingdom as it
currently stands, comparisons between the situation in 1995
and 2016 will be made. With the major changes in anabolic
steroid legislation occurring in 1996 (ACMD, 2010), it is an
appropriate timeframe to examine. The paper will review the
available evidence with relevance to the United Kingdom at
these two points in time in relation to drug related harms and
the practices employed by anabolic steroid users. This will be
supplemented by data from needle and syringe programmes in
the North West of England, for the year 1995 and 2015.
Background
The mid 1990’s
Anabolic steroids have long been associated with a range of
adverse effects, from the cosmetic and transient to the life-
threatening (ACMD, 2010). However, much of the data
relating to health harms are derived from case reports/series
and cross-sectional studies that are observational in nature
(Evans-Brown, Kimergard, & McVeigh, 2009). This led
Friedle (2000) to conclude that, based on the information
available, (with the exception of orally active anabolic
steroids) there was only limited evidence related to many of
the potential adverse consequences of anabolic steroid use.
This followed a detailed review of case reports of serious
illness and death amongst athletes with associated anabolic
steroid use. Between 1977 and 1995 relatively few cases were

 described, including several forms of cancer, myocardial
infarctions and rare cases of HIV. Cerebrovascular thrombosis
was singled out as a danger, with the 1980s and early 1990s
also witnessing the emergence of cardiomyopathy secondary
to anabolic steroids as a cause for concern (Ferenchick, 1996;
McKillop, Todd, & Ballantyne, 1986). The safe use of
testosterone as a male contraceptive provided a backdrop to
this relative lack of concern (WHO, 1990).
At this time, the main threat appeared to be from the 17-
alkylated anabolic steroids (these include oral anabolic
steroids such as, methandienone and oxymetholone, which
are still in common usage today, Hope et al., 2013) with cases
of acute liver toxicity resulting in serious damage. Cross-
sectional data indicated impaired liver function in some users,
but it was not long before even this was questioned due to the
difficulties in distinguishing between markers of hepatotox-
icity and markers of muscle damage secondary to high-levels
of resistance exercise (Dickerman, Pertusi, Zachariah, Dufour,
& McConathy, 1999).
Psychological harm and behaviour changes were cited as
concerns at this time. Increasing evidence from the USA, in
particular the work of Pope and colleagues (Pope, 1994; Pope
& Katz, 1992) illustrated the potential for psychological
harms. Wide ranging effects (Parrott, Choi, & Davies, 1994;
Perry & Hughes, 1992) including aggression (Su et al., 1993)
and
violence
(Choi
&
Pope,
1994;
Malone,
Dimeff,
Lombardo, & Barry Sample, 1995; Pope & Katz, 1990;
Schulte, Hall, & Boyer, 1993) associated with the use of
anabolic steroids were described in the literature. Interviews
with anabolic steroid users in the United Kingdom in the mid-
1990s revealed that 54% had experienced feelings of aggres-
sion (Lenehan, Bellis, & McVeigh, 1996) supporting the
earlier work by Korkia and Stimson (1993), with findings not
restricted to male users (Korkia, Lenehan, & McVeigh, 1996).
Our understanding of the knowledge and practices of
anabolic steroid users in the United Kingdom at that time
largely stemmed from the work of Korkia and Stimson (1993),
in which 110 steroid users were interviewed and the 386
interviews conducted in the North West of England by
Lenehan et al., (1996). While polypharmacy was common, it
was usually restricted to a small number of anabolic steroids
combined with drugs such as tamoxifen citrate and human
chorionic gonadotrophin to combat unwanted side effects.
The use of human growth hormone was rare amongst users of
anabolic steroids, at 2.7% in the United Kingdom study
(Korkia & Stimson, 1993) and 5.7% in the North West of
England study (Lenehan et al., 1996).
The main source of information for users of anabolic
steroids was the gym owner, followed by handbooks, (usually
from the United States) with the Anabolic Reference Guide
(Phillips, 1991) and the Underground Steroid Handbook II
(Duchaine, 1989) being particularly popular. The central role
of the gym owner was explored further with interviews
conducted with 64 gym owners across the North West of
England. Their main areas of concern related to the lack
of reliable information on anabolic steroids and the amount of
fake and counterfeit products on the market (McVeigh, 1996).
The former is of interest as the subsequent expansion of the
Internet would change beyond recognition, the amount of
information available to anabolic steroid users, although not
the central tenet of ‘‘reliable information’’. The latter is
interesting as this was an area of concern that was only just
emerging
within
the
academic
literature
(McVeigh
&
Lenehan, 1994; Musshoff, Daldrup, & Ritsch, 1997; Perry,
1995; Walters, Ayers, & Brown, 1990). A third issue of
concern raised by gym owners related to the use of anabolic
steroids by young people. Over three-quarters of gym owners
had observed increasing numbers of young males attending
their gyms, ‘‘. . .using anabolic steroids without any under-
standing of potential harms’’ (McVeigh & Lenehan, 1994).
It was this final issue, supported by data from studies in the
United Kingdom (Williamson, 1993), Canada (Melia, Pipe, &
Greenberg, 1996) and numerous studies from the United
States (including Buckley, 1988; DuRant, Escobedo, & Heath,
1995; Johnson, Jay, Shoup, & Rickert, 1989) that influenced
legislative changes, bringing anabolic steroids and associated
drugs under the control of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) in
the United Kingdom.
On 1st September 1996, anabolic steroids and a number of
associated drugs including growth hormones became con-
trolled under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971), following a
recommendation from the Advisory Council for the Misuse of
Drugs. Prior to the change in legislation, anabolic steroids
came under the jurisdiction of the Medicines Control Agency,
an arm of the Department of Health (ACMD, 2010). In April
2012, the phrase ‘‘medicinal product’’ was removed to reduce
ambiguity and import restrictions placed on buying anabolic
steroids and associated drugs from outside the United
Kingdom. Anyone wishing to import these drugs from outside
the United Kingdom is now required to do so in person
(sometimes referred to as ‘‘personal custody’’). These
changes were put in place in an attempt to curb the large
anabolic steroid online market. Personal possession of these
substances remains legal in the United Kingdom. However,
supply offences, including possession with intent to supply,
carry a maximum sentence of 14 years and/or an unlimited
fine (PHW, 2016).
2016
While there remains a significant gap in our knowledge and
understanding of anabolic steroids and associated drugs,
many of the conditions that were considered to have the
potential to cause adverse effects now have a much firmer
evidence base. Much of this work has been conducted in
North America, with contributions from Europe (in particular
the Nordic countries) and Australia and are summarised in the
Endocrine Society Scientific Statement (Pope et al., 2014).
The statement highlights a number of adverse effects of
anabolic steroids on various organs and systems of the body
including haematologic effects, hepatic, musculoskeletal,
renal, immunological and dermatological, together with
hormonal and metabolic effects. Perhaps the greatest concern
is reserved for the cardiovascular impact. Building on the
extensive catalogue of cardiac damage (Angell et al., 2012),
controlled studies have provided a greater understanding of
potential harm to the heart such as hypertrophy and electrical
instability (Baggish et al., 2010; Far, Agren, & Thiblin, 2012;
Krieg, Scharhag, Albers, Kindermann, & Urhausen, 2007).
Another

 psychiatric, neuropsychologic and behavioural impact of
anabolic steroids. The hypotheses of the mid 1990s have
subsequently been supported in work within the general
population and prison population (Klo
¨tz, Petersson, Hoffman,
& Thiblin, 2010; Lundholm, Ka
¨ll, Wallin, & Thiblin, 2010;
Pope,
Kouri,
&
Hudson,
2000).
There
remains
many
unanswered questions relating to aggression and violence
(Mazur, 2005) and the wider psychological effects of anabolic
steroids
including
anxiety,
depression
and
dependence.
However, there is some consensus, that for many, anabolic
steroids will have a relatively minor impact on behaviour and
mental health, but for some the consequences can be severe
(Pope et al., 2014). Even within the user population there are
contradiction and ambivalence (Kimergard, 2015; Monaghan,
2001). It also appears that the anabolic steroid regimes
employed (combinations and dosages), length of use, under-
lying psychological wellbeing and mental health, concomitant
use of recreational psychoactive drugs may all pay a part in
the extent of the adverse consequences of use.
There are several additional concerns, the extent of which
had not been fully recognised 20 years ago. They are not
pharmacological adverse effects and may even be considered
as ‘‘indirect effects’’, but from a public health perspective,
have major implications. They relate to the drugs market and
the method of administration respectively. The majority of
available anabolic steroids are illicitly manufactured (ACMD,
2010; Evans-Brown et al., 2009; Evans-Brown et al., 2012;
Graham et al., 2009; Kimergard, Breindahl, Hindersson, &
McVeigh, 2014). This is not unique to the United Kingdom
market (Cohen, Collins, Darkes, & Gwartney, 2007; Larance,
Degenhardt, Dillon, & Copeland, 2005; Parkinson & Evans,
2006; Striegel et al., 2006). Without the requisite quality
assurance of legitimate manufacture, products are often
contaminated with biological, chemical or foreign matter,
variable in strength or substituted with different active
ingredients. This has clear implications for health in relation
to infection, over-dosage and unexpected adverse conse-
quences (Thevis et al., 2008). This is not just an issue related
to anabolic steroids but effects all illicitly manufactured
image and performance enhancing drugs e.g. peptide hor-
mones
(Kimergard,
McVeigh,
Knutsson,
Breindahl,
&
Stensballe, 2014), growth hormone releasing
hormones
(Stensballe,
McVeigh,
Breindahl,
&
Kimergard,
2015),
melanotan II (Breindahl et al., 2015), 2,4-Dinitrophenol
(McVeigh, Germain, & Van Hout, 2016) and even dietary
supplements adulterated with anabolic steroids (Abbate et al.,
2015) or ancillary drugs such as tamoxifen (Evans-Brown,
Kimergard, McVeigh, Chandler, & Brandt, 2014).
A further concern is how the substances are used. While
polypharmacy has been the norm for in excess of 20 years in
the United Kingdom (Korkia & Stimson, 1993; Lenehan
et al., 1996; McBride, Williamson, & Petersen, 1996), there is
unprecedented availability of a vast array of substances, some
long established while others are still at the experimental
stage (Chandler & McVeigh, 2014; Hope et al., 2013;
McVeigh, Bates, & Chandler, 2015). This is not unique to
the United Kingdom but a global issue (Larance, Degenhardt,
Copeland, & Dillon, 2008; Parkinson & Evans, 2006; Sagoe
et al., 2015; Skarberg, Nyberg, & Engstrom, 2009). The most
dramatic change in the use of drugs in conjunction with
anabolic steroids, is the issue of human growth hormone.
Similarly to the findings of Parkinson and Evans (2006), the
United Kingdom, has experienced falling costs of producing
and purchasing human growth hormone. In the 1990s, growth
hormone was purchased between £6.58 and £20 per IU
(International Unit). By 2008, the price had fallen to £1.00–
£8.33 per IU (Evans-Brown & McVeigh, 2009). This has
resulted in 32% of current anabolic steroid users having used
human growth hormone in the previous year (Hope et al.,
2013).
In addition to these changes in relation to anabolic steroids
in the United Kingdom, a significant public health issue has
emerged. Until recently, HIV and other blood borne virus
prevalence and transmission was largely dismissed as a
marginal public health concern. Case reports of HIV amongst
users
of
anabolic
steroids
have
been
rare
(Henrion,
Mandelbrot, & Delfieu, 1992; Scott & Scott, 1989; Sklarek
et al., 1984), surveillance of injecting drug users has failed to
detect HIV amongst this population (Crampin et al., 1998)
and the identification of the sharing of injecting equipment
less common than amongst those who inject psychoactive
drugs both in the United Kingdom (Midgley et al., 2000) and
Australia (Iversen, Topp, Wand, & Maher, 2013; Larance
et al., 2008).
In 2013, the largest study of blood borne viruses in users of
anabolic
steroids
and
associated
drugs
was
published.
Samples from 395 men revealed that 1.5% had HIV, 9% had
antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and 5%
to hepatitis C (anti-HCV) (Hope et al., 2013). Furthermore,
36% reported having redness, swelling and tenderness in the
preceding year, and 6.8% had experienced an abscess or open
wound at an injection site at some point in the past (Hope
et al., 2015). Data from a subsequent survey (2012–2013),
together with historical data were analysed, demonstrating
that the blood borne virus prevalence among this population
of injectors has increased, and levels of HIV are now similar
to that amongst psychoactive drug injectors (Hope et al.,
2016).
It is within this context of increasing public health concern
regarding the use of anabolic steroids and associated drugs
that the needle and syringe programme (NSP) monitoring
system data at Liverpool John Moores University was
interrogated to identify the extent of anabolic steroid use
within the North West of England.
Methods
The NSP monitoring data from the years 1995 and 2015 were
extracted to provide an indication of the number of anabolic
steroid injectors accessing these services. There has been a
significant change to the NSP surveillance system during the
period between 1995 and 2015, however, the monitoring
principles remain the same. The earlier datasets were
collected in paper format and manually entered onto a
database, technological advances allowed for the latter
datasets
to
be
reported
directly
onto
the
Integrated
Monitoring System (IMS) via online submissions or shared
from services’ own data collection systems. The system
enables each transaction to be attributed to a specific
individual. The client provides an attributor code (entailing

 initials, date of birth and sex), together with data relating to
the drugs of injection enabling all subsequent visits and
details of transaction to be recorded and attributed. The use of
an attributor code such as this is now widely used within
monitoring and surveillance systems in relation to substance
use (for details on the Integrated Monitoring System see
Whitfield, Reed, Harrison, & McVeigh, 2015). Data for all
agency NSPs across Cheshire and Merseyside were analysed
using SPSS v22 for the years 1995 and 2015, respectively.
Figures were aggregated to Local Authority level (Cheshire,
Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Sefton, St Helens, Warrington
and the Wirral) and then further aggregated to provide totals
for Cheshire and Merseyside as a whole. Client records were
omitted if client’s date of birth was less than 10 years of age.
Table 1 breaks down the population data derived from
mid-1996 and mid-2014 with the age category 20–29 used to
calculate prevalence of steroid using NSP clients per 1000
population. For 2015, an additional measure of ‘‘all sources’’
was calculated. Not available in 1995, these figures relate to
the total number of individual anabolic steroid users attending
either agency NSP or pharmacy NSP. Further aggregation is
included to remove duplicates across the two data sources.
Table 2 relates to individual steroid using clients including the
total number of syringes provided to each individual user.
Results
Cheshire and Merseyside, with a total population of 2,430,284
(ONS, 2016) was served by 18 agency NSPs in 2015 and 17
agency NSPs in 1995. A total of 2446 individual steroid users
accessed agency needle and syringe programmes across
Cheshire and Merseyside in 2015 compared with 553 in
1995, representing a 342% increase over the period. Changes
were not uniform across the geography, with dramatic
increases
in
the
Local
Authorities
in
the
County
of
Cheshire, Halton (HAL) (2633%), Cheshire (1321%) and
Warrington (WAR) (703%). In the more urbanised County of
Merseyside, increase was pronounced but more modest, with
the central Local Authority of Liverpool (LIV), reporting a
decrease of 31%.
Data indicate that anabolic steroid use is most common in
the male age group of 20–29. This has been calculated for
both years, indicating an increase from 1.88 per 1000
population to 5.72 per 1000 population. There exists a wide
variation in the number of steroid users accessing NSPs per
1000 population in the Local Authorities, rising as high as
16.78 in St Helens (SHL) and 18.76 in Halton (HAL).
All steroid users (all sources) incorporates data from the
agency NSP and Pharmacy NSP and is only available for
2014/15. The pharmacy data were obtained from 84 shops
across Cheshire and Merseyside. Direct comparison of the
total of number of anabolic steroid users in 2015 (5336)
cannot be made with the agency only data of 1995 (553).
However, contemporary data from the mid-1990s indicates
that the vast majority of injecting equipment provided from
these outlets were suitable for intravenous injection only and
would not be suitable for intramuscular anabolic steroid
injection (Birtles & Bellis, 1997), therefore, enabling some
level of comparison. This would indicate an even more
dramatic increase in NSP provision for anabolic steroid users.
Although most Local Authorities experienced an increase in
anabolic steroid user totals with the inclusion of the additional
data source, the most dramatic increase occurred in Cheshire.
The majority of agency NSP clients in Cheshire and
Merseyside are injectors of anabolic steroids and associated
drugs. During the last 20 years, the percentage of steroid users
has risen from 17.1% to 54.9% and with males now
accounting for 98.6% of all steroid using clients compared
to 96.5% in 1995. The mean age of steroid using clients also
increased from 26 years old (median age of 25) in 1995
compared to 31 years old (median age of 30) in 2015. The
total number of syringes dispensed rose from 14,293 to
139,956, an increase of 879%. This is not just as a result of an
increased number of steroid users accessing NSPs, but
equates to more than a doubling of equipment per client.
Discussion
The last 20 years has witnessed significant changes in relation
to substance use in general, not least in relation to the use of

 human enhancement drugs (Evans-Brown et al., 2012).
Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the use of anabolic
steroids and associated drugs, the number and diversity of
drugs being used (Sagoe et al., 2015), the accompanying
psychoactive drug use (Hope et al., 2013) and the massive
dosages being used by even the most novice of users
(Chandler & McVeigh, 2014).
Increased research and opportunities to publish have seen
an unprecedented amount of peer reviewed papers published
on anabolic steroid use. In a basic search of academic papers
using CINAHL, PsychINFO, Social Sciences Citations Index
and Medline for relevant papers on the use of anabolic
steroids and associated drugs, 95 unique references were
generated for 1995 compared with 397 for 2015. While this
is partly as a result of the expansion of the Internet, still the
majority of steroid users access their information from non-
academic sources on the Web (Kimergard & McVeigh,
2014). The academic literature has provided a greatly
improved understanding of the potential adverse effects of
anabolic steroids and a range of associated drugs (Pope et
al., 2014) and this will continue to improve as anabolic
steroid users mature and the longer term impact of high
levels of sustained drug use can be ascertained. The above
issues are compounded by the fact that the vast majority of
available products are manufactured illicitly or without due
oversight in relation to ‘‘quality, safety and efficacy’’
(MHRA, 2007) undermining the further development of
the evidence base and basic harm reduction messages related
to the specific substances and dosages (Evans-Brown et al.,
2009).
The identification of HIV within this population is a
significant concern. While we are unable to identify if the
transmission is due to the sharing of anabolic steroid injecting
equipment, sharing of equipment linked with previous (or
current) psychoactive drug injection, sexual transmission or a
combination of all these routes, the fact that it is established
within the population, at the same level of that seen in
psychoactive drug injectors has profound public health
implications (Hope et al., 2013; Hope et al., 2015).
Clearly, to ascertain the extent of a potential public health
issue, an estimate of the prevalence or at least an indication of
the scale of the particular activity is required. We have some
indication of prevalence of anabolic steroid use, Sagoe et al,
estimated that the global lifetime prevalence for anabolic
steroids is 3.3% with higher levels across Europe (Sagoe,
Molde, Andreassen, Torsheim, & Pallesen, 2014). The Crime
Survey for England and Wales (2014/15) suggests much lower
levels of 0.9%, although a statistically significant rise over the
previous decade, with �73,000 having used in the previous
year (ONS, 2015). The Crime Survey for England and Wales
is generally accepted to be a considerable underestimation of
anabolic steroid use (ACMD, 2010; Bates, Jones, & McVeigh,
2014). Previously published work has provided an indication
as to the extent of anabolic steroid users at NSPs, in the
geography examined here (McVeigh, Beynon, & Bellis,
2003a; ACMD, 2010) and across the wider United Kingdom
(Kimergard & McVeigh, 2014c). This is however, the first
time that a comparison over a prolonged period has taken
place. The data illustrate a startling increase in the number of
anabolic steroid users accessing NSPs. This cannot be used as
a true proxy for changes in the prevalence of anabolic steroid
use, as it may reflect an increased proportion of anabolic
steroid users presenting to these services. This may be at least
partially countered by the increased number of syringes being
dispensed. It is long established that many steroid users in the
United Kingdom will be provided with injecting equipment
for other users of anabolic steroids (Korkia & Stimson, 1993,
Lenehan et al., 1996; Cullen, Hope, Parry, & Ncube, 2015)
with this practice recognised by National Institute for Health
& Care Excellence (NICE, 2014) and mirrored in Australia
(Dunn, McKay, & Iversen, 2014). While there have been
changes over time in relation to the number and frequency of
injections, we suggest that the 139,956 syringes provided by
agency NSPs alone (this does not include the equipment
dispensed from pharmacy NSPs or purchased online) is an
indication of a large and growing population of anabolic
steroid users.
It is of interest to consider the different patterns of change
across the Local Authorities. Increases are by no means
uniform, with stark contrast between the urban area of
Liverpool to the more rural and affluent Cheshire. The
inclusion of pharmacy data confirms that the different
situation in Liverpool is not masked by a migration from
one type of NSP to another. We hypothesise that this may at
least partly be explained by a diffusion of high levels of
anabolic steroid use from the central Liverpool area in the
mid-1990s to the outer areas of Cheshire and Merseyside over
the last 20 years.
While the origins of the diffusion theory can be traced
back to the early 1900s (De Tarde, 1903), it is Rogers’
Diffusion of Innovation (Rogers 1983) and its application to
drug use behaviour (Rogers, 1995) that support this explan-
ation. Golub, Johnson, and Dunlap, (2005) describe a
complex interaction of culture and individualism with drug
use being an active decision where the ‘‘setting’’ (Zinberg,
1984) is the main influence. The ‘‘trickle down’’ effect of
innovators and early adopters may explain the later adoption
of high levels of anabolic steroid use occurring in the central
urban section of the geographical area, spreading to the
suburban/rural areas over time. This has similarities to
previous phenomena
that
took
place
in
Cheshire
and
Merseyside during the 1980s in relation to heroin use and
the 1990s, in which the adoption of crack cocaine could be
traced as emanating in Central Liverpool before expanding its
reach across the region (McVeigh, Hughes, Hounsome, &
Bellis, 2003b).
There is a lack of evidence based interventions in relation
to anabolic steroids. Currently, there are no formal academic
evaluations of harm reduction, treatment or prevention
interventions in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, there is
scant evidence internationally (Backhouse et al., 2014). While
prevention programmes such as ‘‘Hercules’’ appear promis-
ing (implementation of a theoretical learning base and
practical strength training sessions, Sagoe et al, 2016) in
relation to positive changes in knowledge, similarly to other
programmes, we do not have evidence of longer term positive
behaviour change (Elliot et al., 2008; Fritz et al., 2005;
Goldberg et al., 2007; Jalilian, Allahverdipour, Moeini, &
Moghimbeigi, 2011; Nilsson, Allebeck, Marklund, Baigi, &
Fridlund, 2004). With evidence of a range of serious health

 harms, not least the identification of HIV within the
population, and indications of increasing prevalence, public
health cannot wait for effective prevention interventions to be
established and the need for a comprehensive harm reduction
approach is required. Whilst the data here show an increasing
number of anabolic steroid injectors attending needle and
syringe programmes, it is recognised that this represents only
a subset of this population and greater engagement efforts
need to be made through outreach to gyms and other
environments where anabolic steroid use is likely to be
found (such as the night-time environment and occupations
where size, strength or appearance are highly valued).
Conclusion
Clearly, there have been significant changes in our under-
standing of anabolic steroid use together with the extent and
practices of the users themselves. The recent identification of
HIV within the population, the quality and safety of the illicit
products being used, together with the established physical
and psychological harms are causes for concern. The NSP
surveillance system in Cheshire & Merseyside provides
evidence for the extent of anabolic steroid use, a phenomenon
that is believed to be replicated across the United Kingdom
and beyond. Detailed work is required relating to the causes
and drivers of this situation, the risk behaviours of the
individuals, the nature of the illicit market and role of the
Internet together with the development of (cost) effective
demand and harm reduction.
Limitations
The paper is set within a United Kingdom context and while
some themes will be transferrable to other countries, the
specifics related to legislation, service provision and to some
extent cultural background, limits the extent to which it is
generalisable. Furthermore, the extent to which Cheshire and
Merseyside is representative of the United Kingdom as a
whole remains unknown, therefore, there is a clear need for
further research and surveillance within this particular
population across wider geographies and over time. The
literature reviews relating to the mid-1990s and 2015 are not
systematic with potential bias towards work by the authors
due to the nature and geography of their work. The data
relating to the attendance at needle and syringe programmes
is self-reported surveillance in nature with some differences
in data collection methods (paper compared to electronic). We
have no reason to believe that this would in any way skew the
findings.
