ABSTRACT
Background. Complete cytoreductive surgery with hyper-
thermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS ? HIPEC) is
increasingly performed on patients with peritoneal carcino-
matosis of various origins. Splenectomy often is required in
these patients to achieve complete tumor removal. Although
splenectomy has been associated with increased morbidity in
many major abdominal surgeries, its effect in patients
undergoing CRS ? HIPEC is unknown. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the impact of splenectomy during
CRS ? HIPEC on postoperative outcomes.
Methods. We retrospectively identified 39 patients who
underwent CRS ? HIPEC with splenectomy during a 3-
year study period from a prospective database. We com-
pared them to case controls (CRS ? HIPEC without
splenectomy) that were matched for the complexity of the
procedure. We evaluated the complication rate and out-
comes of patients in each group.
Results. During the study period, splenectomy was per-
formed in 32 % of patients undergoing CRS ? HIPEC
procedure. Patients in the splenectomy group experienced
more grade 3–4 complications than patients in the control
group (59 vs. 35.9 %, p = 0.041) as well as more pul-
monary
complications
(41
vs.
7.7 %,
p = 0.0006).
Multivariate analysis identified splenectomy as the only
predictor of overall major complications (odds ratio =
2.57, 95 % confidence interval = 1.03–6.40). Mortality
was similar in both groups.
Conclusions. Splenectomy increases major complication
rate in patients undergoing CRS ? HIPEC and efforts
should be made to preserve the spleen during the surgery.
Complete
cytoreductive
surgery
with
hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS ? HIPEC) is becom-
ing the standard surgical treatment for patients with
peritoneal carcinomatosis of various origins.1–4 This pro-
cedure often requires multiple intra-abdominal resections
and is associated with morbidity rates in experienced
centers varying from 12 to 52 %, depending on the extent
of the surgery.5,6
During complete cytoreduction procedure, splenectomy
often is performed due to carcinomatosis involvement of
the spleen or iatrogenic trauma during left diaphragmatic
peritonectomy or left colon resection. It has been shown
that unplanned splenectomy during other surgical proce-
dures, such as gastrointestinal and vascular surgery,
increases the number of postoperative complications.7,8
Splenectomy also reduces long-term survival in patients
undergoing
colorectal
resection
for
malignancy
and
increases the risk of developing different types of solid and
hematologic cancers during long-term follow-up.9,10 The
added morbidity of a splenectomy during the complicated
and extensive surgical treatment that is CRS ? HIPEC is
unknown.

 The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-
term complications and the morbidity related to an added
splenectomy, incidental or required, during a CRS ? HI-
PEC procedure.
METHODS
We analyzed all patients who underwent CRS ? HIPEC
at our institution between July 2007 and July 2010 from a
prospectively collected database. Institutional review board
approval was obtained. Patients who had a splenectomy
during their cytoreductive procedure were identified. A
case control group of similar patients, without splenec-
tomy, was selected from the same database. Patients of the
control group were matched for the performance of gas-
trectomy,
left
pancreatectomy,
and
right
and
left
diaphragmatic peritonectomy. The mean PCI was collected
for both groups.
Demographic data, tumor characteristics, extent of
peritoneal disease, operative details, and postoperative
outcomes were extracted from the database as well as a
complementary review of the medical records and the
operative reports. Patients were dichotomized depending
on
the
extent
of
their
disease:
low
tumor
burden
(PCI B 10) or high tumor burden (PCI [ 10) and the
extent of resection: limited (0–3 resection procedures) or
extensive (4 or more resection procedures).
Postoperative complications were extracted from the
database, and a single investigator reviewed every medical
record to ensure that no complications were missed. Post-
operative complications were classified according to the
NIH Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events

 v4.0 (CTCAE) as: minor morbidity (grade 1/2), major
morbidity (grade 3/4), or mortality (grade 5). Only major
morbidity and mortality were analyzed. The grade 3/4
infectious complications that were analyzed were anasto-
motic
leaks
or
abscesses
necessitating
drainage
or
reoperation,
septic
shock,
and
pulmonary
infections
necessitating ICU stay and/or mechanical ventilation.
Major abdominal complications included intra-abdominal
collections, abscesses, or anastomotic leaks requiring
drainage or reoperation. Major pulmonary complications
were defined as pleural effusion requiring drainage or
pneumonia requiring ICU stay and/or mechanical ventila-
tion. Thirty-day mortality and in-hospital mortality were
recorded.
Statistics
The SAS� 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical
software was used for analyses. Descriptive results were
expressed as number (percentage) or mean ± standard
deviation (SD). McNemar and paired Student t test were
used for initial characteristics comparison and Chi square
analysis was used for unpaired data (or Fisher exact test
when conditions for Chi square were not fulfilled). Uni-
variate analysis for complications was performed using
logistic regression. Multivariate analyses were done using a
stepwise logistic regression model. The significance level
was set at 0.05.
RESULTS
During the study period, a total of 190 patients diag-
nosed
with
peritoneal
carcinomatosis
underwent
a
CRS ? HIPEC procedure, using a standardized closed
HIPEC technique described in previous studies.11 Of these
patients, 61 (32 %) required a splenectomy due to tumor
involvement or iatrogenic injuries. These injuries occurred
mainly during left diaphragmatic peritonectomy, gastrec-
tomy, or left colectomy. Because splenectomy patients
more often required gastrectomy, pancreatectomy, or
diaphragmatic peritonectomy than controls, the splenec-
tomy population was reduced to 39 patients to achieve
comparable groups with the controls. Thirty-nine controls
without splenectomy, matched to the characteristics of the
subject group, were identified. Demographics, primary
tumor sites, and surgical details of the subjects and the
controls are presented in Table 1.
The two groups had similar primary tumors origin and
PCI as well as CCR in both groups were comparable. There
was no difference in the type and number of resection
procedures between the two groups. The mean operative
time was 308 ± 82 min in the splenectomy group com-
pared with 280 ± 77 min in the nonsplenectomy group
(p = 0.099).
Overall, 37 patients experienced a grade 3 or 4 com-
plication (47.4 %). The complication rate was higher in the
splenectomy group versus the control group [23 patients
(59 %) vs. 14 patients (35.9 %), p = 0.041], and this result
was statistically significant (Table 2). The number of pul-
monary complications was significantly greater in the
splenectomy group (41 vs. 7.7 %, p = 0.0006). Abdominal
and infectious complications were similar in both groups
(35.9 vs. 23.1 %, p = 0.214, and
30.8 vs. 25.6 %,
p = 0.615). There was no difference in mortality between
the two groups. The most common abdominal complica-
tions in the splenectomy group were left upper quadrant
abscess, anastomotic leaks, and pancreatic fistulas, and the

 most common pulmonary complications were pleural

(Table 3).
In the univariate analysis, splenectomy was significantly
associated with overall grade 3 and 4 complications
(p = 0.043). Mean PCI and categorized PCI (B10 and
[
10) were not significantly associated with overall com-
plications, neither was the mean number of resections.
Splenectomy and the mean number of resections were
associated
with
severe
pulmonary
complications
(p = 0.002 and p = 0.015 respectively). In the multivari-
ate analysis, performance of a splenectomy was the only
predictor of overall grade 3 or 4 complications with an
odds ratio of 2.57 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.03–6.4;
Table 4), whereas splenectomy and a number of resection
greater than 3 were associated with severe pulmonary
complications with an odds ratio of 9.53 (95 % CI 2.38–
38.18) and 3.62 (95 % CI 1.08–12.09), respectively.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, splenectomy was performed in
32 % of the patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis who
underwent CRS ? HIPEC procedures. The main reason
cited for required splenectomy was tumor implants on the
spleen. To lower this number, tumoral involvement should

 be assessed intraoperatively. Spleen preservation can be
possible when there is only a minor or a peripheral
involvement, especially in mucinous tumors. Partial spleen
capsulectomy can be performed safely for limited neo-
plastic
disease
(Fig. 1).
To
accurately
visualize
the
posterior aspect of the spleen and to ensure that it is tumor-
free, the posterior peritoneum can be transected. This
maneuver may allow a better mobilization of the spleen
and an easier removal of tumorous disease, if needed, while
allowing adequate hemostatic control.
Another common cause of splenectomy during cytore-
ductive surgery is iatrogenic injury to the spleen. Inferior
pole avulsion can occur during mobilization of the left
colonic angle or when traction is applied on the greater
omentum during complete omentectomy, which is rou-
tinely performed in a CRS ? HIPEC procedure. Limiting
traction on the omentum and placing laparotomy pads
behind the spleen during the omentectomy can greatly
minimize the risks of splenic capsule avulsion during the
surgery. To maximize the chances of spleen conservation,
special care also needs to be taken during left diaphrag-
matic peritonectomy. Division of the posterior splenic
attachments may facilitate this procedure.
This study shows that the addition of a splenectomy to
an
already
long
and
complex
procedure,
such
as
CRS ? HIPEC, significantly increases the risk of major
postoperative morbidity. This was already well described
in major vascular and digestive surgeries. Eaton et al.
showed an increase in infectious complications, from 18 to
65 %, due to unplanned splenectomy during vascular pro-
cedures.7 Mettke et al. demonstrated an increase in overall
morbidity from 36.5 to 47.2 % following incidental
splenectomy during surgery for colorectal cancer, whereas
Aminian et al. showed an increase in anastomotic leaks
following
esophagectomy
when
a
splenectomy
was
required.8,12 To our knowledge, this is the first study to
evaluate the consequences of a splenectomy during a
CRS ? HIPEC procedure. Major complications occurred
in 59 % of the patients who underwent splenectomy
compared with 35.9 % in the control group. Left upper
quadrant abscess occurred frequently in the splenectomy
group. Pulmonary effusions requiring drainage occurred in
more than one out of four patients in this group.
Galizia et al. had similar results while comparing total
gastrectomy
with
D1 ? lymphadenectomy
(without
splenectomy) and classical D2 lymphadenectomy (with
splenectomy).13 Patients who underwent splenectomy had
a postoperative morbidity rate of 48 % compared with
19 % in the D1? group. The splenectomy group had more
pulmonary and pancreatic complications and more intra-
abdominal abscesses. They also noted a mortality rate of
5.4 % in the D2 group compared with 0 % in the D1?
group.
Postoperative mortality rates following CRS ? HIPEC
procedures in expert centers have been shown to be
between 0.9 and 5.8 %.5,14 In this study, the overall mor-
tality rate was 6.5 %, with two postoperative deaths in the
splenectomy group (5.1 %) and three postoperative deaths
in the control group (7.9 %). This difference was not sta-
tistically significant.
The main limitation of this study is the retrospective
case–control design. Potential biases were minimized by
the data being extracted from a prospective database that
included all patients operated for CRS ? HIPEC at our
institution during the study period. Among all of the
patients, those requiring a splenectomy had longer and
more extensive cytoreductive surgeries and a higher num-
ber of resections with more gastrectomy, pancreatectomy,
and diaphragmatic peritonectomies. To balance for this
difference, a control group of similar patients matched for
gastrectomy, left pancreatectomy, as well as right and left
diaphragmatic peritonectomy was selected. Unfortunately,
this matching process only allowed us to perform data
analysis on 39 patients with splenectomy and 39 controls to
reduce the bias of more extensive upper abdominal surg-
eries that was present on control-matching for all 61

 splenectomy patients. The extent of the surgery was sig-
nificant in both groups with 48 % of patients having four or
more resections, which is considered a major cytoreductive
surgery. This may explain the relatively high morbidity and
mortality levels obtained in this study. The homogeneity of
the groups in regards to the extent of the surgery may
explain why we were not able to demonstrate a significant
association between the number of resections and overall
postoperative complications. Also, with each group con-
taining only 39 patients, our study might lack statistical
power to identify weaker associations. Despite these limi-
tations, this study is the first in-depth assessment of
postoperative morbidity associated with splenectomy in the
setting of a CRS ? HIPEC procedure.
CONCLUSIONS
Splenectomy performed during a CRS ? HIPEC pro-
cedure significantly increases postoperative complications,
mainly because of a higher incidence in pulmonary com-
plications. Care should be taken to avoid iatrogenic injuries
to the spleen during dissection of the left upper quadrant.
Splenic conservation should be encouraged and minimal
tumoral involvement of the spleen, especially when sparing
the hilum, should be addressed by partial capsulectomy.
