SUMMARY
Monoamine
and
acetylcholine
neurotransmitters
from the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulate
insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. The molecular
mechanisms controlling neurotransmitter signaling
in islet b cells and their impact on diabetes develop-
ment are only partially understood. Using a glucose-
intolerant, MafA-deficient mouse model, we demon-
strate that MAFA controls ANS-mediated insulin
secretion by activating the transcription of nicotinic
(ChrnB2 and ChrnB4) and adrenergic (Adra2A) re-
ceptor genes, which are integral parts of acetylcho-
line- and monoamine-signaling pathways. We show
that acetylcholine-mediated insulin secretion re-
quires nicotinic signaling and that nicotinic receptor
expression is positively correlated with insulin secre-
tion and glycemic control in human donor islets.
Moreover, polymorphisms spanning MAFA-binding
regions within the human CHRNB4 gene are asso-
ciated with type 2 diabetes. Our data show that
MAFA transcriptional activity is required for estab-
lishing b cell sensitivity to neurotransmitter signaling
and identify nicotinic signaling as a modulator of in-
sulin secretion impaired in type 2 diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
Glucose homeostasis is maintained by hormone secretion from
the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Insulin secreted by islet
b cells promotes glucose uptake, whereas glucagon from a cells
stimulates glucose release. Loss, dysfunction, and dedifferenti-
ation of islet b cells results in a profound imbalance in blood
glucose homeostasis (Halban et al., 2014), leading to the devel-
opment of type 2 diabetes. Regulation of physiological insulin
and glucagon secretion is achieved by direct sensing of glucose
and other nutrients in a and b cells but also indirectly through
communication between islet cells and the sympathetic and
parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system
(ANS) (reviewed in Thorens, 2011). Glucose-sensing neurons
stimulate sympathetic norepinephrine release to repress insulin
secretion and promote glucagon release under physical and
mental stress conditions (Porte and Williams, 1966). In contrast,
parasympathetic acetylcholine signaling through cholinergic
muscarinic receptors is critical for the pre-absorptive phase of
insulin secretion, prior to the increase in blood glucose levels
in response to food intake (Ahre
´ n and Holst, 2001). Alleles that
increase the risk of type 2 diabetes have been identified in the
adrenoceptor ADRA2A (Rosengren et al., 2010) and the cholin-
ergic muscarinic receptor CHRM3 genes (Guo et al., 2006),
further highlighting the importance of neurotransmitter signaling
in glucose homeostasis.
The transcription network regulating neurotransmitter signaling
pathways in pancreatic b cells is unknown, making it difficult to
assess how sensitivity to neurotransmitter signaling is maintained
and adjusted in response to changing physiological conditions.
The b cell-enriched MAFA transcription factor activates genes
critical for glucose sensing, insulin production, and secretion
(Artner et al., 2010; Hang et al., 2014), and it has been established
that MAFA expression is lost in human type 2 diabetes islets most
likely contributing to diabetic b cell dysfunction (Guo et al., 2013).
Here, we show that b-cell-specific deletion of the MafA tran-
scription factor in a mouse model, which develops glucose intol-
erance, leads to a complete loss of insulin secretion in response
to stimulation of the ANS in vivo. We show that this defect is
most likely caused by MAFA activating transcription of adrenergic
and nicotinic neurotransmitter receptor expression including
genes encoding CHRNB2 and B4 subunits and ADRA2A. Impor-
tantly, this transcriptional regulation by MAFA was conserved
between mouse and human b cells. In addition, polymorphisms
in nicotinic receptor genes correlated to insulin secretion and
type 2 diabetes in a large cohort of patients. These findings estab-
lish MAFA as a critical regulator of neurotransmitter signaling

 in b cells and identify nicotinic signaling as a modulator of
insulin secretion, suggesting that smoking-induced nicotine
exposure may directly affect insulin secretion, thereby linking
the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and smoking
on a cellular level.
RESULTS
Islet b-Cell-Specific Deletion of MafA Results in
Impaired ANS-Stimulated Insulin Secretion
Loss of MafA results in adult b cell dysfunction, which leads to
glucose intolerance (Zhang et al., 2005; Figures S1A and S1B).
To test whether loss of MafA affects the responsiveness of b cells
to neurotransmitter signaling, mice wild-type for MafA (MafAWT),
completely lacking MafA (MafA�/�), and only lacking MafA in
b cells (MafARIP) were treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG),
which stimulates the ANS to induce insulin and glucagon secre-
tion (Karlsson et al., 1987). Both MafA�/� and MafARIP animals
failed to increase insulin secretion in response to 2DG (Figures
1A and 1B), whereas insulin secretion increased in MafAWT
mice, as expected (Figures 1A and 1B), and glucose was cleared
(Figure 1C). By contrast, no difference in glucagon secretion
levels was found between MafARIP and wild-type animals treated
with 2DG (Figure 1D), suggesting that loss of MafA selectively
affects ANS-driven insulin secretion.
We found that the reduction of insulin secretion was due to
loss of MafA in MafARIP b cells, as no changes in the expression
levels of MafA in the brainstem, hypothalamus, or cortex (Fig-
ure 1E) were found. In fact, in the CNS, MafA mRNA levels
were 500 times lower than in pancreatic islets and no protein
expression was detected (Figure 1E; data not shown), which
suggests that MafA function in b cells, and not the CNS, is critical
for ANS-driven insulin secretion. MafARIP mice also did not ex-
press the closely related transcription factor MafB in b cells (Fig-
ures 1F and 1G), which has been shown to partially compensate
for the loss of MafA (Artner et al., 2010). In addition, there was no
reduction in b cell area (Figure 1H), a cell number (Figure 1I), or
alterations in islet morphology (Figures 1F, 1G, S1C, and S1D)
in MafARIP mice, although such reduction has been previously
reported for MafA�/� mice (Zhang et al., 2005). Moreover, islet
innervation seemed to be unaffected in MafARIP mice, as shown
by the presence of autonomic nerve fibers (Figures 1K, 1J, and
S1E–S1H) and 2DG-induced glucagon secretion in MafARIP ani-
mals (Figure 1D). These findings suggest that the effects
observed in MafARIP are specific to the loss of MAFA function
in b cells and not due to reduced b cell area, altered islet
morphology, or ectopic MAFB expression. Taken together, our
data show that MAFA function in b cells is essential for ANS-
driven insulin secretion.
Expression of Adrenergic and Cholinergic Nicotinic
Receptor Genes Is Affected in MafARIP Islets
Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve endings secret norepi-
nephrine, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides to signal to target
cells. Signal reception is mediated by adrenergic (sympathetic
nervous
system),
muscarinic,
and
nicotinic
acetylcholine
and neuropeptide receptors (parasympathetic nervous system),
whereas monoamine degradation is performed by several en-
zymes including monoamine oxidases (MAOs). As alterations
in adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as parasympa-
thetic neuropeptide receptor expression, affect human and
rodent b cell function (Guo et al., 2006; Rosengren et al., 2010;
Winzell and Ahre
´ n, 2007), we performed mRNA expression
analysis to determine whether loss of ANS-mediated insulin
secretion in MafARIP mice was due to deficient neurotransmitter
signaling. Expression of the parasympathetic neuropeptide
receptor genes VipR, PACAPR, and GrpR was unchanged in
MafARIP mutant islets (Table 1), suggesting that neuropeptide
receptor signaling is not affected in MafARIP. Expression of
the muscarinic receptor genes ChrM3 and ChrM5 has been
observed in b cells (Duttaroy et al., 2004; Molina et al., 2014),
and in line with this, we found that ChrM3 transcript levels
were detectable in MafARIP islets and similar to expression
in MafA wild-type littermates (Table 1). In contrast, ChrM1,
ChrM2, ChrM4, and ChrM5 transcript levels were low in both
wild-type and MafARIP islets. Systematic expression analysis of
nicotinic a and b receptor subunits (Chrn genes), which form
pentameric ion channels consisting of two a and three b sub-
units, showed that several a (CHRNA3, CHRNA4, and CHRNA5)
and b (CHRNB2 and CHRNB4) subunits were produced in islet
cells (Figure 2A). mRNA levels of ChrnA3 and ChrnA4 genes
were increased, whereas ChrnB2 expression was unchanged
and ChrnA5 and ChrnB4 subunit transcript levels were reduced
in MafARIP islets (Figure 2A). Western blot analysis demonstrated
that these changes in expression levels were also present on
protein level (Figure 2B). Expression of other CHRN subunits
was low and unchanged in MafARIP islets compared with
MafAWT islets (Table 1). Moreover, transcript levels of MaoB,
the main MAO enzyme expressed in islets (Table 1), were
reduced, whereas expression of the adrenoceptor Adra2A,
which inhibits insulin secretion, was elevated in MafARIP islets
(Table 1; Figure 2C). This expression analysis shows that loss
of MafA in b cells selectively affects expression of nicotinic
acetylcholine and adrenergic receptor, as well as MAO genes.
The sympathetic nervous system inhibits insulin secretion
through ADRA2A signaling in islet b cells. However, ADRA2A is
also expressed in presynaptic nerve endings as part of a nega-
tive feedback loop terminating adrenergic signaling. Previous
studies have established that localized accumulation of norepi-
nephrine can lead to upregulation of Adra2A expression in nerve
endings presynaptically (Gilsbach et al., 2006). MafARIP islets
lack expression of the monoamine-oxidizing enzyme MAOB
(Table 1), which mediates degradation of norepinephrine locally.
Thus, we hypothesized that the increase in Adra2A expression
observed in MafARIP islets may be due to an increased expres-
sion in islet-associated synapses and not in the islet cells them-
selves. To determine whether the increase in Adra2A expression
occurred in islet cells or islet-associated nerves, islets were
cultured to degrade severed nerve fibers and the effect on tran-
script and protein levels was measured. We found that Adra2A
transcript and protein levels were decreased in cultured MafARIP
islets, albeit changes were only significant on the protein level
(Figure 2D), indicating that the enhanced Adra2A expression
observed in freshly isolated MafARIP islets originated from nerve
endings, whereas Adra2A transcription was reduced specifically
in islet cells. In support of this, ADRA2A protein expression was
1992
Cell Reports 14, 1991–2002, March 1, 2016 ª2016 The Authors
 also reduced in MafARIP islets (Figures 2E and 2F). Our data sug-
gest that MAFA is required for Adra2A expression in islet b cells
whereas elevation of norepinephrine levels in MafARIP mutant
islets (due to the lack of MAOB) results in upregulation of Adra2A
in presynaptic nerve fibers associated with pancreatic islets.
Chrn Gene Expression Depends on MAFA in Mouse
Pancreatic b Cells
We have shown that MafARIP animals lack insulin secretion
in response to autonomic stimulation but that transcription
of muscarinic
receptor
genes,
which
mediate
autonomic
stimulation of insulin secretion, is not reduced in MafARIP islets
(Table 1). These findings suggest that alternate cholinergic
signaling pathways might be present in b cells. As we also
observed that expression of some Chrn genes changed in
MafARIP islets, we next investigated whether expression of these
genes is regulated by MAFA.
The CHRNA4 protein was detected in all islet cells by immu-
nohistochemistry, with production enhanced in MafARIP islets
(Figures 3A and 3B). By contrast, CHRNA5 (Figure 3C) and B4
(Figure 3G) were detected in all pancreatic cell types, whereas
CHRNB2 was predominantly expressed in b cells (Figure 3E) of
MafAWT islets. CHRNA3 protein was not detected by immuno-
histochemistry. Expression of CHRNA5, CHRNB2, and CHRNB4
was reduced in MafARIP islets (Figures 3D, 3F, and 3H), suggest-
ing that a reduced amount of functional ion channels (A3/B4 and
A4/B2) is present, which could affect nicotinic channel signaling
in MafARIP b cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis

 demonstrated that MAFA selectively bound to upstream regula-
tory sequences in ChrnB2 and ChrnB4, but not ChrnA3 and
ChrnA4, genes (Figure 3I) indicating that only ChrnB2 and
ChrnB4 are directly regulated by MAFA. The ability of co-trans-
fected MAFA to stimulate ChrnB2- or ChrnB4-driven reporter ac-
tivity (Figure 3J) and reduction of ChrnB4 transcript levels upon
siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAFA in bTC-6 cells (Figure 3K)
provided additional strong support for direct activation of Chrn
genes in mouse b cells. In summary, these data show that nico-
tinic subunits are expressed in mouse islets and that MAFA is
directly activating expression of ChrnB2 and ChrnB4.
CHRN Activity Modulates Acetylcholine-Mediated
Insulin Secretion
Acetylcholine promotes insulin secretion through activation of
muscarinic receptors (reviewed in Ahre
´ n, 2000), whereas the
role of nicotinic signaling in this process has been considered
to be minor (Ohtani et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011b;
Yoshikawa et al., 2005). We wanted to investigate whether the
MAFA-regulated Chrn activity contributes to acetylcholine-stim-
ulated insulin release. Thus, dynamic insulin secretion studies on
islets from MafAWT and MafARIP mice were conducted. Nicotine
exposure (which selectively stimulates CHRN) resulted in a tran-
sient decrease in insulin secretion in wild-type, but not MafARIP,
islets (Figure 3L). Next, a combined treatment with nicotine and
the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine was performed to deter-
mine the effect of a simultaneous stimulation of nicotinic and
muscarinic receptor activity, which resembles the physiological
response to acetylcholine. This treatment caused a biphasic in-
sulin response consisting of an initial reduction in insulin release
that is then followed by a phase of enhanced insulin secretion in
wild-type and MafARIP islets (Figure 3L). However, nicotine and
oxotremorine stimulation of insulin release from MafARIP islets
was muted (Figure 3L), which is most likely caused by the selec-
tive reduction in nicotinic receptor gene expression. In contrast,
stimulation of muscarinic receptors was comparable between
wild-type and MafARIP islets (Figure 3L), suggesting that CHRN
expression in b cells is promoting acetylcholine-mediated insulin
secretion. Stimulation of wild-type islets with acetylcholine
resulted in a similar biphasic insulin secretion (Figure 3M), as
observed for nicotine and oxotremorine treatment, suggesting
that activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors is required
for physiological insulin secretion. The presence of a biphasic
synergistic response to stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic
receptors supports the idea that activation of fast-acting nico-
tinic ion channels is temporarily inhibiting insulin secretion to
prime b cells for muscarinic-receptor-induced insulin secretion.
Genetic Variants in the CHRNB4 Gene Correlate with
Islet Expression and Type 2 Diabetes Susceptibility in
Humans
The expression and functional analysis of MafARIP mice suggest
that Chrn genes are critical for b cell function in rodent islets. To
evaluate whether expression of Chrn genes in islets is also crit-
ical for human b cell function, an expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTL) analysis of 89 human islet samples (Fadista et al.,
2014) was performed to see whether there were any SNPs in
CHRN genes that are associated with islet expression, glucose
clearance, and type 2 diabetes. We identified a cluster of SNPs
that was associated with low expression of CHRNB4 (Figure 4A).
Specifically, two copies of the alternate allele (T/T) for the
CHRNB4 SNP rs12910237 resulted in a significant reduction of
CHRNB4 transcript levels (Figure 4B). Moreover, this SNP was
also associated with patients having high fasted blood glucose
levels and low insulin secretion after an oral glucose challenge
in the MAGIC and DIAGRAM databases (Table 2). The SNP
was not associated with change in BMI, indicating that this
polymorphism does not affect overall food intake and energy
expenditure. These results identify SNPs in the CHRNB4
gene that are associated with type 2 diabetes and indicate
that reduced expression in pancreatic islets, which may impair
nicotinic signaling in b cells, is correlated with glucose clearance
in humans.
The sequences spanning the CHRNB4 SNPs are located
upstream of the CHRNB4 transcription start site. Analysis of po-
tential b-cell-transcription-factor-binding sites and published
data on human pancreatic islet enhancers (Pasquali et al.,
2014) showed that the CHRNB4 SNPs are contained within
an enhancer region associated with b cell transcription factor

The CHRNB4 upstream region is transcriptionally active in b cell
lines as assessed by reporter gene activity (Figures 4C and S4A).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that SNPs that affect
susceptibility to type 2 diabetes are located in a transcriptional
control region of the CHRNB4 gene.
MAFA Is Critical for Expression of Nicotinic and
Adrenergic Receptors, Including CHRNB2, CHRNB4,
and ADRA2A, in Human b Cells
Our biochemical and reporter gene data suggest that MAFA
directly regulates the nicotinic receptor CHRNB4 gene in mouse
and human islet b cells. However, human b cells produce both
MAFA and MAFB, whereas mice only express MafA (Dai et al.,
2012). Thus, we performed an analysis of the correlation be-
tween expression of nicotinic and adrenergic receptor genes
and expression of MAFA and MAFB. Analysis of islet RNA-seq
data collected from human donors (n = 131) showed that
MAFA and MAFB expression were strongly correlated with
each other (Figure S3A) and moderately correlated with low
HbA1c levels (Figures S3B and S3C), a measure of long-term
blood glucose levels. Both factors were significantly correlated
with ADRA2A (Figures S3D and S3E; strong correlation of
MAFA with ADRA2A), CHRNB2 (Figures 4D and 4E; strong cor-
relation), and CHRNB4 (Figures 4H and 4I; weak to moderate
correlation) transcript levels, but not with other nicotinic recep-
tor subunits (Figures S3G–S3O). Importantly, CHRNB2 and
CHRNB4 were also positively correlated with insulin secretion
as assessed by insulin stimulatory index (SI) (Figures 4G and
4K; moderate correlation) and low levels of glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c; Figures 4F and 4J; moderate correlation). By contrast,
CHRNA3, CHRNA4, and CHRNA5 transcript levels were not
linked to glycemic control or insulin secretion (Figures S3I,
S3L, S3O, and S4E–S4G). These correlation studies suggest
that high expression levels of CHRNB4 and CHRNB2 genes
are critical to insulin secretion and long-term blood glucose
control not only in mice but also humans.
To determine whether MAFA directly regulates nicotinic and
adrenergic receptor gene expression in human cells, MAFA
siRNA knockdown was performed in human EndoC-bH1 cells.
This human b cell line expresses unique markers associated
with human b cell function and secretes insulin in a glucose-
responsive manner (Ravassard et al., 2011). Following 50%
knockdown of MAFA, ADRA2A, CHRNB2, and CHRNB4 tran-
script levels were reduced (20%–30% reduction; p % 0.05; Fig-
ure 4L), demonstrating that regulation of these genes by MAFA is
conserved in human b cells. Additional support for this conclu-
sion was obtained by the finding that human CHRNB4 control
sequences spanning the identified type 2 diabetes SNPs (Fig-
ure 4C) were bound and activated by MAFA in transfection
assays in non-b cell lines (Figure 4M). Mutations of predicted
MAFA-binding sites (Figure S4B) within these sequences re-
sulted in reduced activation by MafA, and reporter constructs
containing the alternate allele of the diabetes-associated SNP
rs922691 had reduced transcriptional activity upon co-transfec-
tion with MAFA (Figure 4M). These findings suggest that SNPs in
the upstream region of CHRNB4, which are associated with type
2 diabetes and reduced gene expression, are located within a
gene region controlling expression and that MAFA is critical for
islet-specific expression of CHRNB4.
DISCUSSION
Animal studies have established that MafA promotes the
glucose-sensing and proliferative properties of islet b cells (Art-
ner et al., 2010; Hang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2005). Here,
we demonstrate that MAFA is essential for the transcription of
acetylcholine- and monoamine-signaling genes in mouse and
human b cells. These results show that MAFA is key in regulating
b cell function by connecting the physiological insulin secretion
response to nutrients with neurotransmitter signaling. When
these processes are impaired in islets lacking MAFA, glucose
homeostasis is disrupted and type 2 diabetes develops (Figure 1;
Guo et al., 2013).
The finding that stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous
system with 2DG results in insulin secretion in wild-type, but
not MafA�/� and MafARIP, animals indicates that this transcrip-
tion factor is essential for initiating ANS-driven insulin secretion.
Other possible explanations are unlikely, as the RIP-Cre mouse
line used here (Herrera, 2000) does not contain the human
growth hormone minigene, which has been associated with
numerous b cell defects (Brouwers et al., 2014). Moreover,
RIP-Cre activity in the CNS does not alter MafA transcript levels,
and changes in islet innervation and ANS-induced glucagon
secretion were not observed. So, we conclude that the defects
in autonomic signal reception observed in the MafA mutant
animals are caused by loss of MAFA function in islet b cells.
We found that MAFA regulated specific neurotransmitter
signaling genes in the sympathetic branch of the ANS, including
the adrenergic receptor Adra2A as well as the monoamine
metabolizing enzyme MaoB. Islet cells express receptor and
transporter proteins for norepinephrine, a monoamine neuro-
transmitter reported to have a negative effect on insulin secretion
(reviewed in Ahre
´ n, 2000). Our results suggest a direct effect of
MAFA activity on Adra2A transcription, because ADRA2A
expression was reduced following knockdown of MAFA in
a human b cell line. By contrast, MAOB expression, which was
reduced in MafARIP islets, was not associated with human
MAFA activation in EndoC-bH1 (Figure S4G), suggesting that
MAFA only regulates MaoB expression in the mouse (Ganic
et al., 2015). The regulation of Adra2A expression indicates
that MAFA controls autonomic input of the sympathetic, as
well as the parasympathetic, branch of the ANS.
Gene expression analysis showed that MafA regulates the
expression of several genes that are critical for autonomic
signaling. The main group of neurotransmitter receptor genes
that are transcriptionally regulated by MAFA encode subunits
of the cholinergic nicotinic receptors. Acetylcholine from islet a
cells (human) and parasympathetic nerves (mouse and human)
has been shown to stimulate the pre-absorptive phase of insulin
secretion (Ahre
´ n and Holst, 2001; Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011a,
2011b). The importance of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
in this process has been established in both human and animals
studies. However, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity was
previously thought to not be significantly involved in this process
(Gautam et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011b). This is in

 contrast to previous findings that pre-absorptive insulin secre-
tion is inhibited by the nicotinic ganglionic blocker trimethaphan
but only partially impaired by muscarinic antagonists (Ahre
´ n and
Holst, 2001), which argues for a function of nicotinic receptor ac-
tivity in human islet cells. Our insulin secretion studies extended
these previous observations by showing that nicotine has a
dynamic impact on insulin release with transient inhibition of in-
sulin secretion. In addition, co-stimulation with nicotine and ox-
otremorine, which activates muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
signaling, resulted in synergistic insulin secretion similar to that
observed upon stimulation with acetylcholine (Figure 3L). This
suggests that the physiological acetylcholine response in b cells
consists of an initial opening of nicotinic channels that primes b
cells for subsequent muscarinic receptor activity. In support of
this conclusion, MafA mutant islets that had reduced expression
of nicotinic, but not muscarinic, acetylcholine receptor expres-
sion showed neither transient inhibition of insulin secretion
upon nicotine exposure nor synergistic insulin secretion in
response to treatment with nicotine and oxotremorine.
To establish whether nicotinic receptors are also required for
human b cell function and whether MAFA transcription factor ac-
tivity is regulating CHRN transcription, we analyzed RNA-seq
and genotyping data from human donor islets. We established
a positive correlation between CHRNB2, CHRNB4, MAFA,
and MAFB transcript levels, insulin secretion, and glucose clear-
ance, further supporting a critical role for nicotinic receptors in
b cell function. Importantly, MAFA controlled nicotinic receptor
CHRNB2 and CHRNB4 gene transcription in human EndoC-
bH1 cells, suggesting that the transcriptional control of mouse
and human nicotinic receptor genes is conserved. The CHRNB4
upstream enhancer region contained several SNPs critical for
islet CHRNB4 transcript levels, insulin secretion after an oral
glucose challenge, and type 2 diabetes, further linking the tran-
scriptional control sequences of nicotinic receptors with the ge-
netics of type 2 diabetes. This islet-specific enhancer contained
binding sites for several islet-enriched transcriptional regulators,
NKX6.1, NKX2.2, and MAFB (Pasquali et al., 2014). Mutations
in this MAF-binding site, as well as in the adjacent type 2

 diabetes-associated SNP rs922691 showed a reduction in
MAFA transactivation potential, demonstrating that MAFA con-
tributes to the transcriptional regulation of CHRNB4 and sug-
gests that loss of MAFA and/or MAFB in type 2 diabetic islets
may result in compromised CHRNB4 expression and subse-
quently CHRN activity, thus contributing to the b cell dysfunction
observed (Guo et al., 2013).
We have identified a role for CHRN genes in b cell function, in-
sulin secretion, and human type 2 diabetes. Previous studies
have shown that nicotine addiction, specifically smoking, ele-
vates the risk to develop type 2 diabetes by 40% (Willi et al.,
2007). This has been partially attributed to nicotine’s effect on in-
sulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues but also to the induction of b
cell apoptosis (reviewed in Xie et al., 2009). Here, we show that
nicotinic signaling also directly modulates acetylcholine-medi-
ated insulin secretion. Thus, nicotine exposure may directly
affect the b cell’s ability to respond to endogenous acetylcholine
signaling, as chronic stimulation of CHRN proteins leads to re-
ceptor desensitization (Alkondon et al., 2000). However, targeted
activation of nicotinic signaling in specific CHRNB4 risk allele
carriers could also provide beneficial cues to improve b cell
function.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Models and Cell Lines
The MafAfl/fl, MafA�/�, and RIP (rat insulin promoter)-cre mouse lines have
been previously described (Artner et al., 2010; Herrera, 2000). The RIP-Cre
mouse line does not contain the human growth hormone minigene, which is
in contrast to other commonly used pancreas-specific Cre deleter lines, which
exhibit defects associated with the ectopic expression of human growth hor-
mone in islets (Brouwers et al., 2014). Islet-b-cell-specific deletion of MafA
(MafARIP) resulted in complete loss of MAFA expression (Figures S1C and
S1D), impaired glucose clearance after an intraperitoneal glucose challenge
(Figures S1A and S1B), and reduced expression of MAFA target genes
Slc2a2, Slc30a8, Pdx1, and Insulin2 (Table S1). Mice were maintained on a
mixed C57BL/6 and Sv129 background. HEK293 and the mouse b (b-TC6)
cell lines were used for luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays as indicated.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis with MafAWT and MafARIP islets was performed as
previously described (Rosengren et al., 2010). Primary antibodies were
a-CHRNB2 antibody (1:200; no. ANC-012; Alomone Labs), a-ADRA2A anti-
body (1:500; no. A271; Sigma-Aldrich), a-CHRNA5 antibody (1:400; no.
NBP1-69122; Novus Biologicals), a-CHRNA4 antibody (1:500; no. ANC-004;
Alomone Labs), a-CHRNB4 antibody (1:500; no. ANC-014; Alomone Labs),
and monoclonal mouse a-bactin antibody (1:2,000; Sigma). Secondary anti-
bodies were goat a-rabbit IgG (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology) and goat
anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Dako). Signals were visualized using SuperSignal
West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and Chemi-
Doc MP system (Bio-Rad).
Immunohistochemistry
Pancreata from 2- to 3-month-old wild-type and mutant mice were processed
for paraffin and frozen sections. Immunohistochemical analysis was per-
formed as described previously (Matsuoka et al., 2003). The primary anti-
bodies used were guinea pig a-insulin (1:2,000; Dako), mouse a-glucagon
(1:2,000; Sigma), rabbit a-MAFA (1:5,000; Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit
a-MAFB (1:1,000; Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit a-CHRN-A4, A5, B2, and B4
(1:100; Alomone Labs), goat a-ADRA2A (1:100; Sigma), rabbit a-ADRA2A,
rabbit a-TH (1:1,000; Sigma), goat a-VAChT (1:1,000; Millipore), and rabbit
a-b-tubulin (1:5,000; Covance). The specificity of primary nicotinic receptor
antibodies was assessed using absorption assays (Figure S2). Secondary an-
tibodies used were Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5- conjugated a-guinea pig, a-mouse,
a-goat, and a-rabbit (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclear counter-
staining was performed using DAPI (1:6,000; Invitrogen).
Image Analysis and Quantification
Immunofluorescence images were obtained using Zeiss 780 confocal micro-
scope and Zen software or Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging and AxioVision Rel 4.9
software (Zeiss); the latter was used for quantification of b cell area and a
cell number. Immunohistochemistry and quantifications are based on four
wild-type and MafA mutant pancreata. b cell area and a cell number were as-
sessed by quantifying the pancreatic-, glucagon-, and insulin-stained area in
sections at a 720-mm interval throughout the entire pancreatic organ. Mean dif-
ferences were tested using the Student’s t test.
IPGTT
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed on 2-month-old
MafAWT and MafARIP mice after a 12-hr fasting period. Fasted blood glucose
levels were measured with a handheld glucometer (OneTouch; Lifescan) prior
to an intraperitoneal injection of 2 g glucose/kg body weight. Blood glucose
was measured at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection. Samples
were analyzed using a multiple t test.
Intravenous 2DG Insulin Secretion Measurement
2DG-stimulated insulin secretion assays were performed on random fed
2-month-old MafAWT and MafARIP animals using an injection of 0.5 g 2DG/kg
body weight. Blood was collected from an incision in the distal part of the tail.
Measurements were taken at 0, 1, 5, 20, 30, and 50 min after 2DG administra-
tion. Blood was collected into heparin-coated tubes (Sarstedt), and the serum
fractions were analyzed with a mouse insulin ELISA (Mercodia) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were analyzed using a multiple t test.
Glucagon Secretion Measurements
Two-month-old wild-type and MafARIP mice were intraperitoneally injected
with saline solution or 0.5 g 2DG/kg body weight. Blood samples were
collected 0 and 30 min after injection into heparin-coated tubes. Samples
were chilled immediately and centrifuged at 4�C. Plasma aliquots were stored
at �20�C. Glucagon concentrations were determined using glucagon ELISA
(Mercodia). Statistical analysis was conducted using Student’s t test.
Islet Isolation and RNA Extraction
Two-month wild-type and mutant pancreatic islets were isolated as previously
described (Johansson et al., 2010), and brainstem, cortex, and hypothalamus
samples were dissected from 2-month-old wild-type and mutant brains. For
removal of nerve fibers, islets were cultured overnight (indicated in respective
figure). Islet and brain RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN),
and RNA quality was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Samples with a
RNAintegritygreaterthansevenwere furtheranalyzed,andRNAconcentrations
were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop).
Reverse Transcription and Real-Time qPCR
Reverse transcription was carried out with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions using 100 ng RNA/sample. For real-time
qPCR, cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and all assays were performed with
Fast SYBR Green Master Mix on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are available upon request. Forma-
tion of expected PCR products was confirmed by agarose melting curve anal-
ysis, and brain stem RNA samples were used as a positive control for neuro-
transmitter receptor expression. Gene expression data were normalized
against expression of the internal control gene hypoxanthine-guanine phos-
phoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and b actin. Experiments were repeated for at
least four wild-type and mutant mice, each in duplicate. The data are shown
as mean expression with SEM and were analyzed with a multiple t test.
Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
Sequences of interest were cloned from mouse genomic DNA and human DNA
derived from risk and non-risk allele carriers into the pGL2basic (Promega) or
2000
Cell Reports 14, 1991–2002, March 1, 2016 ª2016 The Authors
 pFOX (Raum et al., 2010) luciferase vector as indicated (primer sequences are
presented in Table S2 and the location of the control sequences is indicated in
Figures 4C, S4I, and S4J). Luciferase reporter assays were performed in
HEK293 or b-TC6 cells as described (Mazur et al., 2013). Exogenous MafA pro-
tein was overexpressed using a pCMV MafA construct. Transient transfection
of all plasmids was performed using Metafectene Pro (Biontex Laboratories).
Empty vector transfections were used as controls where indicated. The data
are mean expression with SEM and were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey
multiple comparison tests.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
The b-TC6 cell line was maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(PEST) (Invitrogen). Upon reaching 90% confluence, cells were harvested
and chromatin was prepared (Mazur et al., 2013). For assessment of MAFA
binding to sequences containing rs922691 risk and non-risk alleles, b-TC6
cells were transfected with specific human CHRNB4 reporter constructs and
myc-tagged MAFA, as indicated, and chromatin was prepared 3 days after
transfection. Protein/DNA chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated
with mouse anti-MAFA antibody (Bethyl Labs) or mouse IgG (Jackson Immu-
noResearch) as previously described (Mazur et al., 2013). Enrichment was
assessed by qPCR and is presented as percent input. Primer sequences are
presented in Table S2; location of ChIP amplicons is shown in Figures 4C,
S4I, and S4J.
In Vitro Islet Perifusion
Islets from MafAWT and MafARIP mice were isolated by collagenase digestion
and handpicked under a stereomicroscope. Islets were incubated overnight in
DMEM containing 4.5 g/l D-glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
PEST. The next day, islets were loaded into perifusion chambers (50 islets/
chamber; Brandel). Islets were perifused in a secretion buffer (10% SAB-
10X, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, and 2% w/v albumin
[pH 7.4]) containing low (2.8 mM) or stimulatory (10 mM) concentrations of
glucose with 1 or 10 mM acetylcholine, 100 mM nicotine, 100 mM oxotremorine,
a combination of both, or 25 mM KCl. Fractions of perifusate were collected
every 4th minute, and insulin was measured in each fraction using insulin ELISA
(Mercodia).
RNA-Seq, eQTL, and Gene Co-expression Analysis of Human Islets
Islets from 131 cadaver donors of European ancestry were provided by the
Nordic Islet Transplantation Program and processed for RNA-seq (see Fadista
et al., 2014 and Taneera et al., 2012 for GEO accession codes). Raw counts
were normalized using trimmed mean of M-values and log2-transformed cor-
relation coefficients, and p values were calculated using Graphpad Prism. The
eQTL analysis was done as previously described (Fadista et al., 2014) using
islets from 89 cadaver donors. Cis-eQTLs were calculated between gene
expression levels and all SNPs within 250 kb of each gene. A linear model
adjusting for age and sex, as implemented in the R Matrix eQTL package (Sha-
balin, 2012), was used. Significance was assessed by filtering out eQTLs that
did not pass false discovery rate <1% threshold and 10,000 permutations.
Insulin SI
Human islet insulin secretion was measured on a column during the dynamic
glucose perifusion as described previously (Goto et al., 2004). Insulin content
in the effluent was collected in 6-min intervals and quantified using human
insulin ELISA (Mercodia). SI was defined as the ratio between the areas
under the curves calculated for low (1.67 mM) and high (16.7 mM) glucose
concentrations.
siRNA-Mediated MAFA Knockdown in the EndoC-bH1 Cell Line and
bTC-6 Cells
Knockdown of MAFA in EndoC-bH1 (Ravassard et al., 2011) cells was
achieved using the TARGETplus siRNA pool against human MAFA (no.
L-027343-01). Briefly, 2 3 106 cells were transfected with siRNA (50 pmol)
or a non-targeting control (no. D001810) using the Dharmafect no. 1 reagent
(GE Dharmacon no. T-2001) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was
harvested 72 hr post-transfection and isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Tech-
nologies) and the DNA-Free RNA Kit (Zymo Research). The iScript cDNA
synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used for cDNA synthesis, and qPCR reactions
were performed on a LightCycler 480 II (Roche) and analyzed by the DDCT
method.
Knockdown of MafA or control sequences in bTC-6 cells was performed us-
ing 30 nM MAFA RNAi oligonucleotides (no. s196287; Thermo Scientific) or
negative control no. 1 (Thermo Scientific) with transfection reagent (Dharma-
fect; Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was extracted after 72 hr transfection,
and qPCR was performed as described above.
Knockdown of MAFA resulted in a 50% reduction of the MAFA transcript
and protein levels (data not shown).
