Abstract 
Background: Rates of self-harm and suicide are increasing in young people. The literature 
suggests that individuals who identify with alternative subcultures (e.g. Goth) may be at a 
greater risk. Objective: To explore the prevalence of self-harm and suicide in alternative 
subcultures and the factors that might contribute to this increased risk. Method: Using a 
systematic strategy, the databases PsycINFO, Scopus, MEDLINE and Web of Science and 
the E-Thesis online service (ETHOS) were searched for English language only papers, with 
no restrictions in terms of date of publication. Papers were selected that included data on the 
relationship between either alternative subculture identity (e.g. Goth) or preference for 
alternative music (e.g. Heavy Metal) and self-harm or suicide. Ten quantitative papers were 
included; seven cross-sectional, two longitudinal and one cross-sectional state level 
comparison study. Two qualitative papers were also included. Studies were assessed by two 
reviewers for risk of bias Results: The findings indicated that individuals who associated 
with alternative subcultures were at a greater risk of self-harm and suicide. Whilst qualitative 
papers identified potential mechanisms (e.g. exposure to self-harm and the way self-harm is 
presented or normalised) there remains limited support for these mechanisms. Conclusions: 
More research is required to understand the association between self-harm, suicide and 
alternative subculture affiliation, and the factors underlying it. Longitudinal studies and 
studies focusing on mechanism are particularly important. 
Keywords: Alternative subculture, heavy metal, self-harm, suicide, systematic review, Goth

Practitioner points 
 The review supports the suggestion that those who identify as belonging to an 
alternative subculture may be at a higher risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour. It 
also presents preliminary evidence that alternative affiliation predicts self-harm over 
time, and that this effect holds whilst adjusting for a number of likely confounders.  
 The findings highlight the importance of increasing the awareness of the victimisation 
and potential risk that these groups hold and suggests areas for intervention in health, 
educational and social services.   
 The review does not, however, indicate specifically what it is about alternative 
subculture affiliation (or alternative music preference) that could contribute to the risk 
of self-harm. Consequently, studies with a greater focus on mechanisms are needed.  
 Methodological limitations (e.g. cross-sectional studies, small sample of ‘alternative’ 
participants, westernised samples) restricted the reliability and validity of the results 
which impacted on the extent to which the findings could be generalised more widely.

Introduction 
 
Suicide and self-harm are global public health concerns (Chan et al., 2016), with over 
778,000 deaths by suicide recorded worldwide in 2015 (World Health Organisation; WHO, 
2017). Suicide is also a leading cause of death in adolescents (Hawton, Saunders, & 
O’Connor, 2012) and the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds (WHO, 2017). 
Self-harm is one of the greatest predictors of death by suicide in adolescents (Brent, 
McMakin, Kennard, Goldstein, Mayes, & Douaihy, 2013; Hawton & Harriss, 2007), 
increasing the risk by up to 10-fold (Ougrin, Tranah, Stahl, Moran, & Asarnow, 2015). Self-
harm can also lead to accidental death (Kehrberg, 1997). It has been reported that alternative 
subcultures may be at an increased risk of self-harm and suicide, though this is also often 
considered a myth (Liverpool CAMHS, 2016; Mental Health Foundation, 2017). The current 
review aims to clarify the association between affiliation with alternative subcultures and 
self-harm or suicide. 
 
Self-harm can be defined as any intentional “act of self-poisoning or self-injury 
carried out by a person, irrespective of their motivation” including self-poisoning or 
self-injury by cutting (NICE, 2013). Behaviours that fall under this term include Non-
Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI; deliberate self-harm without the desire to die) and suicidal 
behaviours or attempts (self-injurious behaviours with some intent to end life; Nock, 2010; 
Nock, Borges, Bromet, Cha, Kessler, & Lee, 2008). Self-harm is a common cause for 
hospital admissions, with over 300,000 people attending hospital each year in the UK 
(Clements, Turnbull, & Hawton  et al., 2016) and between 300,000 and 420,000 people 
visiting emergency departments in the US yearly for self-inflicted injuries (Owens, Barrett, 
Gibson, Andrews, Weinick, & Mutter, 2010). Adolescents appear to be a group who are 
particularly vulnerable to self-harm with 30,000 adolescents in the UK receiving hospital 
treatment each year for this purpose (Hawton, Rodham, & Evans, 2006).

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS, 2012) developed a 
National Strategy for Suicide Prevention which identified ‘high risk’ groups for self-harm, 
including ethnic minorities (e.g. South Asian Women) and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender individuals (LGBT; Al-Sharifi, Krynicki, & Upthegrove, 2015; Baldwin & 
Griffiths, 2009; Bhui, McKenzie, & Rasul, 2007). Alternative subcultures or social groups 
may be another high-risk group for self-harm and suicide (Rutledge, Rimer, & Scott, 2008). 
These individuals have a set of group-specific values and can be identified by distinctive 
styles and tastes to include clothing and music preference. Some recognised alternative 
groups include Goths, Emos and Punks (Greater Manchester Police; GMP, 2013). The 
observation of increased self-harm and suicide in such groups has been apparent in the media 
in recent years, specifically in relation to ‘Goth’ subculture (Bazian, 2015; Cooper, 2015; 
Curtis & Carvel, 2005). However, recent clinical guidance and self-help information has 
suggested this association is a myth (Liverpool CAMHS, 2016; Mental Health Foundation, 
2017). The lack of available evidence makes it difficult to confirm or challenge these reports. 
 
There are several plausible theoretical pathways to explain the observed link between 
alternative subculture affiliation and increased risk of self-harm and/or suicide. One possible 
explanation is that alternative subculture affiliation leads to self-harm, due to increased 
exposure to additional risk factors, for example victimisation, stigma and hate crime (e.g. 
verbal and physical aggression; Garland & Hodkinson, 2014). This may contribute to 
‘minority stress’ which in turn may reflect the elevated rates of self-harm in these groups 
(Young, Sproeber, Groschwitz, Preiss, & Plener, 2014). People may then self-harm as way of 
coping with such stress (Nixon, Cloutier, & Aggarwal, 2002). An example of this 
victimisation is the social stigma and aggression faced by Sophie Lancaster in 2007, when 
she was murdered by a group of young males due to her affiliation with Goth culture (Bowes 
et al., 2015).  
  
 
6 
 
 
A second explanation is that self-harm may lead to alternative subculture affiliation, 
in that individuals choose to identify with the subculture based on their own experiences 
(Young, Sweeting, & West, 2006; Arnett, 1996). Young people who are vulnerable to low 
mood and self-harm may be attracted to groups with peers of similar difficulties who validate 
their experiences through music lyrics (Arnett, 1991; Bowes et al., 2015; Martin, Clarke, & 
Pearce, 1993; Young et al., 2006; Young et al., 2014). This theory implies that a vulnerability 
to self-harm and suicide may be the cause of alternative subculture affiliation rather than a 
consequence. This vulnerability may have been created through earlier exposure to adversity, 
such as trauma, neglect, isolative environments or bereavements (Arnett, 1996; Healthcare 
Quality Improvement Partnership; HQIP, 2016).  
 
A final explanation is that alternative subculture affiliation leads to self-harm due to 
the behaviour being modelled by peers or icons, for example music groups or bands (Young 
et al., 2014). The media may have played a role in reinforcing this message, but it has also 
influenced the public perception of alternative subcultures and the links with risk behaviours. 
For example, there has been widespread public concern about the possibility that song lyrics 
may promote self-harm and suicide (Stack, Gundlach, & Reeves, 1994) which has led to 
efforts from parents to promote the use of warning labels on certain types of music (Stack et 
al., 1994). Furthermore, parents bereaved by suicide have accused Heavy Metal groups of 
promoting suicidal behaviours and have proceeded to sue musicians (Martin et al., 1993). 
Modelling of peers and advertisement from the media may contribute to the risk behaviours 
becoming a normative component of such cultures leading to ‘social contagion’, increasing 
self-harm within those who identify with such groups (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011; Young et 
al., 2006).  
 
There is a cited idea in both research and the media (Bazian, 2015; Cooper, 2015; 
Curtis & Carvel, 2005) that there is a link between self-harm, suicide and identification with 
  
 
7 
 
an alternative subculture or having a preference for such music. However, the literature has 
not yet been systematically reviewed. This systematic review aims to clarify the relationship 
between both people who self-identify as being a part of an alternative subculture and/or 
those who have a preference for an alternative style of music (e.g. Heavy Metal, Goth) and 
the occurrence of self-harm and/or suicide. Whilst alternative subculture affiliation may 
extend beyond musical preferences, music preference remains a key indicator of affiliation.  
Method 
Search Strategy 
 
A protocol for this review was pre-registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016045402). 
The inclusion of qualitative research reflects a departure from protocol, but was made to 
allow a better exploration of mechanisms linking subculture affiliation and self-harm. The 
electronic databases PsycINFO, Scopus, MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched from 
the earliest date to December 2017 using the following key subject terms, identified from 
scoping searches: “self injur*” OR “self-injurious behav*” OR “self harm*” OR self-harm 
OR NSSI OR DSH OR “self mutil*” OR “non-suicidal self-injury*” OR “non-suicidal self-
injury disorder” OR “self-cut*” OR “self destruct*”  OR suicide* AND goth* OR emo OR 
punk OR subculture* OR “adolescent identity” OR metal* OR “heavy metal*” OR 
“alternative adolescent subculture” OR “alternative culture” OR “youth subculture*” OR 
“social group”. Additional controlled vocabulary searches were completed for MEDLINE  
(self-mutilation OR suicide OR self-injurious behaviour OR suicidal ideation OR attempted 
suicide OR poisoning  AND social identification) and PsycINFO  (self-injurious behaviour 
OR self-mutilation OR suicide OR attempted suicide OR self-destructive behaviour AND 
social groups OR social identity) and the E-thesis online service (ETHOS) was searched 
using general key terms (self-harm OR suicide) to capture any additional unpublished theses. 
  
 
8 
 
The reference lists of included papers were manually searched for any additional papers of 
relevance and corresponding authors of included papers contacted to enquire about any 
unpublished potentially eligible research.  
 
Screening of data was completed in parallel by two reviewers using the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. A third reviewer clarified any uncertainties. This procedure consisted of 
firstly screening the titles and abstracts, followed by the full texts.  
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
 
We included both quantitative and qualitative research studies but applied different 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. For quantitative research, studies were included that a) 
presented new research data, b) included a measure of affiliation to an alternative subculture 
or of preference for alternative music genres, c) measured self-harm or suicide, and d) were 
English-language. For qualitative research, studies were included that a) presented new 
research data, b) sourced qualitative data (e.g. via interview or through secondary sources 
such as internet forum posts) pertaining to affiliation to an alternative subculture or of 
preference for alternative music genres, c) sourced qualitative data pertaining to self-harm or 
suicide, and d) were English-language. Case studies were excluded as our interest was on 
sample-level themes and trends. Alternative subculture affiliation was defined as: 
A strong sense of collective identity and a set of group-specific values and tastes. This 
typically centres on distinctive style, clothing, make up, body art and music 
preference. Those involved usually stand out to both fellow participants and to those 
outside the group. Groups typically under the ‘alternative’ umbrella include Goths, 
Emos, Punks and Metallers (Greater Manchester Police, 2013, para. 2). 
Adding to this definition, the current review included those who had expressed a preference 
for ‘alternative’ music, broadly defined as genres that have moved away from or define 
themselves as distinct from ‘mainstream’ musical genres, including Metal, Punk, Goth or 
  
 
9 
 
genres otherwise referred to as alternative. Studies where specific numbers or details of 
alternative subculture affiliation were not described were excluded.  
 
Due to potential difficulties with synthesising evidence from qualitative and 
quantitative approaches (Dixon-Woods, Agarwal, Jones, Young, & Sutton, 2005) we provide 
a narrative synthesis of these two bodies of research separately. We then contrast and 
compare the common themes and generate over-arching conclusions within the Discussion. 
Risk of Bias  
 
Quantitative studies that were selected for inclusion were assessed for risk of bias, 
independently by two raters, using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
assessment tool that has been used for observational research (Williams et al., 2010). This 
tool was designed to be adapted to the specific context of the research being reviewed, and 
has previously been used in systematic reviews of self-harm research (Taylor, Hutton, & 
Wood, 2014). The tool covers nine domains representing different risks of bias. Each domain 
is graded as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘partial’ or ‘cannot tell’. For qualitative studies, quality of the 
research (the term “bias” does not necessarily apply to qualitative research and so has not 
been used here) was assessed by applying the Medical Journal of Australia guidelines for 
quality assessment in qualitative research (Kitto, Chesters & Grbich, 2008). Ratings against 
the six domains outlined in these guidelines were made independently by two raters. As with 
quantitative studies, each domain is graded as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘partial’ or ‘cannot tell’ 
Results 
Quantitative Studies 
Summary of Included Papers 
 
 Ten papers were selected for inclusion; nine from published journals and one an 
unpublished thesis (O’Connor, 2015). A summary of the study characteristics is presented in 
Table 1. Seven of the studies were cross-sectional, two longitudinal, and one a cross-sectional 
  
 
10 
 
state-level comparison. Most of the studies focused on adolescents and young adults from the 
ages of 14 – 24 years, with one exception which included an additional older age group of 24 
– 35 years (Stack et al., 1994). Six of the samples were from student populations. Eight of the 
ten studies focused on self-harm, one considered both self-harm and NSSI (Young et al., 
2014) and one study focused on completed suicide (Stack et al., 1994). 
Risk of Bias 
 
The outcomes of the risk of bias assessment, measured by an adapted AHRQ, are 
presented in Table 2. Recurrent methodological problems included an absence of power 
calculations to justify sample size; little information or acknowledgement of the handling of 
missing data; lack of detail concerning sample characteristics, recruitment methodology and 
the use of student samples. Lack of sample size justification may mean results are under 
powered. This is less of a concern for seven of the studies which had large sample sizes (n = 
241 to 3694), though the remaining three may be at risk of type II errors, failing to detect 
actual effects (Burge et al., 2010; Lester & Whipple, 1996; Scheel & Westefeld, 1999). 
Missing data could create bias depending on how it was handled and the nature of it, 
particularly if it was missing not at random (MNAR; Sterne et al., 2009). For example, in this 
context, people with greater self-harm may have been less likely to provide data on self-harm. 
Six studies used student samples either from secondary schools or universities where 
opportunistic sampling (e.g. completing the study in regular classes or a single school) may 
have created further biases (Burge et al., 2010; Lacourse et al., 2001; Lester & Whipple, 
1996; Martin et al., 1993; Scheel & Westefeld, 1999; Young et al., 2014).   
 
Five studies did not use full validated tools to measure the outcome of self-harm. In 
many cases, this took the form of using a single question adapted from a longer measure, 
which may lack content validity and reliability (Hom, Joiner, Bernert, & Joiner, 2016). 
  
 
11 
 
Similarly, six studies used partially validated or non-validated methods to measure subculture 
affiliation. Six of the ten studies attempted to control for confounding variables in the 
analysis, with only four of these adequately controlling for both demographic variables and 
potential predictors or correlates of self-harm. It is important to control for such confounding 
variables to obtain accurate parameter estimates of the association between alternative 
subculture affiliation and self-harm.  
Alternative Subculture Affiliation 
 
Of the four studies that focused on alternative subculture affiliation, alll studies found 
a significant association between alternative subculture affiliation and self-harm (See Table 
1). Two studies were longitudinal in design. However, Young and colleagues (2006) 
employed a cross-sectional analysis (i.e. did not focus on the change in variables over time). 
Therefore, we can only infer a direction of effect from one study (Bowes et al., 2015). This 
study found that participants who affiliated heavily with an alternative subculture identity had 
a greater risk of self-harm (OR = 5.14; 3.58, 7.36) across a three-year time period (15-18 
years; Bowes et al., 2015). An increase in the odds of self-harm of 1.52 (1.42, 1.63) for each 
unit increase in the 5-point affiliation scale, reduced to 1.33 (1.19, 1.48) when adjusting for 
confounders to include previous depression and self-harm, gender, early risks factors and 
victimisation. 
 
Two cross-sectional studies (Young et al., 2006; Young et al., 2014) found that those 
who at least moderately self-identified with an alternative subculture (Goth, Emo, Punk, 
Mosher) had more than three times the odds of endorsing self-harm (OR = 3.49 – 14.16), 
NSSI (OR = 3.56 – 3.92) and suicidal thoughts (OR = 3.41), and around six times the odds of 
having attempted suicide (OR = 5.96).  Moreover, the affiliation with ‘Goth’ culture 
specifically had a stronger association with self-harm (OR = 16.35, CI = 5.06 – 52.91), and 
  
 
12 
 
was the only subculture that remained a significant predictor of self-harm when other 
subcultures were adjusted for. However, the large confidence intervals observed possibly 
reflect the small sample size (n = 15; Young et al., 2006), affecting the precision of the 
results. Effect sizes remained similar or were larger when confounding variables were 
adjusted for (e.g. substance use, socioeconomic status, gender, depression). The cross-
sectional nature of the analyses of these studies limits the ability to make inferences regarding 
causality or the direction of effect.    
 
Another cross-sectional study (O’Connor, 2015) found Emo participants reported 
more self-harm (including suicidal ideation) than the Goth participants (d = 1.15 – 1.44), 
however, a different study found Goth and Emo alternative groups loaded onto a single factor 
(Young et al., 2014).  Out of the four studies discussed, three used non-validated items from 
larger tools to measure self-harm, but identified similar relationships to the one study that did 
use validated scales (Young et al., 2014). 
Music Preference 
 
There were small, positive associations between a preference for Heavy Metal music 
and increased self-harm (five studies); namely suicidal ideation (r = .24; Burge et al., 2010), 
past suicidal ideation (r = .21; Lester & Whipple, 1996) and suicide risk to include attempted 
suicide and suicidal ideation (r = .13 – .26; Lacourse et al., 2001). Furthermore, higher 
percentages of Heavy Metal fans (31-74%) reported suicidal thoughts in comparison to non-
fans (35% vs. 14%; Martin et al., 1993; Scheel & Westefeld, 1999).  
 
In one study, the association of music preference and self-harm disappeared (B = 
0.10-0.14) when adjusting for a range of confounders including self-
estrangement/powerlessness, father negligence. normlessness, and substance use (Lacourse et 
al., 2001) but as these factors were not explored in other studies, conclusions cannot be made.  
  
 
13 
 
 
Stack and colleagues (1994) compared geographic regions (US states) and reported a 
significant positive association (r = .56) between a preference for Heavy Metal music and 
completed suicide in young people (aged 15- 24 years), which remained evident, though 
smaller, when confounding variables were controlled for (e.g. divorce, immigration, social 
economic status, religion and ethnicity; B = .26). Importantly, the design of this study means 
inferences regarding the association of music preference and self-harm for individuals are not 
possible, and could reflect the ecological fallacy (Winzar, 2015). The assessment of musical 
preference (magazine subscription) is also a proxy and it is unclear how well this mirrors 
musical preference when assessed directly.  
Qualitative Studies 
Summary of Included Papers & Quality Assessment 
Two qualitative papers were identified (See Table 3). One analysed social media 
postings for two Emo interest groups, and so provided little information concerning sample 
characteristics (Zdanow & Wright, 2012). The other involved interviews with Emo 
adolescents alongside an analysis of web-forums (Trnka, Kuska, Balcar & Tavel, 2017).  
Both studies lacked a justification of the qualitative approach taken (see Table 4), 
raising uncertainty about whether alternative approaches to the data would have been more 
suitable. Procedural rigor was also a problem, with a lack of transparency relating to 
methodological decisions apparent to some extent in both studies. As a result the suitability 
of the samples to answer the questions posed by the research was limited. For example, it was 
not always clear how groups had been selected or how Emo affiliation was determined. Both 
studies also did not engage with issues of reflexivity, which might have influenced study 
design or implementation. In both studies the use of data from internet forums or social media 
is potentially problematic. Such posts are made with a primary social and communal 
  
 
14 
 
function, and it is challenging to separate the function of these postings from their other 
possible meanings. These issues mean that results from these two studies should be viewed 
with caution. 
Alternative Subculture Affiliation 
 
Both studies reported common themes around suicide and self-harm being accepted 
and normalised, presented as understandable responses to life difficulties and valid solutions. 
At the extreme, this included positive reinforcement and praise relating to reported acts of 
self-harm. Consistent with wider literature (Taylor et al., 2017), the idea that self-harm can be 
functional and provide a means of coping with distressing experiences was noted. The data 
also suggested possible benefits of subculture affiliation, including the sense of acceptance 
and belonging that can come from being part of a subculture. This mirrors findings from the 
wider literature on alternative subcultures (Hines & McFerran, 2014; Munsell, 2011). Data 
suggested that self-harm was at times seen as a part of the Emo subculture but this did not 
seem as strong a theme, more apparent in Trnka and colleagues (2017) than Zdanow and 
Wright (2012). Moreover, Trnka and colleagues suggestion of a link between Emo subculture 
and self-harm relied heavily on their own interpretation of having seen young people with 
visible scars, and images of injuries online, rather than through direct interview data. It is also 
not clear to what extent the views identified in these studies reflect the perceptions of young 
people more generally, and so it is difficult to link these themes specifically to a certain 
subculture.   
Discussion 
 
The aim of the review was to investigate the relationship that self-harm and suicide 
has with alternative subculture affiliation, including music preference as a proxy indicator of 
subculture affiliation. Four quantitative papers identified direct evidence of substantive 
  
 
15 
 
positive association between alternative subculture affiliation and self-harm. Moreover, one 
of these studies employed a longitudinal design providing evidence that alternative subculture 
affiliation may lead to or contribute to risk of self-harm, as opposed to being a consequence 
or epiphenomena of self-harm. More indirect evidence of this association between alternative 
subculture affiliation and self-harm came from the six studies that were concerned with 
musical preference. Small positive associations were found across studies for a preference for 
Heavy Metal music and self-harm, and one study found an association with completed 
suicide.  Two qualitative papers raise the possibility that normalisation and acceptance of 
self-harm and suicide within alternative subcultures may reflect one mechanism increasing 
risk in these populations. However, it is unclear whether these putative mechanisms are 
something specific to alternative subcultures and so conclusions here should remain cautious. 
  
The findings across several studies that participants who identified with alternative 
subcultures (through self-identification or music preference) also had experiences of 
adversity, including bullying or victimisation, difficult family relationships and prior 
emotional and/or behaviour difficulties (Bowes et al., 2015; Lacourse et al., 2001; Martin et 
al., 1993), provides some support for the suggestion that they are a group that may have pre-
existing vulnerabilities to self-harm (Young et al., 2014). However, despite this potential link, 
several studies (k = 3) found that the relationship between alternative affiliation and self-
harm continued to exist after these confounding variables were controlled for (Bowes et al., 
2015; Young et al., 2006; Young et al., 2014).Furthermore, the single longitudinal analysis 
suggested that subculture affiliation is associated with a subsequent increase in self-harm 
risk. These results appear to work against the hypothesis that the association between 
alternative subculture affiliation and self-harm results solely from a shared vulnerability. This 
evidence is preliminary though, and further research, especially longitudinal studies, are 
needed before firmer conclusions can be drawn.  
  
 
16 
 
 
Multiple mediating mechanisms may account for an association between alternative 
subculture affiliation and self-harm. Self-harm may be a way of coping with the ‘minority 
stress’ that such groups may experience (e.g. victimisation, stigma, hate crime), or a 
mechanism that is more inherent to the group affiliation itself, such as modelling, 
normalisation or even positive reinforcement of self-harm (Young et al., 2014). The latter 
mechanism was suggested by the qualitative studies, but data is currently lacking to suggest 
this modelling or normalisation is particularly pronounced in alternative subcultures. It has 
also been suggested that the morbid aesthetic associated with certain alternative subcultures 
(e.g. Emo, Goth), results in increased exposure to images and themes linked to self-harm and 
suicide (Trnka et al., 2017), but again empirical support is lacking. Moreover, images relating 
to injury, self-harm and suicide are prolific in popular culture outside of alternative 
subcultures (e.g. controversial television series “13 reasons why”), and the morbid and 
subversive imagery found within some alternative subcultures such as Goth, can also be 
balanced with a sense of camp and self-irony (e.g. Mueller, 2008; van Elferen, 2012). These 
mediating mechanisms clearly require further investigation. It should also be noted that there 
is evidence of the positive effects of subculture affiliation, in terms of a sense of belonging 
and community (Hines & McFerran, 2014; Munsell, 2011; Young et al., 2014). Well-
designed longitudinal qualitative studies may be valuable here in examining possible 
mechanisms. 
 
The number of participants who identified as ‘alternative’ or who reported self-harm 
was small in many studies (e.g. less than 10% of overall sample), which may have limited 
power and reliability of effect estimates. Participants were predominantly young people from 
western societies (e.g. only one study included an older age group) and so conclusions cannot 
currently be generalized beyond this context. Alternative subculture affiliation is a culture-
bound construct, and different groups will emerge dependent on culture. However, there is 
  
 
17 
 
some research to suggest that alternative subcultures do exist in non-westernised countries 
(Bin Quader, & Redden, 2015; Ma, 2002; Mulej, 2011; Rene & Airi-Alina, 2011).  Related to 
this is the possibility that the same subcultures differ across countries (e.g. UK and US Goths 
or fans of Metal). More cross-cultural studies would help identify such differences 
Recruitment procedures, inclusion criteria and/or definitions of what constitutes an 
“adolescent” were not clearly stated in seven studies which may impair comparability of 
results where different definitions were used.  
 
Studies had an over-reliance on self-report measures. These may be beneficial in 
assessing a taboo subject like self-harm, encouraging more honest responses (Thornberry & 
Krohn, 2000).  Nonetheless, relying on self-report also creates a risk of shared method bias 
that may have inflated associations. Measures of subculture affiliation and music preference 
rarely had established psychometric properties, though they typically had good face validity. 
Poor psychometric properties would affect the validity of findings, for example, if measures 
do not represent important subcultures. However, a challenge to developing scales in this area 
is the shifting nature of youth culture. Several studies (k = 5) used single or few item 
measures of self-harm which may lack content validity and carry a greater risk of error (false 
positive and false negatives) in identifying self-harm. Future research would benefit from 
more comprehensive assessment of subculture affiliation and self-harm using validated 
measures and a variety of assessment mediums (e.g. self-report, interview, etc.). The 
qualitative studies generally lacked transparency and discussion regarding important aspects 
of the design and analysis (e.g. sampling strategy, choice of analytic method, reflexivity) and 
at times presented themes that did not seem well supported by the data. 
 
In this review, music preference was included as a proxy to measure the alternative 
concept, but these two constructs are not directly comparable and had to be explored 
separately. Moreover, the definition of ‘alternative’ varied between studies, which limits 
  
 
18 
 
comparability further. In the current review, it was noted that although alternative subcultures 
were the population of interest, the papers that were explored under this category largely 
focused on Goth subculture. A final limitation of the review is that it was limited to papers 
that were available in English language. 
 
The review supports the suggestion that those who identify as belonging to an 
alternative subculture are at a higher risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Moreover, 
there is preliminary evidence that alternative affiliation predicts self-harm over time, and that 
this effect holds whilst adjusting for a number of likely confounders. Nonetheless, while a 
variety of plausible mediating mechanisms exist, it is not yet clear what it is about alternative 
subculture affiliation (or alternative music preference) that could contribute to the risk of self-
harm. This research requires interpretation within the wider context of public concern around 
alternative subcultures and their impact on the mental health of young people. This public 
concern has at times, unhelpfully, demonised alternative subcultures and music as a cause of 
problems including self-harm (Hjelm, Kahn-Harris & LeVine, 2011; Varas-Díaz, Rivera-
Segarra, Medina, Mendoza, González-Sepūlveda, 2015). There is currently not adequate 
evidence to draw conclusions that these alternative subcultures themselves are in any way 
harmful. Instead a justifiable stance is to view individuals belonging to such subcultures as a 
group at elevated risk of self-harm, whom we may need to better understand and support 
 
There are various possible avenues for interventions with these groups. Increasing the 
awareness of the victimisation of alternative subcultures through campaigns in order to 
reduce stigma and empower subcultures may impact on outcomes for individuals (Bowes et 
al., 2015; World Health Organisation; WHO, 2014). For example, the Sophie Lancaster 
Foundation has been set up for the purpose of reducing the victimisation of such groups 
(Young et al., 2014).  Another route for intervention would be training health, education and 
social services staff about the nature and function of both subculture identities and self-harm 
  
 
19 
 
and suicide, allowing professionals to identify those at risk of self-harm, suicide and 
contagion and intervene early (Department of Health; DOH, 2012; Dishion & Tipsord, 2011; 
Young et al., 2014).  Introducing preventative programmes to these services could aim to 
reduce risk behaviours through providing psychoeducation about mental health and help-
seeking (Scheel & Westefeld, 1999; Young et al, 2014); engaging families in support 
programmes/interventions (Fortune, Cottrell, & Fife, 2016) or running groups on problem 
solving, self-efficacy and skills training (e.g. emotional regulation; Booth, Keogh, Doyle, & 
Owens, 2014; Sambrook, Abba, & Chadwick, 2007). Working directly with alternative 
youths might involve developing interventions that build on existing identities, for example 
being creative in approach, potentially involving music in interventions (Lacourse et al., 
2001; Young et al., 2014). This may aid engagement, open up communication and avoid 
stigma. These findings have clinical implications for services who need to respond to the 
varied needs of such groups. Failure to do so could result in lack of recognition of mental 
health and risk behaviours (Cooper et al., 2010).

A significant positive 
association was found between 
the extent to which young 
people identified as ‘Goth’ at 
15 years and self-harm at 18 
years old, after adjusting for 
other potential risk factors 
(including previous self-harm 
and depression; OR = 1.33).

The Suicidal Ideation 
Questionnaire 
(Reynolds, 1986) 
There was a significant 
positive association between 
listening to Heavy Metal music 
and increased suicidal ideation 
(r = .24). Heavy Metal music 
was associated with suicidal 
ideation in males (r = .30) but 
not females.

Suicidal risk scale 
which classifies 
adolescents as ‘high’ or

(Tousignant, Hamel & 
Bastien, 1988) 
There was a small positive 
association between preference 
for Heavy Metal music and 
suicidal ideation and attempts 
(r = .13 – .26).    Females who 
had a preference for Heavy 
Metal music were at 
significantly greater risk of 
suicide (r = .26) in comparison 
  
 
34 
 
to males (r = .13, not 
significant), determined by 
higher reports of serious 
suicidal ideation and attempted 
suicide (r = .26). However, this 
finding was diminished when 
controlling for other risk 
factors.

Achenbach Youth Self 
Report (YSR;

Significant associations were 
found between a preference for 
Rock/Metal music and suicidal 
thoughts and self-harm. Higher 
percentages of those who had a 
preference for Heavy Metal 
music reported suicidal 
thoughts (31-66%) and 
deliberate self-harm (20 – 
62%) in comparison to those 
who had other music 
preferences (15 - 35% suicidal 
thoughts; 8-14% self-harm).

found between participants 
who identified with alternative

significantly more self-harm 
(including suicidal ideation) to 
the Goth subculture (d = 1.15 – 
1.44).

Suicidal Risk 
Questionnaire (SRQ; 
Westefeld, Cardin &

Participants who had a 
preference for Heavy Metal 
music had more suicidal 
thoughts than participants who 
had other music preferences. 
Within this group, 74% of 
females reported occasionally 
or seriously thinking about 
suicide in comparison to 35% 
of females who did not report a 
preference for Heavy Metal 
music, and 42% of males who 
had a preference for Heavy 
Metal music reported 
occasionally or seriously 
thinking about suicide in 
comparison to 15% of males 
who did not have this 
preference.

found between youth suicide 
and preference for Heavy

covariates were accounted for, 
a small but significant effect 
remained (B = 0.26), but other 
factors were more significant 
(Black ethnicity; B = -0.41; 
Divorced; B = 0.30). In the 
older age group (25 – 34 
years), there was no significant 
effect of a preference for 
Heavy Metal music and suicide 
when other factors were 
controlled for (B = 0.17).

Computerised version of

A strong positive association 
was found between affiliation 
with Goth subculture and self-
harm, including attempted 
suicide (OR = 16.35), which 
remained after confounders 
were controlled for (e.g. 
gender, OR = 1.42; substance 
use, OR = 2.04; prior 
depression, OR = 1.13). 
Positive associations were also 
found between other alternative 
subcultures (e.g. Punk, Heavy 
Metal, Mosher) and self-harm 
(OR = 3.49 – 4.42), though the 
association was much stronger 
  
 
37 
 
for Goth (OR = 14.16) which 
remained a significant 
predictor of self-harm when 
other subcultures were adjusted 
for.

Questionnaire (SHBQ; 
Gutierrez, Osman,

A positive association was 
found between participants 
who affiliated with an 
alternative subculture and 
NSSI (OR = 3.6 – 3.9), suicidal 
thoughts (OR = 3.4) and 
attempting suicide (OR = 6.0) 
in comparison to their non-
alternative peers (OR = 0.69 – 
2.25). When confounding 
variables were adjusted for 
(e.g. substance use, 
socioeconomic status, gender)   
this effect was strengthened 
with the alternative group 
being more than 4 times the 
odds to engage in NSSI (OR = 
4.04 – 4.16) and between 
almost 4 to 8 times the odds of 
engaging in other forms of self-
harm (e.g. suicidal ideation, 
OR = 3.7 and attempt suicide, 
OR = 8.10).
