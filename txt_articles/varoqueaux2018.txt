In Brief
Placozoans are simple flat animals that
lack a nervous system and muscles.
Varoqueaux et al. find that the behavior of
the placozoan Trichoplax is influenced by
complex chemical signaling.
Neuropeptides, secreted molecules
produced by neurons in other animals,
induce striking changes in the behavior of
these neuron-less animals.

SUMMARY
Placozoans, together with sponges, are the only ani-
mals devoid of a nervous system and muscles, yet
both respond to sensory stimulation in a coordinated
manner.Howbehavioralcontrolin thesefree-livingan-
imals is achieved in the absence of neurons and, more
fundamentally, how the first neurons evolved from
more primitive cells for communication during the
rise ofanimals arenot yet understood[1–5].The placo-
zoan Trichoplax adhaerens is a millimeter-wide, flat,
free-living marine animal composed of six morpholog-
ically identified cell types distributed across a simple
body plan [6–9]: a thin upper epithelium and a
columnar lower epithelium interspersed with a loose
layer of fiber cells in between. Its genome contains
genes
encoding
several
neuropeptide-precursor-
like proteins and orthologs of proteins involved in
neurosecretion in animals with a nervous system
[10–12]. Here we investigate peptidergic signaling
in T. adhaerens. We found specific expression of
several neuropeptide-like molecules in non-overlap-
ping cell populations distributed over the three cell
layers, revealing an unsuspected cell-type diversity
of T. adhaerens. Using live imaging, we discovered
that treatments with 11 different peptides elicited
striking and consistent effects on the animals’ shape,
patterns of movement, and velocity that we catego-
rized under three main types: (1) crinkling, (2) turning,
and (3) flattening and churning. Together, the data
demonstrate a crucial role for peptidergic signaling
in nerveless placozoans and suggest that peptidergic
volume
signaling
may
have
pre-dated
synaptic
signaling in the evolution of nervous systems.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Trichoplax adhaerens Comprises Multiple Populations
of Peptide-Secreting Cells
Peptidergic communication is widely used throughout most of
the animal kingdom. It may even predominate neural communi-
cation in phyla such as cnidarians and ctenophores [11, 13]. The
importance of secreted peptides in placozoan physiology and
behaviors is not known. The genome of T. adhaerens encodes
for determinants of both classical and peptidergic (neuro)trans-
mission
[10–12].
Among
the
putative
peptide
signaling
molecules predicted from the genome [11, 12], we selected
candidates with good antigenic profiles to generate antibodies.
We chose five peptides bearing an amidation site (SIFGamide,
SITFamide, YYamide, RWamide, and FFNPamide) as well as
one of the four predicted insulin-like peptides, TrIns3. Immunos-
tainings with the affinity-purified antibodies in whole-mount
T. adhaerens uncovered six populations of cells with distinct dis-
tribution patterns (Figure 1). Upon co-labeling experiments [14],
these peptides were never found to be co-expressed, as illus-
trated for SIFGamide, SITFamide, and FFNPamide (Figure 1B)
and SITFamide, FFNPamide, and TrIns3 (Figure S1). Instead, it
appears that each of the six populations of peptide-secreting
cells spreads concentrically, delineating distinct territories
(Figure 1C). Starting from the outside of the animal toward its in-
side, SIFGamide-immunoreactive cells are found at the very
edge and the outer rim of the upper epithelium. SITFamide cells
distribute further inward in the upper epithelium, in an equally
broad annular area. Together, the description of these popula-
tions validates and refines the suggested rim-versus-center
cell composition of T. adhaerens [7, 8]. Intriguingly, TrIns3-
labeled cells are located in the lower epithelium along a thin
ring across the boundaries of the SIFGamide and SITFamide
territories. A few, small TrIns3-reactive cells are at times also
found at the edge.
Earlier studies using antibodies against RFamide [15] or
FMRFamide [8] have identified putative peptidergic cells at the
rim. Ciliated, endocrine-like cells with neurosecretory features
(e.g., expressing SNAP [soluble NSF attachment protein] recep-
tor [SNARE] proteins) have also previously been described at the
rim and named ‘‘gland cells’’ [6–8]. Because no FMRFamide
peptide precursor could be identified in the T. adhaerens
genome, we asked whether labeling with anti-FMRFamide
antibodies could derive from cross-reactivity with (some of) the
populations of newly identified cells. Upon co-immunolabeling
with commercial anti-FMRFamide antibodies, we observed
indeed that SITFamide-expressing cells and, more faintly,
TrIns3-expressing cells are also labeled by these antibodies.
Anti-FMRF antibodies also label cells near the rim of the animal
that are not labeled by any of the tested antibodies. These

 observations suggest that anti-FMRFamide antibodies detect
SITFamide and maybe other peptides (Figure S1).
The remaining three populations of peptide-secreting cells,
expressing RWamide, FFNPamide, and YYamide, distributed
away from the rim in more central parts of the organism. Labeling
for RWamide is confined to the inside of the organism and does
not reach the surface. The fluorescent peptidergic granules
distribute tightly around a rather small nucleus located deep in
the middle of the organism. Because they are not observed in
correlation with auto-fluorescent particles nor with large nuclei
or cell bodies, we suggest that RWamide-secreting cells do
not correspond to the large and complex fiber cells, landmarks
of the intermediate, non-epithelial layer [7, 8], but to another,
as-yet unidentified cell type. RWamide cells spread within a
very large ring, sometimes even to the center of the organism
(Figure 1C). Finally, cells expressing FFNPamide and YYamide
mix and mingle in the center part of the lower epithelium.
FFNPamide cells are thin and tall and more abundant than
YYamide cells, whereas the latter appear larger and filled with
numerous labeled granules. In this region, cylindrical epithelial
cells, lipophil cells, and another population of putative endocrine
cells (labeled with SNAREs, but not FMRFamide antibodies)
have been reported [7, 8]. Whether FFNPamide and/or YYamide
cells may correspond to SNARE-expressing cells cannot be
addressed currently, because available antibodies did not allow
for double-labeling. The T. adhaerens genome encodes several
isoforms of secretory SNARE proteins [16], and the specificity
of antibodies used so far is unclear. It is likely that different
populations of secretory cells with different sets of secretory
SNARE protein isoforms exist in T. adhaerens.
In summary, we uncovered an unexpected diversity of pepti-
dergic cells with unique concentric distribution patterns (Fig-
ure 1C) in this morphologically simple animal. This suggests
that secreted peptides have unique signaling functions poten-
tially regulating many aspects of T. adhaerens physiology.
Neuropeptide-like Molecules Elicit Strong Stereotypical
Behaviors in T. adhaerens
Placozoans move slowly across surfaces using a densely ciliated
lower epithelium [9]. They produce stereotypical behaviors as
they flip, fold, flatten, rotate, and constantly change their shape
[17–20] in a highly coordinated manner. The animals also change
their speed as a function of light intensity [19] or presence of food
[8, 18, 19, 21–23]. Their extra-organismal feeding behavior is

 particularly complex [18, 21]. How T. adhaerens coordinates
such movements is only beginning to emerge.
To test the effects of peptides on T. adhaerens behavior, we
recorded over 50 min the motor behavior of several individuals.
At 15 min, we applied each one of eleven synthetic peptides pre-
dicted from T. adhaerens neuropeptide-precursor-like proteins.
We tested the peptides ELPE, FFNPamide, LF, LFNE, MFPF,
PWN, RWamide, SIFGamide, SITFamide, WPPF, and YYamide
(Tables S1 and S2; note that ELPE and MFPF have not been re-
ported so far). We used peptides at varying concentrations
across trials (200 nM to 50 mM; Table S1; in-depth analysis
was performed for 20 mM peptide). We observed strong effects
on behavior following peptide treatment, indicating that the pep-
tides reached their targets, as expected from the anatomy of the
organism [22]. Several parameters including the area and shape
(roundness) of the organisms, as well as locomotion speed
and path trajectories, were scored. The timing and extent of in-
dividual responses varied considerably, making it impractical
to reflect the effects in averaged datasets. Hence, we show aver-
aged and individual responses as appropriate depending on the
nature of the effect of each peptide.
In the majority of cases, the peptides elicited strong and char-
acteristic changes in movement. We categorized these changes
under three general types: (1) crinkling, (2) rounding up and
rotating, and (3) flattening and churning.
Upon application of PWN, T. adhaerens immediately crinkled,
as reflected by a sharp decrease in the area of the animals. The
effect lasted for approximately 10 min, after which the animals
recovered their normal shape (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D; Video
S1). Application of SIFGamide induced even stronger crinkling
that led to an approximate 50% decrease in the area, an effect
from which the animals only started to recover by the end of
the recording (Figures 2E, 2G, 2H, and S3). In addition,
SIFGamide-treated animals often detached from the substrate
(Video S1). Detachment was briefly reported elsewhere [24].
T. adhaerens adopts a similar shape in response to UV light
[25] or when flushed with a strong water stream.
The application of LF and LFNE peptides triggered a different
type of morphological and behavioral change. Both peptides
induced the animals to rotate for several minutes around a fixed
axis (arrows in Figure 3E) or to move in circular trajectories (Fig-
ures 3B and 3F; Video S1). They transiently flattened, while keep-
ing their round shape, to reach up to 240% (LF; Figure 3D) or
130% (LFNE; Figure 3H) of their average area. Upon LF applica-
tion, animals rapidly adopted a smooth round shape (Figure 3A)
and rotated around themselves and in the dish. While the animals
recovered, their edges were seen undulating at times. Upon LFNE
application, the majority of animals rounded up, often adopting a
spiral shape (Figure 3E), and turned around themselves (Fig-
ure 3F). A few individuals elongated or undulated at the edges.
Another group of peptides, comprising FFNPamide, ELPE,
MFPF, and WPPF, induced actions reminiscent of feeding
behavior, without entirely recapitulating the feeding sequence
(Videos S1 and S2). When feeding, T. adhaerens stops moving
before a large fringe of its periphery stretches and flattens
down, adhering to the bottom. Meanwhile, its central part un-
dergoes coordinated rhythmic movements including stretching,
contracting, and rotating components (‘‘churning’’ [18, 21]). The
animal then loosens itself from the bottom and resumes crawling.
All four peptides increased the number of flattening events (Fig-
ures 4C, 4G, 4K, and 4O), as shown by an increase in average
area (Figures S2 and S3). Most often, flattening and pausing
events occurred concomitantly (Figure 4B versus Figure 4D, Fig-
ure 4J versus Figure 4L, and Figure 4N versus Figure 4P),
whereas they were occasionally slightly shifted (Figure 4F versus
Figure 4H). Flattening induced by FFNPamide was extreme, as
the center part of the organism appeared extremely pale. This
suggests that the animal is able to thin out to an extent that has
not been reported before—up to five times its ‘‘default’’ size.
ELPE, MFPF, and WPPF induced the animals to adhere more

bottom of the dish. Scale bars represent 250 mm (A), 200 mm (B and F), and 170 mm (E). See also Figure S4 and Tables S1 and S2.

 tightly to the dish at their rim (which hence appears paler; Figures
4E, 4I, and 4M), to flatten down, and to churn with slightly different
movements. In the presence of MFPF, animals churn slower or
faster than untreated animals, and for extended periods of time.
FFNPamide addition also triggered moderate churning move-
ments. Interestingly, the numerous FFNPamide-immunoreactive
cells embedded in the lower epithelium (Figure 1) are found in the
same area as the digestive enzyme-releasing lipophil cells [8, 21],
and hence are well positioned to fulfil a role in modulating feeding
behavior [4, 26]. Altogether, these behaviors could be subpro-
grams of the motor alterations associated with the food uptake
process. Whether the peptides involved are acting indepen-
dently, sequentially, or in synergy requires further investigation.
Finally, a few peptides induced only subtle alterations in
T. adhaerens behavior (Figure S2; Video S2). Neither SITFamide,
YYamide, nor different RWamide peptides affected the flattening
rate of the animals. SITFamide induced an effect that was diffi-
cult to quantify. The speed of the animals was significantly lower
during the 30 min monitored after SITFamide application. Some
animals slowed down (Figure S2) without stopping (Figure S2). In
one case, an animal stopped but did not flatten (2_102, Fig-
ure S3). Application of YYamide resulted in a small but significant
increase in the speed of or the distance traveled by the animals
during the later phase of the recordings (Figure S2). In one
case, an animal increased its area without slowing down
(1_128, Figure S3). Finally, the effects of RWamides were tested
in a pilot series of experiments using the three slightly different
peptides RWamide1, RWamide2, and RWamide3 and their
respective forms bearing an N-terminal pyroglutamine modifica-
tion pGluRWamide1, pGluRWamide2, and pGluRWamide3. No
drastic effect was observed over the 30 min of recordings.
Hence, pGluRWamide2 was arbitrarily selected for further trials.
No change in area, trajectory, speed, or distance traveled was
noted. Application of the vehicle alone did not alter the animals’
behavior (Figure S2; Video S2).
Overall, our data show that most predicted peptides are able
to strongly alter T. adhaerens behavior. This suggests that
peptidergic signaling pathways that can affect the animals’
contractility and movements are in place. Moreover, we describe
a previously undocumented capacity of extreme physical alter-
ations of T. adhaerens, from extreme flattening to crinkling and
from churning to rotating. Our results suggest that motor behav-
iors in T. adhaerens likely result from the coordinated interplay of
several cellular arrays that are under the strong influence of pep-
tidergic signals.
An earlier study reports that gland cells secrete an endomor-
phin-like peptide (TaELP), which arrests ciliary beating, inducing
feeding-like pauses [24] (Figure S2). Interestingly, we observed
that the application of the endomorphin-like peptide also
induced flattening but no churning (Table S1). At lower concen-
trations, crinkling was observed, whereas high concentrations
caused the animal to rotate. Changes in movement may rely in
part on changes in ciliary beating. Flattening may be generated
by fast contractions of epithelial cells [20] or by contractions of
the large, actin- and microtubule-rich fiber cells. These are
located in between the two epithelial layers [26, 27] and are con-
nected to each other and contact all cell types [8].
Peptide signaling molecules and their respective receptors
appeared early in metazoan evolution, and have been described
in all animals with a nervous system including ctenophores [13,
28] and cnidarians. Our study suggests that peptide signaling
molecules play an important role in cell-cell communication in
T. adhaerens as well. Of note, the genome of T. adhaerens en-
codes a rich repertoire of G protein-coupled receptors [10, 29],
at least some of which likely act as receptors for the peptides
characterized in this study [11]. The peptide signaling systems
in T. adhaerens are less complex than those of eumetazoans
and might thus represent a more ancestral stage [11]. It will be
interesting to explore the occurrence and actions of peptide
signaling molecules in other placozoans [30, 31]. Because the

paths (in gray/black: before/after application) show drastic changes in trajectories upon peptide application. Not only are individuals rotating around a fixed axis in
an unusually ‘‘frozen’’ shape (see arrows in E) but they are also moving in small circular paths within the dish. They periodically underwent massive flattening.
Scale bars represent 250 mm (A and E) and 200 mm (B and F). See also Figure S3 and Tables S1 and S2.

 T. adhaerens genome also contains all determinants of transmis-
sion via classical neurotransmitters [10], it will be essential to
scrutinize whether the animal combines elements of peptide
and
classical
transmission.
The
peptide-containing
cells
described herein might represent specialized, non-neuronal
secretory cells or neuroendocrine-like cells. These cells may
be able to co-release both types of transmitters, as is found in
neurons and endocrine cells in animals with nervous systems
[32].
Altogether, our data demonstrate that cell-type diversity in
placozoans is higher than previously inferred [7, 8] and that
several specialized cell types, regarded as the ‘‘basal building
blocks of multicellular organisms’’ [33], have already emerged
in this phylum. Indeed, a recent single-cell transcriptome study
also revealed the presence of several hitherto unexplored
lower-frequency cell types expressing unique signaling peptides
[34] (Figure S4). In T. adhaerens, several populations of topo-
graphically organized peptide-secreting cells can strongly
modulate the animals’ movements. Our results suggest that
peptidergic signaling is an important mode of communication
for placozoans, as is the case for cnidarians and bilaterians
[11, 35–39].

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal Maintenance
Trichoplax adhaerens (Grell strain, haplotype H1) were maintained in large glass Petri dishes (15-cm diameter) containing artificial
seawater (filtered ASW, salinity of 1025 ppm (38 g/L); Coral Pro Salt, Red Sea), at 26�C and under a 12:12 hr dark-light cycle. They
were fed once a week with 8-10 mL of a 1:1 mixture of Nannochloropsis (Florida Aqua Farms) and Pyrenomonas helgolandii (SAG, Go
¨ t-
tingen, Germany) cultured separately in ASW complemented with 0.03% of Micro Algae Grow (Florida Aqua Farms). About 80% of the
medium was replaced every other week. When reaching a population density of over 100-200 individuals per dish, 10 to 20 animals were
randomly taken up with a pipette to set up a new dish. The animals reproduce asexually and their sex was not determined.
METHOD DETAILS
Antibody production
Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits (2 rabbits per peptide, Speedy program, Eurogentec) against peptide candidates
[11, 12] that were predicted to be amidated, namely ‘‘FFNPamide’’ (CQFFNP-amide), ‘‘RWamide’’ (CRDQPPRW-amide),

 ‘‘SIFGamide’’ (CQANLKSIFG-amide), ‘‘SITFamide’’ (CNSESTQQGIPSITF-amide), ‘‘YYamide’’ (CGYDDYYY-amide), and Insulin-3
‘‘TrIns3’’ (CPIH-amide). For immunization, peptides were coupled to ovalbumin as carrier protein; the cysteine residue added at
the N-terminal of the peptides allows for subsequent immobilization on a Sulfolink resin (ThermoFisher). Sera were affinity-purified
as described [14], each resulting in two fractions after elution at pH2.9 and pH2.3. Initial immuno-stainings were carried out with
crude and purified antibodies. The two sera raised against each peptide gave similar staining patterns; In all cases, stainings
were invariably abolished upon pre-incubation of the primary antibody with the peptide it was raised against.
Immunolabeling
T. adhaerens were left to adhere at the bottom of 35-mm plastic Petri dish filled with ASW, swiftly replaced by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) with Dextran in ASW for fixation (1-2 hr, RT). After brief washes in ASW followed by 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH7.4 (PB) and a
1 hr-blocking step in 3% normal goat serum (NGS) + 0.2% Triton X-100 in PB, they were incubated for 2 hr in primary antibody (anti-
peptide: 1 mg/mL; anti-FMRFamide (1:300; Enzo Life Sciences #BML-FA1155 or Phoenix Pharmaceuticals #H-047-29) in blocking
solution. After thorough washes in PB, a 1-hr incubation in the corresponding secondary antibody coupled to a fluorophore
(1:600, GAR-Alexa Fluor, Molecular Probes) and further washes in PB, they were incubated for 2 min in Hoechst (1:10,000; Molecular
Probes), rinsed and mounted with Prolong-Gold (LifeTech) on glass slides. For co-labeling with antibodies raised in the same species,
T. adhaerens were instead incubated 45 min in a mix of antibodies coupled to Alexa fluorophores using the Zenon labeling kit
(LifeTechnologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions, washed in PB, post-fixed 15 min in 4% PFA, washed again and incu-
bated in Hoechst before being mounted on a slide. For blocking experiments, we pre-incubated the antibodies in three times excess
of the respective peptides for 2 h before immunostainings.
Imaging
Specimens were imaged on an inverted confocal microscope set-up (Zeiss LSM 780) using a 63x-oil immersion objective (NA1.4).
Image stacks were acquired over the entire thickness of the animal with optical slices of 1.3 mm with an overlap of 0.75 mm, with each
fluorophore imaged separately.
Behavioral testing
Most peptides were dissolved in water, except for YYamide and LF, which were dissolved in 5 mM NH4HCO3. 10-15 T. adhaerens
were pipetted into a 35-mm plastic Petri dish filled with 3 mL ASW and allowed to settle for 15-30 min at 26�C. The dish was then
transferred to the stage of a stereomicroscope (Nikon SM225 coupled to a Nikon DSR12 camera) with a zoom of 0.63x or 3x, and
imaged for 50 min. After 15 min, each peptide (200 nM - 50 mM from a 10 mM stock solution) was applied once and swiftly mixed
in the bath by gentle pipetting. Peptides tested were the following: ‘‘ELPE’’ (GKSFELPE), ‘‘FFNPamide’’ (DDQFFNP-amide),
Insulin-3 ‘‘TrIns3’’ (CPIH-amide), ‘‘LF’’ (DDSQDGYALF), ‘‘LFNE’’ (QEPGISLFNE), ‘‘MFPF’’ (EDDLPGMFPF), ‘‘PWN’’ (EQGALL-
DIPWN),
‘‘RWamide1’’
(DQPPRW-amide),
‘‘RWamide2’’
(DQPTRW-amide),
‘‘RWamide3’’
(DQPSRW-amide),
RWamides

‘‘SIFGamide’’
(EDQANLKSIFG-amide),
‘‘SITFamide’’
(NSESTQQGIPSITF-amide), ‘‘WPPF’’ (EDQQNKPYNGWPPF), and ‘‘YYamide’’ (DYDDYYY-amide) (see Tables S1 and S2 for details).
Control experiments were carried out by application of the vehicles only. Endomorphin-2 (Genscript, RP10926) was tested at con-
centrations of 1, 15 and 50 mM. Images were taken every 4 s under moderate and constant illumination, and at a room temperature of
approximately 20�C. Upon recording, the dishes were placed back in the incubator with food to check animal viability 24 hr after
treatment.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Image Analysis and Statistical Methods
Black and white image series (Tif) were analyzed with Fiji. Only individuals that were visible during the entire time of the recording were
tracked. Since animals in close contact may coordinate their behaviors [17, 24], only animals which were not in contact with one
another were monitored to avoid oversampling. In rare cases when individuals were in contact with each other, only one was moni-
tored. Images on which the application pipettes appeared were not taken into account for analysis. The maximum trajectory area was
set as ROI for each individual and a time stamp applied (see Videos S1 and S2). A threshold (Yen, Fiji) was set to optimally define the
contour of each individual, allowing for the binarization of the image and measurement of the animal’s size (area) using the Plugin
‘Analyze Particles’ in Fiji. Trajectory, distance covered and speed were assessed from the centroid, using the ‘Mtrack20 Plugin in
Fiji. To standardize area variations over several animals, the average area was defined for each individual over the first 15 min of
recording and used as a baseline to normalize the values over the recording. Standard deviations /Standard Errors of the Mean
were calculated for each time point for all individuals using Excel or Prism. Results are presented as Mean ± SD in Figure 4,
Mean ± SEM in Figures S3 and S5. When the values followed a normal distribution, a paired t test was used (Figures S3 and S5).
Otherwise, a paired Wilcoxon test was applied (Figure 4).
