Purpose:
To compare mortality rates from all causes, specific causes, 
total cancers, and specific cancers to assess whether dif-
ferences between radiologists and psychiatrists are con-
sistent with known risks of radiation exposure and the 
changes in radiation exposure to radiologists over time.
Materials and 
Methods:
The authors used the American Medical Association 
Physician Masterfile to construct a cohort of 43 
763 ra-
diologists (20% women) and 64 
990 psychiatrists (27% 
women) (comparison group) who graduated from medical 
school in 1916–2006. Vital status was obtained from re-
cord linkages with the Social Security Administration and 
commercial databases, and cause of death was obtained 
from the National Death Index. Poisson regression was 
used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for all causes and specific causes of death.
Results:
During the follow-up period (1979–2008), 4260 male 
radiologists and 7815 male psychiatrists died. The male 
radiologists had lower death rates (all causes) compared 
with the psychiatrists (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.97), 
similar cancer death rates overall (RR = 1.00; 95% CI: 
0.93, 1.07), but increased acute myeloid leukemia and/or 
myelodysplastic syndrome death rates (RR = 1.62; 95% 
CI: 1.05, 2.50); these rates were driven by those who 
graduated before 1940 (RR = 4.68; 95% CI: 0.91, 24.18). 
In these earliest workers (before 1940) there were also 
increased death rates from melanoma (RR = 8.75; 95% 
CI: 1.89, 40.53), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (RR = 
2.69; 95% CI: 1.33, 5.45), and cerebrovascular disease 
(RR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.01). The 208 deaths in fe-
male radiologists precluded detailed investigation, and the 
number of female radiologists who graduated before 1940 
was very small (n = 47).
Conclusion:
The excess risk of acute myeloid leukemia and/or myelo-
dysplastic syndrome mortality in radiologists who gradu-
ated before 1940 is likely due to occupational radiation 
exposure. The melanoma, NHL, and cerebrovascular 
disease mortality risks are possibly due to radiation. The 
authors found no evidence of excess mortality in radiol-
ogists who graduated more recently, possibly because of 
increased radiation protection and/or lifestyle changes.

to the Masterfile record as they progress 
in their careers. The AMA updates their 
Masterfile database weekly with the in-
formation described earlier, self-report-
ed physician survey data, and data from 
residency training programs, medical 
specialty boards, state licensing organi-
zations, and other databases. The Mas-
terfile includes basic demographic infor-
mation, up to two medical specialties 
per physician (either self-declared or 
from residency programs), vital status, 
and date but not cause of death. The 
medical specialty information is updated 
and confirmed with use of several mech-
anisms. Every year, one-third of the 
physicians receive a self-administered 
annual survey that includes questions 
about current address, type of practice, 
and specialty. Thus, the entire group of 
physicians is contacted every 3 years. 
The response rate to the survey varies 
but is approximately 40%. If a physician 
does not ever complete or update a sur-
vey, the specialty for his or her most re-
cent residency training is maintained in 
the file. Residency training information 
is obtained from the American Associa-
tion of Medical Colleges by means of a 
data sharing agreement.
Physicians were eligible for the cur-
rent cohort if they had a first or sec-
ond specialty of radiology, including 
abdominal 
radiology, 
cardiothoracic 
cohorts (3,4), but only two include ra-
diologists with long-term follow-up and 
both were relatively small (5–9). The 
British cohort of radiologists who were 
registered with a radiologic society be-
tween 1897 and 1979 (n = 2733) was 
followed up for mortality through 1997 
(5–7). The U.S. cohort included 6500 
male radiologists who were members of 
a professional society of radiologists and 
were followed up initially between 1920 
and 1969 and subsequently, with the last 
mortality follow-up ending in 1974 (8,9).
We conducted a record linkage 
study using a nationwide listing of all 
U.S. physicians to identify a cohort of 
43 
763 radiologists and a comparison 
group of 64 
990 psychiatrists, the latter 
with a low probability of occupational 
exposure to ionizing radiation. We per-
formed this study to compare mortality 
rates attributed to all causes, specific 
causes, total cancers, and specific can-
cers to assess whether differences be-
tween radiologists and psychiatrists are 
consistent with known risks of radia-
tion exposure and the changes in radia-
tion exposure to radiologists over time.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
The study received institutional review 
board exemption as there was no direct 
contact with the study population.
The cohort was constructed by using 
membership listings from the American 
Medical Association (AMA). We ob-
tained individual-level physician mem-
bership data from the AMA Physician 
Masterfile, which includes all physicians 
who practiced in the United States 
since 1902 regardless of whether they 
have ever been members of the AMA 
(http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/
about-ama/physician-data-resources/
physician-masterfile.page). The AMA 
enrolls all U.S. physicians at the time 
they enter accredited medical schools 
or, in the case of international medical 
graduates, upon entry to an accredited 
postgraduate residency training pro-
gram or when they obtain a state license 
in the United States. Additional profes-
sional certification information is added

Advances in Knowledge
 
n The study included 43 
763 radiol-
ogists and 64 
990 psychiatrists 
(comparison group) who gradu-
ated from medical school in 
1916–2006; in the radiologists 
who graduated after 1940, there 
was no evidence of increased 
mortality from radiation-related 
causes such as cancer or cardio-
vascular disease.
 
n In the radiologists who graduated 
before 1940, there was an 
increased risk of mortality from 
leukemia and/or myelodysplastic 
syndrome (relative risk [RR] = 
4.68; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.91, 24.18) that was likely 
related to their occupational ra-
diation exposure.
 
n There was also increased mor-
tality from melanoma (RR = 
8.75; 95% CI: 1.89, 40.53), non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 2.69; 
95% CI: 1.33, 5.45), and cere-
brovascular disease (RR = 1.49; 
95% CI: 1.11, 2.01) in those that 
graduated before 1940, and this 
is possibly due to occupational 
radiation exposure.
I
nternationally, it has been estimated 
that there are 2.3 million medical ra-
diation workers, and they comprise 
about half of the workforce exposed 
to manmade sources of radiation (1). 
It is important to continue to study 
occupational groups who are exposed 
to radiation to determine if radiation 
protection measures are adequate (2). 
Patterns of mortality in radiologists can 
also contribute more generally to our 
understanding of the long-term effects 
of protracted low-level radiation expo-
sure. Special features of radiologists 
compared with other radiation-exposed 
populations include generally good 
health compared with patient popula-
tions, the potential for long-term pro-
tracted radiation exposures, and higher 
doses in the past than most other radi-
ation worker cohorts such as nuclear 
workers (2).
There have been eight epidemio-
logic studies of medical radiation worker

psychiatrists to be born in the United 
States (Table 1).
In the male cohort, 4260 of 43 
763 ra-
diologists (12%) and 7815 of 47 
443 psy-
chiatrists (16%) were confirmed to have 
died between 1979 and 2008 (Table 2). 
 
Cause of death was not ascertained for 
133 (3%) of the 4260 male radiologists 
and 337 (4%) of the 7815 male psychi-
atrists. In the female cohort, 208 (2%) 
of the 8851 radiologists and 524 (3%) 
of the 17 
493 psychiatrists died during 
the follow-up period. Overall, the radiol-
ogists and the psychiatrists had substan-
tially lower death rates than the general 
population (standardized mortality ratio 
= 0.47 for radiologists and 0.52 for psy-
chiatrists) (Table E1 [online]). Given the 
small number of female radiologists, our 
analyses focused on men; Table E1 (on-
line) provides additional details about 
the female subjects.
The male radiologists had a lower 
risk of death overall than did the male 
psychiatrists (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 
0.97) but a similar risk of death from 
any cancer (RR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 
1.07). There was an increased risk of 
skin cancer mortality in the radiologists 
who graduated before 1940 (RR = 6.38; 
95% CI: 1.75, 23.20) that was driven 
by an excess of melanoma (RR = 8.75; 
95% CI: 1.89, 40.53) (Table 2).
Overall, there was an increased risk 
of death for all myeloid leukemias (RR 
= 1.43; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.05), which was 
largely due to acute myeloid leukemia 
and/or myelodysplastic syndrome in 
those who graduated before 1940 (RR 
= 4.68; 95% CI: 0.91, 24.18) (Table 3). 
 
There was also an increased risk of 
death from all lymphoid malignancies 
(lymphomas) in these earliest radiolo-
gists (RR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.31, 3.86) 
because of an increased risk of death 
from NHL (RR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.33, 
5.45). There were no significantly in-
creased risks of cancer mortality in 
those who graduated after 1940 for 
all solid cancers, hematologic malig-
nancies, or site-specific solid cancers.
In the deaths from noncancer 
causes, we noted an excess risk of ce-
rebrovascular deaths in the radiologists 
who graduated before 1940 (RR = 1.49; 
95% CI: 1.11, 2.01) (Table 4). However, 
National Death Index), or from 1 year 
after medical school graduation (if af-
ter 1979) until date of death, loss to 
follow-up, or December 31, 2008. Fol-
low-up was limited to deaths that oc-
curred before age 85 years because 
cause of death is reported less reliably 
after that age (7). Poisson regression 
analysis was used to estimate relative 
risks (RRs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) for all causes of death and 
specific causes for radiologists ver-
sus psychiatrists. All analyses were 
adjusted (by means of stratification) 
for sex, year of birth, and attained 
age—the latter two characteristics in 
5-year groups. We also compared the 
observed number of deaths from vari-
ous causes to the expected number by 
means of standardized mortality ratios 
on the basis of rates in the general U.S. 
population, adjusted for age, sex, and 
calendar year of death.
We used the year of medical school 
graduation plus 1 year as a proxy for 
the year first exposed to radiation. Be-
cause occupational radiation exposures 
to noninterventional radiologists have 
been reduced over time owing to im-
proved protection (11–14), the year of 
medical school graduation is a proxy for 
exposure level. We conducted a sensitiv-
ity analysis that was restricted to those 
physicians who were dead or confirmed 
to be alive through the Social Security 
Administration to assess whether there 
was bias related to completeness of 
follow-up. All analyses were conducted 
with software (Epicure; Risk Sciences In-
ternational, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).
Results
We identified a cohort of 43 
763 radiol-
ogists (8851 women [20%]) and 64 
990 
psychiatrists (17 
493 women [27%]) 
from the AMA Masterfile. The cohort 
consists of physicians who started prac-
ticing as early as 1916 and who were 
still alive in 1979, which is when the 
National Death Index was introduced.
Overall, radiologists were slightly 
younger and slightly more likely to have 
graduated from medical school in 1960 
or later compared with psychiatrists. 
Radiologists were also more likely than 
radiology, diagnostic radiology, muscu-
loskeletal radiology, nuclear radiology, 
and pediatric radiology. Interventional 
radiologists, defined as those who had 
this as their specialty or subspecialty 
in the AMA Masterfile, were excluded 
from the current analysis as we are 
studying them separately in a cohort 
of physicians who perform fluoroscop-
ically guided procedures. We selected 
a sample of physicians with a primary 
or secondary specialty of psychiatry as 
the comparison group because of a very 
low probability of occupational expo-
sure to radiation. The stratified random 
sample was selected to ensure at least a 
1:1 ratio (psychiatrists:radiologists) in 
each of the strata defined according to 
birth year (5-year categories) and sex.
Outcome Ascertainment
We conducted a series of record linkages 
to ascertain identifying information that 
was not available in the AMA database 
and then matched the cohort with the 
Social Security Administration database 
to determine vital status. The physi-
cians who were confirmed or presumed 
to be deceased were matched with the 
National Death Index (http://www.cdc.
gov/nchs/ndi.htm). To obtain identify-
ing information, we used commercial 
databases such as the Pension Benefits 
Incorporated, TransUnion, Accurint, 
and Fastdata databases and also used 
interactive tracing to obtain additional 
identifying information for individuals 
who could not be traced successfully 
by using the other sources. Uncertain 
matches were reviewed manually. Vi-
tal status was then confirmed with the 
Social Security Administration. We sub-
mitted records for physicians who were 
confirmed or presumed to be deceased 
for whom we had a date of death and 
for those deceased physicians for whom 
we did not have a date of death to the 
National Death Index. Because the Na-
tional Death Index includes deaths for 
98% of the U.S. population (10), sub-
jects for whom no record of death was 
found were assumed to be alive.
Statistical Analysis
Physicians were followed up from Janu-
ary 1, 1979 (date of the start of the

those with the full analyses (Table E2 
[online]).
There were no clear increases in 
mortality in the female radiologists com-
pared with female psychiatrists (Table 5). 
 
Overall, total mortality was lower in fe-
male radiologists compared with female 
psychiatrists, but total cancer risks 
0.80). Many of these decreases were 
greatest in the physicians who gradu-
ated most recently (1980 and later).
In a sensitivity analysis, we re-
stricted the subjects to those who were 
confirmed as dead or alive by the So-
cial Security Administration, and the 
results were essentially equivalent to 
there were decreased risks of infectious 
diseases (RR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.34, 
0.55)—primarily human immunodefi-
ciency virus (RR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.22, 
0.45) (Table 4), respiratory diseases 
(RR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.99), acci-
dents (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.89), 
and suicides (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55,

were similar. Risk of all circulatory dis-
eases and particularly cerebrovascular 
disease was notably reduced in radiol-
ogists compared with psychiatrists, al-
beit these are based on small numbers. 
The relatively small number of deaths 
in this group (n = 208), however, pre-
vented detailed investigation.
Discussion
We established the largest cohort to 
date of radiologists who had practiced 
in the United States throughout the 
last century and a comparison group 
of psychiatrists unlikely to have had oc-
cupational radiation exposure. Overall, 
compared with the psychiatrists, the ra-
diologists had a significantly lower risk 
of death from all causes and a similar 
risk of death from all cancers combined 
and most other specific causes of death, 
but we did observe an increased risk 
of acute myeloid leukemia and/or my-
elodysplastic syndrome, melanoma, and 
NHL in the radiologists who graduated 
before 1940—when radiation exposures 
would have been the highest. There was 
also an excess risk of cerebrovascular 
death in these earliest radiologists. 
There were no increased risks of cancer 
mortality or other causes of death in the 
radiologists who graduated after 1940.
The previous U.S. cohort of mortal-
ity to 1974 in radiologists who joined the 
Radiological Society of North America 
(RSNA) between 1920 and 1969 (9) 
also showed excess mortality rates for 
radiation-related cancers, which were 
only observed in the earliest radiologists 
(who joined the RSNA before 1940); 
however, follow-up was limited for those 
who joined after 1940. In a much larger 
population with longer-term follow-up, 
we have confirmed that excess mortal-
ity rates in U.S. radiologists are mostly 
restricted to those who worked before 
1940. In a U.K. cohort, results of long-
term follow-up suggested that excess 
mortality rates were restricted to those 
who worked before 1954 (7).
Early case studies of radiologists 
provided the first evidence that leuke-
mia was a radiation-related cancer (15). 
Further systematic studies of U.K. and 
U.S. radiologists confirmed this finding

MEDICAL PHYSICS: Long-term Mortality in Radiologists Compared with Psychiatrists 
Berrington de González et al
(6,16), and our results for acute mye-
loid leukemia are consistent with the 
results of those studies. The elevated 
risk of acute myeloid leukemia has also 
been shown to persist in atomic bomb 
survivors for more than 55 years after 
exposure (17).
Skin cancer mortality, particularly 
melanoma, was also increased in the 
radiologists who graduated before 1940, 
which is interesting because ionizing ra-
diation is not thought to be a cause of 
melanoma (18). There were significant 
excess risks of deaths from nonmelano-
ma skin cancer in the United Kingdom 
(7) and in the previous cohort of U.S. ra-
diologists (16), but not melanoma. Mel-
anoma is a relatively rare cancer and, 
therefore, has been difficult to study in 
most previous radiation epidemiology 
cohorts. In the last cancer incidence 
analysis of Japanese atomic bomb sur-
vivors, there were only 17 cases, which 
precluded informative analysis (19). 
There was a nonstatistically significant 
dose response in U.K. nuclear workers 
(n = 261) (20) and a significant excess in 
the U.S. Radiologic Technologists study 
among those who first worked before 
1950 (21). Confounding by solar ultravi-
olet radiation, which is a strong risk fac-
tor for melanoma (22), cannot be ruled 
out, but the radiologists who graduated 
before 1940 would have needed higher 
exposure to ultraviolet radiation for this 
to explain the patterns of results.
NHL is also not classified as a ra-
diation-inducible cancer because of the 
inconsistency in findings across stud-
ies (18). There is a weak suggestion 
of a radiation dose response for NHL 
among male atomic bomb survivors, 
but not for female survivors (17), and 
an excess was observed in the U.K. ra-
diologists—although the numbers were 
small (n = 9) (7). Again, as with mela-
noma, the elevated risk in the earliest 
radiologists is compatible with higher 
radiation doses but could be due to un-
known confounding factors if they were 
more common in radiologists who grad-
uated before 1940. Because death rates 
from the human immunodeficiency 
virus were significantly lower in the 
radiologists than the psychiatrists and 
NHL is an acquired immune deficiency 
cohort is quite complete. Radiologists 
are also unlikely to have been misclassi-
fied as psychiatrists or vice versa. Lack 
of data on confounding factors, such as 
smoking, could have biased our results 
in either direction. Mortality rates from 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
were significantly lower in the radiolo-
gists than in the psychiatrists who grad-
uated before 1940 (RR = 0.48; 95% 
CI: 0.25, 0.94), which suggests that 
smoking rates are lower in this group, 
which probably biased smoking-related 
mortality risks toward the null, particu-
larly lung cancer. Lower smoking rates 
in radiologists than psychiatrists were 
also reported in the survey of the British 
Doctors Study in 1951 and 1966 (31). 
There are few medical specialties now 
that have no occupational radiation ex-
posure, which is why psychiatrists were 
selected as the comparison. As with an 
earlier study of psychiatrists in the Unit-
ed States, we found higher death rates 
from suicide, accidents, and human 
immunodeficiency virus among psychia-
trists compared with radiologists (32). 
As noted earlier, this may have biased 
results for NHL toward the null. Finally, 
even in this study that included the ma-
jority of U.S. radiologists who practiced 
in the last century there were too few 
women to study their mortality rates in 
detail. In addition, very few female radi-
ologists worked during the early period, 
when exposures were likely highest.
There have been dramatic improve-
ments in radiation protection since the 
earliest radiologists started practicing, 
including general lead shielding of equip-
ment, personal use of lead aprons and 
glasses, and use of room shields (3). 
Early fluoroscopy procedures were likely 
a common and important source of ra-
diation exposure to the radiologists who 
were practicing before 1940 (3). De-
creases in the maximum permissible oc-
cupational dose have also occurred (33), 
and changes in radiation protection have 
changed the organs that received the 
highest radiation exposure. Early radi-
ologists had high skin doses to hands 
and arms, used no personal protection 
garments, and received whole-body ex-
posure from unshielded x-ray tubes (3). 
Current radiologists routinely wear lead 
syndrome–related cancer (23), this 
may have biased the risk estimates in 
those radiologists who graduated after 
1940 toward the null.
An increased risk of cerebrovascu-
lar disease mortality was not reported 
in any of the previous radiologist co-
horts (7,16) but has been observed at 
higher dose levels (.0.5 Gy) in atomic 
bomb survivors (24), after radiation 
therapy for breast cancer (25), and in 
the Mayak worker cohort (26). It is less 
certain whether doses less than 0.5 Gy 
are associated with heart disease and 
cerebrovascular disease, although a re-
cent meta-analysis provided some evi-
dence that it may be (27).
The major strengths of our study 
are the large size of the population, 
our ability to capture the majority of 
radiologists who practiced in the United 
States and were still alive in 1979, and 
the internal comparison group of phy-
sicians who were unlikely to have been 
exposed to radiation through their oc-
cupation. Our long-term follow-up of 
radiologists who graduated before 1940 
provides an assessment of risks sev-
eral decades after first exposure. We 
also had systematic follow-up through 
a large number of tracing sources, with 
a sensitivity analysis that excluded large 
follow-up biases.
The large-scale nature of the study 
also brought limitations, including a 
lack of data on whether a physician is 
currently practicing medicine, a lack of 
data about lifestyle factors, and a lack 
of individual occupational radiation dos-
es. The AMA physicians’ database has 
been used for previous surveys of the 
radiology workforce because it is more 
complete than the American College 
of Radiology membership (28), which 
is estimated to include about 75% of 
practicing radiologists. The American 
College of Radiology currently reports 
that about 21 
000 members are diag-
nostic radiologists (29). In 2002, Bhar-
gavan et al (30) estimated, by using 
American College of Radiology data, 
that there were about 25 
000 radiolo-
gists practicing in the United States in 
2001. Our cohort included about 30 
000 
radiologists who are currently younger 
than 70 years, which suggests that the

The development of sensitive film badge 
monitors and government-required mon-
itoring of medical radiation workers, 
along with a series of standards for radi-
ation protection, also contributed to no-
table decreases in occupational radiation 
exposures, as borne out by survey data 
(11–14). Finally, there have been sub-
stantial changes in practice, with a shift 
toward radiologic technologists perform-
ing radiologic examinations rather than 
radiologists (3). Radiologists now receive 
radiation doses almost exclusively from 
fluoroscopy and some nuclear medicine 
procedures. The mean annual doses 
for radiologists in the United Kingdom 
decreased from 5 mGy in 1964 to 0.5 
mGy in 1984, and the mean annual dos-
es for radiologists in the United States 
from 1972 to 1978 ranged from 3.6 to 
0.7 mGy (34). Exposures to physicians 
have increased in certain medical spe-
cialties in which fluoroscopically guided 
interventions are performed routinely, 
however, and these physicians, including 
interventional radiologists, are the sub-
ject of a separate investigation (3).
In conclusion, the excess risk of acute 
myeloid leukemia and/or myelodysplas-
tic syndrome in radiologists compared 
with psychiatrists who graduated before 
1940 is likely due to higher occupational 
radiation exposures. Excess risks of 
skin cancer, NHL, and cerebrovascular 
disease mortality in these earliest radi-
ologists were observed. Low-dose radia-
tion exposure is not an established cause 
of these cancers, but these findings war-
rant further investigation to test this 
possibility. Occupational radiation doses 
have been reduced substantially, and we 
found no evidence of excess mortality in 
U.S. radiologists who graduated from 
medical school after 1940, possibly be-
cause of increased radiation protection 
and/or lifestyle changes.
