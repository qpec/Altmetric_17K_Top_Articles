Abstract. We present a framework for characterizing the performance of an experimental imaging technology, 
diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI), in a 2-year multicenter American College of Radiology Imaging 
Network (ACRIN) breast cancer study (ACRIN-6691). DOSI instruments combine broadband frequency-domain 
photon migration with time-independent near-infrared (650 to 1000 nm) spectroscopy to measure tissue absorption 
and reduced scattering spectra and tissue hemoglobin, water, and lipid composition. The goal of ACRIN- 6691 was 
to test the effectiveness of optically derived imaging endpoints in predicting the final pathologic response of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Sixty patients were enrolled over a 2-year period at participating sites and 
received multiple DOSI scans prior to and during 3- to 6-month NAC. The impact of three sources of error on 
accuracy and precision, including different operators, instruments, and calibration standards, was evaluated using a 
broadband reflectance standard and two different solid tissue-simulating optical phantoms. Instruments showed 
<0.0010 mm−1 (10.3%) and 0.06 mm−1 (4.7%) deviation in broadband absorption and reduced scattering, 
respectively, over the 2-year duration of ACRIN-6691. These variations establish a useful performance criterion for 
assessing instrument stability. The proposed procedures and tests are not limited to DOSI; rather, they are intended 
to provide methods to characterize performance of any instrument used in translational optical imaging. © The

1 Introduction 
A variety of diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) methods for the detection, diagnosis, and clinical 
management of breast cancer are currently under investigation in clinical studies. DOSI, which employs near-
infrared light, is a thick-tissue functional method capable of quantifying tissue oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, water, 
and bulk lipid concentration.1 Recent applications of diffuse optical methods in breast cancer include monitoring 
chemotherapy2–7 or hormonal therapy,8 assessing breast density,9–11 identifying tumors in dense breast tissue,12 and 
differential diagnosis.13–15 
In April 2011, we initiated the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN)-6691 trial 
(ACRIN-6691) to test the effectiveness of DOSI to predict the final pathologic response of breast tumors in patients 
treated with neoadjuvant (i.e., presurgical) chemotherapy (NAC).5 Sixty breast cancer patients receiving  NAC  
were  measured  longitudinally using DOSI in six clinical research centers across the United States: Dartmouth 
College, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), University of California 
Irvine (UCI), University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and University of Pennsylvania (Upenn).

Prior to study activation, five identical DOSI platforms were distributed to all sites, excluding MDACC, 
which joined the study about 1.5 years later. An updated, miniaturized version of the DOSI instrument was 
delivered to MDACC. To prevent introducing additional variation, only data from the five identical instruments that 
were built simultaneously are compared in this study. Instrument calibration tools consisted of identical optical 
reflectance standards and breast tissue-simulating phantoms fabricated from the same batch of polysiloxane 
materials. Procedures and methods for instrument quality control, calibration operating procedures, and patient 
measurement protocols were adopted and revised from a previous multicenter breast cancer imaging study 
established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Network for Translational Research Optical Imaging.16 These 
methods were designed to be simple to perform by any trained operator and incorporate redundant mechanisms to 
assure good data quality, such as multiple calibration steps and premeasurement system checks. The lead site (UCI) 
provided all operators with comprehensive training materials, including standard operating manuals and videos,17 
and several on-site measurement training sessions using human subjects. To ensure a consistently high level of 
operator performance, we offered support before, during, and after patient measurements and provided operator 
feedback in response to the observed data quality. Postcollection, data were sent to the lead site for quality control 
and processing using standardized methods.  
To compare longitudinal measurements from multiple patients across sites, platforms, and operators, we 
developed a systematic approach for assessing the impact of three major potential sources of variability on DOSI 
accuracy and precision over the 2-year study duration: (1) calibration phantoms, (2) instrument performance, and (3) 
multiple operators. Starting with the test case of 1operator running 1 instrument using 1calibration phantom, we 
evaluate how each potential source of error contributes to overall DOSI performance. Results are presented across 
the five different sites and three relevant time frames:  the duration of a patient measurement session (∼1 h), the 
duration of the chemotherapy treatment (∼4 months), and the entire study time frame (2 years). 
 
2 Materials and Methods 
2.1 Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging Instrumentation 
A description of the basic components of the DOSI instrument has been previously presented.18,19 Briefly, DOSI 
consists of broadband frequency-domain photon migration (FDPM) combined with broadband time-independent 
near-infrared spectroscopy (CW-NIRS). This provides absorption and reduced scattering spectra in centimeter-thick 
tissues from 650 to 1000 nm. The FDPM component uses six laser diodes (Blue Sky Research, Sanyo, Mitsubishi) 
at the wavelengths 660, 680, 785, 810, 830, and 850 nm that are coupled into a fiber bundle and delivered to a 
handpiece that contacts the tissue. The breast is illuminated sequentially by each laser diode, which is intensity 
modulated at 601 modulation frequencies from 50 to 600 MHz. Phase and amplitude are measured from three 
averaged frequency sweeps for a total of ∼200 ms per laser diode. The diffusely reflected scattered light propagates 
through tissue and is detected by an avalanche photodiode (Hamamatsu module C5658) mounted inside a 
temperature-controlled hand-held probe. The CW-NIRS component uses a high-intensity tungsten–halogen source 
(Ocean Optics model HL-2000-HP-FHSA) to illuminate the tissue. The diffusely scattered broadband light that 
propagates through the tissue   is detected by a grating-based spectrometer that collects light from 650 to 1000 nm 
(1024 pixels, BWTek model 611E). The FDPM and CW-NIRS sources are coupled by independent optical fibers 
mounted into the hand-held probe. The source– detector separation was 22 mm (phantom measurement) or 28 mm 
(breast measurement) for both FDPM and CW-NIRS components with fibers placed in an overlapping geometry.20 
A typical DOSI measurement for the Network Analyzer-based instrument used in this study requires a total of 2 
to 5 s per scan location and is composed of three averaged FDPM sweeps of 601 modulation frequencies and time-
integrated broadband CW reflectance spectra.  
FDPM and CW-NIRS data are combined using a diffusion theory model to provide broadband absorption 
(μa) and reduced scattering (μsʹ) spectra from 650 to 1000 nm. In the FDPM measurement, the phase and amplitude 
of the detected light are recorded as functions of source modulation frequency and fit to a diffusive model of light 
transport with semi-infinite boundary conditions to recover μa and μsʹ at each of the six laser wavelengths. CW-
NIRS broadband reflectance spectra were converted into absolute absorption spectra using two steps. First, as per 
Mie scattering theory, the spectral shape of the reduced scattering spectrum is assumed to follow a power law of the 
form μsʹ = Aμ−sp, where A is the scatter amplitude and sp is the scatter power or the exponent of the reduced 
scattering spectrum. The power-law fit to the FDPM discrete laser diode spectrum provides a scatter correction for 
the CW-NIRS reflectance spectrum. We then fit the CW-NIRS reflectance intensity at each of the laser diode 
wavelengths to the reflectance calculated from the FDPM-measured absolute absorption values. Thus, the CW-
  
NIRS reflectance spectrum intensity is quantitatively scaled using the FDPM discrete μa measurements. The 
absolute absorption spectrum is then extracted by fitting the corrected reflectance spectrum to a diffusion 
reflectance model.18  
A picture of the DOSI instrument used in this study is shown in Fig. 1(a). The calibration tools of the DOSI 
instrument are shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). It consists of a solid tissue-simulating phantom [Fig. 1(b)], which is 
used to measure the FDPM instrument response function (IRF) (explicitly, phase offsets, and amplitude scale 
factors), and a reflectance standard for the broadband wavelength calibration [Fig. 1(c)]. The FDPM IRF 
measurement is similar to “blanking” performed in a conventional spectrophotometer; using a known attenuation 
(such as air), one can remove instrument artifacts such as wave-length-dependent detector responses. In the case of 
the FDPM calibration, the tissue-simulating phantoms have known μa and μsʹ values, such that the phase and 
amplitude changes due to tissue (or sample) can be separated from the IRF. In the case of the broadband 
wavelength calibration, a standard spectralon reflectance standard (Labsphere) is used to correct the wave-length-
dependent variations caused by the light source, detector response, and optical fiber throughput. 
 
2.2 ACRIN-6691 Trial—Protocol and Study Design 
The ACRIN-6691 trial was designed to evaluate the sensitivity of DOSI to monitor and predict the pathologic 
response of breast tumors in patients treated with NAC.5 The long-term goal is to provide oncologists with a simple, 
risk-free bedside tool that can be used to inform medical decisions. These include modifying or adapting the 
chemotherapy regimen, duration, and timing of surgery to maximize therapeutic response and minimize 
unnecessary toxicity. 
A total of 60 breast cancer patients receiving NAC were measured longitudinally using the DOSI instrument 
in six different clinical sites. The five following sites, Dartmouth, MGH, UCI, UCSF, and Upenn used identical 
DOSI instruments. MDACC joined the study about 1.5 year after its activation and used a next generation 
instrument that was excluded from this analysis. The subjects were measured four times throughout NAC: base-line 
(pretreatment), early therapy (5 to 10 days after the initiation of the first cycle of the chemotherapy), midtherapy 
(halfway through the therapy protocol), and posttherapy (prior to surgery). For these patients, the typical 
chemotherapy length is 4 months.  
 
Fig. 1 (a) DOSI instrument and (b) and (c) illustrate the probe placed on the calibration phantom (FDPM calibration) 
and on the reflectance standard (broadband calibration), respectively. 
  
2.3 Solid Phantom and Reflectance Standard—Calibration and Testing 
Each ACRIN site possessed one broadband reflectance standard and two solid tissue-simulating optical phantoms, 
Ph-A and Ph-B. The Ph-A phantoms, fabricated at UCI, were issued from the same fabrication batch specifically 
for the purpose of the ACRIN study. The specifics of these phantoms, including the fabrication process, have been 
previously published.21 The Ph-B phantoms were developed by Institut National d'Optique, Inc. (Quebec, Canada). 
The phantoms within a Ph series are expected to have the same optical properties as they were fabricated from the 
same batch. All phantoms have similar optical properties as breast tissue. The Ph-A and Ph-B phantoms were 
arbitrarily chosen to calibrate the FDPM instrument response during patient measurements and used as an 
additional calibration phantom for instrument testing, respectively. Measuring the IRF each session corrects any 
possible IRF changes between measurements. To determine IRF, the optical properties of the reference phantom 
must be known, and these were derived from comprehensive series of multidistance, multifrequency, broadband 
measurements, a standard procedure that, assuming phantom homogeneity, utilizes the distance-dependent phase 
and amplitude behavior to calculate optical properties.21,22 
The solid phantoms are contained in a custom-made case, as shown Fig. 1(b). Figure 1(c) shows the 
reflectance standard used to calibrate the broadband part of the instrument. A mask at the top of the phantom case 
and the reflectance standard is designed to limit placement error by helping the operator to repeatedly position the 
probe on the same location.21 
Three sets of three calibration measurements using the two phantoms and the reflectance standard were 
performed for every patient measurement. These calibration measurements were acquired immediately before, 
midway through, and after each breast patient measurement. Iterating the three calibration measurements throughout 
the measurement session serves two purposes: (1) securing a robust, redundant calibration dataset and (2) assessing 
instrument performance throughout the session by monitoring the optical properties of a fixed phantom over time. 
 
2.4 Data Analysis 
Several phantom measurement procedures were designed to test instrument performance. These procedures 
consisted of repeat measurements either of the same phantom or of different phantoms and in various conditions. 
We report the results of these tests using the standard deviation (Stdev) of these series of measurements and the 
normalized standard deviation (NSD), which is defined as the Stdev/mean and reported in percent (%). In case of 
broadband data, we first obtain the Stdev and NSD at all wavelengths of the spectrum and report their spectral 
average, minimum, maximum, and median. 
 
3 Results 
3.1 Methodology to Assess Uncertainties for the ACRIN-6691 Study 
Figure 2 presents the overview of the methodology used to assess the uncertainties in the context of the ACRIN-
6691 study. Uncertainties originate from three main sources: phantom, instrument, and operator. Factors

Table 1 Description of the different tests performed for each condition in the context of the validation and 
standardization process of the ACRIN-6691 study. The number of scans refers to independent measurements of 
combined FDPM and CW-NIRS consisting of multiple temporal and spectral sweeps and lasting 2 to 5 s per scan 
(see Sec. 2.1). 
 
contributing to each of these include, but are not limited to, (1) phantom material consistency, shelf life, and spatial 
uniformity, (2) instrument warm up, stability, reproducibility, and environmental effects, and (3) procedural 
consistency, probe operation, and positioning by different operators. To understand the relative contributions from 
each of these sources, we grouped the DOSI calibration data into five main conditions. The variability in calibration 
data across all conditions (A through E) in Fig. 2 is potentially a sum of all these factors. 
The first, condition A, examines the DOSI platform performance with one operator, one phantom, and one 
instrument, which is the most favorable situation in terms of potential sources of uncertainty. Conditions, B, C, and 
D, consecutively, assess the study uncertainties by varying one of the three test parameters, operator, phantom, and 
instrument, respectively, and holding two parameters constant. For example, condition B examines multiple 
operators (N) with one instrument and one phantom, while C examines multiple phantoms (N) with one operator 
and one instrument, etc. Condition E combines the contribution of all sources to DOSI measurement error by 
examining the performance of all instruments, all phantoms and with several operators. Multiple measurements and 
time periods were used to characterize each of the five main test conditions. A brief summary and description of 
each test for the five main conditions is provided in Table 1. 
 
3.2 Condition A: One Operator, One Phantom, and One Instrument 
Placement and short-term instrument stability tests were conducted on the DOSI instrument at UCI using a Ph-A 
phantom. For the placement test, test A1, the phantom was measured for nine consecutive times, removing and 
replacing the probe between each measurement over 1 h, which is the typical patient measurement session duration. 
For the instrument stability test, test A2, a Ph-A phantom was measured continuously every minute over a 1-h 
period with the probe fixed onto the phantom. For both the placement and 1-h stability tests, tests A1 and A2, the 
broadband deviations were found to be lower than 0.0010 mm−1 for absorption and 0.01 mm−1 for reduced 
scattering coefficients (data not shown). 
Instrument stability was also investigated over a longer time frame to determine the potential impact of 
variations over the course of chemotherapy, test A3. Measurements of a Ph-A phantom using the DOSI instrument at 
  
UCI were acquired by the same operator at the four study time-points over 4 months (typical time of chemotherapy 
treatment at UCI). This corresponded to nine scans per time-point, resulting in a total of 36 scans. Figure 3 and 
Table 2 provide the resulting deviations in broadband optical properties. They ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0005 mm−1 
for absorption and from 0.01 to 0.03 mm−1 for reduced scattering coefficients. As shown in Fig. 3(a) inset, the 
greatest deviation in absorption occurred at day 1and did not seem to follow an increasing or decreasing pattern 
over time. 
 
3.3 Condition B: N Operators, One Phantom, and One Instrument 
The instrument stability was investigated on a Ph-A phantom over the 2-year duration of the study using the DOSI 
instrument at UCI, test B1. A total of 150 scans were performed by four different trained operators on 17 different 
days during these 2 years. The same Ph-B phantom was used to calibrate the instrument response of all 
measurements. The resulting deviations in broadband absorption and reduced scattering are presented in Table 3 
and Fig. 4. The deviations ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0007 mm−1 in absorption and from 0.01 to 0.03 mm−1 in 
reduced scattering coefficients. 
 
3.4 Condition C: One Operator, N Phantoms, and One Instrument 
Using the DOSI instrument at UCI, one operator measured each phantom three times from the series of Ph-A 
phantoms to validate their uniformity, test C1. The phantoms were manufactured from the same batch and, thus, 
should have the same optical properties. Figure 5 provides the broadband optical properties from these compiled

measurements, and Table 4 summarizes the Stdevs and coefficient of variation averaged over the whole spectral 
range (650 to 1000 nm). The broadband deviations within the series of Ph-A phantoms were found below 0.0003 
and 0.01 mm−1 in absorption and in reduced scattering, respectively. 
Overall, the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were found to be similar among a series, which is 
consistent with the fact that they were fabricated in the same batch. 
 
3.5 Condition D: One Operator, One Phantom, and N Instruments 
The optical properties recovered from a Ph-A phantom measured using the different DOSI instruments across sites 
were compared. These measurements were performed by a single operator who traveled to the sites with a Ph-A 
phantom and an additional calibration phantom. 
Figure 6 presents the recovered optical properties of Ph-A phantom from all sites. Similar absorption and 
reduced scattering coefficients were recovered by all instruments. The absorption spectra recovered at Upenn 
showed the largest disagreement compared to the other sites, specifically below 750 nm. Overall, the broadband 
deviations in absorption and in reduced scattering within the different instruments ranged from <0.0001 to 0.0010 
mm−1 and from 0.01 to 0.02 mm−1, respectively (see Table 5). 
 
3.6 Condition E: N Operators, N Phantoms, and N Instruments 
The optical properties recovered from the Ph-A phantoms measured at their respective sites by the site-specific 
operator were compared, test E1. The deviations between the broadband- measured absorption and reduced 
scattering coefficients of the Ph-A phantoms range from 0.0001 to 0.0010 mm−1 and from to 0.02 mm−1, 
respectively, see Table 6. The largest deviations in broadband absorption recovery originate from the lower 
wavelength range of the spectra, below 760 nm, see Fig. 7.   As for condition D, this phenomenon is particularly 
visible for the data acquired at Upenn.

sites by a single operator, test D1. 
 
Last, we compared optical properties recovered from all Ph-A phantoms measured at their respective sites 
by the on-site operators throughout the 2-year study duration, test E2. This corresponded to a total of 480 scans 
acquired on 58 different days by 18 different operators on the five different instruments; the resulting absorption 
and reduced scattering spectra are shown in Fig. 8. This situation represents the worst-case scenario in term of 
uncertainties, as it involved measurements on multiple Ph-A phantoms, by many different operators, using multiple 
instruments, over a 2-year period. Note that different Ph-B phantoms (the ones specific to the site) were also used to 
calibrate the instrument response of these measurements. The deviations between the broadband-measured 
absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of the Ph-A phantoms measured at their sites range from 0.0003 to 
0.0010 mm−1 and from to 0.06 mm−1, respectively, see Table 7.

4 Discussion 
ACRIN-6691 is a multicenter trial of DOSI, an experimental imaging technology, used longitudinally to measure 
tumor functional changes during presurgical NAC. Because each patient measurement lasts up to ∼4 months, and 
quantitative DOSI endpoints are used to predict the clinical outcome, it is essential that we develop new methods 
for assessing overall instrument accuracy and precision over the entire 2-year study period. As a result, we have 
devised a series of standardized tissue phantoms and procedures for evaluating the impact of different potential 
sources of uncertainly in DOSI measurements: variability between different instruments, operators, and calibration 
standards (tissue phantoms). These methods are designed to define the level of accuracy and precision required for 
  
 
a multicenter study over several clinically relevant time frames: (1) 1 h, corresponding to the duration of a single 
patient measurement session, (2) several months, corresponding to the duration of the chemotherapy treatment, and 
(3) 2 years, corresponding to the duration of the study. The uniformity of a set of phantoms was validated, and the 
instruments were compared across all operators and sites. These studies are essential for determining the origins of 
DOSI performance variations and understanding how experimental methods such as DOSI compare to other 
radiologic approaches. 
During a typical 1-h DOSI imaging session, three sets of three phantom measurements are acquired: before 
scanning the tumor breast, between scanning the tumor and normal breasts, and after scanning the normal breast. 
We simulated this in condition A by removing and replacing the DOSI probe on the Ph-A phantom nine times over 
a 1-h period, test A1. DOSI instrument stability over a typical patient measurement time frame was also evaluated 
by measuring a Ph-A phantom every minute for 1 h using one instrument and one operator, without removing the 
probe from the phantom, test A2. During these two different hour-long tests, the NSDs recovered for broadband 
absorption and reduced scattering were found to be lower than 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively. The DOSI instrument 
is thus highly stable over the duration of a typical patient measurement session, and removal/replacement of the 
probe on a test object has a negligible impact on optical property measurements of well-defined phantoms. This 
suggests highly reproducible probe placement on phantoms, good phantom homogeneity, and appropriate warm-up 
of the instrument. Similar results were found for the DOSI instruments at the other sites.21

over 2 years across the five sites by 18 different operators, test E2. The black line shows the average spectra. The gray 
lines show the range (min–max) of spectra.  
 
To assess single instrument performance over the chemotherapy treatment time frame with one operator and 
one phantom, DOSI instrument stability was tested by measuring a Ph-A phantom four times over 4 months, test 
A3. Nine measurements were acquired at each time-point for a total of 36 phantom measurements. Over these 4 
months, the deviations in broadband absorption and reduced scattering were lower than 0.0005 mm−1 (NSD = 
8.3%) and 0.03 mm−1 (NSD = 2.1%), respectively.  There was no increasing or decreasing trend observed in these 
deviations over time. This suggests that the variations observed between these measurements are unlikely due to a 
  
 
time-related drift of the phantom optical properties or of the instrument performance. In fact, as shown in the inset 
in Fig. 3(a), day 1 is the measurement that contributes most to the deviation. The origin of this disagreement in the 
optical properties measured at day 1 is unknown. It is possible that this is related to the warm-up of the DOSI 
instrument (typically about 15 min). Ambient conditions, such as room temperature and their impact on instrument 
noise, were likely responsible for the rest of the variations at days 16, 55, and 126.  
We then explored the performance of the DOSI platform involving multiple operators, one phantom, and 
one instrument (condition B). DOSI instrument stability was tested over the study time frame by comparing the 
recovered optical properties of the calibration measurement on a Ph-A phantom obtained at all baseline patient 
measurements performed at UCI with four different operators. Over a period of 2 years and including 150 phantom  
scans,  the  deviations  in  broadband  absorption and reduced scattering were found to be lower than 0.0007 mm−1 
(NSD = 8.9%) and  0.03 mm−1  (NSD =  2.5%),  respectively.  These deviations are similar to those observed over 4 
months with a single operator, suggesting that DOSI measurements are operator independent when performed on 
stable tissue phantoms. In addition to the causes of variation previously mentioned for the other tests, the shelf life 
of the phantom may contribute to these errors. 
In condition C, we tested the performance of the DOSI platform involving one operator, multiple phantoms, 
and one instrument. The uniformity of the series of phantoms (Ph-A) was assessed at UCI by comparing the 
average of three measurements on each phantom. The phantom series is expected to have the same optical 
properties as it was fabricated from the same mixture. We obtained averaged deviations in recovered broadband 
absorption and reduced scattering under 0.0002 and 0.01 mm−1, corresponding to NSD of 2.1% and 0.9%, 
respectively. Compared to the repeatability measurements done using only a single phantom (test A1), similar 
deviations were observed in condition C with respect to reduced scattering, and slightly greater deviations were 
observed in the absorption (NSD of 2.1% and 1.4%, for test C1 and A1, respectively). The silicon material used for 
fabricating phantoms is viscous before curing, which could potentially lead to some material inconsistency, resulting 
in some spatial heterogeneity among phantoms from the same batch. However, the low deviations observed within 
the Ph-A phantoms demonstrate uniformity between these phantoms fabricated from the same batch. 
We then explored the performance of the DOSI platform involving one operator, one phantom, and all 
instruments (condition D). While the primary aim of ACRIN-6691 involves measuring relative changes in DOSI 
values during NAC, the secondary aim involves evaluating absolute values at specific time-points. It is thus 
important in the context of a multicenter study to be able to confidently compare quantitative tissue measurements 
across all subjects and all sites. The average optical properties recovered between the different instruments were 
compared on a single phantom measured three times at all sites by a unique operator over a period of 1 week. The 
observed deviations between sites on this single phantom were ranged from 0.0004 to 0.0010 mm−1 (NSD ranging 
from 0.6% to 11.1%) for the broadband absorption and 0.01 to 0.02 mm−1 (NSD ranging from 1.2% to 1.8%) for 
the broadband reduced scattering. These results suggest that all DOSI instruments are comparable in terms of their 
ability to recover optical properties. We then repeated this test by involving multiple operators, all phantoms, and 
all instruments (condition E). The interinstrument variability was assessed on the Ph-A phantoms at each site and 
measured by the on-site operator. The deviations between sites using their respective Ph-A phantoms were similar 
to the deviations obtained in condition D using a single phantom and operator: below 0.0010 mm−1 (NSD = 10.8%) 
for the broadband absorption and 0.02 mm−1 (NSD = 1.8%) for the broadband reduced scattering. These results 
suggest that all DOSI instruments are comparable in terms of optical property recovery even when different 
operators and phantoms are involved. 
Last, we determined the performance of the DOSI platform involving 18 operators, all phantoms, and all 
instruments over the 2-year study duration (condition E). This test consisted of 480 measurements of any of the Ph-
A phantoms across 58 different days over 2 years. The resulting deviations were below 0.0010 mm−1 (NSD = 
10.3%) for the broadband absorption and 0.06 mm−1 (NSD = 4.7%) for the broadband reduced scattering. This 
represents the worst-case scenario in terms of uncertainties as many operators, all phantoms, and all instruments 
were involved over a 2-year time frame. 
In conditions D and E, the greatest variation between instruments occurred below 760 nm and was 
particularly noticeable in the Upenn data. Later experiments suggested that this was due to a greater-than-expected 
variation in the spectrometer response in this spectral region caused by the reflectance calibration approach. A new 
spectrometer and calibration method has already been implemented in the next generation of instruments to mitigate 
this variation. We decided to keep the current spectrometers in the five instruments in use until the end of the study 
for consistency with already acquired subject data. 
  
 
Although instrument performance was evaluated in the context of DOSI technology in ACRIN-6691, this 
general framework can be adapted to other experimental imaging technologies. As shown in Fig. 2, the first step is 
to identify the origin of uncertainties, which can vary depending on the instrumentation used. These sources of 
variation must then be isolated and assessed separately in the context of the study procedures. After the single 
sources of variation have been assessed, their combined effect can be addressed. Though the details of the tests will 
vary depending on the imaging technique and the study protocol, the proposed framework can be broadly used to 
characterize instrument performance in translational optical imaging studies as has been extensively reported in the 
positron emission tomography community.23,24  
In conclusion, we have presented a methodology to assess performance uncertainties in an experimental 
imaging technology that was used in quantitative longitudinal measurements of patients over a 2-year period. The 
impact of multiple phantoms and operators, and intra- and interinstrument variability has been addressed separately 
and jointly. Using this approach, we have determined that despite 480 DOSI measurements acquired by 18 
operators at five research sites over 2 years (58 measurement days), the resulting deviations were on average 0.0005 
mm−1 (NSD = 7.0%) for the broadband absorption and 0.03 mm−1  (NSD = 3.1%) for the broadband reduced 
scattering.  These data can be used to identify and minimize sources of error and potentially improve DOSI 
sensitivity to small changes in tumor physiology. In addition, the methodology we describe can be readily adapted 
and applied to other experimental imaging technologies undergoing evaluation in multicenter settings. However, 
additional analysis is required to assess the precise relationship between these sources of variation and relevant 
clinical decision-making thresholds.
