Abstract
BACKGROUND—In response to rising rates of opioid abuse and overdose, U.S. states enacted 
laws to restrict the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances. The effect of these laws on 
opioid use is unclear.
METHODS—We tested associations between prescription-opioid receipt and state controlled-
substances laws. Using Medicare administrative data for fee-for-service disabled beneficiaries 21 
to 64 years of age who were alive throughout the calendar year (8.7 million person-years from 
2006 through 2012) and an original data set of laws (e.g., prescription-drug monitoring programs), 
we examined the annual prevalence of beneficiaries with four or more opioid prescribers, 
prescriptions yielding a daily morphine-equivalent dose (MED) of more than 120 mg, and 
treatment for nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose. We estimated how opioid outcomes varied 
according to eight types of laws.
RESULTS—From 2006 through 2012, states added 81 controlled-substance laws. Opioid receipt 
and potentially hazardous prescription patterns were common. In 2012 alone, 47% of beneficiaries 
filled opioid prescriptions (25% in one to three calendar quarters and 22% in every calendar 
quarter); 8% had four or more opioid prescribers; 5% had prescriptions yielding a daily MED of 
more than 120 mg in any calendar quarter; and 0.3% were treated for a nonfatal prescription-
opioid overdose. We observed no significant associations between opioid outcomes and specific 
types of laws or the number of types enacted. For example, the percentage of beneficiaries with a 
prescription yielding a daily MED of more than 120 mg did not decline after adoption of a 
prescription-drug monitoring program (0.27 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −0.05 to 
0.59).
CONCLUSIONS—Adoption of controlled-substance laws was not associated with reductions in 
potentially hazardous use of opioids or overdose among disabled Medicare beneficiaries, a 
population particularly at risk.

 States have responded to rising rates of prescription-opioid overdose by adopting laws that 
restrict the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances. In 2010, after the adoption 
of many new controlled-substance restrictions, rates of prescription-opioid overdose dipped 
slightly before reaching a historic high in 2014.1–3 The relationship between legal 
restrictions and prescription-opioid use remains unclear, because previous research evaluated 
one or two laws, short time periods, or few states.4–6 Comprehensive national analyses of 
controlled-substance restrictions and prescription-opioid use do not yet exist.
Successful regulation of prescription opioids involves a difficult balance. Well-designed laws 
may reduce misuse and overdose. However, laws may also obstruct compassionate pain 
management and increase provider burden.7 Moreover, heavily promoted strategies, such as 
prescription-drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), are expensive to implement.8 
Understanding the correlates of controlled-substance laws may help to promote safe, 
effective use of opioid analgesics and inform state investments.
To understand the relationship between state controlled-substance restrictions and the 
behaviors that they target, we examined associations between prescription-opioid outcomes 
and eight types of controlled-substance restrictions over a period of 7 years in a large 
national sample of patients. Our population consisted of disabled Medicare beneficiaries 
younger than 65 years of age, half of whom use opioids in a given year.2
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
For each calendar year 2006 through 2012, we created cohorts from a random 40% sample 
of all Medicare beneficiaries (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org). Cohorts included beneficiaries 21 to 64 years of age, from 50 
U.S. states and the District of Columbia, who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare 
Parts A, B, and D (inpatient, outpatient, and prescription benefits) and were alive throughout 
the calendar year. Because controlled-substance restrictions are not designed to curb 
prescriptions for pain at the end of life, we excluded patients with cancer diagnoses or end-
stage renal disease or who were receiving hospice care (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
OUTCOMES — FILLING OF OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS AND NONFATAL OVERDOSE 
EVENTS
Using Medicare claims, we created annual measures indicating whether a beneficiary filled 
an opioid analgesic prescription in every calendar quarter in a given year (long-term receipt) 
or in one to three calendar quarters (non–long-term receipt), filled prescriptions from four or 
more prescribers, and filled prescriptions that resulted in a daily morphine-equivalent dose 
(MED) of more than 120 mg in any calendar quarter (for opioid conversion factors used to 
compute the MED, see Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).2 The last two measures 
are associated with opioid overdose.9–14 We measured nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose 
on the basis of primary or secondary diagnosis codes in emergency department and inpatient 
claims, excluding heroin overdose (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).10 To address

 possible correlation across outcomes and to increase statistical precision, we developed a 
measure — potentially adverse opioid outcomes — that was equal to the sum of long-term 
receipt, a daily MED of more than 120 mg, four or more prescribers, and nonfatal 
prescription-opioid overdose (range, 0 to 4).
STATE LAWS
Using state statutes, regulations, and existing surveys, the two authors at the UCLA School 
of Law constructed a data set of legal restrictions of controlled substances in all states and 
the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2012.15–19 (A spreadsheet of data on controlled-
substance laws by state and year as used in this study and information on each opioid-related 
outcome used in our study summarized by state and year are available at 
www.dartmouthdiffusion.org/opioids.php.) We included laws governing patients, 
prescribers, or dispensing pharmacists that involve quantitative prescription limits, patient 
identification requirements, requirements with respect to physician examination or 
pharmacist verification, doctor-shopping restrictions, PDMPs, requirements related to 
tamper-resistant prescription forms, and pain-clinic regulations (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). We coded states with an authorizing statute but no active PDMP 
as not having a PDMP.20 We measured state controlled-substance laws according to whether 
each of eight types of laws was operating throughout the year in that state; according to 
legislative intensity, the number of types of laws added since baseline (2006) in each year 
and state, coded as indicators (1, 2, or ≥3 types of laws added; 0 is the reference) to allow for 
nonlinear effects; and according to the number of types of laws (as a single continuous 
variable) in place in a given state and year (range, 0 to 8).
COVARIATES
Control variables included each beneficiary’s demographic characteristics in each year: sex, 
race, ethnic group,21 Medicaid enrollment, receipt of any Part D low-income subsidy as an 
indicator of poverty, and 5-year age categories. We used inpatient and outpatient claims to 
identify diagnoses of depression, serious mental illness, and alcohol abuse (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).22–24 We calculated individual-level prescription-drug 
Hierarchical Condition Category (RxHCC) risk scores25; this measure of expected 
prescription-drug spending is derived from administrative claims and is used by the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services to calculate risk-adjusted payments to prescription-drug 
plans.26 Given reported negative associations between deaths from prescription-opioid 
overdose and medical-marijuana laws, we controlled for state-level medical-marijuana 
laws.27,28
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
To quantify the magnitude of hazardous use of prescription opioids, we used National Death 
Index Plus data for 2008 (the latest available year) to compute 1-year rates of death due to 
prescription-opioid overdose, excluding deaths involving heroin (for the codes used to 
identify fatal opioid-related overdoses, see Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). We 
compared these rates with the 2008 rate of death from prescription-opioid overdose in the 
U.S. population.29

 We computed the annual unadjusted percentage of beneficiaries with each prescription-
opioid outcome. We fit logistic regressions of each opioid measure as a function of time-
varying individual types of laws operating in that year within a beneficiary’s state of 
residence, hypothesizing that state laws would be associated with lower values of each 
prescription-opioid outcome. Control variables included patient characteristics, year 
(indicators for each year 2007 to 2012) to account for time trends in opioid outcomes, and an 
indicator for state of residence. We used similar models, replacing individual types of laws 
with three variables indicating the number of types of laws added since 2006 (1, 2, or ≥3 
types of laws added; the reference group was 0 types added) in a given state and year.
We present 95% confidence intervals based on Huber–White adjusted standard errors, with 
the assumption that observations are independent across, but not within, states over time. 
Although this method does not explicitly account for beneficiary-level autocorrelation within 
states, accounting for individual autocorrelation yields similar findings (see the 
Supplementary Appendix for information on alternative models to account for correlation 
within individuals nested within states).
We performed two secondary analyses (results of these analyses are shown in the 
Supplementary Appendix). First, we fitted the logistic-regression models described above to 
the subpopulation of long-term users of opioids, hypothesizing that associations with laws 
would be stronger in this group. Second, we plotted state-level changes in each opioid 
measure from 2006 through 2012 and the number of types of laws added from 2006 through 
2012, reporting the slope of the fitted line for each graph.
We report confidence intervals using two-tailed tests and a 0.05 significance level. For all 
tests of the primary hypothesis, we also report P values based on Benjamini–Hochberg 
adjustments for multiple comparisons; this accounts for the chance of a false positive, which 
increases with the number of hypotheses examined (for details of this adjustment, see the 
Supplementary Appendix).30,31
RESULTS
POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND PRESCRIPTION-OPIOID RECEIPT
In our sample of 2.2 million beneficiaries (8.7 million person-years), representing all 50 
states and the District of Columbia, the mean age was 49 years, and 49.7% were women 
(Table 1). On average, 45.4% of beneficiaries filled one or more opioid prescriptions in a 
given calendar year; 20.1% had long-term receipt of opioids and 25.3% had non–long-term 
receipt. In comparisons of beneficiaries with long-term receipt of opioids versus those with 
non–long-term receipt, a diagnosis of depression was more common (35.1% vs. 29.2%) and 
serious mental illness was less common (5.8% vs. 8.0%). The percentage of beneficiaries 
with four or more opioid prescribers was 7.5%, and 5.6% of the beneficiaries had a daily 
MED of more than 120 mg in one calendar quarter or more. In 2008, the rate of death from 
prescription-opioid overdose in our sample was nearly 10 times the U.S. rate (46.6 vs. 4.8 
per 100,000).

 ADOPTION OF CONTROLLED-SUBSTANCE RESTRICTIONS
State restrictions governing opioid prescribing and dispensing proliferated between 2006 and 
2012 (Fig. 1). Collectively, states added 81 controlled-substance laws; the mean (±SD) types 
of laws per state increased from 2.7±1.5 to 4.3±1.4. By 2012, all states had at least one type 
of laws and Florida had all eight types of laws. Some laws spread rapidly after 2006; for 
example, the percentage of beneficiaries governed by PDMPs doubled (from 43% to 85%), 
as did the percentage subject to requirements related to tamper-resistant prescription forms 
(from 30% to 62%). In contrast, only Vermont and Iowa added quantitative prescription 
limits, and four states each added doctor-shopping laws and pain-clinic regulations. Maps of 
controlled-substance restrictions in 2006 and 2012 show intense legislative activity in some 
states, such as Tennessee and Vermont (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Figure 2 
displays the unadjusted prevalence of prescription-opioid measures and nonfatal overdose in 
each year. Except for non–long-term receipt of opioids, the prevalence of each measure 
increased between 2006 and 2012. The prevalence of a daily MED of more than 120 mg 
peaked in 2010 at 6.1% before falling to 5.3% in 2012.
ESTIMATED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN OPIOID RECEIPT AND CONTROLLED-
SUBSTANCE RESTRICTIONS
There was little systematic association between individual types of controlled-substance 
laws and each of the opioid-related outcomes (Fig. 3, and Tables S6 through S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). For example, none of the four opioid-prescribing outcomes had 
significant associations with the two types of laws that were most broadly adopted during 
this period, PDMPs and requirements related to tamper-resistant prescription forms. In 
comparisons between years with operational PDMPs and those without them, the percentage 
of beneficiaries with four or more opioid prescribers declined little (−0.14 percentage points; 
95% confidence interval [CI], −0.42 to 0.14), and the percentage of beneficiaries with a 
daily MED of more than 120 mg did not decline (0.27 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.05 to 
0.59). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, P values were 0.80 and 0.45, respectively.
In comparisons between years with requirements related to tamper-resistant prescription 
forms and years without such requirements, the change in the percentage of beneficiaries 
with four or more opioid prescribers was −0.15 percentage points (95% CI, −0.41 to 0.12), 
and the change in the percentage of beneficiaries with a daily MED of more than 120 mg 
was 0.13 percentage points (95% CI, −0.22 to 0.48); P values were 0.68 and 0.82, 
respectively, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The lack of change in each opioid-
related outcome as laws proliferated is also evident in the smooth trend lines before and after 
law implementation (Fig. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The associations 
between individual types of laws and rates of nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose were not 
significant for any type of laws. For example, the percentage of beneficiaries with one or 
more events of nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose declined little (−0.02 percentage 
points; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.04; adjusted P = 0.89) after adoption of prescription-limit laws. 
This estimate and all other associations between nonfatal overdose and individual types of 
laws were not significant even without adjustment for multiple comparisons (Table S10 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

 In secondary analyses of beneficiaries with long-term receipt of prescription opioids, none 
of the individual types of laws had significant associations with the opioid measures (Fig. S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Opioid outcomes also varied little according to state 
legislative intensity (Fig. 4, and Tables S11 through S15 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Two measures were slightly lower in states adding three or more types of controlled-
substance laws after 2006, as compared with states adding no types of laws: long-term 
receipt of opioids (−1.01 percentage points; 95% CI, −1.75 to −0.27) and the percentage of 
beneficiaries with four or more opioid prescribers (−0.42 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.83 
to −0.01), although estimates were not significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons 
(P = 0.17 and P = 0.55, respectively). Rates of nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose were no 
lower in states with more legislative activity than in other states (Table S15 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The number of potentially hazardous opioid outcomes varied 
little according to the number of types of laws in a state, with estimated associations close to 
zero (−0.004; 95% CI, −0.008 to 0.0; adjusted P = 0.50) (Table S16 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Finally, to assess state-level variation during our study period, we plotted the state-level 
change in each opioid-related outcome against the number of types of laws added, 
measuring changes from 2006 to 2012 (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Variation 
in opioid outcomes within a group of states (e.g., all states adding two types of laws) was 
greater than the difference in opioid measures across groups.
DISCUSSION
Laws that restrict the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances showed few 
meaningful associations with the receipt of prescription opioids by disabled Medicare 
beneficiaries in our sample. States that adopted multiple laws between 2006 and 2012 (≥3 
types) had lower growth in long-term receipt of opioids and multiple opioid prescribers than 
states that adopted no laws. However, these associations were not significant after 
adjustment for the large number of hypotheses examined in this study. In addition, legislative 
restrictions showed no measurable association with the percentage of beneficiaries filling 
prescriptions that yield high daily opioid doses or the percentage treated for nonfatal 
prescription-opioid overdose.
The estimated rate of death due to prescription-opioid overdose in our sample, 46.6 per 
100,000, suggests that disabled Medicare beneficiaries accounted for nearly 1 in 4 deaths 
from prescription-opioid overdose nationwide in 2008. The scale of this estimate, combined 
with our finding of no significant association between legislative activity and nonfatal 
prescription-opioid overdose, should motivate renewed innovation to address misuse of 
prescription opioids.
Differences between our results and those of previous studies that showed negative 
associations between laws and prescription-opioid use may be explained by our 
comprehensive data and analyses. Although we, like others, used observational data, 
individual-level data permitted adjustments for patient characteristics. Furthermore, we 
considered multiple controlled-substance restrictions, examined a national rather than a

 regional population, and used a longitudinal study design to account for fixed differences 
across states and national trends in prescription-opioid use.4,5,8,32–36
These results are likely to disappoint state officials who are implementing laws to mitigate 
the unintended consequences of opioid analgesic use, but they also show the benefits of 
rigorous analyses. Administrative data such as those used here, paired with robust analysis, 
may reveal promptly the relationship between legislative efforts on targeted prescribing and 
dispensing behaviors and can be used to alter course and advance efforts to protect public 
health effectively and efficiently.
Indeed, efforts to leverage data promptly for the protection of the public are under way; the 
retail pharmacy company CVS CareMark has used data on prescription filling to establish 
specialty-specific benchmarks for controlled-substance prescribing. This approach permits 
identification of outlier prescribers who are worthy of examination and who may be 
excluded from CVS pharmacies if their prescribing behavior cannot be justified.37 Other 
payers may scrutinize prescriptions with real-time analyses of claims data. The Prescription 
Behavior Surveillance System launched in 2012, which collects data from participating state 
PDMPs to track prescription dispensing across states and time, offers another resource to 
monitor opioid prescribing.38
Our study has limitations. First, disabled fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who were 
alive throughout the calendar year have higher rates of opioid use, poverty, and coexisting 
complex medical conditions than the general U.S. population; our findings may not apply to 
other populations, among whom legal restrictions may be associated with patterns of 
prescription-opioid use and overdose.6 Yet, because disabled Medicare beneficiaries account 
for so many deaths from opioid overdose, this population is particularly in peril and could 
benefit from effective regulation.
Second, substantial legislative activity occurred after our study period, when more than 20 
states began requiring prescribers to consult the PDMP before prescribing controlled 
substances to new patients and at regular intervals thereafter.16,39 New laws and increased 
enforcement of existing laws may have improved the effectiveness of controlled-substance 
regulation. Third, the laws may become more effective over a longer period. Indeed, some 
laws, such as pain-clinic regulations, were new during our study period, and PDMPs are 
being adapted by states to enhance effectiveness. However, on average we observed laws for 
3.5 years after implementation, which suggests that legal solutions may influence opioid 
misuse and overdose slowly, if at all, in this population.
Fourth, our overdose data depend on the reliability of hospital and emergency department 
claims data. Although we cannot observe untreated overdoses, the ratio of nonfatal to fatal 
opioid overdose (6:1 in 2008) in our sample is similar to that found in previous research 
based on electronic medical records.10 Fifth, given a lack of significant associations, it is 
natural to question whether these analyses, driven by state-level changes in laws, had 
sufficient statistical power to yield meaningful insights. For conventional significance levels 
of 5%, the study had 90% power to detect declines in each measure of potentially hazardous 
opioid prescriptions and nonfatal overdose as small as 0.1 standard deviation. In other

 words, we had the ability to definitively rule out large changes in opioid measures associated 
with these laws. We cannot, however, rule out moderate-sized associations, because the 
lower boundary of the 95% confidence intervals sometimes reached 5 to 10% of the mean. 
In a few cases (e.g., estimated associations of opioid measures with prescription-limit laws), 
the lower boundary of the confidence intervals included estimated associations as large as 
20% of the mean, in relative terms.
Misuse of and overdose from opioid analgesics threaten public health. Yet we found that 
state laws that impose costly requirements on prescribers, pharmacists, and patients did not 
have meaningful associations with opioid use or adverse outcomes, at least in the vulnerable 
population that we studied. Financially stressed states may wish to invest resources in 
rigorous evaluation of current legislation. Existing administrative data could be used to 
develop opioid-prescribing measures that permit active monitoring and identify hazardous 
patterns early. Effective and safer alternatives for chronic pain management are needed, as is 
a comprehensive response to opioid addiction.40

 Figure 1. Percentage of Sample Medicare Beneficiaries 21 to 64 Years of Age Who Were Living 
in a State with Controlled-Substance Prescribing and Dispensing Laws, 2006–2012
With respect to 8 types of controlled-substance laws, the mean (±SD) types of laws per state 
increased from 2.7±1.5 (range, 0 to 6) in 2006 to 4.3±1.4 (range, 1 to 8) in 2012. 
Prescription limits, added by 2 states between 2006 and 2012, restrict the quantity 
dispensed. Prescription-drug monitoring programs, added by 19 states, collect data on 
controlled-substance dispensing for use by authorized personnel. Physician-examination 
restrictions, added by 12 states, require an established physician–patient relationship or 
physical examination before the prescription of controlled substances. Laws requiring 
tamper-resistant prescription forms were added by 19 states. Patient identification 
requirements, added by 13 states, mandate or permit pharmacists to ask for identification. 
Pharmacist-verification requirements, added by 8 states, prohibit pharmacists from 
dispensing controlled substances if there is suspicion that no doctor–patient relationship 
exists. Doctor-shopping restrictions, added by 4 states, prohibit patients from obtaining 
controlled substances through fraudulent behavior. Pain-clinic regulations, added by 4 states, 
affect the licensing and registration of prescribers.

 Figure 2. Trends in Annual Prescription-Opioid Measures, 2006–2012
Long-term receipt was defined as the filling of one or more opioid prescriptions in each 
calendar quarter in a given year, and non–long-term receipt was defined as receipt in one, 
two, or three quarters (Panel A). A daily morphine-equivalent dose (MED) of more than 120 
mg (Panel B) equals 1 when the daily MED (total quarterly MED divided by 91) exceeds 
120 mg in any quarter during the calendar year. Nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose 
(Panel C) excludes beneficiaries with any observed heroin overdose in the calendar year.

 Figure 3. Estimated Difference in Opioid Measures Associated with Individual Types of 
Controlled-Substance Laws
This figure shows adjusted estimates of the association between state-level controlled-
substance laws and measures of opioid receipt. We estimated marginal effects (the change in 
the predicted probability of the dependent variable was multiplied by 100 for ease of 
presentation) on the basis of individual-level logistic regressions of annual prescription-
opioid measures on time-varying individual types of laws in place in a given state in a given 
year, controlling for the state of residence, year indicators, and beneficiary characteristics. 
Variance estimates account for autocorrelation of observations within states over time with

 Figure 4. Estimated Difference in Opioid Measures Associated with Number of Types of State 
Controlled-Substance Laws Added since 2006
This figure shows adjusted estimates of the association between the number of types of 
state-level controlled-substance laws added since 2006 and measures of opioid receipt. We 
estimated marginal effects (the change in the predicted probability of the dependent variable 
was multiplied by 100 for ease of presentation) on the basis of individual-level logistic 
regressions of prescription-opioid measures on the time-varying number of types of laws 
added since 2006 (1, 2, or ≥3; 0 is the reference) in a beneficiary’s state of residence in a 
given year, controlling for the state of residence, year indicators, and beneficiary 
characteristics. Variance estimates account for autocorrelation of observations within states 
over time with the use of Huber–White sandwich estimators. Confidence intervals were 
estimated with the use of the delta method and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Long-term receipt was defined as the filling of one or more opioid prescriptions in each calendar quarter in a 
given year, and non–long-term receipt was defined as receipt in one, two, or three quarters. Our sample consisted of 2,227,610 unique beneficiaries. 
A total of 1,140,276 unique beneficiaries had non–long-term receipt of opioids during at least 1 year of our study period, and 611,955 unique 
beneficiaries had long-term receipt of opioids during at least 1 year of our study period. Because opioid-receipt status was measured at the person-
year level, any given person could fall into more than one category (no receipt of opioids, non–long-term receipt of opioids, and long-term receipt 
of opioids).
†Race or ethnic group was determined from the race-ethnicity variable in the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File.
‡The Medicare Part D low-income subsidy is a proxy measure of poverty, because recipients have income below 150% of the federal poverty level. 
Subsidy status was dichotomized as any versus none for this study.
§Prescription-drug Hierarchical Condition Category (RxHCC) risk scores are based on patient demographic characteristics and patient claims and 
are used to predict Part D prescription-drug spending for payment of prescription-drug plans. Higher values correspond to higher Part D capitated 
payments. In our sample, the minimum risk score was 0, and the maximum was 6.5.
¶Shown is the percentage of patients with one or more diagnosis in any year of full enrollment. Serious mental illness denotes bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other nonorganic psychoses.
