Health Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of Asymptomatic 
Screening for Hypertension and High Cholesterol and 
Aspirin Counseling for Primary Prevention
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Our aim was to update estimates of the health and economic impact of 
clinical services recommended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) for the comparative rankings of the National Commission on Preven-
tion Priorities, and to explore differences in outcomes by sex and race/ethnicity.
METHODS We used a single, integrated, microsimulation model to generate 
comparable results for 3 services recommended by the US Preventive Services 
Task Force: aspirin counseling for the primary prevention of CVD and colorectal 
cancer, screening and treatment for lipid disorders (usually high cholesterol), and 
screening and treatment for hypertension. Analyses compare lifetime outcomes 
from the societal perspective for a US-representative birth cohort of 100,000 
persons with and without access to each clinical preventive service. Primary 
outcomes are health impact, measured by the net difference in lifetime quality-
adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness, measured in incremental cost 
per QALY or cost savings per person in 2012 dollars. Results are also presented 
for population subgroups defined by sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS Health impact is highest for hypertension screening and treatment 
(15,600 QALYs), but is closely followed by cholesterol screening and treatment 
(14,300 QALYs). Aspirin counseling has a lower health impact (2,200 QALYs) 
but is found to be cost saving ($31 saved per person). Cost-effectiveness for 
cholesterol and hypertension screening and treatment is $33,800 per QALY and 
$48,500 per QALY, respectively. Findings favor hypertension over cholesterol 
screening and treatment for women, and opportunities to reduce disease burden 
across all services are greatest for the non-Hispanic black population.
CONCLUSIONS All 3 CVD preventive services continue to rank highly among 
other recommended preventive services for US adults, but individual priorities 
can be tailored in practice by taking a patient’s demographic characteristics and 
clinical objectives into account.

INTRODUCTION
I
n 1950 the rate of mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the 
United States was more than twice what it is today.1 Some of this reduc-
tion is attributable to new technologies and improvements in the treat-
ment of CVD, but as much as one-half is due to prevention efforts.2 Nev-
ertheless, CVD remains the leading cause of death and among the greatest 
causes of morbidity in the United States today.3,4 Each year, more than 1.2 
million first-time CVD events are suffered, and persons younger than 75 
years will die of a cardiovascular-related cause at approximately twice the 
rate of leading nations—a statistic that ranks 23rd among major countries.5 
Total direct and indirect costs of CVD are estimated to exceed $300 bil-
lion annually, and total direct medical costs are projected to triple by 2030, 
when more than 40% of the US population is projected to have some form 
of CVD.5,6 Indeed, despite prior successes, only a small percentage of the

US population meets criteria for ideal cardiovascular 
health,7 cholesterol and blood pressure management 
remain major sources of preventable burden,8 and siz-
able persisting disparities in CVD outcomes based on 
sex, race/ethnicity, and geography can be explained by 
disparities in cardiometabolic risk factors.9,10
Although the case for sustained and improved 
CVD prevention efforts would appear to be strong, a 
core focus of the National Commission on Prevention 
Priorities has been to evaluate and identify the relative 
value of primary prevention activities in the context of 
a wide spectrum of health conditions and diseases.11 In 
2006 the commission ranked using aspirin for the pri-
mary prevention of CVD, screening for lipid disorders, 
and hypertension screening—all 3 recommended with 
an A or B grade by the US Preventive Services Task 
Force (USPSTF)12-14—in the top one-half of clinical 
preventive services as measured by population health 
impact and cost-effectiveness.15 All 3 recommendations 
have since been updated by the USPSTF,16-18 pharmacy 
costs of treating cholesterol and blood pressure have 
seen sustained declines,19,20 the Million Hearts initia-
tive has been introduced,21 and CVD risk factor trends 
have continued to gradually evolve.22,23
In this study, we use microsimulation modeling to 
estimate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of 
these leading CVD clinical preventive services for an 
updated ranking24 and provide new data on the relative 
impact of these services among population subgroups 
defined by sex and race/ethnicity. Adequate under-
standing of the relative priority of these services in 
busy primary care offices requires updated estimates 
that reflect changes in population disease-risk profiles, 
costs, and the evidence base supporting the services. In 
addition, physicians who seek to tailor priorities to the 
demographics of their clinical practice or to individual 
patients need to understand the value of these services 
for specific population groups.
METHODS
Analyses in this study were conducted using the Health-
Partners Institute ModelHealth™: Cardiovascular Dis-
ease (ModelHealth: CVD) microsimulation model. Brief 
descriptions of how the preventive services are imple-
mented in the model and the model itself are described 
below, and comprehensive details of our methods are 
provided in the Supplemental Appendix, available at 
http://www.annfammed.org/content/15/1/23/suppl/DC1.
Aspirin Counseling to Prevent Cardiovascular 
Disease and Cancer
The USPSTF has substantially revised its recommen-
dations regarding aspirin counseling for the primary 
prevention of CVD and colorectal cancer.16,25,26 The 
Task Force now recommends use of low-dose aspirin 
among men and women aged 50 to 59 years with 10% 
or greater 10-year CVD risk (B recommendation). 
With its updated evidence review, aspirin is found to 
reduce the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and 
ischemic stroke—no longer differing by sex—and to 
lower the risk of colorectal cancer incidence after 10 
years of use (Table 1). The USPSTF review also reaf-
firmed aspirin’s role in increasing risk for major gastro-
intestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.
For our analysis, the proportion of persons for whom 
aspirin use is consistent with the new USPSTF recom-
mendation was estimated using data from the National 
Health Interview Survey.51 The per incident cost of 
CVD risk assessment and discussion regarding aspirin 
use is estimated to be $29.23, and the cost of a year’s 
supply of low-dose aspirin is estimated to be $18.23. We 
assume that a clinical screening test and discussion may 
occur up to 3 times between ages 50 to 59 years.
Cholesterol Screening
In 2008 the USPSTF updated its 2001 recommenda-
tion for lipid disorder screening among adults aged 
20 years and older.13,17 The Task Force found good 
evidence that drug therapy can significantly lower 
heart disease risk in persons with abnormal lipid lev-
els.59 The USPSTF recommends screening men aged 
35 years and older for lipid disorders regardless of risk 
factors (A recommendation) and men aged 20 to 35 
years (B recommendation) if they are at increased risk 
for heart disease. For women, the Task Force recom-
mends screening those aged 45 years and older (A 
recommendation) and those aged 20 to 45 years (B 
recommendation), in both cases, when at increased risk 
for heart disease. Upon detection of lipid disorders, 
standard treatment and management guidelines should 
be followed.17,61
For our analysis, the proportion of persons treating 
high cholesterol levels with medications as prescribed 
was estimated using data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (Table 1).52-
56 The efficacy of medications for treating lipid disor-
ders was estimated using data from large randomized 
controlled trials.33-41 The per incident cost of clinical 
screening and discussion regarding statin use is esti-
mated to be $55.56, and the annual medication cost is 
estimated to be $528.00. We assume that a cholesterol 
screening test may occur up to once every 5 years.
Hypertension Screening
In 2007 the USPSTF published a reaffirmation of its 
2003 A recommendation to screen for hypertension 
among all adults aged 18 years and older.14,18 The Task

Force found good evidence that treatment of high 
blood pressure in adults can substantially decrease risk 
of cardiovascular disease.61 Upon detection of high 
blood pressure, standard treatment and management 
guidelines should be followed.18,62
For our analysis, the proportion of persons treat-
ing blood pressure with medications as prescribed was 
estimated using data from NHANES (Table 1).52-56 
The efficacy of medications for treating hyperten-
sion was estimated from large randomized controlled 
trials.42-50 The per incident cost of a blood pressure 
screen for hypertension is estimated to be $29.23, and 
the annual medication cost is estimated to be $278.52. 
We assume blood pressure screening will occur annu-
ally for persons with a previously measured systolic 
blood pressure of at least 120 mm Hg and biannually 
for everyone else.

ing outcomes across a wide range of clinical preventive 
services recommended by the USPSTF and the Advi-
sory Committee on Immunization Practices.24,58 Disease 
outcomes include incidence of myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, 
intermittent claudication, diabetes, and CVD-related 
death, as well as for assessment of aspirin, incidence 
of colorectal cancer. Cardiovascular disease events are 
predicted by 1-year risk equations estimated specifically 
for the model from Framingham Heart Study data.63,64 
Event risk is based on a person’s age, sex, body mass 
index, systolic blood pressure, high- and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status, and history of 
CVD. Baseline colorectal cancer incidence is derived 
from US cancer surveillance data.65,66 Disease costs are 
estimated from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey57 
and published literature,67 with first-year and ongoing 
disease costs accounted for separately.
The annual progression of body mass index is 
derived from recall data reported in the Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System,68 and the natural 
history of systolic blood pressure and cholesterol is 
estimated using Framingham Heart Study data.63,64 
Tobacco initiation and cessation probabilities are 
derived from the National Health Interview Survey 
data69 and published estimates from longitudinal stud-
ies.70,71 Screening and treatment for hypertension and 
dyslipidemia in the model are consistent with national 
clinical guidelines,60,62 and identification and treat-
ment adherence patterns are consistent with the rates 
observed within NHANES.52-56 Use of antihyperten-
sive drugs and lipid-acting agents is modeled as an 
exogenous treatment effect on systolic blood pressure 
and cholesterol levels, respectively, and alters disease 
risk accordingly. Table 2 displays age-adjusted rates 
of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke for 
the baseline model population, stratified by sex and 
race/ethnicity, and compares them with their respec-
tive nationwide indicators.
Analysis Design
Analyses were conducted from the societal perspec-
tive, which includes patient time costs, and in accor-
dance with the reference case of the Panel on Cost-
effectiveness in Health and Medicine.75 All analyses 
compare outcomes for a simulated population—a 
100,000-person birth cohort with demographic and 
underlying health characteristics representative of the 
US population of persons aged 18 years—with access 
to a specified clinical preventive service to the same 
population, all else held equal, without access to this 
service. The acceptance rate of the clinical preventive 
service is assumed to be 90%.
Aspirin use affects the relative risk of myocardial 
infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, inci-
dence of colorectal cancer, major gastrointestinal bleed-
ing, and, in sensitivity analysis, CVD-related mortality. 
Screening and treatment for lipid disorders affects low- 
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Screen-
ing and treatment for hypertension affects systolic 
blood pressure. Key model parameters are summarized 
in Table 1, and the effectiveness of treatment is based 
on calibration to population risk profiles and event rates 
(Table 2) to account for typical adherence patterns.
Primary outcomes are health impact and cost-
effectiveness. Health impact is defined as the life-
time net difference, with and without the preventive

discount rate for calculating cost-effectiveness is 3%. 
Deterministic (one-way) sensitivity analyses of key 
parameters (Table 1) were conducted by replicating 
simulations with all other parameters, probabilities, and 
population characteristics held equal.
This study was granted an exemption by the 
HealthPartners Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Results from our base case analysis are summarized in 
Table 3. We estimate that aspirin counseling will save 
2,200 QALYs, cholesterol screening and treatment 
will save 14,300 QALYs, and hypertension screening 
and treatment will save 15,600 QALYs over the life-
time of a 100,000 person birth cohort in the United 
States. The health impact of the aspirin, cholesterol, 
and hypertension services when scaled to a typical US 
birth cohort size of 4,000,000 persons—also referred 
to as the “clinically preventable burden”76—would be 
approximately 88,000, 572,000, and 624,000 QALYs, 
respectively. We find that aspirin counseling is cost 
saving (–$31 per person), cholesterol screening costs 
$33,800 per QALY saved, and hypertension screening 
costs $48,500 per QALY saved.
The aspirin counseling service reaches the fewest 
people (15,600 thousand persons in a 100,000 person 
birth cohort, compared with 40,100 and 53,400 for 
cholesterol and hypertension screening, respectively) 
and thereby has a lower overall impact on prevent-
ing disease. Cholesterol and hypertension screening 
are very similar in prevention of overall CVD events 
(about 4,000 each) and mortality (about 1,000 each), 
but we find that hypertension screening prevents far 
more lifetime stroke events (1,020 vs 40) for this popu-
lation, contributing to the difference in health impact.
Costs of screening and treatment for the aspirin 
service are relatively small in comparison to averted 
disease, resulting in a net cost savings of $3.1 million 
over the lifetime of the birth cohort. For the choles-
terol and hypertension services, cost savings from 
averted disease are substantial—at about $35 million 
each—and exceed the costs of screening, but we esti-
mate the ongoing costs of treating and managing the 
conditions surpass $100 million in each case.
Table 3 also shows that population subgroup out-
comes can in many cases diverge in meaningful ways 
from the population average. For example, aspirin 
counseling is not expected to be cost saving for white 
and Hispanic women, primarily because of the small 
share (less than 2.5%) of these women expected to 
meet USPSTF criteria for routine aspirin use. More-

over, because of differences in CVD risk profiles at 
ages 50 to 59 years, approximately one-tenth of non-
Hispanic white and Hispanic women and one-half of 
non-Hispanic black women meet recommended guide-
lines for initiating use of aspirin for primary prevention 
compared with their male counterparts. Differences in 
risk factor and disease prevalence (Table 2) also help to 
explain why non-Hispanic black men and women are 
generally expected to see the largest benefits across all 
3 services, why men are shown to benefit more from 
cholesterol screening (which has a primary benefit in 
preventing heart disease), and why women overall are 
expected to benefit slightly more from hypertension 
screening (which also has substantial benefits in pre-
venting stroke, for which longer life expectancy con-
tributes to higher lifetime incidence in women77,78).
These trends are made even clearer in Table 4, 
which translates the results in Table 3 into a rela-
tive value ordering for the overall population and for 
each sex and race/ethnicity subgroup based on health 
impact or cost-effectiveness. In addition, Table 4 
includes two clinical outcome objectives most likely to 
resonate with patient preferences, the most prevented 
myocardial infarctions or strokes.79 Top services for 
these outcomes are clear: cholesterol screening has the 
most potential to prevent myocardial infarctions and 
hypertension screening has the most potential to pre-
vent strokes—for all groups.
Results of Sensitivity Analysis
Findings can vary substantially with alternative 
assumptions on key model parameters (Table 5). 
Results for the aspirin service are most sensitive over-
all, because of the uncertainty in the scale (eg, how 
much long-term use increases the relative risk for 
hemorrhagic stroke) and scope (eg, whether aspirin 
for primary prevention can reduce CVD mortality) of 
aspirin’s effects. Health impact estimates for aspirin 
counseling range from approximately 200 to 4,000 
QALYs, and cost-effectiveness in the worst case is 
about $92,000/QALY saved. Also noteworthy is the 
sensitivity in cost-effectiveness for cholesterol and 
hypertension screening associated with the cost of 
medications. If all patients were able to take advan-
tage of the lowest cost cholesterol and blood pressure 
drugs, cost-effectiveness could improve to nearly 
$5,000/QALY for cholesterol screening and $26,000/
QALY for hypertension screening.
DISCUSSION
The case for prevention can sometimes be a chal-
lenging one; benefits often accrue far in the future, 
and costs tend to be highest upfront. Nevertheless, 
our analysis indicates that clinical services for the 
primary prevention of CVD can avert substantial 
disease burden and potentially save costs. In our 
accompanying comparison across 
all clinical preventive services, 
estimates of health impact for 
a 100,000-person birth cohort 
range from 100 to 83,200 
(median = 2,900) QALYs, and esti-
mates of cost-effectiveness range 
from cost saving to $782,600 
(median = $36,800) per QALY 
saved.24 In this study, we find that 
initiation of aspirin use among 
adults at elevated CVD risk and 
aged 50 to 59 years has a moder-
ate health impact (2,200 QALYs) 
but is also among the few services 
expected to save costs overall. 
Screenings for lipid disorders 
and hypertension are among the 
top services for health impact (at 
14,300 and 15,600 QALYs, respec-
tively) and rank in the middle of 
the pack for cost-effectiveness (at 
$33,800 and $48,500 per QALY, 
respectively—both of which also 
compare favorably with the most 
commonly cited cost-effectiveness

thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY80). 
As a result, all 3 CVD services rank highly among 
other clinical preventive services, scoring at least 7 
of 10 possible points on combined health impact and 
cost-effectiveness.24
This comparative analysis is the first of its 
kind to use an integrated, validated microsimula-
tion model to estimate the lifetime impacts from 
USPSTF-recommended CVD prevention activities 
for a US-representative birth cohort, and this novel 
approach lends multiple strengths. The first strength 
is that microsimulation allows for the assessment of 
clinical services targeted to persons with specific 
characteristics, such as by age, sex, and underlying 
cardiovascular risk factors. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity 
are correlated with CVD risk profiles that may indicate 
both eligibility for a preventive service and the likeli-
hood of benefit from prevention activities. This rela-
tionship is most notably important for aspirin, where 
relatively few women aged 50 to 59 years (a ratio of 
1:5 compared with men) meet the 10% 10-year CVD 
risk threshold identified by the USPSTF, and across all 
services for the non-Hispanic black population, which 
tends to have greater CVD risk at younger ages com-
pared with other population groups.
As such, an important second benefit of our analysis 
is the stratification of results by population subgroups, 
and our analysis shows that a population-wide assess-
ment of prevention activities can mask notable dif-
ferences in the health impact and cost-effectiveness 
by sex and race/ethnicity. For example, contrary to 
our findings for the overall population (and for men), 
women are generally expected to benefit more from 
screening for hypertension than for dyslipidemia. Also 
notable is that cost savings of aspirin are not found 
for white and Hispanic women and that non-Hispanic 
black Americans have the greatest overall opportu-
nities for reducing disease burden. These stratified 
results support tailoring prevention priorities to indi-
vidual patient preferences and needs and highlight 
opportunities to reduce health disparities.
A third notable strength of our approach is that the 
microsimulation model used in our analysis accounts 
for the dynamics of competing risks among nonfatal 
and fatal CVD and other causes of death in quantify-
ing net benefits. The model also accounts for back-
ground use of other primary prevention activities and 
secondary prevention subsequent to a CVD event. 
When the first nonfatal CVD event of a simulated 
person is prevented or delayed as a result of a clinical 
preventive service, their use of aspirin, statins, and/
or antihypertensive medications for primary or sec-
ondary prevention also may be prevented or delayed. 
The prevention or delay of an initial nonfatal event 
also changes the risk of subsequent nonfatal and fatal 
events. This approach provides a more realistic esti-
mate of the marginal value of a clinical service for pri-
mary prevention relative to secondary prevention.
Our findings do not depart dramatically or unex-
pectedly from previous National Commission on 
Prevention Priorities rankings. Previously, cholesterol 
and hypertension screening scored highly for health 
impact and scored in the middle to lower half of ser-
vices for cost-effectiveness, as they still do.15,81 Aspirin 
counseling was similarly found to be cost-saving, but it 
also previously scored very highly for health impact.15 
The lower potential net health benefit from aspirin 
counseling in our analysis is largely a result of the sub-
stantially narrowed target population for the service in 
the current recommendation and the changes to the 
underlying evidence of aspirin’s benefits and harms, 
including lower expected effectiveness in preventing 
nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke—which no 
longer differ by sex—and accounting for fatalities from 
aspirin-induced bleeding.27,32,82,83
This study contributes to a broader evidence 
base that uses modeling to assess the incremental and 
comparative effectiveness of clinical services for the 
primary prevention of CVD. Direct comparisons are 
often difficult because of differing research questions 
and methods. For example, an analysis by Kahn and 
colleagues84 using the Archimedes model shares many 
similarities with ours—both use a single integrated 
microsimulation to evaluate individual CVD preven-
tion activities targeted to and treating person-level 
characteristics for the US population with concurrent 
use of other prevention activities at contemporary lev-
els—but results are difficult to compare because their 
evaluation was based on a cross-section of the US pop-
ulation over 30 years, estimated the marginal benefit 
of ideal prevention to current care, and did not include 
population screening costs. Similarly, other studies dif-
fer from ours in some of the following ways: they eval-
uate an increase in utilization or adherence to clinical 
preventive services from contemporary levels,85-94 the 
modeling unit is higher than person level (eg, popula-
tion cohort or system dynamics modeling),85-88,90-107 
the modeled population is cross-sectional rather than 
a birth cohort,* the modeled population is not US 
based,† the time horizon is less than lifetime,‡ results 
are not stratified by sex or race/ethnicity,§ and/or the 
evaluation focuses on the value of a single or combined 
composite CVD preventive service.** Nevertheless,

common threads across these evaluations include the 
sizable disease prevention potential for screening for 
and treating lipid disorders and hypertension and good 
cost-effectiveness for aspirin chemoprophylaxis.
The microsimulation model design and the results 
of these analyses are limited by the quality of data and 
evidence used to inform them. Our sensitivity analysis 
results indicate that health impact estimates are espe-
cially sensitive to the fidelity and adherence to treat-
ment plans for all services. Uncertainty in the efficacy 
of aspirin with respect to benefits and harms also limits 
the precision of our results. For patients treating lipid 
disorders or hypertension, the cost-effectiveness prop-
osition is highly dependent on the cost of medications. 
The marginal benefit of a clinical preventive service 
is also dependent on baseline risk factors and disease 
rates, but ModelHealth: CVD is shown to validate well 
with US data (Table 2).
Clinical prevention and practice recommendations, 
treatments, and effectiveness evidence are continu-
ally in flux. Since the conduct of these analyses, the 
USPSTF updated its recommendation for blood pres-
sure screening.110 In its update, the Task Force recom-
mends the use of ambulatory or home blood pressure 
monitoring before initiating treatment—a change 
that some evidence suggests could lower the overall 
cost of the service based on improved hypertension 
diagnosis.111,112 Practice guidelines for managing high 
cholesterol levels and hypertension have also recently 
been revised,113,114 although evidence is not yet clear 
how and whether clinical practice patterns have shifted 
as a result. Proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 
9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are emerging as a new drug 
class for the treatment of lipid disorders,115,116 and sev-
eral ongoing aspirin trials may reveal new benefits or 
harms.30,32, 117-120 The evolving environment will con-
tinue to affect the impact and value of clinical preven-
tive services for CVD.
Policy makers are often interested in prioritizing 
efforts and investments to increase prevention utiliza-
tion from contemporary rates. In cases where use is 
relatively high, such as with screening for hyperten-
sion and lipid disorders,121 incremental gains may be 
modest. Still, almost one-half of those with a diagnosis 
of hypertension do not meet recommended blood 
pressure goals,122 and our sensitivity analysis, along 
with the findings of others,84 indicates that major 
reductions in disease and cost burdens can be realized 
with improvements in treatment effectiveness. Our 
findings also highlight opportunities for closing gaps 
among populations for which persistent care access 
and quality disparities have hindered uptake of effec-
tive preventive services123-127 and advance the case 
toward a personalized approach to quantitative prior-
ity setting.128 Overall, our findings affirm that aspirin 
counseling for primary prevention and asymptomatic 
screening and treatment of hypertension and lipid dis-
orders should remain among the top prevention priori-
ties for adults in primary care.
