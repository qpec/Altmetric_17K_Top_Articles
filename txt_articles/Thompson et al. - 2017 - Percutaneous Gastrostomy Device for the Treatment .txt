OBJECTIVES: 
 
The AspireAssist System (AspireAssist) is an endoscopic weight loss device that is comprised of an 
endoscopically placed percutaneous gastrostomy tube and an external device to facilitate drainage 
of about 30% of the calories consumed in a meal, in conjunction with lifestyle (diet and exercise) 
counseling.
 
METHODS: 
 
In this 52-week clinical trial, 207 participants with a body-mass index (BMI) of 35.0–55.0 
kg/m 
2 
were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with AspireAssist plus Lifestyle Counseling 
( 
n 
=137; mean BMI was 42.2±5.1 
kg/m 
2 
) or Lifestyle Counseling alone ( 
n 
=70; mean BMI was 
40.9±3.9 
kg/m 
2 
). The co-primary end points were mean percent excess weight loss and the 
proportion of participants who achieved at least a 25% excess weight loss.
 
RESULTS: 
 
At 52 weeks, participants in the AspireAssist group, on a modifi
 ed intent-to-treat basis, had lost a 
mean (±s.d.) of 31.5±26.7% of their excess body weight (12.1±9.6% total body weight), whereas 
those in the Lifestyle Counseling group had lost a mean of 9.8±15.5% of their excess body weight 
(3.5±6.0% total body weight) ( 
P 
<0.001). A total of 58.6% of participants in the AspireAssist 
group and 15.3% of participants in the Lifestyle Counseling group lost at least 25% of their excess 
body weight ( 
P 
<0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events were abdominal pain and 
discomfort in the perioperative period and peristomal granulation tissue and peristomal irritation

INTRODUCTION
 
Obesity is a major public health problem in the United States 
and throughout most of the world due to its high prevalence 
and adverse eff
 ects on health, quality of life, and health-care 
costs ( 
1 
). Th
 e overall goal of all obesity therapies is to reduce 
body fat mass by consuming less energy than expended, and 
then to maintain a targeted healthier and lower body weight 
via a reduced-calorie diet. Accordingly, portion control of 
food intake is an important tenant of obesity treatment. Cur-
rently, counseling on dietary and physical activity behaviors, 
pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery are the major treat-
ment options. Th
 ese approaches cause weight loss primarily 
by decreasing energy intake, while some surgical procedures 
also work by inducing calorie malabsorption ( 
2 
). Th
 e ability 
to achieve successful weight loss increases progressively from 
lifestyle counseling to pharmacotherapy to surgical interven-
tion; however, the availability and utilization of these thera-
pies remain limited with less than 2% of people who qualify 
for either pharmacotherapy or surgical intervention receiving 
those therapies ( 
3, 4 
). Th
 is limited acceptance and low utiliza-
tion rate is partially due to the invasive and irreversible nature 
of surgery and its potential complications, the limited eff
 ective-
ness of non-surgical treatments ( 
5 
), and high costs. Th
 ese issues 
have led to increasing interest in developing endoscopic obe-
sity therapies for patients who have not had successful weight 
loss with conservative therapies, but who do not qualify for, or 
desire, more invasive bariatric surgery.
 
Th
 e AspireAssist System (AspireAssist) is a novel endoscopic 
weight loss therapy comprising an endoscopically placed per-
cutaneous gastrostomy tube (A-tube), a skin port, and a sepa-
rate accessory device. Th
 e system permits instillation of fl
 uid 
into the stomach and partial aspiration of ingested meals. Th
 is 
therapy is used in conjunction with lifestyle counseling aimed 
to reduce energy intake and increase physical activity. A 1-year 
pilot study, conducted in a small number of obese participants 
at a single center in the United States, found that the AspireAs-
sist caused a threefold greater weight loss than lifestyle coun-
seling alone ( 
6 
).
 
Th
 e present report describes the Pivotal Aspiration Th
 erapy 
with Adjusted Lifestyle (PATHWAY) Study, a 1-year multicenter, 
randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effi
  cacy and 
safety of AspireAssist for weight management in persons who have 
obesity.
 
METHODS
 
Study overview
 
Th
 is study was a 52-week randomized controlled trial conducted 
at 10 sites in the United States from 13 November 2012 until 17 
June 2015 under the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki 
(registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01766037); the study pro-
tocol is available in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
 online). All 
participants provided written informed consent before participat-
ing in this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at each site. All authors were involved in the preparation of 
the manuscript, agreed to submit it for publication, and assumed 
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
the data analyses. Th
 e sponsor, Aspire Bariatrics (King of Prus-
sia, PA), performed the statistical analyses and provided editorial 
assistance in preparing this manuscript.
 
Study participants
 
 
Key eligibility criteria were age 21–65 years old and a body mass 
index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of 
the height in meters) of 35.0–55.0 kg/m 
2 
. Key exclusion criteria 
were history of gastrointestinal disease or previous abdominal 
surgery that would increase the risk of endoscopic A-tube place-
ment, previous bariatric surgery, chronic abdominal pain, serious 
cardiovascular disease (including acute coronary syndrome or 
New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure), use of 
medications that cause clinically signifi
 cant weight gain or loss, or 
a history of major depressive or other severe psychiatric disorders. 
In addition, potential participants were excluded if they had a 
history of an eating disorder (binge eating disorder, bulimia 
nervosa or night eating syndrome) or evidence of an eating 
disorder evaluated by using the Questionnaire on Eating and 
Weight Patterns-Revised ( 
7 
) and by conducting an Eating 
Disorder Examination ( 
8 
), which provide a self-reported meas-
ure and an interview-based assessment of binge eating, purging 
and disordered attitudes and behaviors related to eating, body-
shape, and weight. Details of the eligibility and exclusion criteria 
are provided in  
Supplementary eTable S1 in the  
Supplementary 
Appendix 
.
 
Study design
 
Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 52 weeks 
of treatment with AspireAssist (Aspiration Th
 erapy plus Lifestyle 
Counseling) or Lifestyle Counseling alone, respectively, by using

Aspiration Therapy for Obesity
a Web-based system provided by the sponsor. Participants in the 
AspireAssist were allowed to continue in the study for an addi-
tional 48 months if they lost and maintained at least 10% of their 
baseline body weight. Allocation occurred in blocks of random 
sizes to avoid temporal bias, and each site was randomized inde-
pendently.
 
Participants randomized to therapy with AspireAssist under-
went endoscopic placement of a specially designed gastrostomy 
tube, known as the A-tube, which has a 15-cm fenestrated intra-
gastric portion to allow aspiration of gastric contents. Th
 e endo-
scopic procedure is analogous to the placement of a percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy tube ( 
9 
) (details of the procedure are 
provided in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
), which is typically 
performed on an outpatient basis and takes approximately 
15–20 min to complete. Aft
 er the gastrostomy matured, at 
approximately 10–14 days following A-tube placement, at the 
week-0 visit, the proximal end of the A-tube was cut to within 1 cm 
of the abdominal wall and attached to a Skin-Port. Participants 
were then trained on how to aspirate aft
 er meals and instructed 
to chew very thoroughly, to avoid A-tube blockage, and to aspi-
rate about 20 min aft
 er each of three main meals daily. Th
 e compo-
nents of the AspireAssist device and the aspiration procedure are 
shown in  
Figure 1 
. Th
 e aspiration process involves fl
 ushing food 
particles out of the stomach and through the A-Tube by infusing 
water into the stomach from the reservoir and then reversing the 
fl
 ow by opening the clamp on the Companion component to allow 
gastric contents to drain out of the stomach into a lavatory. Th
 is 
process is repeated (typically 3–8 infusions) until food particles 
are no longer seen in the aspirate. Th
 e aspiration process usually 
takes 10–15 min to perform. Th
 e counter mechanism within the 
Connector counts down by 1 count, from 115 initial counts, each 
time the Connector opens the Skin Port valve. When the Counter 
reaches “0” counts (usually aft
 er ~5 weeks of therapy), the Connec-
tor can no longer open the Skin Port valve, preventing additional 
aspiration procedures without being seen by the research team to 
obtain a new Connector.
 
Participants in both treatment groups completed a 10-session 
behavioral and diet education weight loss program (details pro-
vided in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
) delivered to participants 
over 52 weeks. Participants in both treatment groups were seen by 
the study team for medical monitoring, lifestyle counseling, and 
blood tests at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 
and 52. An assessment of eating behaviors (assessed by the 
Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised and the 
Eating Disorder Examination) was made at baseline and at weeks 
28 and 52, in both treatment groups, and an additional assessment 
at week 14 in the AspireAssist group.
 
Study end points
 
Th
 e overall purpose of the trial was to evaluate the safety and effi
  -
cacy of AspireAssist. Th
 ere were two prespecifi
 ed co-primary end 
points. Th
 e fi
 rst co-primary end point was mean percent excess 
weight loss (% EWL) at 52 weeks, defi
 ned as absolute weight loss 
divided by baseline excess weight (based on an ideal body weight 
at a BMI=25 kg/m 
2 
) multiplied by 100; success was defi
 ned as at 
least a 10% diff
 erence in %EWL between the AspireAssist and 
Lifestyle Counseling groups. Th
 e second co-primary end point 
was the proportion of participants who achieved at least a 25% 
EWL at 52 weeks; success was defi
 ned as having at least 50% of the 
AspireAssist group achieve at least 25% EWL. Th
 e co-primary end 
points were established aft
 er discussion with the Food and Drug 
Administration, and were based on typical end points for obesity 
devices at that time ( 
10–14 
). Key secondary end points included 
change in percent total body weight from baseline, proportion of 
participants who achieved a reduction in total body weight of 10% 
or more, percent change in systolic and diastolic blood pressures,

After most of the ingested meal has been converted into a chyme by the 
stomach (about 20 
min after meal ingestion), the Connector is attached 
to the Skin-Port, which opens the closed Skin-Port valve. Gastric contents 
then spontaneously fl
 ow out of the stomach through the drain tube into a 
toilet bowl. Remaining food particles are fl
 ushed out of the stomach and 
through the A-tube by fl
 ipping the lever on the Companion to allow water 
to be infused into the stomach from the reservoir and then reversing the 
fl
 ow to allow gastric contents to drain out of the stomach.

change in glycated hemoglobin, percent change from baseline in 
serum lipids (triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and change in the qual-
ity of life (assessed by using the Impact of Weight on Quality of 
Life questionnaire ( 
15 
), which has scores that range from 0 to 100, 
with higher scores indicating a better quality of life). Procedural 
success was defi
 ned as percent of endoscopic attempts to place 
the A-tube that were successful. Th
 e safety end points included 
the incidence of procedure-related, device-related, and therapy-
related adverse events.
 
Statistical analyses
 
Th
 ere were two primary eff
 ectiveness objectives in this study. Th
 e 
fi
 rst was to determine if the %EWL in the AspireAssist group was 
10% better than the %EWL in the Lifestyle Counseling group. For 
this fi
 rst co-primary end point, we estimated that 87 participants 
in the AspireAssist group and 42 participants in the Lifestyle 
Counseling group would yield a 90% power to detect a 10% dif-
ference in % EWL between groups at a 5% signifi
 cance level. Th
 e 
second objective was to determine if the percentage of patients 
in the AspireAssist group who had %EWL of at least 25% was 
greater than 50%. For the second co-primary end point, we esti-
mated that 85 participants in the AspireAssist group would yield a 
power of 90% to demonstrate that at least 50% of the AspireAssist 
group would achieve at least a 25% EWL at a 5% signifi
 cance level. 
Th
 ere was no adjustment in the signifi
 cance level for multiple end 
points.
 
According to the prespecifi
 ed analysis plan, all safety and effi
  -
cacy analyses were conducted on the modifi
 ed intent-to-treat 
(mITT) population. For the AspireAssist participants, the mITT 
population is defi
 ned as all participants who underwent attempted 
endoscopic placement of the A-Tube, and for the Lifestyle Coun-
seling participants, as all participants who attended any Lifestyle 
Th
 erapy session. Hence participants that dropped out aft
 er rand-
omization but before receiving any treatment were not included in 
the mITT population.
 
Th
 e fi
 rst and second co-primary eff
 ectiveness analyses were per-
formed on the mITT population in which missing weight data for 
all time points were imputed by using a multiple imputation algo-
rithm. For the analyses, the results of all imputations were analyzed 
via the protocol methods of a two sample  
t 
-test, for the fi
 rst co-
primary end point, and one-sample binomial test, for the second 
co-primary end point, and then compiled in PROC MIANALYZE 
to determine the fi
 nal  
P 
 value. In the multiple imputation model, 
data from all 111 mITT AspireAssist participants and 59 out of 
60 mITT Lifestyle Counseling participants (1 Lifestyle Counseling 
subject only attended the fi
 rst study visit and hence there were no 
data to impute for further visits) were used.
 
Secondary eff
 ectiveness analyses were performed by using the 
per-protocol population and the mixed eff
 ects linear model to con-
fi
 rm the robustness of the results. In the per protocol population, 
no value is imputed for missed data. Since the 52-week data are 
primary outcome and only the patients who have completed that 
time point are included in the per protocol population, no con-
sistent cohort was tabulated across all the time points. In the per 
protocol model, data from all 31 Control participants and all 82 
AT participants who completed their 52-week visit were included.
 
No diff
 erences in any participant characteristics were identi-
fi
 ed in those who dropped out from those who remained in the 
study. Accordingly, the assumption of the data is Missing at Ran-
dom (MAR) is valid for this study. Further, since the least-squares 
means that are derived from a mixed eff
 ects model are unbiased 
with respect to this missing data pattern, the data were also ana-
lyzed by using a repeated measures mixed eff
 ects model and the 
least-squares means for the AspireAssist and Lifestyle Counseling 
groups estimated along with the diff
 erence. Th
 ese results provide 
unbiased estimates of the primary end point results. Data from all 
31 Lifestyle Counseling participants and all 82 AspireAssist par-
ticipants who completed their 52-week visit were included.
 
 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted using two diff
 erent impu-
tation methods on the mITT population. Th
 e fi
 rst imputation 
method is the Last Observation Carried Forward to impute the 
missing values. All missing post treatment data were imputed 
using the last available observation, including the fi
 rst time point 
post treatment. Th
 e second imputation method is the Return to 
Baseline method. All missing post treatment data were imputed 
using the baseline observation. Th
 is includes the fi
 rst time point 
post treatment.
 
RESULTS
 
Trial population
 
 
A total of 207 participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion: 
137 to AspireAssist and 70 to Lifestyle Counseling (see  
Supple-
mentary eFigure S1 in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
). Baseline 
characteristics were not diff
 erent between groups ( 
Table 1 
). 
Among those randomized, 26 AspireAssist and 10 Lifestyle Coun-
seling participants withdrew before beginning the study so 111 in 
the AspireAssist group and 60 in the Lifestyle Counseling group 
enrolled in the study ( 
Table 1 
). Six of the 26 AspireAssist par-
ticipants withdrew, or were withdrawn, for medical reasons (see 
 
Supplementary eFigure S1 
 in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
). 
Excluding those subjects withdrawn for medical reasons, the pre-
enrollment withdrawal rate of the AspireAssist group (14.5%) was 
approximately the same as the withdrawal rate of the Lifestyle 
Counseling group (14.2%).
 
Aft
 er enrollment, 29 AspireAssist and 29 Lifestyle Counseling 
participants subsequently withdrew from the study. Th
 erefore, 82 
AspireAssist (74% of those enrolled) and 31 Lifestyle Counseling 
participants (52% of those enrolled) completed the entire 52-week 
study. Th
 e major reasons cited for post-enrollment withdrawals 
in the AspireAssist group were lack of time/motivation 
(17 participants) or moving out of state (5 participants), and the 
major reasons cited in the Lifestyle Counseling group were not 
identifi
 ed (10 participants) and lack of time (6 participants) (see 
 
Supplementary eFigure S1 in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
). One 
participant in the AspireAssist group (0.9%) withdrew from the 
study owing to adverse events while no Lifestyle Counseling with-
drew owing to adverse events; the withdrawal in the AspireAssist 
group was due to peristomal irritation. A smaller percentage of

formed under conscious sedation, and the remaining 20% were 
performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intuba-
tion, at the discretion of the anesthesiology team.
 
Weight loss
 
At 52 weeks, based on an mITT analysis, mean percent body 
weight loss at 52 weeks was12.1±9.6% (14.2±9.8% for completers 
only) in the AspireAssist group and 3.5±6.0% (4.9±7.0% for 
completers only) in the Lifestyle Counseling group (

Procedural success
 
Successful endoscopic placement of the A-tube was achieved in 
97% of attempts (111 of 114 endoscopies performed in 112 partic-
ipants). Endoscopy was aborted before A-tube placement in three 
participants: one because of inability to trans-illuminate through 
the abdomen; and two participants with contraindications (one 
suspected gastric varices and another discovery of previous

Th
 e diff
 erence in the mean percent body weight loss between the 
two groups was 8.6% (95% CI: 6.2–10.9). A greater proportion 
of participants in the AspireAssist group than in the Lifestyle 
Counseling group lost 10% or more of their initial body weight 
(58.6% vs. 22.0% in the mITT analysis and 69.5% vs. 19.4% in the 
completers only analysis) ( 
Figure 2b 
). Mean weight loss of the 
mITT population was 14.2±11.3 kg in the AspireAssist group and 
4.1±7.2 kg in the Lifestyle Counseling group (see  
Supplementary 
eFigure S2 
).
 
Based on an mITT analysis, participants in the AspireAs-
sist group had lost a mean (±s.d.) of 31.5±26.7% of their excess 
body weight (37.2±27.5% for completers only), whereas those 
in the Lifestyle Counseling group had lost a mean of 9.8±15.5% 
of their excess body weight (13.0±17.6% for completers only) 
( 
Figure 2c 
). Th
 e diff
 erence in %EWL achieved between groups 
was 21.7% (95% CI 15.3, 28.1), which was greater than the 10% 
threshold needed to achieve the  
a priori defi
 nition of success 
( 
P 
=0.008). A greater proportion of participants in the AspireAssist 
group than in the Lifestyle Counseling group lost at least 25% of 
their excess body weight (58.6% vs. 22.0% in a mITT analysis and 
68.3% vs. 25.8% in a completers only analysis) (

). Several 
sensitivity analyses confi
 rmed the benefi

Supplementary eTables S2 and

Early responsiveness with the AspireAssist, defi
 ned as 5% or 
more body weight loss at week 14, was predictive of weight loss at 
week 52. Th
 e early responders who completed the study (76% of 
AspireAssist completers) lost 17.2±8.7% body weight at 52 weeks, 
while participants who were not early responders but completed 
the study lost 4.9±6.3% body weight, which nearly the same as the 
weight loss observed by the completers in the Lifestyle Counseling 
group (see

and two Lifestyle Counseling) demonstrated evidence of binge 
eating behavior when evaluated by using the Questionnaire on 
Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised, but not when evaluated by 
using the more reliable Eating Disorders Examination, so these 
participants were not excluded for participating in the study. One 
participant in the Lifestyle Counseling group, who showed no 
evidence of binge-eating behaviors at screening, demonstrated, at 
week 28, evidence of binge eating, when evaluated by using the 
both the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised 
and the Eating Disorders Examination, and hence was withdrawn 
from the study. One participant in the AspireAssist group dem-
onstrated, at weeks 14 and 28 (as well at screening), evidence of 
binge eating behavior when evaluated by using the Questionnaire 
on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised, but not by using the Eat-
ing Disorders Examination, and hence was allowed to continue 
in the study. No evidence of bulimia in any subject was detected 
by using either the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-
Revised or the Eating Disorders Examination at baseline, or at 
weeks 14, 28, or 52.
 
Th
 e frequency of use of the AspireAssist was tracked roughly by 
the use of the Connector, which counts down by one count from 
an initial 115 counts, each time a participant connected the Aspire-
Assist. Th
 e remaining Connector counts were recorded at each 
study visit, as were the issuance of each new Connector. Mean and 
median daily usage, as recorded by Connector counts, were 2.5 and 
2.4 times, respectively, from week 1 to week 14, 2.3 and 2.2 times, 
respectively, from week 14 to week 28, and from week 28 to week 
40, and 2.2 and 2.0 times, from week 40 to week 52. Th
 ere was no 
evidence of any subject overusing the device (e.g., more than ~3.0 
times per day).
 
Adverse events
 
Approximately 90% of the study-related adverse events (SAEs) 
in the AspireAssist group were those known to be associated 
with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes ( 
Table 2 
), and 
approximately half of all SAEs occurred within the fi
 rst 7 days 
aft
 er A-tube placement ( 
Figure 3 and  
Table 2 
). Th
 e development 
of peristomal granulation tissue occurred later, at 1–2 months 
aft
 er A-tube placement. Most adverse events resolved spontane-
ously or with standard medical therapy, such as oral analgesics 
for abdominal pain, oral antibiotics for suspected or documented 
peristomal infection, and topical silver nitrate for granulation 
tissue. A listing of all adverse events is provided in  
Supplementary 
eTable S6 in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
. Five serious SAEs, 
occurred in four participants in the AspireAssist group ( 
Table 2 
); 
no study-related SAEs occurred in the Lifestyle Counseling group. 
One of the SAEs was mild peritonitis, which occurred 2 days aft
 er 
A-Tube placement and was treated with intravenous antibiotics 
and analgesics during a 2-day hospitalization. Two of the SAEs 
were associated with severe abdominal pain that occurred in the 
same participant within the fi
 rst 3 days aft
 er A-tube placement; 
each time the participant was hospitalized overnight and treated 
with pain medication. Another SAE was associated with 
abdominal pain caused by a pre-pyloric ulcer that occurred 53 
weeks aft
 er A-tube placement, judged to have been caused by 
 
Cardiometabolic risk factors and quality of life
 
For the AspireAssist group, at week 52 compared with baseline, 
clinically signifi
 cant improvement was seen in HbA1C (−0.36% 
relative to 5.7% baseline,  
P 
<0.0001), triglycerides (−9.9%,  
P 
=0.02), 
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+8.1%,

while modest improvement was seen in systolic blood pres-
sure (−1.2%,

P 
=0.06), 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−4.2%,  
P

cholesterol (−2.5%,  
P 
=0.07). For the Lifestyle group, at week 52 
compared with baseline, moderate improvement was seen in 
HbA1C (−0.22% relative to 5.7% baseline,  
P 
<0.0001), while mod-
est or no improvement was seen in triglycerides (+0.1%,  
P 
=0.62), 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+1.7%,  
P 
=0.55), systolic 
blood pressure (−2.5%,  
P 
=0.17), diastolic blood pressure (+0.5%, 
 
P 
=0.83), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−1.8%,  
P 
=0.72), and 
total cholesterol (−2.5%,  
P 
=0.28). Th
 e diff
 erences in improvement 
from week 52 relative to baseline with the aforementioned param-
eters between the AspireAssist group and the Lifestyle Counseling 
group were not statistically signifi
 cant (see  
Supplementary 
eTable S4 in  
Supplementary Appendix 
), except for glycated 
hemoglobin. It should be noted that medications to treat hyper-
tension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were not fi
 xed throughout the 
study: the participants’
 primary physicians changed such medi-
cations as they saw fi
 t. Th
 e Impact of Weight on Quality of Life 
score increased in both treatment groups, across all fi
 ve measures 
(physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and 
work) with the AspireAssist group showing a greater increase in 
total Impact of Weight on Quality of Life score than the Lifestyle 
Counseling group ( 
P 
=0.03) (see  
Supplementary eTable S4 
).
 
Electrolytes and minerals
 
 
Mean plasma electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, carbon 
dioxide), calcium and magnesium concentrations at 52 weeks 
of therapy were not diff
 erent than those at baseline in both the 
AspireAssist and Lifestyle Counseling groups (see  
Supplemen-
tary eTable S5 in the  
Supplementary Appendix 
). However, 
hypokalemia (ranging from 3.2 to 3.7 mEq/l) was reported as an 
adverse event by the study site investigators in four participants, 
and was successfully treated with oral potassium supplementa-
tion.
 
At week 52 of therapy, no participant in the AspireAssist group 
developed hip or whole-body T-Scores of ≤−2.5 s.d. below the nor-
mal peak values. Th
 e hip T-score decreased slightly (1.08±1.15 at 
baseline to 0.97±1.19 at 52 weeks,  
P 
=0.1) in AspireAssist subjects, 
consistent with the expected reduction in bone mineral density 
that occurs with weight loss ( 
16 
). Spine bone mineral density in 
AspireAssist participants was greater at the week 52 than at base-
line, an artifact of the Skin Port sitting directly over the spine area 
being evaluated and infl
 uencing the reading.
 
Eating behaviors
 
 
Exclusion criteria from participating in the study included diag-
nosed bulimia or binge eating disorder based on DSM IV criteria 
or night eating syndrome as diagnosed by Eating Disorders 
Examination. At baseline, fi

mucosal contact with the intragastric portion of the A-tube which 
had rotated toward the pylorus from its usual position in the 
fundus. Th
 e fi
 nal SAE was a product malfunction that required 
outpatient endoscopy to replace the A-tube. Th
 e three periopera-
tive SAEs completely resolved with medical therapy, while the two 
postoperative SAEs resolved by removal of the A-Tube in one case 
and replacement of the A-Tube in the other.
 
Tube replacement
 
Th
 ere were four A-Tubes that had to be replaced because of 
A-Tube deterioration in the study: three because of fungal growth 
and one because of punctures of an unknown origin. No A-Tube 
had to be removed because of clogs.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Obesity continues to have an increasing impact on a global scale. 
Lifestyle modifi
 cation and surgical procedures are important 
components to a successful management strategy, but additional 
options are needed to help address this worsening epidemic. Th
 e 
results from this 52-week randomized clinical trial demonstrate 
that the use of AspireAssist, in conjunction with weight manage-
ment lifestyle counseling, causes marked weight loss in people 
with class II and class III obesity. Treatment with AspireAssist 
was superior to treatment with lifestyle counseling alone and 
met the prespecifi
 ed criteria for success for both of the study’
s 
co-primary end points: (1) % EWL in the AspireAssist group was 
22% greater than the %EWL achieved in the Lifestyle Counseling 
only group, which was more than the 10% prespecifi
 ed criterion; 
and (2) 59% of the AspireAssist group lost at least 25% of their 
excess body weight, which was more than the 50% prespecifi
 ed 
criterion. Th
 ese results are consistent with the results from a pre-
vious trial ( 
6 
), and thereby further supports the effi
  cacy of this 
intervention.
 
Th
 e AspireAssist group saw clinically signifi
 cant improvement 
in glycated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and modest improvement in blood pressure, low 
density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Th
 e 
treatment diff
 erence between the AspireAssist group and the Life-
style group was statistically signifi
 cant for glycated hemoglobin, 
but was only modest for blood pressure and lipids. As the study 
was sized to show statistically signifi
 cant treatment diff
 erence for 
weight loss, but not for cardiometabolic parameters, the modest 
treatment diff
 erence observed in blood pressure and lipids is not 
surprising. Further, although some subjects were being treated 
for hypertension (29 AspireAssist/20 Lifestyle), dyslipidemia (13 
AspireAssist/12 Lifestyle), and diabetes (3 AspireAssist/6 Life-
style), only a small fraction of participants had abnormal baseline 
blood pressure, lipid, or glycated hemoglobin levels, reducing the 
likelihood of seeing a large treatment eff
 ect in either group. A pos-
sible confounder in this analysis are changes made in medications 
to treat these cardiometabolic conditions by the participants pri-
mary care physicians.

 e Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 
two intragastric balloons (IGBs) for weight loss (

ENDOSCOPY
Aspiration Therapy for Obesity
are aspirated in a person who normally consumes a 2,500 kcal/
day diet), as recommended by several major medical and scientifi
 c 
societies ( 
20,21 
).
 
 
Our data demonstrate that the increased abdominal girth in 
people with obesity does not prohibit successful and safe percu-
taneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Th
 e procedure 
was aborted in only one of 111 participants (<1%) because of an 
inability to trans-illuminate through the abdominal wall during 
endoscopy. Th
 e success we observed in our participants is consist-
ent with the experience in placing percutaneous endoscopic gas-
trostomy tubes reported by other groups in patients who are obese 
with BMI values up to 70 kg/m 
2 ( 
22,23 
).
 
Th
 e durability of the AspireAssist A-Tube appears to be signifi
 -
cantly greater than PEG Tubes, with less than 5% of AspireAssist 
subjects requiring A-tube replacements in the fi
 rst year. Possible rea-
sons for this greater durability are its low profi
 le and larger diameter.
 
Th
 e adverse events associated with the use of AspireAssist were 
primarily those known to be associated with percutaneous endo-
scopic gastrostomy tubes ( 
24 
), and resolved spontaneously or with 
standard medical therapy. Only one participant in the AspireAssist 
group withdrew from the study because of an adverse event. Of 
the 29 subjects who had their A-Tubes removed before the end of 
the 52-week study, one had a persistent fi
 stula, which was success-
fully treated with endoscopic clip placement, whereas the fi
 stulae 
in the remaining 28 subjects healed spontaneously. No clinically 
meaningful changes in plasma electrolyte, calcium, phosphorous, 
or magnesium concentrations were detected.
 
 
A potential concern with use of this device is that it might pro-
mote eating disorders, in particular bulimia and binge-eating; 
however, people with pre-existing eating disorders (binge-eating, 
bulimia nervosa, and night-eating syndrome) were excluded from 
this study. Bulimia nervosa is a psychological disorder involving 
distortion of body image and an obsessive desire to lose weight, 
in which bouts of bingeing (eating vast amounts of food, typi-
cally rapidly and mindlessly) are followed by depression and self-
induced vomiting, purging, or fasting. Th
 ere was no evidence of 
participants with the AspireAssist developing bulimia, binge-eat-
ing syndrome, or other adverse eff
 ects eating behaviors, as evalu-
ated by a comprehensive interview-based psychological evaluation 
(i.e. Eating Disorder Examination) conducted at weeks 14, 28, and 
52. Further, use of the device would seem to mitigate against binge-
eating and hence bulimia. Th
 orough mastication is required for 
successful use of the device. If patients fails to chew thoroughly 
and eat slowly, larger food particles will clog the tube, preventing 
aspiration. Sullivan  
et al. 
 ( 
6 
), in an earlier study, found that par-
ticipants with the AspireAssist developed greater cognitive dietary 
restraint (deliberate control of food intake), less disinhibition (loss 
of control of food intake), and less perceived hunger (awareness 
and susceptibility to hunger.) Another concern was that the ther-
apy might give patients a license to overeat since they could later 
aspirate some of the contents of their meal. Th
 ere was no evidence 
of this occurring either. In fact, the use of AspireAssist reinforces 
eating behaviors that are commonly recommended for weight 
management, including adherence to a structured meal plan, 
eating slowly and chewing food thoroughly, and drinking plenty of 
AspireAssist and the IGBs are similar in that they can be easily 
placed and removed in a short endoscopic procedure; however, the 
AspireAssist allows long duration of use while IGBs are intended 
for only temporary use (6 months). Weight loss of participants 
with the AspireAssist follows a similar trajectory those with IGBs 
for the fi
 rst 6 months; however, aft
 er IGB removal at 6 months, the 
IGB participants showed moderate weight gain between 6 and 12 
months while AspireAssist participants continued to lose weight, 
resulting in 12.1% TBL for AspireAssist participants at 12-months, 
vs. 7.6 and 4.8% TBL for the Orbera and ReShape Duo balloons, 
respectively ( 
13,14 
). Finally, IGBs are targeted for less-obese 
patients (30–40 kg/m 
2 
), while the AspireAssist is targeted for more 
obese patients (35–55 kg/m 
2 
).
 
Th
 e AspireAssist induces weight loss by direct removal of 
ingested food from the stomach before it passes into the small 
intestine, where it is further digested and absorbed. Aft
 er meal 
consumption, solid food is triturated into small particles before it 
can pass through the pylorus ( 
17 
). Th
 is lag phase between meal 
consumption and gastric emptying provides an opportunity to 
remove a portion of ingested food, which has become a homog-
enized liquid chyme, from the stomach before it is absorbed. Nev-
ertheless, a previous study found that the aspiration process is 
ineffi
  cient and removes less than 30% of ingested calories, when 
all instructions are adhered to precisely ( 
6 
). Although there are no 
data on the percent of daily caloric intake aspirated in this study, 
the actual percent is similarly expected to have been less than 
30%, on average. Additionally, connector count data showed that 
the device was used for approximately 2.5 sessions per day over 
the fi
 rst 14 weeks and approximately 2 sessions per day thereaft
 er. 
Th
 is suggests that participants consumed, on average, one or more 
meals and/or snacks per day aft
 er which the AspireAssist was not 
used. In light of these above factors, and the weight loss realized in 
this study, it is possible that mechanisms beyond caloric loss due 
to gastric aspiration are contributing to the overall weight loss ( 
6 
). 
Some likely secondary mechanisms may be due to proper device 
use necessitating adoption of standard dietary principles, includ-
ing thorough and complete mastication of food, drinking water at 
meals, and better meal planning. Other potential mechanisms are 
less well defi
 ned.
 
Th
 e results from this study also provide insights into the 
factors involved in the regulation of food intake in people who 
have obesity. Despite the removal of a portion of ingested calories 
in the AspireAssist group, there was no evidence of a compensa-
tory increase in food intake during or between meals to compen-
sate for the reduction in energy intake. Th
 is observation implicates 
central reward pathways and chronic lifestyle behaviors in driv-
ing food consumption. Th
 erefore, in addition to the neuroendo-
crine response to calorie restriction ( 
18 
), liking and wanting food, 
habitual eating habits, and social infl
 uences are likely major con-
tributors to the high rate of recidivism observed aft
 er initial weight 
loss ( 
19 
), and need to be addressed to achieve successful long-
term weight management. As such, the system could be viewed as 
providing portion control at the level of the stomach and as a 
tool to better ensure compliance with low-calorie diet therapy 
(e.g., approximately 750 kcal/day would be removed if all meals

et al. 
water with meals ( 
1 
), because these behaviors facilitate successful 
postprandial aspiration.
 
Th
 is study has several limitations. First, although this was a ran-
domized controlled trial, participants could not be blinded as to 
treatment group because of the nature of the therapy. However, all 
other aspects of the study protocol, such as weight management 
counseling and study visits, were the same in the in the AspireAs-
sist and Lifestyle Counseling groups to minimize any additional 
potential infl
 uences on our outcome measures. Second, it is pos-
sible that bias was introduced into the study by the high number of 
pre-enrollment withdrawals (~14% in each treatment group) and 
post-enrollment withdrawals (26% in the AspireAssist group and 
48% in the Lifestyle Counseling group), which is a common prob-
lem in weight loss intervention studies ( 
25,26 
). However, the base-
line and demographic characteristics of the randomized, enrolled, 
and completer populations were analyzed for homogeneity and 
were not diff
 erent in the AspireAssist and Lifestyle Counseling 
groups. Th
 e consistency of study results by using diff
 erent statis-
tical analyses further indicate that withdrawals did not bias the 
results. Th
 ird, this report includes only one-year results, and hence 
does not provide longer term safety and effi
  cacy of the AspireAs-
sist therapy. However, ~90% of the adverse events associated with 
AspireAssist are related to the A-tube, with ~50% occurring within 
the fi
 rst week of implantation. Th
 e placement and management 
of the A-tube is similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy 
tubes, which have been used in clinical practice for more than 
35 years, so the short-term and long-term complications of this 
device are already well known ( 
27 
). Finally, our study population 
contained a high percentage of female participants, which is a 
common problem of weight loss studies ( 
10–14,25,26 
). Th
 erefore, 
our results might not necessarily apply to men with obesity.
 
In conclusion, the use of AspireAssist causes considerable weight 
loss and is more eff
 ective than intensive lifestyle modifi
 cation alone 
in the treatment of obesity. Th
 e system is designed for the long-
term treatment of obesity and necessitates regular monitoring, both 
aspects of which are important for treatment of a chronic disease. 
Th
 e placement procedure is the same as that used for percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement and can be performed in 
an outpatient setting. It can also be removed if it is later decided to 
discontinue therapy, and does not cause anatomical changes that 
would preclude future bariatric surgery. Th
 e weight loss effi
  cacy 
and safety profi
 le of AspireAssist suggest this treatment approach 
may help bridge the therapeutic gap between more conservative 
lifestyle modifi
 cation and the established bariatric surgical proce-
dures for people with Class II and Class III obesity.

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
Obesity is a major public health concern in the United 
States. 
 
✓ 
 
Counseling on dietary and physical activity behaviors, phar-
macotherapy and bariatric surgery are the major treatment 
options. 
 
✓ 
 
A therapeutic gap exists between medical and surgical 
management of obesity, which has led to the development 
of miminally invasive endoscopic alternatives. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
The AspireAssist System is a novel endoscopic weight loss 
therapy that permits instillation of fl
 uid into the stomach 
and partial aspiration of ingested meals. 
 
✓ 
 
The results from this 52-week randomized clinical trial 
demonstrate that the use of AspireAssist, in conjunction 
with weight management lifestyle counseling, causes 
marked weight loss in people with class II and class III 
obesity. 
 
✓ 
 
The weight loss effi
 cacy and safety profi
 le of AspireAssist 
suggest this treatment approach may help bridge the thera-
peutic gap between more conservative lifestyle modifi
 ca-
tion and the established bariatric surgical procedures for 
people with Class II and Class III obesity.
