Introduction
The burden of diabetes has steadily increased over 
the past quarter century in India and across the globe, 
with India contributing a major part of the global 
burden.1–3 Diabetes was identified as one of four priority 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) targeted for action 
by the United Nations due to its growing disease 
burden.2,4 In 2013, WHO developed targets for prevention 
and control of NCDs by 2025, which included a 
25% reduction in mortality from NCDs, halting the rise 
in diabetes and obesity, and ensuring that at least 80% of 
patients have access to affordable basic technologies 
and essential medicines for NCDs.5,6 The Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) also include a target to 
reduce the proportion of pre 
mature deaths due to NCDs, 
including diabetes, by one third by 2030.7,8 The National 
Health Policy 2017 of India aims to increase screening 
and treatment of 80% of people with diabetes and reduce 
premature deaths from diabetes by 25% by 2025.9
Overall diabetes burden estimates for the 1·3 billion 
population of India mask wide variations across the states 
of the country, many of which are comparable to large 
countries in terms of population. Attempts have been 
made previously to compile the trends of diabetes from 
studies done over several decades in different parts of 
India.10–14 However, no comprehensive analysis is available 
The increasing burden of diabetes and variations among the 
states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 
1990–2016
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Diabetes Collaborators*
Summary
Background The burden of diabetes is increasing rapidly in India but a systematic understanding of its distribution and 
time trends is not available for every state of India. We present a comprehensive analysis of the time trends and 
heterogeneity in the distribution of diabetes burden across all states of India between 1990 and 2016.
Methods We analysed the prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of diabetes in the states of India 
from 1990 to 2016 using all available data sources that could be accessed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, and assessed heterogeneity across the states. The states were placed in four groups 
based on epidemiological transition level (ETL), defined on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable diseases 
to those from non-communicable diseases and injuries combined, with a low ratio denoting high ETL and vice versa. We 
assessed the contribution of risk factors to diabetes DALYs and the relation of overweight (body-mass index 25 kg/m² or 
more) with diabetes prevalence. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
Findings The number of people with diabetes in India increased from 26·0 million (95% UI 23·4–28·6) in 1990 to 
65·0 million (58·7–71·1) in 2016. The prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 20 years or older in India increased from 
5·5% (4·9–6·1) in 1990 to 7·7% (6·9–8·4) in 2016. The prevalence in 2016 was highest in Tamil Nadu and Kerala 
(high ETL) and Delhi (higher-middle ETL), followed by Punjab and Goa (high ETL) and Karnataka (higher-middle 
ETL). The age-standardised DALY rate for diabetes increased in India by 39·6% (32·1–46·7) from 1990 to 2016, which 
was the highest increase among major non-communicable diseases. The age-standardised diabetes prevalence and 
DALYs increased in every state, with the percentage increase among the highest in several states in the low and lower-
middle ETL state groups. The most important risk factor for diabetes in India was overweight to which 36·0% 
(22·6–49·2) of the diabetes DALYs in 2016 could be attributed. The prevalence of overweight in adults in India 
increased from 9·0% (8·7–9·3) in 1990 to 20·4% (19·9–20·8) in 2016; this prevalence increased in every state of the 
country. For every 100 overweight adults aged 20 years or older in India, there were 38 adults (34–42) with diabetes, 
compared with the global average of 19 adults (17–21) in 2016.
Interpretation The increase in health loss from diabetes since 1990 in India is the highest among major non-
communicable diseases. With this increase observed in every state of the country, and the relative rate of increase 
highest in several less developed low ETL states, policy action that takes these state-level differences into account is 
needed urgently to control this potentially explosive public health situation.

that reports diabetes estimates for every state of India over 
a long period of time. Health is a state subject in India, 
with the state budget contributing two-thirds towards 
overall government spending on health care and the 
central budget contributing the remainder.15,16 It is 
therefore imperative to have robust and comprehensive 
estimates on the magnitude of diabetes and its risk 
factors in every state to enable planning for targeted 
policy and interventions. The India State-Level Disease 
Burden Initiative recently reported a varied epidemio-
logical transition among the states of India between 1990 
and 2016 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016.17,18 Here, we 
report the time trends and heterogeneity in diabetes 
burden across all states of India between 1990 and 2016.
Methods
Overview
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative has 
recently reported the overall trends of diseases, injuries, 
and risk factors from 1990 to 2016 for every state of 
India.17,18 That analysis was done as part of GBD 2016, 
which estimated disease burden due to 333 diseases and 
injuries and 84 risk factors using all available data 
sources that could be accessed. Disease grouping and 
risk grouping in GBD 2016 were organised into three 
broad categories and four levels, respectively. The India 
State-Level Disease Burden Initiative was supported by 
the efforts of several expert groups and a vast network of 
collaborators to identify and access all available data 
sources, assess their scope and quality for inclusion, and 
participate in the analysis and interpretation of the 
findings. The Health Ministry Screening Committee at 
the Indian Council of Medical Research and the ethics 
committee of the Public Health Foundation of India 
approved the work of this initiative. A detailed description 
of the metrics and analytical approaches used in GBD 
2016 has been reported elsewhere.19–23 In this paper, we 
report findings on the prevalence of diabetes, its disease 
burden, and its risk factors across the states of India 
from 1990 to 2016. The GBD 2016 methods relevant for 
this paper are described in the appendix (pp 3–21), and a 
summary of the key points follows.
Estimation of prevalence and years lived with disability
Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
greater than 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or being on diabetes 
treatment.21,24 The prevalence of diabetes was estimated by 
location, age, sex, and year using DisMod-MR, version 2.1, 
a disease modelling computational tool that is the 
standard GBD modelling approach for non-fatal health 
outcomes. The prevalence estimation process involved 
identification of all available data sources that could be 
accessed and their assessment for data extraction based 
on inclusion criteria; estimation of cause-specific preva-
lence using DisMod-MR modelling; ascertainment of 
severity distributions of sequelae; incorporation of 
disability weights to quantify severity; comorbidity 
adjustment of sequelae; and computation of years lived 
with disability (YLDs) from prevalence and disability 
weights for each location, age, sex, and year. GBD 2016 
included the following sequelae as part of the direct 
diabetes burden estimation: vision loss due to diabetic 
retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Existing evidence suggests that as part of the epidemiological 
transition from communicable diseases to non-communicable 
diseases, the burden of diabetes and its risk factors has been 
increasing in India. We searched PubMed and publicly available 
reports for estimates of diabetes burden across the states of India 
using the search terms “burden”, “cause of death”, “DALY”, 
“death”, “diabetes”, “epidemiology”, “India”, “morbidity”, 
“mortality”, “prevalence”, and “trends” on March 30, 2018, 
without language or publication date restrictions. We found 
many studies on the prevalence of diabetes in several urban 
settings and states, but no comprehensive report on the 
prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
from diabetes in every state of India over a long duration of time.
Added value of this study
This study provides comprehensive estimates of the burden 
due to diabetes in every state of India from 1990 to 2016, 
based on all available data sources that could be accessed, using 
the standardised Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study methodology. It documents that, although 
substantial heterogeneity exists in the distribution of diabetes 
among the states of India, its prevalence has increased in every 
state between 1990 and 2016, with the age-standardised 
increase among the highest in the relatively less advanced 
states. Diabetes has had the highest increase in DALY rate 
among the major non-communicable diseases in India since 
1990. We report that the prevalence of overweight, the most 
important risk factor for diabetes, has increased substantially in 
every state of India since 1990. The finding that in 2016 there 
were twice the number of people with diabetes in India for 
every 100 overweight adults versus the global average 
highlights the higher risk of diabetes in India.
Implications of all the available evidence
This comprehensive assessment of the burden of diabetes in 
every state of India over a quarter century is an acute reminder 
of the need to halt the potentially explosive increase of diabetes 
across the country. The state-specific trends in the prevalence of 
and DALYs from diabetes, and the prevalence of overweight, 
can serve as a useful guide for planning diabetes control in 
every state of India.

diabetic neuro 
pathy with foot ulcer, and diabetic 
neuropathy with treated or untreated amputation. The 
contribution of high FPG to ischaemic heart disease, 
stroke, chronic kidney disease, tuberculosis, and other 
conditions was estimated separately in GBD, and there-
fore we report the burden from these conditions 
separately.
The major data inputs for the distribution of diabetes in 
India included national health surveys, population-
representative surveys and cohort studies, and a variety of 
published and unpublished studies (appendix pp 22–30).
Estimation of deaths, years of life lost, and 
disability-adjusted life-years
Among the all-cause mortality rates, mortality due 
to diabetes was estimated using a variation of the 
GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling approach 
to estimate deaths separately in younger age groups 
(<25 years) and in older age groups (≥25 years).19,20 All 
available data sources that could be accessed, including 
covariates, were used to develop a series of plausible 
models and, eventually, the best ensemble predictive 
model to produce estimates of deaths and years of life 
lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality by location, age, 
sex, and year. YLLs were calculated from age at death 
and GBD norm 
ative standard life expectancy at each 
age. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a summary 
measure of total health loss, were calculated for diabetes 
by summing YLLs and YLDs for each location, age, sex, 
and year. The sequelae of diabetes mentioned above that 
are included directly in the estimation of diabetes burden 
were accounted for in the estimation of diabetes DALYs. 
For other conditions attributable to high FPG, we report 
their DALYs separately.
The major data inputs for mortality estimation in India 
included Sample Registration System cause of death data 
and some other studies (appendix pp 22–30).
Estimation of risk factor exposure and attributable 
disease burden
The GBD comparative risk assessment framework was 
used to estimate diabetes-related risk factor exposure 
and attributable disease burden.23 Exposure data for 
risk factors with a categorical or continuous distribution 
were collated from all available data sources that could 
be accessed, adjusted using age-sex splitting, and 
strength 
ened with the incorporation of covariates. The 
modelling approach integrated multiple data inputs and 
borrowed information across age, time, and location to 
produce the best possible estimates of risk exposure 
by location, age, sex, and year. For each risk factor, the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level was established 
as the lowest level of risk exposure below which its 
relation with a disease outcome is not supported by 
the available evidence. Estimates of mean risk factor 
exposure, strengthened by covariates, were used to 
calculate summary exposure values for each risk—a 
metric ranging from 0% to 100%—to describe the risk-
weighted exposure for a population or risk-weighted 
prevalence of exposure.

Estimates of mean FPG were produced by age, sex, 
year, and location using the spatial-temporal Gaussian 
process regression framework, adjusting mean FPG 
using a correction factor to account for people with 
diabetes in a population. For the purpose of attributing 
disease burden to FPG, the theoretical minimum risk 
exposure level for FPG was estimated to range from 81 to 
97 mg/dL (mean 90) or 4·5 to 5·4 mmol/L (mean 5·0) as 
a risk for ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic 
kidney disease, with a continuous risk–outcome relation 
above this FPG level.23 FPG more than 126 mg/dL 
(7 mmol/L) was considered to have a categorical 
risk–outcome relation with tuberculosis, neoplasms, 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, cataract, and 
others.23 Similarly, for the purpose of attributing disease 
burden to high body-mass index (BMI), the theoretical 
minimum risk exposure level for BMI at age 20 years or 
more was estimated to range from 20·0 to 25·0 kg/m² 
(mean 22·5), and for age up to 19 years was based on 
the International Obesity Task Force BMI cutoff values 
for normal weight.23,25 The definitions and method 
descriptions of other risk factors are described elsewhere.23
Estimation of attributable disease burden included 
ascertainment of relative risk of disease outcomes for 
risk exposure–disease outcome pairs with sufficient 
evidence of a causal relation in randomised controlled 
trials, prospective cohorts, or case-control studies as 
assessed using an approach similar to the World Cancer 
Research Fund grading system, and then estimation of 
population-attributable fractions for diseases caused by 
each risk factor.23 Estimates of deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and 
DALYs attributable to each risk factor for diabetes were 
produced by location, age, sex, and year.
The major data inputs for the risk factors in India 
included dietary and nutrition surveys from the National 
Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, national household 
surveys such as the National Family Health Survey, 
District Level Household Survey and Annual Health 
Survey, youth and adult tobacco surveys, household 
consumer expenditure surveys of the National Sample 
Survey Organisation, and several large population-level 
surveys (appendix pp 22–30).
GBD uses covariates, which are explanatory variables 
that have a known association with the outcome of 
interest, to arrive at the best possible estimate of that 
outcome when data on the outcome are scarce but data 
on the covariates are available.19–23 This approach was part 
of the estimation process for the findings presented here.

union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 
Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, 
Lakshadweep, and Puducherry). The states of Chhattisgarh, 
Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand were created from existing 
larger states in 2000, and the state of Telangana was created 
in 2014. For trends from 1990 onward, the data for these 
four new states were disaggregated from their parent 
states on the basis of data from the districts that now 
constitute these states. The findings are also presented for 
four groups of states based on epidemiological transition 
level (ETL) as described previously.17 Briefly, ETL state 
groups were defined on the basis of the ratio of DALYs 
from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
diseases to those from NCDs and injuries combined in 
2016, with a lower ratio indicating higher ETL: low ETL 
(ratio 0·56–0·75), lower-middle ETL (0·41–0·55), higher-
middle ETL (0·31–0·40), and high ETL (<0·31).17 We have 
previously reported that epidemiological transition ratios 
of the states of India have a significant inverse relation 
with the Socio-demographic Index calculated by GBD on 
the basis of income, education, and fertility levels, which 
indicates broad correspondence of the ETL groups with 
socio 
demo 
graphic development levels.17
We present prevalence, deaths, and DALYs for diabetes 
and age-specific and sex-specific prevalence of diabetes for 
India in 1990 and 2016. We present the proportion of 
diabetes DALYs that could be attributed to various risk 
factors in 2016. We report the changes in overweight in 
adults aged 20 years or older using the definition of BMI 
25 kg/m² or more.26 We also assessed the contribution of 
high FPG to ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney 
disease, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, neoplasms, 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, cataracts, and 
others. Given the strong association between diabetes and 
overweight, we calculated the number of adults with 
diabetes per 100 overweight adults in India, and compared 
this estimate with the global average.3 We compared the 
age-standardised DALY rate of diabetes in 2016 in India 
with the global average.3
We present both crude and age-standardised estimates 
as relevant. Crude estimates provide the actual situation 
in each state that is useful for policy makers, and age-
standardised estimates allow comparisons over time and 
between states after adjusting for the differences in the 
age structure of the population. The age-standardised 
rates were based on the GBD global reference population.19 
The estimates are reported with 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) where relevant. These intervals were based on 
1000 runs of the models for each quantity of interest, with 
the mean considered as the point estimate and the 
2·5th and 97·5th percentiles considered as the 95% UI 
(appendix p 21).19–23

Results
There were 65·0 million (95% UI 58·7–71·1) prevalent 
cases of diabetes in India in 2016 (appendix p 31), 
compared with 26·0 million (23·4–28·6) in 1990.27 The 
crude prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 20 years or 
older in India increased by 39·4% from 5·5% (4·9–6·1) in 
1990 to 7·7% (6·9–8·4) in 2016, with an increase in every 
state of India from 1990 to 2016. Age-standardised 
prevalence increased by 29·7% (26·5–32·6), with the 
highest increase in states with relatively low crude 
prevalence in 1990, most of which belonged to the 
low  and lower-middle ETL groups (table 1; figure 1; 
appendix p 32). There was a 2·5 times variation in the 
prevalence of diabetes between the states in 2016, with the 
highest prevalence in the south Indian states of Tamil 
Nadu and Kerala (high ETL) and Delhi (higher-middle 
ETL), followed by Punjab and Goa (high ETL), and 
Karnataka (higher-middle ETL; figure 1; appendix p 32). 
Himachal Pradesh was a notable exception in the high 
ETL group, with a relatively low prevalence (appendix p 32). 
The age-specific prevalence of diabetes in India increased 
with increasing age in both 1990 and 2016. The divergence 
between the prevalence in 1990 and 2016 started in young 
adults, becoming statistically significant for men at 
50–54 years (from 10·1% [95% UI 8·7–11·5] in 1990 to 
13·6% [11·8–15·4] in 2016) and for women at 55–59 years 
(from 10·4% [9·1–11·7] in 1990 to 13·5% [11·9–15·2] in 
2016) and remained significant in all older age groups 
(figure 2; appendix p 33).
Diabetes contributed to 3·1% (95% UI 2·9–3·3) of the 
total deaths in India, with slight variation among men 
(2·9%, 95% UI 2·7–3·0) and women (3·4%, 3·0–3·7; 
appendix p 34). The crude death rate due to diabetes 
increased in India from 1990 to 2016 by 131% (111–150) 
from 10·0 (95% UI 8·9–11·0) to 23·1 (21·4–24·5) per 
100 000, and the age-standardised death rate increased by 
64% (48–79). Of the total deaths due to diabetes in 2016, 
42·6% (41·6–43·9) were in people younger than 70 years, 
and this proportion was highest in the low ETL group 
(table 2). However, the crude death rate was highest in the 
high ETL group (table 2).
Diabetes contributed to 2·2% (95% UI 2·1–2·4) of the 
total DALYs in India in 2016 (appendix p 34). Of the total 
diabetes DALYs in 2016, 57·2% were from YLLs and 
42·8% from YLDs.27 The percentage of total DALYs due 
to diabetes was lowest in the low ETL group (1·7%, 95% UI 
1·5–1·9) and highest in the high ETL group 
(4·3%, 4·0–4·7; appendix p 34). The crude DALY rate of 
diabetes in 2016 varied 3·7 times between the states, with 
the highest in Tamil Nadu and Punjab in the high ETL 
group, followed by Karnataka in the higher-middle ETL 
group; the age-standardised DALY rates were also highest 
in these three states (figure 3). The crude DALY rate of 
diabetes increased across all ETL state groups from 1990 
to 2016. The increase in the age-standardised DALY rate 
since 1990 was generally the highest in states with a 
relatively low DALY rate in 1990 (figure 4; appendix p 35). 
The highest change exceeding 60% was in the states of 
Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh in 
the low ETL group; Nagaland in the lower-middle ETL 
group; and Haryana in the higher-middle ETL group. 
Among the major NCDs, diabetes had the highest 
increase in DALY rate in India from 1990 to 2016, with

a crude increase of 80·0% (95% UI 71·6–88·5) and 
an age-standardised increase of 39·6% (32·1–46·7; 
appendix p 36).17 In 2016, the age-standardised DALY rate 
of diabetes in India was 1·3 times the global average.3
Among the risk factors contributing to diabetes in 
India in 2016, high BMI had the highest impact, with 
36·0% (95% UI 22·6–49·2) of the diabetes DALYs 
attributed to it (figure 5). The other risk factors included 
dietary risks, tobacco use, occupational exposure to 
second-hand smoke, low physical activity, and alcohol 
use. It is important to note that the cumulative impact 
of the risk factors would be less than the sum of 
their individual contribution because the risk factors 
over 
lap. In addition, population-attributable fractions 
from components can add up to more than their sum 
even if they are independent. The contribution of high 
BMI was higher in females than in males, whereas the 
contribution of tobacco use, occupational exposure to 
second-hand smoke, and alcohol use were relatively 
higher in men than in women. The percentage of 
diabetes DALYs attributed to high BMI was relatively 
higher in the high ETL state group (50·4% [95% UI 
35·3–63·1]; appendix p 37).
In addition to the 792 DALYs per 100 000 population 
from diabetes in India in 2016, high FPG also con-
tributed substantially to DALYs for other conditions, 
which included ischaemic heart disease (607 DALYs 
[95% UI 384–918] per 100 000 population), chronic 
kidney disease (330 DALYs [285–383]), stroke (226 DALYs 
[149–324]), tuberculosis (103 DALYs [67–142]), cancers 
(30 DALYs [8–61]), Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias (12 DALYs [3–26]), and cataract (11 DALYs 
[2–25]).
The prevalence of overweight in adults aged 20 years or 
older in India increased from 9·0% (95% UI 8·7–9·3) in 
1990 to 20·4% (19·9–20·8) in 2016. This increase occurred 
in every state of India, with a 3·5 times variation across the 
states in 2016 (figure 6; appendix pp 38–39). There were 
substantial variations in the magnitude of increase within 
each ETL state group: 58–147% in the low ETL group, 
95–211% in the lower-middle ETL group, 36–311% in the 
higher-middle ETL group, and 101–184% in the high ETL 
group. The highest prevalence of overweight in 2016 was 
in the high ETL group (32·2%, 95% UI 31·1–33·4), and 
the lowest in the low ETL and lower-middle ETL groups 
(both 16·9%; appendix p 38). The states of Punjab, 
Goa, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu in the high ETL group; 
Uttarakhand and Sikkim in the lower-middle ETL group; 
and Delhi in the higher-middle ETL group had the highest 
prevalence of overweight in India.
Among every 100 overweight adults aged 20 years or 
older in India in 2016, there were 38 adults (95% UI 
34–42) with diabetes, compared with the global average 
of 19 adults (17–21). This rate in India was higher for 
men (42 [95% UI 38–47] for every 100 overweight men) 
than for women (33 [30–37] for every 100 overweight 
women).
Discussion
The findings in this report present a comprehensive 
picture of the rising trend of diabetes in every state of 
India over the past quarter century. The prevalence of 
diabetes in adults aged 20 years or older in India increased 
from 5·5% in 1990 to 7·7% in 2016. This prevalence was 
highest in the more developed states such as Tamil Nadu

and Kerala and in Delhi. Previous prevalence studies on 
diabetes in India, although not strictly comparable with 
each other or with the present analysis on account of 
significant 
differences 
in 
sample 
selection 
and 
methodology, have also confirmed this increase in 
prevalence.28–31 Studies have shown that Asian Indians 
have one of the highest incidence rates of diabetes 
among major ethnic groups, and that progression from 
prediabetes to diabetes appears to occur faster in this 
population.32 Our estimate of 65 million people with 
diabetes in India in 2016 is close to the 73 million estimate 
for 2017 reported by the International Diabetes Federation, 
with overlapping confidence intervals.1
The prevalence of diabetes increased in every state of 
India from 1990 to 2016, with a 2·5 times variation in 
prevalence across the states in 2016. Some of the highest 
increases in age-standardised prevalence from 1990 to 
2016 were in the less developed states. This will pose 
novel challenges to the health-care systems in these 
states that are currently geared predominantly to the 
management of communicable diseases. However, the 
current relatively lower prevalence of diabetes in the less 
developed states  offers a window of opportunity wherein 
measures can be planned and implemented in the less 
developed states to prevent further increases in the 
prevalence of diabetes and to strategically realign health-
care services to meet the rising challenge of NCDs, 
especially diabetes. This is particularly important because 
many of the less developed states are among the most 
populous in India, and even small increases in diabetes 
prevalence in these states will have enormous implications 
for the magnitude of the diabetes burden in the country. 
However, it should also be noted that there is considerable 
heterogeneity in the trajectory of diabetes even within 
the ETL state groups. For instance, Himachal Pradesh, 
despite being a high ETL state, had a relatively low 
prevalence of diabetes, whereas Madhya Pradesh (low 
ETL state) and Tripura (lower-middle ETL state) had 
higher prevalence of diabetes than did other states in 
their ETL group. The magnitude of change in the 
prevalence of diabetes among the northeastern states of 
Manipur and Tripura was very different, even though 
both states belong to the lower-middle ETL group and are 
geographically adjacent to each other. This heterogeneity 
in the prevalence of diabetes within the ETL state groups 
highlights that individual NCDs do not necessarily follow 
the overall NCD trends that are used to define ETL. As 
compared with 1990, we observed higher age-specific 
prevalence of diabetes in 2016, starting in the young adult 
age groups, that reached statistical significance at age 
50–54 years in men and 55–59 years in women. This 
finding is worrying because it portends further large 
increases in the burden of diabetes and its attendant 
complications in the productive age groups in the future.
Diabetes contributed to 3·1% of all deaths in India, 
with an increase in both crude (131%) and age-
standardised (64%) death rates due to diabetes from 1990 
to 2016. If this trend continues, it will pose challenges for 
meeting the national and global targets for reducing 
NCD deaths. The crude death rate was highest in the 
more developed high ETL state group. The increase in 
both the prevalence and death rates from diabetes points 
to possible shortfalls in the management of diabetes, 
such as delayed diagnosis, suboptimal glycaemic control, 
and failure to screen for early-stage complications, 
rendering people with diabetes more prone to the 
development of late-stage complications with attendant 
morbidity and mortality. A recent multistate study has

reported that 47% of the diabetes cases in the population 
were undiagnosed, which highlights the poor awareness 
and detection of diabetes in India.30 It is important to 
note that 43% of deaths due to diabetes in India in 2016 
were in people younger than 70 years. It is of concern 
that the states in the low ETL group, which had the 
lowest prevalence of diabetes, had the highest proportion 
of deaths due to diabetes among people younger than 
70 years, again indicating possible inad 
equacies in 
diabetes management.
The increase in DALYs from diabetes since 1990 in 
India is the highest among major NCDs. The DALY rate 
of diabetes increased in every state of India from 1990 to 
2016, with substantial heterogeneity of 3·7 times between 
the states in 2016. Diabetes did not feature among the top 
30 causes of DALYs in India in 1990, but was the 
13th leading cause of disease burden in 2016.17,18,27 Within 
India, the highest increases in diabetes DALYs occurred 
in states in the less developed low ETL group. This 
finding has important implications for the future 
economic progress of these states, many of which are 
among the least developed in India. It is also worrying 
that YLLs contributed more to the total diabetes DALYs 
than did YLDs; however, this is likely to change with 
improvements in sociodemographic parameters, as has 
occurred for other NCDs elsewhere in the world.22
Among risk factors contributing to DALYs across all 
causes in India, high FPG was the fifth leading risk 
factor.17,18,27 Besides contributing to diabetes, the con-
tribution of high FPG to disease burden from other 
conditions is substantial in India, with DALYs attributable 
to high FPG for ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney 
disease, stroke, tuberculosis, and other conditions 
together exceeding the DALYs attributable to high FPG 
for diabetes.
High BMI was the most important risk factor 
contributing to diabetes in India, suggesting that 
targeting overweight might offer the best results in 
slowing down the rising trend in diabetes across India. 
The prevalence of overweight in adults aged 20 years or 
older in India doubled from 1990 to 2016, with an 
increase observed in every state of India. This increase is 
attributable to the switch from traditional foodstuffs to 
energy-intense, nutrient-poor, high-carbohydrate diets; 
increasingly sedentary occupations; and low levels of 
recreational physical activity occurring as a consequence 
of urbanisation and socioeconomic transition.27,33 The 
higher proportion of diabetes in India among overweight 
adults observed in this study compared with the global 
average highlights an increased risk of diabetes at lower 
levels of BMI among Indians. The possible explanations 
suggested for this phenomenon include low birth-
weight of Indians leading to low metabolic capacity 
coupled with high metabolic load that could be due to 
high levels of body fat, high dietary glycaemic load, and 
sedentary behaviour.34,35 Overweight is related to dietary 
risks, which we also found to be a major risk factor 
for diabetes. In this GBD analysis, we found a relatively 
lower contribution of low physical activity and higher 
contribution of tobacco use to diabetes in India than in 
some previous reports.35,36 These differences could be 
due to variations in exposure definitions of the risks 
and other aspects of study design. For example, the 
reason for the lower estimate of low physical activity 
could have been the inclusion of more cohort studies 
and quantification of total physical activity across all do-
mains, whereas other studies might not have captured 
the full spectrum of physical activity, often limiting 
comparisons between leisure time or low physical activity 
with higher levels of physical activity.37 Similar reasons 
may be responsible for the differences in the association 
between tobacco use and diabetes in GBD versus the 
previous studies. These differences highlight the need 
for more research to understand the link between these 
risk factors and diabetes in the Indian context. In any 
case, physical activity has an important role in reducing 
overweight, and both physical activity and tobacco use 
control are important for preventing a variety of NCDs, 
and therefore should be promoted.
With the rising trajectory of diabetes in every part of 
India, more effective health policy interventions are 
needed to reverse this trend. The National Programme 
for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio-
vascular Diseases and Stroke, launched in 2010, aims to 
prevent and control diabetes through behaviour and 
lifestyle changes, early diagnosis and management, and 
increasing health system capacity.38 Implementation of 
this programme across the states of India has been 
gradual, but is expected to help to reduce the burden of 
NCDs, including diabetes and its risk factors. Ayushman 
Bharat, the National Health Protection Mission, has been 
recently announced by the Indian Government, and 
includes health insurance for poor people and the 
establishment of 150 000 Health and Wellness Centres 
across India to provide compehensive primary health-
care services that are aligned with the leading causes of 
disease burden, including diabetes.39,40 Effective policy 
implementation, if combined with appropriate allocation 
of financial and human resources, and robust disease 
monitoring systems, would help in prevention, treat-
ment, and reduction of diabetes deaths, which in turn 
would curb the growing disease burden in each state 
of India.
The general limitations of the GBD approach have 
been described elsewhere.19–23 Other limitations specific 
for India included an incomplete medically certified 
cause of death reporting system that covers only a small 
proportion of the population in India with variable 
coverage across the states. To address this limitation in 
the analysis, cause of death data obtained through verbal 
autopsy as part of the Sample Registration System from 
all states in India were used, which have been shown 
to be a reasonable alternative when cause of death data 
are not available from the vital registration system.17

Improvements are needed in the vital registration system 
of India for better data on cause of death. Additionally, 
data on  sequelae of diabetes are not available from all 
parts of India, and although population-based FPG data 
have become available recently from nationwide surveys, 
these are not available for earlier years. Another challenge 
is the potential variability in the quality of different large-
scale surveys that might lead to discrepant estimates 
from different sources. However, the use of multiple 
sources in the GBD approach minimises the possibility 
of erroneous trends. The strength of the findings in this 
report includes calculation of diabetes estimates and 
the major risk factors using all available data sources 
that could be accessed for each state of India, application 
of standard GBD methodology, and analysis and 
interpretation of findings over the past 26 years with 
inputs from leading health scientists and policy makers 
in India.
In conclusion, although the prevalence of diabetes 
remains higher in economically and epidemiologically 
advanced states, it has increased more rapidly in the less 
developed states, which are home to a large proportion of 
India’s population. The increase in prevalence of and 
premature deaths due to diabetes highlighted here, along 
with other state-specific findings, underlines the need for 
policy and health-system action commensurate with 
disease burden in each state to ensure more effective 
prevention and management of diabetes. If uncontrolled, 
the health costs of diabetes and its complications are 
likely to take a heavy toll on India’s health-care system in 
the coming decades. India should not lose the opportunity 
to address the major risks for diabetes before the 
situation gets further out of control.
