While a growing body of research is examining the impacts of prolonged occupational sitting on cardiovascular and
other health risk factors, relatively little work has examined the effects of occupational standing. The objectives of this
paper were to examine the relationship between occupations that require predominantly sitting and those that require
predominantly standing and incident heart disease. A prospective cohort study combining responses to a population
health survey with administrative health-care records, linked at the individual level, was conducted in Ontario, Cana-
da. The sample included 7,320 employed labor-market participants (50% male) working 15 hours a week or more
and free of heart disease at baseline. Incident heart disease was assessed using administrative records over an
approximately 12-year follow-up period (2003–2015). Models adjusted for a wide range of potential confounding fac-
tors. Occupations involving predominantly standing were associated with an approximately 2-fold risk of heart dis-
ease compared with occupations involving predominantly sitting. This association was robust to adjustment for other
health, sociodemographic, and work variables. Cardiovascular risk associated with occupations that involve combi-
nations of sitting, standing, and walking differed for men and women, with these occupations associated with lower
cardiovascular risk estimates among men but elevated risk estimates among women.

Cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading cause
of morbidity and mortality worldwide, in particular in high-
income countries (1). Sedentary behavior is gaining increasing
attention as a modifiable risk factor for a number of chronic dis-
ease outcomes, including cardiovasculardisease (2, 3). While sed-
entary behavior in general has been associated with increased risk
of multiple disease outcomes, the available evidence that sed-
entary occupational activity is a cardiovascular risk factor is
less convincing (3). A pooled analysis of 5 cohorts from Eng-
land and 2 cohorts from Scotland (total n = 5,214) reported
no relationship between prolonged occupational sitting, com-
pared with occupations involving standing and walking about,
in relation to cardiovascular mortality over a 12.9-year follow-
up period (4). Another recent examination of the relationship
between occupational sitting time and ischemic heart disease
among a Danish cohort of over 2,500 men and women also re-
ported no relationship between sitting time and ischemic heart
disease over a 12-year follow-up (5).
Compared with the research on prolonged sitting, relatively
little research has examined the health effects of prolonged
occupational standing (6–8). Although few in number, studies
have demonstrated a relationship between prolonged standing
at work and various cardiovascular outcomes (9–12) as well
as other health outcomes such as musculoskeletal pain (7, 8).
The potential mechanisms linking prolonged standing to car-
diovascular outcomes include blood pooling in the lower
limbs, increased hydrostatic venous pressure, and enhanced
oxidative stress (6, 10, 13). Despite these findings, there has
been a greater degree of research emphasis on understanding
the feasibility and effectiveness of reducing prolonged sitting
as opposed to prolonged standing (6, 14).
The objectives of this study were to examine the relation-
ship between imputed occupational body position exposures
focused on sitting, standing, walking, and other body posi-
tions, and incident heart disease over a 12-year period in Ontar-
io, Canada.

 METHODS
The data source for this analysis was respondents to the 2003
Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), whose responses
were linked to administrative information in the Ontario Health
Insurance Plan database covering physician services and the
Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract
Database for hospital admissions. Information from the Ontario
Health Insurance Plan database and the Canadian Institute for
Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was available
up to March 31, 2015. The administrative databases were linked
to the CCHS responses using unique, encoded identifiers and
analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.
The accuracy of the linkage was verified against the Ontario
Registered Persons Database using personal information pro-
vided by respondents, such as health number, given name and
surname, date of birth, age, sex, and postal code.
The CCHS collects information on health conditions, health
behaviors, and working conditions from representative cross-
sectional samples of the Canadian population. The overall
response rate from respondents from Ontario to the 2003
CCHS was 78.5% (15). Of the 40,507 Ontario respondents to
the 2003 CCHS, 34,950 (86%) gave permission for their sur-
vey responses to be linked to administrative health-care data.
Of this sample, a successful linkage was obtained for 33,679
respondents (96% of those who gave permission to link). For
the purpose of this analysis we focused on currently employed
respondents working more than 15 hours per week, who were
35–74 years of age (n = 8,873). Ethics approval for secondary
data analysis was granted through the University of Toronto,
Health Sciences Ethics Board, and the Research Ethics Board
of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.
Patient involvement
This study was an analysis of secondary survey and admin-
istrative data. As such, patients were not involved.
Outcome: incident heart disease
Incident heart disease over the follow-up period was derived
using the Ontario Myocardial Infarction Database and the On-
tario Congestive Heart Failure Database. Both of these databases
were developed using validated algorithms, with sensitivity and
specificity estimates of approximately 0.85 or higher (16–18).
These databases capture cases of heart disease from 1992
onward, providing an approximate 12-year look-back window
for prevalent cases of each condition in our sample. In all regres-
sion models, respondents were right censored at the development
of heart disease, death from causes other than heart disease,
or the end of the follow-up period (March 31, 2015).
Main independent variable: primary type of occupational
posture or body movement
The primary type of posture or body movement required to
perform each respondent’s occupation was imputed based
on occupational information from the Human Resources
and Skills Development Canada’s Career Handbook (19).
The Career Handbook assigns various occupational exposures
to occupations at the 4-digit occupational level, equating to
520 different job titles. For each occupational title, minimum
and maximum exposures for multiple dimensions of work
were assigned by trained occupational analysts using a modi-
fied Delphi procedure. After the consensus ratings for each
occupation and exposure had been developed, the occupa-
tions were additionally reviewed by task to identify poten-
tial abnormalities (19).
The primary type of posture or body movement for each occu-
pational title involves one of 4 possible categories: occupations
requiring primarily sitting; occupations involving primarily
standing and/or walking; occupations involving combina-
tions of sitting, standing, and walking; and work that involves
body postures other than sitting, standing, and walking, such as
bending, stooping, kneeling, and crouching. Using the mini-
mum and maximum occupational exposures, we were able
to classify occupations into those that require predominantly
sitting (where minimum and maximum body position was sit-
ting); those that require predominantly standing (where mini-
mum and maximum body position was standing); occupations
with opportunities for sitting, standing, and walking; and oc-
cupations that predominantly involve working in other body
positions. Examples of the most common types of occupations
for men and women within each of these groups are provided
in Web Table 1 (available at https://academic.oup.com/aje).
Sociodemographic and health-related covariates
Other measures included in analyses were age; whether the
respondent was male or female; marital status and presence of
children under 12 in the house; highest educational level ob-
tained; whether the respondent was born in Canada; respondent
ethnicity (“white” versus other categories); living location
(urban/rural); and self-reported chronic medical conditions that
have been diagnosed by a health professional and are expected
to last, or have lasted, more than 6 months. For chronic health
conditions the following groups were derived: diabetes, high
blood pressure, back problems, mood and anxiety disorders,
and other chronic conditions. We also included a measure
of whether a long-term physical or mental health condition lim-
ited the type or amount of activity the respondent could do at
work (never, sometimes, or often).
Other work-related exposures
In addition to occupational posture and body movement, a
variety of other occupational exposures were also included.
Self-reported exposures included the usual hours worked by
the respondent each week (continuous), the number of weeks
worked in the previous 12 months (weeks worked: 1–26,
27–49, 50 or more weeks), and current shift schedule (reg-
ular, evening or night shift, rotating, or other shift schedules).
Imputed occupational exposures based on occupational title
included the handling of loads 10 kg or greater; exposure
to dangerous chemical substances; exposure to constant or
intermittent noise likely to cause distraction or possible hearing
loss; exposure to oscillating or quivering motions (vibration);
and exposure to noxious, intense, or prolonged odors. Imputed
exposures were defined as dichotomous variables.

 Body mass index and health behaviors
The following measures were available in the data set: body
mass index (BMI) based on self-reported height and weight
(underweight/normal weight, overweight, obese); current
smoking status (regular smoker, occasional smoker, nonsmoker);
alcohol consumption (nondrinker, regular drinker but never hav-
ing 5 or more drinks in one sitting, regular drinker who has 5 or
more drinks on an occasional to weekly basis); and leisure-time
physical activity categorized according to Statistics Canada’s def-
initions (inactive = less than 1.5 kcal/kg/day (e.g., walking less
than half an hour each day), moderately active = between 1.5
and 2.9 kcal/kg/day (e.g., walking 30–60 minutes a day, or tak-
ing an hour-long exercise class 3 times a week), active = at least
3 kcal/kg/day (e.g., walking an hour a day or jogging 20 minutes
a day)). The handling of BMI and health behaviors in the analyt-
ical models is described in further detail below.
Analyses
Of the original sample of 8,873 respondents, 350 (4%)
either reported having preexisting heart disease or were
captured in the Ontario Myocardial Infarction Database or
the Ontario Congestive Heart Failure Database prior to the
interview date, and were removed, leaving a sample of 8,523
respondents. Of this sample, 562 respondents were missing
information on work exposures, with an additional 641 re-
spondents missing information on sociodemographic char-
acteristics, health measures, or health behaviors, leaving a
final analytical sample of 7,320 respondents (50% male),
which is 86% of the eligible sample. A logistic regression
analysis examined variables associated with the probability
of missing work exposures, and missing sociodemographic,
health, or health-behavior measures. Men were more likely
than women to be missing work-exposure information, while
women, respondents in urban locations, and those working in
other body positions were more likely to be missing sociode-
mographic, health, or health-behavior measures. No relation-
ship was found between age and having missing information
on work exposures or having missing information on sociode-
mographic, health, or health-behavior measures.
Initial descriptive analyses examined the relationships
between incident heart disease and occupational standing and
sitting. Time-to-event regression models then examined the
relationships between occupational standing and sitting expo-
sures using a series of nested regression models. The first
model was adjusted for age, sex, education, and weeks of work
in the previous 12 months (minimal-adjustment model).
Additional adjustment was made for other sociodemographic
variables, followed by a model that additionally included other
work exposures. A final model adjusted for BMI and health
behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physi-
cal activity). The reason for the separate adjustment for BMI
and health behaviors is because it is not clear whether these
factors are confounders or mediators in the occupational-
exposure-to-heart-disease outcome relationship. Because it is
unlikely that an individual’s BMI or health behaviors result in
them being in particular occupations, including these factors
in regression models could be considered a form of overad-
justment (20).
To ensure an adequate number of predictors to events in our
final models, work exposures that were not related to heart dis-
ease in either univariate or multivariable models were removed.
The main exclusions were other occupational exposures, which
included dangerous chemical substances, noise, vibration, and
odors. Regression models were fitted for the full sample and
separately for men and women to examine differences in the re-
lationships between occupational exposures and heart disease
outcomes among men and women. Differences between esti-
mates from sex-specific regression models were assessed using
methods that take into account the estimate and standard error
around the estimate from stratified regression models (21, 22).
A final set of models examined the relationships between occu-
pational exposures and incident heart disease, removing events
that occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up to reduce the pos-
sibility of reverse causation.
All analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina), and survey weights were
applied to the sample to account for the initial probability of
selection into the CCHS and nonresponse to the survey, as
recommended by Statistics Canada (15). To account for the
clustered design of the CCHS, variance estimates around each
prevalence and hazard ratio have been adjusted using 500
bootstrap replicate weights using the SURVEY procedures
in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc.) (23).
RESULTS
Table 1 presents descriptive information for incident heart
disease across our main independent variable and for men and
women. Over the study period, there were 83,424 person-
years of follow-up (median follow-up 11.73 years); 3.4% of
the study population developed heart disease, with a higher
incidence among men (4.6%) than women (2.1%). The risk
of incident heart disease was elevated among occupations
requiring predominantly standing compared with occupations
requiring predominantly sitting. No statistically significant dif-
ferences were observed in the incidence of heart disease across
other occupational exposure groups. Additional information
on the incidence of heart disease across all other study variables
is available in Web Table 2.
Table 2 presents hazard ratios for occupational standing
and sitting after adjustment for age, sex, education, and weeks
worked (model 1); model 1 with other sociodemographic and
health-related conditions (model 2); model 2 with other work
exposures (model 3); and model 3 with health behaviors and
BMI (model 4). Similar to the descriptive analyses, predomi-
nantly standing occupations were associated with an increased
risk of heart disease compared with sitting occupations (haz-
ard ratio (HR) = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11,
4.27) after adjustment for sociodemographic, health, and
work-related variables. Additional adjustment for BMI and
health behaviors attenuated this association slightly; however,
workers employed in occupations that required predominantly
standing were still almost twice as likely to have incident
heart disease over the study period compared with those whose
work predominantly required sitting (HR = 1.97, 95% CI:
0.99, 3.90). These estimates remained robust to potential
reverse causation, slightly strengthening, and in the case of
model 4 attaining statistical significance, after the removal of

 incident cases of heart disease that occurred in the first 2 years
of follow-up (for model 3: HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.10, 4.46; for
model 4, HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.00, 4.24; results not shown).
Table 3 provides hazard ratio estimates for occupational
standing and sitting exposures separately for men and women.
The hazard ratio estimates for standing occupations were
relatively consistent among men and women (HR = 2.01 for
men; HR = 1.86 for women). However, the hazard ratio esti-
mates for occupations that require combinations of sitting,
standing, and walking, compared with those that required pre-
dominantly sitting, differed between men and women. Among
men, occupations involving sitting, standing, and walking
were associated with a protective hazard ratio for heart disease
risk (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.33, 1.13), but an elevated hazard
ratio was observed among women (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.78,
4.12). While neither of these estimates reached statistical
significance, the difference between the hazard ratio estimates
for men and women was statistically significant. Similar to the
hazard ratio estimates in the full sample, removing incident
cases of heart disease in the first 2 years of follow-up strength-
ened these estimates, with the protective hazard ratio estimate
for combinations of standing, walking and sitting achieving
statistical significance among men in this sensitivity analysis
(HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.88; results not shown).
DISCUSSION
The health impact of increases in sedentary occupational
exposures has attracted a great deal of recent research interest
(2, 3, 14). While work in this area has examined the impact
of prolonged occupational sitting, relatively little research
has examined the health impacts of prolonged standing.

 Ontario, Canada, we observed that occupations that involve
predominantly standing were associated with a 2-fold risk of
incident heart disease, compared with predominantly sitting
occupations, over a 12-year follow-up period. Estimates were
similar for men and women and robust to adjustment for other
health, sociodemographic, and work exposures. Adjustment
for health behaviors and body mass index led to an attenuation
of hazard ratio estimates associated with predominantly stand-
ing occupations. After this adjustment, although the resulting
hazard ratio was still close to 2, the lower bound of the confi-
dence interval was just below 1. In addition, the risk associ-
ated with occupational standing strengthened in a sensitivity
analysis in which heart cases in the first 2 years of follow-up
were removed. The cardiovascular risk associated with occupa-
tions that involve combinations of sitting, standing, and walking
differed for men and women, with these occupations associ-
ated with protective cardiovascular risk estimates among men
but elevated (although not statistically significant) cardiovas-
cular risk estimates among women. Taken together these find-
ings suggest that occupational standing should receive similar,
if not more, attention than occupational sitting, in relation to
potential adverse cardiovascular outcomes (6, 14).
These findings have important implications for the preven-
tion of cardiovascular disease and the role of the work envi-
ronment as a cardiovascular risk factor. First, predominantly
standing occupations, as opposed to predominantly sitting oc-
cupations, comprised the occupational body position category
most strongly associated with heart disease. This finding sug-
gests that combinations of sitting and standing are likely to
have beneficial cardiovascular health benefits. However, the
introduction of this type of work environment should not
focus only on occupations that involve prolonged sitting but
also on occupations that involve prolonged standing (14).
Predominantly standing occupations were not as common as
predominantly sitting occupations in our sample. The preva-
lence of this exposure was just under 10% among our cohort of
employed respondents, who were aged 35 or older and free of
heart disease at baseline.
Second, the sex-specific differences in the hazard ratio
estimates of standing, sitting, and walking occupations dem-
onstrate that other work-context factors can also shape the
effectiveness of workplace-based interventions to increase
occupational physical activity. While occupations that involved
combinations of sitting, standing, and walking were associated
with a decreased risk of heart disease among men, they were
associated with an increased risk of heart disease among
women. Examination of common occupational titles within
sitting, standing, and walking occupations showed that the
types of occupations within this occupational group dif-
fered greatly for men and women (Web Table 1), and this is
one potential reason for this difference in estimates (6, 24).
In addition, research has shown that the physical and psy-
chosocial work environment can differ for men and women
even within the same occupational title (25), and it is pos-
sible that these differences are more pronounced in sitting,
standing, and walking occupations than they are in prolonged
standing or prolonged sitting occupations. This differential
association of occupations that involve greater walking and
cardiovascular outcomes for men and women suggests that
a focus solely on occupational activity, ignoring other occu-
pational conditions such as the psychosocial and other as-
pects of the physical work environment, is unlikely to lead
to meaningful changes in cardiovascular risk (26).
These findings should be interpreted in light of the following
strengths and limitations. The administrative data used to cap-
ture heart disease require use of health services, and therefore
they will not capture out-of-hospital myocardial infarction or
angina. However, because of the publically funded health-care
system in Ontario, out-of-hospital services are likely relatively
rare in comparison with those captured in each database. The
assessment of working conditions involved assessment at one
point in time, and we have no information beyond the 12
months prior to the survey as to the occupational title, or
labor-market participation, of each respondent. While the
use of imputation based on occupational title does have ad-
vantages in limiting the potential for common-method bias
to inflate the association between perceived occupational
standing or sitting and unmeasured risk factors for heart dis-
ease (27), as well as the demonstrated inconsistency between
self-reported and objectively measured sitting (28), it also pre-
sents a limitation in that potentially important differences
within occupational groups (e.g., the ability to take breaks

 during the work schedule) are assumed to be equivalent across
all members of the same occupational classification, although
this may not be the case (6). In addition, we have limited infor-
mation on the amount of time spent standing or sitting in each
occupational group, and this may be important in assessing
the relationship between sitting and standing and health outc-
omes (29). The potential misclassification introduced by these
factors would likely lead to a bias toward the null in the esti-
mates for occupational sitting and standing, and therefore the
estimates presented in this paper may be underestimates of the
true association between occupational standing and cardio-
vascular disease.
Strengths of the present study include our ability to adjust
for a wide range of covariates, related and unrelated to work,
that could potentially confound the relationship between occu-
pational body position and incident heart disease, and our abil-
ity to examine the potential for reverse causation in explaining
our findings. Our ability to minimize reverse causation could
be one explanation for why our findings differ from previous
studies that have demonstrated a protective relationship between
greater daily time spent standing (not necessarily occupational)
and mortality (30, 31).
In conclusion, in a study of more than 7,300 Canadians, oc-
cupations that involve primarily standing represent an impor-
tant, but often overlooked, cardiovascular risk factor, one that is
independent of other health, sociodemographic, and labor-
market characteristics. This evidence suggests that primary
prevention efforts targeted toward reducing occupational stand-
ing should be considered, while taking into account the broader
occupational context and potential differences in occupational
context between men and women.
