BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread in the
Americas, including parts of the southern United States,
and infection can be associated with serious
complications, including congenital brain abnormalities.
Probable transfusion transmission of ZIKV has been
documented in Brazil.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Preemptive
testing of blood donations for ZIKV RNA was
implemented in southern US states at risk of local
transmission using a test approved under a Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug
application, cobas Zika. Screening was expanded after
issuance of an updated FDA guidance. Donations
reactive on initial screening were further tested by
nucleic acid and antibody tests to determine the donor
status.
RESULTS: Of 358,786 donations from US states
screened by individual donation testing, 23 were initially
reactive on cobas Zika. Fourteen of these represented
probable ZIKV infection based on reactivity on additional
nucleic acid testing or anti-Zika immunoglobulin M. Ten of
the 14 donors reported travel to an identified ZIKV-active
area within 90 days before donation (median time from
end of travel to donation, 25 days; range, 6-71 days).
Three donors with travel history also had a potential
sexual exposure. Only seven of the 14 donations with
probable ZIKV infection were detectable upon 1:6 dilution
to simulate minipool testing. The estimated specificity of
the cobas Zika test was 99.997%.
CONCLUSION: Screening of donations for ZIKV RNA
can interdict ZIKV-infected donors. Donor risk factors
include travel more than 4 weeks before donation and
sexual exposure. Minipool screening would have
detected only 50% of the RNA-positive donations.

 Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped single-stranded
RNA arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family.1 Infec-
tion is primarily transmitted to humans via Aedes
species mosquitoes,2 but intrauterine,3 perinatal,4
sexual,5,6 laboratory-acquired,7 and probable transfusion-
associated transmission2,8,9 have also been reported.
ZIKV infection is asymptomatic in an estimated 80%
of infections in adults and, when symptomatic, usually
presents as a mild self-limited illness.2 Intrauterine infec-
tion, however, can cause microcephaly and other serious
brain and nervous system abnormalities in the fetus.2,10
ZIKV infection has also been linked to Guillain-Barr�
e and
other neurologic syndromes.2,11 Due to the potential
severe consequences of infection, ZIKV was deemed to be
a significant public health threat and became a nationally
notifiable condition in the United States in 2016.
ZIKV appeared in Brazil in 2013 or 2014 and became
epidemic there in 2015.1,7,12 By early 2016, locally acquired
ZIKV cases had been reported in Mexico and more than
30 countries in South America, Central America, and the
Caribbean. The first locally acquired ZIKV cases in the
United States were reported in Puerto Rico, a US territory,
in December 2015.7 Travel-related ZIKV cases began to
appear in several US states by January 2016, followed by
an increasing number of sexually transmitted cases
involving returning travelers.2,13
During a 2013 to 2014 French Polynesia ZIKV outbreak,
approximately 3% of donations from asymptomatic blood
donors were reactive when tested with an in-house ZIKV
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.14 Cases of probable
transfusion-transmitted infection have been documented
in Brazil.2,8,9 Concern about the risk of ZIKV transmission
via transfusion prompted the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) to issue a guidance on February 16, 2016, rec-
ommending that blood components collected in ZIKV-
active areas of the United States or its territories could be
used only if 1) the donations were screened with a ZIKV
nucleic acid test (NAT)—no ZIKV NAT was then available—
or 2) the components were treated with an FDA-approved
pathogen-reduction technology, which was available for
use with platelets or plasma but not red blood cells
(RBCs).15 The impact of the FDA’s February 16th guidance
was to halt local whole blood collection in Puerto Rico on
March 7, 2016. This necessitated importation of blood
products from the US states to Puerto Rico. For areas with-
out local transmission, the guidance recommended defer-
ral of potential donors, if in the prior 4 weeks they had
traveled to or resided in ZIKV-active areas or had sexual
contact with a man who had been diagnosed with ZIKV or
who had been in ZIKV-active areas.15
On March 30, 2016, the FDA approved the use of an
investigational donor screening test for ZIKV RNA, cobas
Zika (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. [RMS]) under an
investigational new drug (IND) application. On April 2,
2016, whole blood donations resumed in Puerto Rico with
testing under this IND. The prevalence of Puerto Rico
donations reactive for ZIKV RNA was approximately 0.3%
initially,
increasing
to
approximately
1.8%
by
July
2016.16,17 From May through August 2016, testing of
donations under IND was initiated by some blood banks
in southern US states, where Ae. aegypti mosquitos are
present. In August 2016, after detection of some ZIKV
RNA–positive donations in US states, the FDA issued a
revised guidance requiring initiation of testing of all US
blood donations for ZIKV RNA within a specified time
frame.18 With initiation of testing under the August 2016
guidance, donor questioning for ZIKV risk could be dis-
continued. This report describes the first cases of ZIKV-
positive donations in US states.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Donor screening
Donor screening for ZIKV RNA was conducted under an
IND application for the cobas Zika test for use with the
cobas 6800/8800 systems (cobas Zika) and with approval
of an institutional review board. Donors from participat-
ing blood centers were provided with information about
the investigational assay and informed consent was
obtained. EDTA plasma from a blood sample obtained at
the time of donation was tested with cobas Zika at a
participating testing laboratory. Each donation was tested
using an individual, unpooled, plasma sample.
If a donation was reactive on cobas Zika, the testing
laboratory performed two repeat tests with cobas Zika using
a plasma sample from a donor tube or plasma bag and also
tested a donor plasma sample in a simulated pool of 6 by
diluting the sample 1:6 with ZIKV-negative human plasma
provided by RMS. In addition, samples from all donations
reactive on cobas Zika were shipped to Blood Systems
Research Institute for alternate NATand serology testing.
Alternate NAT and serology testing
Detailed methods for the Zika alternate NAT and serology
are provided in Appendix S1 (available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper). Zika alter-
nate NAT was performed on plasma samples from index
donations and on residual RBC samples, when available.
Zika alternate NAT results were interpreted as equivocal or
positive if one or both, respectively, of two replicates
crossed the fluorescence threshold within 40 cycles. “Viral
load” was estimated by comparing sample cycle threshold
to a standard curve. The limit of detection of this alternate
NAT is approximately 40-fold higher (i.e., less sensitive)
than the cobas Zika test by PROBIT analysis of testing per-
formed with each test on the same material (data on file
at RMS). Zika serology was performed using Zika MAC-
ELISA

 [CDC])19 for anti-Zika immunoglobulin (Ig)M detection
and by the same assay modified with an anti-IgG capture
antibody for anti-flavivirus IgG detection.
Follow-up study
Each donor with an initially reactive cobas Zika result was
invited to enroll in a follow-up study that involved retesting
with cobas Zika and Zika serology at two additional time
points: within 2 weeks and between 2 and 8 weeks after the
initial cobas Zika-reactive donation.
Definition of probable ZIKV infection
For the purpose of this article, donors reactive on the ini-
tial screen by cobas Zika were considered to represent
probable ZIKV infection if they were reactive on at least
one replicate of repeat testing by cobas Zika on the index
donation or a follow-up sample, reactive on the alternate
NAT on plasma from the index donation or positive for
anti-Zika IgM on the index donation or a follow-up
sample.
Assessment of donor risk factors
Donors with reactive results on cobas Zika were contacted
by the blood centers and/or the state health departments
and assessed for potential exposure to, or risk factors for,
ZIKV infection. In Florida, notification to the state Depart-
ment of Health (DOH) by blood centers or testing facilities
generally occurred within 24 to 48 hours of the initial
reactive test result. Blood centers immediately provided
the state DOH officials donor contact information. Testing
facilities forwarded a portion of the reactive sample to the
state public health laboratory for public health confirma-
tory testing. County health department epidemiologists
were provided donor information and instituted standard
protocols for ZIKV infection case finding. This included
interviewing the donor to identify the donor’s potential
exposure location and potential route of transmission and
identifying locations where an infected donor could have
introduced ZIKV to mosquito vectors. The donor was also
requested to provide additional samples including serum,
urine, and whole blood. Local mosquito control districts
were promptly notified of any locations mosquito abate-
ment activities should occur. Standard risk factor informa-
tion collected by the Florida DOH included travel history
for the 6 months before blood donation and contact with
potentially infected sexual partners during the same peri-
od of time. A travel destination was considered to have
active ZIKV transmission according to the CDC designa-
tion. This included travel to three small areas of Miami-
Dade County, Florida, during times these areas were tem-
porarily determined by CDC and state health officials to
have active ZIKV transmission. A donor was designated as
having risk for sexual transmission of ZIKV if, in the
6 months before donation, the donor reported sexual
contact with a male or female partner who had traveled to
a ZIKV-active area within the 6 months before the contact.
When possible, samples for ZIKV testing were obtained by
the DOH from sexual contacts. Donors were also asked
whether they had experienced any of the four common
symptoms of ZIKV infection (rash, fever, conjunctivitis,
and arthralgia) in the 2 weeks before or after donation, as
well as during and up to 2 weeks after reported travel to a
ZIKV-active area.
RESULTS
From May 23 through October 9, 2016, a total of 358,786
donations from US states were screened by cobas Zika (Fig.
1). The majority of donations were from the southern Unit-
ed States. Blood centers from additional states joined after
the FDA issued its August 2016 guidance. Twenty-three
donations were reactive on the initial screen. Nine of these
donations were nonreactive on all additional testing per-
formed on the index donation. Of these, four donors com-
pleted follow-up and were negative for Zika RNA, anti-Zika
IgM, and anti-flavivirus IgG on two follow-up visits. Five
donors did not complete follow-up. Of the nine donations
that were nonreactive on all of the additional testing
performed on the index donation as part of the IND proto-
col, three also had residual RBCs tested by alternate NAT,
and all three were negative.
Fourteen donations met criteria for probable ZIKV
infection based on reactivity on additional NAT on the
index donation or follow-up or positive anti-Zika IgM on
index or follow-up (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Nine of these don-
ations were repeat reactive on cobas Zika; of these, seven
donations were positive on the alternate NAT performed
on plasma, with estimated viral loads ranging from
1 3 103 to 8 3 106 copies/mL. Of the nine repeat-reactive
donations, four were positive for anti-Zika IgM.
Five of the initially reactive donations were nonreac-
tive on repeat cobas Zika and alternate NAT performed on
plasma, but were positive for anti-Zika IgM (Table 1,
Donors 9, 11, 14, 18, and 19). Residual RBCs were available
for testing by alternate NAT from the index donation from
four of these donors and from a follow-up sample from
the remaining donor (Donor 18). The alternative NAT was
positive on all of these RBC samples, with estimated viral
loads in the RBC ranging from 1.7 3 103 to 6.5 3 104
copies/mL (Table 1). Simulated minipool testing (testing
at a 1:6 dilution) was reactive only on the seven donations
that were positive by alternate NAT on plasma.
The specificity of the cobas Zika test was calculated
as the percentage of donations without ZIKV infection
that were nonreactive on cobas Zika. For this calculation,
donations were assumed to be without ZIKV infection if
they were nonreactive on the initial screen with cobas
Zika or were initially reactive on cobas Zika but did not
satisfy the criteria for probable ZIKV infection. The

 estimated specificity of the cobas Zika test is 358,763/
358,772 or 99.997% (95% exact confidence interval [CI],
99.995%-99.999%).
Risk factors for ZIKV for the 14 donors with probable
ZIKV infection are summarized in Table 2. Donors ranged
in age from 17 to 70 years and included nine males and
five females. Donor residence included seven counties in
south Florida as well as counties in the central and north-
ern parts of the state. Ten of 14 donors were found to have
travel or sexual exposure risks, including three donors
who had risk factors for both. Risk factor information
could not be obtained for one donor. Of the 10 donors
with travel risk, the median time from date last in a ZIKV-
active area to donation date was 25 days (range, 6-71
days). Travel locations are shown in Table 2. Three donors
had no travel to identified ZIKV-active areas and were
attributed as sporadic individual infections acquired in
Miami-Dade County. Three donors had potential sexual
exposure to ZIKV in addition to a travel risk: two had trav-
eled with their sexual partner to the ZIKV-active area, and
one reported sexual contact with a visitor from a ZIKV-
active area. Two of the sexual partners were female and
one was male. Sexual contact was within 2 months of
donation for all three donors. One donor (Donor 4) had
sexual contact with his partner while she had symptoms
compatible with ZIKV infection; the partner was tested
and had positive ZIKV laboratory results. The other two
partners reportedly had no symptoms and were not avail-
able for testing.
Six (43%) of 14 donors with probable ZIKV infection
reported one or more of the four major symptoms associ-
ated with ZIKV infection, seven donors reported no ZIKV
symptoms, and symptom information was not available
for one donor. Three donors reported symptom onset 0 to
6 days after donation and, in all of these cases, the index
donation plasma was confirmed as positive by repeat
cobas Zika testing and alternate NAT and was negative for
anti-Zika IgM. Three additional donors reported symp-
toms consistent with ZIKV infection 21 to 62 days before
donation. Each of these three donors had traveled to a
Fig. 1. Results of cobas Zika screening. The flowchart indicates the results of cobas Zika screening and the additional testing of
donors with initially reactive results. Repeat cobas Zika was designated as reactive (R) if one or both repeat tests on undiluted
specimens was reactive or if repeat testing was not performed but simulated minipool testing was reactive. Repeat testing was
designated nonreactive (NR) if repeat testing and simulated minipool testing were both nonreactive. Results of follow-up (f/u)
antibody testing are shown for donors that did not demonstrate anti-Zika IgM on the index donation. Alternate NAT results for
RBCs are indicated, when available, for donors who were negative on the plasma alternate NAT.

 ZIKV-active area within 2 weeks before symptom onset
and, in all three, the index donation was negative by alter-
nate NAT on plasma but positive for anti-Zika IgM. In one
case (Donor 9), the donor had been diagnosed with ZIKV
infection just over 1 month before donation. This donor’s
physician had ordered clinical testing for ZIKV because of
symptoms arising after her travel to Mexico; a serum sam-
ple collected 35 days before blood donation was reported
as ZIKV PCR positive by a commercial laboratory.
DISCUSSION
This article reports the first blood donations in US states
found to be positive for ZIKV infection. As of October 9,
2016, a total of 23 donations were identified that had ini-
tially reactive results on the cobas Zika test. Of these, 14
represent probable ZIKV infection based on the presence
of reactivity on additional NAT or anti-Zika IgM testing.
Seven of these 14 donations were reactive on the less sen-
sitive alternate NAT assay performed on plasma samples.
Seven donations were nonreactive on the alternate NAT
on plasma but were IgM positive; RBCs were available
from six of these for testing by alternate NAT, and all were
positive. This suggests that donations initially reactive by
cobas Zika and containing anti-Zika IgM represent true
positive infections.
We cannot rule out the possibility that some of the
nine initially reactive donors with negative results on
additional testing of the index donation may also repre-
sent true positive infections. Only four of these donors
completed follow-up, and we cannot determine whether
the others may have seroconverted. Assuming, however,
that these nine represent false-positive initial reactivity,
the estimated specificity of the cobas Zika assay was
99.997% (95% exact CI, 99.995%-99.999%).
All of the probable ZIKV infections were collected in
Florida. Local mosquito-related transmission has been
identified in some areas of southern Florida;20 however,
eight of the probable ZIKV donors reported risk factors
related to travel to a Zika-active area outside of the 50 US
states and/or sexual contact with an individual who had
been in a Zika-active area outside of the US states. Three
donors (Donors 3, 4, and 5) donated when questioning
about travel to ZIKV active areas was included in donor
screening but did not reveal the travel risk at the time of
donation. Four donors (Donors 9, 14, 17, and 18) had a
travel risk that ended more than 4 weeks before the dona-
tion, including one donor who returned from travel 39
days before donation and tested ZIKV PCR positive at a
commercial laboratory 35 days before donation. This sug-
gests that a 4-week travel deferral may not be sufficient to
exclude all RNA-positive donors. In the donors with
remote
travel
risk,
ZIKV
RNA was
not
consistently
detectable by individual-donation NAT and not detectable
in plasma by the less sensitive alternate NAT; these dona-
tions were IgM positive with detectable ZIKV RNA in RBC
samples.

 Two
male
donors
reported
sexual
contact
with
females with ZIKV risk factors; this contact had not been
identified as a potential risk in the initial FDA guidance
but has more recently been reported.6 A third donor with
potential sexual exposure was a female who had sexual
contact with a male partner. All three of these donors with
potential sexual exposure had also been in ZIKV-active
areas, so it is not possible to determine the route by which
they acquired their ZIKV infection.
Only seven of 14 probable ZIKV-infected donations
were detectable when retested at 1:6 dilution to simulate
minipool testing. The donations nonreactive in simulated
minipool testing were all IgM positive. These findings are
consistent with recent findings in Puerto Rico where
approximately 70% of the cobas Zika–reactive donations
have been detectable in a simulated minipool (data on file
at RMS).
Transfusion transmission of ZIKV has been docu-
mented outside of the United States.2,8,9 Although symp-
tomatic infection in recipients has not been documented
in the few cases reported to date, the potential exists for
serious consequences not only to transfusion recipients
themselves, but also to fetuses or pregnant contacts of
recipients. The minimum infectious dose for transmission
of ZIKV is not known, nor is it known how the presence of
antibody, found in nine of 14 probable ZIKV donations,
may impact the infectivity of these donations. In the
absence of this information, and with evidence that a sig-
nificant proportion of infected donations might be missed
by screening using a minipool format, the FDA has man-
dated that ZIKV donor screening be performed in an
individual-donation testing format.18
As of November 16, 2016, more than 4000 ZIKV-
infected travelers had been reported in 49 US states and
the District of Columbia.13 Of these, 39% were reported in
Florida and New York. There were 35 additional cases
linked to sexual transmission from travelers.13 This article
highlights the fact that donors may acquire ZIKV infection
by travel or sexual contact, and therefore, screening dona-
tions only in areas identified as having active mosquito-
related transmission may fail to fully protect the blood
supply. Donors who have traveled to ZIKV-active areas
may not always report this at the time of donation. Fur-
thermore, it appears that a 4-week travel deferral may not
be sufficient to exclude all RNA-positive donors.
Consistent with recent reports,21,22 Zika RNA was
detectable in the RBC of some anti-Zika IgM–positive
samples in which RNA was not reproducibly demonstra-
ble in plasma. Persistent detection of viral RNA in the RBC
compartment, compared to plasma, has also been previ-
ously reported for West Nile virus;23 however, transfusion
transmission of West Nile virus by products with RNA
only in RBCs has not been documented. Thus, the blood
safety implication of the detection of ZIKV RNA in RBC
samples after appearance of IgM antibody and clearance
of ZIKV RNA from plasma is not clear. Thus far, virus has
not been cultured from such samples;21,22 additional
information regarding infectivity may be gained from
inoculation studies in nonhuman primates and recipient
lookback studies.
Donor screening enhanced public health surveillance
in Florida by resulting in the direct identification of 14 ZIKV
infections. Prompt reporting of reactive donors resulted in
rapid notification to local mosquito control officials of sus-
pected ZIKV cases. Timely mosquito control response can
reduce the probability of ZIKV introduction and facilitate a
rapid response to potential ZIKV introductions.
Preemptive implementation of donor screening in US
states has identified asymptomatic infections that would
have otherwise been unrecognized, including donors with
RNA circulating more than 4 weeks after the end of travel to
ZIKV-active areas. In addition to improving blood safety,
donor screening can remove the need for regional deferrals,
thereby maintaining the adequacy of the local blood supply.
Given that most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, donor
screening also enhances public health surveillance and
understanding of the epidemiology of infection.16
In conclusion, screening of blood donations by indi-
vidual donation testing for ZIKV RNA has interdicted
ZIKV-positive donations. Risk factors for donors of these
ZIKV-positive donations included travel and sexual con-
tact, indicating the potential shortcoming of donor testing
only in areas of active mosquito transmission. Donor test-
ing for ZIKV RNA has now been mandated throughout the
United States.
