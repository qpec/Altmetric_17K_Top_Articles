This randomized controlled trial examines the efficacy of metacognitive therapy (MCT) for
depression. Thirty-nine patients with depression were randomly assigned to immediate
MCT (10 sessions) or a 10-week wait list period (WL). The WL-group received 10
sessions of MCT after the waiting period. Two participants dropped out from WL and
none dropped out of immediate MCT treatment. Participants receiving MCT improved
significantly more than the WL group. Large controlled effect sizes were observed for
both depressive (d = 2.51) and anxious symptoms (d = 1.92). Approximately 70–80%
could be classified as recovered at post-treatment and 6 months follow-up following
immediate MCT, whilst 5% of the WL patients recovered during the waiting period. The
results suggest that MCT is a promising treatment for depression. Future controlled
studies should compare MCT with other active treatments.

INTRODUCTION
Depression has been described as one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with a high degree
of comorbidity (Kessler et al., 2003). By 2030, depression is predicted to be the second-leading
cause of disease burden worldwide after HIV/AIDS (Mathers and Loncar, 2006). It is therefore
essential to develop effective treatments for depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is
the recommended treatment for depression, with a large number of clinical trials supporting its
efficacy (Butler et al., 2006). However, only 40–
58% of patients receiving CBT are recovered at
post-treatment (Dimidjian et al., 2006). Relapse rates are between 40 to 60% within a period of
2 years (Hollon et al., 2006; Vittengl et al., 2007). Antidepressant medication has a similar efficacy
in treating depression (Parker et al., 2008). It is therefore necessary to develop new treatments that
have greater short-term and long-term efficacy.
A new treatment approach to depression that has produced encouraging results is metacognitive
therapy (MCT; Wells, 2009). This approach is based on the metacognitive model where
psychological disorder results from an inflexible and maladaptive response pattern to cognitive
events labeled the Cognitive Attentional Syndrome (CAS; Wells, 2000; Wells and Matthews, 1994,
1996). The CAS consists of persistent worry and rumination, threat monitoring and ineffective
coping strategies that contribute to the maintenance of emotional disorder. Rumination in

MCT for Depression
depression is seen as a coping strategy which follows an
initial
negative
thought
labeled
a
‘
trigger
thought’
.
The
depressed individual engages in rumination consisting of
repeatedly analyzing negative feelings, past failures and mistakes.
Depression is therefore understood as an extension of low
mood resulting from a problem of overthinking (e.g., worry
and rumination) and withdrawal of active coping. (e.g., social
withdrawal and reduction in activity). According to the
metacognitive model of depression, rumination and worry is
maintained by metacognitions and not by changes in mood
or events. Further, this response to triggers extends negative
thinking, leads to reduced attentional flexibility and involves
a failure to exercise appropriate control over negative affective
experiences (Wells, 2009).
According to the metacognitive model metacognitive beliefs
control, monitor and appraise the CAS (Wells, 2009). There
are both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs. Positive
metacognitions are concerned with the benefits of worry
and rumination, while negative metacognitions are concerned
with the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts. Positive
metacognitions related to depression may be exemplified by
statements like: “
Analyzing the causes of my sadness will give
me an answer to the problem”
, and “
Thinking the worst
will make me snap out of it”
. Such positive metacognitive
beliefs lead to repeated and/or prolonged engagement in
ruminative thinking. Negative metacognitions are activated as
the rumination process leads to distress and/or as a result
of what the individual learns about depression. Examples of
negative metacognitions are: “
I can’
t control my thinking”
, “
My
thoughts are caused by my defective brain”
, “
Sleeping more
will sort out my mind”
. and “
Thinking like this means I could
have a mental breakdown”
. Negative metacognitions lead to
more distress and to unhelpful behaviors that reduce effective
coping.
Metacognitive therapy aims to eliminate the CAS and
to modify erroneous metacognitive beliefs to enable the
development of greater flexible reactions to negative internal
events. It does so by using behavioral experiments and
verbal reattribution (Wells and Matthews, 1996; Wells, 2009),
targeted at metacognitive change and specific techniques such
as the attention training technique, detached mindfulness
and postponement of rumination. According to metacogntive
therapy this will enhance flexible executive control, and
through the process of therapy the patient learns new and
more beneficial ways of relating to thoughts that act as
triggers for rumination (Wells, 2009). To clarify the differences
between CBT and MCT; CBT focus on the content of
thoughts and invites the patient to reality test this content,
while in MCT thinking processes are addressed (for further
descriptions of differences and similarities confer Fisher and
Wells, 2009).
A recent meta-analysis of MCT for anxiety and depression
concluded that MCT is effective and superior to waiting list and
possibly CBT (Normann et al., 2014). The review by Normann
et al. (2014) included two treatment studies on depression
(Nordahl, 2009; Wells et al., 2012), one postpartum depression
study (Bevan et al., 2013) as well as results from an unpublished
study. Within-group effect size for depression trials in the
review was 2.18 (Hedges g) at post-treatment. However, only the
Nordahl (2009) study was a randomized trial and the primary
problem was not exclusively depression. A previous study on
MCT for depression was not included in the review: Wells et al.
(2009) described MCT for four depressed patients of which three
were recovered at 6 months follow-up. Recovery in the Wells
study (2009) was defined using Frank et al.’
s (1991) criteria,
consisting of no longer having a diagnosis of depression and
a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of 8 or less. Since
the publication of the review of Normann et al. (2014), several
studies on MCT for depression have been published (Jordan et al.,
2014; Callesen et al., 2015; Dammen et al., 2015; Papageorgiou
and Wells, 2015). These studies also used Frank et al.’
s (1991)
criteria. The study by Callesen et al. (2015) described the
treatment of four depressed patients of which three of them
were recovered. The group-MCT study by Dammen et al. (2015)
reported that 91% of the patients recovered at follow-up. Another
group-MCT study (Papageorgiou and Wells, 2015) included 10
antidepressant and CBT resistant depression patients, and found
that 70% were recovered at post-treatment and follow-up. The
reported effect size reported with Hedge’
s g was 2.88 at end
treatment and 2.50 et 6 months’
follow-up. However, the small
sample size of all these studies limits the generalizability of these
results.
In the only controlled study of MCT in depression, 23
depressed patients were treated with MCT and compared with
25 patients treated with CBT (Jordan et al., 2014). Jordan et al.
(2014) found that MCT and CBT produced similar positive
results on symptom measures, but MCT produced superior
effects on improved executive control (Groves et al., 2015).
The reported effect sizes using Cohen’
s d for intention to treat
were 1.12 for MCT at end treatment. However, there were
limitations in this study including low power, greater comorbidity
in the MCT condition, and a lack of formal therapist training
in MCT.
In
summary,
current
recommended
approaches
for
depression are CBT and antidepressant medication which
produce moderate success rates and are often associated with
significant relapse or recurrence. The metacognitive approach
offers promising opportunities for addressing these limitations
of treatment by directly targeting rumination and its underlying
mechanisms that are seen as essential in the development
and maintenance of depression (Wells, 2009). The present
randomized controlled trial includes a larger sample of patients
treated with MCT, and metacognitive therapist competency
was ensured through training and supervision. We compared
MCT with a waiting list control, since treatment studies do
not take into account spontaneous remission in depression,
as demonstrated by a mean decrease of 10–
15% in depressive
symptoms for waiting list control groups (Posternak and
Miller, 2001). Furthermore, a WL condition can provide
control over the effects of repeated assessment, regression
to the mean and the expectancy of receiving treatment (e.g.,
optimism). Our prediction was that MCT would lead to greater
improvement in depressive symptoms than a waiting period of
10 weeks.

MCT for Depression
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The total sample consisted of thirty-nine participants and
included 59% women (n = 23). The majority were ethnic
Norwegians and three were Asian. The mean age was 33.7 years
with a range from 18 to 54. Average number of children was
1.2. Three participants were currently treated with SSRIs. They
were included as long as they agreed to maintain a stable
dosage throughout the trial. A total of 30 (76.9%) participants
had received earlier treatment for depression from their general
practitioner, nine (23.1%) reported having been medicated with
SSRIs for depression, 21 (53.8%) had received treatment from
psychologists/psychiatrists at psychiatric outpatient clinics, three
(7.7%) had previous inpatient treatment stays, and one had
undergone ECT treatment.
A total of 16 participants were single, 15 were married or
cohabitants, five had romantic partners, and three were divorced
or separated. In all 12 patients worked full time, eight worked part
time, seven were full time students, one was a part time student,
while 13 were unemployed or received social or welfare benefits.
With respect to education, two had completed elementary school,
17 had completed high school, five had 3 year college educations,
and 15 had a 5 year university degree. Further demographic
information on the sample is displayed in Table 1.
Most of the sample had a recurrent depression diagnosis
(79.5%) while 20.5% had a current depressive episode. The
mean age at which the first depressive episode occurred was
26.2 years (SD = 11.7). The average duration of depression
was M = 7.6 years (SD = 7.1). Comorbidity within the
sample was as follows: 16 patients had one additional axis-I
disorder (10 generalized anxiety disorder, two panic disorder, one
social phobia, one hypochondriasis, one trichotillomania, and
one eating disorder not otherwise specified), one patient also
had a second comorbid axis-I disorder (binge-eating disorder).
A total of 13 patients also had comorbid axis-II disorders (three
avoidant personality and 10 obsessive compulsive personality
disorders). Thirteen patients (33.3%) had depression as their
single diagnosis.
Procedure
This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01608399),
and it was approved by the Regional Medical Ethics Committee
in Norway (ref.nr. 2011/1138). Patients with primary depression
disorder (mild, moderate, or severe) either single episode or
recurrent depression were included (DSM-IV criteria). Further
inclusion criteria for the study were signed written informed
consent, and 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria were (a) known
somatic diseases, (b) psychosis, (c) current suicide intent, (d)
PTSD, (e) cluster A or cluster B personality disorder, (f) substance
dependence, (g) not willing to accept random allocation, (h)
patients not willing to withdraw use of benzodiazepines for
a period of 4 weeks prior to entry to the trial, and (i)
patients undergoing concurrent therapy elsewhere. A total of 105
diagnostic interviews were completed out of which 66 patients
were excluded from the study. Reasons for exclusions were: GAD
as primary diagnosis (n = 18), other primary diagnosis (n = 16),
cluster A or B personality disorder (n = 10), no psychiatric
diagnosis (n = 8), subclinical depression (n = 5), social phobia
as primary diagnosis (n = 4), somatic diseases (n = 2), PTSD
(n = 1), substance dependence (n = 1), and one patient was
excluded due to use of anti-psychotic medication.
Participants were recruited between January 2013 and January
2015. Participants were treatment-seeking individuals referred
by their GP or self-referred to a university outpatient clinic
in a major city in Norway. Information about the study and
descriptions of how to refer participants were provided in

local newspapers, as letters to GPs, on the radio and through
advertisements on social media.
After initial telephone screenings, potential participants met
with a trained assessor who provided detailed information
about the study, obtained informed consent and reviewed
inclusion and exclusion criteria and severity of depression and
other psychiatric conditions. The diagnostic interviews included
Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM IV axis I (SCID-I; First
et al., 2002), Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM IV axis
II (SCID-II, First et al., 1997), and the Hamilton Rating Scale
for Depression (HRSD-17; Hamilton, 1967). The assessment
team conducted the interviews at pre- and post-treatment, while
post-waiting list and follow-up data was based on self-report.
Agreement upon diagnosis was achieved by conferring with
two senior researchers who watched videotaped recordings of
the interviews. Assessments were completed before treatment,
after the wait period (waiting list group only), after treatment,
and at 6 months follow-up. Consenting participants who met
inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either begin MCT
immediately or after a 10-week wait period.
Sample size was calculated based on a minimum clinically
meaningful difference between treatments on BDI of 7. Accepting
a probability of Type I error of 5 per cent with 80 percent
power (Chandrashekara, 2012), 17 patients would be required in
each group. Estimating with an expected attrition rate of 30%
would indicate group sizes of 22. Given that the attrition rate
was low, inclusion was stopped at 39 patients. A randomization
schedule was generated by Excel’
s random number generator
prior to the project start. Two factors were controlled for in
the randomization; gender and recurrent depressive episodes.
Figure 1 illustrates participant flow through the study.
Measures
Structured Clinical Interviews
Structured clinical interviews were performed both at pre- and
at post-treatment with the SCID-I and SCID-II and theHRSD-
17. Diagnoses were assessed using the SCID-I and SCID-II.
The patients were re-assessed with SCID-I and SCID-II at
post-treatment using only the modules corresponding to their
pre-treatment diagnoses. This was to assess if they had the
same diagnosis after having undergone treatment. The HRSD-
17 is a structured interview that includes items related to
depressive symptoms, 0–
4 scale, where 0 correspond to the
absence of symptoms, and the score of 4 corresponds to severe
symptoms. Scores between 0 and 6 do not indicate the presence
of depression, scores between 7 and 17 indicate mild depression,
scores between 18 and 24 indicate moderate depression, and
scores over 24 indicate severe depression.
Self-Report Instruments
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1961) is a 21-
item self-report inventory used to measure level of depressive
symptoms. Each item is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 0 to 3, indicating the severity of each symptom.
The BDI has been extensively shown to be a reliable and valid
measure of severity of depressive symptoms in both clinical- and
non-clinical populations (Beck et al., 1988). Beck and colleagues
categorized the BDI total scores as follows: 0–
9 minimal, 10–
18
mild, 19–
29 moderate, and 30–
63 severe depression.
The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck and Steer, 1990) is
a 21-item self-report inventory for assessing the presence and
severity of anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a four-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3, indicating the severity of
each symptom. Beck and Steer (1990) categorized the BAI total
scores as follows: 0–
7 minimal, 8–
15 mild, 16–
25 moderate, and
26–
63 severe. For psychometric properties of the BAI, see Steer
et al. (1993).
Treatment
Patients received 10 sessions of MCT for depression following
the
published
treatment
manual
and
session
guides
for
depression (Wells, 2009). Briefly, the treatment consisted of:
case conceptualization and socialization which are undertaken
first and then followed by (1) increasing meta-awareness
by identifying thoughts that act as triggers for rumination,
learning about metacognitive control using attention training;
(2) challenging beliefs about the uncontrollability of rumination
and worry; (3) challenging beliefs about threat monitoring and
dangers of rumination and worry; (4) modification of positive
beliefs about rumination and worry; and (5) relapse prevention.
Therapists
Therapists were clinical psychologists who had all received
previous training in MCT. Treatment was supervised by
professor Adrian Wells (AW), the originator of MCT, to ensure
quality of the delivered treatment. AW watched videotaped
recordings of sessions and provided ongoing feedback. The
tapes were simultaneously translated by the bilingual therapists.
The therapists met every month for peer supervision. No
formal measure of therapists’competence, treatment integrity
or adherence was obtained. A split plot ANOVA found no
significant differences between therapists with respect to changes
in HRSD scores, F(3,34) = 0.942, p = 0.43).
Data Analyses
A mixed-model repeated ANOVA was used to compare the MCT
group with the waiting list control. Partial eta squared statistics
and Cohen’
s d effect sizes (using pooled standard deviations)
were used to estimate the treatment effects and between group
differences. A repeated measures ANOVA and t-tests was also
used to estimate the treatment effects for the total combined
sample (those who received immediate and delayed treatment),
entering BDI and BAI scores from pre-treatment, post-treatment,
and 6 months follow-up. Controlled effect sizes were calculated in
the following way: post treatment for immediate MCT minus post
waiting list divided by the pooled standard deviation. To evaluate
clinically significant outcomes, Jacobson criteria (Jacobson et al.,
1999) was used, with a cut-off point (14) and reliable change index
(8.46, which was rounded up to 9 in the present study) obtained
for the BDI (Seggar et al., 2002). Both ITT and completer analyses
are reported on outcome measures and clinically significant
change analyses, thus allowing for comparison with existing
studies as recommended (Hiller et al., 2012).

MCT for Depression
FIGURE 1 | Flow chart.
For the ITT analysis we used last observation carried forward
to replace missing values. The two dropouts from the waiting list
condition were missing BDI and BAI scores at post-treatment
and follow-up. They were assigned their pre-treatment scores at
post-treatment and follow-up. There was very little missing data
on individual BDI items (0.4%) and BAI items (0.8%). In these
cases missing items were replaced using mean item scores on the
remaining items.
All participants allocated to receive MCT immediately after
randomization completed treatment. Two participants allocated
to waiting list dropped out during the waiting period (one moved
and one started treatment at a private practice psychologist)
and did not provide data after pre-treatment. These two were
included in the intent to treat analyses and their post-treatment
results were replaced using last observation carried forward. Of
the patients initially allocated to waitlist and then going on to

delayed treatment, two of them did not go on to complete all
10 treatment sessions. These two patients did not meet with the
assessment team for a post-treatment and follow-up interview,
however self-report data was available from their latest treatment
sessions and used as post-treatment results. Thus, a total of 17
patients completed MCT after first being allocated to waiting list
resulting in a total of 35 post-treatment interviews. All except one
of these 35 also completed self-report questionnaires at 6 month
follow-up.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents an overview of demographic and diagnostic
information for the two groups and the total sample. The
two groups were similar on all variables with no statistically
significant differences between them at pre-treatment. With
respect to diagnoses there were a total of 57 axis–
I diagnoses
given at pre-treatment for all the participants. This number
was reduced to 8 axis-I at post-treatment. Four patients still
had a diagnosis of depression (3 with mild recurrent depression
and 1 with moderate depressive episode). With respect to
comorbid conditions, 3 patients still suffered from GAD, one
from social phobia and one from trichotillomania. As for axis-
II comorbidity, there were 13 diagnoses given at pre-treatment
and 8 at post-treatment, suggesting that 40% also recovered from
their personality disorder as assessed by SCID-II.
Primary Outcomes
BDI
To assess the comparative outcomes a mixed model ANOVA was
run on the BDI measured at pre and post treatment. Table 2
shows the main effect of time F(1,37) = 140.59, p < 0.001 and the
group by time interaction, which was significant F(1,37) = 80.05,
p < 0.001. Inspection of the group means indicated that the MCT
group showed greater improvement in BDI scores than the wait
list group from pre to post. The within subject contrasts on a
group-wise basis confirmed that both the MCT and the wait list
group improved from pre to post intervention. The within group
effect sizes (d) were; MCT = 3.50, WL = 0.49, with a controlled
effect size of d = 2.51.
HRSD
In the wait list group the HRSD was only assessed prior to
waiting and after the provision of delayed treatment. Therefore,
comparison between the waitlist group and MCT is not possible.
We ran a repeated measures t-test for the whole sample to assess
overall change in HRSD associated with treatment (ITT analysis,
see Table 3). For the entire combined sample the ITT showed
larger effect size of d = 2.95.
Secondary Outcomes
BAI
A mixed model ANOVA was run to assess the comparative
outcomes on the BAI measured at pre and post-treatment.
Table 2 presents the main effects of time F(1,37) = 45.06,
p < 0.001 and the significant group by time interaction
F(1,37) = 38.57, p < 0.001. The group means indicated that the
MCT group showed greater improvement in the BAI scores than
the wait list group from pre to post. The within subject contrasts
on a group-wise basis confirmed that both the MCT and the wait
list group improved from pre to post intervention. The within
group effect size (d) were; MCT = 2.09, WL = 0.09, with a
controlled effect size of d = 1.92.
Follow-Up Results
To assess the stability of the treatment effects repeated measures
t-tests for BDI and BAI were used to determine any significant
changes from post treatment to 6 months follow-up assessments.
There were no significant changes within this time period
for any of the measures (see Table 3). Very large effect
sizes were observed on the HRSD-17, BDI and BAI from
pre to post treatment. The large effect sizes were somewhat
lower from pre to 6 months follow-up with BDI of 2.11
and BAI of 1.44 for the intention to treat sample (combined
groups).
Combined Sample
To provide more accurate estimates of effects for the purposes
of future sample size estimates the analyses on the combined
sample of patients from pre to post treatment on HRSD-
17 and pre, post, and follow-up on BDI and BAI were

high effect sizes ranging from 1.98 to 3.13 for the intention
to treat sample and from 2.34 to 4.81 for the treatment
completers.
Clinically Significant Change Analyses
Table 4 presents an overview of clinical significant change for
patients that did not change, improved, or were classified as
recovered after treatment. None deteriorated at post treatment
or follow-up. For the HRSD-17, the immediate MCT intention
to treat effects showed 75% were classified as recovered, while
for the entire group with intention to treat more than 82.4%
were classified as recovered. According to the criterion set by
Jacobson and colleagues (1999), the BDI results were similar
and indicated that approximately 80% of the MCT intention
to treat sample was recovered at post-treatment and 75% at
6 months follow-up. For the entire group in the intention to
treat condition over 79.5% were recovered at post treatment
and over 69.2% at 6 months follow-up. In the waiting list
condition 2.6% recovered, and 2,6 % were improved during
the 10 weeks of waiting. No patients deteriorated following
treatment. No harm or unintended effects were reported or
observed. There were no significant differences for moderate
and severe recurrent depression, neither from pre to post
χ2(1) = 0.13, p = 0.72 nor from pre to follow-up χ2(1) = 0.03,
p = 0.86 on BDI. There were too few participants with
episodes or mild recurrent depression to include these in the
analyses.
Return to Work Outcomes
At post-treatment 30.6% had started working or studying, 58.3%
were still in work/studies, and 11.1% were still unemployed
or on disability benefits. Unemployment or disability benefits
were reduced by 22.2% from pre to post-treatment. Three of
the patients were unaccounted for with respect to employment
status.

MCT for Depression
DISCUSSION
The results of this trial of MCT for depression are encouraging
with large and statistically significant reductions both for
depressive and anxious symptoms following 10 sessions of
treatment. These improvements were sustained at 6 months
follow-up. The clinical significance analyses showed that 70–
80% of the total sample of patients achieved recovery which
is consistent with previous uncontrolled studies on MCT.
These numbers suggest that the majority of patients benefitted
from MCT and none of the patients reported a worsening
of symptoms. The comparison of the MCT group with the
control group allows us to partial out the effects of time
and factors such as expectancy from ‘
true’treatment related
effects. The effect size for the control group was moderate
suggesting that these effects are by no means insubstantial.
However, MCT produced a much greater effect supporting
attribution of the outcome to aspects of the intervention
itself.
Several meta-analyses have examined the effect of CBT for
adult depression. A meta-analysis containing 78 studies reported
that the comparison between CBT and waiting-list had an effect
size of 0.82 on the BDI (Gloaguen et al., 1998). An updated
meta-analysis by Cuijpers et al. (2013) shows similar effect sizes.
In their review 115 studies met the criteria for inclusion, and
the mean effect size related to CBT vs. control groups was
Hedges g = 0.83. The analysis suggests the effect-size to be
overestimated caused by publication bias and poor quality of
some studies included in the meta-analysis. The present study
comparing MCT and waiting-list found an effect size of 2.53
on the BDI. There are large differences between the effect
sizes previously reported for CBT and presently reported for
MCT, whilst these differences suggest advantages for MCT they
may be biased by the small number of studies on MCT and
allegiance effects. These findings emphasize the need for future
studies with a direct comparison of CBT with MCT in larger
studies.
Regarding personality disorders, the study found that five
patients out of 13 did not meet criteria for personality disorder
at post-treatment. Other studies on metacognitive therapy have
also shown promising results despite the presence of personality
disorders (Wells et al., 2012; Dammen et al., 2015; Hjemdal
et al., 2016), but also that characterological symptoms could
change following MCT. In fact, Dammen et al. (2015) reported
that all five patients with personality disorders no longer met
criteria at post-treatment. The loss of such diagnoses following
MCT for depression might imply that the features were a
manifestation of their cognitive attentional syndrome and that
modifying this system and its underlying metacognitions could
involve changes in self-perceptions and habits. However, these
results also mirror findings showing that change in depression
could in general co-occur with change in personality (e.g.,
Fava et al., 2002). This could also reflect that personality
disorder diagnoses might be confounded by affective states
of the patients. The prominent symptoms in avoidant- and
obsessive compulsive personality disorders are avoidance, low
self-esteem, perfectionism, and inflexibility. Future research
should investigate whether these changes in personality are
maintained at long-term follow-up or merely a consequence of
changes in depressive symptoms. Some consideration should
be given to the representativeness of the current sample Only
one in four had used or were using anti-depressive medication
in the study. This is, however, comparable to other Norwegian
studies of psychotherapy interventions for depression (Dalgard,
2006; Høifødt et al., 2013; Dammen et al., 2015). Furthermore,
half of the sample had been in previous psychiatric outpatient
treatment. Taken together these observations suggest that the
sample could be representative of a depressed treatment-seeking
patient group.
A potential limitation concerns the fact that no assessment of
treatment adherence and therapist competence were performed.
Whilst adherence to treatment was monitored throughout
supervision there was no formal assessment of adherence to the
treatment manual. There were no differences between therapists
with respect to patient changes in depressive symptoms, which
may suggest that therapist differences did not affect the results
significantly. Questions might be raised related to the design
using a waiting list as a control condition. Although Furukawa
et al. (2014) found that waiting list could have a nocebo effect,
the knowledge of the course of untreated depression can serve as
a benchmark for assessing the true benefits of active treatment.
In the short-term, depressive symptomatology can be expected
to decrease by about 10–
15% on average without treatment
(Posternak and Miller, 2001). The sample size may imply some
limitations regarding internal and external validity of the study.
Another potential limitation concerns the fact that missing data
was handled using last observation carried forward. This can
be problematic when it reduces effects such as regression to
the mean which would become a problem if there was greater
missing data in one condition compared with the other. In the
present study, the extent of data missing was small and therefore
it is likely to be a conservative method of replacing missing
values.
Further, the inter-rater reliability for the HRSD-17 is lacking.
Moreover, the assessors were not blind to involvement in
treatment or the hypothesis of the study, but they were
however blind to group assignment at pre-treatment. Future
studies should investigate long term efficacy of MCT for
depression and the relationship between changes in rumination
and metacognitive beliefs and symptoms. Finally, randomized
controlled trials with active treatment comparisons are essential
before we can be more confident of the effects of this
treatment.
CONCLUSION
Metacognitive therapy was associated with large improvements in
depressive symptoms. Comorbid disorders and symptoms were
also improved. Treatment gains were large and sustained for
6 months follow-up. There were no significant differences in
treatment effect for patients with moderate- or severe recurrent
depression. These results support MCT as a potentially effective
treatment for depression that could lead to improved outcomes.
