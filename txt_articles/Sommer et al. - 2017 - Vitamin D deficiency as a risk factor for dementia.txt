Abstract
Background: Sunlight exposure and high vitamin D status have been hypothesised to reduce the risk of
developing dementia. The objective of our research was to determine whether lack of sunlight and
hypovitaminosis D over time are associated with dementia.
Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science,
ICONDA, and reference lists of pertinent review articles from 1990 to October 2015. We conducted random effects
meta-analyses of published and unpublished data to evaluate the influence of sunlight exposure or vitamin D as a
surrogate marker on dementia risk.
Results: We could not identify a single study investigating the association between sunlight exposure and
dementia risk. Six cohort studies provided data on the effect of serum vitamin D concentration on dementia risk.
A meta-analysis of five studies showed a higher risk for persons with serious vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L or
7–28 nmol/L) compared to persons with sufficient vitamin D supply (≥50 nmol/L or 54–159 nmol/L) (point estimate
1.54; 95% CI 1.19–1.99, I2 = 20%). The strength of evidence that serious vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of
developing dementia, however, is very low due to the observational nature of included studies and their lack of
adjustment for residual or important confounders (e.g. ApoE ε4 genotype), as well as the indirect relationship
between Vitamin D concentrations as a surrogate for sunlight exposure and dementia risk.
Conclusions: The results of this systematic review show that low vitamin D levels might contribute to the
development of dementia. Further research examining the direct and indirect relationship between sunlight
exposure and dementia risk is needed. Such research should involve large-scale cohort studies with homogeneous
and repeated assessment of vitamin D concentrations or sunlight exposure and dementia outcomes.

Background
With life expectancy on the rise throughout the world
and almost 900 million people 60 years old or over [1],
the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as de-
mentia is increasing. Dementia is characterized by mul-
tiple
cognitive
deficits
that
include
impairment
in
memory [2] and encompasses four subtypes (Alzheimer’s
disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and
frontotemporal dementia), which are each associated
with specific neurological features [3]. In 2015, 46.8 mil-
lion people worldwide were living with dementia. This
number is predicted to double every 20 years, until at
least 2050 [1], even though evidence from European
countries shows stable age-specific prevalence and inci-
dence rates over time [4]. An increase in dementia
seems unavoidable due to the fact that people live lon-
ger. Based on data from the Framingham study, the life-
time risk of dementia at age 65 is 22% for women and
14% for men [5]. Since the causes of dementia remain
unknown and no cure for the disease has been found

 [6], researchers are intensely searching for preventive in-
terventions to delay the onset of dementia. Several risk
factors have been identified but the evidence for these is
variable. Biological factors possibly associated with de-
mentia risk include old age, female sex, and Apolipopro-
tein E (ApoE) ε4 genotype. Social factors that may
contribute to risk include low education and low socio-
economic status. Lifestyle characteristics such as alcohol
abuse, smoking, and reduced physical activity could also
play a role. Medical risk factors such as high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, overweight, diabetes, and cardio-
vascular diseases are also believed to be contributing
factors [7].
In recent years, evidence has linked a lack of vitamin
D not only to its known effects on calcium and bone
metabolism, but also to neurocognitive decline [8].
About 90% of vitamin D is produced in the epidermis
from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) as a reaction to
sunlight (solar ultraviolet B radiation; 290–315 nm) [9].
Factors that limit the cutaneous production of vitamin
D3 include higher latitude, covering of skin, lack of out-
door activities, sunscreen use, old age, female sex, and
darker skin pigmentation [10]. In an assessment derived
from published studies, Holick [9] has estimated that
due mainly to lack of sunlight exposure, approximately
one billion people worldwide have inadequate vitamin D
levels
(as
defined
by
a
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
or
25(OH)D, the primary circulating form of vitamin D in
the serum, level of <75 nmol/L). In addition to sunlight,
another important source of vitamin D is nutrition. Per-
sons residing in regions where sunlight is reduced like in
northern Europe need to include foods rich in vitamin D
such as fatty fish or vitamin D fortified foods in their di-
ets [10].
Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses from
cross-sectional analyses suggest that low serum vitamin
D concentrations may be associated with Alzheimer’s
disease and other forms of dementia and cognitive im-
pairment [11, 12]. However, other systematic reviews
(for example, Barnard and Colon-Emeric [13]) could not
find an association between cognitive function (mea-
sured with the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE])
and 25(OH)D concentration. Results of systematic re-
views, however, can vary due to differences in search
strategies, inclusion criteria, statistical analysis tech-
niques, and adjustment of confounding factors. Within
the spectrum of observational studies, longitudinal stud-
ies may be more valid than other observational study de-
signs because they commonly take confounding factors
into account and also give insight into the temporal
order of cause and effect. The objective of our study,
therefore, was to focus on longitudinal studies to sys-
tematically and objectively evaluate the influence of sun-
light exposure or vitamin D on dementia risk.
Methods
This systematic review was prospectively registered in
PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Sys-
tematic Reviews) [14] [CRD42014010199]. Throughout
this manuscript, we followed the PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses)
statement
[15]

systematic
review.
Literature search
We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Library,
EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and ICONDA from
January 1990 to October 2015 to identify relevant publica-
tions. We further searched for grey literature using the
PsycInfo database for dissertations and theses, the SCO-
PUS database for conference proceedings, and the Open
Grey database. We limited searches to human populations
and English or German language. An experienced infor-
mation specialist developed an appropriate search strategy
using a combination of Mesh (Medical subject headings)
terms and free-text key words (dementia, sunlight or vita-
min D) and ran the searches. The detailed search strategy
is presented online in the Additional file 1. Additionally,
we complemented electronic searches by checking refer-
ence lists from pertinent studies and reviews and contact-
ing experts for their suggestions of relevant articles. We
imported all citations into a reference managing database
(Endnote X · 6 · 0 · 1) and deleted duplicate publications.
Inclusion criteria
We included randomised and non-randomised con-
trolled trials, prospective cohort studies, nested case-
control studies and systematic reviews on longitudinal
studies that investigated the effect of sunlight exposure
or vitamin D serum concentrations (as surrogate param-
eter for sunlight) on prevalence or incidence of dementia
including Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, fronto-
temporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia (diagnosis
based on validated measurement scales) among adults.
We did not consider any studies on mild cognitive im-
pairments or any intervention studies on vitamin D sup-
plementation and dementia risk for inclusion. The
scientific expert panel for this review deemed prevalence
or incidence of dementia as critical outcomes for
decision-making.
Study selection
Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and
full-texts against pre-specified criteria. They resolved
discrepancies about inclusion or exclusion by consensus
or by involving a third reviewer. Studies that were only
published as abstract were excluded.

 Data extraction
We designed, pilot-tested, and used standardised data ex-
traction forms to gather pertinent information from each
study. Two trained reviewers extracted data relating to: a)
study information (author, publication year, funding, loca-
tion/setting); b) observation period; c) study design; d)
sample size; e) outcome measurement; f) description of
study population including individual characteristics such
as age, gender, and type of dementia; and g) results of the
study. If articles did not provide enough information to
extract relevant data, authors were contacted in an at-
tempt to acquire additional information. A second re-
viewer checked all abstracted data for completeness and
accuracy.
Study quality
We evaluated the methodological quality (risk of bias) of
studies using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale (NOS) for observational studies [16]. Two independ-
ent reviewers assessed the risk of bias for each study. Dis-
agreements between the two reviewers were resolved by
discussion and consensus or by consulting a third member
of the team. The result was an overall risk-of-bias rating
of each study classed as low, unclear, or high risk of bias.
Data synthesis
We performed a random effect meta-analysis using the
generic inverse variance model to synthesise effect esti-
mates of studies that were similar with respect to expos-
ure classification. In case of incongruous exposure
categories, we contacted study authors asking to reana-
lyse the data using ≥50 nmol/L [no deficiency or suffi-
cient supply], ≥25 to <50 nmol/L [insufficiency], and
<25 nmol/L [serious deficiency] serum vitamin D con-
centrations for classification. In absence of an agreed
definition, these cut-offs are commonly used by experts
and reflect vitamin D recommendations by several orga-
nisations. They were set with regard to prevention of
rickets and/or symptomatic osteomalacia (<25 nmol/L)
and guarantee of sufficient supply of vitamin D for al-
most the whole population (97.5%) (≥50 nmol/L) [8]. A
separate analysis of the data using fixed effect meta-
analysis yielded similar results. We tested for heterogen-
eity with Cochrane’s Q test and quantified its magnitude
using I2. The small number of studies identified pre-
cluded a reliable visual assessment of publication bias.
We conducted all statistical analyses using Comprehen-
sive Meta-Analysis version 3. The results of studies not
suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis are reported
narratively.
Ratings of quality of evidence
We graded the quality of the available evidence in a four-
part hierarchy according to the GRADE scheme (Grading
of
Recommendations
Assessment,
Development
and
Evaluation) [17]. GRADE assesses the quality of evidence
using four grades: high, moderate, low, and very low [18].
Observational studies always start with a rating of low
quality of evidence because of the risk of residual con-
founding but can be upgraded for large treatment effects,
dose effect gradients, or if apparent confounding would
reduce the observed effect [19]. Criteria for downgrading
the quality of evidence are risk of bias [20], imprecision
[21], inconsistency [22], indirectness [23], and publication
bias [24]. We dually evaluated the overall quality of evi-
dence for each outcome viewed as “critical” for decision-
making by the scientific expert panel. We reconciled all
disagreements in grades through consensus discussion.
Results
Study characteristics
We identified a total of 1870 citations from searches and
reviews of reference lists after removal of duplicates and
assessed 112 full-text reviews for eligibility as part of a
larger research report. Overall, 17 articles met the inclu-
sion criteria for the larger research report, of which we
included six for our research question (see Fig. 1).
Because we could not identify any direct evidence on
exposure to sunlight and risk of developing dementia, we
focused our review on indirect evidence from studies
using vitamin D status as a surrogate parameter. The six
studies [25–30] that fulfilled the criteria of indirect evi-
dence were cohort studies providing data on 18,974
adults. There was one study that we rated as high risk of
bias [25], all others received an unclear risk-of-bias rating
[26–30]. Reasons for the high risk of bias-rating were the
unjustified selection of study participants from one out of
five possible settings, inadequate assessment of possible
confounders, as well as a dropout rate of 56%.
The characteristics of all included studies [25–30]
are displayed in Table 1. Studies showed differences
in terms of study population, sample size, partici-
pants’ age, follow-up, vitamin D exposure classifica-
tion, methods for serum vitamin D measurement,
adjustment
of
potential
confounding
factors,
and
timing and criteria used to diagnose dementia. Diag-
nosis of dementia was made according to the Inter-
national
Statistical
Classification
of
Diseases
and
Related Health Problems (ICD 8, 9 or 10) [26–30],
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders
(DSM-IV or IV-TR),
in
combination
with
other criteria [26–30] or the criteria of the National
Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disor-
ders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Re-
lated Disorders Association alone [29]. It was either
performed by experts [26–30] or taken from hospital
discharge
records and
patient or death registries
[26–30]. All studies were prospective cohort studies,

 apart from Knekt et al.’s [28], which was a retro-
spective investigation. Half of the studies received
public research funding [25, 28, 30] and half of them
a mix of public and private research funding [26, 27,
29]. They were conducted in the United States [29,
30], Finland [28], Denmark [26], Switzerland [27],
and France [25].
Incidence of dementia
We conducted a meta-analysis (random effects model)
to derive a pooled estimate for dementia risk. Despite
incongruent use of vitamin D exposure categories
across publications but with the help of some study
authors [27, 30] who provided unpublished data, we
were able to combine data from a total of 18,933 per-
sons included in five studies [26–30] (Table 2). We did
not include the study of Annweiler et al. [25] in the
meta-analysis as it used different vitamin D cut-offs to
make comparisons between subjects (<25 nmol/L vs
≥25 nmol/L).
The meta-analysis across all five studies [26–30]
demonstrated a statistically significantly higher de-
mentia risk in persons with serious vitamin D defi-
ciency (<25 nmol/L or 7–28 nmol/L) than in persons
with sufficient vitamin D supply (≥50 nmol/L or 54–
159 nmol/L) (Point estimate = 1.54; 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.19 to 1.99, see Fig. 2). Translated into
absolute numbers, 28 (at least 10 but up to 50 more)
out of 1000 people with serious vitamin D deficiency
would develop dementia compared with 1000 people
with sufficient D levels over 18.03 years. Heterogeneity
of the meta-analysis was low (I2 = 20%) and was exam-
ined using sensitivity analyses. We examined factors
such as use of different cut-off points to categorise

sonal vitamin D change in the analysis, use of demen-
tia incidence leading to hospitalisation as endpoint,
and vitamin D assessment by liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry on the robustness of the
results of the meta-analysis. The analyses showed only
minor variations and thus confirmed the robustness of
the results (see Additional file 2: Figures S1–S5).
The study of Annweiler et al. [25] comprised only 40 par-
ticipants. Findings, however, were consistent with those of
our meta-analysis. Results showed a statistically significant
association
between
vitamin
D
deficiency
and
non-
Alzheimer’s dementia (adjusted OR = 19.57; 95% CI 1.11 to
343.69). The association between vitamin D and Alzhei-
mer’s disease (unadjusted OR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.15;
adjusted OR not reported) was not statistically significant.
The strength of evidence that vitamin D increases the
risk of developing dementia is very low (Table 3). This is
because the evidence exclusively relies on observational
studies which did not equally consider all important
confounders (e.g. ApoE ε4 genotype) and which assessed
the indirect relationship between vitamin D as surrogate
for sunlight exposure and dementia risk.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that
evaluated the influence of vitamin D serum concentrations
on dementia risk using longitudinal studies. Despite a com-
prehensive search of the literature we were not able to iden-
tify any study that addressed the direct relationship
between sunlight exposure and dementia risk. The meta-
analysis of five out of six included studies with data from a
total of 18,639 participants showed that persons with ser-
ious vitamin D deficiency have a statistically significant
higher relative risk of 1.54 to develop dementia than per-
sons with sufficient vitamin D supply. Our findings seem to
suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of de-
mentia. However, the quality of the evidence is very low be-
cause of the observational nature of included studies, the
fact that not all studies considered important confounders
equally, and the use of vitamin D as surrogate for sunlight
exposure. As a consequence, a causal effect of vitamin D
deficiency on dementia cannot be assumed with certainty.
Research has still not identified the physiological mecha-
nisms underlying the potential effect of vitamin D defi-
ciency on dementia risk but several candidate mechanisms
have been identified. Evidence from animal studies [31]

 suggests that vitamin D deficiency may impair neuro-
physiological functioning causing anatomical and behav-
ioural adverse effects. In a landmark publication, Eyles et al.
[32] provide evidence that the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
receptor (VDR) is wide-spread in the human brain. Map-
ping their distribution in the brain area, they found the
strongest immunohistochemical presence of both the re-
ceptor and the connected enzyme (1alpha-OHase) in the
hypothalamus and in large neurons of the substantia nigra.
Based on the observed distribution of the VDR and 1alpha-
OHase, they concluded that vitamin D may act in a manner
similar to neurosteroids [32]. The neurosteroid actions of
vitamin D encompasses regulation of calcium homeostasis,
β-amyloid deposition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties, and potential protection against neurodegenera-
tive processes associated with Alzheimer’s disease and cog-
nition [33].
Two previous systematic reviews have investigated the as-
sociation between vitamin D intake and dementia risk [11,
12], focussing on Alzheimer’s disease as the most common
subtype of dementia [34]. Because at the time of their litera-
ture searches large cohort studies were not published yet,
they based their conclusions on cross-sectional analyses
from case-control studies mainly. Both systematic reviews
found lower serum vitamin D concentration in cases with
Alzheimer’s diseases compared to their control group.
Although results seem to suggest an association be-
tween serious vitamin D deficiency and an increased
risk of dementia, no definitive conclusions can be
drawn regarding whether or not lack of sunlight
exposure increases a person’s risk of developing de-
mentia. Vitamin D only acts as surrogate parameter
for sunlight exposure and our comprehensive searches
did not yield any studies on sunlight exposure and de-
mentia risk. Therefore, we had to draw on studies
examining the relationship between vitamin D and de-
mentia risk.
Generally, cohort studies can provide data for more
definitive conclusions than case-control studies but due
to the observational nature of the study designs, no def-
inite conclusion on causality can be drawn in this case.
The relationship between lack of vitamin D and the risk
of dementia can still be attributed to unknown or re-
sidual confounding even though potential confounders
have been comprehensively controlled for in most of the
analyses. The studies included in this systematic review
adjusted extensively for potential confounders. Most of
them accounted for physiological (age, gender, BMI), so-
cioeconomic (e.g. education level), and lifestyle factors
(smoking, physical activity) as well as comorbidities (dia-
betes, hypertension). Presence of the ApoE ε4 genotype
was only considered by Graf et al. [27].
Another methodological shortcoming compromising
the validity of the data is the use of single serum
25(OH)D measurements taken at baseline to represent
long-term exposure in all studies [25–30]. As has been
demonstrated by several studies, serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations vary over time within individuals [35, 36],
and levels fluctuate seasonally throughout the year due
to variances in sunlight exposure [37, 38]. The latter was
accounted for in analyses by four studies [26, 28–30]
(see Additional file 2: Figure S2).
Other
causes
of
heterogeneity
that
have
been
highlighted in previous systematic reviews [11, 12] in-
clude age, genetic factors, and method for determin-
ing
serum
vitamin
D
concentrations.
Among
the
included studies, Graf et al.’s [27] was the only one
that utilised a cohort of elderly hospitalised patients,
partly suffering from mild cognitive impairment at
baseline, and which assessed presence of the ApoE ε4
genotype. However, the effect of its removal on the
results of the meta-analysis was negligibly small (see
Additional file 2: Figure S3).
Likewise, intra- and inter-rater reliability is reported to
differ between methods for determining serum vitamin
D concentrations [11, 12]. There is still an ongoing de-
bate regarding the method of choice but a recent com-
parison between liquid chromatography– tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods and immunoassays
showed variable performance of immunoassays apart
from the radioimmunoassay that achieved a performance
similar to LC-MS/MS [39]. This could explain why sen-
sitivity analyses contrasting immunoassays and LC-MS/
MS methods did not markedly alter the results (see
Additional file 2: Figure S4). The systematic review by
Balion et al. [11] found significantly greater difference in
vitamin D concentrations between Alzheimer’s disease
and control groups in studies using competitive protein
binding assay (CBPA) than in studies using radio-
immunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), thereby demonstrating variability in im-
munoassay methods.
We further expected to see differences in dementia inci-
dence and hospitalisation due to dementia as endpoints.
Both studies [28, 30] using dementia hospitalisation as
endpoints emphasised that cases with dementia events
leading to hospitalisation were most likely to be more se-
vere and less frequent than those with dementia incidence
identified by experts or registries. However, our sensitivity
analysis did not show great differences when removing the
studies that used dementia hospitalisation as endpoint
(see Additional file 2: Figure S5).
Strength and limitations of the review
The strength of our review is that we objectively and
systematically investigated the association between vita-
min D as surrogate for sunlight exposure and dementia
risk. We searched multiple scientific databases, hand-
Sommer et al. BMC Geriatrics  (2017) 17:16 
Page 11 of 13
 searched reference lists and contacted authors to receive
data which classified vitamin D according to the cut-off
values we required for pooling the data. Notwithstand-
ing, some potential limitations of the review process
exist. Despite intensive searches, relevant publications
may have been missed. Exclusion of publications written
in languages other than English or German could have
introduced bias. Although some studies included multi-
ethnic populations [29] or explicitly compared white to
black populations [30], the majority of participants in
the included studies were white, thereby limiting the ap-
plicability of our findings to other ethnic groups. Finally,
the strength of our conclusion is limited by the very low
quality of evidence available for our research question of
interest. The identified articles did not include a study
that assessed the direct relationship between sunlight ex-
posure and dementia risk.
Conclusions
The findings of this systematic review are consistent
with the hypothesis that low vitamin D levels might con-
tribute to the development of dementia. However, the
strength of this conclusion is very low due to several
methodological issues such as the possibility of residual
confounding, the lack of repeated vitamin D measure-
ments, and the indirectness of the association between
sunlight exposure and dementia risk by using vitamin D
as surrogate. Further studies examining the indirect and
direct relationship between sunlight exposure and de-
mentia risk are needed. Such research should involve
large-scale cohort studies with homogeneous groups and
repeated assessments of vitamin D concentrations or
sunlight exposure in relation to dementia.
