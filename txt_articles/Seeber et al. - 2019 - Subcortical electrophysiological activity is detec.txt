Subcortical neuronal activity is highly relevant for mediating communication in large-scale
brain networks. While electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings provide appropriate tem-
poral resolution and coverage to study whole brain dynamics, the feasibility to detect sub-
cortical signals is a matter of debate. Here, we investigate if scalp EEG can detect and
correctly localize signals recorded with intracranial electrodes placed in the centromedial
thalamus, and in the nucleus accumbens. Externalization of deep brain stimulation (DBS)
electrodes, placed in these regions, provides the unique opportunity to record subcortical
activity simultaneously with high-density (256 channel) scalp EEG. In three patients during
rest with eyes closed, we found significant correlation between alpha envelopes derived from
intracranial and EEG source reconstructed signals. Highest correlation was found for source
signals in close proximity to the actual recording sites, given by the DBS electrode locations.
Therefore, we present direct evidence that scalp EEG indeed can sense subcortical signals.

igh-density electroencephalographic (EEG) and magne-
toencephalography (MEG) systems provide us with a
powerful tool to study neuronal brain dynamics with high
temporal and good spatial resolution1,2. By applying source
analysis methods to scalp recordings, neuronal activities in spe-
cific brain areas can be reconstructed with milliseconds resolution
enabling real-time imaging of the temporal dynamics of whole-
brain neuronal networks3,4.
The accuracy and precision of the localization of neuronal
activity using non-invasive methods is still a matter of debate.
One of the gold-standards in evaluating source localization pre-
cision are intracranial recordings in patients in whom subcortical
or intracranial electrodes are implanted for clinical purposes.
Most frequently, that is the case in pharmacoresistant epileptic
patients where intracranial recordings are used to determine the
localization of the epileptic focus in the framework of pre-surgical
evaluation. Such recordings give the unique possibility to com-
pare the estimated location of the epileptic focus (in most cases
the irritative zone) by scalp EEG source localization with the
location of the intracranial electrodes recording the same activity
with high spatial precision. While recordings are usually not
performed simultaneously, the fact that the epileptic activity is
supposed to be generated in a unique area allows comparison of
recordings done at different time points. Such studies showed that
the precision of the epileptic focus localization with high-density
scalp EEG is on average ±15 mm5. Studies using the resected zone
after successful epilepsy surgery as ground truth for localization
showed that high-density EEG source imaging (ESI) correctly
identified this zone with around 85% accuracy6. Other studies
comparing EEG or MEG source localization with intracranial
evoked potentials, electrocortical stimulation or functional mag-
netic resonance imaging (fMRI) also demonstrated impressive
source localization precision using these non-invasive techni-
ques7–9.
The pertinent question, however, is whether activity in deeper
structures of the brain can be sensed with scalp EEG or MEG
measures. While it is generally believed that activity of deep brain
structures is not visible from scalp recordings, several EEG and
MEG studies have been published that claim to be able to
determine activities in subcortical structures10–12. However,
direct proof or disproof of this claim has not been provided yet.
In this work, we aim to investigate this question by performing
simultaneous recordings from electrodes placed in subcortical
regions
and
high-density
(256
channel)
scalp
electrodes.
Recordings were performed in Gilles de Tourette Syndrome
(GTS) and in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients
undergoing electrode implantation in the thalamus and the
nucleus accumbens, respectively, in the framework of deep brain
stimulation (DBS) therapy. These recordings provide the unique
opportunity to compare the direct local field potential recordings
from these deep structures with the estimated activity of virtual
electrodes in these brain areas, reconstructed from scalp EEG. In
this respect, we report significant correlation between intracranial
recorded and source estimated signals at solution points in
proximity to the actual electrode position. Therefore, we provide
direct evidence that scalp EEG indeed detects subcortical neu-
ronal activity which can be reconstructed and located using
source imaging techniques.
Results
Alpha oscillations are present in intracranial and scalp
recordings. Two patients suffering from GTS and two patients
suffering from OCD were recorded from subcortical electrodes
stereotactically targeted bilaterally in the centromedial thalamus
(GTS) or in the nucleus accumbens (OCD), respectively, for deep
brain stimulation. Concerning the thalamus implantation, the
planning is as such that the tip of the electrode is located at the
anteromedial border of the centromedian nucleus, with the larger
part of the lead being located within the Ventro-oralis internus.
Concerning the nucleus accumbens implantation, the electrode is
implanted at the transition of the nucleus accumbens and the
internal capsule. During two or 3 days post-implantation sub-
cortical electrodes remained externalized which provided us the
opportunity for simultaneous recordings with high-density EEG
during patients being at rest for 5 min with eyes closed. Intra-
cranial electrodes were recorded in reference to the right mastoid
scalp electrode and were offline recalculated to bipolar recordings.
High-density scalp EEG was recorded in reference to the vertex
electrode and was offline recalculated to the average reference.
We reconstructed EEG source dynamics using distributed
source modeling1,3,4,13 based on realistic head models14,15 derived
from individual MRI scans. To compare EEG source imaging
results with the actual DBS electrode positions, identified from
post-op computer tomography (CT), we spatially aligned imaging
data from these different modalities (Fig. 1a, Supplementary
Figure 1).
In all recording sessions for every participant, EEG scalp
recordings showed prevalent alpha activities in the frequency
range of 8–10 Hz. We found identical alpha frequencies in
intracranial recordings as for scalp EEG in participants that
showed a well-pronounced spectral peak (Fig. 1b, c, Supplemen-
tary Figure 2), corresponding to the well-known observation of
alpha oscillations recorded in thalamic nuclei at the same time as
in the cortex16,17. In one participant, no alpha peak was visible at
intracranial sites. This subject was excluded from further analysis,
since a clear spectral peak is a prerequisite for investigating the
detectability of neural oscillations18.
Subcortical activities can be reconstructed from scalp EEG.
Time series of alpha envelopes derived from intracranial elec-
trodes were subsequently correlated with equivalent signals
derived from (scalp) EEG source reconstruction at virtual points
covering the whole brain’s grey matter of each subject. Visual
comparison of intracranial with scalp EEG alpha envelopes
(Fig. 1c) illustrated some similarities between intracranial and
scalp recordings. More quantitatively, alpha envelopes derived
from intracranial electrodes are significantly (p ≤ 0.01 corrected,
permutation test) correlated with EEG source reconstructed sig-
nals, located to subcortical regions in close proximity to the actual
electrode sites in the nucleus accumbens (OCD) and the cen-
tromedial thalamus (GTS) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 3–5).
Due to the limited resolution of EEG source imaging, the spatial
extent ranges beyond the exact anatomical target regions. These
correlation values were maximal for time lags around zero
between actual and reconstructed alpha envelopes and were
diminished for larger lags (Fig. 3a) indicating a close temporal
relation.
Moreover, we found significant correlation between intracra-
nial recordings in the two hemispheres. This interhemispheric
alpha correlation was present between the left and right
centromedial thalamus as well as between the left and right
nucleus accumbens respectively (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, EEG
source images showed correlation in bilateral subcortical areas.
Yet, in some cases lateralization was dependent on the electrode
(left/right hemisphere) which was used for correlation (Fig. 2).
No significant alpha peak, ESI correlation and intracranial cross-
correlation between hemispheres could be detected in GTS2 for
right intracranial derivatives. Euclidian distances between the
actual intracranial electrode position and ESI correlation max-
imum of the closest subcortical cluster in the same hemisphere

 are ranging from 14.8 to 23.5 mm and are listed in Table 1.
Correlations between source reconstructed and intracranial alpha
envelopes are highest in close proximity to the intracranial
electrode position and decrease with increasing distance to it
(Fig. 3b). Note that the steepness of this decay is indicative for the
spatial resolution. Additionally, we report the spatial range in
which the correlation values are significant (p < 0.01 corrected,
permutation test) in Table 1. These ranges however are the wider,
the higher the max. correlation values are.
In order to achieve robust correlation results, several seconds of
recordings are needed, to capture alpha envelope dynamics which
are in the range of seconds (see also Fig. 1c). While the
correlation values computed from shorter time windows in the
same subcortical cluster considerably vary among each other,
their average correlation across windows remain stable (Fig. 3c)
as well as the related source images do, being spatially highly
correlated (r > 0.9) to each other.
Discussion
In this study, we provide direct evidence that scalp EEG indeed
can sense subcortical activities. In addition, we are able to locate
these activities using EEG source imaging, if a well-pronounced
signal is present at subcortical electrodes. The precision of the
localization is in accordance to known uncertainties of source
reconstruction techniques shown by real data5,19 as well as with
simulations for subcortical sources10.
Interestingly, we found significant correlation between the
intracranial recordings in the two hemispheres. Therefore, the
bilateral localization of subcortical signals we report in the EEG
source images is plausible and might stem from intrinsic
dynamics emerging during minimal sensory input, since patients
were instructed to close their eyes and remain as still as possible
during recordings. In this state, subcortical structures are likely to
default to their respective natural firing patterns. In accordance to
our results, thalamic single-unit and local field potential activity
were previously reported to be characterized by an oscillatory
bursting pattern at low (2–7 Hz) and alpha band frequencies
(8–13 Hz) recorded in the ventro oralis/centromedian parafasci-
cular thalamic complex of TS patients under full anesthesia
during surgery20. Further, alpha oscillations were previously
reported in the human nucleus accumbens during a decision
making task being coupled to gamma (40–80 Hz) amplitudes.
While this alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was strongest
during the task, it also was reported being present in resting
periods between tasks21. To the best of our knowledge, we pro-
vide first evidence for bilateral alpha envelop correlation in the
nucleus accumbens in humans during rest.
The absence of a well-pronounced alpha peak in GTS2 at the
right hemispheric electrode is concomitant with no significant
cross-correlation between hemispheres and non-significant ESI
correlation. This result confirms that a clear signal, i.e., alpha
oscillation in this work, must be present in subcortical recordings
in order to locate the dynamics of that particular signal with scalp
EEG.
The finding that scalp EEG can detect subcortical sources, in
our case alpha rhythms, shows that EEG contains both, cortical
and subcortical signals. Previous work reported the presence of

 distinct cortical and thalamocortical alpha generators16,22,23.
While our results suggest that EEG alpha waves contain thalamic
activity, that does not mean that thalamocortical interactions
might be the only alpha source. While volume conduction is
instantaneous, neuronal transmission of thalamo-cortical inter-
action takes time, i.e. leading to lags. Because we used intracranial
recordings as a covariate in the source reconstruction analyses to
isolate thalamic signals, the EEG source images intentionally
show the reconstructed counterpart of these signals, not cortical
activity driven by thalamic interactions. In the seminal work by
Lopes da Silva et al.16, alpha-rhythms with the same peak fre-
quency were recorded from both cortical and thalamic areas at
the same time, but the coherences between related cortical areas
were consistently larger than the thalamo-cortical coherences.
This explains why our correlation analysis of intracranial and
scalp EEG leads to correct identification of the subcortical sources
and is not dominated by cortical alpha activity being present at
the same time but loosely related to subcortical signals.
Previous work10–12 using simulations and source reconstruction
provided indirect evidence for the detectability of subcortical
sources in non-invasive EEG and MEG recordings. In this work,
we can confirm this finding with direct evidence from intracranial
recordings providing the ground truth of subcortical signals in
combination with non-invasive EEG source reconstruction locat-
ing these signals in close proximity to the actual recording sites.
Methods
EEG recordings. High-density EEG was recorded using an electrode net (Geodesic
Sensor Net, Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) consisting of 256 elec-
trodes that are interconnected by thin rubber bands and contains small sponges
soaked with saline water that touch the patient’s scalp surface directly.
Intracranial electrodes contained four contacts 1.5 mm and 0.5 mm apart for
the OCD and GTS patients, respectively. The precise localization of the electrodes
are given in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figure 1. The cables of the subcortical
electrodes exit the brain on the right parietal surface between the scalp EEG
electrodes and are connected to the Physio16 box of the amplifier, while the scalp
electrodes are all directly connected to the amplifier. Recordings of the EEG and
physio16 box are thus synchronized and A/D converted together, leading to a
precise synchronization of the signals. All data were collected at a sampling rate of
1 kHz and band-pass filtered between 0.1–100 Hz. The subcortical electrodes were
all referenced to a scalp reference at the right mastoid and were offline recalculated
to bipolar recordings. The scalp EEG was referenced to the vertex electrode and
was offline recalculated against the average reference.
EEG analysis. The high-density EEG was visually inspected for artifacts. Electrodes
with extensive artifacts were excluded and interpolated using a spherical spline
interpolation. Afterwards, periods of artifact-free EEG were selected lasting in total
at least 4 min.
We investigated one of the most prominent EEG phenomena during rest, i.e.,
alpha oscillations in the frequency range of 8–10 Hz, which are known to be
generated in the cortex as well as in thalamic nuclei17,24–26. We filtered EEG
and intracranial recordings in the range ±1 Hz to the individual alpha
spectral peak (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figure 2), identified with power
spectral density (PSD) analyses using Welch’s method27. Then, we computed
the analytical signal using Hilbert transform and calculated the inverse
solution for the real and imaginary part for each solution point in the

this leads to alpha amplitude envelopes for each solution point. The 3D
(xyz) information of each solution point was combined computing the
norm.
Source localization was applied using forward models based on realistic head
geometry and conductivity data with consideration of skull thickness, i.e., Locally

 LAURA13 was used to calculate the three-dimensional (3D) current density
distribution for each solution point at each moment in time.
The individual MRI (T1 and T2 weighted) with the corresponding ESI solution
points were aligned with postoperative CT scans using FLIRT implemented in
FSL31,32. Subcortical electrode coordinates were determined based on this
alignment and computing a linear fit matching the 3D trajectory of the implanted
lead DBS electrodes.
For intracranial recordings, we applied identical frequency analyses as for EEG
scalp recordings using filtering and Hilbert transform. For each hemisphere, one
bipolar deviation was selected for further analysis based on the existence of a
spectral peak in the PSD, since a spectral peak is a prerequisite to demonstrate a
brain oscillation within the frequency band of interest18.
These time series of alpha envelopes derived from subcortical electrodes were
subsequently correlated with their EEG source reconstructed equivalent at every
solution point. To limit spatial leakage effects, we thresholded the EEG source
amplitudes at their spatial average for every time frame before applying correlation
with intracranial amplitude envelopes. Therefore, the resulting source images
illustrate the correlation of actually recorded subcortical signals with EEG source
estimated data. Negative correlation values were ignored by setting them to zero,
because they might stem from the thresholding step in the analyses.
All analyses were performed using Cartool14 and custom written MATLAB
(MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States) scripts.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance of correlation values were determined
using nonparametric permutation tests33,34. In detail, we use maximum value
statistics, considering the whole solution space as volume of interest and therefore
correcting for multiple comparisons. To compute the permutation distribution, we
shifted EEG source space and intracranial signals relative to each other in time with
a randomized lag and computed correlation afterwards. Time lags ≤2 s were
excluded, due to the high autocorrelation of alpha amplitude envelopes in that
range given by their rather slow dynamics which are in the range of seconds (see
also Fig. 1c).
Because cross-correlation at zero-lag indicates precise temporal alignment, we
tested these correlation values for being significantly higher than those from
random time shifts between source reconstructed and intracranial alpha envelopes,
that we used to compute the permutation distribution. This procedure was
repeated 104 times and actual correlation values exceeding the p = 0.01 threshold of
maximum values derived from the permutations, were considered as significant.
