Summary
The National Institute on Aging Interventions Testing Program
(ITP) evaluates agents hypothesized to increase healthy lifespan
in genetically heterogeneous mice. Each compound is tested in
parallel at three sites, and all results are published. We report the
effects of lifelong treatment of mice with four agents not
previously tested: Protandim, fish oil, ursodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) and metformin – the latter with and without rapamycin,
and two drugs previously examined: 17-a-estradiol and nordihy-
droguaiaretic acid (NDGA), at doses greater and less than used
previously. 17-a-estradiol at a threefold higher dose robustly
extended both median and maximal lifespan, but still only in
males. The male-specific extension of median lifespan by NDGA
was replicated at the original dose, and using doses threefold
lower and higher. The effects of NDGA were dose dependent and
male specific but without an
effect on maximal lifespan.
Protandim, a mixture of botanical extracts that activate Nrf2,
extended median lifespan in males only. Metformin alone, at a
dose of 0.1% in the diet, did not significantly extend lifespan.
Metformin (0.1%) combined with rapamycin (14 ppm) robustly
extended lifespan, suggestive of an added benefit, based on
historical comparison with earlier studies of rapamycin given
alone. The a-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, at a concentration
previously tested (1000 ppm), significantly increased median
longevity in males and 90th percentile lifespan in both sexes,
even when treatment was started at 16 months. Neither fish oil
nor UDCA extended lifespan. These results underscore the
reproducibility of ITP longevity studies and illustrate the impor-
tance of identifying optimal doses in lifespan studies.
Key words: acarbose; fish oil; metformin; NDGA; Protandim;

Introduction
Interventions that delay aging may provide new tools to probe the
physiological processes and biochemical pathways that modulate aging
and potentially lead to the development of interventions that can
increase healthy lifespan in people. The National Institute on Aging
Interventions Testing Program (ITP) represents a multisite translational
research program to evaluate agents hypothesized to extend mouse

 lifespan by retarding aging and postponing late life diseases. Interven-
tions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the research
community are tested, in parallel, at three sites: The Jackson Laboratory
(TJL), University of Michigan (UM), and the University of Texas Health
Science Center at San Antonio (UT), using identical, standardized
protocols in genetically heterogeneous (UM-HET3) mice (Nadon et al.,
2016).
Fifty-three lifespan experiments, involving 30 test agents, have been
initiated in the first 11 years of the ITP. Significant effects on longevity, in
one or both sexes, have been published for 6 of the tested agents:
aspirin (Strong et al., 2008), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (Strong
et al., 2008; Harrison et al., 2014), rapamycin (Harrison et al., 2009;
Miller et al., 2011, 2014), acarbose (ACA) (Harrison et al., 2014),
methylene blue (Harrison et al., 2014), and 17-a-estradiol (17aE2)
(Harrison et al., 2014). Here, we report survival analyses for mice treated
with additional test agents, including ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA),
Protandim (Prot) and fish oil (FO), metformin (Met), or with the
combination of Met plus rapamycin (Rapa). We also report completed
lifespan analyses of mice treated with two compounds, 17aE2 and
NDGA, at doses higher or lower than those tested previously and with
one compound, ACA, started later in life than reported in an earlier
study (Harrison et al., 2014).
The interventions tested in this study were selected for the following
reasons:
17-a-estradiol (17aE2) is an optical isomer of 17-b-estradiol with
reduced affinity for estrogen receptors. This form of estrogen is reported
to be neuroprotective in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in an ischemia–
reperfusion animal model (Perez et al., 2005). It also has been reported
to protect against neurodegeneration in cell and animal models of
Parkinson’s disease (Dykens et al., 2005) and cerebrovascular disease
(Liu et al., 2005). We previously reported that treatment with 17aE2, at
a concentration of 4.8 ppm in food, increased median lifespan in males
using data pooled data from all three sites, but we noted dramatic site-
to-site variation, with a 28% increase in median at the UT site but much
smaller (3%) increases at the other two sites (Harrison et al., 2014).
17aE2, at 4.8 ppm, did not extend lifespan in female mice. To clarify the
effects of this agent, we have now repeated the longevity study at a
higher dose of 17aE2 (14.4 ppm) in both sexes.
Protandim (Prot) is a mixture of five botanical extracts, including
bacosides, silymarin, withaferin A, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and cur-
cumin. This composition was designed to stimulate Nrf2/ARE activation
at low concentrations of each of the compounds, in principle providing
strong, synergistic Nrf2 activation with minimized off-target side effects
(Velmurugan et al., 2009). Previous studies have shown that in healthy
humans supplemented orally with Prot over 120 days, superoxide
dismutase (SOD) was increased in red blood cells by 30%, and catalase
increased by 54% (Nelson et al., 2006). Furthermore, biochemical and
histological studies in mice revealed that feeding a Prot-supplemented
diet suppressed tumor promoter-induced oxidative stress, cell prolifer-
ation, and inflammation (Liu et al., 2009). Moreover, Prot treatment was
reported to protect the heart from oxidative stress and fibrosis in a
rodent model of pulmonary hypertension (Bogaard et al., 2009).
Metformin (Met) is an oral antidiabetic drug that has been FDA-
approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Nathan et al., 2006).
Treatment with Met lowers blood glucose, inhibits lipolysis, and
decreases circulating free fatty acids, while producing few undesired
side effects in people (Witters, 2001). Previous studies have shown that
Met also inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
pathway, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of the mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1)
substrates
S6K1
and
4E-BP1
and
decreased
protein
translation (Dowling et al., 2007). Studies in both vertebrates and
invertebrates have been reported showing that Met increases longevity.
For example, Met was recently shown to extend both the lifespan and
healthspan of the nematode C. elegans (Onken & Driscoll, 2010). Met
has also been shown to extend the lifespan of short-lived, tumor-prone,
HER2/neu mice and female SHR outbred mice (Anisimov et al., 2005).
More recently, de Cabo and colleagues reported that 0.1% Met in the
diet (i.e. at 1000 ppm) increased mean lifespan by 4–6% in male C57BL/
6J.Nia mice (Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013) and also improved indices of
health. Female mice were not tested in the de Cabo study. Conversely, a
study of Met on the lifespan of Fisher-344 rats found no effect on
lifespan (Smith et al., 2010).
Rapamycin (Rapa) and Met each inhibit mTORC1, but through distinct
mechanisms. In addition, Rapa affects glucose tolerance through
inhibition of a second mTOR complex, mTORC2, resulting in hepatic
insulin resistance (Lamming et al. 2013), while Met acts to activate
AMPK, suppressing hepatic glucose output (DeFronzo et al., 1991; Zhou
et al., 2001). Met would be expected to diminish the negative effects of
Rapa on hepatic glucose output and thus potentially lead to a survival
benefit greater than that produced by Rapa alone.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was chosen for testing because bile
acids (BAs), endogenous products of cholesterol catabolism, have been
reported to be associated with increased xenobiotic detoxification gene
expression in long-lived rodents (e.g. Amador-Noguez et al., 2007).
Moreover, in a clinical trial UDCA prevented colorectal adenoma
recurrence (Alberts et al., 2005). UDCA treatment suppressed chemically
induced diabetes in rats (Lukivskaya et al., 2004). Thus, UDCA has a
number of properties that suggested it might have anti-aging effects,
including increased xenobiotic stress resistance, protection from meta-
bolic derangements such as diabetes, and suppression of tumor
formation.
Nordihydroguaiaretic (NDGA) is produced by the leaves of the
creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). It is both a lipoxygenase inhibitor
and potent antioxidant. In earlier reports, it was shown to increase
median lifespan, but only in male mice (Strong et al., 2008; Harrison
et al., 2014). The sex difference was tentatively attributed to differences
in pharmacokinetics, as male mice maintained higher trough blood levels
of NDGA than females. To test this interpretation, and to define the
optimal NDGA concentration for lifespan extension in males, we
repeated the study starting at 6 months of age at the dose used in
the original study, 2500 ppm, plus doses higher (5000 ppm) and lower
(800 ppm) than tested previously. An interim survival analysis was
published (Harrison et al., 2014), reporting the effects of the three doses
on median lifespans in male mice and the highest dose on median
lifespan in female mice. Here, we report the completed survival analyses,
including the effects on maximal lifespan.
Fish oil (FO) was selected for testing, at two doses, in part because
several epidemiologic studies have associated reduced risk of cardiovas-
cular disease with fish or fish oil consumption (e.g. Kris-Etherton et al.,
2002). FO has also been shown to reduce several risk factors associated
with coronary heart disease (Sidhu, 2003) such as lowering triglyceride
levels (Kris-Etherton et al., 2002). Additionally, studies suggest that
consumption of FO or of its omega-3 fatty acids may have beneficial
effects on stroke, depression, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease (Rose &
Connolly, 1999; Sidhu, 2003).
Acarbose (ACA) is an inhibitor of intestinal a-glucosidase. It inhibits
digestion of polysaccharides and attenuates the uptake of sugars from
the GI tract. It lowers postprandial glucose excursions and is prescribed
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It was selected for testing in part
because it was proposed to act as a dietary restriction mimetic. In our

 earlier report, ACA increased median and maximal lifespan in both male
and female UM-HET3 mice (Harrison et al., 2014). In that study,
treatment was begun at 4 months of age. Because it is more clinically
relevant to begin anti-aging treatments late in life, we initiated a study in
which ACA treatment began at 16 months of age.
Results
17-a-estradiol (17aE2)
Beginning at 10 months of age, male and female mice were fed chow
containing 17aE2 at a concentration of 14.4 ppm (17aE2). As shown in
Table 1 and Figure 1, median lifespan increased 19% in male mice,
calculated from data pooled from the three sites (P < 0.001). The
effects of 17aE2 were significant at all three sites, at P < 0.003, with
increases in median survival of 26%, 9%, and 23% at TJL, UM, and UT
(Fig. S1, Supporting information). The age at which 90% of the mice
had died increased on average by 12% (21%, 8%, and 8% at the
three sites; Table S1, Supporting information), and the difference in
survival at the 90th percentile was significantly increased (P < 0.001 for
the pooled data; Table 1). 17aE2 treatment had no significant effect on
female survival, either in the pooled data or at any individual site
(Table 1,
Table
S1,
Supporting
information,
Fig. 1
and
Fig.
S1,
Supporting information). Interestingly, survival of male 17aE2-treated
mice was also significantly higher than survival for the female control
group
(P < 0.0006)
and
for
the
female
17aE2-treated
group
(P < 0.0135).
Although 17aE2 is generally thought to be ‘non-feminizing’, there is
evidence that 17aE2 can have uterotrophic effects (Clark et al., 1982).
17aE2 at 4.8 ppm, as used in our previous report (Harrison et al., 2014),
had no significant effects on uterine weight when fed to ovariectomized
mice (Fig. S2, Supporting information, P = 0.44). However, we consid-
ered the possibility that it might be uterotrophic at the higher dose
(14 ppm) used in our current study. We therefore tested for estrogenic
effects of the 17aE2 at 14 ppm in young- and middle-aged ovariec-
tomized UM-HET3 mice bred at UT. As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting
information), the 14.4 ppm 17aE2 diet fed to ovariectomized mice for
6 weeks increased uterine weight to a level statistically indistinguishable
from that of intact controls. Additionally, mice fed the high dose had
mean uterine weights significantly higher than that of the ovariec-
tomized control group (P = 0.0014).
Protandim (Prot)
Beginning at 10 months of age, one group of mice was fed chow
containing Prot at 600 ppm, to approximate the intake of humans who
consume this commercially available nutritional supplement. The dose of
Prot was increased from 600 to 1200 ppm when the mice reached
17 months of age, because testing of mice not included in the longevity
cohort had indicated that 600 ppm, contrary to expectation, did not
modulate levels of liver mRNA for genes involved in xenobiotic
responses. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, there was a significant
effect (P < 0.012) of Prot on survival of male mice in the pooled
population, with a 7% increase in median survival. There was no
significant difference in the proportion of control and Prot mice alive at
the age at 90% mortality (P = 0.1 by the ‘Wang–Allison test’). A
secondary analysis of the survival data from individual sites revealed a
significant increase in median survival (P = 0.03) at the UT site but no
significant effects at the TJL and UM sites (Fig. S3 and Table S1,
Supporting information). There were no significant effects of Prot on
median or maximal survival of females in the pooled data (Table 1,
Fig. 2) or in the data from any individual site (Table S1, Fig. S3,
Supporting information).
Metformin alone or with rapamycin (Met or Met/Rapa)
Beginning at 9 months of age, groups of male and female mice began
consuming a diet containing 1000 ppm (0.1%) Met. As shown in
Figure 2 and Table 1, Met led to a 7% increase in median lifespan of
males when data were pooled across sites, but the effect was not
statistically significant (P = 0.35). Males treated with Met had site-
specific changes of 13%, �1%, and 10% at the three test sites, but
none of these was statistically significant (Table S1, Supporting
information; see Fig. S4, Supporting information for the site-specific
survival curves). There was no effect of Met on survival of female mice,
either in the pooled data (Table 1, Fig. 3), or at any site (Table S1,
Fig. S4, Supporting information).
Figure 2 shows survival curves of male and female mice that received
both Met (1000 ppm) and Rapa (14 ppm) (Met/Rapa) from 9 months of
age. As shown in Table 1, this combination led to a 23% increase in
survival compared with controls in both sexes, as well as to significant
increases in maximum lifespan (P < 0.001). Met/Rapa led to a significant
increase in lifespan in both sexes at each site separately (Table S1 and

lifespan except for UT males.
Although the current (C2011) cohort did not contain any mice given
Rapa alone, we thought it would be of interest to compare the survival
of mice receiving both Rapa and Met to survival of mice treated with the
same Rapa dose in previous years, C2006 and C2009 (Miller et al., 2011,
2014). Results are shown in Table S4 (Supporting information). Males
given Met/Rapa had a 23% increase in median longevity, higher than the
10% effect produced by Rapa alone in C2006 or the 13% effect in
C2009 males. When the results from C2006 and C2009 males were
combined for optimal statistical power, and compared with survival in
C2011 mice receiving Met/Rapa, the difference did not reach statistical
significance (P = 0.12) using our standard calculation, which stratifies by
site. An alternate analysis, omitting site stratification, found P = 0.049
for the contrast between Met/Rapa and the historical datasets using
Rapa alone at the same dose. Female mice given Met/Rapa also had a
higher percentage increase in median lifespan (23%) than females that
had received rapamycin alone in the previous C2006 and C2009 cohorts
(18% and 21%, respectively), but the difference did not reach
significance by log-rank testing.
Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA)
In a previous study, we tested the effects of NDGA on survival of male
and female UM-HET3 mice at a dose of 2500 ppm and reported that
median lifespan was increased in males by 12%, with no benefit in
female mice (Strong et al., 2008). In the earlier study, 9% of male
control mice were alive at the joint 90th percentile age, compared with
13% of NDGA-treated males (P = 0.12). Female mice given 2500 ppm
had lower blood levels of NDGA compared with males, suggesting that
the sex effect might reflect sex-specific differences in drug metabolism or
excretion (Strong et al., 2008). It was also unclear whether the optimal
NDGA dose in males might be higher or lower than 2500 ppm. In the
current study, therefore, we tested the effects of NDGA at 800, 2500,
and 5000 ppm in males and at 5000 ppm in females, starting treatment
at 6 months. Our previous (Harrison et al., 2014) report showed that
median lifespan was increased at each dose in males and that there was
no effect of the high dose on median lifespan in females, despite the fact
that the highest dose in females produced a blood level equivalent to
that of males fed the original 2500 ppm dose. Here, we report the
completed lifespan analyses. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, NDGA
increased survival of male mice at each of the doses tested, with
increases in median lifespan at each dose (as reported previously in
Harrison et al., 2014). There was, however, no effect of NDGA
treatment on maximal lifespan at any dose tested in males, or in
females at the 5000 ppm dose tested (Table 2). There was also no effect
on maximal lifespan at any of the individual sites at any dose (Table S2,
Supporting information).
We have also now assessed the effects of NDGA on neuromuscular
performance. Male mice were given 2500 ppm and females given
5000 ppm from 13 months of age, and then tested at 22 months of
age, together with age-matched controls and young (4 month old)
control mice. Aging impaired grip strength and grip duration in old
male control mice (P < 0.05) as compared to young males. Grip
duration of male NDGA mice was indistinguishable from that of
young mice and significantly higher than that of old control males
(Fig. 4). In the rotarod tests, using a mixed-effects model that
compensated for day of testing, latency to fall in young mice, as
expected, was higher than in aged control mice in each sex (P = 0.01
for males, P < 0.001 for females). Fall latency was increased signif-
icantly by NDGA in both male and female mice at age 22 months
(Fig. 4; P = 0.02 in each sex).

 increase in body weight in males at 18 months of age, but no
significant effects on body weight in females (Fig. S8, Supporting

significant decline in male longevity at UM (�18%, P = 0.003, and that
the lower FO dose led to a 9% increase in male lifespan (P = 0.06) at

of simultaneous testing with parallel protocols at all three ITP sites and
the perils of relying on longevity tests conducted with a single dose at a
single site.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
Beginning at 5 months of age, mice were fed chow containing
5000 ppm UDCA. The results are shown in Figure 6 and Table 1,
with site-specific statistics in Table S1 (Supporting information).
Pooling the data across sites, there were no significant differences in
survival for male or female mice given UDCA, and no significant
benefits at any site considered separately (Table S1, Supporting
information). On the other hand, pooling across sites there were
significant effects of UDCA on body weights in males and female
mice as shown in Figure S7 (Supporting information). Body weighs
of UDCA-fed mice were significantly (P < 0.001) lower than control
at 12 and 18 months in male mice and at 12, 18, and 24 months of
age in female mice.
Acarbose (ACA)
Beginning at 16 months of age, mice were fed chow containing
1000 ppm ACA. The results are shown in Figure 6 and Table 2 with site-
specific statistics in Table S3 (Supporting information). Pooling the data
across sites, there was a significant increase in survival for male mice
treated with ACA, with a 6% increase in median lifespan and a
significant 12% increase in maximal lifespan (see Fig. 6 and Table 2).
ACA started at this late age had only a small effect on median lifespan in
females (2%, P = 0.07), but led to a significant (6%, P = 0.01) increase
in maximal lifespan.
Discussion
This paper provides new and updated longevity results for eight
compounds and mixtures tested by the ITP. 17aE2, previously shown
to provide modest and variable improvements in male lifespan, has now
been tested at a higher dose, and shown to produce dramatic and
consistent improvement in male longevity, but no benefits to female
mice. 17aE2 males live 19% longer than control males and longer than
control or 17aE2-treated females. Prot, a mixture that activates Nrf2, led
to a small but statistically significant increase (7%) in males, without a
significant improvement in survival to the 90th percentile age. On its
own, Met did not produce significant lifespan benefits in either sex. The
combination of Met/Rapa increased lifespan beyond the levels seen in
previous cohorts of mice given Rapa alone, particularly in male mice, but
statistical significance of this historical comparison was equivocal. An
interim analysis had revealed that NDGA increased lifespan of male mice
significantly at each of three tested doses (Harrison et al., 2014) but did
not increase female lifespan. The completed lifespan analysis reported
here revealed that NDGA did not significantly augment maximal
longevity in either sex. Male mice treated with NDGA were protected
against the age-related loss in grip duration, and mice of both sexes
were protected against age-related decline in rotarod performance.
ACA, previously shown to increase median and maximal lifespan in both
male and female mice when started at 4 months of age (Harrison et al.,
2014), was tested again, with treatment started at 16 months of age,
and shown to increase median lifespan in males, and maximal lifespan in
both sexes. Fish oil, at either of two tested concentrations, and the bile
acid UDCA produced no lifespan benefits at the tested concentrations.
In our previous study, 17aE2 at 4.8 ppm produced a significant
increase in male longevity in the pooled dataset, that is, by the planned
primary analysis, but a secondary analysis showed much stronger effects
at UT than at the other two sites, complicating interpretation. At the
higher dose (14 ppm) used in the current study, however, 17aE2 had
significant effects on male mice at each site, ranging from a 9% increase
at UM (P = 0.003) to 26% at TJL, with an average increase of 19%, only
slightly less than the 23% increase produced by the highest dose of

no benefits seen in females, either at the lower dose previously used or
at the higher dose used in the current cohort.
The mechanism underlying the sex-specific benefit of 17aE2 is
unknown. Interestingly, survival of male mice given 17aE2 was

 untreated females, suggesting that the beneficial effects in males were
not simply due to recapitulation of estrogenic effects produced
physiologically in normal females, in which estrogen levels vary
throughout the reproductive period and show age-related changes in
the postreproductive period. The dose of 17aE2 that we used in our
previous report (Harrison et al., 2014) had no significant effects on
uterine weight when fed to ovariectomized mice (see Fig. S2,
Supporting information), but the higher dose, 14 ppm, did produce
significant effects on uterine weights in ovariectomized mice. This
indicates that the dose of 17aE2 used in this study has bioactivity in
females and therefore that the lack of an effect on female survival was
not due to a lack of bioavailability in 17aE2-fed female mice. The
uterotrophic effect of this dose of 17aE2 also indicates that it acts on
classical estrogen receptors, at least at higher concentrations, and could
therefore modulate reproductive and other estrogen receptor-mediated
functions in males. It would be of interest to learn whether 17aE2 at
either dose modulates pathways thought to be relevant to aging and
lifespan, such as those linked to ATF4, mTOR, autophagy, adipokine
production, inflammation, proteasome function, and others, and does
so in a sex-specific way.
It is not known whether higher doses of 17aE2 might lead to a
greater degree of lifespan extension than the 19% increase documented
at 14 ppm in this study. Studies of the effects of 17aE2 in ovariec-
tomized females and castrated males, or in mice lacking the classical
estrogen receptor, or in testosterone-treated females, could also be
informative. Additional data on steroid metabolism and steroid-sensitive
feedback circuits, in male and female mice, might help to clarify the basis
for the effects of this agent on male mice, and provide clues as to how to
achieve similar success in females. It is notable that most deaths in UM-
HET3 mice are attributable to some form of neoplasia (Miller & Chrisp,
2002; Lipman et al., 2004; Harrison et al., 2014), suggesting that
studies of 17aE2 on oncogenesis and on host antitumor defenses also
deserve experimental attention.
The finding that the Nrf2 activator, Protandim (Prot), increased
longevity in genetically heterogeneous mice is consistent with previous
reports, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may be causally associated with
increased lifespan. Although we cannot rule out effects at other targets
by the individual constituents of the mixture of compounds contained in
Prot, the increase in expression of xenobiotic response genes in the livers
of mice in the present study at the 1200 ppm dose (data not shown)
further supports the idea that the effects of Prot on longevity may be at
least partly due to Nrf2 activation. For example, Leiser & Miller (2010)
reported that primary skin-derived fibroblasts from the long-lived Snell
dwarf mutant mouse manifest elevated levels of Nrf2, higher levels of
glutathione, and increased resistance to plasma membrane lipid perox-
idation. Consistent with those findings, mRNA levels for Nrf2-sensitive
genes were reported to be elevated in selected tissues of Snell dwarf
mice (Leiser & Miller, 2010). Taken together, these results suggest that
Nrf2 activation may contribute to the stress resistance and increased
longevity observed in the Snell dwarf mouse. In the present study, only
male mice showed positive effects of Prot on longevity. This sex-specific
effect may be due to differences in how males and females metabolize
and/or eliminate any or all of 5 constituents present in the mixture of
compounds contained in Prot. Alternatively, there may be sex differences
in the mechanisms that control the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. For example,
Sykiotis & Bohmann (2008) reported that D. melanogaster carrying a loss
of function mutation in Keap1 had increased Nrf2 activity, increased
oxidative stress resistance, and elevated longevity, but in male flies only.
Although male mice in the present study had a significant extension of
median lifespan, they did not show an increase in maximal lifespan,
suggesting that the effects of Prot are most beneficial earlier in life.
Phase II studies examining the effects of doses higher and lower than
those used in the present study may be informative in this regard. In
addition, studies examining the response to Prot over the lifespan may
also help elucidate mechanisms underlying the different effects of Prot
earlier and later in the lifespan.

 Metformin (Met) has been reported to increase longevity in male
mice of the C57BL/6 inbred stock (Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013) at a
dose of 1000 ppm, started at 54 weeks of age, leading to an increase
in mean lifespan of 5.8%. This increase was deemed to be significant
using the Gehan–Breslow statistic, which gives greater emphasis to
deaths at earlier ages than the log-rank test used in our own work. It is
not clear whether the use of the log-rank statistic for the C57BL/6 mice
would have supported the inference of a significant effect of Met. A
parallel study of male B6C3F1 mice also suggested a benefit of Met,
with a 4% extension of mean lifespan (Gehan–Breslow P = 0.06). The
de Cabo group did not report any data on female mice treated with
Met.
Our
current
study
used
the
same
dose
of
Met
(1000 ppm = 0.1%), but differs in several respects: use of genetically
heterogeneous mice, initiation of Met treatment at 9 months (rather
than 12 months) of age, evaluation of male and female mice, analysis
at three independent sites, and use of the log-rank statistic. Statistical
power also differed: The de Cabo group used 64 Met mice and 83
control mice, while the ITP protocol used 148 Met mice and 294
controls, distributed among the three test sites. The pooled ITP data
showed a non-significant effect of Met on median lifespan (7%
increase), and the site-specific effects (13%, �1%, and 10% at TJL,
UM, and UT) were also indistinguishable from chance. In the ITP
dataset, the age at 90th percentile mortality declined by 2% in the Met
group. In C57BL/6 mice, Met was toxic at a higher concentration of
10 000 ppm (1%) (Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013), and it is possible
that evaluation of doses higher or lower than the 1000 ppm dose we
used might have produced stronger evidence of benefit. Observational
data suggest that patients with diabetes who take metformin have
lower mortality risks than age-matched non-diabetic patients (Bannister
et al., 2014). These suggestive reports, together with the strong
evidence that Met can be administered with few side effects over many
years in people, have prompted suggestions that this agent should be
used in large-scale clinical trials to prevent age-associated disease in
non-diabetic subjects (Hall, 2015).
The decision to test the combination of Met and Rapa was based on
the idea that the disturbances in glucose homeostasis induced by Rapa
might limit its benefits on lifespan (Lamming et al., 2013) and that Met,
by increasing insulin sensitivity, might therefore compensate for poten-
tially harmful side effects. Our new data are consistent with this idea, in
that male and female mice treated with Met (at 1000 ppm) and Rapa (at
14 ppm) showed a greater percentage increase in median lifespan than
in either of two previous cohorts of mice treated with Rapa (at 14 ppm)
alone. Our evidence is inconclusive, however, in that the comparisons
are to historical rather than to simultaneous cohorts, the effect seen in
males is not statistically significant by our standard site-stratified log-rank
test (P = 0.12), and the effect in females is small.
It is possible that alternate dosing regimens, including protocols that
begin one or both drugs at later ages, or use other doses, or which
alternate drug-free with drug-treatment periods, could produce more
conclusive evidence of synergy between these two agents or others in
their class.
The use of rapamycin analogs with a reduced impact on glucose
metabolism, such as everolimus, might also be considered (Arriola Apelo
et al., 2016). Other compounds that regulate glucose homeostasis,
including the PPARc activator rosiglitazone, might also synergize with
rapamycin; rosiglitazone was recently shown to normalize fasting
hyperglycemia and attenuate rapamycin-induced glucose intolerance
and insulin resistance in rats (Festuccia et al., 2014). Acarbose, an agent
that extends both male and female lifespan and which is thought to
work by preventing post-prandial surges in blood glucose concentration
(Harrison et al., 2014), may also deserve consideration in combination
with rapamycin treatment.
Our new data on NDGA make two points of interest. First, the failure
of NDGA, at 2500 ppm, to increase longevity in female mice (Strong
et al., 2008) seems not to be due merely to lower blood concentrations
of this agent in females, because we fail to see increased female lifespan
even at a concentration, 5000 ppm, that produces blood levels similar to
those seen in males at 2500 ppm (Harrison et al., 2014). In addition, our
new data replicate the earlier finding of longevity increase using
2500 ppm in males and show that benefits are also seen at twofold
higher and threefold lower doses. NDGA did not, however, significantly
alter the proportion of mice alive at the 90th percentile at any dose,
suggesting that its positive effects may be limited to the middle portion
of the lifespan. The percentage increase in median male lifespan
increases with dose at TJL (7%, 16%, 19%) and at UT (5%, 11%, 15%),
but not at UM (7%, 2%, �7%), which may reflect the consistent, but
unexplained, pattern of higher longevity in UM control males compared
with control males at the other two test sites. The finding of increased
median lifespan, but no increase in maximum lifespan in NDGA-treated
male B6C3F1 hybrid mice, was also recently reported by Spindler et al.
(2015); females were not tested in the Spindler study. In the Spindler
study, significant results were seen at 3500 ppm but not at 1500, 2500,
or 4500 ppm. As discussed earlier for Prot, studies examining the
response to NDGA over the lifespan may also help elucidate mechanisms
underlying the different effects of NDGA earlier and later in the lifespan.
In contrast to the sex differences observed in NDGA’s effects on
lifespan, it is noteworthy that NDGA attenuated age-related deficits in
rotarod performance in both males and females. The lack of effect on
NDGA on female lifespan and its positive effects on female rotarod
performance supports the idea that mechanisms underlying the effects
of specific interventions on lifespan may be distinct from those
contributing to some age-sensitive physiological traits. Studying a wider
range of age-sensitive traits may be informative. The activity of NDGA as
an anti-inflammatory agent with antioxidative effects opens new
avenues for mechanistic testing and a tool for studying differences
between male and female mice for control of aging and late-life
diseases.
Although no previous studies of the effects of FO on lifespan of long-
lived strains of mice have been reported, several studies have been
reported in which omega-3 fatty acids increased lifespan in short-lived
autoimmune-prone (NZB 9 NZW)F1 mice (Jolly et al., 2001; Fernandes,
2008). A demographic analysis of the survival of fish oil-fed (NZBxNZW)F
(1) mice by de Magalhaes et al. (2005) revealed that fish oil altered the
Gompertz slope, increasing the mortality rate doubling time twofold (de
Magalhaes et al., 2005), suggesting that FO may slow aging. However,
in the present study there was no effect of encapsulated FO on lifespan
at either of two doses, 15 000 or 50 000 ppm, on either median or
maximal lifespan. There was, however, a significant effect on body
weight, at least in males, suggesting that FO was biologically active.
Thus, FO may increase lifespan, but only in a disease-specific context.
Treatment with the bile acid, UDCA, has been reported to have a
wide variety of effects that are compatible with extended lifespan in
mammals, including protecting against metabolic derangements such as
diabetes, and suppression of tumor formation (Oyama et al., 2002;
Lukivskaya et al., 2004). Nevertheless, no previous lifespan studies have
been reported for UDCA. At the dose used in this study, there were
significant reductions in body weight across the lifespan in both male
and female mice, suggesting that UDCA treatment had biological or
physiological effects. However, there was no effect of UDCA on median
or maximal lifespan in either sex. Given the wide range of positive effects
17aE2, Protandim, NDGA, ACA and lifespan, R. Strong et al.
880
ª 2016 The Authors. Aging Cell published by the Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
 reported for UDCA on measures of healthspan, it is unclear why it had
no effect on lifespan. It is possible that higher or lower doses of UDCA
may be effective. On the other hand, as we observed with NDGA in the
present study, the effects of specific interventions on lifespan may be
distinct from effects on age-sensitive physiological changes in specific
organ systems.
We previously reported that ACA increased median and maximal
lifespan in both male and female mice when started at 4 months of age
(Harrison et al., 2014). We tested ACA again at the dose used
previously, but with treatment started at 16 months of age. We found
that starting ACA treatment later in life led to increases in median
lifespan in males, and in maximal lifespan in both sexes. In the previous
study, the increase in median survival calculated from the pooled data
from male mice was 22%, but was only 6% in the present study.
Similarly, in females, there was a significant increase in survival in the
previous study, with a 5% increase in median lifespan, but no significant
effect (P = 0.07) on lifespan in the present study. Thus, the effects of
ACA treatment appear to be optimal when treatment is initiated earlier
in life. We are currently testing different doses, with treatment initiated
at an intermediate time (12 months of age). We are also performing
cross-sectional studies, testing the effects of ACA on age-sensitive
changes in multiple tissues. Studies like these may help us to better
understand the mechanism(s) of action of ACA on lifespan and
healthspan. Studies such as these may also help inform the design of
human trials of ACA, which is FDA-approved for treatment of type 2
diabetes.
The NIA ITP has matured into a useful test bed for initial investigation
of drugs and mixtures that deserve evaluation for lifespan extension in
mice (Nadon et al., 2016). The features of the ITP design, including
parallel studies in males and females at each of three laboratory sites, the
use of genetically heterogeneous mice to guard against conclusions
based on a single, typically inbred, genotype, and the use of enough
numbers of mice to provide decent statistical power for modest (e.g.
10%) lifespan benefits have now stimulated new ideas and impetus on
several biogerontological fronts. ITP studies of rapamycin have helped to
motivate new work on mTOR and aging in cells, mice, and even human
studies, while newer observations on acarbose and, now, 17aE2 are
expected to focus experimental attention on glucose transients and sex
steroids as potential mediators of age-related diseases and as potential
guides to human preventive trials. Many of the drugs are known to be
safe in humans (for short-term or long-term use), and clinical studies are
easy to imagine and in some cases, for example, rapamycin and
acarbose, are already underway even prior to a definitive molecular
understanding of target(s). We note that some of the most impressive
ITP longevity results, such as those seen with acarbose and 17aE2, reflect
physiological pathways that are not easy to model in worms or flies,
whose pathways of starch digestion and steroid sensitivity differ
dramatically from those used by mammals. The growing availability of
tissue banks from mice treated with these agents should serve as a spur
toward increased collaboration on the pathways by which these drugs
lead to preserved health and postponed mortality in mice.
Experimental procedures
Animals
UM-HET3 mice were produced at each of the three test sites as
previously described in detail (Miller et al., 2011; Strong et al., 2013;
Harrison et al., 2014). The mothers of the test mice were CByB6F1/J, JAX
stock #100009, whose female parents are BALB/cByJ and whose male
parents are C57BL/6J. The fathers of the test mice were C3D2F1/J, JAX
stock #100004, whose mothers are C3H/HeJ, and whose fathers are
DBA/2J. For breeding cages, each site used Purina 5008 mouse chow.
For weanlings prior to 4 months of age, each site used Purina 5LG6.
Mice were housed as previously described (e.g., Strong et al., 2013)
in plastic cages with metal tops, using ¼ inch corn-cob bedding (Bed
O’Cobs, produced by The Andersons, PO Box 114, Maumee, Ohio). Mice
were given free access to water, acidified (pH 2.5–2.7) by addition of
hydrochloric acid, using water bottles rather than an automated
watering system. Mice were housed in ventilated cages and were
transferred to fresh cages every 14 days. Temperature was maintained
within the range of 21–23 °C.
At the age of 42 days, each cage was assigned to a control or test
group by use of a random number table. Each mouse was then briefly
anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation administered either by nose cone or
by an instrument designed for small animal anesthesia, and an electronic
ID chip was implanted by sterile syringe beneath the dorsal skin between
the shoulder blades, after which the wound was closed by a drop of
superglue (Loctite gel, purchased locally, or Nexaband S/C, purchased
from Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA). UM and UT used
chips purchased from AVID Microchip ID Systems (Catalog AVID3002;
Folsom, LA, USA); TJL used chips purchased from Locus Technology
(Manchester, MD, USA; catalog 1D-100A). A portion of the distal tail
(1 cm) was taken and frozen for later analysis of DNA polymorphisms,
after which the mouse was permitted to awaken from the anesthesia.
The duration of anesthesia was approximately 1–2 min.
Mice received Purina 5LG6 control diet until treatments were begun.
Starting at various ages as listed in the results section, mice in the
treatment groups received Purina 5LG6 containing the additives, at all
three sites, and mice in the control group received Purina 5LG6.
Details of the methods used for health monitoring were provided in
Miller et al. (2014); in brief, each of the three colonies was evaluated
four times each year for infectious agents, including pinworm. All such
tests were negative throughout the entire study period.
Control and experimental diets
All diets were prepared by TestDiet, Inc., a division of Purina Mills
(Richmond, IN, USA). Purina 5LG6 food containing each of the test
substances, as well as batches of control diet, was prepared at intervals
of approximately 4 months. Each batch of food was shipped at the same
time to each of the three test sites. Protandim� was a gift from
LifeVantage Corp. (Sandy, UT, USA). It was mixed with chow at a
concentration of 600 mg of Prot per kg of food (600 ppm) and fed to
mice beginning at 10 months of age. The dose of Prot was increased
from 600 ppm to 1200 ppm when the mice reached 17 months of age.
17aE2 was purchased from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI, USA) and mixed
at a dose of 14.4 milligrams per kilogram diet (14.4 ppm). Mice were fed
the 17aE2 diet continuously from 10 months of age. Metformin was a
gift from Rafael de Cabo (National Institute on Aging Intramural
Program) and used at a dose of 1000 mg kg�1 (0.1%) beginning at
9 months of age.
Microencapsulated
rapamycin
was
obtained
from
Southwest
Research Institute (San Antonio, TX) and mixed at a concentration of
14 ppm with metformin (1000 ppm) to determine the effects of the
mixture on longevity. The mixture was fed to mice starting at 9 months
of age. NDGA was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI,
USA) and mixed at a concentration of either 800, 2500, or 5000 ppm
and fed to male mice beginning at 4 months of age. A group of female
mice received only the diet containing 5000 ppm of NDGA from

(containing DHA, minimum 132 mg/g of powder; and EPA plus DHA,
minimum 168 mg kg�1 of powder) was purchased from Ocean Nutri-
tion Canada (Dartmouth, NS, Canada), and incorporated into food at a
concentration of 15 000 and 50 000 ppm. Mice were fed FO contin-
uously from 9 months of age. Acarbose was purchased from Spectrum
Chemical Mfg. Corp., Gardena, CA, USA. It was mixed at a concentra-
tion of 1000 mg of ACA per kilogram of diet (1000 ppm); mice were fed
continuously from 16 months of age.
Measurement of motor coordination and strength
Groups of male and female UM-HET3 mice were fed control or NDGA-
containing diets (males – 2500 ppm; females – 5000 ppm) beginning at
13 months of age and were treated until they were 22 months of age. A
group of 4-month-old mice fed the control diet served as young control
group.
Removal of mice from the longevity population
As described in detail in Miller et al. (2011), mice were removed from
the study because of fighting, or accidental death, typically during chip
implantation, or because of chip failure, or because they were used for
another experimental purpose, such as testing for blood levels of a test
agent. For survival analyses, all such mice were treated as alive at the
date of their removal from the protocol, and lost to follow-up
thereafter. These mice were not included in calculations of median
longevity.
Estimation of age at death (lifespan)
Mice were examined at least daily for signs of ill health. Mice were
euthanized for humane reasons if so severely moribund that they were
considered, by an experienced technician, unlikely to survive for more
than an additional 48 h. A mouse was considered severely moribund if it
exhibited more than one of the following clinical signs: (i) inability to eat
or to drink; (ii) severe lethargy, as indicated by reluctance to move when
gently prodded with a forceps; (iii) severe balance or gait disturbance; (iv)
rapid weight loss over a period of 1 week or more; or (v) an ulcerated or
bleeding tumor. The age at which a moribund mouse was euthanized
was taken as the best available estimate of its natural lifespan. Mice
found dead were also noted at each daily inspection. At the time of
analysis of the C2011 population, 954 female mice had died, 19 had
been removed, and 11 were still alive, including one control and 10 mice
in the MetRapa group. Among males, 1039 had died, 50 had been
removed (mostly because of fighting), and 9 were still alive, including
one control mice, one in the Prot group, one in the MetRapa group, and
six in the 17aE2 group.
Rotarod performance
Mice were tested on a rotarod (Rotamex-5; Columbus Instruments,
Columbus, Ohio) for 5 days by a technician who was blinded to the
treatment groups. Testing on each day consisted of 8 trials with a 10-min
rest between trials 4 and 5. Each trial began with the rotarod set at an
initial rate of 4 rpm, accelerating to a maximum 40 rpm within 300 s.
The latency to fall was recorded by the Rotamex-5 software, and the
average latency to fall was calculated for each day.
Grip strength
Grip strength was determined using a digital grip meter (Chatillion;
Columbus Instruments), by a technician who was blinded to the
experimental groups. Each animal was allowed to grip a wire mesh
screen with either the forelimbs or forelimbs and hindlimbs. The tail was
gently and steadily pulled to measure the maximum force and duration
until the mouse released the wire mesh screen. The grip strength meter
software collected the maximum grip force produced in gram-force (gf)
and the latency (milliseconds) to release the wire mesh screen for each of
the 5 trials. The average grip strength and grip duration were calculated
from the 5 trials.
Measurement of 17aE2 estrogenicity
UM-HET3 mice were ovariectomized at 2 months of age and then
given mouse chow containing 17aE2 at 4.8 or 14.4 ppm or diet
without hormone. Treatments continued for 2 months. Untreated
intact mice (6.25 months of age at sacrifice) were also included as
normal controls. Mice were euthanized and uteri were dissected free of
fat and mesentery, nicked and blotted to release luminal fluid, and
weighed.
Statistical methods
For each sex, we performed site-specific and combined site analysis. We
calculated the Kaplan–Meier estimate of the median survival for the
control group as well as for each treatment group. To compute the
median percentage increase, we subtracted the median age in the
control group from the corresponding value in the treatment group and
divided the difference by median age of the control group and multiplied
by 100. Using a two-sided 5% significance level, we performed the log-
rank test to determine whether survival curves for mice receiving
treatment differ from the survival function for control mice. Log-rank
tests that pooled data across the three test sites used a method that
stratifies by site. To assess the maximum lifespan, we computed 90th
percentile age of both the treated and control mice. To determine which
treatments prolonged longevity in mice, we utilized the Wang–Allison
test (Wang et al., 2004). This is the Fisher exact test comparing the
numbers of mice surviving in control and treatment group at the age
corresponding to the 90th percentile of lifespan in the joint survival
distribution. To determine the difference between the survival function
in treated and control group while controlling for site effect, we
performed log-rank test stratified by site. We further assessed the
longevity of mice in all three sites combined using a modified version of
the Wang–Allison test in the manner with which the 2 9 2 contingency
table is constructed. Basically, we report the sum of corresponding site-
specific 2 9 2 tables cell entries as the combined site 2 9 2 table cell
entries. This allows for information from all sites to be used in a balanced
manner.
For statistical analysis of the rotarod performance, the average of
time-to-fall sessions for each animal on each day (1–5) was considered
as a repeated measure. We used a mixed-effect linear model with a
random intercept for males and females separately and estimated the
main effects of day, group (Old Control, Old NDGA, and Young
control), and the group-by-day interaction. The statistical significance of
the group-by-day interaction would indicate that the groups have
difference learning trajectories (as distinct from just being higher or
lower
on
average).

 to reduce the number of comparisons, day was considered as a linear
or a quadratic effect, depending on the significance of the quadratic
term. We further compared each of the three subgroups to one
another by excluding the other group for both males and females (Old
Control vs. Young; Old Control vs. Old NDGA; Young vs. Old NDGA).
In these models, we only considered the main effects of day (1–5) and
group. We used R (v3.1+, Vienna, Austria) and the lmer1 and lmerTest 2
packages.
Grip strength data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA followed by
the Tukey post hoc test to determine the significance of differences
between means of individual groups.
