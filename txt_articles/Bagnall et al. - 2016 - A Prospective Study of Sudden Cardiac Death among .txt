BACKGROUND
Sudden cardiac death among children and young adults is a devastating event. We 
performed a prospective, population-based, clinical and genetic study of sudden 
cardiac death among children and young adults.
METHODS
We prospectively collected clinical, demographic, and autopsy information on all 
cases of sudden cardiac death among children and young adults 1 to 35 years of 
age in Australia and New Zealand from 2010 through 2012. In cases that had no 
cause identified after a comprehensive autopsy that included toxicologic and his-
tologic studies (unexplained sudden cardiac death), at least 59 cardiac genes were 
analyzed for a clinically relevant cardiac gene mutation.
RESULTS
A total of 490 cases of sudden cardiac death were identified. The annual incidence 
was 1.3 cases per 100,000 persons 1 to 35 years of age; 72% of the cases involved 
boys or young men. Persons 31 to 35 years of age had the highest incidence of 
sudden cardiac death (3.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year), and persons 16 to 
20 years of age had the highest incidence of unexplained sudden cardiac death 
(0.8 cases per 100,000 persons per year). The most common explained causes of 
sudden cardiac death were coronary artery disease (24% of cases) and inherited 
cardiomyopathies (16% of cases). Unexplained sudden cardiac death (40% of cases) 
was the predominant finding among persons in all age groups, except for those 
31 to 35 years of age, for whom coronary artery disease was the most common 
finding. Younger age and death at night were independently associated with unex-
plained sudden cardiac death as compared with explained sudden cardiac death. 
A clinically relevant cardiac gene mutation was identified in 31 of 113 cases (27%) 
of unexplained sudden cardiac death in which genetic testing was performed. Dur-
ing follow-up, a clinical diagnosis of an inherited cardiovascular disease was 
identified in 13% of the families in which an unexplained sudden cardiac death 
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS
The addition of genetic testing to autopsy investigation substantially increased the 
identification of a possible cause of sudden cardiac death among children and 
young adults. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
S
udden cardiac death among chil-
dren and young adults is a devastating 
event for the family and wider community. 
Coronary artery disease is the predominant 
cause of sudden cardiac death in older persons,1 
whereas among persons 1 to 35 years of age, 
sudden cardiac death is more often caused by 
structural heart disease, including hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhyth-
mogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, myo-
carditis, and primary arrhythmogenic disorders 
(such as the congenital long-QT syndrome, the 
Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic poly-
morphic ventricular tachycardia).2-5 Many of these 
cardiac causes of sudden cardiac death among 
children and young adults have an underlying 
genetic basis.6,7
Estimates in studies of the incidence of sud-
den cardiac death vary widely owing to differ-
ences in the age range of the various study 
populations; in addition, studies are often lim-
ited by small sample size and by retrospective 
and non–population-based study designs. A na-
tionwide retrospective study of sudden cardiac 
death in an unselected population of persons 1 to 
35 years of age in Denmark showed an incidence 
of 2.8 per 100,000 person-years, or 1.9 per 
100,000 person-years when only autopsied cases 
were considered.8 A similar incidence of 1.8 per 
100,000 per year was found after a review of 
death certificates in England and Wales.9
In up to one third of cases of sudden cardiac 
death among children and young adults, a cause 
of death is not found after a comprehensive au-
topsy examination that includes toxicologic and 
histologic studies; these deaths are termed un-
explained sudden cardiac deaths.3,8,10-12 Unex-
plained sudden cardiac death is often attributed 
to cardiac arrhythmia caused by cardiac ion-
channel dysfunction, which is undetectable in a 
conventional autopsy. Noncardiac conditions may 
also cause sudden death that is clinically indis-
tinguishable from sudden cardiac death. For ex-
ample, patients with epilepsy have a higher rate 
of sudden death than persons without epilepsy, 
and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the 
most common cause of death related to epilepsy.13
Autopsy-based genetic studies of the major 
genes for the long-QT syndrome and catechol-
aminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 
(a four-gene “molecular autopsy” including the 
KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, and RYR2 genes) have 
identified a pathogenic mutation in up to one 
third of unexplained sudden cardiac deaths that 
were referred for postmortem genetic testing.14,15 
However, in population-based, nonreferred cases 
of unexplained sudden cardiac death, the preva-
lence of pathogenic mutations in the major 
genes for the long-QT syndrome is significantly 
lower.16,17 Furthermore, population-based studies 
of human genetic variation have revealed an 
abundance of rare variants, which has led to 
increasingly stringent mutation classification cri-
teria and a lower diagnostic yield of autopsy 
genetic testing for unexplained sudden cardiac 
death.18,19 We performed a 3-year, prospective, 
population-based study of sudden cardiac death 
among persons 1 to 35 years of age in Australia 
and New Zealand and focused on determining 
the underlying cause of death after a comprehen-
sive autopsy examination and genetic testing.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
All major forensic pathology centers in Australia 
and New Zealand prospectively collected pre-
morbid and autopsy investigation data on all 
cases of sudden cardiac death that occurred in 
persons 1 to 35 years of age from January 2010 
through December 2012. Autopsy examinations 
were performed by the medical examiners at 
these centers according to the guidelines of the 
Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.20 In 
addition, case reports of deaths that had been 
investigated by a coroner were retrieved from the 
National Coronial Information System (for Aus-
tralia) and the Case Management System (for 
New Zealand) and from the registries of births, 
deaths, and marriages in each Australian state 
and territory.
Coroners’ autopsy reports, which included 
toxicologic and histologic findings, and police 
reports of death were reviewed to identify cases 
of sudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death 
was defined as a sudden unexpected death in an 
otherwise healthy person within 1 hour after the 
onset of symptoms or, when unwitnessed, with-
in 24 hours after the person was last seen in 
good health. Unexplained sudden cardiac death 
was defined as sudden cardiac death for which 
no cause was identified after a complete and 
comprehensive autopsy examination that included 
histologic and toxicologic studies (see the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

Sudden Cardiac Death among Children and Young Adults
A forensic pathologist, an adult cardiologist, and 
two pediatric cardiologists assessed all cases of 
sudden cardiac death. Cases in which the details 
were insufficient to define the death as sudden 
cardiac death and cases of sudden unexplained 
death in epilepsy were excluded from our study.
This study was approved by the ethics com-
mittee of each state government in Australia and 
in New Zealand. In 290 cases, permission from 
the next of kin was obtained, which allowed 
detailed data on the sudden cardiac death to be 
recorded and a blood sample to be collected at 
autopsy for genetic analysis. In addition, for the 
cases in which permission was obtained, clinical 
follow-up was recommended for all first-degree 
relatives if an inherited heart disease was sus-
pected.5 For cases in which permission was not 
obtained, only age, sex, and cause and circum-
stances of death were recorded; such cases were 
termed de-identified cases. All the authors vouch 
for the completeness and accuracy of the data 
and analyses.
DNA Collection and Genetic Analysis
DNA was isolated from samples of whole blood 
obtained at autopsy, as described previously.18 
The genetic analysis of DNA in cases of unex-
plained sudden cardiac death is summarized in 
Figure 1. In 51 of the 113 cases of unexplained 
sudden cardiac death (45%), we performed clin-
ical-grade sequencing (i.e., a next-generation 
sequencing test accredited through the National 
Association of Testing Authorities) of the coding 
exons of 69, 98, or 101 cardiac disease genes on 
the Illumina MiSeq platform (Victorian Clinical 
Genetic Services). In 62 of the 113 cases (55%), 
commercial research-grade exome sequencing 
(i.e., exome-sequencing service intended for re-
search purposes) was performed on the Illumina 
HiSeq2000 platform (Macrogen). Alignment, 
variant calling, and annotation of all sequencing 
data were performed at the Centenary Institute, 
Sydney.
Filtering and Classification of Variants
We searched for variants with a general popula-
tion frequency of less than 0.1% in 59 cardiac 
genes common to all sequencing panels and 
divided the findings into four groups: conven-
tional molecular autopsy genes (4 genes), cardiac 
arrhythmia genes (16), major and minor cardio-
myopathy genes (16), and rare cardiomyopathy 
genes (23). In addition, we searched for variants 
in 72 epilepsy genes in the 62 exome-sequenced 
cases. A list of the target genes is shown in Ta-
ble S1 in the Supplementary Appendix; the vari-
ant classification scheme and a description of 
the scheme are provided in Figure S1 and the 
Methods section, respectively, in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Copy-Number Variation and Multiplex 
Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification
Copy-number variants were detected with the use 
of eXome-Hidden Markov Model software21 in 
45 cases of unexplained sudden cardiac death and 
in 48 unrelated control exomes from patients 
with structural heart disease who attended the 
Genetic Heart Diseases Clinic, Royal Prince Alfred 
Hospital, Sydney. Multiplex ligation-dependent 
probe amplification of five long-QT syndrome 
genes (i.e., SCN5A, KCNH2, KCNQ1, KCNE1, and 
KCNE2) was performed, as described previously, 
in 71 cases.22 Additional details of these analyses 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the use of 
IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 22 (SPSS), 
and SAS Studio software (SAS Institute). Con-
tinuous variables were compared with the use of 
unpaired Student’s t-tests and are reported as 
means with standard deviations; categorical vari-
ables were compared with the use of chi-square 
tests and are reported as frequencies and per-
centages. P values of less than 0.05 were consid-
ered to indicate statistical significance. Univari-
ate and multivariate logistic-regression models 
were used to assess variables associated with un-
explained sudden cardiac death, as compared with 
explained sudden cardiac death (see the Meth-
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Results
Incidence of Sudden Cardiac Death among 
Children and Young Adults
From 2010 through 2012, a total of 490 cases of 
sudden cardiac death were identified in persons 
1 to 35 years of age; 360 (73%) were identified at 
11 centers in Australia and 130 (27%) at 5 cen-
ters in New Zealand. Of the 490 cases of sudden 
cardiac death, 198 (40%) were unexplained. Dur-
ing the study period, the mean combined popu-
lation of Australia and New Zealand was 26.74 
million persons, of whom 12.59 million were 1 to

Sudden Cardiac Death among Children and Young Adults
35 years of age.23 On the basis of these figures, 
the annual incidence of sudden cardiac death in 
Australia and New Zealand was 1.3 cases per 
100,000 persons (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 
1.4); men and boys had a higher incidence than 
did women and girls (1.8 vs. 0.7 cases per 
100,000 persons, P<0.001). Persons 31 to 35 years 
of age had the highest incidence of sudden car-
diac death (3.2 cases per 100,000 persons), and 
persons 16 to 20 years of age had the highest 
incidence of unexplained sudden cardiac death 
(0.8 cases per 100,000 persons) (Fig. 2A).
Characteristics, Circumstances, and Causes 
of Sudden Cardiac Death
The demographic and clinical characteristics of 
patients who died from sudden cardiac arrest are 
provided in Table 1. A total of 72% of the patients 
were male, and the mean (±SD) age at death was 
24±10 years. The greatest number of cases oc-
curred among persons 31 to 35 years of age, and 
the least among persons 6 to 10 years of age 
(Fig. 2B). The most common finding at autopsy 
(in 40% of cases) was a structurally normal heart 
(i.e., no cause of death identified [unexplained 
sudden cardiac death]), followed by coronary 
artery disease (in 24% of cases), inherited cardio-
myopathies that included dilated cardiomyopathy, 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmo-
genic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (cumula-
tively accounting for 16% of the cases), myocar-
ditis (7% of cases), and aortic dissection (4% of 
cases) (Fig. 2C). Most cases of sudden cardiac 
death occurred while the person was sleeping 
(38%) or at rest (27%), whereas sudden cardiac 
death during exercise (11%) or after exercise 
(4%) was relatively uncommon (Fig. 2D).
Unexplained sudden cardiac death was more 
likely than explained sudden cardiac death to 
have occurred in women or girls, in younger 
persons, and during sleep or during the night-
time hours between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. (Table 1). 
A comparison of cases of unexplained sudden 
cardiac death and explained sudden cardiac death 
according to age group revealed important age-
specific differences. Among 49 children 1 to 5 
years of age, 37 cases of sudden cardiac death 
(76%) were classified as unexplained sudden 
cardiac death; a total of 26 of the 37 cases (70%) 
occurred among boys and 30 of 33 cases (91%) 
occurred during sleep (information was not avail-
able for all 37 cases). In contrast, among 173 
persons 31 to 35 years of age, 42 cases of sudden 
cardiac death (24%) were classified as unex-
plained sudden cardiac death; a total of 24 of 
these 42 cases (57%) occurred among men and 
10 of 31 cases (32%) occurred during sleep. Un-
explained sudden cardiac death was the pre-
dominant finding in all age groups, except 
among persons 31 to 35 years of age, for whom 
coronary artery disease was the most common 
finding. Multivariate analysis showed that after 
adjustment for sex, younger age group (as com-
pared with persons 31 to 35 years of age) and 
death at night were significantly and indepen-
dently associated with unexplained sudden car-
diac death as compared with explained sudden 
cardiac death. Additional details of the charac-
teristics, circumstances, and causes of sudden 
cardiac death are provided in Tables S2 through 
S5 and in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Genetic Analysis of Cases of Unexplained 
Sudden Cardiac Death
Among the 198 cases of unexplained sudden 
cardiac death, permission from the next of kin 
Figure 1 (facing page). Investigation of Cases of Sudden 
Cardiac Death.
A total of 490 cases of sudden cardiac death were identi-
fied. A diagnosis was established on the basis of conven-
tional autopsy in 292 cases, and in 198 cases, no diag-
nosis was evident (unexplained sudden cardiac death). 
For 113 cases of unexplained sudden cardiac death, DNA 
from the patient was available. For these cases, mas-
sively parallel sequencing was performed on a clinical-
grade cardiac gene panel (i.e., a next-generation sequenc-
ing test accredited through the National Association of 
Testing Authorities) in 51 cases and a commercial re-
search-grade exome (i.e., exome-sequencing service 
intended for research purposes) in 62 cases. An analy-
sis of 59 cardiac genes common to all sequencing 
 
technologies was performed on all cases. Copy-number 
variation analysis of exome data was performed in 45 
cases with the use of SureSelect exome sequencing 
data (Agilent Technologies). An analysis of 72 epilepsy 
genes was performed in all 62 cases with the use of 
exome sequencing data. Multiplex ligation-dependent 
probe amplification analysis was performed in 71 cases 
of unexplained sudden cardiac death for which a suffi-
cient amount of DNA of adequate quality were avail-
able. The NextEra exome enrichment kit is manufac-
tured by Illumina.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
was given and a blood sample was obtained in 
113 cases (57%), and genetic analysis of at least 
59 cardiac arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy genes 
was performed in these 113 samples (Fig. 1). In 
the 4 molecular autopsy genes, we found 3 patho-
genic and 7 probably pathogenic variants, for a 
diagnostic yield of 9%. In 16 additional cardiac 
arrhythmia genes, we found 6 probably patho-
genic variants. In 16 major and minor cardiomy-
opathy genes, we found 1 pathogenic and 13 
probably pathogenic variants, and in 23 rare 
cardiomyopathy genes, we found 6 probably 
pathogenic variants. The 36 pathogenic and prob-
ably pathogenic variants were found in 31 cases 
of unexplained sudden cardiac death. In 62 cases 
of unexplained sudden cardiac death, exome 
sequencing had been performed and we found 
4 probably pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes, 
for a diagnostic yield of 6%. Lists of the rare 
variants in the four groups of cardiac genes are 
provided in Tables S6 through S9, and a list of 
the rare variants in epilepsy genes in Table S10, 
in the Supplementary Appendix. The demograph-
ic characteristics of the patients and relevant 
autopsy findings in the cases of unexplained 
sudden cardiac death for which a pathogenic or 
probably pathogenic cardiac gene variant was 
identified (31 of the 113 cases in which genetic 
analysis was performed [27%]) are provided in 
Table 2.
We detected a mean of 4.7 copy-number vari-
ants per sample; however, none overlapped with 
cardiac disease genes. Multiplex ligation-depen-
dent probe amplification of five long-QT syn-
drome genes in 71 of the 113 cases of unex-
plained sudden cardiac death did not reveal 
deletions or duplications. Overall, age at death, 
sex, or activity at the time of death was not 
 
associated with a pathogenic variant among 
the cases of unexplained sudden cardiac death 
(Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).

of Unexplained Sudden Cardiac Death

Sudden Cardiac Death among Children and Young Adults
could not be followed up because the families 
had declined follow-up or because information 
on the families was not available, and 53 fami-
lies could not be followed up because the cases 
had been de-identified (Fig. S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). A definite clinical diagnosis 
was established in 12 of the 91 families (13%) 
that underwent follow-up clinical screening; in-
herited arrhythmogenic diseases were identified in 
7 families (the long-QT syndrome in 4, catechol-
aminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 
in 1, the short-QT syndrome in 1, and primary 
conduction disease in 1) and inherited cardiomy-
opathies were identified in 5 families (arrhythmo-
genic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in 2 and 
dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncom-
paction, or both in 3).
Discussion
This 3-year prospective, population-based study 
of sudden cardiac death among persons 1 to 35 
years of age in Australia and New Zealand identi-
fied 490 cases of sudden cardiac death, represent-
ing an incidence rate of 1.3 cases per 100,000 
persons per year. The most common finding 
after autopsy was unexplained sudden cardiac 
death, which accounted for a larger proportion 
of cases of sudden cardiac death than did ex-
plained sudden cardiac death in younger age 
groups and among persons who died during 
nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Genetic 
analysis of 4 molecular autopsy genes revealed 
pathogenic and probably pathogenic variants in 
9% of the cases of unexplained sudden cardiac 
death. Genetic analysis of an additional 55 car-
diac genes in the cases of unexplained sudden 
cardiac death resulted in an overall diagnostic 
yield of 27%. Therefore, autopsy investigation 
combined with genetic testing and family screen-
ing was associated with a substantially higher 
likelihood of identifying a possible cause of sud-
den cardiac death among children and young 
adults than did autopsy investigation alone.
The incidence and underlying causes of death 
in our study varied according to age group. A to-
tal of 10% of all the cases of sudden cardiac 
death in our study occurred among children 1 to 
5 years of age; most of these deaths occurred 
among infants and young children 1 to 2 years 
of age. Sudden cardiac death among infants and 
young children 1 to 2 years of age probably has 
shared causes with the sudden infant death syn-
drome, which is classified as the unexplained 
death of an infant younger than 1 year of age.24-27 
Children 6 to 10 years of age had the lowest rate 
of sudden cardiac death (0.8%), after which 
the risk increased, as reported previously.28,29 The 
incidence of cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic car-
diomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and ar-
rhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) 
as a cause of sudden cardiac death among chil-
dren and young adults in our study was lower 
than that observed in previous studies30; this 
finding may reflect improved diagnosis and 
management in recent years, including the appro-
priate use of implantable cardioverter–defibrilla-
tor therapy.31-33 Coronary artery disease was the

most common finding among persons 31 to 35 
years of age.
A clinically important finding was that the 
majority of sudden cardiac deaths occurred either 
while the person was sleeping or at rest. This 
observation raises questions about the efficacy 
of limiting physical activity as a means of reduc-
ing the risk of sudden death among children and 
young adults, as is sometimes recommended for 
competitive athletes. Death during sleep may be 
caused by bursts of vagal and sympathetic activ-
ity during rapid-eye-movement sleep that lead to 
adrenergically triggered arrhythmias, although 
nonadrenergic mechanisms may also be involved. 
Therefore, strategies to prevent sudden cardiac 
death among children and young adults should 
also focus on gaining a better understanding of 
the mechanisms associated with death that oc-
curs while a person is sleeping or at rest.
The likelihood that a case of unexplained sud-
den cardiac death was caused by an underlying 
inherited disorder has led to the emerging role 
of genetic testing of DNA obtained at autopsy 
(i.e., molecular autopsy).5,34 Establishing a clear 
genetic diagnosis in cases of unexplained sud-
den cardiac death has major implications for the 
identification of at-risk relatives, the initiation of 
strategies to prevent sudden death, and guidance 
with respect to reproductive options. In the cur-
rent study, the diagnostic yield of 9% that was 
found for the four molecular autopsy genes is 
consistent with that found in unselected cohorts 
in previous studies (9 to 11%).16,17 In retrospec-
tive studies of unexplained sudden cardiac death 
in selected populations, there was a higher diag-
nostic yield (>20%), which may represent ascer-
tainment and referral bias.14,15 We recently report-
ed the genetic findings in 61 cases of sudden 
unexplained death in epilepsy; we found patho-
genic or probably pathogenic variants in the three 
common genes for the long-QT syndrome in 7% 
of the cases and in epilepsy genes in 25% of the 
cases.35 In contrast, in the current study involv-
ing persons who had no history of epilepsy, we 
found only 4 cases of unexplained sudden car-
diac death (6%) in which the person had proba-
ble pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes, which 
suggests that undiagnosed genetic epilepsy is un-
common in cases of unexplained sudden cardiac 
death.
In the current study, in the clinical follow-up 
of families in which an unexplained sudden car-
diac death occurred, 12 of the families (13%) 
had a definite clinical diagnosis established in a 
first-degree relative; inherited cardiomyopathies 
were identified in five of these families. This 
diagnostic yield from clinical follow-up was less 
than what had been reported previously
7,36 and 
probably reflects the population-based nature of 
our study, as compared with retrospective, ter-
tiary center–based studies. A thorough clinical 
evaluation of surviving at-risk family members is 
nonetheless strongly recommended and may be 
supplemented by a molecular autopsy.4,6,37,38
Our study has several limitations. First, al-
though every available national resource was used 
to identify cases of sudden cardiac death over 
the 3-year study period, some cases were not 
considered because our study did not include 
cases that had insufficient details to determine 
with certainty whether the death was sudden, 
and cases in which the body was found more 
than 24 hours after the person was last seen 
alive were not included. Second, various meth-
odologic approaches to genetic analysis were 
used during the study, which reflects the rapid 
escalation in genetic technologies over the course 
of the study. Finally, the scope of the current 
study did not include cases of successfully resus-
citated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
In conclusion, in this prospective, population-
based, binational study, we found an annual in-
cidence of sudden cardiac death of 1.3 cases per 
100,000 persons 1 to 35 years of age. Unex-
plained sudden cardiac death accounted for 40% 
of the cases. Among the cases of unexplained 
sudden cardiac death in which genetic testing 
was performed, a likely cause of death was iden-
tified in 27%. Autopsy investigation combined 
with genetic testing and family screening was 
associated with a substantially higher likelihood 
of identifying a possible cause of death among 
children and young adults who had a sudden car-
diac death than was autopsy investigation alone.
