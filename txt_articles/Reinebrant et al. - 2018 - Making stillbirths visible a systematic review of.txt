Background Stillbirth is a global health problem. The World
Health Organization (WHO) application of the International
Classification of Diseases for perinatal mortality (ICD-PM) aims
to improve data on stillbirth to enable prevention.
Objectives To identify globally reported causes of stillbirth,
classification systems, and alignment with the ICD-PM.
Search strategy We searched CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, Global
Health, and Pubmed from 2009 to 2016.
Selection criteria Reports of stillbirth causes in unselective
cohorts.
Data collection and analysis Pooled estimates of causes were
derived for country representative reports. Systems and causes
were assessed for alignment with the ICD-PM. Data are presented
by income setting (low, middle, and high income countries; LIC,
MIC, HIC).
Main results Eighty-five reports from 50 countries (489 089
stillbirths) were included. The most frequent categories were
Unexplained, Antepartum haemorrhage, and Other (all settings);
Infection and Hypoxic peripartum (LIC), and Placental (MIC,
HIC). Overall report quality was low. Only one classification
system fully aligned with ICD-PM. All stillbirth causes mapped
to ICD-PM. In a subset from HIC, mapping obscured major
causes.
Conclusions There is a paucity of quality information on
causes of stillbirth globally. Improving investigation of
stillbirths and standardisation of audit and classification is
urgently needed and should be achievable in all well-resourced

Plain Language Summary
Background and methods
Nearly three million babies are stillborn every year. These deaths have deep and long-lasting effects on parents, healthcare providers,
and the society. One of the major challenges to preventing stillbirths is the lack of information about why they happen. In this study,
we collected reports on the causes of stillbirth from high-, middle-, and low-income countries to: (1) Understand the causes of
stillbirth, and (2) Understand how to improve reporting of stillbirths.
Findings
We found 85 reports from 50 different countries. The information available from the reports was inconsistent and often of poor
quality, so it was hard to get a clear picture about what are the causes of stillbirth across the world. Many different definitions of
stillbirth were used. There was also wide variation in what investigations of the mother and baby were undertaken to identify the cause
of stillbirth. Stillbirths in all income settings (low-, middle-, and high-income countries) were most frequently reported as
Unexplained, Other, and Haemorrhage (bleeding). Unexplained and Other are not helpful in understanding why a baby was stillborn. In
low-income countries, stillbirths were often attributed to Infection and Complications during labour and birth. In middle- and high-
income countries, stillbirths were often reported as Placental complications.
Limitations
We may have missed some reports as searches were carried out in English only. The available reports were of poor quality.
Implications
Many countries, particularly those where the majority of stillbirths occur, do not report any information about these deaths. Where
there are reports, the quality is often poor. It is important to improve the investigation and reporting of stillbirth using a standardised
system so that policy makers and healthcare workers can develop effective stillbirth prevention programs. All stillbirths should be
investigated and reported in line with the World Health Organization standards.

stillbirth. BJOG 2018;125:212–224.
Introduction
The global stillbirth rate (≥28 completed weeks’ gestation)
is estimated to be 18.4 per 1000 births,1 or around 2.6 mil-
lion stillbirths each year.1 The World Health Organization’s
(WHO’s) Every Newborn: An Action Plan To End Preventa-
ble Deaths aims to reduce the stillbirth rate to 12 or fewer
per 1000 births by 2030 in every country, and for countries
already meeting this target to reduce equity gaps.2 How-
ever, with an estimated annual reduction rate of 2.0%
between 2000 and 2015,1 half that for neonatal deaths, pro-
gress has been slow. Identifying interventions to achieve
such a target would be facilitated by cross-country and
inter-country comparisons of the causes of stillbirth. More-
over, while national neonatal causes of death are regularly
published through the United Nations,1,3 there is currently
no systematic global reporting of causes of stillbirth. The
WHO recommends use of the International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)4
for
classification
of
perinatal
deaths
for
international
reporting.5 However, limitations in ICD for classifying still-
births6 has resulted in numerous disparate systems cur-
rently being in use,7 thus limiting global comparisons. In
2016, WHO released ICD Perinatal Mortality (ICD-PM) as
part of the WHO Perinatal Mortality Audit and Review
guide.8 The ICD-PM is an application of ICD and holds
promise as an important step in improving global and local
reporting of causes of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.9 At a
minimum, the ICD-PM aims to collect timing of death
and clinically defined causes and associated conditions.

Global reporting of causes of stillbirth
 Objectives
Following on the introduction of the ICD-PM, we aimed to
identify globally reported causes of stillbirth in order to sup-
port progress toward the stillbirth rate target in the WHO’s
Every Newborn action plan. The specific objectives were to:
1 describe the current status of global reporting of still-
birth causes, including reported causes and classification
systems used
2 pool results from country representative reports to iden-
tify commonly reported causes of stillbirth, stratified by
income setting (high-, middle-, and low-income)
3 assess alignment of systems used and reported causes of
stillbirths with the ICD-PM for country representative
reports.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted and reported accord-
ing to the PRISMA checklist.10 The protocol has not been
published. Two authors independently undertook screening
of reports, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment.
Eligibility criteria
All published and unpublished cohort and cross-sectional
reports from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2016 that
presented causes of stillbirth were eligible. Reports were
excluded if they: included non-consecutive or selected sub-
groups, e.g. preterm; aimed only to identify risk factors or
did not provide data on causes in an extractable format
(for complete study selection, see Figure S1).
Information sources
We searched PubMed, Global Health, Cinahl, Medline, and
Embase
with
no
language
restrictions.
We
identified
national reports through web-based systematic searches
(Appendix S1) and cross-referenced included reports.
Study selection
Titles and abstracts of identified reports were screened for eli-
gibility; full text papers were retrieved if potentially eligible or
if eligibility could not readily be determined from the abstract.
All reports presenting causes of stillbirth were included to
address Objective 1. To address Objectives 2 and 3, the most
recent national reports for each country were selected. If a
national report was unavailable, a report was selected on
the following criteria (in descending order): (1) population-
based report with the largest number of stillbirths; (2) multi-
centre health facility report covering the largest population.
Data extraction
A purpose-built data extraction form was used. For details
on data items and definitions used, see Appendix S2.
Grouping reported stillbirth causes
The development of categories and mapping of reported
causes of stillbirth to those categories were undertaken by a
panel including maternal fetal medicine specialists (GG, BS,
DE), a pathologist (RL), and an epidemiologist (VF), with
guidance from The Amsterdam Classification Workshop11
members. Categories were created by ‘clustering’ reported
causes into 15 clinically meaningful groups for stillbirth
prevention (‘global categories’) (Table S1). With the addi-
tion of ‘Placental conditions’, these categories generally
coincided with previously suggested major causal groupings
by Lawn et al.12 We did not attempt to differentiate causes
from associated conditions (Table S1).
Quality assessment
Quality

of

representative
reports
included in the pooled analysis of reported causes was per-
formed using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Insti-
tute
Critical
Appraisal
Checklist
for
Studies
Reporting
Prevalence Data13 (Appendix S3). An overall quality rating
was derived for each report (low, medium, or high quality).
For
subgroup
analyses
of
‘good’
quality
reports,
we
combined data from reports assessed as high and medium
quality.
Data presentation and analysis
Data were presented by income setting using World Bank
groupings14 of low and lower-middle [LIC; Gross National
Income (GNI) ≤$3,955], upper-middle (MIC; GNI $3,956–
$12,235), and high (HIC; GNI ≥$12,236). Categories of
stillbirth causes were presented as proportions of the total
number of stillbirths classified. Results from country repre-
sentative reports were statistically pooled to identify com-
monly reported causes stratified by country groupings.
Analyses were done in R using the meta package15 with
95% prediction intervals (PI)16–18 (Appendix S4). Subgroup
analyses by report quality and type of system (ICD versus
clinical classification systems) were planned a priori. See
Appendix S2 for definition of clinical classification systems7
and criteria for alignment of classification systems with
ICD-PM.
Each reported cause was mapped to the relevant ICD-
PM major category. The ICD-PM includes five major
maternal condition categories (M1–5) and 13 fetal cate-
gories, six with antepartum timing (A1–6) and seven with
intrapartum timing (I1–7).5 For the Unknown (U) timing
category, we included the categories: U1, Congenital mal-
formations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities;
U2, Infection; U3, Other specified disorder; U4, Disorders
related to fetal growth; U5, Death of unspecified cause. We
added one category, ‘Other’, to all timings to accommodate
the causes without ICD-PM coding.

Reinebrant et al.
 We calculated the proportions of stillbirths that could be
mapped to a fetal cause and/or a maternal condition in
ICD-PM. Mapping of data from good quality HIC reports
to ICD-PM was compared descriptively with the 15 global
categories.
Results
Of the 7415 abstracts screened for eligibility, 909 full-text
papers were reviewed for inclusion and 824 records were
excluded because: they did not discuss stillbirth (396);
they contained no extractable data (217); they dealt only
with sub-populations (145); or they included risk factors
only (12) (for complete study selection, see Figure S1).
Eighty-five reports (LIC 28, MIC 20, HIC 37) covering a
total of 489 089 stillbirths were included in the review
(LIC 13 197, MIC 431 216, HIC 44 676). Thirty-three
country representative reports classifying 454 533 still-
births were included in the pooled analysis of causes and
mapping to ICD-PM.
Global stillbirth reporting
Description of included reports
The 85 included reports originated from 50 countries.
Reports were published in English (66) and other languages
(19; Table S2). Eleven reports excluded terminations of
pregnancy. Half of the reports (including 2.4% of all still-
births) were from hospital settings (LIC, 19 reports/7419
stillbirths; MIC, 8 reports/1134 stillbirths; HIC, 16 reports/
3240 stillbirths) (Table 1; for full details, see Table S2).
Definitions of stillbirth
Stillbirth was defined in 71 reports (84%) using 34 discrete
definitions (Figure S2). The majority of HIC reports (78%)
used a lower gestational age limit of 20–24 weeks, while the
majority of LIC reports (68%) used 28 weeks (Table 1).
Data available to classifiers
Systematic prospective perinatal mortality audits were used
in 21 reports (LIC 2, MIC 4, HIC 15), of which 12 were

 hospital audits; seven used comprehensive investigation pro-
tocols (all from HIC) (Table S2). In 40 reports, retrospective
audit data were used; 18 of these (LIC 2, MIC 6, HIC 10)
sourced causes from Civil Registration and Vital Statistics
(CRVS). Sixteen reports (LIC 13, MIC 3) were prospective
studies; eight of these, all from LIC, used verbal autopsy.
Reported autopsy rates in 20 reports [MIC 3 (14%), HIC 17
(47%)] ranged from 2.7 to 100%. In over half of the reports
(55%) it was unclear whether autopsy had been performed.
Placental pathology examination rates were included in 15
reports (18%) (none in LIC), with rates ranging from 22 to
100%. For full details on data available, see Table S2.
Classification systems
Twenty-one clinical classification systems19–39 were used in 41
of the 85 reports (LIC, 15 reports covering 30% of stillbirths;
MIC, 6 reports covering 5% of stillbirths; HIC, 20 reports cov-
ering 27% of stillbirths). The ICD was used more frequently
in HIC (14 reports covering 72% of stillbirths) and MIC (7
reports covering 94% of stillbirths) than LIC (3 reports cover-
ing 2% of stillbirths) (Table 1). The remaining 20 reports
listed causes of death without reference to any classification
system. Areas of origin for the 21 clinical systems are shown in
Table S3. Three-quarters of the systems allow a single primary
cause of death, and half the systems allow associated factors to
be recorded (Table S4). Five systems provide comprehensive
definitions of causes,21,28,31–33 and 13 systems provide rules
for assigning cause of death (See Table S4 for full details on
clinical classification systems).
Globally reported categories of stillbirth
The 85 included reports presented causes of stillbirth using 860
unique terms. These were grouped into 15 global categories and
46 minor categories, of which eight major categories were com-
mon to over half (53%) of the reports (Table S5).
Congenital anomalies was the most frequently reported
category, included in 93% of all reports. The proportion of
stillbirths assigned to this category ranged from 1.4% in
Nigeria40 to 64.4% in China41 (Figure 1, Table S5). The
second category was Unexplained, included in 82% of all
reports, ranging from 0.3% in Turkey26 to 82.0% in
Japan.42 Maternal conditions were included in 64% of all
reports, with frequencies ranging from 0.6% in Ireland43 to
36.5% in Italy29 (Figure 1, Table S5).
The proportions of categories also differed across type of
classification system. The most commonly categories for
reports using the ICD included Other unspecified condition
(68% of reports) and Hypoxic peripartum death (64%),
whereas for clinical systems these included Antepartum
haemorrhage (72%) and Infection (67%).
Country representative reports
Description of included reports
Thirty-three reports classifying 454 533 stillbirths were
included in the pooled analysis: seven LIC (5629 still-
births), 11 MIC (429 666 stillbirths), and 15 HIC (19 238
stillbirths). Twenty-one reports included ≥95% of total
stillbirths in the country during the reporting period, one
report included 72%, three included 6–49%, and eight
included ≤5% (Figure S3). In two reports (6%), termina-
tions of pregnancy were excluded, and in 21 (64%), no ref-
erence was made to terminations. The ICD was used
mainly in HIC and MIC reports (60 and 64%, respectively,
versus 14% of LIC reports; Table 1, Table S2).
Quality assessment identified 13 good-quality reports (29%
of all LIC reports, 36% of all MIC reports, 47% of all HIC
reports); only one of these was high-quality.44 The remaining
reports were assessed as low-quality (Table S6, Figure S4).
Pooled estimates of commonly reported causes of stillbirths
The top five categories by frequency for each country grouping
are shown in Figure 2. Unexplained was the top category across
all settings, with pooled estimates ranging from 31.2 to 43.7%
(Tables S7 and S8). Two additional categories were amongst
the top five across all settings: Other unspecified conditions (9.3–
11.6%) and Antepartum haemorrhage (8.4–9.3%; Tables S7, S9
and S10). In LIC, Infection (15.8%) and Hypoxic peripartum
death (11.6%; Tables S7, S11 and S12) were also amongst the
top five. In both HIC and MIC settings, Placental conditions
(14.4 and 13.7%, respectively) ranked in the top five, with Con-
genital anomalies as the remaining category in HIC (14.0%)
and Specific fetal/pregnancy pathology in MIC (11.0%) (Tables
S7, S13–S15).
Details of pooled analyses of Umbilical cord complica-
tions, Maternal conditions, Spontaneous preterm, Hyperten-
sion, Fetal growth restriction and Terminations are presented

was only possible for HIC. The proportion of Unexplained

Global reporting of causes of stillbirth
 (15.4% versus 31.6%) and Other unspecified conditions (1.6% ver-
sus 9.3%) was lower in good quality reports versus all reports
(Tables S8 and S9). Subgroup analyses by system type showed
higher proportions of Antepartum haemorrhage using clinical
systems (14.1%) than using ICD (4.4%) in MIC (Table S10).

 Alignment with the ICD-PM
Alignment of clinical classification systems with the ICD-
PM
Of the 21 classification systems used, only Codac20 was fully
aligned with the ICD-PM. Four systems met two of the three
criteria used to assess alignment, and 14 systems scored 0.5–
1.5 out of a maximum of 3 (Table S3, Figure S5).
Mapping of reported causes to ICD-PM
Nearly all the 454 533 stillbirths reported in the 33 country
representative reports were mapped to an ICD-PM fetal or
maternal category, or both. Causes for 831 stillbirths
(0.2%) mapped to ICD-PM neonatal rather than fetal
codes (for example, ‘neonatal aspiration syndrome’). There
were 264 480 stillbirths (58%) mapped to a fetal but not a
maternal ICD-PM cause, and 140 319 (31%) to a maternal
but not a fetal ICD-PM cause; 49 734 stillbirths (11%)
were mapped to both (Tables S22 and S23).
Of the 204 545 stillbirths in the global category Unexplained,
113 558 (56%) were mapped to the ICD-PM category
Unknown timing unspecified (no maternal condition), 90 335
(44%) to Antepartum hypoxia (no maternal condition), 602
(0.3%) to Antepartum unspecified (no maternal condition), and
50 (0.02%) to maternal condition Other complications of labour
and delivery (no fetal cause) (Tables S22 and S23).
The global causes from the best available data (good
quality reports using clinical classification systems in HIC:
five reports, 6194 stillbirths) were mapped to ICD-PM. The
global categories reflecting underlying placental causes of
Antepartum haemorrhage and Placental condition (insuffi-
ciency) accounted for 20%, and Intrauterine growth restric-
tion for 7% of stillbirths (Figure 3). When mapped to the
ICD-PM, these global categories are included within the
major maternal category Complications of Placenta, cord,
and membranes and the fetal category Disorders related to
fetal growth, accounting for 30 and 17% of stillbirths,
respectively (Figure 3).
Discussion

Global reporting of causes of stillbirth
 reports. Despite this overarching commonality, we found
wide variation in frequency of stillbirth categories and in
the systems used to classify them, with generally poor-qual-
ity data. Underlining one of the key challenges of achieving
the Every Newborn action plan stillbirth target are the high
proportions of stillbirths in all income settings recorded
without information to guide prevention (Unexplained and
Other unspecified conditions).
Strengths and limitations
We sought to include the most detailed causes of still-
birth available to allow identification of common group-
ings, and ultimately to enable consistent reporting across
settings. In line with WHO recommendations4,5 and to
maximize the utility of the data for prevention strategies,
we excluded reports that assigned more than one cause
of stillbirth and excluded all those reported as associated
only. This may have resulted in a loss of information
and limited our ability to assess the full value of the
ICD-PM, which aims to record both a fetal and a mater-
nal condition for every stillbirth. The need to assign mul-
tiple causes for some stillbirths has been highlighted.
Further, the distinction between causes and associated
conditions is often poorly defined,27 and in this review,
many reported ‘causes’ are not recognised as causal con-
ditions.
Further,
although
we
imposed
no
language
restrictions, we may have missed some reports by using
English-language search terms.
Interpretation
Data quality
Data quality was generally poor, with only a small number of
reports based on high-quality perinatal mortality audit. Fur-
ther, many reports did not provide sufficient detail to ade-
quately assess quality. As in other publications,1,6,45 we found
global comparisons problematic because of differing defini-
tions and systems. The inability to identify terminations of
pregnancies in reporting of stillbirth causes is problematic:
many are terminated as a consequence of congenital anoma-
lies,46 some of which may not have resulted in stillbirth.
Global causes of stillbirth
Results of the pooled analysis enabled comparisons of still-
birth causes across settings, providing additional evidence
for key areas for prevention. The relatively high proportion
of stillbirths attributed to intrapartum hypoxia (Hypoxic
peripartum) in LIC versus HIC and MIC is in line with
recent evidence from low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC)47,48 and confirms the urgency of improving care
during labour and birth, when half of all global stillbirths
occur.1,3,47,49 Further, as in other reports,47,48 we identified
infection as a top cause of stillbirths in LIC, confirming the
importance of infection prevention and management.3,49,50
Our findings clearly highlight the importance of placental
conditions as a major contributor to stillbirths in all set-
tings, consistent with other recent studies.47,51 However,
many placental conditions were ill-defined and the causal
links unclear (for instance delayed villous maturation).52,53
Many conditions that lead to stillbirth are also linked to
neonatal deaths, and both must therefore be accommo-
dated within a single system to ensure optimal pregnancy
care and outcomes.54
ICD-PM and progress towards global reporting
We confirmed findings of other studies, showing numerous
disparate systems for classification of stillbirths are in use
globally,6,45,55 further highlighting the need for a globally
effective classification system. A recent consensus described
user-identified characteristics for such a system,56 but no
existing systems meet these characteristics.57 Further, robust
evaluation of system performance is limited.7 The ICD-PM
is the first system intended for global use in classification of
perinatal deaths,5,58–60 aiming to facilitate comparisons by
improving perinatal mortality data, particularly in high-bur-
den settings. While evaluation of the performance of ICD-
PM is currently limited, retrospective application to datasets
in the UK and South Africa highlighted its values and pro-
vided insights to future improvements.59 In our dataset, all
causes of stillbirths reported globally could be accommo-
dated within the ICD-PM. However, our mapping of causes
from good quality reports in HIC using clinical classification
systems highlights that classification system requirements
differ across settings. Meeting the needs of diverse settings is
essential for global comparisons to identify important varia-
tion and inform programmatic change to reduce deaths.
The WHO publication Making Every Baby Count,8 a peri-
natal mortality audit and review guide, provides a tool to ini-
tialize audits in low-income settings using the ICD-PM for
classifying perinatal deaths. The ICD-PM maps ICD-10
codes to an underlying fetal cause of antepartum, intra-
partum, or unknown timing, and a maternal condition; thus,
data collection must include timing as well as a fetal and a
maternal condition. While this approach aims to capture
information on stillbirths from low resource settings (either
cause and/or associated conditions), the ICD-PM faces chal-
lenges owing to its ICD-10 provenance, including insufficient
differentiation of causes from associated conditions, and
insufficient detail on maternal conditions.9 Conditions noted
as maternal in the ICD-PM include not only fetal underlying
causes (Placenta, cord, and membranes), but also maternal
causes (Maternal complications of pregnancy) and maternal
associated conditions (Maternal medical and surgical condi-
tions). Further, one-fifth of stillbirths in the global category
Unexplained mapped to ICD-PM Antepartum asphyxia. Clas-
sifying associated conditions is important, particularly in
220

 data-poor settings where assigning causes may be difficult.
However, confusing causes from associated conditions or
mechanisms of death (antepartum asphyxia), while reducing
the number of Unexplained cases, may obscure key areas for
prevention. The WHO is currently working towards ICD-11,
which provides an opportunity to alleviate some of these
issues.61
Differences in proportions of causal categories across
countries
were
likely
due
to
different
classification
approaches. Codac20 was the only non-ICD system fully
aligned with the ICD-PM. Although Codac has previously
been shown to be the best-performing system,45 the majority
of
stillbirths
classified
using
Codac
were
mapped
to
unknown timing and cause within the ICD-PM (data not
shown). Codac also resulted in a high proportion of Unex-
plained stillbirths, potentially influenced by the categories
included. Moreover, this system was only aligned with nine
of the 17 user-identified characteristics for an effective global
system. Future enhancements to global classification of still-
births need to incorporate user-identified characteristics for
an effective global system. Further, optimisation of informa-
tion from data-rich settings to incorporate recent advances
in stillbirth aetiology such as the consensus on placental
pathology53 and other detailed laboratory investigations will
serve to advance prevention of stillbirths globally. Implemen-
tation of any system must also be accompanied by appropri-
ate training to ensure high-quality data.
Conclusion
To achieve the Every Newborn action plan global stillbirth
rate target, priorities are improving the care of women in
labour and giving birth, preventing and treating infections,
and improving the quality of data on causes to drive change.
Implementation of ICD-PM as part of the WHO Perinatal
Mortality Audit and Review guide8 would be a major step for-
ward. While the ICD-PM captures data from high-burden
settings by allowing for a minimum of timing and clinically
defined causes and associated conditions, a global system
must also accommodate the needs of data-rich settings to
enable global comparisons. Clearly ascertaining underlying
causes, separating them from associated conditions, and
enabling capture of more detailed information in data-rich
settings will fully harness the ICD-PM’s potential for global
reporting and prevention of stillbirths. Further research is
needed to improve the classification of placental causes of
stillbirths. Enhancements to global classification of stillbirths
and neonatal deaths must be based on comprehensive testing
across diverse settings.
