Background. There is conflicting evidence on the association between sagittal neck
posture and neck pain.
Objective. The purposes of this study were: (1) to determine the existence of clusters of
neck posture in a cohort of 17-year-olds and (2) to establish whether identified subgroups were
associated with biopsychosocial factors and neck pain.
Design. This was a cross-sectional study.
Methods. The adolescents (N�1,108) underwent 2-dimensional photographic postural
assessment in a sitting position. One distance and 4 angular measurements of the head, neck,
and thorax were calculated from photo-reflective markers placed on bony landmarks. Sub-
groups of sagittal sitting neck posture were determined by cluster analysis. Height and weight
were measured, and lifestyle and psychological factors, neck pain, and headache were assessed
by questionnaire. The associations among posture subgroups, neck pain, and other factors
were evaluated using logistic regression.
Results. Four distinct clusters of sitting neck posture were identified: upright, intermediate,
slumped thorax/forward head, and erect thorax/forward head. Significant associations
between cluster and sex, weight, and height were found. Participants classified as having
slumped thorax/forward head posture were at higher odds of mild, moderate, or severe
depression. Participants classified as having upright posture exercised more frequently. There
was no significant difference in the odds of neck pain or headache across the clusters.
Limitations. The results are specific to 17-year-olds and may not be applicable to adults.
Conclusion. Meaningful sagittal sitting neck posture clusters were identified in 17-year-
olds who demonstrated some differences with biopsychosocial profiling. The finding of no
association between cluster membership and neck pain and headaches challenges widely held
beliefs about the role of posture in adolescent neck pain.

 N
eck pain is the fourth most com-
mon health disorder for years
lived with disability internation-
ally.1
Worldwide,
the
percentage
of
health care resources spent on neck pain
are rapidly increasing.2 Neck pain is
reported in childhood3 and rises in prev-
alence throughout adolescence.4–7 By 18
years of age, neck pain prevalence is
equivalent to adult levels.5 Neck pain dis-
orders are more common in females4,7–10
and have been associated with many dif-
ferent biopsychosocial factors. Associ-
ated
anthropometric
factors
include
small or tall height.11 Lifestyle factors
include increased computer use12 and
increased time spent sitting.13 Psycho-
logical
factors
include
depression,14
poor mental health,10,15 and stress and
psychological distress.10,15 Other factors
are
comorbid
pain
sites
(eg,
back
pain),7,10,15 ill health,7,15 and physical
factors such as reduced muscle endur-
ance16 and altered spinal posture.17–22
Neck posture, particularly in a sitting
position, is considered an important con-
tributing factor to the development and
persistence
of
neck
pain18–23
and
headaches.24 Consistent with this fact,
neck posture is commonly targeted by
clinicians to prevent and reduce neck
pain. Sagittal neck posture in a sitting
position has been investigated previously
due to a common clinical belief that a
more
forward
head
posture
(FHP)
(where the head is anterior to the trunk
in the sagittal plane)19,25 is associated
with neck pain and headaches.26 For-
ward head posture may increase load on
passive cervical structures (joints, liga-
ments)25,27 and on the posterior neck
musculature by the increased gravita-
tional moment28,29 and torque around
C7.30 This increased load is manifest by
increased extensor muscle activity dem-
onstrated in FHP.31,32
Although these mechanisms are plausi-
ble, the link between neck posture and
neck
pain
is
unclear.33
Some
stud-
ies18,20,21,34 have shown an association
between neck posture and neck pain,
whereas other studies23,35–39 have not.
Factors contributing to the discordant
findings include use of different angular
or translational posture variables, inclu-
sion or exclusion of thoracic measures
and upper cervical spine measures/head
tilt, whether the neck posture was
assessed in a sitting or standing position,
the task during which posture was
assessed, definitions of neck pain, sam-
ple size, and demographics. These meth-
odological differences make direct com-
parisons between studies difficult.
Another potential reason for the dispar-
ity in the literature in determining the
association between posture and neck
pain could be the existence of neck pos-
ture subgroups. Subgroups of sagittal
lumbar spine standing posture have been
identified using sagittal photography in
an adolescent population40 and sagittal
radiographs in adults.41 In adolescents,
individuals with “nonneutral” standing
lumbar posture had higher odds for back
pain.40 In adults, nonneutral postures
were more commonly associated with
symptomatic back pain or degenerative
disease.41
Cluster
modeling
appears
highly suited to the examination of pos-
ture subgroups,40 but this approach has
not been applied to investigate associa-
tions between sagittal neck posture and
neck pain.
The literature supports the supposition
of subgroups of sitting neck posture. For-
ward head posture can occur via a com-
bination of upper thoracic flexion and
cervical spine flexion.25,42 Two versions
of FHP have been described, one with
and one without extension of the upper
cervical spine.43 Alternatively, FHP may
exist
in
moderate
and
extreme
forms.25,43 Another possible subgroup
could be the opposite extreme of FHP, a
very upright position with the head held
close to the vertical axis.34 Although
there is a lack of consensus as to what
constitutes “neutral” neck posture,44 it is
likely that this fourth subgroup exists,
between the 2 posture extremes. Thus,
the first aim of this study was to deter-
mine whether sagittal sitting neck pos-
ture
subgroups
that
correspond
to
potential variants described in the litera-
ture could be identified with cluster
modeling in late adolescence. The sec-
ond aim was to profile identified posture
clusters based on factors potentially asso-
ciated with sitting posture (sex, anthro-
pometrics, lifestyle, psychological fac-
tors). The final aim was to investigate the
association between identified neck pos-
ture clusters and neck pain and head-
aches. Significant insight into the poten-
tial association between neck posture
and neck pain could be achieved by
applying cluster analysis to neck posture
data.
Method
Study Design
This was a cross-sectional study in the
Western
Australia
Pregnancy
Cohort
(Raine) study (http://www.rainestudy.
org.au).
Participants
The Raine study commenced in 1989,
with 2,868 children born to 2,804 moth-
ers. Ethnicity was predominantly Cauca-
sian. At 17 years of age, demographic
characteristics of the participating fami-
lies were similar to the Western Austra-
lian population for families with 15- to
17-year-old children, except for a lower
proportion of rural-dwelling families and
a higher proportion of families dwelling
in high socioeconomic areas.45
The 17-year-old cohort follow-up took
place between June 2006 and December
2009. Participants (average age�17.0,
SD�0.2) completed a questionnaire that
included a description of neck pain and
headache and a variety of psychosocial
domains. Participants underwent physi-
cal testing for height, weight, and pho-
tographic sagittal posture assessment.
Consent
was
obtained
from
the
participants.
Measures
Postural assessment.
Postural assess-
ment methods were the same as those
used in a prior reliability study that dem-
onstrated reliability and practicality of
use in large-scale studies of adolescent
posture.46
For
consistency,
photo-
graphic reflective markers were placed
on bony landmarks on the participant’s
right side. Landmarks utilized were the
outer canthus, tragus, and C7 and T12
spinous processes. A 25-cm plumb line
was hung from the stool to calibrate dis-
tance and determine vertical. An Olym-
pus camera (Olympus FE-130, Tokyo,
Japan) was placed on a tripod 80 cm
from the floor and 250 cm perpendicular
to the participant. Right-sided lateral

 photographs were taken as participants
sat on a stool with thighs horizontal and
knees flexed to 90 degrees. The standard-
ized instructions used to position the
participants in order to obtain the usual
posture of the head and neck were the
same as those used in a previously
reported reliability study.46 Participants
were instructed to “put your hands about
two-thirds of the way down your thighs
with the palms up, sit like normal and
relax, and look straight ahead.” Markers
were digitized using Peak Motus motion
analysis system version 8 software (Peak
Performance Technologies Inc, Centen-
nial, Colorado). Measures (Figure) were
selected to best represent the attributes
of sagittal posture that relate to the pro-
posed mechanism for neck pain25 and
the components of posture routinely
assessed in clinical practice.47
Interrater reliability has been reported as
fair to good for these posture variables.46
The reliability of intrarater redigitization
for all distance and angular measures
used in this study were found to be
excellent in this cohort at age 14 years.46
Radiographic examination is considered
the gold standard for postural measure-
ment.48
However,
its
disadvantages
include exposure of individuals to ioniz-
ing radiation and high cost, making it
unsuitable for use in large population
studies. Photographs, although not as
accurate
as
radiographs,
can
detect
meaningful
classifications
of
lumbar
spine posture that correspond to x-ray
classifications,40 and their use is sup-
ported in large population studies.46
Anthropometrics.
Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated from height and
weight
measures
using
standard
procedures.
Lifestyle factors.
For physical activity
participants
were
asked:
“Outside
school, Technical and Further Education
(TAFE), or work hours, how often do you
usually exercise in your free time, so
much that you get out of breath or sweat
(once a month or less/once a week/2–3
times a week/4–6 times a week/every
day)?” A binary variable was made to
separate those participants who exer-
cised once a week or less from those
who exercised more frequently than
once a week. For sedentary behavior,
participants were asked about their com-
puter use and time spent sitting. For
computer use, they were asked: “On
average, how many hours per day do you
usually use a computer (eg for school/
work, games, Internet) on a weekday
(not at all/less than 1 hour/about 1–2
hours/about 2–4 hours/more than 4
hours)?” A binary variable was used to
split those participants with low or no
use (�5 hours per week on a weekday)
from those using a computer more reg-
ularly. Time spent sitting was taken from
each participant’s response to the ques-
tion “During the last 7 days, how much
time did you spend sitting on a weekday
(weekend day)?” on the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).49
From these responses, a weighted sum
variable
was
calculated
representing
total hours sitting per week.
Psychological
factors.
Depressed
mood was assessed using the 20-item
Beck Depression Inventory for Youth
(BDI-Y).50 Participants were asked to rate

 the frequency of their symptoms over
the preceding 2 weeks on a scale of 0
(never) to 3 (always). Responses were
summed to produce a total score ranging
from 0 to 60. The BDI-Y has good reli-
ability.50 Scores were categorized into a
binary variable of “no or minimal depres-
sion” versus “mild, moderate, or severe
depression.”51
Neck pain and headache.
Partici-
pants were asked to look at a picture
depicting neck pain as pain in the neck
and upper trapezius muscle region and
to answer the follow questions: (1)
“Have you ever had neck/shoulder pain
(yes or no)?” (2) “Has your neck/shoul-
der pain lasted more than 3 months con-
tinuously (it hurt more or less every day)
(yes or no)?” (3) “Has your neck/shoul-
der pain ever lasted for more than 3
months off and on (it hurt at least once a
week, but not every day) (yes or no)?”
and (4) “Has sitting ever made your
neck/shoulder pain worse (yes or no)?”
These questions were adapted from the
Nordic questionnaire, which has estab-
lished validity and reliability.52 Positive
responses to the first 3 questions were
converted to a new variable (ie, presence
of persistent neck pain) to examine neck
pain of recurrent and prolonged nature.
For headaches, participants were asked,
“Do you have now, or have you had in
the past, any of the following health pro-
fessional–diagnosed medical conditions
or health problems: migraine or severe
headache (yes or no)?”
Data Analysis
Initial data screening was conducted
using boxplots and identified 20 outliers
(values 1.5 times the interquartile range).
Of these outliers, 4 participants’ photo-
graphs were unusable due to quality
issues. For the remaining 16 outliers, an
error was found in the digitization of 2
markers used to form the distance cali-
bration. This error meant that when the
data was used to normalize the scale
from those participants, the distance
measure (ie, head displacement) was
incorrect. To correct the digitization of
the markers on the distance calibration
device, a correct scaling factor was
applied to head displacement measures.
Prior to clustering, the correlation matrix
was examined to identify unduly high
correlations between posture variables
that might result in overrepresentation in
the cluster solutions.53 A 2-step cluster
analysis was performed using standard-
ized (z scores) posture measures. A hier-
archical technique, Ward’s linkage, was
used to derive the number of clusters
and their cluster centers, followed by the
nonhierarchical, iterative technique of
K-means cluster analysis using the cluster
seeds generated from the Ward’s linkage
solution.
Validity of the cluster solution was
assessed in 3 ways. First, it is recom-
mended that the determination of an
optimal cluster solution be performed in
conjunction with consideration for the
interpretability and theoretical meaning
of the generated clusters.53 Determina-
tion of the number of clusters to be esti-
mated was guided by prior literature
regarding subgroups of neck posture and
the degree to which estimated sub-
groups
corresponded
to
these
sub-
groups. As prior literature suggested that
there may be, in addition to a “neutral”
head posture, 2 different FHPs (with and
without
upward
head
tilt),25,42
a
3-cluster solution was estimated. Addi-
tionally, given the potential of a very
upright posture,34 a 4-cluster solution
was estimated. Clusters from 3- and
4-cluster solutions were compared with
posture subgroups previously described
in the literature, and photographs of indi-
viduals with values near the centroid of
the clusters were examined to interpret
their potential clinical relevance. Sec-
ond, split-half sampling of the final
4-cluster solution was conducted. Third,
criterion validity of the 4-cluster solution
was evaluated by examining profiles
across variables not used to form the
clusters that had theoretical support for
variation across clusters.
Profiles of clusters across variables of
interest were assessed using logistic
regression
(binary
variables),
ordinal
logistic regression (ordinal variables), or
linear regression (continuous variables),
adjusting for sex due to sex differences
across clusters. Sex interactions with
profile variables also were assessed to
investigate whether patterns of cluster
difference varied by sex. The Brant test
was used to check the proportional odds
assumption for ordinal logistic regres-
sion. Multivariable logistic regression
was used to estimate associations among
neck pain, headache, and posture clus-
ters after adjusting for the potential con-
founding variables.
Analysis was performed with Stata ver-
sion 13 for Mac (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas). Statistical significance
was set at ��.05.

Results
Of the 1,475 participants in the 17-year-
old cohort follow-up, 1,123 underwent
physical examination, including height,
weight, and posture measurements. Fol-
lowing data inspection and cleaning,
1,108 participants had complete posture
measurements available for clustering.
Cluster Analysis
Following conversion of postural data to
standardized z scores, neck flexion and
head flexion had a strong negative cor-
relation (r��.73). To avoid overrepre-
sentation in the cluster solution, head
flexion was not used, as it had been
shown to have a lower interclass corre-
lation coefficient for consistency and
absolute agreement compared with neck
flexion.46
Ward’s linkage analysis determined the
cluster centers of the 5 remaining pos-
tural measures (thoracic flexion, neck
flexion, cervicothoracic angle, craniocer-
vical angle, and head displacement).

provided most support for the 3- or
4-cluster
solutions.
Therefore,
subse-
quent K-means cluster analysis estimated
both 3- and 4-cluster solutions.
The 4-cluster solution split one large
cluster from the 3-cluster solution into 2
clusters. These new clusters exhibited
similar profiles; however, on photo-
graphic inspection, one group demon-
strated
less
thoracic
flexion
and
appeared to sit closer to end-range tho-
racic extension compared with the sub-
group it had split from. This biomechani-
cal difference was deemed to be of
potential clinical importance, as previ-
ous research has demonstrated that indi-
viduals at extremes of range were at
greater risk of neck pain.34 Therefore,
the 4-cluster solution was chosen as the
most supported by the data and clinical
relevance. Split-half sampling confirmed
very similar 4-cluster solutions.
Cluster Descriptions
Table

presents
cluster
postural
measures.
Cluster 1 (n�311, 28%, upright) was
characterized by the least thoracic flex-
ion and neck flexion of all clusters. There
was a small cervicothoracic angle, and
the craniocervical angle was the smallest
of all clusters (ie, less upward head tilt).
The head was displaced the smallest dis-
tance forward compared with all other
clusters.
Cluster 2 (n�265, 24%, intermediate)
demonstrated a similar pattern of charac-
teristics as cluster 1, but had greater tho-
racic flexion. When considering the posi-
tion of the neck on the thorax, the
cervicothoracic angle was greatest of all
of the clusters, indicating that this sub-
group was the least flexed. There was
less neck flexion, less forward head dis-
placement, and slightly smaller cranio-
cervical angle than the overall mean.
Cluster 3 (n�178, 16%, slumped thorax/
forward head) was characterized by the
most thoracic flexion and the most neck
flexion of all clusters. The head was dis-
placed the greatest distance forward, and
the craniocervical angle was greater than
the other clusters (ie, tilting the head
upward).
Cluster 4 (n�354, 32%, erect thorax/for-
ward head) was characterized by slightly
less thoracic flexion than the population
mean (but more thoracic flexion than
cluster 1) and more neck flexion than the
group mean. This cluster had the small-
est cervicothoracic angle. The head was
displaced forward (more than clusters 1
and 2 and a similar distance to cluster 3)
with a slightly increased craniocervical
angle
(ie,
tilting
the
head
upward)
(Tab. 2).
Cluster Characterization
Clusters 1 (upright) and 4 (erect thorax/
forward head) had higher proportions of
female participants than male partici-
pants (P�.001, Tab. 3). Subsequent anal-
yses were adjusted for sex, and the
absence of sex interactions was con-
firmed for all analyses (ie, no significantly
different patterns of difference across
clusters
in
male
versus
female
participants).
Anthropometrics.
Participants
in
cluster 1 (upright) were significantly
taller than those in the other clusters
(Tab. 3, P�.011). Participants in cluster
3 (slumped thorax/forward head) and
cluster 4 (erect thorax/forward head)
were significantly heavier than those in
cluster 1 (upright) and cluster 2 (inter-
mediate) (P�.001). The same association
was seen between cluster membership
and BMI (P�.001, Tab. 3).
Lifestyle factors.
Participants in clus-
ter 1 exercised more than those in the
other clusters (P��.001) (Tab. 3). There
were no differences among clusters for
the
amount
of
time
spent
sitting
(P�.452) or using the computer (on
weekdays) (P�.356).
Psychological factors.
Two hundred
eighty-two participants (23%) were clas-
sified as having mild or more depression
with the BDI-Y (Tab. 2). After adjusting
for sex, cluster 3 (slumped thorax/for-
ward head) had greater odds for depres-
sion (P�.047, Tab. 3).
Neck pain and headache.
Two hun-
dred
nineteen
participants
(22%)
reported persistent neck pain (Tab. 2),
with 141 (64%) being female. After
adjusting for sex, there was no difference
among the clusters and the odds of per-
sistent neck pain (P�.773, Tab. 4). To
determine whether any association was
masked by other variables shown to be
different among clusters, further adjust-
ment for sex, height, weight, exercise
frequency, and depression was under-
taken. There was still no significant dif-
ference between the clusters and the
presence of persistent neck pain follow-
ing this (P�.741, Tab. 4). One hundred
forty participants (14%) reported neck
pain worse with sitting (Tab. 2). After
adjusting for sex or a multivariable model
of sex, height, weight, exercise fre-
quency, and depression, the odds of
neck pain made worse by sitting did not
differ among the clusters (P�.150 and
P�.262, respectively, Tab. 4).
Ninety-six participants (9%) reported
headaches (Tab. 2), with 51 (53%) being
female. After adjusting for sex or a mul-
tivariable model of sex, height, weight,
exercise
frequency,
and
depression,
no
significant
difference
was
found
between clusters and headaches (P�.563
and P�.450, respectively, Tab. 4).
Discussion
Cluster analysis identified 4 subgroups of
sitting neck posture. All were well char-
acterized by multiple measures and their
validity
was
supported
by
previous
research. Other strengths included utili-
zation
of
a
large,
community-based
cohort of similar age and consideration
of differences in profiles of biopsycho-
social factors.
Sitting Neck Posture Clusters
Previous research has described FHP as a
posture variant.25,33,43,54 These results
support that it is common for 17-year-
olds to hold their head anterior to their
trunk in the sagittal plane. Two clusters
characterized by a FHP were identified
(Tab. 1) and were separated by the
amount of thoracic flexion. Cluster 3 was
characterized by the greatest amount of
thoracic flexion of all of the clusters, and
cluster 4 was characterized by a more
erect thorax. The FHP of cluster 3
(slumped thorax/forward head) supports
the anecdotal descriptions of FHP and a

There was no clear prior report of an

may be explained by the majority of pre-
vious studies utilizing singular postural
measures in the neck or not having con-
sidered the thoracic spine position. One
study demonstrated that FHP in a stand-
ing position was not associated with
increased upper or lower thoracic curva-
ture.26 Differences in postural control
strategies and thoracic position may
occur between sitting and standing,
potentially
accounting
for
differing
results. Distinctly different thoracic flex-
ion in clusters 3 and 4 supports inclusion
of this angle in future studies investigat-
ing sitting neck posture.
Another difference between clusters 3
(slumped thorax/forward head) and 4
(erect thorax/forward head) was a larger
craniocervical angle in cluster 3, indica-
tive of a greater degree of upward head
tilt. This difference is consistent with
previous FHP descriptions42,56 and previ-
ous neck posture measurements.25,55 A
potential role of the head in neck pos-
ture is to level the eyes.25,44 Cluster 3
(slumped thorax/forward head) aligns to
this, with greater thorax flexion but also
more upward head tilt and thus a level
eye gaze. This finding contrasts with a
study conducted in a standing position
that indicated a more flexed neck was
not associated with a concomitant tilt of
the head upward.26 The lack of agree-
ment may be explained by the relation-
ships of adjacent segments altering in a
sitting position.55
In contrast to the FHP of clusters 3 and 4,
cluster 1 (upright) had the most upright
sitting posture (Tab. 1). This finding is
consistent with a previous study that
showed decreased forward lean of the
neck was associated with decreased flex-
ion in the lower cervical spine and
increased flexion of the upper cervical
spine was associated with a downward
tilt of the head.55 It makes sense that if
both the thorax and neck are less flexed,
the head will require less upward tilt to
level the eyes, as evidenced by the
smaller craniocervical angle in cluster 1.
Cluster 2 posture (intermediate) is some-
what in the middle of the 2 extreme
postures in this study (cluster 1 [upright]
and cluster 3 [slumped thorax/forward
head]). Although there is little evidence
to determine what constitutes a neutral
posture,44 the intermediate posture of
cluster 2 appears to be consistent with
the mid-range position of the neck and
thorax and with the head in a position
where the eye gaze is level.
Posture Clusters, Sex, and
Anthropometric Factors
Similar
to
previous
findings35,36,57,58
female participants were more com-
monly represented in clusters with more
upright sitting postures. It is not clear
why female individuals sit more upright,
but it could relate to sex differences in
other anthropometric factors and social
factors related to body image.58 Body
mass index can influence sitting pos-
ture,59 with a higher BMI associated with
more slump in a sitting position.58 How-
ever, neither of these studies58,59 consid-

 ered the neck and head position. Results
from this study concur with a prior find-
ing that high school students who are
overweight sit in more neck and thoracic
flexion.34 This increased neck and tho-
racic flexion may be a consequence of
increased load associated with higher
BMI or comorbid muscle deconditioning
making it more difficult to hold more
erect postures.60
Posture Clusters and
Psychosocial Factors
Cluster 3 participants (slumped thorax/
forward head) had higher odds of depres-
sive symptoms (Tab. 3), consistent with
a previous study in adolescents with
chronic
nonspecific
musculoskeletal
pain for whom slumped postures were
associated with higher levels of anxiety
and depression.61 Of note, slumped lum-
bar sitting posture was not significantly
associated with higher scores of depres-
sion as measured with the BDI-Y in the
Raine study cohort at the age of 14
years.58 This difference is likely due to
the head and neck position in the current
modeling, but only trunk position in the
previous study.58 A sharp rise in the
prevalence of depression in adolescents
following the onset of puberty62 could
indicate that depression would be a
greater influence at 17 years of age than
at
14
years
of
age.
An
association
between
cluster
membership
and
depression supports the concept of a
mind-body relationship, although the
direction
of
this
relationship
is
unknown.58,63,64
Posture Clusters and Lifestyle
Factors
Cluster 1 participants (upright) were
more physically active compared with
the other clusters. Physical activity can
relate to greater back muscle endurance,
which has an association with upright
posture.65 This conclusion is consistent
with an intervention study showing exer-
cise can facilitate adoption of more
upright postures.66
Computer use did not differ among clus-
ters. A previous study67 showed transient
changes in neck and head tilt posture
with use of different types of information
technology. Higher computer use was
associated with increased head flexion
and neck flexion in male participants but
not female participants in the Raine
study cohort at age 14 years.12 Although
Straker et al12 only used singular postural
measures, results from the current study
do appear contrary, as there was no
increased computer use in the 2 FHP
clusters. Increased use of computers,
mobile touch screen tablets, and smart-
phone devices since this study was
undertaken may mean that exposure
time has increased and may be relevant
to neck posture in adolescents now.
Posture Clusters and Pain
There is a strong clinical and societal
belief that neck posture is a significant
factor associated with neck pain.68 There
is some supporting evidence for this
view,17,19
although
other
research
refutes it.35–39 The 4 neck posture clus-
ters were not associated with persistent
neck pain or neck pain made worse by
sitting (Tab. 4), despite accounting for
limitations in prior research, including

 use of well-defined measures of posture
and good characterization of pain. In this
study, participants with 3 months of
recurrent or prolonged neck pain were
included for analysis, whereas previous
studies have not specified the duration of
neck pain.18,20,39 This study also consid-
ered neck pain to be more specific to the
task of sitting and to align with the test
position used in an attempt to replicate
clinical practice of matching aggravating
activities to specific objective findings.
To our knowledge, no previous research
has
detailed
potential
relationships
between neck posture and neck pain
that is worse in a sitting position.
Previous studies indicating an associa-
tion between neck posture and neck
pain have drawn participants from clini-
cal populations18,39 or workplaces that
involve prolonged computer use, an
occupational task reported to link with
neck pain perhaps as consequence of the
prolonged
neck
flexion
postures
adopted.20 Smaller, specialized samples
may misrepresent associations in the
general population.
The current results do not support the
commonly held clinical and societal
belief that neck pain is related to spinal
posture. This finding is consistent with
findings from systematic reviews that the
association between neck pain and pos-
ture is weak.22,33 In contrast, previous
studies showed that factors such as
genetics,69 female sex,4,7–10 depressed
mood, stress,14 and sleep patterns70 are
associated with neck pain. These find-
ings suggest that neck pain is associated
with changes in pain regulatory mecha-
nisms rather than biomechanics, which
supports calls to consider and manage
neck pain from a broader biopsycho-
social perspective.
There was no difference in the odds of
headaches across the 4 clusters, but the
definition of headache used in this study
was broad. A previous study showed that
neither
cervicogenic
headache
nor
migraine was associated with head and
neck posture.71 Most previous studies
looking for a link between neck posture
and headaches have focused on cervico-
genic headache24 or tension headache
groups.72,73
Even
when
considering
headache type separately, results are
contradictory, with some studies report-
ing an association between posture and
headaches,24,72 whereas other studies
did not.71,73 These studies used single
posture angle measures. More research is
warranted using posture clusters and
clearly defined headache groups (thus
avoiding any washout effect from sub-
groups of neck posture or subgroups of
headaches).
Although there was not a cross-sectional
association between posture clusters and
neck pain, prospective examination of
the effect of cluster membership on
future episodes of neck pain is worth
consideration. Flexed neck posture was
not associated with incident neck pain
over 3 years in one large prospective
study of workers in a wide range of work
roles across 34 workplaces.13 The lack of
association observed may have been due
to limitations of analysis being per-
formed on mean values from subsamples
of the workers at each workplace rather
than at an individual level.
Limitations
Posture clusters and experience of pain
were not associated in this study. The
adolescent age of the participants limits
the extrapolation of results to adults. Fur-
thermore, participants in this study were
primarily Caucasian Australians. Associa-
tions among posture, anthropometric
measures, psychological factors, lifestyle
factors, and neck pain may be different
in populations from other countries or
other ethnicities. Assessment of stan-
dardized
posture
with
2-dimensional
photography cannot capture the com-
plex interactions of intersegmental trans-
lation and rotation that may be measured
by radiographic assessment.48 Another
limitation is that photographs represent
only a “snapshot of time” and cannot
reflect changes in posture that occur
over time, which may affect potential
relationships between sitting posture
and neck pain. Complex interactions
among sitting posture, sitting task, pat-
tern of breaks, and other contributing
factors were not captured. Although the
lumbar spine posture was not included
in the modeling, we acknowledge that it
may be important.
In conclusion, this study identified 4
neck posture subgroups in a sitting pos-
ture. The results support previous find-
ings that sitting posture is associated
with
different
dimensions,
including
exercise
frequency,
depression,
and
BMI.34 Despite strong support for the
existence of neck posture subgroups,
they were not associated with persistent
neck pain, neck pain in a sitting position,
or headaches in 17-year-olds. This finding
raises questions regarding the efficacy of
generic postural advice for adolescents
with and without neck pain.
