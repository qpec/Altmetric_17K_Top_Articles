Abstract
Background: Bronchoscopy is frequently used for the evaluation of suspicious pulmonary lesions found on
computed tomography, but its sensitivity for detecting lung cancer is limited. Recently, a bronchial genomic
classifier was validated to improve the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for lung cancer detection, demonstrating a high
sensitivity and negative predictive value among patients at intermediate risk (10–60 %) for lung cancer with an
inconclusive bronchoscopy. Our objective for this study was to determine if a negative genomic classifier result that
down-classifies a patient from intermediate risk to low risk (<10 %) for lung cancer would reduce the rate that
physicians recommend more invasive testing among patients with an inconclusive bronchoscopy.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, prospective, decision impact survey study assessing pulmonologist
recommendations in patients undergoing workup for lung cancer who had an inconclusive bronchoscopy.
Cases with an intermediate pretest risk for lung cancer were selected from the AEGIS trials and presented in a
randomized fashion to pulmonologists either with or without the patient’s bronchial genomic classifier result to
determine how the classifier results impacted physician decisions.
Results: Two hundred two physicians provided 1523 case evaluations on 36 patients. Invasive procedure
recommendations were reduced from 57 % without the classifier result to 18 % with a negative (low risk) classifier
result (p < 0.001). Invasive procedure recommendations increased from 50 to 65 % with a positive (intermediate risk)
classifier result (p < 0.001). When stratifying by ultimate disease diagnosis, there was an overall reduction in invasive
procedure recommendations in patients with benign disease when classifier results were reported (54 to 41 %,
p < 0.001). For patients ultimately diagnosed with malignant disease, there was an overall increase in invasive
procedure recommendations when the classifier results were reported (50 to 64 %, p = 0.003).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a negative (low risk) bronchial genomic classifier result reduces invasive
procedure recommendations following an inconclusive bronchoscopy and that the classifier overall reduces
invasive procedure recommendations among patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. These results
support the potential clinical utility of the classifier to improve management of patients undergoing bronchoscopy
for suspect lung cancer by reducing additional invasive procedures in the setting of benign disease.

 Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the
United States, with a 5 year survival rate of 17 % and an
estimated 158,000 deaths in 2015 [1]. The landmark
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a
20 % relative reduction in mortality through annual low
dose computer tomography (CT) in at-risk individuals,
though at the expense of 24 % positive screens with a
high false positive rate (96 %) [2, 3]. There is a concern
that widespread implementation of lung cancer screen-
ing programs, along with the increased identification of
incidental findings on CT [4], will lead to a substantial
increase in the invasive workup of pulmonary nodules
and lesions, many of which will be benign after further
evaluation.
Bronchoscopy is frequently used to investigate abnor-
malities discovered on chest CT scans. However, the
diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy for lung cancer is
between 38 and 83 %, even with the development of
navigation and ultrasound technologies [5, 6]. An incon-
clusive bronchoscopy presents a challenging clinical di-
lemma of subjecting the patient to the risk of a second
invasive diagnostic procedure or the risk of a delayed
diagnosis from a watchful waiting approach.
To address this clinical dilemma, a bronchial genomic
classifier (Percepta, Veracyte, Inc.) was recently validated
in multiple prospective multicenter observational trials
to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of bronchoscopy
for lung cancer [7, 8]. Based on the airway “field of in-
jury” paradigm in current and former smokers [9], the
classifier
measures
gene-expression
profiles
in
the
cytologically-normal bronchial epithelium to distinguish
patients with lung cancer versus those with benign dis-
eases of the chest [8]. The bronchial genomic classifier
demonstrated a high sensitivity and a negative predictive
value (NPV) for lung cancer of 91 % in those with an
intermediate (10–60 %) pretest probability of lung can-
cer and an inconclusive bronchoscopy [7]. A negative
bronchial genomic classifier result in this population ef-
fectively lowered the probability of lung cancer to less
than 10 %, while a positive classifier result maintained
the risk category as intermediate.
While the clinical validity and performance of the bron-
chial genomic classifier have been demonstrated [7, 8], the
impact of the classifier on physician decision making has
not been directly assessed given that physicians were
blinded to the classifier results in those clinical trials. Our
overall hypothesis is that a negative genomic classifier re-
sult that reclassifies a patient to “low risk” will reduce the
rate at which patients will go on for more invasive testing,
while not delaying the diagnosis in those patients who
have malignant disease.
To begin to test our hypothesis, we selected patient
cases from the prospective Airway Epithelial Gene
Expression in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer (AEGIS) tri-
als to construct a case-randomized decision impact sur-
vey study. We administered the survey to pulmonary
physicians and measured the rate that physicians chose
more invasive testing or CT surveillance depending on
the results of the bronchial genomic classifier.
Methods
Study overview
The Physician Decision Making Impact of the Percepta
Bronchial Genomic Classifier (PIONEER) study was a
case-randomized, prospective, decision impact study
assessing pulmonologist management recommendations
in patients undergoing workup for lung cancer who had
an inconclusive bronchoscopy. Up to 15 unique patient
case vignettes were presented to each experienced pul-
monologist; approximately half of the cases contained
the classifier result and the rest did not. Which case
contained the classifier result and the sequence the cases
were presented to each pulmonologist were completely
randomized. The pulmonologist’s recommendation for
treatment was recorded after each case was reviewed to
determine how the classifier results impacted physician
decisions.
The primary endpoint was the change in recommen-
dation of invasive procedures with classifier “low risk”
(negative) results. The secondary endpoints were the
change in recommendations for invasive procedures
with classifier “intermediate risk” (positive) results, and
the change in rate of invasive procedure recommenda-
tions in benign and malignant patients regardless of the
classifier results (“low risk” (negative) or “intermediate
risk” (positive)).
Study participants
Eligible study participants were US board-certified pul-
monologists who were recruited through
Qualtrics’
(Provo, Utah) physician panel. Subjects were enrolled in
the study if they indicated they specialized in pulmonol-
ogy, interventional pulmonology, or pulmonary/critical
care medicine, were board certified, practiced pulmonary
medicine for at least 2 years post training, performed at
least 5 bronchoscopies per month, and indicated that
they were likely to use the bronchial genomic classifier
after reading a test description. In addition, physicians
were asked to correctly identify 2 patient cases as the ap-
propriate lung cancer risk category (low (<10 %), inter-
mediate (10–60 %), or high (>60 %) risk) for lung cancer
after reading a brief description including clinical data,
smoking history, and nodule characteristics to ensure
appropriate physician judgment in assessing cancer risk.
The risk levels of these two cases were confirmed using
two validated risk calculators [10, 11] and were designed
to be on the far ends of the risk spectrum as a quality

 control metric to ensure physicians completing survey
assess risk consistent with ACCP guidance on pulmon-
ary nodule management [12] (see Additional file 1 for
case descriptions and risk of malignancy calculations).
Patient population
Patient cases were selected from the AEGIS trials
(AEGIS-1 and −2, NCT01309087 and NCT00746759).
These trials were two prospective, multicenter (n = 28
centers),
observational
studies
that
enrolled
938
current and former smokers without a prior history
of cancer who underwent bronchoscopy for suspected
lung cancer. The design of these studies have been
described in detail [7, 8].
Patient cases
All cases from the AEGIS data set were extracted in
which (i) the pre-bronchoscopy risk of malignancy was
either intermediate (10–60 %) as determined by the
treating physician, or unassessed, and (ii) the initial
bronchoscopy procedure was not diagnostic for cancer.
These comprised patients included as part of the train-
ing [8] and validation [7] of the classifier. Case details
were de-identified and extracted from case report forms
and medical charts and described in vignettes. These de-
scriptions included the patient’s clinical presentation and
comorbidities, age, gender, smoking history (pack years
and years since quitting), other exposure history, CT re-
sults
(nodule diameter,
nodule
location, spiculation
(when available), presence or absence of adenopathy,
longitudinal
changes
(when
available)),
PET
results
(when available), as well as findings from bronchoscopy.
Cancer status and bronchial genomic classifier results
were not included in the case descriptions.
Two board certified pulmonologists independently
reviewed available data for each case. The reviewing pul-
monologists were asked to evaluate the case information,
including bronchoscopy results, to determine the risk
for malignancy and the likelihood of the patient being
taken to an additional invasive diagnostic procedure. If
only one pulmonologist assessed the case as intermedi-
ate risk, the case was sent to a third board certified pul-
monologist for adjudication. Cases were included if two
pulmonologists made a determination of intermediate
risk, and if at least one pulmonologist determined the
patient was likely to be taken to an additional invasive
procedure.
Data collection
Physicians were first asked basic information about their
clinical practice including type of practice, bronchoscopy
techniques used, and how they typically manage patients
undergoing workup for lung cancer. Next, physicians
were provided with a test description and intended use,
clinical validation data and published article [7], and
sample test reports (see Additional file 1 for description
of test provided to physicians). For each case, physicians
were provided with case details detailed above including
clinical history, imaging findings, as well as cytology and
pathology results from bronchoscopy. For each case that
the study physician agreed with the intermediate (10–
60 %) risk assessment of the case, the physician was pro-
vided or blinded to the bronchial genomic classifier test
report in a randomized 1:1 fashion and asked about the
next step in their management plan for the patient.
Choices were CT surveillance, additional bronchoscopy,
trans-thoracic needle biopsy, surgery, or PET scan. If the
physician chose PET as the management option, he or
she received notice that the PET “yielded indeterminate
results (PET scan results did not significantly alter your
assessment of malignancy risk for this patient)”. The
physician was then prompted to make another manage-
ment choice.
Participant responses were screened for poor data
quality and excluded if: (1) the survey was incom-
plete, (2) respondents finished the survey in less than
8 min (less than 1/3 of median completion time), or
(3) respondents provided identical responses to 5 con-
secutive questions.
Description of test reports
Two test results are possible with the bronchial genomic
classifier–positive and negative [8]. Because the positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV) of the classifier are dependent on the pre-test
prevalence or probability of malignancy, classifier results
are reported in the context of the physician’s pre-
bronchoscopy assessed risk of malignancy [7]. For pa-
tients with an intermediate pre-test risk of malignancy, a
positive result has a PPV of 40 % and is reported as
“intermediate risk”. A negative result has an NPV of
91 % and is reported as “low risk” [7].
Data analysis
The Chi Squared Test was used to assess the primary
and secondary endpoints and to compare the rate of in-
vasive procedures in cases reviewed with and without
bronchial genomic classifier results. To test whether
there were differences in decision making between dif-
ferent physician subgroups, logistic regression models
were built assessing the impact of showing low risk
(negative) test results across groups. All statistical tests
were two-sided at a significance level, 0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed using R v3.1.3 software.
Results
There were 485 physicians screened and 202 physicians
that ultimately participated in the study (Additional file

 1: Figure S1). Study participants were all US board-
certified pulmonologists and represented a broad mix of
physicians across geographies and practice type (Table 1).
Participants were specialized in at least one of pulmo-
nology (73 %), pulmonary critical care (53 %), or inter-
ventional pulmonology (13 %). They had a median
(inter-quartile range, IQR) of post-training experience of
14 (12) years and performed a median (IQR) of 10 (12)
bronchoscopies monthly for suspected lung cancer.
In total, 36 patients were selected (Additional file 1:
Figure S2) and one third of cases were patients with ma-
lignant disease (Table 2), which was consistent with the
cancer prevalence in the intermediate risk population in
the AEGIS studies [7]. There were no significant differ-
ences seen between 163 cases reviewed and the 36 cases
selected in terms of patient demographics, clinical char-
acteristics, or classifier results (Additional file 1: Table
S1). The median (IQR) pack years of these cases was 39
(34) and 19 cases (53 %) had nodules less than 2 cm.
PET results were available in 11 of the 36 cases pre-
sented. When patient cases were presented to physician
participants with genomic classifier results, the actual
classifier results were used. The classifier performance,
true negative rate and true positive rate within these
36 cases was consistent with that in the AEGIS stud-
ies; 50 % of patients with benign disease were down-
classified with a negative result and identified as ‘low
risk’ and 92 % of patients with malignant disease had
a positive result and were identified as ‘intermediate
risk’ (Table 3) [7].
In total, 202 physicians provided 1523 case reviews for
these 36 patients. Of the 1523 case reviews, 787 (52 %)
cases were assessed based on clinical information only
without genomic classifier results and 736 (48 %) cases
were assessed with genomic classifier results. Table 3
shows the number of patients selected and case evalua-
tions by cancer status and genomic classifier results.
Cases were evaluated proportionately to the patient mix,
indicating that cases were presented successfully at ran-
dom without systematic bias.
In order to establish a baseline for physician recommen-
dations, physician responses using clinical information

 only (blinded to genomic classifier results) were assessed.
When blinded to classifier results, physicians recom-
mended invasive procedures for 415 of 787 cases (53 %).
This rate did not differ significantly in invasive procedure
recommendation for patients ultimately diagnosed with
benign or malignant disease (invasive procedure rates of
54 and 50 % respectively, p = 0.4). There was also no sig-
nificant bias
in
invasive
procedure
recommendation
whether patient cases were associated with intermediate
risk (positive) (50 %) or low risk (negative) (57 %) genomic
classifier results (p = 0.07) since the results were not re-
vealed to physicians. Physician respondents selected PET
16 % of the time; of these ultimately 7 % of these respon-
dents chose CT surveillance, and 9 % chose a second
procedure.
To examine the primary study endpoint of the impact of
low risk (negative) genomic classifier results on reducing
invasive procedure recommendations, the rate of proced-
ure recommendations was compared when physicians had
access to clinical information alone versus access to gen-
omic classifier results as well. Invasive procedure recom-
mendations were reduced from 57 % (n = 154 cases out of
268 cases) when physicians only had access to clinical in-
formation to 18 % (n = 44 cases out of 251 cases) when
the low risk (negative) results were also reported (Fig. 1), a
three-fold decrease (p < 0.001). Figure 1 further details the
rate of the procedure types that physicians recommended.
No significant differences in decision making were ob-
served between pulmonologist type (interventional vs
other, p = 0.46) or those who performed higher (>10) ver-
sus lower (≤10) volume of bronchoscopies for lung cancer
per month (p = 0.89) (Additional file 1: Tables S2 and S3).
As a secondary endpoint, we investigated the impact
of intermediate risk (positive) classifier results on phys-
ician recommendations and similarly compared when
physicians had access to clinical information alone ver-
sus genomic classifier results as well. Invasive procedure
recommendations were increased from 50 % (n = 261
cases out of 519 cases) when physicians only had access
to clinical information to 65 % (n = 314 cases out of 485
cases) when the intermediate risk (positive) results were
also reported (Fig. 2) (p < 0.001). Figure 2 further details
the
rate
of
the
procedure
types
that
physicians
recommended.
As an additional secondary endpoint, we investigated
the overall impact of the genomic classifier results (both
low risk (negative) and intermediate risk (positive) re-
sults) on physician decision making in patients ultim-
ately diagnosed with either malignant or benign disease
(Fig. 3). In the benign group, there was an overall reduc-
tion in invasive procedure recommendations observed
when classifier results were reported. The rate of inva-
sive procedure recommendation significantly decreased
from 54 % (285 cases out of 528 cases) to 41 % (201
cases out of 491 cases) (p < 0.001). For the malignant
group, there was an overall increase in invasive pro-
cedure recommendations when the classifier results
were reported. The rate of invasive procedure recom-
mendation increased significantly from 50 % (130
cases out of 259 cases) to 64 % (157 cases out of 245
cases)
(p = 0.003).

Discussion
In this study, we sought to determine the potential clin-
ical impact of a bronchial genomic classifier on decision
making in patients at intermediate pretest risk of lung
cancer whose bronchoscopy was inconclusive. We used
a clinical decision impact survey of 202 physicians evalu-
ating 36 cases (1523 total case evaluations) randomized
to the availability or absence of the bronchial genomic
classifier results. Without classifier results, we found
that physicians recommended an additional invasive
procedure 53 % of the time. This is consistent with
other observational studies that have examined man-
agement of indeterminate pulmonary lesions and sug-
gest that decision making by physicians in this survey
is reflective of the real world. In a multi-center obser-
vational study of procedure use of community pulmo-
nologists on patients with indeterminate pulmonary

 nodules, physicians performed biopsy in 54 % of pa-
tients (202 of 307) [13]. In the AEGIS data set, in pa-
tients at intermediate pretest risk of malignancy with
an inconclusive bronchoscopy, physicians performed a bi-
opsy in 53 % of patients (62 of 117 patients) [14]. In a
study assessing guideline concordance in evaluation of
pulmonary nodules, patients with nodules larger than
8 mm underwent non-surgical biopsy 33 % of the time
and surgical resection 12 % of the time [15].
We found that the availability of bronchial genomic
classifier results significantly altered physician decision
making. When low risk (negative) classifier results were
shown to physicians, there was a 3-fold reduction in the
rate of invasive procedure recommendations as com-
pared to cases when the classifier results were not
shown. These results suggest that the use of the genomic
classifier in the intermediate pretest risk population may
reduce the rate of invasive testing among patients with
benign lung disease.
Additionally, we found that there was an increase in
procedure recommendations from 50 to 65 % when
intermediate risk results were shown. This was a surpris-
ing finding, as intermediate risk results confirmed the
physicians’ initial pre-test risk assessment and thus pro-
cedure recommendation rate would have been expected
to be similar. We speculate that physicians, when pre-
sented with an additional data point that does not re-
duce probability of malignancy, may tend towards a
more
aggressive
approach
rather
than
surveillance.
These findings highlight the importance of physician
education in interpreting results of the classifier in terms
of its negative and positive predictive values.
We also found that there was an overall significant re-
duction in invasive procedure recommendations for pa-
tients with an ultimate benign diagnosis when the
bronchial genomic classifier results were shown. Con-
versely, in patients with an ultimate diagnosis of cancer,
there was an increase in invasive procedure recommen-
dations overall when the results of classifier were shown.
These results are ultimately due to the prevalence of dis-
ease in low risk (negative) vs. intermediate risk (positive)
classifier results. Those individuals with cancer almost

 always had intermediate risk (positive) results, while
those without cancer were split between low-risk (nega-
tive) and intermediate risk (positive) results.
Our study does have some limitations that should be
addressed. First, physicians were provided a summary of
the patient’s clinical presentation (age, gender, comor-
bidities), smoking history (pack years, years since quit-
ting) and exposure history, physical exam findings,
lesion details from the CT and PET reports (nodule
diameter, location, presence of adenopathy), but did not
have direct access to the CT image, which can impact
decision making in this setting. However, based on the
information
provided,
physicians
would
have
had
enough information to calculate risk from several pul-
monary nodule risk calculators, including the Veteran
Affairs [16] and Mayo [17] models. An additional related
caveat is that physicians who chose PET as the manage-
ment option were notified that the PET results were in-
determinate and did not significantly alter the risk of
malignancy, prompting them to make another manage-
ment choice. Inclusion of this option was intended to
simulate real-world clinical decision making for the par-
ticipant. PET scanning is often done pre-bronchoscopy
as part of the pre-test risk assessment in settings where
physicians feel it will add value. In the AEGIS trial, PET
was performed and data available in 11 of 36 cases in-
cluded in this study. However, we recognize that some
physicians may elect to choose PET following an incon-
clusive bronchoscopy, a choice that was made 16 % of
the time within the survey.
Second, this was a clinical decision impact study pre-
sented in survey form and not a clinical trial or registry.
As such, it can only approximate clinical utility using re-
sponses from a population who may have some form of
selection bias for entering into this type of study. We
also recognize that decisions made in a survey may not
accurately reflect those made at point of care. However,
decision making in proceeding to invasive procedures
when blinded to classifier results in our study was simi-
lar to real world observational studies [13-15]. Further,
decision
impact
studies
have
successfully
evaluated
changes
in
clinical
decision-making
and
healthcare
utilization associated with novel cardiovascular [18, 19]
and oncology [20–24] diagnostic tests. The concordance
between clinician treatment plans and actual clinical
management has been shown to be between 80 and
85 % [19, 20], suggesting that this methodology is a valid
tool to predict the ultimate utility of a diagnostic test.
Third, we recognize that clinical decision making is ul-
timately modulated by patient preferences which cannot
be captured by this survey. However, the rate of invasive
testing in our survey by physicians blinded to the classi-
fier results was comparable to that seen in the observa-
tional multicenter AEGIS trial suggesting that clinical
decision making in our survey mirrors that seen in clin-
ical practice [14].
There are a number of key strengths to our study de-
sign. First, the clinical impact survey leveraged actual
cases from the multicenter prospective AEGIS trials [7, 8],
likely reflecting the general mix of patients that might
benefit from the classifier. In particular, we limited the
survey to those patients whose bronchoscopy was incon-
clusive and where the pretest risk of cancer was inter-
mediate, the clinical setting in which physicians have the

 greatest uncertainty about subsequent invasive testing
[25]. Our case selection process included review and adju-
dication of the available case data by board certified pul-
monologists to ensure that the case represented an
intermediate risk of malignancy based on the available
data. Additionally, we reported the actual results of the
classifier for the patients from that trial in a randomized
fashion, enabling us to model the impact of the classifier
on clinical decision making. Third, we intentionally
avoided the more
conventional matched-pair design
where each physician will be presented with a case first
without the classifier information and then with the classi-
fier information and asked for their treatment recommen-
dation for each scenario consecutively. Instead, for each
physician being surveyed, which case contains the classi-
fier information as well as the order the cases were pre-
sented were completely randomized. This potentially
reduced cognitive bias due to the anchoring effect: the
tendency to keep one’s belief or revise one’s belief insuffi-
ciently when presented with new evidence (in this case
the genomic classifier result) [26, 27].
Conclusions
The results from this clinical decision impact study sug-
gest that a bronchial genomic classifier has the capacity to
change decision making in patients suspected of lung can-
cer with an inconclusive bronchoscopy. We found that
practicing physicians who are provided low risk results
from the classifier recommended significantly fewer inva-
sive procedures among intermediate pretest risk patients.
Given the growing unmet medical need to improve the
evaluation and management of lung lesions found on
chest imaging, the bronchial genomic classifier has the po-
tential to reduce the burden of additional invasive diag-
nostic procedures in patients with benign disease.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
The study was reviewed and approved by an independent
institutional review board (Western Institutional Review
Board, Puyallup, WA, Study Number 1157098). The study
was administered via an online questionnaire administered
by Qualtrics. The study was conducted in compliance with
good clinical practice (GCP) with the applicable regulatory
requirements. The survey process was conducted by
personnel trained in the protection and confidentiality of
protected health information (PHI). All study physicians
were provided electronic written consent for study partici-
pation. Physicians were de-identified by the survey admin-
istrator before data was provided to the authors.
Consent for publication
