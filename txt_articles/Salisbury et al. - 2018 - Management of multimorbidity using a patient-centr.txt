Summary
Background The management of people with multiple chronic conditions challenges health-care systems designed 
around single conditions. There is international consensus that care for multimorbidity should be patient-centred, 
focus on quality of life, and promote self-management towards agreed goals. However, there is little evidence about 
the effectiveness of this approach. Our hypothesis was that the patient-centred, so-called 3D approach (based on 
dimensions of health, depression, and drugs) for patients with multimorbidity would improve their health-related 
quality of life, which is the ultimate aim of the 3D intervention.
Methods We did this pragmatic cluster-randomised trial in general practices in England and Scotland. Practices were 
randomly allocated to continue usual care (17 practices) or to provide 6-monthly comprehensive 3D reviews, 
incorporating patient-centred strategies that reflected international consensus on best care (16 practices). Randomisation 
was computer-generated, stratified by area, and minimised by practice deprivation and list size. Adults with three or 
more chronic conditions were recruited. The primary outcome was quality of life (assessed with EQ-5D-5L) after 
15 months’ follow-up. Participants were not masked to group assignment, but analysis of outcomes was blinded. We 
analysed the primary outcome in the intention-to-treat population, with missing data being multiply imputed. This 
trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN06180958.
Findings Between May 20, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we recruited 1546 patients from 33 practices and randomly assigned 
them to receive the intervention (n=797) or usual care (n=749). In our intention-to-treat analysis, there was no 
difference between trial groups in the primary outcome of quality of life (adjusted difference in mean EQ-5D-5L 0·00, 
95% CI –0·02 to 0·02; p=0·93). 78 patients died, and the deaths were not considered as related to the intervention.
Interpretation To our knowledge, this trial is the largest investigation of the international consensus about optimal 
management of multimorbidity. The 3D intervention did not improve patients’ quality of life.

Introduction
There is increasing awareness of the importance of multi­
morbidity, defined as patients living with two or more 
chronic health conditions. One in four people in the UK 
and the USA have multimorbidity, increasing to at least 
two­thirds of those older than 65 years.1,2 Multimorbidity 
is associated with reduced quality of life, impaired 
functional status, worse physical and mental health, and 
increased mortality.3 The increasing prevalence of multi­
morbidity, driven by the ageing population, represents a 
major challenge to all health­care systems because these 
patients are heavy users of services. In the USA, people 
with multimorbidity account for more than two­thirds of 
total health spending.2
Efforts to improve the care of patients with chronic 
diseases have focused on developing guidelines to 
implement standardised care for each disease. However, 
this approach can have disadvantages for patients with 
multimorbidity.4 Recommendations based on disease­
specific guidelines can be inappropriate for patients with 
co­existing conditions.3 If each condition is considered in 
isolation, patients can be prescribed numerous drugs and 
lifestyle changes, and are expected to attend frequent 
health­care appointments. Therefore, treatment itself can 
represent an excessive burden for patients with 
multimorbidity, alongside their burden of illness.5 
Furthermore, segmentation of care by disease means that 
health care for these patients is often fragmented and 
poorly coordinated. Older adults describe wanting one 
professional to take continuing responsibility for their 
overall care, and to consider their personal situation and 
preferences when advising about treatment decisions.6
Recognising these problems, organisations in England,3 
the USA,2,7 Europe,8 and internationally9 have  published 
guidance about improving the management of patients 
with multimorbidity, and the US Department of Health

and Human Services has called for a paradigm shift in 
how care is provided.2 There is broad consensus about the 
key components of such an approach, which reflect a 
patient­centred care model10 and insights from the 
Chronic Care Model.11 These components include a 
regular comprehensive review of patients’ problems 
according to their individual circumstances, a focus on 
quality of life and function as well as disease control, 
tailoring treatment recom 
mendations to each individual’s 
priorities and situation, balancing risks and benefits of 
treatment while seeking to reduce treatment burden 
(particularly inappropriate polypharmacy), promoting 
self­management, sharing decisions with patients, and 
agreeing an individualised care plan. Services should be 
delivered by a multi­disciplinary team in the community, 
but with one clearly defined professional with responsi­
bility for coordinating care. These changes require system 
re­design facilitated by clinical information systems that 
provide decision support and allow sharing of information 
between care providers.
Despite broad international support for these ideas, 
there is little evidence about their effectiveness in 
improving outcomes for patients with multimorbidity. 
A systematic review12 found few randomised trials of 
interventions, with many remaining uncertainties about 
their effect on a range of outcomes. Given the importance 
of multimorbidity for health services there is an urgent 
need to assess new models of care.
The aim of this study was to implement, at scale, a new 
approach to managing patients with multimorbidity in 
primary care and to assess its effectiveness. The 3D 
approach is based on a patient­centred care model and 
encapsulates all the strategies recommended in recent 
international guidelines.2,3,7–9
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a pragmatic cluster­randomised controlled trial in 
general practices in the UK, after an external pilot of the 
intervention in three general practices.
General practices providing National Health Service 
(NHS) primary medical care were recruited from three 
areas: Bristol and Greater Manchester in England, and 
Ayrshire in Scotland. Eligible practices had at least two 
physicians and 4500 registered patients and used the 
EMIS electronic medical records system. We used EMIS 
to identify patients with any of the 17 major chronic 
conditions from those included in the UK Quality and 
Outcomes 
Framework 
(QOF) 
pay­for­performance 
programme. We grouped these conditions into ten types 
of condition with similar management considerations; 
for example, having two cardio 
vascular conditions only 
counted as one condition. Eligible patients were aged 
18 years or older, with at least three types of chronic 
condition. Patients were excluded if they had a life 
expectancy of less than 12 months, were at serious 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A Cochrane review of interventions for improving outcomes 
in patients with multimorbidity in primary care and 
community settings was published in April, 2012 (and 
updated in 2016). The 2012 version, published before this 
study began, included ten randomised controlled trials, eight 
of which focused on patients with a broad range of chronic 
conditions. Nine of the trials were done in North America and 
might not be generalisable to other health-care systems. The 
patient inclusion criteria, types of intervention, and outcomes 
measured were very varied and the findings were inconclusive. 
The authors concluded that there was a paucity of research 
and further pragmatic studies based in primary care settings 
were needed. They highlighted the need to focus on outcomes 
that are relevant across diseases, such as quality of life, 
function, and symptom burden. The updated Cochrane review, 
published in 2016, included eight additional trials but reached 
similar conclusions. While this trial was in progress, the 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
also reviewed evidence about the management of 
multimorbidity. They concluded that the evidence base was 
inadequate and that trials of alternative approaches to 
organising care for people with multimorbidity were required 
that examined the effect of these alternative approaches on 
important clinical outcomes, quality of life, and 
cost-effectiveness. NICE recommended that care should reflect 
each patient’s individual needs, preferences for treatments, 
health priorities, and goals.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the largest trial of an intervention to 
improve management of multimorbidity in primary care. The 
intervention, based on a patient-centred care model, reflected 
the international consensus about strategies most likely to 
improve patient management. The results show that although 
the intervention was effective at improving experience of 
patient-centred care, it was not associated with benefits in 
quality of life or the burden of illness or treatment. 
Implications of all the available evidence
We have done an updated review to include trials published 
since the 2016 Cochrane review, combined with the results of 
this study. The findings showed that, although different 
studies used a range of strategies to improve care, it is unlikely 
that current interventions for multimorbidity have a 
meaningful effect on patients’ quality of life. However, several 
studies (including the 3D study) have shown improvements in 
patients’ experience of individualised patient-centred care 
which, as highlighted by NICE, is in itself of major importance 
as one of the triple aims of health care (alongside improving 
the health of populations and reducing per capita costs).

suicidal risk, were known to be leaving the practice within 
12 months, were unable to complete questionnaires in 
English, were taking part in another health­care research 
project, lacked the capacity to give consent (in Scotland 
only, for legal reasons), or if their general practitioner 
deemed them unsuitable to be invited for other reasons. 
If more than 150 patients per practice were eligible, 
a random sample of 150 potential participants were 
selected, their names were screened by their primary care 
physicians to exclude patients they judged unsuitable for 
research, and the remaining patients were invited by post 
to participate.
All participants (patients and practices) provided 
written informed consent. The study was approved by 
South­West England NHS Research Ethics Committee 
(14/SW
/0011) and was done in accordance with the 
published protocol.13
Randomisation and masking
Patients were assessed for eligibility and invited to 
participate before practice allocation, and were not 
informed of their practice’s allocation until they had 
given consent and completed baseline measures. 
Practices were randomly allocated to provide either the 
3D approach or usual care for patients with 
multimorbidity. Random allocation of practices (clusters) 
was stratified by area and minimised by practice 
deprivation and list size. The randomisation system was 
run from the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration by 
the trial statistician, who was masked to practice 
identifiers. Allocations were done in blocks of two in 
each area, with an intervention and a control practice 
allocated simultaneously so that concealment of allo­
cation was maintained. Patients were informed of their 
allocation by post, by the research team. Because of the 
nature of the intervention, practices and participants 
were aware of their treatment allocation. Outcome data 
were self­reported or based on automated extraction of 
data from the electronic medical records, except for 
details of hospital use, which were collected manually by 
researchers who were aware of practice allocation. 
Analysis was done by the trial statistician (DG), who was 
masked to allocation, except for details of health­care 
use, for which masking could not be maintained.
Procedures
General practices in the control group continued to 
provide usual care. In the UK, review of chronic con­
ditions is mainly done by nurses in primary care, using 
disease­specific data­entry screens or templates. Nurses 
often specialise in particular conditions and review 
each disease separately, so patients with multimorbidity 
might be invited to multiple review appointments and 
receive poor continuity of care. Their chronic disease 
reviews mainly focus on meeting the requirements of 
the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework pay­for­
performance scheme.
The 3D intervention is based on a patient­centred care 
model and seeks to improve continuity, coordination, 
and efficiency of care by replacing disease­focused 
reviews of each health condition with one 6­monthly 
comprehensive multidisciplinary review (figure 1). The 
name 3D reminds clinicians to consider dimensions of 
health in a broad sense, depression, and drugs, while 
also alluding to the multi­dimensional holistic approach.
Each 3D review consists of two appointments (with a 
nurse and then a named responsible physician, both 
existing members of practice staff) and a records­based 
medication review by a pharmacist (who might or might 
not have previously worked with the practice). The 
appointment letter asks the patient to think about the 
health problems that bother them most. The nurse 
focuses on identifying the health problems most

important to the patient; asking about pain, function, 
and quality of life; screening for depression and 
dementia; and then addressing the disease­specific care 
the patient requires. Findings are printed as a patient­
held agenda to inform the subsequent consultation with 
the doctor. The pharmacist uses the patient’s electronic 
medical records to review medication, and makes 
recommendations about simplifying and optimising 
treatment. The physician considers the nurse and 
pharmacist reviews, discusses treatment adherence, and 
agrees on a collaborative health plan with the patient. 
The patient is given a printed copy of the plan, which 
specifies how the patient and clinicians will address the 
agreed goals over the next 6 months through routine 
consultations. All three stages of the 3D review are based 
on an electronic template integrated within the EMIS 
electronic medical records system, which reinforces 
the patient­centred approach and is interactive, 
with prompts presented to the clinicians that change 
depending on the patient’s combination of chronic 
conditions.
We used several evidence­based14 strategies to facilitate 
implementation of the 3D approach. All practice clinical 
staff involved in delivering the intervention received 
two half­days of training, and administrative staff were 
trained in a separate meeting. Further details of training 
are described in the appendix. Each practice identified a 
local champion to support implementation. We provided 
practices with monthly feedback about the extent of 
completion of reviews, and modest financial incentives 
(£30) for each completed 3D review.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was health­related quality of life, 
measured using the EQ­5D­5L instrument.15 EQ­5D­5L is 
a generic instrument comprised of five questions about 
mobility, self­care, usual activities, pain and discomfort 
and anxiety and depression, each measured on a five­
point scale from no problems to extreme problems.
We chose quality of life as the primary outcome 
because disease­specific outcomes were not useful in a 
patient population with different combinations of 
conditions, and also because the ultimate aim of the 3D 
intervention was to improve health­related quality of life 
rather than disease control. We also collected data about 
secondary outcomes within three domains: illness 
burden, treatment burden, and patient­centred care. To 
assess the burden of illness we used a single question 
about self­rated health, the Bayliss measure of how 
much illness affects the individual’s life,16 and the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression score17 to assess mental 
health, since multimorbidity is associated with poor 
mental health.1 We designed and validated a new 
instrument to assess treatment burden18 in the absence 
of a suitable existing measure, assessed medication 
adherence using the Morisky Medication Adherence 
eight­item score,19 and assessed the number of different 
drugs prescribed in light of the aim to simplify 
inappropriate polypharmacy. We assessed patient­
centred care using the Patient Assessment of Care for 
Chronic Conditions (PACIC) measure,20 the Consultation 
and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure of relational 
empathy,21 and single questions (adapted from the NHS 
Long Term Conditions 6 questionnaire22 and the NHS 
General Practice Patient Survey23) about the proportion 
of patients reporting care related to their priorities, those 
experiencing their care as joined up, those reporting 
having a written care plan, and overall satisfaction 
with care.
We also defined several key care processes as secondary 
outcomes. We assessed continuity of care using the 
Continuity of Care index,24 which ranges from zero (no 
continuity) to one (perfect continuity) and the Visit 
Entropy measure,25 in which higher values indicate greater 
discontinuity. We also recorded numbers of consultations 
in both primary and secondary care. Additionally, we 
assessed a summary of disease­specific measures (inc­
luding measures of disease management and disease 
control) by measuring the proportion of UK Quality and 
Outcomes Framework chronic disease targets applicable 
to each patient that were met.26 Additionally, we measured 
the number of indicators of high­risk prescribing for each 
patient using an approach developed for a previous trial.27 
Finally, cost­effectiveness and carer experience were pre­
specified outcomes but will be reported separately, as will 
a parallel qualitative process assess 
ment.
Outcomes were collected at baseline and 9 and 
15 months (the primary timepoint) after recruitment. 
Data were collected by postal questionnaire, with 
collection of the primary outcome by telephone in non­
respondents. Data about patient baseline characteristics, 
drugs prescribed and process measures were extracted 
anonymously from patients’ routine electronic medical 
records, except for details of hospital admissions and out­
patient attendances, which were collected manually from 
these medical records.
In light of the nature of the patient population, deaths 
were anticipated. Patients’ primary care physicians 
reported full details of each death, including the date, 
cause, and expectedness of each death, any changes to 
management at the most recent chronic disease review, 
and any possible association between the intervention 
and the death. These details were discussed with the 
independent data monitoring committee.
The protocol originally stated that follow­up time 
points 
would be at 6 and 12 months. The only change made to 
the trial protocol was that the follow­up timepoints were 
changed to 9 and 15 months, before any patients reached 
the first follow­up timepoint. This change was because 
we noted a time lag of approximately 3 months between 
when practices were randomly allocated and when they 
started to deliver the intervention, because of the need to 
arrange training and set up the new processes within 
each practice.

Statistical analysis
The study was designed with 90% power (with a two­sided 
α of 0·05) to detect a difference of 0·274 SDs in the 
EQ­5D­5L. At the time of planning, variability of the new 
EQ­5D­5L was not available; 0·274 SDs equates to the 
minimum clinically important difference of 0·074 on the 
EQ­5D­3L.28 Assuming 108 eligible patients per practice, 
40% agreeing to participate, 80% retention, and an intra­
cluster coefficient of 0·03, we needed to recruit 32 practices 
and 1382 patients.
We did an intention­to­treat analysis in line with a 
prespecified analysis plan for all outcomes, using Stata 
(version 14). All patients were analysed in the groups to 
which their participating practices were allocated. For 
analysis of the primary outcome, deceased patients were 
given an EQ­5D­5L value of zero and missing data were 
multiply imputed. We used multiple imputation by chain 
equations including baseline, 9­month, 15­month, and 
EQ­5D­5L data as available, intervention group, stratifi­
cation and minimisation variables, and other covariates 
that were informative of missingness. We converted the 
EQ­5D­5L scores to an overall index using the van Hout 
method, with 1 representing full health, zero equivalent to 
death, and a negative score worse than death.29
We analysed all outcomes using multi­level regression 
models (using linear, logistic, ordinal, or Poisson 
regression, as appropriate), which included adjustment for 
baseline measures of the outcome, and stratification and 
minimisation variables, with practice as a random effect. 
We also adjusted models considering time­to­death for 
baseline EQ­5D­5L, age, number of chronic conditions, 
and length of time in trial. We did prespecified sensitivity 
analyses of the primary outcome to investigate the 
influence of excluding missing data, treating EQ­5D­5L as 
either missing or zero in patients who had died, and 
adjusting for delays in return of the 15­month follow­up 
questionnaire. We also considered prespecified sub 
groups 
of patient age group, deprivation status, and number of 
chronic conditions. We analysed secondary outcomes 
according to the arm to which participants were allocated, 
without imputation of missing data. Finally, we did a 
complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis to assess 
whether greater attendance at 3D review consultations was 
associ 
ated with improve 
ments in the primary outcome. 
This approach included two analyses with a dichoto­
mous indicator variable for compliance; one analysis 
amalgamated participants with full atten 
dance (two full 
3D reviews with nurse and general practitioner [GP]) or 
partial attendance (at least one review with nurse or GP); 
the other combined those with partial or no attendance. 
The CACE estimates were obtained using instrumental 
variable regression including the same variables used 
in the primary analyses, randomised group as an 
instrumental variable, and the indicator variable for 
compliance.
Conduct of the trial was monitored by independent trial 
steering and data monitoring committees. This trial is 
registered as an International Standard Randomised 
Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN06180958.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Feb 5, 2015, and Sept 21, 2015, we recruited 
33 practices which had a total of 248 488 registered adult 
patients. 9772 (3·9%) were potentially eligible because 
they were adults aged 18 years or older with three or more 
types of chronic condition. Of these patients, 5253 were 
randomly sampled to be screened by their doctors against 
the exclusion criteria and 4678 eligible participants were 
invited to participate, as per protocol (figure 2). Between 
May 20, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we recruited 1546 patients, 
797 of whom were from 16 practices allocated to the 3D 
intervention, and 749 patients from 17 practices allocated 
to usual care.
Participating patients had similar characteristics to 
non­participants, apart from being less likely to have 
dementia (appendix p 3). Both practices and patients had 
similar characteristics at baseline in each study group

(table 1; appendix p 4). Patients were predominantly 
elderly (mean age 71 years) and had a mean of three 
chronic conditions from those defined in the inclusion 
criteria, but had a median of seven self­reported 
conditions from a wider list of 27 chronic conditions 
included in the Bayliss measure of illness burden16 
(table 1). 1002 (66%) of 1524 participants rated their 
health as fair or worse. More than 90% of participants 
had a cardiovascular condition, about half had diabetes, 
and half had asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, while approximately a third of patients had 
depression (table 1). At baseline, many patients reported 
deficiencies in their care with respect to whether they 
had an opportunity to discuss the problems most 
important to them, whether their care was joined­up, 
and whether they were satisfied with care. Only 10% of 
patients reported having a care plan (appendix p 4). We 
intend to pub 
lish elsewhere more details of baseline 
characteristics of patients and practices, in order to 
compare part 
ici 
pants and non­participants, to establish 
the external generalisability of our trial, and also 
to provide more information about usual care for 
multimorbidity.30
Primary outcome data were available for 1361 (88%) 
participants at 15 months follow­up (n=670 in the usual 
care group and n=691 in the intervention group). There 
was no evidence of a difference between study groups in 
health­related quality of life in the primary analysis, with 
missing data imputed (adjusted difference in means 
0·00 (95% CI –0·02 to 0·02); p=0·93; table 2).
Results for measures of illness burden, treatment 
burden, and patient­centred care at 15 months follow­up 
are shown in table 2 (see appendix pp 7–8 for 9­month 
data and full details of ordinal outcomes). There was no 
evidence of difference between intervention and usual 
care groups with respect to measures of illness burden, 
including self­rated health, anxiety, or depression, or the 
effect of illness on life. There was also no evidence that 
the intervention reduced patient­reported treatment 
burden, the number of drugs prescribed, or improved 
medication adherence.
All measures of patient­centred care showed benefits 
from the intervention after 15 months, namely the 
PACIC measure,20 the CARE measure,21 the proportion 
of patients reporting care related to their priorities, 
those reporting care as joined­up, those reporting a 
written care plan, and overall satisfaction with care 
(table 2).
Results for process of care measures are shown in 
table 3. There was a significant difference in the 
Continuity of Care Index24 in the intervention group 
compared with the usual care group (table 3).25 There 
was no evidence of a difference between intervention 
and usual care in quality of disease management (ie, 
number of QOF indicators met)26 or the number of 
indicators of high­risk prescribing.27

by the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework. There 
was no evidence from the CACE analysis that patients 
who attended two 3D reviews were more likely to have 
an improvement in quality of life (appendix p 10).
During the trial, 78 (5%) of 1546 patients died, including 
46 (6%) of 797 patients in the intervention group and 
32 (4%) of 749 in the usual care group. There was no 
evidence of difference in the number of deaths between 
the intervention and usual care groups (χ² 1·811; p=0·18; 
Cox proportional hazards ratio 1·39, 95% CI 0·92–2·08; 
p=0·11). None of the deaths were reported by the patient’s 
general practitioner as possibly related to the intervention, 
and investigation of the causes of death and recent changes 
in patient management did not suggest any relationship 
with the intervention.
The results for the primary outcome were consistent in 
all sensitivity analyses (appendix p 5) and we found no 
evidence of differential effect in any of our predefined 
subgroup analyses at 15 months (appendix p 6).
Discussion
We investigated the 3D approach, which was based on a 
patient­centred care model and which implements 
strategies recom 
mended in international guidelines for 
the management of patients with multimorbidity.2,3,7–9 
Although the intervention was not associated with an 
improvement in quality of life or the secondary outcomes 
of perceived illness burden or treatment burden, and had 
mixed effects on the process of care, it was associated 
with significant improvements in measures of patient­
centred care.
This trial has several strengths. It is the largest trial of an 
intervention to improve management of multi 
morbidity, 
and was rigorously done in line with recommended 
standards for cluster­randomised trials. We recruited a 
population of patients with major health needs: two­thirds 
of participants rated their health as fair or worse and many 
reported clear deficiencies in the care of their chronic 
conditions. The use of broad eligibility criteria in a range of 
practices in different settings enhances external validity. 
The findings are likely to be generalisable to other 
countries where patients have chronic disease reviews 
focused on management of individual diseases. The trial 
was highly pragmatic and reflects the effectiveness of the 
intervention in real­world implementation.31
The pragmatic nature of the trial reflects the delivery of 
care in routine settings, and only 49% of intervention 
participants received two 3D reviews as intended, which 
dilutes the potential effectiveness of the approach. 
However, three­quarters of patients in the intervention 
group had at least one review, which is similar to the extent 
to which patients received chronic disease reviews under 
usual care, indicating that the 3D model was implemented 
as well as were current models of care. Second, only a third 
of invited patients agreed to participate. This recruitment 
rate is typical of trials in this population,32 but raises the 
possibility of recruitment bias. It is reassuring that 
participating patients had similar characteristics to non­
participants, apart from being less likely to have dementia. 
Third, potential participants were selected on the basis of 
them having three or more major long term conditions, 
rather than having poor quality of life. This approach 
would reduce the capacity of the trial to show benefit in 
patients who had few problems at baseline (although as 
previously noted most participants had poor health). 
Fourth, there was some chance imbalance in the primary 
outcome at baseline, but this was adjusted for in the 
analyses. Finally, the large number of secondary outcomes 
raises the possibility of false­positive findings due to 
multiple testing, and the fact that most outcomes were 
based on patient self­report raises potential for bias in this 
unblinded trial. However, in pragmatic trials it is important 
to collect data for a broad range of outcomes of relevance to 
patients, clinicians, and policy makers,31 and the consistent 
results in every outcome domain adds confidence to our 
interpretation of the findings. An initiative to develop a 
core outcome set for trials in multimorbidity highlighted 
the wide range of outcomes that need to be considered, 
and this trial includes most of these outcomes.33
Assessing disease­specific outcomes in multimorbidity 
is problematic because participants have different 
combinations of conditions, but we addressed this by 
assessing the proportion of disease­specific indicators 
from the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework relevant 
to each patient that were met.26 We were interested in the 
possibility that a greater focus on patient’s individual 
priorities and shared decision making might lead to 
worse disease­specific outcomes, but there was no 
evidence for this.
We recognise that the 3D intervention might have 
supported changes in organisation more than it 
supported changing the clinicians’ attitudes on which 
patient­centredness depends. However, the changes 
introduced by the 3D intervention were sufficient for 
participants to report improvements in patient­centred 
care. For example, the PACIC questionnaire measures 
patients’ experience of specific actions, such as being 
given a written list of things they could do to improve 
their health, which reflect high­quality care for chronic 
disease.20 It is possible that the 3D intervention was not 
sufficiently intensive to affect entrenched problems such 
as difficulties with mobility or self­care, which are 
measured by the EQ­5D­5L questionnaire. However, 
other related but much more intensive interventions, 
such as Guided Care, have also not shown evidence of 
improved quality of life.32 Possible explanations for these 
findings could be that current quality­of­life measurement 
tools are not sufficiently sensitive to detect meaningful 
changes or that multimorbidity interventions need to be 
provided over a longer period than studied in this trial 
before benefits become apparent.
An alternative interpretation of our findings is that the 
causal model underlying the international consensus 
is flawed. This interpretation assumes that better

patient­centred health care for patients with multi­
morbidity will result in better health and wellbeing. 
The updated Cochrane systematic review12 of trials of 
interventions for multimorbidity showed heterogeneity 
in terms of the interventions, inclusion criteria, out­
comes, and effects. Results were mixed and inconclusive, 
with little evidence that interventions for multimorbidity 
improved clinical outcomes or quality of life, apart from 
modest improvements in mental health outcomes in 
studies that targeted patients with depression alongside 
physical health problems.
We have updated the findings of this 2016 Cochrane 
review to include more recent studies that reported 
quality of life as an outcome, and identified eight 
additional studies, including this study (appendix p 11). 
Meta­analysis of the results (which should be interpreted 
with caution in view of heterogeneity in type of 
intervention and patient inclusion criteria) provides 
stronger evidence that interventions for multimorbidity 
are associated with little or no meaningful benefit in 
quality of life. Furthermore, a funnel plot suggests the 
possibility of publication bias, with all of the largest trials 
showing no evidence of benefit whereas several small 
studies, some of which are pilot studies, provide positive 
findings (appendix p 12).
It is possible that the 3D intervention, just as with 
other multimorbidity interventions such as Guided 
Care,32 improves patients’ perceptions of the quality of 
their care but not the quality of their lives. Improving 
patient experience is one of the triple aims of health 
care,34 so providing care that is demonstrably more 
patient­centred is arguably sufficient justification for 
implementation in itself, especially since our evidence 
shows it is not associated with disadvantages in terms of 
disease management or hospital use. This argument is 
based on the premise that health care should respect the 
priorities and preferences of patients, and this should be 
reflected in the tools used to assess health­care quality.35
