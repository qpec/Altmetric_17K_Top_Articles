ABSTRACT
The Millennium Development Goals have ended and
the Sustainable Development Goals have begun,
marking a shift in the global health landscape. The
frame of reference has changed from a focus on 8
development priorities to an expansive set of 17
interrelated goals intended to improve the well-being of
all people. In this time of change, several groups,
including the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery,
have brought a critical problem to the fore: 5 billion
people lack access to safe, affordable surgical and
anaesthesia care when needed. The magnitude of this
problem and the world’s new focus on strengthening
health systems mandate reimagined roles for and
renewed commitments from high income country
actors in global surgery. To discuss the way forward,
on 6 May 2015, the Commission held its North
American launch event in Boston, Massachusetts.
Panels of experts outlined the current state of
knowledge and agreed on the roles of surgical colleges
and academic medical centres; trainees and training
programmes; academia; global health funders; the
biomedical devices industry, and news media and
advocacy organisations in building sustainable,
resilient surgical systems. This paper summarises
these discussions and serves as a consensus
statement providing practical advice to these groups. It
traces a common policy agenda between major actors
and provides a roadmap for maximising benefit to
surgical patients worldwide. To close the access gap
by 2030, individuals and organisations must work
collectively, interprofessionally and globally. High
income country actors must abandon colonial
narratives and work alongside low and middle income
country partners to build the surgical systems of the
future.
Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
▸ Prior to this work, the magnitude of the burden
of surgical disease globally had been established
by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery,
the Disease Control Priorities Network, and
others. Five billion people lack access to safe,
affordable surgical and anaesthesia care when
needed and the burden of untreated surgical
disease is largely borne by the world’s poor.
▸ The role of high income country (HIC) actors in
addressing inequities in surgical care is undergoing
evolution and negotiation as the global community
transitions from the Millennium Development Goals
to the Sustainable Development goals.
What are the new findings?
▸ This paper brings the acumen of global health
experts from a variety of disciplines to bear on how
high income country actors such as surgical col-
leges, academic medical centres, the medical
devices industry, and the media can leverage their
unique strengths to promote global equity in
access to safe surgery and anaesthesia care.
Recommendations for policy
▸ Expert consensus and a review of the literature
yielded common principles for all groups. HIC
actors should work in equal partnership with
low- and middle-income country actors and
should situate efforts to improve the delivery of
surgical care within the broader health systems
strengthening agenda. This will help to ensure
that local priorities are addressed and to maxi-
mise
synergies
with
other
global
health
movements.

 INTRODUCTION
In 1980, Halfdan Mahler, the then Director-General of
the WHO, identified surgery as a critical part of primary
healthcare and challenged the global health community
to address the gross inequities in access to surgical care
that were present at that time.1 However, over 30 years
later, 5 billion people—a number greater than the
world’s total population at the time of Mahler’s speech
—are unable to access safe, affordable surgical and
anaesthesia care when needed.1–3 Concerted action
from multiple sectors in all countries is required to
ensure that the world will have made progress in closing
the access gap by 2030.4
Despite clear evidence of the role of surgery in
meeting health targets such as reducing maternal and
child mortality, surgery was until recently dismissed as a
global health priority.5 6 Since 1990, non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) have attracted only 1.5% of develop-
ment assistance for health (DAH), and in 2014 funding
for health systems strengthening received only 6.4% of
donor funds.6 Country-level spending specific to surgical
care remains largely untracked,7 but in countries which
spend little on health, surgical systems are inadequate
for population need.8–10
However,
the
landscape
is
shifting.
While
the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focused on
interventions to improve the well-being of specific popu-
lations, the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
aim to improve the well-being of all of humanity through
an integrated set of 17 systematic goals. In this context,
new evidence has emerged showing that surgical condi-
tions are responsible for nearly one-third of the world’s
burden of disease,11 and that providing surgical treat-
ment can be highly cost-effective.12 The Essential Surgery
volume of the Third Edition of Disease Control Priorities
(DCP-3) identified 44 surgical procedures deemed essen-
tial for public health. Authors argued for the early inclu-
sion of surgery within efforts to achieve universal health
coverage on the basis of a 10:1 economic benefit: cost
ratio.13 Targeted funding towards surgery and anaesthesia
will be critical to reaching the health-related SDGs:14
every Global Burden of Disease subcategory requires sur-
gical intervention at least some of the time.15 In complet-
ing the ‘unfinished business’ of the maternal health
agenda,16 achieving further reductions in child mortality,
eliminating extreme poverty, treating the growing burden
of NCDs or simply ensuring healthy lives, investing in
surgery is imperative.
On 6 May 2015, representatives from around the
world gathered in Boston, Massachusetts, for the North
American launch of the Lancet Commission on Global
Surgery. This launch followed an 18-month research and
consensus-building process involving collaborators in
over 110 countries. The purpose of this event was
twofold: to bring the findings of the Commission to the
attention of high income country (HIC) clinicians and
policymakers, and to discuss a multicountry, multisec-
toral approach to improving access to surgery globally.
The launch consisted of panels and presentations
addressing the role of various groups: surgical colleges
and academic medical centres (AMCs); HIC trainees
and
training
programmes;
academia;
global
health
funders; the biomedical devices industry, and news
media and advocacy groups. Panelists included members
of the global health and global surgery communities, as
well as partners in industry, philanthropy and journal-
ism. They represented both HIC and low and middle
income
country
(LMICs)
perspectives.
This
article
reviews the relevant literature and provides a unified call
to action for each cadre of HIC actors.
COLLEGES AND AMCs: CREATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
ADDRESSING GLOBAL HEALTH INEQUITIES
The world faces a severe shortage of surgeons, anaesthe-
siologists
and
obstetricians
(SAO
providers).
The
Commission found that at least 1.27 million new SAO
providers will need to be trained by 2030 to reach a con-
servative benchmark of 20 SAO providers per 100 000
population, a target correlated with improved popula-
tion health outcomes.17 Workforce deficits are intensi-
fied by unequal distribution of surgical providers, with a
greater SAO density in urban, compared with rural,
regions.18 Therefore, LMIC surgical colleges and AMCs
face the dual challenge of training and retaining SAO
clinicians where they are most needed.
The primary domestic role of surgical, anaesthesia
and obstetric colleges is to encourage and maintain stan-
dards for training, continuing professional development
and ethical practice to promote quality care and patient
safety.19–22 Colleges play varied roles in hospital and
training programme accreditation processes, which are
designed to promote national and regional recognition
of these standards. Achieving this recognition can be
challenging for colleges in LMICs, as is maintaining
funding for college activities.23 HIC colleges have part-
nered with LMIC colleges to overcome these chal-
lenges.24 The partnership between the Royal College of
Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI) and the College of Surgeons
of East, Central, and Southern Africa (COSECSA), for
example, has led to the implementation of surgical skills
courses with a train-the-trainer approach, an online surgi-
cal curriculum designed to meet the needs of COSECSA
trainees, and a training programme for COSECSA
surgeon–scientists.24 Using another model, the Royal
Australasian College of Surgeons has strengthened surgi-
cal training in its region by partnering with the Fiji
School of Medicine, Ministries of Health and the Pacific
Island Surgical Association.25 AMCs serve as a locus for
complex clinical care and research, and they have also
engaged in the global training effort.26 Such engage-
ment has ranged from single-institution relationships to
country-wide

 midwifery workforce, and train 150 new health man-
agers over a 7-year period.27 Further research is needed
to determine how to maximise the effectiveness of these
high-level partnerships in growing a resilient global
workforce.
Recommendations for Colleges and AMCs
▸ Foster a sense of collective responsibility for addres-
sing global inequities in access to care among sur-
geons,
anaesthesiologists,
and
the
leadership
of
colleges and AMCs;
▸ Develop
multilevel,
long-term
relationships
with
partner organisations to meet global training and
continuing professional development needs;
▸ Create
infrastructure,
funding
mechanisms
and
career paths to allow HIC surgeons and anaesthesiol-
ogists to engage meaningfully in global surgery;
▸ Engage collectively in solving technical issues related
to the evaluation and improvement of quality and
safety, for example, by helping to build national surgi-
cal outcomes databases;
▸ Promote health systems and implementation science
research relevant to surgery;
▸ Embrace an interdisciplinary and health systems-
focused approach to building global surgical capacity;
▸ Promote
open
communication
between
colleges
across countries and specialties to build synergy of
results rather than duplication of efforts.
HIC TRAINEES AND TRAINING PROGRAMMES: MOVE
AWAY FROM SURGICAL COLONIALISM
Training a strong global workforce will also require the
integration of global health into medical and public
health curricula.28 Roughly 30% of North American
medical students pursue electives in global health,29 and
up to 94% of surveyed European medical students
desired more global health training.30
31 Trends are
similar for global surgery. Both Canadian and American
surgical trainees are interested in international training
opportunities, up to 92% in one study.32 33 While one
study documented that only 13% of general surgery pro-
grammes in the USA offer rotations in global surgery
(likely
under-reported),
this
number
is
growing
quickly.34 The perceived benefits of surgery rotations in
LMICs include exposure to a greater breadth of path-
ology, learning to manage resource limitations, personal
enrichment, appreciating the global burden of surgical
disease and bilateral institutional benefits.35 36
This type of trainee engagement is not, however, without
risks to health systems, patients and trainees and its bene-
fits can be one-sided. In a survey of Ugandan trainees,
most agreed that foreign visitors improved their education,
but despite conducting research alongside these teams,
none had published as a coauthor.37 Risks to trainees
include occupational exposure to infectious diseases and
the lasting negative emotional consequences of witnessing
the impact of health systems failures on patients.38 39
While it should be noted that these risks are faced by trai-
nees in LMICs on a daily basis, this does not obviate the
need for HIC training programmes to take appropriate
action to mitigate these when they permit their trainees to
travel abroad. HIC trainees may view rotations in LMICs
merely as an opportunity to boost case logs, particularly
for open (as opposed to laparoscopic) procedures that are
less commonly performed in HIC settings. We term this
surgical colonialism, a phenomenon that poses a risk to the
training experience of LMIC trainees, and there are imme-
diate risks to patient safety if HIC trainees engage in
unsupervised work. These risks are only now being quanti-
fied in the literature. To minimise harms and maximise
benefits, guidelines exist on how HIC individuals at all
levels of training should engage in establishing partner-
ships.40 Many training programmes have indeed built rich,
academically productive global collaborations.41
Internationally, medical students have modelled a par-
ticularly
enthusiastic
and
anticolonial
approach
to
health
systems
and
global
surgery
advocacy.42
The
International
Federation
of
Medical
Students’
Associations allows students from around the world to
work
collectively
for
sustainable
development.
Federation membership is priced on a sliding scale
using World Bank Income Groups, with a common con-
stitution and by-laws across income groups. To capitalise
on trainee enthusiasm, and to provide the infrastructure
necessary for sustainable benefit, major universities can
create centres for global surgery and contribute to
global consortia for health systems strengthening.28 43
Recommendations for HIC trainees
▸ Develop broad competencies in global health in add-
ition to deep knowledge and skill in an area of
specialisation;
▸ Engage in immersive training in the language and
society of partner countries, and approach all new
global surgery opportunities with cultural humility;
▸ Reimagine global health work as long-term relation-
ships rather than as projects limited by time, money
and geography;
▸ Prioritise the clinical and research needs of LMIC
partners;
▸ In the conduct of research, ensure that national col-
leagues are represented in the conception, design,
implementation, analysis, writing and dissemination
of results. Include all contributors as authors on any
resulting publications;
▸ When working as a guest in another country, avoid
‘surgical colonialism,’ stealing surgical cases from
local trainees, and conducting unsupervised clinical
work.
Recommendations for HIC schools and training
programmes
▸ Develop and maintain consortia of educational insti-
tutions for global surgery and centres of excellence
for research, education and advocacy;

 ▸ Build such centres in full partnership with institutions
in LMICs, creating space and resources for mutual
learning between trainees in HICs and LMICs;
▸ Consider
competency-based
and
interprofessional
models in global health education;
▸ Endorse global surgery and anaesthesia as established
academic career paths for the trainees and the
faculty;
▸ Provide logistical, financial and mentorship support
for trainees interested in pursuing global surgery and
anaesthesia endeavours;
▸ Provide opportunities for LMIC trainees to learn,
conduct and present research.
ACADEMIA: SUPPORT THE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH BY
SURGEONS IN LMICs
In the nascent field of global surgery, many knowledge
gaps remain.3 13 Only 4.1% of global health research
activity is surgical, and, of all surgical research world-
wide, only 4.3% is relevant to underserved popula-
tions.44 While new modelled data are useful for global
analyses, primary data are required to make detailed
national assessments, evaluate problems and solutions,
and track progress.3 13 This is not possible without the
full engagement of surgical researchers in LMICs, but
human resources for research in LMICs are lacking.
India, Africa and Latin America are home to 42% of the
world’s
population
but
only
7.9%
of
the
world’s
researchers,45 and few new researchers are studying
health systems. Despite the great need for health systems
strengthening in many sub-Saharan African countries,
only 3.8% of health sciences PhD students in the region
study health services and systems research.46 African
solutions to these issues exist, including the develop-
ment
of
a
new
Africa
Center
for
Biostatistical
Excellence.47 This centre is designed to make the region
less dependent on foreign statisticians for competitive
grant writing, advanced data analysis, publication of
health research, and teaching statistics. Furthermore,
the INDEPTH Network has taken up the gargantuan
task of collecting robust health and demographic data.
This is a network of 45 centres in 20 LMICs that actively
surveys the health of 3 million people.48 The data that
this
effort
will
provide
will
inform
health
systems
strengthening efforts for decades to come.
Surgeons in LMICs who wish to contribute to global
surgical research face systemic barriers to conducting
research. The most commonly cited barriers are a lack of
sustainable funding and protected time for research, a
lack of research training, the absence of a culture of
research, the competing demands of private practice, and
difficulties with record keeping and data management.49
Health research capacity strengthening efforts should
work to overcome these barriers while addressing disin-
centives to conducting research, to ensure local owner-
ship of the research and to build trust, cooperation and a
locally relevant agenda.50 51 In this spirit, HIC academic
surgeons can help build a global network of researchers
to make surgical research relevant to all settings.
Recommendations for HIC academic surgeons
▸ Engage in sustainable research partnerships and cede
first or senior authorship to clinicians who work pri-
marily in the institutions hosting the research;
▸ Partner with LMIC organisations to help promote
training in research methodology;
▸ Assist with the establishment and maintenance of
robust
data
collection
mechanisms
for
quality
improvement and research;
▸ Spend time in LMIC contexts to develop long-term
academic relationships with surgeons in LMICs and
understand care delivery challenges;
▸ Align research priorities with those of national gov-
ernments and local partners;
▸ Evaluate solutions to care delivery problems rather
than simply describing the problems.
Recommendations for academic journal editors and
publishers
▸ Encourage submissions of global surgery manuscripts;
▸ Reduce or eliminate barriers to publication for LMIC
authors;
▸ Help build systems and mechanisms to improve
access to knowledge, including by making research
relevant to people in LMICs free for them to access
and ensuring publication in the language of the
country where the research was conducted;
▸ Ensure authorship properly reflects contributions
from LMIC researchers;
▸ Work with academic institutions to help strengthen
the quality of research conducted;
▸ Educate researchers in all settings on hypothesis-
driven, impactful research to improve relevance and
reduce research waste;
▸ Prioritise global surgery research according to its rele-
vance to most of the world’s population both in spe-
cialist and general medical journals;
▸ Provide assistance to develop promising manuscripts,
and/or develop a partnership model to improve the
quality of submitted articles.
GLOBAL HEALTH FUNDERS: RECOGNISE THE HEALTH,
WELFARE, AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN
SURGERY
DAH works: In 2014, health economists estimated that
with an additional US$1 billion in health aid, 364 800
under 5-deaths could be prevented. This figure was
based on health improvements in 140 aid-recipient
countries between 1974 and 2010.52 With concerted
international effort, the maternal mortality ratio fell
45% between 1990 and 2013.53 Improved spending effi-
ciency or accelerated improvement was seen in both of
these examples after the year 2000, most likely due to
improved technologies and better coordination in the

 context of the MDGs.52 54 Projecting forwards from 2015
to 2030, the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health
estimated that the economic benefits of investing in
health systems and services would exceed costs by a
factor of 9–20.55
In the context of health systems investments, safe
surgery and anaesthesia are a ‘best buy’ regardless of
the economic analysis framework chosen. Simple cost-
effectiveness
analyses
reveal
that
surgery
compares
favourably
with
interventions
such
as
antiretroviral
therapy for HIV or bed nets for malaria.12 Cost–benefit
analysis shows that the economic benefits of cleft lip
and palate surgery and caesarean section far outweigh
the costs.56 However, extended cost-effectiveness analysis
shows that simply providing free surgery alone provides
great health benefits but places the poor at increased
risk of medical impoverishment due to the significant
non-medical costs of care.57 58 Even at present, among
those fortunate enough to access surgery, 33 million
face catastrophic spending due to the medical costs of
accessing surgery and anaesthesia care, and 48 million
more are financially devastated by the non-medical
costs
such
as
transportation,
food
and
lodging.59
Therefore, the costs attendant to getting surgery should
be incorporated early into universal health coverage
pathways.
Verguet et al estimated that the cost of scaling up sur-
gical services, at an annual rate of increase of 8.9% in
the number of surgeries performed, between 2012 and
2030 would be about US$420 billion.60 This cost repre-
sents only 1–8% of current annual health systems spend-
ing in LMICs and pales in comparison to the US$12.3
trillion economic productivity losses that will be incurred
due to surgical conditions without urgent action.3 Much
of the funding necessary for a surgical scale-up can be
mobilised from domestic funds; while DAH was US$33
billion in 2012, government expenditures on health in
LMICs exceeded US$700 billion.61 Even in sub-Saharan
Africa, government health expenditures were more than
triple the amount of DAH received.
However, the poorest countries simply may not have
the required capital to invest in surgery. In these circum-
stances, external aid will be essential. Between 1990 and
2014, the bulk of DAH came from the US government,
followed by private philanthropy and the UK govern-
ment.6 Absolute contributions tell only part of the story;
in 1970, the United Nations General Assembly passed a
resolution that each developed country would contrib-
ute 0.7% of gross national product to development
assistance by 1975.62 Unfortunately, over 40 years later,
only a handful of countries have met this target. While
the absolute contributions of the USA are large, it
spends less on development assistance than the average
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
country
proportionally,
at
0.19%
of
gross
national
income.63
New financing mechanisms and new donor countries
show promise in growing the overall funding pool.64 For
example, the Debt2Health model piloted by the Global
Fund may be particularly fruitful in funding health
systems strengthening in highly indebted poor coun-
tries.65–67 This model allows indebted countries to redir-
ect debt repayments towards health initiatives through
debt
relief
agreements
with
creditor
countries.66
Furthermore, an ambitious financing facility in support
of maternal and child health was announced in July
2015
at
the
Third
International
Conference
on
Financing for Development.68 Financing comprehensive
health systems with targeted investment for improving
surgical
capacity
will
require
the
same
global
enthusiasm.
Recommendations for global health funders
▸ Recognise that ‘surgical care is affordable, saves lives,
and promotes economic growth’3;
▸ Provide long-term support to allow for sustained
health systems strengthening with targeted funding
towards safe surgery and anaesthesia;
▸ Promote the inclusion of surgical care early within
universal health coverage pathways;
▸ Recognise that a surgical option is required to meet
targets in most global health endeavours, such as the
movement for maternal, newborn, and child health;
▸ Ensure that all donor funding for health systems
strengthening and for specific programmes such as
national cancer control plans has surgery as an overt,
critical part;
▸ Fund global surgery research at a level commensurate
with the global burden of surgical disease.
INDUSTRY: INVEST IN MARKETS, TECHNOLOGIES AND
TECHNICIANS
Biomedical devices can promote safe, effective surgical
and anaesthesia care from diagnosis to discharge. An
example that has attracted much attention in recent
years is the pulse oximeter, which can decrease the inci-
dence of hypoxaemia during general anaesthesia69 and
is recommended by the WHO guidelines for safe
surgery.70 Up to 70% of operating rooms in Eastern
sub-Saharan
Africa
lack
this
basic
technology.71
72
Technological solutions to surgical problems need not
be complex or expensive: the non-governmental organ-
isation (NGO) Lifebox has demonstrated that robust,
accurate oximeters can be produced economically and
at scale.73 Technology plays a central role in the delivery
of modern surgical care, but there are four salient issues
with respect to its optimal use in LMICs: problematic
equipment donations, a mismatch between government
and NGO purchase requirements and context of use,
the challenge of consumables, and the challenge of
long-term maintenance.
First, donations of equipment from well-meaning orga-
nisations or individuals that do not meet the WHO
guidelines fail early or do not meet local needs. The
WHO reports that a large majority of this equipment is

 never used.74 75 Unused and broken medical equipment
causes hundreds of millions of dollars in unacceptable
waste and is a barrier to improved health outcomes.76 77
Second, whether donated or purchased, equipment con-
sidered for use in LMICs must be context appropriate.
For example, a large number of hospitals (as many as
64% in a study of 8 LMICs) do not have consistent elec-
tricity available.78 While solving upstream infrastructural
deficits
is
important
for
long-term
growth,
devices
should be able to accommodate the present infrastruc-
ture.
For
situations
where
existing
equipment
and
devices cannot fulfil the unique needs of LMICs, the
process of designing tailored solutions should involve
extensive consultation with end-users, as this is critical to
promoting correct device use and protecting patient
safety.79–81 This local engagement can extend to the
manufacturing
process;
HIC-based
companies
can
partner with local organisations to develop and produce
equipment to meet regional needs.82 In appropriate cir-
cumstances, this can stimulate the economy, reduce the
costs of production and transport, and improve the reli-
ability of supply.82 Third, after clinicians adopt medical
devices into clinical practice, regular maintenance must
be performed to ensure ongoing availability; in a study
of over 110 000 pieces of biomedical equipment in
LMICs, 40% was found to be non-functioning.83 Most
problems with equipment can be solved with a limited
set of basic skills and a minimum of spare parts.84 A pro-
gramme
of
biomedical
equipment
training,
which
teaches these basic skills has been implemented by Duke
University, the GE Foundation and Engineering World
Health. In addition to increasing the proportion of
working equipment, this programme generates oppor-
tunities for skilled employment.79 Scaling such training
can be facilitated by government investment and hos-
pital commitment to remunerate biomedical technicians
fairly. Finally, consumables are components that are
intended to be discarded after every use, which in an
HIC context might even include surgical instruments
and sensor probes. Many equipment donation pro-
grammes targeting LMICs focus almost exclusively on
the initial purchase cost of a device, as opposed to the
long-term cost of consumable components, which in a
brief period can exceed many multiples of the original
purchase price.76 To greatly reduce the cost of owner-
ship, purchasers must demand that partners in industry
produce washable and reusable components.
In the light of an estimated 143 million additional pro-
cedures required each year and an active scale-up of sur-
gical systems underway in some countries, equipment
for surgery has become a growth industry.3
60 This
growth creates obvious incentives for the private sector
to engage in LMIC markets. In doing so, manufacturers
have a responsibility to engage in a manner that
addresses the needs of health systems, health profes-
sionals, patients and investors. Finally, as markets for
medical devices develop and change rapidly, the regula-
tory role of national governments must evolve.85 Only
49% of countries have a health technology policy, and
only 44% have national lists of medical devices approved
for procurement or reimbursement.86 Strategies for
regulating quality, safety, pricing and use of devices
require careful context-specific study and implementa-
tion
to promote access
while avoiding unintended
consequences.85
Recommendations for the biomedical devices industry
▸ Supply, design and manufacture high-quality equip-
ment with the context and end-user in mind;
▸ Develop and support LMIC biomedical equipment
markets;
▸ Consider manufacturing locally to produce more
affordable products, improved profit margins and
greater benefit to local economies;
▸ Support
brand-agnostic
biomedical
equipment
training;
▸ Avoid ‘dumping’ used, outdated or discontinued
devices overseas;
▸ Support new low-cost innovations for surgery.
PRESS AND ADVOCACY: USE DATA AND PERSONAL
STORIES TO DEVELOP PUBLIC SUPPORT
Strengthening
surgical
systems
globally
will
require
national surgical planning, the inclusion of surgery
within basic health coverage packages, generation of
external funding where domestic funds are insufficient,
and public education to encourage care-seeking when
needed. In each of these domains, global surgery stake-
holders and the media can play a powerful role in build-
ing public and political support.
Media attention to global health problems tends to
correlate strongly with funding, although causality in
this relationship is unclear.87 This may be related to
the phenomenon that the public perceives diseases
more frequently represented in the media as being of
higher severity.88 Yet what drives media attention is not
the magnitude of a disease’s burden on population
health. For example, paediatric pneumonia, diarrhoea
and measles, which are leading causes of mortality in
children, attract far less news coverage than the Global
Fund
diseases:
AIDS,
tuberculosis,
and
malaria.87
Similarly, surgical disease has historically attracted little
attention from the HIC news media compared with
communicable
diseases.89
Therefore,
global
surgery
advocates must take the lead on actively shifting the
current discourse towards the vast global disparity in
access to surgical and anaesthesia care. In doing so,
global surgery advocates can learn from campaigns for
another
class
of
under-reported
diseases,
the
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).90 News stories for
these
diseases
(eg,
leishmaniasis)
tend
to
cluster
around distinct events such as conferences, scientific
breakthroughs and the awarding of large academic
grants, and are typically driven by selected journalists
with a personal interest in these diseases.90 Global

 surgery advocates must engage in concerted, strategic
media outreach, and build relationships with informed
health reporters.
Gaining political and public awareness requires the
pathos that comes with telling the stories of real patients
as well as the logos of scientific data. Universities and aca-
demics are still the most commonly cited voices in
global health reporting.90 91 Academic global surgeons,
therefore, have an opportunity to illustrate the evidence
base for the expansion of surgical care and direct the
global action plan to achieve it. Media training can help
academic global surgeons achieve the ethos needed to
attract attention to the field. Op-Eds are an excellent
medium to bring together pathos and logos to seed this
ethos, and academic global surgeons have an inherent
advantage in securing placement in top-tier national
and global media outlets due to their expertise and
affiliations.
Finally, collective advocacy will allow for the voices of
surgical patients to be heard above the noise of the
information age. Over 50 organisations within the global
health landscape have come together to form an alli-
ance to advocate for greater political and public health
prioritisation of neglected surgical issues. The Global
Alliance
for
Surgical,
Obstetric,
Trauma,
and
Anaesthesia Care, or the G4 Alliance, provides a plat-
form for member organisations to advocate for import-
ant global surgical issues, bringing structure to existing
informal partnerships and collaborations within the
global surgical community.
The global surgery and anaesthesia community has a
unified message to deliver and has overcome the frag-
mentation that has sidelined global surgery in the past,
both prerequisites to developing domestic and global
political priority.92 There are now data on the costs and
benefits of surgery,3 13 a cohesive set of demands,93 polit-
ical opportunities for prioritising surgery,14 and a set of
time-bound
targets
against
which
progress
can
be
measured.3 These are imperfect and are likely to evolve
over the course of the SDGs, but the global advocacy
effort must unite behind them to achieve success. While
highlighting the ongoing tragedy of the global access
gap, there is good reason to communicate optimism
towards narrowing it by 2030.
Recommendations for global surgery advocates
▸ Recognise and communicate the enormity of the
global burden of surgical disease;
▸ Investigate and communicate the state of national sur-
gical plans around the world;
▸ Capitalise on events such as conferences, large grant
awards, the publication of major reports, and political
decisions to communicate ongoing activity in the field;
▸ While respecting patient privacy and autonomy, tell
the stories of people who still lack surgical and anaes-
thesia care.
CONCLUSIONS
Surgical systems are currently developing too slowly to
meet population need by 2030.4 To accelerate progress,
cross-sectoral engagement is required (figure 1). HIC
colleges and AMCs can contribute the full power of
their training capacity; trainees can engage in collective
advocacy and meaningful research; the academic com-
munity can help to strengthen surgical research capacity
in LMICs; funders can provide the capital required for
broad health systems strengthening and a targeted surgi-
cal scale-up; the biomedical devices industry can drive
sustainable technological innovation, and the press can
build public awareness and support.
Dr Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group,
delivered a video address on 6 May 2015, remarking that
the Commission ‘shows that we have to think in a funda-
mentally different way about healthcare and surgery’s
role in it. Not only is (improving) access to surgery the
Figure 1
A representation of the inter-relationships between actors in global surgery. In this model, the public and civil society
are the ultimate arbiters of universal access to surgery and anaesthesia as a policy priority. The media and surgical advocates
provide this group with both data on the state of surgical care worldwide, and quality human interest reporting on the impact this
has on individuals. Motivated by the double bottom line of health equity and the potential for expanded markets, the biomedical
devices industry can help to solve technological and infrastructural problems related to the delivery of surgical care. This model
posits the role of high income country (HIC) surgical actors (colleges, academic medical centres and universities, clinicians,
trainees and training programmes) as being partners to their counterparts in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). Funders
can seek strategic opportunities to contribute to the development of surgical infrastructure, training programmes and, more
broadly, health systems. Academia in all countries can provide evidence on optimal solutions to care delivery challenges and
also help monitor progress towards universal access to safe, affordable surgical and anaesthesia care when needed by 2030.

 right thing to do morally, but it is also important to
ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosper-
ity’.94 The day’s cross-cutting themes were delineated in
a keynote address delivered by Dr Paul Farmer. First, the
global surgery community should focus on building
resilient health systems. Sustainable surgical care implies
an operating room and a surgeon, as well as safe anaes-
thesia care, perioperative nursing care, well-developed
training
structures,
functional
equipment,
referral
systems and equitable financing mechanisms. To that
end, advocacy on behalf of global surgery should be
integrated
with
other
global
health
movements.
Furthermore, effective advocacy requires both a commit-
ment to improving the evidence on which policy is
founded and communicating the individual narratives of
those for whom a lack of access to surgical care is a dev-
astating reality. Finally, throughout the discussion, the
value of humility and shared responsibility was fre-
quently mentioned, as was a commitment to an accom-
paniment model to achieve global health equity for
surgery. Accompaniment requires a deep understanding
of local context and political economy and a firm com-
mitment to walking alongside LMIC partners until the
task is completed to their satisfaction.95
Following the Commission’s initial launches, several
critical events have generated momentum. First, in May
2015, 23 surgical and anaesthesia colleges from around
the
world
signed
a
document
in
support
of
the
Commission’s vision, findings and aims.96 Later that
month, a WHO resolution on strengthening emergency
and essential surgical care was approved by 194 member
states
during
the
68th
World
Health
Assembly.93
Furthermore, multiple surgical indicators endorsed by
the Commission were included in the WHO’s Global
Reference List of 100 Core Health Indicators, resulting
from an appeal by the international community pub-
lished in the Lancet and endorsed by the Commission
and the G4 Alliance.97 98 Since this time, country-level
data for these indicators have been collected.99 This will
allow country champions to benchmark surgical care
and create national surgical plans to reach targets on all
indicators by 2030. The Commission has been launched
both in India and in South Africa; further ‘National
Surgical Forums’ are planned to build consensus on the
salient problems and policy solutions at the country level
in LMICs. No one stakeholder can alone achieve the
cross-sectoral improvements required to make timely,
universal access to safe, affordable surgical and anaesthe-
sia care a reality. We call on all countries to commit to
this vision to achieve the health, welfare, economic and
equity gains it promises.
