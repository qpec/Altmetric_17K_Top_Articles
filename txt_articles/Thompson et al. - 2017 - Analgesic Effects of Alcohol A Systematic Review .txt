Abstract 
Despite the long-standing belief in the analgesic properties of alcohol, 
experimental studies have produced mixed results. This meta-analysis aimed to 
clarify whether alcohol produces a decrease in experimentally-induced pain and 
to determine the magnitude of any such effect. PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase 
databases were searched from inception until 21/4/2016 for controlled studies 
examining the effect of quantified dosages of alcohol on pain response to noxious 
stimulation. Eighteen studies involving 404 participants were identified 
providing alcohol vs. no-alcohol comparisons for 13 tests of pain threshold 
(N=212) and 9 tests of pain intensity ratings (N=192). Random effects meta-
analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) provided robust support for 
analgesic effects of alcohol. A mean blood alcohol content (BAC) of 
approximately 0.08% (3-4 standard drinks) produced a small elevation of pain 
threshold (SMD=0.35[0.17, 0.54], p=.002), and a moderate-large reduction in 
pain intensity ratings, (SMD=0.64[0.37, 0.91], p<.0001), or equivalently, a mean 
reduction of 1.25 points on a 0-10 point pain rating scale. Furthermore, 
increasing BAC resulted in increasing analgesia, with each .02% BAC increment 
producing an increase of SMD=.11 for pain threshold and SMD=.20 for reduced 
pain intensity. Some evidence of publication bias emerged, but statistical 
correction methods suggested minimal impact on effect size. Taken together, 
findings suggest that alcohol is an effective analgesic that delivers clinically-
relevant reductions in ratings of pain intensity, which could explain alcohol 
misuse in those with persistent pain despite its potential consequences for long-
term health. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings for clinical 
pain states.     Keywords: pain, alcohol, ethanol, analgesia, review, meta-analysis

Perspective 
This meta-analysis provides robust evidence for the analgesic properties of 
alcohol, which could potentially contribute to alcohol misuse in pain patients. 
Strongest analgesia occurs for alcohol levels exceeding World Health 
Organisation guidelines for low-risk drinking and suggests raising awareness of 
alternative, less-harmful pain interventions to vulnerable patients may be 
beneficial.

Introduction 
A link between increased alcohol use and reduced chronic pain has emerged 
from several large population-based studies. Macfarlane and Beasley47 found 
that self-reported moderate-high (11-35 units/week) drinkers were 
approximately two-thirds as likely to report chronic widespread pain than 
infrequent drinkers. Furthermore, amongst those with pain, moderate-high 
drinkers were around a quarter as likely to report disabling pain. This 
relationship has been confirmed in a further study of chronic widespread pain4 
and extends to fibromyalgia40 and knee pain42; although any putative benefits of 
alcohol disappear for extreme levels of consumption72. Moreover, the possibility 
that up to 25% of people with pain report self-medication with alcohol due to its 
perceived analgesic properties56 is troubling given the health consequences of 
sustained alcohol use. However, while the relationship between pain and opiate 
misuse has been extensively studied, considerably less attention has been 
devoted to pain and alcohol use17. 
 
While these findings are suggestive of an analgesic effect of alcohol, causality 
cannot be determined from observational data and alternative explanations have 
been proposed.  For example, chronic pain and alcohol dependence may share 
common neural circuits17 and pain states could affect alcohol usage by 
influencing reward pathways that regulate consumption2. Alternatively, 
deterioration in pain may lead to reduced alcohol intake due to increasing health 
concerns or medication contraindications. Classification decisions of level of 
alcohol use and inaccurate self-reporting may further influence findings41. 
Fillmore et al.18, for example, demonstrated that the link between alcohol use

and heart disease disappeared when reclassifying 'alcohol abstainers' to exclude 
former drinkers.  
 
Understanding causal direction in the link between alcohol use and pain is 
important. If alcohol does produce analgesia, this may encourage alcohol 
dependence in those with pain17, and suggests that efforts to promote alternative 
interventions for chronic pain with fewer negative health consequences (e.g. 
physical therapy, exercise, controlled administration of pain medication) may be 
worthwhile. The use of experimental pain paradigms can help determine 
causality by studying the impact of measured dosages of alcohol on quantifiable 
indices of pain in response to noxious stimuli, and avoids many of the confounds 
present in clinical data58. However, while experimental studies have offered 
some evidence for alcohol analgesia, findings are inconsistent and have exhibited 
substantial variation in effect sizes34. 
 
 As such, our current understanding of alcohol analgesia is limited. This is 
perhaps surprising considering the long-standing acceptance of the analgesic 
properties of alcohol and claims of an analgesic potency comparable to 
opiates36,69. Given the general use of small samples and variability in dosages, 
administration methods and outcome measures in previous studies34, our 
understanding of alcohol analgesia would be significantly advanced by meta-
analysis of existing data to optimize power and provide robust estimates of effect 
size accounting for different sources of study heterogeneity.

We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of controlled experiments examining 
the impact of measured alcohol dosages vs. no-alcohol on response to noxious 
stimulation in human participants to determine the: (1) the existence of alcohol 
analgesia; (2) the magnitude of any analgesic effects; and (3) the impact of 
moderating variables. 
2 
Methods 
This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-P 2015 
statement for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols51.  
2.1 
Eligibility Criteria 
Studies were included that utilized: (1) adults  given a controlled quantified dose 
of alcohol; (2) a comparative no-alcohol control group/condition; (3) medically 
and neurologically healthy participants; (4) an experimental pain stimulus and 
an established pain assessment (e.g., pain threshold); and (5) were published in 
an international peer-reviewed journal or conference abstract. 
 
Studies were excluded if samples consisted of chronic pain patients or those with 
a history of alcohol abuse, as these may represent heterogeneous groups with 
altered processing of sensory or noxious stimuli7.  
2.2 
Search Procedure 
Two reviewers (CO, BS) independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO 
and CINAHL Plus from database inception until 21/4/2016 using the major

search terms (ethanol OR alcohol) and ((pain OR nociception) OR (analgesia OR 
analgesi*)) and a number of secondary search terms relating to experimental 
pain stimuli including 'pressure' or 'mechanical' or 'cold' or 'heat' (see Appendix 
S1 for details). Search results were refined using limits of human studies and 
English language. Additional studies were identified by manually searching the 
reference lists of all relevant articles.  
 
2.3 
Study selection 
After removal of duplicates, two reviewers (CO, BS) independently screened 
titles and abstracts and developed a list of potentially eligible full text articles. 
Two authors (CO, BS) applied eligibility criteria and a final list of articles for 
inclusion was reached through consensus. Corresponding authors were 
contacted up to 3 times over a six week period to clarify results or to request 
additional data.   
2.4 
Pain outcomes  
Multiple assessment measures of pain threshold, pain tolerance and pain rating 
scales were identified as outcomes, as these have been shown to be valid 
methods of quantifying pain that collectively capture different aspects of the pain 
experience27. Pain threshold is the minimum amount of stimulation that evokes a 
report of pain, and pain tolerance is the point of maximum endurance27, and both 
are typically measured in time or stimulation intensity. While threshold involves 
low-intensity pain and is influenced primarily by sensory processes (e.g., 
localization and initial detection), tolerance concerns near-maximal pain and is

strongly influenced by affective mechanisms1. Pain rating scales provide an 
easily interpretable index of subjective pain and typically assess sensory (e.g., 
intensity) or affective (e.g., discomfort) dimensions of pain on a 0-10 self-report 
scale. 
2.5 
Study quality 
Two raters (CO, NA) independently rated each study for methodological quality 
on a 13-item validity scale assessing methodological rigor, selection and 
reporting bias (Appendix S2). The scale was based on items from Cochrane 
collaboration criteria, PRISMA recommendations, PEDro guidelines as reported 
by Ditre et al.11, and was adapted for studies examined in the current review. 
2.6 
Data Extraction 
Two authors (CO, BS) independently extracted and coded study data on a 
standardized extraction form used in several of our previous studies60,62 with a 
few minor adaptations for the current topic. Means and standard deviations of 
pain measures were recorded, along with other key statistical information from 
which effect size can be computed46. The following additional data were 
recorded for use in moderator analysis and to summarize study characteristics: 
sample (age, gender composition, weekly alcohol consumption, familial drinking 
history), alcohol manipulation (dosage, blood alcohol content % (i.e. g/dL), 
administration method), control group (inactive control/placebo), study design 
(within/between-groups), pain induction method (e.g., electrical, pressure) and 
pain outcomes.

A number of decisions were made when computing effect sizes from extracted 
data. (1) When a study reported data from multiple independent groups of 
participants (e.g., with/without a family history of alcoholism), effect sizes were 
computed for each subgroup and included in the meta-analysis as independent 
samples following the recommendations of Borenstein et al.5. (2) A few studies 
assessed pain multiple times in the same participants (k=3 studies reported 
multiple alcohol concentrations, k=1 study used multiple pain inductions). In 
these instances, a mean pooled effect size was calculated for the overall meta-
analysis, with individual effect sizes also computed for different alcohol 
concentrations for use in moderation analysis. Effect size variance was 
calculated using the reported mean correlation of pain scores, or if not 
presented, using an imputed correlation of r=0.755. This value was chosen as it 
represents a reasonably typical test-retest correlation13, was reported by the 
study with the largest sample in the current meta-analysis59 and approximates 
the correlation obtained from a pool of over 300 participants undergoing 
repeated pain testing in our own lab61,63,64. (3) For one study that reported an 
effect as significant at p<.001, a conservative effect size estimate was derived 
from rounding to p=.001. (4) For a few studies (k=2) that applied an 
experimental aggression paradigm, pain scores only from the 'low provocation' 
group were recorded to minimize any potential influence of this paradigm on 
group differences. (5) For one study that reported semi-IQRs rather than SDs, 
these were converted to SDs by applying a multiplication factor of 0.75 based on 
the assumption of normality28.

2.7 
Sensitivity analysis 
Potential consequences of key decisions in the previous section were assessed 
with sensitivity analysis. In particular, the impact of using r=0.75 as the imputed 
correlation when study correlations had not been reported, was examined by 
repeating analyses using a wide range of alternative coefficients in .05 
increments from r=0.30-0.90. 
2.8 
Meta-analysis 
The standardized mean difference between alcohol and control groups was 
computed for each study using Hedges' g formula5. This is equivalent to Cohen's 
d, but with a correction for small sample bias, and can be interpreted in the same 
way, with .20, .50 and .80 roughly corresponding to small, medium and large 
effects9. Effect sizes were computed using the original (unadjusted) standard 
deviations for both within-group and between-groups designs53. Hedges' g was 
coded so that positive values indicated an analgesic effect of alcohol (i.e., 
increased pain threshold/tolerance or decreased pain ratings). 
 
A random effects model was used as heterogeneity in effect sizes was likely given 
the methodological variation typically evident in experimental pain research15. 
Cochran's Q was used to assess the presence of heterogeneity and Higgins' I2 and 
tau (τ) to quantify the extent of heterogeneity. I2 estimates the proportion of 
total variation in effect size due to true heterogeneity, with values of 25%, 50% 
and 75% indicating possible low, moderate, and high heterogeneity32, and τ 
estimates the standard deviation of the different population effect sizes.

Model parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood with 
separate tests conducted for each outcome. Meta-analysis was only performed 
for outcomes when more than 5 studies were available, as fewer studies can lead 
to unreliable parameter estimates for random effects35. Pain ratings were only 
analyzed for studies where stimulation intensity was identical for both groups 
(i.e., where a fixed-intensity/fixed-time paradigm was used), to avoid 
confounding of any group differences in pain ratings with differences in 
stimulation intensity. 
2.9 
Publication bias 
To assess whether overall effect size estimates could be potentially inflated by 
publication bias, funnel plots of study effect sizes against standard 
errors/sample size were examined. If the plot suggested asymmetry due to the 
absence of small sample studies with small effect sizes (i.e., those most likely to 
be non-significant), this suggests potential publication bias. Asymmetry was 
tested statistically with Egger’s bias test16, with p<.05 indicating asymmetry. If 
results were consistent with possible publication bias, a trim and fill method14 
was used. This involves estimating a revised effect size after trimming smaller 
(less precise) studies, and then filling in imputed values from the presumed 
missing studies to create a symmetrical plot and a more accurate estimate of 
variance. 
2.10 Meta-regression 
If heterogeneity was present and data were available for approximately 10 
comparisons or more33, meta-regression was conducted to examine whether the

effects of alcohol were influenced by several variables. Primary moderators were 
blood alcohol content (BAC) and drinking frequency (mean weekly alcohol 
consumption), with the rationale that both factors were likely to influence 
analgesic effects. Secondary moderators were gender composition, time between 
alcohol administration and pain testing, type of control (active placebo/passive 
control) and alcohol administration method, and were examined in an 
exploratory approach, in that it was determined a priori that any significant 
effects could only be considered preliminary. Study quality was also examined as 
a potential influence on effect size, with overall quality ratings and key individual 
design variables of counterbalancing and experimental blinding entered as 
moderators. Separate analyses were conducted for each moderator. 
 
All analyses were performed using the metafor66 package in R54.

Database searches  
Initial database searches yielded 1816 unique hits with 7 potentially relevant 
records identified through manual searching of reference lists. Following 
screening of abstracts, 28 articles were retained for full text review. Three  
author groups were contacted to request clarification of or additional data and 
responses were received from all 3. Overall, of the 28 articles, 10 were excluded, 
with reasons for exclusion and a summary of the study selection process shown 
in Figure 1. Altogether, 18 studies were retained for analysis.

Study characteristics and study quality 
The 18 retained studies comprised a total of N=404 participants and provided 
data for 22 group comparisons, as 3 studies19,21,55 reported data for an additional 
4 independent samples. Key study characteristics are presented in Table 1. Of 
the 18 studies, data were missing for mean weekly alcohol consumption (missing 
k =13), age (k=10), gender (k=3) and BAC (k=2), otherwise all key data were 
reported. The majority of studies (k=16; 89%) utilized a within-subjects design, 
14 of which provided a minimum interval between testing of alcohol and control 
conditions of one day. Mean time between alcohol administration and pain 
testing was 42 mins (SD=17; range=15-90).  
 
 
-- TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE -- 
 
 
The following number of independent alcohol vs. control comparisons was 
available for analysis: pain threshold (k=13, N=212), pain tolerance (k=3, N=62), 
pain ratings of intensity (k=9, N=192) and discomfort (k=5, N=137).  As the 
number of comparisons available for tolerance and pain discomfort did not 
exceed 535, these outcomes are not considered further. The studies that provided 
pain threshold data were different to those that provided pain ratings, generally 
reflecting the experimental choice between a threshold and a fixed-stimulus 
paradigm, where stimulation intensity is fixed for all participants (4 of the 13 
pain threshold studies also reported pain intensity ratings, but ratings from 
these studies were not included in analysis of pain intensity due to inherent

confounding with group differences in stimulus intensity - see Section 2.8)  Study 
characteristics for these two sets of studies are presented in more detail in 
sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 below. 
 
Ratings of study quality showed acceptable agreement across two raters for 
overall quality ratings, ICC(A,1)=0.75, and across individual items (Kappa=0.61-
1.00) with 100% consensus reached where any disagreement had occurred. 
Mean overall study quality scores were high, M=9.9 (on a 0-13 scale), with most 
studies (89%) randomizing order/group allocation and 61% of studies 
employing subject/experimenter blinding (see Appendix S2 for all item ratings).  
 Pain threshold 
3.2.1
The 13 independent comparisons for pain threshold consisted of 182 
participants in the alcohol group/condition and 182 participants in the control 
group/condition (mean age=24.3 years, 79% male). Noxious stimulation was 
applied using a variety of modalities (electric=5, pressure=5 , chemical=2, 
heat=1). Two methods of alcohol administration were used (drink=7, 
intravenous=6), with studies providing alcohol administered through drink 
reporting a mean dosage of 1.07 ml/kg. Mean BAC at testing was 0.079% 
(range=0.058-0.110). Based on the inverse Widmark equation67, this is roughly 
equivalent to 3-4 standard drinks at consumption time for a typical male, or 2-3 
standard drinks for a typical female (where standard drink is based on the US 
definition of 14g ethanol, e.g., 1 x 150ml glass of 12% wine or 1 x 330ml glass of 
5% beer, although definitions of a standard drink varies across countries39).  
Alcohol was compared with either a placebo/pseudoplacebo (k=4), usually a

negligible alcohol dose, or an inactive control (k=9). Overall study quality scores 
ranged from 6 to 12 (M=8.9, SD=2.02).  
 Pain intensity ratings 
3.2.2
The 9 independent comparisons for pain intensity ratings consisted of 174 
participants in the alcohol group/condition and 129 participants in the control 
group/condition (mean age=27.2 years, 98% male). Two stimulus modalities 
were used (electric=7, cold=2) to deliver noxious stimulation with a mean 
baseline pain intensity rated as 5.3 (SD=1.1) points on a 0-10 point scale. 
Alcoholic drink was the sole method of alcohol administration with a mean 
dosage of 0.94 ml/kg. Mean BAC was 0.082% (range =0.047-0.100), roughly 
equivalent to 3-4 (male) or 2-3 (female) standard drinks. Alcohol was compared 
with either a placebo/pseudoplacebo (k=3) or an inactive control (k=6). Overall 
study quality scores ranged from 10 to 12 (M=10.83, SD=0.75). 
3.3 
Meta-analysis: Pain threshold 
Meta-analysis indicated an overall analgesic effect of alcohol versus control, with 
significantly higher pain threshold recorded following alcohol administration, 
g=0.35, CI95[0.17, 0.54], z=3.75, p=.002, representing a small analgesic effect9. 
Figure 2 depicts a forest plot of the 13 individual pain threshold comparisons, 
and shows that only one comparison reported increased pain (i.e., reduced pain 
threshold) in the alcohol condition, with 12 comparisons reporting decreased 
pain.

3.4 
Meta-analysis: Pain intensity ratings 
Meta-analysis indicated significantly reduced pain intensity ratings (k=9) 
following alcohol administration, g=0.64, CI95[0.37, 0.91], z=4.71, p<.0001, 
representing a moderate to large9 analgesic effect. A forest plot of the 9 
individual comparisons is shown in Figure 3. As pain intensity was rated on a 
homogenous 11-point scale in all studies, where 0=no pain and 10=maximum 
pain, meta-analysis was repeated on the raw (unstandardized) ratings. Results 
were, naturally, consistent with analysis of the standardized difference (Mean 
Difference=1.25, CI95[0.70, 1.80], z=4.45, p < .0001), and indicated a decrease 
from 5.30 (no-alcohol) to 4.05 (alcohol) points , or a reduction of 1.25 points or a 
decrease of approximately 22%. 
 
Although analysis was performed on independent samples of participants, 
several studies were carried out by the same research laboratories, inviting the 
possibility of data dependency (e.g., due to a common methodology). Meta-
analysis was accordingly rerun including laboratory as a second-order random 
factor43, with a common coding given to comparisons obtained from the same 
laboratory. In line with the fairly wide distribution of effects sizes from the same 
laboratories illustrated in Figure 3, this additional analysis indicated no 
systematic effect of research laboratory and no substantive change in effect size 
or confidence intervals (g=0.61, CI95[0.37- 0.85], p<.0001).

Sensitivity analysis 
Rerunning meta-analysis replacing imputed correlations of r=0.75 with r=0.30 -
0.90 produced summary effect sizes ranging from g=0.29-0.39 for pain threshold 
and g=0.61-0.69 for pain intensity. This result suggests choice of imputed 
correlation had minimal impact on the effect size estimates. A minimal increase 
in effect size from the original g=0.35 for pain threshold was observed when 
excluding Führer and Hammer22, g=0.39, which used atypical pain induction, and 
Chapman et al.8, g=0.38, which reported semi-IQRs rather than SDs. 
3.6 
Publication bias 
A suggestion of asymmetry in the funnel plot of pain threshold was confirmed by 
Egger's test (p=0.019), indicating potential publication bias. Trim and fill 
estimates produced a revised effect size estimate of g=0.31, CI95[0.09-0.53], 
p=.005, compared to the original estimate of g=0.35. No obvious asymmetry was 
evident in the funnel plot of pain intensity with Egger's test non-significant, 
p=.27.  
 
3.7 
Meta-regression 
Significant heterogeneity emerged for pain threshold (Q=31.61, df=12, p=.002; 
I2=65%; τ=0.26) and pain intensity (Q=42.57, df=8, p < .001; I2=79%; τ=0.35), 
with the values of I2 suggesting moderate to high effect size inconsistency across

studies. Therefore, meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify 
potential moderators. 
 Study quality 
3.7.1
Effect size was not moderated by overall quality ratings or use of 
subject/experimenter blinding for pain threshold and pain intensity, or 
randomization/counterbalancing for pain threshold, p's=.10-.54. Only one 
within-group study of pain intensity20 reported no counterbalancing (with the 
no-alcohol condition always occurring first), so moderation analysis could not be 
reliably performed. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that this study yielded 
the only negative study effect size for pain intensity (g=-0.13). 
 Primary moderator: alcohol concentration and drinking frequency 
3.7.2
To examine whether alcohol analgesia was amplified for higher alcohol 
concentrations, meta-regression was performed with BAC as a moderator. For 
pain threshold, increasing BAC was significantly associated with increased 
analgesia, B=5.50, CI95[0.03, 10.96], p=.048. For pain intensity, one study outlier 
with a high externally studentized residual65 of z=3.84 was excluded, with its 
removal being further justified by this being the only study failing to employ 
counterbalancing20. Subsequent analysis found that higher BAC was significantly 
associated with increased analgesia, i.e., decreased pain ratings, B=9.84, 
CI95[2.64, 17.04], k=11, p=.007. As a BAC of .02 roughly corresponds to one 
standard drink67, regression coefficients were rescaled and indicated that every 
one standard drink resulted in an increase in Hedge's g of .11, CI95[0.01, 0.22],

for elevated pain threshold and .20, CI95[0.05, 0.34] for reduced pain intensity. A 
moderator plot of BAC against effect size for pain intensity is shown in Figure 4. 
 
Values of pseudo-R2 indicated that variation in study BAC accounted for 65% of 
heterogeneity in pain intensity ratings and 25% of heterogeneity in pain 
threshold, leaving relatively low (I2=34%) and moderate (I2=52%) levels of 
effect size inconsistency in each measure respectively. Drinking frequency (mean 
weekly alcohol consumption) was not examined as a moderator due to 
insufficient data33.

Alcohol was associated with increased analgesia in studies with a higher 
proportion of males for pain threshold (k=9, B=0.006, p =.005) but not for pain 
ratings (k=9, p=.36). After rerunning this analysis controlling for BAC, gender 
composition remained significant (p =.043), suggesting any heightened analgesic 
effect in studies with more males was not a product of any differences in alcohol 
concentrations. Time interval between alcohol and pain stimulation, type of 
control group, stimulus modality, method of administration and familial 
alcoholism did not moderate alcohol effects for either pain outcome (k= 9-14, 
p=.34 to .93).

Discussion 
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first meta-analysis to 
investigate the pain-relieving effects of alcohol assessed in controlled 
experimental studies.  Eighteen studies of healthy individuals were examined, 
which provided data for 13 pain threshold comparisons (alcohol n=182, control 
n=182) and 9 pain intensity comparisons (alcohol n=174, control n=129). 
Several key findings emerged supporting an analgesic effect of alcohol: (1) 
Overall pain threshold was elevated following alcohol administration, although 
the magnitude of this effect was small (standardized mean difference=0.35); (2) 
Ratings of pain intensity were reduced after alcohol administration, with a 
moderate to large effect (SMD=0.64) observed; (3) A dose-response relationship 
emerged, with every .02% increment in Blood Alcohol Content or BAC (roughly 
equivalent to one standard drink) associated with heightened analgesia  for both 
pain threshold (SMD increase=0.11) and pain intensity (SMD increase=.20).  
 
Primary experimental studies investigating alcohol analgesia have yielded 
inconsistent findings, exemplified by the fact that only around half of the 
individual pain threshold studies in the current review were significant in and of 
themselves. The use of small samples and methodological variation, especially in 
alcohol dosage, are likely to contribute to this inconsistency and have led to 
uncertainty in establishing whether, and to what extent, alcohol produces relief 
from pain.  The current study represents the first meta-analysis of these studies 
and provides robust evidence for the analgesic effects of alcohol. The reliability 
of these findings is endorsed by the use of sound experimental procedures 
(counterbalancing, subject/experimenter blinding, etc.) by most of the reviewed

studies and with effect sizes seemingly robust to suboptimal study quality. 
Furthermore, analgesic effects are unlikely to be attributable to participant 
expectancy bias, as effect sizes were similar for placebo (negligible alcohol 
dosage to reproduce taste and smell) and standard control comparisons. Pain 
dampening effects of alcohol were also unaffected by method of alcohol 
administration (oral/intravenous), type of pain stimulation and family history of 
alcoholism. Although some evidence suggested that analgesic effects for pain 
threshold may be amplified in males, this finding should be treated extremely 
cautiously given both the exploratory nature of the analysis and that only a 
limited number of studies included female participants. Nevertheless, this 
preliminary finding may have important ramifications and warrants further 
empirical investigation in primary research. 
4.1 
Strength of analgesic effects and implications 
While analgesic effects of alcohol were relatively weak for pain threshold, 
moderate-large effects emerged for ratings of pain intensity at .08% BAC (3-4 
standard drinks for males and 2-3 for females), and this was amplified at higher 
BAC (although analgesic efficacy cannot be ascertained outside of the study data 
range of 0.03-0.11% BAC). These results mimic those typically seen for opiates 
where more pronounced analgesia is observed for suprathreshold levels of 
pain58. 
 
The fact that alcohol analgesia was observed for moderate pain, with a mean 
pain intensity rating of 5.3/10 for the studies reviewed here, may have 
implications for typical real-world pain experienced outside of the laboratory.

Pain intensity ratings of 5/10 approximate several types of acute pain responses, 
e.g., soft tissue injury and post-operative pain26 and chronic pain conditions6, and 
represent the threshold at which pain has a serious impact on functioning in 
cancer pain37. Moreover, the reduction of 1.25 points on the 0-10 point scale 
meets the definition of a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 
0.9/10 (or 9/100) used by several authors48; although MCID thresholds as high 
as 3/10 have also been suggested52. In addition, analgesic effects of alcohol on 
pain intensity are comparable to opiods for chronic pain, with SMD=.60 reported 
in a meta-analytic review23. Collectively, these findings suggest that alcohol may 
be an effective analgesic for non-laboratory pain. However, it is important to 
emphasize that clinical pain differs from experimental pain on a number of key 
dimensions58 and although suggestive, the analgesic effects observed for 
experimental pain cannot be generalized to clinical pain states without further 
rigorous empirical investigation. 
 
One clinical implication of the current findings is that the analgesic properties of 
alcohol are likely to contribute to the increased usage of alcohol observed in pain 
patients40,45. Alcohol dependence may develop based on negative reinforcement 
models of drug addiction68, with pain relief representing the reinforcement, and 
maintenance encouraged by the hyperalgesia that follows analgesia after alcohol 
withdrawal25. Alcohol is also easily accessible and relatively inexpensive and this 
is likely to further encourage its use as an analgesic in preference to alternative 
drugs of abuse or more difficult to obtain treatments. However, excessive alcohol 
consumption can present significant threats to long-term health, demonstrating 
associations with heart disease, liver disease, cancer mental health problems70,

mortality41 and an increased risk for developing future chronic pain conditions17. 
The current findings suggest that the level of alcohol consumption needed to 
provide sustained moderate to large analgesia for persistent or recurrent pain 
exceeds the World Health Organization's guidelines of <20g ethanol (less than 
two standard drinks) a day24. In addition, continued analgesia may require 
increasing levels of consumption given that tolerance to alcohol’s analgesic 
effects with repeated exposure has been demonstrated in rats and is also likely 
to occur in humans25; although a lack of available data on average weekly alcohol 
consumption in the current review precluded an empirical investigation of this 
possibility. As such, efforts to promote alternative pain management strategies 
(e.g. physical therapy, exercise, controlled use  of pain medication) with  fewer 
long-term  health consequences may prove extremely beneficial. At the same 
time, the analgesic effects of alcohol may also provide leads for the search of less 
toxic and non-addictive forms of analgesia. 
 
An additional, experimental implication is that alcohol consumption should be 
restricted prior to pain testing to optimize reliability of pain assessment. 
Although alcohol elimination is affected by several factors, such as gender and 
bodyweight67, an abstinence period of 5 hours may constitute a reasonable 
practical guideline, as .10% BAC will reduce to approximately .02% BAC (approx. 
one standard drink) after this time67. 
4.2 
Mechanisms of action 
Although analgesic mechanisms cannot be determined from the current data, 
animal models suggest that alcohol may inhibit nociceptive transmission

centrally via non-opioid pathways by binding to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptors at the spinal cord level in mice38,50, and similar mechanisms could be 
present in humans. Alternatively, analgesia could be mediated by the anxiolytic 
properties of alcohol55,69, although this possibility has received limited empirical 
evaluation.  Clearly, future research is required to disentangle the mechanisms 
through which alcohol confers an analgesic effect, which could serve as a lead to 
novel treatments for pain.    
4.3 
Limitations 
The current meta-analysis was restricted to studies investigating response to 
noxious stimuli (especially electrical) in healthy participants and this represents 
a notable limitation. Clinical pain differs from experimentally-induced pain on 
both psychological (e.g. affect, perceived controllability)49 and physical (e.g. 
duration, central sensitization)58 components, which may limit the clinical 
generalizability of the current findings. Nevertheless, if alcohol analgesia is 
partially mediated through emotional blunting, it may be that analgesia is 
actually enhanced for clinical pain states given the greater negative affect 
produced by these states. An additional limitation is that a lack  of available data 
on average alcohol consumption precludes conclusions on whether analgesic 
effects are attenuated by previous or chronic alcohol exposure. 
4.4 
Future Studies 
Despite these limitations, the current findings provide strong support for 
substantive analgesic effects of alcohol on acute pain based on laboratory 
studies, which provide a level of control not easily achievable in clinical research 
 MANUSCRIPT

25
and which help establish causality. Further research is needed to determine 
clinical generalizability, and additional insights may be gained with the use 
ischemic and dermal capsaicin experimental pain models that evoke several 
aspects of clinical pain whilst preserving experimental control58. In addition, the 
inclusion of an anxiety measure in both experimental and clinical studies would 
permit an examination of the extent to which alcohol analgesia is mediated by its 
anxiolytic effects. Finally, future studies should routinely assess average alcohol 
consumption to estimate whether analgesic efficacy is diminished with sustained 
alcohol use, and assess the impact of  variables such as pain duration, intensity 
and age which have been suggested to affect the efficacy of other analgesics58. 
4.5 
Conclusions 
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to examine the effect of 
alcohol on experimentally-induced pain. Results provide robust evidence that 
alcohol is an effective analgesic for short-term pain, with small effects observed 
for pain threshold and moderate to large effects for ratings of pain intensity that 
exceed the threshold for clinical significance. These findings provide support for 
alcohol analgesia as a possible mechanism for promoting alcohol dependence in 
people with persistent pain and could help explain the relationship between 
alcohol use and chronic pain. Further research is needed to corroborate these 
findings in clinical pain states and to assess how the mechanisms of alcohol-
related analgesia could be harnessed to develop novel, less toxic and non-
addictive pain treatments.

Highlights 
• 
Meta-analysis of 18 controlled experiments supported anagelsic effects of alcohol 
• 
Small increase in pain threshold, moderate-large decrease in pain ratings 
• 
Higher blood alcohol linearly related to greater analgesia 
• 
Analgesic effects may account for alcohol dependence in those with persistent pain

Key: item 1: Were subjects randomly allocated to groups (in a within-subjects design, was order randomized or counterbalanced)?; item 2: Was there a description of all 
participants who did not complete study measures?; item 3: Were study objectives defined clearly?; item 4: Were the outcome measures defined clearly?; item 5: Was 
there a clear description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria?; item 6: Was there a clear description of the interventions (i.e., pain procedure and alcohol administration 
procedure)?; item 7: Was there at least one control (comparison) group?; item 8: Were all relevant participant characteristics described? (i.e., mean age, sex, drinking 
history, health); item 9: Were complete outcome data reported (i.e., point measures and measures of variability)?; item 10: Were outcome data reported non-selectively?; 
item 11: Was there blinding of subjects?; item 12: Was there blinding of experimenters?; item 13: Were relevant baseline measurements obtained - i.e., recording of blood 
alcohol levels?
