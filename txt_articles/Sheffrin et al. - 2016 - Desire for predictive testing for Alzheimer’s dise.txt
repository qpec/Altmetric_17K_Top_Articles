Desire for predictive testing for Alzheimer’s
disease and impact on advance care
planning: a cross-sectional study
Meera Sheffrin1*, Irena Stijacic Cenzer2,3 and Michael A. Steinman2,3
Abstract
Background: It is unknown whether older adults in the United States would be willing to take a test predictive of
future Alzheimer’s disease, or whether testing would change behavior. Using a nationally representative sample, we
explored who would take a free and definitive test predictive of Alzheimer’s disease, and examined how using such
a test may impact advance care planning.
Methods: A cross-sectional study within the 2012 Health and Retirement Study of adults aged 65 years or older
asked questions about a test predictive of Alzheimer’s disease (N = 874). Subjects were asked whether they would
want to take a hypothetical free and definitive test predictive of future Alzheimer’s disease. Then, imagining they
knew they would develop Alzheimer’s disease, subjects rated the chance of completing advance care planning
activities from 0 to 100. We classified a score > 50 as being likely to complete that activity. We evaluated
characteristics associated with willingness to take a test for Alzheimer’s disease, and how such a test would impact
completing an advance directive and discussing health plans with loved ones.
Results: Overall, 75% (N = 648) of the sample would take a free and definitive test predictive of Alzheimer’s disease.
Older adults willing to take the test had similar race and educational levels to those who would not, but were more
likely to be ≤75 years old (odds ratio 0.71 (95% CI 0.53–0.94)). Imagining they knew they would develop
Alzheimer’s, 81% would be likely to complete an advance directive, although only 15% had done so already.
Conclusions: In this nationally representative sample, 75% of older adults would take a free and definitive test
predictive of Alzheimer’s disease. Many participants expressed intent to increase activities of advance care planning
with this knowledge. This confirms high public interest in predictive testing for Alzheimer’s disease and suggests
this may be an opportunity to engage patients in advance care planning discussions.

Background
Currently there is much research underway to predict
the development of future Alzheimer’s disease. Bio-
markers, such as genetic tests and imaging techniques,
may be a valuable method to accurately predict develop-
ment of dementia before the onset of cognitive impair-
ment. While there are no current treatments than can
halt or meaningfully change the course of dementia, this
predictive testing could provide an opportunity for pa-
tients and families to plan for the future.
Predictive tests for Alzheimer’s disease can take many
forms, including apolipoprotein E genotype testing, posi-
tron emission tomography imaging for cerebral amyloid
pathology, cerebrospinal fluid tests [1], or tests for other
biomarkers individually or in combination. While a few
prior studies have indicated that there is public interest
in predictive tests for dementia [2–5], these tests are not
currently available to the general public.
Even in the absence of highly effective treatment op-
tions, predictive tests for dementia may be useful to help
patients and families prepare for decisions that need to

 be made in the future, including advance care planning.
In Huntington’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative
disease for which there is no treatment or cure, genetic
testing among affected families provides prognostic in-
formation for individuals, provides a feeling of personal
control, and can be used to plan for the future [6]. Indi-
viduals may wish to prepare their family for the diagno-
sis of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline, prepare
financially, or complete advance directives [7]. Addition-
ally, this may be an opportunity to engage patients in ad-
vance care planning at a time when they are already
contemplating their future health, before the onset of
cognitive impairment. Previous studies have shown that
many older adults wish to complete advance directives,
but only a small percentage have done so [8, 9]. Predict-
ive tests for dementia may allow people to make lifestyle
or behavior changes, such as exercise for weight loss or
improving hypertension control, at a younger age when
it may have a greater impact on cognition [10]. Add-
itionally, even in the absence of a cure or treatment,
testing can help individuals prepare themselves and their
families for care decisions in the future.
However, little is known about how predictive tests for
dementia could change future behavior of the general
population. The REVEAL study, which examined the
impact of genetic education, APOE-e4 testing, and a
counseling program for adult children of Alzheimer’s
disease patients [11], provides some important insights
into future behavior. Researchers found changes in some
behaviors (reported changes to long-term care insurance;
and reported change in medication, diet, and exercise
behaviors) [12] and no changes in other behaviors (re-
ported changes to health, life, or disability insurance) [7]
by APOE-e4 or disclosure status. However, questions
surrounding testing for Alzheimer’s disease and resulting
changes in advance care planning have not been asked
in a nationally representative sample of the general pub-
lic. Understanding these issues may be valuable as tests
predictive of dementia are being developed, to guide
their implementation when they become available, and
to gauge the nation’s interest in such tests.
Using data from a large, nationally representative sam-
ple, we explored who would take a hypothetical free and
definitive test predictive of Alzheimer’s disease, and ex-
amined how use of such a test may impact advance care
planning.
Methods
Subjects
All adults aged 65 or older who participated in the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2012 Experimental
Module 6 were included in this study. The HRS is a na-
tionally representative sample of community-dwelling
older adults in the United States who are followed
longitudinally and surveyed every 2 years. During every
cycle a random subset of participants are asked add-
itional questions in an experimental module, in addition
to the core questions asked of all participants.
Measures
Data for the study included questions from the HRS
2012 Experimental Module 6, and were linked to data
from the HRS 2012 core module.
We examined characteristics of subjects who would
and would not choose to be tested, including demo-
graphics, physical functioning, and comorbid conditions.
We also examined subjects’ self-perceived memory and
health, and self-perceived risk of developing Alzheimer’s
disease.
Demographic characteristics included age, race, mari-
tal status, and educational level. We assessed physical
functioning as the total number of activity of daily living
(ADL) difficulties and dependencies based on self-
reported abilities on six ADL domains. We assessed co-
morbid conditions as the self-reported presence or ab-
sence of seven common conditions in older adults
(hypertension, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, can-
cer, arthritis, and stroke). Subjects rated their health sta-
tus in categories of excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor. We classified those answering fair or poor as hav-
ing poor self-perceived health. Self-perceived memory
was rated and classified similarly. Subjects rated their
perceived chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease in
the future on a scale from 1 to 100. We classified a
score ≤ 25 as low self-perceived risk of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, informed by the frequency distribution of this vari-
able in which most people clustered in the midpoint and
very low and very high ends of the scale.
We examined two main outcomes: willingness to take
a test predictive of future Alzheimer’s disease; and likeli-
hood of completing an advance directive or living will if
they knew they would develop Alzheimer’s disease. For
the first outcome, subjects were asked: “If you could re-
ceive a test from your doctor, free of charge, that would
definitely determine whether or not you would develop
Alzheimer’s disease in the future, would you want to be
tested?” Answer choices included yes, no, do not know,
and refuse to answer.
For the second outcome, subjects were told to imagine
they knew they would develop Alzheimer’s disease in the
future, and with this knowledge to rate the chance of
completing advance care planning activities. They were
asked: “If you knew you would develop Alzheimer’s dis-
ease in the future, how likely (where 0 means no chance
and 100 means absolutely certain) would you be to set
up an advance directive or living will to let family mem-
bers and doctors understand how you wish your health
care to be managed?”

 We also examined a secondary outcome of likelihood
of discussing health and medical plans with loved ones if
they knew they would develop Alzheimer’s disease. On a
similarly worded question, subjects rated their likelihood
to discuss their health and medical plans with loved
ones. Answers were on a scale from 0 to 100; we classi-
fied scores > 50 as being likely to complete that activity.
This cutoff point was chosen because a score of 50 and
above indicated participants would be more likely than
not to complete that activity.
Analysis
Health and Retirement Study participants are selected
using a complex sampling design involving clustering,
stratification, and oversampling of certain segments of
the population. We used methods as recommended by
HRS investigators [13] to adjust for these survey design
features and generate nationally representative estimates.
We used survey-appropriate measures of association to
assess how subject characteristics impacted with willing-
ness to take a test for Alzheimer’s disease, and complet-
ing an advance directive and discussing health plans
with loved ones. In the bivariate analyses, the cutoff
points for age, self-rated health, and self-rated memory
were
prespecified.
Because
of
the
complex
survey
weighting, the raw total numbers reported in the tables
may not precisely match their corresponding percent-
ages, because those percentages are adjusted for the sur-
vey design.
The Research Committee at the San Francisco VA
Medical Center approved this research. The USCF Com-
mittee on Human Research exempted this study from
review.
Results
Among the 874 individuals selected for participation in
this substudy, 861 (99%) answered the question about a
test for Alzheimer’s disease. All of the participants in the
substudy were already participating in the larger HRS
study, which administers surveys to respondents every
2 years. In this substudy, mean age was 74 years and
56% were female (Table 1). Overall, 75% (N = 648) of re-
spondents stated they would take a free and definitive
test predictive of Alzheimer’s disease.
Older adults willing to take the test had similar race
and educational levels to those who would not, but were
more likely to be ≤75 years old (adjusted odds ratio 0.71
(95% CI 0.53– 0.94) compared with those >75 years old)
and less likely to have completed an advance directive
(adjusted odds ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.33–0.92)) (Table 2).
By means of context, after adjusting for demographics
and other factors, older adults who had already com-
pleted an advance directive had a predicted probability
of 77% (95% CI 73–81%) of being willing to take a test
for Alzheimer’s disease, compared with 65% (54–77%) in
those who had not completed an advance directive (not
shown in table). There were no differences in willingness
to take the test by level of self-perceived health or mem-
ory problems, self-perceived risk of Alzheimer’s disease,
ADL
difficulties
or
dependencies,
or
number
of
comorbidities.
Next, subjects were asked about their intended behav-
iors if they learned with certainty that they would de-
velop Alzheimer’s disease. In this setting, 87% reported
they would be likely to discuss health plans with loved
ones. Most respondents (81%) reported they would be
likely to complete an advance directive, although overall
only 15% reported having done so already.

ease. Additionally, in the face of a positive test, 87%

to complete an advance directive.
This degree of public interest in predictive testing for
dementia is similar to what has been seen in several
prior online and telephone studies with nonrandom
samples [2, 4, 5, 14]. In a 2014 online survey of subjects
enrolled in an online community interested in Alzhei-
mer’s disease prevention research [4], 81% wanted gen-
etic testing for Alzheimer’s disease if paid by insurance,
and 70% thought genetic testing was important even in
the absence of any effective intervention. In a telephone
survey of 2678 subjects across five countries done in
2013 [2], 67% of all subjects stated they would be some-
what or very likely to obtain testing if it was available in
the future. In an additional analysis, knowing Alzhei-
mer’s disease is a fatal condition did not affect the re-
sults. In related work, Roberts [15] used nationally
representative data from the 2010 HRS to assess to what
degree individuals aged 50 years and older wanted to
know their chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
They found that 60% of respondents age 50 years and

 older endorsed “somewhat” or “strong” agreement with
the desire to know their future chances of getting this
disease. While there are substantial differences between
a general interest in risk and willingness to take a fully
predictive test, these results are generally consistent with
our findings.
Two prior studies of predictive testing for Alzheimer's
disease asked questions regarding advance directives. In
a small 2001 study asking a question similar to our own,
out of 314 US adults responding to a random-digit-
dialed telephone survey, 79% of would take a hypothet-
ical perfect genetic test for Alzheimer’s disease [14].
Additionally, 84% stated that signing an advance direct-
ive was one of the actions they would take after a posi-
tive result. In a 2012 online survey of 772 respondents
enrolled in a national online panel of US residents, 70–
75% would take a test predictive for Alzheimer’s disease
[5], and 51% would sign an advance directive document
if receiving a positive test.
These studies of subjects with high interest in Alzhei-
mer’s disease and responders to telephone and Internet
surveys found similar results to those presented here.
We found similar high interest in predictive testing for
Alzheimer’s disease and intention to complete advance
directives in our nationally representative sample of
community-dwelling older adults. Our findings add to
this existing body of knowledge in several important
ways. Using a nationally representative sample helps to
overcome the limitations of smaller or more selected
samples, and confirms the high public concern and
worry about Alzheimer’s disease as found in a prior
study using the HRS [15]. The HRS is much less affected
by response bias, utilizing careful weighting procedures
to account for interview nonresponse. Additionally, our
ability to evaluate a variety of potential predictors of atti-
tudes toward testing helps to shed light on the factors
that influence desire for predictive testing.
We did not find clinically meaningful differences in
desire for predictive testing by level of comorbidity or
disability, age, or perceived risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
While somewhat surprising, if an individual’s threshold
for testing is very low, patient characteristics may not
affect the desire for testing and overall interest will be
high.
Additionally, high interest in testing may reflect in-
creasing media attention to the topic of dementia. There
may be a general lack of knowledge of available treat-
ments for dementia, perception that they are more ef-
fective than they actually are, or the hope that a
treatment or cure will soon be available. This is sup-
ported by prior work which found that 40% of those sur-
veyed
thought
prescription
drugs
that
prevent
Alzheimer’s disease are currently available [15]. Add-
itionally, many believed there were behaviors that could
be protective against Alzheimer’s disease, with 40% stat-
ing keeping physically active would be helpful and 20%
believing taking vitamins/herbal supplements would help
[15]. These beliefs may account for high interest in test-
ing among all groups of respondents. Subjects may also
desire predictive testing to aid in preparing family mem-
bers for the development of Alzheimer’s disease [16].
Understanding the potential demand for predictive
testing for Alzheimer’s disease may guide implementa-
tion of availability and use of these tests when they do
become widely available. Disadvantages of large-scale
predictive testing must be considered, including the false
positives and need for education or counseling to assist
patients in interpreting the results. Possible harms of
predictive testing for Alzheimer’s disease could poten-
tially include excess worry, employment discrimination,
and ineligibility for long-term care insurance, among
others. These possible harms of testing must be consid-
ered, especially given the current lack of effective pre-
vention and the fatal nature of dementia. However,
engaging patients who present to a physician seeking
predictive testing for Alzheimer’s disease could be a
unique opportunity to discuss advance care planning
with older adults. This would allow them to make
choices and express wishes for future care before they
became cognitively impaired, and to initiate the conver-
sation. Advance care planning is a process [17] and pre-
dictive testing for dementia may be an additional
moment in which physicians can guide patients in the
steps of determining, sharing, and documenting their
values and preferences.
Our study does have some limitations. The question
stem did not clearly include information on the progres-
sive nature of Alzheimer’s disease or lack of very effect-
ive treatments, and it is possible that some subjects did
not have this knowledge. However, there is increasing at-
tention on Alzheimer’s disease in the media, and sub-
jects may still be interested in a test because they have
hope for future treatments or will use it to plan their fu-
ture. We must note that the study question asked a
hypothetical question about a free and definitive test for
Alzheimer’s disease. A perfectly predictive test does not
exist; all tests will have some rate of false positives and
false negatives and no test is ever likely to be truly de-
finitive. However, patients often assume tests are perfect
and will yield definitive results, even when that is not
the case. A clear and concise hypothetical question can
be useful to assess the underlying preferences of the
public regarding testing for Alzheimer’s disease in gen-
eral; those underlying preferences would be modified
based on the nuances, test characteristics, and cost of
whatever test becomes available.
The expressed high desire for taking a hypothetical
predictive test for Alzheimer’s disease may overestimate
Sheffrin et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:55 
Page 5 of 7
 the demand for these tests once they are available,
because people may not act on their current wishes.
Studies of predictive testing for Huntington’s disease
predicted uptake of 50–80%, although actual uptake was
lower when testing was developed [6]. This may be due
to more fears of stigmatization and genetic discrimin-
ation associated with Huntington’s disease [6], although
there are more legal protections for the latter in recent
years. Despite this, the high interest found by our study
and others suggest that even if the percentage of sub-
jects seeking testing is much lower, there will still be a
substantial demand for predictive tests for Alzheimer’s
disease. True levels of advance care planning may also
be lower than what subjects reported they intend to do.
However, the current rate of advance directive comple-
tion found in our study (15%) is very low, and discussing
advance care planning with patients seeking predictive
testing for Alzheimer’s disease is an opportunity to sub-
stantially improve the rates of discussions of advance
care planning and completion of advance directives. Fi-
nally, the question stem describes a hypothetical free
and definitive test predictive of Alzheimer’s disease, and
some may argue that this will never exist. While a test is
unlikely to be 100% definitive, research is being con-
ducted to find a predictive test that is both highly sensi-
tive and specific. Additionally, if the cost of testing is
paid by insurers it may be provided to patients at low to
no cost, and may seem “free” to them.
Conclusions
In this large national sample of 874 community-dwelling
older adults, 75% would take a free and definitive pre-
dictive test for Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, if sub-
jects knew they were likely to develop Alzheimer’s
disease, 87% reported they would discuss future health
plans with loved ones. This interest and the potential for
high demand for predictive testing when it is available
should be considered as these tests become available.
Furthermore, our findings suggest that predictive tests
for Alzheimer’s disease may provide an opportunity to
engage
