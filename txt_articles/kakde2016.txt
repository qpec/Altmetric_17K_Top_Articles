Abstract 
20 
Objective - Known risk factors do not fully explain the comparatively high susceptibility to 
21 
coronary heart disease (CHD) in South Asians (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan 
22 
populations in South Asia and overseas).  The search for explanatory hypotheses and co-factors 
23 
that raise susceptibility of South Asians to CHD continues. We propose “the high-heat food 
24 
preparation hypothesis” where neo-formed contaminants (NFCs) such as trans-fatty acids (TFAs) 
25 
and advanced glycation-end-products (AGEs) are the co-factors.  
26 
Method - We reviewed the actions of AGEs and TFAs, the burden of these products in tissues 
27 
and blood in South Asians, the relationship between these products and CHD, the effects of 
28 
preparing food and reheating oils at high temperatures on NFCs, and the foods and mode of 
29 
preparation in South Asian and Chinese cuisines.   
30 
 Findings and Hypothesis – Animal and human studies show NFCs increase CHD risk. Evidence 
31 
on the consumption and body burden of these products across ethnic groups is not available, and 
32 
comparable data on the NFC content of the cuisine of South Asians and potential comparison 
33 
populations e.g. the Chinese with lower CHD rates, are limited.  South Asians' cuisine is 
34 
dominated by frying and roasting techniques that use high temperatures.  South Asian foods have 
35 
high TFA content primarily through the use of partially hydrogenated fats, reheated oils and 
36 
high-heat cooking. Reheating oils increases the TFA content greatly. In comparison, Chinese 
37 
cuisine involves mostly braising, steaming and boiling rather than frying.  We hypothesise that 
38 
South Asians’ susceptibility to CHD is partly attributable to high-heat treated foods producing 
39 
high NFCs. Research to accrue direct evidence is proposed.

Introduction 
1 
The susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD) of urbanised South Asians remains 
2 
incompletely explained.(1,2)  (Here, South Asians refers to people from the Indian Subcontinent 
3 
especially India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, including those living overseas.) For example, 
4 
there was 62% increased mortality from ischaemic heart disease amongst Pakistani-born men 
5 
compared to the population of England and Wales.(3) Such high mortality reflects high 
6 
incidence, not high case-fatality.(4) Urbanised South Asians’ susceptibility to CHD is 
7 
international.(3,5–11)  
8 
This susceptibility has been linked to diabetes and metabolic syndrome.  The insulin resistance 
9 
hypothesis,(11)  however, does not explain the higher CHD risk in South Asians compared to 
10 
White Europeans.(2)  New ideas include the adipose tissue compartment hypothesis,(12) the 
11 
mitochondrial efficiency hypothesis(13) and the variable disease selection hypothesis. (14,15)  
12 
These augment the longstanding thrifty genotype and thrifty phenotype hypotheses.(16,17)  (A 
13 
short account of these hypotheses is in online supplementary data.) Collectively, these 
14 
evolutionary and developmental hypotheses have not yet explained the problem. 
15 
Unhealthy diets are important in CHD(18–20) and the type of food and its preparation might 
16 
matter.  We have, therefore, formulated the high-heat food preparation hypothesis.  This is a 
17 
cultural, not evolutionary hypothesis and moves in a new direction. High-heat cooking promotes 
18 
neo-formed contaminants (NFCs) such as trans-fatty acids (TFAs) and advanced glycation-end-
19 
products (AGEs).(21–24) We compare the potential for producing NFCs in South Asian and 
20 
Chinese cuisine as the Chinese do not have special susceptibility to CHD, whether in China or 
21 
overseas.(25)  Our search strategy for this paper is in box 1. 
22 
Neo-Formed Contaminants (NFCs) and CHD - human and animal evidence 
23 
We prioritised human studies(26,27) despite their limitations, given our focus on the South Asian 
24 
ethnic group, and NFCs in human foods. Limitations included that food intake data, usually 
25 
based on a 3-day record or memory based-recall(28), do not equate to long-term exposure. Also, 
26 
AGE levels from a food database may not always be the same as in the food actually consumed 
27 
by those surveyed. Nonetheless, evidence that NFCs influence human CHD is strong enough to 
28 
underpin our hypothesis. 
29 
Animal studies show an impact of dietary NFCs on metabolism dysregulation and chronic 
30 
diseases and improvement when NFCs are limited(29–32).  A 50% decrease in diet NFCs could 
31 
extend animal lifespan(33).  
32 
Box 1 and figure 1 summarises the nature and action of AGEs and TFAs, which affect 
33 
health.(34)  Human and animal studies highlight that AGEs act through reactive oxygen species 
34 
and receptors to alter intra- and extracellular proteins, and calcium channels, resulting in 
35 
endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress, which may lead to hypertension and 
36 
atherosclerosis.(35–43)  Figure 1 also shows effects on CHD via insulin resistance and diabetes. 
37 
(35–43)   
38 
AGE-rich meals contribute to body AGE content and circulating AGEs.  The study by Birlouez-
39 
Aragon et al  investigated diets with high versus low NFCs on indicators of cardiovascular and 
40 
diabetes risk.(26) Plasma HDL and total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulinemia and

HOMA were higher after the 4-week high NFC diet compared to the low NFC diet, while 
1 
vitamins C and E were lower. Lower vitamins E and C suggested oxidative stress.(26,44)  
2 
Animal evidence shows an increase in AGEs leads to intimal thickening of the aorta,(45) 
3 
increased vascular permeability and dysfunction(46) and increased intimal hyperplasia.(47) AGE 
4 
deposition is more pronounced within atherosclerotic plaques than normal arterial walls, with 
5 
atherosclerotic changes correlating with AGE deposition.(48,49)  The mechanisms include 
6 
reduction of nitric oxide activity, interaction with specific receptors, and oxidising LDL-c. AGEs 
7 
contribute to disease through expression of procoagulant activity and the production of reactive 
8 
oxygen species leading to increased endothelial expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion 
9 
molecules. (50) 
10 
While an optimal dietary AGE intake is unclear, over 15,000-16,000kU/day is considered to 
11 
increase risk of CHD.(27,51) Uribarri et al  suggest reducing AGEs by lowering cooking 
12 
temperatures. (27)  
13 
TFA consumption is associated with CHD in humans. (52)  Figure 2 adapted from Centre for 
14 
Research on Nutrition Support Systems summarises the link of TFAs to CHD. (53)   TFAs 
15 
increase LDL-c while decreasing HDL-c.(54,55) TFA-rich diets increase activity of cholesteryl 
16 
ester transfer protein, which transfers cholesterol esters from HDL-c to LDL-c and VLDL-c. (56) 
17 
TFAs are associated with markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, including 
18 
soluble intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, e-selectin,(57) soluble TNF-α 
19 
receptors,(58) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. TFAs are pro-
20 
inflammatory, leading to atherosclerosis, diabetes, and sudden death due to heart failure.(56,58)  
21 
TFAs influence adipocytes, reducing triglyceride uptake and increasing production of free fatty 
22 
acids.(59,60)  TFAs raise the fasting triglyceride levels(61), decrease insulin sensitivity and are 
23 
associated with metabolic syndrome (including in animals)(62–64) promoting insulin resistance 
24 
and abdominal adiposity.(65)  
25 
Approximately 5g/day of TFA is associated with a 23% increase in the risk of CHD.(66)  The 
26 
Food Safety and Standard Authority of India  advocates a TFA<10% in hydrogenated vegetable 
27 
oils.(67)  The consensus dietary guidelines for Asian Indians recommend a TFA level of <1% of 
28 
daily energy intake.(68) 
29 
Evidence for the high-heat food preparation hypothesis: Indian and Chinese cuisine  
30 
If NFCs in food produced during cooking increase South Asians’ susceptibility to CHD, they 
31 
should be both comparatively high in diets and body tissues and associated with CHD in South 
32 
Asians. Our literature searches yielded no data on this. We have, therefore, supported our 
33 
hypothesis on indirect observations we compiled on cuisine and cooking methods (tables 1-3) 
34 
and recently published empirical data on oils and TFA’s (table 4)(69). The data on Indian and 
35 
Chinese cuisines in relation to NFCs were also limited. (70–72)   We acknowledge the 
36 
limitations of the evidence underpinning this hypothesis. 
37 
 South Asian food is diverse, therefore pragmatically, we focus on Indian cuisine as an example, 
38 
compared with Chinese cuisine. Table 1 shows the methods of food preparation, estimated 
39 
frequency of use and the estimated temperatures reached during food preparation.    Indian

cuisine can be, crudely, divided as South and North.  South Indian diet is founded on rice with 
1 
sambhar. Sesame, peanut, vegetable, coconut oil and ghee are the primary fats used.  Vanaspati 
2 
(partially hydrogenated fats), a major source of TFA, frequently replaces ghee.  North Indians 
3 
predominantly eat a wheat-based diet consisting of rotis, vegetables cooked with ghee, chicken 
4 
and mutton and milk and yoghurt.(73)  Roasting and frying are the main cooking methods.  
5 
Ghee, vanaspati, butter and nuts are widely used.   
6 
 
7 
Deep fried snacks eaten across India include pakora, samosa etc.  Currently, there is a nutritional 
8 
transition in India with an increase in meat, sugar and fat consumption,(74) and a shift towards 
9 
‘fast-food’ cooked at high-heat .  
10 
 
11 
Traditional Indian cooking involves frying and browning.  Most Indian food is spice based and 
12 
meat/vegetables are cooked in a sauce after frying the base ingredients (“curry”). Such foods 
13 
have high NFCs(75,76) compared to, for example, boiling, (e.g. chicken curry-
14 
6340kUAGE/100mg ; boiled chicken-1123kUAGE/100mg).(27,51)  Indians drink tea and 
15 
coffee, usually with boiled full-fat milk heated for prolonged periods, this increases the AGE 
16 
levels. Roasting coffee beans also increases AGEs.(77) Indians are consuming modern fast-foods 
17 
containing high levels of NFCs (e.g. pizza~6824kU/100g).(27)  French fries produce about 
18 
843kU/100g of AGEs.(27)  
19 
Fats and oils are important in Indian cuisine. The National Sample Survey reported that in India 
20 
oils and fats accounted for about 25% of calorie intake.(78) High socio-economic status people, 
21 
the group in which the CHD epidemic appears first in South Asians,(79) had higher 
22 
consumption. Fat intake in the top decile social class of the urban sector at >83g, for example, 
23 
was about three times that in the lowest decile class (21.4g).(78)  
24 
Consumption of beverages, biscuits, processed foods, salted snacks, prepared sweets and other 
25 
purchased foods constituted 100-427 gm/capita/day, from the lowest to the highest expenditure 
26 
class. These are foods rich in NFCs in India. (80) 
27 
Table-3 reports data on TFA content of some commonly consumed snacks and sweets in 
28 
India.(67,70,81,82)  TFA consumption through vanaspati and ghee alone amongst North Indians 
29 
was over 1% and 0.75% of total energy in men and women respectively, and 1.1 % among 
30 
adolescents. TFA in hydrogenated vegetable oil was 1.95 times the Food Safety and Standards 
31 
Authority of India (FSSAI) limit.(83) TFA consumption among South Asians likely exceeds 
32 
WHO’s recommendations of <1% of daily energy intake.(68)   
33 
Ingestion of re-used oil/fat used for deep frying, increases NFCs and endothelial 
34 
dysfunction.(84,85)   We have included in table 4 data showing TFA formation during the 
35 
process of frying at different temperatures with four oils commonly used in India and TFA 
36 
formation during oil re-use.(69) TFA formation increased during frying at different temperatures 
37 
and further after re-heating.   
38 
Traditional snacks such as chaat and samosa prepared from vanaspathi further increase TFA 
39 
levels.(70)  Packaged Indian snacks had high TFA content.(81) Additionally, TFA content in 
40

7 
 
popular fast-food outlets in South Asia was higher than in equivalent outlets in China, USA and 
1 
UK.(86) Table 2 shows the AGEs of some foods commonly eaten by Indians.(27,51) 
2 
In general, people from Northern China eat wheat-based foods, while their southern counterparts 
3 
eat rice-based foods.(87,88) Chinese cuisine includes frying, but food is mainly cooked by 
4 
braising, steaming and boiling which produce less NFCs given the lower cooking temperatures 
5 
and lower fat content.(87,88)  Table 1 compares Indian and Chinese cooking methods in relation 
6 
to temperature to highlight the differences in cooking temperatures. With the exception of frying, 
7 
traditional Chinese cooking uses temperatures <130°C, lower than that needed for the rapid 
8 
formation of NFCs i.e.>150°C.(77)  
9 
Herbal tea, popularly consumed by the Chinese, may have cardio-protective effects.  Research 
10 
has demonstrated that the catechin present in green tea is inversely associated with mortality due 
11 
to CHD and associated with a 20% reduction in CHD mortality risk.(89,90) These ways of 
12 
drinking tea are different from India, and less likely to produce NFCs. 
13 
Compared to Indians, Chinese consume less fried and baked foods, reducing their exposure to 
14 
NFCs.(91) Fu et al reported that 80% of western-style snacks contained 1.44%-12.07% TFAs 
15 
while 67% of Chinese snacks contain less than 0.83%TFAs.(92)  Table 3 describes some of the 
16 
typical bakery foods in China and their TFA content.(82)  The China National Center for Food 
17 
Safety Risk Assessment found that TFA averaged 0.16% of the energy intake.  Even in Beijing 
18 
and Guangzhou, where higher levels are consumed, TFA account for only 0.34% of total energy 
19 
intake, lower than recommended.(93)  
20 
The INTERHEART study highlighted that a diet high in tofu and soy (Chinese cuisine) had no 
21 
association with CHD while a diet high in fried foods (Indian cuisine) nearly doubled the 
22 
risk.(18)  
23 
 Based on the differences in cuisine, cooking techniques, cooking temperatures and lower oil 
24 
utilization in Chinese cuisine, we infer that Indian cuisine contains higher levels of NFCs 
25 
compared to Chinese, and if so, this supports our hypothesis. 
26 
Testing the high-heat food preparation hypothesis and conclusions 
27 
Our hypothesis, outlined in figure 3, proposes that high-heat food preparation is a potentially 
28 
important risk factor for South Asians.  Despite searching for evidence carefully (box 1), at this 
29 
point, our hypothesis can only be supported indirectly as no direct, comparative studies of either 
30 
NFCs in South Asian cuisine, body or plasma NFC burdens, or on the relationship between 
31 
NFCs and the relevant disease outcomes in South Asians were found.  We recommend ways of 
32 
testing the hypothesis, primarily using human population-based research. (Animal research, 
33 
invaluable as it is in elucidating mechanisms, cannot contribute to understanding ethnic 
34 
variations in CHD.)  
35 
Given limited data available on NFCs in South Asians and their diets, ongoing and new studies 
36 
on NFCs in humans should recruit South Asian populations.  These studies might also include 
37 
NFCs and other substances increased by heat.(94) Cross-sectional studies should examine NFCs 
38 
in diet using techniques such as a food frequency questionnaire, food diary and duplicate diet 
39 
methods amongst South Asians and their Chinese/European counterparts. The studies should 
40

8 
 
examine cooking practices especially heating/frying of foods and re-use of oils. They should also 
1 
measure NFCs and other cardiovascular risk biomarkers in plasma. We hypothesise that both in 
2 
body tissues and dietary content NFCs will be higher in South Asians living in industrialised 
3 
countries than their counterparts in India, and higher in South Asians than in many other 
4 
populations including the European origin White and Chinese populations, and higher in South 
5 
Asians with CHD than those without. We also predict an association between plasma TFA and 
6 
AGE levels and biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk in South Asians.(57,65,95,96)   
7 
Assuming the evidence accrued is supportive, the next step would be a case-control study which 
8 
includes individuals with and without CHD and assesses the level of NFCs (TFAs and AGEs) in 
9 
cases and controls in South Asians and comparison ethnic groups. The hypothesis would be that 
10 
South Asians with CHD had higher levels of NFCs than controls.  
11 
Small-scale, experimental, diet control studies on South Asian volunteers could examine the 
12 
effect of NFCs on intermediate indicators of cardiovascular risk e.g. endothelial dysfunction.  
13 
Important trials of this kind have been done on volunteers elsewhere.(26) 
14 
If new evidence supports the hypothesis, we recommend NFCs consumption and body burden be 
15 
measured in cohort studies, where South Asians (without CHD) can be followed up.  We 
16 
hypothesize that the sub-groups with higher consumption and body burden would develop more 
17 
intermediate outcomes e.g. endothelial dysfunction, and in the long term, incident CHD.  
18 
Randomised controlled trials on community samples with disease and points are not currently 
19 
justified, as evidence is not strong enough, but such studies will be required before public health 
20 
policy advocates change in high-heat cooking practices. 
21 
We acknowledge the limitations of this review and the hypothesis. We do not propose the 
22 
hypothesis is the complete answer but may be contributory. Our analysis of the health effects of 
23 
NFCs, the evidence that high-heat cooking induces NFCs, empirical evidence on heating oils in 
24 
the production of TFAs (table 4)(69), and the compiled evidence on cooking practices in Indian 
25 
and Chinese cuisine (tables 1-3), justify debating and then testing our hypothesis.

Text Box 1 - Search Methodology 
We searched for information on high heat cooking, specifically TFAs and AGEs, on CHD on Medline, PubMed and 
Google (for grey literature).  The key search terms used were neo-formed contaminants, Maillard reaction products, 
advanced glycation end products, trans fatty acids, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.  We examined reference 
lists of key articles to identify additional data sources.  Key journals based on the articles found were also screened 
(i.e. Journal of Food Science; Food Chemistry etc.) for relevant articles. 
Due to the scarcity of literature on NFC levels in both Chinese and South Asian Foods, we reviewed grey literature.  
Articles on NFCs in both South Asian and Chinese food were reviewed  
We employed informal methods e.g. meeting experts via conferences such as European Food Information Resource; 
subscribing to INFOODS mail list (an international network of Food Data Systems with a worldwide network of food 
composition experts); searching the International Maillard Reaction Society (IMARS) website, and contacting Dr 
ReykoInagi, the President of IMARS.  We took advice from colleagues, Antonis Vlassopoulos, currently working on 
AGEs and Fu-Shing Lee who gave expert insight on Chinese food preparation methods.

Text Box 2 - A Brief Introduction to Neo-Formed Contaminants (NFCs) 
Thermal treatments of food (whether commercial or at home) contribute to the development of NFCs.  These 
compounds are not external, but are formed naturally during thermal processing of food through complex 
chemical reactions resulting in the formation of various NFCs i.e. trans fatty acids (TFAs) and Maillard reaction 
products (MRPs) including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and acrylamide. NFCs formation is 
directly proportional to heat-treatment during food processing. 
TFAs: are fatty acids that contain at least one non-conjugated double bond in the trans configuration i.e. the 
hydrogen is on both sides of the carbon atom.  A series of changes occurs when oil undergoes thermal treatment 
- (i) degradation of fatty acids, (ii) increase in free fatty acids, and (iii) conversion of some unsaturated fatty 
acids into saturated and TFAs.  They are formed during the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils and in small 
amounts during refining of vegetable oils.  Additionally significant amounts of TFAs are also present when 
oil/fats are re-used.  Owing to their harmful effects on human health, TFAs have been banned in several 
countries, however they continue to be a significant part of the diets in South Asian countries. 
 
AGEs: Thermal treatments (such as frying) achieve high temperatures of over 150ºC/170ºC, helping to break 
down carbohydrates and proteins to monosaccharides and amino acids, respectively, the primary ingredients 
required for the Maillard reaction, which through a series of reactions forms the Schiff bases and Amadori 
products that undergo slow rearrangement, dehydration, and condensation reactions to form irreversible 
compounds called AGEs.  These reactions produce the desirable quality of fried foods contributing to their 
characteristic texture, aroma, brown colour and flavours.  AGEs can be absorbed in the gastrointestinal system, 
contributing to the total AGE body burden.  One of the most studied AGES is N-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML).

Highlights - Urbanised South Asians’ Susceptibility to Coronary Heart Disease: The 
High-Heat Food Preparation Hypothesis 
• 
Known risk factors do not fully explain the high prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) 
amongst South Asians. 
• 
High heat cooking, common in South Asian cuisine, leads to an increased production of neo-
formed contaminants (NFCs) including advanced glycation-end products (AGE) and trans 
fatty acids (TFAs)  
• 
NFCs produce biochemical and microanatomical alterations enhancing the effects of 
traditional CHD risk factors 
• 
This phenomenon (high-heat food preparation hypothesis) is responsible for the increased 
risk of CHD in South Asians compared to other populations with lower heat cooking
