abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Poorly designed labels and packaging are key contributors to 
medication errors. To identify attributes of labels and dosing tools that could be improved, 
we examined the extent to which dosing error rates are affected by tool characteristics (ie, 
type, marking complexity) and discordance between units of measurement on labels and 
dosing tools; along with differences by health literacy and language.
METHODS: Randomized controlled experiment in 3 urban pediatric clinics. English- or 
Spanish-speaking parents (n = 2110) of children ≤8 years old were randomly assigned 
to 1 of 5 study arms and given labels and dosing tools that varied in unit pairings. Each 
parent measured 9 doses of medication (3 amounts [2.5, 5, and 7.5 mL] and 3 tools [1 cup, 
2 syringes (0.2- and 0.5-mL increments)]), in random order. Outcome assessed was dosing 
error (>20% deviation; large error defined as > 2 times the dose).
RESULTS: A total of 84.4% of parents made ≥1 dosing error (21.0% ≥1 large error). More 
errors were seen with cups than syringes (adjusted odds ratio = 4.6; 95% confidence 
interval, 4.2–5.1) across health literacy and language groups (P < .001 for interactions), 
especially for smaller doses. No differences in error rates were seen between the 2 syringe 
types. Use of a teaspoon-only label (with a milliliter and teaspoon tool) was associated with 
more errors than when milliliter-only labels and tools were used (adjusted odds ratio = 1.2; 
95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Recommending oral syringes over cups, particularly for smaller doses, should 
be part of a comprehensive pediatric labeling and dosing strategy to reduce medication 
errors.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Despite studies 
showing that >40% of parents make errors dosing 
liquid medications, there has been limited focus to 
date on identifying specifi
 c attributes of pediatric 
labels and dosing tools that could be improved to 
reduce the likelihood of error.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Signifi
 cant reductions 
in dosing errors would probably result if parent 
oral syringe use was promoted over dosing cups, 
especially when smaller doses are recommended. 
Avoidance of teaspoon alone on medication labels 
may also be helpful in decreasing errors.

Over the past decade, growing 
attention has been paid to the 
problem of unintentional medication 
errors resulting from suboptimal 
drug labeling and medication 
packaging. 
1 
 
 
 
– 
7 Although considerable 
progress has been attained in making 
labeling improvements for adult 
medications, 
 
3, 
 
8 
– 
11 to date there has 
been limited work incorporating a 
pediatric perspective, despite studies 
documenting parent dosing error 
rates of ≥40%. 
12 
 
– 
16 Lack of evidence 
regarding best practices has been 
a barrier to establishing standards 
related to the labeling and dosing of 
pediatric medications. 
17
Unlike most prescription drugs taken 
by adults, pediatric medications are 
unique in their reliance on liquid 
formulations. 
18 With oral liquid 
medicines, parents must choose 
an appropriate tool with which to 
measure and administer medicine to 
their children. 
14 In addition, a range 
of measurement units (eg, milliliter, 
teaspoon, tablespoon), along with 
their associated abbreviations, are 
used as part of instructions on labels 
and dosing tools, contributing to 
confusion and multifold errors. 
7, 
 
14, 
19 
– 
21
To promote dosing accuracy, both 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) and the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) recommend 
that parents use dosing tools with 
standard markings (eg, oral syringes, 
droppers, dosing cups) rather than 
nonstandard kitchen spoons, which 
vary widely in size and shape. 
19, 
 
21 
 
–24 
However, no national guidelines exist 
regarding which type of tool should 
be provided to families. Oral syringes 
are considered the gold standard 
when accuracy is critical. 
14, 
 
25 
– 
27 Cups 
are most frequently included with 
over-the-counter (OTC) products.28 
Several studies have found that 
cups are associated with higher 
rates of parent errors, but they were 
limited in scope with respect to the 
range of dose amounts tested and 
aspects such as complexity of tool 
markings. 
14, 
 
27, 
 
29
Unit of measurement discordance 
has become an issue of concern for 
prescription and OTC medicines. 
19, 
 
29 
One study of top-selling OTC pediatric 
products found that nearly 90% had 
a mismatch in units between the label 
and dosing tool, 
 
28 before a 2009 FDA 
guidance for industry was issued. 
22 
A study of prescribed products found 
that more than a third of the time, 
the label did not contain the same 
units as the prescription.13 Recently, 
the AAP issued a policy statement 
endorsing a move to a milliliter-
exclusive system and avoidance 
of terms such as teaspoon and 
tablespoon, 
 
7 a stance consistent with 
that of other organizations, including 
the FDA and the American Academy of 
Family Physicians, 
 
20, 
 
30 
–32 but there are 
concerns that such a move could result 
in greater confusion because parents 
may be comfortable dosing using 
teaspoon and tablespoon terms and 
unfamiliar with milliliter units 
7, 
 
13; the 
United States has had a long-standing 
dependence on nonmetric units. 
33
In this study, we sought to fill gaps 
in evidence about best practices for 
the labeling and dosing of pediatric 
liquid medications. Specifically, we 
examined the extent to which rates 
of parent dosing errors are affected 
by discordance in unit pairing on 
the label and tool and by dosing tool 
characteristics (ie, type, marking 
complexity). We hypothesized that 
unit concordance would be associated 
with fewer errors and that parents 
would measure most accurately with 
syringes. We also sought to examine 
differences in impact by parent health 
literacy and language, because low 
health literacy and limited English 
proficiency are factors known to 
place children at risk for error.

METHODS
Participants, Recruitment, and 
Randomization
This was a randomized controlled 
experiment to examine the degree to 
which specific attributes of medication 
labels and dosing tools affect parent 
errors in dosing liquid medicines. 
As part of the SAFE Rx for Kids (Safe 
Administration for Every Prescription 
for Kids) study, subjects were enrolled 
from pediatric outpatient clinics at 
Bellevue (New York, NY), Gardner 
Packard Children’s Health Care 
Center (Stanford, CA), and Children’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta at Hughes 
Spalding (Atlanta, GA). Institutional 
review board approval was obtained 
from each site.
During clinic hours when enrollment 
took place, research assistants (RAs) 
consecutively assessed parents and 
caregivers to determine eligibility. 
Inclusion criteria were parent or 
legal guardian ≥18 years old with 
a child ≤8 years old, presenting 
for nonemergency care, who was 
English or Spanish-speaking, usually 
administers medications, and had 
no previous participation in a 
medication-related study. Exclusion 
criteria included visual acuity worse 
than 20/50 (Rosenbaum), hearing 
impairment, and parent or child 
too ill to participate. Participants 
provided written, informed consent.
Upon enrollment, subjects were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups. 
Groups differed by the pairing of units 
used on the bottle label and tool: 
mL–mL (group 1), mL and tsp–mL and 
tsp (group 2), mL and teaspoon–mL 
and tsp (group 3), mL–mL and tsp 
(group 4), and teaspoon–mL and 
tsp (group 5) ( 
Fig 1A). Because a 
move to a milliliter-only system has 
been recommended by numerous 
organizations, group 1 was considered 
the gold standard scenario. 
Randomization was conducted via a 
random number generator, blocked 
by site, in sets of 100 (20 per group). 
The lead project coordinator (J.J.J.) 
generated the allocation sequence; RAs 
at each site were blinded to group until 
after subjects were enrolled. Once the 
dosing assessment was initiated, it was 
not possible for the RA or participant 
to remain blinded, because it was

clear from the labels and tools 
being presented which group the 
participant had been assigned to.
Assessments
All assessments were performed on 
the day of enrollment. Interviews 
were conducted by trained RAs 
in English or Spanish (caregiver 
preference). Dosing assessments 
were conducted, followed by a 
survey to assess sociodemographics 
and health literacy. A $20 gift card 
incentive was provided.
Dosing Accuracy
Trained RAs presented each 
caregiver with a series of bottle 
labels and tools, which caregivers 
looked at to respond to questions 
and demonstrate dosing ( 
Fig 1). Each 
caregiver was asked to measure 
3 amounts (2.5, 5, and 7.5 mL) by 
using 3 tools (9 total trials). The 
3 tools were 2 syringes (10-mL 
capacity; 1 with 0.2-mL and 1 with 
0.5-mL increment markings) and 
1 dosing cup (30-mL capacity). A 
random number generator was used 
to randomize the order in which 
caregivers were presented with each 
tool type and dose amount. Custom-
designed tools (Comar, Buena, NJ) 
were used so that tools tested across 
groups varied only by markings.
Caregivers were presented with the 
9 sets of label and tool pairs, one 
at a time. Labels were in English 
or Spanish (caregiver preference). 
Caregivers were allotted as much 
time as they wanted to read each label 
and were instructed, “Please use this 
[DOSING TOOL HANDED TO PARENT] 
to show me how much medicine 
the label tells you to give the child 
each time you give the medicine.” For 
each trial, caregivers were given a 
standard medication bottle, filled to 
the same level; the medication used 
had a viscosity similar to common 
children’s medication suspensions.
Dosing error was the primary 
outcome variable; magnitude 
of error was determined by an 
established protocol. 
14 The weight 
of the measured dose (tool weight 
containing parents’ measured dose 
minus preassessment tool weight) 
was compared with a reference 
weight (eg, for 5-mL dose, the 
average weight of 5 mL measured by 
10 pediatricians using an oral syringe 
was determined). A pharmacy-grade 
electronic digital prescription class 
II scale (Torbal DRX-4; Fulcrum Inc, 
Clifton, NJ) was used.
The primary criterion used to 
determine whether an error was 
made was whether the measured 
amount fell within 20% of the label 
amount.

Medication labels and dosing tools tested. A, Comparison of randomization group characteristics. 
Unit label and dosing tool pairings were chosen because they represent the most common current 
standard practices used to display dose amounts on medication labels and dosing tools. The 
combination of units on labels and dosing tools applied to 3 different dosing tools given to each person 
(2 oral syringes [1 0.2-mL increment and 1 0.5-mL increment] and 1 cup); each subject measured 3 
doses with the 3 tools, for a total of 9 doses. aExample of group 2 medication label is shown in  
Fig 1B. 
Teaspoon units on English-language medication labels were translated into Spanish, consistent with 
recommended pharmacy practices. The abbreviation tsp was displayed as cdta on Spanish-language 
medication bottle labels, and teaspoon was displayed as cucharadita on the Spanish-language 
medication bottle labels. bDosing tools had units marked in English only, as is standard practice in 
the United States. For dosing tools, mL and tsp tools are most commonly used and were therefore 
included for the majority of groups. See  
Fig 1C. cThe milliliter-only system is endorsed by the AAP, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other national organizations. B, Example of group 2

performed analyses for large errors, 
using a cutoff point of 2 times above 
the tested dose.
Sociodemographic Data, Health 
Literacy, and Child Health Status
Sociodemographic data assessed 
included child (age, gender) and parent 
(age, relationship to child, income, 
country of birth, race or ethnicity, 
language, education) characteristics. 
Parent health literacy was assessed 
with the Newest Vital Sign. 
38 Child’s 
chronic disease status and medication 
use were assessed via questions 
adapted from the Children With Special 
Health Care Needs screener. 
39
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed 
in SAS software version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). We used 
χ2, analysis of variance, and 
Kruskall–Wallis tests to compare 
parent characteristics between 
randomization groups. For dosing 
accuracy, analyses were performed 
to compare error rates (with cutoffs 
of >20% deviation and >2 times the 
dose) by randomization group and 
tool type (ie, syringe with 0.2- or 
0.5-mL-increment markings, cup). 
Findings were analyzed by assigned 
group (all parents received assigned 
label–tool pairings). Multiple 
logistic regression with generalized 
estimating equations was used to 
account for repeated measures (9 
trials per subject). In addition to group 
and tool type, covariates selected 
a priori for inclusion in adjusted 
analyses were key study variables of 
dose amount, dosing order, and label 
language. In addition, characteristics 
found to be statistically different 
between groups were included (ie, 
health literacy). Stratified analyses 
and interaction tests were performed 
by health literacy and by language.
Sample Size Calculation
We conservatively estimated a 
sample size of 420 patients per arm, 
or 2100 total subjects, based on 
known rates of dosing errors from 
previous studies, which typically 
range from 10% to 50% depending 
on the tool used. 
12, 
 
14, 
 
27 This sample 
size would allow us to detect an 
absolute difference of ∼10% with 
80% power for our hypotheses 
related to unit pairings and tool type.
RESULTS
Between August 26, 2013 and 
December 18, 2014, 2110 parents 
enrolled in the study and were 
randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 groups 
( 
Fig 2). Dosing assessments were 
completed for 2099 parents ( 
Table 1).
Dosing Accuracy
Nearly all parents (99.3%) measured 
≥1 dose that was not the exact 
amount. Overall, 84.4% of parents 
made ≥1 dosing error (>20% 
deviation) in their 9 trials, with 
parents making errors in 25.3% of 
trials on average (mean [SD] number 
of errors = 2.3 [2.0]). Overdosing was 
present in 68.0% of errors. There 
were more errors with 2.5- and 
7.5-mL dose amounts, compared 
with 5-mL dose amounts (2.5 vs 5 mL 
adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.2; 95% 
CI, 3.8–4.6; 7.5 vs 5 mL aOR = 1.4; 95% 
CI, 1.2–1.5). Test order was associated 
with error, with a clear trend toward 
fewer errors as parents went through 
the trials. Overall, 21.0% made 
≥1 large error (>2 times the dose).
Unit of Measurement Pairing
Group 5 was the only group that was 
associated with more errors than the

milliliter-only group 1 (aOR = 1.2; 
95% CI, 1.01–1.4) ( 
Table 2). Similar 
findings were seen with large errors 
(aOR = 1.4; 95% CI, 0.97–1.9). No 
group by health literacy interaction 
was found, but a group by language 
interaction was seen (P = .006) 
( 
Table 3).
Dosing Tools
There was no significant difference 
in error rates with syringes that 
had 0.2-mL vs 0.5-mL-increment 
markings. More errors were seen 
with cups than syringes (cup vs 
0.5-mL-increment syringe aOR = 
4.6; 95% CI, 4.2–5.1 [ 
Table 2]); 
differences in error rates were

greatest for 2.5- and 5-mL doses 
( 
Fig 3). For large errors (>2 times the 
dose), the odds of error with cups 
remained higher than with syringes 
(aOR = 3.8; 95% CI, 3.1–4.7).
The odds of making an error with a cup 
versus syringe varied by health literacy 
(P < .001 for interaction) ( 
Table 3). 
The odds of making an error by tool 
type also varied by language, with 
cup versus syringe differences more 
prominently seen for English-speaking 
parents, although both language 
groups had fewer errors with 
syringes (P < .001 for interaction).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to rigorously 
examine, within an experimental 
study, whether altering specific label 
and dosing tool attributes can reduce 
parent liquid medication dosing 
error rates. Overall, we found high 
dosing error rates. Little variation 
in errors was observed by unit 
pairings tested, although parents 
who received teaspoon-only labels 
with milliliter and teaspoon dosing 
tools made significantly more errors 
than those receiving milliliter-only 
labels and tools. Use of dosing 
cups greatly increased the risk of 
errors, especially with smaller dose 
amounts. Although the strength 
of associations differed somewhat 
by health literacy and language, 
our study clearly identified certain 
improvements that could be made 
to labels and tools to enhance dosing 
accuracy for parents across groups.
Overall, >80% of parents made ≥1 
dosing error (>20% deviation), 
and >20% made ≥1 large error (>2 
times the dose). Previous studies 
have demonstrated high error rates 
with liquid medications. 
12, 
 
13, 
 
15, 
 
16 A 
range of definitions for error have 
been used in the literature, with 
some relying on specific deviations 
in amount (eg, 0.2 mL), 
21 whereas 
others use percentage deviations (eg, 
10%, 20%). 
16, 
 
37 We defined an error 
as >20% deviation, because we hoped 
to identify strategies that could be 
universally applied as part of a public 
health approach, recognizing that 
some medications have a narrow 
therapeutic window. 
15 For some 
medications, errors within an even 
smaller range (<20% deviation) may 
be clinically significant; additional 
intervention strategies may be 
important to reduce errors for these 
high-risk medications, including 
more intensive teaching or coaching.
Dosing error rates varied little by the 
unit pairings on the label and tool 
we studied. Use of teaspoon only on 
the label when paired with an mL 
and tsp tool was associated with a 
slightly higher error rate and was 
the only mismatch found to differ 
significantly from the milliliter-only 
group. Even in the milliliter-only 
group, parents made errors in 1 of 
4 trials on average. These findings 
suggest that additional strategies 
beyond moving to milliliter-exclusive 
dosing, as supported by a 2015 AAP 
Policy Statement, 
 
7 will probably be 
needed for the greatest reduction in 
parent dosing error rates. Although 
no statistically significant difference 
by health literacy was seen, there 
was a trend for unit mismatches 
being most confusing for those with 
lower literacy. The impact of unit 
mismatch also varied significantly 
by language. Spanish parents faced 
a difficult mismatch in group 5, with 
cucharadita shown on the label and 
tools with mL and tsp.
In our study, cups were associated 
with >4 times the odds of error 
compared with syringes; similar 
findings were seen with large errors. 
Previous studies have demonstrated 
the superiority of syringes to cups

when a 5-mL dose was tested 
14, 
 
27; 
our study is unique in that we 
examined a range of doses. One reason 
why cups may be inferior to syringes 
is that the same distance along the 
side of the tool represents a greater 
volume for cups than for syringes (eg, 
for cups, 1 mm might represent 0.8 mL; 
for syringes, 1 mm might represent 
0.1 mL). 
27 In addition, when a cup is 
not held at eye level, it may appear 
to be filled to a particular marking 
when it is not. 
14 Even with syringes, 
however, a significant number of 
parents made dosing errors, suggesting 
that more intensive education by 
physicians, pharmacists, and other 
staff may be needed; use of strategies 
such as pictures or drawings, 
teachback, or showback, and 
demonstration may be beneficial.40
Interestingly, although there was a 
comparable reduction in absolute 
risk for error of 24% to 30% across 
literacy and language groups, a 
significant percentage of low-literacy 
(1 in 4) and Spanish-speaking 
parents (1 in 5) still made errors with 
syringes. These findings suggest that 
for these at-risk populations, a policy 
change to replace cups with syringes 
will probably not be sufficient.
We also found that the odds of error 
for syringes versus cups varied by 
dose, with tool type having the greatest 
impact with smaller doses. Our findings 
suggest that it may be beneficial to 
recommend the use of different tool 
types depending on the dose amount. 
The 2015 AAP policy statement on 
milliliter-exclusive dosing recommends 
provision of standardized tools with 
milliliter markings, preferably syringes, 
with cups and spoons with calibrated 
markings considered acceptable 
alternatives; no recommendations 
based on dose amount were provided. 
7 
Our findings indicate that particularly 
when smaller doses are prescribed, 
providers may want to encourage 
parent use of syringes by providing 
them with a syringe to take home; 
cups may be acceptable for larger 
doses. Because parents may not use 
tools provided to them, counseling 
and general education about the 
importance and proper use of standard 
dosing tools remain important.
Interestingly, parents made more 
errors with dose amounts of 2.5 and 
7.5 mL overall, compared with 5 mL, 
suggesting that whole numbers may 
be better understood. Additional 
study is needed to explore the 
potential benefit of limiting doses to 
whole number amounts.
Notably, the simplification of syringes 
with fewer markings was not 
associated with a difference in errors. 
It may be that parents benefit so 
much from using a syringe over a cup 
that the added benefit of simplification 
of markings is not discernible. Few 
studies have examined the implications 
of variations in markings in depth; 
for this study, we were able to look at 
only 2 variations. It remains possible 
that other strategies to simplify 
markings (eg, inclusion of only 
markings specific to recommended 
doses) could influence error rates.
This study has the following 
limitations. Errors were identified via 
a hypothetical assessment and might 
not reflect how parents actually 
dose at home. Parents measured 
medications as part of 9 trials, and 
test order was associated with error, 
consistent with a learning effect;

however, the order in which each 
trial was conducted was randomized, 
and order was adjusted for in models. 
To minimize subject burden, a limited 
range of doses were tested, and only 
cups and oral syringes were tested. 
Tools were marked only in English, 
reflecting current standard practices. 
Not all potential unit pairings were 
included; we selected 5 common 
pairings. We did not include pairings 
involving mismatches of greater 
discordance such as a teaspoon 
label with a milliliter tool, because 
it is well established that complete 
mismatches should be avoided. Only 
1 label design format was used. Our 
study focused on measurement, and 
not on other issues involved in the 
administration of medications to a 
child (eg, spillage). This study was 
conducted with English- and Spanish-
speaking parents who brought their 
children to 3 university-affiliated 
pediatric clinic sites serving 
predominantly low-income families; 
results may not be generalizable.
CONCLUSIONS
Findings from this study can be used 
to build on existing AAP policies 
related to milliliter-only dosing and 
provision of standardized dosing 
tools, 
7, 
 
24 to promote the safe use of 
pediatric liquid medications. Our 
findings suggest that health care 
providers should encourage oral 
syringe use for the measurement of 
liquid medications, particularly when 
small doses are recommended; this 
change would probably benefit all 
families, regardless of health literacy 
and language. The types of unit of 
measurement discordance between 
labels and tools we studied appeared 
to have a limited impact on error 
rates, although our findings support 
avoidance of using teaspoon alone on 
labels. Notably, even when syringes 
were used with concordant milliliter-
only labels and tools, parents made 
1 or 2 errors on average across the 
9 trials in this experiment. Future 
studies are needed to examine 
additional strategies (eg, pictograms, 
tool size) to reduce errors and to test 
strategies in real-world settings.
