Abstract
The reasons for using electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are poorly understood
and are primarily documented by expensive cross-sectional surveys that use preconceived
close-ended response options rather than allowing respondents to use their own words. We
passively identify the reasons for using ENDS longitudinally from a content analysis of public
postings on Twitter. All English language public tweets including several ENDS terms (e.g.,
“e-cigarette” or “vape”) were captured from the Twitter data stream during 2012 and 2015.
After excluding spam, advertisements, and retweets, posts indicating a rationale for vaping
were retained. The specific reasons for vaping were then inferred based on a supervised
content analysis using annotators from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. During 2012 quitting
combustibles was the most cited reason for using ENDS with 43% (95%CI 39–48) of all rea-
son-related tweets cited quitting combustibles, e.g., “I couldn’t quit till I tried ecigs,” eclipsing
the second most cited reason by more than double. Other frequently cited reasons in 2012
included ENDS’s social image (21%; 95%CI 18–25), use indoors (14%; 95%CI 11–17), fla-
vors (14%; 95%CI 11–17), safety relative to combustibles (9%; 95%CI 7–11), cost (3%;
95%CI 2–5) and favorable odor (2%; 95%CI 1–3). By 2015 the reasons for using ENDS
cited on Twitter had shifted. Both quitting combustibles and use indoors significantly
declined in mentions to 29% (95%CI 24–33) and 12% (95%CI 9–16), respectively. At the
same time, social image increased to 37% (95%CI 32–43) and lack of odor increased to 5%
(95%CI 2–5), the former leading all cited reasons in 2015. Our data suggest the reasons
people vape are shifting away from cessation and toward social image. The data also show
how the ENDS market is responsive to a changing policy landscape. For instance, smoking
indoors was less frequently cited in 2015 as indoor smoking restrictions became more com-
mon. Because the data and analytic approach are scalable, adoption of our strategies in the

Introduction
Despite the popularity of electronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)
[1,2], there is surprisingly little actionable intelligence on why people vape [3]. The most cited
reasons include curiosity, enjoyment, and other idiopathic reasons [4–6] that do not inform
any particular intervention or policy response. Fewer studies point to actionable reasons that
may guide specific control measures to curtail use, such as use indoors [7] which can be miti-
gated by banning vaping indoors.
This knowledge gap, in part, represents the limitations of tobacco control surveillance. All
of the known reasons for vaping were derived from cross-sectional surveys. For example, the
International Tobacco Control Four-Country Survey asked vapers about why they use ENDS
with four yes/no response items [8] Surveys require substantial time and resources to imple-
ment, meaning many reasons are never asked. Moreover, where studies rely on closed-ended
response options (rather than allowing participants to use their own words) some reasons are
potentially still unknown.
Supplemental approaches are needed to inexpensively and rapidly discover the reasons for
using ENDS to inform the science around ENDS (such as follow-up survey-based surveil-
lance), inform the development of policy-based control measures, or aid the design of health
interventions. Herein we demonstrate the feasibility of a data-driven protocol that allows the
public to describe why they vape in their own words by passively monitoring public tweets—a
promising [9] but underutilized approach in public health [10–16]. Doing so lays the ground-
work for a new perspective that in practice can help capture the reasons people vape quickly,
informing follow-up surveillance and public health practice.
Materials and methods
The data consisted of 3.3 million public tweets from 2012 and 2015 that was collected from the
Twitter API by searching for the following ENDS-related keywords: electronic cigarette(s),
electronic cig(s), e cig(s), e-cig(s), eking(s), e cigarette(s), e-cigarette(s), ecigarette(s), vape(s),
vaper(s), and vaping. This data collection therefore includes all tweets about ENDS as long as
they included the aforementioned terms. We then used a two-stage strategy to identify a sub-
sample for analysis by (a) selecting organic English-language tweets that referenced ENDS use
and then (b) using supervised content analysis to discover the reasons for using ENDS from
these tweets.
In the first stage, irrelevant tweets were excluded by purging non-English language tweets
(using the Lui method [17]) tweets with URLS (which were almost exclusively advertisements),
spam, and retweets (so each tweet counted once). We identified spam tweets using a statistical
machine learning classifier developed using a set of 10,157 e-cigarette tweets (60% train, 20%
dev, 20% test) that were identified by Amazon Mechanical Turk annotators (mturk.com/
mturk/welcome) as either spam or not spam. We used a logistic regression model to predict
labels, with a set of n-gram features augmented by 300-dimensional word2vec embeddings
using the Mikolov strategy [18]. Drawing from this refined database we selected tweets that
indicated use ENDS by the tweeter or another person using human coders from Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk [19]. Coders searched for retained tweets about ENDS use until a target

 sample of 2,900 for each year was achieved (thereby yielding a margin of error less than 0.02 in
subsequent analysis) [20]. In practice this collective strategy retained tweets such as “I have an
electronic cig and it’s helping me quit,” and excluded tweets such as “Closing sale! #vapeporn
#eking #vaping” “just read this eking article [link],” or “I just saw someone vaping” because
they are advertising, included a URL, or do not indicate use, respectively. The inter-rater
agreement between the Mturk coders identifying tweets as being about ENDS use was Cohen’s
Kappa = 0.56, percentage agreement = 0.83. Tweets with conflicting labels were assumed to
not be about ENDS use and discarded from further analysis.
In the second stage, we identified any “reasons” for use [21]. The investigators (JWA, ECL,
AB, and MD) reviewed tweets and discussed reasons for vaping that emerged in the data
simultaneously developing a framework and codebook for annotating the tweets. An open-
ended framework was selected that allowed each tweet to have zero or multiple associated rea-
sons; e.g., “I like ecigs because they’re cheap and taste great” would indicate lower price and fla-
vor as reasons (Table 1). Implied reasons were also considered, e.g., “vaping in the club” would
indicate vaping indoors. We then developed a protocol for the most commonly cited reasons,
avoiding rare reasons because they are not high priorities for intervention or reasons focused
on personal emotions because they may not inform precise interventions. The investigators
then tested this protocol until a final document was agreed on. Ultimately, our data-driven
pilot protocol defined 7 categories: cost, flavors, odor, safety relative to combustibles, social
image, quitting combustibles, and use indoors. This protocol was then applied using Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.54 averaged over all 7 reasons; percentage agree-
ment = 0.92). The results for the 7 reasons as the percent of reason-related tweets by year were
described using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (to assess confidence in the point esti-
mates) and non-parametric chi-squared tests (to compare differences in reasons across years).
All analyses relied on anonymous data and adhere to the terms and conditions, terms of
use, and privacy policies of Twitter. To protect the privacy of the study participants no tweets
were quoted in this study. Instead, example tweets are shown to be indicative of the types of
tweets included in our analysis. All analyses were computed using R Ver. 3.2.2.
Results
During 2012 quitting combustibles was the most cited reason for using ENDS. Forty-three per-
cent 43% (95%CI 39–48) of reason-related-tweets mentioned quitting combustibles, e.g., “I
couldn’t quit till I tried ecigs”, eclipsing all other reasons by more than double (Fig 1).

 The remaining reasons fell into 3 strata by rank. Ranking second, third, and fourth, and sig-
nificantly higher than all remaining reasons was social image which was cited in 21% (95%CI
18–25) of reason-related-tweets, e.g., “I want one of those e-cigs, it'll make me look cool.” use
indoors, e.g., “vaping in the club” which was cited in 17% (95%CI 14–20) of reason-related
tweets, and flavor choices, e.g., “. . .the best part is the taste,” which was cited in 14% (95%CI
11–17) of reason-related tweets. Ranking fifth and significantly higher than all remaining rea-
sons, safety relative to combustibles, e.g., “. . .and vaping is safe,” was cited in 9% (95%CI 7–11)
of reason-related tweets. The final strata included ENDS’ favorable odor and low cost ranking
sixth and seventh with 3% (95%CI 2–5) and 2% (95%CI 1–3), respectively.
By 2015 both quitting combustibles and use indoors significantly declined to 29% (95%CI
24–33) and 12% (95%CI 9–16) falling from first to second in the rankings and third to fourth
in the rankings. At the same time, social image increased to 37% (95%CI 32–43) and favorable
odor increased to 5% (95%CI 2–5), the former eclipsing all reasons in 2015 and the latter rising
from seventh to sixth in the ranking of reasons reported on Twitter. Other reasons remained
stable from 2012 to 2015.
Discussion
Without any priming or direct costs associated with data collection, public health can use
social media surveillance to understand why people vape, yielding actionable intelligence for
decision making regarding ENDS now and a pathway forward for additional intelligence using
our novel strategy in the future.
Our findings regarding 2012 confirmed with traditional studies; including using ENDS to
quit combustibles and use indoors [22,23]. But by 2015 the reasons for vaping as reported on
Twitter shifted, with both quitting combustibles and vaping indoors declining in mentions, a
finding that has not been reported elsewhere. Taken together with other more recent findings
and anecdotal evidence, the shift in reported reasons for vaping appears face valid. Google
searches for ENDS for quitting smoking have been on the decline [2] supporting our conclu-
sion that cessation is declining as a reason for vaping. Nearly 500 legislative bodies now ban
vaping where smoking is prohibited [24] meaning ENDS cannot be used to avoid clean air
laws as before. Similarly ENDS marketing has substantially grown with a focus on social image

 [25–27] consequently this may be why positive social image dominated all reported reasons on
Twitter in 2015 [28].
At the same time, our findings suggest the reasons for using ENDS is in part to circumvent
existing policy regulations for controlling combustible tobacco use. Three of the 7 most cited
reasons for vaping focused on evading policies, such as novel flavors (e.g., cherry) that have
been banned in cigarettes [29]. The appeal of ENDS can potentially be curtailed by targeting
these reasons with public policies that ban the use of non-tobacco flavors in ENDS, apply clean
indoor air laws to ENDS, and tax ENDS like combustible tobacco products. Moreover, given
these reasons were cited in about 30% of tweets during 2015 a change in public policy could
have substantial impact on the appeal of ENDS.
The most important implication is the long-term value of our strategy for open-ended and
real-time surveillance, and how it resembles a massive and passive focus group. For example,
assuming 2% of adults use ENDS and a sample of 1,000 participants using random-digit dial-
ing costs roughly $70,000, 50,000 interviews would need to be completed to have a single com-
parable snapshot—a fiftyfold increase in cost representing about $3.5 million. This does not
mean our approach replaces surveys, but it can inform their design so that surveys are asking
“the right” questions about reasons that are known to resonate with the public and public
health leaders have an agile and replicable early surveillance system to guide debate.
Big data has already played a central role in ENDS surveillance, [2,12,30,31] even first iden-
tifying their popularity explosion [1], and has similarly improved tobacco control surveillance
generally [32–38]. Yet, most studies using Twitter are superficial, describing a general trend
for keyword searches like “cholera” [39] or “quit smoking” [40], as detailed in several recent
critiques [41–44]. Herein we deviate from the existing literature and demonstrate a protocol
that renders specific data for a specific, but poorly addressed, high priority research question
that takes advantage of the richness in Twitter data by going beyond keyword-based analyses.
Moreover, our strategy has implications beyond ENDS or tobacco control, holding value for
studying the appeal of medical devices, public policies, illicit drugs, and commercial products.
In our demonstrative study, we constrained our focus to the most common reasons and
analyzed all tweets in aggregate, but in the future this procedure can be refined to overcome
these limitations. For example, our strategy can discover additional reasons or variations
within reasons (e.g., what are the most popular flavors?). Moreover, reasons can be described
across demographic traits that can be inferred from a Twitter profile, such as gender, ethnicity,
and location, yielding demographically specific insights akin to the traditional survey. This
potential along with the empirical insights herein suggests our protocol holds great value for
ENDS, tobacco control, and public health surveillance going forward.
