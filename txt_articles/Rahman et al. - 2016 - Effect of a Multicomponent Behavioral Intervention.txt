IMPORTANCE The mental health consequences of conflict and violence are wide-ranging and
pervasive. Scalable interventions to address a range of mental health problems are needed.
OBJECTIVE To test the effectiveness of a multicomponent behavioral intervention delivered
by lay health workers to adults with psychological distress in primary care settings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial was conducted from
November 1, 2014, through January 28, 2016, in 3 primary care centers in Peshawar, Pakistan,
that included 346 adult primary care attendees with high levels of both psychological distress
and functional impairment according to the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and the
World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0).
INTERVENTIONS Lay health workers administered 5 weekly 90-minute individual sessions
that included empirically supported strategies of problem solving, behavioral activation,
strengthening social support, and stress management. The control was enhanced usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes, anxiety and depression symptoms,
were independently measured at 3 months with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS). Secondary outcomes were posttraumatic stress symptoms (Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder Checklist for DSM-5), functional impairment (WHODAS 2.0), progress on problems
for which the person sought help (Psychological Outcome Profiles), and symptoms of
depressive disorder (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire).
RESULTS Among346patients(mean[SD]age,33.0[11.8]years;78.9%women),172were

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults impaired by psychological distress in a
conflict-affected area, lay health worker administration of a brief multicomponent
intervention based on established behavioral strategies, compared with enhanced usual care,
resulted in clinically significant reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months.

M
ore than 125 million people today are directly af-
fected by armed conflict, the highest number since
World War II.1 Although reported rates of mental dis-
orders vary, a meta-analysis of a subset of relatively rigorous
postconflict surveys showed that mood and anxiety disor-
ders were common, with rates of 17.3% for depression and
15.4% for posttraumatic stress disorder.2
Psychological interventions are among the first-line treat-
mentsformood,anxiety,andposttraumaticstressdisorders.3,4
A key barrier to sustainable delivery of mental health care in
low-income countries, particularly in areas affected by con-
flict or disaster, is the scarcity of human resources.5 The imple-
mentation of adapted psychological interventions by super-
vised lay health workers is a potential solution receiving
significant attention as part of the global mental health re-
search agenda.6,7
The World Health Organization (WHO), as part of its
Mental Health Gap Action Programme, has begun to release
a series of manualized psychological interventions adapted
for scaled-up delivery by lay health workers. A brief psycho-
logical intervention incorporating behavioral strategies was
developed as part of this series.8 In a previous study, the
intervention was adapted for use in primary care in Pakistan,
using established methods we have used previously.9 A
small pilot trial in the conflict-affected city of Peshawar,
Pakistan, showed that the intervention was feasible, inte-
grated well into the primary care system, and improved
functioning and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared
with enhanced care as usual.10
The aim of the present study was to test the intervention
through a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT). We hypoth-
esized that primary care attendees randomly assigned to the
intervention would show greater reductions in symptoms of
anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and functional im-
pairment and reduced symptoms of depressive disorder after
treatment and at 3-month follow-up compared with those ran-
domized to enhanced usual care.
Methods
Design
The study was a single-blind individual RCT conducted from
November 1, 2014, through January 28, 2016 (Figure). Pri-
mary outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression 3
months after treatment began. Secondary outcomes were
symptoms of posttraumatic stress, functional impairment,
problems for which the person sought help, and rates of symp-
toms of depressive disorder. The project was approved lo-
cally by the Institutional Review and Ethics Board of the Post-
graduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar,
and by the WHO Ethical Review Committee. All participants
provided written informed consent. The full trial protocol11 is
available in Supplement 1.
Participants
Participants were routine patients from 3 primary care cen-
ters in Peshawar, Pakistan, aged between 18 and 60 years.
The primary care centers, covering a population of 30 000
to 50 000 individuals each, are government facilities staffed
by a physician, midwife, paramedic staff, and community
health workers providing general health care and maternity
services. All participants clinically assessed by their physi-
cian to be currently experiencing emotional distress were
invited to participate in the study. The physicians were
trained to recognize common mental disorders. Demo-
graphic data obtained for this study included age, sex, edu-
cation, and experience of stressful events in the last year.
Procedures
Invited participants were approached by a trained research
assistant to obtain written informed consent to screen
for trial eligibility. Consenting participants were then
screened by trained research assistants; those who scored
both 3 or higher on a screening questionnaire for common
mental disorders (12-item General Health Questionnaire
[GHQ-12])12,13 and 17 or higher on a questionnaire for func-
tional impairments (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule
2.0 [WHODAS 2.0])14 were invited to participate. The
GHQ-12 has 12 questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale.
When used as screener, it is scored bimodally (ie, 0-0-1-1)
with a total score ranging from 0 to 12, where higher scores
indicate higher likelihood of morbidity. A cutoff of 3 or
higher can be used to indicate clinical caseness of common
mental disorders in Pakistan.13 The WHODAS 2.0 is further
described in the “Secondary Outcomes” section. Exclusion
criteria were imminent risk of suicide, severe mental disor-
der (eg, psychotic disorders, substance dependence), or
severe cognitive impairment (eg, severe intellectual disabil-
ity, dementia).
Eligible participants were invited to take part in the RCT.
All assessments were performed by trained research assis-
tants blind to allocation status of participants who received
2-day training covering administration of instruments, gen-
eral interview techniques, and ethical research conduct, in ad-
dition to a half day of security training.
Randomization was conducted after baseline assess-
ment by an independent research assistant located off site
Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness of a brief multicomponent
intervention incorporating behavioral strategies delivered by lay
health workers to adults functionally impaired by symptoms
of psychological distress in a conflict-affected setting?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial in primary care settings
in Peshawar, Pakistan, 346 adults impaired by psychological
distress were randomized to the intervention or enhanced usual
care. After 3 months of treatment, the intervention group had
significantly lower anxiety and depression scores and lower rates
of depressive disorder compared with those in the enhanced usual
care group.
Meaning This lay worker–administered intervention may be
a practical approach for treating adults with psychological distress
in conflict-affected areas.

and not involved in any other aspect of the study. Random-
ization was performed using computerized software on 1:1
basis. Allocation concealment was ensured by keeping the
random assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque,
sealed envelopes at the off-site center. The trial coordinator
contacted each participant after being informed of partici-
pants’ allocation status. Participants randomized to the
intervention group were allocated a trained lay health
worker by the trial coordinator. This health worker con-
tacted the participant to plan the 5 consecutive sessions
with them, with the first session scheduled no longer than 1
week after the pretreatment assessment. Posttreatment
assessments were carried out 1 week after treatment and 3
months following the start of treatment. Participants in
both groups who developed severe psychiatric problems
(eg, psychosis, imminent suicidality) that required immedi-
ate specialist treatment and follow-up were referred to the
Lady Reading Hospital for specialist care.
Intervention
The brief multicomponent intervention, called Problem
Management Plus (PM+), was based on established problem-
solving and behavioral techniques.8,15 The intervention was
transdiagnostic (ie, targeted symptoms across a range of con-
ditions rather than being diagnosis specific). It consisted of 5
weekly face-to-face sessions lasting 90 minutes each.15 Ses-
sion 1 oriented participants to the intervention with motiva-
tional interviewing techniques to improve engagement, pro-
vided information about common reactions to adversity, and
taught participants a basic stress management strategy (slow
breathing). This strategy was practiced at the conclusion of
every session to enhance its learning. Session 2 addressed a
participant-selected problem using problem-solving tech-
niques and introduced behavioral activation during which
individuals were encouraged to reengage gradually with
pleasant and task-oriented activities to improve mood and
functionality. Sessions 3 and 4 supported participants’con-
tinued application of problem solving, behavioral activation,
and stress management and introduced strategies to
strengthen social support networks. In session 5, education
about retaining treatment gains was provided and all learned
strategies were reviewed.
The intervention is available on the WHO website15 and in
the eAppendix in Supplement 2.
The training and supervision model for lay health
workers followed on-the-job training.16 In this study, the
lay health workers had 12 to 16 years of education with
no previous clinical training or experience in counseling,
social work, clinical psychology, or psychiatry. The master
trainer (K.S.D.) conducted a 6-day training with local mental
health specialists who in turn provided an 8-day training
program to 9 lay health workers. Both training programs
comprised education about common mental disorders,
basic counseling skills, delivery of intervention strategies,
and self-care. Supervisors received additional training
in training and supervision skills. Training of both supervi-
sors and health workers was followed by clinical practice
with 3 practice cases each under supervision. Following
this, all lay health workers were assessed for their compe-
tency in delivering the intervention using a competency rat-
ing tool that evaluated basic counseling skills and for their
use of intervention strategies with clients through direct
observation of specially designed role plays. Competency
was rated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not
done) to 5 (excellent). A score of 2 or higher on each item
indicated competency.
The lay health workers were supervised in 2 groups on a
weekly basis (2 hours) by the in-country supervisors. The lat-
ter were supervised (1-2 hours per month by Skype) by the
master trainer, building their skills in the intervention and in
training and supervision of others. One in-country supervisor
(N.R.A.) directly observed a randomly selected sample of
10% of health workers’ sessions (n = 80; 10 sessions per
health worker) and used a checklist to systematically assess
fidelity to the intervention. The session-wise checklist con-
sisted of items capturing key intervention strategies for
each session. The responses were recorded as yes or no

for each given strategy for the particular session. Based on
this evaluation, the supervisor rated each session overall as
satisfactory or unsatisfactory in terms of fidelity achieved.
Identified weak areas were reinforced during supervision.
Enhanced Usual Care
Primary care physicians in the participating centers received
a 5-day training course run by the Lady Reading Hospital as
part of the national community mental health program.17
This was enhanced through 1-day refresher training on com-
mon presentations of anxiety and depression, psychoeduca-
tion, supportive counseling, rational use of antidepressants
or antianxiety medication, and referral pathways. Partici-
pants randomized to enhanced usual care were seen at least
once by their primary care physician. Study participants and
their accompanying family member were provided psycho-
education and the opportunity to talk about their health in a
supportive environment. Participants were given the option
of a repeated consultation.
Primary Outcomes
The primary outcomes were severity of anxiety and depres-
sive symptoms measured independently using the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).18,19 The HADS is a well-
established 14-item scale consisting of 2 subscales: HADS-A
(anxiety; 7 items; possible score range, 0-21) and HADS-D
(depression; 7 items; possible score range, 0-21). Higher
scores indicate more anxiety and/or depression. The HADS has
been widely used across cultures,20 including Pakistan,19 and
found to have good reliability and validity. The minimal clini-
cally important difference has been determined at 1.32 for
HADS-A and 1.40 for HADS-D.21
Secondary Outcomes
Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were measured
using the 20-item Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for
DSM-5 (PCL-5).22 Items are rated on a scale of 0 to 4 with a
total score range of 0 to 80. The PCL-5 has shown good psy-
chometric properties in terms of diagnostic accuracy and
internal consistency23 and has been used in Pakistan.24 To
improve sensitivity to change, the PCL-5 was adapted by ask-
ing for symptoms in the past week rather than month.
Functional impairment was measured by the WHODAS
2.0,14 which assesses health-related difficulties across do-
mains of functioning. Difficulties are scored on a 5-point scale
over the past 30 days. The 12-item interviewer-administered
version was used, which is applicable across all health states
including mental disorders. The WHODAS 2.0 has shown
good validity in terms of internal consistency, test-retest re-
liability, and agreement with other measures of disability
across countries.25
The Psychological Outcome Profiles (PSYCHLOPS)26 in-
strument was used to measure progress on problems for which
the person sought help. It covers 3 domains: problems (2 ques-
tions), functioning (1 question), and well-being (1 question).
Responses are scored on an ordinal 6-point scale, with a maxi-
mum score of 20 (5 points per question). The PSYCHLOPS has
shown satisfactory internal consistency, good convergent va-
lidity with measures of psychological distress, and high sen-
sitivity to change.27
Participants were assessed for symptoms of depressive
disorder with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-9), an instrument that incorporates DSM-IV depres-
sion diagnostic criteria with other key major depressive
symptoms.28 Participants rate their responses on a 4-point
Likert scale ranging from not at all to nearly every day. The
PHQ-9 total severity score ranges from 0 to 27. The PHQ-9
has been validated in the Urdu language, showing adequate
sensitivity and specificity.29,30 A cutoff score of 10 or higher
was used to diagnose depressive disorder.
A modified version of the Life Events Checklist previ-
ously developed for the Pakistani population31 was used to
identify stressful life events in the previous year rated as either
present or absent. Data on life events were collected at 3
months’follow-up only.
Statistical Analysis
A total of 346 participants were included in this study.
Because no comparable intervention studies in this popula-
tion have been carried out, we aimed for a relatively conser-
vative estimate of a 50% reduction in HADS overall score in
the intervention group as compared with a 30% reduction in
the control group at 3 months’follow-up (this estimate was
extrapolated from a trial involving lay workers in India)32
with a mean (SD) HADS score of 25 (8) at baseline. This corre-
sponded with an effect size of 0.625 in the total HADS
score. We assumed that the effect sizes for the HADS-A
and HADS-D subscales would be similar to that for the total
HADS score. Power calculations suggested a minimum
sample size of 133 participants per group (power = 0.95;
α = .05, 2-sided). To account for a conservative 30% attrition
at 3 months’follow-up, we aimed to include a total of 346
participants (173 in the intervention group and 173 in the
enhanced usual care group).
The primary focus of analyses was on intent-to-treat
analyses consisting of all patients included according to the
groups in which they were randomized. Using SPSS version
23 (SPSS Inc) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) statisti-
cal software, we used linear mixed models to study treat-
ment effects. This allows the number of observations to
vary between participants and effectively handles missing
data.33 The mixed model uses a longitudinal data structure
that includes both fixed and random effects. Time (linear
and quadratic), treatment, and interactions between treat-
ment and time (linear and quadratic) were included as fixed
effects in the mixed models and participant was included as
random effect. Differences in the least squares means (treat-
ment effects) at each time point with 95% confidence inter-
vals were derived. A 2-sided P < .05 was used to define sta-
tistical significance. Fixed-effects parameters were tested
with the Wald test.
Primary analyses focused on HADS-A and HADS-D scores.
Secondary analyses focused on results from the PCL-5,
WHODAS 2.0, PSYCHLOPS, and PHQ-9. In a post hoc analy-
sis, changes in participants meeting cutoff scores for depres-
sive disorder were calculated for the treatment completer

sample using the recommended cutoff of 10 on the PHQ-928
and analyzed using a linear mixed model with the same fixed
and random effects as mixed models described earlier, from
which the risk difference and 95% confidence interval at each
time point were derived. Another post hoc analysis of pri-
mary and secondary outcomes was conducted in which the
baseline measurement of an outcome was treated as a covar-
iate. Finally, post hoc sensitivity analysis using multiple im-
putation was performed to assess the robustness of treat-
menteffecttothemissingvalues.Noneoftheposthocanalyses
were prespecified in the protocol.
Results
Competency assessments following training found that 8 of 9
health workers scored 2 or higher on all items of the basic
counseling skills and intervention strategies assessed. Of the
80 sessions observed directly to evaluate fidelity, 68 (85.0%)
achieved satisfactory fidelity to the intervention.
The Figure depicts participant flow through the trial. At
the primary outcome assessment point of 3 months follow-
ing the start of treatment, follow-up was available for 146 of
172 participants in the intervention group (84.9%) and 160
of 174 participants in the control group (92.0%). At 1 week af-
ter treatment, the follow-up rates were 34.9% in the interven-
tion group and 44.3% in the control group owing to security
threats at the time.
The mean (SD) number of sessions attended by the inter-
vention group was 4.2 (1.70) and the duration of each session
was about 90 minutes. Data were not available on the num-
ber or duration of sessions with the primary care physician in
the control group. No participants were prescribed psycho-
tropic medication by the primary care centers for the dura-
tion of the study.
Table 1 provides information on demographic character-
istics, exposure to life events, and traumatic events for the
sample. Of the 346 total participants, 273 (78.9%) were
female, 203 (58.7%) were uneducated, 210 (60.7%) had wit-
nessed or experienced armed conflict or war, 91 (26.3%) had
witnessed or experienced physical assault, and 70 (20.2%)
had witnessed or experienced natural disaster. The mean
(SD) age of the participants was 33.0 (11.8) years. There were
no differences between groups in demographic characteris-
tics except in education, with more participants in the con-
trol group having no education. The majority of participants
in both groups were women. According to the PSYCHLOPS,
the top 3 self-identified problems were headache (124 partici-
pants [35.8%]); fatigue, lethargy, or low energy (99 partici-
pants [28.6%]); and sleep problems (46 participants [13.3%]).
Table 2 presents the findings for the primary outcomes
of anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) and the sec-
ondary outcomes of posttraumatic stress (PCL-5), func-
tional impairment (WHODAS 2.0), problems for which the
person sought help (PSYCHLOPS), and symptoms of depres-
sive disorder (PHQ-9) in the intervention and control groups
at all time points. At baseline, the intervention and control
groups had similar scores on symptoms of anxiety (mean
[SD] HADS-A score, 14.16 [3.17] vs 13.64 [3.20]; adjusted
mean difference [AMD], 0.52; 95% CI, −0.22 to 1.27) and
depression (mean [SD] HADS-D score, 12.67 [3.27] vs 12.49
[3.34]; AMD, 0.17; 95% CI, −0.54 to 0.89). One week after
treatment completion, the intervention group had signifi-
cantly lower scores on HADS-A (mean [SD], 7.56 [3.41] vs
10.26 [3.92]; AMD, −2.77; 95% CI, −3.72 to −1.82) and
HADS-D (mean [SD], 6.49 [3.25] vs 9.45 [3.38]; AMD, −3.02;
95% CI, −3.93 to −2.10). After 3 months from the start of
treatment, the intervention group had significantly lower
scores than the control group on HADS-A (mean [SD], 7.25
[3.63] vs 10.03 [3.87]; AMD, −2.77; 95% CI, −3.56 to −1.98)
and HADS-D (mean [SD], 6.30 [3.40] vs 9.27 [3.56]; AMD,
−2.98; 95% CI, −3.74 to −2.22). The HADS total score also
showed similar differences between the 2 groups at 1 week
after treatment (mean [SD], 14.02 [6.30] vs 19.71 [6.99];
AMD, −5.83; 95% CI, −7.60 to −4.06) and at 3 months’
follow-up (mean [SD], 13.55 [6.75] vs 19.29 [7.12]; AMD,
−5.75; 95% CI, −7.21 to −4.29) (Table 2 and eTable 1 in
Supplement 2).
At 3 months after start of the treatment, there were also
significant differences in scores of posttraumatic stress (PCL-5
score: AMD, −5.86; 95% CI, −8.53 to −3.19), functional impair-
ment (WHODAS 2.0 score: AMD, −4.17; 95% CI, −5.84 to −2.51),

pressive disorder (PHQ-9 score: AMD, −3.41; 95% CI, −4.49
to −2.34). Post hoc analysis showed that at baseline, 94.2% of
participants in the intervention group and 89.7% of partici-
pants in the control group met the PHQ-9 criteria for depres-
sion. At 3 months after start of the treatment, the rates were
26.9% and 58.9%, respectively (risk difference, −31.98; 95% CI,
−41.03 to −22.94).
The results of the post hoc analysis of primary and sec-

Discussion
This RCT tested the effectiveness of a brief lay health worker–
administered multicomponent intervention in Peshawar,
Pakistan, a low-income setting affected by ongoing conflict
and insecurity. The outcome evaluation indicated improve-
ments in anxiety, depression, and other secondary outcome

measures immediately after the 5-week intervention and at
3 months’follow-up. Improvement across all dimensions of
anxiety, depression, trauma-related symptoms, and func-
tioning demonstrated the effectiveness of the transdiagnos-
tic feature of the intervention.
A key study strength was that it was successfully con-
ducted in a challenging and insecure real-life setting.
Bomb blasts and armed attacks in public places as well as
threats and attacks on polio vaccination teams (which oper-
ate from primary care centers) were frequent in the area.34
The intervention was delivered by the most widely (and in
many cases, the only) available human resource for health
in such settings: lay workers with no prior mental health care
experience. The results show that the lay workers can be suc-
cessfully trained and supervised to effectively deliver
the psychological intervention in primary care settings.
The results of this trial demonstrate the feasibility of the task-
shifting approach (a task normally performed by a specialist
is transferred to a worker with a different or lower level of
education and training, or to a person specifically trained
to perform a limited task only, without having a formal
health education) and are consistent with what our group
and others have found in relation to task shifting in mental
health care.35-38
The study has several limitations. First, we were able to
access only about 40% of the sample at 1-week posttreat-
ment follow-up mainly owing to movement restriction fol-
lowing high security risk to the research team around that
time. This was because of attacks on polio vaccination
workers and threats of violence to all health care staff. This
illustrates the ethical and logistic challenges of undertaking
community-based research in conflict settings.39 However,
the risk of bias due to this limitation is likely to be small:
there were similar rates of attrition across both groups of
the trial; there was a high response rate at the subsequent
3-month follow-up when the situation was relatively stable;
and the use of mixed models in the context of repeated out-
come measurement analyses using the random-effects
model adjusts for bias induced by missing values. Second,
there was an improvement in the control group receiving
enhanced usual care. While this could be attributed to
regression to the mean, the possible contamination of the
control group with elements of intervention cannot be
entirely ruled out as the health workers and participants
attended the same health care facilities and may have inter-
acted. Third, the duration of sustained benefit or mecha-
nisms for this brief psychological intervention have yet to
be determined. Future studies should explore which com-
ponent mediates effect, how long this lasts, and the feasibil-
ity and effect of booster sessions.40
The primary outcomes of this trial demonstrated an
approximately 3-point difference in both anxiety and depres-
sive scores, which is greater than the minimal clinically
important difference calculated for the HADS.21 Other studies
of nonspecialists, usually community health workers, in low-
income countries have also found similar effects.35 A number
of factors should be considered when interpreting these find-
ings. The studies were conducted in settings where interven-
tions for common mental disorders are practically nonexis-
tent despite the high prevalence of such disorders. It could be
hypothesized that in such settings even minimal interven-
tions can have some effect. This was manifested to some
extent in the improvement in outcomes found in the control
group in this trial. The participants in this trial were primary
care attendees identified by a physician for emotional dis-
tress and may have been motivated to respond. Moreover,
the intervention, while simple to deliver, is based on empiri-
cally supported principles. Finally, the lay health workers
were recruited from the local population, which means that
they could relate well to their clients, and were supervised by
more experienced clinicians.
Conclusions
Among adults impaired by psychological distress in a conflict-
affected area, lay health worker administration of a brief
