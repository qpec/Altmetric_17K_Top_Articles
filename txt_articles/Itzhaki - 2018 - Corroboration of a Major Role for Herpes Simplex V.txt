Strong evidence has emerged recently for the concept that herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV1) is a major risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This concept proposes
that latent HSV1 in brain of carriers of the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E
gene (APOE-ε4) is reactivated intermittently by events such as immunosuppression,
peripheral infection, and inflammation, the consequent damage accumulating, and
culminating eventually in the development of AD. Population data to investigate this
epidemiologically, e.g., to find if subjects treated with antivirals might be protected
from developing dementia—are available in Taiwan, from the National Health Insurance
Research Database, in which 99.9% of the population has been enrolled. This is being
extensively mined for information on microbial infections and disease. Three publications
have now appeared describing data on the development of senile dementia (SD),
and the treatment of those with marked overt signs of disease caused by varicella
zoster virus (VZV), or by HSV. The striking results show that the risk of SD is much
greater in those who are HSV-seropositive than in seronegative subjects, and that
antiviral treatment causes a dramatic decrease in number of subjects who later develop
SD. It should be stressed that these results apply only to those with severe cases
of HSV1 or VZV infection, but when considered with the over 150 publications that
strongly support an HSV1 role in AD, they greatly justify usage of antiherpes antivirals
to treat AD. Three other studies are described which directly relate to HSV1 and AD:
they deal respectively with lysosomal changes in HSV1-infected cell cultures, with
evidence for a role of human herpes virus type 6 and 7 (HHV6 and HHV7) in AD,
and viral effects on host gene expression, and with the antiviral characteristics of
beta amyloid (Aβ). Three indirectly relevant studies deal respectively with schizophrenia,
relating to antiviral treatment to target HSV1, with the likelihood that HSV1 is a
cause of fibromyalgia (FM), and with FM being associated with later development
of SD. Studies on the link between epilepsy, AD and herpes simplex encephalitis
(HSE) are described also, as are the possible roles of APOE-ε4, HHV6 and HSV1 in
epilepsy.

Herpes Virus and Alzheimer’s Disease
INTRODUCTION
The viral concept of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) proposes that
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) in brain of apolipoprotein E
gene (APOE-ε4) carriers accounts for some 60% of cases (Itzhaki
et al., 1997). Most of the population is infected with this virus
by the age of 70. The concept postulates that HSV1 travels
to the brain probably in middle age, where it remains in a
latent state, with very limited transcription and probably very
low or zero protein synthesis. Reactivation from latency occurs
intermittently, caused by events such as immunosuppression,
peripheral infection and inflammation. Accumulation of the
consequent damage—direct viral action and major inflammatory
effects—leads eventually to the development of AD (Wozniak
and Itzhaki, 2010).
The main initial discovery on which this concept was based
was that HSV1 DNA was detectable in brain of both AD patients
and elderly normal people (i.e., the latter were infected but were
asymptomatic; Jamieson et al., 1991), the two groups differing
in that most of the AD patients were APOE-ε4 carriers (Itzhaki
et al., 1997). It was therefore suggested that APOE-ε4 carriers
suffer either greater viral damage on reactivation or have poorer
repair of such damage. In a striking parallelism in the PNS,
APOE-ε4 was found to be a risk for cold sores (herpes labialis),
which are caused mainly by HSV1 (Itzhaki et al., 1997). Also
in genital herpes, caused usually by HSV2, APOE-ε4 is a risk
for recurrence of genital ulcers (Jayasuriya et al., 2008). The
subsequent finding that antibodies to HSV (these are known
to be long-lived after herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE)) were
present in cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients and age-matched
controls showed that productive HSV1 infection had occurred,
indicating that HSV1 is not a passive resident in the central
nervous system (CNS; Wozniak et al., 2005). The data cannot
be explained by a greater susceptibility of AD sufferers, or
of APOE-ε4 carriers, to HSV1 infection, as the virus was
present in brain at almost the same frequency in AD patients
as in the controls, and was far more frequent among non-
APOE-ε4 carriers than among APOE-ε4 carriers in the controls
(although admittedly, the numbers in each category were very
small).
Links between HSV1 action and AD (Tables 1, 2) include
the discovery that the viral DNA is located very specifically
within AD plaques (Wozniak et al., 2009a), and that the
main component of plaques, beta amyloid (Aβ), accumulates
in HSV1-infected cell cultures (Wozniak et al., 2007; De
Chiara et al., 2010; Santana et al., 2012), and in the brains of
HSV1-infected mice (Wozniak et al., 2007); subsequently others
confirmed and extended these results (see review, Wozniak and
Itzhaki, 2010). Taken together, the data suggest that HSV1 is a
cause of Aβ products and plaques. We and others have shown too
that the main component of tangles—an abnormal form of the
protein called tau (P-tau)—accumulates in HSV1-infected cell
cultures (Zambrano et al., 2008; Wozniak et al., 2009b; Alvarez
et al., 2012).
It should perhaps be stressed that the viral concept does
not preclude a major role for Aβ and P-tau in the etiology
of AD, even though their effects are still little understood;

instead it suggests a cause of their accumulation—namely,
HSV1 infection. Further, in HSV1- infected cells in culture,
treatment with various types of antiviral have been found
to decrease the level of Aβ and particularly, that of P-tau
(see e.g., Wozniak et al., 2011). Usage of antivirals such
as acyclovir (ACV), which inhibits viral DNA replication,
showed that P-tau formation depends on viral DNA replication,
whereas Aβ formation does not do so; inhibition of the
latter by such agents probably occurs via inhibition of virus
spread.
DETECTION OF HSV1 IN BRAIN AND
EVIDENCE FOR ITS ROLE IN AD
The presence of HSV1 in brain is central to these concepts.
Following its discovery in elderly brains by the author’s group,
studies by five other groups confirmed its presence there
(see review, Wozniak and Itzhaki, 2010). Other data too
have provided confirmation—sometimes indirect, from very
diverse types of approach (Table 2 and see review, Itzhaki,
2014), including studies on HSV1-infected APOE-transgenic
mice or APOE-transfected cell cultures, GWAS, epidemiological
investigations on anti-HSV1 IgG and IgM antibodies in serum
from AD patients, or on infectious burden, and measurement
of IgG avidity index (Agostini et al., 2016) as an indicator
of reactivation (IgG presence indicates infection with HSV1,

and IgM indicates HSV1 recent reactivation). The results
showed an association between systemic infections and cognitive
decline, with HSV1 particularly implicated, and many authors
explicitly stating that their results supported a viral role
in AD.
However, two recent articles (Olsson et al., 2016; Pisa et al.,
2017) maintained that HSV1 is present in only a small proportion
of brains of elderly people and AD patients. In the former study,
the reason was probably usage of old fixed material, long duration
of storage—known to be detrimental to PCR. However, in neither
study did the authors specify the sensitivity of their PCR, so the
level in some of their brain samples might well have been below
their detection limit. The main topic of the other study was a
search for fungi in brain; the authors stated that they detected
HSV1 DNA in only 1 out of 10 brain samples (Pisa et al., 2017).
However, as in the Olsson et al. (2016) study, the authors did
not state the sensitivity of detection, and no recovery experiments
were described, i.e., addition of HSV1 DNA to samples that were
apparently virus DNA-negative to find if any contaminant was
interfering with detection of the viral DNA. The second study
sought also specific HSV1 proteins by immunohistochemistry
(IHC), using fixed brain slices, and HSV1-infected HeLa cell
cultures as ‘‘controls.’’ However, the level of virus and viral
proteins in human brain would have been vastly less than in the
infected cell cultures—so unsurprisingly, their IHC results were
negative.
Another aspect linking HSV1 to AD, and relating also to the
degradation of Aβ, is lysosomal impairment, which many studies
have shown contributes to neurodegeneration, neurons being
particularly susceptible to lysosomal damage. Very recently,
Kristen et al. (2018) found that in cell cultures, HSV1 infection
and also oxidative stress (OS) increased lysosomal load and
impaired lysosomal function, the impairment including a
reduced activity of lysosomal hydrolases and cathepsins, and in
the case of OS, effects on the maturation of the cathepsins. Such
changes could account for the accumulation of lysosomes and
decreased functionality of lysosomal proteins, which are known
to occur early in the development of AD. The authors pointed out
that several polymorphisms associated with AD, such as APOE,
ABCA7, CD2AP and Phosphatidylinositol Binding Clathrin
Assembly Protein (PICALM) are associated also with the
HSV1 life cycle, and that some of these lead to abnormalities in
autophagy. All these data support the involvement of lysosomal
damage in the development of AD, resulting in inefficient
removal of toxic substances from cells, and they support the role
of HSV1 in AD. The fact that the concentration of lysosomal
proteins is known to be higher in AD patients’ brains and CSF
might reflect attempts by cells to rectify the impairment of the
lysosomal system.
Two other very recent publications which are consistent
with the viral concept of AD have elicited much interest and
publicity, resulting in some previously sceptical opponents of
the viral concept conceding some possibility of its validity. The
first, by Readhead et al. (2018), analyzed the transcriptomes
of brain samples from AD patients and controls, using four
independent cohorts from different geographical regions of
the USA. They found that herpesviruses 6A and 7, and also
HSV1, were present in elderly and AD brains, the levels
of HHV6 and HHV7 being significantly higher in the AD
samples than in the controls, in three of the four cohorts.
Their results substantiate and augment earlier studies detecting
HHV6 (Lin et al., 2002) and HSV1 (Jamieson et al., 1991)
in elderly brains (which revealed a similar frequency of
HSV1 in brain of AD patients and controls but a much
higher HHV6 frequency in patients (see also review, Hogestyn
et al., 2018). Readhead et al. (2018) found also an association
of virus levels with clinical dementia rating, neurofibrillary
tangle density and amyloid plaque density. Plaque size too
was affected by virus presence, as they showed by suppressing
the gene for miR-155, a neuroprotective micro RNA: miR-155
knockout mice were crossed with APP/PS1 mice and it was
found that the progeny had more and larger plaques than the
APP/PS1 controls. Importantly, their analysis of protein and
mRNA levels suggested that infection with these viruses causes
changes in several transcriptional regulators (including several
regulators of APP processing and AD risk-associated genes
such as gamma-secretase subunit presenilin-1 (PSEN1), BACE1,
Clusterin (CLU), PICALM. These data too are consistent with
earlier studies using GWAS on associations between microbes,
particularly herpesviruses, and AD, as described by Licastro et al.
(2011) and Carter (2013). Lin et al. (2002) raised the possibility
that HHV6 infection might be merely an opportunistic infection,
but suggested that it was more likely that HHV6 acts in
concert with HSV1, as studies by others had shown that
HHV6 augments the damage caused by other viruses in animal
tissue and in cell cultures. Also, the data of Readhead et al. (2018)
argue against HHV6 and HHV7 being merely opportunistic

infections, in that they reveal association between virus levels
and levels of various characteristic AD features, as mentioned
above.
The second article, by Eimer et al. (2018), extends greatly
previous antimicrobial research by the group, and by Bourgade
et al. (2015) specifically on the antiviral properties of Aβ, the
deposition of which they describe as an innate immune response
to infection. The authors found that HSV1 and HHV6 can induce
amyloid plaque production in infected mice within 24–48 h, and
that Aβ oligomers inhibit HSV1 infection in 3-D human neural
cell culture models, and protect 5XFAD transgenic mice from
acute viral encephalitis. They showed also that Abeta, probably
in the form of a soluble oligomer, ensnares the virus through
its heparin-binding domain via the viral envelope glycoproteins,
thereby protecting brain cells from infection; fibrilization of
the amyloid cloak occurs rapidly. This cloaking echoes the
suggestion by Robinson and Bishop (2002) that amyloid acts
protectively by entombing pathogens—a then heretical notion
that was either ignored or derided. Cloaking is consistent also
with the finding that in AD brains, HSV1 DNA is very specifically
located within amyloid plaques (Wozniak et al., 2009a).
Both sets of authors acknowledge that their very interesting
data show association of herpesvirus with AD but cannot prove
causality. In contrast, and very importantly from the viewpoint of
AD patients especially, population studies in Taiwan published in
the last 12 months do provide evidence of causality.
EVIDENCE FROM POPULATION
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES FOR A ROLE
OF HSV1 AND OTHER HERPES VIRUSES
IN DEMENTIA
Three very significant publications have appeared in the current
year, all providing data on the health and illnesses of a population
over several years—information which is not available in the
UK1 nor, probably, in most other countries. In Taiwan, there are
records of over 99% of the population and it seems that the data
are being exhaustively mined by Taiwanese epidemiologists for
links between, for example, various viruses, and certain chronic
disorders, including senile dementia (SD). These are yielding
important results. All three articles describe data on herpes virus
infections—a family of viruses that affects the vast majority
of people worldwide, at least by the age of 60 or so. These
viruses, once in the body, are harbored there for life, usually
in a latent state but can be reactivated to an active, replicative
state. Only a certain proportion of those infected actually show
overt symptoms; the remainder are asymptomatic (as is the
case for many or perhaps all microbial diseases). In the Taiwan
publications, the word ‘‘infection’’ is used to denote people who
showed overt signs of the disease such as shingles or recurrent
cold sores or genital sores, rather than for all those who carry the
virus asymptomatically in either a latent or an active, productive

state. Also, the term ‘‘SD’’ is used rather than AD because in some
cases the diagnosis was uncertain.
Two of the articles investigated varicella zoster virus (VZV)
infection in relation to long-term neurocognitive changes and
the development of dementia. VZV causes chicken pox, but
after acute infection it remains in the body lifelong in latent
form, and in some people in older age it reactivates, causing
shingles, which both sets of authors referred to as herpes zoster
(HZ) and the virus as HZV. The first article, by Tsai et al.
(2017), investigated 846 patients (mean age 62.2 years) who
were diagnosed with HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) in 2005 and who
developed dementia in the following 5 years. The development
of dementia was compared with that of an age-matched control
group of 2,538 subjects during the same 5-year period. The
percentage of patients with HZO who developed SD was 4.16%,
whereas that of the controls was only 1.65% (P < 0.001), and
the crude hazard ratio of developing SD within 5 years of
HZO diagnosis was calculated to be 2.97 after adjustment for
patients’ characteristics and co-morbidities. This represents a
remarkably high risk of developing dementia amongst HZO
sufferers.
In the second article, by Chen et al. (2018), 39,205 patients
with HZV, age range 54–90, were diagnosed during the period
1997–2013 and were followed over an average period of
6.2 years. The incidence of dementia was compared with that
of 39,205 controls (mean age of both groups was 63.5 years).
The hazard ratio was only very small, namely, 1.11. A possible
explanation for this marked difference from the HZO results
is that in HZO the virus is more likely to enter the brain
and cause damage there than in HZV infection. However, HZ
patients who were treated with antiherpes antivirals—acyclovir,
valacyclovir, tromantadine, famciclovir—showed a dramatic
decrease in incidence of dementia to about a half of that in
the untreated group, adjusted HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40–0.77,
(P < 0.0001).
The third and most striking article, and the one directly
relevant to HSV1 and AD was by Tzeng et al. (2018a). The
authors investigated 8,362 subjects aged 50 years or over
during the year 2000 who were newly diagnosed with HSV1 or
HSV2 infections—presumably recurrent herpes labialis or genital
ulceration, on at least three outpatient visits within the year. The
control group of 25,086 age- and gender-matched subjects had no
HSV infection during the year 2000. The incidence of dementia
in both groups was investigated during the 10 years 2001–2010.
The risk of developing SD in the HSV group was found to be 2.56-
fold greater, 95% CI 2.351–2.795; P < 0.001), similar to the risk
associated with ophthalmic HZO infection. The main effect was
seen in those with HSV1 rather than HSV2 infections. Subtypes
AD and vascular dementia had similar risk profiles.
Even more strikingly, a group of HSV-infected patients
(N = 7, 215) who had been treated with one of various anti-herpes
agents
(acyclovir,
famciclovir,
ganciclovir,
idoxuridine,
penciclovir, tromantadine, valaciclovir (VCV—the biodrug
of ACV, which is better absorbed) and valganciclovir), showed
a dramatic reduction of almost 10 fold in the later incidence of
SD compared with those who received no treatment (N = 1,147;
relative risk factor = 0.092, 95% CI 0.079–0.108, P < 0.001). In the

subgroup with antiherpetic medications, 419 (5.80%) developed
dementia in the longitudinal follow-up within 10 years. In
the subgroup without antiherpetic medication treatment, 325
(28.33%) developed dementia in the same follow-up period;
relative risk factor = 0.092, 95% CI 0.079–0.108 (P < 0.001).
Thus, antiherpetic medications, either over-all (adjusted HR:
0.092, 0.079–0.108, p < 0.001) or individual antivirals, were
associated with decreased risk of developing dementia (Table 3).
The protection was greater in those treated for longer time
periods (over 30 days vs. less than 30 days) but the effect is
remarkable anyway in showing that treatment for periods of
relatively short duration could prevent the (presumably) later
processes in brain which ultimately led to the development
of AD. In the case of HZ patients, whether the antiviral
treatment acted directly against HZV action if in brain, or
against HSV1 reactivated in brain by HZ-induced inflammation
is unknown; the latter seems more likely in view of the
fact that HZV DNA has not been detected in any elderly
or AD brains (Lin et al., 1997). In theory (though probably
not in practice), a direct effect of any microbe in brain as
opposed to an effect of HSV1 reactivated by microbe-induced
inflammation could be tested by treatment with an antiviral
that targets only HSV1, but current antiherpetics are not
HSV1-specific, and anyway, such treatment might be ethically
dubious.
The mechanism of this action is unknown. To speculate,
it might involve prevention by anti-viral treatment (AVT) of
the virus reaching the CNS—based on the assumption that
this passage occurs in middle age, when the immune system
starts to decline. This seems plausible as all the subjects with
HSV1 infection were ≥50 years old and were selected on the
basis of having had newly diagnosed HSV1 infection during the
period January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000. The virus might
not therefore have reached their brain, as although primary
infection must have occurred before the diagnosis—and possibly
much earlier (for in some cases overt symptoms occur well after
primary infection), the virus level might have been too low to
lead to passage to the brain. AVT, which stops HSV1 replication,
would have reduced the level in the periphery, thereby decreasing

the chance of its reaching the brain. However, it seems likely that
AVT, rather than blocking viral passage, probably delayed it. This
could be checked by extending the survey further, perhaps from
2010 to 2017, to find if the number of dementia cases increased
(though there would be an increase also in death rate with age).
Investigations post mortem to seek HSV1 DNA in the brain of
any such subsequent cases of dementia, and in some of those
who remained free of the disease, might help to clarify the effect
of AVT.
All these data, together with the data on HSV1 presence in a
high proportion of elderly brains (Jamieson et al., 1991), and its
association with APOE-ε4 in AD patients (Itzhaki et al., 1997),
strongly support a causal role of HSV1 in AD, and support
also the likelihood that antiherpetic treatment—probably more
effective if combined with anti-inflammatory treatment—could
be used to prevent disease occurrence or to slow disease
progression. However, there are no data on the effect of
antivirals on those already suffering the disease. Indeed, the
fact that antiviral treatment was very effective in reducing the
incidence of dementia, when given before any overt signs of
dementia were apparent, suggests that treatment to prevent
the disease would be more likely to succeed if carried out
before middle age (say between ∼30–40 years), even if the
treatment were for only a relatively short period, rather than
if given after the onset of AD. In the UK, the proportion of
30–40 year old group who are HSV1-seropositive is at most
∼70% (Looker et al., 2015), and the proportion of that age-group
who are carriers of an APOE-ε4 allele is ∼25%, so overall, only
approximately 18% (0.7 × 25%) of the age group would be
most at risk and therefore most likely to benefit from antiviral
treatment, which, it should be noted, is very safe and relatively
inexpensive.
Another
uncertainty
exists
because
the
treated
group
comprised only those who had severe herpes labialis or severe
genital ulcers (as they were selected only if they had made at
least three outpatient visits in the year 2000). What proportion
these severe cases constituted of those who eventually developed
dementia and were HSV1-seropositive and APOE-ε4 carriers, is
uncertain, though it is probably very low. Thus, it is unknown
if subjects who are HSV1-seropositive and APOE-ε4 carriers,
but who are only mildly affected or are asymptomatic,
would be as susceptible to treatment. Nonetheless, it seems
extremely likely that the results of the Taiwanese studies would
apply also to the many AD patients who, although HSV1-
seropositve, never previously displayed overt symptoms of the
infection.
Despite the uncertainties mentioned above, as well as others
such as what future modes and timing of treatment should be
used, these epidemiological results represent a very important
new step to the problem of understanding and treating those
AD cases probably caused by HSV1 (Itzhaki and Lathe, 2018).
It is worth stressing though that these data and the preceding
evidence for a role of HSV1 in AD, do not preclude a role
for bacteria, in particular, Borrelia, Chlamydia pneumoniae,
and some oral bacteria, which are probably the microbes most
strongly implicated in AD (see review, Miklossy and McGeer,
2016): one or more such microbes might be involved, leading

to the disease in the sizeable proportion of AD patients whose
illness is not accounted for by HSV1 (in combination with
APOE-ε4).
RECENT DATA FROM OTHER DISEASES
RELEVANT TO HSV1 AND COGNITIVE
DECLINE AND TO ANTI-VIRAL
TREATMENT
Three other publications are particularly interesting, even though
none deals directly with the issue of HSV1 in brain and AD. The
first relates to certain cognitive features and HSV1. A number
of studies have shown that HSV1-seropositivity is associated
with cognitive dysfunction—particularly in schizophrenic (SZ)
patients. Bhatia et al. (2017) investigated temporal changes in
various cognitive features over a period of 1–3 years, mean
follow-up time 1.93 years, and also the effect of VCV, comparing
the changes in HSV1 seropositive and seronegative SZ and
control subjects. Emotion Identification and Discrimination
(EMOD), spatial memory and spatial ability were investigated in
131 HSV1-seropositive and 95 HSV1-seronegative people, mean
ages 35 and 32, respectively. EMOD was defined as ability to
discriminate between emotions and is considered an important
component of social cognition (Gur et al., 2010).
SZ subjects had significantly lower scores in all cognitive
domains. The HSV1-infected subjects had significantly lower
scores than uninfected subjects for the above cognitive features,
regardless of SZ diagnosis (p = 0.025, 0.029, 0.046, respectively,
and their values for EMOD decreased significantly more rapidly
(p = 0.033).
In the VCV study, 30 subjects were given VCV orally at 1.5 gm
twice daily for 16 weeks, and 32 subjects were given placebo,
while continuing with standard antipsychotic treatment. The
results indicated improvement in EMOD among HSV1 infected
persons with SZ, following VCV treatment (p = 0.048, Cohen’s
d = 0.43). The authors concluded that HSV1 infection was
associated with dysfunction in various cognitive features at study
entry in SZ patients and controls, and with greater temporal
decline in EMOD.
Another interesting study investigated fibromyalgia (FM) in
relation to HSV1. FM is characterized by chronic widespread
pain, fatigue, sleep disruption, and cognitive impairment.
Pridgen et al. (2017) treated patients with the antiherpetic
famciclovir (FCV), a nucleoside analog, in combination with a
Cox-2 inhibitor, celecoxib (combination referred to as IMC-1),
in a multicenter trial. Usage of the anti-herpes antiviral agent
was based on the hypothesis that the disorder is caused by
intermittent reactivation of latent HSV1 because of stress, etc.
Celecoxib was used not only because of its direct Cox-2 inhibition
but also because it has anti-herpes action. Several herpes viruses,
including HSV-1, are known to upregulate COX-2 (Liu et al.,
2014), and virally induced upregulation of COX enzymes is
important for efficient HSV-1 replication. COX-2 inhibition
reduces the severity of primary herpes virus lesions and inhibits
reactivation of latent infections (Higaki et al., 2009). FM
patients, mainly caucasian and female, age range 18–70 years,
were enrolled in a 16-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
proof-of-concept trial held in 12 centers. Randomized patients
received either IMC-1 or placebo. Fifty-seven patients completed
the 16-week course of treatment with IMC-1 and 45 patients
received a placebo (mean ages 51 and 48 years, respectively). The
outcome was assessed by standard ratings of pain, fatigue and
depression at baseline and weeks 6, 12 and 16 of the study.
The data showed a significant decrease in FM-related pain in
IMC-1-treated patients compared with those given the placebo.
The safety and tolerability profile for IMC-1 were encouraging.
The authors commented that the two drugs when used in
combination, might have acted additively and/or synergistically,
thereby increasing the efficacy. Previous investigators using them
separately had found that in contrast neither drug alone was
efficacious in the treatment of FM. They concluded that their
results supported the hypothesis that herpes virus infections may
contribute to this syndrome.
The third article concerns FM and dementia, pursued by
Taiwanese investigators again using the country’s insurance
data, the rationale being that inflammation-related diseases or
other pain disorders, such as headaches, have been shown to
be associated with increased risk of dementia. Tzeng et al.
(2018b) investigated 41,612 subjects with FM diagnosed between
January 1, and December 31, 2000, and 124,836 controls without
FM, matched for age, sex and index year. All subjects were aged
50 years or over. Patients were selected on the basis of having
made at least three outpatient visits within the 1-year study
period for FM or other co-morbidity. The risk of developing
dementia during the 10-year follow-up period to December
31, 2010, was investigated. The results showed that FM was
associated with increased risk of all types of dementia: 1,704 of
the 41,612 FM patients (21.23 per 1,000 person-years) developed
dementia, compared with 4,419 of the 124,836 controls (18.94 per
1,000 person-years). After adjustment for sex, age, etc. the
hazard ratio was calculated to be 2.77 (95% CI: 2.61–2.95,
P < 0.001). For the individual types of dementia, the risk
for AD was 3.35-fold, for non-vascular dementia 3.14-fold
(a group which, they acknowledge, might have included some
wrongly diagnosed AD patients), and for vascular dementia
2.72-fold.
Tzeng et al. (2018b) described several possible limitations, and
therefore concluded that the findings suggest association of FM
with dementia, rather than causation, and that a longer follow-up
period would help to clarify the long-term risks. However, in
view of the study by Pridgen et al. (2017) suggesting that herpes
virus infections may contribute to FM, the linking factor—and
probable causative agent—is HSV1.
HSV1 INFECTION OF MICE
Although there is increasing evidence in humans that long term
HSV latency correlates with increased risk of neurodegenerative
disease, few animal studies have focused on correlating long term
HSV infection in the CNS with functional cognitive/behavioral
endpoints. Beers et al. (1995) published the first report providing
evidence that spatial memory deficits were associated with HSV
infection in Lewis rats that had recovered from encephalitis;

Herpes Virus and Alzheimer’s Disease
this study was performed relatively soon after recovery from
primary infection and long-term effects were not evaluated. An
ongoing study is investigating whether long term-HSV latency
results in measurable differences in cognitive performance in
human-APOE-ε4 targeted knock-in transgenic mice (huApoE4;
Sawtell et al., 2018). In two independent studies, two groups
of mock infected and two groups of HSV-1 17syn + infected
(via the ocular route) huApoE4 mice were utilized. Mice were
monitored for overall health status, including weight, during the
entire study. With the exception of minor blepharitis during
acute stage of infection, no differences in overall health status
between mock and HSV-1 infected groups were observed. Signs
of encephalitis were not observed during acute infection and
mortality from viral infection did not occur. HSV latency in the
trigeminal ganglia and throughout the CNS was demonstrated
at 40 days post infection by real-time qPCR. At 12 months
post infection, groups of mice (n ≥ 16/group) were evaluated
in a number of tests including the Morris Water Maize
(MWM) which tests hippocampus-dependent spatial learning
and memory. Striking and significant differences in both studies
between HSV infected and mock infected groups were observed
in the MWM, suggesting alteration in hippocampal function.
Examination of hippocampal region revealed an ∼8-fold increase
in focal Aβ deposits. The investigators conclude that these
behavioral studies draw a solid link between long term HSV
latent infection and cognitive impairment in the context of the
huApoE4 allele.
LINKS AMONG EPILEPSY AND AD, APOE,
HHV6, HSV1 AND HERPES SIMPLEX
ENCEPHALITIS (HSE)
Increasing numbers of publications are linking epilepsy and AD
in showing that seizure-like activity in the brain is associated
with some of the cognitive decline seen in AD patients, and
that seizures are more common in AD than in the general
population. Also, the risk factors, APOE-ε4, HSV1 or HHV6 are
increasingly implicated in both disorders. The three latter factors
are discussed below.
AD patients have an increased risk of epilepsy and almost
50% have abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which
does not cause a seizure but is detectable by brain scan
technology. Lam et al. (2017) pointed out that amyloid plaques,
characteristic of AD in their numbers in brain, were first
described in 1892, in patients with epilepsy, and that AD
and epilepsy both impair cognition and show overlapping
patterns of cellular neurodegeneration and hypometabolism
in the temporal lobe. They added that interneurons are among
the first to die in AD mesial temporal cortex and that
the ensuing degradation of synaptic connectivity and circuit
remodeling could contribute to memory storage and retrieval.
Intermittent temporal lobe dysrythmia could therefore account
for early fluctuations in cognition in AD patients. The authors
investigated mesial temporal activity in two AD patients
with fluctuating cognition but with no previous history of
seizures, using intracranial foramen ovale electrodes, and
detected clinically silent hippocampal seizures and epileptiform
spikes during sleep, a period when both were most likely
to interfere with memory consolidation. They suggested that
early development of occult hippocampal hyperexcitability might
contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.
In a recent feasibility study (Musaeus et al., 2017), an
anti-epileptic drug was tested for its potential impact on the
brain activity of patients with mild AD in a double-blind within-
subject study. Seven patients were investigated on three separate
occasions: their baseline EEG was examined and then they were
injected with either a placebo or with the anti-seizure drug
levetiracetam, at either a low dose (2.5 mg/kg) or a higher dose
(7.5 mg/kg). Each patient eventually got one dose of each type,
in random order. After injection, patients underwent magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to measure blood flow in the brain
to quantify brain activity and detect its location in the brain,
and they took standard cognitive tests for memory, executive
functioning, naming, visuospatial ability and semantic function,
all of which are affected in AD. The higher doses of the
anti-seizure drug were found to normalize abnormalities in the
patients’ EEG profiles, increasing brain wave frequencies that
had been abnormally low, and decreasing those that had been
abnormally high. Although the authors found no improvement
in cognitive function after a single dose of medication, they plan
a longer and larger study.
There is also an amyloid connection between epilepsy and
AD: Joutsa et al. (2017) investigated 41 people who had suffered
childhood-onset epilepsy (one in a hundred develop the disorder
before age 18), and were then followed for 50 years until late
middle age, and 46 matched population-based controls, using
positron emission tomography scanning. The aim was to find
if there was a predisposition to development of progressive
neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, as indicated by Aβ
accumulation, and to find if APOE genotype is a factor. The
authors reported that the middle-aged adults who had developed
childhood epilepsy had more amyloid plaques in their brains
than matched controls without epilepsy. Plaque accumulation
was especially great in APOE-ε4 carriers. The subjects had had
a variety of different epilepsy syndromes and were in remission.
Many had not had anti-epileptic drug therapy for decades which,
the authors suggested, linked the increased brain Aβ to the
pathophysiology of epilepsy rather than to seizure control or
duration of active epilepsy, and might help to explain why
childhood epilepsy could lead to cognitive disorders such as AD.
There have been a number of studies specifically on the
involvement of APOE, and also of HSV1 and HHV6, in
epilepsy. The role of APOE in epilepsy development is still
controversial, some studies showing that ApoE-ε4 is associated
with an increased risk of medically refractory epilepsy, of late
post-traumatic seizures and of non-lesional mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy (MTLE), while other studies found no association
in non-lesional TLE patients nor in MTLE with hippocampal
sclerosis (MTLE-HS) patients (Leal et al., 2017). An association
between this isoform and age of onset of temporal lobe
epilepsy was found in several studies; also, the APOE-ε4 allele
has been associated with cognitive impairment in epileptic
patients. Leal et al. (2017) aimed to elucidate the importance
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Itzhaki
Herpes Virus and Alzheimer’s Disease
of febrile seizures (FS) and the role of APOE in MTLE-HS
development. They described MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis
(MTLE-HS) as the most frequent pharmaco-resistant epilepsy,
with most HS patients having suffered CNS infection, head or
birth trauma or FS, the latter being the most common injury.
Their results showed no differences in APOE-ε4 frequencies
between MTLE-HS patients and controls or between MTLE-HS
subgroups, but APOE-ε4 carriers had an earlier MTLE-HS onset,
as did MTLE-HS patients with FS antecedents compared with
non-FS antecedents. They concluded that although APOE-ε4 and
FS might not be involved in aetiopathogenic mechanisms of
MTLE-HS, these factors could speed up disease development in
predisposed individuals.
Other mainly negative findings included that of Li et al. (2016)
who investigated Han Chinese and found no association between
APOE-ε4 carriage and the age of onset, duration of epilepsy,
frequency of seizure, febrile convulsion history, or hippocampal
sclerosis, although they suggested that the ε4 allele was a possible
risk factor for non-lesional MTLE. Also, Lavenex et al. (2016)
detected no association between APOE polymorphisms and FS.
As to a viral involvement in epilepsy, Wipfler et al. (2018)
carried out a meta analysis of eight publications on HHV6 and
MTLE, all of which had used surgically removed tissue samples
from pharmaco-resistant patients. HHV-6 DNA was detected in
brain of 19.6% of all MTLE patients compared to 10.3% of all
controls (p > 0.05). As the authors state, these data indicate an
association between HHV-6 DNA and MTLE, although whether
it involves HHV6 types A or B or both is unknown, as also is
whether the association is causal.
HSE causes epilepsy and epilepsy surgery causes HSE
recurrence. HSE is caused by HSV1 and is the most common type
of viral encephalitis. It is an acute, rare but often fatal disease
of the brain. In the last few decades, treatment of HSE by ACV
and other antivirals has decreased mortality, but morbidity in
survivors is still high. In the author’s previous review (Itzhaki,
2017), it was pointed out that HSE is a major cause of seizures,
the occurrence of which is probably underestimated because of
their frequent subtlety. Unprovoked seizures often occur in the
post-acute phase (21 days from onset of initial symptoms) and
they resist treatment. If seizures occur during the acute phase,
there is a greater risk of post-encephalitic epilepsy, and hence of
poor long- term prognosis (Sellner and Trinka, 2012).
In a reverse effect, surgery for treatment of epilepsy can cause
the relapse of HSE, as described in several case reports: Bourgeois
et al. (1999), Kim et al. (2013), Uda et al. (2013), Lo Presti
et al. (2015), de Almeida et al. (2015) and Alonso-Vanegas et al.
(2016). HSE relapse presumably occurs because of reactivation
of existing HSV1 DNA in the brain caused by axonal cutting—a
known reactivator of the virus.
HSE has some links with AD, in that it leads not only to
seizures but also to memory deficits and behavioral changes,
resembling some of the changes seen in AD patients. Thus, there
are functional inks between HSE sequelae and AD, links between
AD and epilepsy, and HSE and epilepsy, probable links between
epilepsy and herpes viruses, possible links of epilepsy also with
specific APOE alleles, and much evidence linking HSV1 to AD.
The episodes of HSV1 reactivation which are postulated to
occur in brain of the elderly must necessarily be very limited
in extent as otherwise, they would lead to overt encephalitis.
In view of these connections, it seemed reasonable to consider
that HSE occurrence in APOE-ε4 carriers might lead to AD,
although it would be rare because of the rarity of HSE (approx
1–3 cases per million population). Relevant literature was
therefore searched to find if people who had suffered from HSE
have a greater risk of developing age-related cognitive decline,
and specifically of dementia or AD. Four published studies and
one unpublished survey showed an increase in dementia or,
specifically, of AD, amongst survivors of HSE, suggesting that
the survivors might have shared another characteristic which
added to a risk conferred by HSE—possibly, an APOE-ε4 allele,
but unfortunately, none of the studies investigated the APOE
genotype of their subjects (Itzhaki and Tabet, 2017).
There appear to be only two publications on APOE genotypes
of HSE patients, one of which implicated APOE-ε2 as a risk (Lin
et al., 2001). This would not necessarily invalidate the APOE-
ε4 hypothesis, as AD might develop mainly in those HSE patients
(some half of the total) who are not APOE-ε2 carriers. However,
a second study found no significant difference between HSE
patients’ genotypes and those of controls (Nicoll et al., 2001). The
reason for the difference is unknown. As to dementia occurring
also amongst survivors of non-HSE encephalitis (caused by
other herpesviruses, bacteria or parasites), possibly this is a
consequence of encephalitic damage in the CNS, which might
well cause reactivation of latent HSV1 if present.
TREATMENT OF HSE WITH ACYCLOVIR
AND RELEVANCE TO THE TREATMENT OF
HSV1-SEROPOSITIVE, APOE-ε4 AD
PATIENTS
The standard treatment for HSE is intravenous acyclovir,
following trials in the 1980s which assessed its efficacy. It
is strongly recommended that ACV should be given as soon
as possible during an attack (or even before the diagnosis
is certain, in suspected cases) because its usage leads to
a striking drop in mortality. However, all too often there
are serious sequelae of the illness, as mentioned above. As
to the efficacy of longer-term treatment than the standard
14–21 days, a clinical trial of neonates with ‘‘HSV disease
with CNS involvement’’ showed that prolonged oral dosing
of ACV for 6 months after the usual 14–21 days greatly
improved neurological outcomes (Kimberlin et al., 2011).
However, another study found, in contrast, that valacyclovir
treatment given for 90 days after standard intravenous ACV
did not benefit adult HSE patients (Gnann et al., 2015; who
were given 2 g thrice daily or placebo tablets).The primary
endpoint was survival, with no or mild neuropsychological
impairment at 12 months, as measured by the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE), and the Mattis Dementia Rating
Scale (MDRS). To explain this unexpected result, Tyler (2015)
pointed out that the patients in the study by Gnann et al.
(2015) were a select group, described by him as a relatively
high-functioning subset of HSE survivors. No seriously ill
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

Herpes Virus and Alzheimer’s Disease
patients were enrolled, so whether such patients or those
with associated immuno-compromising conditions might have
benefitted is unknown. Nonetheless, the patients in the adult
trial, treated and untreated, showed a remarkable extent of
recovery. By 2 years post-illness, some 90% of the subjects had
no or only mild impairment, as judged by either of the score
systems. In fact, most of the improvement occurred within the
first 90 days.
This high recovery group represents probably only a small
minority: Gnann and Whitley (2017) have estimated that only
40%–55% of sufferers are able to resume activities of daily living
at 12 months. To improve the high morbidity, they suggest
the usage of combinations of ACV—or VCV plus immuno-
modulatory drugs to reduce ongoing inflammation. A major
possibility would be treatment with the combination IMC-1 used
by Pridgen et al. (2017; see above).
As to the effects of treating AD patients long term, ACV
causes few side-effects except in renally impaired patients; these
should therefore be excluded from relevant trials. No ill effects
were seen when VCV was used for a 2 year period at a dosage of
3 g per day, in a clinical trial designed to investigate its efficacy
in treating multiple sclerosis (Friedman et al., 2005) and Pridgen
et al. (2017) found the safety and tolerability of their IMC-1 in
the 4-month treatment of their patients to be satisfactory.
CONCLUSIONS
Further population epidemiological work would be invaluable
for understanding the role of microbes, in particular HSV1, in
AD. Using the Taiwan records, or those of any other country
with comparable information, the subsequent development of
dementia amongst subjects who had suffered mild herpes labialis
or genital herpes could be investigated, although they would
be far less likely to be documented, and therefore much less
identifiable than severe cases. However, investigation of even
asymptomatic HSV-seropositive people vs. HSV-seronegative
people would be informative, although by the age of 60 the latter
would comprise only a very small minority. Also, individuals
could be selected who had suffered severe peripheral infections,
on the basis that the inflammation thus caused could lead to
inflammation in the brain, and reactivation of any latent microbe
there. Of particular interest would be those who had suffered
HSE, and also epilepsy patients—even those in whom no virus
infection had been reported. If tissue, blood, or salve samples
were available, APOE genotypes could be determined for any
association with other characteristics.
Clearly, the types of antiviral which might be used for treating
AD should be carefully chosen, especially if combined with an
anti-inflammatory agent, as well as the duration of treatment and
stage at which their usage would most effective. Even if the effects
were merely a delay in onset of the disease, this would still be
enormously beneficial for patients, carers and the economy. Of
course, vaccination against HSV1 would be the better option, as
prevention of disease is better than cure. Unfortunately, however,
there is currently no vaccine for HSV1 and any vaccine trial
would presumably have to extend for many years to find the
outcome.
Research data on a microbial cause of AD have been ignored
or dismissed for three decades, very unfortunately for those who
developed AD during that period and who therefore had no
chance of benefitting from the information. Surely, now is the
time to rectify the situation by determining and then using the
best means of treatment at hand.
