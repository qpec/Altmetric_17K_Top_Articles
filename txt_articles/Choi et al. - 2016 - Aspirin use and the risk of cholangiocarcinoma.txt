Abstract
Whether aspirin use is protective against cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains unclear. We 
determined the association between aspirin use and other risk factors for each CCA subtype 
individually. In a hospital-based case-control study, 2395 CCA cases (1169 intrahepatic, 995 
perihilar, and 231 distal) seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2000 through 2014 were 
enrolled. Controls selected from the Mayo Clinic Biobank were matched two to one with cases by 
age, sex, race, and residence (n 5 4769). Associations between aspirin use, other risk factors, and 
CCA risk were determined. Aspirin was used by 591 (24.7%) CCA cases and 2129 (44.6%) 
controls. There was a significant inverse association of aspirin use with all CCA subtypes, with 
adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.42), 0.34 (95% CI 
0.27-0.42), and 0.29 (95% CI 0.19-0.44) for intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal CCA, respectively (P 
< 0.001 for all). Primary sclerosing cholangitis was more strongly associated with perihilar (AOR 
5 453, 95% CI 104-999) than intrahepatic (AOR 5 93.4, 95% CI 27.1-322) or distal (AOR 5 34.0, 
95% CI 3.6-323) CCA, whereas diabetes was more associated with distal (AOR 5 4.2, 95% CI 
2.5-7.0) than perihilar (AOR 5 2.9, 95% CI 2.2-3.8) or intrahepatic (AOR 5 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.2) 
CCA. Cirrhosis not related to primary sclerosing cholangitis was associated with both intrahepatic

 and perihilar CCA, with similar AORs of 14. Isolated inflammatory bowel disease without 
primary sclerosing cholangitis was not associated with any CCA subtype.
Conclusions—: Aspirin use was significantly associated with a 2.7-fold to 3.6-fold decreased 
risk for the three CCA subtypes; our study demonstrates that individual risk factors confer risk of 
different CCA subtypes to different extents.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a cancer arising from the bile duct epithelium, is the second 
most common primary liver cancer. CCA is currently classified into three subtypes by 
anatomic location: intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar (pCCA), and distal (dCCA). Although 
these three subtypes share some commonalities, they are considered to be separate diseases 
due to the differences in their genetics, presentations, management, and outcomes.
The incidence of CCA has been increasing in the United States.(1) CCA is one of the most 
fatal cancers, with 5-year survival rates for iCCA and pCCA of 30%-40% after complete 
resection and a median survival of patients with unresectable disease of only 12-15 months.
(2,3) Due to limited treatment options and the dismal prognosis, the early detection of CCA 
and recognition of risk and protective factors are crucial for improving patient outcomes.
Parasitic infection of the biliary tract, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), bile duct cysts, 
hepatolithiasis, and toxins (e.g., Thorotrast) are established risk factors for CCA.(4–6) 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, and smoking have been proposed to be risk factors for CCA; but 
the available evidence remains conflicting.(4,6,7) This is in part due to the relatively low CCA 
incidence in Western populations, making it difficult to assemble large enough cohorts to 
achieve adequate power for statistical analysis. Accordingly, most previous studies on CCA 
risk factors combined pCCA and dCCA as extrahepatic CCA or combined all three subtypes 
together. Furthermore, Klatskin tumors, which are pCCA, may have been misclassified as 
iCCA under prior versions of the International Classification of Disease coding system, and 
this may have affected the attribution of risk factors for each CCA subtype.(8) Whether the 
identified risk factors confer risk to all CCA subtypes to a similar magnitude is not yet 
known. Because the three CCA subtypes are distinct molecular and clinical entities, it is 
important to determine the risk factors for each subtype separately.
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), an antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory agent, has been widely 
used to reduce occlusive vascular events and inflammation. Aspirin inhibits the 
cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, and its antiplatelet effect acts through inhibition of the 
COX-1 isozyme. Aspirin also inhibits the COX-2 isozyme, which is known to trigger 
inflammation and to contribute to the development of many cancers. Long-term follow-up of 
multiple randomized trials has revealed that aspirin reduced the risk of colorectal cancer 
after a delay of several years.(9) Also, daily aspirin significantly reduced the risk of death 
from gastrointestinal tract cancers both during and after the trials.(10) The putative 
chemopreventive effect of aspirin has been attributed to a number of pathways, including 
inhibition of COX-2, inhibition of nuclear factor jB activation, and regulation of DNA 
mismatch repair proteins.(11,12)

 Because overexpression of COX-2 was shown to promote growth and invasion of CCA cells, 
we hypothesized that aspirin use reduces the risk of CCA development. We therefore 
conducted a case-control study in a large CCA cohort to determine whether there is an 
association between aspirin use and CCA development. Secondarily, we comprehensively 
evaluated risk factors for CCA, including analyses stratified by the three CCA subtypes.
Patients and Methods
STUDY POPULATION
All CCA patients seen at the Mayo Clinic from January 2000 through December 2014 were 
included. All potential CCA cases were identified by searching the Mayo Clinic Life 
Sciences System database with the International Classification of Diseases-9 Clinical 
Modification codes of 155.1, 156.1, 156.2, 156.8, and 156.9 and the keywords 
“cholangiocarcinoma,” “bile duct cancer,” “intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,” “extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma,” “hilar cholangiocarcinoma,” “perihilar cholangiocarcinoma,” 
“Klatskin tumor,” and “distal cholangiocarcinoma” (n = 2865). CCA was unequivocally 
diagnosed by histopathology. Patients with mixed cholangiocarcinoma-hepatocellular 
carcinoma (n = 16), gallbladder cancer (n = 49), pancreatic cancer (n = 63), hepatocellular 
carcinoma (n = 63), ampulla of Vater cancer (n = 19), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 4), cancer 
of unknown primary origin (n = 37), and metastatic cancer from other primary sites to the 
liver (n = 24) were excluded. Fifteen patients diagnosed with CCA before the study period 
who had recurrence between 2000 and 2014 and another 180 patients with inadequate 
information to confirm the diagnosis of CCA were excluded. The final cohort comprised 
2395 CCA patients. Radiologic images (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance 
imaging, and/or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) were reviewed to 
delineate the anatomic tumor location. Classification of the tumor location was as described.
(13)
Control subjects were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Biobank. The Mayo Clinic Biobank 
comprises a collection of blood samples and health information provided with informed 
consent by Mayo Clinic patients and other community volunteers. Biobank participants 
allow access to all data from their Mayo Clinic medical records for health research. Fifty-six 
percent of Mayo Clinic Biobank participants had at least 15 years of electronic medical 
record (EMR) data, and 77% had at least two clinic visits per year and length of follow-up 
available in the EMR of greater than 1 year.(14) With the availability and continuity of data, 
the Mayo Clinic Biobank data set provides a good control group for epidemiologic studies 
of Mayo Clinic patients. The Mayo Clinic Biobank is not population-based, so it may not 
completely represent the general population; however, because the case group for this study 
was drawn from Mayo Clinic patients and not from the general population, the selection of 
matched controls from the Mayo Clinic Biobank helped to minimize selection bias. At the 
time of this study, 35,000 subjects were available for selection as controls. Cases were 
frequency-matched one to two with controls who participated in the Mayo Clinic Biobank 
from April 2009 through March 2015 for age (±5 years), sex, race, and residence (Olmsted 
County, Minnesota; Southeast Minnesota; Other Minnesota; Iowa; Wisconsin; North and 
South Dakota; and other regions of the United States [Northeast, Southeast, Southwest,

 Northwest, and Midwest]). Controls with a history of cancers other than nonmelanoma skin 
cancer were excluded. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review 
board.
CLINICAL INFORMATION
Clinical data were abstracted from the EMR. Data on risk factors of CCA cases were 
abstracted from the general health information form that is routinely completed by patients 
receiving care at the Mayo Clinic and added to the medical record. Self-reported data on risk 
factors of controls were gathered from the Mayo Clinic Biobank questionnaire. The EMRs 
of all study patients were then manually reviewed to confirm the accuracy of abstracted data 
and to maintain consistency of the data abstraction methods between cases and controls.
PSC was diagnosed by histopathology or clinical criteria as recommended by the PSC 
practice guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Cirrhosis 
was diagnosed by histopathology or radiographic evidence (nodular liver, caudate lobe 
hypertrophy, or portal hypertension). We also categorized subjects with cirrhosis but without 
PSC as non-PSC-related cirrhosis in order to evaluate cirrhosis as a risk factor for CCA. 
Biliary tract diseases included choledochal cyst and hepatolithiasis. IBD including ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn’s disease was diagnosed by histopathology or typical endoscopic findings. 
HBV and HCV infections were defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and positive 
HCV RNA, respectively. Because outside laboratory test results were not always abstracted 
into the medical record, we accepted as proof of viral infection a physician’s note reporting 
a diagnosis of HBV or HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis was diagnosed when a subject had histopathologic or radiologic evidence of 
fatty infiltration in the liver with elevation of liver enzymes after exclusion of other liver 
diseases and history of excessive alcohol intake (>140 and >70 g/week in men and women, 
respectively). Obesity was defined as body mass index 30 kg/m2. Ever-smoker was defined 
as any person having a history of smoking.
A history of aspirin use was determined from medication lists and physicians’ notes, which 
were manually reviewed at least 1 year before the index date (i.e., date of CCA diagnosis in 
CCA cases or date of Mayo Clinic Biobank enrollment in controls). Subjects were classified 
as current aspirin users if they were taking aspirin at least once per week at the index date. 
This definition was not altered if the medical record data indicated that aspirin was held 
during the investigation for CCA diagnosis or patients were advised by health care providers 
to avoid taking aspirin due to CCA-related symptoms. This definition prevents us from 
inflating the effect size of aspirin by underestimating the frequency of aspirin use in the case 
group. Patients who had ever taken aspirin but stopped taking aspirin 1 year or more before 
the index date were not coded as current aspirin users.
To determine the impact of aspirin dosage on CCA risk, aspirin dose was classified into two 
groups: low-dose aspirin (81-162 mg/day) and high-dose aspirin (≥325 mg/day). If the dose 
of aspirin had been changed during different time periods, the dose was determined by the 
dose at the time of study enrollment (i.e., at the time of CCA diagnosis for cases or at the 
time of Mayo Clinic Biobank enrollment for controls). Relevant factors influencing aspirin

 use including hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial 
fibrillation, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were also abstracted.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Comparisons were performed using the Student t test for continuous variables and the chi-
squared or Fisher exact test for categorized variables. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to identify factors associated with CCA development and to calculate odds ratios (ORs), 
adjusted odds ratios (AORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To avoid selection bias 
and potential confounding factors that might influence the chance of being prescribed 
aspirin, a multivariate analysis with propensity score adjustment was used to confirm the 
findings of the initial analyses. Propensity scores were computed by a binary logistic 
regression model consisting of the following input variables: age, sex, race, obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes, CVA, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial 
fibrillation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, PSC, cirrhosis, 
IBD, and smoking status. In addition to the main analysis, ORs of aspirin use stratified by 
tumor location were calculated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All 
analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R 
3.1.3. (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; http://www.r-project.org).
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Because the OR of PSC was dominant compared to other risk factors, sensitivity analysis 
excluding PSC patients was performed. Due to an imbalance between enrollment periods of 
cases (years 2000-2014) and controls (years 2009-2015), we performed sensitivity analyses 
categorizing the groups by CCA diagnosis year: group 1, 2000-2003; group 2, 2004-2007; 
group 3, 2008-2011; and group 4, 2012-2014. Changes in frequency of aspirin use and other 
variables over time in CCA cases were assessed by analysis of variance.
Information on the duration of aspirin use was available in the medical records only for 
45.1% of current aspirin users. To minimize the proportion of patients with missing 
duration-of-aspirin use data, we repeated the analyses restricting to the 1321 subjects (165 
cases/1156 controls, 18.4% of the entire cohort) living in the 11 counties in southeastern 
Minnesota that participate in the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP). The REP is 
described in detail in the Supporting Information. Data on the duration-of-aspirin use were 
available for 97% of current aspirin users in this subset. In addition to the REP subset, we 
performed a second analysis restricted to the 1968 subjects (613 cases/1355 controls, 27.5% 
of the entire cohort) resident in the state of Minnesota. Data on the duration-of-aspirin use 
were available for 90.4% of current aspirin users who were Minnesota residents. We also 
performed conditional logistic regression analysis for assessing risk factors for CCA in 2172 
cases and 4286 perfectly matched controls.

 cases and 2170 (45.5%) of controls. The mean ages were 61.5 and 61.6 years for cases and 
controls, respectively. The majority of the study population (95.5%) was white. The 
prevalences of PSC, biliary tract diseases, cirrhosis, HBV infection, HCV infection, IBD, 
diabetes, and smoking were higher in cases than in controls (P = 0.006 for HBV; P < 0.001 
for all others).
RISK FACTORS FOR CCA
By multivariate analysis, PSC was the most significant risk factor for CCA, with an AOR of 
171 (95% CI 72.6-404; P < 0.001) (Table 2). Biliary tract diseases (AOR = 12.1, 95% CI 
4.0-36.9; P < 0.001), non-PSC-related cirrhosis (AOR = 10.8, 95% CI 6.5-18.0; P < 0.001), 
HBV infection (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-7.4; P = 0.04), diabetes (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI 
2.3-3.3; P < 0.001), and smoking (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5; P < 0.001) were also 
associated with increased risk for CCA. Regardless of PSC, IBD was not significantly 
associated with CCA development (AOR = 1.4, P = 0.08).
Given the very high OR for PSC, the true magnitude of effect of other risk variables might 
be masked. After exclusion of PSC patients, biliary tract diseases had the highest OR (AOR 
= 59.4, 95% CI 7.9-449.7; P < 0.001), followed by cirrhosis (AOR = 10.8, 95% CI 6.5-18.0; 
P < 0.001), HBV infection (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-7.5; P = 0.04), diabetes (AOR = 2.8, 
95% CI 2.3-3.3; P < 0.001), and smoking (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.4; P < 0.001) 
(Supporting Table S1). These risk factor variables remained significant when the analysis 
was performed in perfect matching case-control pairs (Supporting Tables S4 and S5).
RISK FACTORS FOR EACH CCA SUBTYPE
The three subtypes of CCA cases were analyzed separately against their matching controls 
to determine the risk factors for each CCA subtype. PSC remained the most significant risk 
factor for all three subtypes, with AORs of 93.4 (95% CI 27.1-322), 453 (104-999), and 34.0 
(3.6-323) for iCCA, pCCA, and dCCA, respectively (P < 0.001 for iCCA and pCCA, P = 
0.002 for dCCA; Table 3). Non-PSC-related cirrhosis was associated with an increased risk 
for iCCA (AOR = 13.8, 95% CI 6.6-28.6; P < 0.001) and pCCA (AOR = 14.1, 95% CI 
5.9-33.7; P < 0.001) but not for dCCA (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI 0.6-21.2; P = 0.19). Diabetes 
also conferred a risk for all CCA subtypes, with the largest magnitude for dCCA (AOR = 
4.2, 95% CI 2.5-7.0), followed by pCCA (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI 2.2-3.8) and iCCA (AOR = 
2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.2) (P < 0.001 for all). Obesity, which was not associated with CCA 
development when the three CCA subtypes were combined, was inversely associated with 
the iCCA subtype only (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.92; P = 0.005). The AOR of smoking 
was highest for dCCA (1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7; P = 0.001), followed by pCCA (1.3, 95% CI 
1.0-1.5; P = 0.02) and iCCA (1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4; P = 0.03). These findings suggested that 
each risk factor conferred risk for each CCA subtype in different magnitudes.
CHARACTERISTICS OF ASPIRIN USERS
Five hundred ninety-one (24.7%) cases and 2129 (44.6%) controls were categorized as 
current aspirin users. Table 4 displays baseline characteristics of current aspirin users. The 
mean ages for aspirin users and nonusers were 69.3 and 59.0 years for cases and 66.8 and 
57.4 years for controls, respectively. The prevalence of factors potentially influencing the

 chance of taking aspirin, e.g., hypertension or CVA, was higher in current aspirin users than 
in nonusers in both cases and controls.
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ASPIRIN USE AND CCA RISK
CCA cases were significantly less likely to report use of aspirin than controls (OR = 0.41, 
95% CI 0.36-0.45; P < 0.001; Table 5). The result remained the same after adjusting for 
other potential risk factors for CCA (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.30-0.39; P < 0.001). 
Multivariate analysis with propensity score adjustment did not substantially alter the 
associations (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.44; P < 0.001). When stratified by CCA subtypes, 
the AORs were consistent for all three CCA subtypes, with AORs of 0.35 (95% CI 
0.29-0.42), 0.34 (0.27-0.42), and 0.29 (0.19-0.44) for iCCA, pCCA, and dCCA, respectively 
(P < 0.001 for all; Table 3).
Next, we determined the impact of dose, frequency, and duration of aspirin use on CCA risk. 
Low-dose aspirin (81-162 mg/day) was used by 384 (16.0%) cases and 1697 (35.6%) 
controls. Only 13 patients were administered 162 mg/day of aspirin. High-dose aspirin 
(≥325 mg/day) was used by 142 (5.9%) cases and 429 (9.0%) controls. The AORs were 0.29 
(95% CI 0.25-0.33) and 0.39 (0.31-0.49) for the doses of 81-162 and ≥325 mg/day, 
respectively (P < 0.001 for both). When considering the frequency of aspirin use, 560 
(23.4%) cases and 2008 (42.1%) controls took aspirin daily, resulting in an AOR of 0.34 
(95% CI 0.30-0.39) for the daily use of aspirin (P < 0.001). When stratified by duration of 
aspirin use as >3 years or 3 years, the AORs were 0.12 (95% CI 0.10-0.15) and 0.30 
(0.23-0.38) for aspirin use of >3 years and 3 years, respectively (P < 0.001 for both).
Sensitivity analyses, for which the data on duration of aspirin use were complete for 95.9% 
and 90.4% of the REP and Minnesota subsets, respectively, confirmed that aspirin use was 
statistically significantly associated with decreased CCA risk, with AORs of 0.41 (95% CI 
0.28-0.61) and 0.23 (0.18-0.30) for the REP and Minnesota subsets, respectively (P < 0.001 
for both).
Because the frequency of aspirin use in cases increased over time during the study period, 
i.e., 14.7%, 23.4%, 27.0%, and 31.1% in groups 1-4, respectively (P < 0.001 for trend; 
Supporting Table S2), subgroup analyses were performed to adjust for the differences in 
frequencies of aspirin current users. Current aspirin use still had an inverse association with 
CCA development when the analyses were restricted to case groups 2-4 (AOR = 0.37, 95% 
CI 0.33-0.43; P < 0.001), groups 3 and 4 (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.34-0.47; P < 0.001), or 
group 4 (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.36-0.58; P < 0.001; Supporting Table S3). These findings 
suggest that the protective effect of aspirin observed in this study is less likely to be due to a 
time-related bias.
Discussion
This is one of the largest hospital-based case-control studies evaluating risk factors for CCA 
in Western populations. We found that aspirin use had a significant inverse association with 
CCA development. Additionally, PSC, biliary tract diseases, non-PSC-related cirrhosis, 
HBV infection, diabetes, and smoking conferred risks of different magnitudes for the

 different CCA subtypes. This supports the hypothesis that the three CCA subtypes are 
distinct diseases and that each subtype thus has its own susceptibility to risk factors.
As anticipated, cirrhosis was significantly associated with CCA. Unlike in other studies 
where the effect of PSC was not taken into account, we investigated the association between 
liver cirrhosis (in the absence of PSC) and CCA risk to determine whether cirrhosis per se is 
an independent risk factor for CCA. We observed a strong relationship between non-PSC-
related cirrhosis and CCA, with a 14-fold increased risk of iCCA and pCCA (but not 
dCCA). Consistent with our previous study, diabetes was associated with risk for CCA, 
conferring the greatest risk for dCCA, followed by pCCA and then iCCA, suggesting that 
the role of diabetes in cholangiocarcinogenesis may differ in different CCA subtypes.(13)
It remains unclear whether IBD occurring in isolation from PSC is associated with CCA. 
Because IBD is usually accompanied by PSC, its impact on CCA risk may be confounded 
by the effect of the PSC.(4) In this study all analysis models, particularly when PSC patients 
were excluded, consistently demonstrated that isolated IBD was not related to CCA, 
suggesting that IBD by itself does not contribute to CCA risk. Similarly, obesity was not an 
independent risk factor for CCA when all subtypes were combined. Previous reports showed 
inconsistent findings for obesity and CCA risk.(4,6,13) Here, obesity was associated with a 
decreased risk for iCCA. This may be partially explained by the retrospective study design 
as the body mass index data were abstracted at the time of CCA diagnosis and the potential 
weight-loss due to cancer or cancer-related symptoms was not taken into account. The 
causal association between obesity and iCCA should be investigated in further studies, 
which ideally should include body mass index obtained when patients were in a healthy 
state.
Aspirin use was significantly associated with an approximately 3-fold reduction in CCA 
risk. Risk reductions by aspirin use were consistent across all three subtypes: 2.9-fold for 
iCCA, 2.9-fold for pCCA, and 3.4-fold for dCCA. This observation is biologically plausible 
as supported by preclinical studies of CCA and other cancers. In vitro studies have 
suggested that COX-2 is implicated in cholangiocarcino-genesis.(15–17) Overexpression of 
COX-2 promoted tumor growth and invasion in human CCA cells.(15–17) Additionally, 
selective COX-2 inhibitors and aspirin were shown to inhibit vascular endothelial cell 
proliferation in CCA cell or CCA-conditioned medium and partially prevented CCA cell 
growth in rats.(16) Thus, inhibition of COX-2 by aspirin may prevent CCA development 
through inhibition of inflammatory processes.(18) Aspirin-mediated inhibition of nuclear 
factor jB activation has been proposed as another mechanism of cancer prevention.(12) The 
anticancer effect of aspirin has been reported to be dose-dependent in studies of colon 
adenomas and colon cancer, suggesting that higher doses achieve more complete inhibition 
of the COX-2 isoenzyme.(19) However, in the present study, 79% of aspirin users in the 
Control group took low-dose (81-162 mg/day) aspirin; thus, the protective effect shown 
might be achieved even at low doses that do not completely inhibit COX-2. Recently, Wnt 
signaling was reported to enhance CCA growth and aspirin was shown to modulate Wnt 
signaling by both COX-dependent and COX-independent pathways.(20,21) Furthermore, 
aspirin may up-regulate tumor suppressor genes and stabilize DNA mismatch-repair

 proteins.(22) Altogether, these mechanisms may potentially contribute to the 
chemopreventive effect of aspirin.
The AOR of 0.34 in aspirin users detected in the main analysis was very small, suggestive of 
a very strong protective effect of aspirin. This raises the concern that we may be 
overestimating the impact of aspirin use on CCA prevention. To obtain a more reliable 
estimate, we performed a multivariate analysis with propensity score adjustment. With the 
propensity score adjustment, the estimated AOR of aspirin use was 0.38, which was very 
similar to the AOR of 0.34 estimated by the multivariate analysis without propensity score 
adjustment. These consistent findings indicated that aspirin use was significantly associated 
with a reduction in the risk of CCA regardless of the reason for taking aspirin. Interestingly, 
the AOR of aspirin use in this study was close to the AOR of 0.45 which was reported in a 
relatively small UK study of 81 CCA patients.(23) Similarly, another study, conducted in 
China of 191 patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer, demonstrated a comparable AOR of 
0.48 (95% CI 0.19-1.19) for aspirin ever-users, although statistical significance was not 
reached.(24) However, as the authors described, the prevalence of aspirin use in the Chinese 
study was assessed by self-report, without verifying information on aspirin use by medical 
record review; and their prevalence of aspirin use was very low, i.e., six (3.1%) of the 191 
cases. In our study, the prevalence of aspirin use was 44.6% in controls, which was close to 
the rates of 41% and 52% from two large US national surveys on aspirin use.(25,26) 
Therefore, our control group may be more representative of the general population, at least 
in terms of the frequency of aspirin use. Interestingly, aspirin users in the REP and 
Minnesota subsets of cases were 47.3% and 31.0%, respectively, which was higher than in 
the total population of cases (24.7%). When we compared baseline medical conditions that 
might influence aspirin use, the REP and Minnesota subsets had more CVA, cardiovascular 
disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes compared to the total 
population. However, similar trends were seen in the control group (Supporting Table S6).
Although our study of CCA, along with accumulating evidence from other cancers, has 
shown the benefit of aspirin use in cancer prevention, a consensus has not been reached 
regarding the optimal dose of aspirin for chemoprevention.(12) Nonetheless, 384/591 
(65.0%) aspirin users in cases and 1697/2129 (79.7%) aspirin users in controls took low-
dose aspirin. Thus, our finding implies that aspirin given at a dose of 81-162 mg/day may be 
enough to exert a protective effect against CCA. Intriguingly, the duration and a schedule of 
daily use of aspirin appear to be more important than the dose of aspirin in prevention of 
certain cancers. The Women’s Health Study, a randomized trial of 100 mg aspirin taken on 
alternate days, did not show a reduction in the incidence of cancers except lung cancer 
during 10 years of follow-up.(27) However, Rothwell et al. reported that when taken daily 
aspirin doses of at least 75 mg reduced the long-term incidence of colorectal cancer.(10) 
Moreover, previous observational studies have confirmed the importance of daily aspirin use 
in reducing the incidence of cancer.(28) Although we defined subjects who took aspirin at 
least once a week as current users of aspirin, >95% of current aspirin users in both case and 
control groups took aspirin daily.
Unlike most studies of risk factors for CCA, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
comprehensive report of risk factors for all three CCA subtypes. We were therefore able to

 show that each risk factor contributes to development of each CCA subtype in different 
magnitudes. Another strength of this study was the very large cohort size and the robust 
results, suggested by the fact that the estimated effect of aspirin in CCA prevention was 
consistent in all statistical analysis models.
There are some limitations to our study. First, we were not able to obtain detailed 
information on duration and dose of aspirin use in 442 (16.3%) current users, which limited 
our ability to determine possible time-response and dose-response associations between 
duration of aspirin use and CCA risk. Establishing a time-response and dose-response 
relationship will strengthen the associations in this type of study. In this study, the aspirin 
dosage was obtained at the time of study enrollment and could have varied before the 
patients were enrolled. Thus, we were not able to consider cumulative doses in the analysis. 
To overcome this limitation, we analyzed the data using two subsets, the REP and Minnesota 
subsets. The data on dose, frequency, and duration of aspirin use were complete in 97.0% 
and 90.4% of current users, respectively, in the REP and Minnesota subsets. The main 
finding was confirmed with comparable AORs of 0.34, 0.23, and 0.41 for the entire cohort, 
the Minnesota subset, and the REP subset, respectively. Interestingly, in the REP subset 
there was a significant association between aspirin use for >3 years and decreased risk of 
CCA development, with an AOR of 0.28 (95% CI 0.18-0.44; P < 0.001), compared to 
aspirin use ≤3 years, which was associated with a nonsignificant AOR of 0.80 (95% CI 
0.46-1.41; P = 0.8). Because previous studies showed a greater benefit in terms of cancer 
prevention and death in persons taking aspirin for more than 5 years, we might have 
observed a more significant association between the duration of aspirin use and CCA 
development in long-term aspirin users if we had more complete data. The second limitation 
was the discrepancy in enrollment periods between cases (years 2000-2014) and controls 
(years 2009-2015). The 2000-2014 period was used for cases in order to maximize the 
number of CCA cases, given the relative rarity of this cancer. Recently, Suissa et al. 
described time-related biases in observational studies of drug effects, primarily a risk in 
cohort studies but also possibly in case-control studies.(29) They underscored the importance 
of ensuring an equal time window for comparison of the drug exposure variable for cases 
and controls in order not to overestimate the effect of the drug.(29) To avoid and adjust for 
this potential time-related bias, we performed sensitivity analyses including cases and 
controls from 2009 through 2014. We detected a similar effect of aspirin with an AOR of 
0.45 (95% CI 0.36-0.58; P < 0.001), confirming the inverse relationship between aspirin use 
and CCA development observed in the main analysis. The third limitation is recall bias, 
which is always an inherent concern in case-control studies. However, recall bias is unlikely 
to apply to our study because all cases were asked whether they were taking aspirin and the 
self-reported questionnaires were completed as a routine part of the medical evaluation 
before seeing physicians at our institution. For controls, the Mayo Clinic Biobank 
participants were required to answer health-related questionnaires, which include their 
history of aspirin use. Lastly, we were not able to consider other possible chemopreventive 
drugs in our analysis. Our group has reported that metformin use was associated with a 
decreased risk of iCCA in diabetic patients.(13) For this study, we abstracted metformin use 
at the time of CCA diagnosis for cases or enrollment for controls but were not able to obtain 
detailed information on amount and duration of metformin use for our cohort. Thus,

 although the proportions of diabetic case and control patients using metformin were similar 
to our previous report, we could not fully assess the combined effects of metformin and 
aspirin due to the lack of detailed information. Similarly, we were also not able to assess the 
possible influence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on CCA in the 
analysis because of the heterogeneity of information on NSAID use, such as the diverse 
types of drugs, frequent dose changes, and frequency of intermittent use. Although NSAIDs 
have shown chemopreventive effects in certain types of cancer, two previous studies did not 
find a significant association between NSAID use and CCA.(23,30) Also, due to the 
retrospective nature of this study, we were not able to obtain detailed smoking histories, 
which might have allowed a determination of the dose-response relationship between 
smoking and CCA development.
Generally, the strongest evidence of the beneficial effect of aspirin for cancer prevention is 
drawn from randomized double-blind controlled trial designs, which minimize biases and 
confounders.(9,10) Compared with randomized control trials, our retrospective case-control 
study design achieves a lower standard of evidence. Given the relatively low incidence of 
CCA, it may be challenging to conduct a randomized trial of aspirin for CCA prevention. 
However, a randomized study of aspirin for CCA prevention in a well-defined high-risk 
population, such as PSC patients, might be feasible and potentially practice-changing. As an 
initial step toward this goal, we plan to perform a case-control study comparing aspirin use 
in PSC without CCA controls to PSC with CCA cases, to determine whether the protective 
effect of aspirin can be validated in patients with PSC. Moreover, genetic variation may 
influence the chemopreventive effect of aspirin on cancer. The effect of aspirin on colonic 
adenoma risk was shown to modify by variants in the gene encoding the UGT1A6 enzyme, 
which is responsible for delayed aspirin metabolism.(31) A recent study showed that the 
association between aspirin use and colorectal cancer varied by polymorphisms of single-
nucleotide polymorphism rs2965667 at chromosome 12 and rs16973225 at chromosome 15.
(32) It will be of interest to study the relationship between genetic variations and the 
chemopreventive effect of aspirin in CCA.
In conclusion, aspirin use was significantly associated with a lower risk for all three CCA 
subtypes. Importantly, we found that individual risk factors confer risk for different CCA 
subtypes to different extents. Because over 90% of patients in this cohort were Caucasian, 
this finding needs to be further validated in other ethnicities.
