Abstract
Background
In an effort to prevent continued increases in obesity and diabetes, in January 2014, the
Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density
�275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Limited
rigorous evaluations of food taxes exist worldwide. The objective of this study was to exam-
ine changes in volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in response to these
taxes in the entire sample and stratified by socioeconomic status (SES).
Methods and Findings
This study uses data on household packaged food purchases representative of the Mexican
urban population from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services (CPS).
We included 6,248 households that participated in the Nielsen CPS in at least 2 mo during
2012–2014; average household follow-up was 32.7 mo. We analyzed the volume of pur-
chases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014, using a longitudi-
nal, fixed-effects model that adjusted for preexisting trends to test whether the observed
post-tax trend was significantly different from the one expected based on the pre-tax trend.
We controlled for household characteristics and contextual factors like minimum salary and
unemployment rate. The mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 changed by -25
g (95% confidence interval = -46, -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what
would have been expected based on pre-tax (2012–2013) trends, with no corresponding
change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased on average 10.2%
less taxed foods than expected (-44 [–72, –16] g per capita per month); medium SES
households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected (-28 [–46, –11] g per capita
per month), whereas high SES households’ purchases did not change. The main limitations
of our findings are the inability to infer causality because the taxes were implemented at the
national level (lack of control group), our sample is only representative of urban areas, we

Conclusions
Household purchases of nonessential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after
the implementation of Mexico’s SSB and nonessential foods taxes. Future studies should
evaluate the impact of the taxes on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase
patterns (see S1 Abstract in Spanish).
Author Summary
• Why Was This Study Done?
� In January 2014, Mexico passed an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density
�275 kcal/100 g, including salty snacks, chips, cakes, pastries, and frozen desserts;
and a 1 peso/liter (~10%) tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.
� To date, there has been very limited research as to how larger health-related food/
beverage taxes change household food purchases, or whether low socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) households are more responsive to such taxes.
• What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
� Using a dataset that follows household food purchases over time, we examined
whether the volume of taxed foods showed greater declines in the post-tax period
than we would have expected based on trends in the volume of taxed food purchases
prior to the tax. We also examined whether post-tax changes in the volume of taxed
food purchases was greater among low SES households.
� We found that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 declined by 25 g
per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what would have been expected
based on pre-tax (2012–2013) trends.
� There were no changes in the purchase of untaxed foods in the post-tax period.
� Low SES households’ purchases of taxed foods declined by 10.2% and medium SES
households by 5.8%, whereas high SES did not change.
• What Do These Findings Mean?
� These findings show that in the post-tax period, purchases of taxed foods declined
more than we would expect if pre-tax trends had simply continued, particularly
among low and medium SES households. Future research should explore how these
shifts are linked to changes in the nutritional quality of the overall diet.

 Introduction
Currently, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Mexico is over 33% for children and
about 70% for adults [1,2], and, in 2006, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adults was
14.4% [3]. Concurrent with the rise in obesity and diabetes were large increases in sugar-
sweetened beverage (SSB) and nonessential energy-dense food (often termed “junk food”)
intake [4–7]. Worldwide, Mexico is the fourth largest per-capita consumer of energy-dense,
ultraprocessed food and drinks, including SSBs, sweet and savory snacks, breakfast cereals,
confectionery, ice cream, biscuits, spreads, sauces, and ready-meals [8]. To prevent contin-
ued increases in obesity and diabetes, in January 2014, the Mexican government imple-
mented a 1 peso-per-liter tax on SSBs (equivalent to approximately 10% tax) and an 8% tax
on nonessential foods with energy density �275 kcal/100 g. In Mexico, total prices including
the tax price are included on the shelf label, so the price consumers see includes the tax. The
law defined nonessential foods in the following categories: chips and snacks, candies and
sweets, chocolate, puddings, peanut and hazelnut butters, ice cream and ice pops, and
cereal-based products with substantial added sugar. Based on the 2012 National Health and
Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT), the intake of non-basic foods high in sugar or fat (a food
classification similar to the tax) contributes 11% to 18% of daily caloric intake across age
groups [9].
Worldwide, there is very limited empirical evidence on the effect of food/nutrient taxes
[10,11]. While analysis of Mexican food and beverage taxes revealed that during 2014 pur-
chases of taxed beverages declined 6% beyond what was expected compared to pre-existing
trends, it is unclear whether taxed food purchases also declined, or whether households of
lower socioeconomic status (SES) were more or less responsive.
Because both the nonessential energy-dense food and the SSB taxes were implemented con-
currently, we cannot evaluate the independent effect of each. Therefore, the objective of the
current work was to longitudinally examine changes in the volume of taxed and untaxed food
purchases after both taxes were implemented, relative to the counterfactual (i.e., expected vol-
ume of taxed and untaxed food purchases if the taxes had not been implemented), overall and
by SES subgroups.
Methods
Participants
This study uses data on volume of household food purchases from January 2012 to December
2014 from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services (CPS). The analysis used
de-identified data and was granted an exemption from the University of Chapel Hill and
National Institute of Public Health (INSP) institutional review boards. Enumerators visit par-
ticipating households every 2 wk to collect diaries of purchases and receipts and register pur-
chases by checking the pantry and a designated bin where the household members keep empty
product packages. All items available with a barcode are scanned by the enumerator. The data
for each purchase includes number of units, volume, price paid, and date of purchase.
Nielsen CPS samples households from 53 cities with >50,000 inhabitants and estimates
weights for each household so that the sample is representative of the urban Mexican
population.
From all households that participated in the Nielsen CPS in at least 2 mo during January
2012–December 2014, we excluded three households because of incomplete data on covariates.
Our analytical sample includes 204,584 household-months, across 6,248 unique households.
Average household follow-up was 32.7 mo; 78% participated in all 36 mo.

 Covariates
SES categories were based on those provided by The Nielsen Company, which are defined with
a score system that classifies households in seven categories as proposed by the Mexican Asso-
ciation of Market Intelligence and Opinion. This measure of SES was validated and is the stan-
dard one used in market research in Mexico. The score considers the education level of the
member with the largest household income contribution and seven household assets: number
of rooms, type of floor, number of bathrooms, shower, gas range, number of light bulbs, and
number of cars. The cutoff points for the seven categories are defined a priori to capture spe-
cific household characteristics and are not based on a population distribution; therefore, the
sample in each category is not equal (e.g., the extreme categories combined have <10% of the
sample). We classified SES as low (lower two categories), medium (middle three categories),
and high (higher two categories). Additional variables include household composition (nine
variables, each with the number of household members that were within each gender/age
group [as presented in S1 Table]) and contextual measures (state-quarter unemployment rates
[12] and minimum salary [13] adjusted by state-quarter consumer price index). See S1 Table
for descriptive statistics on the sample.
Food Categories
In this paper, we focus on volumes of overall taxed and untaxed foods and on subcategories of
each. Classification of foods into untaxed and taxed categories was conducted by a team of reg-
istered dietitians from Mexico. In the case of law ambiguities for food classification, we con-
sulted with the Ministry of Finances for clarification. For further description of each
subcategory and the food classification process, see S2 Table.
Our analysis does not cover all food categories that households purchase; we did not include
categories for which Nielsen CPS does not collect data or did not collect data consistently
throughout the 36 months of the analysis. Examples of food categories not analyzed are choco-
lates, candies, and sweet bread from bakeries (taxed if energy density �275 kcal/100 g, though
small bakeries were exempt from the tax in 2014), and unpackaged produce, tortillas, and
unsweetened bread from bakeries (mainly untaxed).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted in Stata, version 13 (College Station, TX). We first describe unad-
justed, mean per capita volume purchases of taxed and untaxed foods (g/capita/month) from
January 2012 to December 2014. Because the tax was implemented at one point in time across
the entire country and, hence, we did not have a control population, we compared the pur-
chases before and after the tax. Our pre-specified analytical strategy was based on the approach
used by Colchero et al. in evaluating Mexico’s SSB tax [14] and in other research using longitu-
dinal food purchase data to evaluate the effects of retailer- and industry-led initiatives, such as
the United States Healthy Weight Commitment effort to reduce calories in the food supply
[15,16]. Specifically, to account for the ongoing 2012–2013 trend, and to avoid assuming a
decrease in purchases in 2014 was attributable to the tax if there was already a downward
trend, we extrapolated with model predictions the 2012–2013 trend through 2014 and used it
as our counterfactual (i.e., what was expected to happen without a tax in 2014 based on the
2012–2013 trend). We used a fixed effects model to predict the mean adjusted volume pur-
chased in each month pre-tax, post-tax observed, and post-tax counterfactual. More detail
about this pre-specified analytical strategy and deviations from this strategy are summarized in
S1 Protocol.

 The model specification was as follows:
Foodhmy ¼ a þ bTTmy þ bSSmy þ bTSðTmy
�SmyÞ þ byYy þ U � Hhy þ � � Cmy þ lh þ mhmy Equation 1
The unit of analysis (g/capita/month) was the per capita volume of Food purchases in
household h, month m, and year y. T is the post-tax period (0 = 2012–2013; 1 = 2014), S is 2nd
semester (0 = Jan–Jun; 1 = Jul–Dec), Y is year (a continuous measure, 0 = 2012; 1 = 2013;
2 = 2014), H denotes the vector of year-specific household characteristics (SES and household
composition), C denotes the vector of contextual measures (unemployment rates and mini-
mum salary), and λ and μ are the error terms. The year slope reflects the change between 2012
and 2013 (not the change from 2012 through 2014, because the model is adjusting by post-tax
period). Likewise, the post-tax coefficient estimates the change in 2014 beyond what was pre-
dicted in 2014 given the 2012–2013 slope. To assess changes within the year, we included a
semester effect. We tried 2-, 3-, and 4-month periods, but due to high month-to-month varia-
tion and an unclear cyclic annual pattern in 2012’s and 2013’s purchases using shorter periods,
we used a semester period (the second semester was always higher than the first in 2012 and
2013 for both taxed and untaxed foods). Regardless of the period length used in the model, the
annual change remained unchanged. The TS interaction term allowed the semester effect to
vary before and after the tax. Additionally, we controlled for the aforementioned household
and contextual covariates.
Using this model, we predicted the mean adjusted volume purchased in each month pre-tax
(2012–2013), post-tax observed (2014), and post-tax counterfactual (2014 but as if T = 0) to
determine the absolute and relative differences over time. We present the predictions in the
results section and regression coefficients in S3 Table.
Because the food purchase data had a skewed distribution, we tested a generalized linear
model with log-link, which gives unbiased estimates [17]. Results from either a generalized lin-
ear model with log-link or a linear regression model were similar; hence, we used a linear
regression to be able to use a fixed effects estimator. Fixed effects are advantageous because
they control for unobservable time-invariant characteristics. We conducted this analysis sepa-
rately for the taxed and untaxed categories in the entire sample.
We then performed analyses stratified by SES (low, medium, high) using the same specifica-
tion as Eq 1 but without SES as a predictor variable. Stratified models allowed us to compare
not only the tax effect, but also the absolute amount of purchases in each SES category. The
SES coefficients in Eq 1 estimate the difference in the amount of purchases if a household
changes SES category (intra-household), whereas our interest was on the difference in the
amount of purchases across households with different levels of SES (inter-household).
Nearly all households purchased some food from untaxed (99.7% of households) and taxed
(96%) foods each month. However, for subcategories, there was a large proportion of non-con-
sumers. As a result, we used a two-part model [18] using probit and linear regression models
with the same specification as above, except that the fixed effects estimator was not used.
The two-part model was as follows: Total amount of food subcategory purchase (g/capita/
month) = [Probability of food subcategory purchase (probability/month)] � [Amount of food
subcategory if purchased (g/capita/month)]
FoodSubhmy ¼ PrðFoodSubhmy > 0Þ � ½FoodSubhmyjPrðFoodSubhmy > 0Þ�

 In all analyses, we used the household weights provided by Nielsen and estimated standard
errors via bootstrapping by drawing 1,000 random samples with replacement with selection at
the household level.
Results
Fig 1 shows the unadjusted mean volume trends for total taxed and untaxed food purchases
and by subcategory. The 2012–2013 average of total volume of taxed food purchases was 505 g/
capita/month, whereas the 2014 average was 474 g/capita/month, while the averages of total
untaxed foods were 1,585 g/capita/month in 2012–2013 and 1,596 g/capita/month in 2014. As
can be seen, purchases have high month-to-month variation.
Table 1 shows the adjusted absolute and relative differences between the counterfactual and
observed volumes purchased in the post-tax period. On average, the total volume of taxed pur-
chases had an absolute decline of 25 g per capita per month (p < 0.05), or a -5.1% relative
change beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax trends. The decline in volume

 of taxed purchases was 3.4% in the first semester of 2014 but growing to 6.7% in the second
semester.
As can be seen in Fig 2, the effect during the second semester was larger because, based on
previous trends, the purchases were expected to increase in the second semester, but they
remained stable throughout 2014. No differences were detected for untaxed purchases.
Overall, low SES households bought less taxed food before and after the tax compared to
their higher SES counterparts but showed the greatest response to the tax (Table 1, S1 Fig). On
average, in 2014, low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected
(p < 0.05), whereas medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods (p < 0.05), and
high-income households’ purchases did not change. Table 2 (S2 and S3 Figs) shows the

 subcategories of taxed and untaxed food purchases from the two-part model. The total amount
purchased is estimated by multiplying the probability of any purchase during a month by the
amount purchased in months with purchases higher than zero. In Table 2, we present the pre-
dicted probability, amount, and total, whereas in S2 and S3 Figs, we only present the total. The
greatest changes in total purchases were observed among taxed salty snacks (-6.3% beyond
expected, p < 0.05) and taxed cereal-based sweets (-5.2% beyond expected, p < 0.05), while
taxed non-cereal-based sweets and ready-to-eat cereals did not change. Interestingly, in the
case of taxed salty snacks, what drove the overall change was a change in the probability of
purchasing.
Among untaxed foods, there were only significant declines in the volume of sugar and sugar
substitutes purchased compared to what was expected based on the pre-tax trend (-8.9%,
p < 0.05), though the absolute volume of purchases continued to increase. In other words, the
upward trend in the volume of sugar and sugar substitutes observed in 2012–2013 continued

 in 2014, but was smaller than expected (see S3 Fig). Purchases of the food group “other”
increased by 8.0% (p < 0.05).
Discussion
For the first full year after Mexico’s taxes on SSBs and nonessential energy-dense food taxes,
we find significant changes in the observed per capita volume of household purchases of taxed
foods compared to the counterfactual (i.e., what was expected based on pre-tax trends). Over-
all, we find that taxed foods declined by 25 g/capita/month (-5.1%), whereas untaxed food pur-
chases did not change (-0.3%). Moreover, we find much larger declines for lower SES
households (-10.2%), whereas medium SES households changed by 5.8% and high SES house-
holds did not change.
Empirical evidence on the effect of food and nutrient taxes is limited. With regards to Den-
mark’s short-lived saturated fat tax, one study of household food purchases found a 10%–15%
reduction in purchases of butter, blends, margarines, and oils in the first 9 mo of implementa-
tion, when the increase in price of these products was 8%–22% [10]. A recent evaluation using
cruder expenditure data from an income and expenditure national survey of the Hungarian tax
on foods high in salt, sugar, or caffeine found a 3.4% decrease in the volume purchased of pro-
cessed foods after the tax, with no corresponding change in unprocessed foods [11], though
these processed food categories were not necessarily reflective of taxed versus untaxed foods.
The present results show that, at least in Mexico, a relatively modest tax can, in the short run,
result in a substantial decline in volume purchased of taxed foods. However, it is important to
consider that taxes could affect purchases with other mechanisms in addition to the increase of
price. Press coverage or public discussion of the tax can help discourage the consumption of
the taxed products in the population; but, for the nonessential energy-dense tax in Mexico, the
coverage has been small relative to the SSB tax [19,20]. On the other hand, the presence of the
SSB tax could have had an effect on the purchases of nonessential energy dense foods, because
these items might be complementary and consumed together. Previous estimations of SSB own
and cross-price elasticities in Mexico reported that for a 1% increase in the price of SSB, the
purchase of candies and snacks would decrease 0.44% and 0.23%, respectively, and that for a
1% increase in the price of candies and snacks, these would decrease 1.15% and 0.98%, respec-
tively [21]. Therefore, it is likely that the decrease we found in taxed foods is due to both the
SSB and the nonessential energy-dense food taxes.
The reduction of 25 g/capita/month represents 70 to 110 kcal (energy density is at least 275
kcal/100 g, but based on the ENSANUT 2012, the mean energy density for the intake of taxed
foods is 430 kcal/100 g). Although in absolute terms this reduction is small, the purchases cap-
tured in Nielsen only represent a fraction of all household purchases, and real absolute change
in energy intake from taxed food might be larger.
The changes in taxed foods were for salty snacks and cereal-based sweets. Interestingly, for
salty snacks, all the change was due to changes in probability of purchasing, suggesting that, for
this item, people prefer to decrease the frequency of purchases rather than the amount. More-
over, we saw smaller-than-expected increases in the volume of sugar and sugar substitutes, sug-
gesting that households are not necessarily substituting sugary home-prepared foods or
beverages for pre-packaged taxed sweets.
Lower SES households were more responsive to the tax than middle SES households, while
higher SES households showed no statistically significant change in purchases, consistent with
results of the evaluation of Mexico’s SSB tax [22]. This is important, considering that in
Mexico, although lower SES groups still have slightly lower prevalence of obesity and diabetes
[23], the costs associated with obesity and its comorbidities represent a higher proportion of

 their income. In other countries such as the US, where obesity prevalence is highest among
people with low SES, a similar response to such a tax could lead to decreased disparities in diet
and obesity. Long-term effects must be monitored, as we expect the industry to develop strate-
gies in response to the tax, including product reformulation. For example, in the jam and
spreads categories, we found that in 2014, a number of products were reformulated to fall
under the 275 kcal/100 g threshold. The authors of the evaluation of Hungary’s junk food tax
also reported that a sizable proportion (40%) of Hungary’s food manufacturers reported refor-
mulating products to avoid taxation [11].
A great complexity of implementing a food tax is to define the characteristics of the foods
subject to it. If only selected unhealthy foods are taxed, individuals can substitute with other
unhealthy untaxed foods; on the other hand, if the tax categorization is too broad, many rela-
tively healthy products will also be affected, increasing the cost of food without the public
health benefit [24,25]. Overall, this tax successfully targeted unhealthy foods, as it focused on
processed foods and did not disincentive traditional cooking ingredients such as sugar and fats
(a criticism the Danish fat tax has received) [26]. However, the use of a single energy-dense
cut-point in the Mexican tax without other nutritional attributes left out foods that are other-
wise considered unhealthy (e.g., most ice creams were untaxed), whereas foods like peanuts
and nuts were taxed. Moreover, sorting products out into “essential” versus “nonessential” is
an iterative process, and throughout 2014 there were clarifications on the initial law ambigui-
ties, representing about 2.3% of all products (see S2 Table). In contrast, new Chilean controls
on food marketing that will go into effect July 1, 2016, uses as a cutoff not only energy but also
sodium, saturated fat, and total sugar for foods and beverages separately [27]. An additional
complexity of analyzing the Mexican tax is that each producer interprets the law and deter-
mines the total amount they have to pay (without reporting for which products they are pay-
ing). Thus, we cannot be certain which exact products were actually taxed.
This work had several important limitations. First, we were unable to capture and analyze
all foods that households purchased, including unpackaged produce, chocolates, candies, torti-
lla, and bread from bakeries. However, even for foods that were collected consistently in the
Nielsen CPS, we captured only 474 g/capita/month of taxed foods in 2014. This is lower than
what we would expect an average person to purchase, particularly if we compare to Euromoni-
tor retail sales of 1,236 g/capita/month (excluding chocolates and bread from bakeries) or to
the National Institute of Statistics and Geography’s (INEGI’s) manufacturer’s industry survey
of 1245 g/capita/month (excluding chocolate) (S4 and S5 Tables). Similar to other consumer
panel surveys, it is expected that purchases from Nielsen CPS would be lower, because INEGI’s
data is of total sales (including food services and exports), and also because Euromonitor and
INEGI use aggregate food categories that include untaxed items. Still, we are missing some
amount of food purchases, most likely items purchased and consumed away from home. It is
possible that the items not captured in the Nielsen dataset have a different trend than that
found in our results. However, as can be seen in S4 and S5 Tables, INEGI’s and Euromonitor’s
sales also display a decrease of 4.2% to 6.2% compared to 2013 for taxed foods and no change
or slight increase for untaxed foods.
Our model and counterfactual comparisons allowed us to examine what happened post-tax
compared to what would have happened if the pre-tax trends had continued. However, this
comparison assumes that pre-tax trends would have continued, which may not have been the
case, and we cannot rule out that these results may have been influenced by other concomitant
changes unrelated to taxes, including economic trends and anti-obesity and public health cam-
paigns and regulations. [28]. Another limitation is that we only have 2 y of data prior to the
tax. The discussion of the SSB tax and the overall obesity issue has intensified since late 2012
[19]. Capturing the effect of tax discussions on purchases beyond the effect of the tax itself is of

 interest; however, we do not have data before 2012 to use as a comparison and to be able to
assess this. Finally, our sample was only representative of urban Mexican households in cities
with more than 50,000 inhabitants. This sample represents 63% of the Mexican population and
75% of food and beverage expenditures [29], but we do not know if rural households responded
differently to these taxes. Regardless, this study provides the first snapshot of overall trends in
food purchasing a year after the nonessential food tax was passed. Future work will extend this
analysis by examining changes in the nutrient profile of nonessential foods in response to this
tax, including sugar, saturated fat, energy density, and sodium.
Conclusion
This evaluation of Mexico’s nonessential food and SSB taxes shows that the volume of taxed
food purchases declined over what was expected, and that these results were similar in direc-
tion and magnitude to declines in SSBs in response to the SSB tax. Declines after the tax were
statically significant among low and medium SES households and for selected food subcatego-
ries (salty snacks and cereal-based sweets). Our results can orient Mexican policymakers, who
every year decide on the continuation of the tax, as well as policymakers from others countries
currently considering the implementation of foods taxes. However, the impact of this tax on
overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns, as well as how these changes
relate to weight status, remains to be studied.
