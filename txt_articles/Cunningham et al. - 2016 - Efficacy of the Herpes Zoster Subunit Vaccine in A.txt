BACKGROUND
A trial involving adults 50 years of age or older (ZOE-50) showed that the herpes zoster 
subunit vaccine (HZ/su) containing recombinant varicella–zoster virus glycoprotein E and 
the AS01B adjuvant system was associated with a risk of herpes zoster that was 97.2% 
lower than that associated with placebo. A second trial was performed concurrently at 
the same sites and examined the safety and efficacy of HZ/su in adults 70 years of age 
or older (ZOE-70).
METHODS
This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted in 18 countries and 
involved adults 70 years of age or older. Participants received two doses of HZ/su or 
placebo (assigned in a 1:1 ratio) administered intramuscularly 2 months apart. Vaccine 
efficacy against herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia was assessed in participants 
from ZOE-70 and in participants pooled from ZOE-70 and ZOE-50.
RESULTS
In ZOE-70, 13,900 participants who could be evaluated (mean age, 75.6 years) received 
either HZ/su (6950 participants) or placebo (6950 participants). During a mean follow-up 
period of 3.7 years, herpes zoster occurred in 23 HZ/su recipients and in 223 placebo 
recipients (0.9 vs. 9.2 per 1000 person-years). Vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster was 
89.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.2 to 93.7; P<0.001) and was similar in partici-
pants 70 to 79 years of age (90.0%) and participants 80 years of age or older (89.1%). In 
pooled analyses of data from participants 70 years of age or older in ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 
(16,596 participants), vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster was 91.3% (95% CI, 86.8 to 
94.5; P<0.001), and vaccine efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia was 88.8% (95% CI, 
68.7 to 97.1; P<0.001). Solicited reports of injection-site and systemic reactions within 
7 days after injection were more frequent among HZ/su recipients than among placebo 
recipients (79.0% vs. 29.5%). Serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated dis-
eases, and deaths occurred with similar frequencies in the two study groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In our trial, HZ/su was found to reduce the risks of herpes zoster and postherpetic neu-
ralgia among adults 70 years of age or older. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals; 
ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01165177 and NCT01165229.)

H
erpes zoster, or shingles, results 
from the reactivation of latent varicella–
zoster virus (VZV) and typically mani-
fests as a vesicular, painful dermatomal rash.1,2 
The most common complication of herpes zos-
ter, postherpetic neuralgia, manifests as chronic 
neuropathic pain that can greatly limit daily ac-
tivities.1,3-6
The overall incidence of herpes zoster is 2.0 to 
4.6 cases per 1000 person-years but increases 
with age to 10.0 to 12.8 per 1000 person-years 
among persons 80 years of age or older.7-10 Simi-
larly, the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia 
also increases with age.10-13
Antiviral therapy can reduce the duration of 
herpes zoster rash but has not been shown to 
decrease the incidence of postherpetic neural-
gia.14-17 Vaccination is therefore an attractive op-
tion to reduce the disease burden due to herpes 
zoster and its complications in older adults. 
Currently, a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine 
(Zostavax, Merck) is approved for use in adults 
50 years of age or older and is recommended for 
adults 60 years of age or older.2,18,19
An investigational herpes zoster subunit vac-
cine (HZ/su; GSK Vaccines) containing VZV glyco-
protein E and the AS01B adjuvant system is being 
evaluated for the prevention of herpes zoster and 
postherpetic neuralgia in adults 50 years of age 
or older.20-25 A previous trial (Zoster Efficacy Study 
in Adults 50 Years of Age or Older [ZOE-50]) 
showed that HZ/su had a vaccine efficacy against 
herpes zoster of 97.2%, which was consistent 
across all age groups.26 Although 24% of the 
participants in ZOE-50 were 70 years of age or 
older, the trial was not intended to definitively 
assess vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster or 
postherpetic neuralgia in this age group. There-
fore, in parallel with ZOE-50, we conducted a 
second trial involving only adults who were 70 
years of age or older (Zoster Efficacy Study in 
Adults 70 Years of Age or Older [ZOE-70]) to as-
sess vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster in this 
population; we also estimated vaccine efficacy 
against postherpetic neuralgia in the combined 
population (i.e., from ZOE-50 plus ZOE-70) of 
adults 70 years of age or older and adults 50 
years of age or older.
Here, we present the results of ZOE-70. We 
also present the results of the prespecified 
pooled analyses of vaccine efficacy against herpes 
zoster and postherpetic neuralgia among par-
ticipants in ZOE-70 and ZOE-50.
Methods
Study Design
ZOE-70 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 trial conducted in 18 countries in Eu-
rope, North America, Latin America, and Asia–
Australia to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenic-
ity, and safety of HZ/su in adults 70 years of age 
or older. The investigators were unaware of the 
study-group assignments during the trial. This 
trial had the same design as ZOE-50 and was 
conducted concurrently at the same sites.26
The trial protocol, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the 
appropriate independent ethics committee or 
institutional review board at each study center. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants before study entry. ZOE-70 was con-
ducted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. During the study, potential 
research compliance issues were investigated, 
and appropriate actions were taken when needed. 
ZOE-70 was monitored by an independent data 
and safety monitoring committee that met regu-
larly during the course of the study to review all 
safety data in an unblinded manner, as de-
scribed previously for ZOE-50.26
Medical writing was provided by 4Clinics, 
France, with funding support from GlaxoSmith-
Kline Biologicals. All the authors reviewed and 
approved the final submitted version of the 
manuscript. The last author vouches for the com-
pleteness and accuracy of all the data and the 
analyses presented and for the fidelity of the trial 
to the protocol.
Eligibility, Randomization, and Blinding
Adults 70 years of age or older were eligible for 
inclusion in the trial unless they had a history of 
herpes zoster, had previously been vaccinated 
against varicella or herpes zoster, or had an 
immunosuppressive condition (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available at NEJM.org, for a 
complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria). 
Participants who were 70 years of age or older 
were first randomly assigned to either ZOE-5026 
or ZOE-70 and then were randomly assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to either the HZ/su group or the pla-
cebo group with the use of an online centralized 
randomization system. Participants were strati-
fied according to region (Asia and Australia,

Herpes Zoster Vaccine in Adults 70 or Older
Europe, Latin America, and North America) and 
age group (70 to 79 years vs. ≥80 years [in a 3:1 
ratio]). The investigators, participants, and per-
sons responsible for evaluating the study end 
points were unaware of whether HZ/su or pla-
cebo had been administered.
Vaccination
HZ/su contains 50 μg of recombinant VZV glyco-
protein E and the liposome-based AS01B adjuvant 
system (which contains 50 μg of 3-O-desacyl-4′-
monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL] and 50 μg of 
Quillaja saponaria Molina, fraction 21 [QS21, li-
censed by GSK from Antigenics, a subsidiary of 
Agenus]). Vaccine or placebo (0.9% saline solu-
tion) was administered (0.5 ml) into the deltoid 
muscle at month 0 and month 2. Participants 
were to be followed for at least 30 months after 
the second dose through monthly contacts and 
annual clinic visits.
Trial End Points
The primary objective of ZOE-70 was to evaluate 
the efficacy of HZ/su, as compared with placebo, 
in reducing the risk of herpes zoster among 
adults 70 years of age or older. The primary ob-
jectives of the pooled analysis involving partici-
pants from ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 were to evaluate 
the efficacy of the vaccine, as compared with 
placebo, in reducing the risk of herpes zoster 
and the risk of postherpetic neuralgia in the 
overall population of participants 70 years of age 
or older from the two studies. The secondary 
objectives included the evaluation of vaccine ef-
ficacy against postherpetic neuralgia among 
participants 50 years of age or older and the 
evaluation of vaccine safety and reactogenicity. 
(A complete list of objectives is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Evaluation of Safety and Reactogenicity
In ZOE-70, a randomly selected subgroup of age-
stratified participants recorded injection-site reac-
tions (pain, redness, and swelling) and systemic 
reactions (fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symp-
toms, headache, myalgia, and shivering) on diary 
cards for 7 days after each injection. Redness and 
swelling at the injection site were scored as 0 if 
the affected area was less than 20 mm in diame-
ter, 1 if the affected area was 20 to 50 mm, 2 if the 
affected area was more than 50 to 100 mm, and 
3 if the affected area was more than 100 mm. 
Fever was scored as 0 for a body temperature 
lower than 37.5°C, 1 for 37.5°C to 38.0°C, 2 for 
38.1°C to 39.0°C, and 3 for higher than 39.0°C 
(the preferred route for recording temperature 
was oral). All other symptoms were scored as 0 for 
absent, 1 for easily tolerated, 2 for interferes 
with normal activity, and 3 for prevents normal 
activity.
Unsolicited reports of adverse events were 
recorded for 30 days after each dose for all par-
ticipants. All serious adverse events were re-
corded for all participants for 12 months after 
the second dose. Serious adverse events that 
were considered to be related to the study vac-
cine or to trial participation, events resulting in 
death, and potential immune-mediated diseases 
were evaluated in all participants throughout the 
trial.
Suspected Cases of Herpes Zoster
A suspected case of herpes zoster was defined as 
new unilateral rash with pain (broadly defined 
to include allodynia, pruritus, or other abnormal 
sensations) that had no alternative diagnosis. 
Suspected cases of herpes zoster were evaluated 
as described previously.26 Lesion samples were 
obtained from patients with suspected herpes 
zoster for polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analy-
sis. A suspected case was confirmed as herpes 
zoster if the PCR assay was positive for VZV. The 
case was classified as not herpes zoster if the 
PCR assay was VZV-negative and β-actin–posi-
tive (control). If the PCR results were indetermi-
nate (VZV-negative and β-actin–negative) or if 
samples were not available, the final diagnosis 
was determined by unanimous agreement among 
the five members of an ascertainment commit-
tee, the members of which were unaware of the 
study group assignments. If the committee opin-
ion was not unanimous, the case was classified 
as inconclusive and was considered not to be 
herpes zoster for the purposes of the statistical 
analyses.
Assessment of Postherpetic Neuralgia Cases
Participants with a suspected case of herpes 
zoster were asked to attend a schedule of assess-
ment visits and to complete the Zoster Brief Pain 
Inventory27 questionnaire daily for 28 days and 
weekly thereafter, until the participant had been 
pain-free for 4 weeks or for at least 90 days after 
the onset of the rash. The “worst pain” score 
(item 3: “Please rate your pain by circling the 
one number that best describes your pain at its

0 to 10, with higher numbers indicating worse 
pain) was used to determine whether a partici-
pant had postherpetic neuralgia.27 As in previous 
studies, postherpetic neuralgia was defined as a 
worst pain score of 3 or higher for pain that 
persisted or developed more than 90 days after 
the onset of herpes zoster rash.19,28
Statistical Analysis
Safety was analyzed in the total vaccinated co-
hort, which included all participants who could 
be evaluated and who had received at least one 
dose of HZ/su or placebo. Efficacy was ana-
lyzed in the total vaccinated cohort and in the 
modified vaccinated cohort (the primary cohort 
for the efficacy analysis), which excluded par-
ticipants who did not receive the second dose 
or who had a confirmed herpes zoster episode 
within 1 month (30 days) after the second dose. 
All the analyses included participants 70 years 
of age or older, with the exception of the analy-
sis of vaccine efficacy against postherpetic neural-
gia, which included participants 50 years of age 
or older.
Vaccine efficacy was defined as 1 minus the 
ratio of herpes zoster incidence in the HZ/su 
group to that in the placebo group, multiplied 
by 100. All significance tests were two tailed. 
P values of 0.05 or less were considered to indi-
cate statistical significance. All statistical analy-
ses were performed with SAS software, version 
9.3 (SAS Institute), and StatXact software, ver-
sion 9.0 (Cytel).
Results
Study Population
Participants were enrolled in ZOE-70 between 
August 2, 2010, and July 21, 2011. The last study 
visit was on July 24, 2015. A total of 14,816 par-
ticipants were enrolled and underwent random-
ization, of whom 916 were excluded from all 
analyses; 865 of these participants were excluded 
because of deviations from Good Clinical Prac-
tice standards at a study center (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The remaining 13,900 par-
ticipants constituted the total vaccinated cohort, 
13,163 of whom (94.7%) were included in the 
modified vaccinated cohort (Fig. 1). Most par-
ticipants (94.4% of HZ/su recipients and 95.6% 
of placebo recipients) received both doses. In the 
pooled analysis of participants from ZOE-70 and 
ZOE-50, 17,531 participants 70 years of age or 
older were included in the total vaccinated co-
hort, and 16,596 were included in the modified 
vaccinated cohort (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
In ZOE-70, the demographic characteristics of 
the participants at baseline were similar in the 
two groups (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). A total of 54.0% of the participants 
were from Europe, 76.9% were white, and 54.9% 
were female. The mean age of the participants 
at study entry was 75.6 years (range, 62 to 96 
years). Four participants younger than 70 years 
of age were erroneously enrolled in ZOE-70 (3 were 
69 years of age, and 1 was 62 years of age). 
These participants were included in the cohort 
of participants 70 to 79 years of age for all 
analyses. Overall, 3066 participants (22.1%) were 
80 years of age or older, and 76 (0.5%) were 90 
years of age or older. The demographic charac-
teristics of the participants at baseline were also 
similar in the two groups in the pooled popula-
tion of participants 70 years of age or older from 
ZOE-70 and ZOE-50.26
Vaccine Efficacy against Herpes Zoster  
in Adults 70 Years of Age or Older
In the ZOE-70 total vaccinated cohort, 432 sus-
pected episodes of herpes zoster were reported, 
270 of which were confirmed as herpes zoster 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 
270 confirmed cases, 246 occurred in the modi-
fied vaccinated cohort: 23 in HZ/su recipients 
and 223 in placebo recipients, after a mean fol-
low-up period of 3.7 years (Table 1). The incidence 
of herpes zoster per 1000 person-years was 0.9 
in the HZ/su group and 9.2 in the placebo group, 
for an overall vaccine efficacy of 89.8% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 84.2 to 93.7; P<0.001). 
Vaccine efficacy did not differ significantly be-
tween the two age groups (90.0% among par-
ticipants 70 to 79 years of age and 89.1% among 
participants ≥80 years of age). In a time-to-event 
analysis, the cumulative incidence of herpes zos-
ter was lower in the HZ/su group than in the 
placebo group, in both the modified and the 
total vaccinated cohorts (Fig. 2A and 2C).
In the pooled analysis of participants 70 years 
of age or older from ZOE-70 and ZOE-50, a total

Herpes Zoster Vaccine in Adults 70 or Older
of 25 confirmed cases of herpes zoster occurred 
in HZ/su recipients, as compared with 284 cases 
in placebo recipients, which resulted in a vaccine 
efficacy of 91.3% against herpes zoster (95% CI, 
86.8 to 94.5%) (Table 1). Vaccine efficacy did not 
differ significantly between the two age groups 
(91.3% in participants 70 to 79 years of age and 
91.4% in participants ≥80 years of age); the re-
sults were similar in the total vaccinated cohort 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
cumulative incidence of herpes zoster was lower 
in the HZ/su group than in the placebo group 
(Fig. 2B and 2D). Vaccine efficacy was 97.6% 
during year 1, 92.0% during year 2, 84.7% dur-
ing year 3, and 87.9% during year 4 after the 
second vaccination (Table 1).
 
Vaccine Efficacy against Postherpetic 
Neuralgia
In the pooled modified vaccinated cohort that 
included all participants 50 years of age or older, 
postherpetic neuralgia developed in 4 of 32 HZ/su 
recipients and in 46 of 477 placebo recipients with 
herpes zoster, during a mean follow-up period 
Figure 1. Enrollment and Randomization.
After enrollment, one study center was closed because of Good Clinical Practice violations, and one study center 
was closed for financial reasons (see the Supplementary Appendix). All participants who had been enrolled at these 
centers were excluded from all analyses. An additional four participants were excluded because of issues with in-
formed consent. Some participants in the total vaccinated cohort had more than one reason for being excluded 
from the modified vaccinated cohort. HZ/su denotes herpes zoster subunit vaccine.

Herpes Zoster Vaccine in Adults 70 or Older
of 3.8 years. The incidence of postherpetic neu-
ralgia per 1000 person-years was 0.1 in the HZ/su 
group and 0.9 in the placebo group, for a vaccine 
efficacy of 91.2% among adults 50 years of age or 
older (95% CI, 75.9 to 97.7%; P<0.001) (Table 1). 
Postherpetic neuralgia did not develop in any 
HZ/su recipients younger than 70 years of age. 
Among participants 70 years of age or older, 
vaccine efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia 
was 88.8% (95% CI, 68.7 to 97.1%; P<0.001) 
(Table 1, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The cumulative incidence of posther-
petic neuralgia was lower in the HZ/su group 
than in the placebo group, in both the modi-
fied and the total vaccinated cohorts (Fig. 3). 
The incidence of postherpetic neuralgia among 
HZ/su recipients with breakthrough herpes zos-
ter did not differ significantly from that among 
placebo recipients (12.5% and 9.6%, respective-
ly; P 
= 
0.54).
Reactogenicity
In ZOE-70, a total of 1025 participants (7.4%) 
were randomly assigned to the reactogenicity 
subgroup (512 HZ/su recipients and 513 placebo 
recipients). In this subgroup, solicited reports of 
reactions (“solicited reactions”) that occurred 
within 7 days after each vaccination were noted 
in 79.0% of HZ/su recipients and in 29.5% of 
placebo recipients (Table 2).
Injection-site solicited reactions occurred in 
74.1% of HZ/su recipients and in 9.9% of placebo 
recipients; most reactions were mild to moderate 
in intensity. Grade 3 injection-site solicited reac-
tions were reported in 8.5% of HZ/su recipients 
and in 0.2% of placebo recipients. Systemic solic-
ited reactions occurred in 53.0% of HZ/su re-
cipients and in 25.1% of placebo recipients 
(grade 3 reactions were reported in 6.0% and 
2.0%, respectively). In the HZ/su group, the most 
common injection-site reaction was pain (in 68.7% 
of HZ/su recipients) and the most common sys-
temic reaction was fatigue (in 32.9%). The reac-
tions were transient, with median durations of 
2 to 3 days for injection-site reactions, 1 to 2 days 
for systemic reactions, and 1 to 2 days for grade 3 
reactions (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The overall frequency and severity of the solic-
ited reactions did not increase significantly after 
the second dose (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Solicited reactions tended to be less

The modified vaccinated cohort excluded participants who did not receive the second dose of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine (HZ/su) or placebo or who had a confirmed episode of 
herpes zoster within 1 month (30 days) after the second dose.
†  
Vaccine efficacy was calculated by means of the Poisson method. Vaccine efficacy in each age group was adjusted for region, and overall vaccine efficacy was adjusted for age group and 
region. P<0.001 for all comparisons of the efficacy against herpes zoster of the vaccine versus placebo. For the comparison of efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia of the vaccine ver-
sus placebo, P<0.001 in the ≥50-yr, ≥70-yr, and 70–79-yr age groups and P = 0.008 in the 50–59-yr age group; the numbers of cases in the placebo group were not sufficient to obtain a 
significant result in the 60–69-yr (P = 0.51) and ≥80-yr (P = 0.18) age groups.
‡  
Data were censored at the time of the first confirmed diagnosis of herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia.

Year 1 is defined as the period from 30 to 395 days after the second vaccination, year 2 as the period from 396 to 760 days after the second vaccination, year 3 as the period from 761 to 
1125 days after the second vaccination, and year 4 as the period of more than 1125 days after the second vaccination to the last contact date.
¶  
The assessment of vaccine efficacy for the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in participants ≥70 years of age was the primary objective of the pooled analyses.

recipients (Table 2). Serious adverse events that 
were considered by the investigators to be relat-
ed to the trial intervention occurred in 12 HZ/su 
recipients (0.2%) and in 8 placebo recipients 
(0.1%). Overall, 426 participants in the HZ/su 
group (6.1%) and 459 participants in the placebo 
group (6.6%) died. One death was considered 
by the investigators to be related to the trial 
intervention: a 90-year-old participant with pre-
existing thrombocytopenia had acute myeloid 
leukemia diagnosed 75 days after the first dose 
of HZ/su and died from neutropenic sepsis 97 days 
after vaccination, without having received the 
second dose.
Discussion
Herpes zoster and its complications, especially 
postherpetic neuralgia, are associated with sub-
stantial morbidity among older adults. In this 
phase 3 trial, two doses of HZ/su administered 
2 months apart had a vaccine efficacy of 89.8%, 
as compared with placebo, in reducing the risk 
of herpes zoster among adults 70 years of age or 
older. A similar vaccine efficacy in reducing the 
risk of postherpetic neuralgia was shown in the 
pooled analysis.
The results of the current trial, which in-
volved a population of adults 70 years of age or 
older, are consistent with those of a parallel 
study involving adults 50 years of age or older 
(ZOE-50), in which HZ/su was shown to have an 
efficacy of 97.9% for the prevention of herpes 
zoster in a smaller population of adults 70 years 
of age or older.26 Vaccine efficacy for the preven-
tion of herpes zoster in adults 70 years or age or 
older did not differ significantly between these 
two studies.
ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 were conducted in an 
identical manner at the same sites, and partici-
pants 70 years of age or older were randomly 
assigned to one of the two studies. Therefore, 
pooling data from both studies was justified and 
provided a more robust assessment of vaccine 
efficacy against herpes zoster; it also allowed for 
an analysis of vaccine efficacy against posther-
petic neuralgia, an analysis that would not other-
wise have been feasible given the low risk of 
postherpetic neuralgia among the participants 
in each individual study. Vaccine efficacy against 
herpes zoster in the pooled analysis was very 
similar in the two age groups studied (91.3% 
among participants 70 to 79 years of age and 
91.4% among participants ≥80 years of age), 
which indicated that there was no decline in ef-
ficacy with age. This finding is consistent with 
the results of ZOE-50, in which vaccine efficacy 
against herpes zoster was found to be similar in 
all age groups (50 to 59, 60 to 69, and ≥70 years 
of age), but it contrasts with the efficacy of the 
approved live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax), which 
was found to decline with increasing age: 70% 
in adults 50 to 59 years of age, 64% in adults 60 
to 69 years of age, 41% in adults 70 to 79 years 
of age, and 18% in adults 80 years of age or 
older.24,25
In the Shingles Prevention Study, the live at-
tenuated herpes zoster vaccine appeared to pro-
vide additional protection against postherpetic 
neuralgia beyond preventing herpes zoster 
(among adults 60 years of age or older, 51% vac-
cine efficacy against herpes zoster vs. 67% vac-
cine efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia).19 
Protection against postherpetic neuralgia in our 
trials appeared to be driven by the lower inci-
dence of herpes zoster (91.3% vaccine efficacy 
against herpes zoster vs. 88.8% vaccine efficacy 
against postherpetic neuralgia in the pooled 
population of adults ≥70 years of age); there is 
no evidence for additional efficacy against post-
herpetic neuralgia among HZ/su recipients with 
breakthrough herpes zoster. However, although 
the number of postherpetic neuralgia cases in 
HZ/su recipients was limited because of the high 
vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster, which 
precludes a robust assessment of HZ/su vaccine 
efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia among 
persons with breakthrough herpes zoster, our 
results indicate that vaccination with HZ/su sub-
stantially reduces the overall risk of postherpetic 
neuralgia among older adults.
The vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster 
was 87.9% in the fourth year after vaccination. 
Although the point estimate for vaccine efficacy 
against herpes zoster was higher in the first 
year after vaccination than in subsequent years, 
this difference was not significant. Therefore, we 
cannot make conclusions regarding the magni-
tude of a potential decline in efficacy. Addi-
tional follow-up is required to assess the per-
sistence of HZ/su-induced protection over a 
longer period.

Solicited reports of injection-site and systemic 
reactions were more common among HZ/su re-

*  
Reports within 7 days after vaccination in the reactogenicity subgroup (a randomly selected subgroup of age-stratified participants) were 
 
solicited reports of injection-site reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) and systemic reactions (fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, 
headache, myalgia, and shivering).
†  
Redness and swelling at the injection site were scored as 0 if the affected area was less than 20 mm in diameter, 1 if the affected area was 
20 to 50 mm, 2 if the affected area was more than 50 to 100 mm, and 3 if the affected area was more than 100 mm. Fever was scored as 0 for 
a body temperature lower than 37.5°C, 1 for 37.5°C to 38.0°C, 2 for 38.1°C to 39.0°C, and 3 for higher than 39.0°C (the preferred route for re-
cording temperature was oral). All other symptoms were scored as 0 for absent, 1 for easily tolerated, 2 for interferes with normal activity, 
and 3 for prevents normal activity. Serious adverse events were defined as events that resulted in death, were life-threatening, led to hospi-
talization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in disability or incapacity, or caused a congenital anomaly or birth defect in 
the child of a participant.

§  
The serious adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to the trial intervention were lymphadenitis, acute myocardial infarc-
tion, ulcerative colitis, acute pancreatitis, administration-site erythema, administration-site pain, chills, pyrexia, allergic granulomatous angiitis, 
bacterial arthritis, erysipelas, herpes zoster oticus, eczema, neutropenic sepsis, and acute myeloid leukemia in the HZ/su group and poly-
myalgia rheumatica, gastric adenocarcinoma, cerebral infarction, cerebrovascular accident, the Guillain–Barré syndrome, loss of conscious-
ness, syncope, and glomerulonephritis in the placebo group. Some participants had more than one event.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Despite the higher reactogenicity observed with 
HZ/su, adherence to receiving the second dose 
was similar to that with placebo (approximately 
95%). The frequency of solicited reports of injec-
tion-site and systemic reactions decreased slightly 
with age.
No safety concerns associated with HZ/su 
were identified in the current trial. The overall 
incidences of potential immune-mediated dis-
eases, serious adverse events, and deaths were 
similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. One 
death in the HZ/su group was considered by the 
local investigator to be related to the vaccina-
tion; however, serious adverse events considered 
by the investigators to be related to vaccination 
were similar in frequency between the two study 
groups. In addition, reported serious adverse 
events were consistent with general expectations 
for this older population.29 These results are 
consistent with those of ZOE-50, in which no 
safety concerns related to vaccination with HZ/su 
were identified.26 Furthermore, participants from 
the placebo groups in ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 are 
currently being offered vaccination with HZ/su 
under a separate protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov num-
ber, NCT02690207). This open-label, single-group 
study will allow us to collect additional safety data.
As we found in adults 50 years of age or 
older,26 the efficacy of HZ/su indicates that im-
mune responses directed against a single VZV 
antigen (glycoprotein E) are capable of protect-
ing against herpes zoster in adults 70 years of age 
or older. Although the immunologic basis for 
protection against herpes zoster is not known, 
VZV-specific CD4+ T cells are believed to play a 
central role.30,31 Accordingly, HZ/su induces strong 
glycoprotein E–specific immune responses, in-
cluding CD4+ T-cell responses, that are pre-
served with age.20,24 Moreover, the robustness of 
the immune responses to glycoprotein E are at-
tributable to the action of the AS01B adjuvant 
system, which has also been shown to enhance 
CD4+ T-cell and humoral immune responses to 
subunit antigens from other pathogens.32,33 To-
gether, these results suggest that such adjuvants 
have the potential to improve the efficacy of 
vaccines that are intended for use in older adults 
and other populations that may otherwise have 
a lower response to vaccination.
In conclusion, in ZOE-70 we found that the 
adjuvanted subunit HZ/su vaccine reduced the 
risk of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia 
among adults 70 years of age or older, without 
substantial safety concerns.
