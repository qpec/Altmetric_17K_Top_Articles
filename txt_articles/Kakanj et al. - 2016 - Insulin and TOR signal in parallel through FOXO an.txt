The TOR and Insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network controls growth, metabolism and ageing.
Although reducing TOR or insulin signalling can be beneficial for ageing, it can be detrimental
for wound healing, but the reasons for this difference are unknown. Here we show that IIS is
activated in the cells surrounding an epidermal wound in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,
resulting in PI3K activation and redistribution of the transcription factor FOXO. Insulin and
TOR signalling are independently necessary for normal wound healing, with FOXO and S6K as
their respective effectors. IIS is specifically required in cells surrounding the wound, and the
effect is independent of glycogen metabolism. Insulin signalling is needed for the efficient
assembly of an actomyosin cable around the wound, and constitutively active myosin II
regulatory light chain suppresses the effects of reduced IIS. These findings may have impli-
cations for the role of insulin signalling and FOXO activation in diabetic wound healing.

 T
he conserved IIS and TOR signalling network has a central
role in metabolic homoeostasis, growth control, stress
responses and ageing1. Decreased activity of the network
can extend lifespan, improve many aspects of health and delay or
prevent ageing-related diseases in laboratory animals2. However,
reduced network activity can also impair specific aspects of
health, notably wound healing3,4. This may be one reason why
impaired wound healing is a common complication of diabetes5.
Identification of the mechanisms mediating both the health
benefits and impairments from reduced IIS and TOR activity is
important in order to understand if they can be triaged apart.
The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying impaired
wound healing in diabetes are incompletely understood. Vascular
defects have a major role6, but insulin resistance in other cell
types may also contribute and could be a potential therapeutic
target. The fruit fly Drosophila is an excellent model organism in
which to study the cell biology and physiology of epidermal
wound healing. The fly has also been used to develop multiple
genetic models of extended lifespan from reduced IIS/TOR
activity,
and
of
insulin
resistance1.
In
several
of
these
experimental situations, gene expression can be controlled both
temporally and in a cell-type-specific manner.
The Drosophila epidermis is a monolayered epithelium with a
basal lamina, resembling simple squamous epithelia in mammals.
Altogether with the apically secreted cuticle it provides a robust
external barrier (Supplementary Fig. 1A)7. The two major
conserved mechanisms contribute to epithelial wound repair in
the Drosophila embryo and pupa are formation of an actomyosin
cable that constricts the wound, and protrusion of lamellipodia by
cells surrounding the wound, associated with cell crawling
towards it, eventually leading to wound closure8–11. In larvae,
wound closure is driven primarily by actin protrusion rather than
by actomyosin cable contraction, but a polarized actin assembly is
observed at the wound edge12–15. The movement of cells
surrounding the wound is coupled to phagocytosis of debris
and
formation
of
syncytia
centred
at
the
wound12,16,17.
Haemocytes are also recruited to the wounded area, and these
stop
the
escape
of
haemolymph
and
the
entry
of
microorganisms12,18.
The larval epidermis is post-mitotic. Epidermal morphogenesis
occurs only during embryonic stages, and the larval epidermis
hence provides a powerful in vivo model to study the cell biology
of wound healing. Larvae have not been widely used in this
context, partly because they cannot easily be immobilized for long
periods. We have overcome this problem and established a laser
ablation method for inducing epithelial wounds in third instar
larvae. We employed live imaging to analyse the role of the
IIS/TOR network, and found that inhibition of TORC1 impairs
wound healing in an S6 kinase-dependent manner, and that there
is an epidermal-specific and cell-autonomous requirement for
insulin signalling through FOXO for efficient actomyosin cable
formation and wound healing.
Results
Epidermal wound healing in Drosophila larvae. A laser beam
was used to ablate one or a few cells in the epidermis of anaes-
thetized, early third instar (L3) Drosophila larvae, which were
imaged for up to 7 h after wounding (see Methods). We initially
investigated wounds encompassing 3–6 epidermal cells (B3,000–
8,500 mm2). Immediately after injury, the wound area expanded
for
6±1 min
(Supplementary
Fig.
1
and
Supplementary
Fig. 2A,B, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Movie 1A).
The sides of the cells facing the wound showed a strong enrich-
ment of Src-GFP at the plasma membrane and formed a ring
around the wound, which shrank over time. Accumulation of
Src-GFP occurred near the apical side of the cell edges at the
border of the wound while, at the basal side, lamellipodia
emanated and filled in the wound. Wound closure was completed
within 250±20 min, irrespective of Gal4 drivers and markers used
(Supplementary Fig. 1C–F and Supplementary Fig. 2A–D).
To investigate a possible role of a contractile actomyosin ring
in the initial shrinking of the wound, we expressed DE-Cadherin-
GFP to mark adherens junctions, and mCherry fused to spaghetti
squash (Sqh), the Drosophila non-muscle myosin II regulatory
light chain (MyoII), both under their endogenous promoters19,20.
We saw that MyoII was rapidly reorganized in the cells
surrounding
the
wound
(Supplementary
Fig.
1G
and
Supplementary Movie 1B,C), and relocated from the cytoplasm
to the side of the cells facing the wound. There it co-localised with
DE-Cadherin, which itself was then gradually lost from this
location but remained unaltered at the cell sides facing non-
wounded neighbours. Accumulation of MyoII occurred at the end
of the expansion phase; a complete actomyosin cable had formed
by 10–12 min and was maintained until wound healing was
completed.
We next examined single-cell wounds, to explore the potential
for investigating cell-autonomous effects. As in multicellular
wounds, we observed an initial expansion of the wound,
formation
of
an
actomyosin
cable
and
growth
of
basal
lamellipodia into the wound (Fig. 1a–e, Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Movie 2). The rate of actomyosin cable
formation was independent of wound size and number of ablated
cells, but single-cell wounds healed faster (Supplementary
Fig. 2E–H). Both in single- and multi-cell wounds, the actin
cable was established by the cells surrounding the wound, with
simultaneous depletion of cytoplasmic MyoII and LifeAct-Ruby
in these cells (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 1G and Supplementary
Fig. 3A–D). Extrusion of cells by a contractile actin cable also
occurs after apoptosis. However, we did not see apoptotic
markers21 (Supplementary Fig. 3E), the ablated cells were
immediately destroyed, and their debris was engulfed by
neighbouring
cells
(see
below).
As
in
other
systems8,22,
wounding was immediately followed by a pulse of Calcium
signalling (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Movie 3).
Survival rates were higher after single-cell ablation (Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. 4), and we
therefore conducted our further investigations on single-cell
wounds, which also allowed us to investigate cell autonomous
effects of IIS/TOR signalling in the cells surrounding the wound.
IIS during wound healing. We first tested whether changes in
IIS/TOR network activity occurred in cells around epidermal
wounds. As a readout for PI3K activity, which is elevated on
insulin signalling23, we used the PIP3-sensor tGPH23. This
marker was initially present throughout the cell, with an
enrichment at the plasma membrane. On wounding, tGPH
accumulated at the plasma membrane facing the wound area
within 7±1 min (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 4), as
previously reported in embryos24. The signal increased as
lamellipodia grew into the wound area, decreased as the wound
closed and then declined to undetectable levels 20–30 min after
wound closure. IIS also results in translocation of FOXO from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm. We used an mCherry knock-in in the
endogenous dfoxo locus to visualize FOXO. Development and
wound healing in foxo-mCherry larvae was normal. Before

and
the
transcriptional activity of FOXO thereby repressed.
IIS/TOR signalling represses autophagy. We measured the
responses of the commonly used autophagosome markers GFP-
Atg8a and eGFP-huLC3 (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5A–D and
Supplementary Movie 6). Both markers showed a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution in control larvae, and both changed
their distribution in the cells surrounding the wound. Unlike the
other responses we studied, they showed changes only towards
the end of the healing process, following the relocation of FOXO
to the nucleus. Punctate accumulations, presumably representing
autophagosomes, began to appear after B80 min, possibly
associated with the digestion of ingested material. When we
marked cells in different colours using the Brainbow system25, we
observed the debris of the dead cell being ingested by the
epithelial cells
that surrounded
the wound
(Fig.
3b and
Supplementary Movie 7), as has also been observed in mice26.
Autophagosomes appeared in cells up to four cell diameters
away from the wound. Cells imaged simultaneously in a
neighbouring segment (B18–20 cells distant from the wound
area) did not show this response (Supplementary Fig 5C–F),
indicating that it was not caused by general stress resulting from
the experimental manipulations.
In conclusion, events typical for IIS occurred in the cells
adjacent to the wound during healing. We therefore tested
whether the IIS/TOR network was required for normal wound
healing.
Ubiquitous reduction of IIS and TORC1 signalling. We first
reduced insulin signalling ubiquitously. Deletion of three insulin
ligands (dilp2-3,5 � / � ), as well as the expression of a dominant
negative version of the insulin receptor (InRDN) under the control
of the ubiquitously expressed da-Gal4 driver delayed wound
healing (Supplementary Fig. 6A-D). IIS is connected through
multiple feed-forward and feed-back routes to TOR signalling.
We used rapamycin to test whether TORC1 mediated wound
healing and found that treatment with 1 or 20 mM rapamycin led
to delayed wound healing (Supplementary Fig. 6E–G). Thus the
normal wound healing response requires both IIS and TORC1
signalling.
Effect of IIS and TORC1 on wound healing. We next deter-
mined whether the observed delays in wound healing were
attributable to a systemic requirement for IIS, or whether normal
IIS was required within the epidermal cells themselves. Expres-
sing InRDN specifically in the epidermis resulted in a similar delay
in wound closure, as seen after ubiquitous down-regulation of
insulin signalling both for single-cell and multi-cell wounds
(Fig. 4a-c, and see below). Therefore, insulin signalling is required
specifically in epidermal cells for efficient wound closure.
We also investigated the roles of TORC1 and TORC2
signalling in the epidermal cells using a dominant-negative
version of TOR or RNA interference against Raptor and Rictor
with RNAi lines whose efficacy has been extensively validated in
other systems27,28. Epidermal expression of a dominant negative
version of TOR or RNA interference against Raptor led to larval
or pupal lethality. Surviving larvae were smaller than controls and
their
epidermal
cells
showed
abnormal
cell
shape
and
morphology,
making
it
impossible
to
conduct
wounding
experiments under conditions comparable to controls or to
rapamycin-treated larvae. This situation was not improved when
the onset of expression of the transgenes was delayed by using
Gal80ts. In contrast, epidermal reduction of TORC2 signalling
had no effect on wound healing (Supplementary Fig. 7A),
suggesting that TORC2 plays no role, and the effect of TOR on
wound healing is therefore indeed mediated by TORC1.
To understand how the insulin receptor and TORC1 mediate
wound healing, we identified their downstream molecular
effectors. To test whether the loss of nuclear FOXO in the cells
adjacent to wounds was required for normal wound healing, we
manipulated the levels of FOXO either globally or in epidermal
cells. Loss of FOXO (foxoD94, A584foxoRNAior e22c4foxoRNAi)
had no effect on either single-cell or multi-cell wound healing
(Fig. 5a–c, Supplementary Fig. 8A–B, Supplementary Fig. 9A–B
and Supplementary Fig. 10A–B). Larvae expressing elevated levels
of FOXO in the epidermis showed no morphological defects and
the over-expressed FOXO reacted to wounding in the same
manner as the endogenous FOXO, although nuclear levels at late
stages even exceeded those seen before wounding (Fig. 6a–c and
Supplementary Movie 8A-B). However, wound closure was
significantly
delayed
in
these
larvae
(Fig.
5a–c
and
Supplementary Fig. 9A–B and Supplementary Fig. 10A–B)
showing that elevated levels of FOXO interfered with wound
healing.
To distinguish between the effects of raised levels of FOXO in
the nucleus or in the cytoplasm we expressed a mutant version of
FOXO that is insensitive to insulin signalling (FOXO-TM)29, and
is therefore constitutively present in the nucleus. Overexpression
of FOXO-TM in the epidermis at 25 �C leads to larval lethality.
However,
at
18 �C
some
larvae
survived
and
wounding
experiments showed significant delays in healing, with 67% of
the wounds not closing at all (Supplementary Fig. 11A–B). This
indicates that FOXO in the nucleus delayed wound healing.
We investigated whether FOXO mediates the delayed wound
healing observed in IIS mutant larvae by reducing FOXO levels in
larvae expressing InRDN in the epidermis. Reduction of FOXO by
half (foxoD94/ þ), as well as complete loss of FOXO (foxoD94/D94)
and foxo epidermal knockdown (foxoRNAi) all suppressed the
defects
in
wound
healing
caused
by
InRDN
(Fig.
5a–c,
Supplementary
Fig.
8A–B,
Supplementary
Fig.
9A–B,
Supplementary Fig. 10A–B and Supplementary Movie 9). In
conclusion, suppression of FOXO activity in the nucleus of the
epidermal cells is required for proper wound closure, and this
suppression is lost upon over-expression of FOXO or reduced IIS.
We showed that TORC1 is required for normal wound healing.
TORC1 activates the S6 kinase (S6K) and inhibits the transla-
tional inhibitor 4E-BP. To test the roles of these molecules, we

 used S6K and 4E-BP loss- and gain-of-function mutants. Neither
loss (4E-BPnull/null)30 nor constitutive activity of 4E-BP (using 4E-
BPCA, a construct that extends life span)31 affected wound
healing, but reduction of S6K activity in the epidermis slowed the
healing process (Supplementary Fig. 12A-D and Fig. 7b). Thus
the effect of TORC1 activity on wound healing is epidermis-
specific, and is at least partly mediated by S6K.
If TORC1 acts mainly through activating S6K, then a
constitutively active form of S6K should reduce the deleterious
effects of loss of TOR signalling on wound healing. We expressed
a constitutively active S6K in the epidermis of rapamycin-treated
larvae (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Movie 10), and this had no
effect in control larvae, but completely suppressed the rapamycin-
induced

 downstream of TORC1 is sufficient to enable efficient wound
healing.
In contrast, S6KCA did not suppress the delay in wound
healing caused by InRDN (Fig. 5a–c), suggesting that activation of
FOXO is the main effector in this part of the signalling network.
In summary, the nutrient-sensing signalling network affects
wound healing through two separate and parallel signalling
branches, one acting through TORC1 and S6K, and the other
through FOXO.
Epidermal glycogen homoeostasis. Glycogen in the larval fat
body and muscles is tightly regulated by insulin/PI3K/AKT32,33,
and glycogen is also present in embryonic epithelial cells34. We

nuclei. The intense punctate pattern is seen with all mCherry constructs we have used in this study (see also Fig. 1e, for example). (c) Time-course of

 observed highly branched glycogen in epidermal cells of control
third instar larvae, and glycogen was substantially reduced in the
epidermis, but not the fat body or muscles, of larvae expressing
InRDN in the epidermis (Supplementary Fig. 13A–F). Impaired
glycogen metabolism could thus be one reason for the slow
wound healing in larvae with lowered IIS. However, glycogen
levels were normal in larvae expressing elevated levels of FOXO
in the epidermis, and loss of FOXO did not restore the glycogen
level in the epidermis of InRDN larvae (Supplementary Fig. 13E–G).
Since
elevated
FOXO
signalling
interferes
with
wound
healing, but not with glycogen storage, the impaired wound
healing in FOXO-over-expressing larvae cannot be explained by
defects in glycogen metabolism, at least under normal nutritional
conditions. Raised levels of FOXO therefore probably affect
wound healing independent of glycogen levels. Similarly, removal
of FOXO (foxoD94) restores both single and multi-cell wound
healing but not glycogen levels in larvae expressing InRDN
(Supplementary
Fig.
13G,
Supplementary
Fig.
8A–B,
Supplementary Fig. 9A–B, Supplementary Fig. 10A–B and
Fig. 5a–c). Thus, wound healing can occur at a normal rate in
the absence of normal levels of glycogen.
Cell autonomy of insulin/FOXO signalling. Insulin signalling
regulates epidermal wound healing in a tissue-autonomous manner,
and the signal could be needed in the cells that are damaged or in
the surrounding cells that repair the wound. We created mosaics of
cells expressing InRDN or foxo in the epidermis.
When we ablated normal cells (that is, ones that did not over-
express InRDN or FOXO) that were surrounded by three or more
cells expressing InRDN or FOXO (marked by GFP expression),
wound closure was delayed to a similar extent as in cases where all
surrounding epithelial cells expressed InRDN or FOXO (Fig. 8a–e).
Thus insulin/FOXO signalling is required in the surrounding cells. If
only one or two of the surrounding cells expressed InRDN or FOXO,
then the rate of wound closure was normal (Fig. 8d–e). Thus, if the
majority of the surrounding cells were normal, they could close the
wound and compensate for the failure of a small number of cells that
are unable to participate normally.
Effect of IIS and FOXO on PIP3 and actomyosin assembly.
IS increases production of PIP3 in the plasma membrane,
which then serves as a docking site for signalling molecules.
Accumulation of the PIP3-reporter tGPH was both delayed and
significantly weakened in larvae expressing InRDN (Fig. 9a,b) but
normal in larvae expressing raised levels of FOXO (Fig. 9a,b).
Because PIP3 can recruit adaptors and activators of actin, we
analysed the effect of IIS on the assembly and contraction of the
actomyosin cable. We found that expression of InRDN and FOXO
in the epidermis affected the actomyosin cable in the same
manner. The cable formed later, was less pronounced and
contracted more slowly (Fig. 9c–e and Supplementary Movie 11A).

between
PIP3
levels
(reduced in A584InRDN but not in A584foxo) and assembly
of the actomyosin cable (reduced in both cases), suggesting that
the actomyosin cable does not strictly depend on high levels of
PIP3 in the membrane. Therefore, IIS is unlikely to control the
actomyosin cable through an effect of PIP3 on actin. Instead,
InRDN
and
overexpression
of
FOXO
both
interfere
with
actomyosin cable formation, stability and rate of contraction by
raising levels of FOXO in the nucleus.
In summary, reduction of insulin receptor signalling and over-
expression of FOXO both inhibited epidermal wound healing, in

 both cases because of elevated levels of FOXO in the nuclei of the
epidermal cells. Failure of accumulation of PIP3 is a consequence
of disrupted insulin signalling (either chronic or acute), but
normal levels of PIP3 do not result in normal actomyosin cable
formation if nuclear levels of FOXO are elevated. Lowered insulin
signalling thus results in impaired wound healing because it leads
to nuclear accumulation of FOXO, rather than affecting cable
assembly through other routes.
Another important conclusion follows from these observations.
In our experimental system the genes we over-expressed or
knocked down were raised or lowered in expression throughout
larval life. We were therefore unable to distinguish whether the
effects on the duration of wound healing in the third larval instar
were due to sustained disruption of IIS during the preceding
larval instars, or whether they are due to a requirement of the
gene products at the time of wounding. However, some more
specific conclusions about timing can be drawn. FOXO-shuttling
occurred immediately after wounding, and presumably required
insulin signalling at that time point. By contrast, the formation of
the actomyosin cable was affected by the elevation of FOXO in
the nucleus, the transcriptional consequences of which cannot
have a direct effect within minutes. FOXO therefore must instead
act through affecting the physiology of the cells during larval
development prior to wounding. We cannot distinguish whether
the effect of IIS on PIP3 accumulation is also due to prior effects,
or to an acute need at the time of wounding. Thus sustained
impairment of IIS activity in larval life presumably compromised
the cells’ ability to elaborate a proper actomyosin cable.
Surprisingly, loss of FOXO (foxoD94/D94; Sqh-mCherry) also
affected cable formation. While it did not affect the timing of

 cable assembly or the rate of contraction, the cable was
significantly thicker (Fig. 9f–g and Supplementary Movie 11B),
consistent with an inhibitory effect of FOXO on cable formation.
We tested whether reduced insulin signalling affected wound
healing through this effect of FOXO on the actomyosin cable. We
found that in IIS deficient larvae lacking FOXO (A584InRDN;
foxoD94/ þ), the assembly and contraction of actomyosin cable
was re-established to its normal rate (Fig. 9c–e), suggesting that
IIS does affect wound healing through its effect on the
actomyosin cable.
To address the mechanism by which FOXO affect actomyosin
cable formation, we tested whether the compromised cable in
larvae over-expressing InRDN or FOXO could be repaired by
supplying a constitutively active form of the myosin II regulatory
light chain (SqhE20E21) (refs 35,36). In control larvae carrying
SqhE20E21, the actomyosin cable was formed at the normal time
and it contracted at the normal rate, but it was thicker, and failed
to disassemble when the wound approached closure. Introducing
SqhE20E21 into larvae expressing InRDN or raised levels of FOXO
in the epidermis (Fig. 10a–c) resulted in a cable that formed and
contracted at the normal rate during the initial phase of closure,
although again it was increased in thickness and blocked proper
closure at late stages, confirming the notion that the primary
effect of FOXO on wound healing is through the actomyosin
cable.
These results show that a crucial role of the proper level of IIS
in the larval epidermis is to inactivate FOXO to enable the cells to
assemble a strong and functional actomyosin cable for efficient
wound closure.
Discussion
The capacity of the body to regenerate and repair tissues is
compromised in some pathophysiological conditions, especially
Type 2 diabetes37. Wound healing is also impaired by the TORC1
inhibitor rapamycin, which is licensed as a drug to prevent
rejection of tissue transplants38,39. Consistent with these clinical
findings, wound healing in mice depends on insulin and TOR

 signalling40–42.
However,
the
roles
of
systemic
and
cell
autonomous signalling mechanisms are unclear, as are the exact
processes of wound healing that are affected.
Drosophila is the organism that is best understood for
mechanisms and pathways that direct tissue assembly, morpho-
genesis and cell polarity. Wounding larvae using laser ablation
followed by long-term live imaging allowed us to characterize the
activity of IIS with a high spatiotemporal resolution at the
subcellular level. The large, transparent epidermal cells of
Drosophila larvae, and the absence of interfering maternal
components that may hamper genetic analysis of ubiquitously
needed proteins in the embryo, make them an attractive model.
Drosophila larvae can be treated with inhibitors and drugs (for
example,
rapamycin)
with
similar
effects
as
observed
in
mammals43. Because many signalling pathways are conserved
between Drosophila and mammals and many labs use Drosophila
larvae to accelerate drug discovery for treatment in cancer or
diabetes and other chronic diseases, this model may be useful for
such purposes in the future44–46. Similarly, Drosophila larvae may
be used to test the effects of dominant mutations of human genes
to understand their mechanism and function, as recently
described, for example, for the human keratin networks and
their role in epidermolysis bullosa simplex47.
Immediately after wounding we observed a local enhancement of
IIS in the cells surrounding the wound and clonal analysis showed
that IIS signalling during wound healing was autonomous to the
epidermal cells themselves, and specifically to the small group of
cells immediately around the wound. This is important, because it
implies that very local insulin resistance, not only vascular
complications peculiar to mammals, may contribute to impaired
wound healing in type 2 diabetes, and that therefore local
enhancement of IIS signalling at the wound itself could be beneficial.
A delay in epidermal wound healing after rapamycin treatment
has also been observed in mammals3,38. In mice, the level of S6
phosphorylation
(pS6)
was
increased
in
the
epidermal
compartment
of
wound
edges,
and
rapamycin
treatment
reduced
pS6
level
and
delayed
the
healing
process3,42.
Epidermal deletion of the TOR inhibitor TCS1 accelerated
wound
closure,
with
increased
pS6
in
the
epidermis,
in
particular in the migrating epithelial tongue of the wound3,42.
In Drosophila larvae, activation of S6K is sufficient to suppress
the wound healing delay caused by rapamycin. Thus, the function
of S6K in wound healing is conserved from insects to mammals.
This conserved function makes S6K an interesting target for
regenerative and drug studies in Drosophila to identify its cellular
targets in wound healing.

 Activation of S6K did not suppress the wound healing delay
caused by reducing insulin receptor signalling, suggesting that
other branches of insulin signalling in parallel to TOR are needed
for efficient wound healing. This fits with the finding that
reduction of FOXO levels, whether ubiquitously or only in the
epidermis, completely rescues the wound healing delay caused by
lowered insulin receptor signalling. Thus, at least two pathways
within the nutrient-sensing network are involved in wound
healing, one acting downstream of TORC1 through S6K and
independent of FOXO levels, the other downstream of the insulin
receptor through FOXO. The effects of modulating FOXO levels
in mice are less clear. Loss of epidermal FOXO1 has been
reported to lead either to impaired wound closure48 or to improve
wound healing4,49. Our own results clearly show the need for low
nuclear
FOXO
levels
for
efficient
wound
healing
in
the
Drosophila epidermis. Microarray experiments on wounded
versus
non-wounded
human
epidermis
revealed
an
over-
representation of FOXO binding sites in differentially expressed
genes50,51. The genes repressed by FOXO included those
encoding the matrix metalloproteases MMP-1 and MMP-9,
which is interesting in light of the fact that Drosophila MMP-1
and MMP-2 are required for proper wound healing in larvae52.
Cutaneous wound healing is difficult to study at the subcellular
level in humans due to the interplay of several cell types and
growth factors. The potential common FOXO targets between
Drosophila and humans again highlight the usefulness of
Drosophila as a model for further studies on the mechanism of
IIS/FOXO regulation during wound healing.

 High levels of glycogen are present in the epidermis of larvae,
and in the mammalian epidermis53,54. The reduced glycogen level
under lowered insulin receptor signalling was not normalized
after FOXO deletion, while the rate of wound healing returned to
normal.
Thus,
in
Drosophila
larvae
under
rich
nutrient
conditions, wound healing does not depend on high levels of
glycogen, and the effects of reducing IIS can therefore not be
explained by loss of glycogen. Glycogen increases during wound
healing in the mammalian epidermis55 but its function for wound
healing and epidermal homoeostasis is not clear. It will be
interesting to find out how glycogen synthesis is regulated in the
epidermis and in response to wound healing and if there is a
feedback loop or cross talk between glucose metabolism, glycogen
synthesis and autophagy.
Our genetic manipulations affected IIS over an extended period
of 424 h before we assayed their effects on wound healing. The
effects could therefore be due to a requirement for IIS at the time
of wounding, shortly afterwards, or in the period before
wounding. We can distinguish distinct phases in wound healing,
and these may be affected differently. The immediate increase in
PIP3 at the wound edges and the appearance of an actomyosin
cable coincided with the cessation of wound opening during the
early response; this was then followed by constriction of the
wound concomitant with the production of lamellipodia; finally,
in the late phase of wound healing, autophagosomes appeared. IIS
appeared to have a role immediately after wounding, as shown by
the initial release of FOXO from epidermal nuclei. While IIS is
needed for the accumulation of PIP3, we cannot distinguish

 whether this is due to acute InR signalling at the time of
wounding, or an earlier requirement, with the direct signal for
PIP3 accumulation being provided by a different mechanism—for
instance via Ca þ þ signalling, activation of Src kinase, or other
pathways. The appearance of autophagosomes in the late phase of
wound closure may be a consequence of FOXO re-entering nuclei
after the initial response to wounding, but it could also be
stimulated by other mechanisms, such as inflammatory signalling
or production of ROS.
However, overexpressing FOXO-TM also affects some of the
immediate responses to wounding. FOXO-TM must act via
transcriptional regulation, as it is constitutively confined to the
nucleus. Since the time between wounding and actomyosin
cable formation is too short to be regulated through a
transcriptional mechanism, this means that increased levels of
FOXO act at an earlier phase to compromise the ability of the
epidermal cells to generate a strong and properly assembled
actomyosin cable.
Previous studies on wound healing after mechanical injury of
the larval epidermis did not describe the immediate formation
of an actomyosin cable. Instead, a discontinuous assembly of
actin was seen in the leading edges of cells surrounding the
wound, and only several hours after injury13–15. On the basis of
this delayed appearance of the cable, Brock et al. suggested
that
actin-based
contraction
is
not
a
major
contributor
to larval wound closure. This is a clear contrast to wound
healing in the embryo where actomyosin cables are formed8,10,
and now also to the data we report here. Unlike the visualization
of the actomyosin cable by live imaging used here, the other
studies analysed fixed material stained with phalloidin or other
probes for actin. It is possible that the early actomyosin cable is
sensitive to fixation.
Elevated nuclear FOXO reduced the rate of actomyosin
assembly, contraction and maintenance and decelerated wound
closure, suggesting that this may be due to transcriptional
regulation of actin modulators. A transcriptome analysis in adult
flies identified FOXO target genes that encode components of cell
adhesion and cell polarity complexes and the Rho-GTPase
signalling system (for example, p120, a-Cat, Baz/Par3, Shg/E-
cadherin, Numb, Crb, Tub, Rho-GAP-1A, Rho-GAP-54D, Rho-
GAP-93B, RhoL, Rac2)56. Some of these genes are involved in
wound healing in Drosophila or mammals9,24,57.
The finding that insulin and TOR signalling have independent
roles in wound healing is important. First, the finding implies that
the mechanisms of impaired wound healing seen with rapamycin
treatment and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes may be
different. Second, it will be important to identify the effector
molecular processes at work downstream of both. Finally, lowered
insulin signalling in wounded tissues themselves, as opposed to
impaired vascular supply, may have an important role in the
impaired wound healing in type 2 diabetes, and may imply that
local up-regulation of insulin signalling or inhibition of FOXO is
sufficient to effect an improvement.
Methods
Fly stocks. Fly stocks were maintained at 25�C under a 12:12h light/dark cycle at
constant 65% humidity. All stocks were in a white-eyed genetic background. For ectopic
expression, the Gal4/UAS system was used58. We used the e22c-GaL4 and A58-Gal4
driver lines to express UAS-constructs in the epidermis12,59. In all experiments
e22c-Gal4, UAS-Src-GFP, UAS-DsRed2-Nuc/CyO or A58-Gal4, UAS-mcD8-GFP/TM6B
or A58-Gal4, UAS-Src-GFP, UAS-DsRed2-Nuc/TM6B12 or da-Gal460 females were
crossed with males of the desired genotype. Both lines without balancers were used as
control. The UAS-transgenes were: UAS-InRDN (InRK1409A: BL 8251; 8252 and 8253),
UAS-foxoRNAi (VDRC v 107786), UAS-S6KRNAi(BL 41895), UAS-S6KCA
(S6KSTDETE: BL 6914), UAS-GFP-mCherry-Atg8a (BL 37749), UAS-mCD8-GFP
(BL 5137), UAS-GCaMP3 (BL 32116), UAS-LifeAct-Ruby (BL 35545), UAS-Apoliner
(BL 32122)21, UAS-4E-BPCA (UAS-4E-BPTA)31, UAS-RaptorRNAi (BL 34814 and BL
31529), UAS-RictorRNAi (BL 31388 and BL 36699), UAS-foxo-TM29, UAS-foxo-GFP61

(gift from Eric Wieschaus) and endo:DE-Cad-GFP, endo:Sqh-mCherry
(gift from Thomas Lecuit)19,20 were used to visualize actomyosin cable formation. In
the second line, spaghetti-squash-mCherrry was recombined with DE-Cadherin-GFP
and both constructs were expressed under endogenous promoters. In rescue
experiments, the foxo null allele, foxoD94, was used64.
To generate the UAS-3xflag-foxo fly line the dfoxo ORF was PCR amplified using
primers SOL400 (CACCATGGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGAT
CATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGATGATGGACGGCTACGC
GC) and SOL383 (CTAGTGCACCCAGGATG GTGGC) and directionally cloned into
the pENTR/D-Topo vector (Invitrogen). The SOL400 primer encodes an N-terminal
3xFLAG-tag in frame with the dfoxo ORF. The 3xflag-foxo insert was cloned via
Gateway technology into the pUAST gattB vector and the DNA was integrated into the
genome by PhiC31-mediated transgenesis into the attP40 site65. The dfoxo-v3-mCherry
knock-in line was generated by genomic recombineering19 of the endogenous dfoxo
locus in a two-step process (Supplementary Fig. 14). First, the 30 end of the dfoxo gene
encompassing exons 9–10, 12–14 and 16 of FBgn0038197 (Flybase release r6.07)
was replaced by an attP-site using ends-out homologous recombination. The attP-site
was then used to reinsert the foxo-mCherry C-terminal fusion construct using
PhiC31-mediated transgenesis19.
Flip-out experiments. InRDN and foxo clones in the epidermis were generated
with a flip-out system66,67. Female flies with the genotype hsFlp;
Act5C4y þ 4Gal4, UAS-GFP/CyO were crossed with UAS-InRDN; Ubi-DE-Cad-
RFP/TM6B or UAS-foxo; Ubi-DE-Cad-RFP/TM6B males or in control experiments
with Ubi-DE-Cad-RFP/TM368 males. Clones were identified by GFP expression
under the Act5C promoter. Mating was carried out at 18 �C and at this condition
no GFP was detected. The Flip-out was induced by heat shock (30 min at 37 �C) of
mid-stage L2 larvae. The larvae were incubated for 30 h at 25 �C followed by
wounding in third instar larvae (L3).
Rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was dissolved in 200 ml
ethanol at a concentration of 1 or 20 mM and added to SYA food. For control food,
200 ml ethanol was added. 0.3% Erioglaucine disodium (food colouring) was used to
monitor larval food uptake. Larvae were maintained till second instar larva (L2) on
standard fly food (approximately 4 days AEL) and then switched to food
supplemented with rapamycin for 21 h before the wound healing assay.
Immobilizing larvae. Early L3 larvae were rinsed with tap water (no longer than
5 min) dried carefully and anaesthetised using diethyl ether. Larvae were selected
and transferred with a pain brush into a self-made eppi-cage69 dried with a small
piece of napkin. The eppi-cage was then inserted into the etherized chamber69. For
long-term immobilization of larvae we anaesthetised them for 3.5 min with diethyl
ether. 15–20 anaesthetised larvae were transferred into a cell culture dish with glass
bottom (35 mm, Greiner bio-one art. no: 627861) and sorted and oriented under a
stereomicroscope.
Laser wounding. Epidermal cells were wounded by laser on a spinning disk
confocal microscope (Ultra-View VoX, PerkinElmer; Inverse, Nikon TiE) equipped
with 355 nm pulsed ultraviolet laser (DPSL-355/14; Rapp OptoElectronic).
Wounds were induced at the dorsal midline of abdominal segment A3 or A4 with
0.25–0.3 mJ pulsed energy in B1 ns. Laser ablation was conducted during time-
lapse imaging.
We expressed fluorescent markers, RNAi and protein constructs using three
Gal4 drivers. da-Gal4 is expressed ubiquitously60, e22c-Gal4 in the epidermis from
embryonic stage 10–11 onward59, and A58-Gal4 in the epidermis from the first
larval instar onward12. Only larvae with normal epidermal morphology and body
size and that developed and survived to adulthood were used for evaluations and
quantitative analyses. After wound closure, larvae were returned individually into
food vials and monitored for survival. We evaluated data only from larvae that
survived at least two days post injury
Live imaging. Larvae were imaged at B25 �C on a spinning disk confocal
microscope (Ultra-View VoX, PerkinElmer; Inverse, Nikon TiE) with a � 60 Plan
C-Apochromat water-immersion objective and an attached CCD camera (C9100-
50 CamLink; 1000 � 1000 pixel) controlled by the Volocity software 6.3. 57 indi-
vidual z-stacks with a step size of 0.28 mm were taken every 2–15 min for a 3–7 h.
Image processing and quantification. Images were processed using Fiji (National
Institutes of Health) or Volocity 6.3. Wound areas, defined as the area left open
between the lamellipodia, were measured manually with Fiji software during the
early expansion phase, we measured the area left open by the dead cell.

Author contributions
P.K., S.A.E., L.P. and M.L. conceived the project. P.K. designed and performed the
experiments, developed the long-term live imaging and laser ablation for Drosophila
larvae and analysed the data, except for the transmission electron microscopy,
which was performed by P.K. and B.M. S.G. and V.B. generated the foxo-v3-mCherry and
UAS-3xflag-foxo line. P.K., M.L., S.A.E. and L.P. drafted the manuscript.
