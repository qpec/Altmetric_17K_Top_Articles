Aims
The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia is well documented, but it is not clear if oral anticoa-
gulant treatment offers protection. The aim of the study is therefore to compare the incidence of new dementia in
patients with AF with and without oral anticoagulants, and to explore if there is a difference between novel antico-
agulants and warfarin in this respect.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Retrospective registry study of all patients with hospital diagnosis of AF and no previous diagnosis of dementia in
Sweden between 2006 and 2014. Propensity score matching, falsification endpoints, and analyses according to
intention to treat as well as on-treatment principles were used. The study included 444 106 patients and over
1.5 million years at risk. Patients on anticoagulant treatment at baseline was associated with 29% lower risk of
dementia than patients without anticoagulant treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
0.68–0.74] and 48% lower risk analysed on treatment (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.50–055). Direct comparison between
new oral anticoagulants and warfarin showed no difference (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67–1.40).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The risk of dementia is higher without oral anticoagulant treatment in patients with AF. This suggests that early ini-
tiation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with AF could be of value in order to preserve cognitive function.

Introduction
It is well known that atrial fibrillation (AF) carries an increased risk
for stroke,1 and that this risk can be significantly reduced by oral
anticoagulation (OAC).2 The association between AF and demen-
tia is also well documented,3–5 but it is not clear if AF-related
dementia can be prevented by OAC treatment. The thought being
that, if OAC protects against large emboli which causes stroke,
OAC treatment also ought to protect against small emboli which
causes microinfarctions that eventually lead to cognitive deterio-
ration. Imaging studies have shown that structural cerebral
changes are common in patients with AF even when there is no
history of cerebral infarction.6,7
A recent systematic review of 19 studies including 15 876 patients
suggested that OAC treatment may be associated with cognitive
decline over time, but the evidence was inconclusive.8 One study
reported an inverse correlation between the quality of warfarin
treatment and incidence of dementia.9 Another study reported
higher risk of dementia in warfarin treated patients with AF, than in
patients with other indications for warfarin treatment.10 A recent
study showed lower incidence of dementia among patients treated
with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) than among patients
treated with warfarin.11
A randomized placebo controlled trial with this purpose would of
course be ideal to answer this question, but such a study will never
be done due to ethical reasons; it is not possible to treat AF patients
at risk of stroke with placebo. A study randomizing AF patients to
either dabigatran or warfarin which has incident dementia as primary
endpoint was launched earlier this year and is expected to be com-
pleted in 2021 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03061006).
Our aim was to study the incidence of dementia among AF
patients with and without OAC treatment. We also wanted to inves-
tigate if there is a difference between novel anticoagulants and war-
farin in this respect.

Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the Swedish Patient
register and the Dispensed Drug register, cross-linked by individual civic
registration numbers.
The Patient register carries detailed information about all hospital-
izations in the country since 1987, and about all visits in specialized open
care since 2001. Laboratory values and results of examinations are not
available.
The Drug register stores details about all dispensed prescriptions in
Sweden since 1 July 2005. All pharmacies are required to participate by
law, and information is transferred electronically whenever a drug is dis-
pensed. It does not include information about prescriptions that have not
been dispensed, drugs used during short-time hospital stay and over-the-
counter drugs.
These Swedish registers have frequently been used for epidemiological
and outcome studies, and the general quality of data are good according
to validation studies.12–17
Identification of study population
All individuals with a diagnosis of AF during 2006–14 were identified from
the Patient register. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of dementia
were excluded. No other exclusions were made. Diagnoses given, and
prescriptions filled, up to 30days after the first contact with AF during the
inclusion period were considered as baseline conditions. Subsequently,
time at risk was counted from Day 31. The codes used to define dementia
and comorbidity are listed in Supplementary material online, Table S1.
The Patient register was also used to detect incident new dementia dur-
ing follow-up.
Statistical methods
Baseline characteristics are presented descriptively and differences
tested with Wilcoxon’s signed rank test and Pearson’s v2 test as
appropriate. Incidences are reported as number of newly diagnosed
dementia per 100 patient years at risk, with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI).
Propensity scores for the likelihood of any oral anticoagulant treat-
ment at baseline were obtained by logistic regression. The cofactors
used in the regression are listed in a footnote to Supplementary mate
rial online, Table S2. Another set of propensity scores were obtained
for the likelihood of obtaining a NOAC rather than warfarin for
patients using an oral anticoagulant at baseline.
Patients were matched according to propensity scores in order to
produce as similar cohorts as possible on measurable cofactors.
Matching was made 1:1 without replacement and with caliper of
0.000001. The matched cohorts were compared on the individual
variables in the search of remaining imbalances. Cofactors that had
not been balanced by this process (see Supplementary material
online, Tables S2 and S3) were introduced as cofactors in subsequent
multivariable Cox regression procedures used to evaluate the associ-
ation between treatment and incident dementia.
The main analyses were performed in analogy to the intention to
treat principle, i.e. analyses were made according to each patient’s
treatment at baseline regardless of subsequent changes. We also
made analyses in analogy with the on-treatment principle, whereby
we restricted the analysis to propensity score matched patients with
either access to anticoagulants covering 80% of the time at risk or
non-OAC patients who never were exposed to OAC during follow-
up.
For determination of the number of days NOACs would last, we
used the information about dispensed quantities and the standard
dose for the strength of the drug. For warfarin, which has no fixed
dose, we assumed that all days between two subsequent purchases
were days on treatment as long as the interval did not exceed
6months. If it exceeded 6 months, or if there were no more pur-
chases, treatment was assumed to have stopped after 3 months.
In order to further assess the likelihood of confounding by indica-
tion we used four falsification endpoints18 which we considered
unlikely to be causally affected by anticoagulant treatment; influenza,
hospitalization for fall accident, new diagnosis of diabetes, and new
diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The rationale for
using a falsification endpoint is that if an association is found between
a treatment and a falsification endpoint, and if it can be postulated
that the treatment is not the cause of the outcome, the result has to
be due to unknown factor(s), which the analysis was unable to adjust
for. A finding of an association between OAC treatment and these
falsification endpoints would therefore indicate the presence of unac-
counted confounding and the strength of that association would indi-
cate to which extent a finding of an association between OAC
treatment and dementia is a result of confounding.
P-values <0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were per-
formed by using Stata version 14.0 (Stata Corp., 4905 Lakeway Dr,
College Station TX 77856, USA). The Forest plots were produced in
R 3.3.0.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee (approvals
# 2014/894-31, #2014/876-31/4, #2014/1065-31) and conformed to
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Results
The number of patients identified with a diagnosis of AF during the
inclusion period was 456960. Among these, 12854 already had a
diagnosis of dementia and were therefore excluded, leaving 444 106
patients for the study. During over 1.5 million years of follow-up,
26 210 patients received a new diagnosis of dementia (1.73 per
100years at risk).
At baseline, 241160 patients (54.3%) were without oral anticoagu-
lant treatment (OAC), 190 570 patients (42.9%) used warfarin, 199
patients (0.04%) used phenprocuomon, and 12916 patients (2.9%)
used a NOAC.
Patients who developed dementia were older and had more
comorbidity than patients who did not develop dementia (Table 1).
The strongest predictors for dementia were age [hazard ratio (HR)
per decade 2.19, 95% CI 2.16–2.22], Parkinson’s disease (2.46, 95%
CI 2.25–2.69), absence of OAC treatment (HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.73–
2.53), and alcohol abuse (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.41–1.66) (Table 2).
Anticoagulation vs. no
anticoagulation
The incidence rate of dementia among patients with OAC was lower
than among patients without OAC (1.14 vs. 1.78 per 100 patient

years at risk, P < 0.001) (Figure 1). This difference was present in all
subgroups (Figure 2).
Patients with OAC at baseline were younger and healthier than
patients without OAC, e.g. regarding previous hospitalization with
bleeding diagnoses (12.2% vs. 19.3%, P < 0.001), intracranial bleeds
(1.7% vs. 3.3%, P < 0.001), and recurrent fall accidents (3.4% vs. 8.0%,
P < 0.001). See Supplementary material online, Tables S2 and S3 for a
detailed account of these differences.
Propensity score matching was applied, and two cohorts of 80 948
patients with and without oral anticoagulant treatment were created,
which were similar on observable cofactors (see Supplementary
material online, Table S2). Comparison of these cohorts showed that
patients with OAC treatment had 29% lower risk of dementia than
patients without OAC treatment at baseline (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.68–
0.74) (Figure 2, see Supplementary material online, Table S5). There
was an interaction between OAC and the time since the first diagno-
sis of AF suggesting that the benefit of treatment may be larger if initi-
ated early rather than late.
The percentage of time at risk with access to an oral anticoagulant
was 72% in the OAC group and 25% in the group without OAC.
Thus, there was substantial crossover between treatment groups.
Data were therefore re-analysed according to the on-treatment prin-
ciple excluding patients in the non-OAC cohort who later received
OAC, and OAC patients with who had collected less OAC than
needed to cover at least 80% of the time at risk. This accentuated the
apparent benefit of OAC so that OAC patients now had 48% lower
risk of dementia than non-OAC patients (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.50–
0.55) (Figure 3, see Supplementary material online, Table S6).
We found no significant association between OAC treatment and
the falsification endpoints influenza (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70–1.06) and
fall accidents (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95–1.00). For incident diabetes (HR
1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.14) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.15), there were week associations with
OAC treatment, but in opposite direction to that of dementia.
NOAC vs. warfarin
When NOACs and warfarin were compared to no treatment, the
risk of dementia appeared to be lower with NOAC (HR 0.48, 95% CI
0.40–0.58) than with warfarin (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.60–0.64) (Table 2).

This was also true in the on-treatment analysis (NOAC HR 0.30,
95% CI 0.22–0.42 vs. VKA HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.50–0.56).
However, the NOAC and the VKA group differed in several of the
baseline characteristics as can be seen from Supplementary material
online, Tables S3 and S4. A direct comparison between NOACs and
warfarin, made after another propensity score matching for the likeli-
hood of either treatment, showed no difference regarding dementia
risk (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67–1.40) (Figure 4).
The falsification endpoints showed no significant associations
between NOAC use rather than warfarin use and influenza (HR 0.30,
95% CI 0.03–2.63), fall accidents (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.24), inci-
dent diabetes (0.92, 95% CI 0.70–1.20), or chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56–1.13).
Discussion
In this register-based study of nearly half a million patients with AF,
we found that OAC treatment was associated with 29% lower
dementia risk in the intention to treat analysis, and 48% lower
dementia risk in the on-treatment analysis.
There was a considerable crossover between the treatment
groups, defined by treatment at baseline, which acts to attenuate
associations between treatment and outcome. It is therefore natural
that the association became much stronger when the analysis was
made according to the on-treatment principle. It must however be
pointed out that the information about drug exposure from dis-
pensed prescriptions alone is inexact, especially regarding warfarin
where individual dosages vary widely. The frequency of refills is a sur-
rogate measure that is apt to overestimate the true exposure in
patients with short follow-up and few dispensations. Exclusion of
patients in the non-OAC cohort who later received OAC is however
very reliable, since all dispensed OAC purchases in the country are
recorded. Thus, the on-treatment analysis may underestimate the
relation between treatment and outcome due to attenuation.
Absence of OAC was an independent risk factor for dementia
along with more established risk factors such as age, Parkinson’s dis-
ease, earlier stroke, and alcohol abuse. The benefit of OAC treat-
ment appeared to be more pronounced among patients were
treatment had been initiated early after the first diagnosed AF epi-
sode suggesting a dose response relationship between unprotected
time in AF and development of dementia. Likewise there was a trend
towards more benefit from treatment in patients with higher
CHA2DS2-VASc scores suggesting that microembolization indeed
might be a cause of dementia in AF patients.
Cerebral microbleeds are common in AF patients irrespective of
whether they are treated with OAC or not.19 It has been suggested
that NOACs would be a better choice for prevention of dementia
than warfarin due to the fact that these consistently show a lower
rate of intracerebral bleeding.20 We could not confirm earlier obser-
vations that the risk of dementia should be lower with NOACs than
with warfarin.11
Results from Swedish patients enrolled in clinical trials21,22 as well
as non-selected patients in general practice or at anticoagulation clin-
ics23,24 have repeatedly shown mean time in therapeutic range (TTR)
to be well above 70%. It is therefore possible that NOACs may offer
better protection than warfarin in places with less well-managed war-
farin treatment than in Sweden.
Our study showed that only 45% of Swedish AF patients collected
an oral anticoagulant in a pharmacy within a month after AF had been
diagnosed for the first time. Our findings regarding dementia protec-
tion may provide a second argument for initiation of treatment
among untreated AF-patients. Since the time from diagnosis to start
of treatment appears to be an independent risk factor, early initiation
of treatment is desirable in order to preserve cognitive function.

Limitations
Being a retrospective and non-randomized study, it cannot prove or
disprove causal relationships. Multivariable analysis and propensity
score matching can compensate for known cofactors, but not for
things doctors see but do not document in code. When such obser-
vations affect treatment decisions, confounding by indication follows.
For example, elderly patients with cognitive difficulties, but without
an outright diagnosis of dementia, may not be offered OAC treat-
ment as often as other patients in the same situation.
We used four falsification endpoints for which OAC treatment
does not have a known causal relationship. When a falsification end-
point shows a significant relationship to the given treatment, one
therefore must draw the conclusion the association is due to some
unknown factor which it had not been possible to adjust for. In our
study, OAC treatment showed no association with two of these
falsification outcomes, and a week association with the two other fal-
sification outcomes. The direction of the effect in these were how-
ever opposite to that between OAC treatment and dementia, which
in our view indicate that although there may be unknown cofactors
affecting the results, these works to attenuate rather than to accentu-
ate the beneficial role of OAC treatment.
It is in the nature of registry studies that the knowledge about
study subjects is incomplete. Patients may have diseases about which
there is no information. It is uncommon for registries to give false
diagnoses. The Swedish registries are of high standard and have fre-
quently been used and validated, for research.12–17 A validation study
of 498 twins aged 70–81 showed a sensitivity of 26% and a specificity
of 97% for a discharge diagnosis of dementia compared to the diagno-
sis made at a consensus conference with access to full test results.17
The low sensitivity means that patients with pre-existing dementia

may have included in the study contributing to confounding by indica-
tion. The high specificity confers high validity to the dementia end-
point during follow-up.
The information about the exposure to vitamin K antagonists
(VKA) had to be assessed through the frequency of refill dispensings
rather than on dispensed tablets and prescribed dosages since individ-
ual dosages were not known. This makes information about the expo-
sure less exact than desired. For all drugs there is a possibility that
patients did not take all drugs they collected. The effect on the results
would most likely be one of attenuation and a bias towards null.
Access to detailed information about medical history, comorbidity,
and medication over many years prior to study entry made it possible
for us to create, through propensity score matching, cohorts that
were balanced on as many as 40 covariates. With likeness in so many
dimensions, fundamental differences on unknown cofactors are less
likely, and thus the potential damage from confounding by indication.
The dementia endpoint in this study was not adjudicated. We had
to rely on the use of clinical diagnoses. Two previous validation stud-
ies of dementia diagnoses in the Swedish patient register have shown
a specificity of 97% and 98%, respectively17,25 while data on sensitiv-
ity, which requires screening of undiagnosed subjects, is less exact. It
is likely that dementia is under-reported in the clinical setting thus
making the true prevalence of dementia higher.
We did not perform separate analyses with respect to whether AF
was permanent or intermittent as register data doesn’t offer reliable
distinction in that aspect, and because AF is a progressive disorder
and patients during a follow-up period of up to almost 9 years were
likely to progress from paroxysmal AF to permanent AF.
Neither did we attempt to analyse whether different types of
dementia could have influenced the results because the most com-
monly used code was the code for unspecified dementia, not the
more specific codes for the different forms of dementia.

Our results strongly suggest that OAC treatment protects
against dementia in AF. In order to prove this assumption,
randomized placebo controlled trials would be needed, but a pre-
viously pointed out, such studies cannot be done because of ethi-
cal reasons. It is not possible to give placebo to AF patients and
then wait for dementia or stroke to occur. Therefore, we have to
do the second best, which is to use the information in population-
wide health databases for retrospective studies while trying to
control for biases and confounders the best we can. More registry
studies in this field are therefore important in order to confirm or
reject our findings.
Conclusions
The risk of dementia is higher without oral anticoagulant treatment in
patients with AF. This suggests that early initiation of anticoagulant
treatment in patients with AF could be of value in order to preserve
cognitive function.
