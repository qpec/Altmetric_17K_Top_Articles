IMPORTANCE Chemotherapy may induce alopecia. Although scalp cooling devices have been
used to prevent this alopecia, efficacy has not been assessed in a randomized clinical trial.
OBJECTIVES To assess whether a scalp cooling device is effective at reducing
chemotherapy-induced alopecia and to assess adverse treatment effects.

RESULTS At the time of the interim analysis, 142 participants were evaluable. The mean (SD)
age of the patients was 52.6 (10.1) years; 36% (n = 51) received anthracycline-based
chemotherapy and 64% (n = 91) received taxane-based chemotherapy. Successful hair
preservation was found in 48 of 95 women with cooling (50.5%; 95% CI, 40.7%-60.4%)
compared with 0 of 47 women in the control group (0%; 95% CI, 0%-7.6%) (success rate
difference, 50.5%; 95% CI, 40.5%-60.6%). Because the 1-tailed P value from the Fisher exact
test was <.001, which crossed the superiority boundary (P = .0061), the data and safety
monitoring board recommended study termination on September 26, 2016. There were no
statistically significant differences in changes in any of the scales of quality of life from
baseline to chemotherapy cycle 4 among the scalp cooling and control groups. Only adverse
events related to device use were collected; 54 adverse events were reported in the cooling
group, all grades 1 and 2. There were no serious adverse device events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with stage I to II breast cancer receiving
chemotherapy with a taxane, anthracycline, or both, those who underwent scalp cooling
were significantly more likely to have less than 50% hair loss after the fourth chemotherapy
cycle compared with those who received no scalp cooling. Further research is needed to
assess longer-term efficacy and adverse effects.

I
n breast cancer, chemotherapy treats micrometastatic
disease and decreases the risk of recurrence. However, che-
motherapy may be associated with adverse effects such as
chemotherapy-induced alopecia, which women rate as one of
the most distressing adverse effects of chemotherapy.1,2
In many countries, scalp cooling is used to prevent alopecia.
Rapidly growing cells such as cancer and hair follicles are more
susceptible to chemotherapy.3,4 Scalp cooling is hypoth-
esized to cause cutaneous vasoconstriction in the scalp, which
reduces blood flow to the hair follicles and therefore reduces
uptake of chemotherapeutic agents. It also reduces biochemi-
cal activity, which may make hair follicles less susceptible to
the damage of chemotherapy.3,4 Modern methods to prevent
hair loss use devices that circulate fluid in a cooling cap using
refrigeration. A cap is placed on the patient prior to chemo-
therapy and does not have to be changed or removed until the
treatment is completed. Historically, success rates with scalp
cooling have been variable, but nonrandomized studies sug-
gest scalp cooling devices may be associated with less chemo-
therapy-induced alopecia.3,4
As scalp cooling acts by reducing the effect of chemo-
therapy in the scalp, a theoretical increase in the risk of scalp
metastases is often discussed.5,6 Published data demonstrate
that the incidence of scalp metastasis following chemo-
therapy in breast cancer is low, and it is exceedingly rare for
the scalp to be the first site of metastases.7,8 However, long-
term safety data from other countries only recently became
available,3,5,9 and it was this concern that previously pre-
vented the study and use of scalp cooling devices in the
United States.
The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess whether
use of the Orbis Paxman Hair Loss Prevention System, a
scalp cooling device, is safe and effective in reducing
chemotherapy-induced alopecia in woman with breast can-
cer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. As
a secondary outcome, it was hypothesized based on data
from several studies4,10-14 that women who did not have
clinically significant chemotherapy-induced alopecia would
have better quality of life compared with women with
chemotherapy-induced alopecia.
Methods
Study Design and Patients
The Scalp Cooling Alopecia Prevention (SCALP) trial was
a multicenter, randomized, nonblinded study conducted
from December 9, 2013, to September 30, 2016, for women
planning to undergo neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.
This trial was open at 7 sites across the United States: Baylor
College of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center, and 4 US Oncology Network sites
(Baylor Sammons Cancer Center, Texas Oncology–Medical
City Dallas, Texas Oncology–Houston Memorial City, and
Hematology & Oncology Associates of Northern New Jersey
[which is now Summit Medical Group–MD Anderson Cancer
Center]). The protocol was approved by the institutional
review board at each site, and all patients provided written
informed consent to participate in this clinical trial. The full
trial protocol is available in Supplement 1. Baylor College of
Medicine was the lead site and performed all the data man-
agement, monitoring, and data analysis for this clinical trial.
Key eligibility criteria were having stage I or II breast can-
cer and planning to receive at least 4 cycles of taxane- and/or
anthracycline-based chemotherapy for curative intent.
Key exclusion criteria were Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) alopecia grade
higher than 0, prior chemotherapy, history of migraine head-
aches, hypothyroidism, hepatitis, uncontrolled diabetes, se-
vere anemia, and anorexia.
Changes to the clinical trial after commencement
included allowing more chemotherapy regimens that are
commonly used to treat breast cancer (still taxane- or
anthracycline-based); allowing pertuzumab, which is a non-
chemotherapyagentnotassociatedwithhairloss;addinganin-
terim analysis (memorandum with complete analysis
plan issued on July 8, 2015); allowing a lower hemoglobin
level to account for blood loss during surgery; increasing the
allowed number of clinical sites from 5 to up to 10; and clarifi-
cations to the protocol. Race and ethnicity data were collected
by self-report.
Randomization and Intervention
Randomization was performed centrally at the lead site using
the Oracle database–backed web application that made
assignments based on a computer-generated random num-
ber. Participants were stratified by clinical site (6 of the 7
active sites had accrued patients who were part of this
interim analysis) and major type of chemotherapy (anthracy-
cline or taxane), then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the scalp
cooling device or to no scalp cooling (control) (Figure). Per-
muted blocks were used with a block size of 6: 4 in the
experimental group and 2 in the control group. The lead site
randomized and entered all patients in the study in real time
after determining eligibility and communicated assignments
back to the sites. At the time of the interim analysis, 182 par-
ticipants were randomized; of them, 30 withdrew after being
randomized but before starting chemotherapy, 6 withdrew
before completing 1 cycle of chemotherapy, and 7 withdrew
after completing the first cycle.
Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness of a scalp cooling device in
preventing alopecia in women with breast cancer undergoing
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 182 women with breast
cancer receiving chemotherapy with a taxane, anthracycline, or
both, those who underwent scalp cooling were significantly more
likely to have less than 50% hair loss compared with no scalp
cooling (50.5% vs 0%). The trial was stopped early for superiority,
and there was no effect on measures of quality of life.
Meaning This scalp cooling system was more likely to prevent
alopecia than no treatment, and further research is needed to
assess longer-term efficacy and adverse effects.

Scalp cooling using a scalp cooling device was done 30
minutes prior to and during and 90 minutes after each che-
motherapy infusion. For participants receiving scalp cooling,
a comfort scale4 was administered after each treatment.
Alopecia assessments using the CTCAE v4.0 were completed
at baseline and after each cycle of chemotherapy by a clini-
cian blinded to treatment assignment, by the participant’
s cli-
nician, and by the participant. Participants were also asked if
they needed to use a wig and/or a head wrap with each alope-
cia assessment. The European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 30
(EORTC QLQ-C30), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS), and Body Image Scale (BIS) questionnaires were
completed by participants at baseline, after 4 cycles of che-
motherapy, and at completion of chemotherapy if the partici-
pant received more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Study
participants will be followed up at routine follow-up visits
for 5 years after the study for safety (time and site of first
recurrence) and overall survival.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy end point was success in hair preserva-
tion after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. Success was
defined as CTCAE v4.0 alopecia grade 0 (no hair loss) or
grade 1 (<50% hair loss not requiring a wig). Failure was
defined as CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 (>50% hair loss, requiring use
of a wig) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). The primary efficacy
end point was assessed by clinicians who were independent
and unaware of study treatment. Participant withdrawals
from the study were deemed treatment failures. The explor-
atory secondary efficacy end points were success in hair
preservation assessed by the participant’
s clinician and by
the participant; use of wigs and/or head wraps; participant-
reported comfort; and quality of life.

Quality of life was assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30
(emotional functioning scale and social functioning scale),
HADS (anxiety summary and depression summary), and BIS
(body image scale). The emotional functioning scale score was
calculated from EORTC QLQ-C30 items 21 through 24 and the
social functioning scale score was calculated from EORTC
QLQ-C30 items 26 and 27 using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring
formula, which linearly transformed the average of raw scores
to a range from 0 to 100 (a higher score represented a higher
or better level of functioning). Any missing questionnaire
items in the functioning scale calculation were replaced by the
average of nonmissing items if less than half of the items
from the functioning scale were missing. A change in the func-
tioning scale score of 5 to 10 is considered “a little” change for
better or worse; a change of greater than 10 to 20 is consid-
ered a “moderate” change; and a change greater than 20 is con-
sidered a “very much” change.15 The HADS was used to as-
sess anxiety and depression. It includes 7 questions to assess
anxiety and 7 to assess depression. The summary scores
(sum of the 7 question items) for anxiety and depression each
ranged from 0 to 21: scores of 0 to 7 were considered normal,
8 to 10 were considered borderline abnormal (borderline case),
and 11 to 21 were considered abnormal (case). Missing
items were replaced by the average of nonmissing items if only
1 item from the anxiety or depression scale was missing.16 The
BIS summary score was the sum of the first 9 (of 10) items in
the BIS. The last item in the BIS for scar was not applicable to
the study participants, so it was not included. The summary
score ranged from 0 to 27; a score of 0 indicated no symp-
toms or distress, and a higher score indicated increasing symp-
toms or distress. Missing items were replaced by the average
of nonmissing items if only 1 or 2 items from the 9 items in the
BIS were missing.17
The primary safety end point was anticipated adverse
device effects, as the complications were known to be associ-
ated with use of scalp cooling devices. Anticipated adverse
device effects included cold discomfort, headache, forehead
pain, dizziness, and nausea described in CTCAE v4.0.
The secondary safety end points were participant-reported
comfort scale score and early scalp metastases and survival.
Participant-reported comfort was categorized into 5 levels:
very comfortable, reasonably comfortable, comfortable,
uncomfortable, and very uncomfortable.4 Participants will be
followed up for 5 years for overall survival and first recur-
rence, including isolated scalp metastases. Time to recur-
rence or overall survival will be measured from the date of
randomization to the date of first recurrence or the date
of death. Participants without recurrence or death were con-
sidered as censored at the last contact date.
Statistical Analysis
We planned to enroll 235 participants to provide 85% power
to detect, using Fisher exact test, a 20% absolute difference
in hair preservation (ie, 15% with no cooling vs 35% with
scalp cooling). There have been no randomized studies to
date; in observational studies the rate of hair retention has
been variable, with rates from 0% to 90%.18 This trial was
designed to detect a 20% absolute difference in hair preser-
vation (1 in 5 participants), which would also be a clinically
meaningful outcome. One interim analysis was planned to
allow the study to stop early for efficacy (superiority) after 95
and 47 patients had been enrolled to cooling or no cooling,
respectively, and had been evaluated for the primary end
point. To maintain the overall type I error rate, an O’
Brien-
Fleming spending function was used to set the superiority
boundaries (interim boundary was calculated as P = .0061, or
Z = 2.509).
All analyses for efficacy were based on the modified
intent-to-treat population, defined as eligible and random-
ized participants who underwent at least 1 cycle of chemo-
therapy. The primary efficacy analysis compared the success
of hair preservation between scalp cooling with the device
and control (no scalp cooling) after 4 cycles of chemotherapy
using Fisher exact test. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and a
multivariable logistic regression model were used to explore
the treatment effect after adjusting for clinical site and che-
motherapy. The success rates varied across the sites and by
major chemotherapy type, so site and chemotherapy were
added to the statistical models. Because the control group
had no success in hair preservation, the maximum likelihood
estimates did not exist. Data were analyzed using a logistic
regression model with penalized maximum likelihood esti-
mation. Independent variables included treatment group,
sites, and major chemotherapy type. The results showed that
these were all significant variables associated with the out-
come of hair loss. Planned exploratory secondary analyses
summarized perceived hair preservation on the basis of par-
ticipant (assessed by the CTCAE v4.0 and an alopecia picto-
rial tool) and use of wigs and/or head wraps by descriptive
statistics with rates and their 95% confidence intervals, and
changes from baseline to the fourth cycle of chemotherapy in
quality of life assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, HADS, and
BIS questionnaires were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum
tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Safety analyses were planned to
report frequencies of device-associated adverse events,
including serious adverse device effects and unanticipated
adverse device effects. Unless otherwise specified, 2-sided
statistical tests were used and P ≤ .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. All analyses were performed in SAS version
9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Between December 9, 2013, and September 30, 2016,
229 participants were enrolled and provided written in-
formed consent for the SCALP clinical trial at 7 sites across the
United States. Of these 229 participants, 182 were random-
ized to scalp cooling or control. Of the 182 randomized par-
ticipants,142participantswhocompletedatleast1cycleofche-
motherapy were evaluable for the primary end point and
composed the modified intent-to-treat population (Figure). A
preplanned interim analysis was performed, and the data from
the participants in this interim analysis are reported herein.

control groups were generally comparable. In the modified
intent-to-treat population, the mean (SD) age was 52.6 (10.1)
years; 64% of participants (n = 91) received taxane-based
chemotherapy and 36% (n = 51) received anthracycline-based
chemotherapy. At the time of the interim analysis, 95
patients in the cooling group and 47 patients in the no cool-
ing group were evaluable and had completed 4 cycles of che-
motherapy. The mean age and other demographic variables
of the patients included in the interim analysis and of the
participants who received taxane-based or anthracycline-
based chemotherapy were similar to those of the entire group
enrolled (Table 1).
Among the patients in the interim analysis, 48 of 95
women in the cooling group (50.5%; 95% CI, 40.7%-60.4%)
and 0 of 47 women in the control group (0%; 95% CI,
0%-7.6%) had hair preservation (Table 2). The success rate
difference between the 2 groups was 50.5% (95% CI, 40.5%-
60.6%). The 1-tailed P value from the Fisher exact test was
<.001, which crossed the superiority boundary (P = .0061).
Thus, on September 26, 2016, the data and safety monitoring
board agreed with the recommendations from the statistician
to stop accrual to the study early and release the results to
the principal investigator owing to superiority of hair reten-
tion in the participants who received scalp cooling vs the

group not receiving scalp cooling. Preservation in the cooling
group was statistically higher than that in the control group
(P < .001 by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test).
There were substantial differences in success of hair pres-
ervation by site (Table 2) and by drug group (taxane vs anthra-
cycline; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Success ranged from 0%
(n = 1 in the cooling group) to 68.6% (n = 51 in the cooling
group). In an exploratory post hoc analysis (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2) that accounted for site effects, the estimated
rate of hair preservation with anthracycline-based chemo-
therapy was 16% (95% CI, 4%-46%), and with taxanes was 59%
(95% CI, 27%-84%) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Rates of participant-perceived hair retention were 48 of 95
womeninthecoolinggroup(50.5%;95%CI,40.7%-60.4%)and
0 of 47 women in the control group (0%; 95% CI, 0%-7.6%).
Rates of oncologist-graded hair preservation were 53 of 95
womeninthecoolinggroup(55.8%;95%CI,45.8%-65.4%)and
0 of 47 women in the control group (0%; 95% CI, 0%-7.6%).
Wigs or head wraps were used by 63% (95% CI, 53%-72%) of
the patients who received scalp cooling and 100% (95% CI,
92.4%-100%) of those who were in the control group.
Quality of Life
The change in emotional functioning and social functioning
after 4 cycles of chemotherapy was not significantly different
for the patients in the cooling group with hair preservation
(n = 48), patients in the cooling group without hair preserva-
tion (n = 46), and patients in the noncooling group (n = 47)
(Table 3). The HADS anxiety and depression summary scores
were normal (<7) at baseline and after 4 cycles in both the cool-
ing group (with and without hair preservation) and the non-
cooling group. The median BIS summary scores ranged from
2 to 3.5 at baseline and from 5 to 7 after 4 cycles of chemo-
therapy among the participants, with no significant differ-
ence between the 3 groups.
Adverse Events
Only adverse events related to device use were collected, and
no adverse events known to be associated with chemo-
therapy were collected. There were 54 adverse events
reported in the cooling group: 46 anticipated adverse device
effects and 8 unanticipated adverse device effects. There
were no serious adverse device events. All adverse events
were grade 1 (n = 46) or grade 2 (n = 8), and these included
chills, dizziness, headache, nausea, paresthesia, pruritus,
sinus pain, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and skin
ulceration (Table 4). Of the grade 2 adverse device events, 7
were headache and 1 was scalp pain. The only unanticipated
adverse events were dry skin and scalp pain. Based on the
comfort scale, most patients were comfortable, reasonably
comfortable, or very comfortable while wearing the device,
with a median rating of reasonably comfortable. Of note,
there were 6 participants not included in this safety analysis
who withdrew consent during the precooling process: 4
because the device was too cold or uncomfortable, 1 due to
anxiety, and 1 due to claustrophobia from the device. There
was also 1 participant who withdrew during the chemo-
therapy prior to completing 1 cycle of chemotherapy because
the device was too cold. These participants are not part of the
modified intent-to-treat population as they did not complete

1 cycle of chemotherapy. Sixty additional participants were
enrolled in this clinical trial, and the last participant is
expected to complete chemotherapy in February 2017. A final
analysis is planned at that time.
Discussion
In this study of women with breast cancer undergoing che-
motherapy with a taxane, with an anthracycline, or with both
agents, patients who received scalp cooling were significantly
more likely than patients who did not receive scalp cooling to
have less than 50% hair loss (with 50% of those in the scalp
cooling group retaining their hair, compared with 0% of
those in the control group). This is consistent with results
from observational studies.4,19-31 It is unclear why no differ-
ences emerged in various measures of quality of life between
women who retained their hair and those who did not.
There was variability in the rate of hair preservation by
site. This may be due to several factors, including the proper
fitting of the cap, type of chemotherapy, and intrinsic patient
characteristics. The fit of the cap is key to successful hair
retention with the scalp cooling device, and there is a learn-
ing curve with use of the device; with repeated use, clinicians
become more skilled at ensuring a tight fit and there is a
higher likelihood of hair retention. After this clinical trial
started, with more experience it was easier to train others on
cap fitting. Thus, sites that opened later had better advice on
ensuring a tight cap fit, which may have led to higher rates of
hair retention. There was also a research coordinator’
s meet-
ing in May 2015 at which retraining of cap fitting was per-
formed, including techniques on how to better apply external
pressure to improve cap fit. Another factor accounting for
variable results may be different patient characteristics such
as biochemical characteristics of hair from people of different
ethnicities and hair thickness.21 Studies in other countries
have shown that different chemotherapy regimens have dif-
ferent rates of hair preservation success. For example, there
were higher rates of hair preservation with taxane- vs
anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and certain taxane-
based chemotherapy regimens such as weekly paclitaxel
have higher rates of hair preservations vs every-3-week
docetaxel.21,32 In this study, sites that had higher rates of tax-
ane use also had higher rates of hair retention (59% vs 16%;
eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The other US trial that is nonran-
domized and used only taxane-based chemotherapy showed
a similar hair retention rate of 66.3%.31 If scalp cooling
becomes widely used in the United States, decisions about
type of chemotherapy may be informed by rates of hair
retention with use of scalp cooling devices: for example, with
ERBB2-positive breast cancer, a patient and physician weigh-
ing options for chemotherapy (docetaxel, carboplatin, and
trastuzumab [TCH] for 6 cycles vs doxorubicin and cyclo-
phosphamide for 4 cycles followed by docetaxel and trastu-
zumab for 4 cycles [AC→TH]) may consider the fact that TCH
chemotherapy has higher rates of hair preservation. Cost may
also be used in decision making about use of scalp cooling
devices. Currently, scalp cooling devices in the United States
cost about $1500 to $3000 total per patient and are not reim-
bursed by health insurance.
Statistical analysis of the questionnaires assessing qual-
ity of life did not show any differences in the group that
received scalp cooling vs the control group or in the hair re-
tention group vs alopecia group. This may be due to many
reasons, including the distressing nature of a breast cancer
diagnosis and treatment, changes in body image due to sur-
gery and toxic effects from chemotherapy, and the lack of
validated quality-of-life tools that are specifically designed to
evaluate the quality-of-life effects of alopecia. Review of the
literature shows that chemotherapy-induced alopecia is an
important problem to patients with cancer, ranking among
the most distressing adverse effects. Women have reported

reported: 44 patient-cycles had 46 anticipated adverse device effects and 8
patient-cycles had 8 unanticipated adverse device effects. There were no
serious adverse events or serious adverse device events. All adverse events
were grade 1 (n = 46) or grade 2 (n = 8). For analysis purposes, within each
adverse device event and cycle, each patient was counted once, and patients
with the same adverse event within a chemotherapy cycle were counted
at the highest reported grade. Of 101 participants in the cooling group,
28 (27.7%) had at least 1 adverse event.

decreases in self-esteem, sexuality, and body image related
to chemotherapy-induced alopecia; some women have even
described having chemotherapy-induced alopecia as be-
ing more difficult than losing a breast. Better quality-of-life
tools need to be developed to fully evaluate the effects of
chemotherapy-induced alopecia on body image and psyche,
but studies confirm that it is a concerning adverse effect.33
The use of scalp cooling devices may help to alleviate some
of this distress.
This study has several limitations, including variability of
results at each site, assessing for successful hair retention
after only 4 cycles of chemotherapy, and decreased power by
stopping the trial early. Due to this heterogeneity in efficacy
among treatment sites, the ultimate efficacy may be less than
50% at some sites where more anthracycline-based chemo-
therapy is administered or where there is less expertise in cap
fitting. The primary efficacy end point was hair retention
after 4 cycles of chemotherapy; therefore, participants who
receive more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy, particularly
with anthracyclines, may also have lower rates of hair reten-
tion. By stopping the trial early, the power to detect any dif-
ference in the end points, including adverse events, will be
reduced with fewer patients and the 95% confidence interval
will be larger. Substantial site differences and learning effects
may influence how effective the intervention will be in clini-
cal practice.
Overall, the scalp cooling device was well tolerated with
no serious adverse device events, and most participants
thought it was reasonably comfortable. Because of the con-
cern of scalp metastases, study participants will continue
to be followed up at routine follow-up visits for 5 years after
the study for safety (time and site of first recurrence) and
overall survival.
Conclusions
Among women with stage I to II breast cancer receiving che-
motherapy with a taxane, anthracycline, or both, those who
underwent scalp cooling were significantly more likely to
have less than 50% hair loss after the fourth chemotherapy
cycle compared with those who received no scalp cooling.
Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and
adverse effects.
