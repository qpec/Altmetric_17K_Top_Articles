Abstract
To better understand the association of alcohol intake with cognitively healthy longevity (CHL) we 
explored the association between amount and frequency of alcohol intake and CHL among 1,344 
older community-dwelling adults. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaire in 1984–1987. 
Cognitive function was assessed in approximate four-year intervals between 1988 and 2009. 
Multinomial logistic regression, adjusting for multiple lifestyle and health factors, was used to 
examine the association between alcohol consumption and CHL (living to age 85 without 
cognitive impairment), survival to age 85 with cognitive impairment (MMSE score >1.5 standard 
deviations below expectation for age, sex and education), or death before age 85. Most participants 
(88%) reported some current alcohol intake; 49% reported a moderate amount of alcohol intake, 
and 48% reported drinking near-daily. Relative to nondrinkers, moderate and heavy drinkers (up to 
3 drinks/day for women and for men 65 years and older, up to 4 drinks/day for men under 65 
years) had significantly higher adjusted odds of survival to age 85 without cognitive impairment 
(P’s<0.05). Near-daily drinkers had 2–3 fold higher adjusted odds of CHL versus living to at least 
age 85 with cognitive impairment (odds ratio (OR)=2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 
3.49) or death before 85 (OR=3.24; 95% CI: 1.92, 5.46). Although excessive drinking has negative 
health consequences, these results suggest that regular, moderate drinking may play a role in 
cognitively healthy longevity.

 INTRODUCTION
Advances in public health and biomedical science have led to significant gains in life 
expectancy. By 2050 the world population over age 85 is expected to grow by 350% [1]. To 
decrease the societal burden of this demographic shift and to enhance quality of life among 
older adults, it is imperative to identify factors that promote healthy longevity. One potential 
factor is alcohol intake. Although excessive alcohol intake and alcohol intake among 
vulnerable populations (e.g. adolescents, pregnant women, those with substance use 
disorders) is a major public health concern, moderate intake among healthy adults may be 
associated with health benefits and longer lifespan [2–5]. Several studies report that the 
benefits of moderate alcohol intake also extend to the maintenance of cognitive health in late 
life [6–9], however the association is not consistent. The majority of studies support a 
protective effect of moderate alcohol intake, but some report a negative or null association 
[10–12]. A meta-analysis of 23 longitudinal studies found that low to moderate alcohol 
intake was protective for dementia (relative risk (RR)=0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.53, 0.75) and Alzheimer’s disease (RR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.74), but was not 
significantly associated with vascular dementia or age-related cognitive decline [8]. 
However, the characterization of alcohol exposure, the cognitive outcomes assessed, and the 
consideration of confounding variables varies widely across studies [13].
Most studies have examined the association of the amount of alcohol intake with mortality 
or cognitive impairment; fewer have examined associations with drinking frequency [14]. 
However, there is increasing evidence that drinking patterns may have greater influence over 
health than the amount consumed in a given time period, with the most favorable profile 
observed in regular, moderate drinkers and the poorest outcomes associated with chronic, 
heavy and binge-type drinking habits [15–17]. The importance of drinking pattern in 
prolonging cognitive health is not well known and merits greater attention.
The objective of this study was to examine the association of the amount and frequency of 
alcohol intake with cognitively healthy survival to age 85 in a cohort of older community-
dwelling adults, taking into account multiple potentially confounding lifestyle and health 
factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
The Rancho Bernardo Study (RBS) is an ongoing cohort study established in 1972–1974 
when 82% (n=6,339) of residents aged 30 and older, from the San Diego, CA suburb of 
Rancho Bernardo, were recruited for a study of heart disease risk factors [18]. Participants 
were predominantly white (99.4%), middle to upper-middle class adults aged 30–79. In 
1984–87, 82% of the surviving RBS participants (n=2,479) attended a research clinic visit 
that included a detailed questionnaire on alcohol intake. Participants were followed for vital 
status through December 2013. Cognitive function was first assessed at a research visit in 
1988–92, and at subsequent visits approximately every 4 years. The last visit included in this 
analysis occurred in 2009. Eligibility for the current study required that participants had the 
potential to reach age 85 during the follow-up period (i.e. age 55–84 years at the 1984–87

 visit); 538 participants were excluded based on age eligibility. Additionally, those who lived 
to at least age 85 must have had a cognitive function assessment within two years of their 
85th birthday, or must have shown intact cognitive function at any visit subsequent to their 
85th birthday; 584 participants were excluded based on this criterion. After exclusion of an 
additional 13 participants missing educational status, there remained 1,344 participants (728 
women, 616 men) for the current analysis. This study was conducted in compliance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the University of California San Diego (UC San 
Diego) Institutional Review Board; all participants provided written informed consent prior 
to participation at each visit.
Alcohol consumption
Alcohol consumption was assessed using a self-administered standardized questionnaire 
collected during the 1984–87 visit. Participants were asked if they had ever drunk an 
alcoholic beverage and, if so, whether they had done so within the past 12 months. Those 
answering yes to these questions were queried about how often they consumed alcohol in an 
average week with response choices of daily/almost daily; 3–4 times/week, 1–2 times/week, 
1–2 times/month, or once/month. They were also asked how many bottles or cans of beer, 
glasses of wine, mixed drinks, and liqueurs or other drinks they consume during an average 
week. The following formula was used to estimate average weekly alcohol intake: grams of 
ethanol =[(number of bottles or cans of beer)(12oz.)(0.045oz. ethanol/oz. beer) + (number of 
glasses of wine)(3.5oz.)(0.122oz. ethanol/oz. wine) + (number of mixed drinks)(1.5oz.)
(0.41oz. ethanol/oz. spirits) + (number of liqueurs)(1oz.)(0.362oz. ethanol/oz. liqueurs)×
(29.6 ml/oz.)]×0.7893g/ml where 12 grams of ethanol is equal to one drink [19].
Individuals denying past alcohol use (lifetime abstainers) and those who did not drink within 
the last year (former drinkers) were categorized as non-drinkers. Using sex-specific 
guidelines from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, current drinking 
was categorized as moderate (≤1 drink/day for men age 65 and older and women; ≤2 
drinks/day for men under 65), heavy (>1–3 drinks/day for men age 65 and older and women; 
>2–4 for men under 65), or excessive (>3 drinks/day for men age 65 and older and women; 
>4 drinks/day for men under 65) [20]. To describe frequency of alcohol intake, participants 
were categorized as nondrinkers, infrequent (<2 times/month), weekly (1–4 times/week) or 
near-daily drinkers (5–7 times/week).
Mortality assessment
Vital status was determined annually by mailed questionnaires. Date and cause of death for 
decedents was obtained from death certificates.
Cognitive status
Cognitive function was assessed beginning in 1988–1992 at 6 visits at approximate four-year 
intervals. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [21] was administered by a trained 
interviewer [22]. Raw MMSE scores were converted to sex, age and education adjusted Z-
scores using normative data from the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Disease 
Research Center Uniform Data Set [23]. Individuals with Z-scores below −1.5 were 
classified as having cognitive impairment [24]. Individuals surviving to age 85 with

 cognitive impairment were classified as having Cognitively Impaired Longevity (CIL). 
Those surviving to at least age 85 without cognitive impairment were classified as attaining 
Cognitively Healthy Longevity (CHL). To be classified as having CHL individuals must 
have completed the MMSE within 2 years of age 85, or older, with a Z-score of −1.5 or 
higher.
Covariate assessment
Baseline data collected at the 1984–87 visit included detailed information on lifestyle, 
medical history, anthropometrics and laboratory measures. Lifestyle information, including 
smoking, exercise (≥3 times/week), and marital status was acquired through standard 
questionnaires. As described previously [25], depressed mood was assessed using 18 of the 
21 items on the Beck Depression Inventory [26]; scores were proportionally adjusted. 
Individuals with a score below 13 were considered not categorically depressed. Participants 
were also asked about current medication use (number of medications) and whether they had 
ever been diagnosed with any of the following: thyroid, liver, kidney, or cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, cancer (non-skin), emphysema, arthritis, hip fracture, hypertension, stroke, 
or transient ischemic attack. Height, weight and waist and hip circumference were measured 
with participants in light clothing and no shoes, and waist-hip ratio was calculated as a 
measure of central adiposity. Blood pressure was recorded as the average of two readings 
obtained while the participant was in the rested, seated position by a nurse trained in the 
Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program protocol [27]. Metabolic syndrome was 
defined using 2001 NCEP-ATPIII criteria [28].
Blood samples were collected after a requested overnight fast. Total, high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were 
measured in a Center for Disease Control certified laboratory [29]. High-sensitivity C-
reactive protein (CRP) measured by immunonephelometry (N-Latex CRP mono, Dade 
Behring, Deerfield, Illinois) was available for 1,040 subjects. Serum aspartate 
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were measured by spectrophotometry. 
Gamma-glutamyl transferase was measured using the colorimetric method by a UCSD 
clinical laboratory. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was carried out for a subsample of 
892 participants by Sequana Therapeutics (La Jolla, CA) [30].
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for independent variables including the mean and 
standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and frequencies and percent for categorical 
variables. Non-normally distributed variables were log-transformed prior to analysis. 
Differences in covariates by levels of alcohol intake were assessed by chi-square or Fisher’s 
exact tests and ANOVAs. Tests for trend were performed using linear or logistic regression.
Multinomial logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association between 
alcohol consumption and the three level outcome of interest: death before 85, CIL, and 
CHL. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated unadjusted and in sequential 
models adding adjustment for {1} age (years), sex and education (some college; yes/no), {2} 
smoking (never/current/former), exercise (≥3 times/week; yes/no) and waist-hip ratio, {3}

 number of comorbidities and number of medications, {4} marital status (married/not-
married) and {5} depression (Beck Depression Inventory score >13, yes/no). Beck 
Depression Inventory scores were missing for 70 participants. Missing values for depression 
(yes/no) were imputed using SAS PROC MI. Non-drinkers (current non-drinkers and 
lifetime abstainers) were used as the reference category for all models.
Linear trends were assessed by including amount and frequency of alcohol intake as ordinal 
variables, and nonlinear trends were assessed by inclusion of quadratic terms. Multiplicative 
interactions were evaluated by testing the significance of alcohol intake by sex and alcohol 
intake by APOE genotype interaction terms.
Potential confounding effects of diet were explored in a subset of 495 individuals who 
completed the 153-item Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire [31] at baseline. We 
calculated a modified Mediterranean diet score based on the scale by Trichopoulou et al. 
[32] as previously described [33]. We used the following components: vegetables, legumes, 
fruits, nuts, whole grains, fish, red meat, and monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio. Alcohol 
was not included as a component of the score. Individuals with red meat intake below the 
sex-specific median received one point and zero points otherwise. For each of the other 
components, those consuming above the sex-specific median received one point and zero 
points otherwise. The sum of these scores and the microgram amount of vitamin B12 intake 
from food were used as covariates in the multinomial regression model.
To address bias that may result from including individuals with poor health, we repeated 
these analyses excluding those who reported being in “worse” health compared to others the 
same age; thus, restricting the sample to those individuals reporting “better” or “the same” 
perceived health as their peers at baseline (N=1,284). Measures of cognitive function were 
not available prior to the 1988–1992 visit, therefore we were unable to identify existing 
cases of cognitive impairment at baseline. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our analysis 
excluding participants above the median age of 74 years at baseline assuming they were at 
higher risk of cognitive impairment than younger participants. We also performed a 
sensitivity analysis limited to non-smokers only.
A P value below 0.05 (2-sided test) was considered statistically significant. All analyses 
were carried out using SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Population characteristics
Baseline demographic and health characteristics of participants at the 1984–1987 visit 
according to amount of alcohol consumption are shown in Table 1. Most participants 
consumed some alcohol; only 157 (12%) were non-drinkers. Of these, only 28 (2.1%) were 
lifetime abstainers. Overall, 653 participants (49%) were moderate drinkers, 486 (36%) were 
heavy drinkers and 61 (5%) reported excessive levels of drinking. Men reported more 
alcohol consumption than women (54.5% heavy drinkers vs 45.5% for women; P<0.001). 
Excessive drinkers were younger than other groups (mean ± SD=67.4 ± 6.5 vs 71.8 ± 6.7 
years for non-drinkers; P<0.001). Heavy and excessive drinkers were more likely to have

 attended college (74.6% and 80.3% vs 68.2% for non-drinkers; P=0.004) and to be current 
smokers (17.3% and 32.8% vs 8.9% for non-drinkers; P<0.001). Individuals who reported 
heavy drinking also exercised more frequently (87.3% exercised ≥3 times/week vs 79% for 
non-drinkers; P=0.006). Moderate drinkers were the least likely to be married (76.2% vs 
80.9% for non-drinkers; P=0.007). Mean triglyceride levels were lowest in the heavy 
drinking group (mean ± SD=110.5 ± 64.9 vs 128.4 ± 80.7 for non-drinkers; P=0.007). 
Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were highest among 
excessive drinkers (mean ± SD=33.0 ± 25.5 and 24.2 ± 18.1 vs 28.8 ± 22.2 and 20.3 ± 14.7 
in non-drinkers; all P’s <0.05). Number of comorbidities and frequency of cardiovascular 
disease and stroke decreased with increasing levels of alcohol intake (all P’s for trend <0.05). 
Non-drinkers were more likely to report being in poorer health than drinkers (14% vs 2.3% 
in heavy drinkers; P<0.001). Waist-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure, HDL-C, and gamma-
glutamyl transferase increased with increasing levels of alcohol consumption (all P’s for trend 
<0.05). There were no significant differences in history of diabetes, hypertension, liver 
disease, transient ischemic attack, cancer, depression, APOE ε4 allele frequency, body mass 
index, or CRP by amount of alcohol consumed.
Table 2 shows baseline characteristics of the study sample by frequency of alcohol intake. 
Near-daily drinking was reported by almost half (48%) of study participants. Compared to 
men, women were more likely to be nondrinkers and to drink less frequently (59.2% non-
drinkers for women vs 40.8% non-drinkers for men; P<0.001). Drinking frequency did not 
differ by age. Current smoking was more frequent in near-daily drinkers (17.4% vs 8.2% for 
non-drinkers; P<0.001). Infrequent drinkers were the least likely to be married or to have 
some college education (74.4% and 61.2% vs 80.9% and 68.2% for non-drinkers; all P’s 
≤0.01). Non-drinkers had the highest number of medications at baseline (mean ± SD=1.2 
± 1.3 vs 1.0 ± 1.1 for near-daily drinkers; P=0.02). Triglyceride and CRP levels (mean ± 
SD=113.0 ± 64.5 and 2.7 ± 2.7 for near-daily drinkers vs 128.4 ± 36.0 and 3.1 ± 3.4 for non-
drinkers) and the proportion of individuals with diabetes (12.7% in near-daily drinkers vs 
19.1% in non-drinkers) were significantly lower with increased drinking frequency (all P’s 
<0.05). Waist-hip ratio, HDL-C, and gamma-glutamyl transferase increased linearly with 
drinking frequency (all P’s for trend <0.001). Exercise frequency, history of cardiovascular 
disease, liver disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cancer, Beck Depression 
Inventory score, APOE ε4 carrier status, body mass index, aspartate aminotransferase, and 
alanine aminotransferase levels did not significantly differ by frequency of alcohol 
consumption.
Cognitively healthy longevity by amount of alcohol intake
Over an average of 14.2 ± 7.8 years of follow-up (median=13.9 years), 353 (26%) 
individuals were classified as CHL, 445 (33%) as CIL and 546 (41%) died before reaching 
age 85. Amount of alcohol intake was associated with greater odds of CHL compared to CIL 
or death before age 85 (Table 3). We found a curvilinear association between the amount of 
alcohol intake and CHL (P<0.03 for quadratic terms). The multivariate adjusted odds of 
CHL compared to CIL was approximately twice as high in moderate and heavy drinkers 
compared to non-drinkers (odds ratio (OR) =1.90, 95%CI: 1.13, 3.20 and OR=2.05, 95%CI: 
1.19, 3.93). Though not significant, the adjusted odds of CHL compared to CIL was also

 higher (OR=1.54, 95%CI: 0.62, 3.78) in excessive drinkers compared to non-drinkers. The 
likelihood of CHL compared to death before age 85 increased with the level of alcohol 
intake from moderate (OR=2.41, 95%CI: 1.44, 4.03) to heavy drinkers (OR=2.88, 95%CI: 
1.69, 4.91) and was also higher in excessive drinkers (OR=2.61, 95%CI: 1.08, 6.28) 
compared to non-drinkers. There were no significant interactions between sex or APOE ε4 
carrier status and amount of alcohol intake on the odds of CHL (Pinteraction ≥0.05).
Adjustment for Mediterranean diet and vitamin B12 did not change the results (not shown). 
The odds of CHL also remained significantly higher among moderate and heavy drinkers 
compared to nondrinkers when limited to those reporting “better” or “the same” health 
compared to others their age (not shown). The positive associations between amount of 
alcohol intake and cognitively healthy longevity were not diminished when we restricted 
analysis to non-smokers only (not shown). When analysis was limited to those participants 
below the median age, the odds ratios were slightly attenuated however the odds of CHEL 
remained highest among heavy drinkers relative to non-drinkers (not shown).
Cognitively healthy longevity and frequency of alcohol intake
The adjusted odds of CHL compared to death before age 85 and CIL increased linearly with 
frequency of alcohol consumption (P=0.03 and <0.001, respectively; Table 4). After 
adjusting for covariates, near-daily alcohol intake was associated with a more than 3-fold 
increase in the odds of CHL compared to death (OR=3.24, 95%CI: 1.92, 5.46). Compared to 
nondrinkers, those with near-daily intake of alcohol had the highest odds of CHL compared 
to CIL (OR=2.06, 95%CI: 1.21, 3.49). The quadratic term for frequency of alcohol intake 
did not significantly add to the model. No significant interactions were detected between sex 
or APOE genotype and frequency of alcohol intake on odds of CHL (Pinteraction ≥0.05). 
Results were similar after adjustment for diet and vitamin B12 (not shown). Near-daily 
drinking retained its significant protective association with CHL when analysis was 
restricted to those reporting “better” or “the same” health compared to others their age (not 
shown). Sensitivity analysis limited to non-smokers revealed a similar trend (not shown). 
The odds of CHEL remained significantly higher in near-daily drinkers compared to non-
drinkers but associations were slightly attenuated in the subset of participants below the 
median age only (not shown).
Non-participant Characteristics
Cognitive function data was unavailable for 584 subjects (30% of age-eligible subjects). 
Compared to participants included in the analysis, these non-participants were slightly older 
(71.7 vs 72.7, respectively; P=0.005) and more likely to be female (54% vs 62%, 
respectively; P=0.003). The proportion of non-drinkers did not differ (10% vs 12%; P=0.38), 
but among those who did drink, non-participants reported lower average weekly alcohol 
intake (73 vs 93 grams/week; P<0.001) and were less likely to drink on a near-daily basis 
(45% vs 54%; P<0.001).
Former drinkers versus lifetime abstainers
Compared to lifetime abstainers (n=28), former drinkers (n=129) were significantly more 
likely to be past (14% vs 33%, respectively) or current smokers (0% vs 11%, respectively;

 P=0.01). Women made up 71% of the lifetime abstainers and 56% of the former drinkers 
(P=0.15 for sex differences). Though not significant, lifetime abstainers had higher exercise 
frequency (89% vs 77% exercised 3 or more times/week; P=0.14) and were more likely to 
have attended some college (79% vs 66%; P=0.19) compared to former drinkers. Lifetime 
abstainers and former drinkers were similar with regards to the number of comorbidities 
(mean ± SD= 1.8 ± 1.2 vs 1.9 ± 1.3, respectively; P=0.67) and number of medications (mean 
± SD= 1.1 ± 1.3 vs 1.2 ± 1.3, respectively; P=0.70).
DISCUSSION
In this study of 1,344 community-dwelling older adults, we found significant associations 
between amount and frequency of alcohol intake and cognitively healthy longevity. 
Moderate and heavy drinkers (up to 3 drinks/day for women and for men 65 years and older, 
up to 4 drinks/day for men under 65 years) had 2-fold higher odds of living to age 85 
without cognitive impairment relative to non-drinkers. Individuals who drank on a near-daily 
basis were also more likely to live to age 85 without cognitive impairment than those who 
drank less frequently or did not drink at all. These associations remained significant after 
adjustment for numerous lifestyle and health characteristics.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association of the amount and 
frequency of alcohol consumption with cognitively healthy longevity versus being 
cognitively impaired in later life or dying before age 85. Our results are in accord with the 
existing body of literature that supports a U-shaped or J-shaped association between alcohol 
consumption and mortality [3–5]. Our results are also in agreement with previous reports 
that suggest lower risk of cognitive impairment among moderate drinkers than non-drinkers 
[7,8,34,35]. A meta-analyses of 74 studies [34] reported an RR of 0.77 for cognitive 
impairment in moderate drinkers compared to nondrinkers with an increased risk of 
cognitive impairment in excessive drinkers. While our study did not find a higher likelihood 
of cognitive impairment in advanced age in excessive drinkers, very few participants in our 
cohort reported drinking to excess.
Prior investigations used alternative approaches to study associations with healthy longevity 
in women. Our findings are in accord with those of a recent study from the Women’s Health 
Initiative Memory Study [36] designed to identify predictors of preserved cognitive function 
in women age 80 or older. That study reported a significant association between moderate 
alcohol intake and preserved cognition. Similarly, results from the Nurses’ Health Study, 
showed an association between moderate, regular alcohol consumption at midlife and 
successful ageing defined as living to age 70 without physical or cognitive impairment [37]. 
Although our outcome differs from these previous studies, they are all in agreement 
concerning the potential benefits of alcohol consumption for healthy ageing. Our study 
extends these findings to men and to a longer cognitive healthspan. We found no significant 
variation in the association between alcohol intake and cognitively healthy longevity 
according to sex.
Our results are in contrast to those of a population study in Norway that found that frequent 
drinking was associated with increased dementia risk compared to non-frequent drinking

 [11]. However, in that study, frequent drinkers were defined as those consuming five or more 
drinks in a 14-day period and comprised only 6.5% of the population, a drinking pattern 
very different than that observed in our cohort. Furthermore, no information was provided 
on whether alcohol intake was spread across the 14-day period or concentrated in a few days 
(e.g. weekends), and, as our results show, frequency of drinking affects the association of 
alcohol with cognitive function.
Potential biological mechanisms for a beneficial effect of moderate alcohol intake on 
cardiovascular health have been extensively investigated [38]. However, the exact 
mechanisms by which alcohol may provide neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. 
Effects may be mediated through increased HDL and anti-oxidant activity and decreased 
LDL, fibrinogen and platelet activity, slowing the formation of amyloid plaques and 
preserving optimal vascular function in the brain [39]. In the RBS, moderate and heavy 
drinkers and those reporting near-daily drinking had a more favorable cardiovascular profile 
including higher HDL-C and lower triglyceride levels than non-drinkers. Alcohol also 
stimulates acetylcholine release in the hippocampus, positively affecting learning and 
memory [40]. The influence of moderate alcohol intake on psychosocial factors such as 
stress and depression, which may also impact cognitive function, merits further study [41].
As we have noted previously [19, 42] the prevalence of any alcohol use in this study 
population is higher (88%) than that in the general U.S. population (46% of older adults 
aged 55 years and older according to the 1990 National Health Interview Survey [43]). The 
demographic profile of the RBS cohort, which is predominantly white and middle-class with 
some college education, may contribute to this difference. U.S. population surveys have 
shown that the proportion of drinkers increases with income and education level, and that 
whites are more likely to drink than individuals from other ethnic groups [44, 45]. These 
differences between the RBS cohort and general U.S. population may limit generalizability, 
but the homogeneity of the cohort increases the internal validity of our results by reducing 
potential confounding by these factors.
There are a number of other limitations to this study. We examined alcohol consumption at 
only one time point, however drinking patterns within this cohort remain relatively stable 
over time [19]. As in the majority of alcohol-related studies, we used self-report to assess 
alcohol intake. This may underestimate actual amount consumed. However, this is unlikely 
to affect the rank-order of exposure categories and would introduce a conservative bias 
leading to underestimation of the association. Additionally, RBS self-reported alcohol intake 
correlated with values obtained from interviews conducted by trained dietitians [46] and 
corresponded to indirect markers of alcohol intake including aspartate aminotransferase, 
alanine aminotransferase, HDL-C and gamma-glutamyl transferase [46–49].
The reference group was composed of lifetime abstainers and former drinkers, raising the 
possibility of reverse causation by including individuals who may have stopped drinking due 
to poor health (i.e. “sick quitters”). However, adjustment for health-related variables 
including the number of medications and comorbidities did not attenuate the association. 
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis limited to individuals reporting “better” or “the same” 
health as others their age yielded similar findings. This is consistent with a meta-analysis of

 19 studies that excluded “sick quitters” from the reference category and found that the 
significant beneficial association of alcohol consumption remained [34].
We had no assessments of cognitive function at or prior to the assessment of alcohol intake. 
Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of reverse causation that may have resulted if 
pre-existing cognitive impairment led to a decrease in drinking. However, we believe this 
was unlikely as alcohol intake was measured approximately 4 years before the first cognitive 
exam, and cognitively impaired individuals are less likely to attend follow-up visits. As a 
sensitivity analysis, we excluded individuals above the median age of 74 years at baseline, 
because they are at higher risk of cognitive impairment than younger participants. Although 
odds ratios were attenuated, the associations did not change direction.
Although the MMSE has high sensitivity for detecting dementia [50], we did not have a 
neurological exam to corroborate the existence of cognitive impairment. Additionally, 
cognitive test scores may fluctuate over time, and it is possible that some individuals who 
did not meet criteria for impairment at age 85 or older, may have scored below the MMSE 
threshold on a prior assessment. As this misclassification was likely not associated with 
alcohol use and therefore non-differential with regards to exposure, results may have been 
biased to the null.
There were several strengths to our study. The extensive data collected on this cohort 
allowed for control of many potential confounders such as education, diet, smoking and 
physical activity. Further, we addressed the heterogeneity of alcohol metabolism between 
men and women by using sex-specific cutoffs when defining exposure categories for the 
amounts of alcohol consumed. Finally, we considered the effects of both amount and 
frequency of alcohol consumption in the analysis.
In conclusion, this study found a positive association between moderate alcohol intake and 
cognitively healthy longevity, an association that was greatest in individuals with a regular, 
moderate drinking pattern. In the United States, alcohol use contributes to 88,000 deaths 
annually and has a substantial number of additional adverse health, economic, and societal 
consequences [51]. For these reasons, it is not appropriate to recommend that abstainers 
initiate drinking. However, among those who choose to consume alcohol, regular, moderate 
drinking may play a role in promoting cognitively healthy longevity.
