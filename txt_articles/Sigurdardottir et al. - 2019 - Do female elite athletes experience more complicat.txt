 ABSTRACT 
 
 Objective. Previous studies have suggested that female athletes might be at higher risk of 
experiencing complications such as caesarean sections and perineal tears during labour than 
non-athletes. Our aims were to study delivery outcomes, including emergency caesarean 
section rates, length of  1st and 2nd stage of labour and severe perineal tears, in first-time 
pregnant elite athletes compared to non-athletes. 
Methods. Retrospective case-control study comparing birth outcomes of primiparous female 
elite athletes engaging in high and low impact sports compared to non-athletic controls. The 
athletes had prior to birth competed at national team level or equivalent. 
 Participant characteristics and frequency of training for at least three years before a first 
pregnancy were collected via self-administered questionnaire. Information of delivery 
outcome was retrieved from the Icelandic Medical Birth Registry. 
Results. In all 248 participated, 118 controls, 41 low- and 89 high impact elite athletes. No 
significant differences were found between the groups regarding incidence of emergency 
caesarean section or length of 1st and  2nd stage of labour. The incidence of 3rd-4th degree 
perineal tears was significantly higher (23.7%) among low impact athletes than in the high 
impact group (5.1%, p=0.01), but no significant differences were seen when the athletes were 
compared to controls (12%, p=0.09 for low impact and p=0.12 for high impact athletes).    
Conclusion. 
Participation in competitive sports at elite level was not related to adverse delivery outcome  
including length of labour, the need for caesarean section during delivery and severe perineal 
tears.

 INTRODUCTION 
Current guidelines encourage pregnant women to participate in aerobic and other 
strengthening exercises as well as to practice specific strength-training of the pelvic floor 
muscles (PFMT).1 2 3 Previous studies have suggested that participation in high impact, high 
intensity sports might lead to hypertrophy of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) to the extent of 
causing obstruction for the passing fetus and thus prolonging the 2nd stage of labour 4 5. Based 
on this it can been hypothesized that hypertrophied PFMs could be associated with adverse 
outcomes in labour, such as severe perineal tears (3rd-4th degree) and failure to progress in 
labour resulting in higher rates of emergency caesarean sections (CS). However, the 
International Olympic Committee (IOC) expert group has revealed a significant lack of high 
quality evidence specific to pregnant elite athletes and the impact of strenuous exercise 
during pregnancy on labour and childbirth.6  
Sports activities are usually divided into those involving high impact, defined as activities 
where both feet are above the floor (running and jumping) such as in ball games, running or 
gymnastics, or low impact (one or both feet are on the ground all the time) such as golf, 
cross-country skiing, weight lifting or swimming (with minimal gravitational influence).7 
Participation in high and low impact sports could thus have a different influence on labour 
and birth outcomes. In an IOC review article, Bø et al specifically highlighted the need for 
research on the prevalence of, and risk factors for, maternal and perinatal outcomes in elite 
athletes and how these compare with estimates for the general population. Prolonged labour, 
emergency CS and severe perineal tears (3rd-4th degree) were specifically mentioned as 
important variables for assessing this claim.8  
The aims of the present study were to compare the incidence of emergency CS, 3rd- 4th degree 
perineal tears and length of the 1st and 2nd stage of labour between elite athletes who 
participated in either high or low impact sports using as a control group women who were 
 only physically active at a recreational level. Furthermore, we aimed to study the association 
between delivery outcome and exercise training frequency before and during the first 
pregnancy in elite athletes.  
 
METHODS 
Design 
This was a retrospective case-control study comparing data from before and during first 
pregnancy and childbirth of two groups of female elite athletes and one female non-athletic 
group. 
Participants and data collection  
Data were collected over one-year period from November 2015 to 2016. We identified elite 
athletes through Icelandic sports federations and public/social media. The athletes accepting 
to participate helped in recruiting more eligible athletes and women to form the non-athletic 
control group. Requests for participants were also mediated through social media. The elite 
athletes were grouped by low and high impact sports.7 
All the athletes had competed in the highest division possible or were professional athletes 
(like ballroom dancers) in their sport or at national team level (58% in national teams) for at 
least three years before their first pregnancy.  With regard to CrossFit, which is not included 
as an Olympic sport,9 most of the participants had competed in international tournaments. 
Participants in the non-athletic group did not compete in sports and had only been physically 
active at a recreational level before and during their first pregnancy.  
Inclusion criteria for the study were a healthy mother, singleton first pregnancy, able to 
understand Icelandic or English, while all women with high risk pregnancy, such as 
gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia or multiple pregnancy were excluded.  
 Participants were initially contacted by telephone and subsequently sent information about 
the study through e-mail. Ethical approval was obtained from Icelandic National Bioethics 
Committee (Ref: VSN-13-189), and the Data Protection Authority granted permission as well 
(Ref: 2014030475TS/--). The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki 
declaration on human experimentation. 
Questionnaire 
All participants answered an electronic questionnaire regarding background and type of sport 
if any, frequency of training (hours/week), both specific sports training and/or other regular 
training classified as strength, endurance and/or flexibility training, number of years in the 
highest division possible and/or in the national team before and during their first pregnancy.  
Outcome assessment 
Information on pregnancy outcomes were extracted from the Icelandic Medical Birth 
Registry. Participants´ maternity record details were retrieved electronically and included 
maternal age in years, height in cm, weight in kg and body mass index as kg/m2 (BMI) at the 
first antenatal visit, mode of delivery, duration of 1st and 2nd stages of labour in minutes, 
degree of perineal tears, use of episiotomy, anaesthesia/epidural, birthweight in g, length and 
newborn head circumference in cm. In some cases (n=11) the athletes had delivered their 
child while living abroad. In those cases, the women scanned and e-mailed their original 
medical birth records.  Emergency CS in Iceland is defined as a decision for CS taken within 
eight hours of the delivery time. 
Statistics 
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS, R and Stata software. Characteristics of study 
participants were described by frequencies and percentages for dichotomous outcomes. The 
median with 10th -90th percentiles was used to describe skewed continuous variables while 
the means and standard deviations (SD) were used to describe normally distributed variables.  
 Chi-squared test was used to compare delivery outcome for emergency caesarean section,  
3rd-4th degree perineal tears and Kruskal-Wallis for length of 1st and 2nd stages of labour for 
the three groups. Penalized multiple logistic regression analysis with the Firth small‐sample 
bias‐reduction method10 11 was applied to estimate the association with predictor variables 
and impact groups. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated 
for 3rd-4th degree perinal tears. Results from three models were presented: 1. Unadjusted, 2. 
Adjusted for maternal age, BMI and training frequency, 3. Model 2 with additional 
adjustment for birthweight. P-values  0.05 were considered significant. 
 
RESULTS  
Background information 
In all, 248 of the 293 women invited filled in and returned the questionnaire (84%) (Figure 1)  
Table 1 shows the characteristics of study participants. All groups were significantly different 
from each other regarding frequency of training (hours/week) before their first pregnancy, 
where the low impact group exercised more than the high impact group, - the non-athletic 
control group being least active. Training frequency and months of training during pregnancy 
were not different between the athletic groups, but lower in the non-athletic group. The non-
athletic women had significantly higher BMI than women in both athletic groups. 
Birthweight was significantly higher in the low impact group compared to the non-athletes. 
The low impact group had significantly longer time from childbirth to recruitment than both 
other groups.

Impact groups and delivery outcome 
There were three elective CS, one in each group. In the high impact group the indication was 
transverse lie and fibromyoma, in the low impact group fear of childbirth and in the control 
group breech presentation. For inter-group comparisons of delivery outcomes these women 
were omitted.  
Table 3 shows delivery outcome. The number of emergency CS was not statistically different 
between groups; 9, 2 and 10 for the non-athletes, low and high impact groups respectively 
(p=0.51). The length of 1st and 2nd stages of labour was not significantly different between 
groups either (p=71 and p=0.22 respectively). There were 98 missing values for 1st and 28 
missing values for 2nd stage of labour in the birth registry and this information could not be 
added when searched for in the actual maternity records.

 The incidence of 3rd-4th degree perineal tears was significantly higher (23.7%) among low 
impact athletes than the high impact group (5.1%, p=0.01) but when each athletic group was 
compared to controls (12%), neither group reached significance, i.e.  p=0.09 for low impact 
and p=0.12 for high impact athletes. Figure 2 shows the proportion of women with 3rd-4th 
degree tears by impact group. After adjusting for maternal age, BMI and training frequency 
high impact athletes still had lower risk of 3rd-4th degree tears compared to controls [OR 
(95%CI) 0.6; (0.1-2.5)], and the risk observed for low impact athletes was higher [OR 
(95%CI) 3.6 (0.8-17.1)] (Table 3). However, neither athletic group reached statistical 
significance when compared to controls. Adjustment for birthweight did not have an effect on 
the results. Penalized multiple logistic regression showed that frequency of exercise before 
and during pregnancy, maternal age and BMI had no significant association with any delivery 
outcome.

DISCUSSION 
We found no association between the length of 1st and 2nd stages of labour or a higher 
incidence of emergency CS and participation in high or low impact sports. Interestingly the 
high impact elite athletes had a lower incidence of 3rd-4th degree perineal tears than the low 
impact group. Participation in high impact sports seemed not to influence the incidence of 
severe perineal tears in a negative way. Frequency of exercise training itself before and 
during first pregnancy did not show relation to any subsequent delivery outcome. Regular, 
more frequent and high impact exercise during pregnancy has, however, been shown to 
reduce the need for emergency caesarean delivery in women having their first baby.12 
Our results regarding the length of 1st and 2nd stages of labour are in line with the analysis by 
the IOC expert committee. There is moderate evidence supporting that physical activity does 
not increase the length of labour and in our study this also applied to elite athletes.6 It was 
unfortunate that many values were missing in registration on the length of labour, particularly 
for the 1st stage of labour in our case, but these missing data were quite evenly distributed 
among the three groups.  
In this study we found no significant differences in emergency CS rates among the groups. 
The incidence was relatively low ranging from five to eleven percent of the total number of 
participants in the groups. It may therefore be assumed that participating in sports at elite 
level does not increase the risk for emergency CS. The IOC expert committee found that 
results from multiple studies regarding caesarean section rates and exercise were inconsistent 
and no studies on elite athletes were found.6 That the section rates in general are lowered 
 when women exercise was recently shown in a large Norwegian study12 and our results 
support that participating in sports at elite level does not increase the risk for emergency CS.  
Because the low impact group was smaller than the other two, comparisons become less 
precise regarding results for that group. This could explain the high incidence of 3rd-4th 
degree perineal tears (23.7%). In comparison the incidence among primiparas in Iceland for 
the years 2012-2016 was 6.6-7.2%.13 This smaller group of women requires further study, 
including 5 weightlifters and 5 horseback riders, sports that are of interest regarding their 
impact on the pelvic floor. Considering the sample size, our results must be interpreted with 
caution. Although most of the childbirths took place less than five years before the study, the 
time of first childbirth for some of the participants went back to the year 2000. Therefore, we 
had a risk of recall bias regarding exercise training. Exercise training frequency was self-
reported and not measured and this may make the data subject to overestimation.14 However, 
life of the elite athlete revolves around sport and competition and therefore it is not unlikely 
that most remember quite well how they exercised even many years back. Exercise training 
was only documented as frequency (hours/week) and we had no information on intensity. We 
do not know how fast the athletes ran or swam or how much weight they lifted. Despite this, 
the athletes were among the best in their sports in Iceland or even internationally and 
therefore we can infer that it is likely that they did exercise intensively.  
Limited information is available on this subject from other studies. Kruger et al5 concluded 
that participation in high impact sports might influence the properties of the pelvic floor to 
the extent to cause obstruction for the passing fetus without having actual delivery 
information from athletes. They hypothesized that repetitive jumping and landing could 
possibly increase the pelvic floor muscle mass. Our results did not confirm this hypothesis 
neither for the length of 2nd stage of labour or rate of severe perineal tears, both of which  
could be influenced by the pelvic floor strength. The high impact athletes in our study 
 seemed to have more favourable delivery outcomes regarding their pelvic floor than the 
control group, even though this did not reach statistical significance. In later article from 
2007, Kruger et al proposed, however, that emphasis would be placed on further studies on 
the properties of the PFM in elite athletes.4 A recent study of PFM strength in elite female 
athletes, almost entirely high impact compared to non-athletes, showed no significant 
difference in strength between the groups.15 In a small comparison study of female handball, 
volleyball, basketball payers and controls, it was found that volleyball and basketball players 
had significantly weaker PFM than the controls.16 It is not possible to infer that increased 
strength or volume of the PFM is associated with delivery outcome or that female athletes 
have stronger PFM than other women. According to Du et al PFMT during pregnancy was 
not found to have a negative influence on labour, - on the contrary specific PFMT reduced 
the length of the 1st and 2nd stages of labour.17 Similarly, Bø et al found that women who 
exercised regularly during pregnancy had a wider levator hiatus at 37 gestational weeks, 
which in turn may lead to easier birth.18 In the IOC review article no specific studies among 
elite athletes on the length of labour or regarding perienal tears were identified.6 The few 
studies on elite athletes have used cross-sectional and retrospective designs6 resulting in low 
to moderate levels of evidence. Our results must also be interpreted with that in mind.     
Strengths and limitations 
Strengths of the present study are the inclusion of a high number of elite athletes, the high 
response rate and use of a control group. Limitations were the retrospective design with a risk 
of recall bias and the differing number of participants between groups. Lack of significant 
results may also be due to the study being underpowered (type II error). Prospective studies 
on elite athletes are difficult to perform due to an infrequency of pregnancy in athletes 
competing at the national or international level at any given time and the geographic 
challenges of enrolling these women in prospective studies.  
  
CONCLUSION 
Participation in sports at elite level is not associated with higher rates of emergency caesarean 
section, prolonged 2nd stage of labour or 3rd-4th perineal tears. 
Prospective studies on elite female athletes regarding birth outcome would be desirable, but 
meanwhile summative evidence from retrospective design may add to our knowledge and 
guide further research.

What are the new findings? 
Frequency and type of exercise is not associated with complications in childbirth. 
Athletes participating in high impact sports do not experience more severe obstetric 
perineal tears than non-athletic women.  
Emergency caesarean section rates and length of 1st and 2nd stages of labour is not 
influenced by sports impact. 
 
How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future? 
Health care providers and coaches may explain to high impact athletes that childbirth is not 
likely to have more effect on their pelvic floor than other women. 
Caregivers and coaches around female athletes should encourage them to exercise their 
pelvic floor muscles during and after pregnancy.
