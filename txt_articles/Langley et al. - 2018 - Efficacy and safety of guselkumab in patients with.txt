Summary
Background Guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, has demon-
strated significant efficacy in phase III psoriasis trials.
Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with mod-
erate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab.
Methods In this phase III, randomized, double-blind study, 871 patients received
open-label ustekinumab (45 mg or 90 mg) at weeks 0 and 4. At week 16, 268
patients with an inadequate response to ustekinumab [Investigator’s Global
Assessment (IGA) ≥ 2] were randomized (double-blind) to guselkumab 100 mg
or to continue ustekinumab; 585 of 871 patients (67%) with IGA 0/1 at week
16 continued open-label ustekinumab. The primary end point was the number
of visits at which randomized patients achieved IGA 0/1 and at least a two-grade
improvement (from week 16) from week 28 to week 40. Improvement ≥ 90%
or 100% in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90/100) and Dermatology
Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 0/1 were also assessed.
Results The mean number of visits at which patients achieved IGA 0/1 and at least
a two-grade improvemen (week 28–40) was significantly greater in the guselku-
mab group vs. the randomized ustekinumab group (1�5 vs. 0�7; P < 0�001);
greater proportions of patients in the guselkumab group achieved IGA 0/1 and
at least a two-grade improvement at week 28 (31�1% vs. 14�3%; P = 0�001) and
week 52 (36�3% vs. 17�3%; P < 0�001). Greater proportions of patients treated
with guselkumab achieved PASI 90, PASI 100 and DLQI 0/1 at week 52. After
week 16, 64�4% of patients in the guselkumab group and 55�6% in the ustek-
inumab group had at least one adverse event (AE); infections were the most fre-
quent AE type. Overall, 6�7% (n = 9) of patients in the guselkumab group had at
least one serious AE compared with 4�5% (n = 6) for the ustekinumab group.
Conclusions Patients treated with ustekinumab who did not achieve an IGA of 0/1
by week 16 derived significant benefit from switching to guselkumab.

•
Guselkumab is a novel anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody and has demonstrated high
efficacy in patients with plaque psoriasis in two recent phase III trials.
What does this study add?
•
Guselkumab demonstrated greater efficacy compared with ustekinumab among
patients who failed to achieve an Investigator’s Global Assessment score of 0 or 1
with ustekinumab therapy.
•
The types of adverse events (AEs) with guselkumab and ustekinumab were similar,
with infections being the most common.
•
A slightly higher incidence of AEs was reported in the guselkumab group, primarily
driven by AEs of back pain, psoriatic arthropathy and mild injection site reactions.
Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease, with a
prevalence between 1�5% and 5% in many developed coun-
tries.1 Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of
moderate-to-severe psoriasis with biologics, initially targeting
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a. Subsequently, scientific data
suggested that interleukin (IL)-12-mediated T helper 1 (Th1)
cell and IL-23-mediated Th17 cell signalling pathways are
upregulated in psoriatic lesions.2,3 A rapidly growing body of
literature suggests that IL-23/IL-17 is the major pathway that
drives the chronic inflammation underlying psoriasis patho-
physiology.2–5
Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody, modulates proinflam-
matory Th1 and Th17 pathways through the inhibition of IL-12
and IL-23. In phase III trials, patients treated with ustekinumab
had significantly greater improvements in psoriasis compared
with placebo, with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75
response rates of approximately 65–75% at week 12.6,7 Recent
studies with antibodies that selectively target a single cytokine
in this pathway, either IL-23 or IL-17, have demonstrated sig-
nificant reductions in psoriasis disease activity,8–13 with some
demonstrating superiority to ustekinumab.11,14
Guselkumab, a fully human IgG1k monoclonal antibody,
inhibits IL-23-specific intracellular and downstream signalling.
Guselkumab, administered every 8 weeks, demonstrated effi-
cacy in phase II15 and phase III8,12 studies, with improvement of
psoriasis symptoms and a safety profile similar to ustekinumab.
The efficacy observed in the phase II trial15 led us to hypothesize
that guselkumab might be effective in patients with an
inadequate response to ustekinumab. Therefore, in NAVIGATE,
we evaluated skin response rates in patients treated with guselk-
umab who previously had an inadequate response to ustek-
inumab. To address this question thoroughly, we employed
an enrichment study design with an open-label ustekinumab
run-in followed by randomization of primary nonresponders.
Patients and methods
Patients
Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) were eligible if they had a diagnosis
of moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis for ≥ 6 months, a
PASI score16 ≥ 12, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)
score17 ≥ 3, body surface area involvement ≥ 10% and were
candidates for phototherapy or systemic treatment for psoriasis.
Patients were ineligible if they had severe, progressive or
uncontrolled medical conditions or had a malignancy or his-
tory of malignancy within 5 years (with the exception of non-
melanoma skin cancer). Patients were excluded if they had a
history or symptoms of active tuberculosis (TB) or if they
tested positive for hepatitis B or seropositive for antibodies to
hepatitis C. Patients could not have received prior treatment
with guselkumab or ustekinumab, therapeutic agents targeted
to IL-12, IL-17 or IL-23 within 6 months of first administra-
tion of the study agent, anti-TNF therapy within 3 months or
five half-lives of first study agent administration, or any sys-
temic immunosuppressants or phototherapy within 4 weeks
of first administration of the study agent.
Trial design
NAVIGATE was a phase III, randomized, double-blind trial
conducted between October 2014 and May 2016 at 100 sites
in 10 countries. The study included a 16-week open-label per-
iod, a 28-week randomized active-treatment period, and a 16-
week follow-up period (Fig. 1). All patients received open-
label ustekinumab (45 mg for patients weighing ≤ 100 kg;
90 mg for patients weighing > 100 kg) at weeks 0 and 4. At
week 16, patients with an IGA ≥ 2 (i.e. inadequate response
to ustekinumab) were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg at
weeks 16, 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter, or to continue
ustekinumab at week 16 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Ran-
domization was performed using an interactive web response
system with patients stratified by baseline weight (≤ 100 kg
vs. > 100 kg) and study site. Placebo injections were adminis-
tered to maintain blinding. Patients with an IGA of 0 or 1
continued receiving open-label ustekinumab at week 16 and
every 12 weeks. Ustekinumab and guselkumab injections were
administered through week 40 and week 44, respectively.
Patients were followed up for efficacy through week 52 and
safety through week 60.

 protocol was approved by the investigational review board/
ethics committee at each site. All patients gave written
informed consent before any study-related procedures were
performed. The trial was registered with EudraCT (2014-
000721-20) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02203032).
Trial assessments
Clinical efficacy was evaluated using the IGA [cleared (0),
minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3) or severe (4)]17 and
PASI (scale of 0–72; higher scores indicating more severe dis-
ease). The primary end point was the number of visits at
which patients achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 and at least a
two-grade improvement relative to week 16 from week 28
through week 40, with a maximum of four visits, for ran-
domized patients [i.e. those with an inadequate response (IGA
≥ 2) to ustekinumab at week 16]. Major secondary end points
for randomized patients were the number of visits at which
patients achieved an IGA score of 0 from week 28 through
week 40, the number of visits at which patients achieved
≥ 90% improvement in PASI score16 (PASI 90) from week 28
through week 40, and the proportion of patients achieving an
IGA of 0 or 1 and at least a two-grade improvement relative
to week 16 at week 28. Patient-reported outcome assessments
included the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI),18 a der-
matology-specific instrument (scale 0–30) to assess overall
quality of life with higher scores indicating a greater effect
of disease on quality of life, and the Psoriasis Symptoms
and Signs Diary (PSSD),19 a self-administered questionnaire
(0–100) measuring the severity of psoriasis symptoms (itch,
pain, stinging, burning and skin tightness) and signs (skin
dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness and
bleeding) over the previous 7 days, with higher scores indi-
cating greater disease severity.
Patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs), vital signs
and clinical laboratory (chemistry and haematology) values,
through week 60. Serum samples were collected through
week 60, and a highly sensitive, drug-tolerant electrochemilu-
minescence immunoassay was used to assess the presence of
antibodies to guselkumab and antibodies to ustekinumab in
patients who received at least one administration of guselku-
mab or ustekinumab, respectively.
Statistical analyses
The primary and major secondary analyses were performed
for patients randomized at week 16. Data were analysed by
randomized treatment group. Patients who discontinued study
treatment owing to a lack of efficacy or an AE of worsening
of psoriasis were considered nonresponders from that point
onward, as were patients who started a protocol-prohibited
medication/therapy that could improve psoriasis. Missing data
for randomized patients were imputed as nonresponse for cat-
egorical variables. The primary and major secondary end
points in the randomized treatment groups were compared
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) row mean score
test for ordinal endpoints
and the CMH Chi-Square test for
binary
endpoints,

 power to detect a treatment difference between ustekinumab
and guselkumab for the primary end point at a significance
level of 0�05 (two-sided).
Safety analyses included all patients who received at least
one administration of study agent, and AEs were summarized
according to the actual treatment received.
Results
Trial population
A total of 872 patients were enrolled, and 871 received open-
label ustekinumab. Baseline demographics and disease charac-
teristics were generally similar in the randomized treatment
groups and the nonrandomized treatment group, with the
exception that a higher proportion of patients in the random-
ized groups received previous anti-TNF therapy (Table 1).
A total of 18 patients discontinued ustekinumab through
week 16 (Fig. 2). At week 16, 268 patients had an IGA score
≥ 2 and were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to
guselkumab 100 mg (n = 135) or ustekinumab (n = 133);
585 patients had an IGA score of 0 or 1 and continued open-
label
ustekinumab
(nonrandomized
group).
Among
the
randomized patients, 29 [guselkumab, n = 9 (6�7%); ustek-
inumab, n = 20 (15�0%)] discontinued the study agent from
week 16 to week 44. Overall, 17 patients (2�9%) who contin-
ued open-label ustekinumab discontinued treatment from
week 16 to week 40.
Clinical efficacy
During the open-label run-in, 68�5% of patients (589 of 860)
achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1, 73�7% achieved PASI 75 and
49% achieved PASI 90 at week 16.
Among randomized patients, the guselkumab group had a
significantly higher mean number of visits at which patients
had an IGA score of 0 or 1 and at least a two-grade improve-
ment relative to week 16 from week 28 through week 40
(primary end point) compared with the ustekinumab group
(1�5 vs. 0�7; P < 0�001) (Table 2). All major secondary end
points were also met. The mean number of visits at which
patients had a PASI 90 relative to baseline, between week 28
and week 40, was significantly higher in the guselkumab
group than in the randomized ustekinumab group (2�2 vs.
1�1; P < 0�001). The mean number of visits at which patients
had an IGA score of 0 between week 28 and week 40 was
significantly greater for patients in the guselkumab group
compared with the randomized ustekinumab group (0�9 vs.
0�4; P < 0�001). The proportion of patients with an IGA score
of 0 or 1 and at least a two-grade improvement relative to
week 16 at week 28 was significantly greater in the guselku-
mab group than in the randomized ustekinumab group
(31�1% vs. 14�3%; P = 0�001) (Table 2). Additionally, at
week 52, 36�3% of patients in the guselkumab group achieved
this response vs. 17�3% in the randomized ustekinumab group
(P < 0�001).
Among randomized patients, the mean PASI scores at week
16 were 9�8 in the guselkumab group and 10�6 in the ustek-
inumab group; at week 52, the mean decrease in PASI score
from week 16 was numerically greater in the guselkumab
group compared with ustekinumab (6�7 vs. 2�5). The propor-
tions of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and at least a
two-grade improvement relative to week 16 and the propor-
tions of patients achieving PASI 75/90/100 responses relative
to baseline were consistently numerically greater in the guselk-
umab group than in the randomized ustekinumab group from
week 20 through week 52 (Fig. 3). Response rates increased
in the guselkumab group from week 16, reaching a maximum
at week 36 (20 weeks postrandomization). Response rates in
the randomized ustekinumab group slightly increased from
week 16, reaching a plateau at week 32 with a periodic loss of
response every 12 weeks, which corresponds to the trough
time point of the every-12-week ustekinumab injections. IGA
and PASI responses in both groups were generally maintained
through week 52 (Fig. 3), with separation between the groups
occurring as early as week 20 (4 weeks postrandomization)
and increasing over time. At week 52, greater proportions of
patients treated with guselkumab achieved PASI 90 (51�1% vs.
24�1%; P < 0�001) and PASI 100 (20�0% vs. 7�5%; P = 0�003)
compared with the randomized ustekinumab group.
A total of 585 patients who had an IGA score of 0 or 1 at
week 16 continued open-label ustekinumab. At week 52,
81�1% of these patients maintained this response, with 42�6%
having an IGA score of 0. Nearly all patients (95�7%) in the
nonrandomized ustekinumab group had a PASI 75 at week
16, 69�7% had a PASI 90 and 27�2% had a PASI 100. These
levels of response were maintained through week 52.
Patient-reported outcome assessments
At week 16, 103 patients in the guselkumab group and 105
patients in the randomized ustekinumab group had a DLQI
score > 1 (Table 2). Of these patients, a significantly greater
proportion of patients in the guselkumab group had a DLQI
score of 0 or 1 at week 52 compared with the ustekinumab
group (38�8% vs. 19�0%; P = 0�002). The mean DLQI scores
at week 16 for all randomized patients were 7�5 and 6�8 in
the guselkumab and ustekinumab groups, respectively. At
week 52, the mean changes in DLQI from week 16 were
�3�8 in the guselkumab group and 0�3 in the ustekinumab
group. Among randomized patients who had a PSSD sign
score > 0 or a PSSD symptom score > 0 at week 16, signifi-
cantly greater proportions of patients treated with guselkumab
had a PSSD sign score of 0 or a symptom score of 0 at week
52 compared with the ustekinumab group (Table 2).
Adverse events in the open-label ustekinumab run-in
group (weeks 0–16)
Among the 871 enrolled patients who received at least one
administration of ustekinumab during the initial open-label
period, 254 patients (29�2%) experienced at least one AE

of active TB, major adverse cardiovascular events or deaths
occurred through week 16.
Adverse events in the randomized guselkumab and
ustekinumab groups (weeks 16–60)
In the two randomized groups, 64�4% of patients in the
guselkumab group and 55�6% of patients in the ustekinumab
group had at least one AE from week 16 through week 60
(Table 3). Infections were the most common AEs in both ran-
domized groups (guselkumab 41�5%; ustekinumab 35�3%).

118 Guselkumab in patients with psoriasis with inadequate response to ustekinumab, R.G. Langley et al.
 The higher overall rate of AEs in the guselkumab group
appeared to be related to a higher incidence of AEs reported
in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (guselku-
mab 12�6%; ustekinumab 6�8%), with higher proportions of
AEs reported for back pain and psoriatic arthropathy, and gen-
eral disorders and administration site conditions (guselkumab
11�9%; ustekinumab 1�5%), with the majority being injection
site reactions (all mild). However, no consistent patterns were
observed among these AEs.
In the randomized groups, SAEs were reported in nine
patients treated with guselkumab (6�7%) and six patients trea-
ted with ustekinumab (4�5%) (Table 3). One serious infection
occurred (bacterial arthritis in the guselkumab group). No
opportunistic infections or cases of active TB were reported.
Two malignancies were reported [transitional cell carcinoma
of the bladder and a fatal squamous cell carcinoma of the neck
(of origin unknown) in the guselkumab group]. Three
patients had a myocardial infarction (one female patient aged
69 years and one male patient aged 52 years in the guselku-
mab group and one male patient in the ustekinumab group
aged 66 years); all three patients had at least two known car-
diovascular risk factors. The patient with squamous cell carci-
noma of the neck discussed previously (a 66-year-old man)
was diagnosed just prior to the final (week 60) study visit and
died approximately 9 months later. Injection site reactions
were uncommon between week 16 and week 60; all were

 mild. There were no anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reac-
tions or AEs of Crohn disease.
Adverse events in the nonrandomized open-label
ustekinumab continuation group (weeks 16–60)
The most common AEs in the nonrandomized ustekinumab
group were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infec-
tions (Table 3).
Twenty patients (3�4%) had at least one SAE from week
16 to week 60. Five patients had a serious infection after
week 16 (appendicitis, epididymitis, periodontitis, paraspinal
abscess – each occurred in one patient; salpingitis and uri-
nary tract infection, both of which occurred in the same
patient); there were no opportunistic infections or cases of
active TB. The following four malignancies occurred: bile
duct cancer, fatal metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, basal cell
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. One
patient had a myocardial infarction; this patient had a history
of multiple known risk factors. One death occurred (the pre-
viously mentioned patient with metastatic pancreatic carci-
noma). Two injection site reactions occurred [two of 1734
injections (0�1%)], and none were severe. There were no
anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions or AEs of Crohn
disease.
Immunogenicity
Through week 60, 9�0% of patients (12 of 134) treated with
guselkumab and 14�7% of patients (125 of 853) treated with
ustekinumab tested positive for antibodies to guselkumab or
antibodies to ustekinumab, respectively.
Discussion
This controlled phase III study validates that guselkumab is
effective in treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis in patients
who did not achieve optimum clinical efficacy with ustek-
inumab. While ustekinumab is very effective in treating mod-
erate-to-severe psoriasis,6,7 as with any therapeutic agent, not
all patients reach the maximum response. Recent studies estab-
lished that guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively
targets IL-23, had substantial efficacy in adults with moderate-
to-severe psoriasis8,12,15 and may be more effective than
ustekinumab. Our results demonstrated that when patients
who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab were ran-
domized to guselkumab vs. continuing ustekinumab, guselku-
mab was superior across all end points measured, including
the mean number of visits between week 28 and week 40 at
which patients had an IGA of 0 or 1 and at least a two-grade
improvement relative to week 16, an IGA score of 0 (cleared),
and a PASI 90 response. Over time, guselkumab was also
superior in the proportions of patients achieving clinical effi-
cacy and patient-reported outcome end points through week
52. These results are significant considering that this popula-
tion had an inadequate response to ustekinumab, and our
findings provide dermatologists with an approach to switching
from ustekinumab to guselkumab.
This study employed an enrichment design of open-label
treatment followed by randomization,
which is a well-
accepted method,20 specifically to evaluate treatment response
in patients who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab.

120 Guselkumab in patients with psoriasis with inadequate response to ustekinumab, R.G. Langley et al.
 ustekinumab also continued to improve after week 16. The
ustekinumab dosage regimen evaluated in NAVIGATE was
consistent with the approved dosing regimen in most regions
worldwide; thus, dose escalation was not permitted. The study
utilized a relatively high level of efficacy to define ustek-
inumab responders (IGA 0/1, cleared or minimal), consistent
with patients’ desires for greater efficacy. Two types of end
points were employed, i.e. the number of visits at which
patients obtained a high degree of response and the propor-
tion of patients achieving high levels of PASI and IGA response
over time. The former assessed consistency of response at vis-
its across a prespecified period of time after switching treat-
ment and helps to address the differing peak and trough
concentrations of the two biologics resulting from their
respective administration regimens; the latter end points, pro-
portions of patients with IGA and PASI responses at specific
visits, are more intuitive and easily interpreted.
Regardless of the end points used, the number of visits at
which response was achieved or the proportion of patients
who achieved response over time, the outcomes consistently
showed greater efficacy with guselkumab. In the randomized
groups, PASI 75/90/100 response rates were greater in the

group,

Guselkumab in patients with psoriasis with inadequate response to ustekinumab, R.G. Langley et al. 121
 ustekinumab, with 50% of patients treated with guselkumab
reaching PASI 90 at week 52 compared with 24% of patients
treated with ustekinumab. Initial response with ustekinumab
was consistent with previous trials and response was generally
maintained during the open-label treatment period.
The safety profiles of guselkumab and ustekinumab were
generally consistent with previous studies. In the pivotal phase
III studies, there were comparable rates of AEs and SAEs
among guselkumab, placebo and adalimumab and between
ustekinumab and placebo.8,12,15,21 Notably, in this study, dur-
ing the randomized controlled period, the incidence of AEs
was slightly higher in the guselkumab group compared with
the randomized ustekinumab group, which was primarily due
to higher rates of AEs reported in musculoskeletal and connec-
tive tissue disorders (e.g. back pain and psoriatic arthropathy)
and general disorders and administration site conditions (e.g.
injection site reactions, with all injection site reactions being
mild). In both randomized groups, infections were the most
common type of AE, and the incidence of infections was simi-
lar between the two groups. One serious infection occurred in
the guselkumab group; no hypersensitivity reactions or AEs of
Crohn disease occurred in these groups. Few patients treated
with guselkumab had an injection site reaction, and all reac-
tions were considered mild. There were no signals with regard
to SAEs or hypersensitivity reactions when transitioning from
ustekinumab to guselkumab, despite employing a guselkumab
loading dose. The incidence of antibodies to guselkumab was
in line with those reported in the larger phase III VOYAGE 1
(5�3%)8 and VOYAGE 2 (6�6%)12 trials.
While an explanation for the superior efficacy of guselku-
mab compared with ustekinumab observed in this study is not
clear at present, potential reasons include the central role of
IL-23 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,2,3 a more potent block-
ade of IL-23 with guselkumab, more frequent and higher dos-
ing of guselkumab and/or enhanced Th17 responses in the
setting of the inhibition of IL-12.
Our
study
provides
valuable
information
to
clinicians
regarding transitioning from ustekinumab to guselkumab and
the subsequent efficacy and safety of switching without a
washout in a population of inadequate responders. Despite the
rigorous design of the study, there are several limitations. The
primary end point of this trial does not intuitively translate
into
clinical
response;
however,
it
is
supplemented
by
response rates using IGA and PASI (standard assessments in
dermatology trials). In addition, the primary end point cov-
ered a limited time period from week 28 to week 40. In this
trial, week 16 was selected to evaluate the adequacy of
response to ustekinumab treatment. A decision to administer a
third dose of ustekinumab is made at week 16, and this is
therefore a practical time point to consider a switch to a
potentially more effective treatment. While some patients may
not have reached maximum response to ustekinumab based
on the kinetics of response curves in this trial and others,6,7
the incremental improvement beyond week 16 with continued
ustekinumab treatment was modest and lower than the effi-
cacy increase observed for guselkumab in this patient popula-
tion at all assessment time points beyond week 16.
In conclusion, we demonstrated in a controlled enrichment
design study that switching to guselkumab is an effective strat-
egy in patients who fail to achieve a high level of response
with ustekinumab, and the transition was not associated with
additional safety concerns. These results will be useful to
