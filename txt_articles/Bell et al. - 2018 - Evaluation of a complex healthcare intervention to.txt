AbstrAct
Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of a complex 
intervention to improve referral and treatment of 
pregnant smokers in routine practice, and to assess the 
incremental costs to the National Health Service (NHS) 
per additional woman quitting smoking.
Design Interrupted time series analysis of routine data 
before and after introducing the intervention, within-
study economic evaluation.
setting Eight acute NHS hospital trusts and 12 local 
authority areas in North East England.
Participants 37 726 records of singleton delivery 
including 10 594 to mothers classified as smoking during 
pregnancy.
Interventions A package of measures implemented 
in trusts and smoking cessation services, aimed 
at increasing the proportion of pregnant smokers 
quitting during pregnancy, comprising skills training 
for healthcare and smoking cessation staff; universal 
carbon monoxide monitoring with routine opt-out 
referral for smoking cessation support; provision of 
carbon monoxide monitors and supporting materials; 
and an explicit referral pathway and follow-up protocol.
Main outcome measures Referrals to smoking 
cessation services; probability of quitting smoking 
during pregnancy; additional costs to health services; 
incremental cost per additional woman quitting.
results After introduction of the intervention, the 
referral rate increased more than twofold (incidence rate 
ratio=2.47, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.81) and the probability 
of quitting by delivery increased (adjusted OR=1.81, 
95% CI 1.54 to 2.12). The additional cost per delivery 
was £31 and the incremental cost per additional quit 
was £952; 31 pregnant women needed to be treated for 
each additional quitter.
conclusions The implementation of a system-wide 
complex healthcare intervention was associated with 
significant increase in rates of quitting by delivery.
IntrODuctIOn
Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is a 
global public health problem. In high-income coun-
tries smoking is a major cause of stillbirth1 2 and low 
birth weight.3 Interventions to promote smoking 
cessation during pregnancy are effective and 
cost-effective in improving pregnancy and other 
health outcomes.4–7 In the UK, national guidance 
recommends routine carbon monoxide (CO) moni-
toring at antenatal visits to identify smokers, and 
opt-out referral to smoking cessation support (The 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).8 
However, wide variations in rates of smoking at the 
time of delivery persist.9
The smoking at delivery rate in North East England 
is persistently higher than the national average, and 
prior to this study in 2012 was around 20%.9 We 
identified that implementation of national guidance 
varied between local maternity units. Availability of 
CO monitors, midwives’ doubts about the effective-
ness of offering smoking cessation interventions and 
concerns about damaging relationships with preg-
nant smokers were barriers to implementation.10 To 
address these issues, a complex intervention focused 
on improving implementation of national guidance 
was commissioned for the region via the tobacco 
control office for North East England (Fresh, www. 
freshne. 
com). The intervention focused on system-
atic implementation of routine biochemical vali-
dation and opt-out referral of pregnant smokers 
to smoking cessation services. T
wo recent studies 
of opt-out referral have reported contrasting find-
ings. One found an increase in referrals to smoking 
cessation services but no impact on quit rates.11 The 
second, in a single hospital trust using a similar inter-
vention to this study, found a doubling of referrals 
and of 4-week quit rates.12
We aimed to evaluate the effect of the introduc-
tion of this intervention across a regional health 
system on quit rates, and to estimate the associated 
costs.
MethODs
Design and study population
We conducted an interrupted time series analysis 
of longitudinal data collected before and after 
introducing the intervention across North East 
England, within eight National Health Service 
(NHS) hospital trusts providing maternity services 
and 12 local authorities commissioning smoking 
cessation services. We analysed the pathway from 
identification of smoking at first antenatal visit, 
through referral to smoking cessation services, 
quitting during pregnancy and subsequent birth 
outcomes before and after the introduction of the 
intervention.

Intervention
BabyClear is a complex intervention,13 developed by the Tobacco 
Control Collaborating Centre, part of Improving Performance in 
Practice. It comprises a package of measures designed to support 
the implementation of national guidance (figure 1; appendix 
1). In England, responsibility for commissioning smoking cessa-
tion services lies with local authorities, while responsibility 
for commissioning maternity services lies with NHS England. 
Antenatal care is delivered by NHS trusts but smoking cessa-
tion services may be delivered by a range of community-based 
providers. The intervention was designed to strengthen links 
between these two services. Skills training was provided for 
maternity staff, smoking cessation advisors and administrators 
within smoking cessation services. Midwives were trained to 
implement universal CO monitoring at first antenatal appoint-
ment, with routine opt-out referral for smoking cessation advice 
for any woman with a CO recording above four parts per million 
(ppm).14 Communication skills, including approaches to intro-
duce CO monitoring to women, were developed during training. 
CO monitors and referral forms were provided to all partici-
pating trusts, and an explicit referral pathway and follow-up 
protocol for smoking cessation services were introduced. The 
intervention was not developed with an explicit theoretical 
underpinning, but incorporated recognised behaviour change 
techniques15 and was felt to address the needs identified by 
our previous work.10 The core intervention, comprising skills

training, supporting materials and referral pathway, was intro-
duced between November 2012 and July 2013. The full baby-
Clear package included an additional enhanced ‘risk perception’ 
intervention delivered at first trimester ultrasound scan appoint-
ment, but implementation of this component was delayed and 
we do not evaluate its impact here. A parallel process evaluation 
was conducted and is reported elsewhere.
Data sources
We obtained electronic records of deliveries from trusts, 
encompassing a pre-intervention and post-intervention period 
with at least 4 months of data post-intervention for each 
trust. Data on referrals and quit attempts were obtained from 
smoking cessation services and linked to delivery data using 
maternal NHS number where available, or by mothers’ date of 
birth and postcode. Once matched, records were anonymised 
and combined into a single database, and multiple pregnancies 
were excluded. Clinical and demographic variables obtained 
from maternity records included birth weight, gestation at 
delivery, infant sex, outcome of pregnancy, smoking status of 
mother at booking and delivery, maternal height, weight and 
body mass index, maternal ethnic group, maternal age and 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD, an area-based measure 
assigned using maternal postcode). 16 Data requested from 
smoking cessation services included referral dates, appoint-
ments, quit dates and quit status at 4 weeks. Our data there-
fore described demographic details of mothers, smoking status 
during pregnancy and at delivery, engagement with smoking 
cessation services and outcomes before and after the introduc-
tion of the intervention.
Patient involvement
We used routine data sources for this evaluation. Patients were 
not involved in the design or conduct of the study.
Variable definitions
We classified maternal smoking status during pregnancy on the 
basis of variables from maternity units or smoking cessation 
services which indicated smoking at any time during pregnancy 
(appendix 2). Smoking status at delivery was defined using 
routinely collected data from maternity units, definition and 
collection of which is mandated by the Department of Health.9 
Quitting during pregnancy was defined as any mother classified 
as smoking during pregnancy but recorded as a non-smoker 
at delivery. All other women were classified as non-smokers 
throughout pregnancy.
The start of the intervention was defined as the month during 
which the initial midwives’ training session was delivered in each 
trust. We classified deliveries as ‘before intervention’ or ‘after 
intervention’ depending on when the pregnancy reached 11 
weeks’ calculated gestation.
Referral for smoking cessation advice was defined as a 
delivery with any of the following recorded: date of referral; 
being sent information or contacted by a smoking cessation 
service; an appointment booked or attended with the smoking 
cessation service; a record of a quit date being set; or any record 
of smoking status recorded for ‘quit at 4 weeks’. We created 
monthly counts of referrals to assess referral rates over time.
We collated information on how the intervention was imple-
mented in each trust as part of a parallel process evaluation and 
created variables to describe the intervention. The variables were 
dates (month) of additional training sessions for midwives who 
had missed the initial training and enhanced arrangements for 
initial contact with smokers.
The range of IMD scores within the cohort were categorised 
into five groups based on internal quintiles. The first quintile 
represented the least deprived 20% of scores within the cohort 
(IMD 0–16). The central quintiles (range of scores 17–64) were 
grouped together; the final quintile included the most deprived 
20% of scores (65–80). The groups were restructured as ordinal 
variables 1–3 within the final model.
statistical analysis
We created a complete case dataset for use in the analyses. We 
modelled two outcomes that we hypothesised would be influ-
enced by the intervention: (1) change in the monthly referrals 
to smoking cessation service per trust and (2) change in indi-
vidual maternal quit rates; within the whole cohort, we investi-
gated the impact of quitting during pregnancy on birth weight 
(appendix 2).
We used a mixed-effects modelling approach to investigate how 
the intervention impacted on the monthly referral rate (model 1). 
We hypothesised that there would be variation between trusts, 
specifically in relation to the initial level of recorded referral 
rates, and so modelled trust as a random intercept and compared 
it with a simpler linear model without random effects. A categor-
ical variable was used to compare referral rates pre-intervention 
and post-intervention. We included time since the introduction 
of the intervention in each trust (continuous variable) as a proxy 
for changes that might have arisen through changes in efficiency 
as implementation progressed. We also estimated the effect of 
the initial 4 months since the intervention (categorical vari-
able). To control for potential variation in baseline referral rates 
through time for each trust, we included random effects within 
the model that incorporated a random intercept and slope. This 
allowed the model to estimate the deviation in overall referral 
rate for each trust (captured by the random intercept) while also 
accepting that referral rates achieved by individual trusts also 
varied through time (random slope).
The effect of variation between trusts with regard to service 
provision was also examined. Variables describing the initial 
contact with smokers, and additional training in any given 
month, were included. We used a stepwise reduction approach 
to identify the most parsimonious model at each stage and anal-
ysed the error.
We investigated the effects of the intervention on the prob-
ability that an individual mother would quit smoking before 
delivery in a similar way, using a logistic regression mixed-ef-
fects modelling approach with random intercept for trust (model 
2). We used quitting as a binary response variable (yes/no) for 
individual pregnancies. We adjusted for maternal ethnicity, age, 
parity and deprivation.
We investigated the effects of quitting on birth weight in the 
whole cohort, using linear mixed-effects models with trust as 
random effect (model 3), with the same set of maternal demo-
graphic covariates used in model 2. We did not use intervention 
status as a covariate in this model. We investigated the effects of 
quitting and smoking on birth weight as a continuous outcome.
All analyses were undertaken in R17 using the Linear and 
Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models statistical package.18
economic analysis
We estimated the additional cost to the NHS over a 5-year time 
horizon. Costs included those for training of staff, investment in 
equipment and consumables and changes in workload, and were 
costed using routine sources. Costs are presented as an average 
for the participating trusts and are reported in UK pounds

sterling (£) for 2013. Data on the mean number of pregnan-
cies and the number of additional quitters per trust were calcu-
lated by combining data on the average quit rate per trust before 
implementation, combined with the estimated adjusted OR 
(aOR) for quitting after implementation and data on smoking 
prevalence in the entire cohort. These data were combined with 
costs to produce the incremental cost, and numbers needed to 
treat, per additional quit (appendix 3).
results
study population
There were 37 
726 records of singleton delivery across the 
eight trusts. T
wenty eight per cent of mothers were classified 
as smokers. Table 1 shows the characteristics of smokers and 
non-smokers within the cohort.
Model 1: effect of the intervention on referrals
The referral rate increased progressively in all trusts in the first 
3 months after the intervention was introduced (figure 2). The 
intervention was associated with a significant increase in referrals 
(incidence rate ratio, IRR=2.47, 95% CI: 2.16 to 2.81), beyond 
the fourth month following introduction (table 2). Inclusion of a 
random intercept for trust led to an improved model fit, indicating 
that there were differences in the baseline number of referrals 
across trusts (appendix 2). T
rust effects on referral rates varied inde-
pendently of intervention implementation (from IRR=1.29 
in trust 
D to IRR=6.21 
in trust G; appendix 2). Additional training sessions 
were associated with an increase in referrals in the month of training 
(IRR=1.15, 95% 
CI 1.06 to 1.25), as was availability of a system for 
enhanced initial contact with smokers (IRR=6.2, 95% 
CI 3.18 to 
12.10 for early contact with smokers and IRR=1.78, 95% 
CI 1.12 
to 2.84 for trusts where midwives made appointment with smoking 
cessation services). The fitted values of the final model reflect the 
observed patterns in referrals rates.
Model 2: effect of the intervention on quitting during 
pregnancy
Introduction of the intervention was associated with a signifi-
cant increase in quitting by delivery (aOR=1.81, 95% 
CI 1.55 
to 2.12) (table 3). The odds of quitting were higher (aOR=3.23, 
95% 
CI 2.99 to 3.71) for deliveries with a recorded referral to 
smoking cessation services, and if there was a record of a quit date 
(aOR=4.18, 95% 
CI 3.53 to 4.94). The odds of quitting were 
significantly higher following additional training, (aOR=1.02, 
95% 
CI 1.002 to 1.03). Mothers resident in the most deprived 
areas were less likely to quit (aOR=0.52, 95% 
CI 0.42 to 0.65), as 
were younger mothers and those of white ethnicity.
Model 3: effect of quitting on birth weight
Babies born to women who did not smoke during pregnancy 
were significantly heavier than those born to women who smoked 
throughout pregnancy (+8.04%; 95% 
CI+7.54% to +8.54%), 
equivalent to an additional 260 g for a baby born at 40 weeks gesta-
tion (term) in reference categories (table 4). Babies born to women 
who quit smoking by delivery had a significantly higher birth weight 
(equivalent to an additional 210 g at 40 weeks) compared with those 
whose mothers continued smoking (+6.53%, 95% 
CI+5.83% 
to+7.24%). Quitters’ babies had birth weight similar to those of 
non-smokers (−1.39%, 95% 
CI −1.94% to −0.08%).

tion for a trust in the North East England over a 5-year period

over 5 years is estimated at 18 640 per trust, giving a cost per 
delivery of £30.69. The quit rate during pregnancy before the 
intervention was 0.0398 per delivery. Using the aOR for the 
effect of the intervention (aOR=1.81) gives a quit rate after 
intervention of 0.072 per delivery and an absolute difference 
in quit rate of 0.032. Thus, the incremental cost per additional 
quitter was £952 and the number needed to treat for each addi-
tional quitter was 31 pregnant women.
DIscussIOn
Principal findings
The introduction of a system-wide intervention to promote 
smoking cessation during pregnancy increased referrals to 
smoking cessation by 2.5 times and the proportion of women 
quitting by delivery by nearly twofold. Quitting smoking during 
pregnancy was associated with a clinically important increase in 
birth weight.

strengths and limitations
Our study included more than 35 
000 deliveries across a region 
which included eight acute hospital trusts and smoking cessa-
tion services commissioned by 12 local authorities. We evaluated 
the implementation of the intervention across these different 
organisations and localities, and showed a substantial increase 
in quit rates during pregnancy which is likely to have a clinically 
important effect on birth weight. The intervention was intro-
duced under conditions likely to be replicable in similar health 
systems with access to smoking cessation services with trained 
advisors. The intervention comprised a package of measures 
delivered across both maternity services and smoking cessation 
services. It was designed to be consistent with national guid-
ance,8 although the referral threshold for CO monitoring was 
lower (4 ppm vs 7ppm) in line with evidence published subse-
quently.14 In common with many healthcare interventions, it 
was not explicitly developed with an underpinning behavioural 
theory, but analysis of its components indicated that it incor-
porated a number of behaviour change techniques, including 
action planning, monitoring and provision of information.15 19 
Many of these addressed barriers to implementation identified 
in previous work.10 20 21
There were some limitations in our evaluation. We used 
routinely collected data from a number of different sources. 
Organisations collected different variables or defined variables 
differently, and these were combined and unified to provide a 
single measure of smoking status in pregnancy. Some variables 
had high levels of missing data.
The study design was by necessity non-randomised and obser-
vational, and relied on routinely collected data which varied in 
definition and completeness in different organisations. Thus, alter-
native explanations for the findings should be considered. There 
may have been changes in characteristics of the women over the 
study period; however, we included important confounding vari-
ables in our statistical models, and the before and after periods 
overlapped in different trusts. The increase in referral rates after 
implementation of the intervention is likely attributable in part to 
improved ascertainment, at least in some trusts; indeed, this was 
an explicit objective of the intervention. However, the primary 
outcome of smoking at time of delivery was collected across all

trusts throughout the study period according to Department of 
Health requirements. Furthermore, stopping smoking was more 
likely in women with a recorded referral to smoking cessation 
services and a recorded quit date, suggesting that the impact of the 
intervention on quit rates is mediated in part by increased referrals 
to smoking cessation services.
During the introduction of the intervention, responsibility 
for smoking cessation services was moved from health services 
to local government, resulting in delayed implementation 
which meant that we could not evaluate any additional impact 
of the ‘risk perception’ element of the intervention. Our find-
ings may not be generalisable to all settings, for example, areas 
with lower baseline prevalence of smoking during pregnancy. 
We were unable to determine whether the effect of the inter-
vention was sustained beyond 4 months, or postnatally in indi-
vidual women; relapse rates are reported to be around 40% 
postpartum.22 We were also unable to quantify unintended 
positive consequences, such as partners stopping smoking.
The intervention targeted behaviours at a number of levels 
across the healthcare system, both organisational and indi-
vidual. It was not possible to identify specific aspects of this 
complex intervention which led to the observed changes, 
nor were we able to confirm whether the positive effects we 
observed were sustained. Our finding that additional training 
sessions increased referrals suggests that repeated training may 
be required to prevent attenuation.23 Some of the effect of 
the intervention may be attributable to increased attention, 
focus and priority on smoking in pregnancy, irrespective of 
the particular elements unique to this intervention.
comparison with other studies
Referrals to smoking cessation services rose progressively after 
implementation, and this may reflect both the implementation of 
the explicit referral threshold and pathway, as well as the estab-
lishment of formal recording systems within smoking cessation 
services, which were not universally in place prior to implemen-
tation. Increased referrals were accompanied by increased quit 
rates; furthermore, quit rates were significantly increased where 
there was a recorded referral to smoking cessation services or a 
recorded quit date, suggesting that increased referrals resulted 
directly in higher quit rates.
T
wo smaller studies of implementation of routine biochem-
ical validation and opt-out referral have been published. The 
first, in 3700 pregnant women in two hospitals, found that 
referrals to smoking cessation services increased, but quit rates 
did not11; the authors attributed this to an increase in refer-
rals of women less motivated to quit. The second, in nearly 
5000 pregnant women from a single hospital trust, reported 
a doubling of 4-week quit rates,12 similar to the results of our 
larger multisite study. This may reflect the emphasis on skills 
training in the latter two studies, with particular focus on 
communication skills for introducing universal CO monitoring 
into the routine antenatal consultation. Few other studies have 
evaluated service models for smoking in pregnancy, despite 
evidence of low referral rates.24 McGowan et al evaluated the 
implementation of routine CO screening and opt-out referral 
across a number of hospitals, but provided no data on quit 
rates21; furthermore, midwives had difficulties implementing 
CO screening, an important issue directly addressed within the 
babyClear training sessions.
The intervention aimed to improve referral rates into NHS 
smoking cessation services, which have been reported to be 
effective,25 but in recent years, service models have changed 
in response to reduced budgets. Our reported effect on quit 
rates is within the range of effect sizes for trials of interven-
tions to promote smoking cessation in pregnancy.5 6 Women

from deprived areas were less likely to quit, in line with other 
studies.26
There was considerable variation in referrals and quit rates 
across individual trusts in this study, despite adjustment for 
key sociodemographic confounders. Variation between trusts 
may be partly explained by differences in the fidelity of imple-
mentation of the intervention. We conducted a parallel qual-
itative process evaluation aiming to illuminate the process of 
implementation within participating organisations, which will 
be reported separately. We used evidence from the qualitative 
data to develop variables to describe some of the variability in 
implementation across trusts. Our quantitative results indicate 
that this variability at the trust level did contribute to differ-
ences in the observed referral and quit rates; specifically, trusts 
that had a formal system for early contact with women, and the 
provision of additional training sessions, increased referrals. 
Nonetheless, it is possible that the observed trust level effects 
could have arisen because of unmeasured variation between 
trusts, supporting our a priori adoption of a mixed-effects 
modelling approach.
We found that women who smoked throughout pregnancy 
delivered infants nearly 260 g lighter at term than non-smokers. 
This is a bigger effect than reported in some studies,27 28 but 
as in other previous work, we found the effect of smoking 
on birth weight was largely reversible by quitting during 
pregnancy.29
A wide range of interventions to promote smoking cessa-
tion during pregnancy have been estimated to be cost-effective, 
including individual support from trained advisers typical of 
that provided within this study.4 30 We estimated the cost per 
delivery of the intervention to be £30; the cost per smoker will 
vary with local smoking prevalence. Our estimates include the 
costs of additional workload generated within smoking cessation 
services from increased referrals, but exclude the costs before 
introduction of the intervention. Previous economic evalua-
tions4 30 have explored the economic implications of the effect 
of smoking cessation on maternal and infant health outcomes 
(eg, reduction in pregnancy complications and improvements in 
birth weight and other birth outcomes). Our economic analysis 
focussed solely on the costs of implementing the intervention 
and the consequences in relation to quit rates. Healthcare costs 
associated with deliveries and changes in health outcomes were 
not included due to lack of the required data. Given the health 
service costs and expected health consequences incurred by 
smoking in pregnancy, the intervention is likely to be cost-ef-
fective compared with other smoking cessation interventions7 
and conventional thresholds for cost-effectiveness adopted in 
the UK.31
Meaning and implications
This complex intervention, aimed at improving skills, resources 
and referral pathways across local healthcare systems, provides 
a feasible and effective method of implementing evidence-based 
guidelines for smoking cessation in pregnancy. A system-wide 
focus on routine identification and referral of pregnant smokers 
is likely to be cost-effective and to have an important impact 
on pregnancy outcome. Future research should address require-
ments for sustainability of such an approach, and explore reasons 
for local variability in implementation success.

What this paper adds
What is already known on this subject
 
► Smoking in pregnancy causes serious harm to the health of 
the developing fetus, which can be reduced by systematic 
identification and treatment of pregnant smokers.
 
► Smoking in pregnancy rates remain high with wide variation 
by location and socioeconomic position.
 
► Barriers to effective implementation of evidence-based best 
practice include lack of resources, skills and motivation of 
frontline staff.
 
► Recent research in individual hospitals suggests that 
implementation of routine carbon monoxide monitoring and 
opt-out referral of pregnant smokers to smoking cessation 
services increases referral rates, with unclear impacts on quit 
rates.
What this study adds
 
► This study provides evidence that implementation of a 
system-wide intervention across a regional health system 
focused on skills training, systematic universal carbon 
monoxide monitoring with opt-out referral, and improved 
referral pathways and communications between maternity 
and smoking cessation services can significantly increase 
referrals and quit rates.
