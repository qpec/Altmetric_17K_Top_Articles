ABSTRACT
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by synaptic immatu-
rity, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes. The disorder
is caused by transcriptional shutdown in neurons of the fragile X
mental retardation 1 gene product, fragile X mental retardation
protein. Fragile X mental retardation protein is a repressor of
dendritic mRNA translation and its silencing leads to dysregu-
lation of synaptically driven protein synthesis and impairments of
intellect, cognition, and behavior, and FXS is a disorder that
currently has no effective therapeutics. Here, young fragile X
mice were treated with chronic bryostatin-1, a relatively selective
protein kinase C« activator, which induces synaptogenesis
and synaptic maturation/repair. Chronic treatment with
bryostatin-1 rescues young fragile X mice from the disorder
phenotypes, including normalization of most FXS abnormalities in
1) hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, 2)
postsynaptic density-95 levels, 3) transformation of immature
dendritic spines to mature synapses, 4) densities of the presynaptic
and postsynaptic membranes, and 5) spatial learning and memory.
The therapeutic effects were achieved without downregulation of
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 5 in the hippocampus
and are more dramatic than those of a late-onset treatment in adult
fragile X mice. mGluR5 expression was in fact lower in fragile X
mice and its expression was restored with the bryostatin-1
treatment. Our results show that synaptic and cognitive function
of young FXS mice can be normalized through pharmacological
treatment without downregulation of mGluR5 and that bryostatin-
1–like agents may represent a novel class of drugs to treat fragile X
mental retardation at a young age and in adults.
Introduction
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of
inherited intellectual disability (Santoro et al., 2012), is
characterized by synaptic immaturity, cognitive deficits
(Koekkoek et al., 2005), and autistic-like behavior (Sabaratnam
et al., 2003). The disorder is typically caused by an expansion
of an untranslated CGG repeat in the 59 untranslated region
of the X-linked gene fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1;
Verkerk et al., 1991). This triplet expansion leads to DNA
methylation of FMR1 and transcriptional shutdown of the gene.
The loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an
RNA-binding protein, causes dysregulation of the translation of
dendritic mRNAs (Ashley et al., 1993; Darnell and Klann,
2013). FMRP represses translation probably by interacting
with a specific subset of mRNAs, directly binding to the
ribosome with high affinity, and thereby precluding the binding
of tRNA and translation elongation factors on the ribosome
(Chen et al., 2014). The key functional role of the binding of
FMRP to RNA is supported by the evidence that a missense
mutation in the KH2 domain (Ile304Asn) of human FMRP
abolishes its binding to polyribosome and leads to a severe form
of FXS (Siomi et al., 1994).
Signal processing at synapses is dramatically altered due to
the lack of FMRP, resulting in an impaired ability in synapto-
genesis, synaptic maturation, and synaptic plasticity to meet
cognitive demands (Nelson and Alkon, 2015) and behavioral
control. The most compelling is the evidence involving the
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 5 (Bhattacharya
and Klann, 2012), based on the observation of an abnormally
enhanced mGluR5-dependent long-term depression in fragile
X mice (Huber et al., 2002). The leading mGluR theory of FXS
indicates that overactive mGluR5 signaling, normally bal-
anced by FMRP, underlies much of the brain pathology of FXS
(Santoro et al., 2012; Hajós, 2014). Drug development for the
treatment of FXS thus has been focused on achieving this
balance by reducing mGluR5 hyperactivity in the brain.
Consistently, genetic reduction of mGluR5 expression or
pharmacologic mGluR5 antagonism has been reported to
correct many FXS phenotypes in fragile X mice (Huber et al.,
2002; Hajós, 2014).
We have found that chronic activation of protein kinase C
(PKC) « in the hippocampus can rescue synapses and spatial
cognition, as well as other FXS phenotypes, in adult fragile X
mice after the disorder has established (Sun et al., 2014).
The downside of late-onset treatment is that the therapy
may miss a critical period of youth, important in age-related
sociocognitive and behavioral development. It is also not
clear whether the observed therapeutic effects involve

 downregulation of the mGluR5 in the hippocampus. If the
syndrome is a lasting consequence of brain development with
deficit in synaptic maturation, it is possible that early in-
tervention with agents that facilitate synaptic maturation
could achieve a better outcome, unfolding full potential of
therapeutics. This is highly achievable, considering the evi-
dence that newborn screening for FXS is technically feasible
(Tassone, 2014). In this study, we, therefore, evaluate thera-
peutic potential of a PKC« activator on synapses, cognitive
function, and other FXS phenotypes, including mGluR5
expression in the hippocampus of young fragile X mice.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Drug Treatment. Two types of male mice (9 to 10
per group; at an age of close to 3 weeks when obtained; Jackson
Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used: FVB.129P2-Pde6b1
Tyrc-ch Fmr1tm1Cgr/J (fragile X mice) and FVB.129P2-Pde6b1
Tyrc-ch/AntJ (age-matched wild-type controls). These mice do not
suffer from blindness. They were housed in a temperature-controlled
(20°C–24°C) room, allowed free access to food and water, and kept on
a 12-hour light/dark cycle.
All mice were randomly assigned to different groups. Bryostatin-1
was administered (20 mg/m2, tail i.v., two doses per week for 6 weeks),
starting at an age of close to 4 weeks (26 to 27 days). The treatment
would catch the last week or so in brain development (a month in a
mouse with a lifespan of 2 years is roughly equal to 3.3 years of brain
development in humans; Sengupta, 2013) before FXS phenotypes are
established in fragile X mice (Bhattacharya and Klann, 2012).
Although synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation occur throughout
a mammalian lifespan, mouse brain development is anatomically
complete at approximately 5 weeks of age, when all FXS phenotypes
are established in fragile X mice (Bhattacharya and Klann, 2012;
Michalon et al., 2012). The age would roughly correspond to mid-
adolescence (approximately 15 years of age) in humans in term of
synaptic maturation in the prefrontal cortex (Huttenlocher and
Dabholkar, 1997). The same behavioral training procedures were
performed in all animal groups in this study, so that differences in
observed results would indeed reflect effects of drug treatments. The
dose was based on our preliminary dose-response studies that smaller
doses were not effective against disorder-induced synaptic and
cognitive impairments. Nontreated groups received the same volume
of vehicle at the same frequency. Synaptic and memory functions and
other phenotypic features were evaluated 9 days after the last dose.
Tissue Preparation for Confocal Microscopy. Animals were
deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (120 mg/kg, i.p.) and
perfused through the heart with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for , 4 minutes at room temperature and then with 4% paraformalde-
hyde in PBS (approximately 40 ml) to remove any negative effects of
hypothermia on dendritic spines (Kirov et al., 2004). Brains were then
kept in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at 4°C and stored
in PBS at 4°C. Right dorsal hippocampi were sectioned with a
vibratome (Leica VT1200S; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany)
into 200-mm thickness and kept in series in PBC at 4°C for three-
dimensional reconstruction.
Three-Dimensional Reconstruction Analysis of Dendritic
Spine Morphology on Dendritic Shafts. The tips of glass elec-
trodes, prepared for electrophysiological experiments, were immersed
for 10 seconds in 5% (w/v) 1,19-dioctadecyl-3,3,39,39-tetramethylindo-
carbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) in dichloromethane (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and air dried at room temperature for 1 hour (twice).
The tips of DiI-coated electrodes were inserted, broken, and left in the
strata oriens of the CA1 area of hippocampal sections at 200-mm
thickness (three to four electrode tips per slice). After maintenance in
PBS at 4°C overnight, the hippocampal sections were resectioned to
7-mm thickness and kept in PBS at 4°C. In the case that DiI was not
well diffused along dendritic shafts, the 7-mm thickness sections in
PBS were changed from 4°C to room temperature. At each time of
confocal scanning, only one section was freshly mounted on a silane-
coated microscope slide (Silanated slides; KD Medical, Columbia,
MD), using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS as a mounting medium.
Dendrites were imaged by a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope
equipped with a 710-confocal scanning microscopy (.510 nm/568 nm
excitation/emission) using a 100� Plan-APO Chromat oil immersion
objective (1.4 numerical aperture; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). A
series of randomized confocal images (1024 � 1024 pixels) were
confocally scanned at every 0.145 mm. The image resolution was
according to Nyquist sampling, and the pixel size was 48, 48, and
145 (x, y, and z in nanometers, respectively). Using the ImageJ plugin
Deconvolution Laboratory (Biomedical Imaging Group, EPFL;
Lausanne, Switzerland), stacks of confocal images were deconvoluted
by the Tikhonov-Miller algorithm. A confocal stack of point spread
function, used for deconvolution, was prepared from Fluoro-max dyed
red aqueous fluorescent beads [63-nm diameter, 1% (w/v) stock
solution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA], further diluted to
1:10,000, smeared, and air dried on a microscopic slide coated with
0.01% poly(L-lysine).
Dendritic spines were automatically detected and counted with the
NeuronStudio (beta) program (Rodriguez et al., 2008; http://research.
mssm.edu/cnic/tools-ns.html). Dendritic projections from dendritic
shafts at 0.2–3 mm in length were classified as dendritic spines.
Dendritic spines with a head-to-neck diameter ratio (neck ratio)
greater than 1.1 were either considered as thin or mushroom-shaped
spines (see below). Spines that did not meet the neck ratio value
(head-to-neck diameter ratio of greater than 1.1) and had a length of
spine to head diameter (thin ratio) above 2.5 were automatically
classified as thin; otherwise, they were classified as stubby. Spines
that met the neck ratio value and had a head diameter (mushroom
size) of 600 nm or greater (Sorra and Harris, 2000) were automat-
ically labeled as mushroom shaped; otherwise, they were labeled as
stubby. Filopodia were identified manually (long profiles without
enlarged heads) from the projection structures that was longer than
dendritic spines and did not have enlarged heads.
Immunohistochemistry. Although histochemical levels of post-
synaptic density (PSD)-95 or synaptophysin have been found to
correspond well with those detected at the biochemical levels (Glantz
et al., 2007; Horling et al., 2015), Western blots measure the total
protein levels in the tissue and may have results that are different
from histochemistry at a single structure or cell level, owing to protein
expression or transport to a specific structure (Hongpaisan et al.,
2013). Our study, however, focused on the structure changes, and we
thus used immunohistochemistry to confirm the morphologic studies
using electron microscopy (see below) and confocal microscopy of DiI
staining.
Hippocampal sections at 200-mm thickness were further fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 to 3 days at 4°C and resectioned into
5-mm thickness. Sections at 5-mm thickness of the right dorsal
hippocampus (one section every 400 mm; four serial sections from
each animal) were processed as described below. Hippocampal slices
were incubated free floating with Image-iTTM FX signal enhancer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for
30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight at
room temperature with the following primary antibodies (Hongpaisan
and Alkon, 2007): mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (1:2000;
EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-spinophilin
(1:100; EMD Millipore), mouse monoclonal anti–growth-associated
protein (GAP)-43/B-50 (1:2000; EMD Millipore), mouse monoclonal
anti–PSD-95 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),
mouse monoclonal anti–brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
(1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and/or rabbit monoclonal anti-
mGluR5 (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Tissue sections were then
incubated with either Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody (1:200;
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and/or a biotinylated secondary antibody
(1:20; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 3 hours at room

 temperature and then with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488
(1:100; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3 hours at room temperature.
Sections were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium
with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to counterstain nuclei (Vector
Laboratories).
The random area in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum that
appeared immediately after switching to a higher-magnification lens
(63� Plan-APO Chromat oil immersion objectives; 1.4 numerical
aperture) was imaged for appropriate fluorescence (e.g., Alexa Fluor
488 and/or 568). Confocal images of hippocampal sections were
acquired in line-scan mode and with a pinhole of approximately 1.00
airy unit. Confocal images with similar levels of 49,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole fluorescence intensity among experimental conditions
were quantified with the ImageJ program (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/;
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), with control data being
set at 100%.
Quantification for Immunostained Density of Pre- or Post-
synaptic Structure. Confocal images of the density of postsynaptic
dendritic spines, presynaptic axonal terminals, postsynaptic mem-
branes, or presynaptic membranes per 45 � 45 � 0.6 mm3 volume of
the CA1 stratum radiatum were analyzed as previously described
(Hongpaisan et al., 2011).
Electron Microscopy. Under anesthesia with pentobarbiturate,
mice were perfused through the heart with PBS (5 ml) and 2%
glutaraldehyde and 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (80 ml). Brains were
removed and stored in fixative at 4°C. Hippocampal slices were
processed for Epon embedding, resectioned to 90-nm thickness,
collected on a grid, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Electron micrographs were taken of the middle of each section with a
JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Inc., Peabody,
MA). Random sampling was achieved by orienting the hippocampal
CA1 area under low-power magnification. The random area that
immediately appeared after switching to a higher magnification
(7000� magnification) was imaged with a charge-coupled device
camera. Electron micrographs were quantified on the Preview pro-
gram on a MacPro 4.1 computer with a 30-inch monitor (Apple,
Cupertino, CA). Electron micrographs were collected within 14 � 14 �
0.09 mm3 of the CA1 stratum radiatum. We defined axospinous
synapses as those located between dendritic spine structures that do
not contain mitochondria and with axon boutons containing pre-
synaptic vesicles.
Spatial Learning and Memory and Visible Platform Test. A
modified Morris water maze task (two trials per day for 8 days), a
difficult task for revealing mild impairments, was used to evaluate
spatial learning and memory.
Water maze training sessions began on the ninth day after the last
dose of bryostatin-1, a time gap to separate potential acute effects
from the chronic therapeutic impacts. The maze pool had a diameter
of 114 cm and height of 60 cm and was filled with 40 cm H2O (22 6 1°C),
mixed with 200 ml nontoxic white tempera (BesTemp; Certified Color
Corp., Orange, CA). Mice were trained to find a hidden platform,
centered in one of the quadrants and submerged 2 cm below the water
surface. At the start of each trial, mice were placed individually in the
water facing the maze wall, using different starting positions each trial,
and were allowed to swim until they found the platform, where they
remained for 20 seconds. If a mouse failed to find the platform within
1.5 minutes, it would be guided there by the investigator, with
90 seconds scored. The swim path was recorded with a video-tracking
system. After the training trials, a probe trial was given 24 hours after
the last training trial, with the platform removed to assess memory
retention for its location by the distance the mouse moved in the
quadrants. The video-tracking system tracked the animal’s movements
in each quadrant (1 minute).
The sensorimotor ability of mice was evaluated with a visible
platform test. The platform was placed at a new location and was
marked with a pole that protruded 9 inches above the water surface.
Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by the Newman–Keuls multiple comparisons test.
P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All procedures were
conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Animal Care
and Use Committee guidelines and were approved by the Ethical
Committee of West Virginia University.
Results
Bryostatin-1 Improves Levels of PSD-95 and Metabo-
tropic Glutamate Receptors in Young Fragile X Mice.
Significant differences among experiment groups for PSD-95
membranes, primarily accumulated in the postsynaptic mem-
branes (F3,222 5 6.121, P , 0.001; Fig. 1, A and B), were
observed. In wild-type mice, bryostain-1 significantly in-
creased postsynaptic membranes (P , 0.01; Fig. 1B). Fragile
X mice showed significant decreases in the densities of
postsynaptic membranes (P , 0.05; Fig. 1B). Bryostatin-1
improved the formation of postsynaptic membranes (P ,
0.001; Fig. 1B) in fragile X mice. The data using immuno-
histochemistry confirmed the results from electron micros-
copy analysis (see below).
Accumulation of mGluR5 into postsynaptic densities was
examined with the colocalization of mGluR5 and PSD-95, using
immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A).
Significant differences among the groups of wild-type mice
(WC), wild-type mice with bryostatin-1 (WB), fragile X mice
(TC), and fragile X mice with bryostatin-1 (TB) were observed
for the density of mGluR5-containing postsynaptic membranes
(colocalization area of mGluR5 and PSD-95; ANOVA, F1,187 5
7.814, P , 0.001; Fig. 1C) and mGluR5 level in postsynaptic
membranes (mGluR5 fluorescence intensity in the colocaliza-
tion area; F1,187 5 3.478, P , 0.01; Fig. 1D). Data with significant
difference with ANOVA were subsequently analyzed with a
two-tailed paired t test. Bryostatin-1 had no effect in wild-type
mice, whereas decreases in the number of mGluR5-containing
postsynaptic membranes (P , 0.01; Fig. 1C) and their mGluR5
level (P , 0.05; Fig. 1D) were significantly improved with
bryostatin-1 in transgenic mice (P , 0.01; Fig. 1, C and D).
Bryostatin-1 also enhanced the density of mGluR5-containing
postsynaptic membranes in transgenic mice, compared with
wild-type controls (Fig. 1C, compare TB with WC).
Bryostatin-1 Prevents the Loss of BDNF in Young
Fragile X Mice. Immunohistochemistry of BDNF in the CA1
stratum radiatum, imaged with a confocal microscope, showed
a significant difference among experimental groups (F1,120 5
27.484, P , 0.001; Fig. 1E). Bryostatin-1 did not increase
BDNF expression in wild-type mice (Fig. 1F). However, in
transgenic mice, the reduction of BDNF (P , 0.001) was
significantly improved (P , 0.001) and was even elevated
above wild-type levels (Fig. 1E, compare TB with WC; P ,
0.05) with bryostatin-1.
Bryostatin-1 Increases Presynaptic Vesicle Concen-
tration within Presynaptic Boutons. Densities of pre-
synaptic axonal boutons and their presynaptic vesicle
content in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum were
evaluated with confocal immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2A).
ANOVA showed no significant difference among experimen-
tal groups for presynaptic axonal bouton density, as de-
termined by counting the grains of presynaptic vesicle
protein synaptophysin (Fig. 2B). However, significant differ-
ences among experiment groups were seen for presynaptic
vesicle concentration within the presynaptic axonal boutons,
as determined with the fluorescent intensity of synaptophysin

 (F3,142 5 2.726, P , 0.05; Fig. 2C). Although bryostatin-1 had
no effect on presynaptic bouton density in all experimental
conditions (Fig. 2B), bryostatin-1 increased presynaptic vesicle
concentration within the presynaptic boutons both in wild-type
(P , 0.05) and fragile X (P , 0.01) mice (Fig. 2C).
Electron microscopy was further used to determine the
concentration of presynaptic vesicles at a single axonal
bouton level (Fig. 2E). There was a significant difference
among experimental groups (F3,190 5 8.018, P , 0.001;
Fig. 2D). Electron microscopy confirmed the results of
confocal immunohistochemistry that no significant change
in presynaptic vesicles level was observed in fragile X
mice (Fig. 2D, compare TC with WC), and bryostyatin-1
significantly increased the presynaptic vesicle level in
both wild-type and fragile X mice (Fig. 2D, WB versus WC,
and TB versus TC).

 Bryostatin-1 Increases Synaptic Densities. Density of
axodendritic synapses in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radia-
tum was determined with electron microscopy (Fig. 3A). There
was a significant difference among experimental groups
(F3,195 5 6.426, P , 0.001; Fig. 3B). In wild-type mice, bryostatin-1
significantly increased synaptic density (P , 0.05; Fig. 3B). In
fragile X mice, synaptic loss (P , 0.05) was significantly
reversed (P , 0.001) with bryostatin-1 treatment (Fig. 3B).
Changes in presynaptic membranes in the hippocampal

immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3C). Significant differences
among experiment groups for GAP-43, predominantly located
in presynaptic membranes (F3,117 5 13.149, P , 0.001; Fig.

cantly increased presynaptic membranes (P , 0.05; Fig. 3D).
Fragile X mice showed significant decreases in the densities of
presynaptic membranes (P , 0.001; Fig. 3D). Bryostatin-1
improved the formation of presynaptic membranes (P , 0.05;
Fig. 3D). The data using immunohistochemistry confirmed the
results from electron microscopy (see below).
In wild-type mice, bryostatin-1 increased the synaptic
density (Fig. 3, A–E) but not the dendritic spine density (Fig.
3, I and J), suggesting that some dendritic spines form more
than one synapse.

microscopy. Therefore, we used the immunohistochemistry to measure the presynaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin intensity within the
presynaptic boutons. Both electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry gave the same results. (A) Immunohistochemistry of the presynaptic vesicle

correlated with the enhancement of memory retention after
water maze training. In fragile X mice, a significant decrease
in mushroom dendritic spines (P , 0.01; Fig. 3F, compare TC
with WC) was significantly improved with bryostatin-1 treat-
ment (P , 0.001; Fig. 3F, compare TB with TC). The number of
mushroom spines in fragile X mice treated with bryostatin-1
was not different from that in wild-type mice treated with
bryostatin-1 (Fig. 3F, compare TB with WB).
Bryostatin-1 Improves the Maturation of Dendritic
Spines in Young Fragile X Mice. Significance differences
among experimental groups were found for immature spines
or filopodia (F3,142 5 24.386, P , 0.001; Fig. 3G) and mature
dendritic spines (mushroom plus thin plus stubby spines;
F3,142 5 3.956, P , 0.01; Fig. 3H) were seen at a single apical
dendritic shaft of the CA1 pyramidal neuron. In wild-type
mice, bryostatin-1 treatment did not change the numbers of
filopodia and mature dendritic spines (Fig. 3, G and H). In
fragile X mice, an increased number of immature spines (P ,
0.001; Fig. 2H) and a decreased number of mushroom plus thin
plus stubby spines (P , 0.05; Fig. 3H) was observed compared
with wild-type mice. These changes were reversed to the wild-
type control level with bryostatin-1 treatment.
Changes in overall dendritic spine density (45 � 45 � 0.6 mm3
volume of stratum radiatum), a hippocampal part that
correlated with the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal
neurons, were studied with immunohistochemistry of the
dendritic spine–specific protein spinophilin (Fig. 3I). A signif-
icant difference among experiment groups was seen (F3, 154 5
4.748, P , 0.01). Bryostatin-1 had no effect on dendritic spine
density in wild-type mice but improved the loss of dendritic

 spine density in fragile X mice (P , 0.05; Fig. 3J). These data
on the densities of dendritic spines per brain volume units
were correlated with changes in the number of dendritic
spines on dendritic spine shafts studied with DiI staining
(compare Fig. 3, G and H).
Taken together, the results suggest that bryostatin-1
improves the maturation of dendritic spines from the imma-
ture spines in the young fragile X mice.
Bryostatin-1 Prevents Deficits in Spatial Learning
and Memory of Young Fragile X Mice But Did Not Alter
Sensorimotor Ability. There were significant learning dif-
ferences among the four groups (F3,560 5 58.528, P , 0.001;
Fig. 4A), indicating different learning among the groups.
Spatial learning was significantly impaired in fragile X mice
(fragile X mice with vehicle versus wild-type with vehicle:
F1,272 5 22.117, P , 0.001). Bryostatin-1 treatment signif-
icantly improved the learning performance of fragile X mice
(fragile X mice with vehicle versus fragile X mice with
bryostatin-1: F1,272 5 110.621, P , 0.001) to the level of
the control mice with bryostatin-1 treatment (wild-type with
bryostatin-1 versus fragile X mice with bryostatin-1: F1,272 5
0.669, P . 0.05), indicating that the chronic bryostatin-1
treatment not only improved spatial learning in the wild-
type mice but also repaired the learning deficits of fragile X
mice when tested at an adult age after an early 6-week
treatment.
The results of the probe test (Fig. 4, B–E) were analyzed
using the target quadrant ratio (dividing the target quadrant
distance by the average of the nontarget quadrant values
during the probe test; Fig. 4F). There were significant differ-
ences in the target quadrant ratio among the groups (F3,38 5
8.790, P , 0.001), indicating differences in the spatial memory
among the groups. Detailed analysis reveals that the memory
recall of the transgenic mice was impaired (fragile X mice with
vehicle versus wild-type with vehicle: F1, 18 5 5.155, P , 0.05)
and that bryostatin-1 treatment in the transgenic mice
significantly improved the memory recall, compared with that
of fragile X mice without the treatment (F1,17 5 21.145, P ,
0.001), to the level of the control mice with bryostatin-1
(control mice with bryostatin-1 versus fragile X mice with
bryostatin-1: F1,17 5 0.063, P . 0.05).
A visible platform test, determined after the probe test,
revealed no significant differences among the groups (F3,35 5
0.179, P . 0.05; Fig. 4G), indicating that there were no
significant group differences in sensorimotor ability and
escape motivation of the mice among different groups.
Therefore, the differences in learning and memory-recall
performance among the groups cannot be attributed to
the differences in their sensorimotor ability and escape
motivation.
Discussion
The main findings of this study of an early-onset treat-
ment in young adult mice can be summarized as follows.
First, the loss of FMR1 protein in fragile X mice suppresses
BDNF expression, dendritic spine and synaptic maturation,
PSD-95 and mGluR5 accumulation, and memory-dependent
mushroom-shaped dendritic spine formation in the apical
dendrites of the hippocampal CA1 neurons, resulting in
spatial learning and memory deficits. Second, the synaptic
immaturity and cognitive dysfunction, core features of FXS,
and other FXS phenotypes can be rescued with an early
treatment of bryotatin-1 in order to produce therapeutic
effects that are better than those of a late-onset treatment
(see below). Finally, therapeutic effects can be achieved
without downregulation of mGluR5 in the hippocampus.
It has been well established that FMRP mediates activity-
dependent control of synaptic structure and function (Huber
et al., 2002). Experimental studies suggest that the lack of
FMRP leads to overactivity of mGluR5, a decreased GABAergic
system (Olmos-Serrano et al., 2010), and elevated activity of
glycogen synthase kinase 3b (Guo et al., 2012). Synaptic
immaturity and cognitive dysfunction are core symptoms in
FXS and learned-induced formation of dendritic spines is
severely impaired in fragile X mice (Padmashri et al., 2013).
Fragile X mice show an abundance of dense, immature
dendritic spines (Scotto-Lomassese et al., 2011), as in FXS
patients (Grossman et al., 2006). The hyperabundance of
immature-looking lengthened dendritic spines could be the
result of failed/delayed maturation (Cruz-Martín et al., 2010)
and activity-dependent synaptic elimination (Pfeiffer et al.,
2010). It has been reported that the left hippocampus in
young male adult fragile X permutation carriers exhibits
reduced structural connectome (Leow et al., 2014), consistent
with evidence of a range of cognitive impairment, including
spatial processing (Hocking et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2012).
The deficit may also involve a loss of some dendritic channels
(Routh et al., 2013) but can be rescued with chronic
bryostatin-1 treatment at a young age, as shown in our study
and previously in adults (Sun et al., 2014). The treatment in
our study began at least 1 month earlier than our previous
study (Sun et al., 2014), in which the same dose was
administered at an adult age (2 months of age) for a longer
treatment period (13 weeks). Histologic analyses were all
performed at an adult age. Earlier treatment may lead to
more favorable outcomes for several reasons. First, the
therapeutic outcomes seem to be significantly better in the
early-onset treatment group with the same doses of treat-
ment, including the higher enhancement of BDNF expres-
sion and mushroom-shaped dendritic spine formation (Fig. 5,
A and B), better synaptic maturation (Fig. 5, C and D), and
greater improvements in performance in the water maze
task (Fig. 5, E and F), suggesting that the brain network
under the treatment has regained the capacity to meet
cognitive demands. Second, an early intervention might
facilitate a more “normal” development of sociocognitive skills
and behaviors.
Our results of reduced mGluR5 labeling in the hippocampus
of fragile X mice and increased labeling with bryostatin-1
treatment are somewhat unexpected. The data suggest that
syndromic features of FXS might not be caused by an
upregulated mGluR5 signaling pathway and synaptic and
cognitive function can be rescued without downregulation of
mGluR5 signaling. Desensitization of mGluR5, if induced
(Gereau and Heinemann, 1998) with the treatment, and
increased internalization would result in decreased surface
expression of the receptor (Ko et al., 2012), a response not
observed in this study. There is no evidence suggesting a
direct association of FMRP with the metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5 mRNA, although Lohith et al. (2013) revealed that
both mGluR5 binding and protein expression were increased
in the prefrontal cortex of FXS patients and carriers. In the
fragile X mouse hippocampus, Western blot analysis was

 reported to show no difference in mGluR5 protein expression
(Dölen et al., 2007), although a reduction was observed in the
detergent-insoluble fraction of synaptic membranes isolated
from the forebrain of fragile X mice (Giuffrida et al., 2005).
There are also some observations of reduced expression of
mGluR5 in fragile X mice (Giuffrida et al., 2005), but no
difference in mGluR5 expression in total hippocampal homog-
enates has been reported by others (Huber et al., 2002).
The lack of differences in mGluR5 expression (Huber et al.,
2002; Giuffrida et al., 2005) between fragile X mice and
controls but the presence of a reduced association of mGluR5
with PSD in fragile X mice might suggest an increased non-
PSD association of mGluR5 labeling in fragile X mice.
However, the evidence that supports the notion that mGluR5
overactivity reflects neuronal pathology in FXS seems very
solid. Reducing mGluR5 expression or the use of mGluR5
inhibitors has been shown to correct a broad range of fragile
X phenotypes in fragile X mice (Huber et al., 2002; Hajós,
2014). Although one would expect an increased colocalization
of postsynaptic mGluR5 when it is overactive, our study does
not rule out the possibility that the observed reduction in
mGluR5 labeling in fragile X mice might partially reflect the
reduced PSD labeling in the brain area. Nevertheless, our
results indicate that the desired therapeutic effects can be
achieved in fragile X mice without downregulation of
mGluR5 in the hippocampus. The effective treatment actu-
ally improves mGluR5 labeling in the hippocampus. It is
probably appropriate to mention here that while preclinical
studies with mGluR5 antagonism appear promising, thera-
peutic values of mGluR5 inhibitors for FXS are still not clear.
The mGluR5 inhibition exaggerates spine immaturity in
fragile X mice (Cruz-Martín et al., 2010), an effect that would
be considered opposite to the intended therapeutic outcomes.
In addition, basimglurant and mavoglurant, two different
and potent mGluR5 inhibitors, did not show therapeutic
benefit in recent phase II clinical trials in FXS patients
(Scharf et al., 2015).
Consistent with our previous study in fragile X mice, chronic
bryostatin-1 rescues other FXS phenotypes, such as PSD-95
(Zalfa et al., 2007; Tang and Alger, 2015) and BDNF levels in
the hippocampus. PSD-95, a major synapse organizer, plays
an important role in the stabilization of spines and synapses
as well as in activity-regulated formation of PSD. BDNF is
important for local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity
(Neumann et al., 2015). Although images of the BDNF
fluorescence labeling were used to measure the BDNF levels
in this study, the labeling intensity was found to reliably
reflect the BDNF levels in the same brain areas determined
with an immunochemical assay, such as the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, in our previous studies (Sun et al.,
2014). Reduction of BDNF expression in fragile X mice induces
cognitive deficits (Louhivuori et al., 2011; Uutela et al., 2012).
Infusion of BDNF has been found to restore synaptic function
in slices from fragile X mice (Lauterborn et al., 2007). The
decrease in BDNF accumulation in the CA1 stratum radiatum
was significantly prevented with both the early-onset (this
study) and late-onset (Sun et al., 2014) bryostatin-1 treat-
ment. However, early-onset bryostatin-1 treatment, but not
late-onset bryostatin-1 treatment, also enhanced the BDNF
level (higher than the control wild-type without bryostatin-1
treatment).
It is interesting that in the wild-type mice, the early-onset
bryostatin-1 treatment significantly elevated the spatial
memory retention (in this study) above wild-type levels,
whereas the late-onset bryostatin-1 treatment did not
enhance memory retention (Sun et al., 2014), with the
same lag period to separate acute effects from the chronic
therapeutic effects. However, we did not find a significant
enhancement of PKC«-induced BDNF levels after early-
onset bryostatin-1 treatment. This might implicate that
other PKC«-dependent pathways might also be involved in
synaptic plasticity. The direct interaction of PKC« with
actin is important for synaptic function and neurite growth
and synaptic formation (Prekeris et al., 1996). PKC« may
also induce synaptogenesis directly by activating structural
changes through its phosphorylation substrates, GAP-43,
the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and
adducin (Matsuoka et al., 1998).
Bryostatin-1, a highly potent and relatively specific PKC«
activator with pharmacological profiles of synaptogenesis
and synaptic maturation/repairing (Hongpaisan and Alkon,
2007; Hongpaisan et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2015), rescues
synaptic and memory functions and other phenotypic fea-
tures in young fragile X mice. At low concentrations (about
1 nm), its PKC activation is mostly on PKC« and less on PKCa.
At higher concentrations, however, activities of other PKC
isoforms might also be affected. At a lower dose (10 mg/m2,
two doses per week for 3 weeks), bryostatin-1 alone was
found to have no significant effects on spatial learning and
memory in rats (Sun and Alkon, 2008). We previously
observed that its chronic administration did not alter
swimming speed of rodents in the swimming test (Sun and
Alkon, 2008). Evidence is accumulating, supporting an
essential role of some PKC isoforms in various phases and
types of learning and memory (Alkon et al., 2005, 2007).
Bryostatin-1–like agents enhance the synthesis of proteins
required for memory processing and synaptic repair/
synaptogenesis, reduce Ab formation through activation of
a-secretase and increase Ab degradation via the endothelin-
converting enzyme, and are antiapoptotic. Since intellectual
ability, as well as retardation (Wang et al., 2012), involves
multiple players in signal processing, these agents with
multitargeting actions (Sun et al., 2015) may represent a
more effective class of therapeutics than agents that target a
single factor in this complex pathologic process (Vislay et al.,
2013).
