ABSTRACT
We studied DNA methylation patterns of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
tumor suppressor gene EPB41L3 in 148 anal and perianal biopsies to determine 
whether high levels of methylation would be associated with anal intraepithelial 
neoplasia (AIN). The most prevalent HPV type was HPV16, detected in 54% of 
the 30 benign biopsies, 33% of the 43 low-grade AIN (lgAIN), 82% of the 59 high 
grade AIN (hgAIN) and 4 of the 5 anal cancers. A methylation score was developed 
(0.561*HPV16me+0.439*EPB41L3) which had increasing values with severity of 
disease: the mean was 8.1% in benign, 13.2% in lgAIN, 22.3% in hgAIN and 49.3% 
in cancers (p < 0.0001). The methylation score as a triage classifier at a cut-off of 8.8 
gave a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI: 82.8, 96.9), specificity of 50.7% (95% CI: 39.7, 
61.6) and area under the curve of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75–0.89) for separating hgAIN 
and cancer from benign and lgAIN biopsies. We conclude that methylation of HPV16 
and EPB41L3 show highly significant association with increasing severity of AIN and 
cancer and may be useful as biomarkers in anal disease.
INTRODUCTION
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects a majority 
of people worldwide. Infection can occur at any age and 
can either be transient (usually resolving within a few 
years) or could be persistent and last for many decades 
[1]. High risk HPV (hrHPV) infection with types 16, 18, 
31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68 in epithelial 
basal cells, especially in certain sites such as the uterine 
cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, and tonsils is an important 
risk factor for the development of squamous cell cancers 
and adenocarcinomas [1, 2]. Natural infections can 
produce immunity to identical and related HPV types 
while vaccination with virus-like-particles elicits a strong 
humoral immune response that is an effective prophylaxis 
[3]. Persistence of hrHPV is a known strong risk factor 
for cervical cancer [4] and occurs in immunocompetent 
individuals but is more common in immunosuppressed 
patients, such as those infected by HIV [5]. The molecular 
mechanisms of transient versus persistent hrHPV 
infections have been only partially elucidated, but may 
involve differences in integration of the HPV genome 
into host DNA and DNA methylation [6, 7]. HPV DNA 
testing can identify almost all prevalent high-grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 and CIN3) and cervical 
cancers in exfoliated cervical cells [8]. The test also has 
a good ability to predict incident disease several years in 
advance of clinical manifestation [9]. Recent widespread

recognition that hrHPV testing is much more sensitive than 
cytology has driven implementation of primary hrHPV 
screening for cervical disease in many countries [8]. 
Anal cancer has been growing in incidence in 
the past few decades, especially in women and also in 
men who have sex with men (MSM). Furthermore, 
anal cancer incidence is higher in HIV-positive MSM 
with approximately 100 cases compared to 25 cases per 
100,000 in HIV-negative MSM [10, 11] and only 1.5 per 
100,000 in men in general in the UK [12]. Most anal 
cancers have been associated with HPV16, while other 
hrHPV types such as HPV18, HPV31 and HPV33 seem 
to play a much smaller role in anal cancer than in cervical 
cancer [13]. High-grade AIN (alternatively called anal 
HSIL) is also associated with hrHPV, especially HPV16, 
and multiple HPV types are often reported in HIV-
positive men [14].
Anal cytology sampling is problematic because 
anal folds may hide lesions and this has resulted in 
recommendations for more frequent sampling to 
compensate for poor sensitivity [15]. Normal, borderline 
or mildly dyskaryotic (also called ASCUS or LSIL) 
cytology is common in patients with hgAIN [16]. High-
resolution anoscopy (HRA) is often used as the primary 
screening tool for high-risk populations in settings where 
resources can support such an intensive approach [17]. 
However, besides the high cost, using HRA to detect 
hgAIN has additional limitations such as a subjective 
result, availability of a trained HRA specialist and 
discomfort caused to the patient. Consequently, for 
decades, other methods of triage to biopsy and treatment 
have been actively sought to lessen the burden on the 
HRA clinics [18].
DNA methylation testing of HPV and human genes 
has been validated as an accurate method for detection of 
CIN2 and CIN3 [19–22]. Levels of methylation increase 
over time in women with persistent HPV16 infection 
and are maximal in patients with cancer [23, 24]. We 
investigated if a similar methylation test might be 
usefully applied to people with anal disease based on 
our a priori hypothesis that high levels of methylation 
at genomic positions associated with hgCIN would 
also be associated with hgAIN. Here, we focus on the 
methylation of host gene EPB41L3 and the high risk viral 
types: HPV16, HPV18, HPV31 and HPV33. EPB41L3 
(Erythrocyte Membrane Protein Band 4.1 like 3) is a 
tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell proliferation, 
promotes apoptosis and has been found to be highly 
methylated in many cancers such as lung, cervix, ovarian 
and breast [25–28].
RESULTS
There were 30 biopsies with <AIN, 43 lgAIN, 59 
hgAIN and 5 cancers among the anal samples and 11 
biopsies of high-grade perianal lesions (Table 1).
HPV genotyping
About a third (47/148) of samples were infected 
with multiple HPV types. 33% of anal biopsies with 
either <AIN, or lgAIN histopathology were not infected 
by hrHPV types while 53% and 33%, respectively, were 
HPV16 positive (Table 1). hgAIN anal and perianal 
biopsies were predominantly infected by HPV16 (83% 
and 91% respectively). A small proportion (9%) of anal 
and perianal hgAIN were infected with hrHPV types other 
than HPV16, i.e. 5 out of 59 of anal and 1 out of 11 of 
perianal biopsies. Also of note, all the perianal lesions 
were hrHPV positive. Only 9% of anal hgAIN biopsies 
were not infected by hrHPV (5/59). All cancers were 
hrHPV positive, four with HPV16 and one with HPV33.
DNA methylation
The DNAme levels of EPB41L3, HPV16L1 and 
HPV16L2 were significantly different between the 
four groups and increased with severity of the lesions 
(p < 0.0001, Cuzick test for trend), but no significant 
differences in the likelihood ratios were found for 
methylation of HPV18, HPV31 and HPV33 and these 
latter markers were dropped from further analysis 
(Table 2). The univariable models (Table 2) investigating 
EPB41L3, HPV16L1 and L2 regions were all highly 
significant (p < 0.0001). The bivariable logistic regression 
using EPB41L3 and HPV16me was highly significant 
(p < 0.0001, Table 2) as was each variable on its own. 
The linearly combined DNAme score was derived 
from the bivariable model and calculated as follows: 
0.561*HPV16me+0.439*EPB41L3. For all three variables 
(EPB41L3, HPV16me and the DNAme score), there was 
a highly significant trend of increased methylation with 
disease progression (Cuzick tests for trend, p < 0.0001). 
Figure 1 shows the methylation of EPB41L3, HPV16me 
and the DNAme score. 
The ROC curves comparing the methylation levels 
in the <AIN and lgAIN samples to the hgAIN and cancer 
cases (Figure 2) had an AUC of 0.712 (95% CI: 0.624, 
0.801, p < 0.0001) for EPB41L3, 0.781 (95% CI: 0.705, 
0.857, p < 0.0001) for HPV16me and 0.821 (95% CI: 
0.750, 0.892, p < 0.0001) for the DNAme score. Figure 2 
also shows the relative sensitivities and specificities of 
genotyping for HPV16 or genotyping for HPV16 and 
HPV18 combined. Supplementary Figure 1 shows ROC 
curves comparing missing DNAme values imputed by 
MICE versus single imputation. The chart indicates that 
there was no statistically significant difference in our 
interpretations of the data using either the multiple or 
single imputed data. 
Sensitivity and specificity of the DNAme score to 
detect hgAIN and cancers and the proportion of positive 
samples identified by the DNAme score is shown in

identified all the cancers and 95% of the hgAIN, while 
correctly classifying 33% of the lgAIN and 50% of the 
<AIN biopsies. In comparison, sensitivity of HPV16 
genotyping to detect hgAIN and cancer was 83% (95% 
CI: 73–92) and specificity was 59% (95% CI: 48–70). 
Supplementary Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of 
methylation of EPB41L3 against HPV16me with the 
relationship having a weak Spearman correlation. We also 
investigated whether the DNAme score would be able 
to correctly identify the 11 high-grade perianal samples 
(Supplementary Figure 3) using cut-offs obtained with 
anal samples. Ten of the cases were correctly identified 
at the cut-off 7.5 and nine at the cut-off 8.8. Finally, we 
stratified the methylation data by HPV16 positivity and 
found that most of the predictive methylation information 
was in the HPV16 infected patients, which demonstrated 
that DNA methylation provided triage information in 
addition to the information given by HPV16 genotyping. 
In contrast little if any diagnostic contribution was 
seen for methylation in the HPV16 negative group 
(Supplementary Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
The a priori hypothesis that high levels of 
methylation at genomic positions shown to be associated 
with hgCIN in our earlier research [19, 29] would also be 
associated with hgAIN has been confirmed, thus opening 
the way to methylation diagnostics of anal disease. Anal 
cytological abnormalities are poor predictors of hgAIN 
amongst HIV-positive patients [30]. Moreover, there 
is not a good correlation between cytology grades and 
histology grades. There are also substantial differences 
between pathologists in interpreting anal histology. In 
our study, we used a single pathologist (MS) who had 
extensive experience in anal pathology for all histology 
and the diagnoses were backed up by p16 staining when 
indicated [31, 32]. Goldstone et al. showed that 20% of 
patients with normal anal cytology and more than 30% 
with borderline cytology had hgAIN [33]. HPV DNA 
testing as a primary anal screen has the advantage of 
greater sensitivity than cytology and has an advantage of 
lower costs than screening with high-resolution anoscopy.

Another advantage of HPV screening is that anoscopy is 
a complex procedure with a need for extensive training 
of practitioners. However, the fundamental problem with 
HPV DNA testing that has precluded its widespread 
use in identifying anal precancer is poor specificity. 
For example, Salit et al. [17] showed that 88% of their 
HIV+ patients were HPV DNA positive for carcinogenic 
types. The specificity of HPV testing can be partially 
rectified by focusing on HPV16, which is one of the most 
common types found in anal cancer [34–37]. However, 
since HPV16 is not present in all anal cancers there is a 
good chance that high-risk progressive lesions will not 
be detected. In our study, we found that most AIN were 
positive for hrHPV DNA and the majority of hgAIN 
were positive for HPV16, with relatively few positive for 
other hrHPV types. However, only 4 of the 5 anal cancers 
were positive for HPV16, the other being positive for 
HPV33, which shows the limitation of relying on HPV16 
genotyping triage. 
DNA methylation is a potential option that may 
offer greater improvements in triage specificity while 
retaining good sensitivity and importantly detect all the

cancers. In our study, all of the anal cancers were positive 
(i.e. above the cut-off) for DNA methylation, similar to 
what has been generally observed for cervical cancer. 
The DNAme score we developed is a multi-biomarker 
panel composed of three CpG sites within the EPB41L3 
gene and the late regions (L1 and L2) of HPV16. The 
AUC of the methylation score for separating <AIN and 
lgAIN from hgAIN and cancer was 0.82 (95% confidence 
interval: 0.75, 0.89, p < 0.0001, Table 3). Studies have 
shown that cervical cancers have higher levels of 
methylation than CIN3 [20]. All the anal cancers in our 
study were highly methylated and quite well separated 
from the hgAIN. This suggests the possibility that DNA 
methylation may be used to indicate AIN destined to 
progress to anal cancer from lesions that will regress or 
remain indolent [38–40].
It is notable that the triage information for hgAIN 
and cancer provided by the methylation score was 
significantly higher only in HPV16 positive people 
(Supplementary Figure 4); however, the cancer negative 
for HPV16 was strongly methylated (25%) for EPB41L3. 
These data demonstrate that DNA methylation provides 
significant diagnostic information for detecting hgAIN 
in addition to that provided by HPV16 genotyping and 
suggests that a methylation test may be used to detect 
essentially all the cancers. The methylation score in 
HPV16 negative people did not show a significant 
discriminating effect. However, we cannot be sure of the 
lack of value of methylation information in the HPV16 
negative samples because the analysis was underpowered 
for this endpoint. These results indicate the need for larger 
studies and a search for more genes that could provide 
additional triage information in people infected with 
hrHPV types other than HPV16.
A limitation of the study is that we used FFPE 
biopsies. Our results need to be replicated in an 
adequately powered study of exfoliated anal cells 
because in routine practice hrHPV positive patients 
would have methylation tests performed on exfoliated 
cells collected by a swab or similar device. This would 
allow efficient triage to HRA, thus reducing costs, 
anxiety and possible over-treatment of low risk people. 
Our study had incomplete information on HIV status and 
the small size of the HIV-negative subset likely produced 
some ascertainment bias. Another limitation of our study 
is the use of patients (mostly MSM) recruited from two 
sites specializing in anal HPV-related disease in London. 
It remains to be seen if our results can be duplicated in 
other settings. 
We conclude that high levels of DNA methylation 
are associated with hgAIN and anal cancer. This 
finding should be further explored to better understand 
the biological mechanisms and the value of DNA 
methylation testing as a molecular triage of hrHPV 
positive individuals for high-resolution anoscopy 
screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A set of anal and perianal biopsy specimens were 
obtained from 148 patients (116 men, 31 women, and 
1 person of unrecorded gender) of whom 94 were HIV 
positive, 40 were HIV negative and 14 had not been 
tested for their HIV status (Supplementary Table 1). The 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies were 
retrieved from the archives of the Homerton University 
Hospital and St Bartholomew’s and the Royal London 
Hospital in London, UK, which are tertiary referral units 
where people with suspected hgAIN are referred for 
further management. Institutional approval (R&D number: 
GU1310) for the study was obtained prior to commencing 
any research work on the specimens. 
In patients undergoing HRA, biopsies were obtained 
from areas of clinical interest that exhibited acetowhite 
changes (regardless of vascular changes) on 5% acetic acid 
application. Most of the biopsies showed morphological 
changes varying from slight to severe which distinguished 
them from the surrounding non-acetowhite normal 
epithelium. The main clinical endpoint for all comparisons 
was the histology result. The biopsies were graded 
histopathologically using the AIN terminology [41] which 
is in general use in the UK, acknowledging that recent 
recommendations for terminology in the US distinguish 
between low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL 
equivalent to AIN1) and HSIL (equivalent to AIN2 and 
AIN3). The histopathological diagnoses were based on 
expert review by one of our team (MS) who has worked 
on anal neoplasia for more than 10 years. Diagnostic 
adjudication of difficult AIN cases was assisted by p16 
staining of tissue sections [42] using the following rule: 
if the p16 result was positive (diffuse staining), the higher 
diagnosis (hgAIN) was assigned and if p16 was negative 
(focal, sporadic and negative staining), the lower diagnosis 
(lgAIN) was assigned. However, some of the biopsies 
showed only presence of HPV, and other biopsies showed 
slight changes that did not fulfil the criteria for lgAIN or 
hgAIN. These evidently non-normal biopsies are assumed 
as benign and were graded as <AIN. 
HPV genotyping 
We used H&E sections annotated by MS as a guide 
to dissect areas of interest on the corresponding four 
unstained 5 μm sections, as previously described [43]. If 
more than one lesion was present on a single section, we 
dissected the lesion with the highest grade. The dissected 
areas from the four sections were placed in the same 
tube. Dissected areas were deparaffinized using 80 µL of 
hexadecane followed by a 5-minute incubation at 56°C. 
One hundred microliters of universal extraction buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA and 
 Oncotarget
50516

0.05% SDS [44] was added to tissues along with 10 µl of 
Proteinase K (QIAGEN) and incubated overnight at 56°C 
followed by a one-hour incubation at 90°C. The lower 
phase was then transferred to a new tube and stored at 
−20°C before PCR.
The samples were tested using the PapType High 
Risk HPV Detection and Genotyping kit (PapType kit, 
Genera Biosystems Ltd) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The kit is able to detect 13 high-risk HPV 
types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 
and 68) a possible high risk type (HPV66) and two low-
risk types (HPV6 and HPV11). The PapType test was 
performed with 10 µL of DNA in a final reaction volume 
of 20 µL with the addition of 2% Tween 20. The PCR 
reaction amplifies a variable region of the L1 gene of the 
HPV genome. A fragment of the human cardiac myosin 
light chain gene (MLC-1) was co-amplified in the same 
reaction vessel as a quality and quantity control. For 
simplicity, we categorized the samples into three HPV 
genotype groups independently of whether they were 
singly or multiply infected: those infected by (1) HPV16, 
(2) by any other high-risk types (including HPV66) and 
(3) those HPV negative or infected only by a low-risk type 
(lrHPV). We did not combine HPV18 with HPV16 due to 
obvious differences in viral disease characteristics as noted 
in earlier studies [1, 45] and the fact that HPV18 does not 
seem to play such an important role in anal cancers [46].
Methylation assays
Bisulfite conversions on 20 µl of DNA extracts were 
done using EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, 
CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA 
methylation (DNAme) was measured by pyrosequencing 
for human biomarker EPB41L3 and viral late genomic 
regions of HPV16 (CpG sites in the L1 region: 6367, 6389 
and L2 region: 4238, 4247, 4259, 4268, 4275) and HPV18 
(CpG sites in the L2 region: 4257, 4262, 4266, 4269, 4275, 
4282), HPV31 (CpG sites in the L1 region: 6352, 6354) and 
HPV33 (CpG sites in the L2 region: 5557, 5560, 5566 and 
5572) as previously described [47]. Amplification of CpG 
sites were carried out using PyroMark PCR kits (QIAGEN, 
Germany) with 4 µl (8 µl) of converted DNA for EPB41L3 
(HPV assays) in a 25 µl volume with final concentration of 
reagents of 1× for Coral Load and PyroMark mix, 0.2 µM 
of PCR primers. PCR cycling conditions were 15 minutes at 
94°C, followed by 45 cycles of 94°C, 54°C, 72°C each for 
 
30 seconds and a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. The 
PCR products were pyrosequenced using a PyroMark™Q96 
ID (Qiagen) instrument as previously described [48]. All 
pyrosequencing runs included a negative control and 
positive controls of known methylation level (0%, 50% and 
100%) to allow standardized direct comparisons between 
different primer sets. For each marker, we calculated the 
average methylation level by taking the mean of all CpG 
positions. 
Statistical methods
Missing methylation values for HPV were imputed 
with the value of zero for any HPV negative sample. 
Missing methylation values for EPB41L3 and HPV 
positive samples were imputed using a median regression 
with age as a predictor and DNA methylation as an 
outcome. All statistical analyses were performed on the 
imputed data set [49]. Out of the 137 anal samples, six 
had missing methylation values for EPB41L3, 22 for 
HPV16L1, 31 for HPV16L2, 5 for HPV18, 11 for HPV31 
and none for HPV33. Of the 11 perianal samples, 4 had 
missing values for HPV16L1, 1 for HPV16L2 and 3 for 
HPV18. No value was missing for EPB41L3, HPV31 nor 
HPV33 (Supplementary Table 2).
Statistical analyses for the anal and perianal 
lesions were not combined. Spearman correlations were 
calculated between the markers. Since methylation values 
of HPV16L1 and HPV16L2 regions were correlated 
(Spearman r = 0.570, p < 0.0001), a variable called 
HPV16me was created by taking the geometric mean of 
DNAme levels of HPV16L1 and HPV16L2. 
Univariable and bivariable logistic models were 
fitted for statistically significant genes with the outcome 
measures 0 = <AIN and lgAIN, and 1 = hgAIN and cancer. 
The likelihood ratio (LR) χ2 statistic and its corresponding 
p-value, as well as the odds ratios (OR) with 95% 
confidence intervals were estimated and reported. 
Performance of the markers were assessed univariably by 
the LR χ2 test and the area under the curve (AUC) with 
95% confidence intervals (CI) using the Delong method 
[50]. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated at selected 
cut-offs (i.e. cut-off values giving the same sensitivity as 
HPV16 genotyping as well as at 90% and 95% sensitivity). 
A combined DNAme score of EPB41L3 and 
HPV16me was computed as a linear predictor of the fitted 
bivariable logistic regression. Confidence intervals for 
difference in sensitivities and specificities between the 
DNAme score at different cut-offs and HPV16 genotyping 
was computed using 2000 stratified bootstrap replicates as 
recommended by Carpenter and Bithell [51]. Cuzick tests 
for trend were applied to EPB41L3, HPV16me and the 
DNAme score to test for significant changes of methylation 
between the groups (<AIN, lgAIN, hgAIN, and cancer). 
Multiple imputations analyses were performed to test 
whether the single imputation led to any bias [52]. We used 
the multivariable imputation by chained equations (MICE) 
procedure (Classification and Regression Trees, CART) 
[53] with m = 100 multiple imputations [54]. Rubin’s rules 
were used to combine the multiply imputed estimates [55]. 
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the DNAme 
score and AUC (95% CI) were estimated for the 100 
multiple imputations separately and for their average. 
All p-values were two-sided with significance set 
at α < 0.05. Analyses were undertaken using R statistical 
software version 3.3.1 [56].
