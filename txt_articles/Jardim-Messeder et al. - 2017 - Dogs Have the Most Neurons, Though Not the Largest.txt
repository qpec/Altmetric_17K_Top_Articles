Carnivorans are a diverse group of mammals that includes carnivorous, omnivorous and
herbivorous, domesticated and wild species, with a large range of brain sizes. Carnivory
is one of several factors expected to be cognitively demanding for carnivorans due to a
requirement to outsmart larger prey. On the other hand, large carnivoran species have
high hunting costs and unreliable feeding patterns, which, given the high metabolic cost
of brain neurons, might put them at risk of metabolic constraints regarding how many
brain neurons they can afford, especially in the cerebral cortex. For a given cortical size,
do carnivoran species have more cortical neurons than the herbivorous species they
prey upon? We find they do not; carnivorans (cat, mongoose, dog, hyena, lion) share
with non-primates, including artiodactyls (the typical prey of large carnivorans), roughly
the same relationship between cortical mass and number of neurons, which suggests
that carnivorans are subject to the same evolutionary scaling rules as other non-primate
clades. However, there are a few important exceptions. Carnivorans stand out in that the
usual relationship between larger body, larger cortical mass and larger number of cortical
neurons only applies to small and medium-sized species, and not beyond dogs: we find
that the golden retriever dog has more cortical neurons than the striped hyena, African
lion and even brown bear, even though the latter species have up to three times larger
cortices than dogs. Remarkably, the brown bear cerebral cortex, the largest examined,
only has as many neurons as the ten times smaller cat cerebral cortex, although it
does have the expected ten times as many non-neuronal cells in the cerebral cortex
compared to the cat. We also find that raccoons have dog-like numbers of neurons in
their cat-sized brain, which makes them comparable to primates in neuronal density.

Dogs Have the Most Neurons
Comparison of domestic and wild species suggests that the neuronal composition of
carnivoran brains is not affected by domestication. Instead, large carnivorans appear
to be particularly vulnerable to metabolic constraints that impose a trade-off between
body size and number of cortical neurons.
Keywords: number of neurons, brain size, carnivorans, evolution, metabolic cost, domestication, predator-prey
INTRODUCTION
Carnivora is a remarkable order for comparative studies
of neuroanatomy because of the wide range of brain and
body size of its members, from the smallest, mouse-sized
least weasel to the 5-ton Southern elephant seal, overlapping
with most other mammalian clades. Carnivoran brains are
highly convoluted, although less so than cetartiodactyl and
primate brains of similar mass (Pillay and Manger, 2007;
Manger et al., 2010). Carnivorans are also highly diverse: they
can be social or solitary animals; carnivorous, omnivorous,
or even frugivorous;
domestic (such as
cats and
dogs)
or wild.
Carnivory comes with costs and benefits that are likely to
impose a delicate balance on the relationship between brain
and body. Although meat eating (and therefore hunting) is
not universal among carnivorans, hunting is a feature of this
clade that might impose a larger cognitive demand on the
brain than its counterpart: being preyed upon, since prey
species tend to find safety in numbers. It is thus tempting to
predict that cognitive demand has imposed positive pressure
on carnivorans for larger numbers of neurons compared to
their prey species, mostly artiodactyls, of similar or even larger
body and brain size. However, this possible advantage conferred
by larger numbers of neurons, particularly in the cerebral
cortex, would have to be balanced by the metabolic cost of
having more neurons. Daily sleep requirement and dietary
content are key elements here. While artiodactyls afford large
bodies through a large time investment in feeding on plant
leaves of low caloric content (Du Toit and Yetman, 2005), an
investment made possible by brains that can do with as few
as 3 h of sleep per day (Zepelin and Rechtschaffen, 1974),
carnivorans typically are inactive, possibly asleep, over 12 h per
day (Zepelin and Rechtschaffen, 1974). Moreover, carnivorous
species have highly variable feeding success (Gorman et al.,
1998), and hunting comes at a particularly high metabolic
cost for the largest predator species (Carbone et al., 2007),
factors which are likely to be a liability for a tissue such as
brain that has a consistently high metabolic requirement, and
is one of the most expensive tissues of the body (Aschoff
et al., 1971). Considering that the cerebral cortex is the most
expensive structure within the brain (Karbowski, 2007), and
that the energetic cost of the brain is proportional to its
number of neurons (Herculano-Houzel, 2011), it is conceivable
that large meat-eating carnivorans are particularly subject to
energetic constraints that might limit their numbers of brain
neurons, especially in the cerebral cortex. Such a limitation
would be expected to appear in the form of a trade-off between
body mass and number of brain neurons, as seen in large
non-human primates (Fonseca-Azevedo and Herculano-Houzel,
2012).
Carnivorans are divided into two main suborders, Caniformia
and Feliformia, both of which include species that were
domesticated, which has been suggested to alter the relationship
between brain and body size (Kruska, 2007). In phylogenetic
terms, carnivorans are closely related to artiodactyls (Bininda-
Emonds et al., 2007), animals that the large meat-eating
carnivorans
prey
upon.
We
have
previously
found
that
artiodactyls share with marsupials, afrotherians, glires, and
eulipotyphlans the scaling relationship between number of
cortical neurons and decreasing average neuronal density in
the cerebral cortex (which reflects larger average neuronal
cell sizes; Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2014), such that the
mass of the cerebral cortex scales faster than the cortex
gains neurons across species (reviewed in Herculano-Houzel,
2016). Primates, on the other hand, have larger neuronal
densities in the cerebral cortex than non-primates of similar
cortical mass (Herculano-Houzel, 2016), and therefore larger
numbers of neurons in similarly sized structures, which we
have proposed to convey a cognitive advantage to primates
(Herculano-Houzel, 2012). The relationship between body
mass and number of brain neurons is highly variable in
a clade-specific manner, but it is unlikely to contribute to
cognitive capabilities across species (Herculano-Houzel, 2017).
In contrast, all mammalian species examined so far share the
same relationship between the mass of major brain structures
and the numbers of non-neuronal cells that compose them
(Herculano-Houzel, 2014; Dos Santos et al., 2017), which
indicates that a single scaling rule has governed the addition
of non-neuronal cells to brain tissue for at least 166 million
years (Murphy et al., 2001, 2004; Bininda-Emonds et al.,
2007).
Here we determine the cellular composition of the brain
of
eight
carnivoran
species
(ferret,
banded
mongoose,
raccoon, domestic cat, domestic dog, striped hyena, lion,
and
brown
bear)
to
investigate
several
possibilities:
(1)
that
all
carnivoran
brains
and
substructures
follow
the
same non-neuronal scaling rules that apply to all other
therians examined so far, with similar non-neuronal cell
densities; (2) that different neuronal scaling rules apply to
carnivoran brains compared to other non-primate brains, in
particular such that carnivoran brains have more neurons
than artiodactyl brains of similar mass; (3) that domesticated
species diverge from wild species in their neuronal composition
and relationship to body mass; and (4) that carnivoran brains
exhibit evidence of an energetic trade-off between body mass
and number of brain neurons, especially in the cerebral
cortex.

Dogs Have the Most Neurons
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Here we use the isotropic fractionator (Herculano-Houzel
and Lent, 2005; Herculano-Houzel, 2012) to determine the
numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells that compose the
main structures (olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
cerebellum and rest of brain) of eight carnivoran species. The
isotropic fractionator consists of dissolving brain tissue in a
detergent solution to collect all cell nuclei in a suspension
that can be made isotropic by agitation. Numbers of nuclei
are determined by counting DAPI-stained samples under a
fluorescent microscope; numbers of neurons are then calculated
after determining the fraction of cell nuclei that express NeuN, a
universal neuronal nuclear marker (Mullen et al., 1992). While
some specific neuronal populations fail to express NeuN, such
as mitral cells in the olfactory bulb and Purkinje cells in the
hippocampus, those populations are negligible for the purpose
of determining total numbers of neurons in the major brain
structures and comparing them across species. Importantly, the
isotropic fractionator has been shown to yield results that are
comparable to those obtained with well-employed stereological
techniques, and in less time (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015b),
which is fundamental for the analysis of large brains.
Animals
We analyzed one brain hemisphere of one or two individuals
of the following eight species: domestic ferret (Mustela putorius
furo, n = 2), banded mongoose (Mungos mungo, n = 1), raccoon
(Procyon lotor, n = 2), cat (Felis catus, n = 1), dog (Canis
familiaris, n = 2), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena, n = 1),
African lion (Panthera leo, n = 1) and brown bear (Ursus arctos,
n = 1). These species are divided into the suborders Caniformia
(ferret, raccoon, dog, brown bear) and Feliformia (cat, banded
mongoose, striped hyena, lion; Figure 1). Ferret, cat and dog
individuals were bred in captivity, and are considered to represent
domesticated species; the banded mongoose, African lion and
brown bear specimens were obtained from the Copenhagen
Zoo after being euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (i.v) in
line with management decisions of the zoo; raccoons were wild
caught in Cook County, IL, United States, with permission from
The Cook County Forest Preserve Field Office in Chicago, IL,
United States as part of their routine pathogen surveillance
trapping; the striped hyena specimen was from an adult female
that was obtained from the Saudi Wildlife Authority following
veterinary euthanasia for unrelated medical reasons. Cat and
dogs were donated by their owners after the natural death of
the animals from non-neurological causes, with approval of the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Committee for Ethics in
the Use of Animals (process number 01200.001568/2013-87).
The animals obtained from the Copenhagen Zoo and from
Saudi Arabia were treated and used according to the guidelines
of the University of Witwatersrand Animal Ethics Committee
(clearance number 2012/53/1), which correspond with those of
the NIH for care and use of animals in scientific experimentation.
All other animals were killed by overdose with anesthetics
according to NIH (ferrets, raccoons) and Brazilian (cats and
dogs) veterinary guidelines. Once dead, the heads of the larger

and brown bear), and four to the family Feliformia (striped hyena, banded
mongoose, lion and cat).
species were removed from the body and were perfused through
the carotid arteries with a rinse of 0.9% saline (0.5 l/kg mass),
followed by fixation with of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (PB) (1 l /kg mass) (Manger et al., 2009). Ferrets,
mongoose and raccoons were perfusion fixed through the heart;
striped hyena, cat and dog brains were only immersion-fixed once
removed from the skull. All other brains were removed from the
skull after perfusion and post-fixed (in 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M PB) for 24–
72 h at 4◦C. The brains were then transferred
to a solution of 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB at 4◦C until they had
equilibrated and were then transferred to an antifreeze solution
containing 30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 30% distilled water
and 10% 0.244 M PB. Once again the brains were allowed
to equilibrate in the solution at 4◦C and were then moved
to a −20◦C freezer for storage prior to use in the current
experiments. Cat and dog brains were fixed by immersion in
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer for a total of
approximately 2 weeks.
Brains were removed, cut into left and right halves, one of
which was preserved for later histological studies, and the other
used for quantification with the isotropic fractionator. When
available (only for one raccoon and two ferrets), the olfactory
bulb (OB) was first separated from the brain by transection
immediately proximal to the main bulb. The cerebellum (CB)
was dissected by cutting the peduncles at the surface of the
brainstem. The brainstem was separated from the cerebrum by
cutting along a plane anterior to the colliculi and posterior to
the hypothalamus. The cerebrum was then cut into a series of
2 mm coronal sections, which were imaged on a flatbed scanner
for subsequent morphometric analysis. From these sections, the
hippocampus (HP) and the ensemble of diencephalon + striatum

were removed, and the remaining cerebral cortex (CX) was then
separated into gray and white matter components in each section.
Although counted separately, in the present study we concern
ourselves only with the totality of gray and white cortical matter,
to which we also add the hippocampus (CxT), for the sake of
comparison with previous studies on other mammalian species
(data provided in Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015a). As in those
studies, the ensemble of brainstem and diencephalon + striatum
is reported here as the rest of brain (RoB), and whole brain (BR)
refers to the sum of CxT, CB and RoB (that is, it excludes the
olfactory bulb, for the sake of consistency, since the olfactory
bulb is often not available for analysis; Herculano-Houzel et al.,
2015a). Each structure was weighed prior to homogenization. All
values in tables and graphs correspond to masses and cell number
estimates (or averages, where two individuals were available)
multiplied by two, to represent both sides of the brain, as
in our previous studies (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015a). This
procedure assumes that any differences between two sides of the
brain are negligible compared to the differences across species
that span several orders of magnitude in brain structure mass and
numbers of cells in the present study.
Morphometry
Images of all coronal sections of the cerebral cortex were
imported into StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience,
Williston, VT, United States) for tracing and reconstruction of
total and exposed cortical surface areas, and for Cavalieri analysis
to determine gray and white matter volumes, using formulas
described previously (Ribeiro et al., 2013; Kazu et al., 2014).
The average thickness of the gray matter was calculated as the
ratio between total gray matter volume and surface area, and
the folding index of the whole cortex was calculated as the
ratio between total gray matter surface area and exposed cortical
surface area, as in a previous study of cortical folding (Mota and
Herculano-Houzel, 2015).
Isotropic Fractionator
After weighing, each structure was sliced by hand and dissolved in
a solution of 1% Triton X-100 in 30 mM sodium citrate in a glass
Tenbroeck homogenizer (Pyrex, Corning, NY, United States)
until no visible particles remained. The homogenate and several
washes of the homogenizer were collected in a graduated cylinder
to which DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,
Invitrogen,
United States) was added in a dilution of 1:20 to 1:50 from a stock
solution of 20 mg/l. The volume of the suspension was rounded
up with PBS to a value that could be read with precision on the
graduated cylinder. After agitating the suspension, with care not
to form bubbles, typically four aliquots were taken and placed on
Neubauer improved chambers for counting under a fluorescent
microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Typically, numbers of nuclei
were counted in volumes of either 40 or 100 nl on the chambers,
whichever sufficed to ensure that at least 60 but not more than 300
nuclei were counted per aliquot. Four aliquots were considered
sufficient for a reliable estimate when they yielded a coefficient
of variation (CV) of less than 0.15. Typically, CVs were well
below 0.10. Isotropic fractionation thus provides estimates of
numbers of cells that are at least as reliable as those obtained with
stereology (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015b). Importantly, the
small CVs mean that our estimates of cell numbers have standard
deviations of less than 10% of the estimate for each specimen, in
contrast to the variation of orders of magnitude across species,
which is crucial given that we often have only one specimen of
each species available for analysis.
A sample of 500 µl of each suspension was then washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and reacted overnight with Cy3-
conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-NeuN antibody (ABN78C3,
Millipore, United States) at room temperature. The next day,
samples were washed and resuspended in PBS, and stained again
with a 1:20–
1:50 dilution of the stock solution of DAPI. One
aliquot of each sample was then inspected under the fluorescence
microscope for counting the fraction of at least 500 DAPI-labeled
nuclei that also exhibited NeuN immunoreactivity. This fraction
was multiplied by the total number of nuclei (and therefore cells)
previously obtained in that structure to yield the total number of
neurons. This procedure was followed for all species except for
the hyena, whose brain had been fixed in paraformaldehyde too
long to allow immunohistochemistry. In this species, the fraction
of neuronal nuclei was determined according to morphological
criteria: nuclei were considered to belong to neurons if they were
round (independent of size), exhibited loose chromatin and a
single nucleolus. The number of non-neuronal cells was obtained
by subtracting the number of neurons from the total number of
cells. Densities of neuronal and non-neuronal cells correspond to
the number of the respective cells in the structure divided by the
mass of the structure in milligrams (cells/mg).
Mathematical Analyses
All analyses were performed in JMP 9.0 (SAS, Cary, NC,
United States). Power functions were calculated by fitting a linear
function to log-transformed data using least-squares regression.
All analyses are performed separately for each mammalian clade;
clades are pooled only when regression analyses show that
scaling relationships are described by similar functions. Values
obtained for carnivoran species (n = 8) were compared to
those predicted for other non-primate mammalian species in
our dataset (n = 37) to test whether carnivorans conform to
the non-primate mammalian scaling rules for different brain
structures in relation to numbers of cells and to body mass.
The role of phylogenetic clustering is examined directly by
performing each analysis separately by clade. We do not use
methods to account for phylogenetic relatedness within each
clade because our main focus is on scaling relationships between
numbers of cells, cell density and structure mass as well as
their absolute numbers in key species, irrespective of any
presumed phylogenetic relationships among them. All raw data
are provided so that those interested in testing these relationships
within clades may do so.
RESULTS
In our sample of carnivoran species, body mass varied 437.5-fold
between ferret and brown bear, the smallest and largest species
examined, whereas brain mass varied only 58.0-fold, and the

total number of neurons in the brain only 23.7-fold, between
the same two species (Figure 2 and Table 1). The discrepancy
between the large variation in body mass and number of brain
neurons is consistent with the trend that we have revealed of
much faster increases in body mass than in numbers of brain
neurons (Herculano-Houzel, 2017). Moreover, the larger increase
in brain mass than in number of neurons across species is a first
indication that larger brains have more but also bigger neurons, as
found in non-primate species (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014b).
Data are summarized in Table 1.
Carnivorans have brain masses in the same range as
other non-primate mammals of similar body mass, including
artiodactyls, although the power function that relates brain mass
to body mass has a smaller exponent of 0.608 ± 0.051 in
carnivorans (Figure 3A) compared to 0.712 ± 0.071 in glires,
0.742 ± 0.061 in marsupials, 0.903 ± 0.082 in primates (all
exponents have p-values < 0.0001), but is not significantly
different from the exponent of 0.548 ± 0.038 (p = 0.0048)
in artiodactyls (unfilled symbols in Figure 3A). Notice that
although the exponent that relates brain mass to body mass
across carnivoran species is not significantly different from the
exponent that applies to artiodactyls, carnivorans, lion and hyena
in particular, have slightly smaller brains than artiodactyl species
of similar body mass (Figure 3A; the outlier artiodactyl in the
figure is the domesticated pig, which has a very large body mass
for its brain mass). Still, carnivoran brains have numbers of
neurons comparable to those found in non-primate mammals
of similar body mass, in particular artiodactyls, although clade-
specific exponents are again observed (Figure 3B). For instance,
the lion and hyena, at a total 3.9–
4.7 billion neurons, have the
same range of brain neurons as the blesbok and greater kudu, at
3.0–
4.9 billion neurons (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015a).
Within the brain, carnivorans have cerebella of comparable
mass and numbers of neurons to other non-primate mammals
of similar body mass, artiodactyls in particular (Figures 3E,F).
Interestingly, the rest of brain is somewhat smaller in mass
in carnivorans compared to artiodactyls of similar body
mass (Figure 3G), and also has significantly fewer neurons
in carnivorans compared to artiodactyls and actually several
other non-primate mammalian species of similar body mass
(Figure 3H). The raccoon, however, appears to have more
neurons in the rest of brain than predicted for its body mass;
indeed, removing the raccoon from the analysis improves the fit
of the function that describes how the number of neurons in the
RoB scales with body mass across carnivoran species (Figure 3H).
As found in other mammalian clades, larger carnivoran
species have larger cerebral cortices, whose mass is comparable
to that of artiodactyls and several other non-primate mammalian
species of similar body mass (Figure 3C). Strikingly, however,
larger carnivorans do not have increasingly more neurons in the
cerebral cortex. While ferret, mongoose and cat have increasingly
larger cortices (3.1 g, 9.3 g, and 24.2 g) with increasingly more
neurons (39 million, 116 million, and 250 million neurons,
respectively), we find that the lion has approximately as many
neurons in the cerebral cortex as the average found in dogs,
ca. 500 million neurons, despite a twice larger cortex in the
lion than in the dogs (139.9 g vs. 65.5 g; Table 1). Even
more strikingly, the brown bear has fewer neurons in the
cerebral cortex than these two species, 251 million neurons,
which is only about as many as the house cat, even though
the brown bear cortex had a nearly 10-fold larger mass of
222.0 g (Figure 3D and Table 1). The raccoon also stands out
in its number of cortical neurons, but in a different direction:
although the mass of the cerebral cortex in both raccoon and
cat is a similar 24 g, the raccoon cerebral cortex has an average
438 million neurons compared to 250 million neurons in the
cat (Table 1). Remarkably, of all the individuals we analyzed,
the one with the most neurons in the cerebral cortex was a
golden retriever dog (627 million neurons), followed by the
lion (545 million neurons), one of the raccoons (512 million
neurons), the striped hyena (495 million neurons), a smaller
dog of unspecified breed (429 million neurons) and a second
raccoon individual (395 million neurons). As a result, the
relationship between numbers of cerebral cortical neurons and
body mass in carnivorans seems to saturate around 500–
600
million neurons, and possibly adopt the shape of an inverted
U with only half as many neurons in the brown bear cerebral
cortex (Figure 3D), a pattern that has not been observed in any
other mammalian clade so far, where simple power laws apply
(Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014b).

FIGURE 3 | Structure mass and number of neurons scale with body mass across carnivoran species, except for the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex.
Plotted functions, in red, apply to carnivoran species and include the 95% confidence interval for the fit. Carnivoran species analyzed in this study are shown in
colors according to the key in the graphs; non-carnivoran species are depicted in gray (primates in triangles, artiodactyls as unfilled circles). (A) Brain mass scales as
a power function of body mass with exponent 0.608 ± 0.051 across carnivoran species (r2 = 0.959, p < 0.0001, n = 8, plotted), which is not significantly different
from the exponent of 0.548 ± 0.038 that applies across artiodactyls (r2 = 0.990, p = 0.0048, n = 4), but is significantly lower than the exponent that applies across
primates (0.903 ± 0.082, r2 = 0.931, p < 0.0001, n = 11). (B) The number of neurons in the brain scales as a power function of body mass with exponent
0.492 ± 0.054 across carnivoran species (r2 = 0.932, p = 0.0001, n = 8, plotted), which is indistinguishable from the exponent of 0.448 ± 0.115 that applies
across artiodactyls (r2 = 0.884, p = 0.0598, n = 4), but is significantly lower than the exponent of 0.777 ± 0.091 (r2 = 0.889, p < 0.0001, n = 11) that applies
across primates. (C) The mass of the cerebral cortex of carnivorans scales as a power function of body mass with exponent 0.631 ± 0.062 (r2 = 0.944, p < 0.0001,
n = 8, plotted), which is not significantly different from the exponent that applies across artiodactyl species (0.589 ± 0.028, r2 = 0.995, p = 0.0023, n = 4), although
smaller than the exponent that applies across primate species (0.942 ± 0.084, r2 = 0.926, p < 0.0001). (D) Whereas larger body mass is accompanied by larger
numbers of cortical neurons in all other mammalian clades examined, larger carnivorans do not have ever growing numbers of cortical neurons. The lion and striped
hyena have only as many cortical neurons as the average dog, which is only slightly more neurons than the raccoon, and the brown bear has even fewer cortical
neurons, about as many as found in the cat. (E) The mass of the cerebellum scales as a power function of body mass with exponent 0.606 ± 0.042 across
carnivorans (r2 = 0.972, p < 0.0001, n = 8, plotted), which is undistinguishable from artiodactyls (exponent, 0.612 ± 0.105, r2 = 0.944, p = 0.0282, n = 4), but
lower than the exponent of 0.739 ± 0.074 (r2 = 0.900, p < 0.0001, n = 12) that applies to primates. (F) The number of neurons in the cerebellum scales as a power
function of body mass with exponent 0.522 ± 0.056 (r2 = 0.935, p < 0.0001, n = 8, plotted), which overlaps with the power functions that apply to other clades
except for primates (exponent, 0.754 ± 0.073, r2 = 0.906, p < 0.0001, n = 13) and for eulipotyphlans (exponent, 0.873 ± 0.088, r2 = 0.970, p = 0.0022, n = 5).
(G) The mass of the rest of brain of carnivoran species scales as a power function of body mass with exponent 0.540 ± 0.035 (r2 = 0.976, p < 0.0001, n = 8,
plotted), which overlaps with the power functions that apply to other clades except for primates (exponent, 0.706 ± 0.076, r2 = 0.896, p < 0.0001, n = 12). (H) The
number of neurons in the rest of brain of carnivoran species scales as a power function of body mass with exponent 0.269 ± 0.042 (r2 = 0.872, p = 0.0007, n = 8),
or 0.282 ± 0.028 without the raccoon (r2 = 0.953, p = 0.0002, n = 7, plotted), which has more neurons in the rest of brain than expected for body mass. Although
the first exponent is not significantly different from the exponent that applies to artiodactyls (r2 = 0.227 ± 0.027, r2 = 0.973, p = 0.0136, n = 4), carnivoran species
seem to have fewer neurons in the rest of brain than artiodactyls of similar body mass (unfilled circles).

FIGURE 4 | Scaling of mass of brain structures with numbers of neurons in carnivorans. Carnivoran species analyzed in this study are shown in colors according to
the key in the graphs; non-carnivoran species are depicted in gray (primates in triangles, artiodactyls as unfilled circles). Plotted functions apply to the species
indicated for each graph and include the 95% confidence interval for individual values. (A) With the exception of the brown bear, ferret and raccoon, carnivoran
species conform to the power function that describes how the mass of the cerebral cortex scales as a power function of the number of cortical neurons with
exponent 1.588 ± 0.042 across non-primate, non-carnivoran species (r2 = 0.978, p < 0.0001, n = 35, plotted). The function calculated for carnivorans (without the
bear and raccoon) has an exponent of 1.311 ± 0.136 (r2 = 0.959, p = 0.0006, n = 6). (B) Again, with the exception of the brown bear, ferret and raccoon, the
density of neurons in the cerebral cortex of carnivoran species conforms to the power function that describes the scaling of neuronal density with the number of
cortical neurons of exponent –0.590 ± 0.040 across non-primate, non-carnivoran species (r2 = 0.865, p < 0.0001, n = 35, plotted). (C) With the exception of the
raccoon, carnivoran species conform to the power function that describes how the mass of the cerebellum scales as a power function of the number of cerebellar
neurons with exponent 1.283 ± 0.035 across the ensemble of afrotherians (minus the African elephant), artiodactyls and glires (r2 = 0.987, p < 0.0001, n = 20,
plotted). (D) With the exception of the raccoon, the density of neurons in the cerebellum of carnivoran species conforms to the power function that describes the
scaling of neuronal density with the number of cerebellar neurons of exponent –0.283 ± 0.035 across the ensemble of afrotherians (minus the African elephant),
artiodactyls and glires (r2 = 0.784, p < 0.0001, n = 20, plotted). However, the power function calculated for carnivoran species (minus the raccoon) fails to reach
significance (p = 0.2918). (E) The power function that describes how the mass of the rest of brain scales with the number of rest of brain neurons across artiodactyls
(minus the giraffe), eulipotyphlans and marsupials (exponent, 2.041 ± 0.143, r2 = 0.928, p < 0.0001; plotted) includes carnivoran species. (F) Carnivorans are
aligned with the scaling of neuronal density in the rest of brain with the number of rest of brain neurons that applies to the ensemble of artiodactyls (minus the giraffe),
eulipotyphlans and marsupials, with exponent –1.040 ± 0.142 (r2 = 0.769, p < 0.0001, n = 18, plotted).
In line with the smaller numbers of cortical neurons than
expected for the mass of the cerebral cortex in the largest
carnivorans examined, we find that while the banded mongoose,
cat, dog and hyena conform to the scaling relationship between
cerebral cortical mass and numbers of cortical neurons that
applies to non-primate mammals (Figure 4A, plotted function),
the lion has fewer neurons in its cerebral cortex than expected
for its cortical mass (although still within the 95% confidence

interval for individual values), and the brown bear falls well
outside the 95% confidence interval for that relationship, with
about
1/
4 the number of neurons predicted for its cortical
mass (Figure 4A, black). The ferret also has fewer neurons in
the cerebral cortex than expected for a non-primate, although
close to the 95% confidence interval (Figure 4A, green). In
contrast, the raccoon has more neurons in its cerebral cortex
than expected for a non-primate mammal of its cortical mass,
approaching the relationship expected for a primate (Figure 4A,
red circle and triangles). Indeed, while the banded mongoose,
cat, dog and hyena have neuronal densities in the cerebral
cortex that decrease predictably with increasing numbers of
cortical neurons according to the scaling relationship that
applies to other non-primates (Figure 4B), the raccoon has
an average neuronal density in the cerebral cortex that is
about three times the expected for a non-primate mammal
with its number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, approaching
neuronal densities found in primate cortices. On the other hand,
neuronal densities are several times smaller than expected in
the ferret, lion and especially the brown bear cerebral cortex
for their numbers of cortical neurons, compared to non-primate
mammals (Figure 4B).
In contrast to the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum of all
carnivorans in the dataset conforms to the neuronal scaling rule
that applies to the ensemble of afrotherians (minus the elephant),
glires, and artiodactyls – with the sole exception, again, of the
raccoon (Figure 4C). The relationship between cerebellar mass
and number of cerebellar neurons of carnivorans (excluding
the raccoon) can be described by a power law of exponent
1.100 ± 0.084 (r2 = 0.971, p < 0.0001) that is not significantly
different from linearity but is significantly different from the
exponent of 1.283 ± 0.035 that applies to the ensemble of
afrotherians (minus the elephant), glires and artiodactyls, which
we have proposed to represent the ancestral neuronal scaling rule
for the mammalian cerebellum (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014b).
In contrast, the raccoon cerebellum has nearly two times more
neurons than predicted for a mammalian species belonging to
those non-primate orders, conforming instead to the number of
neurons found in the cerebellum of a primate of similar cerebellar
mass. As expected from these relationships, neuronal densities in
the cerebellum of carnivorans, again with the exception of the
raccoon, conform to the relationship that applies to the ensemble
of afrotherians (minus the elephant), glires and artiodactyls
(Figure 4D), even though the power function relating neuronal
densities in the cerebellum of carnivorans to the number of
neurons in the cerebellum does not reach significance (p = 0.2918
without the raccoon; Figure 4D).
The mass of the carnivoran rest of brain scales with the
number of neurons in the structure raised to an exponent of
1.875 ± 0.134 (without the raccoon). This exponent is not
significantly different from the exponent of 2.041 ± 0.143
that

the
ensemble
of
artiodactyls,
marsupials
and eulipotyphlans (r2 = 0.928, p < 0.0001; Figure 4E;
Herculano-Houzel, 2017), and indeed the 95% confidence
interval for carnivorans includes these species (Figure 4E).
Rodents, afrotherians and primates depart from this relationship
(Figure 4E). Carnivoran species conform to the relationship
that describes how neuronal density in the RoB decreases with
increasing number of neurons in the RoB across artiodactyls,
eulipotyphlans and marsupials (Figure 4F).
Other Cells
The discrepancies between expected and observed numbers of
neurons in some carnivoran species, most notably the brown
bear, could in principle be due to aberrant immunoreactivity to
NeuN, which might fail to label all neurons in these species.
Similarly, the aberrantly large numbers of neurons found in
raccoon brain structures might in principle be due to non-specific
labeling of non-neuronal cells with the anti-NeuN antibody. In
these scenarios, any unlabeled neurons in the bear cerebral cortex
would be classified as non-neuronal cells and cause aberrantly
high numbers of non-neuronal cells in brain structures for their
mass; conversely, any labeled glial cells would be mistakenly
classified as neurons and lead to aberrantly low numbers of non-
neuronal cells in raccoon brain structures. These aberrations
would be particularly easy to spot since all major brain structures
(cerebral cortex, cerebellum and rest of brain) of all mammalian
species examined so far exhibit a relationship between structure
mass and number of other (non-neuronal) cells that can be
described by a single power function of near-linear exponent
1.051 ± 0.014 (r2 = 0.974, p < 0.0001; Figure 5A; Herculano-
Houzel, 2017).
Instead, we find that all carnivoran species and brain
structures analyzed conform to the relationship that applies
to all other mammalian species, including all raccoon brain
structures and the brown bear cerebral cortex (Figures 5A,B,
colored points). The conformity of carnivoran data to the
relationship that applies to all other mammalian species and
brain structures confirms the universality of the non-neuronal
scaling rules (Herculano-Houzel, 2014; Mota and Herculano-
Houzel, 2014). This conformity also makes it highly unlikely that
the unexpectedly small (or large) numbers of neurons in the
brown bear cerebral cortex (or raccoon brain structures) are due
to misclassification of cells as neurons.
As shown before (Herculano-Houzel, 2014), the ratio between
numbers of other cells and neurons is not a universal function of
structure mass across mammalian species, including carnivorans
(Figure 5C). However, this ratio does scale universally with
neuronal density in the structure across all mammalian species
analyzed so far, and all carnivorans studied here, including the
raccoon and brown bear, conform to that same relationship
(Figure 5D).
Domesticated vs. Wild Species
The dogs and cat individuals analyzed in this study were
domesticated animals, raised by families who donated the brains
after the animals died of natural causes, in contrast to other
animals that were either wild-caught (raccoon, hyena) or kept
in captivity (which might lead to larger body mass, but are
expected to be representative of wild species). Notably, we
find that these domesticated animals do not deviate from the
relationship between brain mass (or number of neurons) and
body mass that applies to carnivorans or to non-primates as a
whole (Figure 3). Additionally, cat and dog data points conform

FIGURE 5 | All carnivoran species and brain structures conform to the scaling of brain structure mass with numbers of other cells that applies universally across
other mammalian species. Cerebral cortex is shown in circles, cerebellum in squares, rest of brain in triangles. (A) Brain structure mass scales universally as a power
function of the number of non-neuronal (other) cells in the structures across non-carnivoran species (plotted function; exponent 1.051 ± 0.014, r2 = 0.974,
p < 0.0001), and all carnivorans conform to that relationship. (B) The density of other cells in the different structures of carnivoran brains overlaps with densities in
the same structures in other mammalian species, which scales very slowly as a power function of structure mass of exponent −0.075 ± 0.012 (r2 = 0.200,
p < 0.0001). (C) The ratio between numbers of other cells (which approximates the number of glial cells) and numbers of neurons in each structure is not a universal
function of structure mass across mammalian species and structures. (D) The ratio between numbers of other cells and neurons in each structure does vary
universally with average neuronal density in the structure across non-carnivoran species (plotted function, exponent −0.942 ± 0.019, r2 = 0.946, p < 0.0001,
n = 146), and all carnivoran species and brain structures conform to that relationship.
to the relationships between brain structure mass and number of
neurons in the structure that apply to other carnivoran as well as
various non-primate clades (see Figure 4). Both dog individuals
examined (a 7.45 kg mixed-breed and a 32 kg golden retriever)
had larger brains than the cat (brain mass in dogs, 58.4 and
114.5 g, respectively; cat, 34.8 g), and also more brain neurons
than the cat (dogs, 1.8 and 2.6 billion neurons, respectively; cat,
1.2 billion neurons). The same applies to the cerebral cortex of
the dogs, at 46.2 g with 429 million neurons and 84.8 g with
623 million neurons, against 24.2 g with 250 million neurons
in the cat. Strikingly, although the cerebral cortex of the golden
retriever was almost twice as large as the cortex of the smaller
dog, it only had 46% more neurons than the smaller dog cortex
(as expected from the non-linear scaling of cortical mass with
number of cortical neurons, Figure 4); if plotted separately, both
individuals conform to the scaling rules that apply to carnivoran
species shown in Figure 4, and as expected from their larger
cortical mass, both dogs had more neurons in the cerebral
cortex than the cat. Thus, the two most common species of
domesticated carnivorans do not deviate from the relationship
between cortical mass and number of neurons that applies both to
wild carnivorans and other non-primate species of similar body,
brain or cerebral cortical mass.
Distribution of Cortical Neurons into
Cortical Surface Area and Thickness
The apparently decreased number of neurons in the cerebral
cortex of large carnivorans for their cortical and body mass,
notably in the brown bear, could in principle be the result
of altered development that led to the generation of smaller
numbers of much larger neurons, resulting in the observed
lower neuronal densities but expected non-neuronal densities.
In that case, we might expect the cortical volume to still be
distributed into surface area and thickness following the same
scaling relationship that applies to other carnivorans, with
larger surface areas accompanied by slowly increasing cortical
thickness. Alternatively, if the unexpectedly small number of
neurons in the cerebral cortex of large carnivorans is due
to regressive phenomena after the cortex develops, such as
pronounced neuronal loss after cortical expansion, we should
find evidence of atrophy in the cerebral cortex of these species,

with cortical thinning for their surface area, and possibly also
a thicker cortex for their numbers of cortical neurons (in case
the maximal attained thickness is not entirely lost), compared
to the allometric scaling that applies to other carnivoran species
(but still the same expected non-neuronal densities). We thus
determined how the cortical volume was distributed into surface
area and thickness across carnivoran species, and how that
distribution related to numbers of cortical neurons.
We find that carnivoran cerebral cortices with larger surface
areas are also thicker, although cortical thickness increases more
slowly than surface area, as a power function of surface area
with exponent 0.262 ± 0.021 across carnivoran species (excluding
the brown bear; Figure 6A). While the raccoon and lion have
combinations of cortical surface area and thickness that match
the prediction for carnivoran species, the brown bear is a clear
outlier, with a cortical thickness that is too small for its surface
area, suggestive of cortical atrophy (thinning).
The distribution of cortical neurons into surface area and
thickness also suggest that a regressive phenomenon is in place.
Both the brown bear and lion cortices are thicker than expected
for the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex (Figure 6B,
black), consistent with cortices that had more neurons in early
development, attained adult-like morphology, but then lost
significant numbers of neurons (and along with them, lost part
of the width of the parenchyma, but not all of it). Similarly, the
surface area of the brown bear cerebral cortex is almost one order
of magnitude larger than expected for its number of neurons
(Figure 6C, black). This pattern is consistent with a reduction
in number of neurons in the cerebral cortex that occurred after
cortical expansion in development, when the brain attained its
adult density of non-neuronal cells, volume and surface area,
leading to partial thinning of the cerebral cortex but very little
loss of surface area.
In contrast to the bear, the raccoon has many more neurons
than predicted for a carnivoran species with either its cortical
thickness (Figure 6B, red) or its cortical surface area (Figure 6C,
red), even though its cortical thickness x surface area relationship
conforms to the pattern that applies to other carnivoran species
(excluding the brown bear; Figure 6A). The larger than expected
number of cortical neurons in the presence of the clade-
typical relationship between cortical thickness and surface area
is consistent with the generation of larger numbers of smaller
neurons (and thus the observed increase in neuronal density) in
the raccoon cerebral cortex, and possibly in the raccoon brain as
a whole (Figure 4).
Scaling across Structures
We have previously found that a single power function
undistinguishable from linearity and with a slope of around
4.0 describes the relationship between numbers of neurons in
the cerebellum and in the cerebral cortex across all mammalian
species so far, with the exception of the elephant, which has 44.8
neurons in the cerebellum for every neuron in the cerebral cortex
(Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014a). Most carnivorans analyzed
conform to the same relationship that applies to other mammals,
with the clear exception of the brown bear, which, like the
elephant, has a much larger ratio between numbers of neurons

according to the key in the graphs. All other mammals are depicted in gray
(light gray filled circles, glires; light gray unfilled circles, artiodactyls; dark gray

relationships for non-carnivoran clades are not plotted. (A) Average cortical

which remains 0.262 ± 0.022, p = 0.0003). The brown bear has a much
thinner cortex for its surface area compared to other carnivoran species; the
raccoon, in contrast, has the predicted combination of cortical surface area
and thickness for a carnivoran. (B) Average cortical thickness scales as a
power function of the number of cortical neurons with exponent

Dogs Have the Most Neurons
in the cerebellum and in the cerebral cortex of 36.9 (Figure 7A,
black). Remarkably, the lion and hyena also have fewer neurons
in the cerebral cortex than expected for their number of neurons
in the cerebellum, with 7.4 and 6.7 neurons in the cerebellum
for every neuron in the cerebral cortex, in contrast to ratios of
3.8 in the cat and raccoon, 3.2 in the dog and 2.7 in the banded
mongoose (Table 1).
Whereas the cerebral cortex and cerebellum gain neurons
proportionately across the vast majority of mammalian species, a
similar concerted scaling on numbers of neurons in the cerebral
cortex and rest of brain, with a constant ratio across structures,
is true only across glires, eulipotyphlans, small afrotherians, and
South American marsupials (Herculano-Houzel, 2016). Across
these species, a ratio of 2:1 is maintained between neurons in
the cerebral cortex:rest of brain, in what we have proposed to
be the ancestral allocation of neurons across these structures
(Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014b; Herculano-Houzel, 2016; Dos
Santos et al., 2017). Artiodactyls, primates and Australasian
marsupials deviate from this relationship, with larger ratios
between numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex and in the
rest of brain that may also increase with brain size. We find that
among carnivorans, only the ferret and the brown bear align
themselves with the first group (Figure 7B), with small ratios of
2.7 and 3.1 between numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex
and the rest of brain, respectively, while all other carnivoran
species analyzed align with the second group that includes
primates and artiodactyls, with larger ratios of 5.1 (mongoose)
to 9-11 (raccoon, dog and cat).
In line with the approximately 4:1 ratio between numbers
of neurons in the cerebellum and in the cerebral cortex
across most species but not the elephant and brown bear, we
find that the cerebellum and rest of brain also gain neurons
proportionately across glires, eulipotyphlans, small afrotherians,
and South American marsupials, maintaining a ratio of about 8:1
(Figure 7C). In contrast, artiodactyls, primates and Australasian
marsupials gain neurons in the cerebellum faster than in the
rest of brain (Figure 7C). Carnivorans again align with the
latter mammalian species, with faster addition of neurons to
the cerebellum than to the rest of brain, and thus larger ratios
between numbers of neurons in the two structures, compared to
glires, eulipotyphlans, and small afrotherians (Figure 7C).
DISCUSSION
Here we find that all carnivoran species examined match the
relationship between brain structure mass and number of non-
neuronal cells that has been found to apply to all mammalian
species examined so far (Dos Santos et al., 2017; Herculano-
Houzel, 2017). This relationship is a consequence of the lack of
systematic variation in the density of non-neuronal cells across
brain structures and species. Accordingly, none of the eight
carnivoran species analyzed deviated significantly from the non-
neuronal cell densities found previously in other mammalian
species. These findings are consistent with our proposition that
the mechanisms that regulate addition of non-neuronal cells
to brain tissue have been remarkably conserved in evolution,
FIGURE 7 | Scaling of numbers of neurons across brain structures in
carnivorans. (A) Except for the brown bear, carnivorans conform to the
relationship between numbers of neurons in the cerebellum and in the
cerebral cortex that apply to all mammalian species examined so far, including
primates, but excluding the African elephant (exponent, 0.928 ± 0.039,
undistinguishable from unity; r2 = 0.929, p < 0.0001, plotted). (B) Only the
ferret and brown bear conform to the scaling relationship that describes how
the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex varies as a power function of the

Afrotherians, with exponent 1.085 ± 0.064, undistinguishable from linearity
(excluding the African elephant; r2 = 0.940, p < 0.0001, n = 20, plotted). All
other carnivoran species, like primates, artiodactyls and Australasian
marsupials, have more neurons in the cerebral cortex than predicted for the
number of neurons in the rest of brain for glires, eulipotyphlans and small
Afrotherians. (C) Only the banded mongoose among carnivoran species
conforms to the scaling relationship that describes how the number of
neurons in the cerebellum varies as a power function of the number of

Dogs Have the Most Neurons
which indicates that average size of non-neuronal cells is tightly
controlled in development and does not accept much variation
across species or structures (Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2014).
The addition of non-neuronal cells in development with relatively
unchanging cell density across brain structures and species seems
to also apply to the raccoon and the brown bear, regardless of the
mechanisms that lead to their deviating neuronal densities.
Most of the carnivoran species analyzed also conformed to the
relationship between numbers of neurons and neuronal density
found to apply to other non-primate species, and thus also to the
resulting relationship between numbers of neurons and structure
mass (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014b; Herculano-Houzel, 2017).
However, the smallest (ferret) and largest (brown bear) species
had fewer neurons in the cerebral cortex than expected for the
mass of this structure in a non-primate mammal, a trend followed
also by the lion, which has a cortex with fewer neurons than the
golden retriever despite being nearly twice larger. As discussed
below, in the context of metabolic cost and the relationships
across cortical surface area, thickness and number of neurons, the
lower than expected neuronal densities restricted to the cerebral
cortex are suggestive of neuronal loss. Conversely, the raccoon
had systematically larger neuronal densities than expected in
all three structures examined –cerebral cortex, cerebellum and
rest of brain. In the context of a relationship between cortical
surface area and thickness that still matched that found for most
other carnivoran species, this finding suggests that the raccoon
brain develops with a larger number of smaller neurons than
expected for a carnivoran, resulting in larger numbers of neurons
than expected for a non-primate, approaching the numbers
found in primate species. Indeed, given only the relationship
between brain structure mass and numbers of neurons, one might
inadvertently take the raccoon for a primate.
Domestication
Comparisons of the brain mass vs. body mass relationship
between domesticated and wild species often yield parallel lines
with identical slopes, which have been interpreted as decreased
brain size in domesticated animals –that is, a downward shift
in the relationship (Kruska, 2007). One should keep in mind,
however, that a lateral shift in the relationship is equally possible,
with domestication inducing larger body masses rather than
decreased brain mass (which would be expected due to greater
food availability in captivity). Indeed, recent evidence suggests
that domestication of the chicken has led mostly to a larger body
mass, and to a lesser extent, to larger (not smaller) absolute brain
mass, mainly due to enlargement of the cerebellum (Henriksen
et al., 2016). Untangling the two possibilities –increased body
mass for the size of the brain or decreased brain mass for the
size of the body –is not feasible when brain size and body size
are the only variables available, and when only one species is
considered in its wild and domesticated versions. By bringing in
other variables and examining other carnivoran as well as other
non-primate species, here we show that laboratory-raised ferrets
as well as the most common domesticated species, cat and dog,
do not have smaller brains or fewer neurons than expected for
their body mass. Similarly, we have found that the pig shares a
relationship between brain mass and number of neurons with
other artiodactyl and non-primate species, although it is an
outlier in its much larger body mass for its number of brain
neurons (Kazu et al., 2014). We thus have no reason to believe
that domesticated animals have become any different from other
carnivorans in the allometric scaling of their brains (although
the ferret, the smallest carnivoran species examined, might be
affected by energetic constraints because of its size; see below).
Intraspecific variation is an important issue to consider in this
context. We know that it can be large even in species considered
to be fairly homogeneous such as the laboratory mouse, in which
body mass still varies across young adult animals of same sex
and age by a factor of 2, and brain mass varies by a factor of
1.33 (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015a). Importantly, we found
that larger mice do not have significantly larger brains than
smaller mice, and those mouse individuals with larger brains
or brain structures do not necessarily have more neurons than
individuals with smaller brains or brain structures (Herculano-
Houzel et al., 2015a). The lack of a strong correlation across
individuals mirroring the power functions that apply across
species can be attributed to the finding that across mouse
individuals, those with more neurons in a brain structure also
have smaller, not bigger, neurons. This discrepancy suggests a
fundamental difference between developmental and evolutionary
patterns of brain variation (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2015a).
Indeed, it is well established that allometric relationships that
apply across species usually do not apply within species, at least
not with the same exponents (Armstrong, 1990). The lack of
continuity between intra- and interspecific comparisons might
still be simply due to the typically much smaller range of variation
across individuals of a given species, precluding the calculation
of accurate relationships – although that should be possible
to compensate for with larger sample sizes. Dogs, with their
enormous variation in body and brain size (at least 15-fold and 2-
fold, respectively; Wosinski et al., 1996), offer a great opportunity
to put to test how brain scaling compares within and across
species. While we found that the two dog individuals examined
did fit the scaling relationships observed for other carnivoran
species, and indeed for many non-primate mammalian species,
we couldn’
t aim to address the issue of how intraspecific scaling
compares to interspecific scaling here due to the difficulty of
obtaining large numbers of individuals for a proper study of
intraspecific variation.
For all other species, one might be concerned that, except for
the raccoon and ferret (n = 2 for each), we could only examine
a single individual. While we acknowledge that intraspecific
variation not only is significant but also is a very interesting topic
in its own right, we still expect it to be negligible when compared
to the variation over 2 orders of magnitude in body mass across
carnivoran species that we examine here. Thus, while expanding
the analysis to a larger number of individuals of each species
would of course have been ideal, we believe it is reasonable to
expect that individual variation in most species other than the
dog is unlikely to affect the results we report here.
Cognitive Implications
We and others have suggested that the absolute number of
neurons in the cerebral cortex are a major determinant of

the cognitive capabilities of different species (Roth and Dicke,
2005; Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014a; Herculano-Houzel, 2017).
Testing that prediction requires data on cognitive performance
that can be compared across species. It is only recently that data
obtained with systematic comparative analyses have started to
become available, although most studies continue to focus on
particular clades, mostly primates (Deaner et al., 2007; MacLean
et al., 2014; Kabadayi et al., 2016) and birds (MacLean et al., 2014;
Kabadayi et al., 2016). Cognitive performance in carnivorans was
recently addressed specifically by Benson-Amram et al. (2015).
Across these species, even though brain size relative to body
mass is a significant predictor of success in opening a puzzle
box, species with larger absolute brain volumes also tended
to be better than others at opening the puzzle box (Benson-
Amram et al., 2015). Other studies found that absolute brain
size (or absolute size of the cerebral cortex) across primates is a
much better correlate of task performance than encephalization
quotient (Deaner et al., 2007; MacLean et al., 2014). Given
that larger primate brains are composed of increasing numbers
of neurons (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2007; Gabi et al., 2010),
improved performance thus correlates with increased numbers of
neurons across species, and possibly across clades as well. Indeed,
small-brained corvids show similar performance to much larger-
brained primates (Kabadayi et al., 2016), which can be explained
by their similarly large numbers of pallial neurons despite the
difference in brain size (Herculano-Houzel, 2017). It is thus likely
that the larger the number of neurons found in the cerebral cortex
of a carnivoran, the more cognitively capable the species is.
The twice larger absolute number of neurons we find in
the cerebral cortex of the dog compared to the domestic cat
suggests that dogs have a cognitive advantage over cats – and
raccoons, despite their smaller brain size compared to dogs,
should have similar capabilities to dogs. Unfortunately, no dogs,
cats or raccoons were examined in the comprehensive study
of carnivorans by Benson-Amram et al. (2015), nor were cats
and raccoons included amongst the few carnivorans studied by
MacLean et al. (2014), only dogs. While our finding of larger
numbers of cortical neurons in dogs than in cats may confirm
anecdotal perceptions of dog owners and animal trainers as well
as unpublished reports that dogs are easier to train and therefore
“
more intelligent”(Greene, 2011), cat owners would probably
protest, and rightly so. Any argument about their cognitive
capabilities at this point will be largely a matter of opinion
until direct, systematic comparisons of cognitive capacity are
performed across these and other species. Moreover, given that
both cats and dogs seem to obey the same neuronal scaling rules
for the cerebral cortex, any difference in cognitive capabilities
between them due to differences in numbers of cortical neurons
would be tied to differences in resulting brain size, suggesting
that cat-sized dogs, if they have cat-sized brains, might have only
as many cortical neurons as domestic cats. Still, our data allow
us to predict that, with their larger numbers of neurons in the
cerebral cortex, dogs of the sizes examined here should have more
complex and flexible cognition than cats.
It was once believed that dogs had evolved special forms
of cognition relative to their wild counterparts, wolves (Frank,
1980), but the same author later concluded that his thesis was
incorrect and no such difference existed (Frank, 2011). That
proposition was, however, taken up by other authors, who argued
that dogs had evolved forms of “
human-like social cognition”
(Hare et al., 2002). However, Wynne (2016) argues that “
dogs are
better viewed as equipped with the same cognitive skills as many
other species, but, living in proximity to and often being totally
dependent on human beings, they acquire exquisite sensitivity to
human action”(Wynne, 2016). Although the domestic cat has
been a favored non-primate model for neurophysiological studies
of sensory systems and perception, not much has been done to
examine its cognitive capabilities, especially in direct comparison
to the domestic dog (Shreve and Udell, 2015). These authors
have called attention to how popular articles often present cat
cognition with a negative spin, whereas research suggests that
domestic cats, like dogs, have developed a range of behaviors
that facilitate their interaction with humans. This is an issue that
can only be solved by direct comparisons of cognitive capabilities
between cats and dogs –though this is only a particular example
of how badly needed are systematic comparisons of cognition
and behavior across species that can be related to quantitative
neuroanatomy (Herculano-Houzel, 2017).
Raccoons have long been considered highly intelligent
animals, “
shrewd,” “
curious” and “
mischievous,” and were
initially classified as related to the fox, then as species of monkey,
until being granted their current status as carnivorans (reviewed
in Pettit, 2010). Because of their cognitive “
fame,” raccoons
became the focus of several studies on their behavior in the
early days of psychological research in the beginning of the
20th century (Pettit, 2010). Placing raccoons on a comparative
scale with other animals, however, requires direct comparisons
of cognitive performance across species that are still lacking.
It is interesting to combine our finding that the raccoon is an
outlier in its numbers of neurons in all brain structures compared
to other non-primates, with larger, primate-like numbers of
neurons instead, with the estimate that the raccoon actually has
a relatively small prefrontal cortex in comparison to carnivorans
with similar or even smaller brain and body sizes (Arsznov and
Sakai, 2013). For example, the prefrontal cortex represents only
10% of the raccoon brain volume vs. 20% in the coatimundi, even
though the raccoon brain is twice as large as the brain of the
coatimundi (Arsznov and Sakai, 2013). It is possible that the large
number of cortical neurons and the larger than expected neuronal
density in the raccoon are at least partly related to an expanded
somatosensory cortex (Welker and Seidenstein, 1959; Welker and
Campos, 1963). We are currently examining how numbers of
neurons in the prefrontal region of the cortex compare across
raccoons and other species, but our current results suggest that
the relatively small size of the raccoon prefrontal cortex may
be compensated by its unexpectedly high neuronal density, thus
resulting in a large absolute number of prefrontal neurons,
regardless of an expanded somatosensory cortex.
Along the same lines, we were initially surprised to find
that carnivorans align with artiodactyls in the neuronal scaling
relationship that applies to their cerebral cortex, such that
the lion, a predatorial carnivoran, has only about as many
neurons in the cerebral cortex as large artiodactyl species that
this species preys upon. The similarity fails to support the

existence of positive selective pressure for larger numbers of
neurons in predators compared to their prey species, which
would presumably be associated with the cognitive requirements
of hunting. In this context, however, two possibilities remain that
we are now investigating: (1) that similar numbers of neurons
are distributed differently in surface area and thickness in
carnivorans and artiodactyls, such that the number of functional
cortical areas, and therefore cortical cognitive output, may be
strikingly different across them; and (2) that for similar numbers
of cortical neurons, carnivorans have a larger proportion of
these neurons, and therefore a larger absolute number of them,
in prefrontal, associative regions involved in goal setting and
planning.
The Largest Carnivoran Cortices Do Not
Have the Most Neurons: Evidence of
Trade-Off with Body Mass
While being a large carnivoran brings the advantage of not being
preyed upon, it comes with a high energetic cost that has been
calculated to impose evolutionary constraints on body size in
these predators (Carbone et al., 1999, 2007). The large terrestrial
carnivorans are constrained to preying on large species, which
have limiting low population densities (Carbone et al., 1999),
and are further limited by prey biomass and productivity (i.e.,
prey biomass produced per year; Carbone and Gittleman, 2002).
As a result, the largest carnivorans are particularly vulnerable
to decreases in prey abundance: these lead to a five to six fold
greater decrease in population density of the largest carnivorans
compared to the effect on the population density of smaller
carnivoran species (Carbone et al., 2011). Similarly, carnivorans
must hunt for longer in areas of low prey density or productivity
(Carbone et al., 2011).
Hunting in itself is metabolically costly, particularly when
hunting for large prey, which requires high speed chases, as the
energetic cost of hunting is proportional to chase speed; as a
result, large-prey specialists expend about twice as much energy
during hunting as a small-prey specialist of same body mass
would (Carbone et al., 2007). Hunting large prey is so costly
that there is a limit to the additional hunting effort that large
carnivorans can still afford to make up for eventual shortage
or loss of prey to competitors. For example, losing just 25%
of their prey to scavenging hyenas would cause African wild
dogs, an average-sized species (ca. 25 kg body mass), to need to
increase their daily hunting time from 3.5 h to over 12 h (Gorman
et al., 1998). Such an increase which would be physiologically
untenable: because of the high metabolic cost of high-speed
hunting, African wild dogs already require more than five times
the predicted basal daily energy expenditure for a mammal of
their body mass, which is close to the calculated physiological
limit on sustainable metabolic rates of around 6–
7 times the basal
metabolic rate (Gorman et al., 1998). Because any increase in the
time spent hunting greatly adds to overall energy expenditure,
which offsets the possible gains of additional hunting hours,
large predatory carnivoran species, with already extremely high
hunting costs, are particularly susceptible to changes in feeding
ecology. Additionally, the cost of locomotion for the very largest
carnivoran species, the lion and polar bear, are 2–
3 times higher
than expected for mammals of a similar size (Chassin et al., 1976;
Hurst et al., 1982).
The brown bear, the largest carnivoran species we analyzed,
is omnivorous: this species both eats grass, berries, bulbs and
tuber, and hunts. Adding vegetables to their diet, however, is
still not enough to make brown bears invulnerable to food
availability, as their body mass depends on it. For example, the
largest North American brown bears occur in populations that
feed on abundant spawning salmon, which does not occur in
Europe, and European brown bears are larger in the North than
in the South, which appears to be related to greater availability
and use of protein-rich meat and insects in the North (Swenson
et al., 2007). Female body mass is highly positively correlated with
reproductive success across populations, which also indicates that
obtaining enough calories is of great consequence (Hildebrand
et al., 1999).
Taken together, the energetic costs of being a large carnivoran
suggest that balancing their energy budgets requires adjustments
that reduce energy expenditure (Carbone et al., 2007). One such
adjustment is behavioral inactivity (in which animals may or may
not be asleep): lions, for example, spend over 90% of the day
inactive (Schaller, 1972). Another feature that minimizes cost
is hibernation, which is found in bears and lowers metabolism
enough that the body is not damaged by the prolonged anorexia,
to the point where not even the expected loss in bone density and
muscular mass and strength from prolonged inactivity occur in
hibernating bears (Hershey et al., 2008; McGee-Lawrence et al.,
2009, 2015).
We suggest that the reduction in the number of neurons
in the cerebral cortex of the largest species we examined, the
brown bear, and possibly in the lion as well, is related to the
large metabolic costs of maintaining a large body mass, and
where applicable, needing to spend energy hunting to maintain
that mass. We have previously shown that the metabolic cost of
the brain is proportional to its number of neurons, regardless
of brain size, and that neurons in the cerebral cortex cost on
average 10 times as much energy as neurons in the cerebellum
(Herculano-Houzel, 2011). Thus, cerebral cortical neurons are
expected to be both more vulnerable to caloric shortage than
other brain neurons, and to also contribute more to decreasing
total metabolic cost when their numbers are reduced than the loss
of other neuronal populations would. In this regard, we interpret
the finding of a much larger than expected ratio between numbers
of neurons in the cerebellum and in the cerebral cortex in the
brown bear as a result of an abnormally decreased number of
neurons in its cerebral cortex, given that the brown bear has only
slightly fewer neurons in the cerebellum than expected for its
mass, but far fewer neurons in the cerebral cortex than expected
for its mass. This is in contrast to the elephant, the only other
exception so far to the average 4 neurons in the cerebellum
to every neuron in the cerebral cortex, in which the cerebral
cortex fits the expected relationship between number of neurons
and structure mass for afrotherians, while the cerebellum has
more neurons than expected for its mass (Herculano-Houzel
et al., 2014a). The discrepancy in the cerebellum alone indicates
that the elephant has an enlarged number of cerebellar neurons,

possibly related to somatosensory and motor processing of the
trunk (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014a). A reduced number of
cortical neurons in the largest carnivoran species might either
be a direct developmental response to caloric shortage, or an
evolutionarily incorporated strategy of elimination of cortical
neurons that occurs in the largest animals, regardless of their
individual developmental history. At the moment we cannot
distinguish between these possibilities, although they are not
mutually exclusive.
It is possible that the smaller than expected number of
cortical neurons found in the brown bear is directly due to
hibernation, rather than to the metabolic limitation that leads
to hibernation. Differentiating between these two possibilities
would require determining cellular composition of the brain in
pre- and post-hibernation animals, and in juvenile bears that
have never hibernated. However, as mentioned above, the very
advantage of hibernation seems to be that metabolism is lowered
enough that the body is not damaged by the prolonged anorexia,
and thus we find that neuronal loss during this period of lowered
metabolic rate would be unlikely, just as there is no loss in bone
density of muscular mass in hibernating bears (Hershey et al.,
2008; McGee-Lawrence et al., 2009, 2015). Moreover, despite the
presumptive thinning of the cortical parenchyma, there were
no signs of adult (such as age-related) cortical atrophy, such as
gaps between the gyri in the brown bear cortex. Similarly, we
found no signs of neuronal loss in another hibernating animal
we analyzed previously, the gray squirrel, compared to non-
hibernating rodent species (Herculano-Houzel et al., 2011).
Carbone et al. (2007) have suggested that the daily energetic
expenditure scales differently with body mass between small and
large carnivoran species. Interestingly, the limit between the two
groups is at a body mass of 14.5–
21 kg, where domestic dogs
are found. Domestic dogs have adapted to the starch-rich diet
that is typical of modern humans (Axelsson et al., 2013), which
might protect them from metabolic constraints that apply to
other carnivorans. Importantly, we find that dogs do not have
more cortical neurons than predicted for a non-primate of its
cortical mass, but just as many as expected. It will be interesting to
determine if wolves, with a larger brain size than most domestic
dogs, also have as many cortical neurons as predicted, or if
there already is evidence that, because of the dependence on
hunting, they are subject to a trade-off between body mass and
number of cortical neurons as the brown bear and, possibly, the
lion.
Remarkably, at the low end of the body mass range of
carnivorans, small predators such as the ferret are also expected
to face metabolic constraints, due to the costly strategy of feeding
on much smaller prey (Carbone et al., 2007). Their higher than
expected daily energy expenditure might thus impose a trade-off
on the number of cortical neurons found in the ferret cerebral
cortex, which we have also found to be lower than expected for the
cortical mass of this species, with significantly reduced neuronal
densities. Expanding this study to a larger number of carnivoran
species spanning the full range of body masses in the clade will
help elucidate whether trade-offs between numbers of cortical
neurons and body mass do occur as a rule in both the upper and
lower limits of body size in carnivorans.
