Abstract
Our current understanding of immunology was largely defined in laboratory mice because of 
experimental advantages including inbred homogeneity, tools for genetic manipulation, the ability 
to perform kinetic tissue analyses starting with the onset of disease, and tractable models. 
Comparably reductionist experiments are neither technically nor ethically possible in humans. 
Despite revealing many fundamental principals of immunology, there is growing concern that mice 
fail to capture relevant aspects of the human immune system, which may account for failures to 
translate disease treatments from bench to bedside1–8. Laboratory mice live in abnormally 
hygienic “specific pathogen free” (SPF) barrier facilities. Here we show that the standard practice 
of laboratory mouse husbandry has profound effects on the immune system and that environmental 
changes result in better recapitulation of features of adult humans. Laboratory mice lack effector-
differentiated and mucosally distributed memory T cells, which more closely resembles neonatal 
than adult humans. These cell populations were present in free-living barn populations of feral 
mice, pet store mice with diverse microbial experience, and were induced in laboratory mice after

 co-housing with pet store mice, suggesting a role for environment. Consequences of altering 
mouse housing profoundly impacted the cellular composition of the innate and adaptive immune 
system and resulted in global changes in blood cell gene expression patterns that more closely 
aligned with immune signatures of adult humans rather than neonates, altered the mouse’s 
resistance to infection, and impacted T cell differentiation to a de novo viral infection. These data 
highlight the impact of environment on the basal immune state and response to infection and 
suggest that restoring physiological microbial exposure in laboratory mice could provide a relevant 
tool for modeling immunological events in free-living organisms, including humans.
Given reported species-specific differences in immune responses1–8 we wished to compare 
memory CD8 T cell distribution and differentiation between mice and humans. CD8 T cells 
are critical for adaptive immune control of intracellular infections and cancer and their 
distribution and differentiation relate directly to their function. We assessed nonlymphoid 
distribution by examining available specimens of normal cervical tissue from premenopausal 
adult women. We found that CD8 T cells were integrated within the mucosa, exhibited a 
tissue resident memory T cell (TRM) phenotype9, and comprised ~15,000 of every million 
cells (Fig. 1a&b and data not shown). This agrees with previous reports that adult (unlike 
neonatal) human nonlymphoid tissues are abundantly populated with TRM
10–12. In contrast, 
CD8 T cells were almost completely absent from cervical sections from adult inbred 
laboratory mice (C57BL/6 strain) housed under SPF conditions (Fig. 1a&b). We then 
compared major CD8 T cell lineages in blood, focusing on species-specific markers that 
define functionally homologous populations of naïve, central memory (TCM), and terminally 
differentiated effector memory CD8 T cells (TEM or TEMRA) (Fig. 1c). Relative to adult 
humans, memory CD8 T cells were much scarcer in laboratory mice, and almost entirely 
comprised of TCM rather than TEM or TEMRA. Also in contrast to humans, laboratory mice 
lacked CD27lo/Granzyme B+ effector differentiated memory CD8 T cells that are thought to 
respond most immediately to infection (Fig. 1c)13,14. Thus, memory CD8 T cells in 
laboratory mice were less frequent and strikingly different from those in adult humans, and 
in fact, appeared much more similar to neonates (Fig. 1c&d and extended data Fig. 1).
Mice are amongst the closest relatives of primates, but diverged from human ancestors 65–
75 million years ago15. We wished to test whether the differences we observed between mice 
and adult humans were intrinsic to all mice (divergent immune system evolution), or unique 
to laboratory mice. To this end, we trapped free-living barn populations of feral mice and 
also procured mice from commercial pet stores. Compared to inbred SPF laboratory mice, 
feral and petstore mice were enriched in antigen-experienced CD8 T cells, particularly those 
that displayed a differentiated effector memory phenotype (Fig. 2a). More extensive 
phenotypic characterization of differentiation markers previously defined among CD8 T 
cells in laboratory mice revealed that naïve (CD44lo) cells were phenotypically identical 
between SPF and petstore mice (Fig. 2b). These data validated the consistency of markers 
used to discriminate between naïve and antigen experienced CD8 T cell populations in the 
different mouse cohorts. However, examination of antigen-experienced (CD44hi) CD8 T 
cells indicated enrichment of granzyme B+ and CD27lo cells in petstore mice, as well as 
other signatures of terminal effector differentiation including CD62Llo, CXCR3lo, 
CD127lo, and 1B11hi phenotypes. However, cell size (Fsc), proliferation (Ki67), and other

 measures of recent antigen exposure (CD69 and PD-1) were equivalent between both 
cohorts of mice, indicating that differences in CD8 T cell differentiation state were not due 
to an ongoing acute infection in petstore mice. Moreover, the relative density of CD8 T cells 
in petstore mouse nonlymphoid tissues was up to 50-fold greater than that observed in SPF 
laboratory mice (Fig. 2c,d).
Petstore mice recapitulated aspects of human CD8 T cell differentiation and distribution that 
were absent in laboratory mice. These differences could be solely due to genetics, or 
dependent on environment. Inbred mice are genetically homogenous, which permits refined 
approaches and reductionist comparisons not possible in outbred populations, but may be 
accompanied by mutations that impair immune system development or function. Laboratory 
mice live in filtered microisolator housing that provides extreme hygiene16. Conditions are 
so clean, mice harboring fatal immunodeficiency diseases often thrive in these environments 
due to the absence of pathogen exposure. Thus, modern husbandry has evolved to the point 
in which laboratory mice, the standard model for biomedical research, exhibit far less 
infectious experience than free-living (i.e., dirty) humans or mice naturally acquire17–20. To 
test whether environmental conditions might impact the differentiation state and distribution 
of CD8 T cells, we co-housed inbred laboratory mice with petstore mice, which were not 
raised in ultra hygienic barrier facilities. Adult petstore mice were introduced into cages 
containing adult laboratory (C57BL/6 strain) inbred mice. Within four weeks of co-housing, 
the CD44hi cells increased from 15% to ~70% of CD8+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC), and plateaued at ~50% after eight weeks for the duration of the study (Fig. 3a,b). 
22% of laboratory mice died during the first eight weeks of co-housing, after which no 
further mortality was observed (Fig. 3c).
Serology was performed for common mouse pathogens, and revealed exposure to viral, 
bacterial, and helminth pathogens (although not murine cytomegalovirus, see extended data 
table 1). Co-housing resulted in a constitutive increase in highly differentiated effector 
memory cells that matched signatures in outbred mice and humans, including the accrual of 
granzyme B+ and CD27lo cells (Fig. 3d). Moreover, nonlymphoid tissues became populated 
by CD8 T cells expressing a TRM phenotype (Fig. 3e and extended data Fig. 2). Expanding 
the cellular analysis beyond CD8 T cells revealed extensive and profound changes to many 
innate and adaptive immune cell lineages throughout the host and increased levels of serum 
antibody (Fig. 3f&g and extended data Fig. 2). Furthermore, Principal Components Analysis 
of PBMC gene expression data in the space of all detected genes (~18000) revealed a spatial 
shift of cohoused samples away from laboratory samples and towards pet store along PC1 
(Fig. 3h). Together, these data demonstrate that co-housing profoundly impacted the status 
of the immune system.
Our data suggested that laboratory mice have features in common with neonatal humans, 
and that altering the environment reproduced phenotypic signatures of adult humans. To test 
this hypothesis more broadly, we queried expression-profiling data of maternal and neonatal 
cord PBMC from an unaffiliated study21 with petstore vs. laboratory and cohoused vs. 
laboratory signatures via gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Fig. 4a and 4b). The top 400 
genes up-regulated in petstore mice showed highly significant enrichment in human adult

 expression data, while the top 400 down-regulated genes showed enrichment in neonates. 
Laboratory mice acquired this gene expression program after co-housing.
To more deeply interrogate transcriptional concordances between petstore mice, cohoused 
mice, and adult humans relative to laboratory mice and neonatal humans, we applied GSEA 
with the ImmuneSigDB database of immunological signatures22. We then used leading edge 
metagene analysis of GSEA results to identify modules of coregulated genes upregulated in 
human adult vs. cord PBMC, and those found in pairwise comparisons of laboratory, 
petstore, and co-housed mice. Overlap between the resulting metagenes was used to identify 
global similarities between each dataset. We observed highly significant overlaps between 
metagenes upregulated in adult vs. cord human blood and metagenes upregulated in petstore 
or co-housed vs. laboratory mouse blood. These included numerous pathways related to 
innate and adaptive immune functions (Fig. 4c, extended data Fig. 3 and supplemental data 
Tables 1&2). Conversely, metagenes upregulated in human cord blood overlapped with those 
upregulated in laboratory mice. Thus, these functional modules represent a major axis of 
similarity in immune status between petstore mice and adult humans relative to laboratory 
mice and neonatal humans, and can be conferred to laboratory mice via cohousing with 
petstore mice.
We next questioned whether mouse husbandry affected immune responses. We performed 
challenges with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (LM), which is a bacterial 
infection often used to gauge immune function in laboratory mice. Compared to laboratory 
mice, both petstore and co-housed mice exhibited a >10,000 fold reduction in bacterial 
burden three days after challenge, which actually matched bacterial control in laboratory 
mice that were previously vaccinated against LM (Fig. 4d and extended data Fig. 4a). Hence, 
physiological exposure to environmental microbes revealed that C57BL/6 mice exhibit 
considerably more innate resistance to LM infection than indicated from studies using SPF 
animals. The impact of mouse husbandry on infection control extended to a cerebral malaria 
model (Plasmodium berghei ANKA, Fig. 4e, extended data Fig. 4b). Lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus infection is an oft-used model to examine critical questions of 
adaptive T cell differentiation, including the regulation of memory precursor vs. short lived 
effector cell (MPEC vs. SLEC) development23,24. In this case, we observed that the 
proportion of MPECs and SLECs were significantly impacted by mouse husbandry (Fig. 4f 
and extended data Fig. 4c).
Experiments in mice have informed much of our understanding of immune regulation, and 
have directly informed the development of life-saving clinical therapies. However, our study 
reveals an unanticipated impact of SPF husbandry on the immune system. Our study does 
not advocate for an end to SPF studies. But for studies of the immune system it is ironic that 
such an immunologically inexperienced organism has become de rigueur, as our data show 
that this compromises development of an adult-like human immune system. For maximizing 
opportunities for bench to bedside translational medicine, it may be opportune to add dirty 
mice to our repertoire of investigative tools. Much like the analysis of truly sterile “germ-
free” mice has revealed how influential the commensal flora is on “normal” physiology and 
immune system function, our study suggests that the immune system in mice may not be 
fully “normalized” without more complete microbial exposure10. Indeed, just as many

 autoimmune diseases do not manifest in genetically predisposed mice in the absence of 
commensal flora, certain infectious experiences have been shown to induce heterologous and 
innate immune memory, trigger autoimmune disease, and affect transplantation 
tolerance 25–30. Forward genetic screens are ongoing in mice to reveal the function of 
immunological genes, and it might be beneficial to conduct these screens in a “dirty” mouse 
model.
More generally, dirty mice might be valuable for interrogating aspects of the hygiene 
hypothesis, immune function and treatment from disease in the settings of transplantation, 
allergy, autoimmunity, and vaccination, and perhaps in disparate diseases that may have an 
immune system or inflammatory component (such as cardiovascular disease and cancer)4. 
Such mice could supplement current models to either increase translation potential for 
human disease or to better inform efficacy of preclinical prophylactic and therapeutic 
modalities, without sacrificing powerful experimental tools and approaches that are 
unavailable to human studies.
Material and Methods
Mice, Cohousing and Infections
Petstore mice were purchased from a nation-wide retailer. Feral mice were trapped on a 
horse farm or rural outdoor petting zoo in Minnesota or Georgia, USA. Male or female 
petstore mice were introduced into the cages of six to eight week old C57BL/6 mice of the 
same sex purchased from the National Cancer Institute. Co-housing occurred within a 
BSL-3 facility. Age-matched C57BL/6 laboratory mice maintained in SPF facilities served 
as controls. Number of animals was determined based on previous experience in order to 
reach statistical significance. All animals surviving the experimental treatment were 
included in the final analysis. No method of randomization was used to allocate animals to 
experimental groups. Investigators were not blinded to the group allocation during 
experiments. Listeria monocytogenes (LM) was grown in tryptic soy broth containing 
streptomycin to log phase growth. The indicated groups of mice were infected i.v. with 8.5 × 
104 CFU of wild type LM (provided by John Harty, University of Iowa). Bacterial load in 
the spleen and liver was determined 3 days post-challenge as previously described31,32. LM 
immune mice were generated by primary infection with LM-OVA, (provided by Hao Shen, 
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine)33 5 months prior to secondary challenge. 
Plasmodium berghei ANKA (provided by Susan K. Pierce, NIH/NIAID) was propagated by 
passage in mice and blood collection. A million parasitized RBCs were injected i.p. into the 
indicated mice. Parasitemia was determined by flow cytometry on peripheral blood34. All 
mice were used in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees 
guidelines at the University of Minnesota.
Human specimens
Adult PBMC samples were collected from healthy volunteers at the University of 
Minnesota35. Fresh cord blood samples were acquired from the Clinical Cell Therapy 
Laboratory at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. The PBMC isolation has been 
described in detail elsewhere36. After isolation, cells were frozen in 107cells/ml aliquots in a

 cryopreservative solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for future phenotyping. Premenopausal, human 
cervical tissue was obtained from the Tissue Procurement Facility (BioNet, University of 
Minnesota). Cervical samples were frozen roughly 1–2 hours after surgical resection. 
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The University of Minnesota Institutional 
Review Board approved all protocols used.
Intravascular staining, leukocyte isolation and phenotyping
An intravascular staining method was used to discriminate between cells present in the 
vasculature from cells in the tissue parenchyma37. Briefly, animals were injected i.v. with 
biotin/fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD45 through the tail vein. Three minutes post-
injection, animals were sacrificed, and tissues were harvested as described before38. Isolated 
mouse cells were surface-stained with antibodies against CD3 (145-2C11), CD45 (30F-11), 
CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), NKp46 (29A1.4), Ly6G (1A8), MHC II (Ia-Ie) 
(M5/114.15.2), CD8α (53-6.7), CD45.2 (104), CD4 (RM4-5), CD62L (MEL-14), CD44 
(IM7), CD69 (H1.2F3), CD103 (M290), Ly6C (AL21), CD43 (1B11), CD43 (S7), CD27 
(LG.3A10), PD-1 (RMP1-30 and J43), KLRG1 (2F1), CXCR3 (CXCR3-173), CD127 (SB/
199), α4β7 (DATK32), F4/80 (Cl-A3-1), CXCR5 (2G8), CD38 (90), IgM (RMM-1), IgD 
(11-26c.2a), GL7 (GL7), CD19 (6D5), B220 (RA3-6B2). Isolated human cells were surface-
stained with antibodies against CD8α (3B5), CD45RA (HI100), CCR7 (G043H7), CD27 
(O323), and CD3 (SK7). All of the above antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences, 
Biolegend or Affymetrix eBiosciences. Cell viability was determined using Ghost Dye 780 
(Tonbo Biosciences). Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated granzyme B (Invitrogen), Fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Ki67 (Invitrogen) and AF488 conjugated goat anti-mouse 
IgG (H+L) antibody intracellular staining was performed using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit 
(BD Pharmingen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Intracellular staining for 
transcription factors was performed using Transcription factor staining buffer set 
(Affymetrix eBiosciences) with antibodies against Foxp3 (FJK-16s), T-bet (4B10), Eomes 
(Dan11mag), Gata3 (L50-823), Rorγt (Q31-378) following manufacturer’s guidelines. 
Single positive staining for T-bet, Gata3, and Rorγt were used to determine Th1, Th2, and 
Th17 lineages, respectively. FITC-conjugated mouse lineage cocktail (Tonbo Biosciences) 
was used in combination with other recommended lineage markers to identify various innate 
lymphoid cell subsets. The stained samples were acquired using LSRII or LSR Fortessa flow 
cytometers (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Infectious agent screening
Laboratory mice, cohoused laboratory mice (after at least 30 days of cohousing) and petstore 
mice were screened using EZ-spot and PCR Rodent Infectious Agent (PRIA) array methods 
(Charles River Laboratories). Dried whole blood, feces, oral swab and body swabs were 
collected as per the sample submission guidelines of Charles River Laboratories.
Tissue freezing, immunofluorescence and microscopy
Harvested murine tissues were fixed in 2% Paraformaldehyde for 2hrs before being treated 
with 30% sucrose overnight for cryoprotection. The sucrose treated tissue is embedded in 
tissue freezing medium OCT and frozen in an isopentane liquid bath. Human cervix 
specimens were embedded in tissue freezing medium OCT and snap frozen in an isopentane

 liquid bath. Frozen blocks were processed, stained, imaged, and enumerated by quantitative 
immunofluorescence microscopy as described39,40 and included staining with the following 
antibodies: anti-mouse CD8β (YTS156.7.7), anti-human CD8β (SIDI8BEE, eBioscience), 
anti-mouse CD4 (RM4-5), anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), and counterstaining with DAPI 
(mouse) or Cytox Green (human) to detect nuclei.
Serum antibody quantification
Mouse serum antibody titers were quantified using Ready-Set-Go! ELISA kits (Affymetrix 
eBioscience) following manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA isolation and Microarray hybridization
For each sample, 1–3×106 PMBCs were used for each RNA extraction. Cells were first 
homogenized using QIAshredder columns (Qiagen) then RNA was then extracted using 
RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Following quality control, total 
RNA samples were processed using the Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification Kit for 
High-Throughput RNA Amplification for Array Analysis. Samples were loaded onto the 
MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) and hybridized Beadchips were scanned 
using the Illumina iScan Beadarray Reader. Basic quality metrics were checked using 
Illumina Genomestudio.
Bioinformatics analysis
Prior to analysis, mouse microarray data were quantile normalized using preprocessCore 
(Bioconductor) and batch correction was performed using the ComBat algorithm. Principal 
components analysis was performed in R. Raw human adult and neonatal cord PBMC 
microarray data were obtained from a previous unaffiliated study profiling the peripheral 
blood of 72 smoking or non-smoking women and the cord blood of their neonates (Gene 
Expression Omnibus, accession code GSE27272)21. Human microarray data were quantile 
normalized as previously described. To obtain lists of genes upregulated or downregulated 
between Petstore, Cohoused, and Laboratory cohorts, differential expression analysis was 
performed using the linear modeling and empirical Bayesian method implemented in limma 
(Bioconductor). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed as described 
previously41. LEM (Leading Edge Metagene) analysis was performed downstream of GSEA 
to yield groups of genes, termed metagenes, which are coordinately upregulated in a given 
phenotypic comparison and common to multiple enriched gene sets. Briefly, for a given 
phenotypic comparison, gene set enrichment analysis was performed using ImmuneSigDB, 
a curated compendium of 4872 gene sets describing a wide range of cell states and 
experimental perturbations from immunology literature22. The top 150 significantly 
enriched gene sets, as restricted by an FDR < 0.25 and ranked by P < 0.05, were subsetted 
for their leading edge genes. These genes were then clustered into metagenes using non-
negative matrix factorization. The significance of overlap between pairs of metagenes was 
determined using a Fisher exact test (P < 1e-05). Metagenes were functionally annotated 
based on the significance of overlap between member genes and Gene Ontology terms 41, as 
measured by hypergeometric test using the GOrilla enrichment analysis tool42.

 Statistics
Data were subjected to D’Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test to determine if they 
are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. If a Gaussian model of sampling was satisfied, 
parametric tests (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test for two groups and one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni multiple comparison test for more than two groups) 
were used. If the samples deviated from Gaussian distribution, non-parametric tests (Mann-
Whitney U test for two groups, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison test for 
more than two groups) were used unless otherwise stated. Variances between groups were 
compared using F test and found to be equal. All statistical analysis was done in GraphPad 
Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). P-values <0.05 are considered significant and are indicated 
in figure legends.
