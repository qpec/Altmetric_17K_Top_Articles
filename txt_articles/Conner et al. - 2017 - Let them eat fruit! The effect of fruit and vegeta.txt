Abstract
This study tested the psychological benefits of a 14-day preregistered clinical intervention to
increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption in 171 low-FV-consuming young adults (67%
female, aged 18–25). Participants were randomly assigned into a diet-as-usual control condi-
tion, an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) condition involving text message reminders
to increase their FV consumption plus a voucher to purchase FV, or a fruit and vegetable
intervention (FVI) condition in which participants were given two additional daily servings of
fresh FV to consume on top of their normal diet. Self-report outcome measures were depres-
sive symptoms and anxiety measured pre- and post-intervention, and daily negative and pos-
itive mood, vitality, flourishing, and flourishing behaviors (curiosity, creativity, motivation)
assessed nightly using a smartphone survey. Vitamin C and carotenoids were measured
from blood samples pre- and post-intervention, and psychological expectancies about the
benefits of FV were measured post-intervention to test as mediators of psychological change.
Only participants in the FVI condition showed improvements to their psychological well-being
with increases in vitality, flourishing, and motivation across the 14-days relative to the other
groups. No changes were found for depressive symptoms, anxiety, or mood. Intervention
benefits were not mediated by vitamin C, carotenoids, or psychological expectancies. We
conclude that providing young adults with high-quality FV, rather than reminding them to eat
more FV (with a voucher to purchase FV), resulted in significant short-term improvements to
their psychological well-being. These results provide initial proof-of-concept that giving young
adults fresh fruit and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits even over a brief
period of time.

 Introduction
The physical health benefits of fruit and vegetables are well established. People who eat more
fruit and vegetables (FV) have better cardiovascular health [1], reduced risk of some cancers
[2], and greater longevity than people who eat fewer FV [3]. There is also growing evidence
that people who eat more FV have better mental health. Higher consumption of FV is corre-
lated with several psychological outcomes including a lower incidence of depression and anxi-
ety [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], greater happiness [10, 11], higher life satisfaction [10, 12, 13, 14], and
greater social-emotional well-being or “flourishing” [15]. This growing body of research is
intriguing because it suggests that the foods people eat have a much broader impact beyond
the notable physical health benefits. However, studies examining the psychological benefits of
FV have been predominantly observational and epidemiological to date, with a relative lack of
intervention research that would support a causal link.
Prospective research designs provide some evidence that increasing FV consumption may
cause psychological benefits. At least five longitudinal studies found that dietary improvements
including a diet higher in FV (i.e., a Mediterranean diet) predicted subsequent reductions in
depression among adolescents, adults, and older adults [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. However, these
studies have not typically separated the effects of FV from other components of the Mediterra-
nean diet such as olive oil or fish. More relevant are the results from Mujcic and Oswald [14]
who analysed the prospective relationship between FV consumption and happiness and life
satisfaction from the 2007 and 2009 waves of the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics
in Australia (HILDA) study, a nationally representative panel survey of over 12,000 people
aged 15 years and older. They found that that increased FV consumption predicted greater
“happiness gains” and increases in life satisfaction over the two years. Respondents with the
largest increases in FV reported the greatest gains in well-being over time [14]. The opposite
direction–happiness or life satisfaction predicting subsequent increases in FV consumption–
was not found.
Only a few intervention studies have tested the psychological benefits of increased FV con-
sumption directly. One study of 271 low-income participants in the UK showed improvements
in the composite measure of mental health from the Rand Short Form Survey (SF-36 [21])
from baseline to 8-weeks follow up in participants who underwent brief nutritional and behav-
ioral counselling to increase their FV consumption [22]. Another study of 35 healthy young
men showed that eating two kiwifruits every day for six weeks resulted in modest improve-
ments to mood as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire [6, 23].
Mood improvements corresponded with increased vitamin C levels, were only significant for
the young men with poorer mood at the start of the study, and were mainly driven by reduc-
tions in fatigue, increases in “vigor” (which included reports of feeling cheerful, energetic,
lively, and full of pep), and decreases in depressive symptoms (trend only) [6]. A third study of
100 university students showed that snacking on one piece of fruit (either an apple, large clem-
entine, or banana) each day for 10 days resulted in reductions in fatigue and anxiety compared
to daily snacking on chocolate wafers or potato chips [24]. Taken together, these studies sup-
port a causal link between FV and various measures of mental health and mood. Yet each
study is limited in some way–either by a small sample size [6], exclusive focus on fruit [6, 24],
or use of a composite mental health index that does not separate aspects of mental health such
as depression and anxiety [22]. And, to our knowledge, no intervention study has tested
whether FV improves aspects of well-being aside from the impact on ill-being. It is important
to fill this gap given the growing observational and prospective evidence linking FV to indica-
tors of well-being such as happiness and life satisfaction [10, 12, 13, 14], optimism [25], and
flourishing [15].

 Accordingly, in the present study, we tested the psychological benefits of a 14-day preregis-
tered clinical intervention designed to increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption among
low-FV-consuming young adults [26]. We defined low-consuming young adults as anyone
aged 18 to 25 who reported eating fewer than 3 combined servings of fruit and vegetables per
day. This cut-off reflects lower intake than the minimum national dietary guidelines of 5 com-
bined servings of FV per day [27]. We implemented our intervention on a young adult popula-
tion because young adults typically have the lowest FV consumption of all the age groups [28,
29, 30] and they are developing early autonomy over their health behaviors [31]. More details
on the development of the intervention can be found in Brookie et al. [26]. To briefly summa-
rize, we ran a three-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 171) with three conditions: a
diet-as-usual control condition in which participants were asked to maintain their regular
food consumption for two weeks; an ecological momentary intervention condition (EMI), in
which participants were sent twice daily text-messages that utilized a variety of behavioral
change techniques to help them increase their fruit and vegetable consumption to at least 5
combined servings a day (plus they were given a voucher to purchase the FV); or a fruit and
vegetable condition intervention (FVI), in which participants were given a bag of two weeks’
worth of fruit and vegetables (kiwifruit or oranges depending on the season, apples, and car-
rots) and were asked to consume at least two additional servings (1 fruit and 1 vegetable) on
top of their regular daily FV consumption. Participants in both intervention conditions
reported significantly higher daily FV consumption (3.7 servings / day) compared to control
participants (2.8 servings / day), and compared to their own baseline (2.5 servings / day) when
FV was reported nightly for two weeks using a smartphone-accessed survey [26]. Moreover,
blood samples taken before and after the intervention showed that participants in the two
experimental groups had small gains in vitamin C levels and plasma carotenoids, suggesting
that the self-reported changes in FV consumption were legitimate. Vitamin C and carotenoids
are the most consistently reliable biomarkers of FV consumption and have been used to reflect
intake of nutrient-dense FV [32].
The current paper presents the psychological outcomes of that same two-week intervention
reported in Brookie et al. [26]. The primary outcome measures were depressive symptoms and
anxiety measured pre- and post-intervention, as well as negative and positive mood, vitality,
and flourishing measured nightly through a smartphone survey. Our choice of methodology—
smartphone tracking of daily psychological outcomes for two weeks—reflected our desire to
minimise memory-based reporting and maximise sensitivity to detect possible group differ-
ences in mood and well-being changes over time [33]. Our choice of outcome measures
reflected a desire to measure both the negative and positive aspects of mental health [34]. We
predicted that participants in the two experimental conditions (EMI and FVI) would show sig-
nificant improvements in the psychological outcomes relative to participants in the control
condition, and that the benefits of FV consumption would be stronger for the measures of
well-being (positive mood, vitality, flourishing). Although previous research has linked FV to
lower levels ill-being–such as reduced depression [9, 35] and anxiety [9, 24]–there is more evi-
dence linking FV to higher levels of well-being such as positive mood, happiness, and flourish-
ing [6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. We also included three unregistered “wild-card” variables in the
daily smartphone survey–self-reported curiosity, creativity, and motivation–which we grouped
under the umbrella term of flourishing behaviors. Higher FV consumption was previously
shown to correlate with greater curiosity and creativity in young adults [15], but research has
not yet established whether that relationship is causal. And, no research has tested whether FV
might improve perceptions of motivation, a key correlate of vitality [36]. Lastly, we tested
whether changes in the psychological outcomes would be mediated by two key biomarkers
(vitamin C and carotenoids) and/or psychological expectancies. The mechanisms linking FV

 to well-being are unknown, but they may be due to key micronutrients like vitamin C and
carotenoids, which act as cofactors for dopamine and other neurotransmitters involved in pos-
itive motivational states [37], or possibly due to positive psychological expectancies such as the
perception that eating FV is virtuous or will make you feel better [38].
Materials and methods
Participants and procedure
This is the same sample reported in Brookie et al. [26]. The experimental design and primary
outcome measures were registered before recruitment with the Australia New Zealand Clinical
Trials Registry (ANZCTRN12615000183583). Recruitment began in March 2015 and follow-up
data was collected by the end of November 2015. Fig 1 shows the flow of participants through-
out the trial and explanations for drop outs. Participants were 171 young adults (56 men; 115
women), 18 to 25 years old (M = 19.43, SD = 1.45) who identified as European (64%), Asian
(18%), Māori or Pacific Islander (8%), or another or mixed ethnicity (11%). Participants were
students at the University of Otago, New Zealand who were recruited through the Psychology
Department’s experimental participation program and reimbursed with partial course credit
(N = 135, 79%) or recruited through a student employment agency and reimbursed with a small
cash payment (N = 36, 21%). Inclusion criteria included being in the young adult age range
(18–25 years), having an Internet capable smartphone, identifying as low-FV-consuming (no
more than 3 combined servings of FV per day), not being on any anti-depressant medication,
and having no known FV allergies. All participants provided written consent to take part by
reading and signing their name on a paper consent form (later kept in secured storage). The
study and consenting procedures were approved by the University of Otago Human Ethics
Committee (#15/010).
More detail about the intervention, including the development and complete list of inter-
vention text-messages for the EMI condition, is described in Brookie et al. [26]. Participants
attended an initial laboratory session and completed a computerized baseline survey that mea-
sured demographics and symptoms of depression and anxiety, among other measures. That
evening, participants completed their first of 14 daily diary surveys delivered by hyperlink to
their smartphones. The survey measured their daily mood and well-being (see Measures) and
was accessible between 7:00 pm and 1:00 am. The next morning, participants attended a clinic
in the Human Nutrition department where they were measured for height and weight using
standardised techniques [39] and gave a fasting baseline blood sample (4 ml). Immediately
after the clinic visit, participants randomly assigned to the EMI condition began to receive
their twice-daily intervention messages to increase FV over the next 13 days. Participants in
the FVI condition received their bag of FV to consume for the next 13 days. Participants in the
control condition were asked to maintain their normal diet. After the 13 intervention days,
participants returned to the Human Nutrition clinic and gave a follow up blood sample (4 ml),
and completed follow-up measures of depressive symptoms and anxiety.
Measures
Preregistered psychological outcome measures were depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative
mood, positive mood, vitality, and flourishing. Curiosity, creativity, and motivation were not
registered ahead of time and were therefore considered exploratory.
Demographics and covariates.
Demographic measures were age, gender, and ethnicity.
Height and weight measured during the first clinic visit was used to calculate body mass index
(BMI) as a possible covariate. Smoking status was tested as a covariate in the vitamin C analysis
because smoking increases the metabolism of vitamin C [40]. In the follow-up survey,

 participants were asked “How often do you currently smoke” by choosing one of five response
options: I don’t smoke now, less than once a month, at least once a month, at least once a week,
or at least once a day. Participants who smoked at least once a week or day were coded as
smokers (1); all others were coded as non-smokers (0).

 Depressive symptoms.
Depressive symptoms were measured before and after the inter-
vention using the 20-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; [41]).
Participants rated their depressive symptomology “in the past week” on a 4-point scale ranging
from 0 (Rarely or none of the time, < 1 day) to 3 (Most or all of the time, 5–7 days). Responses
were summed to give a total depressive symptom score ranging from 0 to 60 (pre α = 0.89;
post α = 0.90).
Anxiety.
Anxiety symptoms were measured before and after the intervention using the
7-item Anxiety sub-scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; [42]). Partici-
pants rated each item on how they “felt recently, including today” on a 4-point scale ranging
from 0 (Not at all or Only occasionally) to 3 (Very often or Most of the time). Responses were
summed to give a total anxiety score ranging from 0 to 21 (baseline α = 0.77; follow up α =
0.78).
Negative and positive mood.
The daily survey included 3-item measures of negative
mood (sad, anxious, angry) and positive mood (relaxed, happy, enthusiastic), which captured a
range of activation states [43]. Participants rated each adjective on how they “felt today” on a
5-point Likert scale from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely). Responses were averaged across the
three items each day for a measure of daily negative mood (α = 0.34) and daily positive mood
(α = 0.42). The within-person reliabilities for the daily survey data were computed using pro-
cedures for nested data recommended by Nezlek [44]. Because of low reliability, we also ana-
lysed the items separately in supplementary analyses.
Vitality.
The daily survey included a modified version of the 4-item energy/fatigue scale
of the Rand 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36 [21, 45]). Participants were asked “today”: Did
you feel full of life? Did you have a lot of energy? Did you feel worn out? Did you feel tired? We
changed the first item from the original “full of pep” to “full of life” to better capture feelings of
vitality and to connect with a young-adult population. Each item was rated on a 6-point scale
labelled None of the time, A little of the time, Some of the time, A good bit of the time, Most of the
time, and All of the time. Responses were coded from 0 to 100 in 20-point intervals following
SF-36 guidelines (reverse-scoring worn out and tired), and summed within each day so that
highest total score was 100, indicating higher vitality that day. The modified scale showed ade-
quate within-person reliability (α = 0.70).
Flourishing.
The daily survey included a shortened 3-item version of the 8-item Flourish-
ing Scale that assesses feelings of engagement, purpose in life, and social-emotional connected-
ness, which previous research shows loads on a single “flourishing” factor [46]. We selected
the three highest loading items from a previous dataset and adapted the items for a daily for-
mat. The three items were: Today, I was engaged and interested in my daily activities. Today, I
led a purposeful and meaningful life. Today, I was a good person and lived a good life. Partici-
pants rated each item on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 4 (Neither agree
nor disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree). Responses were summed each day for a measure of daily
flourishing ranging from 1 to 21 (α = 0.70).
Flourishing behaviors.
The daily survey included three items answered on a 5-point
Likert scale from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely). The first item measured curiosity: How curious
were you today? Did you seek out new things or experiences; look for opportunities to challenge
yourself and grow as a person; or embrace the unfamiliar. This question was guided by the con-
tent of the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory II [47]. The second item measured creative
activity: How creative were you today? Did you come up with novel or original ideas; express
yourself in an original and useful way; or spend time doing artistic activities like, music, painting,
writing, etc. This question was based on scientific definitions of creativity [48] and has been
used in previous research [15]. The third item measured perceived motivation: How motivated
were you today? Did you work towards your goals, or feel driven today? This question was

 designed to capture a broad, conscious sense of motivation including working towards goals
[49]. Responses to the three items were averaged each day for an index of daily flourishing
behaviors (α = 0.28). Because of low reliability, these items were also analysed separately in
supplementary analyses.
Vitamin C and carotenoids.
A 4 ml fasting blood sample was taken before and after the
intervention. Samples were kept in dark conditions on ice and centrifuged within 1 hour of
collection. Plasma aliquots were stored at -80C until analysis. Plasma vitamin C was assessed
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection, treated
with reducing agent to recover total vitamin C. Total plasma carotenoids were assessed
spectrophotometrically (for full blood processing details see [26]). Four people were unable to
provide a post-intervention blood sample; therefore, analyses with vitamin C and carotenoids
reflected a sample size of 167.
Psychological expectancies.
The follow-up survey included questions about participants’
beliefs about the benefits and virtues of eating FV, as well as candy and fried foods as distractor
items, and how participants thought eating these foods made them feel over the last two weeks.
For analysis, we focused on the three items related to FV consumption: Do you feel that eating
fruits and vegetables is virtuous (righteous, good, moral)? Do you feel better about yourself when
you eat more fruits and vegetables? Did you feel that eating fruits and vegetables improved your
mood during these two weeks? Each question was answered on a 5-point Likert scale from 0
(Very slightly/not at all) to 4 (Extremely). We added these expectancy items one third of the
way through data collection; therefore, analyses with these items reflected a sample size of 121.
Analyses and results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the demographic and outcome variables. The
depression and anxiety scores were within norms for this population [50]. Compliance with
the smartphone surveys was high at 90% (12.6/14 surveys completed; range 9 to 14 surveys).
There were no differences between the control, EMI, and FVI conditions on survey compli-
ance (F(2,168) = 0.91, p = 0.405), gender (χ2(2, N = 171) = 0.129, p = .938), age (F(2,168) =
1.24, p = 0.291), or BMI (F(2,168) = 1.18, p = 0.309). However, the conditions varied in ethnic
composition (χ2(2, N = 171) = 8.31, p = .016) with more non-Europeans in the control condi-
tion (51%) than the two intervention conditions (EMI 29%; FVI 28%). Therefore, ethnicity
was included as a covariate in the analyses. The analyses consisted of two Analyses of Covari-
ance (ANCOVA) for the measures of depressive symptoms and anxiety, and six growth curve
models for the daily measures of positive mood, negative mood, vitality, flourishing, and flour-
ishing behaviors. Based on these seven main analyses, we applied a Bonferroni correction to
the alpha level (.05/7 tests) to account for multiple hypothesis testing (p = .007).
Table 2 presents the raw scores for depressive symptoms and anxiety for participants in
each condition. There were no differences at baseline between the three groups (depressive
symptoms, F(2,168) = 0.19, p = 0.830; anxiety, F(2,168) = 0.88, p = 0.419). Results of a 3 (x 2)
mixed ANCOVA with condition as the between-subjects variable, time as the within-subjects
variable, and ethnicity as the covariate showed only a main effect of time in predicting depres-
sive symptoms (F(1, 167) = 5.01, p = .027, Partial η2 = .029), no main effect of condition (F(2,
167) = 0.212, p = .809, Partial η2 = .003) and no time x condition interaction (F(2, 167) = 0.412,
p = .663, Partial η2 = .005). Similar patterns were found for anxiety (time, F(1, 167) = 3.49, p =
.063, Partial η2 = .020; condition, F(2, 167) = 1.33, p = .268, Partial η2 = .016; time x condition,
F(2, 167) = 0.15, p = .859, Partial η2 = .002). The non-significant time x condition coefficients
indicated that the interventions did not reduce depressive symptoms or anxiety relative to
control.

 The daily survey data were analyzed using the Hierarchical Linear Modeling program to
account for dependency among nested data (HLM v.6.08; [51]). We modelled linear growth
curves to assess whether participants in the experimental conditions reported greater improve-
ments in mood and well-being over time relative to participants in the control condition.

This set of equations determined each person’s negative mood at baseline (B0), how negative
mood changed over time for each participant (B1), and how these changes varied by experi-
mental condition (G11; G12). Time was recoded so that 0 was day 1. G11 tested change in the
EMI condition against change in the control condition (using Condition Dummy 1; control = 0;
EMI = 1; FVI = 0). A significant G11 indicated that participants in the EMI condition exhib-
ited a different pattern of change compared to participants in the control condition. G12 tested
change in the FVI condition against the change in the control condition (using Condition
Dummy 2; control = 0; EMI = 0; FVI = 1). A significant G12 indicated that participants in the
FVI condition exhibited a different pattern of change compared to participants in the control
condition. Thus, the null hypothesis was that participants in the EMI / FVI conditions would
report similar changes over time as the control participants. For significant group differences,
we plotted the growth patterns for the three groups and computed tests of the simple slopes.
We also tested an additional set of dummy codes to compare the EMI and FVI groups in sub-
sequent analyses. Ethnicity (0 = European; 1 = non-European) was entered as a covariate in
the Level-2 intercept equation. Ethnicity was also entered as a covariate in the Level-2 slope
equation but was not significant, did not affect results, and was removed from final models for
simplicity.
Table 3 presents the growth curve results. Participants in the two experimental conditions
did not show any improvements in negative or positive mood relative to participants in the
control condition. Supplementary analyses showed similar null effects when analysing the
mood items separately (see S2 Table) with an exception: happy showed significant group dif-
ferences in change over time. Analysis of simple slopes showed that happiness was stable over
time for participants in the FVI condition (B(SE) = -0.001(0.006), p = .845) but happiness
decreased for participants in the EMI condition (B(SE) = -0.034(0.010), p = 0.001) and control
condition (B(SE) = -0.012(0.008), p = 0.018). The slopes were significantly different only
between the FVI and EMI conditions (p = 0.008).
However, participants in the FVI condition did show improvements to their psychological
well-being compared to participants in the EMI and control conditions. As shown in Table 3,
participants given fresh fruit and vegetables to consume (FVI condition) reported significant
growth in vitality, flourishing, and flourishing behaviors compared to participants in the EMI
and control conditions. Fig 2 presents the growth patterns for these outcomes. As shown in
the top of Fig 2, participants in the FVI condition reported lower starting vitality than the
other groups, but their rate of improvement was greater compared to both the EMI and con-
trol conditions. Analysis of simple slopes showed that participants in the FVI condition
reported significant growth in vitality over time (B(SE) = 0.455(0.200), p = .023) whereas par-
ticipants in EMI and control conditions were unchanged over time (EMI B(SE) = -0.192
(0.187), p = 0.307; control B(SE) = -0.336(0.204), p = 0.101). Group differences were even
more apparent for the measure of flourishing. As shown in the middle of Fig 2, participants in
the FVI condition reported significantly greater increases in flourishing compared to partici-
pants in the control and EMI conditions. Analysis of the simple slopes showed that partici-
pants in the FVI condition reported significant growth in flourishing over time (B(SE) = 0.010
(0.033), p = .004) whereas participants in the EMI and control conditions were unchanged

 over time (EMI B(SE) = -0.038(0.031), p = 0.215; control B(SE) = -0.031(0.027), p = 0.242).
And, shown in the bottom of Fig 2, participants in the FVI condition also reported signifi-
cantly greater growth in flourishing behaviors compared to participants in the control condi-
tion. Simple slope analyses revealed a trend growth in flourishing behaviors for participants in
the FVI condition (B(SE) = 0.013(0.007), p = .053), a trend decrease for participants in the
EMI condition (B(SE) = -0.009(0.006), p = .093), and a significant decrease for participants in
the control condition (B(SE) = -0.012(0.006), p = .038). When we analyzed the three flourish-
ing behaviors separately, all three showed similar patterns, but the strongest effects were found
for motivation (see S2). Fig 3 presents the growth patterns for motivation showing that partici-
pants in the FVI condition reported significantly increasing motivation over time (B(SE) =
0.019(0.010), p = .045), whereas participants in the EMI and control conditions were
unchanged over time (EMI B(SE) = -0.005(0.011), p = 0.652; control B(SE) = -0.011(0.008),
p = 0.218).
In terms of effect sizes, being assigned to the FVI condition (vs. control) predicted 8.7% of
the variance in growth in vitality, 10.5% of the growth in flourishing, and 18.4% of the growth
in flourishing behaviors using variance-explained effect size estimates of the time slopes [52].
Additional analyses testing for non-linear change over time using time and time squared as
level-1 predictors found no evidence for curvilinear changes over time or moderation of curvi-
linear changes by intervention group. Thus, changes in well-being as a function of the inter-
vention were strictly linear.
Lastly, none of these changes in well-being were mediated by post-test vitamin C, post-test
carotenoid levels, or psychological expectancies. Following procedures for testing mediation
with a multicategorical independent variable [53], we added each mediator as a separate Level-
2 predictor (grand-mean centered) plus the two condition dummy codes (ConditionD1 and

 ConditionD2) to predict both the intercepts (B0s) and time slopes (B1s) for vitality, flourish-
ing, and flourishing behaviors (with ethnicity as a covariate in the intercept equation, as
before). Five mediators were tested separately: post-test vitamin C levels, post-test carotenoid
levels, expectancy 1 (eating FV is virtuous), expectancy 2 (I feel better about myself when eat-
ing more FV), and expectancy 3 (eating FV improved my mood). None of the condition coeffi-
cients G11 or G12 changed when entering vitamin C, carotenoids, or the three psychological
expectancy questions into the model. The fact that the total effects (c) were nearly equivalent
to the direct effects (c’) when partialling out each indirect mediational pathway (ab) argues
against mediation by these variables.
Discussion
Giving young adults fruits and vegetables (FV) to eat, but not reminding them to eat their FV,
improved several aspects of psychological well-being over a two-week period. Despite both
intervention groups reporting modestly higher and similar consumption of FV relative to con-
trol (3.7 vs. 2.8 daily servings) [26], only young adults who were given two weeks’ worth of FV
showed improvements in their feelings of vitality, flourishing, and motivation. The short dura-
tion of our study indicated that FV intake translated into improved well-being quite rapidly.
The intervention effects were prominent across measures of well-being but not ill-being
such as depression, anxiety, or negative mood. This is an interesting pattern that supports the
observational and prospective research linking FV to greater well-being [10, 14, 15]. It is also
possible that this pattern might reflect differences in the timescale of effects. The majority of
research linking depression to dietary patterns has been longitudinal, meaning that possible
differences in ill-being may be established over a much longer period of time rather than our
brief two-week period. The accumulation of factors such as low vitality, reduced motivation,
and poorer socio-emotional flourishing may precipitate the development of psychological ill-
being over time [54]. In saying this, Smith and Rogers [24] did find a difference in self–
reported anxiety using the same measure (HADS) over a 10-day period with snacking on one
piece of fruit each day compared to snacking on chocolate. However, their participants had
higher average baseline anxiety (approximately +1.5 points). Intervention studies with positive
outcomes tend to have participants with higher baselines of illness [55], which may explain the
discrepancy in our findings.
The lack of psychological improvement among the EMI participants is challenging to inter-
pret. Both the EMI and FVI groups reported higher and equivalent consumption of FV com-
pared to control, but the EMI group did not show any corresponding psychological benefit.
Both intervention conditions were given roughly the same amount of monetary goods at the
start of the study–a $10 voucher for the EMI condition versus a little more than $10 worth of
fruit and vegetables for the FVI condition. One possibility is that this difference might be due
to lower control over the type, quality, and preparation of fruit and vegetables eaten by the
EMI group. The EMI group were free to choose whatever fruit and vegetables they liked, and
when surveyed, we found that they were more likely to eat cooked vegetables in casseroles or
mixed into their main meals [26]. By contrast, for the FVI group, we chose high quality pro-
duce, which was mostly eaten raw (including the carrots, eaten as snacks). Some researchers
have shown that more optimal psychological outcomes are associated with the consumption of
fresh fruit and raw vegetables/ salads, but not cooked vegetables [56, 57]. It is also possible that
regular text-reminders (twice daily for two weeks) might have annoyed participants in the
EMI condition and wiped out any gains in well-being. However, our experience is that partici-
pant burden is relatively low with receiving only two text messages per day. Furthermore,
informal feedback from the EMI participants was mostly positive; participants reported that

 the messages were not particularly intrusive and were effective at making them more aware
about what they ate [26]. Alternatively, it could be that giving FV to participants triggered
more intrinsic rather than extrinsic regulation of behavior. A previous study found that house-
holds given boxes of free FV were reluctant to waste the food and therefore had to overcome
internal conflicts in their personal value systems and find solutions they could live with–con-
tributing to a largely internal source of motivation to consume the FV they had been given
[58]. Given that intrinsic goals tend to be more rewarding and lead to greater well-being [59],
this could potentially explain the psychological improvement in the FVI condition, but not in
the EMI condition.
The significant changes in well-being occurred despite relatively small changes in FV con-
sumption (+ 1 serving per day more than control, and +1.2 servings from baseline for the FVI
condition). In fact, participants in the FVI condition still fell short of the “5+ a day” FV serv-
ings target [27], let alone the optimal 7–9 daily servings that has been associated with long-
term health [1]. Psychological improvements could have been larger had participants in the
experimental conditions eaten even more FV (or higher quality FV) or had they achieved satu-
ration levels of vitamin C and carotenoids. As we reported in Brookie et al. [26], the micronu-
trient increases in vitamin C and carotenoids were modest for our intervention conditions and
well-below saturation levels, suggesting that there was still room for improvement. In future
research, it would be important to increase consumption more than we did here.
Neither vitamin C and carotenoids nor psychological expectancies about FV mediated the
psychological benefits of FV consumption in this study. This was despite us choosing the two
most responsive micronutrient biomarkers of FV consumption [32] and measuring a range of
psychological expectancies. The literature on micronutrient status and mental health suggests
that single nutrients are unlikely to play a large role in the protection against mental illness
[60]. Instead, better mental health may arise from the cumulative effects of a broad spectrum
of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants [61]. Future research should consider how FV con-
sumption affects well-being through multiple pathways, including through improved blood
flow to the brain [62] or changes in gut microbiota [63, 64].
Strengths of the study included the three-arm randomized design that compared two exper-
imental conditions to a diet-as-usual control condition; use of a smartphone survey to track
mood and well-being in near-to-real time which provided a more accurate assessment than
retrospective self-report; high compliance with the smartphone survey; and, inclusion of blood
samples as an objective marker of FV consumption. Limitations included issues with measure-
ment reliability for some of the diary measures, which was a consequence of efforts to keep the
survey short. This could explain why we did not see intervention effects on mood. Future
research should include a more extensive measure of mood, such as the 9-item measure of pos-
itive mood previously found associated with FV [11, 15]. Another limitation is the short time-
frame of our intervention (two weeks) and lack of longer-term follow-up. In this regard, our
approach was more of a ‘light touch’ intervention to evoke near-term behavioral change. For
this reason, we consider these results preliminary, offering proof of concept that small changes
to FV consumption over a short time period may confer changes in well-being.
Our findings have implications for campaigns designed to increase FV consumption. FV
campaigns reflect an ‘information is power’ ethos and largely consist of educative programmes
operating through child health and wellness services, schools, communities, and public service
television ads. However, our research suggests that simply educating people about FV and
reminding them to eat their recommended daily intake may not be sufficient in ensuring the
wider population reaps the psychological benefits of FV consumption. It is already established
that successful interventions tend to be more personal and more intensive [55], but perhaps
greater emphasis needs to be placed on actually providing people with fresh FV (stocking

 more FV in dorms, cafeterias, workplaces, substituting fruit for dessert, and offering free fruit
for people when they shop). Additionally, conveying the immediate psychological benefits of
FV consumption may have more impact on behavior. Behavioral change messages are more
effective when they are immediately relevant to the target population [65] suggesting that
near-term benefits–such as increases in vitality and motivation–may be more salient than lon-
ger-term health benefits–such as the prevention of heart disease. This may be particularly per-
tinent to young people, who are endowed with feelings of immortality and quite focused on
the ‘here and now’.
Conclusions
Providing young adults with high-quality FV, not texting them reminders to eat more FV and
giving them a voucher, resulted in improvements to their psychological well-being over a two-
week period. This is the first study to show that providing high-quality FV to young adults can
result in short-term improvements in vitality, flourishing, and motivation. Findings provide
initial validation of a causal relationship between FV and well-being, suggesting that large-
scale intervention studies are warranted.
