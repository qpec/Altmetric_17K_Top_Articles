Abstract
Introduction—Higher target conformity and better sparing of organs at risk with modern 
radiotherapy (RT) may result in higher tumor control and less toxicities. In this study, we compare 
our institutional multimodality therapy experience of adjuvant chemotherapy and hemithoracic 
intensity-modulated pleural RT (IMPRINT) to previously used adjuvant conventional RT (CONV) 
in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with lung-sparing pleurectomy/
decortication (P/D).
Methods—We analyzed 209 patients who underwent P/D and adjuvant RT (n[CONV]=131, 
n[IMPRINT]=78) for MPM between 1974 and 2015. The primary endpoint was overall survival 
(OS). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to calculate OS;

 competing ri sks analysis was performed for local failure-free (LFFS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS). Univariate (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed with relevant 
clinical and treatment factors.
Results—The median age was 64 years, 80% were male. Patients receiving IMPRINT had 
significantly higher rates of epithelial histology, advanced pStage and chemotherapy treatment. OS 
was significantly higher after IMPRINT (median 20.2 vs 12.3 months, p=0.001). Higher 
Karnofsky performance score (KPS), epithelioid histology, macroscopically complete resection 
(MCR), and use of chemotherapy/IMPRINT were found to be significant factors for longer OS 
upon MVA. No significant predictive factors were identified for local failure or progression. Fewer 
patients developed grade ≥2 esophagitis after IMPRINT compared to CONV (23% vs 47%).
Conclusions—Trimodality therapy including adjuvant hemithoracic IMPRINT, chemotherapy, 
and P/D is associated with promising OS rates and decreased toxicities in patients with MPM. 
Dose constraints should be applied vigilantly to minimize serious adverse events.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive malignancy affecting the 
pleura and commonly associated with previous asbestos exposure. While some advances 
have been made in the various therapeutic approaches including lung-sparing surgical 
technique, chemotherapy drug types and doses and radiation therapy techniques, their 
impact on patient outcomes in a multimodality context remains unclear.
For patients with favorable histology and resectable disease, cytoreductive surgery with the 
goal of a macroscopically complete resection (MCR) has been the centerpiece of 
multimodality management at our institution. The debate about the optimal surgical 
procedure in MPM is ongoing. When compared retrospectively, patients undergoing lung-
sparing techniques with complete resection (P/D and extended P/D (EPD)) as opposed to 
patients having an extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) were found to have at least equivalent 
overall survival with less postoperative morbidity and mortality than after EPP. 1-5 This 
observation has led to a shift in surgical approach from predominantly EPPs to a more 
frequent use of lung-sparing approaches such as P/D and EPD. To exclude confounding by 
surgical approach, this study includes only patients who underwent lung-sparing surgery. We 
used the International Association of the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Mesothelioma 
Domain and the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG) definitions of P/D in this 
study.6
Platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy has been established as the standard of care for 
systemic therapy in patients with MPM, since it was shown to significantly improve overall 
survival compared to platinum chemotherapy alone in a phase III trial (12.1 vs 9.3 months) 
(Vogelzang et al.) and confirmed by a similar study using ralitrexed (van Meerbeeck et 
Shaikh et al.

 al.).7, 8 Typically four cycles are administered in the setting of multimodality therapy, 
delivered either as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
Adjuvant hemithoracic radiation therapy has been explored as part of multimodality 
treatment to reduce the risk of local and regional failure, especially after lung-sparing 
surgery given the high risk of microscopic residual disease. While 2D combined photon/
electron conventional RT had historically been the standard technique available at the time, 
the development of intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT) in the past 
decade has made a more precise application of hemithoracic RT possible, reducing areas of 
dose uncertainty and doses to underlying organs at risk, in particular the lungs, but also the 
heart, liver, stomach, kidneys and bowels. 9-18
In a recent prospective phase II trial we demonstrated the safety of hemithoracic IMPRINT 
after chemotherapy and P/D for patients with MPM.19
In this study, we analyzed our institutional database to compare outcomes and toxicities of 
patients with MPM treated with lung-sparing surgery followed by either adjuvant 
conventional RT or IMPRINT.
Methods and Materials
Study design and patients
For this study, data of patients with MPM treated at our institution between 1974 and 2015 
were collected from the institutional database. Patients were included if they had lung-
sparing surgery as well as adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).
Tumor information, treatment details and follow-up data were retrieved from the patients' 
medical records. Toxicity was scored per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Given the uncertainty about categorizing radiation pneumonitis we 
defined grade 2 pneumonitis as patients requiring systemic prednisone, and grade 3 
pneumonitis as patients requiring continuous oxygen or need for hospitalization.
Treatment characteristics
All patients underwent one of three lung-sparing types of surgical procedure, namely 
extended pleurectomy/decortication (EPD), pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), or partial 
pleurectomy (PP). Only 15 patients (11%) in the CONV group received chemotherapy, but 
90% of patients in the IMPRINT group were treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy. With the exeption of two cases, all patients in the IMPRINT group received a 
platinum/pemetrexed doublet.
The technique of conventional RT performed at our institution has been previously described 
by Kutcher et al.20 and Gupta et al.21 Patients were immobilized with their arms raised 
above their head in supine position. The field borders were the top of T1 superiorly, the 
bottom of L2/base of diaphragm inferiorly, the ribcage including the skin laterally and the 
contralateral border of the vertebral bodies medially. A 1.5 to 2.0cm margin was added 
medially if mediastinal nodes were involved. Patients were simulated using fluoroscopy or

 CT, and the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the pleura and diaphragm with a 
1cm margin. Blocks were placed anteriorly and posteriorly over abdomen and lung, and - 
starting at 1980 cGy - over the heart in the case of left-sided tumors. There was a 15% 
scatter under the blocks from the photon fields, therefore a supplemental daily electron dose 
of 153 cGy was prescribed. The spinal cord was excluded from the treatment field for the 
final 2 fractions to avoid overdosing. Radiation treatments were delivered in 180 cGy 
fractions with 6 MV photon beams using linear accelerators.
Since 2004 we have developed a hemithoracic pleural IMRT technique for MPM patients 
that was previously described.15, 16, 19 Patients were immobilized with their arms raised 
above their head in supine position. The initial PTV was defined using the planning CT scan 
and encompassed the hemithoracic pleura and chest wall reaching from the thoracic inlet 
until the insertion of the diaphragm at the L1/L2 vertebral body. A PET-CT scan and 
respiratory correlated 4D-CT scan (available since 2008) were used to further refine the 
target volume. Radiation treatments were delivered in 180 cGy fractions with 6 MV photon 
beams using Varian linear accelerators with a dynamic multileaf collimator.
Statistical methods and design
The primary endpoint of the analysis was overall survival (OS). Local failure free survival 
(LFFS) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined as well. All endpoints were 
measured beginning at the start of radiation therapy until the date of event (death, local 
failure or progression, respectively) or until the last follow-up date. The Kaplan-Meier 
method was used for calculating overall survival rates, Cox proportional hazards regression 
model was used for OS analysis, and a Fine and Gray competing risks analysis was 
performed for LFFS and PFS. Univariate analysis (UVA) was performed for the following 
factors: age at diagnosis, sex, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), histology, laterality of 
tumor, clinical and pathological stage, macroscopically complete resection (MCR), 
chemotherapy, RT technique and RT dose. Factors with a p-value ≤ 0.15 were considered 
candidates for stepwise multivariate analysis (MVA) to evaluate the association of RT 
technique with each endpoint. Forward and backward selection procedures were 
implemented to confirm results. Incidence of significant (≥ grade 2) toxicities were 
compared between RT techniques using Fisher's exact test. These results were adjusted for 
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. Statistical analysis was conducted with 
the software SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC), and R version 3.1.2 package 
cmprsk.
Results
Patient characteristics
We analyzed 209 patients with MPM who met the inclusion criteria. The median age of 
patients was 64 (range: 34 to 84), male to female ratio was 4:1 and median KPS was 80 
(range: 60 to 100). 131 patients (63%) received conventional external beam radiation therapy 
(CONV) and 78 (37%) intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT). All 
patients treated since March 2005 received IMPRINT. Eighty-five patients (41%) received 
chemotherapy (70 IMPRINT and 15 CONV patients). Significant differences between the

 CONV and IMPRINT group were noted in age (> 64 years: 45% and 65% respectively, 
p=0.006), KPS (>80: 31% and 50% respectively, p=0.008), histology (epithelioid: 59% and 
86% respectively, p<0.0001) and stage (pathological stage III and IV (advanced): 49% and 
76% respectively, p=0.0001). Chemotherapy was administered significantly more often in 
the IMPRINT group (90% vs. 11%, p<0.0001) and IMPRINT was also associated with 
higher total prescription radiation doses (total dose >4500cGy: 65% vs 11%, p<0.0001). 
Detailed patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Survival
The median follow-up among survivors was 21.4 months (range 1.2 to 95.1 months) from 
the start of RT. Median overall survival (OS) was 20.2 months (95% Confidence Interval 
[CI] 13.5 – 28.2 months) in the IMPRINT cohort compared to 12.3 months (95% CI 10.0 – 
15.3 months) in the CONV cohort [Figure 1]. One- and 2-year survival rates were higher for 
patients receiving IMPRINT (69% and 42% versus 50% and 20% for CONV).
Factors associated with higher OS on UVA were KPS > 80% (vs ≤ 80%, HR 0.62, 95% CI 
0.45-0.85, p=0.003), epithelioid histology (vs. non-epithelioid, HR 0.55, 95%CI 0.40-0.75, 
p=0.0002), MCR (vs. non-MCR, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.97, p=0.03), IMPRINT (vs. 
CONV, HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.81, p=0.001) and a total RT dose >4500 cGy (HR 0.70, 
95% CI 0.50-0.96, p=0.03). On MVA, KPS > 80% (p=0.01), epithelioid histology (p=0.003), 
MCR (p=0.01) and IMPRINT (p=0.02) were significantly associated with longer OS. [Table 
2]
Although chemotherapy was associated with improved survival in the UVA (vs. no 
chemotherapy, HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.46-0.86, p=0.004), it did not enter into the stepwise Cox 
proportional hazards MVA final model as it was highly correlated with RT technique. 
Seventy patients (90%) receiving IMPRINT also underwent chemotherapy, while only 15 
patients (11%) in the CONV cohort received chemotherapy (p<0.001 by Fisher's exact test). 
As IMPRINT entered into the MVA model, chemotherapy did not contribute significantly to 
the prognosis of OS, and thus did not enter into the MVA final model. The results from the 
MVA final models using stepwise, forward and backward selection procedures were 
identical. Further analysis showed that when RT technique was removed as a candidate of 
the stepwise MVA, KPS > 80% (p=0.009), epithelioid histology (p=0.002), MCR (p=0.02), 
and chemotherapy (p=0.02) remained associated with longer OS.
Local Failure
There were 116 cases of local failure (LF) (56% of all patients), 72 patients died without LF 
and 21 patients were censored at last follow-up. The 1-and 2-year cumulative incidences of 
local failure were 42% and 60% for IMPRINT versus 34% and 47% for CONV. There was 
no significant difference in cumulative incidence of LF between the two groups (p=0.08 by 
Gary's test). There were no factors significantly associated with higher rates of local control 
either in uni- or multivariate analysis.

 Progression-Free Survival
145 patients (69%) progressed, 48 died without progression of disease and 16 were censored 
at last follow-up. The 1- and 2-year cumulative incidences of disease progression were 53% 
and 72% for IMPRINT and 47% and 69% for CONV. There was no significant difference in 
cumulative incidence of progression between the groups (p=0.07 by Gray's test). Only one 
factor, left sided MPM (vs. right sided), approached a significant level of association with 
progression of disease (HR =1.38 (95% CI of 1.00-1.41), p=0.05). Stepwise MVA showed 
left-sided disease (HR 1.36, 95% 0.99 – 1.87, p=0.06) and female gender (HR 1.37, 95%CI 
0.99 – 1.91, p=0.06) were marginally significant for a higher risk of progression.
Toxicities
Patients undergoing IMPRINT were found to have significantly higher rates of grade 2+ 
fatigue (47% vs 16%, p<0.0001) and cough (18% vs 2%, p<0.0001) while the CONV cohort 
showed more cases of grade 2+ esophagitis (23% vs 47%, p=0.0007). After adjusting for 
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method, all p-values remained at p<0.006. There 
was no significant difference seen in the rates of grade grade 2+ radiation pneumonitis (26% 
in the IMRINT vs. 35% in the CONV cohort, p=0.17), nausea (both 24%, p=1.0), vomiting 
(6% vs 8%, p=1.0), dyspnea (27% vs 24%, p=0.62) and dermatitis (13% vs 15%, p=0.69). 
There were 4 possibly toxicity-related deaths in the CONV group (two of which were grade 
5 radiation pneumonitis) and 2 in the IMPRINT group (one grade 4 and one grade 5 
radiation pneumonitis).
Discussion
Multimodality treatment is commonly the preferred treatment approach for patients with 
resectable MPM. However, the optimal combination of multimodality therapies remains 
unclear. At our institution we have a longstanding history of conducting prospective and 
retrospective studies on the multimodality management of patients with MPM. Here we 
present a complete series of patients treated with multimodality treatment on a lung-sparing 
surgical backbone of P/D. To our knowledge it represents the largest series of lung-sparing 
surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy performed by a high-volume institution with 
significant experience in this complex disease. Patients were treated with adjuvant RT using 
conventional techniques in the early years and an IMRT technique in the last decade. In 
these 209 patients with MPM that underwent lung-sparing multimodality treatment we 
found promising overall survival outcomes in patients that received platinum/pemetrexed-
based chemotherapy and adjuvant IMPRINT compared to CONV. We also found that higher 
KPS and epithelioid histology was associated with longer OS, which is in line with 
previously reported results.22, 23
A few aspects should be considered in addition to the inherent limitations of a retrospective 
analysis. Our study includes patients treated over 40 years. During this period of time, many 
aspects of radiation oncology but also in the fields of medical and surgical oncology have 
significantly changed. In addition to technical advances in the treatment of MPM, platinum/
pemetrexed chemotherapy has, over the past decade, emerged as standard first-line therapy 
for inoperable MPM8, 24 and has become an essential part of our multi-modality treatment

 approach. This explains the large discrepancy between the groups regarding the inclusion of 
chemotherapy in the multimodality treatment (90% in IMPRINT group and only 11% in 
CONV group). Given the observed effect size of our modern trimodality treatment approach 
we believe that the use of trimodality therapy including both modern platinum/pemetrexed 
chemotherapy and IMPRINT compared to surgery and conventional RT alone likely 
prolongs overall survival. While the IMPRINT group had some more favorable patient 
characteristics, such as higher KPS, more epithelioid histologies, and more chemotherapy 
administered, it also contained several unfavorable patient characteristics, including older 
age and more advanced pathologic stage, that would likely counteract the favorable 
characteristics.
Our analysis did not identify significant contributors associated with higher incidences of 
progression or local failures on MVA. While left-sided MPM and female gender were 
marginally significant on MVA of progression, caution is advised not to overinterpret these 
findings given the 95% confidence interval of 1.00 - 1.41 for left-sided MPM on UVA. 
While one could argue the lack of improved local control within the IMPRINT group means 
that it is unlikely that radiation has a role in improved survival, it is important to note that 
patients are followed much more closely and with more precise imaging modalities such as 
CT and PET/CT imaging, in the era of platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy and IMPRINT. 
This development of more accurate imaging has likely increased the likelihood of early 
recurrence detection and shortened the time for the detection of local and distant failure 
which may explain the apparent lack of difference in local failures and PFS. However, in 
patients with MPM disease progression is so strongly correlated with OS that it is fair to 
hypothesize that the observed OS benefit is due to improved disease control.
Our toxicity analysis showed higher rates of grade 2+ cough and fatigue in the IMPRINT 
group but, more significantly, a lower rate of grade 2+ esophagitis compared to the CONV 
group. Additionally, while not statistically significant, pneumonitis rates were lower in 
IMPRINT group as well. As this is a retrospective study, evaluation of toxicity rates overall 
remains subject to inaccuracy especially for patients treated before electronic medical 
records were available. The higher rates of cough and fatigue may be attributed to the fact 
that the documentation of toxicities has become more standardized, electronic medical 
record systems have been established and toxicities have been more carefully recorded in the 
past decade. However, the observed significant decrease grade 2+ esophagitis and numerical 
albeit not statistically significant decrease in grade 2+ pneumonitis suggests that the use of 
IMPRINT may lead to less severe side effects. Grading of radiation pneumonitis remains 
somewhat subjective, for instance with different thresholds for initiating systemic 
prednisone for grade 2 pneumonitis. Clinically, we feel that we observe less frequent and 
less severe radiation pneumonitis with the use of IMPRINT. We may need an even larger 
patient cohort to show a statistically significant decrease in pneumonitis compared to the 
CONV group. In general, however, IMRT has been shown in mesothelioma and multiple 
other disease sites to be associated with decreased radiation dose to organs at risk, leading to 
a decrease in toxicities.25-27 It is fair to assume that improved dosimetric control and less 
radiation to organs at risk with IMPRINT is associated with less toxicity.

 To conclude, we have found that IMPRINT in the context of modern chemotherapy and 
lung-sparing surgery as a part of modern trimodality treatment in MPM is associated with 
improved outcomes such as higher overall survival and lower rates of severe toxicity 
compared to lung-sparing surgery and conventional RT alone.
