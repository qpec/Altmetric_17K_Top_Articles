Differing association of alcohol
consumption with different stroke types:
a systematic review and meta-analysis
Susanna C. Larsson1,2*, Alice Wallin1, Alicja Wolk1 and Hugh S. Markus2
Abstract
Background: Whether light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is protective against stroke, and whether any
association differs by stroke type, is controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence
from prospective studies on alcohol drinking and stroke types.
Methods: Studies were identified by searching PubMed to September 1, 2016, and reference lists of retrieved
articles. Additional data from 73,587 Swedish adults in two prospective studies were included. Study-specific
results were combined in a random-effects model.
Results: The meta-analysis included 27 prospective studies with data on ischemic stroke (25 studies), intracerebral
hemorrhage (11 studies), and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage (11 studies). Light and moderate alcohol consumption
was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke, whereas high and heavy drinking was associated with an
increased risk; the overall RRs were 0.90 (95 % CI, 0.85–0.95) for less than 1 drink/day, 0.92 (95 % CI, 0.87–0.97)
for 1–2 drinks/day, 1.08 (95 % CI, 1.01–1.15) for more than 2–4 drinks/day, and 1.14 (95 % CI, 1.02–1.28) for more
than 4 drinks/day. Light and moderate alcohol drinking was not associated with any hemorrhagic stroke subtype.
High alcohol consumption (>2–4 drinks/day) was associated with a non-significant increased risk of both
hemorrhagic stroke subtypes, and the relative risk for heavy drinking (>4 drinks/day) were 1.67 (95 % CI, 1.25–2.23)
for intracerebral hemorrhage and 1.82 (95 % CI, 1.18–2.82) for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Conclusion: Light and moderate alcohol consumption was inversely associated only with ischemic stroke, whereas
heavy drinking was associated with increased risk of all stroke types with a stronger association for hemorrhagic
strokes.
Keywords: Alcohol consumption, Meta-analysis, Prospective studies, Stroke
Background
Whether light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, gene-
rally defined as 1–2 drinks per day, is protective against
cardiovascular disease remains a controversial topic. Al-
cohol consumption in moderation has been associated
with increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, im-
proved insulin sensitivity, and decreased levels of fibrino-
gen and inflammatory markers [1–4]. Moreover, alcohol
intake is associated with risk of hypertension in a linear
positive dose–response relationship in men and with a J-
shaped
dose–response
relationship
in
women
[5].
Whereas observational studies have consistently reported
an inverse association between moderate alcohol con-
sumption and risk of ischemic heart disease [6, 7],
the association between alcohol consumption and risk
of stroke types has not been delineated. Previous meta-
analyses of alcohol consumption and stroke risk examined
only total stroke (ischemic and all hemorrhagic strokes
combined) [6] or combined case-control and prospective
studies in the analysis of stroke types [8, 9]. Whether the
association
of
alcohol
consumption
with
risk
of
hemorrhagic stroke varies for intracerebral hemorrhage
and subarachnoid hemorrhage was not addressed in previ-
ous meta-analyses.

 The aim of this study was to perform a contemporary
systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize
available evidence from prospective studies on alcohol
consumption in relation to risk of ischemic stroke,
intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Moreover, we investigated the association between alcohol
consumption and incidence of stroke types in 4555
stroke cases with a mean of 11.9 years of follow-up
in the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) and the Swedish
Mammography Cohort (SMC), and included these cohorts
in the present meta-analysis.
Methods
Swedish cohort studies
Details about the COSM and the SMC, assessment of
alcohol consumption and covariates, case ascertainment,
and statistical analysis are reported in Additional file 1:
Text S1. The study population for this analysis consisted
of 39,941 men (45–79 years of age) in the COSM and
33,646 women (49–83 years of age) in the SMC. Partici-
pants were free of stroke and ischemic heart disease at
baseline (January 1, 1998) and were followed up through
December 31, 2010.
Meta-analysis
Search strategy
The design, analysis, and reporting for this meta-analysis
followed the MOOSE guidelines [10]. Relevant studies
were identified by a literature search of the PubMed
database (from January 1966 to September 1, 2016),
without restrictions, using the search terms “alcohol
consumption”, “alcohol drinking”, or “alcohol intake”
combined with “stroke”, or “cerebrovascular disease”, or
“cerebral infarction”, or “intracerebral hemorrhage” or
“subarachnoid hemorrhage”. The database search was
performed by two authors (SCL and AWa) and enhanced
by searches of the reference lists of identified articles.
Inclusion criteria
Two authors (SCL and AWa) independently evaluated
all records by title, abstract, or full text for potentially
eligible studies, and any disagreement was resolved by
consensus. Eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis
were prospective studies that reported relative risks (RR)
with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for quantitative
categories of alcohol consumption in relation to non-
fatal or fatal ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage,
or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Studies that only reported
data on total stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes
combined) or total hemorrhagic stroke were not eligible.
Where duplicate publications were available from the
same study population, the study with data on stroke
types and the largest number of stroke cases was included.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Details recorded for each study were the first author’s
surname, publication year, study name, country in which
the study was performed, number of subjects, propor-
tion of men, age range, mean follow-up, number of cases
for each stroke type, method used for assessment of
alcohol consumption, average or range of alcohol intake
as well as number of cases and person-years (or non-cases
if person-years were not provided) in each category, RRs
with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each category,
and covariates controlled for in the most fully adjusted
multivariable model. Study quality was evaluated with the
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale [11]. The quality score ranged
from 0 to 9. Details of how the criteria were applied
are described in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Statistical analysis
To place the studies on a common scale, alcohol
consumption was standardized to drinks of alcohol. If
alcohol consumption was reported in grams, the values
were converted into drinks by assuming that one drink
on average contains 12 grams of alcohol. The median or
mean alcohol intake for each category was assigned to
the corresponding risk estimate. If average values were
not reported, each category was assigned the midpoint
of the upper and lower boundaries for that category. If
an upper boundary was not provided for the highest
category, the boundary was presumed to have the same
range as the adjacent category. In a sensitivity analysis,
for studies that did not provide the average value for the
highest category, the mid-point for the highest category
was set at 1.5 times the half range of the preceding
category.
A random-effects model was used to combine study-
specific RRs by alcohol consumption categories based on
the average consumption in each category. The exposure
categories were as follows: light (< 1 drink/day), mode-
rate (1–2 drinks/day), high (> 2–4 drinks/day), and
heavy (> 4 drinks/day) alcohol consumption. The com-
parison group was the reference group in each study
(i.e., non-drinkers, never drinkers, or occasional drinkers).
In a sensitivity analysis, we stratified the studies by
reference group used.
Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed
to assess whether the association between alcohol con-
sumption and stroke types varied by geographic region
(United States, Europe, and Asia), sex, and study quality
(Newcastle–Ottawa Scale: < 7 vs. ≥ 7). Because of the
small number of studies in some subgroups, the light and
moderate alcohol consumption categories and the high
and heavy alcohol consumption categories were com-
bined. In a sensitivity analysis for women, we defined 1 or
less drinks/day as the moderate alcohol consumption
category and more than 1 drink/day as high-to-heavy

 alcohol drinking. Between-study heterogeneity was evalu-
ated with the I2 statistic [12], and the degree of heteroge-
neity was quantified using the following cutoff values: less
than 30 %, no or low heterogeneity; 30–75 %, moderate
heterogeneity; and more than 75 %, notable heterogeneity.
Egger’s test was used to assess small-study bias such as
publication bias [13]. Statistical tests were considered
statistically significant at P values < 0.05. All analyses were
conducted using Stata (version 14.1, StataCorp, College
Station, TX).
Results
Swedish cohort studies
Baseline characteristics of men in the COSM and women
in the SMC are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. A
total of 3824 ischemic stroke cases (2216 in men and
1608 in women), 555 intracerebral hemorrhage cases
(350 in men and 205 in women), and 176 subarachnoid
hemorrhage cases (82 in men and 94 in women) were
ascertained over 873,440 person-years (mean 11.9 years)
of follow-up. There was no statistically significant asso-
ciation between alcohol consumption and risk of ische-
mic stroke (Additional file 1: Table S2). However, because
of the small number of cases in some categories, we
cannot exclude weak associations. Consumption of more
than 21 drinks/week of alcohol was associated with a
statistically significant increased risk of intracerebral
hemorrhage in both men and women (Additional file 1:
Table S2). Alcohol consumption was statistically signi-
ficantly positively associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage
in women but not in men (Additional file 1: Table S2).
Meta-analysis
We screened 2505 abstracts or titles and reviewed 89
full-text articles (Additional file 1: Figure S2). A total
of 27 prospective studies (29 publications [14–42]),
including the COSM and the SMC, on alcohol consump-
tion in relation to risk of one or more stroke types were
included in the meta-analysis. Combined, these studies
included 19,302 ischemic stroke cases (25 studies), 2359
intracerebral hemorrhage cases (11 studies), and 1164
subarachnoid hemorrhage cases (11 studies). Characte-
ristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. Of
the 27 studies, ten were conducted in Europe (four in
Sweden, two in Finland and one each in Denmark,
Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany), nine in the
United States, and eight in Asia. Alcohol consumption
was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire in all
but six studies [14, 16, 17, 19, 28, 29] in which alcohol
consumption was assessed by an interview. Most studies
adjusted for major potential confounders such as age,
sex, smoking, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus
(Table 1).
Overall analyses
The associations between levels of alcohol consumption
and stroke types are presented in Fig. 1. Light and
moderate alcohol consumption (up to 2 drinks/day) was
associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, whereas
high and heavy alcohol consumption (> 2 drinks/day)
was associated with an increased risk. The overall
RRs (95 % CI) of ischemic stroke were 0.90 (95 % CI,
0.85–0.95) for less than 1 drink/day, 0.92 (95 % CI,
0.87–0.97) for 1–2 drinks/day, 1.08 (95 % CI, 1.01–1.15)
for more than 2–4 drinks/day, and 1.14 (95 % CI,
1.02–1.28) for more than 4 drinks/day, with low between-
study heterogeneity in all categories (I2 ≤ 23.7 %). When
the lowest category was split into 3 or less drinks/week
and more than 3–7 drinks/week, the overall RRs were
0.89 (95 % CI, 0.84–0.94; I2 = 20 %; 16 studies) and 0.90
(95 % CI, 0.83–0.98; I2 = 23.6 %; 19 studies), respectively.
There were no overall associations of light and moderate
alcohol consumption (up to 2 drinks/day) with risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
However, high alcohol consumption (> 2–4 drinks/day)
was associated with a non-statistically significant increased
risk of both hemorrhagic stroke subtypes and heavy
alcohol consumption (> 4 drinks/day) was associated with
a statistically significant increased risk of both intra-
cerebral hemorrhage (RR = 1.67; 95 % CI, 1.25–2.23) and
subarachnoid hemorrhage (RR = 1.82; 95 % CI, 1.18–2.82).
There was low to moderate heterogeneity among study-
specific results for hemorrhagic stroke subtypes. Results
did not change in a sensitivity analysis in which the
mid-point for the highest category was set at 1.5 times
the half range of the preceding category.
Subgroup analyses
Results from subgroup analyses by geographic area, sex,
and study quality are shown in Table 2. High-to-heavy
alcohol consumption was associated with a statistically
significant higher risk of ischemic stroke in studies from
the United States and Europe but not Asia, but this diffe-
rence was not statistically significant in meta-regression
analysis (United States/Europe vs. Asia: P for difference =
0.09). High-to-heavy alcohol consumption appeared to be
more strongly positively associated with risk of all stroke
types in women than in men but none of the differences
were
statistically
significant
(P
for
difference > 0.10).
Results for women were similar when light-to-moderate
alcohol consumption was defined as 1 or less drinks/day
(rather than ≤ 2 drinks/day). The strengths of the positive
association between alcohol consumption and subarach-
noid hemorrhage varied by geographic area but the
number of studies in each stratum was limited and the
differences were not statistically significant (P for diffe-
rence > 0.17).

 The association between alcohol consumption and
stroke types did not differ appreciably by reference
group used, except that light-to-moderate drinking was
not associated with ischemic stroke when occasional
drinkers were used as the comparison group (Additional
file 1: Table S3).
Small-study bias
Indication of small-study bias was observed in the light
alcohol consumption category for ischemic stroke (P =
0.04) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (P = 0.01), but not
in the moderate, high, and heavy alcohol consumption
categories. There was no evidence of small-study bias
for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Discussion
Findings from this meta-analysis of 27 prospective stud-
ies indicate that alcohol consumption has divergent
associations by stroke type. Light and moderate alcohol
consumption (up to 2 drinks/day) was associated with a
reduced risk of ischemic stroke but was not associated
with risk of intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an
increased risk of all stroke types but with stronger asso-
ciations for hemorrhagic stroke subtypes than for ische-
mic stroke.
The divergent dose–response relationships between
alcohol consumption and risk of ischemic stroke and
hemorrhagic
stroke
subtypes
suggest
that
different
mechanisms underlie associations with the different
stroke types. Alcohol consumption is associated with
increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
and reduced fibrinogen levels [1–4], and this might
explain the lower the risk of ischemic stroke but not
hemorrhagic stroke associated with light and moderate
alcohol consumption. The adverse impact of alcohol
consumption on blood pressure may directly increase the
risk of hemorrhagic stroke and outweigh potential bene-
ficial associations of light to moderate drinking with
ischemic stroke.
Ischemic stroke itself is caused by a number of differ-
ent pathophysiological mechanisms and alcohol drinking
might have contrasting effects on different ischemic
stroke subtypes. For example, moderate and high alcohol
consumption is associated with an elevated risk of atrial
fibrillation [43], which is a risk factor for cardioembolic
stroke. However, only one study in this meta-analysis
reported results for ischemic stroke subtypes [24]. Results
from that cohort study of Japanese men showed that
moderate and heavy alcohol consumption was associated
with a non-statistically significant increased risk of cardio-
embolic stroke, whereas moderate alcohol consumption
was associated with a statistically significant reduced risk
of lacunar infarction and a non-statistically significant
lower risk of large artery stroke [24].
Although the overall evidence from prospective obser-
vational studies indicates an inverse association between
light-to-moderate alcohol consumption and risk of ische-
mic stroke, the causality of this association is unclear.
Further information on causality can be obtained by
looking at genetic associations. This approach, known
as Mendelian randomization, avoids some of the crucial
limitations of observational studies because allocation of
genetic variants is random with regard to potential con-
founders. A recent Mendelian randomization study shed
doubts on the beneficial effects of moderate alcohol

 consumption on cardiovascular disease. That study showed
that individuals with an alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene
variant, which is associated with nondrinking and lower
levels of usual alcohol consumption, had a reduced risk of
ischemic stroke [44]. However, the gene studied explains
only a fraction of alcohol consumption in the population
and it may have effects on cardiovascular disease beyond
those explained by alcohol consumption. Therefore, it has
been suggested that the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene
allele violates the assumptions required for a variable for
Mendelian randomization and is therefore inappropriate
for judging the effects of alcohol consumption on cardio-
vascular disease [45]. To further evaluate the causality of
the inverse association between light-to-moderate alcohol
consumption and ischemic stroke, additional Mendelian
randomization studies that use a better instrumental vari-
able than a single nucleotide polymorphism of the alcohol
dehydrogenase 1B gene are required.
A strength of the present meta-analysis is the relatively
large number of studies included. Therefore, the asso-
ciation between alcohol consumption and stroke types
could be estimated with a relatively high accuracy across
a wide range of alcohol consumption, and in different
subgroups. In addition, by inclusion of prospective stu-
dies, only the possibility that the results may have been
affected by recall or selection bias, which could be of
concern in case–control studies, was minimized.
This meta-analysis is limited by the lack of individual
patient data. We therefore could not adjust the risk
estimates for the same covariates in all studies. Some
degree of underreporting of alcohol consumption by par-
ticipants in the included studies is likely to have occurred.
Such underreporting would underestimate the threshold
for adverse effects of alcohol consumption on stroke risk.
Another limitation is that the major type of alcoholic
beverage consumed and the drinking pattern differ across
populations and this could introduce between-study
heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we conducted stratified
analyses by geographic area, which in part could account
for different alcohol consumption patterns, and found
similar associations across regions. Alcohol consumption
patterns may be different for populations in southern
compared with northern Europe. Because all European
studies of alcohol consumption and stroke types were
conducted in northern Europe (mainly in the Nordic
countries), we could not investigate potential differences
in alcohol–stroke type associations for northern versus
southern European populations. A further shortcoming is
that the association of alcohol consumption with etiologic
subtypes of ischemic stroke could not be assessed. Finally,
as in any meta-analysis, small-study bias (e.g., publication
bias) could be of concern. There was evidence of such
bias in the light alcohol consumption category for both
ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hence,
we cannot rule out the possibility that the associations
between light alcohol drinking and risk of ischemic stroke
and subarachnoid hemorrhage have been overestimated.
No indication of small-study bias was observed in the
analyses of intracerebral hemorrhage.
Future studies should evaluate the association of
alcohol drinking patterns (regular or binge drinking) and
usual type of beverage (wine, beer, and liquor) consumed
with risk of stroke and ischemic stroke subtypes (large
vessel, small vessel, and cardioembolic stroke). Further-
more, future studies should assess underreporting of
alcohol intake and may use new approaches for estimating
alcohol consumption based on metabolic profiling [46],
which offers promise as a way of avoiding errors in
self-reporting of alcohol consumption.
Conclusions
Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that alcohol
consumption has divergent effects on different stroke
types. This may explain some of the inconsistent results
from previous studies associating alcohol consummation
with all strokes.
