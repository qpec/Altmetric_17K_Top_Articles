ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality globally. Influenza is one of the
leading infectious causes of morbidity and mortality
globally, and evidence is accumulating that it can
precipitate acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This is
thought to be due to a range of factors including
inflammatory release of cytokines, disruption of
atherosclerotic plaques and thrombogenesis, which may
acutely occlude a coronary artery. There is a large body
of observational and clinical trial evidence that shows
that influenza vaccine protects against AMI. Estimates of
the efficacy of influenza vaccine in preventing AMI range
from 15% to 45%. This is a similar range of efficacy
compared with the accepted routine coronary prevention
measures such as smoking cessation (32–43%), statins
(19–30%) and antihypertensive therapy (17–25%).
Influenza vaccine should be considered as an integral
part of CVD management and prevention. While it is
recommended in many guidelines for patients with CVD,
rates of vaccination in risk groups aged <65 years are
very low, in the range of 30%. The incorporation of
vaccination into routine CVD prevention in patient care
requires a clinical practice paradigm change.
In 2008, cardiovascular disease (CVD) overtook
communicable diseases for the first time to become
the leading cause of mortality in the world, now
causing approximately 13% of all deaths globally.1
Given the high global burden of coronary heart
disease (CHD), prevention through identifying and
mitigating
risk
factors
is
a
priority.
Cigarette
smoking, elevated serum cholesterol levels and high
blood pressure are major risk factors for developing
CHD and significant predictors of death, and are
therefore accepted targets for preventive strategies.2
When considering attributable deaths, raised blood
pressure is categorised as the leading risk factor fol-
lowed by tobacco use while high serum cholesterol
is ranked sixth.3 Behavioural interventions such as
smoking cessation, dietary and lifestyle changes,
use
of
statins
and
antihypertensive
drugs
are
accepted public health strategies for reducing the
burden of CHD.4 Could influenza vaccine be an
additional strategy to reduce CHD burden?
INFLUENZA AS A TRIGGER FOR ACUTE
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
While many infections have been studied for their
role in triggering vascular events, the most consist-
ent evidence is for influenza.5 There is compelling
evidence for the association between influenza
infection and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
There is a peak of both influenza and cardiac
deaths
in
winter.5
6
Influenza
epidemics
are
associated with increased hospitalisation rates for
AMI and other cardiovascular-related conditions.7 8
A number of studies have shown a strong associ-
ation between influenza and AMI.5 9–11 There is a
wealth of retrospective and prospective5 studies
showing a temporal relationship, with influenza
respiratory illnesses preceding AMI by a variable
time, with the strongest association occurring in the
first three days, but lasting up to 1 year.12
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory response cul-
minating in a plaque comprised of a core rich in
lipids, pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines, and a
fibrous cap. It is thought that influenza acts by
many mechanisms, including inflammatory release
of cytokines that causes a pro-thrombotic state,
local disruption of coronary plaques, as well as
physiological effects such as hypoxia and tachycar-
dia, to cause acute obstruction of coronary arteries
that may be otherwise subcritically stenosed.13
Other mechanisms include sympathetic activation
with subsequent effects on vascular tone with vaso-
constriction;
thrombogenesis
through
the
non-
specific pro-coagulant and thrombophilic effects of
inflammation;
epithelial
dysfunction;
and
inad-
equate
coronary
artery
blood
flow
through
increased metabolic demand with fever and tachy-
cardia, reduced oxygen saturation and hypotension
with secondary vasoconstriction.14 Further, influ-
enza has been shown to produce direct effects on
the heart. Histopathological and molecular studies
on influenza-infected mice have shown that the
virus can be isolated from heart tissue and that its
presence leads to local inflammatory changes.15
The multiple mechanisms by which influenza may
precipitate AMI are shown in figure 1.
INFLUENZA VACCINE FOR SECONDARY
CORONARY PREVENTION
Evidence is accumulating about the effectiveness of
influenza vaccination in coronary disease preven-
tion. Observational studies have shown the protect-
ive effectiveness of influenza vaccine against AMI is
between 19% and 45%.9 16 17 A meta-analysis of
case–control studies showed that influenza vaccine
has a summary vaccine effectiveness of 29% against
AMI.18 In a meta-analysis of randomised controlled
trials
(RCTs),
influenza vaccine
was
protective
against the outcome of AMI but the pooled esti-
mate was not statistically significant (relative risk
(RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.64).5 However, each
RCT showed efficacy of influenza vaccine against
composite coronary morbidity and mortality out-
comes.19
20 Another RCT found that influenza
vaccine reduced major cardiovascular events by
10% in patients with acute coronary syndromes
during a 12-month follow-up period.21

 If influenza vaccine protects against AMI, the mechanism is
through preventing influenza, thereby preventing the possibility
of AMI triggered by the mechanisms discussed above. An add-
itional putative molecular mechanism for the protective effect
of vaccination is that vaccine-induced antibody cross-reacts with
a human bradykinin receptor.22 It is postulated that this inter-
action could lead to increased levels of nitric oxide, which
increases the efficiency of myocardial oxygen use, as well as
leading to increased blood flow through vasodilation and pos-
sible angiogenesis.
SMOKING CESSATION FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION
A significant body of evidence exists supporting that smoking
cessation is effective in the secondary prevention of AMI and
reduces AMI mortality rates.4 23–25 The OASIS 5 study revealed
that adherence to smoking cessation interventions among recent
quitters within 6 months of an index AMI was associated with a
43% RR reduction for recurrent myocardial infarction.4 The
survival and ventricular enlargement (SA
VE) trial found that
smoking cessation among people who had left ventricular systolic
dysfunction secondary to AMI was associated with a 32% reduc-
tion in risk of death/recurrent myocardial infarction during a
median follow-up period of 42 months.26 Pooled estimates from
one systematic review revealed that people with established CHD
who quit smoking had a 32% and 36% risk reduction in non-
fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality, respectively.24
ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION FOR SECONDARY
PREVENTION
Individual RCTs have established the efficacy of antihypertensive
medications in secondary prevention of AMI to be approximately
20–25% despite the differences in the study populations in terms
of presence or absence of left ventricular dysfunction or heart
failure.26–29 In addition, a systematic review focusing on specific
antihypertensive agents showed that the use of long-term
β-blockers reduces the risk of reinfarction by approximately
25%.30 In their meta-analysis, Pepine et al31 demonstrated that
verapamil reduced the incidence of non-fatal reinfarction by
21% among patients with CVDs. In patients with preserved left
ventricular function, ACE inhibitors have been shown to be
effective in the secondary prevention of both fatal and non-fatal
myocardial infarction by 17.3%.32 The role of calcium antago-
nists in secondary prevention has been controversial, with some
studies showing calcium antagonists to be more harmful than
beneficial, particularly in increasing the risk of AMI among
hypertensive patients.33 34 It has been argued however that indi-
vidual calcium antagonists should be taken into consideration
while analysing their efficacy.31
STATINS FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION
Several studies have investigated the impact of statins in the sec-
ondary prevention of coronary heart diseases. RCTs involving
patients from a range of age groups, different cholesterol levels,
C reactive protein levels with/without a history of angina or pre-
vious myocardial infarction have revealed statin efficacy ranging
from 19% to 30%.35–37
Afilalo et al38 conducted a meta-analysis that showed that
statins reduced the risk of reinfarction by 26%. These findings
are
similar
to
other
meta-analyses
done
by
Cholesterol
Treatment Trialists Collaborators, Sheng et al and
Gould
et al,39–41 who reported 23%, 28% and 29.5% RR reduction of
myocardial infarction, respectively. When comparing the efficacy
of statins by gender, the overall risk reduction of major coronary
events was found to be similar among men and women
(approximately 30%).42 When assessing the efficacy of intensive
(high dose) versus less intensive statin therapies (low dose), a
meta-analysis of RCTs established that more intensive statin
therapy was associated with a further 17% RR reduction of
myocardial infarction compared with the latter.43
DOES INFLUENZA VACCINE HAVE A PLACE IN ROUTINE
CORONARY PREVENTION?
Despite the large body of evidence supporting a role for influ-
enza vaccine in coronary prevention, rates of influenza vaccin-
ation in patients with heart diseases are low,44 and vaccination is
not a priority among physicians. A significant proportion of
healthcare budgets is spent on the acute treatment of AMI and
the long-term management of CHD. Costs per year of life saved
range from US$4350 for smoking cessation programmes to US
$142–760 for statin use in under 65 year olds.45 46 Further
gains in prevention of CHD would therefore likely be cost-
effective, especially if using a low-cost strategy such as influenza
vaccination. Influenza vaccination is a relatively cheap, safe and
evidence-based public health measure that is underused in
at-risk populations currently. Influenza vaccination has been
shown to be cost-effective in preventing influenza-like illnesses
and hospitalisation for pneumonia and influenza, without any
consideration of its efficacy in the prevention of AMI.47 It is
therefore likely that influenza vaccine could be highly cost-
effective in the prevention of AMI particularly for high-risk

coronary interventions compared with influenza vaccination and
highlights the potential gains of including vaccination in routine
prevention of CHD.
A well-powered RCT of influenza vaccine in AMI prevention
would add to the available evidence.48 However, there is
already compelling evidence that influenza vaccine should be
considered as an integral part of CHD management and preven-
tion. While it is recommended in many guidelines for patients
with coronary artery disease, rates of vaccination in risk groups
aged <65 years are low.49 In addition, this recommendation is
seen as one that aims to prevent influenza, rather than to reduce
the risk of AMI. A paradigm change may be required to encour-
age clinicians to see influenza vaccine as a cheap, safe and effect-
ive additional prevention strategy for patients with CHD.
