IMPORTANCE Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1
(UCH-L1) have been widely studied and show promise for clinical usefulness in suspected
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and concussion. Understanding their diagnostic accuracy over
time will help translate them into clinical practice.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the temporal profiles of GFAP and UCH-L1 in a large cohort of trauma
patients seen at the emergency department and to assess their diagnostic accuracy over
time, both individually and in combination, for detecting mild to moderate TBI (MMTBI),
traumatic intracranial lesions on head computed tomography (CT), and neurosurgical
intervention.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study enrolled adult trauma
patients seen at a level I trauma center from March 1, 2010, to March 5, 2014. All patients
underwent rigorous screening to determine whether they had experienced an MMTBI (blunt
head trauma with loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation and a Glasgow Coma
Scale score of 9-15). Of 3025 trauma patients assessed, 1030 met eligibility criteria for
enrollment, and 446 declined participation. Initial blood samples were obtained in 584
patients enrolled within 4 hours of injury. Repeated blood sampling was conducted at 4, 8, 12,
16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, and 180 hours after injury.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnosis of MMTBI, presence of traumatic intracranial
lesions on head CT scan, and neurosurgical intervention.
RESULTS A total of 1831 blood samples were drawn from 584 patients (mean [SD] age, 40
[16] years; 62.0% [362 of 584] male) over 7 days. Both GFAP and UCH-L1 were detectible
within 1 hour of injury. GFAP peaked at 20 hours after injury and slowly declined over 72
hours. UCH-L1 rose rapidly and peaked at 8 hours after injury and declined rapidly over 48
hours. Over the course of 1 week, GFAP demonstrated a diagnostic range of areas under the
curve for detecting MMTBI of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.69-0.77) to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00), and
UCH-L1 demonstrated a diagnostic range of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.02-0.50) to 0.67 (95% CI,
0.53-0.81). For detecting intracranial lesions on CT, the diagnostic ranges of areas under the
curve were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92) to 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.00)for GFAP and 0.31 (95% CI,
0-0.63) to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85) for UCH-L1. For distinguishing patients with and without
a neurosurgical intervention, the range for GFAP was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) to 1.00 (95%
CI, 1.00-1.00), and the range for UCH-L1 was 0.50 (95% CI, 0-1.00) to 0.92 (95% CI,
0.83-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE GFAP performed consistently in detecting MMTBI, CT lesions,
and neurosurgical intervention across 7 days. UCH-L1 performed best in the early postinjury
period.

A
blood test for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is on the ho-
rizon, and private enterprises are commercializing TBI
biomarkers for US Food and Drug Administration ap-
proval. Research in the field of TBI biomarkers and concus-
sion has skyrocketed in the last decade.1-3 Two promising brain
injurybiomarkershaveemergedformildTBI,namely,glialpro-
tein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal protein
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1). GFAP is an as-
troglial biomarker of injury and is found in the astroglial skel-
eton of both white and gray brain matter.4 UCH-L1 is a neuro-
nalbraininjurybiomarkerfoundinhighabundanceinneurons
and has previously been used as a histological biomarker.5

ranges between 94% to 100% in both children and adults.6-10
Notably, GFAP and UCH-L1 are elevated in patients with mild
TBI requiring neurosurgical intervention and can predict
with high sensitivity which patients with mild TBI will require
neurosurgery.6,7Moreover,GFAPperformsconsiderablywellin

there is an inadequate understanding of the temporal pro-
files of GFAP and UCH-L1 in human serum, particularly after
a mild TBI. Most important, there is insufficient knowledge as

patients seen at an emergency department (ED) with and with-
out mild to moderate TBI (MMTBI) and assessed their diag-
nostic accuracy for detecting traumatic intracranial lesions on
head CT and neurosurgical intervention over time. Because of
the heterogeneous nature of TBI and the problems with in-
jury classification, we included patients with TBI with a
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9 to 15 (mild to moderate).
However, the focus of our study centered on mild TBI; 97.8%
(318 of 325) of our patients with TBI had a GCS score of 13-15.
Methods
Study Population
Thisprospectivecohortstudyenrolledaconveniencesampleof
adulttraumapatientsseenattheEDofalevelItraumacenter(Or-
lando Regional Medical Center) within 4 hours of injury from
March1,2010,toMarch5,2014.Thisstudywasapprovedbythe
OrlandoRegionalMedicalCenterInstitutionalReviewBoard,and
writteninformedconsentwasobtainedfromeachpatientorhis
or her legal authorized representative before enrollment.
Eligibility for MMTBI was determined by the treating phy-
sician (including L.P., S.S., P.G., K.D.W., and other nonau-
thors) based on a history of blunt head trauma followed by
either loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation in pa-
tients seen at the ED within 4 hours of injury with a GCS score
of 9 to 15. Eligibility was also prospectively verified by the re-
search team (including L.P., C.F.B., C.N.T., N.J.A., M.A.L.,
C.A.H., D.I.M.G., and other nonauthors) before enrollment.
Head CT scans were performed at the discretion of the treat-
ing physician. Patients were excluded if they (1) were younger
than 18 years; (2) had no history of trauma as their primary
event(eg,syncopeorseizure);(3)hadknowndementia,chronic
psychosis,oractivecentralnervoussystempathology;(4)were
pregnant;(5)wereincarcerated;or(6)hadasystolicbloodpres-
sure less than 100 mm Hg.
The non-TBI general trauma group included patients with
a GCS score of 15 seen at the ED with a traumatic mechanism
of injury but without TBI. They experienced similar mecha-
nisms of injury as the MMTBI group, but all had a normal men-
tal status since injury (as verified by the research team) and
had no evidence of acute brain injury or hemodynamic insta-
bility. These patients were carefully screened to ensure that
they had no loss of consciousness, no amnesia, and no altera-
tion in sensorium at any time after injury. The purpose of en-
rolling both patients with TBI and general trauma patients was
to simulate the real-world setting in which TBI biomarkers
would be used.
Study Procedures
All initial patient assessments were made by board-certified
emergency medicine physicians (including L.P., S.S., P.G.,
K.D.W., and other nonauthors) trained in a formal 1-hour ses-
sion on evaluating patient eligibility for the study. After ini-
tial screening, a meticulous secondary assessment was con-
ducted by the research team in the ED to ensure that each
patient met inclusion criteria and to verify any exclusion. All
prehospital and ED records were reviewed; patients, fami-
lies,andwitnesses(ifavailable)werecarefullyquestioned;and
Key Points
Question What is the time course and diagnostic accuracy of
serum glial and neuronal biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein
and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 for detecting mild to
moderate traumatic brain injury (MMTBI), traumatic intracranial
lesions on head computed tomography (CT), and neurosurgical
intervention?
Findings In this cohort study, a total of 1831 blood samples were
drawn in 584 trauma patients over 7 days. UCH-L1 peaked earlier
than GFAP, but GFAP was detectable for a longer period of time
and was associated with the severity of injury.
Meaning GFAP appeared to consistently detect MMTBI, CT
lesions, and neurosurgical intervention across 7 days, whereas
UCH-L1 performed best in the early postinjury period.

the final determination was made by the emergency physi-
ciantogetherwiththeresearchteam.Patientclassificationwas
performed prospectively. Blood samples were obtained from
each patient with MMTBI and each trauma patient within 4
hours of the reported time of injury. Repeated blood sam-
pling was conducted for as long as the patient remained in the
hospital at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120,
132,144,156,168,and180hoursafterinjury.Oncepatientswere
discharged, blood sampling was discontinued. For each blood
draw, a single vial of approximately 5 mL of blood was col-
lected and placed in clot tubes with a serum separator and
allowed to clot at room temperature. The blood was centri-
fuged within 30 minutes, and the serum was placed in bar-
coded aliquot containers and stored in a freezer at −70°C
until it was transported to a central laboratory. There, the
samples were analyzed in batches using sandwich enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays to GFAP and UCH-L1. Labora-
tory personnel processing the samples were masked to the
clinical data. After assessment and treatment in the ED, pa-
tients were either discharged home or admitted to the hospi-
tal based on the severity of their injuries, and patient manage-
ment was not altered by the study.
Trauma patients underwent standard CT scan of the head
based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician. The
pattern of CT scan ordering at this level I trauma center is such
that most patients with blunt head injury with subsequent
symptomshaveaheadCTscanperformedaspartofusualcare.
Physicians also ordered CT scans of the head in the general
trauma control participants based on mechanism of injury or
clinical circumstances. Computed tomography examina-
tions were interpreted by board-certified radiologists, who re-
corded location, extent, and type of brain injury. Radiologists
were masked to the study protocol but had the usual clinical
information.
Outcome Measures
The performance of GFAP and UCH-L1 in detecting brain in-
jury was evaluated over a 7-day period. The main outcome
measures included the performance of the biomarkers over
time for (1) detecting the presence of MMTBI and distinguish-
ing trauma patients with MMTBI from those without MMTBI,
(2) identifying traumatic intracranial lesions on CT scan, and
(3) having a neurosurgical intervention.
Intracranial lesions on CT included any acute traumatic in-
tracranial lesions visualized on CT scan, including intracra-
nial hemorrhage (epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid hem-
orrhage) or contusion, cerebral edema, diffuse axonal injury,
midline shift of intracranial contents or signs of brain hernia-
tion,andpneumocephalus.Neurosurgicalinterventionwasde-
fined as either death within 7 days secondary to brain injury
or the need for any of the following procedures within 7 days:
craniotomy, elevation of skull fracture, intracranial pressure
monitoring, or intubation for brain injury.13
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics with means and proportions were used
to describe the data. For statistical analysis, biomarker levels
were treated as continuous data, measured in nanograms per
milliliter, and expressed as medians with interquartile ranges
(IQRs). Data were assessed for equality of variance and distri-
bution. Logarithmic transformations were conducted on non-
normally distributed data. Group comparisons were per-
formed using independent-sample t test with variance
consideration and the χ2 test. Receiver operating characteris-
tic curves were created to explore the ability of the biomark-
ers to identify the presence of a TBI, detect intracranial le-
sions on CT scan, and predict those having a neurosurgical
intervention. Estimates of the areas under the curves (AUCs)
were obtained, with an AUC of 0.5 indicating no discrimina-
tion and an AUC of 1.0 indicating a perfect diagnostic test. Clas-
sification performance was assessed by the sensitivity, speci-
ficity,andpositiveandnegativepredictivevalueswith95%CIs.
All analyses were performed using a statistical software pack-
age (SPSS, version 22.0; IBM Corporation).
Biomarker Analysis
Serum GFAP and UCH-L1 levels were measured in duplicate
for each sample using a validated enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay platform (Banyan Biomarkers Inc). For the GFAP as-
say, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) is 0.030 ng/mL,
and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) is 50.000 ng/
mL. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) is 0.008 ng/mL. For
the UCH-L1 assay, the LLOQ is 0.100 ng/mL, and the ULOQ is
9.000 ng/mL. The LLOD is 0.045 ng/mL. Any samples yield-
ing a signal over the quantification or calibrator range were di-
luted and reassayed.
Results
Over the study period, 3025 trauma patients were screened,
and 1030 patients met eligibility criteria for enrollment. There
were 446 trauma patients who were eligible and declined to
participateand584traumapatientswhowereenrolled.Demo-
graphiccharacteristicsbetweenenrolledpatientsandthosenot
enrolled were similar. Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age
of 40 (16) years (age range, 18-83 years), and nonenrolled pa-
tients had a mean (SD) age of 41 (17) years (age range, 18-88
years) (P = .39). The proportion of men was 62.0% (362 of 584)
for enrolled patients vs 58.7% (262 of 446) for nonenrolled pa-
tients (P = .48). Race/ethnicity was also not significantly dif-
ferent (P = .07).
Of 584 enrolled participants, 325 (55.7%) had trauma with
MMTBI, and 259 (44.3%) had trauma without MMTBI. Among
patients with TBI, 318 of 325 (97.8%) had mild TBI and a GCS
score of 13 to 15, and only 7 of 325 (2.2%) had moderate TBI
and a GCS score of 9 to 12. All trauma patients without MMTBI
had a GCS score of 15. Figure 1 shows the distribution of en-
rolled patients. Computed tomography scans of the head were
performed in 315 of 325 (96.9%) patients with MMTBI and in
97 of 259 (37.5%) trauma patients without MMTBI. Intracra-
nial lesions were found in 35 of 325 (10.8%) patients with
MMTBI and in none of the trauma patients without MMTBI.
The distribution of clinical characteristics of all enrolled pa-
tients is summarized in Table 1. Neurosurgical interventions

in none of the trauma controls. Five patients were intubated
for worsening mental status (one received hyperosmolar
therapy), and 2 patients had craniotomies for repair or eleva-
tion of open skull fractures.
There were a total of 1831 blood samples drawn in 584 pa-
tients (1243 with MMTBI and 588 trauma controls). All pa-
tients had serum samples drawn within 4 hours of injury, with
a mean (SD) time from injury to serum sample collection of 3.0
(0.8) hours. The mean (SD) times from injury to initial sam-
pling were 3.0 (0.9) hours for trauma patients with MMTBI and
3.1 (0.8) hours for trauma patients without MMTBI. Five hun-
dred eighty-four patients had samples drawn between injury
and 4 hours, and the numbers of patients having samples ob-
tained at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120,
132, 144, 156, 168, and 180 hours after injury were 429, 136,
107, 96, 88, 81, 57, 50, 41, 38, 28, 25, 13, 13, 10, 12, 11, 8, and 4,
respectively.
Amongtraumacontrolpatients,333of588(56.6%)samples
were below the LLOD and 130 (22.1%) were below the LLOQ for

L1.InpatientswithTBI,146of1243(11.7%)sampleswerebelow
the LLOD and 143 (11.5%) were below the LLOQ for UCH-L1.
The time course of GFAP and UCH-L1 in all trauma pa-
tients is shown in Figure 2A. The serum concentration of GFAP
was detectible within 1 hour of injury and reached a peak at
20 hours after injury. Concentrations steadily decreased over
72 hours. GFAP levels were still detectable at 168 hours (7 days)
after injury but remained at lower levels between 72 and 180
hours after injury. In contrast, UCH-L1 rose more rapidly after
injuryandreachedapeakat8hours.ConcentrationsofUCH-L1
decreased steadily over 48 hours and had small peaks and
troughs over 7 days.
In the patients with MMTBI, glial injury biomarker GFAP
levels were significantly higher (median, 0.112 ng/mL; IQR,
0.030-0.462 ng/mL; range, 0.008-8.078 ng/mL) compared
with the trauma controls (median, 0.008 ng/mL; IQR, 0.008-
0.030 ng/mL; range, 0.008-0.773 ng/mL) (P < .001). The lev-
els of neuronal injury biomarker UCH-L1 were also signifi-
cantly higher (median, 0.258 ng/mL; IQR, 0.109-0.627 ng/
mL; range, 0.045-9.000 ng/mL) compared with the trauma
controls(median,0.171ng/mL;IQR,0.100-0.417ng/mL;range,
0.045-4.241 ng/mL) (P < .001). The temporal profiles of se-
rum GFAP and UCH-L1 in trauma patients with and without
MMTBI are shown in Figure 2B. Concentrations of GFAP were
significantly higher (P < .05) in patients with TBI than in pa-
tients without TBI at every time point after injury over 7 days
except at 144, 156, and 168 hours after injury. Concentrations
of UCH-L1 were significantly higher in patients with TBI at en-
rollment and 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after injury. The ability of
GFAPandUCH-L1todistinguishtraumapatientswithandwith-
out MMTBI was assessed over 7 days by calculating the AUC

demonstrated a range of AUCs between 0.73 (95% CI, 0.69-
0.77) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00), and UCH-L1 demon-
strated AUCs between 0.30 (95% CI, 0.02-0.58) and 0.67 (95%
CI, 0.53-0.81). When GFAP and UCH-L1 were combined, the
AUC ranged from 0.64 (95% CI, 0.35-0.92) to 0.89 (95% CI,
0.79-0.99) and closely mimicked the pattern of GFAP. GFAP
outperformed UCH-L1 at all time points. The combination of
GFAP and UCH-L1 marginally outperformed GFAP alone at en-
rollment and 8, 36, 60, and 168 hours; however, the differ-
ences were not statistically significant.
In patients with traumatic intracranial lesions on CT, GFAP
levels were significantly elevated (median, 0.588 ng/mL;
IQR, 0.140-2.014 ng/mL; range, 0.008-8.078 ng/mL) com-
pared with those without lesions (median, 0.033 ng/mL; IQR,
0.008-0.189 ng/mL; range, 0.008-7.785 ng/mL) (P < .001).
Similarly, UCH-L1 was significantly higher in those with le-
sions (median, 0.319 ng/mL; IQR, 0.131-0.811 ng/mL; range,
0.045-9.000 ng/mL) than those without lesions (median,
0.250ng/mL;IQR,0.106-0.586ng/mL;range,0.045-9.000ng/
mL) (P < .001). In Figure 3A, the time courses of GFAP and
UCH-L1 are compared in patients with intracranial lesions on
initial head CT (CT positive) and those without intracranial le-
sions (CT negative). Concentrations of GFAP were signifi-
cantlyhigher(P < .05)inpatientswithintracraniallesionsthan
in those without lesions at every time point after injury over
7 days except at 168 hours after injury. Concentrations of
UCH-L1 were significantly higher in patients with intracra-
nial lesions at enrollment and 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 hours af-
ter injury but not at any later time points. The ability of GFAP
and UCH-L1 to detect traumatic intracranial lesions on CT was
assessed over 7 days by calculating the AUC at each time point
after injury (Table 2). GFAP demonstrated a range of AUCs be-
tween 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.00),
andUCH-L1demonstratedAUCsbetween0.31(95%CI,0-0.63)
and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85). When GFAP and UCH-L1 were
combined,theAUCrangedfrom0.75(95%CI,0.33-1.00)to0.97
(95% CI, 0.93-1.00) and corresponded closely with GFAP. GFAP

outperformed UCH-L1 at all time points. The combination of
GFAP and UCH-L1 marginally outperformed GFAP alone at 12,
24, 108, 132, and 144 hours; however, the differences were not
statistically significant.
In patients requiring neurosurgical intervention, overall
GFAP levels were significantly elevated (median, 1.847 ng/
mL; IQR, 0.418-4.421 ng/mL; range, 0.119-8.078 ng/mL) com-
pared with those not requiring such interventions (median,
0.054ng/mL;IQR,0.008-0.297ng/mL;range,0.008-7.973ng/
mL) (P < .001). Similarly, UCH-L1 was significantly higher in
those requiring neurosurgical intervention (median, 0.508 ng/
mL; IQR, 0.224-1.341 ng/mL; range, 0.100-9.000 ng/mL) than
inthosenotrequiringintervention(median,0.250ng/mL;IQR,
0.106-0.593 ng/mL; range, 0.045-9.000 ng/mL) (P < .001). In
Figure 3B, the temporal profiles of GFAP and UCH-L1 are com-
pared in patients having a neurosurgical intervention and in
those not having a neurosurgical intervention. Concentra-
tions of GFAP were significantly higher (P < .05) with a neu-
rosurgical intervention at every time point after injury over 7
days except at 168 and 180 hours after injury. Concentrations
of UCH-L1 were significantly higher in patients with a neuro-
surgical intervention at enrollment and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36,
48, and 96 hours after injury but not at any other time points.
The association between GFAP and UCH-L1 and having a neu-
rosurgical intervention was assessed over 7 days by calculat-
ingtheAUCateachtimepointafterinjury(Table3).GFAPdem-
onstratedarangeofAUCsbetween0.91(95%CI,0.79-1.00)and

tween 0.50 (95% CI, 0-1.00) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-1.00).
When GFAP and UCH-L1 were combined, the AUC ranged from
0.50 (95% CI, 0-1.00) to 1.00 (95% CI, 1.00-1.00) and corre-
sponded closely with GFAP. GFAP outperformed UCH-L1 at all
time points. The combination of GFAP and UCH-L1 outper-
formed GFAP alone at the earliest time points after injury,

including at enrollment and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 36, and 84 hours;
however, the differences were not statistically significant.
When we adjusted for age, sex, and GCS score, the stron-
gest predictor of having an intracranial lesion on CT was the
level of serum GFAP (odds ratio, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.69-4.43). Cor-
respondingly, the strongest predictor of having a neurosurgi-
cal intervention was also the level of serum GFAP (odds ratio,
2.57; 95% CI, 2.04-3.21).
Discussion
This prospective study assessed the temporal profiles and di-
agnostic accuracy at 20 distinct time points over 7 days of the
glial and neuronal biomarkers GFAP and UCH-L1 in a large co-
hort of trauma patients seen at a single level I trauma center.
This study is among the first and largest studies to assess the
temporal profiles of these 2 biomarkers in a trauma popula-
tion with and without mild TBI. The performance of GFAP and
UCH-L1 alone and in combination was compared in patients
with and without TBI and in those with traumatic intracra-
nial lesions to capture the setting in which a blood test for TBI
biomarkers would be used clinically. For this reason, unin-
jured healthy control patients were not included in this analy-
sis. Concentrations of these 2 biomarkers have already been
wellcharacterizedinuninjuredhealthycontrolpatients.6,7This
study has important clinical implications for when these TBI
biomarkers should be used by health care professionals after

injury, whereas the ability of UCH-L1 seems to be more lim-
ited to the earliest time points after injury. Both biomarkers
have an excellent predictive value for predicting neurosurgi-
cal intervention early after injury. UCH-L1 performed best
within 16 hours of injury. Determining whether a patient with
an MMTBI will require a neurosurgical intervention is most im-
portant within 24 hours after injury to allow decisions such
as transferring a patient to a trauma center or deciding whether
someone should be admitted for observation.
We elected to study both mild and moderate injury be-
cause TBI on the mild end of the spectrum is heterogeneous.
Initial GCS scores in the ED in this population can be inaccu-
rate, and the classification of a TBI as mild or moderate can
change based on neuroimaging results and the presence of fac-
tors that change mental status, such as intoxication, medica-
tions, and other injuries. A patient with a GCS score of 15 who
hasanacutebleedonCTscancanbeclassifiedashavingamod-
erate injury. Conversely, a patient with a GCS score of 11 who
has no evidence of intracranial injury on CT scan can be clas-
sified as having a mild injury. Although we studied patients
with TBI with a GCS score of 9 to 15, 97.8% (318 of 325) of our
patients with TBI had a GCS score of 13 to 15.
BothglialbiomarkerGFAPandneuronalbiomarkerUCH-L1
were detectible within 1 hour of injury. GFAP reached a peak
at 20 hours after injury and steadily decreased over 72 hours
but was still detectable at 7 days. In contrast, UCH-L1 rose more
rapidly after injury than GFAP, reached a peak at 8 hours, and
decreased steadily over 48 hours. Therefore, the window for
detectingUCH-L1inmildTBIisnarrowbecauseitrisesandfalls
quickly after injury compared with GFAP. In the context of de-
veloping a point-of-care test, the early and rapid rise of UCH-L1
could be used to detect TBI immediately at the scene of in-
jury in settings such as in the ambulance, on the playing field,
or at the battlefield. The longer half-life of GFAP makes it a fa-
vorablebiomarkertouseinboththeacuteandsubacutephases
of injury because it is able to detect CT lesions for up to 7 days
after injury. Although its rise is not as rapid as UCH-L1, it per-
forms well for detecting mild TBI and CT lesions within 1 hour
of injury.
It is common for patients who have had a concussion or
mild TBI not to seek immediate medical attention. Therefore,
understanding the behavior of these biomarkers over days af-
ter injury is important for detection of injury in those who may
only seek medical care several days after injury. Patients with
mild TBI or concussion, who would normally have been dis-
chargedfromtheED,werecapturedinoursamplebecausethey
were admitted for other injuries. For detecting MMTBI (trauma
without MMTBI vs trauma with MMTBI), GFAP alone outper-
formed UCH-L1 alone at all time points, and the combination
of the 2 biomarkers did not appreciably improve the perfor-
mance of GFAP alone. Accordingly, when GFAP and UCH-L1
were combined to predict traumatic intracranial lesions on CT,
the combination of GFAP and UCH-L1 marginally outper-
formed GFAP alone, but the differences were not significant.
These findings are consistent with a recent study by Diaz-
Arrastia et al12 in which inclusion of UCH-L1 with GFAP did not
improve on GFAP level alone in predicting intracranial le-
sions on CT in a cohort of patients with mild to severe TBI.
We recognize that there are limitations to this study. Our
study addressed the severity of injury in the acute care set-
ting and did not describe long-term outcome in these pa-
tients. The main outcomes used in this study reflect current
standards of practice and accepted definitions of acute brain
injury severity. However, future studies to better define the se-
verity of concussion and mild TBI need to be pursued, par-
ticularly when neuroimaging is negative. Accordingly, we per-
formed a subgroup analysis of milder cases of MMTBI without
loss of consciousness (58 of 325 patients [or 17.8% of our total
population]) and compared them with trauma patients with-
out TBI. Overall levels of GFAP were significantly higher in pa-
tients with MMTBI with no loss of consciousness (milder in-
juries) compared with the trauma controls, which did not hold
true for UCH-L1 (eFigure in the Supplement). Although this de-
termination was not the objective of this study, it should be
explored further in future studies.
All patients were seen at a single level I trauma center to
assess their performance in a multiple-trauma setting. The set-
ting at a single level I site may limit the generalizability to other
centers, particularly community hospitals. However, the de-
mographics of our population are comparable to other trauma
centers across the country.
The number of samples available for analysis decreased
over the course of the study, which reflects the challenge of
obtaining samples over time in patients with less severe inju-
ries because they are not hospitalized as long. However, there
were many patients without TBI and patients with mild TBI

were admitted for other injuries. Important next steps will be
to capture samples within minutes of injury.
