Global epidemiology of drug resistance after failure of WHO 
recommended fi
 rst-line regimens for adult HIV-1 infection: 
a multicentre retrospective cohort study
The TenoRes Study Group*
Summary
Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for controlling HIV-1 infection through wide-scale treatment as 
prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Potent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens are 
increasingly used to treat and prevent HIV, although few data exist for frequency and risk factors of acquired drug 
resistance in regions hardest hit by the HIV pandemic. We aimed to do a global assessment of drug resistance after 
virological failure with fi
 rst-line tenofovir-containing ART.
Methods The TenoRes collaboration comprises adult HIV treatment cohorts and clinical trials of HIV drug resistance 
testing in Europe, Latin and North America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. We extracted and harmonised data for 
patients undergoing genotypic resistance testing after virological failure with a fi
 rst-line regimen containing tenofovir 
plus a cytosine analogue (lamivudine or emtricitabine) plus a non-nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI; 
efavirenz or nevirapine). We used an individual participant-level meta-analysis and multiple logistic regression to 
identify covariates associated with drug resistance. Our primary outcome was tenofovir resistance, defi
 ned as presence 
of K65R/N or K70E/G/Q mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene.
Findings We included 1926 patients from 36 countries with treatment failure between 1998 and 2015. Prevalence of 
tenofovir resistance was highest in sub-Saharan Africa (370/654 [57%]). Pre-ART CD4 cell count was the covariate 
most strongly associated with the development of tenofovir resistance (odds ratio [OR] 1·50, 95% CI 1·27–1·77 for 
CD4 cell count <100 cells per μL). Use of lamivudine versus emtricitabine increased the risk of tenofovir resistance 
across regions (OR 1·48, 95% CI 1·20–1·82). Of 700 individuals with tenofovir resistance, 578 (83%) had cytosine 
analogue resistance (M184V
/I mutation), 543 (78%) had major NNRTI resistance, and 457 (65%) had both. The mean 
plasma viral load at virological failure was similar in individuals with and without tenofovir resistance (145 700 copies 
per mL [SE 12 480] versus 133 900 copies per mL [SE 16 650; p=0·626]).
Interpretation We recorded drug resistance in a high proportion of patients after virological failure on a tenofovir-
containing fi
 rst-line regimen across low-income and middle-income regions. Eff
 ective surveillance for transmission 
of drug resistance is crucial.

Introduction
More than 35 million people worldwide are living with 
HIV-1.1 There is no eff
 ective vaccine and therefore control 
of the HIV pandemic relies heavily on combination 
antiretroviral therapy (cART). WHO treatment guidelines 
for adult HIV-1 infection recommend the nucleotide 
reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir for fi
 rst-
line ART, in combination with lamivudine or emtrici-
tabine and the non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase 
inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz.2 Older NRTIs such as the 
thymidine analogue drugs are being replaced by tenofovir 
and the NNRTI nevirapine, although mentioned in 
WHO guidelines, is being phased out from fi
 rst-line 
regimens.2
The global scale-up of cART has now reached 15 million 
treated individuals.1 The administration of cART at the 
time individuals with HIV-1 are initially diagnosed 
prevents immunological deterioration as early as possible 
and interrupts the spread of HIV-1 from newly diagnosed 
individuals.3 This strategy, referred to as treatment as 
prevention, is being studied especially in high-incidence 
regions and nearly always includes the use of fi
 rst-line 
tenofovir-containing ART regimens. Likewise, the 
strategy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) depends 
entirely on the administration of tenofovir or tenofovir 
and emtricitabine to uninfected individuals at high risk 
of HIV-1 infection.4
In individuals receiving tenofovir, HIV-1 develops 
phenotypically and clinically signifi
 cant resistance usually 
as a result of one mutation at position 65 (lysine to 
arginine; K65R) in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene.5 
Data from clinical trials and cohorts in high-income 
settings using tenofovir combined with NNRTI have 
reported low prevalence of tenofovir resistance at viral

failure,6–8 in stark contrast with reports from low-income 
and middle-income countries where prevalence seems to 
be much higher.9,10 Similarly, high-level resistance to 
NNRTI 
and 
the 
cytosine 
analogue 
component 
(emtricitabine and lamivudine) arise through changes to 
one aminoacid, which suggests a low genetic barrier to 
resistance for these drugs as well. In view of the pivotal 
role of tenofovir-containing ART as both treatment and 
prophylaxis, and the striking potential for drug resistance, 
we did a global assessment of drug resistance after 
virological failure with fi
 rst-line tenofovir-containing ART.
Methods
Study population and design
The TenoRes collaboration comprises adult HIV treat-
ment cohorts and clinical trials from Europe, Latin and 
North America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. Cohorts 
and trials were identifi
 ed by RWS and RKG as those 
known to do genotypic resistance testing through previous 
collaborations, the WHO HIV Drug Resistance Network, 
and through the International HIV Drug Resistance 
Workshop. Moreover, we did a systematic review using the 
keywords “HIV”, AND “tenofovir” AND “resistance” in 
PubMed for articles published between January, 1999, and 
June, 2015. We identifi
 ed 44 studies suitable for the 
reported analysis after applying the following inclusion 
criteria: documented virological failure after fi
 rst-line ART 
comprising 
tenofovir 
plus 
either 
lamivudine 
or 
emtricitabine plus either efavirenz or nevirapine 
(virological failure was defi
 ned by local viral load 
thresholds or surveillance protocols); a successful 
resistance test result associated with virological failure of 
cART; tenofovir-based ART for at least 4 months before 
virological failure; and absence of thymidine analogue 
mutations at resistance testing (appendix). Exclusion 
criteria were: studies reporting resistance data after 
tenofovir that was started after initial use of stavudine or 
zidovudine; and studies reporting tenofovir use without 
NNRTI. Data were extracted and harmonised by RWS, 
RKG, MT, and JG and stored in a central database.
We collected individual-level data for a predefi
 ned set 
of covariates: age at fi
 rst-line ART initiation, sex, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies of the prevalence of tenofovir 
resistance after failure of fi
 rst-line antiretroviral therapy with 
efavirenz or nevirapine (non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase 
inhibitors [NNRTIs]) in patients with HIV-1, published between 
January, 1999, and June, 2015, using the search terms “HIV” 
AND “tenofovir” AND “resistance”. We identifi
 ed studies done 
in untreated adults (age >15 years) in which either efavirenz or 
nevirapine was combined with tenofovir and either 
emtricitabine or lamivudine as fi
 rst line antiretroviral therapy. 
Several studies reported resistance data for tenofovir when the 
drug was started after initial use of stavudine or zidovudine; 
these studies were not reviewed further. We also excluded 
studies that reported tenofovir use without NNRTI because 
standard fi
 rst-line antiretroviral therapy under a public health 
approach is based on NNRTI in adults.
We identifi
 ed randomised controlled trials and a meta-analysis 
comparing NNRTI with protease inhibitors, in combination with 
tenofovir, which reported resistance data. Patients in high-income 
settings reported tenofovir resistance in 0–25% of virological 
failures and those in sub-Saharan Africa in 28–50%. The only other 
prospective study in sub-Saharan Africa was PASER-M, and was 
limited by few resistance data for patients given tenofovir plus 
NNRTI-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The 
remaining studies were largely from South Africa and reported a 
wide range of prevalence (between 23% and 70%) of tenofovir 
resistance after virological failure. In west Africa, one study 
reported that 57% of virological failures were tenofovir resistant in 
a very small sample of 23 patients. Although aforementioned 
studies also reported NNRTI and cytosine analogue resistance, 
they were unable to quantify to what extent tenofovir resistance 
was a marker for high-level compromise of the regimen.
We found no studies that specifi
 cally reported resistance data 
for patients given fi
 rst-line tenofovir in east Africa. No study 
reported resistance data from more than one continent, and 
none seemed adequately powered to establish the eff
 ect of 
co-administered reverse-transcriptase inhibitors on the 
emergence of tenofovir resistance.
Added value of this study
This study reports the most comprehensive assessment of 
HIV-1 drug resistance after scale-up of fi
 rst-line WHO 
recommended tenofovir-based antiretroviral regimens, 
showing that tenofovir resistance is surprisingly common in 
patients with treatment failure across many studies in all 
low-income regions. Importantly, these individuals also have 
notable resistance to other drugs in their regimen, leading to 
almost complete compromise of combination treatment. 
Challenging current perceptions in the specialty, our fi
 ndings 
show that tenofovir resistant viruses have substantial 
transmission potential. Furthermore, our results show that viral 
strain aff
 ects tenofovir resistance in Europe but is not the main 
driver for resistance in viruses circulating in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Newly identifi
 ed risk factors for resistance to tenofovir and 
NNRTI drugs include pre-treatment CD4 cell count (but not 
viral load) and co-administered antiretrovirals.
Implications of all the available evidence
Improvements in the quality of HIV care and viral load 
monitoring could mitigate the emergence and spread of 
tenofovir resistance, thereby prolonging the lifetime of 
tenofovir-containing regimens for both treatment and 
prophylaxis. Surveillance of tenofovir and NNRTI resistance 
should be a priority both in untreated and treated populations.

Statistical analysis
Our primary outcome was tenofovir resistance, defi
 ned 
as presence of K65R/N or K70E/G/Q mutations in the RT 
gene. Our secondary outcomes were resistance to fi
 rst 
generation NNRTI (efavirenz and nevirapine), defi
 ned as 
specifi
 c mutations at aminoacid positions 100, 103, 106, 
108, 181, 188, 190, and 225,11 and cytosine analogue 
resistance, defi
 ned as presence of M184V
/I. Our main 
exposures of interest were baseline CD4 cell count 
(<100 vs ≥100 cells per μL), baseline viral load (<100 000 vs 
≥100 000 copies HIV-1 RNA per mL; this cutoff
  was 
chosen because of fi
 ndings from previous studies12), 
nevirapine versus efavirenz, and lamivudine versus 
emtricitabine. For our primary analysis, we estimated the 
odds ratios (ORs) for tenofovir resistance within each 
study before pooling estimates across studies using a 
random-eff
 ects meta-analysis with DerSimonian-Laird 
weighting and estimates of heterogeneity taken from the 
Mantel-Haenszel model. We chose this method to ensure 
that we only compared patients in the same study and 
country, thereby minimising confounding by diff
 erences 
in care at the study or country level. Findings were not 
sensitive to the choice of method used for the meta-
analysis (ie, fi
 xed or random eff
 ects). We also used a 
continuity correction of 0·5 for counts of 0, although 
fi
 ndings were not sensitive to this choice.
We did sensitivity analyses to investigate whether 
associations changed when adjusted for possible con-
founders. Because of the sparseness of data in many 
studies, we were unable to adjust within-study associations 
for potential confounders. Instead, we did additional

analyses using logistic regression models with a random 
eff
 ect at study level to estimate associations before and 
after adjustment for possible confounders in a common 
subset of participants. To build the adjusted model, we 
included each of our main exposures and HIV subtype. 
We also considered for inclusion individual-level 
information about age, sex, year of treatment initiation, 
and length of time on tenofovir, but rejected these 
covariates because of a lack of any univariate association 
with tenofovir resistance. We chose to only use these 
models for working out the likely extent of confounding, 
because estimated associations from these models are 
partly derived from between-study comparisons.
To clarify whether the association between baseline CD4 
or baseline viral load and tenofovir resistance was linear (ie, 
followed a dose-response pattern), we categorised 
participants into four categories based on baseline CD4 cell 
count (<100, 100–200, 201–300, >300 cells per μL reference 
category) or baseline viral load (<25 000 [reference]; 
25 001–100 000; 100 001–300 000; >300 000 copies HIV-1 
RNA per mL). We assessed associations by plotting the 
estimated OR against the mean level of baseline CD4 (or 
baseline viral load), in a random-eff
 ects logistic regression 
model adjusted for region, co-administered drugs, and 
baseline viral load (or baseline CD4).
To assess the potential transmissibility of mutant 
viruses, we graphically compared the distribution of 
plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations of patients from the 
same study with and without tenofovir resistance.
We did not use multiple imputation to adjust for 
missing data because most missing data were the result 
of a lack of availability at the study level. Instead, we 
restricted analyses to the subset of participants with 
information available about all relevant covariates for 
each specifi
 c analysis. The appendix presents the 
amount of missing data and which studies contributed 
towards specifi
 c analyses. We used Stata (version 11.2) 
for all analyses.

Asia, and Latin America (table 2). As expected, in north 
America pre-ART median CD4 cell count was 144 cells 
per μL and 190  cells per μL in Europe. The proportion of 
individuals using emtricitabine (vs lamivudine) and 
efavirenz (vs nevirapine) varied signifi
 cantly by region. 
Emtricitabine was used signifi
 cantly more than 
lamivudine in Europe, North America, and west and 
central Africa, and efavirenz was used signifi
 cantly more 
than nevirapine in all regions apart from east and west 
and central Africa. The median duration of ART ranged 
from 11 to 26 months. Pre-treatment viral load ranged 
between 4·80 and 5·58 log copies per mL and was 
signifi
 cantly higher in eastern and western and central 
Africa and Latin America than the other regions (table 2).
Crude prevalence of tenofovir resistance in patients 
with treatment failure was highest in low-income and 
middle-income regions (fi
 gure 1). Prevalence of cytosine 
analogue resistance (M184V
/I) was highest in sub-
Saharan Africa and Latin America and lowest in western 
Europe. By contrast, resistance to NNRTI did not show 
this pattern (fi
 gure 1). Furthermore, the M184V
/I 
mutation was less common than NNRTI resistance 
across all regions except in eastern Africa. Of the 
700 patients with tenofovir resistance in the dataset, 
457 (65%) had resistance to both remaining drugs. 
Participants with tenofovir resistant viruses were likely to 
be resistant to one or both accompanying drugs and 
therefore have profound compromise of their regimen, 
as compared with those without tenofovir resistance 
(fi
 gure 1).
Low baseline CD4 cell count was consistently associated 
with a higher prevalence of tenofovir resistance across 
regions. The pooled OR for tenofovir in individuals with a 
CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per μL versus 100  cells 
per μL was 1·50 (95% CI 1·27–1·77; fi
 gure 2). By contrast, 
a high baseline viral load was only associated with a small, 
not signifi
 cant increase in tenofovir resistance (OR for 
viral load ≥100 000 copies per mL vs <100 000 copies per 
mL was 1·17, 95% CI 0·94–1·44; appendix). We compared 
tenofovir 
resistance 
by 
use 
of 
co-administered 
antiretrovirals with tenofovir as fi
 rst-line therapy. Use of 
lamivudine rather than emtricitabine (NRTIs) was 
associated with a higher prevalence of tenofovir resistance 
(OR 1·48, 95% CI 1·20–1·82), as was use of the NNRTI 
nevirapine rather than efavirenz (OR 1·46, 1·28–1·67; 
appendix). Subgroup analysis showed that as well as 
associations being consistent across regions, they were 
also generally similar across a range of study settings

(appendix), although there was some evidence of a greater 
eff
 ect size of baseline CD4 when efavirenz was co-
administered with tenofovir, as compared with nevirapine.
When considering the eff
 ect of baseline CD4, baseline 
viral load (fi
 gure 3), and co-administered antiretrovirals 
(appendix) on cytosine analogue and NNRTI resistance, 
we noted that the magnitude of associations were smaller 
than those recorded for tenofovir resistance.
We also assessed the relation between viral subtype C 
on acquisition of tenofovir resistance. We restricted this 
analysis to western European studies in view of the 
consistent standard of care available in this region and 
relatively lower level of subtype diversity in other regions 
(fi
 gure 1A). We also limited the comparison to subtypes 
found in immigrant populations to minimise bias due to 
socioeconomic factors (thereby excluding subtype B 
infections mainly recorded in participants born in 
western Europe). Tenofovir resistance was higher in 
subtype C compared with non-C, non-B infections with a 
pooled OR of 2·44 (1·66–3·59).
As a sensitivity analysis we studied risk factors for 
tenofovir resistance using univariate (adjusted only for 
region) and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
(appendix). We noted a dose-response relationship for 
baseline CD4, which was not markedly altered by 
adjustment for baseline viral load, viral subtype, or type 
of co-administered drug used (appendix). Baseline viral 
load of 100 000 or more copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL was 
not signifi
 cantly associated with tenofovir resistance 
(OR 1·31, 95% CI 0·91–1·91) and we noted no clear trend 
across increasing viral loads (appendix). Adjustment for 
several risk factors also had little eff
 ect on associations 
with tenofovir resistance of emtricitabine versus 
lamivudine and nevirapine versus efavirenz.
Finally, we compared the viral load at treatment failure 
in the presence and absence of tenofovir-associated 
mutations. The mean plasma viral load at treatment 
failure was not diff
 erent in the presence or absence of 
tenofovir associated mutations (145 700 copies HIV RNA 
per mL [SE 12 480] vs 133 900 copies [SE 16 650]; p=0·626; 
fi
 gure 4 shows the within-study viral load by region). 
These results did not change when analysis was restricted 
to individuals who had evidence of the K65R mutation, 
either with or without M184V
/I (appendix). Mutations at 
aminoacids K65 and M184 in the RT gene have been 
associated with suboptimum replication.13
Discussion
Our study has three main fi
 ndings relating to the 
prevalence, risk factors for, and transmissibility of 
tenofovir resistance. First, we noted that levels of tenofovir 
resistance in individuals with viral failure ranged from 
20% in Europe to more than 50% in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Second, a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per μL, 
treatment with nevirapine rather than efavirenz, and 
treatment with lamivudine rather than emtricitabine, 
were consistently associated with a 50% higher odds of 
tenofovir resistance in those with viral failure. Third, we 
noted that in patients with viral failure, viral loads were 
similar in the presence or absence of tenofovir resistance.
Our fi
 ndings are important in view of the fact that 
following WHO recommendations,2 tenofovir is replacing 
thymidine analogues (zidovudine and stavudine) as part 
of the NRTI backbone in fi
 rst-line regimens in

resource-limited settings. Every drug in these regimens 
can be compromised by one aminoacid mutation, and the 
combination therapy is therefore potentially fragile. In 
view of the crucial role of tenofovir-containing ART in 
both treatment and prevention of new infections, 
restriction of drug resistance in high-burden settings is of 
paramount importance. Understanding how common 
tenofovir resistance is, and how and why it varies, is key 
to its prevention. Although our risk factors are only 
associated with a modest 50% increase in odds, this 
translates to a roughly 10% increase in resistance in those 
who fail when the overall tenofovir resistance prevalence 
is about 50% (as recorded in sub-Saharan Africa).
We hypothesise that the regional diff
 erences in 
tenofovir resistance are due to the frequency of viral load 
monitoring with close patient follow-up and feedback of 
results. For example, although viral load monitoring is 
not routinely done in most low-income and middle-
income countries, in high-income countries viral load is 
tested three to four times per year with close patient 
follow-up and adherence support. Such an approach is 
likely to lead to earlier detection of viral failure, before 
selection of drug resistance mutations against tenofovir 
has occurred.14 This view is supported by the uncommon 
detection of drug resistance mutations in specimens 
with low viral load (400–1000 copies per mL) from 
patients given tenofovir in both high-income settings 
(fi
 gure 1; see higher prevalence of tenofovir resistance 
where viral load >1000 copies per mL is used as threshold 
in western Europe)15 and sub-Saharan Africa (Chunfu 
Yang, Centres for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA, 
personal communication). Tenofovir resistance could be 
limited by viral load monitoring,16 with rapid feedback to 
clinicians followed by adherence counselling to preserve 
fi
 rst line, or switch to second line when this approach 
fails. Furthermore, pre-ART (baseline) resistance testing 
for key NNRTI mutations could potentially protect 
against tenofovir resistance by avoiding use of partly 
active treatment regimens. In our report, transmitted 
NNRTI resistance was low in the regions studied 
(<10%),17 and therefore not likely to be a major driver of 
wide variation in drug resistance across income settings.
Other factors that vary geographically could also aff
 ect 
success of ART and should be noted. Treatment failure is 
associated not only with drug resistance, but also side-
eff
 ects. Efavirenz is associated with CNS side-eff
 ects 
such as sleep disturbance and is associated with 
treatment discontinuation.18 Furthermore, drug stock-
outs and other indicators of quality of HIV services that 
have shown geographic variation would also predispose 
to treatment failure.19 The issue of regional variation in 
adherence levels has received considerable attention, 
with data from several studies suggesting that adherence 
is not worse in sub-Saharan Africa compared with North 
America.20,21
With regards to increased tenofovir resistance in 
individuals with low baseline CD4 counts, this fi
 nding is 
consistent with results from the ACTG 5202 trial22 
suggesting higher frequency of RT mutations in patients 
given ART with low CD4 cell counts, and off
 er a benefi
 t 
of CD4 cell count measurement after diagnosis of HIV 
infection beyond establishing prophylaxis against 
opportunistic infections.23 Lamivudine warrants further 
study in fi
 rst-line regimens in view of data presented in 
our study and the confl
 icting reports regarding virological 
effi
  cacy of lamivudine versus emtricitabine.24–26 Of note, 
the diff
 erences between lamivudine and emtricitabine 
might become less important in high-income regions 
where implementation of the second generation 
integrase inhibitor dolutegravir occurs, in view of the fact 
that this agent has not been associated with any cytosine 
analogue resistance at virological failure.27
Viral load has been associated with transmission risk.28 
Despite evidence for diminished replication of tenofovir 
resistant viruses (containing the K65R mutation in the 
RT gene) in vitro, we noted similar viral loads in 
participants with and without tenofovir resistance. 
Therefore, there might be substantial potential for 
onward transmission to uninfected individuals,29 despite 
little evidence of K65R transmission up to now.30 This 
fi
 nding reinforces the need for drug resistance 
surveillance activities in both untreated and treated 
HIV-positive individuals.
There are several important limitations of our study. 
First, because we only included patients with virological 
failure related to existing study cohorts,1 our estimates of 
the prevalence of tenofovir resistance might not be 
representative in certain high-burden regions. Although 
this situation might have biased our fi
 ndings on absolute 
prevalences of tenofovir resistance, it is unlikely to have 
aff
 ected associations with baseline CD4 or co-
administered drugs. Second, we only included patients at 
failure so were unable to assess overall rates of tenofovir 
resistance in all patients starting fi
 rst-line treatment. We 
used this method because many of the contributing 
studies had no clear denominator, especially those done 
in resource-limited settings. However, extensive WHO-
led analysis reported that 15–35% (on treatment vs 
intention to treat) of patients in sub-Saharan Africa have 
virological failure by 12 months.31 Therefore, using a 
conservative 50% prevalence of tenofovir resistance at 
failure from our analysis, we suggest that it is likely that 
7·5–17·5% of individuals given tenofovir plus cytosine 
analogue plus efavirenz will develop tenofovir resistance 
within 1 year of treatment initiation under present 
practices in sub-Saharan Africa.
Third, our fi
 ndings on risk factors for tenofovir 
resistance were derived from an unadjusted meta-
analysis involving very diff
 erent study populations. 
Although this enhances the generalisability of results, it 
has the potential to lead to biased comparisons. However, 
we took measures to minimise biases. We exclusively 
used within-study and within-country comparisons for 
our primary analyses, thereby ensuring that comparisons

573
were for participants undergoing similar treatment 
monitoring practices. We tested associations between 
risk factors and found that they were generally weak. For 
example, baseline CD4 cell count and viral load were only 
weakly associated with one another and neither was 
strongly associated with type of co-administered drug. 
Additionally, we undertook sensitivity analyses, which 
suggested that adjustment for other covariates had 
minimum eff
 ect on estimated associations. Lastly, our 
data tended to be consistent with previous studies—eg, 
our fi
 ndings of higher resistance in subtype C patients 
are consistent with in-vitro data suggesting subtype C 
viruses are more susceptible to developing the K65R 
mutation.32
Fourth, despite our analysis being the largest drug 
resistance study ever undertaken after failure of fi
 rst-line 
tenofovir-containing cART, patient numbers were 
somewhat limited by the slow uptake of tenofovir-based 
regimens in west and central Africa, eastern Europe, and 
Asia (in particular China and Russia), and information 
about baseline viral load in these settings was 
uncommon. As a result, European countries, Thailand, 
and South Africa contributed substantially to the analysis.
In summary, extensive drug resistance emerges in a 
high proportion of patients after virological failure on a 
tenofovir-containing fi
 rst-line regimen across low-
income and middle-income regions. Optimisation of 
treatment programmes and eff
 ective surveillance for 
transmission of drug resistance is therefore crucial.
