In the United States, hepatitis C virus (HCV)–associated mor-
tality is increasing. From 2003-2013, the number of deaths as-
sociated with HCV has now surpassed 60 other nationally
notifiable infectious conditions combined. The increasing
HCV-associated mortality trend underscores the urgency in
finding, evaluating, and treating HCV-infected persons.

hepatitis C; mortality trends; death certificates;
causes of death.
Despite enthusiasm for the new curative, brief (12-week), all-
oral antiviral treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection,
the continued health burden [1] and increased mortality [2] for
HCV-infected patients in the United States remain underappre-
ciated. We examined national multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD)
data from 2003 to 2013 to provide more current estimates of
trends in hepatitis C–related mortality in the United States and
compared these with trends in deaths associated with 60 other
nationally notifiable infectious conditions (ONNICs) that are
routinely reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC).
METHODS
Death certificate information from the public-use MCOD data,
obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics, was ex-
amined. Mortality codes for 2 disease categories, hepatitis C and
ONNICs, as classified by the International Classification of Dis-
eases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [3], were examined. Deaths asso-
ciated with hepatitis C were defined as having the ICD-10 codes
B17.1 and B18.2 listed in the “record axis” MCOD fields. Deaths
associated with ONNICs [4] were defined as having any of the
ICD-10 codes associated with 60 conditions (see Supplementary
Appendix) recorded in the “record axis” MCOD fields. To en-
sure mutual exclusivity between the 2 disease categories, any
ONNIC-related death that also had a listing of hepatitis C
was excluded from the ONNICs category, which was, on aver-
age, 1067 deaths (range, 936–1193) per year.
To calculate mortality rates, the number of deaths associated
with HCV infection and ONNICs were divided by the total US
census population for each year and then adjusted to the age dis-
tribution of the standard US population in 2000 by using the di-
rect method [5]. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated based on the gamma distribution to estimate
the variance [6]. Trends in age-adjusted mortality rates were an-
alyzed using joinpoint regression [7]. The resulting trends were
described by the slope of the line segment or annual percentage
change by applying the least-squares linear regression method.
RESULTS
From 2003 to 2013, the number of deaths associated with hep-
atitis C listed on death certificates increased from 11 051 in 2003
to 19 368 in 2013 (Figure 1). These deaths represented an aver-
age annual increase of 865 deaths per year, and the average an-
nual percentage increase was 6.2% (P < .05). In comparison, the
number of deaths associated with ONNICs, 60 conditions in all,
decreased from 24 745 in 2003 to 17 915 in 2013 (see Supple-
mentary Appendix for listing of deaths in 2013 by specific in-
fectious condition). These deaths represented an average annual
decrease of 718 deaths per year (Figure 1), and the average an-
nual percentage decrease was 3.4% (P < .05). The decline in
ONNIC-related deaths was mostly due to a decline in human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–related deaths, and, to a lesser
extent, a decline in pneuomococcal disease–related and tuber-
culosis-related deaths. The number of HIV-related deaths de-
clined by 41.8% from 15 168 deaths in 2003 to 8831 deaths in
2013. Pneumococcal disease–related deaths decreased by 31.0%
from 1283 deaths in 2003 to 885 deaths in 2013; tuberculosis-
related deaths decreased by 28.2% from 1382 deaths in 2003 to
992 deaths in 2013. When combined, these 3 conditions were
associated with a 39.9% decline from 17 764 deaths in 2003 to
10 683 deaths in 2013.
In 2012, the number of deaths associated with hepatitis C
surpassed that of 60 ONNICs that are routinely reported to
CDC (Figure 1). The mortality rate, as opposed to the crude
number of deaths, associated with hepatitis C increased from
3.72 (95% CI, 3.65–3.79) deaths per 100 000 population in
2003 to 5.03 (95% CI, 4.96–5.11) deaths per 100 000 population
in 2013. These mortality rates represent an average annual in-
crease of 0.14 deaths per 100 000 population per year, and the
average annual percentage increase was 3.4% (P < .05). In com-
parison, the mortality rate associated with ONNICs decreased
from 8.51 (95% CI, 8.41–8.62) deaths per 100 000 population
in 2003 to 5.25 (95% CI, 5.17–5.33) deaths per 100 000

 population in 2013. These mortality rates represented an aver-
age annual decrease of 0.34 deaths per 100 000 population per
year, and the average annual percentage decrease was 4.9%
(P < .05). In 2013, 51.1% (n = 9899) of HCV-related deaths oc-
curred among persons aged 55–64 years (mean age, 59.7 years).
DISCUSSION
Despite improving therapies [8], our study found that deaths asso-
ciated with HCV continued to rise while deaths associated with 60
ONNICs that are routinely reported to CDC declined. The great
decline among deaths associated with HIV, pneumococcal disease,
and tuberculosis from the ONNICs category were likely due to im-
plementation of effective public health programs and policies.
One explanation for the increasing HCV-related mortality
could be that many HCV-infected persons are not receiving an-
tiviral therapy and achieving a sustained virologic response indic-
ative of a cure. In fact, one study found that only 19% of HCV
and 16% of HCV/HIV-coinfected patients were eligible for and
advanced to treatment [9]. Furthermore, only 13% and 11%, re-
spectively, completed treatment and 3% and 6%, respectively,
achieved a sustained virologic response [9]. Data from our study
and from previous analyses showed that HCV-related deaths
occurred mainly among those aged 55–64 years [2], indicating
the premature loss of life and economic burden with HCV in-
fection. The largest extant analysis of approximately 1600 well-
characterized HCV-infected patients in the United States who
died found that only 19% of them had HCV listed anywhere
on their death certificate, although 75% had premortem indica-
tions of substantial or extensive liver disease at time of death [10].
Even among HCV-infected patients whose death certificate listed
a liver-related cause of death, 59% did not have HCV listed as a
cause of death [10]. Therefore, we believe these data greatly un-
derestimate the true hepatitis C mortality burden.
There are many putative reasons why there remains underap-
preciation of the seriousness of HCV infection, an infection
among an estimated 3.2 million US residents [1],and continuing
deficiencies in the decades-long asymptomatic incubation period
that may make clinicians and patients discount the importance of
the infection; the lack of cohesive and vocal advocacy groups as
many patients were former injection drug users; “compassion fa-
tigue” from HIV/AIDS and other large acute public health prob-
lems; and, currently, a new therapeutic nihilism not about the
efficacy of antivirals but about their perceived cost, despite evi-
dent cost-effectiveness [12]. The unabated increasing trend in
the number of hepatitis C–related deaths documented from
1999 to 2013, predominantly among middle-aged persons, un-
derscores the urgency in finding, evaluating, and treating patients
in the largest infectious disease epidemic in the United States.
