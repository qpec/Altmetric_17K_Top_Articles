ABSTRACT  
 
Background 
Organ preserving strategies for rectal cancer patients that achieve a complete clinical response (cCR) after 
neoadjuvant therapy such as watch and wait (W&W) are gaining interest among patients and clinicians. In 
absence of evidence from randomized controlled trials, the International Watch & Wait Database (IWWD) 
was initiated in 2014. We aimed to describe the outcome of W&W patients based on pooled individual 
patient data.  
 
Methods 
Participating centres entered data into an online highly secured and encrypted research data server. Data 
included baseline characteristics, neoadjuvant therapy, imaging protocols, local regrowth, distant 
metastases rate and survival status. The present analysis concerns all patients with a clinical complete 
response (cCR) after neoadjuvant treatment who were managed by W&W.  
 
Findings 
Between April 2015 and June 2017, 1009 patients were identified in the database from 47 participating 
institutes (15 countries). 880 patients (87%) with a cCR were included. Median follow-up time was 3·4 
years (IQR 1·8 to 5·5). Two-year local regrowth rate was 25·3% (95%CI 22·3-28·6%), 88·3% of all local 
regrowth was diagnosed in the first two years, and was located in the bowel wall in 96·7%. Five-year overall 
survival was 84·6% (95%CI 80·8-87·6%), and five-year disease-specific survival was 93·8% (95%CI 90·8-
95·8%).  
 
Interpretation 
This is the largest series of patients with rectal cancer treated with a W&W approach, consisting of 
approximately 50% data from previous cohort series and 50% unpublished data. Local regrowth occurs 
mostly in the first two years and in the bowel wall, emphasizing the importance of endoscopic surveillance 
to ensure the option of deferred curative surgery. Local unsalvageable disease after W&W was rare. It is 
our hypothesis that the majority of the 6% rectal cancer-specific death was more related to tumour biology 
rather than to omission of surgery.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Long-term survival for locally advanced rectal cancer has improved considerably since the introduction of 
total mesorectal excision and neoadjuvant (chemo-)radiotherapy.1 However, this treatment remains 
associated with perioperative mortality of 2% and up to four times higher in the elderly.2,3 In addition, it 
can lead to temporary or permanent colostomy, and serious long-term morbidity such as urinary and 
sexual dysfunction in more than 60% of patients.4 Over the last years focus has shifted towards a more 
individualized approach with the aim of improving long-term quality of life and functional outcomes. This 
has led to a growing interest in organ preserving strategies in a strictly selected population.  
 
Combining neoadjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy has proven to be effective to downstage the primary 
tumour and it leads in about 20% of the patients to complete disappearance of the tumour and tumour 
positive lymph nodes, a pathological complete response (pCR), which is associated with favourable long-
term outcomes compared to those without complete response .5,6  
 
Since the first introduction of watch and wait (W&W) for rectal cancer patients with a clinical complete 
response (cCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy by Habr-Gama,7 multiple cohort series are now 
available in which surgery has been omitted.8-11 It is known that the diagnosis of a cCR based on the results 
of conventional imaging modalities does not perfectly correspond to a true CR, as local regrowth rates 
within 2 years of follow up range from 7 to 33%.12,13 Despite local tumour regrowth rates, the results so far 
are promising in terms of survival since the vast majority of local regrowths are amenable to salvage 
resection. In a recent meta-analysis, no overall survival benefit was suggested for surgical resection versus 
W&W in patients with a cCR.12  
 
Several factors may have contributed for a limited adoption of such strategy so far and its absence in most 
surgical oncology guidelines. Most available cohort series are small and have heterogeneous study 
populations, and therefore are not adequate to define the individualized oncological risk. Furthermore, 
international consensus on imaging strategies and timing to identify a cCR, or to detect cancer regrowth 
timely, is still lacking. Also, neoadjuvant treatment schedules, choice of chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
dosage are considerably variable across studies, subsequently resulting in a wide range complete clinical 
response rates (10 to 78%).9,10 Finally, data on long-term survival outcomes such as functional and quality 
of life results are still scarce. 
 
In this setting, more evidence supporting organ-preserving strategies is needed to implement W&W as a 
safe treatment option for selected cases. Randomized controlled trials for this indication are challenging 
for both practical and ethical reasons: Patients are likely to prefer avoiding surgery, especially when they 
are facing permanent colostomy. The International Watch & Wait database (IWWD) was established in 
February 2014.14 This was initiated by a collaboration of high-profile clinical experts, under the umbrella 
of EURECCA (European Registration of Cancer Care) and the Champalimaud Foundation Lisbon. The aim 
of this database is to collect all available data in order to expand knowledge on the benefits, risks and 
oncological safety of organ preserving strategies in rectal cancer. For the present study, the primary aim 
was to describe the pooled information after collection of patient-data of more than 1000 patients from our 
network, which consists of data from previously published cohort series and about 50% of unpublished 
data from smaller W&W centres. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the local regrowth-rate and survival in 
this population.

METHODS  
 
Study design  
This is an international multicentre registry study. In April 2015, the web-based database was opened for 
patient data registry. Data entry is performed online at participating centres under supervision of the 
participating investigator, and stored in a highly secured NEN7510 certified and encrypted research data 
server (ProMISe).15 The IWWD database contains information on patient and tumour characteristics at the 
time of diagnosis, the reason for organ-preserving treatment, type of neoadjuvant therapy, results of 
imaging modalities at diagnosis, reassessment after neoadjuvant therapy and follow-up, details of the 
treatment for disease recurrence, and survival status. All assessments were done according to local W&W 
protocol of the participating institutions. Data quality checks were performed by the data centre. All 
participating centres retain full ownership of their data and responsibility for accuracy in the information 
provided.  
 
Patient selection  
All patients with rectal cancer in whom the standard of care, TME surgery, was omitted after neoadjuvant 
therapy are eligible to be included in the IWWD. For the present analysis, we included patients with a cCR 
only, as defined according to each institution’s criteria. This could be patients who were treated with strict 
surveillance only, as well as patients without suspicion of residual tumour in whom a standard confirmative 
local excision was performed. All other reasons for inclusion in the database, as well as patients diagnosed 
with distant metastasis at baseline but a local complete clinical response were excluded for this analysis. 
 
Outcomes  
The primary aim was to describe the available information on internationally applied W&W strategies 
within our network. For baseline clinical tumour stage, data of all performed radiologic imaging modalities 
at baseline were combined. If MRI was performed, this was considered the leading imaging modality. The 
incidence of local tumour regrowth and distant metastasis during follow-up was assessed. Since the 2014 
Champalimaud consensus meeting, it is agreed that local tumour regrowth after an initial cCR should be 
distinguished from local recurrence after TME surgery, which is known for its poor prognosis, whereas 
local regrowth (after a cCR) is usually readily salvageable.16 Therefore, this is indicated as local regrowth-
rate in the present study. Furthermore, overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 
assessed. For analysis of DSS, deaths due to the primary malignancy (local disease and/or distant 
metastasis of rectal cancer) or related to treatment were considered an event.  
 
Statistical analysis  
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0 and Stata/SE version 12.0. 
Descriptive features were calculated for the whole registry, no comparisons were made. Median follow-up 
was calculated according to the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. The time to diagnosis of local regrowth was 
calculated from the date of decision for W&W. For survival analysis Kaplan-Meier survival methods were 
used. Date of diagnosis was considered the baseline time point for survival analysis and the actuarial rate 
of distant metastasis. If the date of diagnosis was unknown, this was estimated using the dates of endoscopy 
and imaging at baseline.  
 
Ethical approval  
This is an observational registry study. Data is entered into the online data server in a coded format. Ethical 
approval was handled according to local authorities per participating institute.  
 
Role of the funding source  
The funders had no role in the study design, data analysis or writing the report. The members of the 
executive board of the IWWD consortium shared the responsibility for the final decision to submit the 
report for publication.

RESULTS  
 
Patient characteristics  
On June 30th, 2017, 1009 patients were included in the database from 47 participating institutes and 15 
countries (appendix B). Of these, 880 patients had a cCR as defined by the criteria of participating institutes, 
and were included for the present analysis. Other reasons for inclusion in the database but exclusion for 
this analysis were clinical near complete response, or patient related factors such as refusal of surgery by 
patient or inoperability due to comorbidity (figure 1). Patient and tumour characteristics at baseline are 
listed in table 1. There was great variability between baseline characteristics from included centres. When 
looking at the three largest centres of our network, some differences were noted (appendix C).  
Diagnostic procedures  
Imaging modalities used at baseline and reassessment for local staging are listed in table 2. Baseline 
imaging protocols were varying. Almost all patients underwent endoscopy at baseline (96·4%), and in the 
three-quarters of patients MRI imaging was performed (77·0%).  
 
For identification of a cCR after neoadjuvant therapy, endoscopy was performed in 88·5% of cases. In 
44·9% of all patients that underwent endoscopy for reassesment after neoadjuvant therapy, biopsies were 
taken. Restaging MRI was performed in 70·5% of all patients. Less frequently performed were CT pelvis 
and endorectal ultrasound (29·7% and 7·6% respectively). In most patients (70·6%) two or more imaging 
modalities were combined for local restaging. Both endoscopy and MRI were done in 64·0% of all patients. 
A combination of DRE, endoscopy and MRI was performed in 45·2% of patients. In 44 patients local excision 
was performed in the initial treatment window without clinical evidence of local regrowth – of these, 88·6% 
had no residual adenocarcinoma. 
  
Neoadjuvant therapy  
Chemoradiotherapy was most commonly used (804/880 patients, 91·4%), with schedules of 45 Gy 
(24·6%), 50-50·4 Gy (50·4%), 54 Gy (14·5%) or 60 Gy (5·7%). In the majority of patients capecitabine 
(61·5%) or 5-FU (29·2%) was used. The compliance of chemoradiotherapy was high: 98·8% of all patients 
completed all radiotherapy, and 95·1% of patients completed the chemotherapy component. 
The different combinations of neoadjuvant therapy are displayed in table 3. In seven patients, the details 
of neoadjuvant therapy were unknown.  
 
Local regrowth 
Local regrowth occurred in 213 out of 880 patients, with a 2-year actuarial rate of 25·3% (95%CI 22·3-
28·6%). In 63·8% (n=136) local regrowth was diagnosed in the first year after the decision for a W&W 
regimen, and in 88·3% (n=158) within two years (figure 2). Local regrowths were located in the bowel wall 
in 96·7%. In 11 patients local regrowth was located in the regional lymph nodes, in four of whom 
simultaneously with tumour regrowth in the bowel wall. Only seven patients were diagnosed with tumour 
regrowth in the regional lymph nodes only (3·3%).  
 
For 148 out of 213 patients with local regrowth, details of surgical treatment for regrowth were available.  
Of these, 46 patients were treated with local excision (31·1%), of which 13 underwent additional surgical 
resection subsequently. In total 115 patients underwent TME resection for local regrowth (77·7%), of 
which 99·1% with curative intention. In 87·8% of all surgical resections for local regrowth, the resection 
margins were tumour negative (R0 resection), in 6·1% tumour margins were positive (R+), and in the 
remaining cases the margin involvment was unknown (6·1%). 
 
Distant metastasis  
Distant metastasis were diagnosed in 71 patients during follow-up, with a 3-year actuarial rate of 7·6% 
(95%CI 5·8-10.0). Only 9·9% (n=7) of all distant metastasis were diagnosed in the first year after diagnosis, 
47·9% (n=34) were diagnosed within 2 years, and 67·6% (n=48) within 3 years.  
  
6 
 
Distant metastasis were most frequently located in lungs (62·0%), followed by liver (40·8%). Thirteen 
patients (18·3%) were diagnosed with lung and liver metastasis simultaneously. Other locations of distant 
metastasis were distant lymph nodes (11·3%) and peritoneum (5·6%).  
In patients with local regrowth, the incidence of distant metastasis was 17·8% (38/213), whereas in 
patients with a sustained complete response this was 4·9% (33/634). Of the patients with both distant 
metastasis and local regrowth, the distant metastases were diagnosed prior to the local regrowth in 2 
patients (5·3%), simultaneously in 12 patients (within 3 months, 31·6%), and more than 3 months after 
the local regrowth in 19 patients (50·0%). For five patients (13·2%) the time between local regrowth and 
distant metastasis was unknown.  
 
Survival 
Five-year DSS was 93·8% (95%CI 90·8 - 95·8) and 5-year OS was 84·6% (95%CI 80·8 - 87·6) (figure 3). For 
patients with a sustained cCR, the 5-year DSS was 97·3% (95%CI 94·5-98·7) and 5-year OS was 87·9% 
(95%CI 83·8-91·0). For patients that were diagnosed with local regrowth, the 5-year DSS was 84·0% 
(95%CI 75·0-89·9) and 5-year OS 75·4% (95%CI 66·2-82·4). 
In 33 patients (3·75%) the cause of death was related to rectal cancer. Ten patients died of metastatic 
disease in the presence of a sustained local cCR. Fourteen patients who died of rectal cancer were diagnosed 
with both distant metastasis and local regrowth, and five patients only had local residual disease at the time 
of death. Of these five patients, two had undergone surgical resection for regrowth with curative intention, 
one had refused surgery, and in two patients the details were unknown. In the four remaining patients, the 
sites of rectal cancer at death were unknown.  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
This is the largest series of pooled individual data of rectal cancer patients with a W&W strategy after 
neoadjuvant therapy. The main aim of this study was to provide an insight in the strategies and real world 
oncological outcome of W&W series worldwide. The registry has collected data of more than 1000 patients, 
approximately 50% from published cohort studies, and 50% of unpublished data.7,8,10,11,17-19  
In the registry, 25·3% of patients in a W&W approach developed a local regrowth in the first two years of 
follow-up. This local regrowth rate is considerably higher than the pooled 2-year local regrowth rate of 
15·7% reported in the meta-analyis of Dossa et al. This is probably explained by the strict inclusion criteria 
in the studies of the meta-analysis, whereas the registry is more based on an ‘ all-comers’ strategy without 
narrow selection criteria. Most likely this better reflects the outcome of a W&W strategy on a more 
population-based level. The regrowths were nearly always located in the bowel wall (97%), highlighting 
the importance of endoscopic assessments in the follow-up protocols for W&W strategies. 
 
The survival outcome in this W&W population is excellent: a 5-year OS of 84·6% and a 5-year DSS of 93·8%. 
Despite the heterogeneity in the registry, these 5-year outcome figures are remarkable good compared to 
survival rates of rectal cancer patients who undergo surgery.20 The main concern about implementation of 
W&W strategies remains whether survival and the chance of curative treatment are compromised by not 
performing immediate surgery in patients with a clinical complete response, but rather to delay surgery 
and restrict it to only those patients who experience a regrowth. It is clear that patients with a sustained 
complete response are better off with a W&W policy, as immediate TME surgery could not have improved 
their 100% local control rate, and could only have contributed operative mortality and short and long term 
morbidity. The oncological prognosis should be broadly similar to pCR patients after TME surgery. The 
87·9% 5-year OS in patients with a sustained clinical complete response in the present study is comparable 
to the 5-year OS of 87·6% in pCR patients in the pooled analysis of Maas et al.6 Patients with a regrowth are 
at least theoretically at risk to develop uncurable local disease, and to develop metastases arising from the 
regrowth. 
 
  
7 
 
In this study, five out of 880 patients died of local tumour recurrence (0·6%). In two of these patients 
salvage treatment was technically not possible, one patients declined treatment, and in two patients the 
reason was not documented. If we presume the worst case scenario, that all four patients in which the sites 
of rectal cancer were unknown also died of local uncontrollable disease, the risk of locally unsalvagable 
disease would be between 0·2% to 1·3%. This is within the same range of the 0.2% reported in the recent 
meta-analysis of Dossa and collegues.12 Due to the inclusion of unpublished series and patients in our 
registry, this figure is most likely a reliable reflection of the true population risk. It can be used in a trade-
off discussion with a patient with a clinical complete response to decide between a W&W policy and TME 
surgery. The benefits of a radical resection should be balanced against the operative risk, short and long 
term morbidity and risk for definitive colostomy.  
 
It is more difficult to estimate the excess risk of metastatic disease in patients with a regrowth, if there is 
any. Patients with a regrowth most likely would have shown residual tumour and would not have been 
labeled pCR if they would have had TME surgery after the chemoradiation. It is well documented that 
incomplete responders have an inherently higher risk for metastases and a lower OS than complete 
responders, suggesting a more unfavorable biological profile. In the pooled analysis of Maas et al. 22·7% of 
non-pCR patients developed metastasis and 5-year OS was 76·5%.6 In our data, distant metastasis were 
diagnosed in 17·8% of patients that were diagnosed with local regrowth, and their 5-year OS was 75·4%. 
Although the two populations are somewhat different, the figures are in the same range. It is our hypothesis 
that the majority of the 6% deaths due to rectal cancer in the present series are due to metastatic disease 
that was already present at the time of diagnosis and treatment, and therefore related to the biology of the 
tumor rather then to the omission of TME surgery. 
 
This study has several limitations. First of all, this is a database-based registry study. As expected, we found 
considerable variances between participating centers in baseline characteristics, neoadjuvant therapy and 
imaging strategies. Although all participants have performed data entry with the same instructions and 
agreements, and multiple quality checks were performed to detect entry errors, it is possible that items are 
interpreted and filled in differently. We did not have access to the original patient reports, causing missing 
data on some details of imaging and treatment strategies. For example, details on the treatment for local 
regrowth was avaliable in only 69% of cases. This might be caused by the fact that W&W patients are often 
referred from W&W expert centers to their primary hospital for salvage therapy. However, the survival 
status was available. Because part of the data was prospectively collected at the participating institutes, but 
entered at a later date in the IWWD, it is possible that not all patients that initially were selected for W&W 
strategies are included in the database, potentially leading to selection bias.  
 
Despite these limitations, we feel that the results of this study are valuable and increase the knowledge on 
the risks and benefits of W&W for individual patients. The data collected so far show the importance of 
frequent endoscopic surveillance in W&W patients in the first two years of follow-up, the location and 
incidence of distant metastasis and the small risk of incurable disease. However, many uncertainties and 
clinical challenges remain. Importantly, long-term quality of life outcomes, and effects of 
(chemo)radiotherapy on bowel function in W&W patients are still unknown. As the percentage of cancer 
survivors is growing rapidly due to population screening and improved therapeutic strategies, the 
importance of quality of life outcomes and patient preferences grows concomittantly.  
 
It is our aim to expand the expert network on organ preservation in rectal cancer within the IWWD to 
provide evidence for the development of uniform neoadjuvant treatment, imaging and follow-up protocols, 
specifically including quality of life and functional outcomes. An international consensus meeting on W&W 
strategies is scheduled for the end of 2018. Moreover, by prospective collection of population-based data, 
we aim to improve the estimation of individualized risks, and to aid shared-decision making between 
doctors and patients. The IWWD consortium welcomes all interested clinicians that perform organ 
preserving stategies in rectal cancer patients to join our network.
