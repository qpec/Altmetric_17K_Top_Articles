Abstract
Background: Despite the growing and widespread use of glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide and desiccant,
very few studies have evaluated the extent and amount of human exposure.
Objective: We review documented levels of human exposure among workers in occupational settings and the
general population.
Methods: We conducted a review of scientific publications on glyphosate levels in humans; 19 studies were identified,
of which five investigated occupational exposure to glyphosate, 11 documented the exposure in general populations,
and three reported on both.
Results: Eight studies reported urinary levels in 423 occupationally and para-occupationally exposed subjects; 14
studies reported glyphosate levels in various biofluids on 3298 subjects from the general population. Average urinary
levels in occupationally exposed subjects varied from 0.26 to 73.5 μg/L; environmental exposure urinary levels ranged
from 0.16 to 7.6 μg/L. Only two studies measured temporal trends in exposure, both of which show increasing
proportions of individuals with detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine over time.
Conclusions: The current review highlights the paucity of data on glyphosate levels among individuals
exposed occupationally, para-occupationally, or environmentally to the herbicide. As such, it is challenging
to fully understand the extent of exposure overall and in vulnerable populations such as children. We recommend
further work to evaluate exposure across populations and geographic regions, apportion the exposure sources
(e.g., occupational, household use, food residues), and understand temporal trends.

Introduction
Glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide and desiccant,
was first sold in 1974 and has since become the most
commonly and intensively used herbicide worldwide [1].
It is available in a variety of chemical forms, such as iso-
propylamine salt, ammonium salt, diammonium salt,
dimethylammonium salt, and potassium salt [1]. Glypho-
sate is mixed with other chemicals known as “inert in-
gredients” to constitute glyphosate based herbicides,
which include the popular “Roundup®” and “RangerPro®”
products that are used in agricultural fields and home
gardens. The widespread application of glyphosate and
GBH to crops has spurred the spread of tolerant and re-
sistant weeds in the US, and worldwide, which in turn
has created the need for more frequent applications at
higher concentrations [1]. Individuals may be exposed to
glyphosate through various routes such as food and
drinking water, both in the occupational and environ-
mental settings [2]. Recent findings suggest glyphosate
and its metabolites may also spread by wind and water
erosion [3]. Glyphosate has also been found in dust
within non-agricultural homes, suggesting that the ex-
posure is not only occupational [4]. Glyphosate levels in
human beings can be quantified by measuring levels of
either glyphosate or its metabolite, AMPA.
In recent years, the carcinogenic potential of glypho-
sate has been under review and debate by multiple

 authoritative and regulatory bodies. In 2015, IARC clas-
sified glyphosate as a “probable human carcinogen” [5],
although in the same year EFSA declared that “glypho-
sate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans”
[6] based on typical, expected exposures to the general
public. The US EPA reviewed the carcinogenic potential
of glyphosate in 2016 and concluded that it is “not likely
to be carcinogenic to humans” [7] based on typical,
non-occupational exposures. The difference in conclu-
sions are likely the consequence of some studies being
excluded from the EFSA review, and some unpublished
data being included in the EPA review [5–7]. The con-
troversy over glyphosate’s carcinogenic classification is
based on various aspects, including differences in the
weight placed on the results of human epidemiological
studies. The details of this complex debate are beyond
the scope of this current review. Here, we aim to under-
stand the current information about glyphosate exposure
levels and patterns in humans.
Despite the growing and widespread use of glyphosate,
evidence of bioaccumulation of glyphosate and GBH ob-
served in rodent models [8], as well as increasing con-
cerns for and debates about adverse health outcomes
across the population, very few studies have evaluated
overall human exposure. Here, we review published re-
search documenting human exposure among workers
and the general population, including changes over time,
to provide crucial exposure information that could in-
form future risk assessments.
Methods
We conducted a review of scientific publications on gly-
phosate levels in humans, including both the general
population
and
occupationally
exposed
workers.
PubMed and Google Scholar searches were performed
using the following search terms: “glyphosate” (“glypho-
sate” OR “1071-83-6” OR “roundup” OR “N-(Phospho-
nomethyl)
glycine”)
or
(((“AMPA”)
NOT
“AMPA
receptor”)) OR “Aminomethylphosphonic acid”) AND
(“human”). The IARC carcinogen evaluation [5] the EPA
Revised Glyphosate Issue Paper [7], and several other
publications were also reviewed for additional relevant
articles. Finally, the references from each selected paper
were manually reviewed for additional pertinent studies.
No limitation on language was imposed on the search.
The search returned a total of 189 publications, five of
which were duplicates. After an abstract review, 139
studies were excluded because they were not pertinent,
leaving 45 articles to review as full-text. Of these, 26
studies were excluded because they were in vitro studies,
did not include data on humans, only focused on detec-
tion in the environment and not in human, or were edi-
torials or review articles with no original data. The
remaining 19 studies were used for the present review
(Table 1). Five of these studies investigated occupational
and para-occupational exposure to glyphosate, 11 studies
documented exposure in the general population, and
three reported on both (Fig. 1). Two raters reviewed the
studies independently for quality based on the quality
assessment tool published by the NIH [9], and discrep-
ancies were discussed until consensus was reached. The
mean quality score was 7.3 (Additional file 1: Table S1).
We extracted data on sample size, average glyphosate
concentration,
laboratory
technique,
and
population
from each publication. Data were checked for accuracy
by two reviewers. Units for reported averages were stan-
dardized to μg/L. Included studies reported summary es-
timates in a variety of ways, as arithmetic means,
geometric means or medians. To display the data in the
figures, we report the central tendency and range. When
the GM was available, this was shown as the central ten-
dency. When the GM was not available, but the median
was, we assumed that the GM was equal to the median,
since they should be approximately equal in a lognormal
distribution. In some cases, we assumed the reported
GM to be the LOD when at least 50% of the data were
below the LOD. When arithmetic mean and standard
distribution were reported, the GM was estimated from
the arithmetic mean using the formula GM ¼

where SDx is the standard deviation of the data on the
native scale and AM is the arithmetic mean of the data
on the native scale, as proposed by Rappaport (Add-
itional file 2: Table S2) [10]. Most papers reported
ranges; in a few cases we estimated the 99% limits of the
data assuming a lognormal distribution. Because of the
small number of available studies and the wide variety of
techniques used, a meta-analysis was not attempted for
these studies.
Results
We reviewed eight studies that reported personal expos-
ure to glyphosate in occupational settings; overall, 423
subjects were tested. Three of these studies reported
data on para-occupational exposure and included 73
spouses and 148 children of farmworkers (Table 1). Two
studies were conducted in the US [11–13], four in Eur-
ope [13–16], one in Mexico [17], and one in Sri Lanka
[18]. The studies mostly involved farmers [11, 12, 15,
17]; one study recruited forest workers [13], and two fo-
cused on horticulturalists [14, 16]. The reported mea-
sures of central tendency ranged from 0.26 to 73.5 μg/L
[17, 18]. All the studies involved urinary measures, al-
though the laboratory methods and LOD varied greatly
from 0.05 to 100 μg/L [13, 17]. Central tendency esti-
mates and ranges are plotted in Fig. 2. Except for one
study published in 1991 [13] including data collected in
1988, data reported in these studies was collected within

 the last 20 years, with the most recent sample collected
in 2017.
A study conducted in South Carolina and Minnesota
examined urinary glyphosate concentrations in farmers
and their families (n = 175) the day before, day of, and 3
days after glyphosate application to crops [11]. Farm
families who applied for pesticide applicators licenses
were
sent
solicitation
letters
for inclusion
in the
study. From those willing to be contacted, farmers
with families (defined as one spouse and at least one
child between the ages of 4 and 18 years of age) were
asked to collect the urine voids from five consecutive
days and fill out pre- and post-study questionnaires
detailing family activities from the week before and
week of the study. Glyphosate was measured with
HPLC, with an LOD of 1 μg/L. The percentage of
farmers with detectable values of glyphosate was 60%
on application days and declined to 27% on day three
after exposure. For farmers, the GM value of glypho-
sate was 3.2 μg/L on the application day. The percent-
age of spouses with levels of glyphosate above the
LOD was 2% on pre-application days, 4% on applica-
tion days, and 2% on the third day post-application.
The percentage of children with urinary glyphosate
levels above the LOD was 7% on pre-application days,
12% on application days, and 5% by the third day
post-application.
The
GMs
were
not
reported
for
spouses or children, as they were not calculated if less
than 25% of the individuals in the group had detect-
able values.
In a study of glyphosate concentrations among farm-
ing households in Iowa after glyphosate application con-
ducted in 2001 (n = 114), the adjusted GM of glyphosate
was 1.9 μg/L (95% CI: 1.3–2.5) in the urine of children
in farming families (adjusted for age, sex and urinary
creatinine) [12]. The fathers had a urinary creatinine ad-
justed GM of 1.6 μg/L (95% CI: 1.1–2.4), the mothers of
1.1 μg/L (95% CI: 0.71–1.8).
In another study, morning urine samples were col-
lected from 76 farmers across several geographic areas
in Mexico [17]. Assessment of glyphosate concentration
was carried out using ELISA with a LOD of 0.05 μg/L.
The mean value observed in the farming communities
was 0.26 μg/L.
A small Finnish study conducted in 1988 examined five
forest workers who sprayed a solution containing 8%
Roundup with a brush saw for 6 hours per day [13].
Workers used limited personal protective equipment,
wearing only cotton overalls, cotton or rubber gloves, hats
or safety helmets and rubber boots. Rain clothes were also
worn on days with precipitation. The hypothesized route
of exposure was reported by the authors as skin contamin-
ation, likely due to the limited personal protective equip-
ment and Roundup dispersed through the air. Air samples
collected at midweek during spraying contained < 1.25 μg
glyphosate/ m3 air. After a 3-week work period, the

 glyphosate concentration in the urine remained below de-
tection level (< 100 μg/L). Only one urine sample was fur-
ther quantified and found to contain a glyphosate
concentration of 85 μg/L.
A case study in France tested the presence of gly-
phosate in the urine of a farmer and his family (n = 5)
because of the occurrence of birth defects in the fam-
ily [15]. Glyphosate concentration in the farmer’s
urine reached a peak of 9.5 μg/L 7 h after spraying,
without personal protective equipment, and plateaued
at 2 μg/L 2 days after spraying. The concentration of
2 μg/L was also measured in one child 2 days after
spraying. The mother and 2 other children had no de-
tectable levels of glyphosate.
A study conducted in 2015 of amenity horticultural-
ists (n = 18) was conducted in Ireland with the aim of
measuring urinary biomarkers of occupational expo-
sures, including to glyphosate [14]. Public workers at
parks and other green spaces in Ireland were asked to
collect urine immediately before and after spraying gly-
phosate, and biosamples were analyzed with mass spec-
trometry (LOD: 0.5 μg/L). Pre-spraying samples had
significantly lower concentrations of urinary pesticide
concentrations, including glyphosate (mean: 0.71 (SD:
0.92) μg/L) compared to post-spraying samples (mean:
1.35 (SD: 2.18) μg/L).
In a similar study conducted in 2016 and 2017 on a
separate population of amenity horticulturalists (n = 20),
urinary biomarkers of glyphosate exposure were mea-
sured before, immediately after (within 1 hour), and the
first
urine
void
the
morning
after
spraying
with
Roundup® at work [16]. Each worker was also given the
option to collect additional urine voids. For each worker,
a peak urinary glyphosate level was identified. In the
study, 27% of the samples were below the LOQ, 76% of
which were either pre-task samples or morning-after
samples. Of the post-work samples, only 7% were below
the LOQ. There was a statistically significant difference
between the pre-task samples levels (mean (SD): 1.08
(1.20) μg/L) and the post-task sample levels (mean
(SD):1.72(1.53) μg/L)
or peak
sample levels (mean
(SD):2.53 (1.89) μg/L). There was not a statistically sig-
nificant difference between the pre-sample levels and
first morning void levels (mean (SD): 1.32 (1.32)).
In a study of 20 paddy farmers in Sri Lanka, re-
searchers examined the urinary metabolites of pesti-

 examine whether pesticides were related to kidney dis-
ease [18]. The study included 10 healthy farmers with-
out kidney disease living in a region with endemic
CKDu; their median urinary glyphosate levels was 73.5
(range: 40.2-80.0) μg/L.
We identified 14 studies reporting on glyphosate levels
in biofluids from the general population, with 3298 sub-
jects tested (Table 1). Exposure assessment in these stud-
ies was primarily based on urine samples (n = 11), though
some studies utilized maternal milk and urine (n = 1) or
the serum of umbilical cord and maternal blood (n = 2).
Four studies were conducted on pregnant women. While
most studies reported arithmetic means, others reported
GM [12], or medians [18–20]. The arithmetic mean levels
of glyphosate detected in urine samples ranged from 0.16
to 7.6 μg/L. The central tendencies and ranges of these
urinary levels are presented in Fig. 3. Where possible, the
GM and range are reported, or estimated from the median
or arithmetic mean and reported. There was a large de-
gree of variability in the LOD, which ranged from 0.02 to
15 μg/L [21, 22].
In a study completed in 2001 comparing farming and
non-farming
households
in
Iowa
(n = 98)
[12],
glyphosate concentrations in urine of children from
non-farming families ranged from 0.10–9.4 μg/L and the
adjusted GM of glyphosate was 2.5 μg/L (95% CI: 2.1–
3.1) (adjusted for age, sex and urinary creatinine). The
fathers in these families had a urinary creatinine adjusted
GM of 1.5 μg/L (95% CI: 1.2–2.0), the mothers of 1.2 μg/
L (95% CI: 0.91–1.6); 65% of non-farming mothers and
88% of non-farming children had detectable levels of
glyphosate in their urine.
A study conducted in 2014 and 2015 used HPLC and
mass spectrometry to examine milk and urine samples
from 41 lactating women in Idaho and Washington State
to determine whether glyphosate and AMPA could be
detected in either fluid [21]. Researchers sampled human
milk and urine from women of 18 years and older who
were 1–3 months postpartum and were breastfeeding
and/or pumping milk at least five times per day. The
LOD and LOQ for glyphosate in milk were 1.0 μg/L and
10.0 μg/L respectively, in urine were 0.02 μg/L and
0.10 μg/L respectively. The LOD and LOQ for AMPA in
milk were 1.0 μg/L and 10.0 μg/L, respectively, in urine
were 0.03 μg/L and 0.10 μg/L respectively. All milk sam-
ples had glyphosate and AMPA levels below the LOD.

 The mean ± SD urinary glyphosate level was 0.28 ±
0.38 μg/L, while the mean urinary AMPA level was 0.30
± 0.33 μg/L. Glyphosate was detected in 37 of the 40
urine samples tested; the highest value was 1.93 μg/L.
There was no statistically significant difference between
glyphosate or AMPA levels in those living near an urban
versus suburban area, or between self-reported diet con-
taining mostly organic versus conventional foods.
An analogous study was conducted in Quebec, Canada
on serum from 30 pregnant and 39 non-pregnant
women with similar age and BMI [22]. Glyphosate as-
sessment was conducted with mass spectrometry, with
an LOD of 15 μg/L. For pregnant women, the umbilical
cord was also available for analysis. Glyphosate was not
detected in serum of pregnant women or in the umbil-
ical cord. Non-pregnant women had a glyphosate mean
level of 73.6 ± 28.2 μg/L. AMPA was not detected in any
of the samples tested.
A study conducted in central Indiana enrolled 71 preg-
nant women aged 18 to 39 years during their prenatal
visits in 2015 and 2016 [23]. Each participant answered
an online questionnaire about their diet and demo-
graphic information and provided two urine samples
during their clinical visits between 11 and 38 weeks of
gestation. Participants also provided a water sample
from their residential source, either public supply or pri-
vate well, at the time of the second prenatal urine sam-
ple. Glyphosate levels were measured by LC-MS/MS,
with a LOD of 0.2 μg/L and 0.1 μg/L in drinking water
and urine, respectively. Glyphosate was detected in 93%
of the urine samples, with a mean (SD) of 3.40 (1.24)
μg/L. Women in rural areas had higher levels of glypho-
sate (mean: 4.19 μg/L, SD: 1.58 μg/L) compared to
women in suburban areas (mean: 3.17 μg/L, SD: 1.13 μg/
L) and urban areas (mean: 3.47, SD: 0.50 μg/L). Drinking
water samples had no detectable glyphosate, which sug-
gests that it was not a relevant source of exposure for
the cohort under study.
Researchers in Mexico conducted a cohort study com-
paring urine glyphosate levels in farm workers with eight
fishermen who lived in urban areas [17]. ELISA with a
0.05 μg/L LOD in water was used; the mean urinary gly-
phosate level in the urban fisherman, which could be
considered a control sample of subjects not exposed
through occupation, was 0.16 μg/L.
In a pilot study conducted in 2017 in Ireland, 50 adults
without a specific diet who did not use pesticides as part
of their profession provided first morning void urine
samples for glyphosate analysis [19]. Only urine samples
with creatinine levels between 3.0 and 30 nmol/L were
assumed to be valid (n = 47). Of these samples, 10 had
glyphosate concentrations above the LOD. The median
concentration of glyphosate for those 10 samples was
0.87 μg/L, with a minimum value of 0.80 μg/L and a
maximum value of 1.35 μg/L. Six of the 10 samples with
detectable glyphosate were from women, and three were
from individuals who indicated past use of glyphosate in
their homes, but not within the last month. None of the
three samples that were excluded due to creatinine levels
had detectable glyphosate.
In a study of mothers (n = 13) and children (n = 14)
conducted in 2011 and 2012 in Denmark [24], urine
spot samples revealed concentrations of glyphosate
above the LOD (2.5 μg/L) in both urban and rural
dwelling populations. Children had higher concentra-
tions of glyphosate in their urine than their mothers,
with a mean of 1.96 (range: 0.85–3.31) μg/L com-
pared to 1.28 (range: 0.49–3.22) μg/L in the mothers.
The authors did not detect a statistically significant
difference in concentrations between rural and urban
populations.
Similar results showing children having higher concen-
trations of glyphosate than their mothers were found in
a German study conducted in 2009 including 2009 vol-
unteers [25]. The mean value for all samples was
1.08 μg/L and the maximum value 4.2 μg/L. Participants
between 0 to 19 years of age had the highest mean con-
centrations of urinary glyphosate (1.55 μg/L); the mean
concentration decreased with age and was the lowest for
participants older than 70 years (0.77 μg/L).
A previous study from the same German group
tested 140 urine samples from subjects with mass
spectrometry and reported an average value in all sub-
jects of approximately 1.8 μg/L [26]. A subset of 41
subjects who self-reported eating organic food had
mean urinary values of approximately 0.5 μg/L, which
was significantly lower than those on a conventional,
non-organic diet.
Conrad et al. [27] used 24-h urine samples from 399
subjects stored in the German Environmental Specimen
Bank. Samples from 20 males and 20 females aged be-
tween 20 and 29 years were collected between March
and April in selected years between 2001 and 2011 and
every year from 2012 to 2015; 127 samples (31.8%) con-
tained glyphosate concentrations at or above the LOD
(0.1 μg/L). The maximum glyphosate levels peaked in
the years 2013 (2.80 μg/L) and 2014 (1.78 μg/L). Males
had the highest median level (0.18 μg/L) in 2013. A
sub-analysis of subjects who self-reported being vegetar-
ians showed no differences compared to the values ob-
tained from the main sample population. A more in
depth discussion of the exposure trends seen in this
study follows below.
A non-peer reviewed report on glyphosate residues in
182 urine samples from 18 different European countries,
commissioned by the European Community in 2013,
documented exposure to glyphosate and AMPA with
mass spectrometry (LOQ: 0.15 μg/L) [28]. Glyphosate

 and AMPA were detected in 44 and 36% of the urine
samples analyzed, respectively.
A study conducted in 2006 of 112 residents of several
Colombian regions where glyphosate is aerially adminis-
tered to eradicate illicit crops reported a mean urinary
concentration of glyphosate (LOD: 0.5 μg/L) of 7.6 μg/L
(SD: 18.6; range: 0 to 130 μg/L) and a mean AMPA
(LOD: 1 μg/L) concentration of 1.6 μg/L (SD: 8.4; range:
0 to 56 μg/L) [29]. Of the 42 subjects with quantifiable
levels of glyphosate, four had quantifiable levels of
AMPA as well. In these four individuals, the mean gly-
phosate level was 58.8 μg/L (range: 28–130 μg/L).
A Sri Lankan study examined urinary glyphosate levels
in 10 healthy non-farmers living in areas where CKDu
was not endemic [18]; the mean level of glyphosate was
3.3 μg/L.
A study conducted in Thailand in 2011 recruited 82
women between the ages of 19–35 years during their
seventh month of pregnancy [20]. The women were
interviewed about their diet, general health, and work
exposures, including potential agricultural exposures,
through several questionnaires at the time of recruit-
ment. Maternal blood serum and umbilical cord were
collected and tested for glyphosate (LOD: 0.4 μg/L) after
giving birth. Of the maternal serum samples, 53.7% were
at or above the LOD, while 49.3% of the umbilical cord
samples were at or above LOD; 30.5% of the maternal
samples had levels of glyphosate between 1 and 50 μg/L,
12.2% between 51 and 100 μg/L, 7.3% between 101 and
50 μg/L and 3.7% between 151 and 200 μg/L. The me-
dian glyphosate in maternal serum was 17.5 (range 0.2–
189.1) μg/L. For the umbilical cords (n = 75), 28.3% of
the samples had levels of glyphosate between 1 and
25 μg/L, 12.0% between 26 and 50 μg/L, 5.3% between
51 and 75 μg/L and 2.7% between 76 and 100 μg/L. The
median glyphosate level was 0.2 (range 0.2–94.9) μg/L.
Paired comparison between maternal blood serum and
cord blood (n = 36) indicated that maternal serum sam-
ples exhibited higher levels of glyphosate. Occupational
and lifestyle factors were found to be predictive of gly-
phosate at or above the LOD. The odds of having detect-
able levels of glyphosate in blood were 11.9 (CI: 3.6–
39.5) times higher for women who worked in the fields
compared to those who did not. After adjusting for ma-
ternal occupation, women who lived near agricultural
areas (< 0.5 km) also had higher odds of glyphosate at or
above the LOD (OR: 4.2, CI: 1.4–12.3) than those who
lived further away.
There is limited information regarding secular trends
in glyphosate exposure. In 2017, Mills et al. reported the
excretion of glyphosate and AMPA in participants from
the Rancho Bernardo Study of Healthy Aging, a study
that began in 1972 by monitoring 6629 adults greater
than 50 years of age who were residing in Southern
California [30]. A small subset of this population (n =
112) had routine morning spot urinary biospecimens
taken at all five clinic visits from 1993 to 2016; 100 of
these 112 individuals were randomly chosen for urinary
measurements of glyphosate and AMPA using chroma-
tography
and mass
spectrometry.
The LODs
were
0.03 μg/L for glyphosate and 0.04 μg/L for AMPA. Urin-
ary concentrations were normalized to each sample’s
specific gravity to account for dilution. The mean gly-
phosate concentrations were 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01–0.04)
μg/L in samples taken between 1993 and 1996, and 0.31
(95% CI: 0.24–0.39) μg/L in samples taken between 2014
and 2016. The percentage of participants with glypho-
sate above the LOD increased from 12% for the period
1993–1996 to 70% for the period 2014–2016. The mean
levels of AMPA were 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00–0. 02) μg/L be-
tween 1993 and 1996, and 0.29 (0.217–0.35) μg/L be-
tween 2014 and 2016. During the same period, the
percentage of participants with AMPA levels above the
LOD increased from 5 to 71%.
The previously mentioned study by Conrad et al. con-
ducted in Germany used 24-h urine samples from 399
subjects stored in the German Environmental Specimen
Bank and examined time trends in exposure [27]. The
LOQ for glyphosate was 0.1 μg/L. across all 14 years;
31.8% of the samples tested had glyphosate concentra-
tions and 40.1% had AMPA concentrations at or above
the LOQ. The percentage of individuals with glyphosate
levels higher than the LOQ was 10% in 2001 and
showed the highest percentages in 2012 (57.5%) and
2013 (56.4%). The maximum concentrations of glypho-
sate measured in urine peaked in 2013, with 2.80 μg/L
for men and 1.78 μg/L for women. Values plateaued in
the following 2 years.
Discussion
The current review, covering 19 studies deemed suitable
for inclusion, highlights the paucity of data and associ-
ated data gaps on internal glyphosate levels among indi-
viduals exposed occupationally, para-occupationally, or
environmentally to the herbicide. As such, it is challen-
ging to fully understand the extent of exposure among
workers or the general population. The situation is com-
pounded by the fact that these few available studies
utilize different methodologies, measurements, and ap-
proaches to reporting their results, making it difficult to
distill the evidence of exposure to glyphosate across
studies.
More specifically, we observed several crucial data
gaps in the literature we reviewed on potential occupa-
tional exposure to glyphosate: very few studies specific-
ally assessed occupational exposure before and after
using glyphosate-based products; only one study mea-
sured urine samples before and after spraying in a very

 small sample of 18 amenity horticulturalists workers,
while two studies only measured during spraying or after
spraying. Furthermore, no study was designed to tackle
the hypothesis of seasonality in exposure, including
changes associated with the time of the year that the
crop is harvested, the type of crop, and the location of
the farm in one or the other hemisphere. Additionally,
most of the studies have been conducted in the US and
Europe, using small samples of farmers and collecting a
one-time spot urine; consequently, generalizability is
limited. The limited data on occupational exposure is
particularly concerning given the magnitude and fre-
quency of glyphosate use in agriculture worldwide [1].
Additionally, to our knowledge, there is a complete lack
of data on glyphosate exposure among workers involved
in the manufacturing and processing of glyphosate and
GBHs, which is highly concerning given their potential
toxicities [5, 31].
Among the general population, the current informa-
tion available suggests that mean levels of glyphosate in
urine samples are generally below 4 μg/L [12, 21, 23, 24,
26]. However, in areas where aerial spraying is adminis-
tered, mean urinary concentrations in the population
above the LOD can reach as high as 7.6 μg/L [29]. As
with the literature on occupational exposure, studies of
environmental exposure have significant gaps: most of
the residential exposure studies have been conducted in
US and Europe. There are also limited data on geo-
graphic variability in exposure levels across the general
population. Only one study reported on urinary levels in
South America [29], despite the fact that glyphosate is
widely used and sprayed all over the continent as part of
the anti-recreational drug strategy [31]. The similarity
between average levels of glyphosate measured in the
general population and the occupationally exposed is an
unusual finding. It suggests that there are unmeasured,
inevitable high-exposure episodes occurring during daily
life activities, not addressed by any regulatory assess-
ment anywhere in the world. This gap in data and risk
assessment renders current regulatory appraisals largely
irrelevant
to
those
who
experience
these
unusual,
high-end exposures. Studies like Kongtip et al. [20] show
that even expectant mothers, a population that typically
avoids excess chemical exposure, can have serum gly-
phosate levels as high as 189 μg/L.
The few studies that report exposure among both chil-
dren and adults indicate that children exhibit higher levels
of glyphosate in biofluids than adults [13, 21, 32]. The rea-
sons for this distinction are not clear but could be due to
higher relative intake of contaminated food and water, dif-
ferences in metabolism and elimination, and/or differ-
ences in behavior and activity patterns. These findings
require further investigation, given the particular vulner-
ability of children to chemical exposures [33].
There are also some overarching methodological as-
pects that need comment. Available studies were con-
ducted
with
different
laboratory
methodologies,
primarily LC and GC mass spectrometry and ELISA.
Research presented at the Asia Pacific Association of
Medical Toxicology conference suggests that LC-MS
may be more sensitive than GC-MS or ELISA at de-
tecting glyphosate in urine samples, creating an add-
itional source of variation [34]. Additionally, LODs
and LOQs vary greatly across studies and over time.
Variation in LOQs impacts calculation of average
levels, and it also prevents the integration of data
across studies and over time and an understanding of
the impacts of how changing LOQs affect “average”
residue levels. Finally, only seven studies adjusted for
creatinine the average glyphosate level reported [11,
12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 27]. Kidney disease, reflected by
creatinine levels, may affect the excretion of pesticides
including glyphosate [18], further adding to the po-
tential for variation in the data. Despite these limita-
tions, we made an effort to standardize the data
where possible so that regional and temporal expos-
ure variations could be seen. When ranges are calcu-
lated
or
reported
it
appears
evident
that
some
subjects present very high levels of urinary glyphosate,
and that overall there is a large variability in individ-
ual levels. This may be a reflection of differences in
daily exposure, or in the metabolic ability to tackle
the chemical once it is in the body.
This review serves to highlight future research direc-
tions in this field: additional studies involving larger seg-
ments of the population, including in diverse geographic
areas, apportioning the exposure sources (e.g., occupa-
tional, household use, food and drink residues) are
needed in order to improve the knowledge of the extent
of
glyphosate
exposure.
It
is
surprising
that
the
NHANES, a federally funded program that has assessed
the health and nutritional status of adults and children
in the US since 1959, has not monitored urinary and
plasma glyphosate or AMPA levels in biofluid samples
[35], despite the fact that it reports on several other pes-
ticides, including other organophosphates. Adding gly-
phosate and AMPA to NHANES would also address
another aspect noted in this review, namely the variabil-
ity in the type of specimen utilized (urine, serum, umbil-
ical cord, maternal milk) across studies. Monitoring both
glyphosate and AMPA levels would provide a more ro-
bust picture of their relationship, as AMPA and glypho-
sate levels do not correlate well, likely due to individual
genetic differences in metabolism capacity, or to expos-
ure to other chemicals which can degrade into AMPA
[28]. Monitoring inert ingredients present in GBHs may
help to illuminate any interaction between these compo-
nents and glyphosate. National biomonitoring would

Page 11 of 14
 cover diverse segments of the population with an adequate
sample size and include common biological fluids and la-
boratory methods; thus, we strongly suggest the inclusion
of glyphosate in upcoming NHANES assessments.
The present review documents that there is limited in-
formation available about glyphosate levels in the gen-
eral population, despite the fact that glyphosate is
detected in dust, food and water. For example, Curwin
et al. detected glyphosate in the dust of both farming
and non-farming households, indicating that this expos-
ure extends beyond occupational settings [4]. The EPA
completed a glyphosate food risk assessment 10 years
ago and evaluated the levels of pesticide residues in food,
drinking water, grain based beverages, and residues en-
countered through non-occupational sources such as in
homes, recreational areas, and schools using the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey/ What
We Eat In America from 2003 to 2008 [2]. The residues
in food ranged from 100 μg/L in vegetables such as to-
matoes and pepper to 200,000 μg/L in peppermint and
peppermint oils. However, given the increasing rates of
glyphosate usage over the past decade, it is likely that
this EPA assessment does not reflect current potential
exposure sources and levels. Several European studies
have also examined the level of glyphosate found in
foods, including produce and grains for human con-
sumption as well as feed for chickens. These studies re-
port measurable levels in many food products [7, 26, 36,
37], including the muscle and organ tissues of chickens
and cows [35, 36]. An FDA review of glyphosate levels
in food in the United States found that over 60% of corn
and soybean samples analyized had detectable glypho-
sate residues, and the Environmental Working Group
sampled 28 kids’ cereal products and found detectable
levels of glyphosate in all of them and levels of glypho-
sate exceeding 160 μg/L in 26 of them [38, 39]. Glypho-
sate and AMPA have also been detected in water. In the
EPA’s Dietary Exposure Analysis in Support of Registra-
tion, which utilized monitoring data from the USGS, the
agency estimated the worst-case scenario for a chronic
dietary assessment as 75 μg/L in water [2]; similar results
have been observed in studies conducted in Europe [40].
From our review, it also appears that there is lim-
ited information on the temporal change in glypho-
sate
levels
in
the
general
population
and
in
occupational settings, even though usage of GBHs has
increased greatly in recent years [1]. The two avail-
able studies reporting repeated measurements during
the late 1990s through 2016 were conducted in only
two geographic regions on a very small sample size
(100 subjects in California, 399 subjects in Germany),
and while strongly suggestive that there may be an
upward trend in population average exposure over
time, as well as a large variability in individual levels,
are hardly generalizable to the general public because
of unknown variation across study populations, timing
of
outcome
measure
collection,
and
proximity
to
areas sprayed with GBHs.
Conclusion
In summary, additional studies are urgently needed to
evaluate levels of glyphosate and related metabolites in
the general population and in workers, including across
different geographic areas, apportioning the exposure
sources and considering changes in these measures
over time. Improved exposure assessment is necessary
for conducting accurate risk assessments and high qual-
ity epidemiological studies. This work is crucial given
the substantial increase in glyphosate use in recent
years [1] and the current questions of carcinogenicity
under debate by health and environmental agencies
around the world [5].
