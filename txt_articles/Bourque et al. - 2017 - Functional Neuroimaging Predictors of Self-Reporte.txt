Abstract
OBJECTIVE—This study aimed to investigate the neural correlates of psychotic-like experiences 
in youth on measures of inhibitory control, reward anticipation and emotion processing. A 
secondary aim was to test whether these neuro-functional correlates of risk were predictive of 
psychotic symptoms 2 years later.
METHOD—Functional imaging response to three paradigms: the Stop-Signal, Monetary 
Incentive Delay, and Faces tasks was collected in youth at age 14, as part of the IMAGEN study. 
At baseline, youth from London and Dublin sites were assessed on psychotic-like experiences and 
those reporting significant experiences were compared with matched controls. Significant brain 
activity differences between the groups were used to predict, with cross-validation, the presence of 
psychotic symptoms in the context of mood fluctuation at age 16, assessed in the full sample. 
These prediction analyses were conducted with the London-Dublin subsample (N=246) and the 
full sample (N=1196).
RESULTS—Youth reporting psychotic-like experiences showed increased hippocampus/
amygdala activity during neutral faces processing and reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activity 
during failed inhibition relative to controls. The most prominent region for classifying 16-year olds 
with mood fluctuation and psychotic symptoms relative to the control groups (those with mood 
fluctuations but no psychotic symptoms and those with no mood symptoms) included 
hyperactivation of the hippocampus/amygdala, when controlling for baseline psychotic-like 
experiences and cannabis use.
CONCLUSIONS—The results stress the importance of the limbic network’s increased response 
to neutral facial stimuli as a marker of the extended psychosis phenotype. These findings might 
help to guide early intervention strategies for at-risk youth.
INTRODUCTION
There is evidence of a continuity between clinical and subclinical phenotypes of psychosis 
that is measurable in the general population (1) and in individuals with a psychiatric 
diagnosis (2). On a clinical level, individual differences in psychosis proneness are 
expressed across a number of psychiatric conditions besides schizophrenia, namely mood, 
anxiety, eating, impulse control, and substance use disorders (2). At a subclinical level this 
liability is characterized by “attenuated” or “brief” psychotic symptoms that might not co-
exist with other diagnostic criteria (frequency and intensity) to meet full diagnosis, yet 
sufficient impairment is observed to motivate treatment seeking (3). This clinical high-risk 
state has been shown to be a robust risk factor for progression to clinically-significant

 psychiatric disorders (4), but does not necessarily predict to one specific disorder and instead 
is predictive of a number of psychopathologies that include psychotic symptoms (5).
At the far end of the extended psychosis continuum are children/adolescents from the 
community reporting psychotic-like experiences (i.e., perceptual abnormalities and 
delusional thoughts) prior to the onset of more impairing psychotic symptoms. These 
preclinical experiences, even though they are common in children/young adolescents (7 to 
23% (6)), are associated with increased risk for psychotic or Axis I disorders over the longer 
term (6, 7). Studying young adolescents prone to such experiences will help to identify 
etiologic processes implicated in psychosis proneness, without the confounds of diverse risk 
factors and iatrogenic effects, such as substance misuse, medication and social impairment 
(8). Investigating the neural correlates of this preclinical psychosis proneness on cognitive 
functioning can shed light on early altered neural processes prior to significant cognitive 
impairments.
However, the vast majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have 
focused on adults with a clinical risk to psychosis, not on young adolescents reporting 
psychotic-like experiences. These studies have mostly investigated the neural circuits 
implicated in executive functioning, social cognition and reinforcement learning. Recent 
fMRI studies in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms have shown significant 
reduced activation in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during executive 
functioning (e.g., working memory, inhibitory control) relative to low-risk controls (9, 10). 
These results are consistent with findings of dlPFC hypoactivation in patients with clinical 
diagnoses of psychosis or bipolar disorder on tasks of working memory and response 
inhibition (11, 12), suggesting that the brain markers associated with psychosis proneness 
cross diagnostic boundaries.
Social cognition which encompasses emotion processing and theory of mind processes has 
also been identified as a domain which might differentiate individuals at clinical risk for 
psychosis from low-risk individuals (13). Neuroimaging studies show that the experience of 
high arousal negative emotions is associated, in individuals at clinical risk relative to healthy 
controls, with both reduced (14) and increased activation of fronto-limbic areas (9), 
depending on the contrast used (15), while viewing neutral material is more consistently 
associated with increased activation of this network (14, 16).
Another core feature of psychosis, dysfunctional reinforcement learning, was shown to be 
shared with distinct diagnostic categories such as major depressive and bipolar disorders 
(17). A recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies has demonstrated that psychosis spectrum 
disorders are associated with a blunted response from the ventral striatum during 
anticipation of reward, which might explain why patients demonstrate impaired learning of 
stimulus-reinforcement associations (18). Functional MRI studies with clinically at-risk 
individuals have shown modest reduced activity in fronto-striatal regions during reward 
anticipation, relative to controls (19, 20).

preclinical psychosis proneness prior to the onset of more impairing psychotic symptoms,

 Modinos et al. (21, 22) found that community youth self-reporting psychotic-like 
experiences had reduced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex, insula and amygdala 
during passive viewing and reappraisal of negative pictures relative to low-risk youth. In a 
quite young sample of 11- to 13-year olds reporting these experiences, Jacobson et al. (23) 
observed reduced activity in prefrontal and temporal regions during a response inhibition 
task. However, the sample was small (11 in the at-risk group). Consequently, we intended to 
extend these findings in another community sample of young adolescents with psychotic-
like experiences. Of note, considering that psychotic-like experiences are, for most 
individuals, transient and not persistent (1), it is crucial to understand to what extent these 
early neural abnormalities relate to a subsequent psychosis vulnerability in terms of 
clinically validated symptoms.
The primary aim of the present exploratory study was to identify brain correlates of 
psychotic-like experiences in youth prior to exposure to regular substance use on fMRI 
measures of emotion processing, inhibitory control and reward anticipation using data from 
the IMAGEN study, in which two sites, London and Dublin, assessed these preclinical 
experiences to participants when they were 14. The secondary aim was to validate whether 
these brain correlates predicted emergence of psychotic symptoms in the context of mood 
fluctuation symptoms at age 16 in the full IMAGEN sample. We hypothesized that 
psychotic-like experiences would be associated with reduced activity in the executive 
network during response inhibition, altered activity in fronto-limbic regions during 
processing of emotional and non-emotional stimuli as well as modest reduced ventral 
striatum activity during anticipation of reward.
METHODS
Participants
2257 14-year old adolescents were recruited through high schools in the large European 
multicenter IMAGEN study from 8 sites across the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and 
Germany. Parents and adolescents gave written informed consent to the study procedures. 
All procedures were approved by each local institutional ethics committee. A detailed 
description of the study recruitment and assessment procedure, exclusion criteria, data 
storage and safety, as well as imaging acquisition protocol may be found elsewhere (24).
Measures
For a more detailed description of the study measures, see the online data supplement.
Psychotic-like experiences—At baseline, 14-year olds from London and Dublin 
completed the self-report Adolescent Psychotic-Like Symptoms Screener (25), which 
contains 7 items evaluating perceptual abnormalities and delusional thoughts in the past 6 
months. Participants were asked to rate their responses to different statements on a 1-point 
scale (0=not true, 0.5=somewhat true, 1=certainly true). Based on Cannon’s team (23, 25) 
previous studies, to identify youth with significant psychotic-like experiences, we used the 
following criteria: a total score ≥2 and a score ≥0.5 on the auditory hallucination (this item

 revealed 88% probability of predicting which individuals would be classified as “at-risk”, as 
determined by consensus ratings from the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes).
Among 410 adolescents [mean (SD), 14.3 (0.4) years old; 51.7% girls] from London and 
Dublin sites, 300 had complete fMRI and behavioral information. Among them, 27 were 
classified as having significant psychotic-like experiences. None had yet started using 
cannabis and they reported minimal alcohol and cigarette use (<3–5 times in the previous 
year). Using an in-house groupwise matching script designed by the IMAGEN consortium, 
the group was matched (on sex, handedness, imaging site, general IQ and puberty 
development) to a control group 5 times larger (135 adolescents) which included those with 
a total score ≤ 1 and a score of 0 on the auditory hallucination question.
Psychotic symptoms at age 16—For the secondary objective of the study, psychotic 
symptoms were evaluated with the Self-Report Development and Well-Being Assessment 
interview (www.dawba.com) (26), a computer-based package of questionnaires designed to 
generate DSM-IV-TR psychiatric diagnoses for 5- to 16-year olds. While the schizophrenia 
module was not administered to participants at age 16, the bipolar module was more 
developmentally appropriate for this age group, and therefore all participants answered 
initial screening questions assessing mood dysregulation (“rapid mood changes” and 
“abnormally high mood”), and if positive, they were then asked three specific items 
assessing the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs. Among 
the 300 individuals from London and Dublin with complete baseline assessments, 246 
(82.0%) completed the bipolar module at age 16 and were further divided into three groups: 
those who endorsed mood dysregulation plus hallucinatory/delusional symptoms (i.e., group 
with mood and psychotic symptoms, N=12), those reporting mood dysregulation without 
hallucinatory/delusional symptoms (i.e., group with mood symptoms only, N=80) and those 
who did not endorse the mood dysregulation criteria (i.e., no mood symptoms group, 
N=154).
Additionally, we conducted similar analyses on the full IMAGEN sample: among the 1602 
participants re-assessed at 16 years old, 1196 had complete fMRI and behavioral 
information and were divided into three groups: those with mood and psychotic symptoms 
(N=72), those with mood symptoms only (N=451), and those without any mood symptoms 
(N=673).
Neuroimaging tasks—We report results from three task-based fMRI paradigms: the 
Faces task to assess emotional processing, the Stop-Signal Task to evaluate motor inhibitory 
control and a modified version of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task to examine reward 
anticipation. The block design Faces task, known to elicit prefrontal and amygdala 
activations (27), uses video clips displaying a neutral expression progressively turning into 
angry or a second neutral expression. A control condition displays expanding/contracting 
circles. In the event-related adaptation of the Stop-Signal Task used to measure activation of 
the fronto-striatal network (28), a motor response to high frequency go signals (80% of 
trials) has to be inhibited when infrequently and unexpectedly (in randomised 20% of trials), 
a stop signal appears after the go signal. In the modified Monetary Incentive Delay task, 
participants had to respond to a target in order to win a previously indicated amount of

 points (3 trial types: no win, small win and large win). In the anticipation phase, which 
elicits striatal and medial prefrontal activity (29), participants were presented with cues 
signaling the amount of reward that could be won in a given trial.
Data analysis
fMRI—To test activity differences between the group reporting or not psychotic-like 
experiences on each of the contrasts of interests (Faces: angry vs neutral and neutral vs 
control; Stop-Signal: stop success vs baseline and stop failure vs baseline; Monetary 
Incentive Delay: anticipation of large reward vs no reward), we conducted two-sample t 
tests, using a whole-brain approach in SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging). 
Following Eklund et al. (30) recommendations for controlling type 1 error, significant voxels 
were required to be part of cluster of more than 24 contiguous voxels giving a 0.05% 
probability of a cluster surviving due to chance (AFNI’s 3dClustSim). For our secondary 
objective, we used a more liberal threshold: significant voxels were required to be part of 
cluster of more than 10 contiguous voxels. Then, we created regions-of-interest based on the 
regions’ coordinates and extracted the mean contrast value (betas) for each region of interest 
and for each subject.
Machine learning procedure—For our secondary objective, we aimed to classify youth 
according to 16-years old psychotic outcomes with fMRI information. We conducted cross-
validated logistic regressions with elastic-net regularization to model this relationship. 
Cross-validation is used to evaluate how well a predictive model generalizes to out-of-
sample observations. On one hand, leave-one-out cross-validations were used during 
classification of the groups within the smaller London-Dublin subsample; on the other hand, 
k(10)-fold cross-validations were used during classification of the groups within the full 
sample. Cross-validation analysis within the London-Dublin subsample allowed to test the 
predictive capacity of the brain markers while controlling for baseline psychotic-like 
experiences. Considering that the sample size of the groups was much larger in the full 
sample, we were able to control for more predictors such as developmental risk factors for 
psychotic symptoms (i.e., cannabis, alcohol and cigarette use, as well as internalizing and 
externalizing behaviors (31)), gathered at age 14.
Elastic-net regularization is used to achieve better prediction performance by penalizing the 
regression coefficients in an attempt to minimize overfit. Elastic-net regularization is an 
example of a sparse regression method, which imposes a hybrid of both L1- and L2-norm 
penalties (i.e., penalties on the absolute (L1-norm) and squared values of the regression 
coefficients (L2-norm)). Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve 
(AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), which quantifies the predicted 
sensitivity (true positive rate) as a function of false positive rate (1-specificity).

 significant differences between the groups). Furthermore, the groups were not different on 
age, as well as alcohol, cigarette and cannabis use in the previous year.
Task activation differences between the groups
Between-group differences were present in small clusters in the three tasks (Table 2). Only 
two significant clusters of activity differences survived the cluster-corrected threshold of 24 
contiguous voxels: a hyperactivation of the right anterior hippocampus/amygdala during 
passive viewing of neutral/ambiguous faces and a reduced activity in the right dlPFC during 
failure to inhibit a motor response in youth with psychotic-like experiences (Figure 1).
Prediction of psychotic-related symptoms at age 16
First, from the London-Dublin subsample, we classified N=12 youths reporting both mood- 
and psychotic-related symptoms at 16 from N=154 youths reporting no mood symptoms. 
The final models returned from this analysis had a mean AUC=.709 (95% CI=.706–.713, p<.
01) (Figure 2A). This model included all brain regions that survived the more liberal 
threshold of 10 contiguous voxels (all regions reported in Table 2), and controlled for 
psychotic-like experiences’ score at age 14 as well as demographic information (i.e., age, 
sex, handedness and site). All features were present in at least 9 folds (out of 10) of the final 
model. In addition to psychotic-like experiences, the most robust brain classifiers were 
cerebellum activity during processing of angry faces and the hippocampus/amygdala activity 
during neutral faces processing (Table 3A). The performance of each domain on its own 
(i.e., brain activity vs psychotic-like experiences) is displayed in Fig S1. We could not 
significantly classify youth with mood only symptoms (N=80) from the other two groups 
(i.e. mood and psychotic symptoms group, no mood symptoms group) (AUC=.532, 95% 
CI=.525–.539, p=.36; AUC=.453, 95% CI=.450–.456, p=.90 respectively).
In the second prediction analyses, using the full IMAGEN sample, we classified N=72 
youths reporting both mood- and psychotic-related symptoms at age 16 from N=673 youths 
reporting no mood symptoms and from N=451 youths with mood symptoms only. The final 
models returned from this analysis had a mean AUC=.633 (95% CI=.630–.636, p<.0001) 
and AUC=.615 (95% CI=.614–.617, p=.001) respectively (Figure 2B, 2C). This model 
included all brain regions that survived the more liberal threshold of 10 contiguous voxels, 
and controlled for internalizing and externalizing behaviors, cigarette, alcohol and cannabis 
use, as well as demographic information (i.e. puberty development index, handedness, age, 
sex and site). When classifying the mood and psychotic symptoms group relative to the no 
mood symptoms group, only the following features: internalizing and externalizing 
behaviors, cigarette and cannabis use, hippocampus/amygdala and cerebellum activity 
during neutral faces processing as well as cerebellum activity during angry faces processing 
were present in at least 9 folds of the final model (Table 3B). However, when classifying the 
mood and psychotic group relative to the mood only group, all features were present in at 
least 9 folds of the final model, with cerebellum activity during angry faces processing, 
fusiform activity during anticipation of reward, internalizing behaviors, cigarette and 
cannabis use, and hippocampus/amygdala activity during neutral face processing making the 
strongest contribution to group classification (Table 3C).

 Finally, we classified N=451 individuals with mood symptoms only from N=673 individuals 
reporting no mood symptoms with a mean AUC=.553 (95% CI=.552–.553, p=.002) barely 
better than chance (Figure 2D). All features, except the dlPFC activity during failed response 
inhibition, were present in at least 9 folds of the final model. The most important classifiers 
were internalizing and externalizing behaviors, cannabis use, reduced activity from the 
cerebellum during neutral faces processing, puberty development scale, and site (Table 3D).
DISCUSSION
At age 14, across the brain networks implicated in emotion processing, response inhibition 
and reward anticipation, the cluster-corrected markers of psychotic-like experiences included 
an increased response from the hippocampus/amygdala during processing of neutral material 
as well as reduced activity from the dlPFC during failed inhibition. Of note, hyperactivity 
from the hippocampus/amygdala during the processing of neutral faces further discriminated 
at 2-year follow-up individuals with mood- and psychotic-related symptoms relative to the 
other groups in both the London-Dublin subsample and the full IMAGEN sample, even 
when controlling for baseline psychotic-like experiences as well as cannabis and cigarette 
use. The cross-validation models best discriminated the mood and psychotic group from the 
no mood symptoms group in comparison to the mood only group from the no mood 
symptoms group.
One of the most replicated neural markers of psychosis and high-risk states is 
hypofunctioning of PFC and dlPFC during executive functioning (32). Our results support 
findings from other community-based studies of youth reporting psychosis-spectrum 
symptoms showing reduced PFC activity during working memory and response inhibition 
tasks (9, 23). However, the activity of the dlPFC during the Stop-Signal task was a weak 
brain classifier for adolescents reporting both mood and psychotic symptoms relative to the 
other groups. A possible explanation might be that reduced dlPFC activation is not directly 
related to positive or mood symptoms, but more to disorganized symptoms or cognitive 
deficits (which were not assessed by our screening tools) (9, 33). Consequently, dlPFC 
alterations would appear to be a promising neuro-functional marker of the clinical risk for 
psychosis when, in addition to positive and negative symptoms, significant cognitive 
impairments are observed; not of youth reporting psychotic-like experiences prior to a 
cognitive decline. It is worth mentioning that the use of a working memory task instead of 
response inhibition could have yielded more significant dlPFC results considering that 
working memory paradigms, in comparison to Stroop tasks or Go-Nogos, consistently elicit 
a more widespread loci of significant activation in the dLPFC and anterior cingulate cortex 
in both healthy controls and schizophrenia patients (11).
The current exploratory study stresses the importance of an observed increased activity in 
the limbic network in the extended psychosis phenotype. Both fMRI and perfusion studies 
have highlighted increased hippocampal activity at rest and across cognitive tasks in 
clinically at-risk individuals (32, 34). Interestingly, Schobel et al. (35) demonstrated that 
baseline hypermetabolism of the hippocampus in clinical high-risk individuals is directly 
related to a subsequent volume loss (via a hyperglutamatergic state); thereby supporting the 
heightened hippocampus activity as a highly promising early vulnerability marker to

 psychotic disorders. In the context of emotion processing, a recent meta-analysis showed 
that the apparent deficit in amygdala activity observed in individuals with a psychotic 
disorder during the viewing of negative material may be explained by an elevated amygdala 
response to neutral material (15). These findings have led some authors to propose that 
abnormalities in salience attribution might be core to the extended psychosis phenotype, 
rather than stress reactivity, per se (36). Thus, the increased neural response to neutral 
information may reflect an atypical assignment of motivational salience to these stimuli (37). 
Results from other cognitive studies showing an impaired decoding of facial expressions in 
patients with psychosis and high-risk populations further suggest that the abnormal neural 
activity in the current study might be due to an erroneous identification of neutral faces 
specifically. For instance, children and adolescents reporting psychotic-like experiences 
over-attribute significance (i.e. negative valence) to neutral faces (38). Considering that 
impaired emotion recognition is linked to declining social functioning in high-risk 
populations (39), it represents a potential target for psychosis symptoms prevention 
strategies for at-risk youth, prior to subsequent impaired social functioning.
Considering that cerebellar activity significantly contributed to the classification of youth 
with mood- and psychotic-related symptoms relative to the other groups even in the absence 
of a marked alteration in individuals reporting psychotic-like experiences, its role in emotion 
processing in the psychosis-spectrum remains elusive but deserves to be clarified in the 
future.
No cluster-corrected activity difference between 14-year olds with and without psychotic-
like experiences were observed during reward anticipation. Even when using a more liberal 
cluster threshold, significant activity related to reward anticipation did not robustly 
contribute to discriminate the groups at age 16. These findings are inconsistent with recent 
fMRI studies showing a blunted response from the ventral striatum during reward processing 
in psychosis and high-risk individuals (18, 40). A possible explanation for this negative 
result may be explained by Radua et al.’s findings of a negative correlation between striatal 
activity and the severity of negative symptoms in both patients and individuals at clinical 
risk for psychosis (18). Here, only positive experiences/symptoms were assessed.
Limitations
The use of an extended risk phenotype (i.e. youths self-reporting psychotic-like experiences) 
may constitute both a strength and weakness. While it might be too liberal to predict 
vulnerability to specific disorders, particularly those with very low prevalence, one 
advantage of this approach is that it might capture a dimension of vulnerability that is 
implicated in a number of different psychopathological outcomes. The current study also did 
not investigate interactions with family, substance misuse and genetic data, which might 
further clarify how this extended phenotype is implicated in future psychiatric outcomes. 
Another potential limitation to the study is that the use of the bipolar module, at age 16, may 
have under-estimated the emergence of psychotic symptoms in the no mood symptoms 
group. However, the prevalence of psychotic symptoms is low at the end of adolescence (e.g. 
5–7%) (1). Finally, the timeframe for studying outcomes was relatively brief and might 
predate the typical age of onset of psychotic disorders, however, this might also be

 considered a strength, as we were able to detect relevant brain-related abnormalities before 
psychotic experiences begin to cause significant functional and cognitive impairment, 
substance misuse and require medical intervention.
Conclusion
The results of the present study suggest that an aberrant neural response to non-salient 
stimuli may be an important early vulnerability marker for psychosis, at least in the context 
of mood fluctuations. These findings might help to guide early intervention strategies for at-
risk youth. It has yet to be determined whether individual differences in emotional reactivity 
to non-salient stimuli can be modified in young adolescents and whether such modifications 
have any clinical significance for high-risk youth.
