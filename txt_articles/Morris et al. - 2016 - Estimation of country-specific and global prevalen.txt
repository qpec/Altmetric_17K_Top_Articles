Abstract
Background: Male circumcision (MC) status and genital infection risk are interlinked and MC is now part of HIV
prevention programs worldwide. Current MC prevalence is not known for all countries globally. Our aim was to
provide estimates for country-specific and global MC prevalence.
Methods: MC prevalence data were obtained by searches in PubMed, Demographic and Health Surveys, AIDS
Indicator Surveys, and Behavioural Surveillance Surveys. Male age was ≥15 years in most surveys. Where no data
were available, the population proportion whose religious faith or culture requires MC was used. The total number
of circumcised males in each country and territory was calculated using figures for total males from (i) 2015 US
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) data for sex ratio and total population in all 237 countries and territories globally
and (ii) 2015 United Nations (UN) figures for males aged 15–64 years.
Results: The estimated percentage of circumcised males in each country and territory varies considerably. Based on
(i) and (ii) above, global MC prevalence was 38.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 33.4, 43.9) and 36.7 % (95 % CI:
31.4, 42.0). Approximately half of circumcisions were for religious and cultural reasons. For countries lacking data we
assumed 99.9 % of Muslims and Jews were circumcised. If actual prevalence in religious groups was lower, then MC
prevalence in those countries would be lower. On the other hand, we assumed a minimum prevalence of 0.1 %
related to MC for medical reasons. This may be too low, thereby underestimating MC prevalence in some countries.
Conclusions: The present study provides the most accurate estimate to date of MC prevalence in each country
and territory in the world. We estimate that 37–39 % of men globally are circumcised. Considering the health
benefits of MC, these data may help guide efforts aimed at the use of voluntary, safe medical MC in disease
prevention programs in various countries.

Background
The circumcision of males is one of the most common
surgical procedures in the world. It may also be one of
the oldest, likely predating recorded human history [1].
While religious and cultural considerations are a major
reason behind the practice, a growing volume of re-
search attests to the significant medical and public
health benefits of male circumcision (MC) [2–5]. Health,
medical, sexual, and cosmetic benefits may explain why
MC is a fundamentally inherent part of diverse human
cultures globally, especially in hot arid environments [1].
In light of the protection that MC affords against HIV
infection in particular [6], major health bodies such as
the
World
Health
Organization
(WHO),
the
Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) have endorsed and currently promote voluntary
medical MC (VMMC) in HIV-1 epidemic settings in
which the major route of HIV transmission is through
heterosexual intercourse [7, 8]. In sub-Saharan African
countries, 13 were prioritized by WHO and UNAIDS for
VMMC for HIV prevention in 2007, with Ethiopia’s
Gambella province, the Central African Republic, and
South Sudan added subsequently [9]. Implementation is

 well underway in the original 13 countries, with over 10
million VMMC performed since 2009 [10].
In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics pro-
duced an affirmative infant MC policy statement that
highlighted the ability of MC to protect against multiple
conditions over a lifetime. The report stated that early in
pregnancy, parents should be routinely informed of the
benefits and the low risk of MC, and that third party
payment for MC is warranted [11]. The CDC has deter-
mined that the overall adverse event rate for early infant
MC in the US is less than 0.5 %, with the rate 10–20
times higher in older boys and men than in neonates,
[12] reflecting the advantages of early infant MC over
adult MC [13]. Benefits exceed risks many fold, with half
of uncircumcised males developing at some point at
least one of the conditions against which MC offers ei-
ther partial or complete lifelong protection [4]. The US
has, arguably, the highest quality medical technology
and expertise available in the world to those who can af-
ford it. The most common procedure for children in US
hospitals is prophylactic vaccination (1,329,600) followed
by MC (1,147,700) [14], making MC the most common
procedure in boys.
A 2007 WHO Report estimated that approximately
30 % of the world’s males aged 15 years or older were
circumcised [15]. In 2011, an estimate by an independent
researcher found global MC prevalence to be 37–40 %
[16]. After examination of these previous estimates, we
considered them to be out of date, since no data were pro-
vided for many countries, neither estimate was published
in a peer-reviewed journal, and numerous new surveys
have appeared since then. We therefore considered it
timely to conduct a much more thorough evaluation
aimed at determining the latest MC prevalence figures
for every country in the world, especially in view of re-
cent policy trends supporting the scale-up of VMMC
implementation.
The aim of the present study was to determine, as
realistically as possible, (i) current country-by-country
and (ii) global prevalence of MC.
Methods
Literature searches
The method we used to determine MC prevalence in
each country is shown in Fig. 1. Prevalence of recorded
MC was extracted from published articles retrieved
through a PubMed search on 2 June 2014 (updated 1
Oct 2015) using the search terms “male circumcision”
combined with either “rate” (480 hits), “prevalence”
(1497 hits) or “incidence” (1548 hits). Articles published
prior to 2000 were excluded since MC practices can
change over time. Preference was given to the most re-
cent nationally-representative surveys, where available,
to arrive at the most valid MC prevalence estimate in a
country. Available subnational data, such as in Brazil,
are shown as well to illustrate variation in MC preva-
lence between different parts of a country. Altogether,
143 publications contained relevant MC data for inclu-
sion, of which 78 were dated from 2010 onwards.
Since MC takes place at different ages according to
varying cultural practices, the sources we included con-
tained data for mature males rather than boys, with the
exception of Canada where only data for infants are
available.

 included MCs performed for cultural reasons in child-
hood and adolescence. We obtained data on MC preva-
lence both in countries in which it is practiced for
religious, cultural, and/or health reasons and in countries
where personal preference of the male or his parents pre-
dominates. Most of the latter are developed Anglophone
countries, such as the US, Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand.
We performed Internet searches for documents pro-
duced by authoritative bodies, including Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS), AIDS Indicator Surveys
(AIS), and Behavioural Surveillance Surveys (BSS) in
specific countries. Data on MC prevalence were com-
piled in Table 1 along with pertinent information such
as whether the survey was nation-wide or involved a
particular locality, the denominator or “n” value on
which the estimate was based, and the age range of the
males surveyed. Where possible, preference was given to
nation-wide data rather than local estimates. When
more than one study provided what appeared to be a
representative MC prevalence for a particular country,
preference was given to larger, most recent surveys. If
there was more than one suitable data source, a weighted
average was used to estimate percentage of circumcised
men in the country.
Countries lacking data
For many countries, no data were available for MC
prevalence. We therefore prepared estimates of MC per-
formed for religious or cultural reasons or medical treat-
ment. MC is virtually universal in Jewish and Muslim
populations [1, 15, 17]. Data for Muslim population sizes
in various countries usually are known more precisely
than MC prevalence in those countries [18, 19]. Data for
the percentage of Jews by country were obtained from
the Jewish Virtual Library [20]. Data for the percentage
of Muslims by country were obtained from Pew Re-
search Center reports [18, 19]. For each country that
lacked survey data for the percentage of circumcised
males, the prevalence of MC was estimated from the
sum of the numbers of Jewish and Muslim males. We
assumed that 99.9 % of these, but none of non-Jewish
and non-Muslim males, were circumcised. This com-
pares with an assumption of 100 % used in the 2007
WHO estimates [15].
Circumcision of males as part of “coming of age” rit-
uals is common in a substantial proportion of countries
in eastern and southern Africa [17, 21], thus contribut-
ing to the high proportion of circumcised males found
by self-report in DHS and AIS in those countries. Simi-
larly, in many Pacific Island countries, MC is a cultural
practice that forms part of traditional “coming of age”
ceremonies of the indigenous Polynesian population
[21–24]. Since the statistics on MC in Polynesian
countries are not well-documented, estimates of MC
prevalence in these countries were based on the propor-
tion of people in each country who are indigenous, as
ascertained by Internet searches by the name of the
country and population category. In countries lacking
survey data, but with high adherence to cultural customs
concerning MC, the proportion of circumcised indigen-
ous males was assumed to approximate 95 %. Since the
total population of all Pacific Island nations represents
about 0.1 % of the world’s population [25], data for Pa-
cific Island countries made little contribution to our esti-
mate of global MC prevalence.
Since MC is performed worldwide to treat adverse med-
ical conditions such as phimosis, paraphimosis, balano-
posthitis, and penile cancer [4, 26–28], no country is likely
to have a MC prevalence of zero. We therefore set the
lowest estimate for any country at 0.1 %, which we regard
as conservative. In Denmark, for example, where non-
medical circumcision is rare, a large survey found 4.5 % of
Lutheran and non-religious men were circumcised [29].
Most of these MCs took place after infancy and, given his-
torical opposition to MC in Denmark, were probably for
treatment of an adverse medical condition caused by the
presence of the foreskin [29]. In Australia, where MC has
been common in infancy for many years, of the 11.5 % of
circumcised men in one study who had been circumcised
after infancy, the main reasons were phimosis (43 %) and
parental wishes (40 %) [30].
Estimation of global prevalence
In order to estimate the global prevalence of circumci-
sion, we started with known figures for number of males
in each country using two different authorities due to
limitations in various databanks. We used CIA data for
the total population of each country in the world [25]
and data for sex ratio [31]. The total male population for
each country was then determined using the formula
a/(a + 1) x b, where "a" is the ratio of males-to-females
in a given country [31] and "b" is the total population
of that country [25]. For six very small countries with
populations between 48 and 2210 (Christmas Island,
Niue, Norfolk Island, Pitcairn Island, Svalbard, and
Tokelauno) no data were available, so the average sex
ratio for the entire world of 1.014 males per female
[31] was used instead in our calculations. The second
source, UN data for males aged 15–64 years [32], pro-
vides the age range used by most surveys that estimate
MC prevalence. This database, however, lacks informa-
tion for 45 countries and territories, many of which are
small. Dividing the number of circumcised males by
the total number of males in a country gave figures for
the fraction of circumcised males in each country.
We then summed the number of males in each coun-
try to obtain the total number of males in the world.

 Following this, we summed the number of circumcised
males in each country to obtain a total number of
circumcised males globally. Dividing the latter by the
former yielded an estimate of the percentage of males
globally who are circumcised. Calculation of 95 % CI
used the equation σ ± 1.96 ÷ square root of n, where x is
the mean, σ is the standard deviation, n is the sample
size, and the confidence coefficient is 1.96, and Excel
was used to calculate the margin of error, as well as the
upper and lower bound.

Estimates for all countries
The estimated percentage of circumcised males for each
country or territory appears in Additional file 2, column
4. Nationally representative survey data in this file had
the benefit of involving large numbers, thus increasing
the precision of the estimates. However, self-report tends
to introduce uncertainty because manhood initiation
ceremonies in some traditional settings of sub-Saharan
Africa may or may not include complete MC [164].
Since most of the values obtained were for males aged
15 years of age and over, they reflected MCs that had
been performed in infancy or by late adolescence, de-
pending on country and culture. Purported MC esti-
mates in infancy may be unreliable because they are
based on hospital discharge data and many boys are cir-
cumcised after discharge of the mother and her baby
post-partum, whereas survey data in mature males appear
to be more accurate [4]. In the last column of Additional
file 2, “Survey” indicates that the value shown was ob-
tained from survey data. This file also shows the percent-
age of Muslims in each country (column 2) and the
percentage of Jews (column 3) [33]. In instances in which
cultural traditions in the form of “coming of age” rituals
were used as a basis for the estimate, this is indicated as
“Culture” in the last column of Additional file 2. “Culture”
was also used to indicate a country in which culture does
not traditionally support MC.
Additional file 2, column 6, shows the total number of
circumcised males in each of the 237 countries and terri-
tories, calculated from CIA databases as described in the
Methods section. For simplicity, raw values generated by
our computations are shown. These are overly precise
and should not be taken literally as they are merely
working numbers suitable for use in further calculations.
While 95 % CI would help show the degree of accuracy
of the estimates, these were not available for most coun-
tries. The 95 % CI for estimated prevalence of MC in the
USA was ±2.5 % of the mean [132]. It is likely that 95 %
CI for other countries may be wider than these.
Since CIA data does not give population figures by age
group, we used the UN database of number of males
aged 15–64 [32] to determine MC prevalence for a lim-
ited number of countries (Additional file 3).
Table 1 summarizes the percentage of MC prevalence
determined for each country and territory in the world.
Estimation of global prevalence
We then summed the total number for each country,
starting first with figures obtained using the CIA data-
base to calculate total males. This yielded an overly
precise working figure of 1,412,252,836 circumcised
males among the total number of 3,654,384,123 males in
the world, constituting a working value for the purposes
of the next calculation. Simple division of the former by
the latter figure estimated global MC prevalence at ap-
proximately 38.65 % (95 % CI: 33.7, 44.4). Prevalence
estimates were based on religion for 136 countries
(57.4 %), survey data for 73 countries (30.8 %), and cul-
ture for 20 countries (8.4 %). In only seven countries
(2.9 %) was no information available. In countries with
survey data on MC prevalence, the total number of
males was 2,694,086,787, i.e., 73.7 % of the total global
male population. The percentage of circumcised males
in these countries was 33.2 % overall. In 63 countries
(26.6 %), adult MC prevalence exceeded 90 %. MC
prevalence was greater than the global average of 36.7–
38.7 % in 95 countries (40.1 %) and lower in 142
(59.9 %) countries.
Given that 23.2 % (1.6 billion) of the total population
in the world is Muslim [18] and 0.18 % is Jewish [20],
the proportion of males circumcised for religious rea-
sons globally would be approximately 62.1 %. The rest
would have been circumcised for reasons such as indi-
vidual and family preference, which could include, for
example, Christian faith, depending on Biblical interpret-
ation by individuals, medical indications, cultural rea-
sons such as “coming of age” ceremonies, or as part of
HIV prevention programs in sub-Saharan African
countries experiencing epidemics of heterosexual HIV
transmission.
Based on UN data for number of males aged 15–64 as
the denominator in our calculation of MC prevalence
(Additional file 3), we obtained a figure of 36.7 % (95 %
CI: 31.4, 42.0).
Discussion
The true global MC prevalence is not known precisely
and can only be estimated. Nevertheless, some estimates
are more reliable than others. Global MC prevalence
was asserted to be 20 % by Wallerstein in 1985 [165],
but no sources or methodology were presented. Simi-
larly, Williams & Kapila [166] and Hutcheson [167] esti-
mated a prevalence of one in six, although neither
article provided a basis for the estimate.
The earliest attempt to obtain a somewhat systematic
estimate concluded that 23 % of males globally were cir-
cumcised [168]. That estimate, based on data through
1994, had some serious deficiencies, not least of which
was the assumption, which was acknowledged as a limi-
tation, that only Jews, Muslims, North Americans, and
"Tribal Religionists" in Africa were circumcised. There
was also poor consideration of populations falling into
multiple groups; for example, North American Muslims
appeared to have been counted twice.

 The WHO published online a better attempt to esti-
mate global prevalence in 2007 [15]. This analysis uti-
lized global numbers of Muslims and Jews as a base, and
then added MC prevalence of the non-Muslim, non-
Jewish populations of 17 countries. From the resulting
total, global prevalence was calculated as 30 %. A weak-
ness of the approach was that MC prevalence data were
likely gathered from a population sample that included
Muslims and Jews, resulting in a probable overestimate
when applied to the smaller non-Muslim, non-Jewish
population. A second weakness was the relatively small
number of countries for which non-religious MCs were
considered. The increasing proportion of Muslims in the
world population over time [19], as well as on-going
VMMC programs in sub-Saharan Africa, might account
in part for our higher estimate of 37–39 % for global MC
prevalence compared to the 30 % reported in 2007 by
the WHO based on an incomplete set of countries glo-
bally [7]. Additionally, since 2007 there has been a sub-
stantial increase in the availability of survey data, such
as those compiled by DHS, AIS, and other reputable
bodies, as well as publications in peer-reviewed jour-
nals, resulting in a stronger information base. A 34 %
increase in infant MC in Germany between 2008 and
2011 could have been from a rise in the Muslim popula-
tion in this traditionally non-circumcising country or
perhaps other factors [169]. A disproportionate rise in
Muslim immigrants as a proportion of the total popula-
tion of other countries would contribute to increases in
MC prevalence in each.
While the present study involved the most thorough
analysis yet conducted, several limitations should be
noted. All studies to date have suffered from the general
difficulty of estimating MC prevalence in the absence of
national surveys for every country. This may, however,
be improving because DHS and AIS have increased their
inclusion of questions on self-reported MC status. Sur-
vey data are based on the subpopulation of the total
population that participated in the survey. Uncertainty
could be of the order of 5–10 %. The 95 % CI for US es-
timates by the CDC were ±2.5 % of the mean, indicative
of a high degree of precision in that study [132]. Large
nationally representative surveys were more likely to
provide the most accurate estimates of MC prevalence,
whereas small surveys in sub-regions of a country have
the potential to generate MC prevalence data that devi-
ate from the actual national figure. As an example, a
more recent, larger national survey in Brazil found over-
all MC prevalence to be 1.3 % [48], noting higher figures
for cities in the south compared with rural areas in the
north of this country. This demonstrated that MC preva-
lence figures from older surveys confined to Sao Paulo
[50–52] and Rio de Janeiro [49] had yielded figures
higher than the national average.
As well as significant regional variation in MC preva-
lence in some surveys, there was a higher prevalence
noted among individuals and families with higher educa-
tion and income.
Our estimates for MC prevalence in many smaller
countries and territories tended to be less precise. Since
those countries were small, however, the estimates for
them made little contribution to our estimate of global
MC prevalence. We chose, however, not to group these
separately because we expected some readers would be
interested in seeing estimates for these individual coun-
tries or territories.
Because CIA data only allowed us to estimate the total
number of males in each country, whereas most surveys
we used gave estimates of MC prevalence for males aged
≥15 years, our estimates for the total number of circum-
cised males when using CIA data for total males applied
MC estimates to the total number of males regardless of
age. Using this approach, we assumed, however, that if
MC was performed it would have taken place in most
males by 15 years of age. We nevertheless recognize that
MC incidence may be rising or falling in some countries.
This represents an unavoidable potential limitation to
estimates based on CIA data for number of males in
each country.
We overcame this limitation by using UN estimates of
males aged 15–64 in each country. But the drawback of
the UN database was that it did not include 45 coun-
tries. Nevertheless, those countries that were included
likely led us to generate more accurate MC estimates for
those than when using CIA figures for total males.
As a consequence of the absence of MC survey data
available for many countries, it was necessary to estimate
MC prevalence in some countries on the basis of the
prevalence of ethnic/religious groups known to perform
it, most notably Muslims [18, 19] and Jews [20]. Estimat-
ing MC prevalence based on the prevalence of certain
religions in some countries is not completely accurate
because (i) uncircumcised Muslims and Jews do exist, so
the proportion of circumcised males in these groups is
less than 100 %, which is why we used a figure of 99.9 %,
and (ii) a percentage (possibly 5–10 % in developed
countries) of males are circumcised for medical reasons
such as phimosis, paraphimosis, balanitis, or conserva-
tive treatment of early stage penile cancer [28]. In this
regard, our use of a minimum of 0.1 % for MC preva-
lence in a country for which no survey data were avail-
able is likely to be an underestimate.
In relation to religion, examination of countries that
had both survey data on proportion of Muslims who
were circumcised and data on the Muslim population
proportion showed a close match: Comoros (99.4 % vs.
98.2 %, respectively), Gambia (90.0–99.0 % vs. 95.3 %),
Guinea (96.0 % vs. 84.2 %), Indonesia (92.5 % vs. 88.1 %),
Morris et al. Population Health Metrics  (2016) 14:4 
Page 7 of 13
 Mali (86.0 % vs. 92.4 %), Mauritania (77.0 % vs. 99.2 %),
Niger (92.0–99.0 % vs. 98.3 %), Sierra Leone (96.1 % vs.
71.5 %), and Somalia (93.0–94.0 % vs. 98.6 %). The one ex-
ception was Albania, where survey data suggested 47.7 %
of males were circumcised but 77.9 % of the population
was Muslim [33]. An AIDS Indicator Survey of Uganda
determined the prevalence of MC in Muslim men and
found 99.6 % were circumcised [148]. Data for other
countries show, with few exceptions, a MC prevalence of
95–100 % for Muslims. In Albania, and possibly other
countries, it is possible that a proportion of Muslims
remained uncircumcised, that MC had not taken place by
the age of 15 years, or there might have been reporting
bias. Survey data for the UK found 98.7 % of Jewish men
were circumcised [151]. From available data, it seems that
the bigger the Muslim or Jewish population in a country,
the more closely the actual MC prevalence likely matches
the percentage of Muslims or Jews. In contrast, in coun-
tries in which Muslim people are minorities, the propor-
tion of Muslim males who are circumcised was 71–85 %.
Perhaps societal or access factors in such countries may
be influencing the decision by Muslim or Jewish parents
to have their boy circumcised.
Cultural considerations are of interest, especially in the
world’s most populous country, China, where circumcision
is not generally part of the culture [170]. Prevalence in
China varies by subregion and there is a growing Muslim
population in China’s western provinces. Awareness of the
health benefits may be rising, as judged by publications and
research by Chinese investigators, as well as the develop-
ment in China of MC devices such as the Shang Ring [171].
In sub-Saharan Africa, early recognition of the strong
correlation between low MC prevalence and higher HIV
prevalence prompted epidemiological studies to deter-
mine whether the two were linked. Confirmation of the
causal link in several randomized controlled trials led to
the promotion of MC for HIV prevention, with over
10 million having already undergone the procedure
since 2009 [10]. Figure 2 uses the current data and the most
recent country-specific HIV figures [9] to demonstrate
this relationship in Africa.
Predicting MC prevalence based upon religion or cul-
ture is an approximation at best. Comparing countries for
which both predicted and reported MC rates are available
showed that reported MC prevalence generally exceeded
religion-based predictions for these particular countries
(Additional file 2). This may suggest that actual MC preva-
lence is greater than the value we estimated based on
religion or culture in some countries lacking MC survey
data. However, large surveys base MC prevalence on self-
reports and even with the use of drawings or photographs
to assist men in accurate self-reporting, some men who
are not circumcised report that they are, while some who
are circumcised report that they are not [94, 164, 172]. For

 30.8 % of countries, MC prevalence was based on survey
data rather than religion. The total number of men in
these countries (2.7 billion) comprised 73.7 % of the global
population of males. The proportion of males in surveyed
countries who were circumcised was 33.2 %. Considering
that there were 73 countries with survey data (30.8 %), but
136 (57.4 %) with data based on religion and 20 (8.4 %)
based on culture, our estimate for global MC prevalence
of 36.7–38.7 % would appear reasonable, particularly in
light of possible underestimation of circumcisions in non-
survey countries performed for medical reasons or per-
sonal preference.
Conclusions
As accurately as might reasonably be expected, the
present study has determined estimates for the preva-
lence of MC in every country in the world. Altogether,
our findings suggest that MC prevalence globally is ap-
proximately 37.7 %, although the real percentage could
be slightly higher or lower than this. Given the known
benefits and low risks of MC [4] and recent affirmative
recommendations in the interests of public health and
disease
prevention
by
the
American
Academy
of
Pediatrics, the CDC, the WHO and UNAIDS, as well as
the large-scale roll out of VMMC by multilateral donors
and agencies, the present findings on current prevalence
of MC across geographies and cultures may help guide
policy development and resource allocation in all
countries.
