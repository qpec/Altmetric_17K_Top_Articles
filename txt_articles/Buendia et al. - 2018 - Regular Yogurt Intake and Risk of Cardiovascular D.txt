High blood pressure (HBP) not only affects about 1 billion 
people worldwide but there is compelling evidence that it is a 
major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and overall mortal-
ity.1 HBP is linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) through a variety of mechanisms including 
arterial stiffness2 and direct effects on vascular endothelial 
function.3
Higher dairy consumption has been associated with 
beneficial effects on CVD-related comorbidities such as 
hypertension,4,5 type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance,6,7 and 
dyslipidemia.5 One of the earliest studies to show a benefi-
cial effect of dairy intake on risk of HBP was the Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) clinical trial, in 
which participants in the combination diet group (fruits 
and vegetables plus low-fat dairy) experienced the greatest 
BP-lowering effect compared to both the control Western 
diet and the fruits and vegetables only groups.8 Later 
studies demonstrated that the DASH dietary pattern was 
associated with a reduced risk of both fatal and nonfatal 
CVD.9,10
Yogurt intake in the United States has increased substan-
tially in the past decade.11 Early studies suggested that regu-
lar consumption of fermented dairy products such as yogurt 
was associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic vascular 
disease12 and a reduction in arterial stiffness13 in hyperten-
sive subjects. A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled

BACKGROUND
High blood pressure (HBP) is a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
factor. Clinical trials including Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 
(DASH) have demonstrated beneficial effects of dairy consumption on 
risks of HBP and CVD. Yogurt, a fermented dairy product, may indepen-
dently be related to CVD risk.
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the association between yogurt consumption and CVD risk 
among hypertensive individuals in 2 large cohorts and to determine 
whether the association differs among those whose eating pattern 
more closely resembles the DASH diet.
METHODS
Overall, 55,898 female Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and 18,232 male 
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) participants with preva-
lent HBP were included. Cumulative average estimates of yogurt intake 
from validated food frequency questionnaires were related to verified 
self-reported CVD outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models. 
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for CVD 
risk factors, medications, and diet covariates.
RESULTS
Yogurt intake was inversely associated with CVD risk (myocardial 
infarction and stroke) among hypertensive participants (P <0.01 in 
both cohorts). Among participants consuming ≥2 servings/week of 
yogurt, NHS women had a 17% (95% CI: 0.74–0.92) lower risk while 
HPFS men experienced a 21% (95% CI: 0.66–0.96) lower CVD risk com-
pared to those who consumed <1 serving/month. Regular yogurt 
consumers with higher DASH diet scores had 16% (95% CI: 0.73–0.96) 
and 30% (95% CI: 0.57–0.85) CVD risk reductions in the 2 cohorts, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION
Hypertensive men and women who consumed ≥2 servings/week of 
yogurt, especially in the context of a healthy diet, were at lower risk for 
developing CVD.

trials found that probiotic fermented milk (vs. placebo) was 
associated with a 3.98 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood 
pressure among hypertensive adults and a 2.09 mm Hg 
reduction among normotensives,14 raising the possibility of 
a greater CVD benefit of yogurt consumption among hyper-
tensives than nonhypertensives.15
While yogurt is known to be a nutrient-rich food and a 
source of probiotic bacteria, there are few large, longitudinal 
studies of yogurt’s specific health effects rather than overall 
dairy consumption. To our knowledge, there is no published 
evidence on long-term yogurt intake and CVD risk among 
individuals with prevalent HBP. Our goal was to examine the 
association between yogurt intake and risk of CVD among 
those with prevalent HBP and to determine whether this 
association differs among those whose diet more closely 
resembles a heart-healthy dietary pattern.
METHODS
For the current analyses, participants included those 
with prevalent HBP from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS, 
N = 121,700, ages 30–55 at enrollment in 1980) and the 
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS, N = 51,529, 
ages 40–75 at enrollment in 1986). The date of the first self-
reported HBP diagnosis served as the baseline for these 
analyses. Hence, the baseline visit differed depending on 
when HBP was first reported. Participants without HBP 
were excluded, as were those with missing data on dairy 
intake, missing, or implausible energy intake (<500 or 
≥3,500 kilocalories/day for NHS and <800 or ≥4,200 kilocal-
ories/day for HPFS), or prevalent cancer, diabetes, or CVD 
(including revascularization, angina, myocardial infarction 
(MI), or stroke) at or before first diagnosis of HBP, leaving 
55,898 and 17,984 NHS and HPFS participants, respect-
ively, for the current analyses. Analyses were approved by 
the Institutional Review Board of Boston University School 
of Medicine.
Dairy and yogurt intake assessment
In the NHS, participants were asked to complete a mailed 
61-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) in 1980 to report usual dietary intake in the preceding 
year. They were asked how often, on average, they consumed 
servings of each listed food item from the questionnaire 
using 9 possible response categories, ranging from “never or 
less than once a month” to “6 or more a day.” An expanded 
131-item FFQ was sent in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years 
thereafter until 2006. The same version of the FFQ was used 
from 1986 through 2006 for HPFS participants.16
The following foods were included in the estimation 
of total dairy intake in our analyses: milk (skim, low-
fat, reduced-fat, and whole), yogurt, ice cream, sher-
bet, frozen yogurt, cottage/ricotta cheese, and other 
cheese. Servings of dairy foods were defined using 
MyPyramid servings from the United States Department 
of Agriculture  (USDA).17 Cream cheese and cream were 
excluded from the dairy variable we created as they did 
not meet the MyPyramid definition of a dairy food—one 
that is made from milk and retains its calcium content.17 
Finally, a DASH diet score was calculated for each par-
ticipant.9 While yogurt is a part of the usual DASH score, 
it was excluded from calculation of the score in these 
analyses.
Assessment of HBP
A participant who reported a HBP diagnosis on the 
enrollment questionnaire in 1980 (NHS) or 1986 (HPFS) 
was considered to have prevalent HBP. Those without HBP 
at enrollment were asked on each subsequent biennial ques-
tionnaire for any new diagnoses of HBP. Participants were 
considered to have prevalent HBP at first report and through-
out the rest of the study. The validity of self-reported HBP 
has been examined in both the NHS and HPFS cohorts.18,19 
In the NHS, 77% of 51 cases of self-reported HBP in the val-
idation study had either systolic blood pressure or diastolic 
blood pressure levels >160 or 95 mm Hg via standard BP 
measurement.18 In the HPFS, a medical record review of a 
random sample of 100 participants reporting a diagnosis of 
HBP in 1988 confirmed the diagnosis in all participants.20 
Further, self-reported HBP among participants in the valid-
ation study was highly predictive of subsequent cardiovas-
cular events.19
CVD outcome ascertainment
The assessment and diagnosis of CVD in these cohorts 
has been previously described.21 For the current analyses, 
the primary outcomes include major CHD (nonfatal and 
fatal MI) and stroke (nonfatal and fatal) cases. As a second-
ary outcome, cases of revascularization are included.
On each biennial questionnaire, participants reported 
any interim physician-diagnosed events including MI, 
stroke, and revascularization. Permission was requested to 
access medical records to confirm all reported new diagno-
ses. World Health Organization criteria (diagnostic symp-
toms, electrocardiographic findings, or elevated cardiac 
enzyme concentrations) were used to confirm nonfatal MI.22 
Nonfatal stroke was confirmed using computed tomog-
raphy, magnetic resonance imaging results or the National 
Survey of Stroke criteria (i.e., medical record confirmation 
of a neurological deficit with sudden or rapid onset that per-
sisted more than 24 hours or until death).23 Fatal MI and 
stroke were validated via physician review of death or med-
ical records. CVD events in which no medical records were 
available but were deemed probable were included in these 
analyses, as was previously shown.21
Covariates assessment
A large number of potential confounding variables were 
explored including sociodemographic factors, family his-
tory, and other diet and lifestyle factors. Questionnaires 
were used to collect data on smoking status, physical activity 
(estimated as metabolic equivalent tasks [METs] per week), 
other lifestyle factors, and family history of HBP and MI.

Long-Term Yogurt Intake and Cardiovascular Disease
Body mass index was calculated as the self-reported weight 
(in kg) divided by the height squared (in meters).
Statistical analyses
Yogurt intake for each participant was estimated as the 
cumulative average intake starting at the time of the first 
HBP diagnosis and stopping at the time of first occurrence 
of one of the following censoring events: date of CVD diag-
nosis, date of death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up 
(30 June 2010 for NHS and 31 January 2010 for HPFS). 
The calculation of cumulative average intakes has been 
previous described in detail.24 This methodology is used to 
minimize exposure measurement error and is intended to 
reflect changes in yogurt intake over time. The DASH diet 
score was also computed from cumulative average of each 
score component. Due to concerns about changes in self-
reported dietary intakes following certain diagnoses, sec-
ondary analyses were conducted in which dietary intakes 
were not updated following after exams at which partici-
pants reported the occurrence of angina, revascularization, 
or elevated cholesterol.24,25 In these cases, cumulative aver-
age dietary intakes were carried forward to the exam prior 
to the occurrence of one of these events. We compared these 
results with our primary analyses in which cumulative aver-
age intake was calculated up to the stop censoring date and 
found that the hazard ratios (HRs) were virtually identical. 
Thus, our primary analyses are presented in the results of 
this manuscript.
HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated 
using Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for poten-
tial confounding factors. HRs for the risk of MI, stroke, and 
revascularization associated with average yogurt intake 
(categorized as <once/month, once/month to <once/week, 
once/week to <twice/week, and ≥twice/week) were first esti-
mated. Since MI and stroke were the primary outcomes of 
interested, we estimated HRs for this combined outcome 
as well as for total CVD (MI, stroke, or revascularization). 
Finally, risk of each CVD outcome was estimated accord-
ing to combined categories of yogurt intake and DASH diet 
scores. For these latter analyses, both yogurt intake and the 
DASH diet score were dichotomized (lower vs. higher) and

then cross-classified, yielding 4 mutually exclusive exposure 
categories: (i) low yogurt + low DASH diet score (refer-
ence group); (ii) low yogurt + high DASH diet score; (iii) 
high yogurt + low DASH diet score; (iv) high yogurt + high 
DASH diet score. The dichotomous cutpoints used were 
selected using sensitivity analyses to optimize analytic power 
and to remain consistent with FFQ and usual yogurt serving 
sizes: yogurt (<2 vs. ≥2 servings/week in the NHS; <1 vs. ≥1 
serving/week in the HPFS) and DASH diet score (<25 vs. 
≥25). Twenty-five was chosen as the cutpoint for the DASH 
diet score as it was around the median in both cohorts (24).
The following potential confounders were explored in 
the proportional hazards models: age, race, family histo-
ries of HBP, diabetes, and MI, antihypertensive medica-
tion use, hypercholesterolemia, physical activity, smoking 
status, cigarette pack years, alcohol intake, postmenopau-
sal hormone use (in NHS), aspirin and multivitamin use, 
body mass index (baseline and updated every 2 years), and 
cumulative average intakes of the following dietary factors: 
total energy intake, carbohydrates, total fat and fat subtypes 
(saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-3, 
trans fatty acids), protein (total, animal, and plant), whole 
grains, fiber (total, cereal), nuts, fruits and vegetables, 
sugar-sweetened beverages, potatoes, beans, red and pro-
cessed meats, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, 
and vitamin E. Only covariates that changed the HRs by 
>10% were retained in the final models. These included: 
age, race, physical activity, MI family history, antihyperten-
sive medication use, and intakes of total energy, total fiber, 
trans fats, and other dairy foods (milk and cheese). Fixed

Long-Term Yogurt Intake and Cardiovascular Disease
effects meta-analyses were used to pool estimates from both 
cohorts. All analyses were performed with SAS software 
(version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of NHS and HPFS partici-
pants with prevalent HBP are shown according to yogurt 
intake in Table 1. Those with the highest yogurt intakes 
(≥2 servings/week) tended to be more physically active, 
drank less alcohol, and were less likely to smoke. Higher 
yogurt intake was also associated with a healthier diet as 
indicated by a higher DASH diet score, higher fiber and 
fruit and vegetable intakes, as well as lower intakes of red 
and processed meats. Both studies had similar distribu-
tions of the DASH diet scores (mean/median around 
23/24).
In Table 2, there were 1,764 cases of incident MI (major 
CHD) and 1,749 strokes in the NHS. In the HPFS, there 
were 1,132 reported MIs and 517 strokes. Higher intakes 
of yogurt (≥2 servings/week) were associated with a 30% 
reduction (95% CI: 0.60–0.82) in risk of MI among NHS 
women (P trend <0.001) and a 19% reduction (95% CI: 
0.65–1.02) in HPFS men (P trend = 0.06). Estimates for 
stroke risk were weaker than those for MI among women. 
When revascularization procedures (CABG) was examined 
separately (Supplementary Table 1), there were 3,300 and 
2,148 cases in NHS and HPFS, respectively. Higher yog-
urt intake in women was associated with a 16% lower risk 
of undergoing revascularization (P trend <0.01) while there 
was no significant association observed among HPFS men 
(Supplementary Table 1). In separate analyses (not shown) 
restricted to cases of ischemic stroke only, results were simi-
lar to those of total stroke presented in Table 2 but the power 
of these analyses was very low given the small numbers of 
ischemic strokes in HPFS.
We examined our primary outcome (incident major 
CHD or stroke) first (Table 3) before investigating the sec-
ondary outcome including revascularization procedures 
(Supplementary Table 1). In both cohorts, participants con-
suming 1–<2 cups or ≥2 servings/week of yogurt had an 
approximately 20% lower risks of major CHD or stroke dur-
ing the follow-up period (P for trend <0.01 in both cohorts). 
When revascularization was added to the total CVD out-
come variable, the risk estimates were attenuated for both 
men and women, but remained significant for both cohorts

outcome, the greatest risk reduction occurred among those 
jointly exposed to higher yogurt consumption and higher 
DASH diet score. Among HPFS participants, those with higher 
yogurt intakes and a higher DASH score had 27% (95% CI: 
0.58–0.93) and 37% (95% CI: 0.44, 0.91) lower risks of major 
CHD and stroke, respectively. For the combined CVD outcome 
with major CHD and stroke, the lowest risk was again found 
among those with higher yogurt intakes and a higher DASH 
diet score. These HRs were attenuated when revascularization 
was added to the CVD outcome (Supplemental Table 2).

Long-Term Yogurt Intake and Cardiovascular Disease
DISCUSSION
Higher yogurt consumption among hypertensive women 
and men in the NHS and HPFS cohorts was associated with 
a lower risk of MI and stroke and, among women, with a 
lower likelihood of undergoing a revascularization proced-
ure. The strongest and most consistent results were asso-
ciated with the lower risk of MI in both men and women. 
Further, the associations between yogurt consumption and 
CVD risk were stronger among participants with higher 
DASH diet scores.
The independent effect of the original DASH diet interven-
tion8 was also observed in other trials including the Exercise 
and Nutrition interventions for CardiOvasculaR hEalth 
(ENCORE) study of overweight, middle-aged hypertensive 
men and women.26 That study found that compared to those 
consuming a typical American diet, those randomized to the 
DASH diet intervention had lower BP, brachial artery flow-
mediated dilation, baroreflex sensitivity, and left ventricular 
mass after a 4-month intervention period.26
A number of studies including the numerous DASH tri-
als have found dairy intake to be associated with reduced 
risks of both HBP and CVD.8–10,26 Several prospective stud-
ies among those without HBP have found an inverse associ-
ation between yogurt intake and markers of CVD.27,28 In a 
5-year prospective study, Australian women over the age of 
70 who consumed >100 g/day of yogurt had significantly less 
common carotid artery intima–media thickness than those 
who consumed less yogurt.27 A case–control study of Italian 
adults found a 45% lower odds of acute MI among those who 
consumed ≥7 cups of yogurt per week compared to nonyo-
gurt consumers.28
In early clinical trials, the BP-lowering effect of dairy 
was largely attributed to its calcium content. However, 
it has been shown by others that factors in dairy other 
than or in addition to dietary calcium may explain the 
beneficial effects on BP and CVD risk.29 Several small 
randomized controlled feeding trials have examined the 
effects of fermented milk products on CVD risk factors 
among hypertensive individuals.13,30,31 For example, a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with 
89 hypertensive subjects tested the impact of adding the 
milk tripeptides, isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP), and 
valine-proline-proline (VPP) to Lactobacillus helveticus-
fermented milk. The investigators added 1.2 mg of IPP 
and 1.3 mg of VPP per 100 g of milk for 12 weeks and then 
increased the dose to 5.8 mg IPP and 6.6 mg VPP per 100 g 
for an additional 12 weeks. This protocol led to reductions 
in arterial stiffness in the intervention group compared 
with control subjects who were given Lactobacillus helve-
ticus-fermented milk without IPP or VPP supplementa-
tion.30 Hirota et al. found that these same fermented milk 
tripeptides improved vascular endothelial function inde-
pendent of their BP-lowering effects in a randomized trial 
of hypertensive men.31
Taken together, these studies suggest that fermented dairy 
products may lower CVD risk through effects on vascular 
stiffness as well as through direct effects on BP. Consequently, 
yogurt consumption may be associated with lower CVD risk 
by improving BP control among hypertensive individuals. 
These tripeptides may play a role in platelet aggregation and 
clot formation via their inhibition of angiotensin-convert-
ing enzyme in the renin–angiotensin system,32 one of the 
major BP regulators in the body. Angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibition leads to lower concentrations of angio-
tensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor32 that has also been shown 
to increase intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle 
cells and pH in platelets, leading to increased platelet aggre-
gation.33 Platelets from hypertensive patients produce more 
reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing the bioavailabil-
ity of nitric oxide,34 an important vasodilator and inhibitor 
of platelet aggregation.35,36 In spontaneously hypertensive 
rats, fermented dairy-derived peptides have been shown to 
improve vascular response in vitro possibly by the stimula-
tion of nitric oxide release.37
This is the first large prospective study to show a reduced 
risk of MI and stroke associated with regular yogurt con-
sumption among hypertensive adults. This study has several 
important strengths including its prospective design and the 
use of updated repeated assessments of diet for estimating 
long-term intakes and repeated measures of potential con-
founding variables. This study also had several limitations. 
Since yogurt is highly correlated with an overall healthy diet 
and lifestyle, it is possible that some potential confounders 
associated with a healthy lifestyle were not measured or were 
imperfectly measured, leading to uncontrolled or residual 
confounding. Additionally, yogurt is a complex dairy prod-
uct and we were not able to study specific types of yogurt such 
as those with different added probiotics. While few studies 
examined food sources of probiotics, some have shown that 
different probiotic combinations have unique effects on BP 
and CVD risk factors.14 Future studies are needed to assess 
different types of yogurt. Finally, the small number of stroke 
cases in HPFS yielded inadequate statistical power to exam-
ine different types of stroke.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that higher long-term yogurt intake 
is associated with lower CVD risk among hypertensive men 
and women. Higher yogurt intake in combination with 
an overall heart-healthy diet as measured by the DASH 
diet score was associated with greater reductions in CVD 
risk among hypertensive men and women. These findings 
endorse that incorporation of yogurt into a healthy diet pat-
tern for individuals with hypertension to aid in the preven-
tion of incident CVD.
