ABSTRACT
Objectives: US and UK suicide prevention strategies
suggest that bereavement by the suicide of a relative
or friend is a risk factor for suicide. However,
evidence is lacking that the risk exceeds that of any
sudden bereavement, is specific to suicide, or
applies to peer suicide. We conducted the first
controlled UK-wide study to test the hypothesis that
young adults bereaved by suicide have an increased
risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt
compared with young adults bereaved by other
sudden deaths.
Design: National cross-sectional study.
Setting: Staff and students at 37 UK higher
educational institutions in 2010.
Participants: 3432 eligible respondents aged 18–
40 exposed to sudden bereavement of a friend or
relative after the age of 10.
Exposures: Bereavement by suicide (n=614), by
sudden unnatural causes (n=712) and by sudden
natural causes (n=2106).
Primary outcome measures: Incident suicidal
ideation and suicide attempt.
Findings: Adults bereaved by suicide had a higher
probability of attempting suicide (adjusted OR (AOR)
=1.65; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.42; p=0.012) than those
bereaved by sudden natural causes. There was no
such increased risk in adults bereaved by sudden
unnatural causes. There were no group differences in
probability of suicidal ideation. The effect of suicide
bereavement was similar whether bereaved
participants were blood-related to the deceased or
not. The significant association between
bereavement by suicide and suicide attempt became
non-significant when adding perceived stigma
(AOR=1.11; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.67; p=0.610). When
compared with adults bereaved by sudden unnatural
causes, those bereaved by suicide did not show
significant differences in suicide attempt (AOR=1.48;
95% CI 0.94 to 2.33; p=0.089).
Conclusions: Bereavement by suicide is a specific
risk factor for suicide attempt among young
bereaved adults, whether related to the deceased or
not. Suicide risk assessment of young adults should
involve screening for a history of suicide in blood
relatives, non-blood relatives and friends.
INTRODUCTION
Suicide bereavement describes the period of
grief,
mourning
and
adjustment
after
a
suicide death, that is experienced by family
members, friends and any other contacts of
the deceased affected by the loss.1 It is esti-
mated to affect up to 9% of adolescents2 and
7% of adults3 annually. Since 1989, the
WHO has suggested that relatives and close
friends of people who die by suicide are a
high-risk group for suicide.4 Explanations
include the particular psychological trauma
of a suicide loss, which involves grief and
agonising
self-questioning;
shared
familial
and environmental risk; suicide contagion
through the process of social modelling1;
and the burden of stigma associated with
violent losses.1 5 Quantitative studies confirm
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ We conducted a large population-based national
survey of young adults, using a precise sampling
frame.
▪ We included exposures to the sudden death of
any close contact, to describe the impact of
suicide
bereavement
whether
related
to
the
deceased or not.
▪ Our primary outcomes were validated measures
of self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide
attempt
occurring
after
the
bereavement,
adjusted for prebereavement suicidal behaviour
and psychopathology.
▪ We
compared
bereavement
by suicide with
bereavement due to sudden natural causes, then
separately compared those bereaved by suicide
with those bereaved due to sudden unnatural
death to measure the specific impact of suicide
bereavement.
▪ Given the possibility of selection bias (favouring
higher social classes) and male non-response
bias, the results of this study may be more gen-
eralisable to young bereaved women than men,
and to the more highly educated.

 that people bereaved by suicide and other violent deaths
perceive greater stigma than other bereaved groups.1
Their qualitative accounts are of others’ distaste or
embarrassment over the disturbing nature of an unnat-
ural loss,5 and a loss of community support,6 7 with the
effect of reducing help seeking and perceptions of the
support available.7 As stigma may be more modifiable
than other potential explanatory factors, there is interest
in understanding its relationship to suicide-related out-
comes after negative life events.1
International suicide prevention strategies have placed
great emphasis on the provision of support for people
bereaved by suicide,1 despite the lack of studies confirm-
ing that risk of adverse outcomes applies beyond the
effect of any sudden loss.1 8 There is also little evidence
for effective interventions after suicide.9 Studies compar-
ing people bereaved by suicide with non-bereaved con-
trols
support
an
increased
probability
of
suicide
following
any
bereavement.10
Those
using
controls
bereaved by non-suicide causes go further in supporting
an
association
between
sudden
bereavement
and
suicide-related outcomes.10 11 However, risk of hospital-
treated suicide attempt is similar in adults bereaved by
suicide and those bereaved by accidental deaths,12 sug-
gesting that the wider risk factor is bereavement by any
unnatural causes. Only study designs separating out
control groups bereaved by sudden natural and sudden
unnatural causes, adjusted for prebereavement psycho-
pathology, can determine whether adverse outcomes are
attributable to violent deaths or more specifically to
suicide.1 Our recent systematic review highlighted the
lack of such studies.1 It also found that no British studies
had investigated suicide-related outcomes after suicide
bereavement,13 and no studies using bereaved controls
had measured the impact of peer suicide.1 This is
despite widespread concern about the susceptibility of
young people to social modelling of self-harm14 15 and
recent increases in suicides among young men.16
Our objective was to design a study that could investi-
gate whether there is a specific association between
suicide bereavement and suicide attempt by making dis-
tinct comparisons between bereavement by suicide,
unnatural causes and sudden natural causes. Use of
routine clinical data was precluded because these record
exposure only to mortality of first-degree relatives and
cohabitees, and hospital presentations of self-harm.
Conversely, survey methods permit ascertainment of
exposure to all bereavements, and self-reported suicidal-
ity and self-harm, and are therefore a vital tool for inves-
tigating
risk
of
suicidal
events
following
suicide
bereavement. We therefore undertook a population-
based cross-sectional survey comparing the impact of
specific modes of self-reported sudden bereavement on
non-fatal suicide-related outcomes.
Our primary hypothesis was that young adults in the
UK who had been bereaved by suicide were at higher
risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts than those
bereaved by other causes of sudden death. Collecting
data on two control groups allowed us to address two
research
questions.
First,
comparison
with
adults
bereaved by sudden natural causes of death took into
account the sudden nature of the loss. Second, compari-
son with adults bereaved by sudden unnatural causes
took into
account
the
violent
nature of
the
loss.
Hypothesis 2 was that suicide bereavement would be a
risk factor for four secondary clinical and occupational
measures
(postbereavement
non-suicidal
self-harm,
depression, occupational drop-out and social dysfunc-
tion), reflecting policy concerns about the contribution
of bereavement to workplace mental ill health and sick-
ness absence.17 Hypothesis 3 was that the impact of
suicide
bereavement
would
extend
beyond
genetic
relatedness to peer suicides, and would therefore not be
modified by relatedness to the deceased. Hypothesis 4
was that any associations with clinical or occupational
outcomes would be attenuated by perceived stigma, as a
marker for reduced help seeking.
METHODS
Study design and participants
We invited all young adults working or studying at UK
higher education institutions (HEIs) to participate in a
closed, online study about sudden bereavement: the
UCL Bereavement Study. We anticipated that using the
email systems of large institutions would be the best
means of accessing hard-to-reach groups, particularly
those not normally accessing health services, and avoid-
ing the biases associated with recruiting a help-seeking
sample.18 Sampling from a diverse range of colleges,
universities, art and drama schools, and agricultural col-
leges offered unique access to a large defined sample of
young adults.
All 164 HEIs in the UK in 2010 were invited to partici-
pate, following up non-responding HEIs to encourage
broad socioeconomic and geographic representation.
Over 20% of HEIs (37/164) agreed to take part, with a
higher response (40%) from those classified as the more
prestigious Russell Group of universities. This provided a
sampling frame of 659 572 staff and students. All partici-
pants were invited to take part in a survey of ‘the impact
of sudden bereavement on young adults’, with the aim
of masking them to the specific study hypotheses. There
was no accurate way of measuring response, as the
denominator of bereaved people was not ascertainable
using routine data or survey methods. The majority of
participating HEIs agreed to send an individual email
invitation with embedded survey link to each staff and
student member. For reasons of sensitivity (recent staff/
student deaths), 10 HEIs modified this strategy, for
example, by emailing students only, using their weekly
news digest email, or advertising via staff and student
intranet.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: people aged 18–40
who, since the age of 10, had experienced sudden
bereavement of a close friend or relative. The 18–40 age

 range was defined to reflect an under-researched group
of great policy interest.16 Early childhood bereavements
were excluded to minimise recall bias and restrict our
focus to adult cognitive processing of life events, using
the age threshold for criminal responsibility in England
and Wales. A close contact was defined as ‘a relative or
friend who mattered to you, and from whom you were
able to obtain support, either emotional or practical’.
Sudden bereavement was operationalised as ‘a death
that could not have been predicted at that time and
which occurred suddenly or within a matter of days’.
Exposure status was classified by responses to the ques-
tion: ‘Since you were aged 10 have you experienced a
sudden bereavement of someone close to you due to
any of the following: (1) sudden natural death (eg,
cardiac arrest, epileptic seizure, stroke); (2) sudden
unnatural death (eg, road crash, murder or manslaugh-
ter, work accident); (3) suicide?’ Mode of death was
defined subjectively by the respondent, and not by cor-
oner’s verdict or death certificate, as perception of
bereavement type was the exposure of interest.
In the case of more than one exposure, we adopted a
hierarchical
approach
favouring
those
bereaved
by
suicide, for whom we anticipated the lowest base rate.
This group were classified as suicide bereaved regardless
of other exposures. Those bereaved by more than one
non-suicide sudden death were asked to relate their
responses to whichever person they had felt closest to,
with exposure status classified accordingly.
We estimated that a minimum of 466 participants
would be required in any one group (two-tailed analysis;
90% power) to detect a doubling of the UK community
prevalence of lifetime suicide attempt (6.5%) in young
adult samples.19 We chose a relatively large effect size to
reflect our comparison to a non-bereaved baseline,
lacking prevalence figures for bereaved UK samples.
Procedures
The questionnaire (see online supplementary material)
was designed in consultation with a group of young
bereaved adults and bereavement counsellors, who iden-
tified important domains to cover in relation to the
impact of bereavement, and was piloted with individuals
accessing support from national bereavement support
organisations. It elicited quantitative data on sociodemo-
graphic and clinical characteristics, including a personal-
ity disorder screen,20 and nine putative confounding
variables identified a priori from existing literature and
clinical judgement: age, gender, socioeconomic status,
other family history of suicide (excluding index bereave-
ment),
years
since
bereavement,
kinship
to
the
deceased, prebereavement depression, prebereavement
suicide attempt and prebereavement non-suicidal self-
harm. These reflected the observed vulnerabilities of
people bereaved by suicide, even before the loss,1 which
are likely to reflect shared familial and environmental
risk. We measured perceived stigma using the stigmatisa-
tion subscale of the Grief Experience Questionnaire
(GEQ),6 with items such as ‘Since the death how often
did you feel avoided by friends?’ Responses on a
Likert-style scale generated scores of 5–25.
Our two main outcomes were self-reported suicidal
ideation (‘Have you ever thought of taking your life,
even though you would not actually do it?’)21 and self-
reported suicide attempt (‘Have you ever made an
attempt to take your life, by taking an overdose of tablets
or in some other way?’).22 These standardised measures
were taken from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey
(APMS),19 a national seven-yearly population survey in
England, and were qualified by whether these occurred
before or after the sudden bereavement, to derive an
incident measure.
Our four secondary measures were: postbereavement
non-suicidal
self-harm (self-poisoning
and self-injury
without suicidal intent) using a standardised APMS
measure22 (adapted as above); depression using the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
screen for lifetime depression23 (adapted as above);
occupational drop-out (from work or education) using a
binary measure developed for this study; and poor social
functioning using the Social Functioning Questionnaire
(SFQ).24
Statistical analysis
We
summarised
sample
characteristics
by
exposure
group, using χ2 tests (categorical variables) and one-way
analysis of variance (continuous variables). We then
used multivariable regression to estimate the strength of
associations between suicide bereavement and outcomes.
We fitted binary models using xtlogit commands in
Stata,25 with HEI as random effect, to take into account
the clustering effect at HEI level. Each multivariable
model included nine prespecified confounding vari-
ables, described above. Models used complete case ana-
lysis, with a significance threshold of p=0.05 for primary
outcomes and p=0.01 for secondary outcomes. Our
primary
comparison
used
bereavement
by
sudden
natural causes as the reference category, quantifying risk
of adverse outcomes in adults bereaved by suicide, and
in adults bereaved by sudden unnatural causes. We con-
ducted a second comparison between adults bereaved
by suicide and the reference category of adults bereaved
by sudden unnatural causes.
We tested hypothesis 3, whether the effect of suicide
bereavement was modified by kinship (blood-related vs
non-blood-related), by adding an interaction term to all
models. Hypothesis 4, whether stigma attenuated asso-
ciations, was tested by including stigma scores in multi-
variable models.
A series of a priori defined sensitivity analyses were
conducted. These assessed the robustness of our main
findings when using best-case and worst-case scenarios
to impute missing values, and when applying more
stringent inclusion criteria (excluding participants
from the 10 HEIs that had modified the stipulated

 recruitment method; excluding participants from the
18 HEIs with participant numbers below the median
cluster size).
Finally, we conducted a set of four post hoc analyses to
describe probability estimates in those bereaved by the
death of an older person; in a student-only sample; and
in women (as the study was underpowered to add
gender as an interaction term to models); and to ascer-
tain whether exposure to more than one mode of
sudden bereavement might attenuate associations (by
adding this variable to final models).

analyses
were
conducted

(StataCorp, Texas, USA).
RESULTS
A
total
of
5085
people
of
the
659 572
sampled
responded to the questionnaire by clicking on the
survey link, with 91% consenting to participate, and
68% (n=3432) fulfilling eligibility (see figure 1). Overall
18% had been exposed to more than one mode of
sudden bereavement (see figure 2), which was signifi-
cantly more common in the group bereaved by suicide
(see table 1). Clustering of participants within the 37
HEIs was minimal for primary outcomes (see table 1).
Missing data for model covariates and outcomes were
less than 7%.
Participant characteristics
The sample was primarily female, white and blood-
related to the deceased (see table 1). Of those reporting
the loss of a non-blood-related contact, 74% described
them as a friend, 11% a partner, 4% an ex-partner and
12% a step/adoptive/in-law family member. There were
no statistically significant differences between the expos-
ure groups in relation to mean age, gender, self-defined
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, level of current social
support or personality difficulties. People bereaved by
suicide were significantly more likely to report preberea-
vement psychopathology, and a family history of psychi-
atric problems. Those bereaved by sudden unnatural
causes or by suicide reported a lower mean age of the
deceased than those bereaved by sudden natural causes,
and were also less likely to report the loss of a blood
relative. The mean time elapsed since bereavement was
4.9 years (SD=5.3; range=1 day to 30 years), with no evi-
dence for group differences. In each exposure group,
the prevalence of prebereavement suicidal thoughts and
non-suicidal
self-harm
(but
not
suicide
attempt)
exceeded estimates for UK population norms in corre-
sponding age groups.19
Bereavement by suicide compared with that by sudden
natural causes
In comparison with bereavement by sudden natural
causes (see table 2), those bereaved by suicide had a
greater probability of postbereavement suicide attempt
(adjusted

sion or social functioning.

 bereaved by sudden natural causes showed no evidence
for any group differences.
Bereavement by suicide compared with that by sudden
unnatural causes
When directly compared with bereavement by sudden
unnatural death, adults bereaved by suicide had a similar
probability
of
postbereavement
suicidal
ideation
and
suicide attempt (see table 3). The probability of poor social
functioning was significantly greater in adults bereaved by
suicide (AOR=1.46; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89; p=0.005), but
there were no differences in postbereavement non-suicidal
self-harm, depression or occupational drop-out.
Kinship as a potential effect modifier
Tests for an interaction between bereavement exposure
and kinship to the deceased found that none of the sig-
nificant or non-significant associations between suicide
bereavement and adverse outcomes were modified by
relatedness. This was the case even when excluding the
253 respondents who reported the death of a partner,
ex-partner or non-blood relative, to describe associations
in a group bereaved by peer death.
Stigma as a potential confounder

suggesting that any biases introduced had not resulted
in an underestimation or overestimation of the risks.
Post hoc sensitivity analyses
The magnitude and direction of the association between
suicide bereavement and suicide attempt (compared
with bereavement by sudden natural causes) were similar
after excluding 769 participants bereaved by the death
of someone aged over 60 (AOR=1.78; 95% CI 1.16 to
2.71; p=0.008), to exclude deaths that might be less
unexpected. They were also unchanged when excluding
399 staff (AOR=1.73; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.59; p=0.007), and
in a women-only sample (AOR=1.66; 95% CI 1.09 to
2.53; p=0.018). When compared with women bereaved
by sudden unnatural causes, women bereaved by suicide
had an increased probability of postbereavement suicide
attempt (AOR=1.71; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.85; p=0.036),
whereas in the full sample no association was found.
When taking into account the higher prevalence of
repeated exposure to sudden bereavement in the
suicide bereaved group, ORs were attenuated and no
significant findings remained. There was therefore no
evidence of group differences between the suicide
bereaved group and those bereaved by sudden natural
causes in relation to postbereavement suicide attempt
(AOR=1.53; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.35; p=0.054) or occupa-
tional drop-out (AOR=1.54; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.43;
p=0.062), or between those bereaved by suicide and
those bereaved by sudden unnatural causes in relation
to poor social functioning (AOR=1.41; 95% CI 1.07 to
1.84; p=0.013).
DISCUSSION
Our main finding was of a specific association between
bereavement
by
suicide
and
subsequent
suicide
attempt among young adults who experience sudden
bereavement. This was not attributable to prebereave-
ment suicidality, despite higher rates of prebereave-
ment psychopathology; a finding in keeping with the
literature1 and suggestive of shared familial and envir-
onmental risk. Previous studies using non-bereaved
controls or heterogeneous bereaved controls were not
able to rule out the possibility that exposure to any
sudden bereavement explains adverse outcomes. Our
study supports a specific association between suicide
bereavement and suicide-related outcomes, justifying
the inclusion of people bereaved by suicide in national
suicide prevention strategies. This study also provides
the
first
evidence
that
blood
relatedness
to
the
deceased does not modify the association between
suicide bereavement and suicide attempt, confirming
that risk also applies to adults bereaved by peer suicide.
Such findings must be interpreted in the context of a
highly educated sample, in which exposure to violent
losses may be lower than in a more nationally represen-
tative (but harder to recruit) sample.

 The
absence
of
an
association
between
suicide
bereavement and suicidal ideation or depression is strik-
ing, as is the high prevalence of prebereavement and
postbereavement suicidal ideation and depression in all
three exposure groups. This may be explained by high
baseline rates of depressive and suicidal thoughts among
students,26 reducing the chances of detecting a differ-
ence. It is also possible that while suicidal thinking after
sudden loss is common, suicide bereavement is particu-
larly powerful in precipitating suicide attempt in a sui-
cidal person, whether due to enhanced awareness of
means, reduced fear of death or social modelling.27 The
non-significant differences in the probability of suicidal-
ity and depression when comparing adults bereaved by
suicide and by sudden unnatural causes are noteworthy,
requiring further studies comparing outcomes in those
bereaved by suicide and other unnatural causes.
The clinical implications of these findings are that clini-
cians assessing suicide risk should inquire not only about
a history of suicide in blood relatives, but also in friends
and non-blood relatives. Employers should be aware of
the impact of suicide bereavement on occupational func-
tioning, and make adjustments to promote workplace
mental health. The associations between suicide bereave-
ment and adverse outcomes became non-significant when
adding perceived stigma. This is an indicator that stigma
might be a marker for motivational moderators of suicid-
ality after a negative life event, such as reluctance to seek
help, thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensome-
ness.27 However, further investigation is warranted to
determine whether stigma can be said to lie on the causal
pathway. This study suggests a role for psychosocial inter-
ventions delivered after a potentially traumatic loss to
address problem solving and help seeking, and the quality
of community support. Although not prehypothesised,
the associations were also attenuated by repeated expos-
ure to sudden losses among the suicide bereaved. This is
suggestive of a substantial contribution of familial and
environmental risk factors for premature death shared
with social networks, and a reduced fear of death due to
habituation. This acquired capability to attempt suicide27
would require sensitive exploration in a clinical interview.
Our study is of policy importance in specifying that
friends as well as relatives warrant support after a suicide,
addressing the vagueness of suicide prevention strategies
on how extensively to offer support.1 The WHO estimates
that 800 000 people die by suicide annually,28 and 60
people are now understood to affected by each suicide
death.29 This means that 48 million people are bereaved
by suicide worldwide every year. Further research describ-
ing moderators of risk will help determine whether there
is a rationale for screening members of this heteroge-
neous group. Trials are also needed to identify evidence-
based interventions delivered after suicide bereavement
to reduce the risk of suicide-related outcomes, including
those that address stigma.
This study’s key strengths are its national population-
based sample size, and ability to access those who do not
normally participate in research. It is the largest scale
survey conducted in any country comparing self-reported
suicide-related outcomes in those bereaved by suicide and
other mortality causes. Previous studies using national
registries have achieved larger sample sizes, but under-
recorded exposures and lacked self-reported outcomes
such as untreated suicide attempts.10–12 30 30 31 Unlike
previous surveys, we tested clear a priori hypotheses,
accounted
for
prebereavement
psychopathology,
and
used standardised measures for seven of eight outcomes.
A precise sampling frame accessed a large community
sample of young adults, otherwise under-represented in
health research, while minimising the biases inherent to
using help-seeking groups. Coroner misclassification of
suicides as accidental deaths was less of a problem than
in other studies as we used the respondent’s perception
of cause of death, with minimal potential for respondent
misclassification. Levels of missing data within models
were low, and results were robust to sensitivity analysis
simulating non-response and possible selection biases.
Chance findings were unlikely as group sizes exceeded
the minimum required for adequate power and the sig-
nificance threshold was more stringent for secondary out-
comes than primary.
Lack of information on response might be a consid-
ered a limitation, but no method permitted accurate
estimation of the bereaved denominator. It is reasonable
to assume that most non-responders had not been
exposed to sudden bereavement, and that a minority
were ineligible by age. Our hierarchical approach to clas-
sifying suicide exposure may have overestimated the
effect of suicide bereavement due to clustering of
violent bereavements, but we did not measure number
of exposures to each type of bereavement. Our defin-
ition of non-suicidal self-harm followed that used for
establishing UK population norms,19 but may differ
from others given wide international definitional varia-
tions. Recall bias may have influenced judgements about
the onset and severity of difficulties, particularly among
those bereaved by violent causes, with the potential to
overestimate risks in these groups. Residual confounding
is possible in relation to unmeasured variables such as
financial hardship, social modelling, substance misuse
and complicated grief (which was not measured as data
collection preceded Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental
Disorders,
5th
Edition
(DSM-5)32).
Non-response bias (from men, those most distressed),
survivor bias and selection bias (favouring higher social
classes) may have resulted in an underestimation of risks
due to the higher probability of suicide-related out-
comes in disadvantaged men16 and those worst affected
by the loss. An HEI sample is not representative of all
UK-based young adults, despite inclusion of diverse insti-
tutions, and this limits generalisability of findings to
those not entering higher education. While selection
bias and male non-response bias were equally distributed
between the three exposure groups, the results of this
study may be more generalisable to young bereaved

Nevertheless, the findings do constitute the best avail-
able evidence describing the impact of peer suicide on
young adults using appropriate controls.
CONCLUSIONS
Bereavement by suicide is a specific risk factor for
suicide attempt when compared with bereavement due
to sudden natural causes, whether blood-related to the
deceased or not. As the association between suicide
bereavement and suicide attempt is attenuated when
taking into account perceived stigma, further investiga-
tion of the role of stigma and reduced help seeking is
warranted. Such work will inform the development of
acceptable interventions delivered after potentially trau-
matic losses. Our findings suggest that suicide risk assess-
ment should extend screening for a family history of
suicide to any history of suicide in non-blood relatives
and friends. However, until we have evidence-based
interventions for this group, the best ways of mitigating
this risk of suicide attempt are unclear.
