Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in numerous human diseases leading to an
increased interest in assessing vitamin D status. Consequentially, the number of requests for vitamin
D measurement keeps dramatically increasing year-on-year. Currently, the recognised best marker of
vitamin D status is the concentration of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) in the blood circulation.
While providing an accurate estimate of vitamin D status at the point in time of sampling, it cannot
account for the high variability of 25(OH)D3 concentration. In this proof of concept study we set out
to provide evidence that 25(OH)D3 can be extracted from hair samples in a similar fashion to steroid
hormones. Two of the authors (L.Z. and M.H.) provided hair samples harvested from the crown area
of the scalp and the third author (E.L.) provided beard samples. These samples, cut into 1 cm lengths,
were weighed, washed and dried. 25(OH)D was extracted using a previously published steroid
hormones extraction procedure. Blood samples were taken from the subjects at the same time all
tissue samples were analysed using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Hair samples showed
presence of quantifiable 25(OH)D3 with concentrations ranging from 11.9–911 pg/mg. The beard
sample had a concentration of 231 pg/mg. Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 ranged from 72–78 nmol/L.
The results presented here confirm the feasibility of measuring 25(OH)D3 in hair samples. The
findings warrant further validation and development and have the potential to yield valuable
information relating to temporal trends in vitamin D physiology.

1. Introduction
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with a wide range of diseases, including bone health,
cancer, susceptibility to infections, inflammation and autoimmune, cardiovascular, and metabolic
diseases [1,2]. The main sources of vitamin D for humans are dermal synthesis in skin following
exposure to sunlight [3,4] and vitamin D supplements [5,6]; unless fortified, dietary sources are
virtually negligible for the majority of people [7,8]. Because of our indoor oriented lifestyle, clothing,
use of skin products (that block UVB light), pollution, etc. the opportunity for skin synthesis is
reduced and vitamin D deficiency is a world-wide epidemic with over 1 billion people estimated to be
deficient [9].
Once vitamin D is ingested or synthesised in the skin, it is hydroxylated in the liver to
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). This form of vitamin D is most abundant in the human body,
and acts as a storage form of vitamin D. Currently, the internationally recognised way of assessing
vitamin D status is to measure the concentration of circulating 25(OH)D in blood samples. There are
several methods available for achieving this. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
is regarded as the gold standard and has the advantages of sensitivity, specificity and the ability to
resolve 25(OH)D3, the physiological form of the vitamin from its plant-based isomer 25(OH)D2 [10–12].

Immunochemistry assays are a commonly used alternative for 25(OH)D estimation but have significant
drawbacks, for example the inability to fully detect and quantitate the 25(OH)D2 isomer and
cross-reactivity with other metabolites of vitamin D such as 24,25(OH)2D.
Analysis of blood samples for vitamin D is not without disadvantages. It is invasive, requires
expertise, training, and appropriate equipment and hygienic conditions, so obtaining samples
frequently—or in some cases at all—is not always workable. In addition, the resulting concentration
represents a single point in time of vitamin D standing and gives limited information on an individual’s
long-term status.
All forms of vitamin D belong to the secosteroid family in which a bond (C9–C10) in ring B of
the steroid structure is broken. Secosteroids share structural similarities with steroid hormones such
as cortisol and testosterone. The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,
is considered a steroid hormone because of its actions in binding and activating the nuclear vitamin
D receptor. Hair testing has been available for several years in forensic testing and for the analysis
of steroids [13–16]. It has several advantages over traditional matrices in that it is non-invasive,
sample is easily stored and transported, and is very stable over long periods of time even without
sample preparation or refrigeration. Moreover, hair samples can provide a longitudinal view of chosen
biomarker. This approach of analysing hair samples has not been applied to vitamin D.
We carried out a proof-of-concept study to provide preliminary data on the feasibility of extracting
and measuring vitamin D in hair samples. To the best of our knowledge vitamin D analysis in hair
samples has not been previously reported in the literature.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Subjects
The subjects included the three study authors. Initially, L.Z. provided a hair sample (brown head
hair) in March 2018 (Study 1). Following a successful detection of the vitamin, the experiment was
replicated in July 2018 (Study 2) when three subjects provided hair and blood samples. All three
subjects provided informed consent to participate in the study; ethical approval was not required
because investigators themselves provided all of samples.
2.2. Hair Collection, Washing and Sample Preparation
The hair collection procedure followed the consensus recommendations provided by the Society
of Hair Testing [17]. L.Z. and M.H. provided hair samples, approximately 14 cm and 4 cm long,
respectively. The hair (dry) was cut as close as possible from posterior vertex region of the scalp.
Samples were cut into 1.25 cm segments analysed separately; L.Z. hair was cut into 11 segments and
M.H. hair sample into 4 segments. E.L. provided the beard sample (2 bundles of 4 cm length). All
samples were given an identification number, weighed, and stored in a dry and dark environment at
room temperature until ready for transport to the laboratory for analysis.
This proof of concept investigation was instigated to determine if vitamin D (in the form of
25-hydroxyvitamin D3) was present in hair samples in measurable amounts. We reviewed the literature
and found no reports on extraction of vitamin D from hair samples. Because of the secosteroid structure
of vitamin D we employed a previously developed procedure for steroid hormone extraction from
hair [18].
The first step in sample preparation involved washing, which decontaminates the outer surface
of the hair by removing non-blood-borne steroids. Washing also prevents analytical interferences from
external sources, such as hair care products, sweat, sebum, etc. Samples were individually washed
by vortexing in 2.0 mL isopropanol for two minutes at room temperature to remove contaminants.
Samples were subsequently dried using lint-free tissue and cut into smaller strips. These were
transferred to glass test tubes and 25(OH)D was extracted by adding 1.4 mL mass spectrometry grade
methanol and mixing on a roller mixer for 18 h. Following the extraction period samples were spun at

1500 g for 15 min. The methanol extracts were transferred to new tubes and evaporated under nitrogen
stream at 50 ◦C until dry. Samples were re-suspended in 120 µL methanol for assay by LC-MS/MS.
Blank samples containing no hair and brought through the extraction process were included in the
analyses. In the isopropanol cleaning step aliquots of the wash solution were taken for analysis to
determine if 25(OH)D leaching occurred from hair samples during this step.
2.3. Blood Sample Collection
A blood sample (7 mL, non-fasting) was collected by venepuncture into an evacuated tube by
a trained phlebotomist. Samples were kept chilled and centrifuged (1500 g for 15 min) within 3 h of
collection and serum aliquots were labelled and stored at −80 ◦C until required for analysis.
2.4. 25(OH)D Assessment
Both serum and re-suspended hair extracts were assayed using a validated mass spectrometry
method developed by Chromsystems Instruments and Chemicals GmbH, Munich (Mass
Chrom-25-OH-Vitamin D3/D2) using tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (API 4000;
SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) and analysed in the Biochemistry Department of St. James’s Hospital,
Dublin, Ireland. The laboratory is ISO 15189 accredited. Visualisation of vitamin D chromatography
and calculation of concentrations is performed by propriety software (Analyst 1.6.1: Sciex, Framingham,
MA, USA). Assay quality was monitored using in-house and third-party quality controls. Accuracy
was determined using the National Institute of Standards and Technology vitamin D standard reference
material 972. The laboratory also participates in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme
(DEQAS). The respective inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 5.7% and 4.5%.
2.5. Approximation of 25(OH)D Concentration in Hair
The following equation [19] was used to approximate the concentration (pg/mg) of 25OHD3 in
hair samples:
c
� pg
mg
�
(hair) = c(calculated)
� ng
mL
� × V1(extraction)[mL]
V2(evaporation)[mL]
V3(reconstitution)[mL] × m(sample)[mg]
× 1000
where c (calculated) is the concentration of 25(OH)D3 obtained by LC-MS/MS in nmol/L ÷ 2.5
(to convert to ng/mL); V1 (extraction volume = 1.4 mL); V2 (evaporation volume = 1.4 mL);
V3 (reconstitution volume = 120 µL (0.120 mL)).
3. Results
The characteristics of subjects and samples are presented in Tables 1 and 2. One female and two
males were included; all participants were normal weight and reported taking vitamin D supplements
(1000 IU D3 daily). All subjects were vitamin D sufficient (circulating 25OHD3 > 50 nmol/L).

In Study 1, one hair sample (bunched sample of 75 mg) was analysed by LC-MS/MS and
25(OH)D3 was detected. The chromatogram for the initial exploratory study demonstrated a clear
signal for the presence of vitamin D in the hair sample is shown in Figure 1 (the absence of a 25(OH)D3
peak in the blank sample was noted).

In Study 2, the experiment was repeated in 15 hair and one beard sample and in blood samples. 
Weight of hair samples varied between 20 and 44 mg (median 28 mg; mean 29.38±6.88(SD) mg). LC-
MS/MS method detected 25(OH)D3 in hair samples from all subjects. Virtually no 25(OH)D2 was 
observed in any of the samples. A large variation was observed in measurements. 25(OH)D3 
concentrations were low in all LZ samples, with 25(OH)D3 undetectable in some hair segments. 
Average approximated 25(OH)D3 concentration in LZ samples was 19 pg/mg (highest 30.9 pg/mg). 
In contrast, in MH samples average approximated concentration was 421 pg/mg (lowest 26.5 and 
highest 911 pg/mg, Figure 2. In the EL beard sample, concentration was approximated to be 231 
pg/mg (Figure 3).

subjects averaged 75 nmol/L. Hair concentrations of the vitamin had a median concentration of 28.7 
pg/mg in all samples tested although there was a significant variance in levels between LZ and MH. 
There is limited evidence for a direct relationship between serum and hair concentrations of steroid 
hormones and the mechanisms by which metabolites enter hair are not fully understood. Both steroid 
hormones and 25(OH)D3 differ in the dynamics of their circulation on a daily basis and traditional 
blood serum analysis is a snapshot that yields little temporal information of the status of metabolic 
products. In contrast segmental analysis of hair, which grows at approximately 1cm/month, provides 
an historical blueprint of the systemic status of hormone circulation over a period of months [20] and

Previous work in this area has involved measuring a range of minerals in hair and then using 
computational modelling to estimate the vitamin D status [21,22]. Although this can give an estimate, 
it does not measure the actual concentrations of vitamin D in the hair itself. Within the current study, 
we have used a mathematical formula that takes the measured concentrations obtained by LC-MS/MS 
and approximates the concentration in the hair [18]. While serum concentrations were in the sufficient 
range and quite similar in all study subjects, we have observed a large variation between subjects and 
some variation within subjects of hair 25(OH)D3 levels. Further research is needed to establish 
whether 25(OH)D deposition in hair is reflective of 25(OH)D in the blood at the time of deposition, 
and also to investigate what other factors affect the 25(OH)D in hair: concentration might be affected 
by other (steroid) hormones (and hence it might differ between males and females); colour or other 
hair characteristics, behaviours such as time spent in the sun (photodegradation) [23] and other 
personal characteristics and behaviours may all affect the deposition and/or degradation of 25(OH)D 
in hair. Factors that might affect the extraction process also need to be investigated. The lack of 
correlation between the blood concentrations and those measured in the hair is not unexpected. While 
blood concentration is a point-measurement of vitamin D status, hair provides a period-measurement 
with lag and hence may not correlate significantly with blood levels (Figure 4). Hair analysis, 
therefore, of 25(OH)D3 is not seen as a replacement of blood measurements but an adjunct with the 
ability of providing more information on long term vitamin D status – ‘the tree-ring effect’. This 
would be particularly useful for long-term epidemiological research, longitudinal studies and for 
long duration vitamin D randomized controlled trials where hair could be used to detect compliance 
with supplementation.  
Additional advantages that relate to the proposed hair sampling procedure are: i) it would be 
painless as no venepuncture is necessary – this is particularly important for some subgroups, most 
notably children, other vulnerable individuals, and those in need of repeated testing or in a setting 
where phlebotomy is not readily accessible. ii) it is simpler and does not require the involvement of 
a professional (such as a nurse) or an array of consumables (tubes, needles, alcohol wipes etc). iii) the 
sample handling is risk-free (eg. blood born infections). iv) samples can be safely despatched from 
anywhere by post – this is in contrast to specialist shipment required for blood preparations. v) hair 
samples for analysis are extremely stable. 
Other applications of the method could also involve analysis of historical samples from 
archaeological sites. Hair (along with teeth) are some of the longest lasting surviving biological 
materials after death [24] and thus it could be possible to for the first time assess the vitamin D status 
of historical populations – Elizabethans, Viking, Celtic, Roman, ancient Chinese, Egyptian, bronze 
age etc. and even possibly older humans if any surviving hair can be found in the permafrost. New 
insights in population genetics might be gained, as the evolution of lighter skin colour is hypothesised 
to be linked with vitamin D deficiency [25]. Similarly, hair samples could also be used to assess

population genetics might be gained, as the evolution of lighter skin colour is hypothesised to be linked
with vitamin D deficiency [25]. Similarly, hair samples could also be used to assess longer-term vitamin
D status in animals with applications in farming, for example improving fertility [26]. The vitamin
D status of ancient species could be measured given the well preserved and copious amounts of, for
example, mammoth or ancient ice age animal hair that is often unearthed from the warming permafrost
and in museum specimens.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure and successfully demonstrate
the presence of 25(OH)D in hair samples. We replicated our first pilot study with additional samples,
we measured different hair types, colours and different gender and ages of participants. LC-MS/MS
was used for 25(OH)D detection; this method has very high sensitivity and specificity even at small
concentrations and is recognised as the gold standard of vitamin D assessment [12]. Our study also
has some limitations. In particular the small sample size, a limited number of measurements, and
lack of variability of serum vitamin D concentration between subjects. Furthermore, we also had no
data on past vitamin D status and sun exposure. The LC-MS method employed in this study does not
resolve inactive epimers of 25(OH)D3 although their circulating concentrations are very low and add
negligibly to overall vitamin D status in non-neonatal samples [27].
Larger studies encompassing assay optimisation and validation, greater variability in 25(OH)D3
status, different age and ethnic groups, multiple blood measurements and information on a range of
other relevant factors are needed to further our understanding of the relationship between circulating
25(OH)D levels and concentration in hair. Concentration in hair segments for which an exact growth
time is known has the potential to provide useful information on variations in 25(OH)D3 concentration
over that time period, but further research is needed.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we confirmed the proof of concept that 25(OH)D3 can be detected in human
hair and beard samples. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between circulating
concentration and 25(OH)D3 found in hair in different population groups, and to estimate levels in
different age groups, genders, ethnicities, animals and historical samples. Given the high proportion
of vitamin D deficiency across the world and the ever-increasing demand for 25(OH)D3 blood testing,
a non-invasive method that captures vitamin D status over a prolonged time period has the potential
to add significantly to vitamin D epidemiological studies. In addition, where phlebotomy is not readily
available, a hair sample would make a useful substitute to determine vitamin D status.
