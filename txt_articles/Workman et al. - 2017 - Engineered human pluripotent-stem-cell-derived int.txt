 The enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract controls many diverse functions, 
including motility and epithelial permeability. Perturbations in ENS development or function are 
common, yet there is no human model for studying ENS-intestinal biology and disease. We used a 
tissue-engineering approach with embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to generate 
human intestinal tissue containing a functional ENS. We recapitulated normal intestinal ENS 
development by combining human-PSC-derived neural crest cells (NCCs) and developing human 
intestinal organoids (HIOs). NCCs recombined with HIOs in vitro migrated into the mesenchyme, 
differentiated into neurons and glial cells and showed neuronal activity, as measured by rhythmic 
waves of calcium transients. ENS-containing HIOs grown in vivo formed neuroglial structures 
similar to a myenteric and submucosal plexus, had functional interstitial cells of Cajal and had an 
electromechanical coupling that regulated waves of propagating contraction. Finally, we used this 
system to investigate the cellular and molecular basis for Hirschsprung's disease caused by a 
mutation in the gene PHOX2B. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of 
human-PSC-derived intestinal tissue with a functional ENS and how this system can be used to 
study motility disorders of the human gastrointestinal tract.
The ENS is essential for gastrointestinal (GI) motility, secretion, blood flow, epithelial 
barrier permeability and fluid exchange1. Developmentally, the majority of the ENS arises 
from vagal NCCs that derive from the dorsal neural tube and migrate ventrally to colonize 
the foregut around embryonic week 4 in humans. Subsequently, the NCCs proliferate 
extensively and migrate caudally to colonize the entire GI tract by 7 weeks of human 
gestation2. When enteric NCCs fail to properly migrate, proliferate, survive and/or 
differentiate in the GI tract, defects occur in the structure and function of the ENS, and 
patients present with a spectrum of enteric neuropathies3. In addition, enteric neuropathies 
are common in digestive diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and often occur 
secondarily in diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus and age-related 
degeneration4. The lack of human ENS model systems for studying the physiopathological 
processes of enteric neuropathies may account for the surprisingly slow progress in their 
diagnosis and treatment. For example, the treatment of patients with congenital lack of 
enteric ganglia, known as Hirschsprung's disease (1 in 5,000 births), involves surgical 
resection of the aganglionic gut segment, which may result in extensive loss of both the 
colon and small bowel. Although the remaining bowel contains ganglia, it remains unclear 
why many of these patients experience recurrent bouts of enterocolitis and dysmotility5. 
Enteric neurons derived from human PSCs, enteric progenitors or neural stem cells derived 
from the CNS incorporate into and function in aganglionic chick and murine GI explants 
(reviewed in ref. 6), which suggests that a similar cell-therapy approach might work in 
humans.
However, much work remains to be done regarding our understanding of human ENS 
development and disease. Very little is known about the etiology of enteric neuropathies and 
the mechanisms that drive various aspects of human ENS development, such as the 
formation of neuronal diversity, remain unclear7. Although there is currently no way to study 
human ENS development functionally, recent progress using the directed differentiation of 
human PSCs has resulted in the formation of complex and physiological three-dimensional 
human organ cultures, known as organoids8. Organoid models have been developed for

 intestine, liver, stomach, CNS, thyroid and lung, among other tissues, and have allowed for 
unprecedented studies of human developmental biology and disease. Despite the remarkable 
complexity of organoids, they lack the cell and tissue types that are required for full organ 
function. For example, none of the organoid systems contain an integrated peripheral 
nervous system. We used principles of embryonic organogenesis to generate three-
dimensional HIOs containing a functional ENS.
Results
Generation of human intestinal organoids incorporating ENS
Previously, we developed a method of differentiating human embryonic and induced PSCs 
into intestinal organoids by following a stepwise differentiation first into definitive 
endoderm, and then into mid/hindgut tube spheroids that expand into three-dimensional 
intestinal tissue in vitro9,10 (Supplementary Fig. 1). When HIOs were engrafted into the 
kidney subcapsular space, they continued to develop and formed highly differentiated 
intestinal tissue with crypts and villi, functional intestinal stem cells and layers of smooth 
muscle11 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Although HIOs contained most of the epithelial and 
mesenchymal cell types found in the developing gut, they did not contain an ENS. To 
generate HIOs containing ENS cell types, we first generated human vagal NCCs, the 
precursors of the ENS, using a modified version of a previously reported method of 
generating cranial NCCs12 (Supplementary Figs. 1d and 2a–d). This involved manipulating 
signaling pathways that are known to promote a posterior/vagal fate; treatment with retinoic 
acid (RA) for 2 d at the neurosphere stage resulted in the robust expression of the vagal-level 
Hox genes HOXB3, HOXB5 and HOXB7 (Supplementary Fig. 2e), similarly to previous 
observations13. We confirmed differentiation of NCCs at each stage by analysis of early and 
late neural crest markers by immunofluorescence (HNK-1, PAX6, p75NTR, SOX2, VIM) and 
quantitative PCR (AP2, PAX3, PAX7, SOX10, SNAIL2, ZIC1) (Supplementary Fig. 2). We 
then compared PSC-derived NCCs with isolated cranial NCCs from chick embryos and 
found that embryonic NCCs also expressed vagal Hox genes in response to RA 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a–c), consistent with the known role of RA in vagal NCC 
development14. We further tested whether human-PSC-derived NCCs had neural crest cell 
behaviors by injecting them into chick embryos, where they followed a migratory path 
similar to that of endogenous NCCs and differentiated into neurons (Supplementary Fig. 3d–
f). We demonstrated multipotency of both cranial and RA-treated NCCs by differentiating 
them in vitro into Peripherin+ neurons and GFAP+ glial cells, as well as mesodermal 
lineages, including osteocytes and chondrocytes, as indicated by positive staining for alizarin 
red and alcian blue, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4a). These data all support the 
conclusion that this differentiation method generates functional NCCs.
To incorporate vagal NCCs and ENS precursors into developing HIOs, we mechanically 
aggregated mid/hindgut spheroids with PSC-derived NCCs by low-speed centrifugation and 
transferred aggregates to three-dimensional growth conditions for 28 d (Supplementary Fig. 
1d). HIOs with and without NCCs were comparable in size (1–2 mm in diameter); however, 
we detected an abundance of βIII-tubulin (TUBB3)+ neurons and S100β+ glia embedded in 
the mesenchyme of HIOs combined with NCCs (HIOs with NCC-derived ENS will now be

 referred to as HIOs+ENS) (Fig. 1a). We rarely detected neurons and never detected glia in 
HIOs without NCCs in vitro. Moreover, we confirmed the NCC origin of neuroglial cells by 
using NCCs that were derived from an embryonic stem cell line that constitutively expresses 
GFP (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The spatial relationship between the epithelium, mesenchyme 
and neuroglial cells in HIOs+ENS closely resembled that of human fetal intestine15 and 
embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) mouse small intestine (Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting that 
intrinsic cues in HIOs help to organize the developing ENS cells. Consistently with this, 
HIOs expressed both GDNF and EDN3, two crucial chemoattractants that are known to 
regulate NCC migration into the gut mesenchyme6,16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 4d), suggesting 
that the incorporation of PSC-derived NCCs into HIOs mesenchyme may utilize normal 
developmental pathways.
The ENS is a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes, as well as 
sensory neurons and interneurons. Histological examination of neuronal markers in HIOs
+ENS cultured in vitro for 4 weeks suggested a substantial degree of neuronal diversity. We 
observed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), calbindin (CALB1), calretinin (CALB2), choline 
acetyltransferase (CHAT) and serotonin (5-HT) positive cells, which are expressed by 
interneurons and dopaminergic and excitatory neurons (Fig. 1b). However, we did not detect 
neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) in vitro. To broadly identify the 
transcriptional changes that occur in whole HIOs following the incorporation of ENS 
progenitor cells, we performed an RNA-seq analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
of the gene expression data and Spearman rank correlation demonstrated the segregation of 
the HIOs and HIOs+ENS groups (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). A differential gene expression 
analysis revealed that the expression levels of 4,283 genes out of 40,448 were statistically 
different between HIO and HIO+ENS groups (moderated t test; P < 0.05). With a fold-
change greater than 3, 1,240 and 307 transcripts were up- and downregulated in HIOs+ENS, 
respectively. Using gene ontology analysis (ToppGene Suite) and a reduce and visualize 
gene ontology (ReViGO), we found that transcripts that were higher in the HIOs+ENS 
group were largely related to nervous system development and neuron differentiation (Fig. 
1c and Supplementary Fig. 5c). Genes related to enteric neuronal development, including 
PHOX2A, PHOX2B, ASCL1 and EDNRB, were expressed more highly in HIOs+ENS than 
HIO samples (Fig. 1d). Notably, NOS1 mRNA was present in HIOs+ENS, despite the fact 
that NOS1 protein was not detected (Fig. 1e).
Maturation of the ENS following in vivo growth
HIOs that were engrafted into mice and allowed to grow for 6–10 weeks in vivo became 
vascularized, grew to 1–3 cm in diameter and formed highly mature intestinal tissues, with 
villi and crypts containing functional intestinal stem cells (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 
1c)11. Moreover, the HIO mesenchyme matured into submucosal and myenteric layers of 
smooth muscle fibers (Fig. 2b). Transplantation of HIOs+ENS resulted in the generation of 
neurons (TUBB3) and glia (S100β) that were organized into ganglionated structures in close 
proximity to the submucosal and myenteric layers of smooth muscle fibers (Fig. 2b). We did 
not detect neurons or glia in transplanted HIOs without NCCs. Although these experiments 
were performed with vagal/HOX-positive NCC populations, PSC-derived cranial/HOX-
negative NCCs were also able to engraft and form ENS neuroglial cells. However, cranial

 NCCs also formed pigmented epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 6) and 
cartilage (data not shown), consistent with them having a broader multipotency.
We performed whole-mount immunofluorescence imaging of tissues from HIOs+ENS 
matured in vivo and compared these to adult and infant human small intestine. The ENS of 
human small bowel contained a network of both neurons (TUBB3) and glia (S100β). The 
ENS that formed in the developing HIOs similarly contained a neural plexus of TUBB3+ 
neurons and S100β+ glia that appeared to be closely associated with smooth muscle fibers 
(Fig. 2c,d, Supplementary Fig. 7a,b and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). We also observed 
clusters of HuC/D+ neuronal cell bodies in HIOs+ENS, both in sections and by whole 
mount, that were reminiscent of ganglia (Supplementary Fig. 7c). However, relative to 
human intestine, the ganglia in HIOs+ENS were lower in cell body density. Notably, the 
examination of neural markers in transplanted HIOs+ENS revealed the presence of TH-, 
CALB1-, calretinin-, CHAT- and 5-HT-positive fibers (Supplementary Fig. 7d). In addition, 
NOS1 was expressed in the HIOs+ENS after in vivo maturation. This latter is in contrast 
with in vitro HIOs+ENS, which lack nNOS+ neurons, suggesting that the ENS matured 
during the period of in vivo growth.
Neuronal calcium oscillations in HIOs+ENS
We next tested the functionality of neurons in HIOs in vitro by using live imaging with the 
Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f (ref. 18). To do this, we generated ENS cells from a human iPS cell 
line expressing GCaMP6f (ref. 19) and incorporated them into HIOs that did not express a 
reporter. Imaging of ENS cells in HIOs after 8 weeks in vitro revealed broad, spontaneous 
and rapid calcium transients in ENS cells (Supplementary Fig. 8). When individual cells 
were monitored, there was an obvious periodicity of calcium efflux in the range of 2–4 min 
in NCC-derived cells (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Video 3). To determine whether ENS cells 
are capable of undergoing coordinated activity, we exposed organoids to KCl (30 mM) and 
observed a large wave of calcium efflux (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Video 4). Using live 
imaging with the Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f on explanted HIOs+ENS grown in vivo, we were 
able to identify bundles of fibers that had calcium transients with spontaneous activity (Fig. 
3c and Supplementary Video 5) that were triggered following KCl treatment (30 mM) (Fig. 
3c and Supplementary Video 6).
ENS-mediated contractile activity
Although the organization of epithelium, smooth muscle, neurons and glia in HIOs+ENS 
tissues is similar to that of human intestine, it is not clear whether any neuromuscular 
communication exists in HIOs+ENS tissues. To stimulate neurons, we explanted kidney 
grafts into Tyrode's solution and subjected them to electrical-field stimulation and monitored 
them for muscular contractions (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Videos 7–9). HIO tissue without 
an ENS was subjected to a single 1-ms pulse at 100 V, which caused a single contraction, 
suggesting the direct stimulation of smooth muscle. By contrast, HIOs containing an ENS 
subjected to a single 1-ms pulse at 50 V (below muscle activation threshold) was sufficient 
to trigger a sustained wave of contractions. To determine whether the contractions were a 
result of the activity of the ENS, we blocked neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX), 
which binds to voltage-gated Na+ channels on nerves, thereby inhibiting the firing of action

 potentials. TTX completely inhibited the ability of low-voltage stimulation to trigger 
contractile activity in HIOs+ENS.
GI motility involves the coordination of ENS and pacemaker cells known as ICCs. ICCs 
mediate rhythmic contraction of smooth muscle independently from the ENS, whereas 
relaxation of smooth muscle is ENS dependent. To dissect these processes, we isolated 
tissue strips from HIOs and HIOs+ENS and analyzed them using isometric-force 
measurement assays in an organ-bath chamber. In the absence of neuronal stimulation, we 
observed spontaneous phasic contractions in both HIO and HIO+ENS tissues (Fig. 4b and 
Supplementary Fig. 9a), suggesting the presence of ICCs in both conditions. Methylene 
blue, which inhibits ICC activity, abolished phasic contractions (Fig. 4c), supporting the 
conclusion that phasic contractions in HIOs and HIOs+ENS are driven by ICCs. 
Consistently with this, we observed clusters of cells expressing the ICC marker CD117 in 
both HIOs and HIOs+ENS (Fig. 4d). This suggests that ICCs develop from the mesenchyme 
and do not originate from the neural crest. However, ICCs were closely associated with 
neurons in HIOs+ENS and seemed to form larger clusters in the presence of neural-crest-
derived ENS cells.
ENS-mediated neuromuscular coupling
To identify ENS-dependent roles in contraction and relaxation, we activated neurons by 
using the selective α3-nicotinic receptor agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) and 
veratridine, which increases nerve excitability by inhibiting Na+ channel inactivation. 
Pharmacological activation of the ENS induced a muscle relaxation in HIOs+ENS, but not 
in HIOs alone (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 9b). We next confirmed that relaxation was 
neuron dependent by using TTX, which inhibited the ability of DMPP to induce muscle 
relaxation (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 9c). Lastly, we sought to identify a putative 
neuromediator responsible for the smooth-muscle relaxation that was induced by ENS 
activation. Given the abundance of nNOS-expressing neurons in transplanted in HIOs+ENS 
(Fig. 4g), and the fact that nitric oxide (NO) is a well-known enteric muscle inhibitory 
neuromediator, we inhibited NO synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-
NAME). L-NAME pretreatment significantly decreased the relaxation after DMPP 
stimulation, indicating that NO was produced by the neurons to induce relaxation (Fig. 4h 
and Supplementary Fig. 9d). We further found that the addition of a NO-releasing drug, 
sodium nitroprusside (SNP), induced muscle relaxation in HIOs+ENS, supporting the idea 
that NO release mediates relaxation (Supplementary Fig. 9e).
Effects of ENS on intestinal organoid development
During embryonic development, the ENS plexus forms functional connections with smooth 
muscle and the intestinal epithelium, and few studies have investigated whether the ENS 
influences the development of these tissues (reviewed in ref. 20). Thus, we used this human 
system to examine the effect of the ENS on the development of other intestinal lineages 
using RNA-seq data from whole HIOs and HIOs+ENS grown in vitro. We first analyzed 
curated lists of genes associated with digestive-tract development and digestive functions 
(Fig. 5a,b) and found that HIOs+ENS differentially expressed genes associated with GI 
development, as compared to HIOs alone. In one example, the presence of an ENS increased

 the levels of EGF signaling components and decreased the levels of TGF-β signaling factors 
(Fig. 5a). The ENS also affected the expression of genes associated with the absorptive and 
secretory lineages (Fig. 5c). For example, we observed decreased levels of absorptive 
lineage genes in HIOs+ENS as compared to HIOs alone, including enzyme brush borders 
genes FABP2, LCT, TREH, SI and MGAM. Secretory lineages were also affected, with a 
decrease in goblet cell markers, such as MUC2, and a decrease in differentiated Paneth cell 
markers, but an increase in WNT3. Consistent with this, we saw an increase in some active 
intestinal stem cell and transit-amplifying cell genes (Fig. 5c). To examine whether the ENS 
regulates the intestinal stem cell/transit-amplifying compartment, we analyzed the 
proliferation in the crypts of HIOs and HIOs+ENS grown in vivo. HIOs+ENS exhibited 
increased proliferation in the crypt compartment to a level that was similar to that seen in the 
human jejunum (Fig. 5d).
In addition to the regulation of intestinal-barrier homeostasis, the ENS interacts with 
enteroendocrine cells (EECs) to both transmit and receive information related to luminal 
nutrients and nutrient homeostasis21. HIOs+ENS contained CHGA+ and SYN1+ EECs in 
the epithelium, as did the human jejunal epithelial, and in both cases, EECs were associated 
with ENS cells (Fig. 5e). However, human jejunal EECs contained neuropods associated 
with neuronal fibers, whereas transplanted HIOs+ENS did not. HIOs+ENS tissues had a less 
developed neuronal network, reminiscent of fetal intestine, suggesting that EEC and 
neuronal-fiber interactions had not yet been established (Fig. 5e). The developmental timing 
of this process is not established in humans and might require additional environmental cues, 
such as exposure to luminal flow, nutrients and/or microbes.
PHOX2B mutation in HIOs+ENS
Impaired neural crest and ENS development is the underlying cause of several genetic forms 
of Hirschsprung's disease in humans3. Mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine kinase 
receptor RET are among the most common causes of Hirschsprung's disease and have been 
well studied. However, there are an increasing number of genes associated with 
Hirschsprung's disease, about which little is known. For example, mutations in the PHOX2B 
homeobox-containing transcription factor result in complete aganglionosis of the bowel of 
humans22 and mice23. Despite the obvious phenotype, the molecular pathways that are 
affected by PHOX2B mutations have not been identified in humans, so we used HIO+ENS 
as a model system to study this form of Hirschsprung's disease.
We generated induced PSCs containing PHOX2B+/+, PHOX2B+/Y14X and 
PHOX2BY14X/Y14X alleles and differentiated them into vagal NCCs that expressed posterior 
HOX genes such as HOXB3, B5 and B7 (refs. 24–26) (Supplementary Fig. 10). NCCs were 
then recombined with wild-type HIOs generated from H1 embryonic stem cells to generate 
HIOs+ENS. Transcriptional analysis of organoids in vitro revealed a distinct clustering of 
transcripts according to genotype, with many genes being altered in both the PHOX2B
+/Y14X and PHOX2BY14X/Y14X HIOs+ENS relative to PHOX2B+/+ organoids (Fig. 6a). The 
expression levels of several neural-crest-related genes were reduced, including PHOX2B, 
HTR3A, HTR3B, TLX2, EDN1 and EDNRB. However, the most notable increase was in 
CNS markers. The top biological processes that were upregulated in the PHOX2BY14X/Y14X

 NCCs were forebrain development, cerebral cortex development, pallium development and 
telencephalon development. The top biological terms downregulated were all related to 
muscle development, suggesting that PHOX2BY14X/Y14X NCCs inhibited differentiation of 
smooth muscle in the HIOs (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 10d). Consistent with this, 
HIOs + PHOX2BY14X/Y14X NCCs that were transplanted in mice grew poorly (1 out of 3 
grafts grew), as compared with control NCCs (3 out of 3 grafts grew), had few neurons 
(TUBB3) and showed poorly developed smooth muscle (DES) (Fig. 6c). These data suggest 
that differentiation of PHOX2B mutant NCCs was impaired and that NCCs had non-cell-
autonomous effects on the development of other HIO cell types, such as smooth muscle. 
Moreover, this human-PSC-derived intestinal model seems well suited for mechanistically 
studying genetic forms of Hirschsprung's disease in humans.
Discussion
We used principles of embryonic intestinal development to engineer human-PSC-derived 
intestinal tissue containing a functional ENS. Human-PSC-derived vagal-like NCCs that 
were recombined with PSC-derived intestinal organoids in three-dimensional growth 
conditions migrated into intestinal mesenchyme, self-organized and differentiated into an 
array of neuronal and glial cell types of the ENS. After engraftment and growth in vivo, 
NCCs formed complex ganglionic structures and interganglionic fibers, similar to the 
embryonic development of the myenteric and submucosal neural plexuses. We further found 
that the NCC-derived ENS was functionally integrated into intestinal smooth muscle and 
drove NO-dependent relaxation. The degree of tissue organization seen in transplanted HIOs
+ENS suggests that the tissue that we engineered in vitro had the intrinsic information for 
coordinated cell migration, proliferation, lineage commitment and assembly into a plexus 
that occurs during embryonic development of the ENS.
We routinely observed the formation of a neuroglial plexus in transplanted HIOs+ENS, in 
close association with smooth-muscle fibers with organization similar to the neonatal 
myenteric plexus. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the NCC-derived ENS 
was less mature and more fetal in nature. For example, development of a submucosal plexus 
seemed to be delayed in HIO+ENS tissues, and this could be similar to the development in 
the human fetal gut, where the submucosal plexus develops 2–3 weeks after the myenteric 
plexus27. Another indicator of developmental immaturity is that the neuroglial plexus in 
HIOs+ENS contained smaller nerve bundles than the adult human intestine, similar to what 
is observed in the human fetal gut15. Another possibility is that the smaller nerve bundles 
were a result of too few starting NCCs in the HIO cultures, as is in the case in 
Hirschsprung's disease. The immature and fetal nature of HIO+ENS tissues may provide an 
opportunity to identify specific factors that regulate the maturation of the fetal gut and ENS. 
For example, it was recently demonstrated that the microbiota of the lumen influences the 
colonization of the mucosa by glial cells28, and the HIOs ± ENS model could allow for 
mechanistic dissection of this process. Factors that promote intestinal maturation could be 
used clinically with premature infants, who are at heightened risk for intestinal infections 
resulting from an immature mucosa.

 We observed a substantial degree of neuronal diversity in HIOs+ENS in vitro, including 
excitatory and interneurons that had intrinsic and inducible waves of calcium efflux, 
suggestive of neuronal activity. HIOs+ENS that were grown in vivo acquired additional 
neuronal diversity in the form of nNOS+ inhibitory neurons, which are known to form after 
cholinergic neurons in the developing fetal mouse gut29. To our surprise, CHAT-positive 
neurons, which appear at early stages during ENS development30, were found in HIOs+ENS 
in vitro, but were not detected in HIOs+ENS in vivo. There is evidence for transient 
expression of neurochemical markers, such as CHAT-positive neurons20, suggesting that 
embryonic expression may not mark cells that ultimately form cholinergic neurons. 
Moreover, neuroglial cells assembled into a myenteric and submucosal plexus that were 
functionally associated with highly differentiated layers of smooth muscle. Electrical-field 
stimulation (EFS) of these engineered tissues triggered ENS-dependent waves of contractile 
activity that resemble human intestinal motility. However, we also observed contractile 
activity that was dependent on resident ICCs that were present in both HIOs and HIO+ENS. 
Taken together, our data suggest that ICCs largely drive contraction, whereas relaxation of 
muscle is ENS dependent and mediated by nNOS+ inhibitory neurons that are present in 
HIO+ENS tissue. The fact that nNOS+ inhibitory neurons became functional earlier than 
cholinergic excitatory neurons further supports the conclusion that the ENS in HIOs is fetal 
in nature.
There are several pronounced differences between rodents and humans regarding 
development, physiology and diseases of the intestine. For example, the development of 
crypts occurs in utero in humans, whereas it happens postnatally in mice. During ENS 
development there are differences in the formation of TH+ neurons between mouse and 
humans31–33. Given that HIOs+ENS contain TH+ neurons in vitro and in vivo, this system 
may be the only means by which to study the unique developmental properties of these cell 
types. Moreover, an experimental system to study human TH+ dopaminergic ENS neurons 
may provide insight into GI dysmotility symptoms found in patients with Parkinson's34. 
Because of its highly tractable nature, this system should be particularly useful for studying 
developmental deficits of the ENS, such as Hirschsprung's disease. Defects in NCC 
formation, migration, incorporation into the mesenchyme and proliferation can all result in 
aganglionic sections of the intestine. As we have demonstrated using PSCs with PHOX2B 
mutations, this in vitro system allows for mechanistic dissection of known and unknown 
forms of Hirschsprung's disease in humans. There is high enthusiasm for emerging stem-
cell-based therapies for the treatment of enteric neuropathies35. Previous therapeutic efforts 
have focused on engrafting ENS precursors into diseased tissue36–38. Our approach focuses 
on developmental biology to engineer PSC-derived tissue with functional ENS39, which is 
suited for generating functional intestinal tissue that could be transplanted into patients with 
short bowel syndrome. Both approaches highlight the promise of stem-cell-based therapies 
for the treatment of a variety of GI diseases and how this field has advanced in recent years.

 Online Methods
Animals and human tissue
Immune-deficient NOD-SCID IL-2Rγnull (NSG) male and female mice, 8-16 weeks old, 
were used in all experiments (obtained from the Comprehensive Mouse and Cancer Core 
Facility). All mice were housed in the animal facility at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital 
Medical Center (CCHMC). All experiments were performed with the approval of the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of CCHMC (IACUC2016-0014).
The study using human tissues was approved by an Institutional Review Board 
(IRB2014-0427) at CCHMC. Informed consent for the collection and use of tissues was 
obtained from all donors, parents or legal guardians. Healthy human tissues were obtained 
from jejunum.
Cell lines and culture conditions
Human ES cells, H1 (WA-01) and H9 (WA-09) were from WiCell, and all human iPS cells 
WTC11 AAVS1-CAG-GCaMP6f WTC10 PHOX2B WT (+/+), WTC10 PHOX2B het (+/
Y14X) and WTC10 PHOX2B null (Y14X/Y14X) were from B.R.C.'s lab. All PSCs were 
maintained in an undifferentiated state on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) without feeders. The 
PHOX2B mutant lines used to generate the mutant NCCs were generated from a single iPS 
line (WTC10) derived from a healthy patient. The mutation was generated using a pair of 
transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) targeted at the PHOX2B mutation 
site and a 60-bp oligonucleotide donor containing the C→A that results in the Y14X 
mutation. The mutant cells were selected for using droplet digital PCR designed to detect 
and distinguish a mutant from a wild-type allele. For more complete details about the 
modification of the PHOX2B allele, refer to ref. 40. H9-GAPDH-GFP hESCs were 
generated by targeting sequences encoding GFP to the 3′ UTR of the GAPDH gene by 
using standard procedures41 that incorporated TALEN-facilitated homologous 
recombination42. GFP is expressed as T2A (ref. 43) pseudofusion protein immediately 
adjoining the C-terminus of GAPDH. H1 and H9 ESC lines were analyzed for pluripotency 
karyotype and the absence of mycoplasma contamination by the CCHMC Pluripotent Stem 
Cell Facility. WTC iPSC lines were analyzed for karyotype by Cell Line Genetics, and the 
top ten potential off-target sites were sequenced.
Cells were fed mTeSR1 media and routinely passaged using Dispase II (Gibco). We slightly 
modified previously published protocols to generate NCCs12 and HIOs9,10, and combined 
them at an early stage of intestinal differentiation to generate HIOs containing ENS 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Briefly, for NCC generation human PSCs were treated with 
collagenase IV (500 U/ml) in mTeSR1 for 60 min to detach colonies. Cells were washed to 
remove collagenase, then gently triturated and resuspended in neural induction media12 on 
non-TC-treated petri dishes. Neural induction media was changed daily, and retinoic acid (2 
μM) was added on days 4 and 5 for posteriorization. Day-6 free-floating neurospheres were 
plated on fibronectin (3 μg/cm2) and fed neural induction media without RA for 4 d. 
Migrated cells were collected using a brief Accutase treatment (2-3 min) and passaged onto 
fibronectin or used immediately for combining with HIOs. NCCs were differentiated

 essentially as described for neuroglial12 and mesenchymal lineages44. We generated HIOs in 
a similar manner to our previous protocols9,10, but most notably, used small molecule 
CHIR99021 in place of WNT3A. After the formation of gut tube spheroids, we centrifuged 
spheroids ± 20,000–50,000 NCCs for 3 minutes at 300g and embedded them in Matrigel. 
Cultures were fed a basic gut media (advanced DMEM/F12, 1× B27 supplement, 1× N2 
supplement, 10 μM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× Pen-Strep) supplemented with 100 ng 
EGF ml−1 and maintained in vitro for up to 8 weeks.
In vivo transplantation and electrical-field stimulation of HIOs
HIOs and HIOs+ENS were ectopically transplanted into the kidney capsule of NSG mice 
following a previously developed protocol11. Briefly, 4-6-week-old HIOs were embedded in 
collagen and transplanted into the kidney subcapsular space. Engrafted HIOs were harvested 
6-10 weeks after transplantation and analyzed for neural and glial markers, or used for 
electrical-field stimulation (EFS) experiments and isometric-force organ-bath chambers. For 
EFS, HIOs and HIOs+ENS were explanted into Tyrode's solution and equilibrated for 
approximately 5 min before stimulation was begun. Electric stimulation was applied using a 
Grass S88 Stimulator (Grass Technologies) with single pulse, 1-ms duration and 50- or 100-
V settings. HIO and HIOs+ENS were then incubated for 5 min in 10 μM TTX diluted in 
Tyrode's, rinsed and placed back in fresh Tyrode's. EFS was then repeated. Videos were 
recorded on a Leica dissection microscope using Leica Application Suite software and 
processed with VideoLAN and Handbrake to achieve 16× play speed. Videos were analyzed 
using the video-analysis software Tracker version 4.91 (Douglas Brown). Automated point 
tracking with position was performed to measure the movement within explanted HIOs and 
HIOs+ENS during EFS.
Chick-embryo manipulation
Chicken eggs were purchased from Charles River and incubated at 39 °C until they reached 
the desired Hamburger and Hamilton stage. For chicken NCC cultures, dorsal neural tubes 
from cranial or trunk regions of HH8 embryos were dissected using a Gastromaster and 
cultured on matrigel-coated tissue culture dishes with NCC culture medium12 for 24 h. The 
neural ectoderm was scrapped off the plates with a tungsten needle after NCCs migrated out 
from the neural tube explants. The NCCs that remained on the plates were then treated with 
4 ng/ml FGF4 or 2 μM RA for 48 h. For NCCs injection, GFP-labeled human PSC-derived 
NCCs were collected and injected intersomitically into HH10-12 chicken embryos. The 
embryos were harvested around HH23 for analysis.
Directed differentiation of human neural crest cells
For neuroglial differentiation, NCCs were grown to confluency in neural induction media 
and then switched to growth factor reduced media (1:1 ratio of DMEM/F12-GlutaMAX and 
Neurobasal media, 0.5× B27 supplement, 0.5× N2 supplement, 1× pen-strep). Media was 
changed every other day and cells were cultured for 2-3 weeks before assaying for 
neuroglial markers. For osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiations, NCCs were first 
differentiated into neural crest–mesenchymal precursor cells (NCMP cells) by plating NCCs 
on uncoated tissue culture plates at 60,000 cells cm-2. Cells were fed a mesenchymal stem 
cell (MSC) media every 2–3 d (DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× pen-strep)

 and passaged using TrypLE Select (Gibco) every 4–6 d before cells reached confluency. 
After 10-14 d in MSC media, cells were harvested and used for mesenchymal 
differentiations. For osteogenic differentiation, NCMPs were plated on uncoated tissue 
culture dishes at 5,000 cells cm-2 and cultured 3-4 weeks with osteogenic media (DMEM/
F12, 10% FBS, 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 200 μM ascorbic 
acid). Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, washed with dH2O, and stained with 2% 
(w/v) Alizarin red solution, pH 4.2 for 2–3 min at 23 °C. Cultures were washed with dH2O 
and imaged on a Leica DM IL LED Inverted Microscope (Type 11090137001). For 
chondrogenic differentiation, micromass cultures were generated by harvesting NCMPs and 
spotting 200,000 cells in 10 μl chondrogenic media (DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, 200 μM 
ascorbic acid, 10 ng ml−1 TGFβ-III) onto uncoated tissue culture dishes. Spots were 
incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before gently adding additional chondrogenic media 
to fill the well. Micromass cultures were fed fresh chondrogenic media every 2 d and 
maintained in culture for 4 weeks before assaying for chondrogenic differentiation. Cultures 
were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, washed with PBS, rinsed once with 0.1 N HCl, and 
stained with a 1% Alcian blue solution, prepared in 0.1 N HCl for 30 min at 23 °C. Cultures 
were imaged on a Leica S8APO stereomicroscope with Leica TL BFDF
Immunohistochemistry and microscopy
NCCs, cell monolayers, and day 0 spheroids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 
23 °C for 15 min, washed and then stained directly. Four-week-old in vitro HIOs and in vivo 
transplants were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 1 h to overnight. Tissues were processed and 
embedded in paraffin or OCT, sectioned at 5 and 10 μm, respectively, and affixed to 
Superfrost Plus slides (Fisherbrand). Parraffin sections were hydrated and underwent heat-
induced epitope retrieval. Sections and cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X100 
for 10 min and then blocked with 5% normal donkey serum (NS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) 
in PBS for 30 min at 23 °C. Primary antibodies diluted in PBS were applied to slides and 
cells overnight at 4 °C, followed by washes and incubation with secondary antibodies at 
23 °C for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C (see Supplementary Table 1 for antibodies and dilutions). 
For double colorimetric staining, the ABC vectastain system (Vector Laboratories) was used 
for signal amplification. For signal detection, Vector Red and diaminobenzidine substrate 
kits were used (Vector Laboratories). Lillie-Mayer's modified hematoxylin was used as 
nuclear counterstain (Dako). Slides were mounted using Fluoromount-G or Cytoseal 60 and 
images were obtained using a Zeiss ApoTome Imager Z1 or Zeiss LSM510 confocal 
microscope. Whole-mount 3D images were obtained by fixing tissues in 4% PFA overnight 
at 4 °C then equilibrating in 100% methanol for 1 h on ice. Tissues were permeabilized with 
Dent's bleach (4:1:1 MeOH: DMSO: 30% H2O2) for 2 h at 21–23 °C before rehydrating 
with PBS. Tissues were then blocked with 5% NDS in PBS for 2 h at 21–23 °C, incubated 
with primary antibodies in PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed and incubated with secondary 
antibodies in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies are routinely tested for 
background using a minus primary antibody control. Following staining, tissues were 
dehydrated through a methanol series and cleared with Murray's Clear (2:1 Benzyl benzoate: 
Benzyl alcohol) before imaging on a Nikon A1 inverted confocal microscope. Images were 
processed using NIS Elements, Bitplane Imaris, Zeiss Axiovision, and Adobe Photoshop 
CS7 software.

 RNA isolation, quantitative real-time PCR and RNA-Seq
Total RNA from cells and organoids was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA isolation Kit 
(Macherey-Nagel). Complementary DNA was generated immediately following RNA 
isolation using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Both isolation and 
synthesis were carried out according to the manufacturers' protocols. We performed qPCR 
using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) on a BioRad CFX96 Real-Time PCR 
Detection System. Primer sequences were generally obtained from qPrimerDepot (http://
primerdepot.nci.nih.gov) and can be found in Supplementary Table 2.
Whole-transcriptome (RNA) sequencing was performed at the CCHMC DNA Sequencing 
and Genotyping Core. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA 
preparation kit and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 with single-end 75-bp, 30 
million reads (Illumina). Following removal of primers and barcodes, RNA-seq analysis was 
performed entirely in Strand NGS software (Agilent Technologies). The samples were 
aligned against the GRCh37 genome model. Multiply-mapping reads were removed, and 
aligned reads were filtered on base quality, with a quality threshold ≥30 and zero ‘Ns’ 
allowed in each read. The aligned gene read counts were quantified and used to compute 
reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKMs) for each transcript in each sample. Raw 
counts were normalized using the DESeq algorithm, thresholded to 1 and baselined to the 
median of all samples.
Expression values were compared between samples and assessed for statistical significance 
using an ANOVA with Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery at a threshold of P < 0.05 and a 
2.0-fold cut-off filter, requiring a threefold differential. Heat maps of the relative expression 
of differentially regulated genes were generated, clustering on both gene and condition, 
using the Euclidean distance metric and average linkage rule. A Spearman correlation matrix 
was performed on differentially regulated genes to determine the sample cluster patterns on 
the basis of gene expression. Ontology analysis and biological network were performed 
using ToppGene Suite45 and ReVIGO46.

GCamP6f calcium imaging
Detection of calcium transients was performed using WTC11 AAVS1-CAG-GCaMP6f 
reporter line. HIOs+ENS grown in vivo or in vitro were cultured on 8-well Ibidi micro-slide 
(ibiTreat plates, Ibidi, Klopferspitz) 24 h prior imaging. They were then imaged every 
minute for 20 min using 10× objective on a Nikon Eclipse Ti with NIS elements software to 
obtain background fluorescence level. HIOs+ENS were then treated with 30 mM KCl. 
Fluorescence values were reported as ΔF/F0, (ΔF = Ft − F0) where Ft is observed 
fluorescence at time t and F0 is fluorescence at t = 0. Experiments were carried out at 21–
23 °C.

 Ex vivo intestinal motility
Engrafted HIOs and HIOs+ENS were harvested and placed in ice-cold HBSS. Muscle strips 
(4-6 mm in length and 1-2 mm in width) were cut from the engrafted HIOs and HIOs+ENS. 
Preparations were suspended vertically in an organ bath filled with Krebs solution (NaCl, 
117 mM; KCl, 4.7 mM; MgCl2, 1.2mM; NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM; NaHCO3, 25 mM; CaCl2, 2.5 
mM and glucose, 11 mM), warmed at 37 °C and gassed with 95% O2 + 5% CO2. After an 
equilibration period of 60 min at initial tension of 0.5g, the contractile response of the 
muscle was continuously recorded, using eight-chamber tissue-organ bath with isometric-
force transducers (0-25g; AD Instruments) coupled to a computer equipped with LabChart 
Pro software (AD Instruments). Muscle preparations were stimulated with 
dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP; 10 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) and veratridine (3 μM; 
Sigma-Aldrich). Chemical stimulations were applied at 15-min intervals followed by three 
washes. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; 10 μM; Tocris) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 
50 μM; Sigma) was applied 5 min before DMPP stimulation. NOS was inhibited with 
sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 100 μM; Sigma-Aldrich). Methylene blue (50 μM) was used to 
inhibit ICC activity. The effects of chemical stimulation on tension were evaluated by 
measuring the area under the curve (AUC). Data are expressed in ΔAUC i.e., “stimulated” 
AUC measured 120 s after stimulation minus “control” AUC measured 120 s before 
stimulation.
Statistical analyses
All data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. t tests and Mann-Whitney tests were completed 
using Prism (GraphPad). The determined significance cutoff was P < 0.05. No statistical 
method was used to predetermine sample size. The investigators were not blinded to 
allocation during experiments and outcome assessment except for the proliferation counting. 
No randomization was made.

Live imaging of neural activity in HIOs+ENS. (a) Live imaging of Ca2+ flux in the neural-
crest-derived ENS cells revealed periodic activity. Shown are snapshots from a 20-min time-
lapse video (see Supplementary Video 3) of neural activity in HIOs+ENS. Colored arrows 
point to cells whose pixel intensity was measured over time. Numbers in snapshots 
correspond to numbered peaks in the graph. The graph measures fluorescence values as 
ΔF/F0, (ΔF = Ft – F0), where Ft is observed fluorescence at time t and F0 is fluorescence at t 
= 0. The color of the line corresponds to the same colored arrowhead in the snapshots. Scale 
bars, 50 μm. (b) Live imaging of Ca2+ flux in HIOs+ENS grown in vitro before (left) and

Supplementary Video 4). Data are representative of two independent experiments. Scale 
bars, 100 μm. (c) Live imaging of Ca2+ flux in HIOs+ENS grown in vivo shows calcium 
transients in nerve bundles before and after KCl treatment, which induces a broad calcium 
efflux and contraction of the tissue (see Supplementary Videos 5 and 6). In vivo data are 
representative of two independent experiments with n = 3 organoids engrafted into 
individual mice per experiment. Scale bars, 100 μm (left) and 500 μm (right).

ENS-independent and dependent control of contractile activity. (a) The ENS in HIOs 
mediates peristaltic-like contractions (see Supplementary Videos 7–9). In vivo grown tissues 
were explanted and subjected to EFS. HIOs without ENS subjected to high-voltage EFS (1-
ms pulse at 100 V) showed one contraction (left, n = 2). HIOs+ENS subjected to low-
voltage EFS (1-ms pulse at 50 V) showed a sustained series of wave-like contractions 
(middle, n = 5) that were lost when tissues were cultured in TTX (TTX-treated HIOs+ENS, 
right; n = 2). Automated point tracking demonstrated a differential movement in HIOs+ENS,

of spontaneous contractions in transplanted HIO and HIO+ENS tissue strips. Phasic 
contractions were observed after tissue equilibration (no stimulation), suggestive of ICCs in 
both HIO (n = 7) and HIO+ENS (n = 7) tissues. (c) Inhibition of ICC activity with 
methylene blue led to loss of contractile activity (n = 3). (d) Detection of ICCs (CD117, red) 
in both HIOs and HIOs+ENS in vivo. HIOs without NCCs did not form neurons (TUBB3, 
green). Scale bars, 100 μm. (e) DMPP stimulation in HIOs and HIOs+ENS. Right, area 
under the curve (AUC) during DMPP (10 μM) stimulation measured for 2 min before and 
after stimulation (n = 7). (f) TTX inhibition of ENS activation. DMPP stimulation measured 
for 2 min, followed by TTX (10 μM) treatment of HIOs+ENS (n = 7). (g) NOS+ neurons 
were present in HIOs+ENS grown in vivo. Scale bars, 100 μm. (h) ENS-induced relaxation 
by a NO-dependent mechanism. Shown is the AUC during DMPP stimulation measured for 
2 min, followed by L-NAME treatment of HIOs+ENS (n = 7). For box and whisker plots, 
the black line across the box represents the median, the box represents interquartile range 
and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Mann–
