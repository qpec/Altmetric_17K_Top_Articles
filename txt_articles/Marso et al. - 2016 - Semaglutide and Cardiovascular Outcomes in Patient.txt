BACKGROUND
Regulatory guidance specifies the need to establish cardiovascular safety of new dia-
betes therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes in order to rule out excess cardiovascu-
lar risk. The cardiovascular effects of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue 
with an extended half-life of approximately 1 week, in type 2 diabetes are unknown.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 3297 patients with type 2 diabetes who were on a standard-
care regimen to receive once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) or placebo for 
104 weeks. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of cardiovascu-
lar death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. We hypothesized that 
semaglutide would be noninferior to placebo for the primary outcome. The non-
inferiority margin was 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of 
the hazard ratio.
RESULTS
At baseline, 2735 of the patients (83.0%) had established cardiovascular disease, 
chronic kidney disease, or both. The primary outcome occurred in 108 of 1648 patients 
(6.6%) in the semaglutide group and in 146 of 1649 patients (8.9%) in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95; P<0.001 for non-
inferiority). Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 2.9% of the patients receiving 
semaglutide and in 3.9% of those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 
to 1.08; P 
= 
0.12); nonfatal stroke occurred in 1.6% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 
0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04). Rates of death from cardiovascular causes were 
similar in the two groups. Rates of new or worsening nephropathy were lower in the 
semaglutide group, but rates of retinopathy complications (vitreous hemorrhage, blind-
ness, or conditions requiring treatment with an intravitreal agent or photocoagulation) 
were significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.78; P 
= 
0.02). Fewer seri-
ous adverse events occurred in the semaglutide group, although more patients discon-
tinued treatment because of adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high cardiovascular risk, the rate of 
cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke was signifi-
cantly lower among patients receiving semaglutide than among those receiving pla-
cebo, an outcome that confirmed the noninferiority of semaglutide. (Funded by Novo 
Nordisk; SUSTAIN-6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01720446.)

Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
C
ardiovascular disease is the lead-
ing cause of death and complications in 
patients with type 2 diabetes.1 Recently, 
trials evaluating a sodium–glucose cotransporter 
2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) and a glucagon-like 
peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue (liraglutide) have 
shown improved cardiovascular outcomes in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk 
for cardiovascular events.2,3
Semaglutide, a GLP-1 analogue with an ex-
tended half-life of approximately 1 week (which 
permits once-weekly subcutaneous administra-
tion),4 is currently in development but not yet 
approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
Regulatory guidance specifies the need to estab-
lish the cardiovascular safety of new therapies 
for type 2 diabetes in order to rule out excess 
cardiovascular risk.5 The preapproval Trial to 
Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term 
Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with 
Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6) was designed to 
assess the noninferiority of semaglutide as com-
pared with placebo in terms of cardiovascular 
safety in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We performed a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial at 230 sites 
in 20 countries. The trial protocol, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was ap-
proved by the institutional review board and 
ethics committee at each participating center. 
All patients provided written informed consent.
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
receive either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg of once-weekly 
subcutaneous semaglutide or volume-matched 
placebo, which maintained blinding within dose. 
The trial consisted of a planned observation 
period of 109 weeks for all patients (a 104-week 
treatment period with a 5-week follow-up period) 
in which patients who had prematurely discon-
tinued a study treatment were also included.
The sponsor, Novo Nordisk, designed the 
study. Data were gathered by the site investiga-
tors, and the sponsor performed site monitoring, 
data collection, and data analysis. An indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring committee per-
formed ongoing surveillance and had access to 
all the data in an unblinded fashion.
All the authors had confidential access to the 
final trial results and actively contributed to 
manuscript preparation. A working group that 
included the first and last authors wrote the first 
draft of the manuscript, which was revised and 
approved by all the authors, who made the deci-
sion to submit the manuscript for publication. 
The authors assume responsibility for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and vouch for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Editorial 
support was funded by the sponsor and provided 
by independent medical writers under the guid-
ance of the authors.
Patients
Patients with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemo-
globin level of 7% or more were eligible if they 
had not been treated with an antihyperglycemic 
drug or had been treated with no more than two 
oral antihyperglycemic agents, with or without 
basal or premixed insulin. Key inclusion criteria 
were an age of 50 years or more with established 
cardiovascular disease (previous cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), 
chronic heart failure (New York Heart Associa-
tion class II or III), or chronic kidney disease of 
stage 3 or higher or an age of 60 years or more 
with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (as 
defined in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org).
Key exclusion criteria included treatment with 
a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days 
before screening or with a GLP-1–receptor ago-
nist or insulin other than basal or premixed 
within 90 days before screening; a history of an 
acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 
90 days before randomization; planned revascu-
larization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral 
artery; or long-term dialysis. (A complete list of 
exclusion criteria is provided in Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Procedures
The randomization of patients was stratified ac-
cording to cardiovascular disease status (estab-
lished cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease 
or cardiovascular risk factors only), insulin treat-
ment (none, basal insulin only, or premixed in-
sulin), and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(≤30 ml or >30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of 
body-surface area) at screening. A fixed dose-
escalation procedure was used, with a starting 
dose of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks that escalated to 
0.5 mg for 4 weeks until the maintenance dose 
(0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) was reached. No change in

the maintenance dose of either semaglutide or 
placebo was permitted during the treatment 
period.
Patients were scheduled for quarterly site visits 
during the trial. All investigators were encour-
aged to treat all the patients according to local 
guidelines to achieve the most effective glycemic 
control (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix), and additional noninvestigational antihyper-
glycemic medication (nonincretin-based therapy) 
could be added or adjusted.
Outcomes
The primary composite outcome was the first 
occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction (including silent), 
or nonfatal stroke. Prespecified secondary out-
comes included the first occurrence of an ex-
panded composite cardiovascular outcome (death 
from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization 
[coronary or peripheral], and hospitalization for 
unstable angina or heart failure), an additional 
composite outcome (death from all causes, non-
fatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), 
the individual components of the composite out-
comes, retinopathy complications, and new or 
worsening nephropathy. Each outcome, except 
for peripheral revascularization, was adjudicated 
in a blinded fashion by an external, independent 
event-adjudication committee.
Continuous efficacy and safety outcomes were 
assessed as the change from baseline to week 
104. From baseline to week 109, we assessed 
serious and nonserious adverse events and hypo-
glycemic episodes, which were defined as severe 
(according to American Diabetes Association 
criteria6) or as confirmed on analysis of plasma 
glucose (with symptomatic hypoglycemia defined 
as <56 mg per deciliter [3.1 mmol per liter]). 
Neoplasm and pancreatitis events were adjudi-
cated. (All definitions of adjudicated events are 
provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
Statistical Analysis
The prespecified statistical analysis plan is avail-
able with the protocol at NEJM.org. We based 
the sample size for the trial on an assumed an-
nual primary-event rate of 1.98% in each group, 
a dropout rate of less than 10.0%, a mean in-trial 
observation time of 2.1 years, and a true hazard 
ratio of 1.00. We determined that the enrollment 
of 3260 patients would be required to determine 
the primary outcome in at least 122 patients and 
provide a power of 90% to reject a hazard ratio 
of at least 1.80 at the 0.05 level of significance.
The prespecified analysis for the primary out-
come was a Cox proportional-hazards model, with 
pooled treatment (semaglutide vs. placebo) as a 
fixed factor, and categorized according to all 
possible combinations of stratification factors 
used for randomization. The primary hypothesis 
was for noninferiority for the primary outcome. 
Such noninferiority was confirmed if the upper 
boundary of the two-sided 95% confidence inter-
val of the hazard ratio was below the noninferior-
ity margin of 1.80.5 Testing for superiority for the 
primary outcome was not prespecified or adjusted 
for multiplicity. We conducted prespecified sen-
sitivity analyses of the primary outcome, using 
alternative patient selection and data-censoring 
strategies for exposure to treatment, and per-
protocol sensitivity analyses were performed post 
hoc. (Details regarding analysis sets are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix.)
The primary outcome was evaluated in sub-
groups according to demographic and disease 
measures at baseline. We evaluated the effect of 
dose on the primary outcome by repeating the 
primary analysis with the four treatment groups 
(semaglutide doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg and 
corresponding placebo doses) using volume-
matched treatment comparisons. Efficacy and 
safety outcome analyses were prespecified to 
include the four treatment groups.
All P values are two-sided, with a level of 0.05 
considered to indicate statistical significance. 
P values other than that for the primary hypoth-
esis have not been adjusted for multiplicity and 
have been calculated to test for null hypotheses 
of no difference. All results were analyzed on an 
intention-to-treat basis that included the full 
analysis set (i.e., all patients who underwent 
randomization according to the planned treat-
ment), with the exception of adverse events lead-
ing to premature discontinuation, which were 
included in the as-treated safety analysis.

Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
underwent randomization; of these patients, 3232 
(98.0%) attended the last follow-up visit at an 
investigator site, were contacted by telephone, or 
died during the trial. The date of the last patient 
visit was March 15, 2016. Vital status was known 
for 99.6% of the patients by the end of the trial 
(Figs. S1A and S1B in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The median observation time was 2.1 years. 
Rates of premature treatment discontinuation 
were similar across groups (20% overall) (Table 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean 
percentage of time during which patients re-
ceived semaglutide was 86.5% (87.7% among 
those receiving 0.5 mg and 85.3% among those 
receiving 1.0 mg), and the mean percentage dur-
ing which patients received placebo was 89.5% 
(89.4% among those receiving 0.5 mg and 89.6% 
among those receiving 1.0 mg).
Demographic and clinical characteristics of 
the patients at baseline were similar across treat-
ment groups (Table 1, and Table S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Of the 3297 patients, 2735 
(83.0%) had established cardiovascular disease 
(including chronic kidney disease of stage 3 or 
higher), 1940 patients (58.8%) had established 
cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney dis-
ease, 353 (10.7%) had chronic kidney disease only, 
and 442 (13.4%) had both cardiovascular disease 
and kidney disease; 17% of the patients had car-
diovascular risk factors and were 60 years of age 
or older. The overall mean duration of type 2 
diabetes was 13.9 years, and the mean glycated 
hemoglobin level was 8.7%. The use of anti-
hyperglycemic and cardiovascular medications 
was well balanced between the groups (Tables 
S7A and S8A in the Supplementary Appendix).

sive medication, including angiotensin-convert-
ing–enzyme inhibitors (49.8%) and angiotensin- 
receptor blockers (33.7%); 76.5% were receiving 
lipid-lowering medications; and 76.3% were re-
ceiving antithrombotic medications, including 
acetylsalicylic acid (63.9%) and adenosine diphos-
phate receptor inhibitors (21.1%) (Table S8A in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Cardiovascular Outcomes
The composite primary outcome occurred in 108 
of 1648 patients (6.6%) in the semaglutide group 
and 146 of 1649 (8.9%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.58 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P 
= 
0.02 
for superiority) (Fig. 1A). Sensitivity analyses sup-
ported the findings from the primary analysis 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Nonfa-
tal myocardial infarction occurred in 47 patients 
(2.9%) in the semaglutide group and 64 (3.9%) 
in the placebo group, a difference that was not 
significant (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 to 
1.08; P 
= 
0.12) (Fig. 1B). Nonfatal stroke occurred 
in 27 patients (1.6%) in the semaglutide group 
and 44 (2.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 
0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 1C). The 
risk of cardiovascular death was similar in the 
two groups, with deaths reported in 44 patients 
(2.7%) in the semaglutide group and 46 (2.8%) 
in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 
0.65 to 1.48; P 
= 
0.92) (Fig. 1D).
No significant treatment interactions were 
identified for any subgroups (Fig. S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Similar risk reductions for 
the primary outcome and its components were 
observed for both doses of semaglutide (Fig. S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Cardiovascular 
outcomes are provided in Table 2, and in Table 
S9 in the Supplementary Appendix. Throughout 
the trial, a greater proportion of patients in the 
placebo group than in the semaglutide group 
received additional cardiovascular medications, 
including antihypertensive agents, diuretics, and 
lipid-lowering medications (Table S8B in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Glycemic Control
At week 104, among patients receiving sema-
glutide, the mean glycated hemoglobin level de-
creased from 8.7% at baseline to 7.6% in the 
group receiving 0.5 mg and to 7.3% in the group 
receiving 1.0 mg, for changes of −1.1% and 
−1.4%, respectively; in the placebo group, the 
mean level decreased to 8.3% in the two dose 
groups, for a reduction of 0.4% in each group. 
Thus, the mean glycated hemoglobin level in the 
semaglutide group, as compared with the pla-
cebo group, was 0.7 percentage points lower in 
the group receiving 0.5 mg and 1.0 percentage 
point lower in the group receiving 1.0 mg (esti-
mated treatment difference) (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) (Fig. 2A, and Table S10 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). During the trial, signifi-
cantly more patients in the placebo group than 
in the semaglutide group received additional anti-
hyperglycemic agents, including insulin, which 
was initiated more than twice as frequently in 
the placebo group (Table S7B in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Body Weight
At week 104, among patients receiving sema-
glutide, the mean body weight decreased from 
92.1 kg at baseline to 88.5 kg in the group re-
ceiving 0.5 mg and to 87.2 kg in the group receiv-
ing 1.0 mg, for changes of −3.6 kg and −4.9 kg, 
respectively; in the placebo group, the mean body 
weight decreased to 91.4 kg and 91.6 kg, for 
changes of −0.7 kg and −0.5 kg, respectively. 
Thus, the mean body weight in the semaglutide 
group, as compared with the placebo group, 
was 2.9 kg lower in the group receiving 0.5 mg 
and 4.3 kg lower in the group receiving 1.0 mg 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig. 2B, and 
Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Microvascular Outcomes
Diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in 
50 patients (3.0%) in the semaglutide group and 
29 (1.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 
1.76; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.78; P 
= 
0.02) (Table 2, and 
Table S9 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The treatment difference between groups 
was first seen very early in the trial. The num-
bers of patients who required retinal photocoagu-
lation were 38 (2.3%) in the semaglutide group 
versus 20 (1.2%) in the placebo group, the num-
bers of those who required the use of an intra-
vitreal agent were 16 (1.0%) versus 13 (0.8%), the 
numbers of those who had a vitreous hemor-
rhage were 16 (1.0%) versus 7 (0.4%), and the 
numbers of those who had an onset of diabetes-
related blindness were 5 (0.3%) versus 1 (0.1%)

Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
Figure 1. Cardiovascular Outcomes.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier plots of the primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) (Panel A), nonfatal myocardial in-
farction (Panel B), nonfatal stroke (Panel C), and death from cardiovascular causes (Panel D). The trial included a planned observation period of 109 weeks for all patients (a 104-
week treatment period with a 5-week follow-up period). In Panel C, there were no events in the semaglutide group after week 104. Insets show the same data on an expanded y 
axis.

the 79 patients with retinopathy complications, 
66 (83.5%) had preexisting retinopathy at base-
line (42 of 50 [84.0%] in the semaglutide group 
and 24 of 29 [82.8%] in the placebo group). New 
or worsening nephropathy occurred in 62 pa-
tients (3.8%) in the semaglutide group and 100 
(6.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 
95% CI, 0.46 to 0.88; P 
= 
0.005) (Table 2, and 
Table S9 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Other Outcomes
At week 104, among patients receiving semaglutide, 
the mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 
135.6 mm Hg at baseline to 132.2 mm Hg among 
those receiving 0.5 mg and to 130.3 mm Hg 
among those receiving 1.0 mg, for reductions of 
3.4 mm Hg and 5.4 mm Hg, respectively; in the 
placebo group, the mean systolic blood pressure 
decreased to 133.5 mm Hg and 132.8 mm Hg, 
for reductions of 2.2 mm Hg and 2.8 mm Hg, 
respectively. Thus, the mean systolic blood pres-
sure in the semaglutide group, as compared with 
the placebo group, was 1.3 mm Hg lower in the 
group receiving 0.5 mg (P 
= 
0.10) and 2.6 mm Hg 
lower in the group receiving 1.0 mg (P<0.001) 
(Table S10 and Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
At week 104, among patients in the semaglu-
tide group, the mean pulse rate increased from 
a baseline value of 72.0 bpm by 2.1 bpm among 
those receiving 0.5 mg and by 2.4 bpm among

The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal 
stroke.
‡  
The expanded composite outcome included death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revasculariza-
tion (coronary or peripheral), and hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure.
§  
Retinopathy complications include vitreous hemorrhage, onset of diabetes-related blindness, and the need for treatment with an intravitreal 
agent or retinal photocoagulation.
¶  
New or worsening nephropathy includes persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level and a creatinine 
clearance of less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area (according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease criteria), 
or the need for continuous renal-replacement therapy.

Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
those receiving 1.0 mg; in the placebo group, the 
corresponding changes were an increase of 0.1 
bpm and a decrease of 0.1 bpm. Thus, the mean 
pulse rate in the semaglutide group, as compared 
with the placebo group, was 2.0 bpm higher in 
the group receiving 0.5 mg and 2.5 bpm higher 
in the group receiving 1.0 mg (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons). Changes in diastolic blood pres-
sure were similar in the treatment groups. Lipid 
measurements are provided in Table S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Safety
Gastrointestinal disorders were more frequent 
in the semaglutide group than in the placebo 
group (Table 3, and Table S11 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The majority of gastrointestinal 
events were mild or moderate in severity and 
occurred during the first 30 weeks. Treatment 
discontinuation because of adverse events (main-
ly gastrointestinal) was more frequent in the 
semaglutide group than in the placebo group. 
The frequency and rate of serious adverse events, 
including serious cardiac disorders, were lower 
in the semaglutide group than in the placebo 
group (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Acute pancreatitis occurred in 9 patients in 
the semaglutide group and in 12 in the placebo 
group; all events were mild, according to the re-
vised Atlanta criteria.7 Lipase and amylase levels 
were significantly higher in the semaglutide 
group than in the placebo group (Fig. S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Gallbladder disorders 
occurred in 58 patients in the semaglutide group 
and 61 in the placebo group. The rates of malig-
nant neoplasms, which were similar in the two 
groups, were higher in the semaglutide group 
receiving 1.0 mg and lower in the group receiv-
ing 0.5 mg than in the placebo groups (Table 3, 
and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Pancreatic cancer occurred in 1 patient receiving 
1.0 mg of semaglutide and in 4 patients receiv-
ing placebo. No medullary thyroid carcinomas 
were confirmed by the event-adjudication com-
mittee in either treatment group. Antibodies 
against semaglutide were detected in 30 patients 
treated with semaglutide, with the greatest num-
ber of patients (14) testing positive at week 44. 
In the majority of patients, antibody formation 
was transient — only 4 patients tested positive 
during follow-up — and antibody titers were 
generally low.
Similar numbers and occurrence rates of se-
vere hypoglycemic episodes or hypoglycemia as 
confirmed on plasma glucose testing were seen 
with semaglutide doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg 
(191 [23.1%] and 178 [21.7%], respectively), as 
compared with placebo doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg 
(177 [21.5%] and 173 [21.0%]).
Discussion
In this cardiovascular outcomes trial, we con-
firmed our primary hypothesis that semaglutide 
would be noninferior to placebo. Semaglutide-
treated patients had a significant 26% lower risk 
of the primary composite outcome of death from 
cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, or nonfatal stroke than did those receiving

Adverse events were selected on the basis of the safety areas of interest for GLP-1–receptor agonists. All data are based 
on investigator-reported adverse events unless otherwise specified. All data were reported during the trial, except for 
adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, which are reported on an as-treated basis. A complete list of 
 
serious adverse events according to system organ class is provided in Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix.

A serious adverse event was defined as death, a life-threatening episode, hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or substantial disability or incapacity, or an event otherwise considered to be an impor-
tant medical event.
‡  
A severe adverse event was defined as an event that considerably interferes with the patient’s daily activities and is 
unacceptable.

Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
placebo. This lower risk was principally driven 
by a significant (39%) decrease in the rate of 
nonfatal stroke and a nonsignificant (26%) de-
crease in nonfatal myocardial infarction, with 
no significant difference in the rate of cardiovas-
cular death. Similar risk reductions were observed 
with both doses of semaglutide. The number of 
patients who would need to be treated to prevent 
one event of the primary outcome over a period 
of 24 months was 45 on the basis of Kaplan–
Meier estimates.8 Most study patients were re-
ceiving cardiovascular risk management at base-
line, as shown by a high proportion of patients 
receiving antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and 
anti-platelet medications. The risk reduction for 
the primary outcome was seen despite an increase 
in pulse rate, a class effect for GLP-1–receptor 
agonists.
Semaglutide-treated patients had a lower risk 
of new or worsening nephropathy, according to 
differences in macroalbuminuria, but a higher 
risk of diabetic retinopathy complications than 
did those receiving placebo. Although the overall 
number of retinopathy events was low, there was 
an unexpected higher rate of retinopathy com-
plications (vitreous hemorrhage, blindness, or 
the need for treatment with an intravitreal agent 
or photocoagulation) in the semaglutide group. 
An association between rapid glucose lowering 
and worsening of retinopathy has been reported 
in patients with type 1 diabetes.9,10 The applica-
bility of such an association to our finding is 
unclear, and a direct effect of semaglutide can-
not be ruled out.
Semaglutide was associated with significant 
and sustained reductions in glycated hemoglo-
bin levels, as compared with placebo, with simi-
lar rates of hypoglycemia. During the trial, more 
patients in the placebo group than in the sema-
glutide group intensified their antihyperglyce-
mic treatment. However, the between-group dif-
ference in glycated hemoglobin levels remained 
after 2 years. Clinically meaningful and sustained 
weight loss and a reduction in systolic blood 
pressure occurred in the semaglutide group ver-
sus the placebo group over 2 years. The reduc-
tions in glycated hemoglobin, body weight, and 
systolic blood pressure may all have contributed 
to the observed reduction in cardiovascular risk 
with semaglutide.
With the exception of complications of reti-
nopathy, semaglutide had a safety profile similar 
to that of other GLP-1–receptor agonists. The 
rate of malignant neoplasms was similar in the 
pooled semaglutide group and the pooled pla-
cebo group, although the highest rate was ob-
served with the semaglutide dose of 1.0 mg. The 
rate of pancreatic cancer — an event of interest 
for this drug class — was lower with semaglu-
tide, and no medullary thyroid carcinomas were 
reported in this trial. Pancreatitis occurred in 
low yet similar numbers of patients in the two 
pooled groups.
To date, two antihyperglycemic agents have 
been shown to reduce the rate of cardiovascular 
events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high 
cardiovascular risk.2,3 In this trial, the risk re-
duction of the primary outcome was driven by a 
significant decrease in the rate of nonfatal stroke 
and a nonsignificant decrease in the rate of non-
fatal myocardial infarction, with no difference 
in cardiovascular death. The beneficial effect of 
semaglutide on cardiovascular outcomes may re-
late to modification of the progression of athero-
sclerosis.
This trial was powered as a noninferiority 
study to exclude a preapproval safety margin of 
1.8 set by the Food and Drug Administration. It 
was not powered to show superiority, so such 
testing was not prespecified. However, the treat-
ment effect of semaglutide and the accrual of 
more events than estimated resulted in a signifi-
cantly lower risk of the primary outcome among 
patients in the semaglutide group. Patients were 
followed for a relatively short duration (2.1 years) 
and were at high cardiovascular risk. The gener-
alizability of these findings to other populations 
and a longer duration of treatment is unknown. 
It is also unknown to what extent the greater 
glycated hemoglobin reductions in the semaglu-
tide group contributed to the results.
In conclusion, among patients with type 2 
diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, the rate of 
first occurrence of death from cardiovascular 
causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or non-
fatal stroke was significantly lower in those re-
ceiving semaglutide than in those receiving pla-
cebo, which confirmed noninferiority.
