Abstract
Background Nightmares are inherently distressing, prevent
restorative sleep, and are associated with a number of
psychiatric problems, but have rarely been the subject of
empirical study. Negative affect, linked to stressful events,
is generally considered the key trigger of nightmares;
hence nightmares have most often been considered in the
context of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However,
many individuals with heightened negative affect do not
have nightmares. The objective of this study was to iden-
tify mechanistically plausible factors, beyond negative
affect, that may explain why individuals experience
nightmares.
Method 846 participants from the UK general population
completed an online survey about nightmare occurrence
and severity (pre-occupation, distress, and impairment),
negative affect, worry, depersonalisation, hallucinatory
experiences, paranoia, alcohol use, sleep duration, physical
activity levels, PTSD symptoms, and stressful life events.
Associations of nightmares with the putative predictive
factors were tested controlling for levels of negative affect.
Analyses were also repeated controlling for levels of PTSD
and the recent occurrence of stressful life events.
Results Nightmare
occurrence,
adjusting
for
negative
affect, was associated with higher levels of worry, deper-
sonalisation, hallucinatory experiences, paranoia, and sleep
duration (odds ratios 1.25–1.45). Nightmare severity,
controlling for negative affect, was associated with higher
levels
of
worry,
depersonalisation,
hallucinatory
experiences, and paranoia (R2s: 0.33–0.39). Alcohol use
and physical activity levels were not associated with
nightmares.
Discussion The study identifies a number of potential
predictors of the occurrence and severity of nightmares.
Causal roles require testing in future longitudinal, experi-
mental, and treatment studies.

Introduction
Nightmares are highly dysphoric dreams involving intense
negative emotions which primarily present during late-
night rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [1]. About one in
20 of the general population experiences nightmares every
week [2]. In contrast, estimates of the prevalence of
nightmares are far higher for psychiatric populations. For
example, frequent nightmares occur in about three-quarters
of patients with PTSD [3], about half of patients with
borderline personality disorder [4], and at least 10% of
patients with schizophrenia [5, 6]. Nightmares are associ-
ated with increased psychological distress, self-harm, and
suicidal behaviour [4, 7, 8]. A small number of prospective
studies indicate that nightmares not only co-occur with
psychiatric disorders, but may also be early indicators of
the onset of psychotic experiences [9, 10], post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) [11] and sleep disturbances [12].
Nightmares often arise following exposure to a traumatic
event [13]; they have, therefore, most often been consid-
ered in the context of PTSD [14, 15] and are one of the core
clinical symptoms of the disorder [16]. Similarly, milder
forms of waking life stressors have also been found to

 precipitate the occurrence of nightmares [17]. For example,
research has indicated that a stressful event (e.g. exam
stress, natural disasters and death of significant other) can
be a cause of more frequent nightmares [17–19]. Negative
affect more broadly is also considered a key trigger of
nightmares [20], for example, Li et al. [2] found that mood
disorders were associated with frequent nightmares (OR
15.57, 95% CI 3.77–64.37) adjusting for a range of
potential confounders. Given, however, that many indi-
viduals can experience stressors and negative affect with-
out experiencing nightmares, our aim was to identify
factors, independent of negative affect (defined as symp-
toms of anxiety and depression), that may predict the
occurrence and severity of nightmares. In this paper, we
focus on psychological, psychiatric, and behavioural fac-
tors that could plausibly contribute to the triggering of
nightmares.
Cognitive style
Worry is a cognitive style characterised by repetitive
negative thinking about future events. It brings fearful and
sometimes implausible ideas to mind and keeps them there
[21, 22]. Whilst worry is certainly associated with negative
affect [23, 24] it may be that nightmares are not accounted
for entirely by affect alone. Instead, it is proposed that
these repetitive and negatively oriented cognitions (par-
ticularly in the pre-sleep period) feed negative dream
content, and hence increase the chances of nightmares.
This is in line with the continuity hypothesis of dreaming
that states dreams reflect waking life experiences, thereby
capturing the daytime concerns of the dreamer [25]. It is
further proposed that worry not only increases the likeli-
hood of nightmare occurrence but also exacerbates night-
mares severity by increasing the daytime preoccupation
and distress associated with nightmare experiences, thereby
increasing the impairment.
It is, therefore, plausible that a cognitive style such as
worry may be a potential causal factor in triggering
nightmares and exacerbating nightmare severity, over and
above negative affect alone.
Dissociation
Dissociative experiences such as depersonalisation are
relatively common in the general population [26]. One
theory is that dissociation arises as a psychological escape
(i.e. affect shutdown) triggered by trauma [27]. The shut-
down in affect results in a dampening of sympathetic
nervous system output and reduced emotional experienc-
ing, mediated by cognitive control mechanisms in frontal
brain areas that suppress limbic activity [28, 29]. During
REM sleep these frontal areas are relatively de-activated,
preventing regulation of the limbic system [30]. This
indicates that nightmares may reflect a rebound of sup-
pressed emotional experiences, since psychological escape
during sleep is no longer possible.
One influential theory proposes that the dreaming pro-
cess functions to accomplish fear extinction by exposing
the dreamer to the feared stimuli in a safe and an ‘ever-
changing sequence of contexts’ [14]. Nightmares, in con-
trast, would represent a failure of fear memory extinction
since the dreaming process is disrupted by awakening from
too intense emotional distress. This disruption of the
dreaming process will ultimately keep the fear memory
alive since fear memory extinction cannot be accomplished
and hence increase the likelihood of future nightmare
occurrence. It is proposed that the continued avoidance of
distressing emotional experiences throughout the day and
night will not only increase the likelihood of nightmare
occurrence
but
also
increase
nightmare
severity
by
increasing the distress. In a study of 116 people in the
general population, frequent nightmares were associated
with greater levels of dissociation, with nightmare distress
having a stronger association with dissociation than
nightmare frequency [31].
Psychotic-like experiences
There are several plausible routes by which nightmares and
psychotic experiences may be associated. First, the content
of distressing daytime psychotic experiences (i.e. paranoid
thoughts and hallucinatory experiences) may be re-expe-
rienced during dreams in line with the continuity hypoth-
esis of dreaming [32]. If dreaming about distressing
daytime experiences becomes too emotionally intense, the
dreamer will likely awaken resulting in a nightmare
occurrence. This theory is supported by a recent, case-
series of imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) for nightmares, in
which a clinical sample of individuals experiencing psy-
chosis indicated that paranoia and auditory hallucinations
reappear during nightmares [33]. Second, dreams and
hallucinations in particular are phenomenologically simi-
lar: both are characterised by vivid and sensory-rich
experiences and a lack of meta-cognitive awareness
pointing to similar brain activation patterns during both
states [e.g. 34]. Those prone to hallucinations may, there-
fore, also be particularly prone to frequent dreams and
hence at greater risk for nightmares. In addition, low levels
of attentional top-down control may result in a rapid,
uncritical acceptance of unusual experiences as real and
important. It is likely that these same processes are at play
in response to nightmare experiences and drive subsequent
appraisals. For example, rather than appraising distressing
nightmare content as ‘‘just a dream’’, they may be
appraised with a persecutory interpretation such as ‘‘the
1124
Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:1123–1133
123
 devil sending me a message’’ or other delusional frame-
work, for example ‘‘my dreams predict the future’’. Such
appraisals likely exacerbate nightmare severity (i.e. pre-
occupation, distress and impairment in functioning).
Initial research indicates a high prevalence of night-
mares in patients with current psychotic experiences [6]. In
a student sample, nightmare-related distress and frequency
were associated with levels of paranoia and hallucinatory
experiences (Spearman’s rho ranged between 0.18 and
0.21) [35] and in a large epidemiological sample, night-
mares
were
longitudinally
associated
with
psychotic
experiences (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19–2.20) [10]. However,
these previous studies have not controlled for other plau-
sible explanatory variables which may account for the
association between nightmares and psychotic experiences,
specifically negative affect, PTSD symptoms, and stressful
life events.
Behavioural patterns
As nightmares appear during late-night REM sleep, factors
influencing this specific sleep stage might increase or
decrease the opportunity for nightmares to occur. We high-
light three behavioural patterns: alcohol, daytime activity,
and sleep duration.Ethanol increases light sleep and amounts
of late-night REM sleep [36–38]. Mechanistically, there is
evidence that ethanol-induced REM sleep suppression dur-
ing the first half of the sleep period causes REM sleep
rebound in the second half of the night [39] and therefore,
longer and more vivid dreams [40] increase the opportunity
for nightmares. Greater amounts of daytime activities, par-
ticularly physical exercise, might protect against nightmare
occurrence by decreasing the amount of total REM sleep
[41], whereas poor physical activity might be associated with
more frequent nightmares [38]. Preliminary evidence sug-
gests that nightmares occur more frequently with high or low
sleep duration [38]. More frequent nightmares were
observed among people who slept more than 9 h or less than
7 h per night compared to those who slept 7–9 h. The effect
sizes of these associations, however, were small (v2,
p \ 0.001; Cramer V, 0.07) and require replication. Mech-
anistically, a greater length of sleep might increase the
amount of late-night REM sleep, thereby increasing the
opportunity for nightmares. In contrast, insufficient amount
of sleep might be related to physiological hyperarousal,
lowering the threshold for awakening.
The current study
This study aimed to investigate factors associated with
nightmare occurrence and severity beyond levels of negative
affect. Our primary hypothesis was that factors associated
with nightmares would be; worry; depersonalisation; hallu-
cinatory experiences; paranoia; and certain behavioural pat-
terns (alcohol use, longer and shorter sleep duration, activity
levels). The strength of each of these associations was asses-
sed whilst controlling for other explanatory variables; nega-
tive affect, PTSD symptoms, and recent stressful life events.
Method
Participants
The inclusion criteria were; aged between 18 years or older
and fluency in the English language. There were no
exclusion criteria. We recruited participants from social
media advertisements (‘‘Are you interested in your sleep:
We are looking for volunteers to complete an online sleep
survey’’) and from our existing database of individuals who
had given consent to be contacted about sleep studies. 1479
individuals responded to the survey advert. To ensure data
integrity and the quality of responses, we (1) deleted 602
partial (i.e. incomplete) responses, (2) assessed the time
participants needed to complete the survey. Four partici-
pants who had response times under 10 min, which was
deemed
highly
unlikely
(median
completion
length
22.6 min), were omitted, and (3) participants’ sleep dura-
tion was investigated for unlikely entries (e.g. going to bed
after the stated sleep onset time). Thirty one cases were
detected and excluded from further analyses. The final
sample included 846 participants. Informed consent was
obtained prior to participation and the study was approved
by the University of Oxford Medical Sciences Research
Ethics Committee (R43763/RE001).
Measures
Nightmare Severity Scale (NSS) [42]. In this scale, a
nightmare is defined as a dream with upsetting content
which is recalled with distress upon awakening. The NSS
assesses nightmare frequency over the past 2 weeks. (‘‘In
the past 2 weeks, how many nights (0–14) have you
experienced
nightmares?’’).
Moreover,
the
self-report
questionnaire includes 45 items which form a total night-
mare severity score. There are three sub-scales which
contribute equally to the total score; preoccupation with
nightmare experiences [e.g. ‘‘It is hard to stop thinking
about my nightmare(s)’’], nightmare distress [e.g. ‘‘I’m
distressed by my nightmare(s)’’] and impairment in func-
tion [e.g. ‘‘My nightmare(s) affect my ability to stick to
daytime commitments (e.g. work/meeting people/getting to
appointments’’)]. The severity scale is completed only if
the participant reports at least one nightmare. Higher scores
indicate greater nightmare severity.

 Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)
[43]. The depression and anxiety scales were used to assess
negative affect during the preceding week. The scales have
been reported to possess good psychometric properties in
clinical and non-clinical samples [44]. Scores on the
DASS-21 depression and anxiety sub-scales were summed
to provide level of negative affect. Higher scores indicate
greater levels of negative affect.
Primary Care-PTSD screen (PC-PTSD) [44]. PTSD
symptoms were assessed with the four item PC-PTSD
screen. The screen includes an introductory sentence which
defines a traumatic event that may have happened (i.e. ‘‘In
your life, have you ever had any experience that was so
frightening, horrible, or upsetting that, in the past month,
you:’’) without asking participants to identify their own
experiences. It contains four questions answered on a
binary response scale (yes and no) assessing avoidance and
hypervigilance experiences following the experience. The
scale has been found to possess good test–retest reliability
(r = 0.83). The optimally efficient cut-off score for a
probable PTSD diagnosis has been found to be 3, with a
corresponding sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.78
[45]. We used the dimensional score in our statistical
analyses.
Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) [46]. This
scale assesses stressful life-events over the past year. It
entails 43 items and is a self-inventory scale. It lists
stressful life events that the participant might have expe-
rienced over the past 12 months (e.g. divorce). Each
stressful life event on the SRRS has a weighted stress score
associated with it (e.g. death of a spouse = 100, whilst
minor violation of law = 11) and the total score reflects the
sum of these. Scores can, therefore, range from 0 (‘‘no life
events experienced’’) to 1466 with higher scores indicating
greater experience of stressful life events. The temporal
stability over a 2-year period has been observed to be high
in a non-clinical population [47].
Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) [48]. Worry
levels were assessed with the 16 items PSWQ which is the
most established measure of trait worry style possessing
high levels of test–rest reliability in non-clinical samples
(r = 0.74–0.92) and internal consistency (ranging from
0.88 to 0.95 for clinical and non-clinical samples, respec-
tively; see [49], for a review). Items are rated on a scale
ranging from 1 (‘‘Not at all typical for me’’) to 5 (‘‘Very
typical for me’’). Higher scores indicate a greater tendency
to worry.
Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS) [50]. This
scale is a 29-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the
frequency of depersonalisation experiences over the past
6 months. The scale measuring the duration of the expe-
rience was omitted. This measurement has been observed
to have good psychometric properties [51]. Higher scores
indicate greater levels of depersonalisation.
Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ)
[51]. Psychotic-like experiences (i.e. hallucinations and
paranoia) were measured using subscales from the SPEQ
that asking for the frequency of 15 paranoid thoughts and
nine hallucinatory experiences. The scales range from 0
(‘‘Not at all’’) to 5 (‘‘Daily’’). The subscales have been
validated as measures of psychotic experiences in a general
population sample of adolescents [51]. Higher scores
indicate higher levels of paranoia and hallucinatory
experiences.
Alcohol use data Participants were asked to specify
the number of alcoholic drinks they had consumed over the
past week. A drink was defined as a (a) regular size serving
of beer, (b) regular size glass of wine, or (c) one measure of
liquor.
Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) [52] We
assessed current sleep duration with six selected questions
of the MCTO that concern self-reported habitual sleep
timings for work and work-free days. A mean sleep dura-
tion was calculated for each participant by weighting sleep
duration by the amount of work and free days, respectively.
Borg’s CR10 Scale [53] This scale was used as a psy-
chophysical tool to assess subjective perception of effort
during physical activities over the past week. Participants
were asked to indicate the intensity of exercise (1 = no
activity (e.g. watching TV, reading a book, driving a car,
etc.) to 10 = very very hard (e.g. running a race) they had
completed each day over the past 7 days. An increase in
power, heart rate and oxygen uptake has been shown to
correspond to an increase in subjective estimations in
relation to physical effort using the Borg’s CR10 Scale
[54]. Participants rated the maximum intensity activity they
had completed each day. The total score across the 7 days
was used as an indicator for physical activity levels.
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [55] The ISI is a seven
item self-report instrument measuring insomnia severity.
The items relate to the previous month. The questionnaire
has been found to be a reliable and valid measure to
quantify perceived insomnia severity [55]. A cut-off score
of 10 has been suggested for detecting insomnia cases with
of sensitivity 86.1% and a specificity of 87.7% in the
community sample [56]. Higher scores indicate greater
insomnia symptom severity.
Demographics
Participants were asked to indicate their age, gender,
nationality, work status, marital status, alcohol consump-
tion, cannabis or cocaine use.

 Procedure
Participants were invited to take part in a cross-sectional
online survey, which was programmed using Qualtrics
software. Informed consent was obtained online at the start.
In the first step of the survey, participants provided
demographic information. Subsequently, questionnaires
were presented in the following order: DASS-21, PSWQ,
ISI, SPEQ, CDS, NSS, PC-PTSD, MCTQ, Borg’s CR10
Scale and SRRS. Finally, participants were asked to enter
their email address to be included in a prize draw.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were carried out using the statistical package
for social sciences version 20 [57].
The survey questions were mandatory and the very
small amount of missing data resulted from rare failings of
the software. There were missing items for 11 individuals
for the activity measure, which were replaced with the
participant’s mean activity level from the other days over
the past week. Further, missing values on alcohol (n = 20),
cannabis (n = 3) and cocaine use (n = 3) were handled
using median imputations. Results did not change as a
consequence of these imputation procedures.
First, descriptive statistics and the strength of statistical
association between variables were tested by bivariate
Pearson’s correlation coefficients, Chi-square tests, and
independent samples t tests when appropriate. Here, par-
ticipants who experienced at least one nightmare over the
past fortnight were compared to controls (i.e. the reference
group not experiencing nightmares). We report magnitudes
of effect sizes according to Cohen [58]: correlation coef-
ficients of 0.10 are considered ‘‘small’’, those of 0.30 are
‘‘medium’’, and those of 0.50 are ‘‘large’’.
To test the hypotheses concerning nightmare occurrence,
nightmare frequency over the past fortnight was dichot-
omised (no nightmares = 0, one or more nightmares = 1)
and used as the dependent variable. We ran multiple binary
regression analyses on nightmare occurrence and multiple
linear regression analyses on log-transformed nightmare
severity. In both analyses, negative affect was added as an
independent variable and one of the following variables was
added separately to the model in the first stage; worry,
depersonalisation,
hallucinatory
experiences,
paranoia,
alcohol use, sleep duration, and activity levels. To assess the
predictive ability of shorter and longer sleep duration, we
tested the quadratic function for significance. In the second
step PTSD symptoms and thereafter stressful lifeeventswere
added as additional independent variables to the models. All
independent variables were standardised to ease the inter-
pretation of odds ratios (ORs) and standard regression
coefficients. For the interpretation of results it should be
remembered that for continuous scales with standardised
values the ORs refer to the risk-increase for a 1-standard
deviation increase in the independent variable. All hypoth-
esis testing was two-tailed. 95% confidence intervals (CI),
ORs, and R2 are reported when appropriate.
In our primary analysis, we deliberately included no
covariates other than negative affect in our data analysis on
nightmare occurrence and severity. Miller and Chapman
[59] caution on including covariates in statistical analyses,
particularly in studies with a non-randomised study design.
Here, overlap or truly shared variance between variables
can only be artificially controlled for and may result in
inappropriate removal of variance. The study was designed
to identify variables associated with nightmare occurrence
and severity beyond negative affect only. However, PTSD
symptoms and life events were included as additional
independent variables in our secondary tests as there were
strong grounds for their use.
Results
Demographics
Eighty nine percent of the sample was female and the mean
age was 44 years (SD 15.9), range 18–77 (see Table 1).
381 individuals (45%) reported experiencing at least one
nightmare over the past fortnight. The distribution of
nightmare occurrence was highly skewed with about half
of the participants indicating no nightmare experiences and
fewer participants indicating more than one nightmare over
the past fortnight (see Fig. 1). The mean nightmare severity
score was 80.01 (SD 31.12), range 45–221.
Unadjusted associates of nightmares
Individuals with nightmares reported higher levels of
insomnia and a greater likelihood of having used cannabis
compared to those without nightmare experiences. Indi-
viduals who were married, divorced, or widowed were less
likely to experience nightmares compared to those who
were single. Students had an increased likelihood of
experiencing nightmares compared to full-time employed
participants (Table 1).
Independent samples t tests found that the nightmare
group was significantly younger and reported significantly
higher levels of negative affect, worry, depersonalisation,
hallucinatory experiences, paranoia, compared to the
individuals not experiencing nightmares. Cohen’s d effect
sizes ranged from low to high (Table 2). Nightmare
occurrences was unrelated to sex and ethnicity.

 Bivariate Pearson’s correlations between nightmare
severity and the independent variables were highly sig-
nificant. Here, higher levels of nightmare severity were
associated with higher ratings of negative affect, worry,
depersonalisation, hallucination, paranoia, sleep dura-
tion, PTSD symptoms, and life events. Alcohol use and
activity levels were unrelated to nightmare severity
(Table 3).
Adjusted analysis controlling for negative affect,
PTSD symptoms and stressful life events
Worry
Worry was significantly associated with nightmare occur-
rence when negative affect was controlled (see Table 4).
This remained significant after including PTSD symptoms
and stressful life events. Nightmare severity was also sig-
nificantly associated with worry, controlling for negative
affect, and remained significant after including PTSD
symptoms and thereafter stressful life events in the analysis
(Table 5).
Depersonalisation
Depersonalisation was significantly associated with night-
mare occurrence controlling for negative affect. The sig-
nificance level was slightly reduced but still significant
after including PTSD symptoms in the analysis. When
stressful life events were also included depersonalisation
was no longer significantly associated with nightmare
occurrence (Table 4). Depersonalisation was significantly

 associated with nightmare severity controlling for negative
affect, PTSD symptoms, and stressful life events (Table 5).
Psychotic-like experiences
Nightmare occurrence was significantly associated with
both hallucinations and paranoia over and above negative
affect. After including PTSD symptoms and stressful life
events, hallucinations remained highly significant; how-
ever, paranoia was not significantly associated with
nightmare occurrence anymore (Table 4). Both hallucina-
tions and paranoia were significantly associated with
nightmare severity controlling for negative affect, PTSD
symptoms, and stressful life events (Table 5).
Alcohol use, physical activity, and sleep duration
Longer, but not shorter, sleep duration was significantly
associated with nightmare occurrence controlling for neg-
ative affect. This effect still remained after inclusion of
PTSD symptoms and stressful life events in the model
(Table 4). Alcohol use and activity levels were not asso-
ciated with nightmare occurrence.
The same pattern of results for all analyses was obtained
when additionally adjusting for age and the nightmare
severity variable was not log transformed.
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate a wide range of psy-
chological, psychiatric, and behavioural factors that could
plausibly contribute to nightmare occurrence and night-
mare severity over and above more established causal
factors (negative affect, PTSD symptoms, and stressful life
events). Higher levels of worry, hallucinatory experiences
and longer sleep duration were significantly associated
with whether or not participants experienced nightmares,
even after controlling for negative affect, PTSD, and

 stressful life events. Worry, depersonalisation, paranoia
and hallucinatory experiences were significantly associated
with the severity of nightmares. Again, these associations
remained significant after controlling for negative affect,
PTSD symptoms, and stressful life events. The key caveat
is
the
cross-sectional
design,
preventing
causal
interpretations.
Of the variables tested, worry was the strongest asso-
ciate of the occurrence of nightmares, and also related to
the severity rating of nightmares. Given that these associ-
ations held after controlling for negative affect, it seems
plausible that the amplification of negative thought content,
generated by this cognitive style is associated both with the
occurrence of nightmares and also the resultant distress,
preoccupation and impairment that they cause. An impor-
tant next step is to assess the direction of the relationship
between worry and nightmares. It is most likely that pre-
sleep worry increases the likelihood of distressing night-
mares, and, in turn, nightmares may trigger worry the
following day, resulting in a self-perpetuating circle. It is,
therefore, possible that the relation between nightmares and
worry is bidirectional. Given that effective interventions
already exist for the treatment of worry [60, 61], one
approach towards assessing causality would be to treat
worry and assess the impact on nightmare occurrence and
severity (termed a causal interventionist approach, e.g.
[62]). If successful, worry may be a novel treatment target
to boost the efficacy of nightmare interventions.
Longer sleep duration showed a strong and consistent
association with nightmare occurrence, even after adjust-
ments for negative affect, PTSD symptoms, and stressful
life events. Here, a longer sleep duration might increase
the amount of late-night REM sleep [38, 63], thereby
increasing the opportunity for nightmares to occur. We
predict that stabilisation of the sleep window (i.e. reduc-
ing a long sleep duration) might thus lead to a reduction
in nightmare occurrence for those with longer sleep
durations.
More broadly, our findings indicate that nightmares may
not be wholly accountable to negative affect, PTSD
symptoms, and stressful life events. Hallucinatory experi-
ences predicted nightmare occurrence and both deperson-
alisation and psychotic-like experiences also predicted
nightmare severity. Clearly, further research is needed,
ideally in experimental or treatment study designs, to
assess the direction of causality between associations and
test possible mechanistic links. Nonetheless, this study has
identified novel processes that may be predictive of
nightmare occurrences and severity.
Surprisingly, no associations were found between night-
mare occurrences and alcohol use or activity levels. Limi-
tations in our measures may be a potential reason for earlier
results not being replicated (e.g. [38]). We did not assess the
duration and time of the day of alcohol consumption but only
the dose over the past week. Similarly, with regards to
physical activity, we did not differentiate between acute and
regular exercise, assessed baseline physical activity levels,
the duration of exercise bouts, nor the time of the day when
performed. All of these variables, however, might affect
REM sleep [64] and thereby, the likelihood to experience
nightmares. More in-depth assessments of alcohol use and
physical activities on nightmare experiences are warranted
to arrive at firm conclusions.
Limitations and directions for future research
There are clear limitations of the study. Chiefly, the cross-
sectional design limits the strength of any causal interpre-
tations. Moreover, the sample is not representative of the
general population. Ninety percent of the sample was
female and the prevalence of nightmares was higher than in

 epidemiological studies. Since the study was advertised as
a ‘‘sleep survey about dreams and nightmares’’, it is
probable that participants with sleep problems were more
likely to complete our study [supported by the high level of
clinically significant insomnia in our sample (70%)]. In
addition, the high nightmare prevalence may be due to the
duration nightmares were assessed for (i.e. 2 weeks instead
of weekly prevalence). While these differences limit the
generalisability of our findings, the current study benefitted
to some degree from the non-representativeness. The study
was not set up to assess the prevalence rate of nightmares
but rather to identify risk factors beyond negative affect
that may predict nightmares. Therefore, the high number of
individuals reporting nightmare problems gave sufficient
power to test the associations. However, future studies will
benefit from more representative samples (e.g. using
patient populations).
Notwithstanding these caveats, the current study shows
novel cross-sectional associations between psychological,
psychiatric, and behavioural factors with nightmares,
which were not accounted for by negative affect, PTSD
symptoms, and stressful life events alone. Instead, for
example, levels of worry and sleep duration showed strong
and consistent associations with the occurrence of night-
mares. Clearly, causal relationships need testing in future
research using more representative samples.
