In the last decade, a 2-terminal passive circuit element called a memristor has been 
developed for non-volatile resistive random access memory and has more recently shown 
promise for neuromorphic computing.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  Compared to flash memory, memristors 
have higher endurance, multi-bit data storage, and faster read/write times.4, 7, 8  However, 
although 2-terminal memristors have demonstrated basic neural functions, synapses in the 
human brain outnumber neurons by more than a factor of 1000, which implies that multi-
terminal memristors are needed to perform complex functions such as heterosynaptic 
plasticity.3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Previous attempts to move beyond 2-terminal memristors include the 
3-terminal Widrow-Hoff memistor14 and field-effect transistors with nanoionic gates15 or 
floating gates,16 albeit without memristive switching in the transistor.17 Here, we report the 
scalable experimental realization of a multi-terminal hybrid memristor and transistor (i.e., 
memtransistor) using polycrystalline monolayer MoS2. Two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 
memtransistors show gate tunability in individual states by 4 orders of magnitude in addition 
 2 
 
to large switching ratios with high cycling endurance and long-term retention of states. In 
addition to conventional neural learning behavior of long-term potentiation/depression, 6-
terminal MoS2 memtransistors possess gate-tunable heterosynaptic functionality that is not 
achievable using 2-terminal memristors. For example, the conductance between a pair of two 
floating electrodes (pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons) is varied by ~10√ó by applying 
voltage pulses to modulatory terminals. In situ scanning probe microscopy, cryogenic charge 
transport measurements, and device modeling reveal that bias-induced MoS2 defect motion 
drives resistive switching by dynamically varying Schottky barrier heights. Overall, the 
seamless integration of a memristor and transistor into one multi-terminal device has the 
potential to enable complex Hebbian learning in addition to providing opportunities for 
studying the unique physics of defect kinetics in 2D materials.18, 19, 20, 21, 22  
Uniform polycrystalline monolayer MoS2 films with an average grain size of 3‚Äì5 Œºm were 
grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on SiO2/Si substrates (Methods) and characterized 
using X-ray photoelectron, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopies (Figs. 1a‚Äìc and 
Extended Data Fig. 1). MoS2 memtransistors were fabricated in a field-effect geometry with 
channel lengths (L) and widths (W) varying from 5 Œºm to 150 Œºm (Figs. 1d‚Äìf). Since clean 
interfaces between MoS2 channels and metal electrodes were found to be critical, an 
unconventional photolithography process was developed based on a polymethylglutarimide 
(PMGI) and photoresist bilayer (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2). 
At large drain bias VD in the sub-threshold regime (gate bias VG < threshold voltage Vth), a 
typical memtransistor is in a high resistance state (HRS) for the VD sweep from 0 to 80 V (sweep 
1) and gradually changes to a low resistance state (LRS) (Fig. 2a). The device maintains LRS 
during the sweep from 80 to 0 V (sweep 2), resets to HRS during the sweep from 0 to ‚Äì80 V (sweep 
 3 
 
3), and maintains HRS from ‚Äì80 to 0 V (sweep 4). Thus, these devices act as LRS-HRS 
memtransistors. Fig. 2b shows that when VG is varied from 50 to ‚Äì50 V, both LRS and HRS 
resistances change by a factor of ~104 and the switching ratio (ILRS/IHRS at VD = 0.5 V) is tuned 
from 300 to 8 (inset Fig. 2e). Due to the n-type MoS2 channel, the forward-biased (VD > 0 V) 
device is completely OFF at VG = ‚Äì50 V (Fig. 2c), and the reverse-biased (VD < 0 V) device is 
insulating for a range of VD depending on the applied VG (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c). The 
gate leakage (IG‚ÄìVG) remains below 200 pA during high VD and VG sweeps (Extended Data Fig. 
3a). 
Unlike filament-based resistive switching, MoS2 memtransistors do not require an 
electroforming process, although the switching ratio increases with increasing VD sweep range 
(Extended Data Fig. 3b). The largest switching ratio of >102 was obtained from devices with W = 
100‚Äì150 Œºm and L = 5‚Äì15 Œºm. The devices show bipolar resistive switching where reversing the 
bias polarity is essential to restoring the initial resistance states (Extended Data Figs. 3d,e). The 
hysteresis in the ID‚ÄìVD characteristics of these MoS2 memtransistors is fundamentally distinct from 
commonly reported hysteresis in ID‚ÄìVG curves due to oxide-related traps in field-effect 
transistors.23, 24 Instead, the transfer characteristics (ID‚ÄìVG) of MoS2 memtransistors in LRS and 
HRS show significant shifts (~10 V) in threshold voltage (Vth) with curves that cross each other at 
VG = Vcross (Fig. 2c). HRS shows up to 100√ó higher resistance for VG < Vcross and 2√ó higher field-
effect mobility (Œº) at VG > Vcross compared to LRS. Therefore, the forward bias switching loop 
changes from counterclockwise (LRS to HRS) for VG < Vcross to clockwise (HRS to LRS) for VG > 
Vcross (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3f). 
Fig. 2d shows endurance characteristics for a MoS2 memtransistor that was switched 475 
times between LRS and HRS through full sweep cycles. Within a subset, ID saturates to an upper 
 4 
 
value via stretched exponentials (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5a).  Between neighboring subsets, ID 
jumps randomly to a ~10√ó smaller value followed by the same inverse exponential growth, which 
suggests an oxide-related trap-release process activated by large fields near the source electrode in 
forward bias.23 This behavior is reduced under reverse-bias (Extended Data Fig. 5b), possibly due 
to smaller band-bending near the drain electrode in reverse bias. Since both HRS and LRS show 
similar transitory decays, the switching ratio (~100) remains relatively constant (Fig. 2d). 
Individual resistance states measured up to 24 hours show a projected retention of distinct states 
for timescales on the order of years (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5e).  A statistical study of 62 
devices that were fabricated with identical geometry on a single chip showed a log-normal 
distribution of switching ratios (Fig. 2f). Device-to-device variability is attributed to spatial 
inhomogeneity in the CVD MoS2 film. 
Due to its 2D nature, the MoS2 channel allows the switching mechanism to be probed via 
in situ electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) as shown in Figs. 3a,b. The drain contact and 
conductive cantilever tip were biased independently (Extended Data Fig. 6), while the cantilever 
phase shift was recorded as the tip traced the topography profile 50 nm above the surface. Since 
the phase shift is proportional to the square of the potential difference between the tip and the 
underlying surface, the phase image provides a map of the local potential.20 Line profiles reveal a 
sharper potential drop (larger field) at the source in forward HRS compared to forward LRS, 
suggesting a larger contact resistance in HRS than LRS (Fig. 3b).  Reverse HRS also shows a 
larger field at the drain compared to reverse LRS, although this difference is smaller, consistent 
with the smaller switching ratio at reverse bias. Multiple line profiles confirm that the differences 
in HRS and LRS electric fields are consistent along the entire channel width, despite grain 
boundary induced EFM phase variations away from the contacts (Extended Data Fig. 7). Since a 
 5 
 
reverse-biased Schottky diode at the source (drain) dominates ID at VD > 0 (VD < 0), EFM 
measurements provide direct evidence that the HRS to LRS (LRS to HRS) switching in 
memtransistors is caused by dynamic tuning of Schottky barriers. Using variable temperature (T) 
charge transport measurements and assuming a 2D thermionic emission model, the effective 
barrier heights (Œ¶b) in different states are extracted from the slope of ln(I/T3/2) versus 1/T at 
different VG (Extended Data Fig. 8). Thermionic emission dominates at VG < VFB (flat-band 
voltage) producing linearly varying Œ¶b with VG. Thermally-assisted tunneling through a deformed 
Schottky barrier begins to contribute at VG > VFB, resulting in deviation from the linear trend (Fig. 
3c). Thus, the Schottky barrier height (Œ¶sb = Œ¶b) is extracted from VG = VFB. VFB decreases from 2 
V (HRS) to ‚Äì8 V (LRS), consistent with a Vth shift of 15 V for the same device (Extended Data 
Fig. 8). In addition, Œ¶sb decreases from 125 meV (HRS) to 80 meV (LRS), confirming the 
observations from EFM. 
Charge transport in MoS2 LRS-HRS memtransistors can be described by Schottky barrier 
transistors (equations 1 and 2 below) where Œ¶b is a function an internal state variable (w) defined 
as the width of the region with excess dopants (Œîn) (Extended Data Fig. 9a).1, 17, 25 Tuning the 
Schottky barrier through increased doping near contacts (Œ¶b~‚àö‚àÜùëõ. ùë§) is a standard practice in 
conventional field-effect transistors.26, 27 Similarly, we propose that defects in MoS2 act as dopants 
with their local migration under an applied bias being facilitated by grain boundaries, as previously 
observed under transmission electron microscopy and explained by ab initio calculations.18, 19, 21 
Thus, we develop a memtransistor model where the effective Œ¶b changes by image charge lowering 
and tunneling at high biases (see Methods), resulting in the following coupled equations:

where A, D, E, and œïb0 are fitting parameters, and e, n, Œµs are electronic charge, doping level, and 
dielectric constant of monolayer MoS2, respectively. Equation (3) captures the non-linear kinetics 
of the dopants near the contacts using a window function where the degree of non-linearity is 
defined by a positive integer p (see Methods).28 This model agrees well with the experimental data 
(Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 9) and helps establish that the dependence of w on VG (through 
ID) embodies the most essential feature of the MoS2 memtransistor and distinguishes it from a 2-
terminal memristor.17 To further illustrate the non-trivial switching, we fabricated MoS2 devices 
without the PMGI-based process and used residual ~1.5 nm thick photoresist layer as a tunneling 
barrier between MoS2 and the metal contacts (Figs. 3d,e and Extended Data Figs. 10a-d). The 
tunneling barrier de-pins the Fermi level and causes the resistance states to change abruptly upon 
crossing 0 V, resulting in LRS-LRS memtransistors. Overall, the switching mechanism of both 
LRS-HRS and LRS-LRS memtransistors can be described by two memristors at the contacts 
connected by a field-effect transistor (see Supplementary notes on switching mechanism and 
Extended Data Fig. 10e).      
While grain boundaries in polycrystalline MoS2 memtransistors enable large switching 
ratios and prevent electrical breakdown by lowering Schottky barriers through dynamic defect 
migration, control devices on single grains of CVD-grown MoS2 show a qualitatively different 
reversible breakdown phenomenon (Fig. 4a). This breakdown event is marked by a sharp drop in 
the conductance at a voltage Vbr during sweep 1 that increases again to the original value during 
sweep 2. This abrupt change in charge transport is accompanied by the emergence of dendritic 
 7 
 
features (~300‚Äì500 nm) close to the source (upper inset in Fig. 4a and Extended Data Figs. 11a,b). 
Control devices reveal a linear correlation of breakdown current (Ibr) with the width of the source 
electrode (Wsrc) and no correlation with L (lower inset in Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 12). Since 
ID normally scales as W/L, the observed deviation in this scaling at breakdown suggests that the 
reverse-biased Schottky diode at the source electrode creates a bottleneck for electron injection at 
the channel,27 ultimately causing electromigration at the source contact.7 This reversible 
breakdown in CVD MoS2 contrasts the irreversible breakdown in exfoliated MoS2 by Joule 
heating.29 In the high bias limit (¬±120 V), polycrystalline MoS2 memtransistors also degrade 
irreversibly in a manner that shows light emission during each subsequent sweep (Extended Data 
Figs. 11c-e).  
The 2D planar geometry of the MoS2 memtransistor provides a platform to realize multi-
terminal neural circuits mimicking multiple synaptic connections in neurons. For example, in a 6-
terminal memtransistor, the conductance between any permutation of two of the four inner 
electrodes can be modulated by high-bias pulses applied to the outer two electrodes while the inner 
electrodes are kept floating (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 13). To achieve heterosynaptic 
plasticity, the conductance between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons should be controlled 
by additional modulatory terminals.30 While this type of modulation has been shown previously in 
Ag-based cationic memristors, this design is limited to only 3 terminals due to the requirement of 
filament formation across the channel.6, 30 In contrast, the MoS2 memtransistor enables larger 
numbers of terminals and facile tuning via modulation of the Schottky barrier localized at each 
terminal (see Supplementary notes on switching mechanism). Multi-terminal memtransistors also 
allow further tuning of heterosynaptic plasticity via a gate electrode where the switching ratio 
 8 
 
between any permutation of side electrodes can be controlled from ~2 to 10-fold by varying VG 
from 50 to 20 V (Extended Data Fig. 13f).    
MoS2 memtransistors also demonstrate long-term potentiation and long-term depression 
that mimic excitatory and inhibitory synapses in organisms (Fig. 4c). Post-synaptic current (PSC) 
is shown to increase and decreases exponentially with repetition of positive and negative bias 
pulses of 1 msec duration (Fig. 4c). The linearity of pulse training is comparable to metal-oxide 
memristors and can be further improved by employing bipolar pulsing schemes.11, 31 Mimicking 
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), paired pulses separated by a time interval (Œît) induce 
positive and negative changes in synaptic weight with positive and negative pulses (Fig. 4d), 
resulting in time constants of ~2 and  6 msec, respectively, which are comparable to biological 
synapse response times.11, 32  
In conclusion, MoS2 memtransistors combine resistive switching with transistor gating to 
realize nonlinear charge transport with wide tunability of individual states and switching ratios.  In 
contrast to devices that require single-crystal MoS2 flakes, the utilization of polycrystalline MoS2 
films allows straightforward scaling of this technology to large-area device arrays and integrated 
circuits. The 2D planar geometry of monolayer MoS2 further enables the realization of multi-
terminal memtransistors with unprecedented heterosynaptic plasticity that holds promise for 
complex Hebbian learning from multiple inputs in neuromorphic computing by mimicking 
biological neurons with multiple synapses.
