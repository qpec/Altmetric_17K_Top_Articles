Assessment of Overall Survival, Quality of Life,
and Safety Benefits Associated With New Cancer Medicines
Sebastian Salas-Vega, MSc; Othon Iliopoulos, MD; Elias Mossialos, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE There is a dearth of evidence examining the impact of newly licensed cancer
medicines on therapy. This information could otherwise support clinical practice, and
promote value-based decision-making in the cancer drug market.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the comparative therapeutic value of all new cancer medicines
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) between 2003 and 2013.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a narrative synthesis approach to
systematically synthesize and analyze English, French, and Australian health technology
assessments (HTAs) of all new cancer medicines licensed in the United States and Europe
between 2003 and 2013.
INTERVENTIONS Sixty-two new molecular entities with a primary oncology indication.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL), and safety.
RESULTS Of the 62 new active cancer molecules approved by the FDA and EMA between
2003 and 2013, 53 were appraised by English, French, or Australian HTA agencies through
May 2015. Of these 53 drugs, 23 (43%) increased OS by 3 months or longer, 6 (11%) by less
than 3 months, and 8 (15%) by an unknown magnitude; there was no evidence to suggest
that the remaining 16 (30%) increased OS over best alternative treatments. Where overall
survival gains could be quantified, all new cancer drugs were associated with a mean (SE)
total increase in OS of 3.43 (0.63) months over the treatments that were available in 2003.
Drug-related improvements in OS were, however, widely distributed across therapeutic
targets—ranging between 0 (thyroid, ascites) and 8.48 months (breast cancers)—and were
sometimes based on modeled data, indirect or nonactive comparisons, or nonvalidated
evidence. Although 22 (42%) of 53 new medicines were associated with an increase in QoL,
24 (45%) were also associated with reduced patient safety. Of the 53 new cancer drugs, 42
(79%) were associated with at least some improvement in OS, QoL, or safety.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although innovation in the oncology drug market has
contributed to improvements in therapy, the magnitude and dimension of clinical benefits
vary widely, and there may be reasons to doubt that claims of efficacy reflect real-world
effectiveness exactly. These findings raise important questions for clinical decision-making
and value-based policy.

T
here are growing questions about the value gained from
spending on what seem to be ever more expensive can-
cer medicines. Rising expenditures may make it diffi-
cult for patients to access or remain compliant with life-
extending therapies.1,2 Yet, some have argued that high prices
may be justified if new and innovative treatments offer sig-
nificant benefits to patients.2,3 Even as studies point to gains
in overall survival (OS) from innovative cancer medicines,4 ef-
forts to examine the value from spending on new cancer drugs
remain stymied by a dearth of systematic evidence on their
clinical risks and benefits. This lack of evidence makes it dif-
ficult for the public to demand more from innovation,5 and,
where costs factor into the decision-making process, for cli-
nicians and patients to balance preferences for the expected
impact of treatment against rising drug expenditures.
One difficulty in characterizing the clinical impact of
new cancer drugs is the multiplicity of outcome measures.
Overall survival has traditionally been taken as the gold
standard among oncology efficacy endpoints.6,7 The United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for its part, des-
ignates OS as the only “universally accepted” and the “most
reliable” direct measure of benefit in oncology drug trials.8
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) similarly states that
convincing favorable effects on OS are, from a clinical and
methodological perspective, the “most persuasive outcome”
of oncology trials.9 As policymakers adopt new regulations
to expedite access to medicines for serious conditions,10,11
interest has grown in measuring effectiveness through sur-
rogate markers.12 These, however, are not yet systematically
measured by regulators8,13 and still have inconsistent or
uncertain predictive clinical value.14,15 Despite its potential
limitations, the American Society for Clinical Oncology’
s
(ASCO) recently published16 Value Framework in fact
recommends that efficacy benefits be measured through
progression-free survival or response rates only if OS is not
reported.17 In addition to efficacy measures, quality of life
(QoL) and safety are also used by regulators and clinicians to
fully consider the impact on how patients feel and function
owing to treatment.17-19
To shed light on the clinical risks and benefits from new
cancer drugs, this study took a narrative synthesis approach
to review regulatory assessments of the impact on OS, QoL,
and safety from all cancer medicines newly licensed in the US
and Europe over the past decade. Since US licensing deci-
sions do not require proof of comparative efficacy and may not
consider OS benefits under accelerated licensing
procedures,20,21 we extracted and reviewed summary conclu-
sions of drug-related OS, QoL, and safety benefits from Eng-
lish (The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,
NICE), French (Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS), and Australian
(Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, PBAC) health
technology assessment (HTA) agencies. We find that OS ben-
efits vary widely, improvements in OS and QoL often come at
the cost of safety, and there are reasons to doubt whether clini-
calefficacyhasbeenmatchedbyeffectivenessintherealworld.
Thisstudyprovidesadditionalclarityonthepotentialrisksand

how clinical impact is measured by regulators, how the scien-
tific evidence is used to inform clinical practice, and how much
value is generated from cancer drug spending.
Methods
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
All new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by the FDA and
EMA between 2003 and 2013 with a primary indication for on-
cology were eligible for inclusion. This study focused exclu-
sively on primary indications, which are likely to reflect main
intended use. Drug inclusion criteria were adapted from a pre-
vious study by Roberts et al.22 Because this study did not use
or access patient-level data the London School of Economics
and Political Science determined that ethical approval was not
required.
Drug Appraisals
Evaluations of the clinical impact of new cancer drugs were
obtained from English, French, and Australian agency HTAs
published through May 2015. These agencies regularly pub-
lish HTAs in the English language, and are required to evalu-
ate the clinical impact of new medicines in relation to exist-
ing standards of treatment that would most likely be replaced
by the new intervention.23-25 Health technology assessments
were selected for review if they pertained to the same target
condition as the first FDA-approved indication. If multiple re-
ports evaluated the same target condition, we selected the lat-
est report that most closely matched the first FDA-approved
indication with respect to any treatment restrictions (eg, can-
cer staging). In ambiguous cases, determinations were made
in consultation with a medical expert. Initial EMA-approved
indications were used if the drug had not been approved by
US regulators through May 2015.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
Two reviewers (S.S.V. and R.L.) adapted the patient, interven-
tion, comparator, outcomes framework26 to independently re-
view assessments of the clinical impact of new cancer medi-
cines.Informationonrecommendedpatientpopulations,novel
interventions, and therapeutic comparators were extracted
Key Points
Question What are the overall survival, quality of life, and safety
benefits of recently licensed cancer medicines?
Findings An analysis of health technology assessment reports
found that new cancer drugs were associated with increased
overall survival by an average of 3.43 months between 2003 and
2013, with 43% increasing overall survival by 3 months or longer,
11% by less than 3 months and 30% were not associated with an
increase in overall survival. Most new cancer drugs improved
quality of life, and were associated with reduced patient safety.
Meaning The added benefits of new cancer medicines vary
widely across and within therapeutic indications and may be based
on modeled data, indirect or nonactive comparisons, or
nonvalidated evidence.

from each drug appraisal, as were evaluations of the impact
on OS, QoL, and safety of drug treatment. The Table lists the
classes of evidence that were typically evaluated and re-
ported by English, French, and Australian authorities to as-
sess OS, QoL, and safety. This approach captured key out-
come measures that are regularly considered during formal
drug reviews,8,18,19 and reflected ASCO’
s recently published
conceptual framework for measuring the value of cancer treat-
ment options.17
A rules-based process was undertaken to evaluate evi-
dence reported by HTA agencies. For this, we considered over-
all judgments of the available evidence on OS, QoL, and safety
from HTA summary sections, their acknowledgement of the
significance of clinical trial results, or referral to prior evalu-
ations of the primary evidence. If these were absent, or if an
HTA agency concluded that clinical benefits could not be as-
sessed, corresponding extraction parameters were marked as
missing. Disagreements on how to interpret HTA agency sum-
maries about the clinical impact of treatment were resolved
through consensus. Overall survival benefits were catego-
rized as 3 months or longer, less than 3 months, increase but
of unknown magnitude, and no demonstrated increase. A re-
cent ASCO working group has suggested that improvements
in median OS of at least 20% may demonstrate a clinically
meaningful improvement in survival. However, our ap-
proachwasdesignedtoreflectthesystemthatiscurrentlyused
in England to identify OS improvements that are large enough
to justify additional expense in end-of-life care,27 and used at
times by Australian authorities to assess new health
technologies.28 Quality of life and safety benefits were cat-
egorized as improvement, reduction, mixed evidence, or no
difference relative to the standards of care existing at time of
evaluation. A hierarchical process was followed to generate a
composite measure of the drug-related effect on OS, QoL, and
safety. In instances where assessments were available from
multipleHTAagencies,thisinvolvedidentifyingthemostposi-
tivedrug-relatedsurvivalbenefittorepresentwhatmaybepos-

dicated that the new medicine was associated with an overall

sified all eligible drugs into therapeutic target groups accord-
ing to their FDA-approved primary indication. A summary of
drug-related effects on OS, QoL, and safety is provided in
eTable 1 in the Supplement, and an overview of the regula-

indicate a high level of agreement.30 Finally, to attempt to ex-
ternally validate our results, we sought informal feedback on
our analysis from 2 medical experts from the FDA. After pro-
vidingtheirinformedconsenttoparticipateanonymously,both
experts were given a written description of our methods and
a copy of all results. They were asked to review all materials
and provide feedback as to whether our synthesis was consis-
tent with their own perception of the impact from new can-
cer medicines on clinical therapy in the United States. Please
see the eMethods section in the Supplement for further de-
tails on our methodology as well as a discussion of potential
limitations.
Results
A total of 62 new active cancer molecules were eligible for this
study (Figure 1), 4 of which were approved by the EMA but not
the FDA through May, 2015. Molecule descriptors are pro-
vided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Of those 62 drugs, 53
(85%) were assessed for OS by at least 1 of the 3 international
HTA agencies considered through May, 2015. The remaining
9 molecules may have been evaluated after our study end-
date, not have been reviewed by HTA agencies if considered
low-priority,33 or may have been rejected by European (EMA)
or national licensing authorities. Of the 53 drugs that were in-
cluded in this study, 35 drugs were assessed by all 3 agencies,
7 were assessed by 2, and 11 were assessed by 1 agency. In most
cases, HTA agency assessments were based on the same set
of comparators (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Overall Survival
Of the 53 drugs that were evaluated, 23 (43%) were con-
firmed by at least 1 HTA agency to increase OS by at least 3
months, though an exact magnitude of increase could not be
estimatedbyHTAagenciesfor6ofthese23medicines.Six(11%)
of the 53 drugs increased OS by less than 3 months, and 8 (15%)
produced an increase in OS of unknown magnitude. The re-
maining 16 (30%) cancer drugs did not demonstrate an in-
crease in OS over alternative treatments, either because no dif-
ferencewasfoundorbecauseadeterminationwasnotorcould
not be made by HTA agencies on the basis of the available evi-
dence (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
We examined total gains in OS made over the last decade
by mapping new interventions against the treatment com-
parators that would be replaced, as identified in HTAs
(Figure 2). In all cases where OS gains could be quantified, new
cancer drugs produced a total mean (SE) improvement in OS

of 3.43 (0.63) months (or 0.29 [0.05] years) relative to the treat-
ments that were available in 2003. These benefits, however,
varied across and within different classes of therapeutics. For
instance, drugs indicated for thyroid cancers produced an av-
erage (SE) increment of 0 (0) months in OS; ascites, 0 (0)
months; lung cancers, 2.09 (0.75) months; hematological can-
cers, 2.61 (1.69) months; gastrointestinal cancers, 2.90 (1.12)

(1.05) months; renal cancers, 6.27 (1.92) months; and breast
cancers, 8.48 (3.84) months.
For drugs that were assessed by all 3 agencies, English au-
thorities were most likely to attribute significant OS improve-
ments to new medicines, while Australian authorities were
least likely to do so (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Across the
entire sample, Krippendorff’
s α was 0.38, suggesting a low to
moderate level of agreement in assessments of OS benefits

Development of new cancer medicines (2003-2013), mapped according to
therapeutic comparator used by health technology appraisal agencies in
appraisal documents to assess therapeutic value. “First generation”drugs are
the set of comparators not approved between 2003 and 2013, whereas “third
generation”drugs are those that were evaluated against medications that were
newly licensed in the study period (“
second generation”). Pemetrexeda
represents use for a nonprimary indication—it is therefore considered
independently of the pemetrexed indication that is evaluated in this study.
Survival benefits associated with parallel treatment pathways
(afatinib-erlotinib/gefitinib; ponatinib-nilotinib/dasatinib) are considered
independently of each other, as are those associated with multiple primary
indications (sunitinib). The gain in overall survival (OS) relative to initial
standards of care, for all drugs where marginal increases in OS could be
quantified, is provided with the use of bars that represent the number of
months gained (rounded to nearest integer). If a range of values corresponding
to OS benefits were available across health technology appraisal agencies, an
average was taken. Uncertain increase in OS is represented with a “+”; NE
indicates no established increase in OS.

among all 3 HTA agencies (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Inter-
agency agreement was, however, higher when English evalu-
ations were excluded and for the set of drugs that produced
marginal to no improvement in OS (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). This may suggest that regulators become increasingly
uncertain about claims of drug-related survival benefits as the
magnitude of those claims increases.
Indeed, HTA agency conclusions for 10 of the 23 drugs
that were deemed to increase OS by 3 months or more (ax-
itinib, bosutinib, crizotinib, everolimus, panitumumab,
pazopanib, pomalidomide, sorafenib, sunitinib, and trabec-
tedin) were based on modeled data, indirect comparisons,
or agency opinions. For 5 of the 23 drugs (axitinib, crizo-
tinib, enzalutamide, panitumumab, and pazopanib), signifi-
cant OS benefits were also found relative to 1 treatment
comparator, but were not established in relation to other
possible comparators.
Quality of Life
Of the 53 drugs that were evaluated by at least 1 HTA agency,
22 (42%) improved QoL, 2 (4%) reduced QoL, 1 (2%) was as-
sociated with mixed evidence, and 28 (53%) did not demon-
strate a difference in QoL relative to best alternative treat-
ments (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
As for OS, England’
s HTA agency was most likely to find
that new cancer drugs improved QoL (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). Across the entire sample, there was a moderate to high
level of agreement among HTA agencies in the assessed level
of QoL benefit from new cancer drugs (α, 0.61) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). This suggests that HTA agencies tend to simi-
larly interpret the QoL evidence—more so than that of OS—
and lends confidence to the notion that new cancer drugs are
providing QoL benefits to patients.
Still, not all regulatory opinions were based on robust evi-
dence. Of the 22 drugs that were deemed to improve QoL,
evaluations for 17 were based on a review of empirical evi-
dence,includingdatafromvalidatedQoLinstruments.TheQoL
benefits associated with the remaining 5 drugs (pertuzumab,
trametinib, ziv-aflibercept, sipuleucel-T, and vemurafenib)
were based exclusively on testimony from patient represen-
tatives and clinical experts.
Safety
Eight (15%) of the 53 drugs that were evaluated by HTA agen-
cies were found to improve safety. A far larger share (24, or
45%), however, reduced patient safety. Ten (19%) were asso-
ciated with mixed evidence and 11 (21%) did not demonstrate
any difference in safety compared with alternative treat-
ments (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Mirroring earlier trends for OS, English and Australian au-
thorities were least and most likely to determine that new can-
cer drugs reduced patient safety, respectively (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). Across the entire sample, there was a low level
of agreement between HTA agencies on the impact on safety
from new cancer medicines. This was however driven by a lack
of consensus with Australia’
s HTA agency: interagency agree-
mentwasmoderatetohighwhenlimitedtoEnglishandFrench
assessments (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Clinical Benefits of Treatment
Of the 23 drugs that significantly increased OS by at least 3
months, 15 (65%) were also found to improve QoL, while the
remaining 8 (35%) produced no measurable change. In con-
trast, of the 23 drugs that significantly extended OS, 5 (22%)
improved safety, 11 (48%) reduced safety, 5 (22%) were asso-
ciated with mixed evidence, and 2 (9%) produced no differ-
ence in safety relative to existing standards of care. Most
new cancer medicines that significantly extend life there-
fore also improve QoL, but reduce patient safety (eTable 1 in
the Supplement).
There was a noticeably smaller improvement in QoL in
the drugs that produced marginal to no improvement in OS.
Of the 30 evaluated drugs that did not increase OS by at
least 3 months, 7 (23%) were found to improve QoL, 2 (7%)
worsened QoL, 1 (3%) had a mixed effect, and 20 (67%) were
not associated with any effect on QoL. Safety nevertheless
remained a concern. Of the 30 drugs that did not increase
OS by at least 3 months, 3 (10%) were classified as improv-
ing safety, 13 (43%) reduced patient safety, 5 (17%) were
associated with mixed evidence; the remaining 9 (30%) did
not demonstrate any difference in safety over alternative
treatments.
Across the entire sample, 42 of the 53 new cancer medi-
cines (79%) licensed in the United States and the European
Union between 2003 and 2013, and evaluated by English,
French, and Australian HTA agencies, demonstrated at least
some evidence of an OS, QoL, or safety benefit. These
results were supported by the feedback that we received
from 2 medical experts from the FDA, both of whom gener-
ally agreed with the results that were obtained. One—an
oncologist—stated that the results summarized in eTable 1
in the Supplement were “in line with [his personal] percep-
tions” of the added clinical benefits of the new cancer
medicines.
Discussion
All new cancer drugs licensed between 2003 and 2013 by
the FDA and EMA extended OS by an mean (SE) of 3.43
(0.63) months (0.29 [0.05] years) over the treatments that
were available in 2003. This figure is based on regulatory
assessments and is consistent with those reported by simi-
lar studies.34
While perhaps modest, this OS benefit represents an im-
portant step forward for patients and society, as even minor
improvements in survival can have an effect on reducing mor-
tality at the population level. It is encouraging to therefore find
that most new cancer drugs were associated with some known
(55%) or at least unknown (70%) OS benefit, with the largest
share (43%) extending life by an amount that English and
Australian regulators consider to be clinically meaningful
(≥3 months).
To our knowledge, this analysis is the first to take a sys-
tematic approach to evaluate the OS, QoL, and safety ben-
efits associated with new cancer drugs. Our findings indi-
cate that most newly approved cancer medicines (79%)

increased OS by some known or unknown magnitude, or
demonstrated at least some evidence of improved QoL or
safety over alternative treatments. In general, innovation in
the oncology drug market therefore appears to be bringing
real value to patients and society.
There was evidence to suggest that these benefits are
also concentrated in particular classes of therapeutics. Ten
immunologic drugs were present in our sample, most of
which function by antigenic targeting of cancer cells. Ipili-
mumab was the only drug of a novel class of immunomodu-
lating agents, the immune checkpoint modulators. With the
exception of bevacizumab—which elicits an antiangiogenic
response—immunologic drugs were, on average, better at
extending OS compared to nonimmunologic drugs (5.02 vs
2.30 months). However, this was not true of all immuno-
logic drugs. Perhaps owing to a limited sample size, statisti-
cal testing also showed that this group difference was non-
significant, and that there was no greater effect on quality of
life or safety (data not shown). Ipilimumab was itself associ-
ated with a marginally larger OS benefit (5.7 months).
Future studies may adapt our methodology to examine the
efficacy of the newer immune checkpoint modulators, such
as nivolumab and pembrolizumab.
Thoughperhapspromising,findingsfromthisstudyshould
be interpreted with caution. To validly draw inference on the
impact from new immunologic drugs and other cancer thera-
peutics,thisanalysisshouldberepeatedasthenumberofavail-
ablemoleculesgrows.Acrosstheentiresample,regulatoryevi-
dence is sometimes based on modeled data, nonvalidated
inputs, or comparisons against nontargeted or older active
treatments(eg,BSC,chlorambucil),thoughthismayreflectthe
state of clinical practice. Even if these issues are ignored, in-
teragency agreement on drug-related OS benefits decreases as
the level of benefit increases, indicating that there may be
greateruncertaintyaboutthevaluefromnewcancerdrugsthat
claim to bring the greatest health benefit. And, as shown with
frequentlycontrastingEnglishandAustralianassessments,the
regulatory milieu seems to shape the interpretation of evi-
denceontheclinicalimpactfromnewcancermedicines.These
findings raise important questions about how clinical ben-
efits are measured and used to inform evidence-based policy,
and they give reason to adapt treatment guidelines to the
unique circumstances and preferences of the patient.
Regulators nevertheless often have the authority to re-
quire submission of all applicable clinical data that is "neces-
sary to address the remit and scope of the technology
appraisal."35 To estimate the clinical value of new medicines
in the absence of real-world observational data, the approach
used in this study may therefore be preferable to secondary
reviews of the published scientific literature.
Still, technological assessments may not always accu-
rately reflect the full extent of clinical risks and benefits that
are observed in practice. For instance, as is the case for KRAS
expressionincoloncancer,particulargenomicprofilesarenow
known to predict OS benefits. In part for this reason, gene ex-
pression profiling is increasingly recommended as a tool to
guide chemotherapy decisions.36,37 Since many new antican-
cer drugs target proteins that are downstream of genes with
driver somatic mutations,36 any misapprehension about the
genetic mediators of disease may prevent regulators from fully
appreciating their clinical value. Validated biomarkers in fact
often do not exist to guide the selection of patients in clinical
trials who would most likely benefit from treatment.5 Clini-
cal practice may instead incorporate new evidence on the ge-
netic predictors of response as and when it develops,36 en-
abling personalized and cost-efficient care that optimizes
patientoutcomes.Tobetterrevealthereal-worldbenefitsfrom
new cancer medicines, future studies should therefore peri-
odically repeat this analysis with postmarketing,38 observa-
tional or pragmatic clinical trial evidence. The National Can-
cer Institute’
s upcoming National Cancer Knowledge System
may provide crucial insights in this regard.
Asitstands,1in3(30%)ofallnewlyapprovedcancermedi-
cines are not associated with any OS benefit, while 1 in 5 (20%)
neither extend life nor improve QoL or safety. While perhaps
reflectiveofnonactivecomparisons,theapprovalofnewmedi-
cines for orphan indications with no alternative treatment, or
the growing use of surrogate efficacy endpoints during regu-
latory evaluations,12 these findings suggest that expendi-
tures for up to 1 out of every 5 new cancer drugs may be spent
without any OS, QoL, or safety benefit to the patient.
In the short term, these findings help to inform clinical de-
cision-making by patients and clinicians who, in personaliz-
ing treatment, may have to consider the economic implica-
tions of drug prescriptions alongside individual preferences
for treatment-related risks and benefits. This may be true for
US cancer patients, who typically shoulder high amounts of
cost-sharing, but also if public health systems (eg, England’
s
NHS)donotpubliclyreimbursefornewcancermedicines.Over
the longer term, efforts should be made to develop evidence
on mechanisms to weight clinical outcome measures accord-
ing to their value to patients, and to align these initiatives with
the regulatory review process.

(eg, pertuzumab) have significantly extended life, perhaps giv-
ing reason for large and growing expenditures. Others, how-
ever, appear to bring little to no tangible benefit to health, rais-
ingquestionsaboutthejustificationforadditionalexpenseover
alternative treatments. Though further research is needed, our
analysis may indicate that spending on new cancer drugs is not
always commensurate with their clinical benefits. This may be
reason for patients and clinicians to take pause when consid-
ering new treatments, particularly if related expenditures are
of concern.
Conclusions
Cancer drug innovation over the past decade is, on the whole,
expected to have contributed to improvements in patient OS
andQoL.Thesegains,however,areunevenlydistributedacross
