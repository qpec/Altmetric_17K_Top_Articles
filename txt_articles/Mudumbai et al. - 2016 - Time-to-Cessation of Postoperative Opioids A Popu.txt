Abstract
Objective. This study aims to determine 1) the epide-
miology of perioperative opioid use; and 2) the asso-
ciation between patterns of preoperative opioid use
and time-to-cessation of postoperative opioids.
Design. Retrospective, cohort study.
Setting.
National,
population-level
study
of
Veterans
Healthcare
Administration (VHA)
elec-
tronic clinical data.
Subjects. All VHA patients (n 5 64,391) who under-
went surgery in 2011, discharged after stays of
�1 day, and receiving �1 opioid prescription within
90 days of discharge.
Methods. Patients’ preoperative opioid use were cate-
gorized as 1) no opioids, 2) tramadol only, 3) short-
acting (SA) acute/intermittent ( £ 90 days fill), 4) SA
chronic (> 90 days fill), or 5) any long-acting (LA).
After defining cessation as 90 consecutive, opioid-
free days, the authors calculated time-to-opioid-ces-
sation (in days), from day 1 to day 365, after hospital
discharge. The authors developed extended Cox re-
gression models with a priori identified predictors.
Sensitivity analyses used alternative cessation defini-
tions (30 or 180 consecutive days).
Results. Almost 60% of the patients received preopera-
tive opioids: tramadol (7.5%), SA acute/intermittent
(24.1%), SA chronic (17.5%), and LA (5.2%). For pa-
tients opioid-free preoperatively, median time-to-ces-
sation of opioids postoperatively was 15 days. The SA
acute/intermittent cohort (HR51.96; 95% CI51.92-
2.00) had greater risk for prolonged time-to-cessation
than those opioid-free (reference), but lower risk than
those taking tramadol only, SA chronic (HR5 9.09;
95% CI5 8.33-9.09), or LA opioids (HR5 9.09; 95%
CI5 8.33-10.00). Diagnoses of chronic pain, sub-
stance-use, or affective disorders were weaker positive
predictors. Sensitivity analyses maintained findings.

Introduction
Opioids are widely used for managing perioperative pain
[1–3]. While acute postoperative pain is expected after
surgery, the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain
(CPSP) greatly varies with the type of surgery and may
be associated with postoperative pain severity [3–6].
Opioids dominate CPSP management strategies, includ-
ing the use of long-acting (LA) opioids and escalation to
higher doses [7,8]. While short-term opioid use may
help facilitate recovery and rehabilitation, extended use
is associated with tolerance and physical dependence
[1,9,10]. Recent evidence indicates higher rates of sui-
cide, addiction, opioid diversion, motor vehicle acci-
dents, and accidental overdose in populations with
extended, high-dose opioid use [1,11–15].
Despite widespread use of perioperative opioids, their clini-
cal epidemiology and standards of care remain poorly de-
fined [16,17]. Identifying the patterns of preoperative opioid
use, and the timing and associated predictive factors for
postoperative cessation has been understudied, particu-
larly at the population-relevant levels of thousands of pa-
tients
[2,18].
While
factors,
including
pain
duration,
severity, or an existing diagnosis of post-traumatic stress
disorder, are correlated with opioid use, initial data indicate
preoperative opioid use may be more influential [19,20].
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest
integrated health care system in the United States and
has had a mature electronic health record for nearly two
decades. VHA databases include detailed information
on surgical procedures and medication use that allow
us to examine post-surgical opioid use in great detail
[21]. The objective of this study was to determine 1) the
epidemiology of perioperative opioid use, and 2) the as-
sociation between patterns of preoperative opioid use
and time-to-cessation of postoperative opioids.
Methods
Study Design, Data Sources, and Development of
Study Sample
Our affiliated university Institutional Review Board ap-
proved this study and we received a waiver of written
consent. Using a retrospective cohort study design, our
objective was to define postoperative cessation of opi-
oids in relationship to a range of potential predictors us-
ing extended Cox regression models.
We obtained outpatient and inpatient patient treatment
files, including inpatient surgery and procedure files. We
also obtained prescription level pharmacy data from the
VA Managerial Cost Accounting Office extracts. We exam-
ined surgeries conducted at 120 hospitals within the VHA.
We identified inpatient surgeries in fiscal year (FY) 2011
(October 1, 2010–September 30, 2011) (Figure 1). A surgi-
cal inpatient was defined by a record containing at least
one International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision
(ICD-9) procedure code matching a list of Healthcare Cost
and Utilization Project (HCUP) surgical procedures codes
(see Supplementary Data online Appendix 1). For patients
with multiple surgeries, we used the first qualifying surgery
procedure code. We excluded the following classes of pa-
tients: 1) those admitted before April 1, 2010 or dis-
charged after March 31, 2012 to ensure complete data
(using FY 2010 and 2012 data); 2) those deceased during
stay; 3) those without outpatient opioid prescriptions within
90 days of discharge; 4) non-veterans; 5) those with a
metastatic cancer diagnosis in the year before or after sur-
gery; and 6) those with missing data (e.g., race/ethnicity,

 marital status, and urban/rural status). We required pa-
tients to have filled a prescription for outpatient opioids in
the 90 days post-discharge to ensure they had used VHA
pharmacies for their prescriptions.
Measures
Preoperative Opioid Use Strata
For the 180 days before surgical admission, we evaluated
patterns of opioid prescriptions dispensed and days filled
(Supplementary Data online Appendix 2). We classified pre-
scriptions as long-acting (LA) or short-acting (SA). Patients’
preoperative opioid use were categorized as: 1) no opioids,
2) tramadol only, 3) SA acute/intermittent (only SA opioids
with total day supply of� 90 days), 4) SA chronic (only SA
opioids with total day supply> 90 days), or 5) LA (any
long-acting, with or without accompanying SA opioids).
Postoperative Adjunctive Pharmacotherapy
We created time-dependent indicators for five catego-
ries of postoperative adjunctive pharmacotherapy, in-
cluding 1) non-opioid analgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAID]), 2) serotonin-norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors [SNRI], 3) tricyclic antidepres-
sants, 4) anticonvulsants, and 5) sedatives/hypnotics
(Supplementary Data online Appendix 3). Indicators
were coded 1 if patient received an outpatient prescrip-
tion within a category, starting with the day of their opi-
oid
prescription
until
day
of
cessation;
otherwise
indicators were coded 0.
Factors Potentially Affecting Time-to-Cessation
Using methods developed by prior pharmacoepidemiologic
studies, we defined a chronic-pain patient as having at
least two diagnoses of painful conditions (at least one di-
agnosed in an in-person visit) in the year before admission
and the year after discharge, at least 90 days apart, docu-
mented in outpatient or inpatient files [16,22,23]. Our ad-
ministrative data do not incorporate non-pharmacologic
data such as visual acuity scales (VAS), numerical rating
scales, or clinical interventions for the immediate postoper-
ative period such as patient controlled analgesia or regional
anesthetics. We also determined whether the patient had
a diagnosis for substance-use (excluding nicotine), nicotine
use, bipolar disorder, major depression, post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder
during the year prior to admission. The patient record had
to have had two instances, at least one coming from an
in-person visit (not telephone), of a qualifying diagnostic
code during the time period (Supplementary Data online
Appendix 4).
Surgery Type
Surgery type was the first qualifying ICD-9 surgical pro-
cedure code. We also determined the following: 1) prior
inpatient surgery in the 180 days before admission, 2)
whether the patient had � 30 outpatient visits (on differ-
ent days) in the year before admission, and 3) whether
the total length of the inpatient stay comprising the sur-
gery exceeded 7 days.
Illness Severity and Comorbidity Index
To capture the patient’s illness severity, we used all
ICD-9 diagnosis codes linked with the patient’s surger-
ies to calculate a Charlson comorbidity index (as modi-
fied by Deyo and Quan) [24]. After calculating patient-
level scores and based on their distribution, we further
categorized scores into three levels: 0 (no comorbidities;
38.8% of total patients), 1 (one comorbidity; 22.7% of
total patients), and 2þ (two or more comorbidities;
38.5% of total patients).
Patient Characteristics
We obtained patient demographic information: race,
ethnicity, gender, urban/rural status, homelessness, cur-
rent marital status, and age at surgery.
Outcome Measures: Postoperative
Time-to-Cessation of Opioids
The sample included only patients who were prescribed
outpatient opioids in the 90 consecutive days postopera-
tively. For our primary analysis, we defined cessation as 90
days opioid-free—no current or prior opioid prescription
covered those 90 days. We calculated time-to-cessation
as the number of days from the initiation of opioids postop-
eratively to the last day of taking opioids prior to the 90-
day, opioid-free period. Patients not ceasing within 365
days of initiation of opioids were censored at 365 days.
Outcome variables were 1) whether the patient subse-
quently stopped using opioids postoperatively (yes/no), and
2) time-to-cessation in days. For sensitivity analyses, we a)
varied definition of cessation to either 30 or 180 days opi-
oid-free, and b) evaluated primary findings in three subsets
of patients based on corresponding ICD-9 procedure
codes: cardiac (cardiovascular system), orthopedic (muscu-
loskeletal system), and general surgery (digestive, integu-
mentary, and lymphatic systems) (Supplementary Data
online Appendix 1).
Statistical Analysis
After calculating descriptive statistics for each preopera-
tive opioid-use stratum, we used chi-square tests to de-
termine differing clinical and demographic characteristics
within each stratum. Each stratum was characterized ac-
cording to its median time-to- cessation of opioids post-
operatively. We graphed Kaplan-Meier survival curves
for the five preoperative opioid-use strata. Using a multi-
variate, extended Cox regression analysis with time-

 dependent
covariates
for
postoperative
adjunctive
pharmacotherapy, we then analyzed the independent ef-
fects of preoperative opioid use on time-to-cessation,
controlling for the following a priori determined factors:
postoperative adjunctive pharmacotherapy, chronic pain,
surgery type, illness severity, demographic factors, and
substance-use and mental-health diagnoses. The pres-
ence of these controlling factors was entered as yes/no
(i.e., dichotomous) variables in our patient-level regression
models. To enhance comparisons for time-to-cessation
between opioid strata, we took the reciprocal of calcu-
lated hazard ratios, so that hazard ratios> 1.00 would
indicate a progressively higher risk for extended time-to-
cessation. For model evaluation, we used DFbetas for
influential points, and generalized R-squared for model
fit [25].
Sensitivity Analysis
We repeated the Cox regression for the alternate defini-
tions
of
ceasing
opioids.
For
each
definition,
we
graphed the hazard-rate ratios for the preoperative opi-
oid-use patterns. We also evaluated our primary findings
in three subsets of patients: cardiac, orthopedic, and
general surgery. All reported p-values were two-sided; a
p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
We used SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA) for the statistical analyses and R soft-
ware, version 3.0 .2, to prepare the graphics.
Results
After applying exclusion criteria to our initial sample
(n¼ 98,598), the final sample comprised 64,391 patients.
Our final sample was largely male (94%), white (80%), ur-
ban (61%), and older (79%, age 55þ). Over half of the
sample had chronic pain, both in the year before (59%)
and after (57%) surgery. The comorbidity burden was
high (38% with Charlson score > 2). The prevalence of
substance use (10%), nicotine use (16%), major depres-
sion (7%), and PTSD (12%) diagnoses was substantial.
Characteristics for each opioid stratum, included in Table
1 as percentages, were calculated by dividing the num-
ber of patients with each characteristic by the total num-
ber of patients within each opioid stratum.
Patients varied widely in their preoperative opioid use:
opioid-free (45.7%, n ¼ 29,419), tramadol only (7.5%,
n ¼ 4,849), SA acute/intermittent (24.1%, n ¼ 15,444),
SA
chronic
(17.5%,
n ¼ 11,259),
and
LA
(5.2%,
n ¼ 3,320). Chi-square tests for differences between the
strata were statistically significant for all clinical and de-
mographic characteristics. Greater levels of opioid bur-
den preoperatively were characterized by higher rates of
postoperative adjunctive pharmacotherapy, higher rates
of chronic pain in pre- and postoperative periods,
greater likelihood of a prior inpatient surgery, greater
numbers of preoperative outpatient visits, longer hospital
stays, younger age, white race, and a substance use or
mental health diagnosis. For all five strata, the top three
surgery types were musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and
digestive (Figure 2).
Time-to-Cessation
For patients opioid-free preoperatively, the median time-
to-cessation postoperatively was 15 days (IQR ¼ 10-41)
(Table 2, Figure 3). Greater levels of preoperative opioid
use were associated with longer median times-to-ces-
sation; the longest median times (days) were noted for
the SA chronic (365; IQR: 259-365) and LA (365; 323-
365) strata. The median times for these groups reflect
the fact that over half of the patients in these groups
did not cease opioids within the first 365 days after sur-
gery and thus were censored at 365 days. Thus, actual
median times to cessation for these groups would ex-
ceed 365 days.
Predictive Factors for Extended Postoperative
Time-to-Cessation
We
standardized
differences
in
the
prevalence
of
comorbidities across various opioid strata by conducting
a patient-level regression analysis that incorporated the
presence of key comorbidities (i.e., diagnosis of chronic
pain) and the patient’s Charlson score. Preoperative opi-
oid use was the strongest predictor of extended time-
to-cessation of postoperative opioids (Table 3). Pre-op-
erative use of SA opioids on an acute/intermittent basis
(HR ¼1.96; 95% CI ¼1.92-2.00) was associated with
substantially greater risk than taking no opioids (refer-
ence), but lower risk than those taking tramadol only
(HR ¼ 3.03; 95% CI ¼ 2.94-3.13), SA chronic (HR ¼
9.09; 95% CI ¼8.33-9.09), or LA opioids (HR ¼ 9.09;
95% CI ¼ 8.33-10.00). Relative to preoperative opioid
strata, the presence of diagnoses of chronic pain (HR ¼
1.49; 95% CI ¼ 1.47-1.54), substance-use (HR ¼ 1.01;
95% CI ¼ 0.97-1.04), or various affective disorders had
hazard ratios closer to 1. Similar hazard ratios closer to
1 were found with other associated factors: longer
length of stays; postoperative adjunctive pharmacother-
apy (e.g., non-opioid analgesics); musculoskeletal, ner-
vous,
or
respiratory
surgical
type;
higher
levels
of
comorbidities; younger age; residence in a rural area;
homelessness; and nicotine diagnosis. DFbetas showed
no influential points. The generalized R-squared ¼ 0.41
indicated strong relationship between the covariates
and our dependent variable.
Sensitivity Analyses
The numbers of patients identified as ceasing opioids var-
ied within the alternate opioid-free definitions of either 30
or 180 days. However, these definitions had little effect on
the relative hazard rates for the five strata (Supplementary
Data online Appendix 5). Similarly, in three subsets of our
patients (cardiac, orthopedic, and general surgery; Table
4), minor impact on the relative hazard rate ratios for the
covariates was noted.

 Discussion
A high proportion of patients presenting for surgery
within the VA are already taking opioids preoperatively.
Our findings demonstrate that the patterns of preoper-
ative opioid use are stronger predictors for postopera-
tive time-to-cessation of opioids than diagnoses of
chronic pain, substance use or affective disorders.
Compared to opioid-free patients who ceased opioids
a median of 15 days after surgery, the use of preoper-
ative short- or long-acting opioids is associated with
median times-to-cessation of longer than one year after
surgery.
Our findings are pertinent to clinical practice, given the
risks
associated
with

and

may perioperatively experience poorly controlled pain
and cognitive dysfunction [26,27]. Additionally, although
we lack outcomes data related to perioperative opioid
use, higher doses of preoperative opioids have been
linked to worse functional outcomes after total knee re-
placement and cervical spine surgery [28,29]. As opioid
use lengthens, a patient may disconnect medication use
from the need for pain relief, with progression to depen-
dence or addiction, increasing risks for overdose, falls,
motor vehicle accidents, and all-cause mortality [30].
Although potential mechanisms underlying links be-
tween preoperative opioid use and prolonged time-to-
cessation
postoperative
use
are
speculative,
data
indicate that patients taking opioids may experience
pain sensitization due to modified peripheral and central
pain pathways, so-called opioid-induced hyperalgesia
(OIH) [31,32]. Tolerance of opioids may also reinforce
pill-taking behaviors, thereby encouraging further pre-
scription opioid use [33]. Linkages between pre- and
extended postoperative opioid use should also account
for postoperative pain relief management strategies
given their potential impact on opioid use [6,34]. While
the foundation of immediate postoperative pain therapy
remains
opioids,
in
many
practices
multimodal
approaches are being implemented. For example, the
use of non-opioid pharmacologic therapy such as acet-
aminophen or NSAIDs, and local and regional anesthe-
sia (peripheral nerve blocks with or without perineural
catheters; epidural catheters) may affect discontinuation
of opioids. Initial evidence indicates that preemptive an-
algesia may affect central sensitization of pain pathways
and later utilization of opioids [30,31]. More research,
however, is needed to elucidate mechanisms linking
pre- and extended postoperative opioid use.
Our results are generally consistent with those of other
studies that used smaller sample sizes, fewer patient
characteristics, and different study endpoints: preopera-
tive opioid use was repeatedly found to be one of the
strongest risk factors for ongoing postoperative opioid
use [19,20]. Our novel models moreover controlled for
factors such as adjunctive pain pharmacotherapy that
may modify time-to-cessation as well as surgical type,
sociodemographic factors, and the comorbidity burden
of patients [30,35]. In our sample, the proportion of pa-
tients with baseline preoperative opioid use was 54%
[34,972/64,391], whereas Carroll et al.’s was 21% [21/
103] and Rozet et al’s was 43% [63/145] [19,20]. Our
sample proportion, while substantial, reflects several
factors: sampling a nationwide cohort across multiple
facilities, evaluation of multiple surgery types, and a con-
siderable prevalence of chronic pain in VHA cohorts
accompanied by a dramatic increase in opioid prescrip-
tions within the VHA over the past decade [36]. In
addition, our study (defining cessation as 90 days opi-
oid-free) found median times-to-cessation that were up
to 2-5 times longer than with Carroll et al. [19]. These
contrasting findings suggest that not only may time-to-
cessation vary across different surgery types, but that
populations like the VA with higher baseline opioid use
may generally have longer postoperative opioid-use du-
rations. In addition, surgical patients likely also represent
a heterogeneous group based on type of preoperative
usage. For long-term opioid users, patterns of preopera-
tive opioids may be more important as a predictive fac-
tor
because
opioids
may
be
habituated
and
less
correlated with pain. Regardless, our initial results de-
serve further population-level study in non-VA cohorts.
Our
results
have
two
immediate
implications
for
perioperative clinical management.

 First, rather than solely considering whether patients are
prescribed opioids or are opioid-free prior to surgery,
additional stratification according to types of opioids
and usage patterns may be necessary to identify pa-
tients at risk for extended opioid use. Our opioid strata-
which involved both SA and LA opioids and duration of
fills (i.e., 90 days) accounted for existing joint VHA and
Department of Defense 2010 guidelines (Table 5) and
definitions of chronic opioid use [2,22,37,38]. The guide-
lines were developed in the context of a 300-400% in-
crease in opioid prescriptions from 1999-2010 within
the VHA and to help manage opioid risks [36]. These
guidelines address initiation, titration, and maintenance
of opioid therapy and promoted the role of SA opioids
and
tramadol
within
opioid-initiation
strategies.
However, beyond types of opioids, these guidelines en-
couraged the transition to LA opioids after 90 days of
opioid use. That 17.5% of our sample was in the SA-
chronic opioid stratum suggests this may be difficult to
follow in practice and needs accounting in risk stratifica-
tion. In addition, another contributory factor for the size
of the SA-chronic stratum may be the relative overpre-
scribing of opioids from 1999-2010. Our results also in-
dicate that with both the LA and SA-chronic opioid
strata having similar risks for time-to-cessation, consis-
tency of opioid use appears more important than opioid
pharmacokinetics for extended use [2].
Second, interventions in both the pre- and postoperative
period may be needed to modify the risk of an ex-
tended, postoperative time-to-cessation. As efforts are
under way to develop the Perioperative Surgical Home,
our results support roles for the anesthesiologist/perio-
perativist and surgeons in the optimization of periopera-
tive opioids, chronic postoperative pain, and long-term
outcomes [39]. Preoperatively, providers can help pa-
tients transition to lower-risk strata by promoting opioid
“holidays,”
encouraging
pre-habilitation
to
decrease
postoperative opioid requirements, and the use of cog-
nitive therapy to modify opioid utilization [30,40]. It may
be helpful for patients and surgeons to discuss postop-
erative opioid use and pain management strategies.

Cessation was defined as 90 days without coverage by a current or prior opioid prescription. Larger hazard ratios indicate in-
creased risk of extended time-to-cessation postoperatively. SA ¼ short-acting, LA ¼ long-acting. We identified five, opioid-use
strata based on patterns of opioid use in the 180 days before admission: 1) no opioid use, 2) use of tramadol only, 3) use of only
short-acting (SA) opioids with a total day supply of � 90 days: SA-acute/intermittent, 4) use of only SA opioids with a total day
supply > 90 days: SA-chronic, and 5) use of any long-acting (LA) opioid (with or without accompanying SA opioids).

 Since surgery alone may not change patterns of opioid
use, focused efforts on opioid use reduction should be
made if reduced use is a specific goal for the patient.
Data indicate that discontinuation of opioids is notori-
ously difficult to conduct, particularly in patients who
chronically use opioids and with large daily total mor-
phine equivalent doses [41]. Tapering to lower doses or
transitioning to tramadol may be easier, given potential
lower risks of overdose [2,41]. We noted that preopera-
tive tramadol users tended to have prolonged postoper-
ative opioid use, a finding consistent with the perception
that tramadol may be useful for patients with mild to
moderate pain and at risk for chronic opioid use [37].
Postoperatively, providers can identify patients in higher
opioid risk strata and those with other predictive factors
(i.e., longer lengths of stay, Black, rural, homeless) for
earlier follow-up and evaluation. Primary-care providers
may be then alerted and opioid risk mitigation strategies
implemented earlier [42]. To decrease opioid require-
ments,
providers
may
prescribe
earlier
adjunctive
pharmacotherapy, rehabilitation, cognitive-based thera-
pies, and complementary-medicine regimens such as
acupuncture [2]. Follow up studies to ours should evalu-
ate postoperative transitions to different opioid formula-
tions and doses. Our results also indicated that nicotine
disorder was a significant, independent factor for ex-
tended time-to-cessation. While we found nicotine’s ef-
fect size relatively small, our results suggest that future
investigators evaluate nicotine’s role in time-to-cessation
within different surgery types [43].
Limitations
This study has several limitations: 1) Because the study
was retrospective, the reader should carefully consider
any conclusions regarding causality. To address this lim-
itation, we focused on the post-discharge period when
the contribution of preoperative opioids would be most
relevant. We also extensively adjusted for factors that
could affect time-to-cessation. 2) Selection bias, based
on patient characteristics, may have also affected how
patients were treated postoperatively. To minimize this
bias, we selected all patients who underwent surgery
within one year. We also evaluated multiple surgery
types: neuro-, orthopedic, and cardiac. 3) Our study re-
lied on administrative data to describe the patterns of
opioid discontinuation in a broad, epidemiologic, popu-
lation-level study. Although we obtained pharmacy data
including type of medication and prescription details, we
were unable to verify that patients were actually taking
their opioids or why patients were discontinued from
their opioids. In particular, our examination of the poten-
tial factors that could modify time to cessation of post-
operative opioid use (affective disorder, substance use,
and chronic pain) relied on administrative measures. We
did not capture clinical level data for acute and chronic
pain including VAS scales, the use of patient controlled
analgesia, and regional anesthetics that would have po-
tentially modified our conclusions. 4) Because our study
population is within the VHA, whose patients are pre-
dominately male, older, with substantial prevalence for
chronic pain, it may not represent populations at lower
risk for extended opioid use.
In summary, preoperative opioid use is a stronger predic-
tor for time-to-cessation of postoperative opioids than the
presence of diagnoses of chronic pain, substance-use
disorder or affective-disorders. However, the impact of
the amount and type of immediate postoperative pain re-
lief strategies on time-to-cessation requires further clarifi-
cation. If preoperative opioid status may be a modifiable
risk factor for extended opioid use, our study suggests
that efforts focused on the optimization of patients’ opioid
status prior to surgery are necessary [2,39,44–46].
