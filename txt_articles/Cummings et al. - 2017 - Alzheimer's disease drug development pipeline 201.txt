Abstract
Introduction: There is an urgent need to develop new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
to understand the drug development process for new AD therapies.
Methods: We assessed the agents in the AD pipeline as documented in clinicaltrials.gov for phase I,
phase II, and phase III, accessed 1/5/2017.
Results: There are 105 agents in the AD treatment development pipeline, of which 25 agents are in
29 trials in phase I, 52 agents are in 68 trials in phase II, and 28 agents are in 42 trials in phase III.
Seventy percent of drugs in the AD pipeline are disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Fourteen
percent are symptomatic cognitive enhancers, and 13% are symptomatic agents addressing neuropsy-
chiatric and behavioral changes (2% have undisclosed mechanisms). Most trials are sponsored by the
biopharmaceutical industry. Trials include patients with preclinical AD (cognitively normal with
biomarker evidence of AD), prodromal AD (mild cognitive symptoms and biomarker evidence of
AD), and AD dementia. Biomarkers are included in many drug development programs particularly
those for DMTs. Thirteen of 46 phase II DMT trials have amyloid imaging as an entry criterion,
and 10 of 28 phase III trials incorporate amyloid imaging for diagnosis and entry. A large number
of participants are needed for AD clinical trials; in total, 54,073 participants are required for trials
spanning preclinical AD to AD dementia. When compared with the 2016 pipeline, there are eight
new agents in phase I, 16 in phase II, and five in phase III.
Discussion: The AD drug development pipeline has 105 agents divided among phase I, phase II, and
phase III. The trials include a wide range of clinical trial populations, many mechanisms of action,
and require a substantial number of clinical trial participants. Biomarkers are increasingly used in
patient identification and as outcome measures, particularly in trials of DMTs.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing rapidly in frequency
as the world’s population ages and more people enter the ma-
jor risk period for this age-related disorder. From the 5.3
million US citizens affected now, the number of victims
will increase to 13 million or more by 2050; worldwide
the total number of affected individuals will increase to a
staggering 100 million [1]. The cost of care in the US,
currently more than $200 billion annually, will grow to an
unsupportable $1 trillion annually by 2050 [1].
New therapies are urgently needed to treat affected patients
and to prevent, defer, slow the decline, or improve the symp-
toms of AD. It has been estimated that the overall frequency
of the disease would be decreased by nearly 50% if the onset
of the disease could be delayed by 5 years [2]. Symptomatic

 treatments are drugs aimed at cognitive enhancement or con-
trol of neuropsychiatric symptoms and typically work
through neurotransmitter mechanisms; disease-modifying
therapies or treatments (DMTs) are agents that prevent,
delay, or slow progression and target the underlying patho-
physiologic mechanisms of AD [3].
To understand the progress of drug development, describe the
timelines regarding when drugs could become available, and
interrogate the current drug development approaches for AD
treatments, we examined the AD drug development pipeline
as currently revealed in clinicaltrials.gov. We present our find-
ings as a means of understanding and ultimately improving
AD drug development. This paper continues the themes
developed in our 2016 pipeline report [4] and impacts the un-
derstanding of the likelihood of reaching the national goal of
having meaningful therapy for AD by 2025 [5].
1. Methods
Clinicaltrials.gov includes a comprehensive list of all
clinical trials of AD and describes the trial features in text
form. The “Common Rule” governing clinicaltrials.gov
was updated in 2016 [6,7]. Registration is mandated for all
trials from sponsors with an Investigational New Drug or
Investigational New Device. Trials must be submitted to
the site within 21 days of the enrollment of the first trial
participant. Results must be submitted to clincaltrials.gov
within 12 months of completion of final data collection for
the prespecified primary outcome measures; clinicaltrials.
gov can be regarded as a comprehensive resource for the
study of clinical trials governed by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) or the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). Not all non-US trials are registered on clinical
trials.gov—especially phase I trials. We also cannot attest
to compliance with the rule governing clinicaltrials.gov,
and some agents may not be registered or sponsors may
not adhere to required timelines.
We examined clinicaltrials.gov as of January 5, 2017. We
captured all trials of all agents in phases I, II, and III. In a
comprehensive database, we entered the trial title, beginning
date, projected end date, calculated duration, number of sub-
jects planned to be enrolled, number of arms of the study (usu-
ally a placebo arm and one or more treatment arms with
different doses of the experimental agent), whether a
biomarker was described, and sponsorship by a biopharma
company, NIH, academic medical center, “other” entity
suchasaconsortiumoraphilanthropicorganization,oracom-
bination of the aforementioned sponsors. We included trials
that were recruiting, active but not recruiting (e.g., trials that
have completed recruiting and are continuing as the efficacy
or safety of the agent is being determined), enrolling by invi-
tation,and not yet recruiting. We did not include trials listed as
completed,terminated,suspended, or withdrawn. Information
on these trials or the reasons for suspension or termination is
often incomplete. The choice of types of trials included was
informed by our intention of understanding the currently
active pipeline and to know what agents could evolve in the
near term. We did not include trials of nonpharmacologic ther-
apeutic approaches such as devices, cognitive therapies, and
medical food. We did not include trials of biomarkers.
The mechanism of action (MOA) of each agent was deter-
mined from the information on clinicaltrials.gov (e.g., the
mechanism is often noted in the title of the trial or in a descrip-
tion of the trial) or from a comprehensive search of the litera-
tureifthe mechanism wasnotprovidedonthefederalwebsite.
In a few cases, the mechanism is undisclosed and could not be
identified in the literature. We grouped the mechanisms into
symptomatic agents or DMTs. We divided the symptomatic
agents into those that are putative cognitive enhancing agents
or those that address neuropsychiatric and behavioral symp-
toms. DMTs were divided into those that target amyloid-
related mechanisms, those that have tau-related MOAs, and
those with “other” mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory
MOAs, growth factors, or metabolic effects. Stem cell thera-
pies were included in the “other” category.
2. Results
2.1. Overview
Fig. 1 provides an overview of all agents currently in the
AD pipeline. The circles reveal the stages of development
(I, II, and III), the colors pertain to the MOA of the agent,
and the shape denotes the population in which the agent is
being tested (normal volunteers, cognitive normal at-risk in-
dividuals, prodromal AD, and AD dementia).
In all, there are 105 agents in the pipeline as shown on
clinicaltrials.gov, of which 25 are agents in 29 trials in phase
I, 52 agents are in 68 trials in phase II, and 28 agents are in 42
trials in phase III. Across all stages, 70% are DMTs, 14% are
symptomatic cognitive enhancers, 13% are symptomatic
agents addressing neuropsychiatric and behavioral changes,
and 2% have undisclosed MOAs.
Of all trials, 65.5% are sponsored by the biopharma indus-
try, 16.6% by Academic Medical Centers, 3.6% by Academic
Medical Center-NIH collaborations, and 10.8% by the collab-
orations between consortiums/philanthropic organizations
and one or more of the following: biopharma, NIH, and
Academic Medical Centers. One trial is sponsored by NIH,
one trial by biopharma-NIH collaboration, and one trial by
a biopharma-NIH-Academic Medical Center collaboration.
2.2. Phase I
Phase I first-in-human trials are generally conducted in
healthy volunteers unless they are assessing immunother-
apies where the potential long-term modification of the im-
mune system makes participation of normal controls
impermissible. These trials generally progress from single
ascending dose trials where increasing doses are adminis-
tered once in supervised settings to assess tolerability and
establish a maximum tolerated dose to multiple ascending
dose trials where individuals receive doses for 14 to

s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions 3 (2017) 367-384
368
 28 days [8–10]. Single and multiple ascending dose studies
typically include cohorts of 6 to 12 individuals assigned
asymmetrically to drug or placebo (e.g., four on placebo
and eight on drug in a 12-person cohort). The goal of phase
I trials is to assess the safety and tolerability of the agent,
identify the doses to be advanced to phase II, and document
the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the drug (e.g., half-life, time to
maximum serum concentration [T-max], maximum serum
concentration
for
each
dose
[C-max],
bioavailability,
dose-blood level linearity, etc). PK studies are conducted
in animals before phase I but must be repeated in the first-
in-human setting to establish the PK characteristics specific
to men and women. Food effects on drug absorption and
drug-drug interactions are also assessed in phase I studies.
A cohort of healthy elderly is often included to assess the
effect of age on PK parameters. In phase I/II studies, a cohort
of individuals with AD may be included.
Of the 24 agents whose MOA was revealed in phase I in
2017 (Fig. 1; Table 1), 12 were directed at amyloid-related
targets including eight immunotherapies, three had tau-
related MOAs, and nine had other mechanisms including
four symptomatic cognitive enhancers. Overall, there were
20 DMTs and four symptomatic agents in phase I. The
MOA was not revealed for one agent.
Phase I trials were on average 755 days in duration
(recruitment and treatment period) and involved 68 patients
in each trial.
2.3. Phase II
Phase II trials advance the agents from phase I to trial
populations of patients with AD. The goal of these trials is
to establish preliminary efficacy based on a biomarker
outcome, a clinical measure, or a combination of clinical
and
biomarker
outcomes
[11,12].
Phase
IIa
trials
concentrate on efficacy, and phase IIb trials further refine
dosing decisions about the number of doses to be
advanced to phase III. Of the 68 trials in phase II of the

 AD pipeline, 21 included patients with prodromal or
prodromal and mild AD, 26 were trials for mild-moderate
AD, one included patients with prodromal or mild-
moderate AD, and one trial was for mild-moderate or severe
AD. Of the symptomatic trials, 10 were for mild-moderate
AD and six were for mild-moderate or severe AD.
On average, phase II trials were 1140 days in duration
(recruitment plus exposure period) and involved 151 patients
in each trial.
Of the 52 agents in the 68 trials, there were 36 DMTs, eight
cognitive enhancing agents, seven drugs for behavioral symp-
toms, and one agent with an unknown MOA (Fig. 1; Table 2).
AmongtheDMTs,14addressedamyloidtargets,fourinvolved
tau-relatedtargets, one addressedbothamyloid andtau-related
targets, and 17 had other MOAs (e.g., metabolic, or anti-
inflammatory). The DMTs include six immunotherapies
(four addressing amyloid and two addressing tau). Of the
DMTs, 17 are repurposed agents approved for use in another
indication.There areseven trials involvingstem cellprograms.
Of the drugs with amyloid targets, there were three b-site
amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibi-
tors, four immunotherapies, and eight anti-aggregation
agents. Fig. 2 shows the MOAs of agents in phase II.
2.4. Phase III
Phases II and III trials are often called “learn” and
“confirm” trials, respectively, with phase III intended to
confirm effects observed in phase II in larger populations
treated for longer periods of time [11,13]. In addition to
providing crucial efficacy data, phase III trials also provide
exposuredataonlargernumbersofpatient-daysessentialtoes-
tablishing the safety and tolerability of the candidate therapy.
Of the 28 agents in the 42 trials, there were 18 DMTs,
three cognitive enhancing agents, and seven drugs for behav-
ioral symptoms. Among the DMTs, 15 addressed amyloid
targets, one involved a tau-related target, and two had a
metabolic MOA. The DMTs include six immunotherapies
(all addressing amyloid). Of the DMTs, four are repurposed
agents approved for use in another indication. Of the drugs
with amyloid targets, there were five BACE inhibitors, six
immunotherapies,
and
four
anti-aggregation
agents.
Table 3 shows the agents currently in phase III of AD drug
development. Fig. 3 shows the MOAs of agents in phase
III and Fig. 4 shows an illustration of the drug mechanism
of phase III agents and the proposed biology of AD.
Among the DMT trials, there were five prevention trials
enrolling cognitively normal participants at high risk for
developing AD in the course of the trials; 14 trials of patients
with prodromal AD (those with minimal cognitive symp-
toms and a biomarker indicative of AD-related brain
changes) or prodromal/mild AD; and nine trials of patients
with mild-moderate AD.
On average, phase III trials involved 1012 patients and
were 1677 days in duration (including the recruitment and
the treatment period). When divided by MOA, DMT trials
were 1948 days long (945.84 treatment days) and included
1212 patients. Cognitive enhancer trials were 1114 days

 long (215.81 treatment days) and involved 1044 patients.
Trials of drugs for behavioral symptoms are 1146 days
long (113.61 treatment days) and included 372 patients.
For all DMTs, the average duration of therapy is 135 weeks;
the average period from trial initiation to primary comple-
tion date (final data collection date for primary outcome
measure) is 246 weeks. This indicates that 111 weeks
(.2 years) is the average anticipated recruitment time. On
average, prevention trials recruiting cognitively normal indi-
viduals at risk for AD are 363 weeks in duration; trials
entering patients with prodromal/prodromal-mild AD are
278 weeks in duration; and trials for patients with
mild-moderate AD are 231 weeks in duration. Anticipated
recruitment periods for these three types of trials are
134 weeks, 105 weeks, and 107 weeks, respectively.
2.5. Participant numbers
Recruitment is the slowest and most expensive aspect of
clinical trials [14]. The period of recruitment may exceed the
period of treatment in the clinical trial cycle. The total
number of participants needed to populate all clinical trials
for AD is large. Table 4 shows the number of participants
needed for all current prevention trials, phase I, phase II,
and phase III trials.
2.6. Biomarkers
Biomarkershave many roles in clinical trials including iden-
tifyingpatientsfortrialsandverifyingdiagnosis,assessingtarget
engagement and providing proof of pharmacology, serving as
outcomes for DMT trials, and assessing side effects (e.g.,
monitoring amyloid-related imaging abnormalities [ARIAs]
observed with some immunotherapies) [14–17]. ARIA has
emerged as a concern in several major immunotherapy
development programs–bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, and
aducanumab. Although largely asymptomatic, these changes
can lead to permanent neurologic sequelae and will be a focus
of research once the efficacy of the immunotherapies is
established. Preliminary evidence suggests that longer dose
titration periods may decrease the risk of ARIAs [18].
Not all trial descriptions in clinicalrials.gov note if bio-
markers are used. Table 5 shows the biomarkers used as
outcome measures in current phase II and phase III AD clin-
ical trials as included in the federal website. Of the 28 phase
III DMT trials, 10 trials use amyloid positron emission to-
mography (PET) as an entry criterion, two use cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) amyloid, and two use either amyloid PETor CSF
amyloid. Thirteen out of 46 phase II DMT trials used
amyloid-PET as an entry criterion.
2.7. Comparison to 2016 pipeline
In any 1-year period, there is relatively little movement in
the AD pipeline. Compared to 2016, there are eight new
agents in phase I, 16 in phase II, and five in phase III. Of
the new agents in phase II, three of the 16 were previously

NOTE. Twenty-five agents in 29 phase I clinical trials currently ongoing as of January 5, 2017 according to clinicaltrials.gov. Bolded 5 new entries into the 2017 phase I pipeline.

 present in phase I (AADvac1, CT1812, and LY3202626). Of
the new agents in phase III, two of the five were previously
noted in phase II (crenezumab and E2609).
Agents can appear in phase II without having been listed
in phase I because the phase I study was not done in the US
and was not registered on clinicaltrials.gov or because they
are repurposed agents that had the PK and dosing established
through trials for a non-AD indication [15,19,20]. Rarely, a
repurposed agent can enter directly into phase III without a
phase II trial. In the AD pipeline, there are 18 repurposed
agents in phase II and nine in phase III.
Seven agents were listed in phase II in 2016 and are not
listed in phase I, II, or III in 2017. These agents have at least
temporarily exited the drug development pipeline. Four tri-
als for the following agents were completed in 2016 but
are not listed in the 2017 pipeline: exenatide, PXT00864,
RO4602522, and RPh201. Two trials were terminated
(MK-7622 and PF-05212377), and the trial status for metfor-
min changed to “unknown” because it has not been updated
for more than 2 years on clinicaltrials.gov.
One agent (masitinib) was listed in phase III in 2016 and
is not listed in phase I, II, or III in 2017. Its trial status
changed to “unknown” because it has not been updated on
clinicaltrials.gov since 2013. Development of this agent
has been at least temporarily interrupted.
Candidate agents that are no longer evident in the pipeline
may have failed to demonstrate efficacy in well-conducted
trials, they may have failed to show efficacy in trials whose
features suggest the trials were not well conducted, or there
may be industry reasons for halting the program (e.g., insuf-
ficient funding, reprioritization of agents in development,
change in company business agenda, and management deci-
sion after assessment of the competitive landscape) [21].
3. Discussion
There is a modest pipeline of drugs in development for
AD. Most candidate therapies are DMTs (70% across all
phases), and the remainder are symptomatic agents directed
at cognitive enhancement (14%) or treatment of neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms (13%) and agents with undisclosed
MOAs (2%). This closely resembles the pipeline as it ap-
peared in 2016 where 73% were DMTs, 18% cognitive
enhancers, and 9% psychotropic agents [4]. There are eight
new agents in phase I, 16 in phase II, and five in phase III.
From the 2016 pipeline, several agents have exited and not
yet reappeared including six in phase I, seven in phase II,
and one in phase III. Leuco-methylthioninium (LMTM)
(or TRx0237) derived from methylene blue and addressing
tau aggregation completed its phase III trials in 2016 and
failed to meet prespecified outcomes of the trial [22]; how-
ever, its open-label extension study is listed as ongoing.
The shortcomings of clinicaltrials.gov as a database are
important to recognize when considering the data presented
here. Not all phase I trials, especially those conducted outside
the US, may be registered, and our phase I data may underes-
timate the number of phase I candidates. Trials are required to
be registered within 21 days of entering the first patient into

 the trial [7], but not all sponsors meet this deadline. The data
provided may not represent the entire universe of AD drug
development [23]. We stopped entering new data into our
database at a time that allowed submission, peer review,
and publication; the data presented are a few months out-
of-date (data collection stopped January 5, 2017). Neverthe-
less, the FDA Modernization Act requires all trials to be
registered and the International Committee of Medical Jour-
nal Editors requires trials to be registered to be eligible for
publication [24]. The clinicaltrials.gov database is accept-
ably comprehensive—the most complete of any existing
database—and a sound basis for drawing conclusions about
AD drug development with the caveats mentioned here.
Phase I is not the only source of compounds for phases II
and III. Agents repurposed from other indications may have
MOAs worthy of exploration in AD. Antihypertensive
agents, statins, anti-inflammatory agents, calcium channel
blockers, and agents with many other MOAs have been pro-
posed as drugs with effects possibly useful in treating AD and
can enter AD drug development pipelines at phase II or phase
III [15,19,20]. Psychiatric agents are commonly developed in
non-AD populations (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizo-
phrenia) before being assessed in AD patients. Safety, toler-
ability, PK, and dosing observations of phase I may be
available from studies conducted for the initial indication.
Thus, the phase I observations provided here may not entirely
forecast the compounds available for phase II and phase III.
Nevertheless, the intellectual property challenges of repur-
posed compounds such as short-patent life limit biopharma
interest in these agents, and only a modest number of repur-
posed agents are represented in the AD drug development
pipeline (18 in phase II and six in phase III). The small num-
ber of phase I compounds is a concern for the overall health of
the AD drug development pipeline.
A striking observation derived from these data is the long
recruitment period anticipated for phase III DMTs. The
anticipated recruitment period is often longer than the treat-
ment period, and in many cases, these planned recruitment
goals are not met [25,26]. Prevention trials require more
time to recruit than prodromal trials (133.5 weeks and
105.4 weeks, respectively) and mild-moderate AD trials
(106.9 weeks). Slow recruitment is among the greatest chal-
lenges to efficiency of AD drug development [14]. This
observation underlies recent efforts in the AD drug develop-
ment arena to advance new methods for patient recruitment
including electronic engagement of potential participants,
creation of registries of candidate subjects, and providing
transportation, neighborhood vans, and insurance-based
referral mechanisms to facilitate subject recruitment and
shorten drug development timelines [27,28].
Adauntingconclusionfromthis reviewofclinicaltrials.gov
is the large number of participants required to conduct the tri-
als. Registered preclinical AD trials will require 8239 partici-
pants; trials of prodromal or prodromal/mild populations
require 22,009 participants; trials of mild to moderate AD de-
mentia are forecasted to require 22,253 participants; and trials
in severe AD dementia will require 588 participants. In total,
54,073 participants will be required to complete the current
AD trials. Trial recruitment is among the slowest and most
expensive of all aspects of clinical trial conduct. The recruit-
ment of such large numbers of participants will represent a
substantial challenge to the system, and reforms are necessary
to accelerate clinical trials and enhance recruitment [27,28].
BACE inhibitors are among the most common classes of
molecules in the AD pipeline. Currently, there are 10 phase
II or phase III trials involving BACE inhibitors (Table 6).
The pipeline for BACE inhibitors has emerged only recently
largely because of the challenging structure-activity require-
ments for BACE inhibition; agents need to be large enough
to block BACE’s large active site, while at the same time,
agents need to be small enough to pass through the blood-
brain barrier and lipophilic enough to enter endosomes
where BACE is active [29]. Advances in small-molecule
screening approaches have helped overcome these chal-
lenges and facilitated the entry of a number of BACE inhib-
itors into the pipeline [30]. All the BACE inhibitors currently
in phases II and III trials are small molecules that demon-
strate favorable PK when administered orally. The published
results of phase I testing in both healthy participants and AD
populations have demonstrated robust (45%–95%) reduc-
tions in CSF amyloid b protein (Ab) levels [31]. This degree
of target engagement has not previously been documented
with other anti-amyloid therapies leading some authors to
posit that BACE inhibition represents the first true test of

 the amyloid hypothesis [32]. Based on strong biomarker
data, some BACE inhibitors have bypassed phase II testing
moving directly from phase I into phase III trials. As a result,
little is known about the clinical efficacy or safety of long-
term BACE inhibition. The first BACE inhibitor trial to be
tested in phase III in an AD dementia population was
recently terminated for the lack of efficacy [33]. Data from
this and other studies will begin to answer the key questions
regarding BACE inhibitors including when in the disease
continuum should inhibition be started; what degree of am-
yloid inhibition is required for clinical benefit; does reduc-
tion in amyloid synthesis affect clinical progression; and
are there unidentified safety concerns with long-term
BACE inhibition?
Immunotherapies, especially monoclonal antibodies, are
also well represented in the AD pipeline. There are currently
16 immunotherapy agents in 31 trials (Table 7). This in-
cludes aducanumab, solanezumab, crenezumab, ganteneru-
mab, and BAN2401. Immunotherapies target a variety of
epitopes of Ab. Solanezumab targets soluble Ab; this agent
recently failed to show a drug-placebo difference in a phase
III trial. It was terminated as a candidate therapy for AD de-
mentia [34]. It continues in prevention trials. Aducanumab
targets multiple Ab species, has had an encouraging phase
I/II trial, and is continuing in phase III [35].
President Obama articulated a goal of cure or meaningful
treatment for AD by the year 2025 [5,36]. A recent analysis of
AD drug development showed that it takes on average
13 years for a candidate treatment to move from laboratory
to FDA review and 10 years for an agent to navigate the
clinical development period from start of phase I to end of
FDA review [37]. This means that under current circum-
stances, an agent must now be in phase II to possibly be
approved by 2025 [5]. Although there are promising agents
in the pipeline that could achieve this goal, it is clear that
given the high rate of failure of AD drug development [38],
the aim of having a repertoire of agents that could respond
comprehensively and individually to a patient’s clinical cir-
cumstances within the 2025 timeframe is in jeopardy.
There are many factors contributing to the currently low
rate of success of drug development for AD. The under-
standing of the biology of AD is incomplete, the emphasis
on testing single therapies where combinations may be
required, the few candidates entering phase I, the lack of
predictive validity of animal models, lack of efficacy of
candidate therapies, and the emergence of unacceptable
side effects all limit successful treatment development.
When clinical trials are considered, the slowness of recruit-
ment, lack, until recently, of tests for diagnostic confirma-
tion, the requirement to globalize trials to achieve sufficient
recruitment at the expense of data variability, and the het-
erogeneity of AD may all contribute to the lack of success
in trials.
Biomarkers can contribute substantially to drug develop-
ment success [39]. In AD, there are few biomarkers given the
myriad of affected processes; there are only a small number
of target engagement biomarkers capable of giving an early
readout on proof of pharmacology; there are no surrogate
markers known to predict the clinical outcome; and no vali-
dated outcome biomarkers have been shown to correlate
with clinical outcomes in a trial in support of disease modi-
fication. These circumstances disadvantage AD drug devel-
opment and increase the failure rates, especially for
proposed DMTs.
Symptomatic agents are an important part of the AD
drug development pipeline. There are four cognitive
enhancing agents and no agents targeting behavioral symp-
toms in phase I clinical trials. Phase II has eight cognitive
enhancing agents and seven behavioral agents in trials,
whereas phase III has three cognitive enhancing agents
and seven behavioral agents. Together there are 15 cogni-
tive enhancers and 14 agents targeting neuropsychiatric
symptoms in the pipeline. This comprises 27% of the AD
drug development pipeline. Treatments for neuropsychi-
atric symptoms are more likely than other classes of drugs
to enter the pipeline in phase II or III after they have been
assessed in phase I with the intent of treating a primary
psychiatric illness.
The solution to the problem of the few agents in the
AD drug development pipeline, the many challenges fac-
ing candidate therapies, and the slow speed of testing
drugs can be partially addressed by increased funding.

 The NIH is critically involved in addressing AD as one of
the major challenges to human health that currently goes
unchecked. Investment in basic research will assist in
identifying
more
targets
and
candidate
compounds,
whereas investment in translational research can help sup-
port clinical trials and improve trial methods. Federal
small business loans can help fund enterprising new ap-
proaches to drug treatment; academic medical centers
can spin off biotech startups around promising tests, bio-
markers, and drugs; and venture capital can help support
startup through early phases of development until larger
biopharma companies are ready to take agents through
the final most expensive phases of clinical trials and
FDA review. Philanthropy and innovative approaches
such as venture philanthropy may help accelerate AD
drug discovery and development funding [40]. Biopharma
sponsors 65.5% of all clinical trials and is the major eco-
nomic force for drug development.
All these financial instruments, however, are currently in
place and are not sufficient to respond to the urgent need.
New investment vehicles are needed, and some have been
proposed such as private-federal bonds [41,42]. Medicare
and insurance companies who stand to benefit from
improved health of the elderly should be engaged in
funding conversations. New types of collaborations (e.g.,
between NIH and biopharma companies and between two
biopharma companies) and consortia (e.g., the Alzheimer’s
Disease
Neuroimaging
Initiative)
are
increasing
the
financial feasibility of bearing the expense of AD drug
development and enhancing the chance of success.
The need is great, the challenges many, the rewards high:
this is the condition of AD drug development. Monitoring

 the AD drug development pipeline provides perspective on
the success of the response to these challenges.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Drug development for Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD) proceeds through three phases
(I, II, and III). By assessing the number of agents in
each phase as recorded on clinicaltrials.gov, one can
determine current AD drug development activity to
assess how many agents are being studied, the suc-
cess of the research, and how the number of new
drugs can be increased.
2. Interpretation: Our data show that there are 105 drugs
in development for treatment of AD. There are more
drugs in phase II (52) than in phase III (28) or phase I
(25). The small number of phase I compounds sug-
gests that there is insufficient drug discovery activity
to supply new agents for testing in clinical trials.
3. Future directions: This review of the AD drug devel-
opment pipeline provides insight into the state of AD
drug development and can help guide new develop-
ment programs.
