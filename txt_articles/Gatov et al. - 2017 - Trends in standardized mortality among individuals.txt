ortality is a marker for the performance of the health care 
system.1 Over the past several decades, life expectancy 
has grown substantially in developed countries,2 largely 
because of increasing health promotion, public health interven-
tions and improvements in the management of chronic disease. Yet 
individuals with a diagnosis of severe mental illness, such as schizo-
phrenia, live shorter lives than people without psychiatric illness,3–5 
despite often dying of the same physical illnesses.3 This suggests 
that they have not benefited from the public health strategies that 
have led to reduced mortality more generally.6 Although studies in 
Canada and the United States have reported elevated mortality 
rates among patients with schizophrenia,7,8 time trends in all-cause 
and cause-specific mortality have not been explored. Determining 
whether there are concerning trends over time, and whether there 
are specific medical conditions that account for elevated mortality, 
will help to focus future interventions.
There is more evidence about mortality trends among individ-
uals with severe mental illness than among individuals with 
schizophrenia specifically. Some European and Australian 
studies have recorded a widening mortality disparity between

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: We examined mortality 
time trends and premature mortality 
among individuals with and without 
schizophrenia over a 20-year period.
METHODS: In this population-based, 
repeated cross-sectional study, we iden-
tified all individual deaths that occurred 
in Ontario between 1993 and 2012 in per-
sons aged 15 and over. We plotted over-
all and cause-specific age- and sex-
standardized mortality rates (ASMRs), 
stratified all-cause ASMR trends by 
sociodemographic characteristics, and 
analyzed premature mortality using 
years of potential life lost. Additionally, 
we calculated mortality rate ratios 
(MRRs) using negative binomial regres-
sion with adjustment for age, sex, 
income, rurality and year of death.
RESULTS: We identified 31 349 deaths 
among persons with schizophrenia, and 
1 589 902 deaths among those without 
schizophrenia. Mortality rates among 
people with schizophrenia were 3 times 
higher than among those without 
schizophrenia (adjusted MRR 3.12, 95% 
confidence interval 3.06–3.17). All-
cause ASMRs in both groups declined in 
parallel over the study period, by about 
35%, and were higher for men, for those 
with low income and for rural dwellers. 
The absolute ASMR difference also 
declined throughout the study period 
(from 16.15 to 10.49 deaths per 1000 
persons). Cause-specific ASMRs were 
greater among those with schizophre-
nia, with circulatory conditions 
accounting for most deaths between 
1993 and 2012, whereas neoplasms 
became the leading cause of death for 
those without schizophrenia after 2005. 
Individuals with schizophrenia also 
died, on average, 8 years younger than 
those without schizophrenia, losing 
more potential years of life.
INTERPRETATION: Although mortality 
rates among people with schizophrenia 
have declined over the past 2 decades, 
specialized approaches may be required 
to close the persistent 3-fold relative mor-
tality gap with the general population.

those with and without severe mental illness,9–11 whereas evi-
dence from other, mainly Nordic, countries suggests a trend of 
declining mortality12 and a persistent relative mortality gap.13,14 
However, these studies are not generalizable to a population of 
individuals with schizophrenia because they encompassed diag-
noses such as bipolar disorder and major depression, and typi-
cally used a single psychiatric hospital admission to identify 
cases. Using hospital admission for case ascertainment misses 
individuals managed in ambulatory settings and biases the sam-
ple toward greater severity, underestimating the prevalence and 
overestimating the mortality burden of severe mental ill-
ness.11–13,15 Mortality in more restricted populations of patients 
with schizophrenia is likely to be different from that in more 
hetero 
geneous populations with severe mental illness, because 
individuals with schizophrenia have a more chronic course of ill-
ness,16 more cognitive and functional impairment17 and likely a 
longer-term exposure to antipsychotics known to be associated 
with higher risk of diabetes mellitus.18 Thus, investigating the 
mortality trends of individuals with schizophrenia is crucial for 
determining whether they have experienced the same health 
improvements as the general population or whether other 
approaches are required to address their unique needs.
In this study, we exploited population-based mortality data 
for a 20-year period and used a validated method of accurately 
identifying every resident within the population who had a diag-
nosis of schizophrenia to report on all-cause and cause-specific 
relative and absolute mortality trends, as well as on premature 
mortality, among individuals with and without schizophrenia in 
Ontario, Canada.
Methods
Setting, design and study population
This repeated, cross-sectional study examined all Ontario adults 
with and without schizophrenia annually from Jan. 1, 1993, to 
Dec. 31, 2012. We used a validated algorithm to detect all cases of 
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in Ontario from linked, 
population-level health administrative data available at the Insti-
tute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).15 We ascertained cases 
on the basis of a single hospital admission within 12 months or 
3 phys 
ician visits within 36 months (sensitivity 96.5%, specificity 
57.1%).15 Psychiatric hospital admissions before 2005 were cap-
tured in the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Dis-
charge Abstract Database, using the International Statistical Classi-
fication of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision 
(ICD-10) codes F20 and F25; hospital admissions from 2005 onward 
were captured in the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System 
using diagnosis 295 from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 4th edition. We identified physician service claims 
from Ontario Health Insurance Plan data, which contain patient 
diagnostic codes for physician visits and consultation billings (spe-
cifically code 295).15 We examined all deaths that occurred each 
year among cases and non-cases through linkage to the Office of 
the Registrar General — Deaths vital statistics data set, which con-
tains primary and intermediate causes of death (according to the 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9] and 
ICD-10-CA). We excluded individuals aged 0–14 years, given the low 
likelihood of a valid schizophrenia diagnosis in this age group,19 and 
those for whom cause of death was not available.
Outcomes
To enable analyses over time, we enriched the data for the most 
responsible cause of death by creating a single ICD-9 variable 
based on CIHI conversion tables. In addition to all-cause mortality, 
we examined cause-specific mortality from natural and unnatural 
causes,8 adapted from the World Health Organization20 (Appendix 
1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
161351/-/DC1): diseases of the cardiovascular or circulatory sys-
tem; neoplasms; diseases of the respiratory system; and meta-
bolic, nutritional, immunity, endocrine and digestive conditions. 
Unnatural deaths were classified as suicide or accidental deaths. 
Denominators for the Ontario population were obtained from Sta-
tistics Canada population census files. All data sets were linked at 
the individual level using unique encoded identifiers and were 
analyzed at ICES.
Covariables
We captured age, sex, area-based income quintiles, and urban or 
rural dwelling using census information, attributed to individuals 
according to year of death, such that the 1991 census was used 
for 1993, 1996 census for 1994–1998, and so on. Area-based 
income was ascertained at the level of dissemination areas, the 
smallest available geographic census area. Current-day geo-
graphic boundaries were used to match individual postal code to 
geographic category.
Statistical analysis
We plotted (with tests for linear trend) all-cause and cause-
specific age- and sex-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) from 
1993 to 2012 for those with and without schizophrenia (standard-
ized to the 2006 Ontario population using the direct method).21 
We assessed absolute within-group differences and relative 
declines throughout the study period, expressed as percentages 
of the 1993 rates, and calculated between-group absolute and 
relative differences. To investigate whether all-cause and cause-
specific mortality time trends varied according to schizophrenia 
status, we modelled mortality rates for those with schizophrenia, 
relative to those without schizophrenia, using negative binomial 
regression models adjusted for age, sex, income quintile, rural 
dwelling and year of death (as a linear predictor), and then 
tested an interaction term between schizophrenia status and 
time. We report adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRRs), with corre-
sponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and temporal trends, 
expressed as the average annual percent change (the effect of 
year in the model). We further stratified all-cause ASMRs by sex, 
area-level income, and urban or rural dwelling.
Given that the prevalence of schizophrenia remained rela-
tively stable over time,22 we conducted a post hoc sensitivity 
analysis to examine the extent of ascertainment bias that may 
have occurred because of an unequal accrual period for case-
finding between 1993 and 2012. Because the denominator for 
2012 was based on more than 20 years of case ascertainment, we

applied the prevalence of schizophrenia in that year (about 1%) 
to all denominators in the study period and repeated the process 
for numerators to obtain crude mortality rates. 
We examined premature mortality by looking at age at time of 
death and analyzing years of potential life lost (YPLL), which 
measures the years not lived by each individual who died before 
age 75.23 The numerator was the sum of all YPLL, which was 
determined by computing, for each age group, the difference 
between 75 and the median age at death and multiplying that 
difference by the number of deaths.23 This calculation weights 
deaths at younger ages more heavily (i.e., the younger the age at 
death, the greater the numerator). The denominator consisted of 
individuals between the ages of 15 and 75 years.24 The resulting 
rates were then age- and sex-standardized to enable between-
group comparisons. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3.

Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Research 
Ethics Board at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.

Sample characteristics
A total of 1 639 154 deaths were recorded in Ontario from Jan. 1, 
1993, to Dec. 31, 2012. After exclusion of 16 944 individuals aged 
0 to 14 years and 959 individuals for whom cause of death was 
not available, there were 1 621 251 deaths in this time frame, of 
which 31 349 (1.9%) were deaths in individuals with schizophre-
nia. At both the earliest (Table 1) and latest (Table 2) time points, 
individuals who died with schizophrenia were often younger, 
female and resided in lower-income neighbourhoods. Those with 
schizophrenia were also more likely to die from each of the natu-
ral and unnatural causes of death than those who died without 
schizophrenia. 
Mortality time trends
A nonsignificant interaction (p for interaction = 0.9) between 
year of death and schizophrenia status in an age- and sex-
adjusted negative binomial model indicated that mortality 
time trends did not differ between those with and without

schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia experienced an 
absolute decline in all-cause ASMR of 8.81 deaths per 1000 (from 
25.33 to 16.52) between 1993 and 2012, corresponding to a sig-
nificant relative decline of 34.8% (p for trend < 0.001). Those 
without schizophrenia experienced an absolute ASMR reduction 
of 3.15 deaths per 1000 (from 9.18 to 6.03), which represented a sig-
nificant decline of 34.3% (p < 0.001) (see Figure 1 and Appendix 2 
[available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/

were observed in parallel, the absolute difference in ASMRs 
between the groups decreased from 16.15 to 10.49 deaths per 
1000 over the study period (p < 0.001). 
Similarly, according to the fully adjusted negative binomial 
model, mortality time trends did not differ between the groups

(p = 0.8; interaction was removed). Individuals with schizophrenia 
were 3.12 times more likely than those without schizophrenia to 
die from any cause (MRR 3.12, 95% CI 3.06–3.17), with adjustment 
for age, sex, income quintile, rurality and year of death. The aver-
age annual decline in mortality rates for both groups was 2% 
(MRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98–0.98). Mortality time trends did not differ 
by sex (p for interaction = 0.6), by income quintile (p = 0.8) or by 
rurality (p = 0.4), but in both groups, males and individuals from 
lower-income neighbourhoods and rural areas had higher ASMRs. 
Although cause-specific ASMRs were greater among individ-
uals with schizophrenia in absolute terms, tests for interactions 
in age- and sex-adjusted negative binomial models showed that 
mortality time trends did not differ between the groups for 
most conditions, with the exception of circulatory deaths (p = 
0.003), accidents (p = 0.002) and suicides (p < 0.001), whereby 
those with schizophrenia experienced greater relative declines 
than the general population for unnatural causes of death but a 
lesser relative decline in cardiovascular mortality (Figure 2, 
Table 3 and Table 4). Equivalent findings were observed using 
fully adjusted negative binomial models. Up to 2005, the high-
est ASMR for those without schizophrenia was for circulatory 
causes (with a relative decline of 57% between 1993 and 2012), 
but after 2005, neoplasms became the leading cause of death in 
this population (1.99 per 1000). By contrast, circulatory mortal-
ity remained the leading cause of death for those with schizo-
phrenia throughout the years, with a 44% relative decline over-

all (from 7.40 to 4.12 per 1000). The absolute differences 
between the groups for metabolic ASMRs averaged 1.29 per 
1000. Relative reductions in suicide-related mortality rates 
were greatest for those with schizophrenia, whereby in 2012, 
the ASMR due to accidental causes surpassed the ASMR due to 
suicide in this group (1.16 v. 0.85 per 1000).
The sensitivity analysis, in which the prevalence of schizo-
phrenia in 2012 was applied to all annual estimates throughout 
the study period, revealed that the relative between-group differ-
ence in crude all-cause mortality rates increased from 2.50 to 
2.52 per 1000, whereas the absolute difference declined from 
12.28 to 11.19 per 1000 (see Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161351/-/DC1)
Premature mortality
On average, individuals with schizophrenia died 8 years younger than 
those without (Table 5). The mean age at death for those without 
schizophrenia increased from 73.3 to 76.7 years between 1993 and 
2012. From 2001 onward, these individuals no longer met the stan-
dard definition for premature mortality.23 By contrast, premature 
mortality for those with schizophrenia persisted over the years, with 
the average age at death increasing from 64.7 to 67.4. Time trends in 
age- and sex-standardized rates of YPLL mirrored those of the ASMRs, 
whereby decreases were observed in parallel. Those with schizophre-
nia lost more potential years of life than those without schizophrenia, 
overall and for each cause of death (Appendix 4, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161351/-/DC1). Throughout

the study period, those without schizophrenia lost 43.9 potential 
years of life per 1000 persons, compared with 226.3 YPLL among those 
with schizophrenia.
Interpretation
Between 1993 and 2012, individuals with schizophrenia experi-
enced 3 times greater mortality rates, compared with the general 
population, even after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. 
All-cause mortality rates in both groups declined in parallel by 
about 35%, and were higher in men, those with low income and 
rural dwellers. Although the relative 3-fold gap between the 
groups persisted, the absolute difference declined from 16.15 to 
10.49 deaths per 1000. Cause-specific ASMRs were greater for 
those with schizophrenia, with circulatory disease accounting for 
most deaths. By contrast, neoplasm-related deaths became 
more common after 2005 among those without schizophrenia. 
Among those with schizophrenia, relative declines throughout 
the 20 years were greater for unnatural deaths but smaller for cir-
culatory deaths. Those with schizophrenia also died younger and 
lost more potential years of life.
Previous studies involving individuals with schizophrenia 
showed widening mortality gaps relative to the general popula-
tion, but were limited by small samples1,9 or by an older observa-
tion period,1,9,10 which may not reflect more recent mortality 
reductions in developed countries.2 The 3-fold elevated mortality 
rates that we observed are consistent with the scientific litera-
ture,5 as is the finding that the relative gap did not close over the 
years.12,14 Even in Scandinavian countries, which provide high-
quality health care, the mortality gap remains wide and has 
decreased only modestly over the past 2 decades.12 Neoplasm-
related mortality surpassed circulatory mortality in the general 
population, concurrent with a longer life expectancy.25 By con-
trast, individuals with schizophrenia have not benefited from 
reductions in cardiovascular deaths to the same extent.26,27 These 
conditions, along with higher rates of suicide and accidental 
deaths, contribute to premature mortality. Although higher rates 
of unnatural deaths tend to occur more often in early adult-
hood,28 our analysis of YPLL reflects the premature mortality toll 
resulting from natural causes, suggesting that schizophrenia can 
indeed be considered a “life-shortening disease,” as some 
authors assert.29

Access to health care and lifestyle factors may explain the ele-
vated mortality among individuals with schizophrenia,3 who 
have a higher rate of modifiable risk factors such as smoking, 
alcohol consumption, poor diet and lack of exercise,4,18 and an 
increased likelihood of being obese and developing diabetes 
mellitus, possibly related to weight gain associated with anti-
psychotic medication.3,30 The elevated mortality rate in this 
group may also be due to limited access to general health ser-
vices, given that patients with severe mental illness are less likely 
to receive standard levels of care for physical diseases, as well as 
cardiovascular screening and prevention, than would be 
expected for a nonpsychiatric population.3,18,31 Nonetheless, the 
reductions in absolute inequality between the groups signal that 
some public health efforts are likely having an effect.
Limitations
This repeated cross-sectional study was based on yearly prevalent 
cases of schizophrenia. Because these individuals may already 
have survived the period of greatest risk for suicide following first 
service contact,9 the mortality rates reported here may be under-
estimates. Furthermore, our algorithm relied on health service 
contact to ascertain individuals with schizophrenia. Over the 
20 years of the study, the number of cases gradually increased 
because of stable incidence and a longer accrual period, which 
increased the overall prevalence of schizophrenia over time. This 
would lead to overestimation of schizophrenia-related mortality 
rates early in the observation period, because the denominator 
would be artificially low. Although a sensitivity analysis in which 
the prevalence of schizophrenia in 2012 was applied to all annual 
estimates revealed a minimal degree of ascertainment bias, it may 
be that the mortality gap between individuals with and without 
schizophrenia is not persisting; rather, it may be increasing. Addi-
tionally, information about health risk factors, such as smoking, 
substance abuse, body mass index and medication use, was 
unavailable. These factors are not needed for estimating ASMRs, 
but they may explain the observed trends. Lastly, administrative 
data may have missed individuals with undiagnosed or untreated 
illness, and those seeking care through community organizations 
or private specialists. However, given the severity and chronic 
nature of schizophrenia, it is likely that most patients would be 
admitted to hospital at least once and would thus have been 
included in this study.
Conclusion
Individuals with and without schizophrenia experienced similar 
relative declines in all-cause mortality over the study period, 
which resulted in a persistent 3-fold gap. While neoplasms have 
become more common in the general population, individuals 
with schizophrenia have lagged behind in terms of reductions 
to the mortality risk posed by cardiovascular disease. Although 
there have been numerous calls to action to help individuals 
with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, to manage 
chronic medical illnesses,18,26,29 and although the declining 
trends and narrowing absolute gap that we observed are posi-
tive developments, more effort is required to reduce the con-
siderable disparity in both mortality and illness burden.
