Cluster of an Unusual Amnestic Syndrome — Massachusetts, 2012–2016
Jed A. Barash, MD1; Nick Somerville, MD2; Alfred DeMaria, Jr., MD3
In November 2015, a neurologist in the Boston, Massachusetts, 
area reported four cases of an uncommon amnestic syndrome 
involving acute and complete ischemia of both hippocampi, 
as identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) (1). A 
subsequent e-mail alert, generated by the Massachusetts Board 
of Registration in Medicine and sent to relevant medical special-
ists (including neurologists, neuroradiologists, and emergency 
physicians), resulted in the identification of 10 additional cases 
that had occurred during 2012–2016. All 14 patients (mean and 
median age = 35 years) had been evaluated at hospitals in eastern 
Massachusetts. Thirteen of the 14 patients underwent routine 
clinical toxicology screening at the time of initial evaluation; 
eight tested positive for opioids, two for cocaine, and two for 
benzodiazepines. Apart from sporadic cases (2–6), this combina-
tion of clinical and imaging findings has been reported rarely. 
The apparent temporospatial clustering, relatively young age at 
onset (19–52 years), and associated substance use among these 
patients should stimulate further case identification to determine 
whether these observations represent an emerging syndrome 
related to substance use or other causes (e.g., a toxic exposure).
The four patients reported in November 2015 had been 
evaluated at a single Boston-area medical center during the 
preceding 3 years (1). MRI of the head revealed changes con-
sistent with acute and complete ischemia of both hippocampi 
(Figure) in all four patients at the time of initial evaluation. 
Three of the four patients tested positive for opiates on initial 
toxicology screening, and the fourth, who was not tested, had 
a reported history of heroin use. No readily apparent evidence 
for another established etiology of hippocampal amnesia (7,8) 
existed for any of the patients. Several previous isolated case 
reports were associated with cocaine use only (2–4), and one 
case of complete unilateral hippocampal infarction involving 
heroin inhalation was reported in France in 2013 (9).
In February 2016, MDPH requested that neurologists, radi-
ologists (including neuroradiologists), and emergency depart-
ment physicians report any similar cases for medical record 
review. For the purposes of the review, a case was defined as a 
patient evaluated in Massachusetts since January 1, 2012 with 
1) new onset amnesia in the absence of evidence to support a 
readily apparent cause, and 2) changes consistent with acute 
and complete ischemia of both hippocampi on MRI at initial 
assessment. To investigate each report, the authors (includ-
ing a board-certified neurologist) reviewed available clinical 
documentation and diagnostic testing. After preliminary case 
review, demographic, behavioral, and clinical data, includ-
ing information related to substance use, were abstracted for 
analysis from records of patients who met the case definition.
Including the four initial cases, medical records of 25 
patients, dating back to 2008, were reviewed after the February 
2016 request by MDPH for case reporting. Medical testing was 
not uniform among all patients, because each patient under-
went variable and extensive testing based on clinical context 
and the assessment of their health care provider. Fourteen

(56%) patients met the case definition (Table 1). Among these 
14, a total of 11 were identified retrospectively, including two 
in 2012, five in 2014, and four in 2015. Three were identi-
fied prospectively in 2016 after the MDPH request, the most 
recent in late July 2016. None of the reports of patients with 
onset before 2012 met the clinical case definition.
All 14 patients had been evaluated at hospitals in east-
ern Massachusetts. One was a resident of southeastern 
New Hampshire and another was visiting from the state of 
Washington. Patient age ranged from 19 to 52 years (mean 
and median = 35 years). Nine patients were unconscious at the 
time they came to medical attention, five of whom required 
endotracheal intubation. After regaining consciousness, all nine 
were noted to be amnestic. Among the other five patients, family 
members, friends, or acquaintances observed the emergence of 
severe memory loss after limited time apart and brought them 
to the emergency department for further assessment. In addi-
tion to striking anterograde amnesia, deficits of orientation, 
attention, and executive function were variously noted. These 
deficits were reported to have improved over time, with resolu-
tion of memory loss in one patient at 5 months, but persisting in 
two patients with follow-up of more than 1 year (Table 2). For 
13 patients, MRI of the head was performed within 5 days of 
initial evaluation, and at 8 days in the 14th patient. In addition 
to bilateral hippocampal ischemia (Figure), nine patients also 
exhibited ischemic changes in one or more, often asymmetric 
extra-hippocampal regions, primarily in the subcortical and pos-
terior areas (Table 2). Follow-up MRI in one patient, at 5 weeks, 
demonstrated complete resolution of the initial abnormalities; 
in two other patients, at 13 and 22 months after onset, MRI 
revealed residual, bilateral hippocampal volume loss.
A history of substance use disorder was documented in 13 
of 14 patients; the remaining patient tested positive for opi-
ates and cocaine at the time of initial evaluation. The other 
patient, who tested positive for cocaine, also tested positive for 
opiates, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines, none of which 
were being prescribed at the time. Overall, 12 of 14 patients 
had a history of opioid use, and eight tested positive for opiates 
on routine toxicology screening, including one whose medica-
tion list included oxycodone-acetaminophen and another who 
had not reportedly filled a prescription for buprenorphine/
naloxone in approximately 2 months. Among the six patients 
with a history of benzodiazepine use, four had lorazepam or 
clonazepam on their medication list, and two tested posi-
tive for benzodiazepines. Tobacco and alcohol histories were 
incompletely documented for multiple patients, although no 
patient tested positive for alcohol on routine screening. One of 
the two patients with negative toxicology results upon routine 
testing had reported heroin use in the days preceding the event, 
and the other had a history of opioid use, but further details 
were unavailable. Marijuana, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, commonly 
known as Ecstasy), mushrooms, and phencyclidine (PCP) were 
among other substances reported to have been used (Table 2). 
Neither of the patients with a history of dextroamphetamine/
amphetamine use had amphetamines listed as a prescribed 
medication. Among four patients with gabapentin on their 
active medication list, one reportedly had evidence of gaba-
pentin overdose at the time of evaluation. Routine clinical 
toxicology screening in that patient also revealed the presence 
of opiates, cannabinoids, and salicylates.
One patient had a history of seizures on two occasions in the 
past, possibly related to alcohol withdrawal, but no evidence 
of seizure at the time of assessment. Another patient had 
witnessed seizure activity during transport to the emergency 
department, but had no history of seizures. A third patient 
developed a seizure disorder after evaluation for the amnestic 
episode. No epileptiform abnormalities were noted on elec-
troencephalography (EEG) at the time of initial evaluation in 
these three patients or in eight others who underwent EEG.
Six patients had history of at least one vascular disease risk, 
including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and sleep apnea.

the head and neck performed in seven patients, did not reveal a 
source of thromboembolism. Electrocardiogram revealed a new 
diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in the two oldest patients (aged 50 
and 52 years). One patient aged 36 years demonstrated pulseless 
electrical activity and respiratory arrest (after a documented brief 
response to naloxone), with resolution on prehospital resuscita-
tion. Cerebrospinal fluid findings in five patients who underwent 
lumbar puncture were unremarkable. Carboxyhemoglobin and 
methemoglobin levels were measured in two patients and were 
unremarkable. Initial aspartate and alanine aminotransferase were 
elevated in all 13 patients tested, with both levels in one patient 
exceeding 500 units/liter (approximately 10 times the upper limit 
of normal). Otherwise, extensive work-up was unremarkable. 
Investigation of the 14 cases is ongoing.

Discussion
The combination of clinical findings described in this report 
has previously been reported rarely and in isolation, associated 
with isolated cocaine use, influenza, and carbon monoxide 
poisoning (2–6). This cluster of amnestic syndrome associated 
with bilateral complete hippocampal ischemia is unusual given 
the absence of a readily identifiable etiology, the temporospatial 
clustering, relatively young patient age, and extensive substance 
use among affected persons.
Cardiopulmonary, cerebrovascular, or other mechanisms 
might serve as plausible explanations underlying certain find-
ings. Hypoxemic injury to the relatively vulnerable hippocam-
pal regions, for example, has been raised as one possibility (10). 
However, further case identification and reporting are needed 
to determine whether these combined observations represent 
an emerging syndrome related to substance use or other causes 
(e.g., a toxic exposure).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, information was obtained from medical records 
from several different facilities, and differences in documenta-
tion and medical assessment across patients limited the con-
sistent characterization of variables. Second, this investigation 
was intended to establish the existence of the case cluster and 
generate hypotheses about possible associated exposures. A 
case-control study could more rigorously test potential associa-
tions. Finally, the identification of cases required that MRI of 
the head had been performed during patient work-up, which 
might not be consistently performed by medical providers for 
various reasons.
MRI of the head, toxicology screening, and neurologic 
consultation should be considered in all adults aged ≥18 years 
with sudden-onset amnesia, particularly in patients with altered 
consciousness. Advanced laboratory testing, including testing 
for synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl) and their analogues, as 
well as extraneous substances not assessed in these reported 
cases, might further clarify an association with substance use.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Acute, complete, and bilateral ischemia of the hippocampus is a 
rare cause of memory loss (associated with toxic exposure, 
among other etiologies) that has been reported rarely and in 
isolation. A single 2013 case of complete unilateral hippocam-
pal ischemia has been linked to heroin inhalation.
What is added by this report?
A unique cluster of 14 cases of sudden onset amnesia with 
acute, complete, and bilateral ischemia of the hippocampus was 
identified in Massachusetts during 2012–2016. No clear etiology 
exists, but at time of initial evaluation, 13 of 14 tested positive 
for opioids or had opioid use recorded in their medical history.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The apparent temporospatial clustering, relatively young age at 
onset (19–52 years), and extensive substance use associated 
with this group of patients suggests broader surveillance is 
needed to determine whether this represents an emerging 
syndrome related to substance use or other causes, including 
introduction of a toxic substance.
