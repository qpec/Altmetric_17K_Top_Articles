Purpose
The goal of this study was to investigate the association between blood draws, injections, blood
pressure readings, trauma, cellulitis in the at-risk arm, and air travel and increases in arm volume in a
cohort of patients treated for breast cancer and screened for lymphedema.
Patients and Methods
Between 2005 and 2014, patients undergoing treatment of breast cancer at our institution were
screened prospectively for lymphedema. Bilateral arm volume measurements were performed
preoperatively and postoperatively using a Perometer. At each measurement, patients reported the
number of blood draws, injections, blood pressure measurements, trauma to the at-risk arm(s),
and number of flights taken since their last measurement. Arm volume was quantified using the
relative volume change and weight-adjusted change formulas. Linear random effects models were
used to assess the association between relative arm volume (as a continuous variable) and non-
treatment risk factors, as well as clinical characteristics.
Results
In 3,041 measurements, there was no significant association between relative volume change
or weight-adjusted change increase and undergoing one or more blood draws (P = .62), injections
(P = .77), number of flights (one or two [P = .77] and three or more [P = .91] v none), or duration of
flights (1 to 12 hours [P = .43] and 12 hours or more [P = .54] v none). By multivariate analysis, factors
significantly associated with increases in arm volume included body mass index $ 25 (P = .0236), axillary
lymph node dissection (P , .001), regional lymph node irradiation (P = .0364), and cellulitis (P , .001).
Conclusion
This study suggests that although cellulitis increases risk of lymphedema, ipsilateral blood draws, injections,
blood pressure readings, and air travel may not be associated with arm volume increases. The results may
help to educate clinicians and patients on posttreatment risk, prevention, and management of lymphedema.

INTRODUCTION
Clinicians and national guidelines strongly advise
patients with breast cancer to avoid blood draws,
injections, blood pressure readings, and trauma to
the at-risk arm during and after treatment to
reduce the risk of developing cellulitis and breast
cancer–related lymphedema (BCRL).1-6 Patients
are also advised to exercise caution when flying by
wearing prophylactic compression sleeves.1,3,5
These guidelines are based on anecdotal infor-
mation, and comprehensive data demonstrating
the efficacy of such precautionary behaviors do
not exist, highlighted in a recent statement by the
National Lymphedema Network.5 The guidelines
place a large amount of burden on patients and
clinicians, who go to great lengths to exercise
precautionary behaviors and face high levels of
anxiety when they accidentally do not abide by the
guidelines. Therefore, we sought to investigate the
association between blood draws, injections,
blood pressure readings, trauma, and cellulitis in
the at-risk arm and flying on increases in arm
volume in a large prospective cohort of patients
undergoing treatment of breast cancer.

 Lymphedema is a potential adverse effect of breast cancer
treatment characterized by arm swelling, discomfort, and impaired
upper extremity function in its later stages. The development of
lymphedema is the result of a compromised lymphatic drainage
system after the removal of lymph nodes or radiation to the axillary
lymph nodes. Patients with breast cancer carry a lifelong risk of
developing lymphedema; the average time to onset is 14.4 months
after treatment completion.7,8 Consequently, if patients comply
with cautionary guidelines, they must exercise risk-reducing
practices for the rest of their lives.
Well-defined risk factors for developing lymphedema include
axillary lymph node dissection (ALND),9-15 regional lymph node
irradiation (RLNR),8,16-19 higher body mass index (BMI), and
older age at diagnosis.7,8,11,14,20-30 It remains unclear why, among
patients with similar demographic and treatment-related charac-
teristics, some go on to develop lymphedema. This variation has
prompted speculation that events including blood draws, injec-
tions, blood pressure readings, trauma to the arm, air travel, and
cellulitis might incite lymphedema.6,31 Despite the prevalence and
persistence of recommendations to pursue precautionary behavior
after breast cancer treatment, few data exist to support these
practices, and investigation into the topic is warranted.5
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer between 2009 and 2014
who were prospectively screened for lymphedema at our institution were
included in this analysis. Bilateral arm volume measurements were obtained
using an optoelectric Perometer (Pero-system, Wuppertal, Germany), which
uses infrared light to measure limb circumference and calculate arm volume.
All patients had a preoperative baseline measurement, a postoperative
measurement, a measurement after chemotherapy and/or radio therapy, and
measurements at regular follow-up intervals corresponding with oncology
visits.32-35 Regular follow-up intervals correspond to time periods of between
3 and 7 months. Occasionally patients are measured more frequently at their
request. The protocol for lymphedema screening has been previously
published and approved by the institutional review board33 (ClinicalTrials.
gov identification number NCT01521741).
Arm volume changes were quantified using the relative volume change
(RVC)33 formula after unilateral breast surgery or the weight-adjusted volume
change (WAC) formula after bilateral breast surgery.34 The RVC equation
accounts for preoperative differences in arm volume by using a baseline
measurement and for nontreatment-related changes, including weight gain or
loss, by comparing the surgical arm to the nonsurgical arm.33,34 Briefly, RVC =
{[A(2)U(1)/U(2)A(1)} 2 1), where A(1) and A(2) are arm volumes on the
surgical or ipsilateral side at preoperative and postoperative measurements, and
U(1) and U(2) are armvolumes on the contralateral side at corresponding time
points.33 The WAC calculates changes in arm volume compared with a
preoperative arm measurement for each arm independently and accounts for
weight changes that could influence arm size.34 RVC and WAC have been
shown to classify lymphedema similarly.34 Lymphedema was defined as RVC
or WAC $ 10%.7,15,36
At each Perometer measurement, patients were asked to complete a
survey on which they reported the number of blood draws, injections,
blood pressure readings, and trauma to the at-risk arm(s); number of
flights and the length of the flight since their last measurement; and use of
compression sleeve while flying. Self-reported trauma ranged from
bruising to arm fractures.
This analysis includes information from each patient visit at which
both an arm volume measurement and a survey were obtained.
Patient Population
All 632 patients included in this study had a new diagnosis of invasive
breast cancer at their baseline measurement, more than 6 months of
postsurgical follow-up, and at least one follow-up arm measurement.
Patient and clinocopathologic characteristics were collected via medical
record review. Patients who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy are still at
risk for developing lymphedema and are often advised to exercise risk
reduction practices just like those who undergo ALND. Therefore, both
groups were included in the study. Episodes of cellulitis were defined as
clinical signs of infection in the ipsilateral arm and/or breast that required
antibiotics. Each side was evaluated independently for patients who
underwent bilateral breast surgery, resulting in a total of 760 at-risk arms
available for analysis. In our hospital, the majority of patients who chose to
undergo contralateral prophylactic mastectomy undergo sentinel lymph
node biopsy on their unaffected breast to stage an occult breast cancer if
discovered on final pathology. Therefore, the unaffected breasts for patients
undergoing bilateral mastectomies were included in the analysis because
they are also at risk for developing lymphedema. Patients were censored
from the analysis after a diagnosis of distant metastases and recurrence and
if they wore a compression sleeve while flying.
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the 2-year cumulative
incidence of lymphedema, defined by RVC/WAC $ 10%. Linear random
effects models were used to assess the association between relative armvolume
(as a continuous variable), clinical risk factors, and episodes of non-
precautionary behavior. These models account for the correlation between
arm volume measurements obtained from the same patient and, for patients
who underwent bilateral breast surgery, on the same side of the body. At each
measurement, the number of blood draws, injections, blood pressure
readings, trauma, and episodes of cellulitis were analyzed both as continuous
variables and as dichotomous variables, categorized according to whether
patients reported having had one or more events versus none. Number of and
hours spent on flights in total since last follow-up were analyzed as both
continuous and trichotomous variables. Model estimates give the mean
change in RVC or WAC associated with a one-unit increase in a continuous
risk factor and the mean difference in RVC or WAC between subgroups for
categorical variables. Univariate model results were used to estimate and plot
the mean RVC or WAC within each subgroup for categorical clinical and
nontreatment-related variables, along with the 95% CI for the mean and the P
value associated with the comparison of means. The multivariate model was
chosen by starting with a model that included all variables that were sig-
nificant at the .10 significance level in the univariate analysis, as well as all
nonprecautionary behaviors, and removing one variable at a time until only
significant (P , .05) variables remained. Because cellulitis is in the causal
pathway between the risk events and arm volume increase, it was not included
in the model selection process to avoid overadjustment bias.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association
between risk of cellulitis and risk events. Patients who developed cellulitis in the
postoperative period were excluded from this analysis because of lack of
information on riskevents. In addition, in analyzing the association between risk
events and subsequent cellulitis, we evaluated the relationship between the risk
of infection and the number of risk events reported before the cellulitis episode.
RESULTS
Patient Population
Six hundred thirty-two patients with a total of 3,041 post-
operative measurements were included. Median age at diagnosis
was 52 years (range, 28 to 81 years), and median BMI was 26 lb/in2
(range,16to59lb/in2;Table1);92.1%ofthecohortwaswhite,0.6%
Hispanic, 2% African American, 2.7% Asian, and 2.6% unknown.
Patients were followed for a median of 24 months (6 to 60 months)

 and had a median of four postoperative visits (one to 16). The
median time between measurements was 7 months (interquartile
range, 6.2 months). Thirteen percent of patients had one mea-
surement,34%hadtwotothreemeasurements,40%hadfourtosix
measurements,and13%hadsevento16measurements.Bymedical
record review, 5.9% (45 of 760) of treated breasts had at least one
episode of cellulitis any time after surgery requiring antibiotics
(Table 1); 47% (21 of 45) of cellulitis episodes occurred in the
immediate postoperative period and therefore before the first
postoperative arm measurement. At 24 months, the cumulative
incidence of BCRLasdefined byanRVC or WAC$10% was7.72%
(95% CI, 5.82% to 10.22%).
Nonprecautionary Behaviors
In 8.5% (251 of 2,965) of responses, patients reported having
one or more blood draw in their affected arm(s) since their last
measurement, 2.1% (63 of 2,961) of responses reported having one
or more injection, 16.3% (482 of 2,961) of responses reported
having one or more blood pressure measurements taken, and 1.0%
(37 of 2,999) of responses reported trauma to the at-risk arm
(Table 2). Thirty percent (878 of 2,960) of patients had flown since
their last measurement (Table 2).
Univariate and Multivariate Analyses
By univariate analysis, there was no significant association
between an increased RVC or WAC and undergoing one or more
blood draws (P = .62), injections (P = .77), trauma to the at-risk
arm (P = .08), number of flights (one or two [P = .77] and three or
more [P = .91] v none), or duration of flights (1 to 12 hours [P =
.43] and 12 hours or more [P = .54] v none) (Fig 1). Having a
BMI $ 25 lb/in2 at time of diagnosis (P = .0064), undergoing
ALND (P = .0003), having blood pressure readings (P = .034),
RLNR (P , .001), and cellulitis (P , .001) were significantly
associated with arm volume increases (Table 3; Fig 1). When

Risk Reduction Practices for Lymphedema
 analyzed as continuous variables, age at diagnosis (P = .25), the
number of ipsilateral blood draws (P = .92), injections (P = .85),
blood pressure readings (P = .15), and number (P = .34) or duration
of flights (P = .98) were not associated with an increase in RVC or
WAC by univariate analysis. In a subset of patients who underwent
ALND, BMI $ 25 lb/in2 (P = .0051) and cellulitis (P , .001)
remained significant, but blood draws (P = .26), injections (P = .35),
blood pressures (P = .39), trauma (P = .23), and air travel (one or
two [P = .96] and three or more [P = .88] v no flights) or duration of
flights (1 to 12 hours [P = .85] and 12 hours or more [P = .69] v
none) were not associated with increased arm swelling.
By multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with
increases in arm volume included BMI $ 25 lb/in2 (P = .0236),
ALND (P ,.001), RLNR (P = .0364), and cellulitis (P ,.001) (Fig 2).
None of the nonprecautionary behaviors were significantly
associated with arm volume change in the multivariate analysis.
Further investigation of the association between risk events
and subsequent cellulitis revealed that blood draws (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.977; P = .91), injections (HR, 1.101; P = .5), and blood
pressure readings (HR, 0.943; P = .1) on the ipsilateral arm were
not significantly associated with cellulitis.
DISCUSSION
A large, prospective cohort of patients with breast cancer was
analyzed to investigate the association of nonprecautionary
behaviors and the subsequent risk of lymphedema. No significant
association was found between undergoing ipsilateral blood draws,
injections, and blood pressure readings, and trauma to the at-risk
arm, air travel, and arm swelling. Increase in arm swelling was
associated with ALND, RLNR, BMI $ 25 lb/in2, and cellulitis.
Previous reports postulate that blood draws, injections, blood
pressure readings, and trauma can cause infection and injury to the
at-risk arm.3,6,37-39 The theory is that patients with surgically
removed lymph nodes have compromised lymphatic systems that
cannot clear fluid resulting from an immune response, leading to
build-up of lymphatic fluid in the arm and subsequent lymph-
edema.37 One of the first papers to recommend precautionary
behaviors was published in 1992 as a case report of a woman who
developed swelling 30 years after treatment in response to a finger
pinprick.40 Smith37 advised avoidance of traumatic events to the at-
risk arm after examining 10 patients with BCRL, four of whom
reported blood draws as triggering their arm swelling. These
studies are anecdotal and based on information from a small
number of patients. Despite minimal data, the authors provided
persistent recommendations to avoid blood draws, blood pressure
readings, and injections in the at-risk arm to reduce the risk of
lymphedema.6,31,37,41 The results of our prospective study provide
evidence-based data that call these guidelines into question.
Clark et al41 evaluated 188 patients with breast cancer who
underwent ALND and correlated skin punctures with risk of
developing lymphedema. With a median follow-up of 3 years,
20.7% (39 of 188) of patients developed arm lymphedema, 9.6%
(18 of 188) of all patients had a skin puncture, and therefore 44%
(8 of 18) of patients with skin puncture developed lymphedema
during the follow-up period.41 This analysis performed a mea-
surement for lymphedema at 6 months and 3 years after surgery

Ferguson et al
 and did not specify the timing of skin puncture; therefore, it did
not take into account other events that could have contributed to
lymphedema.42 In our subset analysis of 159 patients undergoing
ALND, nonprecautionary risk behaviors and specifically skin
puncture were not correlated with increased arm swelling. By
performing arm measurements at regularly timed intervals for as
long as 5 years and recording the number of nonprecautionary
events since the previous measurement, we were able to reduce the
recall bias and more specifically evaluate effects of nonprecau-
tionary behavior on arm swelling.
In contrast, McLaughlin et al6 found no association in risk-
reducing behaviors of patients with and without lymphedema
when evaluated using tape measured circumferential arm mea-
surements. Circumferential tape measurement is limited because
the measurements can be subject to both inter- and intrapersonal
variation.43 Unlike tape measurements, measurements by the
Perometer and use of the RVC and WAC formulas account for
preexisting arm volume differences and detect small volume
changes. In addition, obtaining reproducible, prospective arm
measurements using the Perometer at the same time as collecting
individual incidence of risk-related events could have biased our
data to attribute small volume changes that may have not rep-
resented swelling detectable via circumferential tape measurement
to risk events. Similarly, we found no association with non-
precautionary behavior and increase in arm volume.
The Physical Activity and Lymphedema (PAL) trial assessed
the safety of progressive strength training in breast cancer sur-
vivors and investigated the association of 30 risk factors and arm
swelling.44,45 The authors reported no significant association
between ipsilateral blood draws, blood pressure readings, and air
travel and incident arm swelling.44 The study included clinical
evaluation of arm swelling using water displacement and patient-
reported risk-reducing behaviors at 3, 6, and 12 months after
enrollment.44,45 Patients were given compression sleeves to wear
during exercise and participated in a biweekly, year-long exercise
program. The incidence of lymphedema as defined as interlimb
difference increase of $ 5% was low, which may be due to wearing
a compression sleeve or the exercise program.44,45 In addition, the
incidence of nonprecautionary behaviors was also low, which may be
due to the education about lymphedema provided to participants.
Patients in our cohort do not routinely receive recommendations to
avoid blood draws, injections, or blood pressure readings or to wear a

Risk Reduction Practices for Lymphedema
 compressive sleeve while flying. However, our incidence of risk events
was low, and we enhanced our patient cohort to include patients with
both unilateral and bilateral breast surgery, increasing both the
number of risk events and the overall incidence of lymphedema.
It has been reported that flying incites the development
of lymphedema because of changes in cabin air pressure.6,46 Many
clinicians recommend using risk-reducing compression sleeves when
flying based on few, mostly retrospective, studies.47 In these studies it
is unclear if the reported lymphedema was preexisting or influenced by
other factors. Kilbreath et al48 evaluated changes in arm volume after
short- and long-distance flights and found no change in arm volume
as measured by bioimpedance. In our analysis, we prospectively col-
lected information regarding air travel and quantified arm swelling
with short intervals of follow-up. This design enabled the investigation
of the immediate effects of flying on arm volume and minimized the
risk of recall bias due to the shorter interval of follow up.
In our study, BMI $ 25 lb/in2 at diagnosis, ALND, RLNR, and
cellulitis were significantly associated with arm swelling. High
BMI, RLNR, and ALND are consistently cited in the literature as
risk factors for arm swelling and lymphedema, and our data further
support these claims.6,8,10,11,13-16,19,20,24,49,50 The increased risk for
developing lymphedema after infection including cellulitis is also
well documented in the literature,2,6,22,51 and our results support
these findings. Interestingly in our cohort, episodes of cellulitis
were not associated with a risk event that occurred before the
cellulitis. This may be due to a lower incidence of risk events or to
an overall lower risk of infection after risk events in a modern era of
attention to sterility.
Limitations of the study include a relatively short median
follow-up time of 24 months, low incidence of risk events,
potential for recall bias, and lack of information about patients’
receipt of physical therapy. As lymphedema has been shown to
develop an average of 14.4 months after surgery,8 longer follow-up
time would strengthen the study. Although efforts were made to
ensure regular follow-up visits, future studies using repeat ques-
tionnaires and sensitivity analyses might elucidate the effects of
recall bias. In addition, our analysis did not adjust for the number
of positive lymph nodes because we have not found it to be sig-
nificant in a previous analysis; however, this is an important area
for future investigation.52 Finally, the study did not capture and
therefore was not able to account for women who had physical
therapy, which might have placed them at lower risk for developing
swelling, even after risk events.
This study represents the largest cohort of patients with breast
cancer prospectively screened for lymphedema using preoperative
arm measurements to determine the impact of risk-reducing
practices on arm swelling. We evaluated the association between
risk events and changes in arm volume and found no significant
associations between air travel, blood draws, injections, and blood
pressure readings in the at-risk arm with arm volume increase.
Patients who have a BMI $ 25 lb/in2, underwent ALND or RLNR,
and have had an episode of cellulitis should be more closely
monitored for changes in arm volume because of the significant
association with arm volume increases. The recommendations set
forth in the studies discussed still persist today and unfortunately are
supported with few evidence-based data. Although we cannot
affirmatively state that risk-reduction practices have no effect on arm
swelling, we hope to generate evidence that brings reasonable doubt
to burdensome guidelines and encourage further investigation into
nonprecautionary behaviors and the risk of lymphedema.

Risk Reduction Practices for Lymphedema
 GLOSSARY TERM
sentinel lymph node: the lymph node that is anatomically
located such that it is the first site of lymph drainage from the
location of the primary tumor. It is suspected and assumed that if a
malignancy is going to disseminate via the lymphatic system,
metastases will first be evident in the sentinel lymph node. In this
manner, this lymph node is said to stand guard or sentinel over the
metastatic state of the tumor. For many cancers, the sentinel lymph
node is biopsied as part of the staging process and presence of macro-
or micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node is a negative prog-
nostic factor.
