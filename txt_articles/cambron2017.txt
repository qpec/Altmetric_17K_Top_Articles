Shoe Orthotics for the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled 
2 
Trial 
3 
 
4 
ABSTRACT 
5 
Objectives:  To investigate the efficacy of shoe orthotics with and without chiropractic 
6 
treatment for chronic low back pain as compared to no treatment.  
7 
 
8 
Design: Randomized Controlled Trial 
9 
 
10 
Setting: An integrative medicine teaching clinic at a Midwestern university. 
11 
 
12 
Participants: Two hundred and twenty-five adult subjects with symptomatic low back 
13 
pain of 3 months or longer were recruited from a volunteer sample.   
14 
 
15 
Interventions: Subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups (Orthotics, 
16 
Plus, and Wait-list Groups). The Orthotics Group received custom-made shoe orthotics  
17 
The Plus Group received custom-made orthotics plus chiropractic manipulation, hot or 
18 
cold packs, and manual soft tissue massage. The Wait-list Group received no care. 
19 
 
20 
Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were change in perceived 
21 
back pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) and functional health status (Oswestry) after 6

weeks of study participation. Outcomes were also assessed after 12 weeks and then 
23 
after an additional 3, 6, and 12 months. 
24 
 
25 
Results: After six weeks, all three groups demonstrated significant within-group 
26 
improvement in average back pain, but only the Orthotics and Plus Groups had 
27 
significant within-group improvement in function. When compared to the Wait-list Group, 
28 
the Orthotics Group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in pain (p<0.0001) 
29 
and function (p=0.0068). The addition of chiropractic to orthotics treatment 
30 
demonstrated significantly greater improvements in function (p=0.0278) when compared 
31 
to orthotics alone, but no significant difference in pain (p=0.3431). Group differences at 
32 
12 weeks and later were not significant. 
33 
 
34 
 
35 
Conclusions: Six weeks of prescription shoe orthotics significantly improved back pain 
36 
and dysfunction compared to no treatment. The addition of chiropractic care led to 
37 
higher improvements in function.

Low back pain (LBP) is a steadily increasing global epidemic. Approximately 25% of 
46 
the US adult population experiences LBP during a 3-month time period, and nearly 
47 
double experience back pain over the course of a year.1 Johannes et. al. estimated 
48 
the point prevalence of chronic low back pain (CLBP) to be nearly 31% (95% CI, 29.8-
49 
31.7).2  
50 
 
51 
Podiatrists have connected the use of foot orthoses for the relief low back pain, with the 
52 
thought that back pain may be related to a disruption in the kinetic chain.3-5 However, it 
53 
was not until the past decade that other investigators have begun to study the effect of 
54 
foot function on the kinematics of the knee, hip, pelvis, and thorax.6-10 Rothbart argues 
55 
that forefoot varum (forcing the foot into hyperpronation) is a leading cause of pelvic 
56 
repositioning and mechanical low back pain.11 Khamis and Yizhar, as well as Pinto et 
57 
al., found that induced hyperpronation of the foot (measured via calcaneal eversion) in 
58 
healthy subjects had a significant effect on pelvic alignment.6-7 Although the above 
59 
studies are all pilot projects containing less than 60 subjects, all results significantly 
60 
conclude that foot dysfunction should not be overlooked as a potential contributing 
61 
factor in treating individuals with LBP and dysfunction.  
62 
 
63 
Integrative care is also seen as an alternative for back pain. Lind et. al. found that 
64 
individuals with LBP utilized conventional therapy (45%), complementary and alternative 
65 
medicine (43%), or both (12%) for their pain.12 Chiropractic care was the most common 
66 
form of integrative care utilized (33%).12 Interestingly, 72.1% of chiropractors combine 
67 
spinal manipulation with custom-made shoe orthotics for the treatment of pain.13

Several recent literature reviews indicate that there are no high quality clinical trials 
69 
evaluating the effectiveness of shoe orthotics for the treatment of LBP.14-15 
70 
 
71 
Therefore, the purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) was to  
72 
determine the change in perceived pain levels and functional health status in patients 
73 
with CLBP at the end of 6 weeks of orthotic treatment alone (Orthotic Group) or 
74 
orthotics plus chiropractic treatment (Plus Group) as compared to no treatment (Wait-list 
75 
Group). We hypothesized that orthotics alone would be significantly better than no 
76 
treatment for LBP and disability, and that orthotics plus chiropractic treatment would be 
77 
significantly better than orthotics alone.  
78 
 
79 
 
80 
METHODS 
81 
In this RCT, 225 subjects with CLBP were randomized to one of three groups: Orthotics, 
82 
Plus, or Wait-list. Pain and disability were measured at baseline and at the end of six 
83 
weeks of care or no care. An institutional review board (IRB) approved the trial, the trial 
84 
was registered on clinicaltrials.gov, and all patients provided written informed consent 
85 
prior to study entry. 
86 
  
87 
Participants 
88 
Individuals with CLBP were recruited through media advertising in a Midwestern 
89 
suburban region of the US beginning spring 2014 through early fall 2015.16 Subjects 
90 
were telephone screened for basic inclusion/exclusion criteria (Appendix 1).

92 
Clinic visits 
93 
Subjects who were eligible at the telephone screen were invited to attend a baseline 
94 
exam visit (BV). Upon arrival at the BV, subjects were asked to complete self-
95 
administered questionnaires, provide informed consent, and undergo past medical 
96 
history and low back examination by a licensed chiropractic clinician or trained intern to 
97 
verify the physical inclusion and exclusion criteria (Appendix 1). 
98 
 
99 
All eligible and interested subjects then underwent an orthotic assessment including a 
100 
standing static evaluation of posture (Foot Posture Index),17 and foot pressure mapping 
101 
(BodyView Imaging Unit; Foot Levelers, Inc). Images of the bottom of the foot were 
102 
quantified based on a color replacement algorithm (Foot Levelers, Inc), which was used 
103 
to calculate the Staheli index, Chippaux-Smirak index, arch angle, and arch index.  
104 
 
105 
Once the orthotics returned from production, the subject was scheduled for the 
106 
randomization visit (RV). During the RV, the patient was randomized and the 
107 
clinician/intern discussed procedures for proper use of orthotics with those in the 
108 
Orthotics or Plus Groups and reminded those in the Wait-list Group that s/he would 
109 
receive orthotics at the week-6 visit. Those randomized to the Plus Group immediately 
110 
began chiropractic treatment.  
111 
 
112 
Subjects were asked to return for a week-12 follow-up visit to check–in with the 
113 
physician and complete questionnaires.

Randomization Process 
116 
Prior to study initiation, a randomization scheme was created by a Research Fellow not 
117 
associated with this clinical trial. Randomization was based on a random numbers table 
118 
with each random allocation being placed in consecutively-numbered, sealed manila 
119 
envelopes.  
120 
 
121 
Interventions 
122 
Orthotics Group 
123 
Seventy-five of the 225 participating subjects were randomized into the Orthotics Group 
124 
and received two pairs of custom-made leather shoe orthotics containing supports for 
125 
the medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal, and the anterior transverse arches 
126 
(“Moderate Luxury Full Length” and the “Tight Fitting Luxury ¾ Length” dress modelsa). 
127 
The materials used in construction of the orthotics were specific to the gait cycle and 
128 
included a shock absorbing polymer placed in the heel to assist during heel strike 
129 
(Zorbacel), a stiffer polymer for support in mid-stance (StanceGuard), and a springy 
130 
polymer in the forefoot of the orthotic to assist in toe-off (Propacel). The size and shape 
131 
of the orthotic supports were made based on the height and weight of the patient related 
132 
to the foot scan and measurements taken. Additional modifications to orthotics were 
133 
made on a case-by-case basis, dependent on patient presentation and/or comfort level 
134 
post-break-in period.

Some evidence exists suggesting a 1-2 week break-in or acclimation period with 
137 
orthotic use for foot and ankle dysfunction18-19; however, little is known about 
138 
acclimation for low back pain patients. Instructions regarding the break-in period 
139 
(approximately 2-3 weeks) were provided, including informing the subjects to gradually 
140 
increase the amount of time the orthotics were worn and disclosure that there may be a 
141 
slight increase or change in symptoms while the body acclimates to the orthotics.  
142 
 
143 
Plus Group 
144 
Seventy-five of the 225 participating subjects were randomized into the Plus Group. 
145 
These subjects also received two pairs of custom-made shoe orthotics, in addition to 
146 
six-weeks of chiropractic treatment for 1-4 visits per week. The chiropractic care could 
147 
include treatment of the cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spine, as well as, the lower 
148 
extremities for the LBP complaint. Specific therapies allowed in this study included 
149 
hot/cold packs, brief manual massage, or chiropractic manipulations including high 
150 
velocity, low amplitude manipulation (HVLA) and/or flexion-distraction (FD) therapy.  
151 
These chiropractic techniques along with the ancillary care have been widely used in 
152 
practice and in clinical studies. Many studies have investigated the use of HVLA20-27and 
153 
FD28-41for the treatment of CLBP,20-27which are among the most common types of 
154 
chiropractic manipulations utilized in practice13 and are considered to be  "established 
155 
treatments" based on practice guidelines.42 The decisions regarding the type(s) of care 
156 
to utilize were made by 7 different licensed chiropractic physicians with at least 3 years 
157 
of clinical experience and all manipulations were administered by those physicians, 
158 
while initial intake and ancillary care could have been provided by an intern.

In practice, the amount of care a patient receives may vary based on pain severity and 
161 
chronicity. According to research, most chiropractic cases resolve within six weeks of 
162 
intervention42 and include 2-3 weekly visits43 for a total of 5 to 18 visits.20-41, 44In one 
163 
study on HVLA for LBP, clinical and statistical improvements for CLBP were more likely 
164 
with 3-4 chiropractic treatments per week rather than 1- 2 times.26 Therefore, in this 
165 
study, Plus Group subjects were asked to complete 1-4 visits per week for each of the 
166 
six weeks of chiropractic care for a range of 6-24 visits total. 
167 
 
168 
Wait-list Group 
169 
The remaining study participants were randomized to a 6-week wait period, after which 
170 
they were also given the same two pairs of custom-made shoe orthotics. Subjects were 
171 
not excluded from the study for treatment outside of the study parameters, but such 
172 
treatment was discouraged and documented. 
173 
 
174 
Patient safety  
175 
Patients completed bi-weekly questionnaires to assess pain level, disability, and the 
176 
use, comfort, and effects of the shoe orthotics. If the patient mentioned any side-effects 
177 
from care, the clinician was notified and the patient was re-examined if necessary. No 
178 
patient in the study experienced any adverse event.

All assessments were collected either in the traditional paper format or online through 
182 
SurveyMonkey, a secure online web-based service. The primary outcome measures in 
183 
this study were the average LBP level measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale 
184 
(NPRS) and low back disability measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 
185 
baseline,,; 6 weeks; 12 weeks, and after an additional 3 months, 6 months, and 12 
186 
months.  
187 
 
188 
The NPRS includes numbers from 0-10, wherein the patient selects the number that 
189 
best describes the LBP during a specified time period. Four separate scales were 
190 
measured: LBP level now, typical or average pain level in the past 2 weeks, pain level 
191 
at its best in the past 2 weeks, and pain level at its worst in the past 2 weeks.  
192 
 
193 
The NPRS is one of the most frequently used methods for the measurement of clinical 
194 
pain. While the NPRS has been previously assessed for validity and reliability, only one 
195 
study has attempted to characterize its responsiveness in patients with LBP.45 Although 
196 
previous pain research has shown the use of a composite mean of the now, average, 
197 
and worst scores,46 newer research indicates that composite measures of pain are not 
198 
statistically better than individual pain ratings specifically for studies assessing change 
199 
in pain with group comparisons and large samples.47  Therefore, the “typical or average 
200 
pain over the past two weeks” was used as our primary outcome measure.  
201 
 
202 
One of most commonly used measurements in the literature for low back disability 
203 
particularly in studies involving orthotics is the ODI48-53, a condition-specific

questionnaire covering 10 areas of daily living The measured areas include: pain 
205 
intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, 
206 
and traveling. Each category is scored on a continuum from 0-5 points, for a possible 
207 
total score of 50, described as “100% disability.” Validity measures of the ODI have 
208 
demonstrated Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.76-0.99,49, 54-55 and reliability 
209 
measures have demonstrated an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.83 for test-retest 
210 
reliability.55  
211 
 
212 
In order to better assess treatment effect and adherence to care, consistency/frequency 
213 
of orthotic use (number of days and number of hours worn), symptoms experienced 
214 
during use, comfort levels, and other healthcare utilization for LBP were collected every 
215 
two weeks of participation via self-report survey by the participant. Adherence to care 
216 
was defined as at least 1 chiropractic treatment per week for 6 weeks (Plus Group) and 
217 
at least 8 days of orthotic wear time every two weeks post break-in period (Orthotic and 
218 
Plus Groups). No participant was excluded for non-compliance.  
219 
 
220 
Data collection through six weeks was completed for all participants by mid-October 
221 
2015. 
222 
 
223 
As secondary outcome measures, the NPRS for average LBP and ODI measures were 
224 
also collected at a week-12 follow-up visit and again via mail or online 3, 6, and 12 
225 
months after the date of that final visit.

Due to the nature of the study, neither subjects nor research personnel were blind to the

231 
Statistical analysis 
232 
The sample size for this study was calculated for a two-sided independent samples t-
233 
test with type I error rate α=.05. Samples of 64 per group will provide 80% power to 
234 
detect a medium effect size. Effect size is calculated as the difference in the means 
235 
divided by the SD of the difference, where 0.5 is considered medium and 0.8 is 
236 
considered large effect. The previous pilot study demonstrated a large effect size.51 
237 
Calculating for a medium effect size is more conservative, but increases the likelihood 
238 
of detecting meaningful differences in the study. Correcting for a potential of <20% 
239 
withdrawal rate, the sample size of 75 subjects per group was set.  
240 
 
241 
Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) scores of at least 30% change from 
242 
baseline were statistically assessed56 by group through secondary chi-square analyses 
243 
(df = 2).   
244 
 
245 
Patients were analyzed according to their randomly assigned treatment (intention-to-
246 
treat analysis), regardless of whether or not they received the full treatment or were lost 
247 
to follow-up.

Baseline characteristics were summarized with basic descriptive statistics and stratified 
250 
by treatment group. Tables and analyses include imputed week 6 data (taken from 
251 
week 4 when no week 6 survey was completed); therefore, sample sizes may be 
252 
different then numbers reported in Figure I. Baseline differences by treatment were 
253 
tested using one-way ANOVA or chi-square tests (Table 1).  Each within group mean 
254 
change score was tested at each follow-up point against zero using paired t-tests, a 
255 
95% confidence interval was calculated for each mean change score, and means were 
256 
compared across the three groups at each time point using one-way ANOVA (Tables 
257 
2and 3). Multiple linear regression was used to test for treatment effects on change 
258 
scores at each time point, adjusting for baseline outcome values (Table 4). 
259 
 
260 
 
261 
RESULTS 
262 
A total of 682 people underwent the telephone screen and 416 were eligible. Of those, 
263 
290 presented for the baseline visit and 225 subjects were randomized (Figure I). There 
264 
was no evidence of significant differences across treatments for any baseline 
265 
characteristics (Table 1).  
266 
 
267 
The most common types of chiropractic therapies administered to Plus Group 
268 
participants included brief manual massage (77.6%); thoracic and SI HVLA 
269 
manipulation (45.8% and 58.3% respectively); and FD mobilization (54.6%, Table 5). 
270 
The majority of study participants were compliant with treatment. In the Plus Group, 
271 
86.7% of participants were compliant with chiropractic care and 96.8% were compliant

with orthotic use. In the Orthotics Group, 92.5% were compliant with orthotic use. By the 
273 
end of week 6, Plus and Orthotics Group participants wore the orthotics an average of 
274 
11.9 and 12.9 days respectively over a two week period. Number of hours worn daily 
275 
may have impacted the overall study result, but seemingly increased following the 
276 
break-in period (Table 6). 
277 
 
278 
After six weeks, average low back pain decreased significantly in all three groups (Table 
279 
2, Figure II), demonstrating less than 1-point improvement in the control group yet 1.9 
280 
and 2.3 point improvements in the Orthotics and Plus Groups respectively. Decreases 
281 
in pain from baseline remain significant in all three groups for all time points out to 12 
282 
months.  The between-group assessment of average pain demonstrated no significant 
283 
differences at baseline, but a significant difference in week-6 average pain scores 
284 
(p<0.0001) as well as in change scores between groups (p<0.0001). The within group 
285 
change scores from baseline to every follow-up through 12 months were statistically 
286 
significant. However, there were no significant between group differences at week 12 or 
287 
later.  
288 
 
289 
 
290 
Within-group disability scores were significantly improved in the Orthotics and Plus 
291 
Groups after six weeks of care, with an average of 2.3 and 4.3 point improvements in 
292 
the Orthotics and Plus Groups respectively (Table 4, Figure III). However, the within-
293 
group scores were not significantly different pre-post Wait-list control. The mean 
294 
Oswestry scores did not differ across the three treatments at baseline (p=.5705), but at

week-6 the mean scores varied across treatments (p=.0146) and there was strong 
296 
evidence that the mean change scores varied with treatment (p<.0001).  Improvements 
297 
across time remained significant out to 12 months in all three groups.  There is some 
298 
evidence of a difference in mean change between treatments at 3 months after the 12 
299 
week point (p=.0231), with less improvement in the wait-list control group.  Mean 
300 
change is not different between groups at 12 weeks, or a 6 or 12 months later. 
301 
 
302 
Adjusted for baseline values (Table 4), there was a significantly higher improvement in 
303 
the Orthotics Group compared to the Wait-list Group for both outcomes (p<.0001 for

average pain, p=.0068 for the Oswestry). The addition of chiropractic care to the orthotic 
305 
treatment demonstrated better outcomes than orthotic care alone, with the contrast 
306 
being statistically significant for the Oswestry (p=.0278) but not for average pain 
307 
(p=.3431). Changes were not significantly different between groups at later time points 
308 
for either outcome. 
309 
 
310 
The MCID (proportions of patients with 30% or more improvement in pain or disability) 
311 
is summarized and compared across treatment groups in Tables 7 and 8.  The three 
312 
groups are significantly different at six weeks (p<.0001 for both pain and disability).  
313 
Similar to results for continuous change scores, the best results were in the Orthotics 
314 
Plus group in which 70% had a decrease in pain and 56% a decrease in disability of 
315 
30% or more compared to baseline; followed by 58% and 38% respectively in the 
316 
Orthotics group, and only 22% and 20% in the Wait-List Control group.  When 
317 
comparing only the Orthotics and the Wait-List group at six weeks, the Orthotics group 
318

is significantly better than the Wait-List Control group (p=.0174 for pain and p<.0001 for 
319 
disability). Compared to the Orthotics group, the addition of chiropractic care in the 
320 
Orthotics Plus group demonstrates a significant improvement in pain (p=.0312) but not 
321 
for disability (p=.1383).   
322 
 
323 
 
324 
DISCUSSION 
325 
This is the first large-scale clinical trial assessing orthotics for treatment of LBP. As 
326 
hypothesized, LBP and dysfunction were significantly improved with custom-made shoe 
327 
orthotics compared to a wait-list control group, and disability was more significantly 
328 
improved with the addition of chiropractic care. However, scores were not significantly 
329 
different between the Orthotics and Plus Groups. This lack of difference is difficult to 
330 
understand, although a floor effect may have come into play with the pain measures. 
331 
Future research may want to focus on the difference in pain scores for patients with 
332 
higher baseline levels of pain.  
333 
 
334 
The MCID data in this study mirrored the change score data in that there were 
335 
significant group differences for pain and disability at week 6. The effect of care was no 
336 
longer significantly different between groups after this time point; however, after week 6 
337 
all treatment groups were provided with orthotics so it is not surprising that differences 
338 
in group effects were negligible. It is noteworthy that for most time points after week 6, 
339 
the MCID data remained relatively stable with no large decreases in the proportion of 
340 
 MANUSCRIPT

16 
 
subjects who had at least 30% improvement in pain or disability compared to baseline, 
341 
potentially demonstrating a lasting effect of care with the orthotic treatment.  
342 
 
343 
 
344 
There are several small-scale or lower quality studies investigating the use of shoe 
345 
orthotics for the treatment of LBP demonstrating mixed results.11, 51-53, 57-61 Likewise, the 
346 
studies that included chiropractic care along with shoe orthotics demonstrated trends 
347 
toward improvement of low back pain and/or lower extremity symptoms62-65 although 
348 
there was some variability in outcomes.  
349 
 
350 
One small-scale study assessed an orthotics group, orthotics plus chiropractic group, 
351 
and a no-treatment control group. This study demonstrated that chiropractic plus shoe 
352 
orthotics improved foot and ankle symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and 
353 
recreation, and quality of life in workers with LBP whose job required them to stand at 
354 
least 6 hours daily64; however, there was no significant benefit in reducing pain levels in 
355 
any of the groups compared to baseline. Inconsistency of orthotic use was described as 
356 
potentially confounding the study results. Our study did measure frequency of use of the 
357 
orthotic and found that participants were compliant with orthotic wear throughout the 
358 
study, which most likely improved the reliability of our results. We also calculated 
359 
between group differences to determine group effects.  
360 
 
361 
A similar small-scale study compared chiropractic plus orthotics versus chiropractic plus 
362 
sham orthotics.65 The results demonstrated that both groups improved, but there were 
363 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
17 
 
no significant differences between the groups in terms of pain or disability indicating that 
364 
the orthotics did not add to the treatment benefit. The authors in this study commented 
365 
that future trials should include subjects who wear orthotics in a weight-bearing capacity 
366 
each day because lack of such wear may have affected their outcomes. Our study 
367 
included subjects who were manual and non-manual laborers, but we did not measure 
368 
the amount of standing on a daily basis in order to compare findings.  
369 
 
370 
A previous feasibility study by this research group51 demonstrated changes in chronic 
371 
low back pain and disability with the use of shoe orthotics for 6 weeks compared with a 
372 
wait-list control group, as well as the feasibility of a large-scale study. This study 
373 
demonstrated results similar to the current large-scale study.  
374 
 
375 
Of note is that none of the three previous studies51, 64-65 assessed MCID scores in their 
376 
analyses; therefore, the results cannot be fully compared with our current findings 
377 
regarding MCID.  
378 
 
379 
Study limitations 
380 
There were possible study limitations present in this clinical trial. First, our subjects were 
381 
diagnosed with several low back conditions and some diagnoses may respond better to 
382 
shoe orthotics and/or chiropractic care than others. Subjects and clinicians were aware 
383 
of the group assignment, possibly affecting the care rendered as well as the self-report 
384 
outcomes of pain and disability. Finally, the natural history of LBP as well as other 
385 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
18 
 
psychological and/or physiological events may have led to changes in pain over time, 
386 
for which we had no control.  
387 
 
388 
 
389 
CONCLUSIONS 
390 
This large-scale clinical trial demonstrated that LBP and disability were significantly 
391 
improved after six weeks of orthotics care compared to a wait-list control, and that the 
392 
addition of chiropractic care with the orthotics demonstrated a significant improvement 
393 
in the disability scores compared to orthotics alone. The within-group change scores 
394 
from baseline to every follow-up through 12 months were statistically significant. 
395 
However, there were no significant between-group differences at week 12 or later.

cross-over effects within this study from previous treatment. 
3.   Current or future litigation for low back pain. 
4.   Not fluent or literate in the English language. We were not able to provide multiple 
translators within this study.  
5.   Brain disorders (i.e.: dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease) that would lead to difficulty in 
questionnaire completion.  
6.   Chronic pain other than low back pain, such as fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. 
7.   Clinically significant chronic inflammatory spinal arthritis.  
8.   Spinal pathology or fracture. 
9.   Progressive neurologic deficits due to nerve root or spinal cord compression, including 
symptoms/ signs of cauda equina syndrome.  
10. History of bleeding disorder.  
11. Known arterial aneurysm. 
12. Previous lumbar spine surgery. 
13. Severe skeletal deformity of the foot.
