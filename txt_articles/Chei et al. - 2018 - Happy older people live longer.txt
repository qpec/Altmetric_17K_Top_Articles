Abstract
Objective: research on the role of positive affect, such as happiness, on health outcomes is burgeoning. Within this context,
evidence for an inverse effect of happiness on mortality is inconclusive. Furthermore, few studies link happiness with mor-
tality among older people, and in Asian populations. We examine the association between happiness and all-cause mortality
among older people in Singapore.
Methods: data for 4,478 Singaporeans aged ≥60 years enrolled in a nationally-representative longitudinal survey (three
waves: 2009; 2011; 2015) were utilised. Happiness, at baseline, in 2009, was measured using three positively-worded items
from the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and considered in two distinct ways in the analyses—con-
tinuous (‘happiness score’ [0–6]) and binary (happy [score = 6]/unhappy). All-cause mortality, until 31 December 2015, was

 assessed primarily using administrative databases, supplemented by data from survey waves 2 and 3. Multivariable Cox
regression models assessed the association of ‘happiness score’ and the ‘binary happiness variable’ (separate models for
each) with all-cause mortality.
Results: the likelihood of all-cause mortality was lower by 9% (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval]:
0.91 [0.87–0.95]) for each unit increase in ‘happiness score’, and was 19% lower for happy, versus unhappy, older people
(HR: 0.81 [0.68–0.97]).
Conclusions: happiness is associated with reduced likelihood of all-cause mortality among older people in an Asian popula-
tion, with the benefit observed even for incremental increases in happiness. Activities, policies and programs that maintain
or improve happiness may be beneficial for a longer life among older people.
Keywords: happiness, mortality, aged, Asia, older people.
Introduction
There is a growing interest in the role that positive affect
plays in improving population health [1]. Many studies
report positive affect to be associated with better health
outcomes, such as lower mortality, reduced morbidity and
functional independence, in both community-dwelling and
clinical populations [2–10]. However, evidence for an
inverse effect of happiness, a form of positive affect, on
mortality is inconclusive [2, 6–9, 11–14].
The key to the inconsistency in the association of happi-
ness with mortality is the variability in controlling for con-
founders across studies. For example, in a study of over
700,000 English and Scottish women, the association
between happiness and mortality was not seen after adjust-
ment for socio-demographic, lifestyle and health factors [2].
Similarly, a 15-year follow-up study of 861 Dutch older per-
sons aged 65–85 years observed that the inverse link
between happiness and mortality was not statistically signifi-
cant after adjustment for physical activity and prevalent
morbidity [8]. Furthermore, in studies that report this asso-
ciation, psychosocial variables, such as loneliness [15] and
social networks [16], which are potential confounders, are
frequently not accounted for [2, 7–9, 11].
Another limitation of existing studies on happiness and
mortality is the generalisability of their findings only to cer-
tain populations. Firstly, only a few studies have focused
exclusively on older people [8, 13], i.e. individuals aged 60
years or older. Secondly, most of the studies that do report
the association of interest are from Western countries,
hence, constraining the findings to this socio-cultural con-
text. Cross-cultural research suggests that the value and
consequences of happiness may differ across cultures [17].
For
instance,
East
Asians
are
more
inclined
than
Westerners to think that it is not appropriate to express
happiness in many social situations [17]. Another study
found that positive emotions were associated with depres-
sive symptoms among European Americans and Asian
Americans but not immigrant Asians [18]. Therefore,
studying the association of happiness with mortality among
older people in an Asian country would expand the scope
of the extant literature examining this association.
In addressing the above mentioned limitations, we
assessed if happiness is associated with all-cause mortality
in a nationally-representative sample of older people in
Singapore, a Southeast Asian nation. Furthermore, given
the variability in the associations of positive affect with
mortality by age [5, 19] and by sex [20], we investigated if
age or sex moderate the association between happiness and
all-cause mortality.
Method
Study design and participants
Data from a nationally-representative longitudinal survey
(Panel on Health and Ageing among Singaporean Elderly
[PHASE]; Wave 1 in 2009, Wave 2 in 2011–2012 and Wave
3
in
2015)
of
community-dwelling
older
people
in
Singapore, combined with information on their date of
death, until 31 December 2015, from the national Registry
of Births and Deaths databases, were utilised. Details of
Wave

are
available
elsewhere
[21]—briefly,
4,990
Singapore citizens and permanent residents aged 60 years
or older living at home (or their proxy respondents, if
unable to respond due to health reasons) were surveyed. Of
these, 3,103 and 1,572 participants were re-interviewed at
Waves 2 and 3, respectively. The Institutional Review Board
at the National University of Singapore ethics approved the
longitudinal survey and matching with the deaths databases.
Our analytical sample was restricted to 4,478 of the 4,990
Wave 1 participants, after sequentially excluding those with:
(1) missing value for happiness (n = 460; participants
unable to respond themselves due to their ill-health had a
proxy respondent, who did not answer the items on happi-
ness), (2) severe cognitive impairment (n = 9; score>seven
on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire [22];
uncertainty of self-report of happiness) and (3) mortality
within 6 months of their Wave 1 interview (n = 43; con-
founding due to asymptomatic life-limiting diseases).

 Happiness
Happiness is better assessed using the frequency, than
intensity, of a positive affect [23]. At Wave one, participants
were asked how often in the past week (Never or Rarely: 0;
Sometimes: 1; Often: 2) they experienced the following: ‘I
felt happy’, ‘I enjoyed life’ and ‘I felt hope about the future’,
using a 12-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [24]. Previous studies
have used the ‘positive’ items from the CES-D to measure
happiness specifically [16], and positive affect in general [4,
10, 25, 26]. While most of these studies use four positive
items from the CES-D, the 12-item CES-D used in
PHASE did not include the item ‘I felt I was just as good
as other people’. Exploratory factor analysis of the 12-item
CES-D scale, verifying the structural validity of grouping
the three items in our data, supported a 2-factor model,
with the three items having factor loadings ≥0.5 for a com-
mon factor (not shown; available on request).
A review of studies linking positive psychological well-
being with mortality suggested that findings vary with how
the variable for well-being is considered in the analysis [3].
Thus, to check the robustness of our association of interest,
we operationalised happiness in two distinct ways: (1) a
continuous ‘happiness score’ (sum of scores on the three
items; range: 0–6; higher value indicates a greater extent of
happiness), and (2) a ‘binary happiness variable’ (happy
[happiness score = 6]/unhappy [happiness score≤5]). In
sensitivity analysis, detailed in Appendix 1, available in Age
and Ageing online, we operationalised happiness in alternate
ways, such as using an alternative cut-off (≥5) for the ‘bin-
ary happiness variable’.
All-cause mortality
We assessed all-cause mortality, until 31 December 2015,
using the national Registry of Births and Deaths databases,
supplemented by data collected during survey Waves 2
and 3.
Confounders
Our analysis controlled for a range of demographic, life-
style, health and social variables of participants at Wave 1
(details of confounders are presented in Appendix 2, avail-
able in Age and Ageing online).
Statistical analysis
The confounders were summarised with sampling weights,
by ‘binary happiness variable’ (happy/unhappy) and all-
cause mortality until 31 December 2015 (alive/dead). We
assessed the statistical significance of differences, across
happy/unhappy and across alive/dead, using student’s t-test
and chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables,
respectively. Kaplan–Meir estimates were used to generate
unadjusted survival curves by ‘binary happiness variable’;
the two curves were compared using the log-rank test.
Univariable and multivariable (adjusting for all confounders)
associations (hazard ratios [HR] and associated 95% confi-
dence intervals [CI]) of the ‘happiness score’ and the ‘binary
happiness variable’ with all-cause mortality were assessed
using Cox regression analysis. In the multivariable models,
we introduced cross-product terms for age (as 60–74/≥75)
and sex with the happiness variable to assess for moder-
ation; the terms were retained only if they were significant.
Finally, we tested for a non-linear association between ‘hap-
piness score’ and all-cause mortality using restricted cubic
splines with four knots in multivariable Cox regression ana-
lysis; the first knot (score = 0) was used as the reference. In
sensitivity analysis, the multivariable association of the alter-
native operationalisations of happiness with all-cause mor-
tality were assessed. All analyses were performed using the
SAS statistical package version 9.4 (Statistical Analysis
System Inc., Cary, NC), except for the restricted cubic
spline plots, which were fitted in Stata version 14 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). A P-value of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The average follow-up duration was 6.2 ± 1.4 years, and
the average ‘happiness score’ was 4.16 ± 1.66. Of the 4,478
older people in the analytical sample, 1,486 (33.2%) were
happy. All considered confounders, except body mass index
category, were associated with the ‘binary happiness vari-
able’. A total of 813 (18.2%) participants died until 31
December 2015. Again, all considered confounders were
associated with all-cause mortality (Appendix 3, available in
Age and Ageing online).
Among the 1,486 happy older people, a total of 217
(14.6%) deaths were observed until 31 December 2015.
The corresponding proportion was higher (19.9%; n = 596)
among the 2,992 unhappy older people. There was a signifi-
cant difference in the unadjusted survival curves between
happy and unhappy older people (log-rank test P < 0.001);

 the curve for happy older people was higher through the
follow-up (Figure 1).
Cox regression analysis revealed a significant inverse
association of happiness with all-cause mortality. Compared
to unhappy older people, those happy had a 19% reduced
likelihood of all-cause mortality (multivariable HR [95%
CI]: 0.81 [0.68–0.97]). Further, for each unit increase in
‘happiness score’, the likelihood of all-cause mortality was
reduced by 9% (multivariable HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.87–
0.95]) (Table 1 and Appendix 4, available in Age and Ageing
online). In either multivariable analysis, the cross-product
terms for age and sex with the variable for happiness were
not significant. The linear association of ‘happiness score’
with the likelihood of all-cause mortality was confirmed by
the restricted cubic spline regression (P-value for non-
linearity = 0.87) (Appendix 5, available in Age and Ageing
online). Inverse associations of happiness with all-cause
mortality were also observed in the sensitivity analysis
(Appendix 1, available in Age and Ageing online).
Discussion
Happy older people live longer. We observed happiness to
be associated with reduced likelihood of all-cause mortality
among older people. The association was consistent regard-
less of whether happiness was defined as a continuous or a
binary variable, observed even after adjusting for a range
of demographic, lifestyle, health and social variables.
Furthermore, the association did not vary by age or by sex,
and was present even when happiness was operationalised
alternatively in our sensitivity analysis. Our finding not only
supports the growing literature linking happiness with lower
mortality [7, 9, 11], but also extends it to older people and
Asian populations. In fact, we posit that the true association
of happiness with mortality may even be stronger than
observed in our study; given reports of the limited expres-
sion of happiness among East Asians [17], it is possible
that the extent of happiness was underreported by our
study participants, resulting in estimates that are closer to
the null.
While acknowledging the presence of a bi-directional rela-
tionship of happiness with health and lifestyle factors, the
potential pathways that link happiness with a reduced
likelihood of mortality could be through improved physical
and mental health as well as maintenance of a healthy life-
style, such as adequate sleep and physical activity [5, 27].
The theorised underlying physiological or biological mechan-
isms
include
those
involving
cardiovascular
function,
immunologic function and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
axis [5]. Many of the proposed biological mechanisms are
based on experimental studies that artificially manipulated
positive affect in laboratory settings; studies that examine if
such controlled changes in positive affect are mirrored in
real-world settings are warranted [5].
The variability in the conceptualisation and measurement
of happiness make it difficult to directly compare the associ-
ation of happiness with health outcomes across studies. For
example, happiness has been conceptualised to comprise
evaluative well-being (e.g. life satisfaction), hedonic well-being
(e.g. everyday feelings or mood, such as happiness) and eude-
monic well-being (e.g. meaning and purpose of life) [28].
Likewise, there are several approaches for measuring happi-
ness, the common ones being the use of all or a subset of
questions of a structured well-being scale [8, 11], positive
items on the CES-D scale [4, 10, 19, 25, 26, 29] and single-
item scales [2, 9]. For reasons stated in the Method section, we
measured happiness using three positive items on the CES-D
scale. Nonetheless, given concerns that these items may not be
solely assessing happiness but also tapping into other con-
structs, such as optimism [5], we performed sensitivity analyses
to separately examine the association of the items represent-
ing hedonic happiness (‘I felt happy’, ‘I enjoyed life’) and
hope (‘I felt hope about the future’) on all-cause mortality,
and found similar inverse associations with mortality in
these analyses.
Compared to the six studies that have assessed the associ-
ation of the positive items on the CES-D scale with mortality,
our observed findings are largely similar [4, 10, 19, 25, 26, 29].
Two of the studies, among older persons, observed an
inverse association of the positive items on the CES-D scale
with mortality in their entire sample [4, 25], while two more
observed it only in sub-populations, such as older persons
aged 61–80 years and persons with diabetes [10, 19]. A
recent study observed the inverse relationship among older
persons before controlling for other subjective health mea-
sures, such as quality of life [26]. Only one study, not

 exclusive to older persons, reported a null finding [29].
Thus, studies on older persons have consistently found an
inverse association between positive affect, as measured on
the CES-D scale, with mortality. This suggests that older
persons may especially benefit from increases in positive
effect.
Our study finding, coupled with findings from previous
studies demonstrating ways to enhance happiness [30, 31],
has implications for both older people and policymakers
striving to increase life expectancy. At an individual level,
older people may have longevity benefits through participat-
ing in activities shown to increase happiness or psycho-
logical well-being—such as expressing gratitude, a daily
focus on the ‘good’ things that happen to them through the
day, and identifying and utilising one’s strength of character
[30, 31]. Suggestions for policymakers to help individuals
live happier lives include promotion of community engage-
ment, encouragement of strong social networks, provision
of a decent material standard of living, fostering of freedom
and democracy, and good governance [9, 12].
Our study has several strengths. In addition to our focus
on older people residing in an Asian country, our inclusion
of a wide range of confounders is a key strength. An
important limitation in previous studies is the exclusion or
inadequate measurement of health-related confounders in
analyses linking happiness and mortality [2]. To counter
this, we controlled for several health and health-risk (life-
style) variables. We also controlled for psychosocial vari-
ables of loneliness [15] and social networks [16], which are
not often considered in most studies [2, 7–9, 11]. Other
strengths include the use of a nationally-representative sam-
ple and the comprehensive assessment of mortality using
national administrative databases.
The study also has its limitations. Firstly, physical activity
was operationalised through a simple question (whether
respondents go for a walk for exercise purposes), suggest-
ing the possibility of residual confounding by physical activ-
ity status. However, inclusion of questions on limitations in
mobility, activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental
ADLs would have likely reduced such residual confounding.
Secondly, except for most of the demographic variables,
adjusting for the lifestyle, health and social variables may be
considered as over-adjusting given their potential to be on
the causal pathway between happiness and mortality. For
example, happiness affects health, and good health has
found to predict subsequent positive affect [28]. However,
for many of the variables, such as physical activity, alcohol
intake and social networks, empirical data suggests their
causal association with feelings of happiness [32–35] and
with mortality [36–38]. Thus, we adjusted for them as con-
founders. Thirdly, while we attempt to mitigate unmeasured
confounding either due to undiagnosed or unreported life-
limiting health conditions or due to lack of information on
severity of known health conditions by excluding deaths
within six months of the baseline interview, we do acknow-
ledge the presence of residual confounding. Fourthly, we did
not have access to data on the cause of death from the
administrative databases, thus, we are unable to examine the
association of happiness with cause-specific mortality. Fifthly,
we had a relatively short follow-up term for our cohort; it
will be of interest to see if the associations are maintained in
the long-term. Similarly, we were only able to consider the
baseline status of happiness. Larger studies, with longer
follow-up durations should explore the association of change
in happiness with mortality. Finally, we assessed chronic dis-
eases through the self-report of ever-diagnosis by a medical
professional, which may underestimate the number of chronic
diseases. However, given the high rates of screening for
chronic diseases in Singapore [39], the undetected number of
chronic diseases is unlikely to be large.
In conclusion, happy older people live longer. Given our
finding of a linear association between happiness and
reduced all-cause mortality, even small increments in happi-
ness may be beneficial for older people. Activities, policies
and programs that maintain or improve happiness may con-
tribute to a longer life among older people.
Key points
• Only few existing studies linking happiness with reduced
mortality focus exclusively on older people. Further, all
studies reporting this link are from Western countries.
• This study is the first to report this link in a representative
sample of older people residing in Singapore, an Asian
country.
• Happiness is associated with reduced likelihood of all-
cause mortality among older Singaporeans.
• The benefit is observed even for incremental increases in
happiness.

*Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) database. In
2008, Critical Path Institute, in collaboration with the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution,
formed the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). The Coalition brings together patient groups, biopharmaceutical
companies, and scientists from academia, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA),
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The Coalition
Against Major Diseases (CAMD) includes over 200 scientists from member and non-member organizations. The data available in
the CAMD database has been volunteered by CAMD member companies and non-member organizations.
Abstract
Objective: retest effects may be attributed to ‘repeated content’ in neuropsychological tests such as words in word list-
learning tests, or the ‘testing context’ which involves procedural memory and reduced test anxiety following repeated admin-
istration. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) severely impairs episodic memory, so longitudinal cognitive testing among people with
dementia may reveal the relative contributions of content versus context to retest effects in neuropsychological testing.
Method: we used data from the Critical Path Institute’s repository of placebo arm data from randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of dementia conducted by participating pharmaceutical companies (N = 990 people, 4,170 study visits, up to 2.4
years of follow-up). To estimate retest effects on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), we used linear regressions
with random effects for people and time, adjusting for age, sex and race, and longitudinal quantile regressions.
