Abstract
Background—Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an effective experimental food allergy treatment 
that is limited by treatment withdrawal and the frequent reversibility of desensitization if 
interrupted. Newly-diagnosed preschool children may have clinical and immunological 
characteristics more amenable to treatment.
Objective—To test the safety, effectiveness, and feasibility of early OIT (E-OIT) in the treatment 
of peanut allergy.
Methods—We enrolled 40 children aged 9–36 months with suspected or known peanut allergy. 
Qualifying subjects reacted to peanut during an entry food challenge and were block-randomized 
1:1 to receive E-OIT at goal maintenance doses of 300 or 3000 mg/day in a double-blinded 
fashion. The primary endpoint, sustained unresponsiveness at four weeks after stopping E-OIT (4-
SU), was assessed by DBPCFC either upon achieving four pre-specified criteria, or after three 
maintenance years. Peanut-specific immune responses were serially analyzed. Outcomes were 
compared to 154 matched standard-care controls.
Results—Of 40 consented subjects, three (7.5%) did not qualify. Overall, 29/37 (78%) in the 
intent-to-treat analysis achieved 4-SU (300 mg arm, 17/20 [85%]; 3000 mg, 12/17 [71%], p=0.43) 
over a median of 29 months. Per-protocol, the overall proportion achieving 4-SU was 29/32 
(91%). Peanut-specific IgE levels significantly declined in E-OIT-treated children, who were 19

INTRODUCTION
Over the last 20 years, peanut allergy has become a global public health problem affecting 
now 1.5–3% of children (1, 2). The lack of therapeutic options is a substantial unmet need. 
In previous randomized studies of children grade-school age and older, oral immunotherapy 
(OIT) has shown promise as an immunomodulatory treatment that can provide a margin of 
safety protecting against a potentially life-threatening accidental exposure (3–6). Yet 
because little evidence for cure exists, even OIT successes must continue vigilance with 
strict dietary restrictions and self-injectable epinephrine. Further, up to 20% cannot tolerate 
the treatment and there is substantial potential for relapse if treatment is interrupted (7). 
However, we previously showed that long-term treatment response was significantly 
associated with lower peanut-specific IgE (psIgE) levels at study entry. These subjects 
achieved “sustained unresponsiveness (SU)” to peanut after five years of treatment with goal 
maintenance doses of 4 gm/day, permitting them to stop OIT and safely introduce peanut-
containing foods into the diet (8). This result suggests that the strength of allergic 
sensitization at baseline may largely influence durable OIT treatment success.
While it is now known that the production of food-specific IgE frequently begins in infancy 
(9–11), T cell receptor affinity is weak (12) and GATA-3 expression unstable (9). IgE 
production is further driven by progressive intensification of Th2 cytokine expression over 
the first two years of life, and is strongly correlated with the clinical expression of allergic 
disease (13–15). In the approximately 80% of affected patients for whom peanut allergy 
persists as a lifelong disease, psIgE production has been shown to increase over the first five 
years of life (15, 16). Taken together, these data suggest that the allergic program requires 
time to fully differentiate, and in the food allergy context, does so in the absence of oral 
exposure. We postulated that targeting newly diagnosed young peanut-allergic children 
would provide the best opportunity to enhance the clinical effectiveness of OIT as an

 immunomodulatory and disease-modifying treatment by interrupting allergic priming prior 
to its full maturation. We termed this approach early intervention OIT (E-OIT).
To test whether E-OIT would safely enhance favorable long-term outcomes and explore an 
effective dose range, we designed a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial of low- and 
high-dose peanut E-OIT among recently diagnosed peanut-allergic children aged 9–36 
months and compared outcomes to a control group of untreated peanut-allergic patients. Our 
primary hypothesis was that ≥ 70% of participants receiving low-dose E-OIT would achieve 
SU to 5 grams of peanut protein during a double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenge 
(DBPCFC) performed four weeks after discontinuing OIT.
METHODS
Study Design
This single-center clinical trial was appropriately registered (17) and carried out in 
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the local ethics committee. 
Following written informed parental consent, eligible participants underwent a qualifying 
baseline open oral food challenge (OFC) to 4 grams of peanut protein (Supplemental 
Methods). Those who demonstrated clear objective evidence of an IgE-mediated allergic 
reaction were block-randomized 1:1 to receive low- (target maintenance dose, 300 mg/day 
peanut protein) or high-dose (3000 mg/day peanut protein) E-OIT. All randomized subjects 
represent the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. After an initial day escalation, all subjects in 
both groups up-dosed to a 3000 mg/day target maintenance dose in a double-blinded fashion 
before undergoing up to two exit DBPCFCs. Study product for the low-dose group consisted 
of 300 mg peanut flour plus 2700 mg of placebo filler. Further details about the 
investigational product and dosing schedule can be found in the Supplemental Methods 
section. All participants, site investigators, and study coordinators were blinded to treatment 
assignment. Efficacy, safety and immunological data were all analyzed in blinded fashion.
The primary endpoint was the proportion of ITT subjects achieving sustained 
unresponsiveness at four weeks (4-SU) after discontinuing E-OIT, defined as the ability to 
consume 5 grams of peanut protein without dose-limiting symptoms during an exit 
DBPCFC followed by one additional serving size feeding of peanut fed openly. As discussed 
further in Supplemental Methods, we pre-specified an analysis of a matched standard-care 
control group to compare the frequency of peanut consumption in the diet following OIT or 
standard care (i.e., allergen avoidance). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of 
subjects achieving desensitization, the frequency of treatment-related AEs in each group, 
and longitudinal immunologic changes.
Study Population
We recruited children aged 9–36 months inclusive who were peanut-allergic or peanut-
sensitized. Peanut-allergic children were enrolled within six months of a convincing first 
allergic reaction following oral exposure to a peanut-containing food, and had a psIgE of > 
0.35 kUA/L and/or a peanut skin prick test (SPT) wheal diameter of ≥ 3 mm above the 
negative control. Children were also eligible with no known history of peanut ingestion and

 psIgE of ≥ 5 kUA/L. Exclusion criteria included: life-threatening peanut anaphylaxis (e.g., 
involving hypoxia, hypotension, or neurological compromise); wheat/oat allergy; severe 
atopic dermatitis according to the clinical judgment of the investigator (e.g., requiring 
systemic therapy); asthma requiring more than medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids as per 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute asthma guidelines; and participation in an 
interventional food allergy study within one year.
Standard care control group
A control cohort (N=154), matched on inclusion and exclusion criteria, was retrospectively 
collected from a pediatric allergy clinic database at Johns Hopkins (Supplemental Methods). 
These children were treated consistent with standard of care NIAID clinical guidelines (18) 
and the routine practice patterns of the attending physician(s). For example, not all 
diagnoses were routinely confirmed with OFC when the history was suggestive, and open 
oral food challenges were offered according to the judgment of the attending physician when 
he/she deemed natural tolerance likely to have occurred. Key clinical and immunologic 
variables were extracted from case histories by research assistants and were verified by the 
same pediatric allergist (C.K.), who was unaware of the trial results. IgEs at Johns Hopkins 
were measured by ImmunoCAP™ (Thermo Fisher).
Food challenge assessments
OFC techniques are described further in Supplemental Methods. Endpoints were assessed 
with two 5 gram exit DBPCFCs, the first at the end of treatment to confirm desensitization. 
If successful, then OIT was stopped and the DBPCFC repeated after four weeks of peanut 
abstinence to test for 4-SU. The protocol allowed for endpoint assessment upon achievement 
of pre-specified benchmarks (at least 12 months in the maintenance phase; psIgE ≤ 15 
kUA/L; SPT ≤ 8 mm; and no severe peanut-related symptoms in the previous 6 months). All 
subjects not meeting these benchmarks were assessed for 4-SU once they completed a 36 
month maintenance phase.
Mechanistic studies
SPT, PsIgE, total IgE, and psIgG4 were performed as previously described (19, 20).
Analysis plan
We computed averages, variances, frequencies, proportions, and graphical displays for all 
variables and examined them to ensure parametric distributional assumptions were met. 
Nonparametric test statistics were used as appropriate. Baseline demographics and 
categorical peanut consumption outcomes were compared between E-OIT and controls using 
Fisher’s exact test. Analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6 for Mac (La Jolla, CA) 
or Stata/SE 13.1 (College Station, TX). To achieve approximate normality and variance 
stabilization for longitudinal immune analyses, psIgE and psIgG4 were log-transformed, 
while for SPT raw data were employed. Models were fit separately for each group in R 
(www.r-project.org) for each outcome with functions of time using generalized estimating 
equations (21). Linear and quadratic, and cubic models in time were considered, with the

 best fitting model selected for each group for each outcome selected using QIC. All 
hypothesis tests were two-sided, with p<0.05 considered significant.
RESULTS
Subject enrollment and disposition
Based on our pre-study power calculations (Supplemental Methods) to compare E-OIT 
against standard-care controls, we consented and enrolled 40 participants (31 clinically 
allergic and 9 sensitized/never exposed). Study progression is shown in Figure 1. Baseline 
demographics, and those of the control group, are shown in Table 1. The study population 
was predominantly Caucasian and atopic, with median age at enrollment of 28.5 months 
(Interquartile range (IQR) 22–35). The ITT population consisted of 37 participants who 
reacted during the entry OFC at a median (IQR) of 21 (21–171) cumulative mg of peanut 
protein (Figure E1). Three (8%) of the 37 subjects were withdrawn from the study for 
treatment-related adverse events. Two additional subjects withdrew for nonadherence, 
leaving 32 participants with evaluable outcomes with respect to the primary endpoint. Four 
of the five withdrawals were from the high-dose arm.
Sustained unresponsiveness was achieved at high rates with both low- and high-dose OIT 
in young peanut-allergic children
In the ITT analysis, 30/37 (81%) overall were desensitized at the end of treatment [low-dose, 
17/20 (85%); high-dose, 13/17 (76%)]. 29/37 (78%) achieved 4-SU [low-dose, 17/20 (85%); 
high-dose, 12/17 (71%) (p=0.43 by Fisher’s exact test; difference in proportions 0.14 [95% 
CI: −0.12, 0.40])]. (Figure 2A). In the per-protocol (PP) analysis, the rate of desensitization 
was 30/32 (94%), with 29/32 (91%) achieving 4-SU. [low-dose, 17/19 (89%); high-dose 
12/13 (92%)]
Peanut exposure, not avoidance, suppresses psIgE and permits dietary consumption
Among 154 matched standard-care controls from the pediatric allergy clinic at Johns 
Hopkins, the median (IQR) baseline psIgE was 21.9 kUA/L (6.9–73), compared to 14.4 
(3.3–51) in trial participants (p=0.12). However, over time, median (IQR) psIgE significantly 
declined in OIT subjects to 1.6 kUA/L (0.5–4.9), whereas in controls it significantly 
increased to 57.4 kUA/L (9–101) (Figure 2B). Based on standard-of-care treatment, 20 
(13%) control patients were deemed OFC-eligible over an average follow up of 3.6 years 
(95%CI 3.3–3.8). Consistent with generally accepted clinical indications for OFC in this 
situation (22, 23), the median psIgE at OFC in the control cohort was 3.02 kUA/L [range 
0.48–13.5]. 19/20 OFCs were completed, and 6/19 (32%) passed. The remaining 13 reacted 
at a cumulative eliciting dose of 1150 mg (range 250 – 5000), with three patients requiring 
epinephrine. No other control patients were noted to have developed spontaneous peanut 
tolerance. Therefore the known overall proportion of controls that successfully introduced 
peanut in the diet was 4%, compared to 78% in the OIT group (RR 19.42 [95%CI 8.7–43.7], 
Fisher’s exact p<0.001) (Figure 2C).
We performed a worst-case analysis of these outcomes based on well-established predictive 
values of peanut allergy. Nine of 37 (24%) of the randomized group began the study with

 peanut-specific IgE values < 5 kUA/L, one of who subsequently withdrew for nonadherence. 
In the control group, there were serial IgE values available for 147 subjects, of which 46 
(31%) had peanut-specific IgE < 15 kUA/L at the end of the follow up period. For the 
purposes of this secondary analysis, we assumed that all nine of the subjects with peanut-
specific IgE < 5 did not benefit from the intervention but would have outgrown it regardless 
(24), and were considered failures. We also assumed that all controls with psIgE ≥ 15 at the 
end of follow-up were allergic, while all those <15 were tolerant (25). In this scenario, the 
proportion of successes was still significantly higher (57%) in the OIT group than among 
controls (31%) (RR 1.8 [95%CI 1.3–2.6], p=0.007) (Figure 2D).
Treatment length and outcome are determined by baseline psIgE levels
The 8 ITT failures had significantly higher median baseline psIgEs and psIgE:total IgE 
ratios than the 29 successes (90.1 kUA/L (IQR 55.4–288.8) versus 9.3 kUA/L (2.3–32), 
p<0.001; and 0.39 (0.25–0.6) versus 0.16 (0.05–0.3); p=0.04, respectively) (Figure 3A). As a 
result of the conditional endpoint assessment strategy, the median (IQR) duration of 
treatment was 29.1 months (25.3–47.3), and there was a significant stepwise increase in 
treatment duration from lowest to highest tertile of baseline psIgE (Figure 3B).
Low- and high-dose peanut OIT both modulate allergic immune responses
As expected, the baseline SPT, psIgE, and psIgG4 data were not normally distributed and 
were analyzed with nonparametric test statistics. Overall medians (IQR) for baseline psIgE 
and SPT were 14.4 kUA/L (3.4–48.6) and 11.5 mm (8–16.5), respectively, and not different 
between treatment arms (Table 1). We analyzed changes in these immunological outcomes 
with longitudinal mixed models for each group with functions of time. These models 
demonstrated strong temporal trends in the decline of psIgE and SPT, and the amplification 
of psIgG4 production, all of which are statistically significant in their change from baseline 
(Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C). Notably, there were no significant differences in the rate of 
change between treatment arms.
E-OIT was overall safe and well tolerated
There were no treatment-related, protocol-defined severe adverse events, hospitalizations, or 
deaths. Overall, 95% of subjects were affected by AEs that were likely related to OIT, with 
an average per-dose rate of 0.8% (95%CI 0.3%-1.4%) overall (Supplementary Table E3). 
Reported treatment-related AEs occurred significantly more frequently during the build-up 
phase, compared to maintenance, and involved predominantly the GI tract and upper airway 
(Supplementary Figure E2). 85% of these AEs were mild, with 15% considered moderate 
and none severe. Two subjects withdrew with persistent GI-predominant adverse events. 
Withdrawing OIT resulted in prompt resolution of abdominal pain in the first. The other 
subject, who reported a history of “gastroesophageal reflux,” prior to starting OIT, 
underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy while on OIT due to persistent regurgitation and 
vomiting refractory to high-dose ranitidine. Mucosal furrowing and ~30 eosinophils per 
high-powered field were noted, which persisted at repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy three 
months later despite stopping OIT and resuming a peanut-free diet. Moderate-severity AEs 
were significantly more likely in the low-dose compared to high-dose group overall (p=0.04) 
and during the buildup phase (p=0.02) (Supplementary Table E3). Overall, 25% of events

 (47% of subjects) required treatment, with the vast majority being antihistamines only. No 
epinephrine was administered during a dose escalation visit, and once at home following a 
dose reaction (Supplementary Table E4).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to target peanut-allergic children under the age of three for OIT 
treatment and also the first to prospectively study two peanut OIT doses in a randomized, 
blinded fashion. We show here that overall 78% of subjects receiving E-OIT demonstrated 
SU to peanut four weeks after stopping E-OIT and reintroduced peanut into the diet, the 
highest rate reported to date, after a median of only 29 months of treatment. Compared to a 
matched standard-care control group practicing avoidance, subjects receiving E-OIT had 
significantly lower psIgE levels and were estimated to be 19 times more likely to consume 
peanut in the diet over approximately a three-year period. Importantly, 300 mg/day was as 
effective as 3000 mg/day at regulating the allergic immune response, and produced 4-SU 
among 85% of the intent-to-treat and 89% of the per-protocol population. Confirming our 
previous results (8), we observed that SU was clearly associated with low baseline psIgE 
levels and psIgE:total IgE ratio. Allowing those with low psIgE to qualify early for exit 
challenges appeared to facilitate rapid introduction of peanut back into the diet. Taken 
together, these findings support our hypothesis that early intervention effectively disrupts 
peanut allergy and enhances outcomes, perhaps due to the lower average psIgE levels 
typically seen in young children and/or the plasticity of a relatively immature immune 
response, which we are exploring in greater detail in ongoing experiments.
Safety data from young children treated with OIT are sparse. We observed a favorable safety 
profile with E-OIT, with a side effect profile similar to other studies (7). Virtually all 
subjects experienced AEs likely related to OIT, but generally AEs were mild and required 
antihistamines, if any treatment was required. None were graded as severe. Like many other 
studies (26), GI allergic side effects were common and their persistence led to two 
withdrawals, one of which had EoE that importantly did not improve on a peanut-free diet, 
suggesting that peanut was not the specific trigger. Given his medical history of self-reported 
“gastroesophageal reflux,” and failure to respond to peanut elimination, it is most likely that 
his EoE was preexisting. Importantly, there were no AEs that met SAE criteria, and only one 
participant required epinephrine for one systemic reaction at home.
Almost 80% of the randomized study population was able to successfully introduce peanut-
containing foods into the diet ad libitum four weeks after stopping treatment. This 
improvement has been termed sustained unresponsiveness (8, 27), and in part because we 
cannot be certain that these children have achieved permanent tolerance, we are continuing 
to follow them to better assess their long-term clinical outcomes. While we acknowledge 
that the lack of a placebo group in this first-in-preschoolers OIT study limits a precise 
estimate of the effect size, we believe that the high rates of success in dietary reintroduction 
are largely due to E-OIT. This conclusion is supported by the reduction in psIgE to very low 
levels that was sustained four weeks after stopping OIT, which has been previously 
associated with OIT success (8, 28). Though it is possible that spontaneous resolution may 
have occurred in the E-OIT group, several studies have shown that only a small minority of

 peanut-allergic children acquire natural tolerance (24, 29–31). Most recently, the HealthNuts 
study demonstrated, with high methodological rigor, a 22% rate of peanut allergy resolution 
by four years of age in an unselected population (24). The baseline characteristics of the 
active group, especially the low baseline OFC thresholds, as well as those of the controls in 
this study leave little reason to believe that we oversampled milder patients likely to 
spontaneously resolve (15, 24). We chose to use open challenges, rather than DBPCFCs, to 
confirm the diagnosis at baseline, and we required the presence of objective allergic signs in 
judging challenges to be positive. In other recent studies, including Learning Early About 
Peanut allergy (LEAP) and HealthNuts (2, 32), open OFCs were shown to be valid and 
sufficient for classifying food allergy in infants and young children (33). The prespecified 
primary efficacy outcome variable was based on the exit DBPCFC results only and did not 
include a comparison to the entry challenge.
Despite the similarities of the two participating food allergy centers and actively matching 
on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the control cohort was more ethnically diverse and was 
evaluated by standard-care criteria rather than required OFCs at the entry and exit of their 
observation period. Thus, during the period of observation 13% of the control patients were 
offered OFCs by their treating allergist based on clinical criteria suggesting the development 
of tolerance (21). Only one-third of those selected for challenge passed, suggesting that the 
treating physicians were aggressively evaluating for tolerance. While the selection of control 
patients for tolerance OFCs could introduce bias, our worst-case analysis showed a 
statistically significant effect favoring E-OIT even when we conservatively assumed that all 
patients with sIgE < 95% predictive values were tolerant. It should be noted that we 
understood in advance that we would be underpowered for a primary comparison of the two 
doses head-to-head. Given limited resources, we were unable to execute a study large 
enough to show what we assumed would be small between-group differences. Given how 
small the actually observed clinical and immunologic differences were in this study, this 
concern was justified. Our findings raise the possibility that the effective dose range in 
young children may be even lower than 300 mg.
Recently, the LEAP trial provided high-quality experimental evidence (32) supporting data 
obtained from other cohort studies (9, 11) that together construct a new paradigm concerning 
the early life origins of peanut allergy (34). In this paradigm, allergic sensitization to peanut 
begins in the first few months of life and progresses to production of psIgE and expression 
of clinical disease in a high proportion of high-risk infants. In the LEAP study, properly 
timed oral exposure appeared to interrupt this progression and prevent peanut allergy from 
developing in most of the selected population, which consisted of unexposed atopic infants 
with absent or minimal sensitization to peanut. However, children known to, or likely to, 
already have peanut allergy were deemed unlikely to benefit from primary or secondary 
prevention strategies, and were thus excluded from the LEAP study; and in a small 
proportion, the preventative intervention failed. The population of interest for treatment with 
E-OIT is this group of infants and toddlers whose sensitization to peanut has progressed to 
clinical disease. We show here that even after allergic hypersensitivity is apparent, 
immunological programming to peanut may still be effectively disrupted through oral 
exposure in the form of E-OIT.

 In summary, E-OIT was immunoregulatory and resulted in a very high rate of 4-SU at 1/13th 
of the maintenance dose previously used in older peanut-allergic children,(8) and in as little 
as half the time. This suggests that allergic responses may be more easily and durably 
corrected in young children, and that in this context relatively low OIT doses are sufficiently 
potent in suppressing IgE responses and stimulating IgG4 production. We are further 
exploring these concepts in ongoing mechanistic studies. Within an average of two and a 
half years, children receiving E-OIT were able to stop treatment and begin eating peanut-
containing foods at approximately 19-fold higher rates than similar peanut-allergic controls 
continuing to avoid peanut. If the promise of E-OIT is confirmed in other studies, one of 
which is ongoing with a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter design (35), we believe 
it has the potential to further transform the standard of care in the post-LEAP era. When 
initiated soon after the initial diagnosis, controlled oral peanut exposure through E-OIT may 
safely and effectively rescue many young children whose peanut allergy has already 
progressed to clinical disease expression.

 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Treating peanut-allergic preschool children with OIT is feasible and may enhance long-
term outcomes. In this study, relatively short, low-dose therapy achieved 
immunoregulation and a high rate of sustained unresponsiveness.

Outcomes of E-OIT and standard-care treatment. (A) Clinical outcomes of E-OIT. The 
proportion of overall subjects, and those in each treatment arm, achieving sustained 
unresponsiveness are shown for both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.(B) The 
distributions of peanut-specific IgE among E-OIT participants and matched controls 
practicing allergen avoidance at baseline and end-of study periods (median 29 and 43 
months, respectively). Note all peanut-specific IgE levels > 100 were transformed to 101 for 
these analyses because dilutional analysis was not available for all high-titer samples. (C) 
The proportions of E-OIT and control participants able to reintroduce peanut-containing 
foods in the diet at the end of study period. (D) The imputed proportions able to reintroduce 
peanut-containing foods in the diet with evidence-based worst-case assumptions.
