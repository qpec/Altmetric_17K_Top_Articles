Abstract
Molecular understanding of serological immunity to influenza has been confounded by the 
complexity of the polyclonal antibody response in humans. Here we used high-resolution 
proteomics analysis of immunoglobulin (referred to as Ig-seq) coupled with high-throughput 
sequencing of transcripts encoding B cell receptors (BCR-seq) to quantitatively determine the 
antibody repertoire at the individual clonotype level in the sera of young adults before and after 
vaccination with trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The serum repertoire comprised between 40 
and 147 clonotypes that were specific to each of the three monovalent components of the trivalent 
influenza vaccine, with boosted pre-existing clonotypes accounting for ~60% of the response. An 
unexpectedly high fraction of serum antibodies recognized both the H1 and H3 monovalent 
vaccines. Recombinant versions of these H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed broad binding 
to hemagglutinins (HAs) from previously circulating virus strains; several of these antibodies, 
which were prevalent in the serum of multiple donors, recognized the same conserved epitope in 
the HA head domain. Although the HA-head-specific H1 + H3 antibodies did not show 
neutralization activity in vitro, they protected mice against infection with the H1N1 and H3N2 
virus strains when administered before or after challenge. Collectively, our data reveal 
unanticipated insights regarding the serological response to influenza vaccination and raise 
questions about the added benefits of using a quadrivalent vaccine instead of a trivalent vaccine.
Influenza infections cause over 5 million cases of severe illness, resulting in approximately 
half a million deaths globally, every year and pose a threat of another pandemic1,2. The HA 
surface glycoprotein is the main antigenic determinant of the influenza virus, and 
neutralizing antibodies that bind to HA are known to confer protective immunity3,4. The 
seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) that is currently in use contains HA 
from two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B strain (either the 
Yamagata or Victoria lineage). However, it has been estimated that IIV3 confers protection 
in only about 60% of young adults, and efficacy can be substantially lower for at-risk groups 
such as infants and the elderly5,6. For this reason, improved vaccination strategies are 
needed.
Currently, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers, which measure the amounts of 
antibodies that inhibit viral infection through preventing HA binding to its target cell 
receptors, are used as the main metric of vaccine efficacy7,8. However, HAI assays only 
inform on antibodies that disrupt binding between the receptor-binding site (RBS) of HA 
and its receptor. Influenza can also be neutralized by other mechanisms, most notably by 
antibodies that bind to the conserved stem region of HA and interfere with fusion between

 the virus and the host endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus9–12. Stem-
binding, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are rarely elicited after seasonal 
vaccination13–15, although they have been detected at increased frequencies in individuals 
who were infected or vaccinated with divergent strains, such as H5N1 or the 2009 pandemic 
H1N1 strain12,16–19. In addition, it should be noted that in vitro neutralization activity does 
not always correlate with in vivo protection in mouse models11,20,21 that are widely used to 
evaluate antibody-mediated protection against challenge with live influenza virus22,23.
Over the past few years, cloning and characterization of antibodies from peripheral blood B 
cells has enhanced our understanding of antibody-mediated protection to 
influenza10,11,13,24–26. More recently, high-throughput sequencing of transcripts encoding 
heavy chain variable (VH) regions from B cells in peripheral blood has also provided new 
insights about features of the influenza vaccine response27–31. Nevertheless, it is antibodies 
circulating in serum, not immunoglobulin receptors on B cells, that directly mediate 
protection against viral infection. For that reason, bulk serological metrics, including ELISA 
and neutralization titers to viral strains, have also been used to understand the response to 
vaccination or infection. However, neither investigation of peripheral B cells nor bulk 
serological assays provide information regarding the sequence, relative concentrations, 
temporal dynamics and functions of the individual monoclonal antibodies that comprise the 
polyclonal anti-influenza serum repertoire. Here we study the serum antibody repertoire at a 
molecular level to determine the extent to which seasonal influenza vaccination either boosts 
levels of pre-existing serum antibodies or elicits new antibodies, the influenza-binding 
breadth, protection potencies and mechanisms of action of vaccine-boosted and vaccine-
elicited antibodies, how clonal diversity of the serum repertoire is affected by immunization 
and how it relates to the overall ELISA titer, and finally, the persistence of individual clones 
over time in the serum.
RESULTS
The serological repertoire to IIV3
We previously developed a proteomics-based pipeline for the identification and 
semiquantitative determination of the antigen-specific antibodies in human serum32–34. By 
using this method, we delineated the composition and relative quantities of the antibody 
clonotypes comprising the serum IgG repertoire before (pre-) and after (post-) vaccination 
(days 0, 28 and 180) in four human donors who were immunized with the 2011–2012 IIV3 
vaccine (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Briefly, serum IgG specific for each of the 
three vaccine strains was purified by three separate affinity chromatography columns, each 
using one of the monovalent inactivated vaccine components (IIV1) that comprise the IIV3 
(A/California/07/2009 X-179A, A/Victoria/210/2009 X-187 and B/Brisbane/60/2008; 
abbreviated as ‘H1 A/CA09’, ‘H3 A/VI09’ and ‘Vic B/BR08’, respectively). The influenza-
specific antibodies in the affinity chromatography elution fraction were trypsinized and 
analyzed by high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC–MS/MS). In total, analysis of the serological repertoire for all of the time points and 
donors required 240 runs and >1,200 h of LC–MS/MS time, with collection of >7,000,000 
mass spectra.

 Antibodies that share sequence similarity in the heavy chain complementarity-determining 
region 3 (CDR-H3) and have the same binding specificity belong to a particular clonotype 
and are likely to recognize the same epitope. For our analyses, we identified high-confidence 
CDR-H3 peptides and grouped the peptides belonging to the same clonotype together. The 
corresponding LC peak intensities were used for relative quantification of the antibody 
clonotypes35. An estimated >80% of the CDR-H3 peptides within a sample are typically 
identified in this manner (detection limit around 0.4 ng/ml), and quantification calibrations 
using isobaric peptide spike-ins showed that peak intensities correlate well with absolute 
peptide concentrations36. Accordingly, our proteomic methodology enabled us to quantify 
changes in the abundance of different antibody clonotypes among the serum repertoire of 
antibodies that bind to each IIV1.
For each time point, the antibody repertoire composition and relative quantities at the 
clonotypic level were plotted as a histogram, with each bar representing an individual 
clonotype and the y axis showing its relative abundance (Fig. 1b). We defined antibody 
clonotypes present in both the pre-vaccination repertoire (day 0) and the post-vaccination 
repertoire (day 28 and/or day 180) as ‘pre-existing’, and clonotypes observed exclusively in 
the post-vaccination repertoire (not at day 0) as ‘vaccine-elicited’. The term ‘vaccine-elicited 
antibodies’ refers only to the fact that these antibodies become detectable in the serum after 
vaccination and should not be interpreted in B cell ontogeny terms (i.e., whether they arise 
from stimulated naive or memory B cells). The temporal dynamics of the serum repertoire to 
each IIV1 at days 0, 28 and 180 are represented as heat maps, with color intensity reflecting 
relative amount of the respective clonotype (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). The 
comparison of pre-existing and vaccine-elicited antibodies revealed that in the four donors 
we analyzed, on average pre-existing antibody clonotypes comprised 61.2% and 65.4% of 
the HA-binding repertoire in day 28 and day 180 sera, respectively (Fig. 1d). Thus, the post-
vaccination response is dominated by pre-existing serum antibodies.
Inspection of the serological repertoires for all of the donors also revealed several additional 
insights. First, the number of distinct antibody clonotypes specific for each IIV1 ranged 
from as low as 6 at day 0 to between 40 and 147 at day 28 (Supplementary Table 2), 
revealing that the influenza-specific repertoire is highly restricted and oligoclonal. Second, 
the serological repertoire is highly polarized, and on average, the top 6% of the most 
abundant clonotypes after vaccination account for more than 60% of the entire repertoire 
(Supplementary Table 3). This polarization effect is also evident in the pre-vaccination 
serum IgG repertoires (top 12% antibody clonotypes constituting >60% of the repertoire). 
Third, the number of antibody clonotypes in the serum repertoire specific for a particular 
IIV1 correlates with the respective serum titer (Spearman correlation = 0.82, P < 0.0001; 
Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 4). Fourth, the frequency of vaccine-elicited antibody 
clonotypes shows an inverse correlation with the serum titer before vaccination (Spearman 
correlation = −0.82, P = 0.0010; Fig. 1f). In other words, individuals with a lower serum titer 
before vaccination, and therefore a repertoire comprising fewer antibody clonotypes, 
produce a greater number of vaccine-elicited antibody clonotypes. These data are consistent 
with a model (Supplementary Fig. 2) in which the greater the number of pre-existing 
clonotypes (reflected as a higher pre-vaccination serum titer), the greater the number of 
antigenic epitopes that are bound by circulating antibodies resulting in a blockade of

 antigenic sites (or possibly, more effective clearance owing to the formation of HA immune 
complexes decorated with a larger number of antibodies), thereby reducing the magnitude 
and diversification of the B cell response37,38.
Prevalence of cross-reactive serum antibodies
We noticed that a unexpectedly high number of the same antibody clonotypes were detected 
in both the H1 A/CA09 and H3 A/VI09 affinity chromatography eluates (Supplementary 
Data 1). We considered the possibility that these antibody clonotypes may have been 
isolated because they bound to constituents in the vaccine other than HA, or because of 
nonspecific binding. However, when we proteomically analyzed the affinity chromatography 
eluate from donor 1 day 28 serum using recombinant HA (rHA) of A/California/07/2009 
X-181, >70% (by abundance) of all of the antibody clonotypes found in the eluate from 
affinity chromatography with immobilized H1 A/CA09 (IIV1) were also detected in the 
eluate from affinity chromatography with the rHA (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Data 2). In addition, the abundance of the H3 A/VI09–specific antibody that 
was also detected in the anti–H1 A/CA09 serological repertoire, on the basis of the 
proteomic analysis, was in excellent agreement with biochemical estimates of the abundance 
of H3 A/VI09–binding antibodies found in the eluate from H1 A/CA09 affinity purification 
(see Supplementary Fig. 3d for data and experimental details). These data suggest that the 
antibodies found in the H1 A/CA09 and in the H3 A/VI09 affinity chromatography eluates 
overwhelmingly recognize both of the respective HAs and are not directed to other vaccine 
components, such as neuraminidase.
We designated the clonotypes detected in separate affinity chromatography eluates with H1 
A/CA09 and H3 A/VI09 as ‘H1 + H3 cross-reactive’ (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 3). 
Notably, several highly abundant clonotypes were H1 + H3 cross-reactive, which was 
unexpected because previous reports on the HA specificity of antibodies isolated by single B 
cell cloning from IIV3 vaccines recipients had suggested that clones capable of binding to 
both group 1 and group 2 strains are rare13,14. In the serum samples from the four donors we 
analyzed, the average fractions of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies among total IIV1-
binding repertoire were 43.9%, 32.7% and 39.0% on days 0, 28 and 180, respectively (Fig. 
2b). Also, across all donors, 63.1% of H1 + H3 cross-reactive clonotypes were pre-existing, 
and a higher amount of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies in serum at day 0 correlated with 
a lower frequency of newly elicited H1 + H3 cross-reactive clonotypes at day 28 (Spearman 
correlation = −0.86, P = 0.0107; Fig. 2c), in agreement with the model in Supplementary 
Figure 2. Comparison of the molecular features of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies with 
those of antibodies detected only in the anti–H1 A/CA09 or anti–H3 A/VI09 repertoires 
(assigned as ‘H1-specific’ and ‘H3-specific’, respectively) showed no significant differences 
in immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene usage, CDR-H3 length, 
hydrophobicity or charge, suggesting that there are no specific B cell evolutionary 
trajectories or germline features that predispose antibodies toward H1 + H3 cross-reactivity 
(Supplementary Fig. 4).

 Functional and structural characterization of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies
Because our methodology relies on the determination of the serum antibody repertoire at the 
CDR-H3 clonotypic level, there is a possibility that CDR-H3 peptides found in the affinity 
chromatography elution with both H1 A/CA09 and H3 A/VI09 might correspond to two 
distinct antibodies that have the same CDR-H3 but different somatic mutations, such that 
one antibody binds to H1 and the other to H3. To address this question, we recombinantly 
expressed seven H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies (including some of the most abundant 
ones) from donors 1 and 2 (Supplementary Table 5). We determined the full-length heavy 
and light chain (VL) sequences from the proteomics data and our paired VH:VL sequence 
database. For two very highly abundant antibody clonotypes for which the VL sequence was 
not found in the paired VH:VL database, cognate light chains were identified by screening 
antigen-binding fragment (Fab)-encoding libraries constructed using the proteomically 
identified VH combinatorially paired with VL-encoding cDNA from day 7 B cells. For both 
VH libraries, we isolated multiple VL sequences with very similar CDR-L3 sequences with 
the same immunoglobulin kappa light chain variable (IGKV) and junctional (IGKJ) genes, 
suggesting that screening had converged onto a light chain that is likely to be clonally 
related to the respective natively paired sequences. Seven of seven H1 + H3 cross-reactive 
antibodies we identified proteomically bound to both IIV1s. Furthermore, five of seven H1 + 
H3 cross-reactive antibodies had exceptional binding breadth toward a diverse panel of rHAs 
from influenza groups 1 and 2, with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values <100 nM, as 
assessed by ELISA (and apparent Kd values between 2.5 pM and 160 nM, on the basis of 
surface plasmon resonance analysis; Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 
6). One additional antibody isolated from donor 1 (D1 H3-11), which was originally 
identified only in the H3 A/VI09 eluate, also bound to rHAs from groups 1 and 2; however, 
because it bound to H1 A/CA09 (IIV1) with such low affinity, it was not detected in the H1 
A/CA09 eluate.
Two antibodies, D1 H1-6/H3-2 and D1 H1-9/H3-7, bound only to the H1 A/CA09 and H3 
A/VI09 monovalent vaccines, but not to the respective rHAs. Consistent with this finding, 
these two antibodies were detected in the proteomic analysis of the affinity chromatography 
eluate with H1 A/CA09 but not with rHA A/California/07/2009 X-181 (Supplementary Data 
2). These antibodies did not bind to neuraminidase, gelatin or other constituents of the 
monovalent vaccines. Notably, D1 H1-9/H3-7 neutralized group 1 and group 2 strains in 
pseudotyped particle-entry inhibition (PVN) assays with pandemic influenza A/California/
07/2009 (H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) strains, and it bound to HA on the surface of 
infected Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 6). 
We concluded that D1 H1-9/H3-7 recognizes an epitope that is present in the conformation 
that HA assumes on the surface of infected cells but is inaccessible in purified rHA.
Although none of the eight H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed HAI activity, four of 
eight antibodies showed neutralization activity in PVN assays (Fig. 3a, top panel). Two of 
these (D1 H1-1/H3-1 and D1 H3-11) competed with the stem-binding bNAb FI6 (ref. 10) 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a), and these stem-binding H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies were 
prevalent in the serum of donor 1 (D1 H1-1/H3-1 accounted for 14.2% and 14.9% of the H1 
A/CA09 and H3 A/VI09 repertoires at day 28, respectively). D1 H1-1/H3-1 in particular

 neutralized numerous influenza virus strains in PVN assays (Supplementary Table 7). 
However, both antibodies had very weak or no activity in the more physiologically relevant 
plaque reduction assays (Supplementary Table 8) and, notably, did not confer protection 
against infection with the H1N1 virus strain in lethal-challenge experiments in mice when 
administered at 5 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg) (Fig. 3c).
The remaining four of eight H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed no neutralization 
activity in HAI, PVN or plaque reduction assays (Fig. 3a, bottom and Supplementary Table 
8). Three of these (D1 H1-3/H3-3, D1 H1-17/H3-14 and D2 H1-1/H3-1), which were highly 
abundant in both donors, competed with each other for binding to HA (Supplementary Fig. 
7b), indicating that they target either the same or overlapping epitopes. Of note, 
administration of these three antibodies at 5 mg/kg, and even at lower doses (1.0 and 0.5 mg/
kg), conferred excellent protection in mice that were challenged with the H1N1 strain (Fig. 
3c and Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D1 H1-17/H3-14 also 
conferred 100% protection (although transient weight loss was observed) in challenge 
experiments with the H3N2 strain (Fig. 3d). Finally, treatment with D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D2 
H1-1/H3-1 both led to a reduction in viral titers in the lower lung, following H1N1 
challenge, and also conferred protection when administered therapeutically 24 and 48 h after 
infection with the H1N1 strain (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 9).
To identify the epitope targeted by the three non-neutralizing yet in vivo–protective 
antibodies (D1 H1-3/H3-3, D1 H1-17/H3-14 and D2 H1-1/H3-1), we used negative-staining 
electron microscopy (EM). We first tested the binding of these antibodies to multiple rHA 
proteins, as well as to smaller rHA domains, and although no binding was observed to a 
trimeric rHA stem molecule39, strong binding was observed to the rHA RBS40. The 
antibodies bound to the full-length rHA molecule (A/Hong Kong/1-4-MA21-1/1968) but not 
to a disulfide-bonded covalent trimer version of the rHA (A/Hong Kong/1-4-MA21-1/1968 
212Cys–216Cys)41 (Fig. 4a). When we mixed Fab fragments with the trimeric, full-length 
rHA molecules (A/Hong Kong/1-4-MA21-1/1968), we observed dissociation of the rHA 
trimer molecule with ~50% of the mixture, forming a 1:1 complex of one HA protomer with 
one Fab molecule as shown by negative-stain EM (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 10). To 
visualize the epitope on the HA protomer, a three-dimensional negative-stain EM map at 
~22-Å resolution was determined by using random conical tilt. A single HA protomer and 
an Fab molecule could be fit to the EM map (Fig. 4c,d), indicating that the antibody’s mode 
of binding was incompatible with an intact HA trimer molecule owing to steric clashes. 
Competition assays with the F005-126 antibody42 (Supplementary Fig. 11) and analysis of 
the Fab contact site on the HA molecule indicated that the antibodies (D1 H1-3/H3-3, D1 
H1-17/H3-14 and D2 H1-1/H3-1) bind to a highly conserved region of the rHA molecule 
located on the RBS that includes Asn171, Arg208, Pro239, Gly240 and Asp241, which is 
occluded in the intact HA trimer (Fig. 4e). These residues are highly conserved in the HA 
sequence database of more than 4,468 sequences from human-infecting strains, especially 
for H1 and H3 strains.

 H1- or H3-specific antibody repertoire analysis
Analysis of H1- or H3-specific antibodies revealed that vaccine-elicited antibody clonotypes 
(as opposed to pre-existing antibodies detected at day 0) in sera were overwhelmingly either 
H1-specific or H3-specific (Fig. 5a). The total amount of these H1- or H3-specific antibody 
clonotypes correlated with the HAI titer (Spearman correlation = 0.85, P < 0.0001; Fig. 5b 
and Supplementary Table 9). Because a large fraction of the serum repertoire comprises pre-
existing antibodies that bind to conserved epitopes in HA (Fig. 2b), the response to the 
vaccine seems to become focused on new epitopes in the head domain, the region of HA that 
experiences the highest degree of evolutionary drift.
As expected, recombinant antibodies identified exclusively in the eluate from H1 affinity 
chromatography bound only to H1 A/CA09 and not to the H3 strains, and vice versa 
(Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). All of the H1-specific 
antibodies competed for the same epitope as the RBS-targeting antibody C05 (ref. 43) 
(Supplementary Fig. 7c), and most of them showed activity in HAI assays, indicating that 
they target the RBS. One antibody, D1 H3-9, neutralized the A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) strain 
in PVN assays and also bound with high affinity to a number of recent historical group 2 
rHAs (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Anti–influenza B repertoire analysis
Influenza B is antigenically distinct from influenza A strains. Globally, quadrivalent 
inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4) that include both Yamagata and Victoria lineage HAs 
are gradually replacing the trivalent vaccine (IIV3), which contains one B lineage strain. 
Whether the IIV4 offers increased protection over IIV3 is actively debated44,45. We 
evaluated the degree to which antibodies comprising the influenza B serum repertoires 
elicited by IIV3 containing a Victoria lineage strain (‘Vic B/BR08’ in Fig. 1) also bound to a 
Yamagata lineage strain, specifically the influenza B component from the 2012–2013 IIV3 
(B/Texas/6/2011, abbreviated as ‘Yama B/TX11’). The fraction of antibody clonotypes 
detected in the eluate from Vic B/BR08 enrichment and also in the eluate with immobilized 
Yama B/TX11, designated as ‘Vic + Yama cross-reactive’, comprised 95.8%, 86.6% and 
83.9% of the anti-influenza B serum repertoires at days 0, 28 and 180, respectively (Fig. 5c). 
Five antibodies that were identified as Vic + Yama cross-reactive from donor 1, including 
one antibody that constituted ~40% of the anti-Vic B/BR08 repertoire, were recombinantly 
expressed, and their binding affinities to a panel of Victoria and Yamagata rHA proteins and 
their HAI titers to the vaccine strain were determined (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Tables 6 
and 10). Four of five antibodies bound with high affinity to all influenza B rHAs tested, 
whereas one antibody bound only to both Vic B/BR08 and Yama B/TX11 IIV1s but not to 
the respective rHAs. Our data show that most of the serum antibodies elicited by vaccination 
with Vic B/BR08 also bind to Yama B/TX11. This finding raises the question of whether 
vaccination with the new IIV4 can offer substantial additional protection benefit over that

 DISCUSSION
We used LC–MS/MS proteomic spectrotyping of antigen-specific antibodies (Ig-seq) in 
combination with high-throughput sequencing of B cell transcripts (BCR-seq), to 
characterize, in a quantitative fashion, the serological repertoire to each of the monovalent 
components of the IIV3 influenza vaccine and how the serological repertoire changes before 
and after immunization. Although we analyzed a relatively small cohort because of 
limitations imposed by the labor involved and the LC–MS/MS instrument time 
requirements, our data reveal a number of findings that could not have been inferred from 
classical serology assays (i.e., ELISA and HAI titers) or from peripheral B cell cloning or 
sequencing. This is because bulk serological analysis cannot provide information on the 
properties or the persistence of the constituent individual antibodies. Similarly, the 
peripheral B cell repertoire cannot be used to infer the serological antibody repertoire 
because: (i) the former is much more diverse than the latter; (ii) at steady-state, serological 
memory arises from antibodies produced by bone marrow plasma cells and not by peripheral 
B cells; (iii) blood samples capture a tiny fraction of the diversity of the peripheral B cell 
repertoire; and finally (iv) a clear negative correlation has been demonstrated between pre-
existing serum antibody levels and the breadth of the B cell response, which is further 
correlated with age (or immune history)28, an ‘immunologic paradox’ recognized a half-
century ago46.
It has been known for many years that influenza-specific antibody response after vaccination 
is shaped by pre-exposure history29,37,38,47. However, what could not be evaluated from bulk 
serological studies is the relative contribution of pre-existing circulating antibodies that are 
boosted by vaccination relative to that of the new, vaccine-elicited antibodies. We now show 
that a substantial portion (on average ~60% across all IIV1 repertories in our cohorts as 
shown in Fig. 1) of the serum response to influenza is due to the boosting effect of pre-
existing antibody clonotypes. The fraction of the serum response that arises from the 
boosting of pre-existing antibodies and, conversely, the clonotypic diversity of ‘new’, or 
vaccine-elicited, antibodies are strongly correlated with the serum titer before vaccination. In 
other words, high serum titer before vaccination results in a more dominant boost effect of 
pre-existing antibodies and the emergence of fewer vaccine-elicited antibodies, and vice 
versa.
The boosting of pre-existing antibodies is not necessarily detrimental for protection. For 
example, we showed that monomeric HA-head-specific H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies 
that conferred protection to challenge with influenza virus strains in the murine model were 
primarily pre-existing and were boosted significantly by vaccination (Fig. 3). However, 
given that the residues around the RBS are subject to intense evolutionary pressure, pre-
existing antibodies are less likely to contribute to the increase in the HAI titer for a divergent 
strain. Instead, we show that the HAI titer increase after vaccination correlates with the 
fraction of newly elicited antibodies that is predominantly specific for one IIV1 component 
(Fig. 5), in contrast to the pre-existing, cross-reactive antibodies that bind both H1 and H3 
(Fig. 2b).

 In the analysis of the serological repertoire to the groups 1 and 2 monovalent vaccine strains 
in IIV3, we found an unexpectedly high prevalence of antibody clonotypes that were 
detected in both of the respective affinity chromatography eluates. Recombinant expression 
of a set of such antibodies confirmed that they do indeed bind to both group 1 and group 2 
HA proteins and, furthermore, that most of these show a remarkable breadth of binding, 
recognizing not only historical H1 and H3 strains but also binding to H2, H5, H7 and H9. 
The unexpectedly large fraction of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies that was detected by 
LC–MS/MS could not have been inferred by classical serology metrics. Similarly, a high 
frequency of H1 + H3 antibodies had not been noted in previous analyses of peripheral B 
cells. There are several possible explanations for this. Single-cell cloning typically involves 
the analysis of small samples of peripheral B cells, and therefore, plasmablasts or memory B 
cells that bind to H1 + H3 could have been missed. Additionally, the emphasis of B cell 
analysis studies has been on neutralization, which means that H1 + H3 cross-reactive 
antibodies that show little or no potency in neutralization assays could have been 
overlooked. An additional reason may be the kinetics of expansion of the memory B cells 
encoding these antibodies.
We distinguished two classes of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies on the basis of their 
epitope specificity. One class recognized H2, H5, H7 and H9 with good to moderate affinity 
(in addition to H1 and H3), and these antibodies were found to compete with the stem-
binding bNAb FI6. Because these antibodies are present at high levels at day 0 and bind to 
epitope(s) that overlap those recognized by antibodies such as FI6, their existence could be 
interfering with the recognition of the critical protective epitopes in the stem and the 
elicitation of high-potency broadly protective antibodies. The second class of H1 + H3 
cross-reactive antibodies, identified in multiple donors, were all shown to bind to a highly 
conserved epitope on monomeric HA and to confer prophylactic and therapeutic protection 
against challenge by both group 1 and group 2 strains despite their complete lack of 
neutralization activity in vitro. Such antibodies have not been previously described. Given 
that they bind to the HA molecules on the surface of infected cells (Fig. 3b) but lack any 
detectable in vitro neutralization activity, the ability of these antibodies to confer protection 
in vivo is probably dependent on effector functions mediated by the crystallizable fragment 
(Fc) portion, namely complement activation and/or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
and phagocytosis20,48. Studies to determine the precise mechanism for protection are under 
investigation.
Finally, a very large fraction of the serum antibody repertoire elicited by immunization with 
a Victoria strain reacts with the following year’s Yamagata strain. The data underscore the 
need for further serological and epidemiological studies to define the efficacy benefit that 
might be expected as the current IIV3 is being replaced with IIV4.
A key to the universal influenza vaccine will be the design of immunogens that can elicit 
broadly protective antibodies that bind to a variety of different strains and subtypes and also 
provide long-term protection. Our data on the existence of broadly protective, non-
neutralizing antibodies, which are present in relatively high amounts in serum, raise 
interesting questions in terms of their role in the prevention of influenza infections and 
whether it might be desirable to design universal influenza immunogens that stimulate the

 production or boosting of this class of antibodies, perhaps in addition to the elicitation of 
neutralizing antibodies.

references, are available in the online version of the paper.
ONLINE METHODS
Study volunteers, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation and RNA extraction
All study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Stanford 
University. Informed consent was obtained from the participants. Blood was taken before 
(day 0) and after (days 7, 28 and 180) vaccination. Volunteers were four young adults (ages 
22–32 years) in generally good health who were vaccinated with one dose of IIV3 (FluZone; 
Sanofi-Pasteur); 60 ml peripheral blood was taken from the individuals, to which heparin 
was added. PBMCs were extracted from 10 ml blood using a Ficoll gradient and frozen in 
10% (vol/vol) DMSO/40% (vol/vol) FBS according to the protocols of the Stanford Human 
Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC). After thawing, total RNA was extracted from 5 million 
PBMCs using the Qiagen AllPrep Kit.
Library preparation for high-throughput sequencing of VH-encoding genes
500 ng of total RNA was used as input for library preparation. Reverse-transcription was 
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using SuperScript III Enzyme (Life 
Technologies) and primers for all five isotypes containing eight random nucleotides and 
partial Illumina adapters containing Illumina barcodes. Second-strand synthesis was done 
using Phusion Polymerase (NEB), and primers containing eight random nucleotides and 
partial Illumina adaptor sequences that bind either framework region (FR) 1 or 3 of all 
variable (V) segments with a maximum of one mismatch (98 °C for 2 min, 52 °C for 2 min, 
and 72 °C for 10 min). Double-stranded cDNA was purified two times using Ampure XP 
beads at a ratio of 1:1. Double-stranded cDNA was amplified with Platinum Hifi Polymerase 
(Life Technologies) with two primers completing Illumina adaptor sequences (amplification 
conditions: 95 °C for 2 min; 27 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min; 
and 68 °C for 7 min). Final sequencing libraries were generated by purifying the PCR 
product using Ampure XP beads at a ratio of 1:1, and they were sequenced using the 
Illumina MiSeq platform.
VH:VL-paired sequencing
Paired heavy and light chain sequencing of single B cells from donor 1 day 7 and donor 2 
day 7 samples was carried out as previously described34,49. Briefly, B cells were isolated as 
single cells inside emulsion droplets using a custom flow-focusing apparatus. Droplets 
contained lysis buffer and poly(dT)-conjugated magnetic beads, as well as lysis buffer to 
capture mRNAs generated by genes encoding heavy and light chain molecules. Magnetic 
beads were collected and emulsified to serve as template for emulsion overlap extension 
RT–PCR. A follow-up nested PCR generated 850-bp linked VH:VL amplicons that were

for full-length VH and VL analysis for the recombinant expression of monoclonal antibodies 
using the Illumina MiSeq platform as previously described32,49.

Purification of total IgG from serum and subsequent digestion into F(ab′)2
For each serum sample analyzed in this study, 30 ml of diluted serum (1:2 dilution in PBS) 
was passed through a 4-ml Protein G Plus agarose (Pierce) affinity column in gravity mode. 
Serum flowthrough was collected and passed through the column three times. The column 
was washed with 15 column volumes (cv) of PBS before elution with 5 cv of 100 mM 
glycine-HCl, pH 2.7. The eluate, containing total IgG from serum, was immediately 
neutralized with 2 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed into 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 
4.5, overnight at 4 °C. Purified IgG was digested into F(ab′)2 with 1 ml of immobilized 
pepsin resin (Pierce) per 40 mg of IgG in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, for 4 h on an 
inverter at 37 °C. Pepsin resin was spun down at 2,000g to halt digestion and washed with

 PBS three times. Supernatants from the digestion reactions and washes were combined and 
pH-adjusted to 7.
Antigen-enrichment of F(ab′)2 and mass spectrometry sample preparation
The respective IIV1s or rHA were immobilized on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated 
agarose resins (Pierce) by overnight rotation at 4 °C. The coupled agarose resins were 
washed with PBS, and unreacted NHS groups were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.3, 
for 30 min at room temperature (RT). The beads were further washed with PBS and packed 
into a 2-ml chromatography column (Clontech). The column was prewashed with 5 cv of 2 
M urea and equilibrated with 10 cv of PBS. The prewashing step with urea was to remove 
HA that was noncovalently bound to the resin following immobilization, because we 
initially noticed that a large amount of HAs detaching from the resins interfered with the 
subsequent analysis. Exhaustive controls with elution and flowthrough samples from affinity 
chromatography were performed to ensure that the prewashing step with 2 M urea does not 
impede complete capture of F(ab′)2 molecules that recognize IIV1.
For each sample, the F(ab′)2 sample was divided into equal volumes, with each fraction 
being applied to the individual antigen affinity columns in gravity mode. Flowthrough was 
collected and reapplied to the column three times, and the column was washed with 10 cv of 
PBS and 10 cv of diluted PBS (1:2 in ddH2O). Antigen-enriched F(ab′)2 was eluted with 60 
mM HCl, pH 1.7, in 0.5-ml fractions and neutralized with NaOH/Tris. Flowthrough and 
elution fractions were assayed by indirect ELISA with the corresponding IIV1. To ensure 
that our enrichment steps were not biasing isolation for high-affinity antibodies, the 
depletion of ELISA signal in each flowthrough sample was checked. Elution fractions 
showing an ELISA signal were pooled and concentrated under vacuum to a volume of ~0.1 
ml and desalted into ddH2O using a 0.5-ml Zeba spin column (Pierce). The desalted eluate 
was further concentrated to 50 μl under vacuum.
For each enrichment, elution and flowthrough samples were denatured in 50% (vol/vol) 
2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10 mM dithiothreitol 
(DTT) at 60 °C for 1 h, then alkylated by incubation with 32 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 
1 h at RT in the dark. Alkylation was quenched by the addition of 20 mM DTT. Samples 
were diluted tenfold with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested with trypsin (1:30 
trypsin:protein) for 16 h at 37 °C. Formic acid was added to 1% (vol/vol) to quench the 
digestion, and the sample volume was reduced to ~100 μl under vacuum. Peptides were then 
bound to a C18 Hypersep SpinTip (Thermo Scientific), washed three times with 0.1% 
formic acid and eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. C18 eluate was dried under 
vacuum-centrifugation and resuspended in 50 μl in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.
LC–MS/MS analysis
Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry on a Dionex 
Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano uHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap 
Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were first loaded onto an 
Acclaim PepMap RSLC NanoTrap column (Dionex; Thermo Scientific) before separation 
on a 75-μm × 15-cm Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column (Dionex; Thermo Scientific)

 using a 5–40% (vol/vol) acetonitrile gradient over 250 min at 300 nl/min. Eluting peptides 
were injected directly into the mass spectrometer using a nano-electrospray source. The LTQ 
Orbitrap Velos Pro was operated in data-dependent mode with parent ion scans (MS1) 
collected at 60,000 resolutions. Mono-isotopic precursor selection and charge-state 
screening were enabled. Ions with a charge ≥+2 were selected for collision-induced 
dissociation fragmentation spectrum acquisition (MS2) in the ion trap, with a maximum of 
20 MS2 scans per MS1. Dynamic exclusion was active with a 45-s exclusion time for ions 
selected more than twice in a 30-s window. Each sample was run three times to generate 
technical replicate data sets.
MS/MS data analysis
Donor-specific protein sequence databases were constructed using the donor’s VH sequences 
with ≥2 reads, concatenated to a database of background proteins comprising non-donor-
derived VL sequences (HD1)32, a consensus human protein database (Ensembl 73, longest 
sequence per gene) and a list of common protein contaminants (MaxQuant). Donor-specific 
spectra were searched against the corresponding donor-specific database using SEQUEST 
(Proteome Discoverer 1.4; Thermo Scientific). Searches considered fully tryptic peptides 
only, allowing up to two missed cleavages. A precursor mass tolerance of 5 p.p.m. and a 
fragment-mass tolerance of 0.5 Da were used. Modifications of carbamidomethyl cysteine 
(static) and oxidized methionine (dynamic) were selected. High-confidence peptide-
spectrum matches (PSMs) were filtered at a false discovery rate of <1% as calculated by 
Percolator (q-value < 0.01, Proteome Discoverer 1.4; Thermo Scientific).
Isoleucine/leucine sequence variants were collapsed into single peptide groups. For each 
scan, PSMs were ranked first by posterior error probability (PEP), then q-value, and finally 
XCorr. Only unambiguous top-ranked PSMs were kept; scans with multiple top-ranked 
PSMs (equivalent PEP, q-value and XCorr) were designated ambiguous identifications and 
removed. Observed precursor masses were recalibrated according to the previous method50, 
and the average mass deviation (AMD) for each peptide was calculated as described35 using 
data from elutions only. Peptides with an AMD > 1.5 p.p.m. were removed. Additionally, 
only peptides identified in ≥2 replicate injections for at least one elution sample were kept as 
high-confidence identifications.
Peptide abundance was calculated from the extracted-ion chromatogram (XIC) peak area, as 
described32, using peak area values generated by the Precursor Ions Area Detector node in 
Proteome Discoverer. For each peptide, a total XIC area was calculated as the sum of all 
unique XIC areas of associated precursor ions, and the average XIC area across replicate 
injections was calculated for each sample. For each antigen data set, the eluate and 
flowthrough abundances were compared and peptides with ≥10-fold higher signal in the 
elution sample were considered to be antigen specific. Similarly, peptide abundances in 
elution samples were compared across antigens; peptides with ≥10-fold higher signal for a 
single antigen were considered specific (i.e., H1 or H3 specific), and peptides with <10-fold 
difference for two or more antigens were considered cross-reactive (i.e., H1 + H3 cross-
reactive). In addition, in our H1 + H3 cross-reactive serological repertoire analysis, to avoid 
overestimating, we removed peptides that appeared in the eluates of all three IIV1

 enrichments (which could potentially be binding to other constituents in the vaccine); on 
average, they accounted for <10% (by abundance) of the serological repertoire. The 
resulting data sets are tabulated in Supplementary Data 3.
Clonotype indexing and peptide-to-clonotype mapping
VH-encoding sequences were grouped into clonotypes on the basis of single-linkage 
hierarchical clustering as described32. Cluster membership required ≥90% identity across 
the CDR-H3 amino sequence as measured by edit distance. High-confidence peptides 
identified by MS/MS analysis were mapped to clonotype clusters, and peptides uniquely 
mapping to a single clonotype were considered ‘informative’. The abundance of each 
antibody clonotype was calculated by summing the XIC areas of the informative peptides 
mapping to ≥4 amino acids of the CDR-H3 region.
Quantitating abundances of individual antibody clonotypes
For each serological repertoire, the relative abundance of a clonotype was calculated by 
dividing the XIC area for a particular clonotype by the sum of the XIC areas for all 
clonotypes. Fraction of serological repertoire refers to this relative abundance based on XIC. 
The amount for a particular clonotype was determined by multiplying its fraction of 
serological repertoire by the corresponding serum sample’s binding titer. To generate heat 
maps, we accounted for the different total binding titers toward each IIV1 by normalizing 
amount using the day 28 titer as a reference, calling this ‘relative amount’. For example, the 
amount for each clonotype divided by the serum titer of the day 28 sample refers to relative 
amount.
Recombinant antibody synthesis, expression and purification
Selection of antibody sequences for recombinant expression was based on the combination 
of VH:VL-paired databases and proteomics data. First, we identified antibody clonotypes 
identified in the proteomics analysis and searched for the same clonotype in the VH:VL-
paired database. Full-length heavy- and light-chain-encoding sequences were then 
determined from the paired sequencing database.
For two of the recombinantly expressed antibodies (D1 H1-1/H3-1 and D1 H1-6/H3-2), their 
sequences were not found in the VH:VL paired database; thus their corresponding light 
chains were screened in phage as previously described32. Briefly, λ and Λ light chain 
libraries were constructed for each heavy chain by amplifying VL sequences from cDNA of 
day 7 PBMCs. Individual clones from the libraries were screened on Costar 96-well ELISA 
plates (Corning) coated with IIV1s, and wells with signals were sequenced to identify the 
light chain sequences. From each screening, multiple light chains were identified; they 
shared the same IGKV and IGKJ genes, and had homologous CDR-L3 sequences, indicating 
that they are likely similar to the endogenously paired VL.
These genes were purchased as gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into the 
pcDNA3.4 vector (Invitrogen). Heavy- and light-chain-encoding plasmids for each 
monoclonal antibody were transfected into Expi293 cells (Invitrogen) at a 1:3 ratio. After 
incubating for 5 d at 37 °C with 8% CO2, the supernatant containing the secreted antibodies

 was collected by centrifugation at 500g for 15 min at RT. The supernatant was passed over a 
column with 0.5 ml Protein A agarose resin (Thermo Scientific) three times to ensure 
efficient capture. After washing the column with 20 cv of PBS, antibodies were eluted with 
3 ml 100 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with 1 ml 1 M Tris-HCl, 
pH 8.0. Antibodies were buffer-exchanged into PBS using Amicon Ultra-30 centrifugal spin 
columns (Millipore).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
EC50 values based on ELISA were used to determine the binding titers of IIV1-specific 
antibodies in the serum samples or apparent affinities of the recombinant monoclonal 
antibodies. First, costar 96-well ELISA plates (Corning) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 
4 μg/ml IIV1 or recombinant HAs, and washed and blocked with 2% milk in PBS for 2 h at 
RT. After blocking, serially diluted recombinant antibodies or serum samples were bound to 
the plates for 1 h, followed by incubation with 1:5,000-diluted goat anti-human-IgG Fc 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 
109-035-008) for 1 h. For detection, 50 μl TMB-ultra substrate (Thermo Scientific) was 
added before quenching with 50 μl 1 M H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using 
a Tecan M200 plate reader. Data were analyzed and fitted for EC50 using a four-parameter 
logistic nonlinear regression model in the GraphPad Prism software. All ELISA assays were 
performed in triplicate.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
To determine the affinities of the influenza-specific recombinant antibodies toward the 
rHAs, a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) was used. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
was immobilized in the reference channels of the CM5 sensor chip to subtract the buffer 
effect and nonspecific binding signal, and the rHAs were immobilized in separate channels 
by amine-coupling at pH 5.5. All SPR measurements were performed in HBS-EP running 
buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% vol/vol surfactant P20; 
GE Healthcare). The serially diluted antibodies (400–12.5 nM) were injected in triplicates at 
30 μl/min for 2 min and allowed a dissociation time of 10 min. The chip was regenerated 
after each binding event with 10 mM NaOH or 50 mM Tris, pH 11, with a contact time of 1 
min. The resulting sensorgrams were fit with a bivalent model using Biaevaluation 3.0 
software, and the kinetic parameters were reported as the average of the three technical 
replicates.
To compare the binding epitopes of monoclonal antibodies, the antibodies in sodium acetate, 
pH 5.0 were immobilized on the CM5 sensor chips surface to a surface density of ~1,000 
response units (RUs) by amine coupling. rHA at 100 μg/ml in HBS-EP were flowed over the 
immobilized-antibody surface at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 2 min and, without the 
dissociation phase, each monoclonal antibody (at 100 μg/ml in HBS-EP) tested was 
immediately injected over the surface at 30 μl/min for 2 min. Between cycles, the flow cells 
were regenerated with 10 mM NaOH with a contact time of 1 min.

 Binding studies using biolayer interferometry
A fortéBio Octet Red384 instrument was used to measure binding of H1 + H3 CR antibodies 
(D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D1 H1-17/H3-14) to influenza HA (full-length, RBD domain constructs, 
stem-only constructs). All of the assays were performed with agitation set to 1,000 r.p.m. in 
PBS buffer supplemented with 1% BSA to minimize nonspecific interactions. The final 
volume for all the solutions was 100 μl/well. Assays were performed at 30 °C in solid black 
96-well plates (Geiger Bio-One). HA molecules (35 μg/ml) in PBS buffer was used to load 
anti-penta His probes for 300 s. Typical capture levels were ~1 nm, and variability within a 
row of eight tips did not exceed 0.1 nm. Antibody binding was allowed to proceed for 300 s 
and normalized to a control antibody (5J8 for RBD, 39.29 for HA stem and full-length HA). 
Measurements were carried out in triplicate.
Antibody competition assays were carried out by first loading the HA molecule onto the 
probe for 300 s, followed by binding the competing antibodies (39.29, 5J8 or F005-126) for 
300 s. These loaded HA–IgG complexes were then allowed to bind to H1 + H3 CR 
antibodies (D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D1 H1-17/H3-14) for 300 s. Competition was determined by 
comparison of H1 + H3 CR antibody binding to uncomplexed HA molecules. Data analysis 
was carried out using Octet software, version 8.0.
Production of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and measurement of neutralizing activity of 
monoclonal antibodies
Influenza pseudotyped lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced 
as described51. Briefly, the following plasmids: 17.5 μg of pCMVΔR8.2, 17.5 μg of pHTR
′CMV-Luc, 60 ng of pCMV Sport/h TMPRSS2, 1 μg CMV/R-HA and 0.125 μg of 
corresponding CMV/R-NA of a given strain of influenza virus, were transiently 
cotransfected into 293T cells by use of Fugene 6 (Promega). Cells were transfected 
overnight and replenished with fresh medium. 48 h later, supernatants were harvested, 
filtered through a 0.45-μm PES membrane filter, aliquoted, and frozen at −80 °C.
For neutralization assays, recombinantly expressed monoclonal antibodies at various 
dilutions were mixed with 50 μl of pseudoviruses and then added to 293A cells in 96-well 
plates (10,000 cells per well). 48 h later, cells were lysed in cell culture lysis buffer 
(Promega, Madison, WI) before mixing with luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Light 
intensity was quantified with a Perkin Elmer microplate reader, and antibody neutralization 
resulted in lower light intensity.
Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay
The HAI assay was used to assess the abilities of functional antibodies specific for HA to 
inhibit agglutination of turkey erythrocytes. The protocol was adapted from the CDC 
laboratory-based influenza surveillance manual52. To inactivate nonspecific inhibitors, sera 
were treated with Receptor Destroying Enzyme (RDE; Denka Seiken, Co., Japan) prior to 
being tested53. Briefly, three parts RDE was added to one part serum and incubated 
overnight at 37 °C. RDE was inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for ~30 min. RDE-treated 
sera, or recombinantly expressed monoclonal antibodies, were two-fold serially diluted in v-
bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume of each influenza virus strain (A/California/

 07/2009, A/Perth/16/2009 or B/Brisbane/60/2008), adjusted to approximately 8 HAU per 50 
μl, was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature (RT) 
for 20 min followed by the addition of 1% turkey erythrocytes (RBC; Lampire Biologicals, 
Pipersville, PA, USA) in PBS. Red blood cells were stored at 4 °C and used within 72 h of 
preparation. The plates were mixed by agitation, covered and the RBCs were allowed to 
settle for 1 h at RT. The HAI titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last well 
that contained nonagglutinated RBC. Positive and negative serum controls were included for 
each plate.
Plaque-reduction assay
Monolayers of MDCK cells in 6-well plates were infected with 100 plaque-forming units 
(p.f.u.) of influenza virus in 100 μl of Dulbecoo’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) in 
presence or absence of the tested monoclonal antibodies and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The 
inoculum was removed from the cells, and the cells were washed with PBS buffer. DMEM 
supplemented with 1% agar and 1 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin was added to each well. After 48 h 
of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, the agar plugs were 
removed and the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet to estimate the titer of virus in 
the presence or absence of the neutralizing antibodies. Concentration of tested antibodies 
with 50% of viral titer reduction is considered as IC50 (μg/ml), performed in three 
independent experiments.
Testing of binding of H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies to infected cells using flow 
cytometry
MDCK cells plated in 6-well plate format (approximately 9 × 105 cells/well) were infected 
with pandemic H1N1 strain A/Netherlands/602/09 (NL09) at a multiplicity of infection 
(MOI) of 1. They were incubated for 17 h at 37 °C before being trypsinized and fixed with 
70% ethanol. Tested monoclonal antibodies were added at 5 μg/ml, incubated for 1 h and 
detected with 1:1,000 diluted Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-human-IgG (Life 
Technologies; A11013) using flow cytometry.
IgG passive transfer and therapeutic protection to influenza virus challenge in mouse 
model
For passive transfer experiments, mice were randomized into groups of five, and animal 
groups were not blinded to the investigators. Sample size was based on previous experience 
with similar experimental set-ups for antibody passive transfer influenza virus challenge 
experiments that used the same virus strains and challenge doses. Female 6- to 8-week-old 
BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) were intraperitoneally injected with monoclonal antibodies 
diluted in PBS. Two hours after transfer mice were anesthetized with a ketamin/xylazine 
mixture (0.15 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg) and intranasally infected with ten murine lethal doses 
of the respective challenge virus in 50 μl of PBS. Weight loss and survival were monitored 
over a period of 14 d, and animals that crossed the humane end point of 75% of the initial 
body weight were euthanized. Initially, monoclonal antibodies D1 H1-1/H3-1, D1 H1-9/
H3-7, D1 H1-3/H3-3, D1 H1-17/H3-14 and D2 H1-1/H3-1 were tested at 5 mg/kg for 
protection against the pandemic H1N1 strain A/Netherlands/602/09 (NL09). D1 H1-3/H3-3, 
D1 H1-17/H3-14 and D2 H1-1/H3-1 were also tested at lower doses (1 mg/kg and 0.5

 mg/kg) against NL09. The protective breadth of these three mAbs was tested at 5 mg/kg 
against H3N2 strain X-31 (HA and NA from A/Hong Kong/1/68 and backbone of A/PR/
8/34). The lung viral titers of mice (n = 3 per group) that were prophylactically treated with 
D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D1 H1-17/H3-14 2 h before an infection with NL09 were analyzed. 
Lungs were harvested on day 3 and day 6 after infection, homogenized and used for plaque 
assays.
In therapeutic-setting protection experiments, female 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice (n = 10 
per group) were challenged first with NL09 and then received D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D1 H1-17/
H3-14 monoclonal antibodies diluted in PBS, 24 and 48 h post infection (h.p.i.) at 5 mg/kg.
In all cases, irrelevant human IgG1 was used as negative control and bNAb CR9114 served 
as positive control. All animal experiments complied with the guidelines and protocols 
approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee.
Electron microscopy and single-particle analysis
For the initial analysis and screening of HA–Fab mixtures, protein samples diluted to 
approximately 0.05 mg/ml were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids, 
washed with several drops of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and 150 mM NaCl 
and negatively stained with 0.75% uranyl formate, pH 5.0. Micrographs were recorded at a 
magnification of 100,000× on a FEI Tecnai T20 microscope operated at 200 kV and 
equipped with a 2 k × 2 k Eagle CCD camera. The pixel size was 2.22 Å/pixel. SerialEM54 
was used for data collection. Particles were picked using EMAN2.1 (ref. 55) automatically 
or manually. Particle alignment and reference-free classification were carried out in EMAN2 
and SPIDER56.
The initial analysis revealed that a subset of HA–Fab combinations contained highly 
heterogeneous mixtures of aggregates, free HA trimers and Fab fragments, partially 
unfolded HA trimers and dimers with varying numbers of Fab fragments bound, HA dimers 
and monomers, and, as a major component, the complex between a monomer of HA and a 
single Fab fragment (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Analysis of a dataset containing 
approximately 12,000 particles revealed that the latter complex was represented by about 
50% of all particles and had a strong preferential orientation, with well-defined Fab 
fragments and head moieties of the HA and less well-defined membrane proximal regions 
(‘tails’). The random conical tilt (RCT) approach57 was utilized to obtain the three-
dimensional map of the complex. Grids were prepared as described above, except that the 
sample was supplemented with tobacco mosaic virus to simplify alignment of untilted and 
tilted micrographs. To accelerate data collection, 5 × 5 to 7 × 7 montages of untilted and 
45°-tilted images from same areas of the grid were obtained using SerialEM. All further 
analyses were performed with SPIDER. Montages were aligned automatically, and pairs of 
untilted and tilted images were formed using a custom written script. 4,843 pairs of particles 
consistent in size with the HA monomer/single Fab complex were picked and centered 
manually with JWeb56. Reference-free classification of the particles from untilted 
micrographs windowed into 128 × 128 boxes into 20 classes revealed that at least 3,351 of 
them (nine classes) represented the complex (Supplementary Fig. 10b). The tilted particles

 corresponding to each 2D class were grouped, rotationally aligned and used to compute 
three-dimensional reconstructions, which were then inspected in USCF Chimera58, aligned 
and merged. The resulting map was subjected to translational refinement, yielding the RCT 
map of the complex (Supplementary Fig. 10c). This map was then used as the initial model 
for three-dimensional reconstruction and refinement using reference projections59. Particles 
from both the untilted and tilted micrographs were used for the refinement. No contrast 
transfer function (CTF) correction was performed. The ‘resolution’ (level of self-
consistency) of the final map was 22 Å when a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) threshold of 
0.5 was used. Forward projections of the map corresponded well to two-dimensional classes 
(Supplementary Fig. 10d). The level of the map was chosen based on fitting a Fab domain 
into the corresponding density. The map was visualized in UCSF Chimera.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., 
San Diego, CA), unless specifically noted otherwise in the figure legends. All of the 
statistical tests performed are described in the figure legends, and correlations were 
considered significant at P < 0.05.

Delineation of the serological repertoire to IIV3. (a) Experimental design. For the 
sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR)-encoding transcripts (BCR-seq), we used peripheral B 
cells isolated 7 d after vaccination to sequence the VH repertoires for constructing custom 
databases of each donor for heavy chain peptide identification and the paired heavy and light 
chain (VH:VL) repertoire for acquiring the endogenous light-chain information for the heavy 
chains. From sera of the donors, antibodies specific to each IIV1 were isolated through IIV1-
immobilized column purification, and the purified immunoglobulins were subsequently 
analyzed proteomically (Ig-seq). Representative serum antibodies were recombinantly 
expressed for characterization. (b) Representative serological repertoire (rep.) (of n = 36 that 
we analyzed) (donor 1, day 28 anti–H1 A/CA09). Each bar represents a unique clonotype, 
and the y axis indicates the relative abundance (fraction), as determined by proteomic 
analysis. (c) Heat maps of the relative amounts of antibody clonotypes (each column 
indicates distinct clonotype) comprising the serological repertoire to each IIV1 at different 
time points for donor 1. The amount of each clonotype is determined by multiplying its 
relative abundance by the serum titer for that sample. Relative amounts are determined by 
normalizing the amounts to day 28 serum titers (Online Methods). Similar analyses were 
done for all of the donors (n = 4). (d) Predominance of pre-existing antibody clonotypes 
(Abs) in serum after vaccination. Each data point (see key) corresponds to the fraction of 
pre-existing Abs in the serological repertoire to an IIV1 for a specific donor. Averages are 
calculated as mean, with error-bars indicating s.e.m. (n = 12 for each group). Vic, Victoria.

 (e) Correlation between ELISA serum titer to IIV1 and the number of clonotypes in the 
respective serum repertoires. Each data point corresponds to titers and the number of 
clonotypes in the serological repertoire specific to an IIV1 for a donor at each time point (n 
= 36). (f) Inverse correlation between pre-vaccination ELISA serum titers and the frequency 
of vaccine-elicited clonotypes at day 28. Frequency is calculated as the number of vaccine-
elicited clonotypes divided by the total number of unique clonotypes at day 28. For e,f, 
statistical analyses were performed using two-sided nonparametric Spearman rank 
correlation test.

Analysis of H1 + H3 cross-reactive serological repertoire. (a) Representative histogram from 
donor 1, day 28 anti–influenza A serological repertoire. The fraction of each antibody 
clonotype in the anti–H1 A/CA09 and anti–H3 A/VI09 repertoires are indicated. CR, cross-
reactive. Similar analyses were done for all of the donors (n = 4) for two antigens at three 
time points (total n = 24 serological repertoires). (b) Relative abundance of H1 + H3 CR 
antibody clonotypes in the serum repertoires. Averages are calculated as the mean, with 
error bars indicating s.e.m. (n = 8 for each group). (c) Inverse correlation between pre-
vaccination amount of H1 + H3 CR antibodies and the frequency of vaccine-elicited CR 
antibodies at day 28. y axis indicates the amount of H1 + H3 CR antibodies in sera at day 0, 
and x axis indicates the frequency of vaccine-elicited CR antibodies, calculated as the 
number of vaccine-elicited cross-reactive clonotypes divided by the total number of cross-
reactive clonotypes at day 28. Amounts were calculated as described in Figure 1c, and 
statistical analyses were performed using a two-sided nonparametric Spearman rank 
correlation test. Symbols in b,c are defined in the key for Figure 1d–f. a.u., arbitrary units.

Biochemical and functional analysis of the recombinantly expressed H1 + H3 CR serum 
antibodies. (a) Binding and functional characteristics. Recombinant monoclonal antibody ID 
(rmAb ID) indicates the donor information, as well as the abundance rankings of the 
antibody at day 28 in respective repertoire (i.e., D1 H1-1/H3-1 indicates that this antibody is 
from donor 1 and ranked first in abundance in the anti–H1 A/CA09 repertoire and first in the 
anti–H3 A/VI09 repertoire). EC50 values, as determined by ELISA, for each recombinant 
antibody tested against IIV1s or rHAs as listed are shown according to the color scheme 
included. A/California/7/2009 (CA09) and A/Perth/16/2009 (PE09) strains were used for 
both the HAI and PVN assays. All assays were repeated in triplicate. (b) Binding of H1 + 
H3 CR antibodies to the HAs on the surface of the MDCKs infected with the 2009 pandemic 
H1N1 strain (A/Netherlands/602/09; NL09), as analyzed by FACS. 50,000 events/sample

 Figure 4. 
Structural analysis of H1 + H3 CR antibodies. (a) Binding characteristics to head versus 
stem HA, as determined by biolayer interferometry, repeated in triplicate. H1 + H3 CR Abs 
bind to the RBS of the HA molecule. D1 H1-3/H3-3 and D1 H1-17/H3-14 antibodies bound 
with high affinity to full-length HA (A/Hong Kong/1/1968 H3) and the RBS domain 
(A/New Caledonia/20/1999 HA RBD H1), whereas minimal binding was observed to a 
stabilized stem HA (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 HA stem H1) construct or to a covalent HA 
trimer molecule (A/Hong Kong/1/1968 H3 (212Cys–216Cys). (b) Analysis of HA–Fab 
complexes by negative-stain EM shows that the antibody binds to a HA monomer. Scale bar, 
100 Å. (c) EM structure of D1 H1-3/H3-3 in complex with HA, determined to 22 Å using 
the random conical-tilt method. (d) Combined electron-density map of a single HA protomer 
and antibody Fab that were docked separately. (e) The fitted HA protomer–Fab complex was 
overlaid with an intact HA trimer (colored red-to-white indicating influenza HA 
conservation for one protomer; light blue for the remaining two protomers) showing that 
major overlap occurs between the Fab and an adjacent protomer molecule, which precludes 
binding of the antibodies to intact trimers. A set of highly conserved residues is located in 
this region (inset), which likely forms part of this antibody epitope.
