Abstract
Background
For individuals with recurrent or persistent non-specific low back pain (LBP), exercise and
exercise combined with education have been shown to be effective in preventing new epi-
sodes or in reducing the impact of the condition. Chiropractors have traditionally used Main-
tenance Care (MC), as secondary and tertiary prevention strategies. The aim of this trial
was to investigate the effectiveness of MC on pain trajectories for patients with recurrent or
persistent LBP.
Method
This pragmatic, investigator-blinded, two arm randomized controlled trial included consecu-
tive patients (18–65 years old) with non-specific LBP, who had an early favorable response
to chiropractic care. After an initial course of treatment, eligible subjects were randomized to
either MC or control (symptom-guided treatment). The primary outcome was total number of
days with bothersome LBP during 52 weeks collected weekly with text-messages (SMS)
and estimated by a GEE model.
Results
Three hundred and twenty-eight subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two treat-
ment groups. MC resulted in a reduction in the total number of days per week with bother-
some LBP compared with symptom-guided treatment. During the 12 month study period,
the MC group (n = 163, 3 dropouts) reported 12.8 (95% CI = 10.1, 15.5; p = <0.001) fewer
days in total with bothersome LBP compared to the control group (n = 158, 4 dropouts) and

Conclusion
MC was more effective than symptom-guided treatment in reducing the total number of
days over 52 weeks with bothersome non-specific LBP but it resulted in a higher number of
treatments. For selected patients with recurrent or persistent non-specific LBP who respond
well to an initial course of chiropractic care, MC should be considered an option for tertiary
prevention.
Introduction
Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common and costly healthcare problems
in society today [1]. The burden of disabling LBP on individuals, families, communities, indus-
tries and societies is substantial and is now the leading cause of activity limitation and work
absence in the world [1, 2]. In Sweden (2012) 12% of the total cost of musculoskeletal disorders
arises from spinal pain (ICD M50-M54) [3]. Given that LBP is often recurrent and has a large
negative impact on society [4], it seems logical to focus on preventive strategies. In general,
interventions aimed at prevention of chronic medical conditions are often described as either
secondary or tertiary strategies.
Secondary prevention aims to reduce the impact of a condition (LBP) that has already man-
ifested. This is usually done by encouraging strategies to prevent re-injury such as performing
exercises. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the impact of persistent or chronic LBP. This is
usually done by helping people manage long-term, often complex pain conditions in order to
improve their quality of life and ability to function.
The multifaceted etiology of LBP (including social, behavioral and psychological factors)
implies that this is a complex problem in need of individually tailored interventions that are
difficult to test experimentally [5]. To date, the number of LBP secondary or tertiary preven-
tion strategies for which there is empirical evidence are few; there is moderate quality evidence
that exercise combined with education reduces the risk of an episode of LBP [6].
Chiropractors are trained to assess and treat disorders of the musculoskeletal system, of
which LBP is the most common [7, 8]. The majority of patients seeking chiropractic care
receive some form of manual therapy, of which spinal manipulation and mobilization are the
most common, often along with advice on exercise [7, 9–11]. Manual therapy has been shown
to be effective for some patients with LBP [12, 13]. The outcome can be predicted by clinical
history and demographic variables such as sex, social benefit, severity of pain, duration of con-
tinuous pain at first consultation, and additional neck pain [14, 15]. For patients receiving
manual therapy, one of the strongest known predictors of a positive outcome is subjective
improvement at the fourth visit. These patients, who are “fast responders”, also have a greater
chance of a good outcome at three and 12 months [15].
It is common for chiropractors to recommend “maintenance care (MC)”, i.e. preventive
consultations/visits for recurrent and persistent musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction [16].
MC can be viewed as a form of secondary or tertiary prevention and may include manual ther-
apy, individual exercise programs and lifestyle advice delivered in regularly spaced visits over
longer periods of time [9–11, 16–18].

 Exactly how MC works is poorly understood but the main hypothesis is that treatment may
improve biomechanical and neuromuscular function and address psychosocial issues, thereby
reducing the risk of relapse into pain [19–24]. About one fifth of all visits to Scandinavian
chiropractors are MC visits and 98% of Swedish chiropractors use the approach to some
extent [16]. MC is traditionally employed as a long term-approach described as: “. . .a regimen
designed to provide for the patient’s continued well-being or for maintaining the optimum state of
health while minimizing recurrences of the clinical status” [25] and “. . .treatment, either sched-
uled or elective, which occurred after optimum recorded benefit was reached, provided there was
no evidence of relapse” [26]. A number of studies in Scandinavia have investigated the indica-
tions, frequency and content of MC and there seems to be a common management strategy
shared by chiropractors [11, 16–18, 27–33]. Although MC is widely used, the evidence of its
effectiveness is equivocal [34, 35]. Two previous studies have investigated MC for LBP. Both
contain methodological flaws because they did not take into account the current evidence
about how MC is delivered in clinical practice. One of the studies was an efficacy study on a
small sample [34]; the other was an RCT conducted in a hospital setting on a secondary care
population with methods (frequency of visits and method of delivery) different from how chi-
ropractors normally deliver MC [36]. The alternative to MC is usually to discontinue care and
recommend the patients to schedule a new visit when they experience a new episode of pain or
need treatment for other reasons. It is currently not known which method is most appropriate,
MC or treatment only when there is perceived need by the patient and this is also debated
within the chiropractic profession. A better understanding of the possible benefits of MC
could greatly improve patient care by either changing clinical behavior by avoiding the proce-
dure altogether or to recommend MC as a procedure to be used for selected patients.
We, therefore, designed and conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which took
the current state of evidence into account and tried to mimic the clinical decision-making pro-
cess and approach of Scandinavian chiropractors today [37].
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of MC as compared to
chiropractic care given when there was a subject-perceived need (i.e. symptom-guided treat-
ments) in a population of chiropractic patients with recurrent or persistent LBP.
The objectives of the study were to compare MC to symptom-guided care with regard to
the total number of days with bothersome LBP over 52 weeks, the prevalence of days with pain
per week over time as trajectories, and the total number of treatments.
Materials and methods
Trial design
This was a pragmatic, investigator- and assessor- blinded randomized controlled trial with a
two arm parallel design. The trial is described in detail in a study protocol [37], and is briefly
described below. No changes were made to the method after commencement; the trial has
been conducted and analyzed according to the procedure described in the ethical application,
approved by local ethics committee at Karolinska Institutet (2007/1458-31/4), which the pub-
lished study protocol [37] is based on. The original protocol submitted for the ethical applica-
tion along with ethical approvals have been included as supplementary material (S1 and
S2 Files). The trial was registered in Clinical trials.gov; NCT01539863 (February 22, 2012).
Funding bodies were the Institute for Chiropractic and Neuro-musculoskeletal Research, the
European Chiropractors’ Union (project ID A13.02) and the Danish Chiropractic Research
Foundation (grant number 11/148). None of the funding bodies have had any influence of
the design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation of the data, or in the production of the
manuscript.

 Participants
Consecutive patients with persistent or recurrent LBP were screened for eligibility in a step-
wise manner (at Baseline 1, Baseline 2 and inclusion visit) as described in Table 1. “Baseline 1”
was the initial screening visit, when patients first consulted the chiropractor. “Baseline 2” was
the 4th visit (or earlier depending on the patient’s subjective improvement), at which patients
with a favorable response to treatment were identified. At this visit the patients were asked to
rate their improvement on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “definitely worse” to “definitely
improved”. Only patients who rated themselves as “definitely improved” were eligible to con-
tinue in the inclusion procedure. The study start occurred at this inclusion visit, when the
initial treatment plan was completed and the clinician would recommend patients to either
discontinue care or start a MC plan, i.e. when the clinician perceived that the patient’s next
visit could be scheduled with an interval of 1 month or longer. This was the final step of the
inclusion process, at which patients were randomly allocated to one of the treatment arms.
Patients were recruited between 2012 and 2016 from 40 Swedish chiropractors with clinics
across Sweden. The clinicians were selected from an existing practice-based research network
of chiropractors. Based on a previous survey [16], chiropractors who recommend MC to
selected patients were identified and included in the study, while clinicians who never or
always recommend MC were not included. This was to minimize bias from preconceptions
and personal preferences about this treatment concept. Prior to enrolment in the study, all the
clinicians attended a study procedure workshop. Detailed instructions regarding the protocol
were discussed, and written information/instructions were provided. To ensure protocol fidel-
ity, each participating clinician was contacted by a member of the project management group
from Karolinska Institutet by weekly telephone calls until both parties were satisfied with the
level of understanding of the treatment protocol and adherence to the project.
The study was approved by local ethics committee at Karolinska Institutet (2007/1458-31/
4). All subjects signed an informed consent during the inclusion visit in the trial. The manu-
script does not contain individual personal data, therefore consent for publication was not
necessary.
Interventions
The two treatment arms were MC (preventive treatment, i.e. clinician-controlled) and control
(symptom-guided treatment, i.e. patient controlled). Both are strategies used in daily practice
and are similar in nature, but they have different purposes and scheduling. The participating

 clinicians were instructed to tailor treatment-content and frequency of visits to each patient’s
individual needs, in accordance with usual practice. In the MC group, the aim was to schedule
patients before substantial pain reoccurred (i.e. controlled by the clinician), while in the con-
trol group patients were instructed to call in if and when the pain recurred (patient controlled).
If patients in the control group made a new appointment, they were treated at one or several
sessions until maximum benefit was reached and were once again instructed to call when in
pain. If patients in the MC group experienced a new pain episode prior to the next scheduled
visit, they were instructed to call for an earlier appointment and were cared for accordingly
until they were ready to be scheduled for preventive visits again. MC visits were scheduled
according to the clinicians’ judgement of patient need, but at intervals of no more than three
months [32]. In order to achieve compliance with the treatment plan, patients in both groups
paid half of the normal fee for these visits and the remaining half was donated by the clinician.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for the trial was the number of days with bothersome LBP experienced
during the study period (52 weeks), collected by means of weekly text messages using an auto-
mated system called “SMS-track” [38–40]. If a subject did not answer the SMS-question within
48 hours, a reminder message with the same question was sent. Weekly text messages provided
information about the total number of days with bothersome LBP over the previous week. The
single item question used in the SMS message was the following: “On how many days during
the past week were you bothered by your lower back (i.e. it affected your daily activities or rou-
tines)? Please answer with a number between 0 and 7”. The question has been considered useful
in previous studies in similar settings for measuring the clinical course of LBP [41–43].
‘Bothersomeness’ is a concept that has been used in several studies to measure the impact of
pain rather than the actual presence of pain [44–47]. The term is thought to capture the pres-
ence of consequential pain and has been proposed as a standard outcome measure in LBP out-
come research [46]. Bothersomeness has been found to correlate well with self-rated health
[48], pain intensity [49], disability, prediction of work absence/healthcare consultations and
psychological distress (anxiety, depression) [50]. In this study bothersomeness was used as a
dichotomous outcome where the patient was asked to define whether each day with pain both-
ered them or not, i.e. affected daily activities or routines. This way, only pain that was relevant
to the patient would be captured making each reported day with pain, at least theoretically,
clinically relevant. The primary outcome used in this paper may be considered novel, but
the psychometric properties have been tested in one study [49] where a positive correlation
between pain intensity and number of days with bothersome LBP was shown.
At the first visit, patients were asked to complete a questionnaire with descriptive character-
istics, pain intensity (0–10 Numeric Rating Scale) [51, 52] and self-rated health (EuroQol 5
dimensions) [53] as well as psychological and behavioral characteristics (MPI-S) [54–56].
At the fourth visit, another questionnaire was administered to record data about subjective
improvement (recorded with a 5-point Likert scale from “definitely worse” to “definitely
improved”), pain intensity (0–10 Numeric Rating Scale) [51, 52] and use of pain medication
(Yes/No, type). At the study start visit, the final questionnaire in the inclusion process was
administered in order to record further descriptive data, activity limitation (Roland Morris
Disability Questionnaire) [57] and pain intensity (0–10 Numeric Rating Scale) [51, 52]. At 12
months’ follow-up, questionnaires were sent to patients so they could record self-rated health
(EuroQol 5 dimensions) [53], activity limitation (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire)
[57], pain intensity (0–10 Numeric Rating Scale) [51, 52], treatment by other clinicians/practi-
tioners/Medication (Yes/No, type), overall satisfaction with the care plan (recorded with a

 5-point Likert scale from “definitely worth it” to “definitely not worth it”), overall health
(recorded with a 5-point Likert scale from “perfect health” to “poor health”) [58], sick leave in
the previous year (recorded as No, 1–7 days, 8–14 days, >15 days) [59] and perceived produc-
tion loss due to pain (modified WPAI, LBP–V2-Swedish) [60]. At follow-up, the clinicians also
received a questionnaire asking them to describe treatment content, side effects, number of
visits/ dates by reviewing the patients’ clinical records retrospectively.
Sample size
The sample size was estimated on the basis of a 30% difference in the number of days with
bothersome LBP. The standard deviation from a previous sample [42] in a similar population
was used to predict the variance in this sample for the sample size calculation. With a signifi-
cance level of 5% it was estimated that 177 subjects were needed in each treatment arm to
reach a power of 80%. To allow for dropouts a total of 400 subjects were aimed for in the
recruitment to the trial.
Randomization
A statistician created 40 permuted blocks with 10 subjects in each with an overall 1:1 allocation
ratio between groups according to a randomization schedule. SPSS v20 was used to generate
the randomization code. A research assistant created 400 consecutively numbered sealed
opaque envelopes containing a letter with instructions and group assignment. At the pre-study
workshops each clinician received 10 envelopes (one single randomization block) along with
documentation of the study procedure. As patients became eligible to enter the study (third
inclusion step) and consent of participation was given, the envelope was opened by the
clinician in front of the subject in a consecutive sequence. The clinicians were instructed to
describe the two treatment strategies to the patients as similar procedures, both in clinical
use, without implying that either was more effective than the other. If a clinician was unable to
recruit 10 subjects, the remaining envelopes were transferred to other clinicians.
Blinding
The clinicians were blinded until the randomization procedure at the study start visit and
had no opportunity to influence the assignment of the treatment arm. The investigators were
blinded until the completion of the primary data analysis, when the group identities were
revealed.
Statistical methods
An intention to treat protocol was used and estimates were reported with arithmetic means
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). To allow for accurate estimates for the primary out-
come (number of days with bothersome LBP) collected by weekly SMS messages, individuals
with � 12 weeks of missing data were excluded from the analysis. No imputation of missing
data was made.
The total number of days with bothersome LBP over 12 months was estimated using a
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) linear regression model, using an independent corre-
lation structure and a robust variance estimator. QIC-values (quasi-likelihood under the inde-
pendence model criterion) were used to estimate the most appropriate correlation structure
for the data. The analysis was performed in two steps with a primary analysis considering only
group and time as covariates in the model and a secondary analysis considering also possible
differences in baseline variables as covariates. These covariates were chosen for theoretical/

 logical reasons and thought to have a possible moderating effect on the outcome. Sex, treating
clinician, pain intensity, self-rated health, activity limitation, patient expectations, presence of
leg pain, type of work, use of analgesic medication, sick leave, number of treatments during
inclusion period, and the number of days with bothersome LBP during the first week of the
trial where considered possible covariates in the statistical model by including them individu-
ally and as interaction terms.
In the primary analysis of number of days with bothersome LBP, time and group as well as
the interaction terms time2, group�time and group�time2 were significant (p<0.01), yielded
the best goodness of fit with the data, and were therefore included in the final model.
In the secondary analysis of number of days with bothersome LBP, a stepwise exclusion
procedure was used by always removing the least significant variable until a final model was
reached where all variables left were significant (p<0.05) and the best goodness of fit value
could be obtained. The final model in the secondary analysis included the variables group,
time, time2, group�time and group�time2, treating clinician, pain intensity (at baseline),
use of analgesic medication (during inclusion period), and the number of days with bother-
some LBP during the first week of the trial (Week 1).
The total number of visits was estimated with a GEE Poisson regression model, using an
independent correlation structure and a robust variance estimator. The analysis of visit data
followed a similar analytical strategy as the analysis of number of days with bothersome LBP
with a primary analysis modeled with group and time and a secondary analysis also including
the baseline variable as potential covariates. In the primary analysis the best model fit was
achieved with the variables group and time2. The variables included in the secondary analysis
were Group, Time2, Activity Limitation (RMDQ), Use of analgesic medication (during
inclusion period), Walking-standing type of work and Patient expectations.
A sensitivity analysis, using a per protocol perspective, was also performed using both mod-
els form the primary and secondary analysis. This only included subjects in the MC group
with four or more visits (subjects who had attended at least every third month).
The presence of pain over time as trajectories (number of days with bothersome LBP per
week) is presented visually in graphs as crude mean weekly values as well as estimated weekly
differences between groups (primary and secondary analysis) with 95% CI.
All analyses were performed using the statistical software SPSS version 25 and STATA ver-
sion 12 [61, 62].

Recruitment.
The first subject was included in the study in April 2012 and the last in Jan-
uary 2016. A total of 2,033 patients were screened during their initial visit (baseline 1). Of
these, 1,122 were not eligible (according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in
Table 1). At the 4th visit (baseline 2) a total of 616 subjects were screened for “definite improve-
ment”. This resulted in a further 176 subjects being excluded from the trial (and an additional
295 subjects lost for unknown reasons). At the inclusion visit, 328 subjects were randomized
into the trial (another 112 subjects were lost for unknown reasons). After randomization,
seven subjects dropped out and could not be included in the data analysis (four changed their
minds and did not want to participate; two became pregnant during the study period and
one moved to another country). Of the 16,692 SMS messages that were sent during the study
period, 1.1% were without a response. Two subjects were excluded from the data analysis due

 to 12 or more weeks of missing SMS data. The final data analysis was conducted in April 2017
and included 319 subjects.
The vast majority of subjects were recruited from middle to southern parts of Sweden,
where the majority of the population lives. The areas bordering on the cities of Stockholm,
Malmo
¨, Karlstad, Falun and Luleå contributed the highest number of subjects in the trial. The
distribution of subjects across Sweden has been illustrated as a heat-map based on the patients
residential postal codes, see S1 Fig.
Clinicians.
Out of the 40 recruited clinicians, five eventually chose not to participate due
to the complexity of the inclusion process. Among the participating clinicians, the mean num-
ber of years in practice was 17.9, ranging from one to 38 years. The mean and median number
of recruited subjects/clinician was 9.1 and 8.0, ranging from one to 42. These clinicians are
part of a practice-based research network and have been found to be a good representation of
the chiropractors of the Swedish Chiropractic Association (LKR) in previous studies [42, 63–
66]).
Baseline data.
A detailed description of the baseline demographic and clinical characteris-
tics of the subjects during all steps of the inclusion process is provided in a supplementary
table, S1 Table. Overall, the subjects were similar at the different steps of the inclusion process
and differed only in the criteria on which the inclusion process was based. No systematic dif-
ferences can be observed among the individuals who were lost during the inclusion procedure
compared to the individuals who were followed up in the trial.
A detailed description of the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the sub-
jects in both groups who completed the trial is presented in Table 2. The two groups had simi-
lar descriptive baseline data, which indicates that the randomization had worked well.
Follow-up data at 52 weeks.
Table 3 presents the follow-up data collected at the end of
the study period (12 months).
Outcomes
The total number of days with bothersome LBP over 52 weeks.
The total number of
days with bothersome LBP (primary analysis) over the twelve months was 85.2 (95% CI = 83.5,
87.0) for the MC group and 98.0 (95% CI = 95.9, 100.1) for the control group. In the sensitivity
analysis, using a per protocol perspective, only subjects who had four or more visits in the MC
group were included (n = 278). In the sensitivity analysis (per protocol) the total number of
days with bothersome LBP (primary analysis) over the twelve months was 89.1 (95% CI = 87.0,
91.07) for the MC group and 98.0 (95% CI = 95.9, 100.1) for the control group. Outliers were
considered as part of the primary analysis but did not change the interpretation or the estimate
substantially. Group differences from the primary and secondary analysis are reported in
Table 4.
The development of pain over time as trajectories over 52 weeks.
The crude pain trajec-
tory of mean number of days with bothersome LBP per week is illustrated in Fig 2. Data shows
that both groups continued to improve during the first quarter of the study period and then
appeared to stabilize. Furthermore, the development over time for the two groups was different
at the beginning of the study period, with the MC group having a faster reduction in days with
bothersome LBP and reaching a lower steady state earlier. Figs 3 and 4 illustrates the pain tra-
jectory for the difference in mean number of days with bothersome LBP per week modeled
according to the primary and secondary analysis.
Visits.
The total number of visits (primary analysis) over the twelve months was 6.7 (95%

 months was 8.6 (95% CI = 8.5, 8.7) for the MC group and 4.8 (95% CI = 4.7, 4.9) for the control
group. Outliers were considered as part of the primary analysis but did not change the inter-
pretation or the estimate substantially. Group differences from the primary and secondary
analysis are reported in Table 4. The most common treatment was spinal manipulation
(85.5%, 94.2%), followed by information/advice (62.3%, 75.0%) and soft tissue treatment
(61.6%, 63.2%) for the control and MC groups respectively. The proportions of the different
treatments in each group are shown in Table 3.
Harm.
No serious harm was reported by either of the two treatment groups, although
some minor side effects were reported. The proportions of common side effects are described
in Table 3. See Table 5 for a full description of side effects reported by the clinician retrospec-
tively from the clinical records.
Discussion
This is one of the first studies to test the effect of preventive manual care performed by chiro-
practors (Maintenance Care) for recurrent and persistent LBP. The pragmatic nature of this
randomized clinical trial, which uses all current evidence in the field and mimics clinical prac-
tice, makes this a unique contribution to the field of manual care and primary care medicine.
MC resulted in a reduction in the total number of days per week with bothersome LBP com-
pared with symptom-guided treatment. This reduction may be important for patients, as it
was observed steadily over a period of 12 months, accumulating to a sum almost equal to the
total number of work days in a month. Furthermore, the MC group required only a slightly
higher number of visits to the chiropractor than the control group.
The secondary analysis of the data which included baseline variables as covariates did not
change the estimates substantially. Although the difference in number of days is modest, the
costs in terms of increased number of visits is small and the results should be considered of rel-
evance for patients, clinicians and policymakers.
Where overall pain trajectories are concerned, both groups continued to improve after
inclusion in the trial. This could be an indication that the groups had not achieved maximum
benefit from the initial treatment when they were randomized into the trial. However, of the
two groups the MC improved faster and achieved the steady state phase earlier with a lower
mean number of days with LBP per week. The difference between the groups holds for the rest
of the study period but becomes smaller towards the end. It is important to point out that from

 our data we cannot extrapolate the outcome beyond 12 months if patients were to continue
with MC.
The main strength of this trial is the randomized design and the large longitudinal data set
of high quality. The data set with 16,505 data points and 1.1% missing data is in itself remark-
able and allows for a detailed analysis of the patients’ clinical course over 12 months.
The study sample was purposely chosen according to specific evidence-based criteria to
mimic clinical practice. Individuals were selected on the basis of their need for preventive
interventions because of the recurrent and persistent nature of their condition. However, only
individuals who responded well to an initial course of care were included [15, 67]. By selecting
patients with the most favorable response to treatment, the intervention targeted the most

 relevant patients where the potential benefit was believed to be the greatest. Previous research
has shown that this process of stratification is how Scandinavian chiropractors select suitable
patients for MC [16, 27–30, 33]. The results are therefore easily generalizable to current clinical
practice by chiropractors in the Scandinavian countries and can be easily transferred and
implemented.

 Another strength of the study is the multicenter design featuring many clinics that recruited
subjects in a geographical distribution that resembled the distribution of the general popula-
tion of Sweden.
The treatment was not reported as being linked to any serious harm and both the interven-
tion and the control regimes must be considered safe treatments. There were minor transient
reactions to the treatment, evenly distributed between the two groups, such as local soreness
for 1–2 days. Transient reactions such as increased stiffness and pain are common and have
been reported in previous trials and are considered normal reactions to this type of treatment
[67, 68]. A few patients also reported uncommon but transient (1–3 days) reactions such as
headache, nausea, restlessness and coxygodynia.
The results of this study support the findings of the only other sufficiently powered RCT, by
Senna and Shereen, to have investigated preventive manual care [36]. They found that patients
who continued to receive spinal manipulation after an initial course of care had lower pain
and disability scores at a 10-month follow-up. However, there were major differences in the
inclusion procedure and the application of the treatment compared with the present trial. In
fact, the treatment protocol used in the trial by Senna and Shereen differs greatly from the cur-
rent clinical practice of MC that has been described in the literature. Nevertheless, it does indi-
cate that these types of patients benefit from continued care, perhaps regardless of the type of
manual care provided.
Whether the effect observed in this trial is clinically relevant is a different question alto-
gether, as there is no previous data about what constitutes a minimally clinically-important dif-
ference with regards to change scores or absolute levels related to days with bothersome pain.
The very nature of our measurement was, in itself, designed to be clinically relevant, because
patients were asked to judge the impact of pain and whether it bothered them, i.e. whether the
consequences of pain were relevant to them. The estimates are therefore likely to have clinical
relevance for the patient, particularly when we look at the entire 12 month period. However, as
the weekly difference is small it is possible that patients might not rate the difference as clini-
cally meaningful on a week to week basis.
A weakness of the trial was the fairly large number of individuals who were lost during the
3 step inclusion process. Of the subjects who were eligible after the first visit, 32% were lost
and of the subjects who were eligible at the fourth visit, 25% were lost. The reasons for these
losses are unknown to the research team, however one likely explanation is that a very fast or
a very poor improvement could have made the patient decide to discontinue care. Given the
complex nature of the inclusion procedure, it is also possible that some clinicians forgot to
administer the follow-up forms. The baseline data for the lost subjects were very similar to
those for the included and the excluded subjects, which indicates a non-systematic error and
therefore not a major concern. However, this drop-out rate might well mirror situations in
real clinical practice, where many people stop treatment regardless of the advice given by the
clinician.
We also failed to include the minimum number of subjects estimated by the power analysis.
However, the power analysis was challenging given that MC is a poorly investigated procedure
using a novel instrument (days with bothersome pain) with little robust prior data to base it
on. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results.
Some of the data-collecting clinicians raised concerns about the strict fourth visit eligibility
criteria and argued that there were a number of patients who reported a definite improvement
at later visits and therefore might have been suitable candidates for the trial. Concerns were
also raised about the intervals at which the clinicians were instructed to schedule preventive
visits (between 1 and 3 months). Some clinicians suggested that some patients (the ones with
more persistent pain) would have benefited from a shorter intervals than 1 month to be able to

 prevent future episodes. It should be noted that both of these requirements were enforced
due to previous research results. In a controlled experiment such as this, it is impossible to
completely mimic all the individual variations of clinical reality. Concerns such as these are
therefore valid but difficult to act on.
Future work will look at how the intervention and control groups differ in a secondary anal-
ysis focusing on the development of pain around the time of the visits. The higher number of
visits in the MC group represents a higher use of resources and the achieved effect should be
considered in the light of this. Cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility of the intervention will
therefore be explored in a coming study.
Conclusion
In patients with recurrent and persistent LBP who responds well to an initial course of manual
therapy, MC resulted in a reduction in number of days with bothersome LBP per week, com-
pared with symptom-guided treatment. In total, the MC group had on average 12.8 fewer days
with bothersome LBP over 12 months. The effect of the intervention was achieved at the cost
of 1.7 additional visits to the chiropractor. For patients with recurrent and persistent LBP who
are selected according to evidence-based criteria, MC should be considered as an option for
tertiary prevention.
