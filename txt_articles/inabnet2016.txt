Abstract
Background Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy by a
vestibular approach (TOETVA) is a novel technique for
thyroid gland excision. Compared to the transaxillary
endoscopic and bilateral axillo-breast approaches, which
require substantial dissection to reach the thyroid gland,
TOETVA provides the most direct access to the target
organ.
Methods The aim of this video is to provide a step-by-step
overview of TOETVA and demonstrate how to set up and
utilize intraoperative nerve monitoring.
Results Three incisions are placed in the vestibular region
of the oral cavity just below the lower lip for placement of
2 lateral 5-mm trocars and 1 centrally placed 11-mm trocar.
Insufflation to 6 mm Hg is used to maintain the working
spacing. Using a 2-handed technique and triangulation, the
thyroid gland is mobilized, taking care to identify and
preserve the relevant cervical anatomy.
Conclusion TOETVA is safe and feasible and provides an
excellent cosmetic outcome with the most confidentially
compared
to
the
other
remote
access
endoscopic
approaches.
