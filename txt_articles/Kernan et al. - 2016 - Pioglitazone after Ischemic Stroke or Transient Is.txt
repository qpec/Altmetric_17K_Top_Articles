Abstract
BACKGROUND—Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at 
increased risk for future cardiovascular events despite current preventive therapies. The 
identification of insulin resistance as a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction raised the 
possibility that pioglitazone, which improves insulin sensitivity, might benefit patients with 
cerebrovascular disease.
METHODS—In this multicenter, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 3876 patients who had 
had a recent ischemic stroke or TIA to receive either pioglitazone (target dose, 45 mg daily) or 
placebo. Eligible patients did not have diabetes but were found to have insulin resistance on the 
basis of a score of more than 3.0 on the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 
(HOMA-IR) index. The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal stroke or myocardial infarction.
RESULTS—By 4.8 years, a primary outcome had occurred in 175 of 1939 patients (9.0%) in the 
pioglitazone group and in 228 of 1937 (11.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the 
pioglitazone group, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.93; P = 0.007). Diabetes 
developed in 73 patients (3.8%) and 149 patients (7.7%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 
0.33 to 0.69; P<0.001). There was no significant between-group difference in all-cause mortality 
(hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.17; P = 0.52). Pioglitazone was associated with a greater 
frequency of weight gain exceeding 4.5 kg than was placebo (52.2% vs. 33.7%, P<0.001), edema 
(35.6% vs. 24.9%, P<0.001), and bone fracture requiring surgery or hospitalization (5.1% vs. 
3.2%, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS—In this trial involving patients without diabetes who had insulin resistance 
along with a recent history of ischemic stroke or TIA, the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction 
was lower among patients who received pioglitazone than among those who received placebo. 
Pioglitazone was also associated with a lower risk of diabetes but with higher risks of weight gain, 
edema, and fracture. (Funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;

 Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) affect more than 14 million persons 
worldwide annually.1,2 Affected patients are at increased risk for future cardiovascular 
events,3,4 and prevention of these adverse outcomes is a major goal in their care.
Treatment of insulin resistance represents a potential new preventive strategy that could be 
added to standard care after ischemic stroke or TIA.5 Insulin resistance is nearly universal in 
patients with type 2 diabetes but is also present in more than 50% of patients without 
diabetes who have had an ischemic stroke or a TIA.6 The presence of insulin resistance 
increases the risk of vascular disease, possibly because of associated hypertension, 
hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, 
inflammation, and increased platelet reactivity.7–9
Clinical strategies to improve insulin sensitivity include exercise,9,10 diet,11 weight 
reduction,12 and medications.9,13 The thiazolidinedione class of peroxisome proliferator–
activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonists are among the most potent insulin-sensitizing drugs 
available.14 One medication in this class, pioglitazone, may reduce the risk of cardiovascular 
events, including stroke, in patients with type 2 diabetes, for whom the drug is currently 
approved as a glucose-lowering agent.15,16 We designed the Insulin Resistance Intervention 
after Stroke (IRIS) trial to test the hypothesis that pioglitazone would reduce the rates of 
stroke and myocardial infarction after ischemic stroke or TIA in patients without diabetes 
who have insulin resistance.
METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
The design of this international, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has been 
reported previously.17 Trial leadership, committee structure, and sites are described in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Members 
of the operations committee and the statisticians designed the study. From 2005 through 
2013, investigators at 179 hospitals and clinics enrolled patients and collected data. The 
statistical analysis was performed at the Department of Veterans Affairs Connecticut Health 
Care System. The first author wrote the first draft of the manuscript. All the other authors 
contributed revisions and vouch for the reported data. Pioglitazone and placebo tablets were 
donated by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International. Representatives of Takeda were provided 
with a copy of the protocol (available at NEJM.org) and manuscript but had no role in the 
development of the protocol, the conduct of the trial, the interpretation of the data, or the 
preparation of the manuscript. The trial was monitored by an independent data and safety 
monitoring board appointed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 
which funded the study. Trial operations were approved by the local ethics committee at 
each site. The study was conducted and reported with fidelity to the protocol.
TRIAL PATIENTS
Eligible patients were at least 40 years of age and had had a qualifying ischemic stroke or 
TIA17 during the 6 months before randomization. All the patients provided written informed 
consent. Patients were required to have insulin resistance, which was defined as a value of

 more than 3.0 on the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. 
The HOMA-IR value was calculated as the level of fasting glucose (measured in millimoles 
per liter) times the level of fasting insulin (measured in microunits per milliliter) divided by 
22.5.18 The index threshold of 3.0 was chosen because it identifies the highest quartile 
among populations without diabetes.19,20 Because insulin sensitivity may be transiently 
impaired after a stroke,21 the screening blood test was conducted at least 14 days after the 
index event.
Patients with diabetes were excluded from the trial. Diabetes was diagnosed if a potential 
participant was taking medication for diabetes or met the 2005 criteria of the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) for fasting plasma glucose (i.e., ≥126 mg per deciliter [7 mmol 
per liter]), as confirmed by repeated testing.22 We did not perform an oral glucose-tolerance 
test but excluded patients with a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% or more. We also 
excluded patients with New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 heart failure or class 2 heart 
failure with a reduced ejection fraction.17 Other criteria for exclusion included active liver 
disease, an alanine aminotransferase level of more than 2.5 times the upper limit of the 
normal range, a hemoglobin level of less than 8.5 g per deciliter, moderate or severe 
dependent pitting edema, carotid revascularization within 14 days before randomization, and 
use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive or oral glucocorticoid. In response to regulatory 
changes that were adopted during the trial, the data and safety monitoring board approved 
additional exclusions for a history of heart failure, bladder cancer, or certain conditions that 
increased the risk of bladder cancer.17
TRIAL PROCEDURES
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either pioglitazone or 
matching placebo. The initial dose was 15 mg of pioglitazone daily or placebo. Patients who 
reported no new or worsening edema, shortness of breath, myalgia, or excessive weight gain 
were instructed to increase the dose to two pills daily (30 mg of pioglitazone or placebo) at 4 
weeks and to three pills daily (45 mg of pioglitazone or placebo) at 8 weeks. At 12 weeks, 
patients were started on one 45-mg pioglitazone tablet or placebo tablet daily.
If patients reported any of the aforementioned signs or symptoms, study investigators treated 
them according to algorithms. A reduction in study-drug dose was included in the 
algorithms and was also permitted by the internal safety committee if such a reduction 
allowed the patient to continue taking the drug. Pioglitazone and placebo were permanently 
discontinued if heart failure or bladder cancer developed or if a patient had two distinct low-
energy bone fractures (i.e., resulting from a fall from a sitting or standing position or from a 
low platform, such as a bed).
Patients were contacted every 4 months, and participation ended at 5 years or at the last 
scheduled contact before July 2015. Investigators monitored patients’ adherence to the 
assigned regimen by asking about drug use and performing pill counts. If a patient briefly 
stopped taking a study drug, investigators included such intervals as zero use in calculations 
of adherence. Adherence calculations were stopped at the date a patient withdrew consent.

 TRIAL OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was a first fatal or nonfatal stroke or fatal or nonfatal myocardial 
infarction.17 Prespecified secondary outcomes were stroke; acute coronary syndrome; the 
composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure resulting in hospitalization or 
death; death from any cause; diabetes; and cognitive decline from baseline, as assessed by 
means of the Modified Mini–Mental State Examination (on which scores range from 0 to 
100, with higher scores indicating better function23).17 No other outcomes were 
prespecified. All outcomes and selected safety events (i.e., bone fracture, macular edema, 
and cancer) were adjudicated by the members of independent committees in a blinded 
fashion.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We determined that enrollment of 3136 patients would provide a power of 90% to detect a 4-
year cumulative rate of stroke or myocardial infarction that was 20% lower in the 
pioglitazone group than in the placebo group, assuming a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and 
a 27% outcome rate in the placebo group. Four interim analyses of the primary outcome 
were conducted for efficacy and futility with the use of the O’Brien–Fleming method.19 At 
the second and third interim analyses, the data and safety monitoring board recommended an 
extension of recruitment and follow-up owing to slower recruitment and a lower overall 
event rate than anticipated in order to maintain the statistical power. Decisions were made in 
closed sessions, and investigators were not aware of event rates during the trial.
All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome and all 
prespecified secondary outcomes except cognitive function were analyzed by means of the 
time-to-first-event method. Cumulative event-free probabilities were calculated with the use 
of Kaplan–Meier analysis24 and tested with the use of the log-rank statistic on the basis of a 
two-sided type I error rate of 0.05. The P value for the primary outcome was adjusted for 
interim monitoring with the use of East software, version 6.3 (Cytel), and the P values for 
the five prespecified time-to-event secondary outcomes were adjusted for multiple testing 
with the Hochberg procedure and a family-wise error rate of 0.05. We used the Cox model25 
to estimate the effect of pioglitazone, as compared with placebo, as a hazard ratio with 95% 
confidence intervals. The confidence interval for the primary outcome was adjusted for 
interim analyses with the use of East software, version 6.3, and confidence intervals for the 
secondary outcomes were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the method of Efird and 
Nielsen.26 In planned supplementary analyses, the Cox model was used to estimate the 
hazard ratio for the primary outcome after adjustment for prespecified baseline covariates 
and to test for interactions between treatment and covariates in 13 prespecified subgroups, 
with P values adjusted for multiple testing.27 Missing time-to-event data were treated as 
noninformative censoring. We used a repeated-measures covariance-pattern model on the 
assumption that data were missing at random to analyze the effect of treatment on cognitive 
function; in this analysis, the change from baseline in the annual score on the Modified 
Mini–Mental State Examination was the outcome.
We also conducted two types of ancillary analysis. During the trial, new definitions for 
stroke,28 myocardial infarction,29 and diabetes30 were published. The data and safety

 monitoring board approved ancillary analyses that used these updated outcome definitions. 
In addition, we examined changes in measures reported to be affected by pioglitazone, 
including the HOMA-IR index; insulin, glucose, lipid, and C-reactive protein levels; and 
blood pressure. All these measures were listed in the protocol but were not considered to be 
outcome events. P values for safety and ancillary analyses were not adjusted for multiple 
comparisons. We used SAS software, version 9.3, for all analyses, except as noted.
RESULTS
TRIAL POPULATION
A total of 3895 patients were enrolled, with 67% from sites in the United States (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Alleged irregularity in the informed-consent process at one 
institution resulted in halting of local research activities while the data were still blinded. 
The 19 patients at this site were removed from the study, resulting in a final cohort of 3876 
patients (1939 in the pioglitazone group and 1937 in the placebo group).
The two study groups had similar characteristics at baseline (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In the two study groups, the mean age was 63.5 years. The index 
event was stroke in 88% of the patients in the pioglitazone group and 87% in the placebo 
group; the median times from the index event to randomization were 81 days and 79 days, 
respectively, and the median HOMA-IR index values were 4.7 and 4.6, respectively. In the 
two study groups, the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 5.8%. According to the 
2010 criteria of the ADA (which include a glycated hemoglobin level of ≥6.5% as diagnostic 
of diabetes), diabetes was present in 116 of 1939 patients (6.0%) in the pioglitazone group 
and in 129 of 1937 (6.7%) in the placebo group (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
During a median follow-up of 4.8 years, a total of 227 patients (5.9%) withdrew consent and 
99 (2.6%) were lost-to-follow-up (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Baseline 
features were similar for patients who were lost to follow-up in the two groups. Patients in 
the two groups had similar rates of adherence to recommended practices for secondary 
prevention (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Patients in the pioglitazone group had lower adherence to the drug regimen than did those in 
the placebo group (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix); at the exit visit, 60% of the 
patients in the pioglitazone group were still taking pioglitazone and 67% in the placebo 
group were still taking placebo. The reasons for drug discontinuation were similar in the two 
groups, except that more patients in the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group 
stopped because of edema or weight gain (172 patients vs. 51 patients) or were removed for 
safety reasons (primarily heart failure, repeated fracture, and incidence of or risk factors for 
bladder cancer) (146 patients vs. 117 patients). In the pioglitazone group, the median daily 
dose each year ranged from 29 mg to 40 mg.
CLINICAL OUTCOMES
The primary outcome of stroke or myocardial infarction occurred in 175 of 1939 patients 
(9.0%) in the pioglitazone group and in 228 of 1937 (11.8%) in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio in the pioglitazone group, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.93; P = 0.007)

 (Table 2 and Fig. 1, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). This finding did not 
change after adjustment for covariates.
Among the secondary outcomes, the rate of progression to diabetes was significantly lower 
in the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.69; 
P<0.001) (Table 2). Pioglitazone had no significant effect on cognition, as compared with 
placebo. The overall between-group difference in the change from baseline in the least-
squares mean score on the Modified Mini–Mental State Examination was −0.02 (95% CI, 
−0.33 to 0.28; P = 0.88). There were no significant differences in any of the prespecified 
subgroups (Fig. 2).
In ancillary analyses, the effect of pioglitazone on the primary outcome was similar when 
stroke and myocardial infarction were defined according to updated criteria28,29 (hazard 
ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.88). The finding for diabetes was also unchanged when a 
cutoff for glycated hemoglobin of 6.5% or more was used in local analysis, consistent with 
the 2010 ADA recommendation30 (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64).
After 1 year, the HOMA-IR index and C-reactive protein level were lower in the 
pioglitazone group than in the placebo group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
During the trial, levels of fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure 
were also lower in the pioglitazone group, as was diastolic blood pressure in years 1 to 4. 
Levels of both high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol were higher in the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group (Fig. S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
SAFETY OUTCOMES
Patients in the pioglitazone group had more weight gain, edema, shortness of breath, and 
bone fractures than did patients in the placebo group (Table 3, and Table S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The maximum between-group difference in weight change was 
observed at year 4 (mean weight gain of 2.6 kg in the pioglitazone group vs. mean weight 
loss of 0.5 kg in the placebo group, P<0.001). Among the patients in the pioglitazone group, 
52.2% gained more than 4.5 kg and 11.4% gained more than 13.6 kg; the corresponding 
percentages in the placebo group were 33.7% and 4.5%. The rates of edema were higher in 
the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group (35.6% vs. 24.9%, P<0.001), as were rates 
of serious bone fracture (i.e., requiring hospitalization or surgery), which were reported in 
99 patients and 62 patients, respectively (5.1% vs. 3.2%, P=0.003).
Although shortness of breath was reported more frequently in the pioglitazone group than in 
the placebo group, there was no significant between-group difference in the number of 
patients with heart failure (74 in the pioglitazone group and 71 in the placebo group, P = 
0.80) or in the number of patients hospitalized for heart failure (51 and 42, respectively; P = 
0.35) (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Incident bladder cancer occurred in 12 
patients in the pioglitazone group and in 8 in the placebo group (P = 0.37). The total 
incidence of cancer did not differ significantly between the two groups (133 patients and 150 
patients, respectively; P = 0.29). There was no significant between-group difference in the

 incidence of other monitored adverse events, with the exception of a change in the alanine 
aminotransferase level, which was more favorable with pioglitazone.
DISCUSSION
In this trial involving patients without diabetes who had a recent history of ischemic stroke 
or TIA and who had insulin resistance, the rate of the primary outcome was lower among 
patients who received pioglitazone than among those who received placebo. The incidence 
of a new diagnosis of diabetes was also lower with pioglitazone.
The results of the IRIS trial are in contrast to the findings of two trials involving patients 
with type 2 diabetes. In the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events 
(PROactive) trial,15,16 the rate of primary outcome of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
acute coronary syndrome, vascular surgery, or amputation was not significantly lower among 
patients in the pioglitazone group than among those in the placebo group. In the Bypass 
Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI-2D) trial,31 the rate of 
primary outcome of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction was not significantly lower 
among patients receiving rosiglitazone and metformin (insulin-sparing strategy) than among 
those receiving insulin and sulfonylurea therapy (insulin-providing strategy). However, the 
IRIS results are consistent with findings regarding a secondary outcome in the PROactive 
trial (i.e., that the rates of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were significantly lower 
with pioglitazone than with placebo) and with findings of trials showing a favorable effect of 
pioglitazone on the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis among patients with and those 
without diabetes.32–34
In our trial, the mechanism that is responsible for the lower rates of stroke and myocardial 
infarction in the pioglitazone group than in the placebo group is uncertain. Pioglitazone 
activates PPAR-γ and also causes partial activation of PPAR-α.35 These actions modulate the 
transcription of genes with favorable effects on insulin sensitivity,13,36 fat distribution,37 
plasma glucose,35,38 lipid and protein metabolism,36,38 vascular endothelial function,39 and 
inflammation.35,40 In the IRIS trial, pioglitazone improved insulin sensitivity, blood 
pressure, and circulating levels of glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and C-reactive 
protein. The enhancement of insulin sensitivity may be central to the benefit of pioglitazone. 
However, other measured and unmeasured effects may have contributed to the benefit of the 
drug with respect to our primary outcome.
We observed previously recognized adverse effects of pioglitazone on weight gain, edema, 
and bone fracture. Weight gain with PPAR-γ agonists, such as pioglitazone, reflects an 
increase in adipose tissue mass and a tendency for fluid accumulation owing to renal sodium 
retention.41 Sodium retention, if unchecked, can also increase the risk of heart failure.42 
However, in the IRIS trial, we did not observe a greater incidence of heart failure in the 
pioglitazone group than in the placebo group, which was probably because we excluded 
patients with a history of heart failure and used safety algorithms that triggered dose 
reduction for excessive weight gain or edema. Pioglitazone has been associated with an 
increased risk of bone fracture.43 The mechanism is uncertain, and studies have not shown a 
consistent effect of the drug on bone density.44,45

 Observational research conducted in 2011 and 2012 suggested that pioglitazone may 
increase the risk of bladder cancer.46,47 However, more recent studies48,49 showed no 
significant association for any dose or duration of therapy.49 Other research suggests that 
PPAR-γ agonists might prevent certain cancers.50,51 Although we did not observe a 
significant effect of treatment on the incidence of total or any specific cancer, our study was 
not powered to address these questions.
The patients in our study were classified as having insulin resistance on the basis of the 
HOMA-IR index. We selected this measurement because it is easy to perform and is closely 
correlated with more definitive but complex tests.20,52 However, a component of the 
HOMA-IR index is the plasma insulin level, which is not globally standardized. To account 
for this, all HOMA-IR testing in the IRIS trial was performed in central laboratories. To 
replicate IRIS eligibility criteria, laboratories would need either to adopt the IRIS assays or 
to calibrate their own results to the IRIS assays.
In conclusion, we found that pioglitazone, a therapy directed at improving insulin sensitivity, 
can prevent cardiovascular events among patients who have insulin resistance along with 
cerebrovascular disease. The findings suggest that the administration of pioglitazone in 100 
patients similar to those in our trial for about 5 years could prevent 3 patients from having a 
stroke or myocardial infarction. However, during the same period, the treatment would be 
expected to result in bone fractures requiring surgery or hospitalization in 2 patients. It 
seems reasonable to consider individual treatment preference and risk of drug-related 
adverse events in addition to potential benefits when making patient-specific decisions 
regarding therapy.

 Figure 1. Primary Outcome
By 5 years, the primary outcome (fatal or nonfatal stroke or fatal or nonfatal myocardial 
infarction) had occurred in 175 of 1939 patients (9.0%) in the pioglitazone group and in 228 
of 1937 (11.8%) in the placebo group. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis. 
The numbers at risk were the numbers of patients who were alive without an event and still 
being followed at the beginning of each time point.

 Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Outcome
Shown is the relative benefit of pioglitazone as compared with placebo in 13 subgroups that 
were examined for their interaction with the treatment. P values have not been adjusted for 
multiple comparisons. (P = 0.94 after adjustment for multiple comparisons in each 
subgroup.) The size of the squares corresponds to the number of patients in each subgroup. 
The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in 
meters. To convert the values for cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.02586. To 
convert the values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. To convert the

*Hazard ratios were calculated by means of a Cox regression model with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The confidence interval for the 
primary outcome was adjusted for interim monitoring; confidence intervals for the secondary outcomes were adjusted for multiple comparisons.
†The P value for the primary outcome was adjusted for interim monitoring. P values for the five secondary outcomes were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons by the Hochberg procedure using an overall familywise type I error of 5%.
‡Only the first event, stroke or myocardial infarction, was counted for each patient.
§In the composite categories, only the first event was counted for each patient (e.g., a patient with myocardial infarction followed by unstable 
angina would be counted only as having a myocardial infarction in the category for acute coronary syndrome). More strokes are listed as occurring 
as a secondary outcome than a primary outcome because the secondary outcome included strokes occurring after myocardial infarction.
¶Serious heart failure was defined as an episode resulting in hospitalization or death.
