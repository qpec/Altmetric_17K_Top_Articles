Introduction 
 
For decades, the consumption of long-chain saturated 
fatty acids (SAFA; containing 12–18 carbon atoms) was 
thought to undermine cardiovascular health. However, 
recent meta-analyses of prospective observational studies 
 
[1, 2] 
 reported that SAFA intake was associated with nei-
ther coronary heart disease (CHD) nor stroke mortality 
nor myocardial infarction. Instead, reduced SAFA intake 
that was replaced by  
cis 
-polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(PUFA) was associated with a 17% lower risk of cardio-
vascular events  
[3] 
, which was confirmed by randomized 
controlled trials  
[4, 5] 
. Under isoenergetic conditions, the 
lack of association of SAFA per se with CHD risk could 
imply that the potential contribution of dietary SAFA is 
comparable to that of all other macronutrients together. 
On the other hand, SAFA consumption significantly in-
creases the plasma concentration of low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with mixed carbohy-
drates and  
cis 
-unsaturated fatty acids  
[6] 
, potentially in-
creasing the risk of CHD  
[7] 
.
 
The contrasting findings have challenged current 
SAFA recommendations, generated vigorous debate, and

Abstract 
 
At a workshop to update the science linking saturated fatty 
acid (SAFA) consumption with the risk of coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) and ischemic stroke, invited participants present-
ed data on the consumption and bioavailability of SAFA and 
their functions in the body and food technology. Epidemio-
logical methods and outcomes were related to the associa-
tion between SAFA consumption and disease events and 
mortality. Participants reviewed the effects of SAFA on CHD, 
causal risk factors, and surrogate risk markers. Higher intakes 
of SAFA were not associated with higher risks of CHD or stroke 
apparently, but studies did not take macronutrient replace-
ment into account. Replacing SAFA by  
cis 
-polyunsaturated 
fatty acids was associated with significant CHD risk reduction, 
which was confirmed by randomized controlled trials. SAFA 
reduction had little direct effect on stroke risk. Cohort studies 
suggest that the food matrix and source of SAFA have impor-
tant health effects.

led to consumer confusion  
[8, 9] 
. Therefore, to update 
and discuss the science linking SAFA consumption to the 
risk of CHD and ischemic stroke, 20 international experts 
on dietary fat and health convened in Leiden, The 
 
Netherlands, November 5–6, 2015, as guests of the 
 
International Expert Movement to Improve Dietary Fat 
Quality (www.theiem.org), The Netherlands Oils and 
Fats Industry (www.mvo.nl) and the European Palm Oil 
Alliance (www.palmoilandfood.eu). This updated report 
describes the meeting’
s highlights.
 
SAFA Background 
 
SAFA intake is inevitable as these fatty acids occur in 
all fat-containing foods, for example, dairy products, but-
ter, meats, and some vegetable fats and oils  
[10] 
. Most 
dietary SAFA have 12–18 carbon atoms, with foods vary-
ing in the relative amounts of individual SAFA. Palmitic 
(C16) and stearic acids (C18) are predominant in butter, 
dairy and meat products; lauric (C12) and myristic (C14) 
acids in butter, dairy foods, coconut, and palm kernel oils 
 
[11] 
. In many Western countries, in particular, SAFA in-
takes exceed 10%E  
[10, 12] 
.
 
 
In animal fats, SAFA are mainly located at the  
sn 
-2 
 
position of the glycerol backbone, whereas they are usu-
ally located at the  
sn 
-1 and -3 positions in vegetable fats 
and oils  
[13] 
. These structural differences imply impor-
tant physical, metabolic, and functional distinctions, 
which can be removed by the technique of fatty acid ran-
domization  
[14] 
.
 
Coconut oil contains >80% SAFA. A common mis-
conception is that the medium-chain SAFA in coconut oil 
are metabolized differently from long-chain SAFA 
( 
≥ 
C12). However, coconut oil contains approximately 
50% lauric acid and 15% myristic acid, both of which have 
potent LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C)-raising effects  
[6] 
. The popular belief that coco-
nut oil is healthy is not supported by scientific data  
[15] 
.
 
 
SAFA have distinct metabolic functions, including 
protein acylation  
[16] 
. This widely occurring mechanism 
controls the function of diverse proteins and physiologi-
cal processes. Palmitate and myristate are involved in 
 
G-protein activation and consequently in signal trans-
duction  
[17] 
. Myristoylation may be involved in the syn-
thesis of ceramide and consequently in sphingolipid me-
tabolism and function  
[18] 
. In addition, by stimulating 
fatty acid desaturation, myristic acid may increase the 
conversion of essential fatty acids to their functional 
long-chain polyunsaturated derivatives  
[19] 
. Despite 
these important functions, SAFA are not essential fatty 
acids because they can be synthesized de novo.
 
 
SAFA-rich triglycerides (TG) confer several function-
al qualities to foods, including structure, plasticity, and 
organoleptic characteristics, such as creaminess and fla-
vor. These qualities enhance food palatability, stability, 
and structure and are difficult to replace without losing 
important food characteristics  
[20] 
. Many of the func-
tional qualities of SAFA depend on the underlying, space-
filling, fat crystal network that generates macroscopic 
hardness and stabilizes the oil/water interface  
[21] 
. 
 
Differences in the fatty acid composition of the TG, for 
example, chain length and saturation, affect product 
hardness  
[22] 
. For many applications, a SAFA-rich frac-
tion of palm oil (palm stearin) is suitable  
[23] 
. Full hydro-
genation of vegetable oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids 
is another option, but conflicts with consumers’
 demand 
for minimal processing. Whether this demand can pos-
sibly be met by conventional selective plant breeding de-
serves study.
 
 
Risk Factors for CHD and Ischemic Stroke 
 
Clinicians assess several characteristics to determine 
an individual’
s risk of CHD. Those causally related to the 
risk of CHD are known as risk factors. Changes in a risk 
factor change CHD risk in a predictable way. Established 
and modifiable risk factors for CHD include elevated 
LDL-C, high blood pressure (BP), overweight and  
obesity, 
and smoking  
[24] 
. Additional risk factors have been sug-
gested, for example, TG and C-reactive protein, but 
whether they are causally related to CHD is not agreed. 
Mendelian randomization studies may be useful for es-
tablishing causality  
[25] 
.
 
Substantial evidence implicates LDL-C as a causal 
 
factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD events 
 
[7] 
, and randomized controlled trials with LDL-lowering 
interventions  
[26] support a causal relationship between 
LDL-C and CHD. However, LDL-C is just one causal risk 
factor; consequently, many CVD patients can have LDL-
C levels in the optimal range. Although observational 
studies often fail to demonstrate significant correlations 
between SAFA consumption and LDL-C levels, these do 
not necessarily exclude a causal relationship  
[27] 
. Thus, 
control of LDL-C remains a cornerstone of CHD risk 
management  
[28] 
.
 
Plasma LDL-C includes the cholesterol in all LDL par-
ticles (LDL-P), which exist along a continuum of sizes 
and densities  
[29] 
. Small, dense LDL-P (sdLDL) contain

28
less cholesterol per particle, but are more strongly associ-
ated with increased CHD risk than larger, more buoyant 
particles  
[30] 
. Thus, the measurement of LDL-P might 
improve the predictability of CHD risk compared with 
LDL-C, particularly when LDL-C is not elevated  
[31] 
.
 
The size distribution of LDL-P is affected by the con-
sumption of excess energy and the macronutrient com-
position of the diet  
[32, 33] 
. Higher intake of SAFA was 
associated with increases in larger, more buoyant LDL-P 
 
[34] 
. In the context of the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension diet  
[35] 
, higher compared with lower 
(14%E vs. 8%E) dietary SAFA was associated with im-
proved lipid profiles and lower BP  
[36] 
 when SAFA re-
placed carbohydrates. Although the cholesterol content 
of sdLDL is useful, the overall plasma concentration of 
these particles may be more informative  
[37] 
.
 
 
There is compelling evidence that individuals with 
lower HDL-C face a significantly higher risk of CHD  
[38] 
, 
but paradoxically, higher levels are not always associated 
with lower CHD risk  
[39] 
. The Emerging Risk Factor 
 
Collaboration showed that the inverse relationship be-
tween HDL and CHD risk holds only for lower HDL con-
centrations and does not apply at higher levels. HDL is 
widely thought to be involved in “reverse cholesterol 
transport”  
[40] 
, a hypothesis that has been seriously chal-
lenged  
[41] 
. Doubts about the “HDL hypothesis” and the 
causal involvement of HDL-C in CHD risk were strength-
ened by Mendelian randomization studies in individuals 
with genetically linked elevated HDL-C whose risk of 
myocardial infarction was not different from those lack-
ing the variant gene  
[41, 42] 
. Furthermore, trials with 
substances increasing HDL-C levels failed to reduce car-
diovascular events or increased them and mortality  
[43] 
. 
However, these trials were performed in patients at high 
risk of CHD, whose HDL may have lost its putative car-
dioprotective function  
[44, 45] 
. These findings favored 
the view that HDL functions beyond cholesterol efflux 
may be more important for cardiovascular protection 
than absolute HDL levels  
[46] 
.
 
 
The third commonly assessed lipid marker of CHD 
risk is plasma TG, chauffeured in particles of chylomi-
crons and their remnants, very low- and intermediate-
density lipoproteins  
[46, 47] 
. Many studies reported sig-
nificant associations between fasting and nonfasting TG 
concentrations and risk of CHD  
[48, 49] 
, but there is dis-
agreement whether TG-rich lipoproteins constitute an 
independent causal risk factor  
[49, 50] 
. The difficulty in 
establishing causality relates to the close relationship be-
tween TG and remnant cholesterol, and the inverse rela-
tionship between TG and HDL-C concentrations in plas-
ma, both of which are significantly associated with the 
risk of ischemic heart disease, but in opposite directions 
 
[51] 
. In addition, these relationships are confounded by 
lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, alcohol con-
sumption, higher body mass index, diabetes, and by re-
verse causation  
[52, 53] 
. Because most cells can degrade 
TG, but not cholesterol, it is likely that the atherogenic 
part of TG-rich lipoproteins is cholesterol, not the TG 
 
itself. This implies that the plasma TG level could be a risk 
marker rather than a causal factor.
 
TG-rich lipoproteins carry 2 specific apolipoproteins 
on their surface, apolipoprotein A-V and apolipoprotein 
C-III, encoded by the genes  
APOA5  
and  
APOC3  
, respec-
tively.  
APOA5  
activity lowers circulating levels of TG-
rich lipoproteins and is associated with decreased risk of 
CHD  
[54, 55] 
. In contrast,  
APOC3  
activity mediates high-
er levels of TG-rich lipoproteins and some of its gene 
polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of 
CHD  
[56] 
. Certain variants of the  
APOA5  
gene diminish 
apolipoprotein A-V function, which leads to increased 
TG levels and increased risk of CHD  
[54] 
. Individuals 
with certain loss-of-function mutations in the  
APOC3 
gene had lower TG levels and a lower risk of CHD com-
pared with non-carriers  
[57] 
. Thus, data in individuals 
with specific gene variants lead either to elevated or re-
duced TG or TG-rich lipoprotein levels, supporting a 
causal association between TG, remnant cholesterol, and 
risk of CHD. Unfortunately, there are no large random-
ized clinical trials that could verify this hypothesis.
 
A clutch of hemostatic factors and inflammatory me-
diators  
[58, 59] 
, as well as elevated BP  
[60] and disturbed 
endothelial cell function  
[61] 
, is also associated with CHD 
risk. Fibrinogen, a positive acute phase protein essential 
for clot formation, has a long and consistent association 
with CHD risk  
[62] 
. Its association with CHD might re-
flect its responsiveness to inflammation  
[58, 59] 
, but clot 
formation and the presence of fibrin in atherosclerotic 
plaque suggest a more direct influence on CHD risk  
[63, 
64] 
. Still, a multiethnic meta-analysis of genome-wide as-
sociation studies reported no strong evidence of a causal 
relationship between fibrinogen and coronary artery dis-
ease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism  
[65] 
. Evidence 
that factor VII, also essential for clot formation, is associ-
ated with CHD is inconsistent  
[66, 67] 
. Other hemostatic 
factors, such as von Willebrand factor, fibrin D-dimer, 
and tissue plasminogen activator antigen, appear to be 
modestly associated with first-ever CHD  
[59, 68] 
. Several 
hemostatic factors associated with CHD are also associ-
ated with inflammatory markers, which may confound 
CHD risk analyses  
[69] 
.

SAFA Consumption and Heart Health 
 
Although higher SAFA intake might increase CHD 
risk by increasing plasma LDL-C  
[70] 
, recent meta-anal-
yses of prospective observational studies  
[1, 71, 72] re-
ported that when compensating nutrients were not taken 
into account, SAFA intake was not associated with CHD 
or stroke mortality, all-cause mortality, or myocardial in-
farction. Two large, independent, prospective cohorts of 
US men and women confirmed this result  
[73] 
1 
. In a pro-
spective Dutch cohort, higher total SAFA consumption 
was related to lower risk of ischemic heart disease, but not 
to CHD risk  
[74] 
. In another Dutch cohort, a positive as-
sociation was observed between CHD risk and palmitic 
acid, but not total SAFA intake  
[75] 
.
 
 
Several experimental conditions and methodological 
shortcomings could have obscured a potential relation-
ship between SAFA intake and CHD risk. These include 
limited range of SAFA intakes within cohorts, possible 
heterogeneity in the health effects of different fatty acids, 
and large measurement errors in estimating dietary SAFA 
intake, without the ability to discriminate among indi-
vidual fatty acids  
[76] 
. The balance among different fatty 
acids within the fatty acid class may be important  
[77] 
, as 
might the food sources of SAFA. Biomarker studies have 
reported positive associations for CHD between blood 
levels of even-chain SAFA and inverse associations with 
odd-chain SAFA, which reflect different food sources 
 
[77] 
.
 
Observational  
[3, 73] 
 and intervention studies  
[5] have 
shown clearly that the partial replacement of dietary 
SAFA with  
cis 
-PUFA is associated with significantly re-
duced CHD risk and mortality. A recent review and meta-
analysis  
[6] of intervention studies concluded that lower-
ing SAFA intake significantly reduced the risk of com-
bined cardiovascular events, but not mortality. In 
subgroup analyses, only the partial replacement of SAFA 
by PUFA reduced CHD events significantly, but replace-
ment with  
cis 
-monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), car-
bohydrate, or protein had no significant effect. Another 
review of observational and intervention studies of par-
tially replacing SAFA with PUFA found convincing evi-
dence of lower blood LDL-C levels and a reduced risk of 
CVD, especially in men  
[78] 
.
 
According to a meta-analysis of 84 controlled trials 
 
[6] 
, isocaloric replacement of mixed carbohydrates by a 
common dietary SAFA mixture markedly increased plas-
ma LDL-C and apoB concentrations, indicating an in-
crease in LDL-P number. In addition, levels of HDL-C 
and apo A-I increased and plasma TG decreased. 
 
Isocaloric replacement of carbohydrate by SAFA did not 
significantly affect the plasma total-C to HDL-C ratio. 
Data on the effect of SAFA on LDL-P composition and 
size are scarce, but suggest that higher SAFA consump-
tion mainly increases the larger, more buoyant, less ath-
erogenic LDL-P  
[32, 33, 79] 
.
 
Compared with carbohydrates, lauric, myristic, and 
palmitic acids differently increase LDL-C and HDL-C 
levels and decrease TG concentrations, while stearic acid 
does not affect these lipoproteins  
[6] 
. Myristic acid has 
the strongest effect, but because of its much higher intake, 
palmitic acid has the greatest overall effect on plasma 
 
lipoprotein levels. The different effects of individual 
SAFA explain why dietary fats with different fatty acid 
compositions vary in their potency to alter lipid and lipo-
protein levels.
 
 
Specific food sources of SAFA and other macronutri-
ents appear related to CHD risk as suggested by the 
 
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)  
[80] and 
a meta-analysis of milk and dairy consumption  
[81] 
. In a 
meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials  
[82] 
, 
cheese compared with butter intake was associated with 
significant reductions in LDL-C and HDL-C, but had no 
effect on TG. In the 10-year MESA study, a higher intake 
of meat-delivered SAFA was associated with greater CVD 
risk, whereas dairy SAFA was related to lower CVD risk 
 
[80] 
. The investigators estimated that the isocaloric re-
placement of 2%E from meat SAFA with dairy SAFA was 
significantly associated with a 25% lower risk of CVD. As 
the food matrix may also influence the kinetics of SAFA 
absorption  
[83] 
, these results indicate that total foods are 
more important in terms of CHD risks than the SAFA 
they contain.
 
 
As reviewed some time ago  
[84] 
, the consumption of 
dietary fat significantly increased the postprandial 
amounts, activation, and activity of plasma clotting factor 
VII, which seemed to be associated with the degree of li-
pemia. Interestingly, the effects of SAFA-rich fats were 
less pronounced than those of fats rich in MUFA, and 
were further reduced by fatty acid randomization.
 
Up-to-date comprehensive reviews covering the ef-
fects of dietary fats on platelet function and thrombosis 
are lacking. Systematic studies with a well-validated rat 
model of arterial thrombosis revealed that, compared to 
unsaturated fatty acids, dietary SAFA (but not stearic 
acid) promote an arterial thrombosis tendency  
[85] 
. Ef-

  While this paper was in revision, re-analyses of these cohorts were unable 
to verify this finding. In contrast, a positive association between SAFA intake 
and CHD risk was observed  
[98] 
.

fects of dietary SAFA on human platelet thrombotic func-
tions have been studied repeatedly with inconsistent re-
sults  
[86] 
. An FAO/WHO review concluded that dietary 
SAFA possibly raises BP compared to unsaturated fatty 
acids  
[70] 
. The evidence for different effects of SAFA on 
flow-mediated dilatation, inflammation, and insulin sen-
sitivity was considered unconvincing.
 
SAFA Intake and Ischemic Stroke 
 
The cardinal risk factor for stroke is elevated BP. 
 
Furthermore, high BP is strongly and progressively asso-
ciated with risk of CHD, heart failure, peripheral vascular 
disease, and other serious health conditions  
[87, 88] 
. The 
Prospective Studies Collaboration, a meta-analysis of data 
from 61 prospective studies in individuals aged 40–69 
years, reported that each 20 mm of mercury increase in 
systolic BP above usual was associated with a more than 
2-fold difference in stroke mortality and a 2-fold differ-
ence in CHD mortality  
[89] 
. A meta-analysis of 11 clinical 
trials of BP-lowering drugs showed that regardless of 
baseline cardiovascular risk, lowering the BP reduced the 
risk of cardiovascular events in all risk groups  
[87] 
. Over-
all, these data and many other studies support a causal 
relationship between BP and risk of CHD and stroke.
 
 
Compared with studies on CHD risk, fewer data link 
SAFA intakes to the risk of ischemic stroke. Moreover, 
the results of meta-analyses are inconsistent. When re-
placement nutrients were not considered, dietary SAFA 
were not significantly associated with the risk of ischemic 
stroke  
[1] or mixed types of stroke  
[2] 
. In a recent meta-
analysis, higher SAFA intakes appeared associated with 
lower risks of both stroke types  
[90] 
. However, significant 
effects were limited to males, East Asians, participants 
with lower body mass index, and studies of high quality 
and long follow-up. A meta-analysis of 7 intervention 
studies concluded that SAFA reduction had no clear ef-
fect on any type of stroke  
[4] 
. Although partial replace-
ment of SAFA by PUFA reduced stroke risk in this study 
by 32%, with only 4 studies and 41 stroke cases, this effect 
was not significant.
 
 
As dairy products are a major source of dietary SAFA, 
it is notable that a study of 3 large prospective studies re-
ported that dairy fat intake was not significantly related 
to the risk of stroke risk  
[91] 
. In 2 large prospective co-
horts, circulating biomarkers of dairy fat intake were not 
significantly associated with the risk of any type of inci-
dent stroke  
[92] 
. Replacement of 5%E from dairy fat with 
PUFA was associated with a significant 21% lower risk of 
stroke, whereas replacement with animal fat other than 
dairy increased stroke risk by 6%.
 
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 
prospective cohort studies of dairy intake and risk of 
CVD, CHD, and stroke reported significant inverse rela-
tive risks for intakes of total dairy, cheese, and calcium 
from dairy foods and total stroke, but dose–response as-
sociations did not hold after adjustment for within-study 
covariance  
[93] 
. Another meta-analysis of prospective 
studies reported a significant inverse association between 
stroke and low-fat dairy and cheese consumption  
[94] 
. 
The investigators noted heterogeneity and publication 
bias in the studies on stroke.
 
 
Thus, the available evidence suggests that SAFA re-
duction has little, if any, direct effect on stroke risk, but 
that the consumption of SAFA-rich dairy foods may be 
associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke. This topic 
deserves more thorough investigation  
[4] 
.
 
 
Dietary Guidelines for SAFA 
 
Dietary guidelines now focus on foods and dietary pat-
terns to improve consumer understanding of more 
healthful food choices and to acknowledge food matrix 
and nutrient interactions. Examples include the Nordic 
Nutrition Recommendations  
[95] 
, 2015–2020 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans  
[96], and 2015 Dutch food-
based dietary guidelines  
[97] 
. There is now convincing 
evidence that the partial replacement of SAFA-rich foods 
with those rich in  
cis 
-PUFA is associated with a signifi-
cant reduction in CHD risk. Specific SAFA-rich foods 
such as dairy products may also be associated with lower 
CHD risk. Identifying healthy food choices to replace 
specific, less healthy ones, as in several updated dietary 
guidelines, may facilitate dietary modifications that lower 
the risk of CHD.
 
Summary and Conclusions 
 
SAFA have important metabolic functions, but their 
consumption is not essential because they can be synthe-
sized de novo. However, their functional properties make 
them virtually indispensable for the production of fat-
containing foods. Dietary SAFA, when compared to 
 
carbohydrates and  
cis 
-unsaturated fatty acids, raise plas-
ma LDL-C, a causal risk factor for CHD. Individual SAFA 
affect plasma lipoprotein levels differently, with each ma-
jor dietary SAFA except stearic acid resulting in higher

31
levels of LDL- and HDL-C and lower levels of TG. In pro-
spective observational studies and randomized controlled 
trials, higher total SAFA intakes were not associated with 
higher incident CHD events or mortality, but replace-
ment nutrients were not taken into account. The effect of 
reducing dietary SAFA is most strongly affected by the 
macronutrients that replace them. The greatest reduction 
in CHD risk occurs when  
cis 
-PUFA replace dietary SAFA. 
In intervention studies replacement of 10%E from SAFA 
by  
cis 
-PUFA reduced CVD events by 27%  
[4] 
 and the re-
placement of 5%E from SAFA by  
cis 
-PUFA decreased 
CHD risk by 10%  
[5] 
. Data are insufficient to confirm a 
significant benefit for CHD risk by substituting  
cis 
- 
MUFA for SAFA. Emerging evidence suggests that the 
food matrix may modify the risk of CHD associated with 
some SAFA-rich foods. The consumption of several dairy 
foods has been associated with a lower risk of CVD, but 
data are insufficient to justify dietary recommendations.
 
HDL-C levels are inversely related to CHD risk in 
healthy populations, but causality is presently doubted. 
Therefore, the clinical interpretation of the increased 
HDL-C associated with SAFA consumption is uncertain 
and warrants further research. Increasing evidence sug-
gests that TG-rich lipoproteins may be a causal risk factor 
for CHD and stroke.
 
Other markers for CHD risk, such as LDL particle size 
and several hemostatic, thrombotic, and inflammatory 
factors lack a confirmed causal relationship to CHD risk. 
Consistent evidence for specific effects of SAFA on any of 
these markers has not been reported.
 
Studies on SAFA intakes and risk of ischemic stroke 
are inconsistent. Compared with the abundant data on 
SAFA consumption and risk of CHD, there is insufficient 
evidence to support dietary SAFA recommendations to 
reduce stroke risk.
 
In conclusion, strong evidence supports the partial re-
placement of SAFA-rich foods with those rich in  
cis 
- 
PUFA to lower LDL-C and reduce CHD risk.
