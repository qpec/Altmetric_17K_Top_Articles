BACKGROUND
The cardiovascular effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, when 
added to standard care in patients with type 2 diabetes, remains unknown.
METHODS
In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and high 
cardiovascular risk to receive liraglutide or placebo. The primary composite outcome 
in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular 
causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was 
that liraglutide would be noninferior to placebo with regard to the primary outcome, 
with a margin of 1.30 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the 
hazard ratio. No adjustments for multiplicity were performed for the prespecified ex-
ploratory outcomes.
RESULTS
A total of 9340 patients underwent randomization. The median follow-up was 3.8 years. 
The primary outcome occurred in significantly fewer patients in the liraglutide group 
(608 of 4668 patients [13.0%]) than in the placebo group (694 of 4672 [14.9%]) (hazard 
ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P 
= 
0.01 
for superiority). Fewer patients died from cardiovascular causes in the liraglutide group 
(219 patients [4.7%]) than in the placebo group (278 [6.0%]) (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% 
CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P 
= 
0.007). The rate of death from any cause was lower in the liraglutide 
group (381 patients [8.2%]) than in the placebo group (447 [9.6%]) (hazard ratio, 0.85; 
95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02). The rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal 
stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure were nonsignificantly lower in the liraglu-
tide group than in the placebo group. The most common adverse events leading to the 
discontinuation of liraglutide were gastrointestinal events. The incidence of pancreatitis 
was nonsignificantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS
In the time-to-event analysis, the rate of the first occurrence of death from cardiovas-
cular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus was lower with liraglutide than with placebo. (Funded by Novo

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
ype 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic 
disorder that is characterized by hypergly-
cemia and associated with a high risk of 
cardiovascular, microvascular, and other compli-
cations.1,2 Although glycemic control is associ-
ated with reductions in the risk of microvascular 
complications, the macrovascular benefits of 
glycemic control are less certain. Furthermore, 
concern has been raised about the cardiovascu-
lar safety of antihyperglycemic therapies.3 Con-
sequently, regulatory authorities have mandated 
cardiovascular safety assessments of new diabe-
tes treatments.4,5
Liraglutide, an analogue of human glucagon-
like peptide 1 (GLP-1),6 has been approved for 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Its efficacy in 
lowering glucose levels has been established, and 
it has been associated with slight reductions in 
weight and blood pressure.6-8 It has been associ-
ated with an increase in pulse rate.7,8 To assess 
the long-term effects of liraglutide on cardiovas-
cular outcomes and other clinically important 
events, the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Dia-
betes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome 
Results (LEADER) trial was initiated in 2010.9
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We performed this multicenter, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial at 410 sites in 32 coun-
tries. Detailed methods of the trial have been 
published previously,9 and the trial protocol is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. The trial protocol was reviewed and 
approved by the institutional review board or 
ethics committee at each participating center. 
All the patients provided written informed con-
sent before participation. Patients with type 2 dia-
betes who were at high risk for cardiovascular 
disease were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to receive liraglutide or placebo. The minimum 
planned follow-up was 42 months, with a maxi-
mum of 60 months of receiving the assigned 
regimen and an additional 30 days of follow-up 
afterward.
The trial was overseen by a steering commit-
tee consisting of 11 academic investigators and 
4 employees of the sponsor. The steering com-
mittee, in collaboration with the sponsor and 
regulatory authorities, was responsible for de-
signing the trial protocol. An independent data 
and safety monitoring committee performed on-
going safety surveillance and had access to all 
the data in an unblinded fashion. The protocol 
for the treatment of risk factors and the con-
comitant use of medications was developed by a 
global expert panel (Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The data 
were gathered by the site investigators, and the 
sponsor performed site monitoring and data col-
lection. The data were analyzed by Statogen 
Consulting and the sponsor.
All the authors had access to the final results 
and vouch for the fidelity of the trial to the pro-
tocol. The first and last authors wrote the first 
draft of the manuscript, which was revised and 
approved by all the authors, who also assume 
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness 
of its content and for the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. Editorial support, 
funded by the sponsor, was provided by an inde-
pendent medical writer under the guidance of 
the authors.
Patients
Patients with type 2 diabetes who had a glycated 
hemoglobin level of 7.0% or more were eligible 
if they either had not received drugs for this 
condition previously or had been treated with 
one or more oral antihyperglycemic agents or 
insulin (human neutral protamine Hagedorn, 
long-acting analogue, or premixed) or a combi-
nation of these agents. The major inclusion cri-
teria were the following: an age of 50 years or 
more with at least one cardiovascular coexisting 
condition (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascu-
lar disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic 
kidney disease of stage 3 or greater, or chronic 
heart failure of New York Heart Association 
class II or III) or an age of 60 years or more with 
at least one cardiovascular risk factor, as deter-
mined by the investigator (microalbuminuria or 
proteinuria, hypertension and left ventricular 
hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic or diastolic 
dysfunction, or an ankle–brachial index [the ratio 
of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the 
systolic blood pressure in the arm] of less than 
0.9).9 Major exclusion criteria were type 1 diabe-
tes; the use of GLP-1–receptor agonists, dipepti-
dyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, pramlintide, 
or rapid-acting insulin; a familial or personal 
history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or 
medullary thyroid cancer; and the occurrence of

Liraglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event with-
in 14 days before screening and randomization. 
The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
listed in the Supplementary Appendix.
Procedures
After a 2-week placebo run-in phase to establish 
whether patients were able to adhere to the injec-
tion regimen, patients were randomly assigned, 
in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 1.8 mg (or the 
maximum tolerated dose) of liraglutide or match-
ing placebo once daily as a subcutaneous injec-
tion in addition to standard care (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Randomization was 
stratified according to the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) at screening (<30 or ≥30 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area), as 
calculated with the use of the Modification of 
Diet in Renal Disease equation. For patients who 
did not meet the recommended target for glyce-
mic control (glycated hemoglobin level ≤7% or 
individualized target at the investigator’s discre-
tion) after randomization, the addition of any 
antihyperglycemic agents except for GLP-1–recep-
tor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or pramlintide was 
permitted. Patients were scheduled for follow-up 
visits at months 1, 3, and 6 and every 6 months 
thereafter.
Outcomes
The primary composite outcome in the time-to-
event analysis was the first occurrence of death 
from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal (including 
silent) myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. 
Prespecified exploratory outcomes included an 
expanded composite cardiovascular outcome 
(death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary re-
vascularization, or hospitalization for unstable 
angina pectoris or heart failure), death from any 
cause, a composite renal and retinal microvascu-
lar outcome (nephropathy [defined as the new 
onset of macroalbuminuria or a doubling of the 
serum creatinine level and an eGFR of ≤45 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2, the need for continuous 
renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal 
disease] and retinopathy [defined as the need for 
retinal photocoagulation or treatment with intra-
vitreal agents, vitreous hemorrhage, or the onset 
of diabetes-related blindness]), neoplasms, and 
pancreatitis — all of which were adjudicated in 
a blinded fashion by an external, independent 
event-adjudication committee. The definitions 
that were used for the clinical events and the 
members of the committee are listed in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
The glycated hemoglobin level was measured 
at randomization, at month 3, and then every 
6 months thereafter. Other laboratory tests were 
performed at randomization, at months 6 and 12, 
and annually thereafter. Prespecified comparisons 
between groups were performed at 36 months, 
which was the last annual visit with laboratory 
testing that was prespecified for the entire trial 
population, given the minimum follow-up of 
42 months.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available with the 
protocol at NEJM.org. We based the required 
sample size for the trial on an assumed annual 
primary-event rate of 1.8% in each group. Uni-
form enrollment was projected over the period 
of 1.5 years. Assuming a withdrawal rate of less 
than 10%, a minimum exposure to the trial 
regimen of 42 months, a null hypothesis hazard 
ratio of 1.30 or more, 90% power, and a one-
sided alpha level of 0.025, we calculated that 
8754 patients would need to undergo random-
ization if we were to observe at least 611 primary 
outcomes.
The primary and exploratory analyses for the 
outcomes in the time-to-event analyses were 
based on a Cox proportional-hazards model 
with treatment as a covariate. The primary hy-
pothesis was that liraglutide would be noninfe-
rior to placebo with regard to the primary out-
come, with a margin of 1.30 for the upper 
boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the 
hazard ratio. We used a hierarchical testing 
strategy for the liraglutide group versus the pla-
cebo group, first testing for noninferiority and 
subsequently for superiority. Noninferiority was 
established for the primary outcome if the upper 
limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval 
of the hazard ratio was less than 1.30, and supe-
riority was established if the upper limit was less 
than 1.00. In addition, prespecified sensitivity 
analyses were conducted (see the protocol). For 
exploratory outcomes, no adjustments of P values 
for multiplicity were performed. All the patients 
who underwent randomization were included in 
the primary and exploratory analyses, and data 
from the patients who completed or discontin-

censored from the day of their last visit; events 
occurring after that visit were not included. Two-
sided P values are presented throughout. We es-
timated the mean differences between the trial 
groups in the glycated hemoglobin level, weight, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse 
using a mixed model for repeated measure-
ments, with adjustment for baseline covariates.
Results
Overview of Trial Conduct
A total of 9340 patients underwent randomiza-
tion from September 2010 through April 2012; 
4668 patients were randomly assigned to receive 
liraglutide and 4672 to receive placebo. The 
planned closeout of follow-up of the patients 
was from August 2014 through December 2015. 
The vital status was known in 99.7% of the pa-
tients. A total of 96.8% of the patients com-
pleted a final visit, died, or had a primary out-
come. The median time of exposure to liraglutide 
or placebo was 3.5 years. The mean percentage 
of time that patients received the trial regimen 
was 84% for liraglutide and 83% for placebo. 
The median follow-up was 3.8 years in each 
group. The median daily dose of liraglutide was 
1.78 mg (interquartile range, 1.54 to 1.79), in-
cluding periods during which the patients did 
not receive liraglutide. The screening, random-
ization, and follow-up of the patients are shown 
in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The demographic and clinical characteristics 
of the patients were similar in the two groups 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of 
the 9340 patients, the majority (7598 [81.3%]) had 
established cardiovascular disease (6764 patients 
[72.4%]), chronic kidney disease of stage 3 or 
higher (2307 [24.7%]), or both (1473 [15.8%]). 
At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 
12.8 years, and the mean glycated hemoglobin 
level was 8.7%.
Cardiovascular Outcomes
The primary composite outcome occurred in 
fewer patients in the liraglutide group (608 of 
4668 patients [13.0%]) than in the placebo group 
(694 of 4672 [14.9%]) (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.97; P<0.001 for 
noninferiority; P 
= 
0.01 for superiority) (Table 1 
and Fig. 1A). Death from cardiovascular causes 
occurred in fewer patients in the liraglutide 
group (219 patients [4.7%]) than in the placebo 
group (278 [6.0%]) (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 
0.66 to 0.93; P 
= 
0.007) (Fig. 1B). The rate of 
death from any cause was also lower in the lira-
glutide group (381 patients [8.2%]) than in the 
placebo group (447 [9.6%]) (hazard ratio, 0.85; 
95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02). The frequencies of 
nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal 
stroke were lower in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group, although the differences were 
not significant (Fig. 1C and  1D and Table 1). 
The magnitude of the differences was similar in 
sensitivity analyses with alternative censoring, 
including the per-protocol analysis (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Findings for the re-
maining adjudicated cardiovascular outcomes and 
the expanded composite outcome are provided 
in Table 1, and Figure S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Subgroup analyses are shown in Figure 2. 
Significant interactions were observed for an 
eGFR of 60 ml or more per minute per 1.73 m2 
versus an eGFR of less than 60 ml per minute 
per 1.73 m2, with a benefit favoring the lower 
eGFR, and for the presence versus absence of 
established cardiovascular disease at baseline, 
with benefit for those with cardiovascular dis-
ease at baseline. Additional subgroup analyses 
regarding the eGFR are provided in Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Glycemic Control
Changes in the glycated hemoglobin values 
over time are shown in Figure S5A in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. The prespecified analysis at 
36 months showed a mean difference between 
the liraglutide group and the placebo group of 
−0.40 percentage points (95% CI, −0.45 to −0.34). 
Changes in the use of diabetes medication dur-
ing the trial are shown in Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
There were significant mean differences between 
the liraglutide group and the placebo group in 
the change from baseline to 36 months in the 
following variables: weight loss was 2.3 kg (95% 
CI, 2.5 to 2.0) higher in the liraglutide group, the 
systolic blood pressure was 1.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 
1.9 to 0.5) lower in the liraglutide group, the 
diastolic blood pressure was 0.6 mm Hg (95%

Liraglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
CI, 0.2 to 1.0) higher in the liraglutide group, 
and the heart rate was 3.0 beats per minute (95% 
CI, 2.5 to 3.4) higher in the liraglutide group 
(Fig. S5B, S5C, and S5D in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The use of cardiovascular medica-
tions at baseline and during the trial is shown in 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Microvascular Outcomes
The incidence of a composite outcome of renal 
or retinal microvascular events was lower in the 
liraglutide group than in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02), 
a difference that was driven by a lower rate of 
nephropathy events in the liraglutide group (1.5 vs. 
1.9 events per 100 patient-years of observation; 
hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.003) 
(Table 1). The incidence of retinopathy events 
was nonsignificantly higher in the liraglutide 
group than in the placebo group (0.6 vs. 0.5 
events per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.15; 
95% CI, 0.87 to 1.52; P 
= 
0.33).
Safety and Adverse Events
Adverse events are listed in Table 2. The overall 
rates of benign or malignant neoplasms were 
higher in the liraglutide group than in the pla-
cebo group, but the difference was not signifi-
cant (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
There were 13 patients with pancreatic cancer in 
the liraglutide group and 5 in the placebo group. 
Additional data regarding pancreatic cancer are 
provided in Table S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. There were fewer patients with prostate 
cancer in the liraglutide group than in the pla-
cebo group (26 vs. 47) and also fewer patients 
with leukemia (5 vs. 14) (Fig. S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Medullary thyroid carcino-
ma occurred in no patient in the liraglutide 
group and in 1 in the placebo group. Calcitonin 
levels over time were similar in the two groups 
(data not shown).
Acute pancreatitis occurred in 18 patients in 
the liraglutide group and in 23 in the placebo 
group. The mean levels of serum amylase and 
lipase were higher in the liraglutide group than 
in the placebo group (Fig. S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Acute gallstone disease was 
more common with liraglutide than with placebo 
(in 145 vs. 90 patients), including severe events 
(in 40 vs. 31). During the trial, fewer patients in 
the liraglutide group were treated with hypo-
glycemic medications (insulin, sulfonylurea, and 
glinides) than in the placebo group (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Severe hypoglyce-
mia occurred in 114 patients in the liraglutide 
group and in 153 in the placebo group (rate ratio, 
0.69; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.93). Similarly, the rate 
ratio for confirmed hypoglycemia (plasma glu-
cose level, <56 mg per deciliter [3.1 mmol per 
liter]) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.88). Addi-
tional details regarding severe hypoglycemia are 
provided in Table S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Adverse events leading to the permanent dis-
continuation of the trial regimen were more 
common with liraglutide than with placebo 
(Table 2). This result appears to have been driven 
by gastrointestinal disorders in the liraglutide 
group.
Discussion
In the present trial, patients in the liraglutide 
group had a lower risk of the primary composite 
outcome — first occurrence of cardiovascular 
death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or non-
fatal stroke in the time-to-event analysis — and 
lower risks of death from cardiovascular causes, 
death from any cause, and microvascular events 
than did those in the placebo group. The num-
ber of patients who would need to be treated to 
prevent one event in 3 years was 66 in the analy-
sis of the primary outcome and 98 in the analysis 
of death from any cause.10 There has been con-
cern about the risk of hospitalization for heart 
failure with various agents that have been used to 
treat diabetes mellitus, including DPP-4 inhibi-
Figure 1 (facing page). Primary and Exploratory Outcomes.
The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event 
analysis was the first occurrence of death from cardio-
vascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or non-
fatal stroke. The cumulative incidences were estimated 
with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, and the haz-
ard ratios with the use of the Cox proportional-hazard 
regression model. The data analyses are truncated at 
54 months, because less than 10% of the patients had 
an observation time beyond 54 months. The insets show 
the same data on an enlarged y axis.

Liraglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
tors.11 In the present trial, there were fewer 
hospitalizations for heart failure among patients 
in the liraglutide group than among those in the 
placebo group, although the difference was not 
significant.
Sensitivity analyses suggested that our find-
ings were robust to baseline adjustment and alter-
native censoring. Cardiovascular benefits were 
observed in the context of generally acceptable 
levels of cardiovascular risk-factor management 
at baseline and during the trial. There were 
fewer add-on therapies for diabetes medications, 
lipid-lowering medications, and diuretics in pa-
tients in the liraglutide group than in those in 
the placebo group. Subgroup analyses suggest a 
greater benefit of liraglutide with respect to the 
primary outcome in patients with an eGFR of 
less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 and pos-
sibly in patients with a history of cardiovascular 
disease. A sensitivity analysis of data for patients 
with an eGFR of less than 60 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 did not support a clinically meaningful 
interaction (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The pattern of cardiovascular benefits that 
were associated with liraglutide in our trial ap-
pears to differ from that with the sodium–glu-
cose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin in 
the previously reported EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trial.12 The time to benefit emerged earlier in 
that trial than in the present trial, and the het-
erogeneity of the direction and magnitude of the 
effects on the components of the primary com-
posite outcome in that trial contrasts with the 
consistency of the effect in the present trial. 
Although these differences may reflect patient 
populations or chance, the observed benefits in 
that trial may be more closely linked to hemo-
dynamic changes, whereas in the present trial, 
the observed benefits are perhaps related to the 
modified progression of atherosclerotic vascular 
disease.13
It should be noted that in the Evaluation of 
Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA) 
trial,14 the GLP-1–receptor agonist lixisenatide, 
which is shorter-acting than and structurally 
dissimilar to liraglutide, did not show any car-
diovascular benefit in patients with diabetes and 
a recent acute coronary syndrome. There are a 
number of other trials regarding cardiovascular 
outcomes in high-risk cohorts of patients with 
type 2 diabetes in which similar magnitude ef-
fects on glycemic control have been shown but 
without significant benefits with respect to rates 
of cardiovascular events or death.15-20 These in-
clude trials with insulin,16 thiazolidinediones,15,18 
and DPP-4 inhibitors.17,19,20 Our trial had greater 
statistical power and included patients with a 
higher baseline glycated hemoglobin level than 
did most previous studies. However, no obvious 
single explanation in terms of either the study 
designs or the included populations is apparent 
to explain the divergent findings across this 
body of medical literature.
The prespecified primary microvascular out-
come in our trial was a composite of nephropa-
thy and retinopathy outcomes. The benefit with 
liraglutide was driven by lower rates of renal 
outcomes, such as new-onset persistent macro-
albuminuria in particular. There was a higher 
rate of retinopathy events with liraglutide than 
with placebo, although the difference was not 
significant. With moderate differences in glyce-
mic control between the trial groups over a me-
dian 3.8 years of follow-up, the achievement of 
Figure 2 (facing page). Primary Composite Outcomes 
in Various Demographic and Clinical Subgroups.
Prespecified Cox proportional-hazard regression analy-
ses were performed for subgroups of patients with re-
spect to the primary outcome (first occurrence of death 
from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, or nonfatal stroke). P values signify tests of homo-
geneity for between-group differences with no adjust-
ment for multiple testing. The percentages of patients 
with a first primary outcome between the randomiza-
tion date and the date of last follow-up are shown. Race 
and ethnic group were self-reported. There were miss-
ing data for the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters) in 5 pa-
tients in the liraglutide group and 4 in the placebo group 
and for the duration of diabetes in 11 patients in the 
 
liraglutide group and 8 in the placebo group. Renal 
function was assessed by means of the estimated glo-
merular filtration rate, as calculated by the Modifica-
tion of Diet in Renal Disease equation. CVD denotes 
cardiovascular disease.

Serious adverse events and nonserious medical events of special interest were identified by search in the Medical Dic-
tionary for Regulatory Activities, version 18.0. Permanent discontinuation of the treatment regimen was indicated by the 
investigator in the adverse-event form. P values were calculated by means of Pearson’s chi-square test.
†  
Confirmed hypoglycemia was defined a plasma glucose level of less than 56 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter). 
Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia for which the patient required assistance from a third party.
‡  
Increased lipase levels were those that were reported by the investigator as adverse events.
§  
Events of pancreatitis and neoplasms were adjudicated by the event-adjudication committee. This committee interpret-
ed neoplastic growth as clonal disorders that grow in an autonomous manner. The abnormality of clonal disorder may 
not always have been identified nor could autonomous growth always be determined, but both were considered to be 
fundamental aspects of neoplastic growth.

Liraglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
renal microvascular benefits is surprising. It is 
uncertain whether this finding relates to the di-
rect effects of liraglutide on kidney function.21,22
More patients in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group permanently discontinued the 
trial regimen owing to adverse events (difference, 
2.2 percentage points). There has been consid-
erable interest in a potential association between 
the use of GLP-1–receptor agonists and pancre-
atitis and pancreatic cancer, although there is no 
consistent preclinical, pharmacovigilance, or epi-
demiologic evidence to date.23-25 Higher levels of 
lipase and amylase were observed in the liraglu-
tide group, a finding that is similar to results in 
other studies.24 Blinded medications were to be 
stopped only in relation to confirmed pancreati-
tis as evaluated by the investigator. There were 
1.5 episodes of pancreatitis per 1000 patient-years 
of observation in both regimens combined, and 
there were numerically fewer acute or chronic 
pancreatitis events with liraglutide than with 
placebo. There were more episodes of gallstone 
disease with liraglutide, a finding that has been 
reported previously.26
An excess in adjudicated cancers of pancre-
atic origin was observed in the liraglutide group, 
although the finding was not significant; there 
were small overall numbers and no between-
group difference in the number of overall can-
cers. Among rodents receiving liraglutide, high-
er rates of thyroid C-cell tumors and hyperplasia 
have been observed than were observed among 
control animals.27 In the present trial, no episodes 
of C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid carci-
noma were observed in patients in the liraglutide 
group. Randomized trials of this type, despite 
their size, are not powered to determine the 
effect of drugs on cancer risk and can therefore 
neither confirm nor exclude such a possibility.
Many patients in each group were treated 
with sulfonylureas or insulin at baseline, but 
fewer patients in the liraglutide group than in 
the placebo group added insulin during the trial. 
There was a 31% lower rate of severe hypoglyce-
mia and a 20% lower rate of the combination of 
severe and confirmed hypoglycemia (plasma glu-
cose level, <56 mg per deciliter) in the liraglutide 
group than in the placebo group.
A limitation of our trial is that patients were 
followed for only 3.5 to 5.0 years, so the safety 
and efficacy data are restricted to that time pe-
riod. Also, because our trial recruited a popula-
tion of patients who were at high risk for cardio-
vascular events and who had a baseline glycated 
hemoglobin level of 7% or more, the observed 
benefits and risks may not apply to patients at 
lower risk. Furthermore, no adjustments were 
made for multiplicity of exploratory outcomes.
In conclusion, among patients with type 2 
diabetes who were at high risk for cardiovascu-
lar events while they were taking standard 
therapy, those in the liraglutide group had 
lower rates of cardiovascular events and death 
from any cause than did those in the placebo 
group.
