Background: Previous studies of racial disparities in total joint replacement, particularly total knee arthroplasty, in the
U.S. have predominantly focused on disparities between blacks and whites and were limited to Medicare patients or
veterans, populations that are not representative of the entire U.S. population. We sought to study racial disparities in the
utilization of total knee arthroplasty, the use of high-volume hospitals, and total knee arthroplasty outcomes, including
mortality and complications, using all-payer databases.
Methods: We analyzed data from 8 years and 8 racially diverse states in the State Inpatient Databases (SID). Patient
race was categorized according to the SID as white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and mixed race. Both crude
and adjusted racial and/or ethnic disparities were evaluated.
Results: In comparison with whites (4.65 per 1000 population per year), black (3.90), Hispanic (3.71), Asian (3.89), Native
American (4.40), and mixed-race (3.69) populations had lower rates of total knee arthroplasty utilization (p < 0.0001). After
risk adjustment, the rate of total knee arthroplasty utilization was significantly lower for blacks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87 [95%
confidence interval (CI), 0.85 to 0.89]; p < 0.0001), Hispanics (OR = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.83]; p < 0.0001), Asians (OR =
0.83 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.89]; p < 0.0001), Native Americans (OR = 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.93]; p < 0.0001), and mixed race (OR =
0.84 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.90]; p < 0.0001) compared with the rate for whites. Lower rates of total knee arthroplasty utilization for
blacks, Hispanics, and mixed-race groups became worse over the years. Patients from minority groups were less likely to undergo
total knee arthroplasty in high-volume hospitals than were whites. Moreover, the rates of mortality were significantly higher
for blacks (OR = 1.52 [95% CI, 1.17 to 1.97]; p = 0.0017), Native Americans (OR = 6.52 [95% CI, 4.63 to 9.17]; p < 0.0001),
and mixed-race patients (OR = 4.35 [95% CI, 3.24 to 5.84]; p < 0.0001). Blacks (OR = 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.15]; p = 0.01)
and mixed-race patients (OR = 1.17 [95% CI, 1.001 to 1.36]; p = 0.04) had higher rates of complications than whites.
Conclusions: Minorities had lower rates of total knee arthroplasty utilization but higher rates of adverse health outcomes
associated with the procedure, even after adjusting for patient-related and health-care system-related characteristics. Utili-
zation rates were based on overall population as the proportion of the population with osteoarthritis requiring arthroplasty is
unknown. Future studies that consider specific patient-level information with psychosocial and behavioral factors are needed.

 for individuals with advanced arthritis of the knee has been well
documented
6,7. In fact, the number of total knee arthroplasties
more than doubled from 329,000 in 1997 to 719,000 in 2010
8.
The nation will also become more racially and ethnically di-
verse, with the minority population projected to become the
majority of older adults9. As total knee arthroplasty can po-
tentially improve the health of many Americans, there is a great
need to understand, track, and resolve racial and/or ethnic dis-
parities in its utilization. Accordingly, the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) has issued a comprehensive
evidence report on the indications for total knee arthroplasty,
considering disparities in the utilization of total knee arthro-
plasty one of the key topics
1.
Racial disparities in arthritis care and joint replacement
are well documented for Medicare patients and veterans, among
whom white men are twice as likely as black men to undergo
total knee arthroplasty despite similar risks of developing ar-
thritis
3,4,10-15. Studies of veterans also indicate that complication
rates after total knee arthroplasty are higher for patients from
minority groups than for whites
16. In addition, disparities in the
characteristics and health outcomes of patients utilizing total
knee arthroplasty at hospitals performing a high volume of the
procedure have been observed
17,18. Prior studies have predomi-
nantly focused on disparities between black and white popula-
tions and were limited to Medicare patients or veterans. While
providing important insight into health disparity research, these
studies that solely focus on certain populations may not be truly
reflective of the entire U.S. population.
To overcome these limitations, we used data from the State
Inpatient Databases (SID), a national representative database
that encompass approximately 97% of all U.S. community
hospital discharges. We sought to study racial disparities in the
utilization of total knee arthroplasty in high-volume hospitals
and perioperative total knee arthroplasty outcomes including
mortality and complications across multiple minority groups,
including Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and
mixed-race individuals.
Materials and Methods
T
he SID data files are sponsored by AHRQ and are commercially obtained
from the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). As of 2013, the
SID contained comprehensive databases of the inpatient discharge abstracts for
28 participating states. These large-scale databases contained both clinical and
nonclinical information such as diagnoses and procedures, discharge status, and
patient demographics. With such ample information, the SID provided a unique
and powerful platform to study racial disparities in musculoskeletal and other
areas of medicine19-33. This study was exempt from review by the institutional
review board as it was secondary data analysis of sufficiently deidentified data.
Study Population
Our study sample consisted of data from 8 years (2001 through 2008) and 8
racially diverse states (Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Florida) from the SID. Discharges with an
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification
procedure code for primary total knee arthroplasty (81.54) were identified and
included in the sample. We excluded patients whose age was <45 years and
patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty for a neoplasm, congenital
dislocation, or infection.
Study Variables and Statistical Analysis
We considered the following 4 outcome variables: (1) the rate of total knee
arthroplasty, (2) utilization of hospitals with higher total knee arthroplasty
volumes (1 to 200, 201 to 400, and >400), (3) in-hospital mortality (died
compared with alive), and (4) in-hospital complications (any complications
compared with no complication). We calculated the total knee arthroplasty
utilization rate by dividing the number of procedures by the total population in
the patient residential area, which is a proxy for persons with advanced arthritis.
The independent variable of interest was race or ethnicity as defined in the SID:
white, black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, Native American, and mixed
race. Patient characteristics included age (45 to 64, 65 to 74, and ‡75 years), sex,
admission source (routine and nonroutine), insurance type (Medicare, Med-
icaid, private, and other), surgical reason (osteonecrosis, congenital dislocation,
inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other), length of hospital stay, year of
surgery, and overall comorbidity burden summarized according to the Deyo
comorbidity index
34. U.S. Census data were used to estimate the educational
attainment and poverty rate for the community in which the patient lived
on the basis of residential zip codes. Specifically, educational attainment was
measured as the proportion of people whose highest degrees were above a
bachelor’s degree. Poverty was measured by the proportion of people who lived
below the national poverty level. Health-care system information, including
hospital teaching status, hospital location, and bed size, were obtained from the
American Hospital Association by linking it to the SID via hospital identifi-
cation number.
The outcome variables, patient characteristics, and hospital-level in-
formation were summarized as frequency and percentage or mean and 95%
confidence interval as appropriate for each racial group. In univariate analysis,
crude differences in all variables between racial groups were evaluated using the
chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-
Wallis test for continuous variables.
Adjusted racial differences were evaluated using logistic regression
models for in-hospital mortality, morbidity, and rate of utilization, and a
multinomial logistic regression model was used for hospitals that performed a
high volume of total knee arthroplasties, with inference based on the general-
ized estimating equations (GEEs) method35, while controlling for patient-level
and hospital-level characteristics. To assess whether total knee arthroplasty
utilization had improved over time, we calculated the differences in total knee
arthroplasty rates between each minority group and whites and performed a
linear regression of these differences over time for each comparison separately
(i.e., black and white, Hispanic and white, Asian and white, Native American
and white, and mixed race and white). Data on patient race were missing for
10.6% of the study population. Multiple (5) imputations were conducted to
impute missing data on race36. All analyses were performed on each imputed
data set; results were combined using the standard rules from Rubin
36. The level
of significance was set at 0.05.

e identified a total of 547,380 admissions from 2001 to
2008 during which a total knee arthroplasty was per-
formed. Of those, the 3 largest racial or ethnic groups were
whites (87.24%), blacks (5.88%), and Hispanics (4.20%).
Asians (0.46%), Native Americans (0.51%), and mixed race
(1.71%) were the smallest groups (Table I). In comparison with
whites, minorities were younger, included more females, had a
lower level of insurance coverage, were more likely to receive a
blood transfusion during total knee arthroplasty, and had an
increased comorbidity burden overall. Blacks, Hispanics, Na-
tive Americans, and mixed-race groups were also poorer and
less educated than whites and Asians. In addition, the rate of
obesity was much higher for blacks and Hispanics and routine

 admissions were higher for Hispanics than for whites. Blacks,
Hispanics, Asians, and mixed-race groups were more likely
than whites to undergo total knee arthroplasty in teaching
hospitals that were located in urban areas and had larger
numbers of beds.
Unadjusted Analyses of Racial Disparities
Overall, minorities were found to be associated with lower rates
of total knee arthroplasty, were less likely to go to high-volume
hospitals, and had higher rates of in-hospital mortality and
complications (Table II). We further assessed the association
between outcomes and race using unadjusted odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Fig. 1). Significantly
lower rates of total knee arthroplasty utilization were found for
blacks (OR = 0.73 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.76]; p < 0.0001), His-
panics (OR = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.78]; p < 0.0001), Asians
(OR = 0.72 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79]; p < 0.0001), Native
Americans (OR = 0.77 [95% CI, 0.72 to 0.82]; p < 0.0001), and
mixed race (OR = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.82]; p < 0.0001). In
comparison with whites, minorities were less likely to undergo
total knee arthroplasty in high-volume hospitals (OR = 0.75
[95% CI, 0.73 to 0.77; p < 0.0001] for blacks, OR = 0.50 [95%
CI, 0.49 to 0.51; p < 0.0001] for Hispanics, OR = 0.85 [95% CI,
0.78 to 0.92; p < 0.0001] for Asians, OR = 0.39 [95% CI, 0.36 to
0.43; p < 0.0001] for Native Americans, and OR = 0.92 [95%
CI, 0.88 to 0.96; p = 0.0002] for mixed race).
Racial disparities were also found for mortality and
complications across years. Specifically, blacks (OR = 1.85

of in-hospital mortality than whites. Increased odds of in-

Time Trends in Total Knee Arthroplasty Utilization
Having determined that racial disparities existed in total knee
arthroplasty utilization across the years, the question remained
about whether inequality in access to total knee arthroplasty
had improved over time. Therefore, we compared the time
trends in total knee arthroplasty utilization by race (Fig. 2).
Overall, an increase in total knee arthroplasty utilization over
time (2002 to 2008) was seen for all racial groups, and whites
had consistently higher rates of total knee arthroplasty uti-
lization in all years than minorities. (The 2001 data were not
included in the trend analysis because county identifier was
not reported in some states, and total population could not
be obtained without this information.) The time trends with
regard to the differences in total knee arthroplasty utiliza-
tion varied between minorities and whites. Increasing trends
were found in a comparison of whites with minorities, i.e.,
with blacks (p < 0.0001), Hispanics (p < 0.0001), Asians (p =
0.24), mixed race (p = 0.0243), and Native Americans (p =
0.24). In particular, a comparison of the data for 2002 and
2008 demonstrated that the difference in the utilization of
total knee arthroplasty increased for whites by 32% compared
with blacks (p < 0.0001), by 38% compared with Hispanics
Fig. 1
The association between outcomes and race was assessed for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) utilization, use of hospitals with higher volumes
of TKA, in-hospital mortality, and in-hospital complications using unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The
unadjusted OR, 95% CI, and p values were calculated with the chi-square test. *A significant difference was detected between 2 racial groups
(p < 0.05).

Compared with whites, minorities had lower rates of total
knee arthroplasty utilization (OR = 0.87 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.89;
p < 0.0001] for blacks; OR = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.83; p <

Discussion
I
n this study of national administrative data collected for the
SID from 8 states from 2001 through 2008, we found that
minorities had higher rates of adverse outcomes (mortality
and complications) and lower rates of total knee arthroplasty
utilization. Furthermore, minorities were less likely than whites
to undergo total knee arthroplasty in high-volume hospitals.
Most of the racial disparities found in unadjusted analyses
remained significant in adjusted analyses, implying that dif-
ferences in patient demographics, health conditions, and
socioeconomic status as well as health-care system charac-
teristics explained only some racial disparities in utilization
of and outcomes after total knee arthroplasty37,38. The reasons

The adjusted OR, 95% CI, and p values were calculated from logistic regression for mortality, complications, and total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
utilization and from multinomial logistic regression for utilization of hospitals with a higher volume of total knee arthroplasties. *A significant difference
was detected between 2 racial groups (p < 0.05).

RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN UTILIZATION RATE, HOSPITA L
VOLUME, AND OUTCOMES AFTER TKA
 for these disparities are complex and multifactorial in nature.
Several studies have discussed a host of behavioral and social
factors, such as patient preferences and expectations, that may
play a role in influencing one’s decision to seek medical care and
overall health outcomes. For example, compared with whites,
blacks were more likely to rely on self-care measures such as
prayer and were less likely to consider surgery for severe ar-
thritis pain even when accounting for disease severity
39-41. The
results of those studies have suggested that culturally based
factors (such as feelings about the helpfulness of prayer and other
forms of complementary treatments) can influence ethnic vari-
ations in how individuals perceive and manage diseases such as
arthritis, which can subsequently impact the utilization of health-
care services. In addition, patient expectations appear to shape
surgical outcomes42. Engel et al. showed that a patient’s gener-
alized expectations from total knee arthroplasty and personal
efficacy beliefs substantially predicted the extent of gains in both
physical and mental health outcomes after surgery, demon-
strating that up to a 13% variance in total knee arthroplasty
outcomes was due to expectations and efficacy
43. Physician rec-
ommendations for surgery may also offer partial explanations for
the disparities observed in total knee arthroplasty utilization. The
Institute of Medicine’s 2003 report concluded that health-care
providers are less likely to provide alternative treatments and
services for patients refusing treatment or conveying mistrust
41.
Hausmann et al.44 found that the odds of receiving joint re-
placement therapy recommendations were lower for black pa-
tients than for white patients.
Our study also found that minorities were more likely
to undergo total knee arthroplasty in hospitals with lower
annual volumes. Patient and provider-level factors could con-
tribute toward the decision of minorities to choose hospitals
with a low volume of total knee arthroplasties. Patients may
have little knowledge or experience of where to go for spe-
cialty care and may not have the insurance necessary to allow
for care at specialty care hospitals. On the other hand, phy-
sicians are also likely to refer within their network. High-
volume physicians refer to other high-volume physicians.
Physicians caring for low-income populations also typically
refer within their network. These referral patterns can con-
tribute toward disparities in total knee arthroplasty use
45. In
addition, hospital distances and patient willingness to travel
may play a role. In fact, studies have shown that some patients
refuse surgery in unfamiliar and possibly distant high-volume
hospitals
46. It may be possible that low-volume centers are
located in areas with increased numbers of minorities. Losina
et al. found that nonwhite, poor, less educated patients from
rural areas and patients from urban areas with a high con-
centration of poor, foreign-born citizens or minorities were
more likely to “bypass” a high-volume hospital and have total
knee arthroplasty within a low-volume hospital47. Providers
need to be aware of differences in utilization that may be due
to their referral patterns. They also need to educate patients
about the type of hospital in which they are receiving treat-
ment and alternative options for care available to them that
may include high-volume specialty institutions.
A few studies have found that disparities in the uti-
lization of joint arthroplasty have worsened rather than
improved over the years using Medicare data
48 or an in-
stitutional registry49. This was also confirmed by our study
using HCUP SID data, in which significantly increased dis-
parities in the utilization of total knee arthroplasty were
identified for blacks, Hispanics, and mixed-race individuals
over the years. The difference between blacks and whites with
respect to total knee arthroplasty utilization increased from
0.53 per 1000 in 2002 to 0.70 per 1000 in 2008 (a 32% in-
crease). During the same period, the disparities also became
worse for Hispanics (a 38% increase) and mixed-race indi-
viduals (22%).
To our knowledge, this is the first study of racial dis-
parities with respect to total knee arthroplasty using data from
HCUP SID across multiple years and states. In addition, the
current study utilizes nationally representative data, which con-
trasts with many prior studies that only examined certain patient
populations or racial groups. For example, Singh et al.
50
conducted an 18-year analysis of patients who had total knee
arthroplasty and found little evidence of declines in racial
disparities with respect to utilization of the procedure or
patient outcomes. However, that study was limited to data
from Medicare beneficiaries.
Our study is limited by a number of factors inherent to
secondary data analysis of large administrative databases. As
such, clinical information and socioeconomic status available
in the SID are limited, and thus we were unable to consider
such patient-level information when assessing racial dispar-
ities in the use of total knee arthroplasty. We used zip code-
derived income and education levels from the U.S. Census
instead of individual information. Because the proportion of
the population with osteoarthritis requiring arthroplasty was
unknown, the denominator in the rate of total knee arthro-
plasty utilization was the total population in a patient’s res-
idential area, which is a method that has been used in other
studies from administrative databases37,51. As a result, the
rates of total knee arthroplasty utilization may be under-
estimated. This may have further impact on the estimation of
the rates of total knee arthroplasty in certain subpopulations
(for example, race, sex, and age groups) as a result of the
different rates of osteoarthritis in these groups
47,52-54. Because
of the nature of the SID, only inpatient data are available and
thus mortality and complications after discharge are not cap-
tured. A substantial limitation of SID and other large data-
bases is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient
race,” a key indicator for health disparities research, had a
high proportion of missingness (the probability that a value
was missing), 10.6% of the study population. The patients
with observed racial information cannot be considered a
random subset of the original sample because the absence
of data on race was associated with the outcomes as well as
several patient-related and health-care system-related char-
acteristics. Therefore, analyses based on complete cases can
yield only biased results

statistical methodology developed for imputing data that are

 not missing completely at random, was utilized to impute
missing race data
56. This procedure replaces each missing
value with a set of plausible values to account for the un-
certainty of the imputed data.
In summary, compared with whites, minorities had
lower rates of total knee arthroplasty utilization but higher
rates of adverse health outcomes associated with the proce-
dure. Even after adjusting for certain patient demographics,
socioeconomic status, and health-care system characteristics,
significant racial disparities in total knee arthroplasty utili-
zation and outcomes exist. The use of lower-volume hospitals
and the increased rate of complications may adversely affect
the experience and social network of minorities, which fur-
ther promotes an unwillingness to undergo total knee ar-
throplasty. The current study utilizes nationally representative
data from HCUP SID across multiple years and states. Future
studies that consider specific patient-level information with
psychosocial and behavioral factors, such as patient prefer-
ences or attitudes toward total knee arthroplasty, are needed.
Research on these factors would guide and inform important
future health-care needs of an aging U.S. population. n
