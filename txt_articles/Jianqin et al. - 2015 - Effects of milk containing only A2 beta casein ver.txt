cows’ milk

Abstract
Background: Cows’ milk generally contains two types of β-casein, A1 and A2 types. Digestion of A1 type can yield
the peptide β-casomorphin-7, which is implicated in adverse gastrointestinal effects of milk consumption, some
of which resemble those in lactose intolerance. This study aimed to compare the effects of milk containing A1
β-casein with those of milk containing only A2 β-casein on inflammation, symptoms of post-dairy digestive
discomfort (PD3), and cognitive processing in subjects with self-reported lactose intolerance.
Methods: Forty-five Han Chinese subjects participated in this double-blind, randomized, 2 × 2 crossover trial and
consumed milk containing both β-casein types or milk containing only A2 β-casein. Each treatment period was
14 days with a 14-day washout period at baseline and between treatment periods. Outcomes included PD3,
gastrointestinal function (measured by smart pill), Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test (SCIT), serum/fecal laboratory
biomarkers, and adverse events.
Results: Compared with milk containing only A2 β-casein, the consumption of milk containing both β-casein types
was associated with significantly greater PD3 symptoms; higher concentrations of inflammation-related biomarkers
and β-casomorphin-7; longer gastrointestinal transit times and lower levels of short-chain fatty acids; and increased
response time and error rate on the SCIT. Consumption of milk containing both β-casein types was associated with
worsening of PD3 symptoms relative to baseline in lactose tolerant and lactose intolerant subjects. Consumption of
milk containing only A2 β-casein did not aggravate PD3 symptoms relative to baseline (i.e., after washout of dairy
products) in lactose tolerant and intolerant subjects.
Conclusions: Consumption of milk containing A1 β-casein was associated with increased gastrointestinal inflammation,
worsening of PD3 symptoms, delayed transit, and decreased cognitive processing speed and accuracy. Because
elimination of A1 β-casein attenuated these effects, some symptoms of lactose intolerance may stem from inflammation
it triggers, and can be avoided by consuming milk containing only the A2 type of beta casein.

Background
Dairy products, especially those derived from cows’ milk,
are a major nutritional component and their consumption
continues to increase worldwide. However, the increasing
consumption of dairy products is associated with an
increase in the risk of or the aggravation of symptoms of
some disorders, including gastrointestinal dysfunction
[1–5] and immune-/inflammation-related disorders [6, 7].
Some of these effects of dairy products have been attrib-
uted to a group of peptides present in milk derived from
the proteolysis of β-casein, particularly β-casomorphin-7
(BCM-7).
BCM-7 is uniquely derived from the digestion of the
A1 β-casein type but not the A2 β-casein type; the two
primary types of β-casein present in milk. Either or both
of these types may be expressed in cows’ milk depending
on the individual cows’ genetic makeup. Cows may be
homozygous for one type, or heterozygous with allelic
co-dominance resulting in both types being expressed in
milk. The two types differ in their protein structure
owing to a substitution of the amino acid at position 67.
A2 β-casein and related sub-variants including A3 and D
contain a proline residue at this site whereas A1 β-casein
and related sub-variants including B and C contain a histi-
dine residue at this position, which allows the preceding
seven amino acid residues to be cleaved, yielding BCM-7
[8]. Based on the β-casein structure and potential to yield
BCM-7
upon
digestion
in
humans,
the
β-caseins
expressed in human, goat, sheep, and buffalo though not
of the A2 type are classed as “A2-like”. It has been re-
ported that casein and its derivatives, particularly BCM-7,
exert a variety of effects on gastrointestinal function in
animal models, including reducing the frequency and
amplitude of intestinal contractions [3, 9–12], increasing
mucus secretion [13–15], and suppressing lymphocyte
proliferation [16, 17].
Intolerance to dairy products is a commonly reported
gastrointestinal disorder, and is usually attributed to lac-
tose intolerance [18]. However, based on the gastrointes-
tinal effects of BCM-7 (and hence milk containing A1 β-
casein), it is possible that intolerance to dairy products in
some cases is related to the consumption of A1 β-casein
rather than lactose per se. Our hypothesis is that the
consumption of A1 β-casein leads to the production and
exposure of tissue to BCM-7, which exerts a range of pro-
inflammatory effects including altered signaling activity,
redox disorders, and altered epigenetic regulation of gene
expression [19]. A consequence of these changes is the
disruption of digestive process, which may manifest as
symptoms of lactose intolerance in terms of its presenta-
tion. Accordingly, the consumption of milk containing A2
β-casein at the exclusion of A1 β-casein may alleviate or
prevent the gastrointestinal disturbances associated with
BCM-7.
To date, however, few studies have compared the
gastrointestinal effects of milk containing only the A2
β-casein type with milk containing A1 β-casein in
humans [20]. Therefore, we performed a randomized,
controlled, double-blind crossover study to compare
the effects of milk containing only the A2 β-casein type
with milk containing the A1 β-casein type in terms of
gastrointestinal
function,
including
serum
and
fecal
laboratory tests, gastrointestinal symptoms of post-dairy
digestive discomfort, stool frequency, Bristol Stool Scale,
gastrointestinal transit time, and gastrointestinal inflam-
mation. We hypothesized that the consumption of milk
containing A1 β-casein would lead to systemic inflamma-
tion and gastrointestinal disorders similar to those of lac-
tose intolerance in a cohort of subjects with perceived or
confirmed lactose intolerance. We also hypothesized that
elimination of the A1 β-casein type by providing subjects
with milk that only contained the A2 β-casein type would
avoid or attenuate these effects of A1 β-casein.
Because milk containing only the A1 β-casein type is
not commercially available for consumption and is not
representative of consumer milk products, we used
normal milk containing a mixture of both the A1 and
A2 β-casein types. Milk containing only the A2 β-casein
type was confirmed to be prepared from cows homozy-
gous for the A2 genotype.
We focused on a Chinese Han population because of
the very high rate of perceived lactose intolerance or
reported lactose malabsorption of up to 90 % in this
population noted in some studies [21–23]. In spite of
this, milk consumption in China has continued to in-
crease, with per capita dairy product consumption
among urban residents tripling from nearly 6 kg in 1992
to 18 kg by 2006 [24].
Methods
Study design
The study was conducted in Accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki as amended in Seoul 2008 and
was approved by the ethics committee of the Shanghai
Nutrition Society (approval number: SNSIRB#2014[002]).
The
study
was
registered
with
ClinicalTrials.gov
Jianqin et al. Nutrition Journal  (2016) 15:35

 (identifier: NCT02406469). All subjects provided written
informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.
This
was
a
single-site,
double-blind,
randomized,
controlled, 2 × 2 cross-over study designed to evaluate
the effects of milk containing only the A2 β-casein type
versus milk containing the A1 and A2 β-casein types on
serum levels of immune response markers in correlation
to symptoms of intolerance. The design of the study is
shown in Fig. 1. After a screening visit at which the
subjects underwent full clinical evaluations and qualita-
tive tests for urinary galactose, eligible subjects entered a
2-week washout period. Then, subjects entered interven-
tion period 1 in which they received milk containing only
the A2 β-casein type or milk containing both β-casein
types according to the randomization scheme for 2 weeks.
After a second 2-week washout period, the subjects
entered intervention period 2 in which they received the
opposite milk product. Visits were scheduled at the start
of each intervention period and at Days 7 and 14 in each
intervention period. The subjects were contacted by
telephone during each washout period. The study was
conducted at the Department of Gastroenterology, Xin
Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University
School of Medicine (Shanghai, China).
Interventions
Milk containing only the A2 β-casein type and milk
containing both the A1 and A2 β-casein types were
provided by A2 Infant Nutrition Limited (Auckland,
New Zealand), and were distributed to the study site by
SPRIM China. Staff at SPRIM China repackaged and la-
beled all of the products to ensure the investigators and
subjects were blinded to which product they received in
each intervention period. In each intervention period,
the subjects were instructed to consume 250 ml of milk
after two meals per day for 14 days. Subjects used a
diary to record milk intake and adherence to each inter-
vention. The used and unused cartons were collected at
each visit to evaluate compliance to the interventions
and to confirm that the blinding was intact.
Subjects
were
randomized,
with
stratification
by
gender, to sequence 1 (A1/A2 → A2) or sequence 2
(A2 → A1/A2) according to the allocation number filed
in sealed envelopes. The allocation was based on a
computer-generated list prepared by SPRIM China.
The milk
containing
only
the
A2
β-casein
type
contained (per 100 ml) 271 kJ energy, 3.1 g protein,
3.6 g fat, 5.0 g carbohydrate, 48 mg sodium, 150 mg po-
tassium, and 117 mg calcium. The ratio of A1 β-casein
to A2 β-casein was approximately 40:60 in milk contain-
ing both β-casein types, as confirmed by ultra perform-
ance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
Both products were identical and contained the same
amount of protein.
The consumption of dairy products other than those
provided was prohibited during the study and subjects
were not permitted to consume any cows’ milk products
during each washout period.
Subjects
The inclusion criteria were as follows: male or female; age
25–68 years; irregular milk consumption (as documented
using
a
food
frequency
questionnaire);
self-reported
intolerance to commercial milk; self-reported mild to
moderate digestive discomfort after milk consumption;

 and normal electrocardiograms (ECG) and blood pressure
during quiet respiration.
Subjects were enrolled if they: agreed not to take any
medication, nutritional supplements, or other dairy
products, including acidophilus milk, during the study;
were willing to comply with all of the requirements and
procedures; provided signed informed consent; agreed
not to participate in another interventional clinical
research study during the present study; did not meet
any of the exclusion criteria (see Additional file 1); and
fully understood the nature, objective, benefit, and the
potential risks and side effects of the study. No subjects
with existing conditions such as irritable bowel syn-
drome,
constipation,
or
un-medicated
inflammatory
bowel disease were enrolled.
Subjects were recruited via advertisements placed on
noticeboards at community hospitals.
Study measures
At screening, the subjects underwent comprehensive
evaluations, including screening of medical history, mea-
surements (height, body weight, blood pressure, ECG),
physical examinations, and quantitative tests for urinary
galactose. The following assessments were made at base-
line and Day 14 in both intervention periods: the Subtle
Cognitive Impairment Test (SCIT); self-reported symp-
toms of post-dairy digestive discomfort; and laboratory
tests (See Additional file 1). Subjects used daily diaries
to record milk intake, adherence, gastrointestinal symp-
toms, and adverse events. In addition, subjects were
given a smart pill (OMOM Capsule; Chongqing Jinshan
Science & Technology [Group] Co., Ltd., Chongqing,
China) on Day 14 of each intervention period.
Gastrointestinal symptoms of post-dairy digestive discomfort
Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded using the
Bristol Stool Chart in daily diaries, which included stool
frequency and stool consistency. Stool consistency was
evaluated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 = separate
hard lumps that are hard to pass to 7 = watery with no
solid pieces or entirely liquid. At each visit, the gastro-
intestinal symptoms of post-dairy digestive discomfort
were assessed by the investigator who asked whether the
subject felt any of the following: bloating, abdominal
pain, flatulence, heavy stomach and borborygmi (stom-
ach rumbling). Each symptom was rated on a 4-point
Likert-type scale, as never (score = 0), rarely (score = 1),
frequently (score = 2), or all of the time (score = 3).
Measurement of gastrointestinal transit time and inflammation
using a smart pill
The smart pill was given on Day 14 of each interven-
tion period to calculate the following variables: small
bowel transit time (SBTT)—the time between capsule
entry into the small bowel and entry into the cecum;
colonic transit time (CTT)—time between the entry
into the cecum and defecation; and whole gastrointes-
tinal transit time (WGTT)—time between capsule in-
gestion and defecation.
Stomach and small bowel inflammation was also
evaluated using the smart pill, and graded as im-
proved, worsened, and unchanged. As a pilot trial, a
limited number of smart pills were purchased. Inflam-
mation was diagnosed and assessed by a gastroenter-
ologist using images obtained using the smart pill.
Inflammation was graded as worse/not at all/better
based on the images and videos obtained after the
two interventions. The gastroenterologist was blinded
to the intervention and was only provided with the
subjects’ identification numbers.
SCIT
The SCIT is a computer-based test that measures the
speed
and
effectiveness
of
information
processing
[25]. Participants indicate which of the two parallel
vertical lines in the target stimulus is shorter by
pressing the left or right mouse button. A visually
masked target stimulus is randomly presented at ex-
posure durations of 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112 and
128 ms; 12 trials at each for a total of 96 trials. Sub-
ject response time and error rate are recorded for
stimulus exposure duration. Data for the four shortest
exposure durations 16–64 ms; referred to as the
“head” of the response curve) are pooled to provide
two representative test scores for pre-conscious-automatic
processing: response time (SCIT-RTH) and error rate
(SCIT-EH).
Data
for
the
four
longer
presentation
durations (83–133 ms; referred to as the “tail” of the
response curve) are pooled to provide two more rep-
resentative scores for conscious processing: response
time (SCIT-RTT) and error rate (SCIT-ET). The SCIT
has high test–retest and internal consistency reliabil-
ities, and medium–high content validity [25].
Adverse events
Adverse events were recorded using case report forms
and categorized in terms of their severity, potential
relationship to the interventions, and outcome. The type
of event was recorded using the codes presented in
Additional file 1.
Statistical analysis
As an exploratory study, sample size calculations were
not performed. We planned to recruit approximately
40 subjects after considering the design and results of
a prior double-blind, randomized, 8-week cross-over
trial [20].

 The Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test was used to assess the
normality of continuous variables. Non-normally distrib-
uted variables were subjected to square-root or log
transformation to approximate a normal distribution.
Baseline characteristics are presented descriptively as
means ± standard deviation (SD) or the number (per-
cent) of subjects. SCIT, gastrointestinal transit times,
stool frequency/consistency, and laboratory variables
were analyzed using mixed-effects analysis of variance in
which the allocated intervention and intervention period
were included as fixed effects, and subject was included as
a random effect nested within the study sequence (i.e.,
sequence 1, A1/A2 → A2; sequence 2, A2 → A1/A2). To
investigate whether there were differences between the
two interventions in the mean values for each endpoint,
and whether the mean values changed during the study
periods, Type III tests of fixed effects were used to tests
the effects of the interventions and study periods.
Additionally, contrast tests were performed to compare
the mean values for each product. The presence of a
carry-over effect was evaluated using the interaction Inter-
vention × Period. If this interaction was not significant,
data from both periods were evaluated. If the interaction
was significant, only data from intervention period 1 were
used. Gastrointestinal symptoms and results of the urinary
galactose test were evaluated using generalized estimating
equations (GEEs) in which intervention sequence and
measurement time were included as fixed effects and sub-
ject was included as a random effect nested within the
study sequence. No adjustments were made for multiple
comparisons. Adverse events are reported in terms of the
number (percent) of subjects with each type of event.
Results
Subjects
This study was performed between October 2014 and
December 2014. Overall, 104 subjects agreed to partici-
pate in the study and underwent the urinary galactose
test. All of the subjects were Chinese. Of these, 45 sub-
jects (21 males, 24 females; mean ± SD age 46.6 ±
14.0 years) with self-reported intolerance to cows’ milk
satisfied the eligibility criteria and were randomized to
sequences 1 or 2. Twenty-three subjects (8 in sequence
1 and 15 in sequence 2) were confirmed to be lactose in-
tolerant based on the results of the urinary galactose
test. The subjects allocated to both sequences were well
matched
in
terms
of
their
baseline
characteristics
(Table 1). All of the subjects reported that they did not
regularly consume cows’ milk and had self-reported
intolerance to cows’ milk.
Serum and fecal biomarkers
Results of the serum and fecal laboratory tests are pre-
sented in Table 2. There were no intervention period or
sequence effects for any of the laboratory variables (data
not shown). However, the baseline value was a signifi-
cant covariate for all laboratory variables. As shown in
Table 2, there were significant differences between the
two milk products in terms of the serum concentrations
of IL-4 (P < 0.0001), IgG (P = 0.0007), IgE (P = 0.0253),
and IgG1 (P = 0.0037) and the fecal concentrations of
acetic acid (P = 0.0052), butanoic acid (P = 0.0001), and
total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (P = 0.0009).
Gastrointestinal symptoms of post-dairy digestive discomfort
The self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms are summa-
rized in Tables 3 and 4, while the Bristol Stool Scale
scores are presented in Table 5. GEE analyses revealed
no significant sequence effects on any of the symptoms.
There were significant differences in the distributions of
the symptom scores for bloating, flatulence and borbo-
rygmus in both sequences when the subjects consumed
milk containing both β-casein types at W1 and W2 for
sequence 1 or W5 and W6 for sequence 2 compared
with baseline. The results indicate that the symptoms
were worse at these times than at baseline. By contrast,
there was no apparent worsening in symptoms when the
subjects consumed the milk containing only the A2 type,
indicating this type did not influence gastrointestinal
symptoms. For stool frequency, Time (P < 0.0001) and
Sequence × Time (P < 0.0001) were significant factors in
the mixed-effects ANOVA, but Sequence (P = 0.2801)
was not. For the Bristol Stool Consistency score, only
the
interaction
Sequence × Time
(P = 0.0022) was a
significant factor. The consumption of milk containing
both β-casein types was also associated with increases in
both stool frequency and Bristol Stool Scale scores
compared with baseline (Tables 2 and 4). By contrast,
consumption of milk containing only the A2 β-casein
type was not associated with changes in either variable
over time.
Gastrointestinal transit times
Because only 80 smart pills were purchased for this
study, a smart pill was not given to five subjects in
sequence 2 (A2 → A1/A2). Figure 2 compares the re-
gional gastrointestinal transit times measured using the
smart pill. Type III tests of fixed effects confirmed that
the intervention was a significant factor in terms of
CTT (P < 0.0001) and WGTT (P < 0.0001) but not
SBTT (P = 0.5930). Intervention period and sequence
were not significant factors, indicating that these factors
did not influence gastrointestinal transit time. Consump-
tion of milk containing both β-casein types was associated
with significantly longer CTT (by 6.6 h, P < 0.0001) and
WGTT (by 6.3 h, P < 0.0001), but not SBTT (−0.20 h,
P = 0.5903) compared with milk containing only the
A2 β-casein type.

 Gastrointestinal inflammation
Smart pill data for gastrointestinal inflammation were
available for 22 subjects in sequence 1 (A1/A2 → A2)
and 18 subjects in sequence 2 (A2 → A1/A2). Between
phases 1 and 2, small bowel inflammation was rated as
improved, unchanged, and worsened in 8 (36.4 %), 14
(63.6 %), and 0 (0 %) subjects, respectively, in sequence
1 (A1/A2 → A2) compared with 2 (11.1 %), 15 (83.3 %),
and 1 (5.6 %) subjects, respectively, in sequence 2
(A2 → A1/A2) (P = 0.042). Between phases 1 and 2,
stomach inflammation was rated as improved, un-
changed and worsened in 5 (22.7 %), 17 (77.3 %), and 0
(0 %) subjects, respectively, in sequence 1 compared
with 2 (11.1 %), 16 (83.3 %), and 0 (0 %) subjects, re-
spectively, in sequence 2 (P = 0.427). These results indi-
cate that small bowel inflammation improved in 36.4 %
of subjects and stomach inflammation improved in
22.7 % of subjects after switching from milk containing
A1/A2 β-casein to milk containing only A2 β-casein. By
contrast, small bowel inflammation and stomach inflam-
mation improved in 11.1 % of subjects after switching
from milk containing A2 β-casein to milk containing A1
and A2 β-casein.
SCIT
Results of the SCIT are presented in Fig. 3a for phase 1
and Fig. 3b for phase 2 for each sequence. Mixed-effects
ANOVA confirmed that the intervention was a signifi-
cant factor in terms of the response time (P = 0.0013)
and error rate (P = 0.0004) for each exposure duration.
Significant intervention effects were also found in the
tail mean response time (P = 0.027) and in the head
mean error rate (P = 0.020) (Table 6). The baseline
values for all SCIT variables were significant covariates,
but no statistically meaningful differences were observed
between intervention periods or sequence.
Subgroup analysis in subjects with confirmed lactose
intolerance
Twenty-three subjects were confirmed to be lactose in-
tolerant based on urinary galactose tests. The baseline
characteristics of these subjects were similar to those of
the lactose tolerant subjects. The weekly total scores for
gastrointestinal symptoms of post-dairy digestive dis-
comfort in subjects with or without lactose intolerance
are presented in Fig. 4. Consumption of milk containing
both β-casein types was associated with significant wors-
ening of gastrointestinal symptoms in lactose intolerant
and lactose tolerant individuals in either sequence. By
contrast, consumption of milk containing only A2 β-
casein was not associated with worsening of gastrointes-
tinal symptoms, as the symptoms were comparable to
those observed after the baseline washout of dairy
products. When we pooled data from both sequences,
the magnitude of the increase in gastrointestinal symp-
tom
scores
following
the
consumption
of
milk
containing both β-casein types tended to be greater in
lactose intolerant subjects than in lactose tolerant sub-
jects, and this was of borderline significance (least
squares mean difference: 1.087; 95 % CI −0.0652, 2.2392;
P = 0.0638). By contrast, the gastrointestinal symptom
score was not significantly different between lactose
intolerant subjects and lactose tolerant subjects after
the consumption of milk containing only the A2 β-
casein
type
(least
squares
mean
difference:
0.494;
95 % CI −0.3247, 1.3128; P = 0.2303). The consump-
tion of milk containing both β-casein types was associated
with significant increases in CTT and WGTT, but not
SBTT, as compared with milk containing only the A2
β-casein type (Table 7).
When data for each sequence were pooled according
to the type of milk consumed, the consumption of milk
containing both β-casein types was associated with

 significant increases in gastrointestinal transit times (see
Additional file 2) as well as significant increases in
serum IL-4, IgE and log IgG1 and decreases in fecal
SCFAs (see Additional file 3).
Adverse events
Thirteen episodes of diarrhea were reported in 10
(22.2 %) of 45 subjects. Eight events occurring in five
subjects were considered related to consumption of milk
containing both β-casein types, three events in three
subjects were considered related to milk containing the
A2 β-casein type, and two events in two subjects were
considered unrelated to the interventions. Other adverse
events included cough and cold in three and two sub-
jects, respectively, but these were not considered related
to the interventions.
Discussion
For this study, we hypothesized that consumption of
milk containing A1 β-casein would result in an increase
in systemic inflammation (as characterized by serum
biomarkers of inflammation) and be associated with
gastrointestinal disorders similar to those of lactose
intolerance in a cohort of subjects with perceived or
confirmed lactose intolerance. We also hypothesized that
elimination of the A1 β-casein type by providing subjects
with milk that only contained the A2 β-casein type
would avoid these effects of A1 β-casein. Consistent with
our
hypothesis,
this
crossover
study
revealed
that
consumption of the milk containing A1 β-casein was as-
sociated with greater gastrointestinal symptoms, higher
concentrations of inflammation-related biomarkers and
lower total fecal short-chain fatty acids, longer transit
time, and longer responses and increased error rates on
the SCIT compared with milk containing only the A2 β-
casein type. Compositionally, the two products were
nearly identical, except for the β-casein content where
one contained only the A2 β-casein type while the ratio
of the A1 and A2 β-casein types was 40:60 in milk
containing both types (approximately 400 and 600 mg
per 100 mL of milk).
The observation that milk containing both types of
β-casein increased serum IL-4 and other inflammatory
markers are consistent with those reported by Ul Haq

 et al. [5]. They reported that A1-like types of β-casein
(A1/A1 and A1/A2) induced inflammatory responses
in the gastrointestinal tract of mice by activating the Th2
pathway, as illustrated by increases in myeloperoxidase,
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, antibodies (IgE,
IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a), and Toll-like receptors 1 and 2,
and increased leukocyte infiltration into the intestine [5].
They also reported that these effects were driven by
BCM-7 and BCM-5 [26]. This cytokine/immune response
reported by Ul Haq et al. and observed in the present
study is also consistent with the intolerance-type reactions
associated with asthma and eczema [27].
Consumption of milk containing both β-casein types
was
also
associated
with
significantly
lower
SCFA
concentrations than the consumption of milk containing
only the A2 β-casein type. These results suggest that A1
β-casein consumption leads to reduced SCFA levels. SCFAs
are fermentation products of gut biota [28] that have anti-
inflammatory effects [29, 30] and enhance colonic cell func-
tion [31]. Accordingly, the consumption of A2 β-casein at
the exclusion of A1 β-casein is expected to support
microbial SCFA production, and hence avoid impairments
in colonic health attributed to low SCFA production.
Gastrointestinal
symptoms
associated
with
the
consumption of milk containing only the A2 β-casein
type and milk containing only the A1 β-casein type
(750 mL/day) were also evaluated in an 8-week cross-
over study conducted by Ho et al. [20]. In that study,
consumption of milk containing the A1 β-casein type was
associated with significantly higher Bristol Stool Scale
scores compared with consumption of milk containing the
A2 β-casein type. Moreover, the abdominal pain score was
significantly correlated with stool consistency when subjects
consumed milk containing the A1 β-casein type (r = 0.520,
P = 0.001) but not milk containing the A2 β-casein type (r
= −0.13, P = 0.43). Similarly, we observed greater gastro-
intestinal symptom scores together with longer gastrointes-
tinal transit times, softer stools, and diarrhea when the
subjects consumed milk containing both β-casein types as
compared with milk containing only the A2 β-casein type.
The results of both studies provide evidence that consump-
tion of milk containing the A1 β-casein type may adversely
affect gastrointestinal function and that exclusion of this
type may alleviate these symptoms.
The present study also revealed that consumption of
milk containing both β-casein types was associated with
longer gastrointestinal transit times, particularly CTT
and WGTT than the consumption of milk containing
only the A2 β-casein type. These results are consistent
with those reported by Barnett et al. in a rodent model
[4]. They used titanium dioxide as a marker for gastro-
intestinal transit time. By contrast, a smart pill was used
in the current study, and allowed us to obtain more
accurate estimates of the total gastrointestinal transit
time, as well as the transit times through specific regions
of the intestine [32].

 The present study revealed that the consumption of
milk containing only the A2 β-casein type was not
associated with worsening of any of the evaluated
variables, and the results obtained after 2 weeks of
consumption were comparable with those at baseline
(i.e., after a 2-week washout of dairy products). In other
words, the A1 β-casein type, but not the A2 β-casein
type, had a negative impact on gastrointestinal function.
Using the smart pill, we also observed an increase
in small bowel inflammation when the subjects con-
sumed milk containing both β-casein types as com-
pared with the consumption of milk containing only
the A2 β-casein type. These results are consistent
with the changes in inflammation-related biomarkers.
However, changes were not apparent in all of the
subjects and the P-value was of borderline signifi-
cance (P = 0.042). It is possible that the intervention
period was too short to elicit inflammation in many
subjects.
Therefore,
these
findings
warrant
further
examination in a larger cohort or with a longer inter-
vention time.
Finally, using the SCIT, we found that consumption of
the milk containing both β-casein types was associated
with small but highly significant increases in response
time and error. The increases in response time were pri-
marily found for the longer stimulus durations (the tail)
while increases in error rate were largely restricted to
the shorter stimulus durations (the head). This suggests
that the consumption of milk containing both β-casein
types is associated with reduced efficiency of precon-
scious automatic processing, but the longer stimulus
duration-controlled processes help to reduce the deficit
in processing efficiency at the cost of processing speed.
This minor impairment of cognitive function can have a
considerable impact in situations where rapid stimulus
detection and/or rapid decision-making are required.
This finding demonstrates that consumption of milk
containing the A1 β-casein type affects more than just
the gastrointestinal system; there are also effects on neural
function. This finding is similar to the cognitive impair-
ment observed in patients with undiagnosed celiac disease
[33], and its explanation may lie with the increases in

 serum inflammation-related markers associated with the
consumption of milk containing both β-casein types
relative to milk containing only the A2 β-casein type.
Elevated levels of circulating inflammatory markers
have been linked to significant impairments in mem-
ory,
attention,
executive
function
and
processing
speed, even after controlling for age and other health-
related factors [34–37].
Many of the symptoms associated with the consump-
tion of A1 β-casein type are also associated with lactose
intolerance [38]. It is notable that lactose intolerance or
lactose malabsorption is comorbid to intestinal inflam-
mation. Therefore, it is feasible that some people with
perceived lactose intolerance may actually show adverse
responses to the A1 β-casein type and peptides formed
by its proteolysis [39, 40].
In the present study, the subjects underwent urinary
galactose tests and about half of the subjects yielded
positive results for lactose intolerance. Therefore, we
compared the effects of both milk products on the se-
verity of gastrointestinal symptoms and gastrointestinal
transit times between subjects with lactose intolerance
and subjects with lactose tolerance. Intriguingly, we
found that the consumption of milk containing both β-
casein types was associated with significant increases in
both symptom severity and gastrointestinal transit times
in both groups of subjects compared with baseline
values. Notably, the observed changes were numerically
greater in lactose intolerant subjects than in lactose tol-
erant subjects. By contrast, the consumption of milk
containing only the A2 β-casein type did not increase
gastrointestinal symptoms compared with the baseline
values obtained after a 2-week washout period. Mean-
while, the increases in gastrointestinal transit times asso-
ciated with the consumption of milk containing both β-
casein types were slightly smaller in lactose intolerant
subjects than in lactose tolerant subjects. However, the
consumption of milk containing the A2 β-casein type
was not associated with marked differences in gastro-
intestinal transit time between the lactose intolerant and
lactose tolerant subjects. These findings suggest that
some of the adverse gastrointestinal effects of dairy
products may be due to the consumption of dairy
containing A1 β-casein [39, 40]. This is because the
consumption of milk containing A2 β-casein did not
worsen these symptoms in lactose intolerant subjects rela-
tive to the baseline values after a washout or compared with
the symptoms in lactose tolerant subjects. Both milk prod-
ucts contained equal amounts of lactose (4.8 %), which re-
inforces the concept that the differences in outcomes were
driven by the presence or absence of A1 β-casein.
Several studies have revealed associations between A1
β-casein/BCM-7 and neurological problems, such as
autism [41–44] and schizophrenia [45–49]. It has also
been reported that elevated BCM-7 immunoreactivity is
associated with delayed psychomotor development in
infants [50]. The present data imply that A1 β-casein
and
its
peptide
derivatives
also
affect
information
processing in the brain. It has also been demonstrated
that food-derived opioid peptides have a variety of direct
effects on neural cells, including the expression of genes
involved in redox and methylation processes, and epi-
genetic regulation [19]. It was postulated that milk-derived
peptides may induce inflammation and systemic oxidation,
including in the central nervous system [19], and these ef-
fects might impact on development or information process-
ing. Further studies are necessary to confirm these effects
and elucidate the underlying pathway.
Some limitations warrant mention. First, the smart pill
was not used at baseline, so it is not possible to determine
whether milk containing only the A2 β-casein type influ-
enced gastrointestinal transit time beyond the effects of
washing out of dairy products. Second, the duration of
each intervention period (2 weeks) may have been too
short to elicit changes in some biomarkers or local inflam-
mation. Therefore, longer interventions may be necessary
to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of milk
containing both β-casein types, as well as the beneficial
effects of milk containing the A2 β-casein type on gastro-
intestinal function. Third, we used milk containing both
the A1 and A2 β-casein types (40:60), because milk
containing only the A1 β-casein type was unavailable.
However, as the A2 β-casein type is thought to be “inert”
in terms of opiate receptor agonism [4], the presence of
A2 β-casein is unlikely to confound the effects or may al-
leviate the potentially deleterious effects of the A1 β-
casein type. Finally, this study focused solely on gastro-
intestinal symptoms, so any additional effects of the inves-
tigated products could not be tested.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that consump-
tion of milk containing A1 β-casein in addition to A2 β-
casein
worsens
gastrointestinal
symptoms,
increases
gastrointestinal transit time, increases serum inflamma-
tion markers, lowers total fecal SCFA content, slows cog-
nitive processing speed and decreases processing accuracy
compared with the baseline values. Consumption of milk
containing only A2 β-casein did not adversely affect these
variables, indicating that the changes observed with milk
containing both β-casein types were attributable to the
presence of A1 β-casein. Furthermore, consumption of
milk containing both types was associated with greater
worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms and gastrointes-
tinal transit time in lactose intolerant subjects than in
lactose tolerant subjects, whereas milk containing only A2
β-casein did not exacerbate these symptoms in lactose
intolerant
subjects.
These
results
