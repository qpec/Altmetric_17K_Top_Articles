Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Obesity-linked ectopic fat accumulation is
associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. Whether
pancreatic and liver steatosis impairs insulin secretion is con-
troversial. We examined the crosstalk of human pancreatic fat
cells with islets and the role of diabetogenic factors, i.e. pal-
mitate and fetuin-A, a hepatokine released from fatty liver.
Methods Human pancreatic resections were immunohis-
tochemically stained for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and
the macrophage/monocyte marker CD68. Pancreatic adipo-
cytes were identified by Oil Red O and adiponectin staining.
Primary pancreatic pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipo-
cytes were co-cultured with human islets isolated from organ
donors and the metabolic crosstalk between fatty liver and
fatty pancreas was mimicked by the addition of palmitate
and fetuin-A. Insulin secretion was evaluated by ELISA and
RIA. Cytokine expression and secretion were assessed by RT-
PCR and multiplex assay, respectively. Subcellular distribu-
tion of proteins was examined by confocal microscopy and
protein phosphorylation by western blotting.
Results In human pancreatic parenchyma, highly differentiat-
ed adipocytes were detected in the proximity of islets with
normal architecture and hormone distribution. Infiltration of
adipocytes was associated with an increased number of CD68-
positive cells within islets. In isolated primary pancreatic pre-
adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes, palmitate and fetuin-
A induced IL6, CXCL8 and CCL2 mRNA expression.
Cytokine production was toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-depen-
dent and further accentuated in pre-adipocytes when co-
cultured with islets. In islets, IL6 and CXCL8 mRNA levels
were also increased by fetuin-A and palmitate. Only in mac-
rophages within the isolated islets, palmitate and fetuin-A
stimulated the production of the cytotoxic cytokine IL-1β.
Palmitate, but not fetuin-A, exerted pro-apoptotic effects in
islet cells. Instead, fetuin-A impaired glucose-induced insulin
secretion in a TLR4-independent, but c-Jun N-terminal
kinase- and Ca2+-dependent, manner.
Conclusions/interpretation These results provide the first ev-
idence that fetuin-A-mediated metabolic crosstalk of fatty liv-
er with islets may contribute to obesity-linked glucose blind-
ness of beta cells, while fatty pancreas may exacerbate local
inflammation.

Introduction
The role of pancreatic steatosis in the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes is currently under discussion and may depend on
additional risk factors [1–3]. Fat accumulation in the pancreas
is associated with reduced insulin secretion in glucose intoler-
ant humans [4]. However, it is controversial whether adipo-
cyte infiltration and altered lipid profiles of pancreatic tissue
affect islet function [4–8].
The secretomes of fatty liver and visceral adipocytes, in-
cluding the hepatokine fetuin-A and NEFA, contribute to the
generation of a diabetogenic milieu [9]. These factors favour
low grade tissue inflammation and insulin resistance [10–14].
The ultimate cause of hyperglycaemia, however, is insuffi-
cient insulin secretion as a consequence of impaired glucose-
induced insulin secretion (GIIS), dedifferentiated beta cells or
beta cell apoptosis [15–20].
NEFA- and cytokine-induced beta cell death has been ex-
tensively studied [10, 21]. Multiple observations suggest that
NEFA induce islet inflammation by stimulation of resident
macrophages via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
[22–25]. In addition, chemokine production (i.e. monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 [MCP-1] and IL-8) within islets attracts
macrophages [22].
Insulin resistance in humans is associated with high levels
of NEFA only in the presence of elevated plasma fetuin-A,
which indicates an interaction between fetuin-A and NEFA
[26, 27]. Besides its inhibitory effect on insulin receptors,
fetuin-A, together with NEFA, induces inflammation in vis-
ceral adipocytes in a TLR4-dependent manner [28–30].
Recent evidence suggests that fetuin-A triggers M1
polarisation of adipose tissue macrophages [31]. However,
fetuin-A, an abundant fetal serum protein, has multiple roles.
As a Ca2+-binding protein it regulates Ca2+-phosphate homeo-
stasis and calcification [32]. Fetuin-A binds NEFA and bacte-
rial endotoxins and is a negative acute phase protein [33, 34].
Using an in vitro co-culture system of isolated human pan-
creatic pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes with is-
lets, we aimed to decipher potential mechanisms by which
fatty liver–fatty pancreas crosstalk impairs islet function.
These mechanisms may reveal the pathogenic relevance of
pancreatic steatosis for glucose homeostasis in humans.
Methods
Measurements of pancreatic fat and insulin secretion in
humans Insulin sensitivity and secretion were assessed in
non-diabetic participants (n = 121) using OGTTs. The anthro-
pometric and metabolic characteristics of the cohort are shown
in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) Table 1.
Impaired glucose tolerance was defined as post-challenge glu-
cose >7.8 mmol/l. Insulin secretion was assessed by the
insulinogenic index (IGI; insulin30 − insulin0 [pmol/l])/
(glucose30 − glucose0 [mmol/l]) or (C-peptide(0–30) [ng/ml])/
(AUC glucose(0–30)). Whole body fat distribution was estimat-
ed by MRI as previously described [4, 35].
Assessment of in vivo beta cell function with the disposi-
tion index The disposition index (IGI × insulin sensitivity
index) provides a measure of beta cell function in vivo, as it
takes the respective insulin sensitivity into account. An OGTT
was conducted before pancreatic surgery, and blood glucose
(mmol/l) and plasma insulin (pmol/l) were measured at 0, 30,
60, 90 and 120 min. The IGI was as described above. Insulin
sensitivity was estimated using the Matsuda index (104/
(G0×I0×(G0+G30+G60+G90+G120)/5)×( I0+I30+I60+I90+I120)/
5)0.5).
Human pancreatic resections and evaluation of pancreatic
steatosis Pancreatic resections (90 individuals, age 57–
75 years, BMI 22.4–27.6 kg/m2) were taken from a tumour-
free region. The fat content of the whole pancreas was esti-
mated by computed tomography (CT) in 26 participants for
whom adipocyte infiltration was histologically characterised.
Regions of interest were drawn in unenhanced axial slices to
determine Hounsfield units (HU) in the head, body and tail of
the pancreas, and the mean was calculated. A fat-free pancreas
exhibits a density of 40–50 HU and adipose tissue about −90
HU.
Human islets and single cell preparation Human islets were
cultured in CMRL-1066 (ESM Table 2). For immunohisto-
chemistry, isolated islet cells were cultured overnight on glass
coverslips coated with human collagen-1 [21]. Treatment with
0.6 mg/ml human fetuin-A (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany), human serum albumin (hSA, as control) and
60 μmol/l palmitate was performed in FCS-free (to avoid
exposure to bovine fetuin-A) culture medium. The concentra-
tions of palmitate and albumin were adapted to the concentra-
tion of 0.6 mg/ml fetuin-A which matches plasma levels in
glucose intolerant humans [36].

 Isolation, culture and differentiation of human pancreatic
pre-adipocytes Pancreatic pre-adipocytes were isolated from
adipose tissue obtained from the pancreatic resections as pre-
viously described [30]. Isolated pre-adipocytes were expand-
ed in DMEM/Ham’s mixture F12 (1:1, ESM Table 2). FACS
analysis with FITC-coupled anti-CD31 and anti-CD14 anti-
bodies (ESM Table 3) precluded contamination with endothe-
lial cells and monocytes/macrophages, respectively.
Adipose conversion was conducted for 7 days in
DMEM/Ham’s mixture F12 (1:1, ESM Table 2). The cells
were terminally differentiated for a further 7 days in medium
without supplements.
Co-culture of human pancreatic fat cells and islets
Pancreatic pre-adipocytes and adipocytes were used at conflu-
ence. Human islets were placed in inserts which allows a
separate analysis of fat cells and islets and media from the
distinct compartments. Mono- and co-cultures were per-
formed for 24 h in FCS-free human islet culture medium sup-
plemented with fetuin-A, hSA and palmitate.
Gene expression Total RNA of islets and fat cells were iso-
lated (Nucleo Spin RNAII, Macherey-Nagel, Dueren,
Germany) and transcribed using random primers
(Transcriptor First Strand kits, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland). PCR primers and probes (Light Cycler 480
System, Roche Diagnostics) are listed in ESM Table 4.
Normalised gene expression was calculated as a ratio of Ct
of target vs housekeeping gene (RPS13) transcripts (2−ΔCt,
ΔCt), changes of expression vs control (2−ΔΔCt, ΔΔCt).
Cytokine and insulin quantification Secreted cytokines
were quantified using the xMAP technology (Luminex,
BioRad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). Bio-Plex Pro
Human Cytokine-1 5-plex EXPRESS-Kit (BioRad
Laboratories) and the Human Luminex Screening Assay
LXSAH-06 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were
used to quantify IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-1β proteins.
Insulin was measured by RIA (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany).
Immunohistochemistry Paraffin-embedded serial sections
from 50 participants were incubated with primary antibodies
(ESM Table 3). H&E was used for counterstaining.
Macrophage/monocyte infiltration was quantified by counting
the CD68-positive cells in islets without adipocytes in their
proximity vs islets neighbouring adipocytes at a distance
<400 μm. Lipids droplets were visualised using Oil Red O
(0.5% in propylene glycol) after fixation of pancreatic cryo-
sections with 4% formalin and dehydration with 100% pro-
pylene glycol.
Human islet cells were fixed with 4% formalin,
permeabilised with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich,
Munich, Germany) and incubated for 1 h in 10% FCS-PBS.
Primary anti-p65NFkB antibody was added overnight and
secondary antibody for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with
1 μmol/l TO-PRO-3. TUNEL staining was performed accord-
ing to the protocol provided with the kit (Roche Diagnostics).
Western blotting Treated islets were lysed in RIPA buffer
(ESM Table 2). Proteins were resolved using 10% SDS-
PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were incubated in 5% (wt/vol.) milk TBS-
Tween 20 overnight with primary antibodies and for 1 h with
a horse radish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (ESM
Table 3).
Isolation, culture and insulin secretion of mouse islets
Wild-type (WT) (C57BL/6NCrl and C3H/HeNCrl) and
TLR4-defective (C3H/HeJ) mouse islets were isolated using
collagenase as previously described [21]. Islets were cultured
in RPMI1640 (ESM Table 2). For macrophage depletion, is-
lets were cultured for 2 days in the presence of 0.5 mg/l
clodronate- or PBS (control)-containing liposomes.
Afterwards, islets were cultured for 24 h or 48 h in FCS-free
medium with fetuin-A, hSA and 10 μmol/l SP600125 (a c-Jun
N-terminal kinase [JNK] inhibitor). Insulin secretion (10 is-
lets/500 μl) was performed in KRB containing: 135 mmol/l
NaCl, 4.8 mmol/l KCl, 1.2 mmol/l Mg2SO4, 1.2 mmol/l
KH2PO4, 1.3 mmol/l CaCl2, 5 mmol/l NaHCO3, 10 mmol/l
HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5% (wt/vol.) BSA (fraction V) and glu-
cose as indicated. Secreted insulin and insulin content after
extraction with acid ethanol (1.5% (vol./vol.) HCl/75% (vol./
vol.) ethanol) were measured by ELISA.
Statistics Human tissue and cell samples were blinded before
use and randomised to the treatment. Islets and islet cells were
randomly distributed between the treatment groups. Statistical
analysis was performed with random-intercept linear mixed
models, using donors as random effects and treatments as
fixed effects. The Tukey honest significant difference (HSD)
test was used as post hoc test. A p value <0.05 was considered
to be significant.
Study approval All experiments with human material were
approved by the Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty
and the University Hospital of the University of Tuebingen
(No. 697/2011BO1 and 355/2012BO2). All participants gave
informed written consent.
Isolation of mouse islets was conducted in accordance with
the accepted standard of animal care and was approved by the
local authorities.

 Results
Negative correlation of pancreatic fat content with insulin
secretion in humans The relevance of pancreatic fat for islet
function was re-evaluated in a well-defined cohort of 121 non-
diabetic humans (Fig. 1a, b). While pancreatic fat content did
not correlate with insulin secretion in individuals with normal
glucose tolerance (Fig. 1a, β = 0.079, p = 0.38; for IGI:
β = 0.068, p = 0.54) it negatively correlated with insulin
secretion in humans with impaired glucose tolerance
(Fig. 1b, β = −1.2, p = 0.0031; for IGI: β = −1.6,
p = 0.0009). This result supports our previous observation [4].
Identification of adipocytes in human pancreatic paren-
chyma Ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas was
characterised in 90 pancreatic resections. Differentiated adi-
pocytes with a large lipid droplet and cytosolic adiponectin
staining infiltrated the pancreatic tissue of 70% of the partic-
ipants (Fig. 1c, d). The histological assessment of adipocyte
infiltration correlated with the degree of pancreatic steatosis
evaluated in the whole organ by CT measurements (ESM Fig.
1). Irrespective of the degree of adipocytes infiltration the
islets displayed a normal architecture (Fig. 1e–g and ESM
Fig. 2a). Most of the cells in the islet core stained for insulin,
while the glucagon-containing cells were located peripherally
in small and randomly in large islets, as previously reported
[37]. A small number of cells stained positive for somatostatin
(Fig. 1g). It is worth mentioning that even neighbouring islets
displayed large variations in the proportion and distribution of
glucagon-positive cells (ESM Fig. 2b).

ferentially stimulated by palmitate, fetuin-A and islets in

 adipose tissue and, following expansion, were differentiated
into adipocytes (ESM Fig. 3). Adipocytes differentiation was
assessed by detection of lipid droplets and ADIPOQ (encoding
adiponectin) mRNA. The pre-adipocyte and adipocyte cultures
were free of macrophages/monocytes, as IL-1β (IL1B) and
TNF-α (TNF) were not detectable (data not shown). Under
control conditions (0.6 mg/ml hSA) the pre-adipocytes and
adipocytes expressed low levels of IL6 (encoding IL-6),
CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL2 (MCP-1; Fig. 2a–f, first columns).
Palmitate and fetuin-A stimulated IL6, CXCL8 and CCL2 ex-
pression in pre-adipocytes and adipocytes, respectively
(Fig. 2a–f). As expected, the cytokine production (IL6,
CXCL8 and CCL2) was completely inhibited by the TLR4
inhibitor CLI-095 (ESM Fig. 4). Further analysis revealed that
mRNA levels of TGFB1 (TGF-β1), TGFB3 (TGF-β3), VEGF
and HGF remained unchanged (ESM Fig. 5).
In order to examine the paracrine crosstalk between human
fat cells and islets an in vitro co-culture system was
established. The co-culture with islets further increased IL6
mRNA levels of pre-adipocytes in the presence of fetuin-A,
alone or with palmitate (Fig. 2g). Concurrently, CXCL8 and
CCL2 mRNA levels were significantly increased by fetuin-A
and palmitate (Fig. 2h, i). The rise in mRNA levels correlated
with increased cytokine secretion enforcing paracrine action
of pre-adipocytes on neighbouring cells (Fig. 2j–l). In contrast

 adipocytes was not altered by islets under all co-culture con-
ditions (data not shown).
These experiments identify the pre-adipocytes and adipo-
cytes as highly active cell populations in the pancreatic paren-
chyma which secrete IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 upon stimulation
with diabetogenic factors.
Macrophages/monocytes infiltrate islets more abundantly
in proximity to adipocytes Since fat cells produce chemo-
attractants, IL-8 and MCP-1, we next analysed whether pan-
creatic steatosis is associated with increased local inflamma-
tion. In human pancreatic resections, a significantly higher
number of CD68-positive macrophages/monocytes were
found in the islets located in proximity to adipocytes (Fig.
3a–c). The mRNA analysis of laser-captured islets from pan-
creatic resections revealed a low expression of IL1B mRNA
irrespective of the degree of pancreatic steatosis (Fig. 3d). In
isolated islets from organ donors, comparable amounts of
IL1B mRNA were detected (Fig. 3e, first column). Fetuin-A
increased IL1B expression in isolated islets fourfold, an effect
which was further augmented by the co-culture with pre-
adipocytes in the presence of fetuin-A and palmitate (Fig.
3e, hatched bars).
Upon treatment of isolated islets with clodronate liposomes
which selectively depleted resident macrophages, fetuin-A-
induced expression of IL1B was lost, while INS (encoding
insulin) and CCL2 mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig.
3f–h). Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 signalling by CLI-095
(5 μmol/l) completely blocked fetuin-A-induced stimulation
of IL1B and IL6 expression, whereas CCL2 mRNA levels
were again not altered (Fig. 3i–k).
These observations suggest that pancreatic fat cells may
accentuate macrophage/monocyte infiltration via a local pro-
duction of IL-8 and MCP-1. The macrophages/monocytes,
however, only secrete cytotoxic cytokines upon exposure to
an adequate stimulus.
Similar to the stimulatory effect of fetuin-A and palmitate on
IL6 and CXCL8 mRNA levels in fat cells, a minor but consistent
increase was detectable in isolated islets (ESM Fig. 6f, g). Fetuin-
A reduced SLC2A2 (encoding GLUT-2) expression, while TNF,
CCL2, BLC2, TGFB1, TGFB3, VEGF and HGF mRNA levels
were not altered (ESM Fig. 6). The co-culture with neither pre-
adipocytes nor adipocytes affected islet mRNA levels, i.e. INS,
GCG, SST, PDX1 and IRS2 (ESM Fig. 7).
Fetuin-a exerts TLR4-independent effects in islet cells
Insufficient insulin secretion during obesity is thought to result
from a reduced beta cell mass due to increased beta cell apo-
ptosis. In isolated human islet cells the apoptotic rate was
enhanced by palmitate (Fig. 4a). Fetuin-A did not amplify
but reversed the cytotoxic effect of palmitate. The analysis
of the underlying signalling pathways suggests that, in con-
trast to the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS), palmitate
and fetuin-A, alone and together, triggered neither nuclear
accumulation of NF-κB nor NF-κB phosphorylation at ser-
ine536 (Fig. 4b–e). A further indication that fetuin-A exerts
TLR4-independent effects in islets was the stimulation of JNK
phosphorylation in the presence of CLI-095 (Fig. 4f, g).
Additional evidence for a TLR4-independent effect of
fetuin-A was corroborated using TLR4-deficient mouse islets
(Fig. 5). In agreement with the observation made in human
islets, fetuin-A increased phosphorylation of JNK both in WT
and TLR4-deficient mouse islets (Fig. 5a, b). The stimulation
of JNK occurred in the absence of cytokines, since TLR4
deficiency abrogated the fetuin-A-induced increase of Il1b
and Il6 mRNA levels (Fig. 5c, d).
Next, we examined the effect of fetuin-A on insulin secre-
tion in isolated islets from WTand TLR4-defective mice (Fig.
5e). Fetuin-A inhibited both GIIS and exendin-4-mediated
augmentation of secretion in a TLR4-independent manner
(Fig. 5e). When JNK was inhibited by SP600125 (10 μmol/l
during 2 days of fetuin-A treatment), fetuin-A-mediated inhi-
bition of GIIS was completely abrogated suggesting that JNK
conveys the negative effect of fetuin-A on secretion (Fig. 5f).
Previously, the inhibitory effect of JNK on GIIS has been
linked to a reduced glucose-induced Ca2+ influx [38]. Since
fetuin-A is a Ca2+-binding protein, we examined whether an
increase of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration improves
GIIS of fetuin-A-treated islets. The elevation of the extracel-
lular Ca2+ concentration from 1.3 to 2.6 mmol/l augmented
GIIS and antagonised the inhibitory effect of fetuin-A in
mouse islets (Fig. 6a).
In isolated islets from human organ donors, the elevation of
glucose from 2.8 to 12 mmol/l, the doubling of the concentra-
tion of extracellular CaCl2 and the addition of palmitate
(600 μmol/l) significantly increased insulin secretion in con-
trol islets (Fig. 6b). In islets exposed to fetuin-A, GIIS was
abrogated and the stimulatory effect of CaCl2 was significant-
ly impaired (Fig. 6b). Palmitate-mediated stimulation of insu-
lin secretion remained unaltered by fetuin-A. That fetuin-A
affects beta cell function in vivo is further suggested by the
negative correlation of plasma fetuin-A levels with the dispo-
sition index which adjusts insulin secretion for insulin sensi-
tivity (Fig. 6c, R2 = 0.45; p = 0.033).
These results strongly suggest that fetuin-A, by stimulating
JNK and interfering with the Ca2+ homeostasis, compromises
glucose sensitivity of human and mouse beta cells.
Discussion
This study highlights the role of metabolic crosstalk between
the pancreas and liver in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Not only are the beta cells directly targeted by diabetogenic
factors, i.e. palmitate and fetuin-A, but so are the pancreatic
pre-adipocytes and adipocytes.

 Pre-adipocytes and adipocytes contribute to pancreatic in-
flammation In this study we isolated pre-adipocytes and ad-
ipocytes from human pancreatic resections and characterised
their proinflammatory potential. The isolation and in vitro
differentiation enabled us to identify the pre-adipocytes as
further operators of tissue inflammation. Interestingly, in co-
culture experiments the islets augmented the inflammatory
response of pre-adipocytes. While insulin is a mandatory
factor for adipocyte differentiation, local inflammation was
also proposed to sustain adipogenesis [39, 40]. This could
explain why highly differentiated adipocytes were detected
throughout the pancreas.
Fetuin-A and palmitate induced chemokine (MCP-1 and
IL-8) and cytokine (IL-6) production in human pancreatic
pre-adipocytes and adipocytes. These findings reveal the fatty
liver as an important player in fat cell inflammation and are in

 agreement with our previous studies using perivascular fat
cells and the proposed proinflammatory effect of fetuin-A
and palmitate via TLR4 stimulation [29, 30]. Thus, diabetes-
associated factors, i.e. fetuin-A and NEFA, are putative potent
activators of pancreatic fat cells.
In pancreatic resections, the adipocyte infiltration per se
was not associated with altered islet architecture.
Furthermore, the co-culture of islets with adipocytes and
pre-adipocytes did not impair insulin secretion. In situ evalu-
ation of CD68-positive macrophages/monocytes in pancreatic
resections suggested a positive correlation between the num-
ber of macrophages/monocytes within islets and the degree of
steatosis. This result suggests that the fat cells, upon
stimulation by fetuin-A and palmitate, augment macrophage/
monocyte infiltration via MCP-1 and IL-8. In agreement, a
correlation of pancreatic steatosis with reduced insulin secre-
tion is observed in humans with impaired glucose tolerance
and fatty liver, the main source of fetuin-A and palmitate (Fig.
1 and [4, 8, 36]). Furthermore, this could be a reason why
pancreatic fat is not a diabetes risk factor per se but depends
on additional risk factors [3].

macrophages through TLR4 It is well documented that
beta cell death is triggered by cytotoxic cytokines

 type 2 diabetic individuals [19, 44]. Fetuin-A stimulated
IL-1β expression in islets, and the effect was mediated by
TLR4. The loss of IL-1β expression in human and mouse
islets depleted of macrophages strongly suggests that
fetuin-A-induced inflammation is exerted on resident
macrophages, not on endocrine cells. Indeed, in human
pancreatic resections, CD68-positive macrophages/
monocytes infiltrated the islets. In addition, we found no
evidence that fetuin-A activates NF-κB in human islet
cells, although a proinflammatory, TLR4-, JNK- and
NF-κB-dependent effect of fetuin-A was recently ascribed
to insulin secreting cells [45]. In agreement with our ob-
servations, another study identified islet resident macro-
phages as a source of cytokine production upon stimula-
tion with TLR2/4 agonists [23]. Of note, fetuin-A binds
LPS and NEFA with high affinity [33, 34, 46]. Although a
fetuin-A preparation of high quality was used, it still
contained low but detectable amounts of LPS (data not
shown). Further experimental evidence is required to un-
derstand the mechanism how NEFA and LPS interact with
fetuin-A to stimulate TLR4.
TLR4-independent and JNK-mediated inhibition of insu-
lin secretion by fetuin-AThe stimulation of IL-6 production
by fetuin-A was TLR4-dependent and might augment insulin
secretion [47]. The use of TLR4-defective mice enabled us
to dissociate the inhibitory action of fetuin-A on insulin
secretion from its effects on inflammation. The inhibition
of insulin secretion by fetuin-A was TLR4-independent and
implied JNK activation and the impairment of cellular Ca2+
homeostasis, since it was abolished by the JNK inhibitor
SP600125 and by elevation of extracellular Ca2+ concentra-
tion. Accordingly, mice with constitutively active JNK in
their beta cells displayed impaired GIIS and glucose intoler-
ance [48]. Activation of JNK may indeed inhibit insulin
secretion by reduction of Ca2+ influx [38]. In agreement

 with our findings, fetuin-A impaired insulin secretion of the
murine cell line βTC6 [45]. Clinical data showing reduced
insulin secretion in humans with increased levels of fetuin-A
and the negative correlation between plasma fetuin-A and
the disposition index (Fig. 6c), a variable for beta cell func-
tion adjusted for insulin sensitivity, support the inhibitory
effect of fetuin-A on GIIS [27, 49]. In line with a negative
effect of fetuin-A on secretion, fetal islets, that are exposed
to higher concentrations of fetuin-A than adult islets, are less
responsive to glucose [50]. Whether a twofold increase of
plasma fetuin-A concentrations – such as can be observed in
individuals with hepatic steatosis – is sufficient to impair
GIIS in humans remains to be clarified.
In conclusion, these results suggest that the fatty liver-
derived fetuin-A impairs GIIS via a direct, TLR4-independent
effect on beta cells and accentuates, in a TLR4-dependent man-
ner, pancreatic inflammation by triggering a proinflammatory
response in the pancreatic fat cells and islet macrophages/
monocytes (Fig. 7). These events may accelerate beta cell fail-
ure and the progression towards overt type 2 diabetes.
