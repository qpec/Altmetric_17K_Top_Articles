IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of immune signatures identifying patients with human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive invasive breast cancer (IBC) at risk for
treatment failure following trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether circulating anti-HER2 CD4-positive (CD4+) T-helper type 1
(Th1) immunity correlates with recurrence in patients with completely treated HER2-positive
IBC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Hypothesis-generating exploratory translational
analysis at a tertiary care referral center of patients with completely treated HER2-positive
IBC with median (interquartile range) follow-up of 44 (31) months. Anti-HER2 Th1 responses
were examined using peripheral blood mononuclear cells pulsed with 6 HER2-derived class
II–promiscuous peptides via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot assay.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES T-helper type 1 response metrics were anti-HER2
responsivity, repertoire (number of reactive peptides), and cumulative response across 6
peptides (spot-forming cells [SFCs]/106 cells). Anti-HER2 Th1 responses in treatment-naive
patients (used as an immunologic baseline) were compared with those in patients completing
trastuzumab and chemotherapy; in the latter group, analyses were stratified by recurrence
status. Recurrence was defined as any locoregional or distant breast event, or both. Cox
regression analysis estimated the instantaneous hazard of recurrence (ie, disease-free
survival [DFS]) stratified by anti-HER2 Th1 responsivity.
RESULTS In 95 women with HER2-positive IBC (median [range] age, 49 [24-85] years; 22
treatment-naive, 73 treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy), depressed anti-HER2 Th1
responsivity (recurrence, 2 of 25 [8%], vs nonrecurrence, 40 of 48 [83%]; P < .001), mean (SD)
repertoire (0.1 [0.1] vs 1.5 [0.2]; P < .001), and mean (SD) cumulative response (14.8 [2.0] vs
80.2 [11.0] SFCs/106 cells; P < .001) were observed in patients incurring recurrence (n = 25)
compared with patients without recurrence (n = 48). After controlling for confounding,
anti-HER2 Th1 responsivity remained independently associated with recurrence (P < .001).
This immune disparity was mediated by anti-HER2 CD4+T-bet+IFN-γ+ (Th1)—not
CD4+GATA-3+IFN-γ+ (Th2) or CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ (Treg)—phenotypes, and not attributable to
immune incompetence. When stratifying trastuzumab plus chemotherapy-treated patients by
Th1 responsivity, Th1-nonresponsive patients demonstrated a worse DFS (median, 47 vs 113
months; P < .001) compared with Th1-responsive patients (hazard ratio, 16.9 [95% CI, 3.9-71.4];
P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Depressed anti-HER2 Th1 response is a novel immune
correlate to recurrence in patients with completely treated HER2-positive IBC. These data
underscore a role for immune monitoring in patients with HER2-positive IBC to identify
vulnerable populations at risk of treatment failure.

A
lthough human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)-targetedtherapies,incombinationwithchemo-
therapy, have dramatically improved survival in HER2-
positive breast cancer (BC),1 a substantial proportion of these
patients develop resistance and ultimately experience recur-
rence.2 Immune signatures identifying patients at risk for such
treatment failure are lacking. We recently demonstrated a pro-
gressive loss in anti-HER2 CD4-positive (CD4+) T-helper type 1
(Th1) immunity across a tumorigenesis continuum in HER2-
positive BC, extending from healthy donors, through patients
withHER2-positiveductalcarcinomainsitu,andultimatelypa-
tientswithHER2-positiveinvasiveBC(IBC).3Additionally,anti-
HER2 Th1 response emerged as a novel immune correlate to
pathologic response following neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus
chemotherapy in HER2-positive BC.4 In light of these observa-
tions, we hypothesized that anti-HER2 Th1 immunity may be
associatedwithdiseaserecurrence.Inanexploratorycohort,we
examineddifferencesincirculatinganti-HER2Th1immunitybe-
tweenrecurrentanddisease-freeHER2-positiveIBCpatientsin
order to identify immune correlates to recurrence.
Methods
Study Design
On approval by the institutional review board of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, 95 patients with HER2-positive BC were
recruited prospectively in a nonbiased fashion after written in-
formed consent was obtained. Eligible patients had histologi-
callyconfirmedIBC,ERBB2(formerlyHER2orHER2/neu)over-
expression(3+[n = 82]or2+/fluorescenceinsituhybridization
positive [n = 13]), and were not receiving immunosuppres-
sive medications. Anti-HER2 Th1 responses in treatment-
naive (no definitive therapy at enrollment) patients with stage
I to III HER2-positive IBC (n = 22) were compared with Th1 re-
sponsesinpatientswithstageItoIVHER2-positiveIBC(n = 73)
who had completed trastuzumab plus chemotherapy treat-
ment—eitherneoadjuvant(n = 37;immuneresponsesfromthis
cohort have been reported previously4) or adjuvant trastu-
zumab plus chemotherapy (n = 36) plus definitive surgery
(schedulesanddosingoftrastuzumabpluschemotherapyregi-
mens are presented in the eMethods in the Supplement). In
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy–treated patients, analyses
were stratified by recurrence status. Although recurrence sta-
tus was known at study enrollment, evaluation and analysis
of anti-HER2 Th1 responses was blinded to this information.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive–
confirmed recurrences were defined as any locoregional or
distant breast event. Patients incurring recurrence were
enrolled prior to initiation of second-line chemotherapy,
HER2-targeted therapy, or experimental (eg, HER2–pulsed
dendritic cell vaccination) protocols. Patients without recur-
rence were eligible for analysis only if disease-free interval
was 24 months at minimum (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Immune Response Detection
Anti-HER2 responses were examined in unexpanded periph-
eralbloodmononuclearcells(PBMCs)pulsedexvivowith6vali-
datedHER2-derivedmajorhistocompatibilitycomplexclassII–
promiscuous peptides,5 by measuring interferon-γ (IFN-γ),
interleukin-4(IL-4),orIL-10productionviaenzyme-linkedim-
munospot assay, as previously described (eMethods in the
Supplement).3,4,6 Specifically, PBMCs were incubated with
either HER2 peptides (4 μg; Genscript), media alone (unstimu-
lated control), or positive control (anti–human CD3/CD28 an-
tibodies[0.5μg/mL;BDPharmingen])at37°Cfor36to48hours.
In evaluable patients, Th1 responses to 1:100-diluted re-
call stimuli Candida albicans (Allermed Laboratories) and teta-
nus toxoid (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) whole proteins were
examined.3 Anti-HER2 Th1 reactivity was determined using
empirical methodology as described previously.3,4 Positive/
reactive response to a HER2 peptide was defined as at least 20
spot-forming cells (SFCs)/2 × 105 PBMCs in experimental wells
after subtraction of unstimulated background. Three metrics
of immune response were measured: (1) responsivity (propor-
tion of patients responding to ≥1 of 6 peptides), (2) repertoire
(mean number of reactive peptides), and (3) cumulative re-
sponse across 6 peptides (SFCs/106 cells).

Statistical Analysis
Descriptivestatisticssummarizeddistributionsofpatientchar-
acteristics and immune response variables. Comparisons be-
tween nonrecurrent and recurrent HER2-positive IBC co-
horts were performed as indicated: (1) 2-group/univariate
testing:unpairedttest(parametriccontinuous),Wilcoxonrank-
sum test (nonparametric continuous), and χ2 tests (categori-
cal); (2) more than 2–group testing: 1-way analysis of variance
with post hoc Bonferroni testing. Variables with P < .10 on uni-
variate testing were entered into a forward, stepwise multi-
variable logistic regression model (P < .05 for entry) to deter-
mine independent correlates to recurrence (binary outcome
yes/no). Missing data for postneoadjuvant pathologic re-
sponse status (n = 36) and lymphovascular invasion (n = 12)
were imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
Five imputation data sets were created and 5 sets of analyses
were combined per the formula of Rubin.
At a Glance
• We investigated whether circulating anti–human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) CD4+ T-helper type 1 (Th1)
immunity correlates with disease recurrence (locoregional,
distant, or both) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients who
have completed HER2-targeted (ie, trastuzumab) therapy.
• Anti-HER2 T-cell responses were depressed in patients incurring
recurrence compared with disease-free patients (P < .001).
• HER2 Th1 responsivity remained independently associated with
recurrence (P < .001), and Th1-nonresponsive patients
demonstrated a worse disease-free survival (median, 47 vs 113
months; P < .001) vs Th1-responsive patients.
• Immune monitoring in completely treated HER2-positive
patients may identify populations at risk of clinicopathologic
failure.

Univariate DFS estimates were examined by Kaplan-
Meier methodology, stratifying by anti-HER2 Th1 responsiv-
ity and other covariates. Observations of patients without re-
currence (minimum 24 month follow-up) were censored at last
known follow-up. To analyze the instantaneous hazard of all
variables and control for varied follow-up, Cox proportional
hazards modeling was performed. The assumptions of the Cox
model were assessed, including interactions and proportion-
ality of hazards over time. P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. All tests were 2 sided. Analyses were per-
formed using SPSS, version 22 (IBM Corp).
Results
Patient Characteristics
Demographic and tumor-related characteristics of the overall
cohort(n = 95,allfemale)aredetailedineTable1intheSupple-
ment. In trastuzumab plus chemotherapy–treated patients
(n = 73), median (range) age was 49 (24-85) years; a majority
of patients had estrogen receptor–positive/progesterone re-
ceptor–positive tumors (43 [59%]) and presented with locally
advanced/node-positive disease (clinical stage I, 7 [10%]; stage
II,35[48%];stageIII,31[42%]).Neoadjuvanttrastuzumabplus
chemotherapywasadministeredin37(51%)patients,anddoxo-
rubicin-cyclophosphamide-paclitaxel-trastuzumab was the
commonly used regimen (49 [67%]) (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). Simple or modified radical mastectomy was per-
formed most frequently (39 [53%]).
Twenty-five of 73 (34%) patients incurred either locore-
gional recurrence, distant recurrence, or both (eTable 2 in the
Supplement);Th1responsesinamajority(21[84%])ofthesepa-
tients were determined at the time of diagnosis of recurrence.
Depression of Anti-HER2 Th1 Responses in Patients
With HER2-Positive IBC Incurring Recurrence
Anti-HER2 Th1 responsivity, repertoire, and cumulative re-
sponses were compared between treatment-naive (n = 22),
trastuzumabpluschemotherapy–treatednonrecurrent(n = 48),
and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy–treated patients with re-
current disease (n = 25). Using anti-HER2 Th1 responses from
treatment-naive patients as an immunologic “baseline,” sig-
nificantly depressed anti-HER2 Th1 responsivity (treatment-
naive, 8 [36%], vs recurrence, 2 [8%], vs nonrecurrence, 40
[83%]; P < .001), mean (SD) repertoire (0.6 [0.2] vs 0.1 [0.1] vs
1.5 [0.2]; P < .001), and mean (SD) cumulative response
(32.8 [4.7] vs 14.8 [2.0] vs 80.2 [11.0] SFCs/106 cells; P < .001)
were observed in patients incurring recurrence compared with
disease-free patients (Figure 1A).
Interferon-γ+ responses to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimula-
tion (P = .57) (Figure 1B) or tetanus (P = .41) and Candida
(P = .74) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement) did not differ signifi-
cantlybetweenthenonrecurrenceandrecurrencecohorts,sug-
gesting that the observed anti-HER2 Th1 disparity is not at-
tributable to immune incompetence or host-level T-cell anergy
in patients with recurrent disease. Decreased mean (SEM) pro-
portions of HER2-specific CD4+T-bet+IFN-γ+ (0.25 [0.1%] vs
0.02 [0.01%]; P = .04), but not CD4+GATA-3+IFN-γ+ or
CD4+GATA-3+IFN-γ-, phenotypes were observed in the recur-
rence compared with nonrecurrence cohort, respectively
(Figure 1C).
Neither HER2-stimulated IL-4+ measures of Th2 func-
tion (eFigure 3A in the Supplement), HER2-stimulated IL-10+
measures of Treg function (eFigure 3B in the Supplement), nor
relative proportions of circulating Treg (ie, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+)
phenotypes (Figure 1D) differed between nonrecurrence and
recurrence cohorts.
Association of Anti-HER2 Th1 Responsivity
With Disease-Free Survival
Next, independence of the association between anti-HER2 Th1
response and recurrence was examined. On univariate test-
ing, recurrence and nonrecurrence cohorts did not differ by
age, menopausal status, race, body mass index, comorbidity,
stage, estrogen receptor–positive/progesterone receptor–
positive status, lymphovascular invasion, nuclear grade, or
need for mastectomy. However, recurrence was more fre-
quent among patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab plus
chemotherapy (P = .02) and those with residual disease fol-
lowing neoadjuvant therapy (P = .006). When controlling for
these variables via multivariable regression, anti-HER2 Th1 re-
sponsivity (P < .001), but not trastuzumab plus chemo-
therapy sequence (P = .14) or pathologic response (P = .76), re-
mained independently associated with recurrence (eTable 3
in the Supplement).
Stratifying the analytic cohort by anti-HER2 Th1 respon-
sivity at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 44 (28-
59) months, Th1-nonresponsive patients demonstrated a sig-
nificantly worse disease-free survival (median, 47 vs 113
months;P < .001)comparedwithTh1-responsivepatients;this
association was corroborated by Cox modeling (hazard ratio
for Th1 nonresponsive cohort, 16.9 [95% CI, 3.9-71.4]; P < .001)
(Figure 2).
Discussion
In this hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis, circulat-
ing anti-HER2 CD4+ Th1 response emerges as a novel immune
correlate to breast cancer recurrence in patients with com-
pletelytreatedHER2-positiveIBC.Whilenotattributabletoim-
mune incompetence, depressed anti-HER2 T-cell responses in
patients with recurrent disease were driven predominantly by
Th1 phenotypes. When relevant clinicopathologic factors were
controlled for, anti-HER2 Th1 responsivity was indepen-
dently associated with recurrence; on risk-adjusted analysis,
Th1-nonresponsive patients demonstrated worse disease-
free survival compared with Th1-responsive patients. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an association be-
tween disease recurrence and a host-level immune correlate
specific to an oncodriver in breast tumorigenesis.
These data are intriguing in the light of evidence suggest-
ing that benefit from trastuzumab therapy—both in the
adjuvant7 and neoadjuvant8 setting—may be restricted to im-
mune-enriched tumors, with Th1 genes IFN-γ and tumor ne-
crosis factor imparting a particularly dominant role.7 Alto-

gether, it appears that absent tumor-level Th1 gene expression,
as well as deficient circulating anti-HER2 Th1 immunity, may
presage failure of HER2-targeted therapy. Monitoring pa-
tients with completely treated HER2-positive BC for real-
time fluctuations in anti-HER2 Th1 immunity may reveal vul-
nerable populations at risk of relapse and identify critical
opportunities for therapeutic intervention, such as anti-
HER2 Th1-directed immune interventions.4

Since immune responses were examined at the time of
recurrence, it remains unclear whether anti-HER2 Th1 immu-
nity in these patients remained suppressed following comple-
tion of index trastuzumab therapy or declined contempor-
aneously with development of recurrence; longitudinal
surveillance of anti-HER2 Th1 responses is required. Other
limitations warrant emphasis. These findings should be inter-
preted as hypothesis generating and warrant large-scale vali-
dation; this study did not address other HER2-targeted agents
(eg, lapatinib, pertuzumab); the relative preponderance of
patients with locally advanced disease in our cohort may
diminish applicability in early-stage disease; and finally, while
the case for anti-HER2 Th1 immune monitoring is compelling,
our study is unable to establish numerical thresholds for such
monitoring or correlations between the depth of immune
depression and recrudescent tumor burden.
Conclusions
Depressed anti-HER2 Th1 response is a novel immune corre-
late to recurrence in patients with completely treated HER2-
positive IBC. These data underscore a role for immune moni-
toringinpatientswithHER2-positiveIBCtoidentifyvulnerable
populations at risk of treatment failure.
