abstract
OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in the prevalence of 15 HIV/AIDS sex and drug risk behaviors 
in delinquent youth during the 14 years after they leave detention, focusing on sex and 
racial/ethnic differences.
METHODS: The Northwestern Juvenile Project, a prospective longitudinal study of 1829 
youth randomly sampled from detention in Chicago, Illinois, recruited between 1995 and 
1998 and reinterviewed up to 11 times. Independent interviewers assessed HIV/AIDS risk 
behaviors using the National Institutes on Drug Abuse Risk Behavior Assessment.
RESULTS: Fourteen years after detention (median age, 30 years), one-quarter of males and 
one-tenth of females had >1 sexual partner in the past 3 months. One-tenth of participants 
reported recent unprotected vaginal sex with a high-risk partner. There were many sex and 
racial/ethnic differences. For example, African American males had 4.67 times the odds of 
having >1 partner than African American females (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.22–6.76). 
Over time, compared with non-Hispanic white males, African American males had 2.56 
times the odds (95% CI, 1.97–3.33) and Hispanic males had 1.63 times the odds (95% CI, 
1.24–2.12) of having multiple partners, even after adjusting for incarceration and age. 
Non-Hispanic white females were more likely to have multiple partners than racial/ethnic 
minority females.
CONCLUSIONS: Although rates decrease over time, prevalence of sex risk behaviors are 
much higher than the general population. Among males, racial/ethnic minorities were 
at particular risk. The challenge for pediatric health is to address how disproportionate 
confinement of racial/ethnic minority youth contributes to disparities in the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic.

HIV/AIDS Risk Behaviors After Youth Leave Detention: A 14-
Year Longitudinal Study. Pediatrics. 2017;139(2):e20160360
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Detained youth 
initiate HIV/AIDS risk behaviors at younger ages and 
report more risk behaviors than those in the general 
population. Yet, we know little about the prevalence 
and patterns of risk behaviors after youth leave 
detention and age into adulthood.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Although rates decrease 
over time, sex risk behaviors remain prevalent 
among detained youth as they age, especially 
among racial/ethnic minority males. The pediatric 
community must address how disproportionate 
confi
 nement of racial/ethnic minority youth 
contributes to HIV/AIDS health disparities.

HIV and other sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs) disproportionately 
affect young people. Although 
persons aged 13 to 29 years comprise 
23% of the US population, 
 
1 they 
accounted for 39.9% of all new HIV 
infections in 2014. 
2 Moreover, those 
aged 25 to 29 years are the only age 
group to have an increase in the 
number of new infections over the 
past 4 years. 
2
Delinquent youth are an especially 
high-risk population, reporting 
more risk behaviors and initiating 
them at younger ages than youth 
in the general population. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
15 The 
Northwestern Juvenile Project 
found that 95% of newly detained 
youth reported engaging in ≥3 risk 
behaviors. 
15 HIV/AIDS risk behaviors 
were prevalent, irrespective of sex, 
race/ethnicity, or age.15
Despite their importance, we know 
little about the prevalence and 
patterns of risk behaviors after youth 
leave detention. We searched the 
literature for longitudinal studies 
of delinquent youth, defined as 
a follow-up of ≥2 years, finding 
only 3 studies. 
10, 
 
16, 
 
17 Although all 
found that HIV/AIDS risk behaviors 
persisted with age, the studies 
examined only a few risk behaviors 
or followed participants only through 
adolescence. 
10, 
16, 
 
17
This omission is critical. Racial/
ethnic minorities, especially African 
Americans, are overrepresented 
in the juvenile justice system 
18, 
 
19 
and suffer disproportionately from 
HIV/AIDS. 
2, 
 
20 Although African 
American youth comprise only 15% 
of the general population aged 13 
to 29 years, 
1 they comprised 39% 
of incarcerated youth and young 
adults 
21, 
 
22 and 51.7% of new HIV 
infections in that age group in 2014. 
2 
Moreover, studies of adult inmates 
indicated that delinquent youth are 
at great risk for contracting HIV/
AIDS as they age: HIV/AIDS risk 
behaviors are prevalent in adult 
male and female inmates, 
 
23, 
24 and the 
prevalence of confirmed AIDS cases 
among adult prisoners is 2.4 times 
higher than among adults in the 
general US population. 
25
The Northwestern Juvenile Project, 
the first large-scale longitudinal 
study of HIV/AIDS risk in delinquent 
youth during adulthood, has 
methodological strengths that 
address the limitations of previous 
investigations: (1) a comprehensive 
measure of 15 HIV/AIDS risk 
behaviors; (2) a lengthy follow-up 
period (14 years) to a median age 
of 30 years; and (3) a large sample, 
sufficiently diverse to examine 
females, a group increasingly 
involved in the justice system, 
 
22, 
 
26, 
 
27 
and disparities among racial/ethnic 
minorities (African Americans and 
Hispanics). We examine changes in 
the prevalence of sex and drug risk 
behaviors during the 14 years after 
youth leave detention, focusing on 
sex and racial/ethnic differences.
METHODS
The most relevant information on 
our methods is summarized in this 
section. Additional information, 
available in the Supplemental 
Materials, was published 
elsewhere. 
15, 
 
28
Sample and Procedures
We recruited a stratified random 
sample of 1829 youth at intake to 
the Cook County Juvenile Temporary 
Detention Center (CCJTDC) in 
Chicago, Illinois, between November 
20, 1995 and June 14, 1998. The 
CCJTDC is used for pretrial detention 
and for offenders sentenced for 
<30 days. To ensure adequate 
representation of key subgroups, 
we stratified our sample by sex, 
race/ethnicity (African American, 
non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or 
other), age (10–13 years or 14–18 
years), and legal status (processed 
in juvenile or adult court). Face-
to-face structured interviews were 
conducted at the detention center 
in a private area, most within 2 days 
of intake. We followed the 1829 
participants for the next 14 years.
At baseline, we received funding to 
administer the HIV/AIDS measure 
to the last 800 participants enrolled 
(460 boys and 340 girls). The entire 
sample was reinterviewed 3, 5, 6, 8, 
12, and 14 years after the baseline 
interview (referred to hereafter 
as “after detention”). In addition, 
a random subsample of 997 youth 
(600 boys and 397 girls) were 
reinterviewed 3.5 and 4 years after 
detention. The last 800 participants 
enrolled at baseline (460 boys and 
340 girls) were reinterviewed 10, 
11, and 13 years after detention 
(our design was determined, in part, 
by the funding that was available). 
Participants were interviewed 
whether they lived in the community 
or in correctional facilities; 80% 
of participants had an interview at 
year 14 (105 had died, 81 refused 
to participate, and 180 could not be 
located in time for the interview).
Procedures to Obtain Assent and 
Consent at Baseline and Follow-up
For all interviews, participants 
signed either an assent form (<18 
years old) or a consent form (≥18 
years old). The Institutional Review 
Boards of Northwestern University 
and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention approved all study 
procedures and waived parental 
consent for persons <18 years, 
consistent with federal regulations 
regarding research with minimal 
risk. 
29
Measures and Variables
HIV/AIDS risk behaviors were 
assessed using the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse Risk Behavior 
Assessment, a reliable and valid 
measure of drug and sex risk 
behaviors. 
30 
– 
32 We supplemented the 
Risk Behavior Assessment with items 
from Yale’s AIDS Risk Inventory. 
33 All 
HIV/AIDS risk variables are binary 
and assessed via self-report.

We assessed the following variables: 
multiple partners (>1 or >3); 
unprotected vaginal sex; unprotected 
anal sex (all assessed for the 3 
months before the interview); sex 
while drunk or high; traded sex 
for drugs; and shared needles or 
equipment for injection drug use or 
tattooing (assessed for the 2 years 
before the interview).
As youth age into young adulthood, 
they are more likely to have an 
exclusive sexual relationship 
with a primary partner and thus 
stop using protection. Therefore, 
beginning with the 10-year follow-up 
interview, we added the following 
behaviors (assessed 3 months 
before the interview): unprotected 
vaginal sex with a high-risk partner; 
unprotected anal sex with a high-
risk partner; unprotected sex while 
drunk or high; and sex while drunk 
or high with a high-risk partner. As 
in previous studies, 
 
34, 
 
35 a “high-risk 
partner” refers to someone whom 
the participant identified as having 
worked as a prostitute, having HIV or 
AIDS, having injected drugs, or whose 
sexual history the participant did 
not know well (unless specified, risk 
behaviors may have been protected 
or unprotected).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted by 
using commercial software (Stata 
version 12, Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX) with its survey routines. 
To generate prevalence estimates 
and inferential statistics that reflect 
CCJTDC’s population, each participant 
was assigned a sampling weight 
augmented with a nonresponse 
adjustment to account for missing 
data.
Because some participants were 
interviewed more often than others, 
we summarized prevalence at 6 
time points: the baseline interview 
and follow-up interviews at ∼5, 8, 
10, 12, and 14 years after detention. 
Because many behaviors are 
restricted in correctional settings, 
for each follow-up, we omitted 
from analyses participants who 
had been incarcerated during the 
entire recall period. Supplemental 
Table 1 summarizes demographic 
characteristics and retention 
rates: 1789 participants provided 
data at ≥1 time points. Analyses 
assessing the effect of attrition 
on generalizability are reported 
in the Supplemental Materials. 
Race/ethnicity (African American, 
Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and 
other) was self-identified.
Changes in Prevalence as Youth Age
We used all available interviews, an 
average of 6.4 interviews per person 
(range, 1–12 interviews per person). 
We used generalized estimating 
equations (GEEs) to fit marginal 
models examining: (1) differences 
in the prevalence of risk behaviors 
by sex and race/ethnicity over time 
and (2) changes in risk behaviors as 
youth aged. Unless otherwise noted, 
odds ratios (ORs) indicate sex and 
racial/ethnic differences over time.
All GEE models included covariates 
for sex, race/ethnicity (African 
American, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic 
white), aging (time since detention), 
age at detention (10–18 years), 
and legal status at detention. Four 
participants who identified as “other” 
race/ethnicity were excluded. We 
modeled time since detention using 
restricted cubic splines with 2 
interior knots. When main effects 
were significant, we estimated 
models with the corresponding 
interaction terms. Only statistically 
significant interaction terms were 
included in final models. For models 
with significant interactions between 
sex and aging, we report model-based 
ORs for sex differences at 5, 8, 12, 
and 14 years after detention. Because 
disproportionate incarceration may 
confound racial/ethnic differences 
in HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, all 
models included the length of time 
incarcerated (days) during the recall 
period and an indicator for living 
entirely in the community (yes/
no). All GEE models were estimated 
with sampling weights to account for 
study design.
RESULTS
 
Figures 1,  
2 and  
3 illustrate sex and 
racial/ethnic differences over time 
for multiple partners, unprotected 
sex, and sex while drunk or high, 
respectively. Supplemental Tables 
2–4 provide the specific prevalence 
estimates shown in the figures. 
Supplemental Table 5 shows 
the percentage of participants 
who reported risk behaviors in 
half or more of their interviews. 
Supplemental Tables 6–8 show 
adjusted ORs and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) examining (1) changes 
in prevalence as youth age and (2) 
sex and racial/ethnic differences in 
prevalence over time. We discuss 
significant findings by category of 
HIV/AIDS risk behavior.
Multiple Partners
Prevalence (>1 or >3 partners) 
decreased as participants aged ( 
Fig 
1), although prevalence remained 
notable: 14 years after detention, 
nearly 1 in 10 females and more 
than one-quarter of males reported 
having >1 partner in the past 3 
months (Supplemental Table 2). 
Among males, 52% reported multiple 
partners, with 18% reporting >3 
partners, at half or more of their 
interviews. Among females, only 
13% reported multiple partners 
at half or more of their interviews 
(Supplemental Table 5). The rate of 
the decline in multiple partners (>1) 
depended on sex and race/ethnicity 
(Supplemental Tables 3 and 4).
Sex Differences
Among minorities, males were more 
likely to have multiple partners (>1 
or >3) than females. For example, 
14 years after detention, African 
American males had 4.67 times 
the odds of having >1 partner than 
3

ABRAM et al 
African American females (95% 
CI, 3.22–6.76); Hispanic males had 
3.43 times the odds compared with 
Hispanic females (95% CI, 2.18–5.40) 
(Supplemental Table 6).
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Among males as they aged, African 
American youth had the highest 
prevalence of multiple partners 
(>1 or >3), followed by Hispanic, 
then non-Hispanic white youth 
(Supplemental Table 6). Minority 
females had a lower prevalence of 
multiple partners (>1) compared 
with non-Hispanic white females 
(Supplemental Table 6).
Unprotected Vaginal Sex
 
Figure 2 (top panel) illustrates 
sex and racial/ethnic differences 
in unprotected vaginal sex and 
unprotected vaginal sex with a high-
risk partner (see also Supplemental 
Tables 2–4). Unprotected vaginal 
sex was common: 14 years after 
detention, more than two-thirds of 
males and more than half of females 
reported this behavior. Unprotected 
vaginal sex with a high-risk partner 
was less common, reported by about 1 
in 10 males and females 14 years after 
detention. Overall, 17% of males and 
8% of females reported this behavior 
at more than half of their follow-up 
interviews (Supplemental Table 5). 
The prevalence of unprotected vaginal 
sex generally increased over time, but 
the rate of increase depended on sex 
and race/ethnicity.
Sex Differences
At detention, males were less likely 
to have unprotected vaginal sex 
than females, regardless of race/
ethnicity (Supplemental Table 6). 
However, among African American 
participants, males were more likely 
than females to report unprotected 
vaginal sex as they aged.
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Unprotected vaginal sex was more 
common among Hispanic males 
compared with non-Hispanic white and 
African American males (Supplemental 
Table 6). Unprotected vaginal sex was 
more common among Hispanic and 
non-Hispanic white females compared 
with African American females 
(Supplemental Table 6).
Unprotected Anal Sex
Anal sex risk behaviors (unprotected 
anal sex and unprotected anal sex

with a high-risk partner) were among 
the least prevalent sex risk behaviors, 
and prevalence remained stable over 
time ( 
Fig 2, bottom panel). Fourteen 
years after detention, prevalence of 
unprotected anal sex was 8% among 
males and 3.5% among females; <1% 
of participants reported unprotected 
anal sex with a high-risk partner.
Compared with females, males 
had 1.77 times the odds of having 
unprotected anal sex (95% CI, 
1.30–2.40).
Sex While Drunk or High
 
Figure 3 illustrates sex and racial/
ethnic differences. Having sex 
while drunk or high was among the 
most common risk behaviors, as 
was the riskier behavior of having 
unprotected sex while drunk or high: 
14 years after detention, almost 
half of males and more than one-
quarter of females reported having 
unprotected sex while drunk or high 
(Supplemental Table 2). Having sex 
while drunk or high with a high-
risk partner was less prevalent: 
7.2% among males and 2.3% among 
females. Overall, 8% of males and 
3% of females reported this behavior 
at more than half of their follow-up 
interviews (Supplemental Table 5).
Sex Differences
Having sex while drunk or high 
was more prevalent among males 
than females; the magnitude of 
the difference depended on race/
ethnicity and time since detention 
(Supplemental Table 8). Males also 
had higher prevalence of having 
unprotected sex while drunk or high 
than females (Supplemental 
Table 7).
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Non-Hispanic white females had 
1.52 times greater odds of having 
sex while drunk or high than 
African American females (95% CI, 
1.07–2.16) and 1.60 times the odds 
than Hispanic females (95% CI, 
1.08–2.37).
Trading Sex and Drugs
Trading sex and drugs was 
infrequent: at most follow-ups, <1% 
of participants reported trading sex 
and drugs during the past 2 years 
(Supplemental Table 2). Prevalence 
was highest 5 years after detention 
(about 7% among both males and 
females). As they agreed, African 
American youth had 2.41 times

greater odds of trading sex and 
drugs compared with Hispanic youth 
(95% CI, 1.39–4.16) (Supplemental 
Table 8).
Sharing Needles
Few participants reported sharing 
needles. Fourteen years after 
detention, no males and <1% of 
females reported sharing needles. 
As they agreed, Hispanic youth 
were more likely to have shared 
needles than African American youth 
(Supplemental Table 8).
Multiple Risk Behaviors
Because engaging in >1 risk behavior 
may make youth more vulnerable 
to HIV/AIDS, we also examined the 
prevalence of multiple behaviors 
during the past 3 months.  
Figure 
4 illustrates sex and racial/ethnic 
differences in the overlap of 3 types 
of risk behaviors: multiple partners, 
unprotected sex with a high-risk 
partner, and risky sex while drunk 
or high (unprotected or with a high-
risk partner). Prevalence estimates 
are for the 14-year interview, with 
risk behaviors assessed for the past 3 
months.
There was substantial overlap among 
the 3 types of behaviors for males: 
about 19% of African American and 
Hispanic males and 14% of non-
Hispanic white males engaged in ≥2 
types of risky behavior during the 
past 3 months.
In contrast, ∼8% of African American, 
5% of Hispanic, and 12% of non-
Hispanic white females engaged in at 
least 2 of the behaviors. About 7% of 
non-Hispanic white females engaged 
in all 3 behaviors, compared with 1% 
of African American females and no 
Hispanic females.
DISCUSSION
In the general population, the 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS risk 
behaviors peaks in the early 20s 
and gradually declines over time, 
 
36 
a pattern also found in our sample. 
Yet, although the prevalence of 
most risk behaviors declined with 
age, delinquent youth continue to 
be at great risk for HIV and other 
STIs, particularly for behaviors 
associated with heterosexual contact.

when participants were a median

age of 30 years, one-quarter of 
males and one-tenth of females 
had >1 sexual partner in the past 
3 months. In contrast, in a national 
sample of young adults ages 15 to 
44 years, 18% of males and 14% of 
females reported having >1 partner 
in the past year. 
37 Moreover, one-
tenth of males and females in our 
sample reported recent unprotected 
vaginal sex with a high-risk partner. 
Unprotected vaginal sex poses an 
even higher risk for females than for 
males. 
38 Heterosexual sex is now the 
most common route of transmission 
for HIV/AIDS and STIs in the United 
States for females overall (87% of 
new infections 
2) and for females in 
correctional facilities (64% of new 
infections).2, 
 
20
Risk behaviors associated with 
alcohol and noninjection drug 
use were common as youth aged. 
Fourteen years after detention, 
nearly half of males and more than 
one-quarter of females reported 
having unprotected sex while 
drunk or high in the past 3 months. 
Substance use can increase the 
chance for risky sexual behaviors 
by compromising judgment, 
reducing condom use, and 
compromising the correct use of 
condoms. 
39 
– 
41
Among males, we found many 
racial/ethnic differences in the 
prevalence of risk behaviors. Even 
after adjusting for incarceration 
and age, African American males 
had the highest prevalence of 
multiple partners compared with 
Hispanic and non-Hispanic white 
males. This disparity mirrors 
trends among males in the general 
population, where African American 
adolescents 
42 and adults 
36 are 
significantly more likely to have 
multiple sex partners than other 
racial/ethnic groups. We also found 
that as they aged, Hispanic males 
were more likely than non-Hispanic 
white males to have multiple 
partners and more likely than 
males of other racial/ethnic 
groups to have unprotected 
vaginal sex. Our findings on Hispanic 
males are of particular concern. 
Hispanic people comprise ∼17% 
of the US population, but accounted 
for 22.7% of new HIV infections 
among persons aged 13 to 29 years 
in 2014. 
2 Moreover, among 
Hispanic people, males comprised 
85% of new HIV infections 
in 2013. 
43
Among females, however, non-
Hispanic white youth were more 
likely than minority youth to have 
multiple partners and to have 
sex while drunk or high, as they 
agreed. This may be because, in our 
sample, substance use disorders, 
a risk factor for many behaviors, 
are more common in non-Hispanic 
white females than in racial/ethnic 
minority females. 
44 Of note, as in 
the general population, 
 
45 African 
American females in our sample had 
7

a lower prevalence of many sex risk 
behaviors than non-Hispanic white 
females. However, African American 
females in the general population 
continue to be disproportionately 
affected by HIV, likely because of 
a greater risk of encountering an 
infected partner. 
45
Limitations
It was not feasible to study >1 
jurisdiction, and findings may be 
generalizable only to delinquent 
youth in urban detention centers 
with similar demographic 
compositions. Although retention 
was high, findings on risk behaviors 
assessed at follow-up may have 
been affected by missing data. Some 
behaviors may confer more risk for 
contracting STIs with a secondary 
risk for contracting HIV. 
46 We 
did not collect data on some risk 
behaviors until participants were 
young adults. Data are subject to 
the limitations of self-report. 
Males who have sex with males are 
stigmatized in African American 
and Hispanic communities. 
47, 
 
48 
Hence, the actual prevalence of 
some behaviors may be higher 
than reported. Finally, we did not 
examine how marital status, living 
arrangements, or other variables 
affect risk behaviors.
Future Research and Implications 
for Pediatric Health
1. Incorporate HIV/AIDS education, 
counseling, and support into 
substance abuse treatment of 
at-risk youth and young adults. 
The importance of providing HIV/
AIDS preventive interventions in 
correctional settings cannot be 
overstated. 
49, 
 
50 However, because 
juvenile and adult detainees are 
usually released in a matter of 
days, 
 
51 preventive interventions 
must also be provided in 
communities after release. 
One strategy is to incorporate 
evidence-based HIV preventive 
interventions 
52, 
53 into substance 
abuse services. Because substance 
use disorders are prevalent 
among juvenile detainees

and persist as they age, 
 
28 this 
approach would reach many 
youth at risk for HIV. However, we 
must improve service availability; 
currently, only 1 in 4 substance 
abuse treatment facilities 
offer HIV testing, and just over 
half (58%) provide HIV/AIDS 
education, counseling, or support 
services. 
55
2. Incorporate HIV/AIDS prevention 
into routine pediatric care. The 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention recommends that, 
with the adolescent’s consent, 
pediatricians should conduct 
HIV and STI tests annually for 
high-risk youth. 
56 Pediatricians 
should also conduct risk-reduction 
counseling in an atmosphere 
of tolerance. 
56, 
 
57 Counseling 
should include the assessment 
of sexual and substance use 
history, education about risks, 
and support for safe behaviors. 
57 
Strength-based interventions58 
and motivational interviewing 
techniques 
59 could increase the 
adolescent’s intrinsic motivation 
to change.
3. Examine how incarceration 
affects the development and 
persistence of HIV/AIDS risk 
behaviors in high-risk youth. 
Certainly, many delinquent 
youth have engaged in HIV/
AIDS risk behaviors before 
they were detained. 
60, 
 
61 Yet, 
the experience of incarceration 
disrupts normal development, 
leading to additional risks. 
Studies of high-risk populations 
in the community (eg, homeless 
adults and persons involved in 
sex parties) suggest that the 
experience of incarceration 
21 
may be a key predictive variable 
of subsequent HIV/AIDS risk 
behaviors. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
72 Because drugs, 
alcohol, and sex partners are 
restricted in correctional settings, 
released juveniles may engage in 
risky behaviors to compensate 
for the deprivations experienced 
during incarceration.73 
– 
75 
Moreover, long correctional stays 
may disrupt social networks, 
leading to more sex partners 
after release. 
68, 
 
76, 
77 Yet, little is 
known about how incarceration 
affects HIV/AIDS risk behaviors 
in delinquent youth after 
release. 
61, 
 
75, 
 
78 We suggest that 
prospective studies investigate 
the following variables: the 
number of incarcerations, 
age at time of incarceration, 
length of incarcerations, and 
experiences in “community 
corrections” (parole, probation, 
and community supervision). 
This strategy would generate 
necessary information on how 
disproportionate confinement 
of racial/ethnic minority youth 
affects health disparities in HIV/
AIDS.
CONCLUSIONS
Although the United States 
has the highest incarceration rate 
among developed nations (698 
inmates per 100 000 residents 
versus 106 in Canada and 148 in 
England), 
 
79 surprisingly few 
studies examine health outcomes 
of delinquent youth after they 
leave detention. We know the 
least about the populations that 
are at greatest risk for HIV/AIDS 
as they age. The challenge for 
pediatric health is to address how 
disproportionate confinement of 
racial/ethnic minority youth in 
the United States leads to health 
disparities in the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic.
