Abstract 
We conducted a meta-analysis on the available data from studies investigating SERTs in 
ecstasy users and polydrug using controls. From 7 studies we compared data from 157 
ecstasy users and 148 controls across 14 brain regions. The main effect suggested 
ecstasy/MDMA related SERT reductions  (SMD = 0.52, 95% CIs [0.40, 0.65]; Z=8.36, p < 
.01, I2 = 89%). A significant effect of subgroups (X2 = 37.41, df = 13, p < .01, I2 = 65.3%) 
suggested differential effects across brain ROIs. Ecstasy users showed significant SERT 
reductions in 11 out of the 14 regions, including every neocortical and limbic region 
analysed. Greatest effects were observed in the occipital cortex (SMD = 1.09, 95% CIs [0.70, 
1.48]). No group effects were observed in subcortical areas of the caudate, putamen and

midbrain. Literature on Postsynaptic 5HT2A receptor imaging was synthesised with these 
results. We conclude that, in line with preclinical data, serotonin axons with the longest 
projections from the raphe nuclei appear to be most affected by ecstasy/MDMA use.

1. Introduction 
Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) remains one of the most popular illicit 
recreational drugs  in the UK, with a lifetime prevalence of 9.3% (EMCDDA, European Drug 
Report 2015), and presents a major public health concern given recent increases in reports of 
MDMA-related deaths and increasing strength of tablets (Global Drugs Survey 2015 report 
tablets containing upwards of 200mg of MDMA).  
Acute effects of ecstasy/MDMA administration include increases in energy and euphoria 
(Dumont & Verkes, 2004), amongst other psychological and physiological alterations that are 
primarily mediated by serotonin and norepinephrine release (Hysek et al., 2011; Hysek et al., 
2012). The increase in serotonin neurotransmission following MDMA administration is 
understood to be produced via action at the serotonin transporter (SERT) (Verrico et al., 
2007). Long lasting toxic effects of MDMA on central serotonin neurons have been observed 
in primates (Ricaurte et al., 1988) and animal research has demonstrated evidence of lasting 
reductions in markers of central serotonin axons and axon terminals (Ricaurte & McCann, 
2001). Moreover, evidence from preclinical anatomical studies suggests that there is an 
association between axon length and vulnerability to neurotoxic effects of MDMA (Molliver 
et al., 1990), whereby the longest axons extending from 5-HT neurons are more susceptible 
  
 
3 
 
to damage from MDMA. Serotonin neurons project from the raphe nuclei which are situated 
near the midline of the brainstem (Hornung, 2003). As such those neurons with the longest 
axons are those innervating the cortex, and are thus more susceptible to MDMA related 
neuroadaptations than those shorter axons innervating subcortical structures (Urban et al., 
2012). 
It is difficult to make direct comparisons between the selective serotonergic neurotoxicity 
observed in animal studies using ecstasy/MDMA and those using human participants. 
Moreover, direct measurement of the effect of ecstasy on human brain serotonin axons is not 
possible in vivo. However molecular imaging of markers for presynaptic SERT and 
postsynaptic 5HT2A receptors is possible in humans using Positron Emission Tomography 
(PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).  
Using radio-ligand neuroimaging has enabled the progression of the study of potential 
ecstasy/MDMA related serotonin axon neuroadaptations. However, there has been much 
variation in the reported results from molecular imaging studies with currently abstinent 
(usually for at least 2 weeks prior to testing) ecstasy users and control groups. Inconsistencies 
can be observed between studies in magnitude of, and regional extent of effect. It would 
therefore be beneficial to the field to be able to draw definitive conclusions from the gamut of 
molecular imaging studies conducted in this research area. 
Different findings have been observed between studies regarding susceptibility to SERT 
reductions in the striatum (caudate and putamen) of ecstasy users, for example McCann et al. 
(2005) report no differences between users and MDMA-naïve polydrug users in these areas 
using 2 different tracers, and several other studies observe little effect on SERT in these 
structures (Semple et al., 1999; Kish et al., 2010; Urban et al., 2012). However, Buchert et al. 
(2003) report reduced cortical SERT Distribution Volume Ratio (DVR)s in ecstasy users 
  
 
4 
 
relative to polydrug controls. The thalamus has also been reported to show no reduction in 
SERT in ecstasy users in some cases (Semple et al., 1999; Kish et al., 2010), and significantly 
reduced SERT relative to controls in others (Buchert et al., 2003; McCann et al., 2005).  
Cortical regions are more consistently affected, with ecstasy users regularly showing SERT 
reductions in the occipital cortex (McCann et al., 1998; McCann et al., 2005; Kish et al., 
2010; Urban et al., 2012) as well as reports of increased postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor 
binding (Reneman et al., 2000). However not all regions show this consistency. Furthermore, 
some analyses report significant reductions in global SERT (McCann 1998) for ecstasy users 
compared to controls, whereas others report more selective regional SERT reductions 
(McCann et al., 2005; Kish et al., 2010), potentially due to a highly heterogeneous 
distribution of SERT in the human brain (Kish et al., 2005). 
Most studies in these populations suggest that ecstasy use does have some effect on 
serotonin. However, the regional distribution and magnitude of these effects remain 
unknown. It is understood that differences in radioligands may contribute to some of the 
inconsistencies in the literature. For example [123I]ßCIT – is not SERT specific and 
[11C]McN5652 has been criticised for having a modest specific to non-specific binding ratio 
(Heinz & Jones, 2000; Kish et al., 2010; Kuikka & Ahonen, 1999).  Equally, differences in 
drug use history will always vary from study to study and are likely to influence findings, 
particularly as dose is inversely correlated with SERT (McCann et al., 2005). However, 
potentially the biggest problem for reporting consistent effects in this area is due to many 
molecular imaging studies having small samples.  
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to meta-analyse the available data from molecular 
imaging studies on the central serotonin markers of presynaptic SERT and postsynaptic 5-
HT2A receptor availability, in current (but abstinent at time of testing) ecstasy users and non-
  
 
5 
 
user controls. The overall aim was to observe whether ecstasy/MDMA use has an effect on 
SERT and 5-HT2A receptor availability, and to provide a comprehensive and consistent 
understanding and synthesis of the available literature on the effects of MDMA/ecstasy on 
human brain serotonin function.  
 
2. METHODS 
2.1. Eligibility criteria 
2.1.1. Participants 
We included studies that conducted molecular imaging of serotonin transporters (using PET 
or SPECT) in human ecstasy/MDMA using participants aged over 18 years, who did not have 
a history of major psychiatric or neurological problems and were abstinent from drug use at 
the time of testing.  
2.1.2. Studies 
Studies that conducted molecular imaging of serotonin transporters (using PET or SPECT) 
and reported  molecular imaging outcomes relating to cerebral serotonin transporter binding 
(presynaptic SERT) and/or cerebral serotonin receptor binding (postsynaptic 5HT2A 
receptors), using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Single Photon Emission 
Computed Tomography (SPECT) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis.   
2.1.3. Comparator groups and study design 
To be eligible for inclusion, all studies were required to have an ecstasy/MDMA using 
condition (current users) which was compared to at least one form of control/comparison 
group, in a between subjects design. 
2.1.4. Outcome measure 
  
 
6 
 
SPECT and PET studies investigating SERT and 5HT2A receptor binding can have a range of 
outcome measures. These include the simple ratio of binding in a particular region of interest 
in comparison to a non-binding reference region (Specific Uptake Ratio – SUR). Binding 
potential (BPND) may also be calculated when dynamic emission sequences are available, 
which gives the reader information about specific binding relative to reference tissue. V3” 
refers to the specific to non-displaceable equilibrium partition and DVR refers to an outcome 
that is associated with the equilibrium of the tracer in the brain, which is reported when 
arterial input function is measured (Gryglewski et al., 2014).  
2.2. Data search and extraction 
2.2.1. Information sources and search strategy 
For the formal search strategy, 3 electronic databases were searched during April 2015. These 
were: PsychINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. Systematic searches used the key terms 
‘Ecstasy’ OR ‘MDMA’ AND, ‘PET’OR ‘SPECT’ OR ‘molecular imaging’. Manual searches 
of the reference sections of identified articles and relevant sources were also conducted to 
supplement the formal electronic search. Further to this, supplementary electronic searches of 
the 3 databases previously used were undertaken prior to publication with no further articles 
identified. 
2.2.2. Article selection and extraction of data 
Independent searches of the electronic databases were carried out by two authors (CR and 
CM). Both authors were responsible for assessment of articles for inclusion in analysis, with 
any disagreements resolved by discussion. One author (CR) extracted the relevant data from 
the studies, which was cross-checked by a second author (CM).  In cases where a study met 
the inclusion criteria but insufficient information was provided to compute the effect size, 
data was requested from the corresponding author of the paper. Data requests were not met 
  
 
7 
 
for 6 articles (Reneman, Booij et al., 2001; Reneman, Lavalaye et al., 2001; Thomasius et al., 
2003; Buchert et al., 2004; de Win et al., 2004; de Win et al., 2008). Therefore analyses were 
conducted on data from 9 publications. 
 
2.2.3. Additional Handling of data 
Means and Standard Deviations (SDs) were estimated from the figure presented in McCann 
et al. (1998), using Web Plot Digitizer 3.8 (Rohatgi, 2015). Data presented in Semple et al. 
(1999) provided separate means and SDs for the left and right side of each brain region 
measured; for inclusion of this data in the current analysis the authors transformed this data 
into a mean value for each brain region by combining the mean values for left and right and 
dividing by 2. The same procedure was used for transforming the SDs.  
2.2.4. Data items extracted for individual studies 
The following data were extracted from the published articles for analysis separately for each 
group of participants: outcome for each region reported, age, estimated lifetime dose of 
ecstasy, time since last use, type of tracer, type of outcome measure, number of participants 
in group and gender split (Table 1.). These variables were recorded in the form they were 
originally presented. In cases where mean abstinence duration from ecstasy was not reported, 
minimum abstinence required for inclusion in the study was recorded.  In cases where mean 
lifetime doses of ecstasy use were not reported, an estimate was calculated if possible from 
the data available, for example McCann et al. 2005 report usual dose and lifetime exposures, 
in cases such as this an estimate lifetime dose was calculated by multiplying these values. 
Ecstasy user groups could broadly be defined by two categories (current users, former users). 
Control groups would also generally fall within 3 categories, for example “polydrug controls” 
  
 
8 
 
refers to groups that were MDMA naïve but were recruited due to them having some degree 
of matching for use of other drugs. ‘Controls with some polydrug use’ refers to groups who 
were not recruited explicitly due to them having used illicit drugs, yet use of illicit drugs had 
not resulted in exclusion of participants. Drug naïve controls generally allowed for use of 
legally available drugs such as nicotine and alcohol. 
 
2.3. Statistical and subgroup analysis 
Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) and Standard Error (SE) of the SMD between 
experimental conditions were calculated separately for reported brain regions in each study. 
Individual SMDs were synthesised by meta-analysis using the method of generic inverse 
variance (random effects assumed) in the software package RevMan 5.2 (The Nordic 
Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen). The magnitude of effects of SMDs can be interpreted thus: 
0.2 = a small effect, 0.5 = a moderate effect and 0.8 = a large effect (Higgins & Green, 2011) 
SMDs were employed due to the main outcomes of interest in PET and SPECT studies on 
SERT binding and serotonin receptor binding having several possible outcome measures. 
SMD allows for variation in outcome measures, by estimating the differences between 2 
experimental conditions on an outcome variable, and dividing the difference by the pooled 
SDs of the outcome variable.  
Analytic Strategy: The meta-analysis was conducted by separating effect sizes from each 
study into brain regions, as specified in individual studies. We examined the main effect and 
also formal subgroup analyses, whereby each brain region appraised in 2 or more studies was 
considered a sub-group. This main analysis was conducted on the 7 articles that investigated 
SERT availability and was a comparison of current ecstasy users binding vs polydrug 
  
 
9 
 
controls/controls with some polydrug use. One study (Urban et al., 2012) reported both 
presynaptic SERT binding and postsynaptic 5HT2A receptor binding, as such the 10 papers 
yielded 7 that were suitable for SERT binding comparison and 4 that were eligible for 
postsynaptic 5HT2A receptor binding assessment. Due to the low number of articles eligible 
for postsynaptic 5HT2A receptor analysis, and differences in brain regions investigated, we 
provide a narrative synthesis rather that formal analysis of these studies. 
One publication (McCann et al., 2005) conducted SERT binding analysis using 2 different 
tracers, within the same sample – as such, only data using the tracer [11C]DASB is included 
in the meta-analysis. This choice is based upon [11C]DASB having important advantages 
over [11C]McN5652 in detecting SERT density, namely, a greater specific-to-nonspecific 
equilibrium activity ratio (McCann et al., 2005). A high correlation between the two tracers (r 
= 0.97) justified inclusion of only [11C]DASB. Most studies included 2 conditions and as 
such potentially contributed one comparison per brain region to main analysis. Moreover, 
from the 7 studies deemed acceptable for analysis of SERTs, it was noted that only one of 
these (Buchert et al., 2003) employed a drug naïve control group (and also a former ecstasy 
user group). However, this study also employed a polydrug control group. Therefore, it was 
decided, that analysis should focus on control groups that had some drug use (polydrug 
controls and controls with some polydrug use). Consequently, all between group comparisons 
in the main meta-analysis have some degree of matching for use of other drugs. This controls 
for concomitant use of other drugs, which is regularly reported in the literature in this area. 
We conducted random effects models due to high heterogeneity across studies.

RESULTS 
3.1. Study Selection 
Initial literature searches yielded 80 papers in the Scopus database, 41 papers in PsychINFO 
and 207 papers from Web of Science. After removing duplicated papers a total of 211 papers 
remained. Following a brief review of the remaining articles’ titles and abstracts, a further 
166 were excluded as they were not relevant to the current analysis. Excluded papers 
included review articles or commentaries (32), non-human studies (68), acute administration 
studies (10), other substance/not serotonin studies (16), no use of molecular imaging (24), 
non-substance populations (12) and case studies (4). Following this 45 full articles were 
reviewed. Studies were removed at this stage if they did not have a control group or did not 
have a current user group, investigated serotonin synthesis capacity or cerebral glucose 
metabolism and cerebral blood flow. Prospective studies on novice ecstasy users, as well as 
longitudinal studies using a within groups design were also excluded at this stage. Following 
adherence to these exclusion criteria, 15 studies remained. Due to unavailable data in 6 
studies, and a further eligible study identified during the review process final assessment was 
conducted on data from 10 publications (7 contributing data to the meta-analysis).

3.2. Overview 
Participant characteristics 
Individual study information including sample sizes and participant characteristics are given 
in Table 1.  
<<Insert Table 1 Here>> 
  
 
11 
 
 
3.3. Pre Synaptic SERT Meta-Analysis 
Data from 7 published studies (Table 1) were included in analyses of presynaptic SERT 
binding. From these there was a total of 157 ecstasy/MDMA users (7 studies), 19 polydrug 
controls (2 studies), 129 controls with some polydrug use (5 studies) and 29 drug naïve 
controls (1 study). One study also included a former ecstasy/MDMA sample, which provided 
a total of 29 participants.  
3.3.1. Meta-analyses: 
Included studies examining presynaptic SERT binding in ecstasy users vs polydrug/controls 
with some polydrug use had investigated various ROIs. Each brain region that was 
investigated by 2 or more studies was identified as a subgroup for meta-analysis. The test for 
overall effect was significant (SMD = 0.52, 95% CIs [0.40, 0.65]; Z=8.36, p < .01, I2 = 89%) 
which demonstrated significant SERT reductions ecstasy users versus polydrug using 
controls. There was also a significant effect of subgroups (X2 = 37.41, df = 13, p < .01, I2 = 
65.3%) suggesting differential effects across brain ROI. Individual analyses are reported 
below. 
<<Insert Table 2 Here>> 
3.3.2. Frontal Cortex: 
Three studies with a total of 73 ecstasy users and 75 controls assessed SERT binding in the 
frontal cortex. A significant difference was observed between the two comparison groups 
(SMD = 0.54, 95% CIs [0.19, 0.89]; Z = 3.04, p < .01; I2 = 71%), suggesting SERT 
reductions in ecstasy users relative to controls. 
  
 
12 
 
3.3.3. Midbrain: 
There were 5 studies that assessed SERT in the midbrain, with a total of 117 ecstasy users 
and 129 controls. No significant difference in SERT was observed between groups in this 
brain region (SMD = 0.13, 95% CIs [-0.15, 0.40]; Z = 0.91, p > .05; I2 = 77%). 
3.3.4. Parietal Cortex: 
Four studies reported SERT values in the parietal cortex, there were 99 ecstasy users in total 
and 97 controls. There was a significant between group difference in this region (SMD = 
0.97, 95% CIs [0.44, 1.49]; Z = 3.61, p < .01; I2 = 91%). Ecstasy users display reduced SERT 
relative to controls here. 
3.3.5. Temporal Cortex: 
Four studies assessed SERT in the temporal cortex, with a total of 99 ecstasy users compared 
to 97 controls. Analysis in this area showed a significant difference (SMD = 0.94, 95% CIs 
[0.56, 1.31]; Z = 4.86, p < .01; I2 = 84%), with ecstasy users displaying reduced SERT 
relative to controls. 
3.3.6. Occipital Cortex: 
Five studies gave SERT values in the occipital cortex. One hundred and nine ecstasy users 
were compared to 107 controls. Again, there were significant differences between the two 
groups (SMD = 1.09, 95% CIs [0.70, 1.48]; Z = 5.45, p < .01; I2 = 87%) which reflect 
reduced SERT in ecstasy users compared to controls. 
3.3.7. Caudate: 
  
 
13 
 
Six studies investigated SERT in the caudate, providing a total of 139 ecstasy users and 136 
controls. The difference between groups in this region was non-significant (SMD = 0.19, 
95% CIs [-0.07, 0.45]; Z = 1.43, p > .05; I2 = 77%). 
3.3.8. Putamen: 
Six studies assessed SERT in the putamen (139 ecstasy users vs 136 controls), and again no 
differences were observed between groups in the meta-analysis (SMD = 0.22, 95% CIs [-
0.05, 0.49]; Z = 1.59, p > .05; I2 = 79%). 
3.3.9. Thalamus: 
Six studies were included in analysis of SERT in the thalamus, giving a total of 139 ecstasy 
users and 136 controls. Analysis showed that there were significant between group 
differences in the thalamus (SMD = 0.31, 95% CIs [0.11, 0.51]; Z = 3.10, p < .01; I2 = 59%), 
whereby ecstasy users have reduced SERT relative to controls. 
3.3.10. Anterior Cingulate: 
A total of 4 studies assessed SERT in the anterior cingulate, totalling 95 ecstasy users versus 
92 controls. The difference between these groups was statistically significant (SMD = 0.48, 
95% CIs [0.26, 0.71]; Z = 4.15, p < .01; I2 = 53%), again ecstasy users have reduced SERT 
relative to controls. 
3.3.11. Hippocampus: 
Three studies reported SERT comparisons in the hippocampus (total n = 85 ecstasy users, 82 
controls). Differences in SERT were significant (SMD = 0.57, 95% CIs [0.17, 0.98]; Z = 
2.76, p < .01; I2 = 83%) with ecstasy users displaying reduced SERT here compared to 
controls. 
  
 
14 
 
3.3.12. DLPFC: 
Two studies were included in analysis of DLPFC SERT, with a total of 36 ecstasy users and 
32 controls. The difference in SERT in the DLPFC between users and controls was 
statistically significant (SMD = 0.83, 95% CIs [0.13, 1.53]; Z = 2.33, p < .01; I2 = 88%)  
whereby ecstasy users show reduced SERT. 
3.3.13. Posterior Cingulate: 
Two studies were used to evaluate SERT in the posterior cingulate, providing a total of 33 
ecstasy users and 29 controls. The meta-analysis revealed a significant between group 
difference here (SMD = 0.80, 95% CIs [0.07, 1.52]; Z = 2.16, p < .05; I2 = 87%) again 
ecstasy users display reduced SERT compared to controls here. 
3.3.14. Amygdala: 
Two studies were entered into the meta-analysis for comparison of SERT in the amygdala, 
providing a total of 36 ecstasy users and 32 controls. This analysis showed a significant 
difference between the two groups (SMD = 0.35, 95% CIs [0.08, 0.62]; Z = 2.54, p = .01; I2 
= 20%). Ecstasy users show reduced SERT in the amygdala. 
3.3.15. Insula:  
Two studies had available data for analysis of SERT in the insula, these provided a total of 62 
participants in the ecstasy user group and 63 participants in the control group. The difference 
between these two groups was approaching significance (SMD = 0.62, 95% CIs [-0.02, 1.26]; 
Z = 1.90, p = .06; I2 = 89%), again ecstasy users show reduced SERT in the insula relative to 
controls. 
3.4. Evidence of publication bias  
  
 
15 
 
Visual examination of a funnel plot suggested asymmetry in study effects. Funnel plot 
asymmetry is often associated with publication bias (Light & Pillemer, 1984), which is 
something often reported as problematic in research into ecstasy related harm (Cole, 2014). 
However, interpretation of asymmetry may be difficult due to a number of issues including 
small sample sizes (Stern & Harbord, 2004), such as those observed in many types of 
imaging studies, including those involved in the current analysis and high heterogeneity. 
In order to further examine any potential publication bias and small study effects we 
performed a test for an excess of significant findings (Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007). We 
estimated the average statistical power for all the effect sizes used in our analysis based on 
the fixed-effects point estimate separately for each region (overall statistical power = 
46.48%). Based on this level of power we would expect 25.09 of the 54 effect sizes in the 
meta-analysis to be significant, yet the observed number of effect sizes that were significant 
was 34. The difference between observed and expected was beyond chance (p = .08, two-
sided), thus there was an excess of observed significant findings in the meta-analysis which 
may be attributable to publication bias.  
 
3.5. Post-synaptic 5HT2A receptor binding 
The systematic literature search process yielded 4 papers for analysis of 5HT2A receptor 
binding. One of these assessed both presynaptic SERT and post-synaptic 5HT2A binding, 
using PET and so was assessed in the main meta-analysis above. However, as there were only 
4 papers assessing postsynaptic binding matching our review criteria, two studies using a 
drug naïve control group (Reneman et al., 2000; Reneman et al., 2002), one  using a control 
group with some polydrug use (Urban et al., 2012) and one assessing a polydrug comparison 
group (Di Iorio et al., 2012), there was little scope for comparison groups. Adding to this 
complication is that there was little consistency between studies in brain regions identified for 
  
 
16 
 
comparison. As such a formal meta-analysis was inappropriate for ecstasy users versus 
controls in postsynaptic 5HT2A receptor binding. Nevertheless, the data from these studies is 
reviewed here and synthesised with the findings from the meta-analysis. 
Reneman et al. (2000) studied cortical 5-HT2A receptor densities in five currently abstinent 
MDMA users compared to 9 healthy age and education matched control subjects. It was 
observed that overall binding ratios were higher in the MDMA group than controls and this 
difference was statistically significant in the occipital cortex. The authors suggest that this 
increase in receptors is a result of 5-HT depletion, as this leads to upregulation of 5-HT2A 
receptors in animal studies in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. They also cite their finding 
in the occipital cortex to be in line with work showing severe MDMA related 5-HT depletion 
in the occipital cortex in primates (Scheffel et al., 1998). This finding is intriguing, given that 
in the current meta-analysis ecstasy/MDMA related reductions in SERT showed the greatest 
effect in the occipital cortex (SMD = 1.09). So this area is potentially particularly sensitive to 
ecstasy/MDMA induced neurotoxicity. However it is acknowledged by Reneman and 
colleagues that their study has a small sample and thus should be treated as pilot data.  
More recently Urban et al. (2012) investigated neocortical postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor 
integrity in 13 current and recently detoxified MDMA users and 13 age, ethnicity and gender 
matched healthy controls. Individual region analysis revealed significant increase in 5-HT2A 
receptor binding in ecstasy users compared to controls in the DLPFC and in the parietal 
cortex. However these did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. There were no 
observed correlations between 5-HT2A receptor availability and clinical parameters of ecstasy 
use history (e.g. time since last use). As in the former studies, the authors suggest that 5-HT2A 
receptor upregulation is a possible response to sustained 5-HT depletion. It is observed that 
higher binding was observed in the neocortex, where SERT density is lower in this study 
(SERTs were also analysed by Urban et al. and this data is included in the current meta-
  
 
17 
 
analysis). Indeed cortical regions display consistent SERT reductions in the current meta-
analysis in ecstasy users compared to controls. 
Finally, Di Iorio et al. (2012) assessed 5-HT2A receptor binding in 14 female MDMA users, 
who had a minimum of 2 weeks drug abstinence prior to scanning and 10 female non-
MDMA exposed controls who had some cannabis and alcohol exposure. The greatest 
difference was reported in the temporal cluster, whereby MDMA users had 20.5% higher 
binding than controls. A further interesting finding was that lifetime MDMA dose was 
positively and significantly correlated with receptor binding in 4 cortical clusters 
(frontoparietal, occipitotemporal, frontolimbic and frontal regions). Di Iorio et al. (2012) 
suggest their results extend those of Reneman et al. (2000) to multiple cortical regions and 
show a lack of recovery with extended abstinence and a dose-response effect. However this is 
a female only cohort, and is another study that has a small sample size. 
In line with a lack of recovery, Reneman et al. (2002) observed significantly higher 5-HT2A 
binding in 7 ex MDMA users (min of 2 months abstinence), compared to 11 drug naïve 
controls in the occipital cortex using [123I]R91150 SPECT. Moreover, a significant 
correlation was observed between cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding and duration of 
abstinence, but not with lifetime dose of MDMA. Conversely, recent MDMA users (n=17, 
min abstinence 1 week) had lower [123I]R91150 binding ratios than controls in all cortical 
regions examined (frontal, parietal and occipital cortices). Reneman et al. (2002) suggest that 
MDMA use results in a sub-chronic down regulation of 5-HT2A receptors, and a chronic up-
regulation compensating for low synaptic 5-HT. In the context of the other work reported 
here on post synaptic 5-HT2A receptor binding, these findings suggest that 5-HT2A receptor 
adaptations in ecstasy users are very complex and thus interpretation of findings requires 
caution. 
  
 
18 
 
The overall findings from the post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptor binding can be synthesised with 
the findings from the meta-analysis to suggest that MDMA may have an effect on serotonin 
system function. Indeed, postsynaptic receptor levels seem to show less of an effect in 
subcortical regions. This is also analogous to subcortical regions (putamen, caudate, 
midbrain) showing no difference between users and controls in the meta-analysis. Many of 
the studies on receptor binding have small numbers and so may be criticised for being 
unreliable. However the studies reviewed here, appear to corroborate the findings of MDMA 
related adaptations to cortical SERT in ecstasy users subject to meta-analysis.

Discussion 
The results from this meta-analysis demonstrated significant reductions in pre-synaptic SERT 
availability in ecstasy/MDMA users versus controls. Our subgroup analysis on different ROIs 
demonstrated significant reductions in brain regions including: the frontal cortex, parietal 
cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, 
posterior cingulate, hippocampus, amygdala, insula and the thalamus. The overall effect size 
was moderate with large heterogeneity.  However the subgroup analysis was also significant, 
suggesting that differences in effect size between groups varied by subgroup (brain region), 
which suggests that not all regions that were analysed showed the effect of ecstasy related 
SERT reduction. 
The systematic literature search produced 7 published articles, with available data, for 
inclusion in a meta-analysis of presynaptic SERT availability in ecstasy users compared to an 
MDMA, but not drug naïve control sample. Data from a total of 157 ecstasy users, and 148 
controls was included in analysis, suggesting mean group sizes of 22 and 21 respectively per 
imaging study. Although these are typical molecular imaging study sample sizes, it is 
  
 
19 
 
understandable  that detection of small group differences has been unreliable in the literature 
(Gryglewski et al., 2014). To this end this meta-analysis has successfully synthesised results 
from studies assessing SERT availability and the results are therefore more conclusive than 
individual reports. 
Each brain region included in the analysis that could be described as being in the neocortex 
produced a significant difference between groups, whereby ecstasy users displayed reduced 
SERT compared to controls (frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex 
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). The greatest effect was observed in the occipital cortex, 
which is unsurprising as this has regularly been reported as an area of significance for 
reduced SERT in ecstasy users(McCann et al., 1998; McCann et al., 2005; Kish et al., 2010, 
Urban et al., 2012) as well as postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor binding (Reneman et al., 2000). It 
is worthy of note that 4 of these neocortical areas (occipital cortex, parietal cortex, temporal 
cortex and DLPFC) are the 4 regions showing the greatest effect sizes in the whole analysis. 
This is consistent with the preclinical research suggesting that axon length is associated with 
greater vulnerability to neuroadaptations with MDMA (Molliver et al., 1990). Moreover it is 
interesting that studies that isolated the DLPFC have a greater effect size than those that 
considered the frontal cortex as a region of interest, as this is in line with findings of Urban et 
al. (2012) who suggest that even within cortical regions, differences can be observed with 
dorsal regions, which are associated with longer axon lengths showing greater effects than 
medial regions. Neuroadaptation in the DLPFC is also consistent with behavioural data, 
suggesting that executive functioning is impaired in ecstasy users relative to controls (e.g. 
Montgomery et al., 2005) and recent functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy research 
suggesting alteration to blood flow in the DLPFC of ecstasy users relative to controls 
(Roberts & Montgomery, 2015). 
  
 
20 
 
Similarly, all regions analysed that could be categorised as making up part of the limbic 
system showed significant differences between groups in the current analysis (anterior 
cingulate, posterior cingulate, hippocampus, amygdala, insula). These regions are not covered 
in detail in the postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor imaging literature as they are only examined in 
Urban et al. (2012), who observed no significant differences between users and controls. 
However the same pattern of results was observed in the same paper’s SERT data, which is 
included in the meta-analysis. Furthermore, 5 of the 6 papers that data were not available for, 
did not examine any limbic areas (Reneman, Booij et al., 2001; Reneman, Lavalaye et al., 
2001; Thomasius et al., 2003; de Win et al., 2004; de Win et al., 2008), whereas one paper 
(Buchert et al., 2004) observed MDMA related SERT reductions in the posterior cingulate 
and the hippocampus, which is consistent with the findings of the meta-analysis. 
Conversely, to the neocortex and the limbic areas, the thalamus was the only subcortical 
region that showed significant between group differences. No differences were observed 
between ecstasy users and controls in the caudate, putamen (striatal cortex) or the midbrain. 
These, findings from the meta-analysis are interesting if they are placed alongside the papers 
that were omitted from analysis due to unavailable data. Indeed Buchert et al. (2004) suggest 
reductions in the left caudate in current ecstasy users relative to controls and Thomasius et al. 
(2003) also observed reduced SERT availability in the caudate nucleus of current ecstasy 
users. These findings suggest that the results on subcortical areas may not be as decisive as 
the meta-analysis concludes. However data from these studies was not made available for 
inclusion. Nevertheless the current authors assume the findings from the current analysis to 
be robust given the amount of studies included.  Moreover, there is a good theoretical basis to 
expect that SERT rich areas such as the striatum may not show large reductions relative to 
controls. As mentioned previously preclinical data suggest that longer axon projections from 
serotonin neurons may be more susceptible to MDMA related damage than shorter 
  
 
21 
 
projections (Molliver et al., 1990). Therefore, because the caudate, putamen and midbrain are 
relatively close to the raphe nuclei, they may be more robust to the damaging effects of 
MDMA on their axons. This is supported by animal models of MDMA related neurotoxicity, 
whereby serotonergic neural regeneration is selective for centrally located neuronal structures 
(Fischer et al., 1995).  
While this meta-analysis shows clear evidence of neuroadaptation following ecstasy use, it 
cannot provide confirmation regarding regeneration or reversibility of MDMA related effects 
on central serotonin axons. PET scans using [11C]DASB were conducted in former MDMA 
users with at least 1 year abstinence (Selvaraj et al., 2009) to observe whether SERT 
availability could normalise over time. It was reported that former users showed normal 
SERT as compared to polydrug and drug naïve controls. However, this study did not 
incorporate a current user group into analysis, and therefore the results need to be treated with 
caution. Perhaps well designed longitudinal studies would be better able to answer questions 
about the reversibility of the effects captured in our meta-analysis. 
 There are several limitations to the current analysis. First of all, as we were limited to results 
from 7 studies, it is of course possible that data that was unavailable to us at the time of 
analysis could alter the current findings. The studies identified generally had low statistical 
power (see above) and together provided a small number of estimates for some ROIs. 
Therefore, well powered studies examining all ROIs are required to confirm the findings 
reported.  Furthermore, due to the limited number of studies, it was not appropriate to 
conduct a meta-regression, in which correlations between drug use (lifetime dose, recency of 
use, frequency of use) and SERTs could be observed. However there are several reports of 
SERT binding correlating significantly with lifetime dose and years of use (Thomasius et al., 
2003; Buchert et al., 2004; McCann et al., 2005; Kish et al., 2010).  
  
 
22 
 
Concomitant use of other drugs is regularly identified as a confounding factor in research in 
ecstasy users. It is often argued that use of other drugs is at least partly responsible for effects 
seen in ecstasy using populations. It is for this reason that the decision was taken to conduct 
analysis on ecstasy users compared to controls that are at least matched in some way for use 
of other drugs. Furthermore, radiotracers used in studies included in this meta-analysis, 
should have a reasonable selectivity for SERTs. Other co-used drugs are not known for their 
effects on 5-HT, for example alcohol use is not associated with SERT alterations in humans 
(Martinez et al., 2009) and cannabis and cocaine are not known for toxic effects on 5-HT 
axons. Moreover polydrug users have often been observed to show no differences in SERT 
binding compared to drug naïve controls (Buchert et al., 2004; Selvaraj et al., 2009).  
Many of the studies included in the current analysis used small samples, which is potentially 
a reason for the asymmetrical funnel plot observed with the data. However small samples can 
also lead to concerns over the reliability of the data. Reliability concerns and variability in 
effects of ecstasy/MDMA on SERT and 5-HT2A receptors from molecular imaging studies 
suggested that a meta-analysis was necessary, using all of the available data, so to draw more 
concrete conclusions about ecstasy/MDMA related serotonergic neuroadaptations.  
Finally, concerns have been raised about the reliability of β-CIT-SPECT and [11C]McN-
5652 for detecting neocortical SERT density (Heinz & Jones, 2000; Parsley et al., 2000). 
These areas have comparatively low densities of SERT relative to subcortical regions and 
thus have a worse signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, these two radio tracers, whilst showing 
SERT specific binding in the brainstem and thalamus, do not show SERT specific binding in 
the cerebral cortex. As such, the reliability of some of the early work in this area using these 
radio-ligands need interpreting with caution. Moreover, 3 original articles included in the 
current analysis used these less reliable radio-ligands, and is therefore a limitation for 
interpretation of the current analysis. 
  
 
23 
 
To conclude, our meta-analytic investigation suggests that SERT availability is reduced 
significantly in current ecstasy users relative to polydrug controls/controls with some 
polydrug use in all areas of the neocortex and limbic system, with areas requiring longer axon 
projection being most vulnerable to toxicity. The meta-analysis also suggests that SERT rich 
regions of the subcortex (putamen, caudate and midbrain) are unaffected by ecstasy use. 
Review of the postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor data suggests that there may also be some 
compensatory upregulation of receptors in neocortical areas. The clinical significance of 
these findings is speculative, however it is conceivable that the observed effects of SERT and 
5-HT2A receptors contribute to mood disorders associated with ecstasy/MDMA use, as well as 
other psychobiological sequelae, such as altered neuroendocrine function. Furthermore the 
observed effects on the serotonin system inferred from the current analysis, may underpin the 
many neurocognitive deficits observed in ecstasy users.
