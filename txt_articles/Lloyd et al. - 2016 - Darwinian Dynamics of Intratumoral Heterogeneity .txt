Abstract
Spatial heterogeneity in tumors is generally thought to result
from branching clonal evolution driven by random mutations that
accumulate during tumor development. However, this concept
rests on the implicit assumption that cancer cells never evolve to
a fitness maximum because they can always acquire mutations that
increase proliferative capacity. In this study, we investigated the
validity of this assumption. Using evolutionary game theory, we
demonstratethatlocalcancer cellpopulationswill rapidlyconverge
tothe fittest phenotype givena stableenvironment. In suchsettings,
cellular spatial heterogeneity in a tumor will be largely governed by
regional variations in environmental conditions, for example,
alterations in blood flow. Model simulations specifically predict
a common spatial pattern in which cancer cells at the tumor–host
interface exhibit invasion-promoting, rapidly proliferating pheno-
typic properties, whereas cells in the tumor core maximize their
population density by promoting supportive tissue infrastructures,
for example, topromoteangiogenesis.Wetestedmodel predictions
through detailed quantitative image analysis of phenotypic spatial
distribution in histologic sections of 10 patients with stage 2
invasive breast cancers. CAIX, GLUT1, and Ki67 were upregulated
in the tumor edge, consistent with an acid-producing invasive,
proliferative phenotype. Cells in the tumor core were 20% denser
than the edge, exhibiting upregulation of CAXII, HIF-1^
I�, and
cleaved caspase-3, consistent with a more static and less prolifer-
ative phenotype. Similarly, vascularity was consistently lower in the
tumor center compared with the tumor edges. Lymphocytic
immune responses to tumor antigens also trended to higher level
in the tumor edge, although this effect did not reach statistical
significance. Like invasive species in nature, cancer cells at the
leading edge of the tumor possess a different phenotype from cells
in the tumor core. Our results suggest that at least some of the
molecular heterogeneity in cancer cells in tumors is governed by
predictable regional variations in environmental selection forces,
arguing against the assumption that cancer cells can evolve toward
a local fitness maximum by random accumulation of mutations.

Introduction
Although patient-specific, precision therapy remains an impor-
tant goal in oncology, treatment strategies based on static and
non-spatial data can belimited as somatic evolution continuously
alters the tumor environments and cell populations over space
and time (1). For example, recent studies demonstrate significant
intratumoral spatial heterogeneity in the molecular properties of
cancer cells in several tumor types (2–4). These regional variations
are widely recognized as evidence of intratumoral evolution, but
the proposed dynamics typically focus on random acquisition of
mutations that confer a fitness advantage resulting in a "selective
sweep" (5, 6) by the new population. An important clinical
implication of this conventional "clonal branching" model is
that intratumoral molecular heterogeneity, because it is depen-
dent on stochastic accumulation of mutations, must be funda-
mentally unpredictable.
An implicit assumption of conventional models of intratu-
moral evolution is that cancer cells do not achieve a fitness
maximum so that cancer cells can always undergo mutations that
increase their fitness allowing a new population to emerge even
within a static environment. In contrast, we note that very differ-
ent dynamics will results if tumor cells, like most species in nature,
rapidly evolve to local fitness maximum (7) so that no heritable
change can further increase its fitness. In fact, under such condi-
tions, the population will tend converge to a single dominant

Major Findings
Like invasive species in nature, cancer cells at the leading
edge of the tumor possess a different phenotype from cells in
the tumor core. We conclude that at least some intratumoral
heterogeneity in the molecular properties of cancer cells is
governed by predictable regional variations in environmental
selection forces.

Major Assumptions
1
Species are identical in all ways except for the values of their strategies.
2
The strategy u represents investment along a continuum of all CAIX (u ¼ 0Þ and all CAXII (u ¼ 1Þ.
3
A tradeoff exists between fitness in the two habitats, where qFA/ qu > 0 and qFB/ qu < 0.
4
There are diminishing returns in fitness in habitat A from increasing u and to fitness in B from decreasing u, where q2FA/ qu2 < 0
and q2FB/ qu2 < 0.
5
Individuals compete with each other for limiting resources within each habitat, so fitness within a habitat declines with an
increase of individuals within that habitat, where qFA/ qxA < 0 and qFB/ qxB < 0.
6
Migration rates mA and mB are passive in that we assume that mA and mB are independent of strategies, u, and species population

 phenotype, resulting in decreasing heterogeneity. Thus, in this
alternative model of cancer evolution, spatial variation of phe-
notypes must result from local variations in environmental factors
that select for different phenotypic properties. For example,
regions of low blood flow, a common observation in tumor
imaging, will select for tumors that are optimally adapted to
environmental conditions that include reduced availability of
substrate and blood-derived growth factors. Importantly, in con-
trast with the conventional model, this approach requires molec-
ular characteristics of cancer cells to be non-random. That is, the
local phenotypic properties of cancer cells should be generally
predictable with sufficient understanding of local environmental
properties and Darwinian dynamics (8).
Here, we frame this hypothesis using mathematical models
from evolutionary game theory (9, 10). The quantitative methods
extend prior work that applied classic evolutionary trade-offs
between fecundity and survivorship. That is, we propose cancer
cells, like all evolving organisms, can invest resources to maximize
fecundity or survivorship but not both (11). This Darwinian
trade-off manifests in cancer cells as two tumor cell types roughly
correspond to what is known as r and K selection (12) where "r"
refers to a species with maximal growth rate (capacity to grow at
low population densities) as opposed to "K" referring to a species
that maximizes its carrying capacity (capacity to maintain growth
at high population densities).
Although based on simple evolutionary first principles, the
model leads to complex and variable spatial and temporal pop-
ulation. However, we find that the model does consistently
predict one property of the tumor ecology—that the cancer cells
at the tumor–host interface will demonstrate phenotypic prop-
erties that are consistent between tumors, but very different from
the properties of cells deeper within the same tumor. We then
examine model predictions through detailed, quantitative anal-
ysis of spatial distribution of phenotypic properties in histologic
sections taken from 10 patients with stage 2 invasive breast
cancers.
Materials and Methods
All clinical components of the study were completed with the
approval of the University of South Florida Institutional Review
Board. Participant's written consent was not obtained because all
personal health information was de-identified and analyzed
anonymously. The Moffitt Scientific Review Committee and Uni-
versity of South Florida IRB committee both approved this pro-
tocol (MCC 16511).
Mathematical model
We investigate a mathematical model from evolutionary game
theory of habitat heterogeneity (12), in which we envision two
habitats, the core of the tumor versus the tumor edge. We assume
that cancer cells can evolve whereas normal cells do not. However,
normal mesenchymal cells retain phenotypic plasticity and may
be influenced and/or co-opted by the tumor cells to generate a
tissue infrastructure that favors cancer growth. Within a habitat,
we assume that the cancer cells compete for limiting resources but
do not interact directly with cells in the other habitat. Indirectly,
however, their habitats do interact via migration where a fraction
of the population form each habitat actively moves into the
adjacent habitat or find themselves in that habitat as the edge of
the tumor either recedes, expands or shifts location.
We imagine an evolutionary strategy that represents a trade-
off between capacities to produce carbonic anhydrase (CA),
CAXII versus CAIX. CAIX and XII are extracellular enzymes that
catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and a
proton:
CO2 þ H2O $ HCO�
3 þ Hþ
CAIX is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose catalytic domain
faces the extracellular milieu (13). CAXII has a similar overall
secondary structure and orientation to CAIX, although missing
the PG-like domain. CAIX sets the extracellular pH at 6.8 whereas
CAXII sets the extracellular pH at 7.4. We use this difference in
extracellular pH set point as markers for phenotypic strategy. It is
also reported that CAIX is a poor prognostic indicator and CAXII is
a positive prognostic indicator in breast cancer (14).
The buffering and habitat modulating properties of CAXII
promotes or are associated with higher carrying capacity (K) and
lower maximum proliferation rates (r)—such a species empha-
sizing CAXII is "K-selected." The acid-tolerating properties of
CAIX promotes or are associated with resistance to the immune
system, degradation of normal cells, and higher proliferation
rates—such a species is "r-selected." We scale the heritable strat-
egy, u, to range from u ¼ 0 (maximum carrying capacity K and
minimum growth rate r) to u ¼ 1 (minimum K and maximal r).
Via competition within habitats and migration between habi-
tats, the tumor cells engage in an evolutionary game in which an
individual's fitness, Gðu; u; xA; xBÞ, depends upon its strategy, u,
the strategies of the other tumor cells, u, and population sizes of
tumor cells in the interior (A) and edge (B) of the tumor, xA and
xB, respectively. The evolutionary dynamics of the cancer cell
strategies can be visualized on an adaptive landscape. This land-
scape plots G versus the strategy of the focal individual, u. The
adaptive landscape is fixed for a given tumor population with its
associated strategies and population sizes. But, as the populations'
strategies evolve (evolutionary dynamics) and their associated
population sizes change (ecological dynamics) the landscape also
changes. Hence, the landscape itself is dynamic in response to the
Darwinian dynamics of strategies and population sizes (15). At
any time and point along this landscape the population will
evolve "uphill" until it reaches a convergent stable point—at this
point, the slope of the landscape is zero (qG=qv ¼ 0), and the
population sizes equilibrate so that fitness is 0 (G ¼ 0). This
convergent stable point can either be at a maximum or minimum
of the adaptive landscape (16). If at a maximum, then the cancer
has evolved to its evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) and such a
state will be both ecologically and evolutionarily persistent. If at a
minimum, then the cancer cell population is under strong dis-
ruptive selection and it should "speciate" into two distinct clades
that diverge and evolve to occupy distinct niches seen as distinct
peaks of the adaptive landscape (17).
Further methods, details, and theories of the game theory
model and image analysis strategies may be found in Supple-
mentary Material.
Case selection
Following approval by the Institutional Review Board, 10
patients with formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
blocks of diagnosed invasive ductal breast carcinoma were retro-
spectively examined. Cases were selected by a practicing pathol-
ogist (M.M. Bui) to include five each of the three Nottingham
score grades.

 Histology
Sectioning. The Tissue Core at Moffitt located each FFPE block and
4-mm serial slides from each patient were sectioned using standard
histotechnique.
Immunohistochemical staining
Slides were stained using a Ventana Discovery XT automated
system (Ventana Medical Systems) as per the manufacturer's
protocol with proprietary reagents. Slides were deparaffinized on
the automated system with EZ Prep solution (Ventana).
For the CD34 staining, the mouse monoclonal antibody
CMA334 (Cell Marque) was used at a prediluted concentration
and incubated for 16 minutes. The Ventana OmniMap anti-
mouse secondary antibody was incubated for 12 minutes. Ven-
tana ChromoMap was used for detection.
For the KI67 staining, the rabbit primary antibody #790-4286
(Ventana) was applied and incubated for 16 minutes. The Ven-
tana anti-rabbit secondary was incubated for 16 minutes. The
detection system was OmniMap.
To stain for CAIX, the rabbit primary antibody #ab15086
(Abcam) was used at a 1:500 concentration in Dako antibody
diluent and incubated for 32 minutes. The OmniMap anti-rabbit
secondary was used for 20 minutes. ChromoMap was used for
detection.
For CAXII, the rabbit primary antibody #HPA008773 (Sigma)
was used at a 1:75 concentration in Dako antibody diluent and
incubated for 32 minutes. The OmniMap anti-rabbit secondary
was used for 20 minutes. The detection system was ChromoMap.
Each set was counter stained with hematoxylin then dehydrated
and coverslipped per standard histologic protocol.
Imaging and analysis
Image acquisition. Stained slides were digitally scanned using the
Aperio (Vista) ScanScope XT high-throughput slide scanning
instrument (200�/0.75NA objective with a rate of 2–3 minutes
per slide via Basler tri-linear array).
Segmentation. Histology pattern recognition technology used
included both Aperio's GENIE software and Definiens (Munich,
Germany) TissueStudio v3.0 to identify tumor regions of interest
(26, 27). Regions of the tumor edge were defined as areas within 1
mm of the tumor–host interface and tumor center regions were
defined as any area deeper than 1 mm of the tumor–host interface.
For each measurement a 500 � 500 mm subregion was randomly
selected using a custom Matlab (R2014b) script. Three subregions
were used for each analysis of the center or edge regions for each
patient sample. Furthermore, single cells were identified as tumor
and mesenchymal regions, respectively, by identifying the nuclei
and growing cell simulations 5 mm. The classified nuclear and
cytoplasmic subcellular compartments were evaluated indepen-
dently for biomarkers that localize to a specific cellular region.
Intensity thresholds from each biomarker were determined by the
study pathologist (M.M. Bui) and retained consistently for each
patient set.
Results
Cancer adaptive landscapes and intratumoral evolution
Although tumors likely possess a large number of ecologic
niches, our model simulations focused on just two: (i) the tumor–
host interface in which tumor cells compete primarily interact
with elements of normal tissue, including the predatory effects of
the immune response and normal tissue infrastructure such as
intact blood vessels and (ii) the interior in which tumor cells
compete with each other and must actively promote formation
of the mesenchymal infrastructure required to support the
population.
If the population of tumor cells is well-mixed between edge and
interior of the tumor (high migration rate, m), then evolution
promotes an ESS that is a single clone (Fig. 1). This clone possesses
a generalist strategy balancing the need for a higher r when facing
the edge habitat and a higher K when facing the interior. No
matter the starting strategy of the population, it will evolve toward
the same peak of the adaptive landscape. We expect this outcome
when either the spatial heterogeneity of habitat types is very fine
grained, or the cells for some reason are highly motile and
frequently move from one habitat to the next, which itself could
be a response to environmental selective pressures (18). For larger
more advanced tumors, we would expect edge and interior
habitats to be more coarse grained, and the likelihood of a given
tumor cell moving from one to the other to be relatively small on a
per 8 to 24 hours basis (the likely unit of time in our model).
If the migration rate is small, an axis of heterogeneity describing
the edge to interior of the tumor can result in the speciation of a
single clonal cancer lineage into two distinct phenotypes special-
ized to exploit different regions of tumor heterogeneity (Fig. 2). If
the tumor starts with a single evolving population of cancer cells,
then these cells evolve up the slope of the adaptive landscape. But
instead of achieving a peak, they actually evolve to an evolution-
arily stable minimum on the landscape. At this point, disruptive
selection should promote speciation and the divergence of
Figure 1.

environment where the migration
rate is high (m ¼ 0.1). The initial

 separate tumor cell types. The one being K-selected (CAXII) and
the other r-selected (CAIX). Although some spatial overlap will
occur between the two types, the former will predominate in the
interior of the tumor and the latter at the tumor's edge.
More generally the model shows how the grain-size of habitat
heterogeneity and the motility of tumor cells will determine
whether tumor heterogeneity promotes generalist versus more
specialist tumor "species." Figure 3 shows how low migration
rates promote speciation and divergent strategies among the
tumor cells. As the migration rate increases, the values of the two
strategies comprising the ESS begin to converge and do so at a
critical threshold value of migration. At higher rates of migration
above this threshold, the ESS is a single species with a generalist
strategy (Fig. 3).
In summary, the model simulations demonstrate that selection
forces in the tumor core favor tumor cells with "engineering"
phenotypes that maximize carrying capacity by promoting angio-
genesis and aggressively competing for limited resources. Con-
versely, the tumor cells at the leading edge (i.e., the tumor-host
interface) possess "pioneering" phenotypes that maximize their
invest resources in invasive strategies that permit them to acquire
resources through co-opting normal vessels and other host
mesenchyma even at the expense of a potentially higher death
rate due to host response. Thus, in general our models predict
"engineering" phenotypes will dominate the tumor core whereas
cells at the leading edge of tumor will exhibit phenotypes that can
pioneer in a novel, and sometimes hostile environment. Inter-
estingly, this prediction is consistent with observations in nature
that "weedy" phenotypes (i.e., higher maximum proliferation
rates at the expense of lower carrying capacities) predominate at
the leading edge of a population invasion when compared with
individuals in regions far from the propagating border (19).
Clinical analysis
As described above, the evolutionary models predict observ-
able changes in the neoplastic cells and the environment in both
the center and edge regions of a tumor. We tested these model
predictions with clinical analysis of histologic sections evaluated
by quantitative image analysis. Our clinical results indicate a
number of consistently observed and quantified changes in cell
Figure 2.
Evolution of a population of cells in an
environment where the migration rate
is low (m ¼ 0.001). Again, the initial
population begins with a strategy of
u ¼ 0.5 and begins to climb the
adaptive landscape (top left). Instead
of achieving a peak, the population
actually evolves to an evolutionarily
stable minima of the landscape at
u ¼ 0.3677 (top right). Disruptive
selection causes the single population
to diverge into two separate species.
The one being K-selected is shown as
species 1 in red and evolves to an ESS
of u ¼ 0.0774. The other being r-
selected is shown as species 2 in blue
and evolved to an ESS of u ¼ 0.4074
(bottom).

two distinct strategies occurs at low migration rates (m < 0.012). At high
migration rates (m > 0.012), the values of the two strategies converge to a

in Fig. 1 and the dynamics of m ¼ 0.001 are shown in Fig. 2.

 density, cell proliferation, cell death, cell aggression, acidosis, and
hypoxia in both locations (each measured in triplicate) of histo-
logic samples of 10 invasive breast cancer patients. Furthermore,
the presence of lymphocytes and vascular resources in the micro-
environment were measured in triplicate in both locations of the
same tumors (See Table 1 and Fig. 4).
First, the tumor cell density was evaluated. We used a partially
hierarchical ANOVA (SYSTAT version 13) to test for the effects of
tumor cell density (number of tumor cells per area) and habitat
(tumor center vs. tumor edge; each with triplicate sampling) for
each of 10 patients. These analyses were calculated by quantifying
the number events (as indicated as the number of tumor cells or,
for each biomarker, strongly expressing tumor cells) within a 500
by 500 mm subregion. Each subregion was extracted randomly, in
triplicate, from within 1 mm of the mesenchymal interface for
edge samples and beyond 1 mm from the mesenchymal interface
for center regions. The cell density model provided a good fit to
the data (multiple r2 ¼ 0.72). The patient [F-Ratio ¼ 0.49, not
significant (n.s.)] was not found to influence the ratio of cell
counts per region so that the tissue slices provided roughly the
same ratio of cancer cells regardless of patient. Cancer cell abun-
dances varied significantly by center and edge region (F-Ratio ¼
15.39, P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio ¼ 9.20, P < 0.001). This
indicates that cells in the tumor center out-numbered cells at
the tumor edge consistently across all patients with statistical
significance.
Second, the tumor cell proliferation was evaluated by evidence
of Ki-67 expression across tumor cells in triplicate for both regions
for the same 10 patients. The model also provided a good fit to the
data (multiple r2 ¼ 0.88). Again the patient (F-Ratio ¼ 2.74, n.s.)
was not found to influence the ratio of Ki67-positive cells per
region so that the tissue slices provided roughly the same ratio
of Ki67 positivity regardless of patient. Proliferation varied
very significantly by center and edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 73.58,
P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio ¼ 21.56, P < 0.001). This
indicates that proliferative cells in the tumor edge consistently
out-numbered cells in the tumor center across all patients with
statistical significance.
Next, the tumor cell death by apoptosis was evaluated by
evidence of cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) expression across tumor

 cells in triplicate for both regions for the same 10 patients. The
model also provided a good fit to the data (multiple r2 ¼ 0.84).
Here, CC3 expression varied very significantly by center and
edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 45.23, P < 0.001) for all patients (F-
Ratio¼12.04, P < 0.001). This indicates that apoptosis in the
tumor center consistently out-numbered cells in the tumor edge
across all patients with statistical significance.
Then, a number of additional metabolomic biomarkers that
indicate tumor cell aggression, acidosis, glycolysis, and hypoxia
were tested. Aggressive, acid producing cells should be consis-
tently observed in the tumor edge whereas cells in vascularized
regions of the remainder of the tumor should be functioning in
normal pHe. To test model predictions, we examined the spatial
distribution of CAIX and XII as biomarkers for regional high
and low acidity, respectively.
The model provided a good fit to the CAIX data (multiple r2 ¼
0.91) and the CAXII data (multiple r2 ¼ 0.93). CAIX expression
varied very significantly by center and edge region (F-Ratio ¼
255.77, P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio ¼ 7.88, P < 0.001)
whereas CAXII expression varied very significantly by center and
edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 329.27, P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio
¼ 12.50, P < 0.001). This indicates that CAIX-expressing cells in
the tumor edge consistently out-numbered cells in the tumor
center across all patients with statistical significance when the
converse is true of CAXII, which consistently has higher expression
in the tumor center across all patients with statistical significance.
This matched with the predictions of the evolutionary mathe-
matical models (Fig. 5).
Glycose transporter 1 (GLUT1), also known as solute carrier
family 2 facilitated glucose transporter member 1 (SLC2A1;
multiple r2 ¼ 0.93) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a;
multiple r2 ¼ 0.86) measurements were similarly modeled.
GLUT1 expression varied very significantly by center and edge
region (F-Ratio ¼ 148.70, P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio ¼
22.08, P < 0.001) whereas HIF1a expression varied very signif-
icantly by center and edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 13.40, P ¼ 0.001) for
all patients (F-Ratio ¼ 24.44, P < 0.001). This indicates that
GLUT1-expressing cells in the tumor edge consistently out-num-
bered cells in the tumor center across all patients with statistical
significance when the converse is true of HIF1a, which consis-
tently has higher expression in the tumor center across all patients
with statistical significance.
Finally, two aspects of the environment were quantified: The
vascular density (number and area of vasculature) and the density
of lymphocytes per region area. The number of blood vessels per
area (multiple r2 ¼ 0.80), the area of vascular involvement
(multiple r2 ¼ 0.77) and the density of lymphocytes (multiple
r2 ¼ 0.79) were modeled. The number of blood vessel per area
varied significantly by center and edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 22.48,
P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio ¼ 12.66, P < 0.001) whereas the
area of vascular involvement varied significantly by center and
edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 16.85, P < 0.001) for all patients (F-Ratio ¼
11.62, P < 0.001) whereas lymphocytic density did not vary
significantly by center and edge region (F-Ratio ¼ 0.057, n.s.)
but was consistent for all patients (F-Ratio ¼ 14.71, P < 0.001).
This indicates that the number and area of vasculature was
statistically greater at the tumor edge than in the tumor center
across all patients; however, the lymphocytes were statistically
similar in both the edge and center regions across all patients.
Non-specific staining of one of the patients may have resulted in
an artificially high patient interaction effect. When this patient's
samples were removed the trend remained constant for the center
to edge effect (F-Ratio ¼ 27.25, P < 0.001) and the patient effect
was reduced to (F-Ratio ¼ 2.89, n.s.). The lymphocytic response,
taken together with the tumor cell density does, however, indicate
that the ratio of lymphocytes to tumor cells is consistently high at
the tumor edge (where the tumor cell density is lower than the
center).
Overall, the biomarker measures of tumor cells are strikingly
segregated by center and edge regions. This species by habitat
interaction contributes most to the explained variation within the
statistical model (see Table 1 for a statistical summary for each
biomarker by region interaction). See Fig. 6 for a graphical
representation of each data point.
Discussion
The conventional model of intratumoral evolution allows
new "driver" mutations to accumulate indefinitely, resulting in
branching clonal evolution. This conceptual model implicitly
assumes that tumor cells never achieve a local fitness maximum
so that new mutations can always generate a novel (and fitter)
genotype and phenotype. Here, we explore an alternative model
in which cancer cells may evolve to an evolutionary stable state
(ESS) and, thus, cannot be displaced by new strategies if the
environment remains stable. This would lead to local phenotypic
convergences so that regional molecular variations, rather than
the result of random mutations, would represent reasonably
predictable phenotypic adaptations to changes in environment
conditions such as blood flow, as described in the results, and via
conventional clinical imaging such as MRI. This model would be
supported by identification of a simple, consistent spatial varia-
tion in tumor molecular properties that emerged directly from
fundamental evolutionary dynamics.
Here, we framed this hypothesis mathematically using evolu-
tionary game theory. Although built on a simple conceptual
model, computer simulations demonstrate the ecological dynam-
ics within cancers can be quite complex and highly variable from
Figure 5.
Experimental and mathematical model results showing the percentage of
total cells counted in the center and edge that expressed either CAIX or CAXII.
Experimental results showed that 90% of the cells in the center of the
tumors expressed CAXII, whereas only 10% expressed CAIX. Conversely, 63%
of the cells in at the edge of the tumors expressed CAIX. The mathematical
model showed that 97% of the cells in the center would express CAXII
and 96% of the cells at the edge would express CAIX.

 tumor to tumor. However, a common pattern emerged as our
models predicted cancer cells at the invasive front of the tumor
will consistently possess distinct phenotypic properties when
compared with the cells in the core. Interestingly, similar patterns
of distinctive phenotypes at the leading edge have been observed
in biological invasions such as the cane toad in Australia (20) and
the house sparrow in Kenya (21).
Detailed analysis of spatialmolecular heterogeneityin10clinical
breast cancers demonstrates a consistent regional distribution in
which proliferation, the ratiooftumor cellstolymphocytes, GLUT1
and CAIX expression were higher at the tumor edge. Conversely,
tumor cell density, apoptosis, HIF1a and CAXII expression were
observed to be greater in the tumor center. We also investigated the
location of increased vascularity and cell death. Although the
number of clinical tumors is small, we note that the results are
highly statistically significant. Furthermore, other clinical studies
have observed changes in gene expression in the edge of cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma (22, 23) and colon cancer (24).
Our results are similar to the variations in favorable and
unfavorable gene signatures within the same tumor reported in
prior studies (1, 3). For example, our results show that positive
prognostic (CAXII) and negative prognostic (CAIX) biomarkers
are routinely observed in the same tumor but different regions.
Importantly, however, we can clearly identify the Darwinian
dynamics that produced this spatial variation, and thus place this
regional heterogeneity within an ecologic and evolutionary con-
text. This may have clinical implications because it supports the
hypothesis that at least some intratumoral heterogeneity in the
molecular properties of cancer cells can be predicted on the basis
of the local environmental selection forces, which can be defined
by clinical imaging (25–27).
Our results suggest a number of important avenues for future
investigation. Because clinical cancer imaging can depict spatial
variations in perfusion, it should be possible to estimate some
molecular variations based on imaging. In addition, it seems clear
that some current prognostic and predictive molecular biomar-
kers that can be observed in different regions of the same tumor,
such as CAIX and CAXII, can be accurately evaluated and reported
only in a spatial context.
