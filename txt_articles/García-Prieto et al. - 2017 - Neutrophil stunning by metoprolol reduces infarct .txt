The b1-adrenergic-receptor (ADRB1) antagonist metoprolol reduces infarct size in acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. The prevailing view has been that metoprolol acts
mainly on cardiomyocytes. Here, we demonstrate that metoprolol reduces reperfusion injury
by targeting the haematopoietic compartment. Metoprolol inhibits neutrophil migration in an
ADRB1-dependent manner. Metoprolol acts during early phases of neutrophil recruitment by
impairing structural and functional rearrangements needed for productive engagement of
circulating platelets, resulting in erratic intravascular dynamics and blunted inflammation.
Depletion of neutrophils, ablation of Adrb1 in haematopoietic cells, or blockade of PSGL-1, the
receptor involved in neutrophil–platelet interactions, fully abrogated metoprolol’s infarct-
limiting effects. The association between neutrophil count and microvascular obstruction is
abolished in metoprolol-treated AMI patients. Metoprolol inhibits neutrophil–platelet
interactions in AMI patients by targeting neutrophils. Identification of the relevant role of
ADRB1 in haematopoietic cells during acute injury and the protective role upon its modulation
offers potential for developing new therapeutic strategies.

eart attack (acute myocardial infarction, AMI) is one of
the principal manifestations of cardiovascular disease and
a chief contributor to mortality and morbidity worldwide.
The main determinant of poor outcome post AMI is the extent of
irreversible injury (infarct size). The mainstay of AMI treatment
is rapid reperfusion to restore blood flow, which reduces
complications and improves survival. However, reperfusion itself
accelerates and exacerbates the inflammatory response associated
with myocardial injury1. Thus, the injury inflicted on the
myocardium during AMI is the result of ischaemia and
reperfusion processes, and is known as ischaemia/reperfusion
(IR) injury. The development of effective therapies to reduce
myocardial IR injury is an unmet clinical need2.
The injured myocardium is infiltrated by circulating neutro-
phils, and these cells are critically involved in myocardial
IR injury3–7. In an inflammatory milieu, neutrophils bind to
platelets and red blood cells, forming plugs7. Upon reperfusion,
these plugs are dispersed into the microcirculation, where they
form embolisms, precluding tissue perfusion despite blood flow
restoration in the large coronary arteries. This phenomenon,
known
as
microvascular
obstruction
(MVO),
is
a
major
contributor to IR injury and infarct size1. Moreover, neutrophil
infiltration into acutely damaged organs is dependent on their
interaction with platelets8, and these interactions are critical to
the formation of harmful co-aggregates and the initiation of
inflammatory-like responses before tissue infiltration3,8. Overall,
neutrophil dynamics (including neutrophil–platelet interactions)
are an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention of IR injury.
The
intravenous
(i.v.)
administration
of
the
selective
b1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) antagonist metoprolol has been
shown to reduce infarct size and improve long-term cardiac
function after AMI in the recent METOCARD-CNIC trial9,10.
The
mechanism
underlying
metoprolol’s
cardioprotective
effect remains unclear11. Identifying this mechanism could have
significant implications for the understanding of IR and the
development of novel infarct-limiting therapies. The adrenergic
system is critically involved in inflammatory reactions12,13.
In
particular,
the
inflammatory
response
of
neutrophils
involves the de novo production and release by these cells of
catecholamines12,13. Induced catecholamine stress (as during
ischaemia)
alters
neutrophil
trafficking14–16
and
promotes
formation of neutrophil–platelet co-aggregates17.
We hypothesized that pre-reperfusion i.v. metoprolol admin-
istration alters neutrophil dynamics, resulting in a dampened
inflammatory response, less severe reperfusion injury and smaller
infarcts. Here we show that pre-reperfusion administration of i.v.
metoprolol to AMI patients significantly reduces the incidence of
MVO,
and
moreover
that
metoprolol
inhibits
deleterious
neutrophil inflammatory responses both in patients and in
animal models of IR. The infarct-limiting effect of metoprolol is
abolished in neutrophil-depleted mice and when neutrophils are
prevented from interacting with platelets. The beneficial effects of
metoprolol are also abolished by genetic ablation of Adrb1 and
are
rescued
by
restitution
of
Adrb1
expression
only
in
haematopoietic cells. These results identify the neutrophil
dynamics as the target of the cardioprotective effect of metoprolol
against myocardial IR injury.
Results
Intravenous metoprolol reduces MVO in AMI patients. The
METOCARD-CNIC trial recruited patients with an ongoing
acute ST-segment elevation AMI and randomized them to receive
i.v. metoprolol (15 mg) or control before reperfusion18. A total of
220 AMI patients underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) imaging exam 1 week after AMI. To study the potential
mechanisms underlying the infarct-limiting effect of metoprolol9,
we analysed the 1-week CMR data to evaluate the extent of
MVO. MVO was defined as the absence of contrast wash-in
inside
the
delayed
gadolinium-enhanced
area19,
and
was
quantified as grams of left ventricle (LV) (Fig. 1a,b and
Supplementary Fig 1a,b). Patients treated with metoprolol
during ongoing AMI had a 40% lower extent of MVO (Fig. 1c).
This significant effect was maintained after adjusting for factors
potentially
affecting
MVO
by
performing
linear
multiple
regression analysis and including sex, age, ischaemia duration,
diabetes, and use of thrombectomy or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
inhibitors as covariates. To exclude the possibility that this effect
simply reflected the reduction in total infarct size9, MVO was
further assessed as a percentage of the infarcted area (total late
gadolinium enhanced area). Metoprolol-treated patients had
24%
less
infarct-normalized
MVO
than
control
patients
(Fig. 1d). As expected, the extent of MVO was significantly
associated with poor long-term outcome, evaluated as chronic
ventricular performance (Supplementary Fig. 1c). These data
suggest
that
MVO
reduction
might
be
involved
in
the
cardioprotective effect of metoprolol administration in patients
during ongoing AMI.
Intravenous metoprolol dampens neutrophilial–MVO association
in AMI. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during
an AMI are known to be associated with larger infarct sizes and
extensive
MVO20–22.
We
explored
these
associations
in
AMI patients from the METOCARD-CNIC trial. We found
a significant positive correlation between absolute leukocyte
count on admission and the extent of MVO on CMR: the higher
the leukocyte count, the larger the extent of MVO (Fig. 2a).
We further studied the association of the different WBC
subpopulations and MVO. As expected, neutrophil count was
significantly correlated with the extent of MVO (Fig. 2b).
Conversely, there was no sign of association between other
WBC
subpopulations
and
MVO:
lymphocyte,
monocyte,
eosinophil or platelet counts did not correlate with the extent
of MVO (Fig. 2e). Next, we studied the effect of metoprolol on
WBCs and on the association between these and MVO.
Metoprolol treatment was not associated with any different in
WBC count nor in any WBC subpopulation (Supplementary
Table 1). Of note, we found a significant interaction between
metoprolol treatment and the correlation between leukocyte
count and MVO: the significant positive correlation between
neutrophil count and the extent of MVO was only present in
control patients (that is, not receiving metoprolol); in patients
receiving i.v. metoprolol before reperfusion there was no sign of
association between total leukocyte or neutrophil counts and the
extent of MVO (Fig. 2c,d). These results suggest that the
administration of i.v. metoprolol during ongoing AMI do not
affect the circulating levels of WBCs but modulates the impact of
neutrophils on MVO.
Metoprolol blunts neutrophil infiltration in experimental IR.
To identify the factors underlying the metoprolol-induced
reduction in MVO within the reperfused myocardium, we
examined a mouse model of in vivo myocardial IR injury
(Fig. 3a). Given the observed modulator effect of i.v. metoprolol
in the association between neutrophil count and MVO in patients
suffering an AMI, we focused our attention into this cell
population.
We
first
tested
the
infarct-limiting
effect
of
metoprolol in wild-type mice by occluding the left anterior
descending (LAD) coronary artery for 45 min followed by
reperfusion. Mice were randomized to receive a single i.v. bolus
(50 ml) of metoprolol (10 mM) or vehicle (saline) 35 min after

 ischaemia onset (10 min before reperfusion). Infarct size was
evaluated at 24 h reperfusion by TTC staining and normalized to
area at risk (AAR, negative Evans blue staining). Metoprolol-
treated mice had significantly smaller infarcts (as % of AAR) than
vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3b–d). Next, we examined mice
carrying a GFP reporter in myeloid derived cells (LysM-GFP).

 obliteration (a histological surrogate for MVO) and leukocyte
infiltration were quantified at 6 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 3e–m).
Metoprolol administration during ongoing AMI resulted in a
significant reduction of capillary obliteration by circulatory cell
plugins when evaluated at 6 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 3e,f).
Confocal microscopy analyses revealed a significant reduction in
the number of myeloid cells plugins (LysM-GFP þ particles)
and percentage of LysM-GFP þ area within the LV sections,
indicating rapid inhibition of leukocyte recruitment and protec-
tion of lumen vessel patency (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 2a–d
and Supplementary Movie 1). Temporal (6 and 24 h) evaluation
of myeloid-derived cells infiltration into injured myocardium
showed
a
persistent
abrogation
of
neutrophil
infiltration
(Fig. 3h–m and Supplementary Movie 2) and a differential
relative proportion of different myeloid cells in hearts from
metoprolol and vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3j and Supplementary
Fig. 3). These mouse experiments confirm the clinical findings
that pre-reperfusion metoprolol administration during ongoing
AMI limits infarct size and reduces MVO, and further show that
metoprolol reduces neutrophil infiltration, suggesting neutrophils
as a potential target in this cardioprotective effect.
Metoprolol does not protect from AMI in the absence of
neutrophils. Catecholamine-stimulation of bARs alters neu-
trophil function, cytokine release and neutrophil–platelet aggre-
gate formation17,23,24, processes associated with aggravated injury
during AMI (refs 25–27). To decipher the role of neutrophils in
the protection afforded by metoprolol during ongoing AMI, we
evaluated the effect of the drug in the absence of neutrophils.
Neutrophil depletion in mouse peripheral blood was achieved by
administration of an anti-Ly6G mAb over 2 days8,28. After
neutrophil depletion, animals were subjected to myocardial IR,
and infarct size was evaluated at 24 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 3n).
Confirming earlier reports29, neutrophil-depleted mice had
smaller infarcts than controls. Administration of metoprolol to
these mice during ongoing AMI did not reduce infarct size
(Fig. 3o–q). The abrogation of the cardioprotective effect of
metoprolol confirms circulating neutrophils as a target of the
beneficial effect associated with this pharmacological therapy.
Metoprolol inhibits neutrophil migration by targeting ADRB1.

 evaluated in a chemokine-induced transwell migration assay
and by evaluation of the chemotactic FPR activator-peptide,
W-peptide30, -induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
assay31. First, neutrophils were exposed across the transwell filter
to the chemoattractant CXCL1 in the presence or absence of
metoprolol for 1.5 h, and migration through the transwell
membrane
was
quantified
by
flow
cytometry.
Metoprolol
inhibited
baseline
and
epinephrine-stimulated
neutrophil
migration towards CXCL1, reducing migration to the same
level in both cases (Fig. 4a). Second, ROS production in vitro was
measured using DHR 123 and W-peptide activation. ROS
production was tested in metoprolol-treated and untreated
neutrophils
with
and
without
W-peptide
stimulation.
Metoprolol-treated neutrophils presented significant decreased
oxidative
burst

to
the
non-treated
cells
after
stimulation (Fig. 4b,c). Metoprolol alone had no effect on ROS
endogenous production.

metoprolol. Adrb1 mRNA expression in fresh and viable isolated
neutrophils was confirmed by PCR in wild-type mice and

 migration- and -W-peptide-mediated ROS production-inhibitory
effect of metoprolol was lost in Adrb1KO neutrophils (Fig. 4a–c).
b2-adrenergic receptor-knockout mice (Adrb2KO) was not
involved in the effects observed after metoprolol administration
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
We next explored whether metoprolol directly inhibits the
capacity of neutrophils to infiltrate tissues in vivo. For this, we
first used a model of thioglycolate-induced peritonitis (Fig. 4d).
Thioglycolate induces massive leucocyte migration into the
peritoneal cavity within the first 16 h (Supplementary Fig. 6a),
with the majority of infiltrating cells being neutrophils (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6b–d). Metoprolol i.v. administration sharply
inhibited thioglycolate-induced neutrophil infiltration into the
peritoneal cavity of wild-type mice (Fig. 4e,f), but the inhibitory
effect of metoprolol was lost in Adrb1KO mice (Fig. 4f and
Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).
To better define the cell compartment targeted by metoprolol,
we lethally irradiated Adrb1KO mice and restored haematopoiesis
with bone marrow (BM) transplanted from wild-type donors,
generating chimeric mice expressing ADRB1 only in circulating
cells. At 4 weeks after irradiation, transplanted animals presented
485% BM engraftment (Supplementary Fig. 7) and were
subjected to thioglycolate-induced peritonitis. The replenishment
of ADRB1 only in haematopoietic cells was enough to rescue the
anti-leucocyte-infiltration effect of metoprolol (Fig. 4g). Together,
these data show a direct effect of metoprolol on neutrophil
function and demonstrate that the presence of ADRB1 in
circulating cells is essential for the ability of metoprolol to reduce
neutrophil infiltration into injured tissue.
IR reduction by metoprolol involves haematopoietic cells’
ADRB1. We next investigated the involvement of ADRB1
blockade in haematopoietic circulating cells in the protective
effect of metoprolol in the infarcted myocardium. Adrb1KO mice
were subjected to myocardial IR and randomized to receive i.v.
metoprolol or vehicle during ongoing AMI (Fig. 4h). Unlike the
situation in wild-type mice, metoprolol did not limit infarct size
in Adrb1KO animals (Fig. 4i–k), demonstrating the critical role of
ADRB1 blockade in the cardioprotective effect. To demonstrate
the role of ADRB1 expression in haematopoietic circulating cells,
we repeated the myocardial IR protocol in the chimeras described
above (Adrb1KO mice transplanted with wild-type BM). The
presence of ADRB1 only in haematopoietic circulating cells was
sufficient to restore susceptibility to the cardioprotective effect of
metoprolol (Fig. 4l–n). Conversely, transplant of Adrb1KO
BM into irradiated wild-type mice abrogated the protective
phenotype associated with metoprolol administration during
IR (Fig. 4o–q). These data confirm the involvement of ADRB1
blockade in haematopoietic cells in the cardioprotection afforded
by metoprolol administration during AMI.
Metoprolol alters neutrophil dynamics in vivo. During acute
injury, neutrophils alter their morphology upon adhering to
the activated endothelium. These shape change or polarization,
permit intercellular interactions critical for the inflammatory
response
in
several
conditions,
including
myocardial
IR
(refs 8,33). Polarization of adhered neutrophils involves receptor
redistribution and the assembly of a rearward protruding
microdomain called the uropod, and is essential for the
integration
of
signals coming
from the endothelium
and
activated
platelets
before
infiltration8.
We
were
therefore
interested
in
investigating
whether
metoprolol
impaired
neutrophil migration and infiltration through an effect on
neutrophil dynamics. For this, we used bi-dimensional and
3D intravital microscopy (IVM) to image cremaster muscle
vessels of mice treated with tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa), an
inflammatory model in which the vast majority of recruited
leukocytes are neutrophils. Neutrophil behaviour was evaluated
3 h after administration of metoprolol or vehicle (Fig. 5a).
Notably, metoprolol reduced neutrophil migratory velocity,
accumulated
crawling
distance
and
directional
movement
(Fig. 5b,c and online Supplementary Movie 3). Independent-
neutrophil 3D-reconstructions of live inflamed vessels showed
that metoprolol consistently disabled the intravascular behaviour
of neutrophils without disrupting polarization within activated
vessels, resulting in dramatic changes in cell morphology
(Fig.
5d–f)
that
correlated
with
their
abnormal
crawling
dynamics. These data show that metoprolol ‘stuns’ neutrophils,
resulting in altered dynamics and prevents the morphological
changes
needed
to
initiate
intercellular
interactions
and
subsequent tissue infiltration.
Metoprolol
blocks
PSGL1-dependent
neutrophil
platelet
interactions. Correct neutrophil polarization and organization of
an extruding microdomain that captures circulating platelets is
required to initiate tissue-damaging inflammation8. Indeed, plugs
of neutrophil–platelet co-aggregates in the microcirculation are a
major contributor to MVO in AMI and in other models
of injury1,8. We therefore explored the impact of metoprolol-
induced neutrophil stunning on neutrophil–platelet interactions.

 Using
the
cremaster
IVM
model
of
TNFa-induced
local
inflammation,
we
evaluated
the
acute
neutrophil–platelet
inhibitory effect of metoprolol in polarized neutrophils (Fig. 5).
Metoprolol i.v. administration effectively inhibited interactions
with the uropod, but not the leading edge (Fig. 5g,h) and
rapidly reduced total neutrophil–platelet interactions (Fig. 5i–k).
IVM experiments in Adrb1KO mice revealed no differences
between metoprolol-treated and vehicle-treated mice, implicating
ADRB1 in the inhibitory effect of metoprolol on neutrophil–
platelet interactions (Fig. 5j).
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that inhibition of
neutrophil–platelet interactions underlies the inhibitory effect of
metoprolol on MVO after myocardial IR. To test this, we
first evaluated the effect of metoprolol on neutrophil–platelet

 co-aggregate
formation
in
mouse
myocardial
vessels
after
experimental IR. Administration of metoprolol to wild-type mice
during ongoing AMI significantly reduced the number of
neutrophils attached to the vessel wall (Fig. 6a,b) and the average
number of interacting platelets per neutrophil (Fig. 6c).
Neutrophil–platelet
interactions
during
acute
injury
are
mediated by PSGL1 and signals delivered upon these contacts
promote subsequent neutrophil extravasation and injury to the
tissue8. Blockade of PSGL1 by pretreatment with PSGL1-mAB
(Fig. 6e) significantly reduced infarct size in the myocardial
IR model, and administration of metoprolol during ongoing
AMI did not yield any further infarct-size reductions (Fig. 6f,g).
These data confirm that metoprolol protects the infarcted
myocardium
by
uncoupling
neutrophil
recruitment
and
polarization, thereby disrupting neutrophil–platelet interactions
and the downstream inflammatory response.
Metoprolol limits neutrophil–platelet aggregates in patients.
To investigate whether metoprolol alters neutrophil dynamics
and inhibits neutrophil–platelet interactions in humans, whole
blood drawn from healthy donors was incubated ex vivo with
epinephrine (5 mM) and increasing concentrations of metoprolol
(0, 2, 5 mM). Samples were then stained, and neutrophil–platelet
co-aggregate formation was evaluated by flow cytometry34–37
(morphological
parameters,
CD14neg,
CD45 þ ,
CD61 þ ).
Metoprolol
significantly
inhibited
epinephrine-stimulated
neutrophil–platelet co-aggregate formation (Fig. 7a). The effect
of metoprolol in vivo was additionally studied in patients
undergoing elective coronary angioplasty for acute coronary
syndrome (ACS). Samples were collected before and after i.v.
administration of metoprolol (15 mg) and circulating neutrophil–
platelet
co-aggregates
were
assessed
by
flow
cytometry.
Metoprolol administration significantly reduced the number of
neutrophil–platelet interactions (Fig. 7b). To elucidate whether
metoprolol was acting at the platelet level of action we evaluated
effect of metoprolol on platelet function through platelet
aggregation using light transmittance aggregometry in platelet-
rich plasma (PRP) (Supplementary Fig. 8a) or platelet activation
surface
markers
expression
assay
using
flow
cytometry
(Supplementary Fig. 8b,c). Metoprolol did not show any
effect
on
platelet
aggregation/activation,
which
together
with the aforementioned effects on neutrophil migration and
ROS-production suggests that the effect seen on neutrophil–
platelet co-aggregates was driven by a direct effect on neutrophils.
Discussion
Early metoprolol administration during AMI, given as an adjunct
to mechanical reperfusion has been shown to reduce infarct size
and ameliorate post-infarction severe cardiac dysfunction11,38.
Defining the mechanisms underlying this cardioprotection is
therefore of great medical relevance since more efficient and
specific protective strategies could be identified.
The ability of ADRB1 selective blockers to reduce infarct
size was tested decades ago in several clinical trials, but the
results were inconclusive1. However, most of these early studies
were performed in the context of non-reperfused AMI. The
advent of reperfusion as the treatment of choice for AMI changed
the mode of myocardial death: from unrelieved ischaemia to a
combination of ischaemia and reperfusion processes. Therefore
the potential cardioprotective effects of ADRB1 selective blockers
needed to be revisited in light of the current evidence of IR injury
during AMI (ref. 1). The ability of metoprolol to reduce
infarct size in the context of reperfused AMI was recently
evaluated in the METOCARD-CNIC trial. In this trial, early
i.v. metoprolol administration during ongoing AMI resulted
in a significant reduction of infarct size9,39, and also significantly
reduced the incidence of severe ventricular dysfunction and heart
failure readmissions10. Large animal studies conducted before the
METOCARD-CNIC trial showed that metoprolol reduces infarct
size only when administered before reperfusion40,41, suggesting
that
metoprolol
might
reduce
infarct
size
by
inhibiting
reperfusion injury. The early studies, testing the infarct-limiting
properties
of
metoprolol
in
non-reperfused
AMI,
were
undertaken under the hypothesis that ADRB1-blockers would
reduce the extent of damage by a direct effect on cardiomyocytes
via reducing oxygen consumption. Although our large animal
study40 did not investigate the mechanism of metoprolol-
mediated protection, it did show that oxygen consumption was
similar in metoprolol- and vehicle-treated pigs. In addition, the
infarct-size reduction in metoprolol-treated pigs was associated
with reduced myeloperoxidase activity in the post-ischaemic
myocardium 24 h after reperfusion41. These findings challenged
the idea that metoprolol could reduce cardiac damages simply by
reducing myocardial oxygen consumption directly in the heart
and
prompted
us
to
investigate
the
cellular
mechanisms
underlying
the
reperfusion-related
injury-limiting
effect
of
metoprolol during IR.
There is ample evidence supporting the critical implication of
neutrophils in IR injury4,25,27,29,42,43. Neutrophils have two
deleterious
effects
in
this
context.
First,
neutrophils
and
neutrophil–platelet
plugs
occlude
microvessels,
preventing
efficient tissue perfusion: MVO. Second, neutrophils adhering
to
the
newly
reperfused
injured
vessels
infiltrate
the
myocardium1,
prompting
deleterious
processes
associated
with reperfusion25,33. Our study confirms these associations in
AMI patients: neutrophil count positively correlated with the
extent of MVO as evaluated by state-of-the-art MRI 1 week after
reperfusion. There exist weak pre-existing evidence linking
the action of metoprolol to neutrophils, including reductions in

 post-IR myeloperoxidase activity in pig myocardium41 and rat
spinal cord44, and inhibition of sepsis-induced inflammation in
mice45. The data here presented from patients randomized in
a controlled clinical trial are the first human evidence linking
metoprolol with altered neutrophil behaviour in vivo. We show
that the strong positive correlation between neutrophil count and
MVO was abolished in patients receiving i.v. metoprolol before
reperfusion. The fact that metoprolol-treated patients’ high
neutrophil count was not associated with the extent of MVO
suggests an altered neutrophil dynamics during acute injury.
Some preclinical studies have suggested an association between
metoprolol exposure and altered neutrophil dynamics41,44,45;

 however, the cellular mechanism responsible for this effect has
remained unknown. Our results from the in vitro transwell
migration assays confirm previous studies showing the ability of
metoprolol to inhibit migration of isolated neutrophils46. Also,
our in vitro data confirm previous studies showing that
metoprolol
was
able
to
inhibit
ROS
production
from
neutrophils47. Our in vitro results showing migration inhibition
by metoprolol are reinforced by the acute in vivo murine
peritonitis model, in which a single metoprolol i.v. injection
abrogates neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneal cavity.
Furthermore, the studies with Adrb1KO mice provide evidence
for a critical involvement of the ADRB1 axis in the effects of
metoprolol. In the transwell assays, metoprolol had no effect on
the migration of Adrb1KO neutrophils, and in the peritonitis
assay,
the
inhibitory
effect
of
metoprolol
on
neutrophil
infiltration was lost in Adrb1KO mice. The rescue of this
inhibitory effect in chimeric animals in which Adrb1 is expressed
only in circulating cells demonstrates that the cellular target of
metoprolol action is of haematopoietic origin, and rules out an
involvement of other compartments. Moreover, the findings in
the peritonitis model were confirmed in the myocardial IR model,
with metoprolol significantly reducing neutrophil infiltration into
the injured myocardium of wild-type but not Adrb1KO mice, and
rescue of the protective effect in the Adrb1KO after wild-type BM
transplant. Finally, we ruled out any involvement of ADRB2 on
the effect exerted by metoprolol. Altogether, these results
demonstrate the essential role of neutrophil ADRB1 blockade in
the protective effect of metoprolol against myocardial IR injury.
Our data are in discrepancy with a prior study suggesting
that metoprolol abrogated neutrophil migration in vitro in an
apparently
ADRB1-independent
manner46.
In
that
study
authors reported that metoprolol was able to inhibit neutrophil
migration even in the presence of the b-adrenergic receptor
agonist orciprenaline, while in our study we have used a genetic
ablation toll (that is, Adrb1KO mice), which ensures the
absence of ADRB1.
Upon acute injury, neutrophils recruited to injured vessels
initiate inflammation by scanning for activated platelets present
in the circulation, establishing interactions with them through
PSGL1 exposed on neutrophil protrusions8. The IVM confocal
imaging analysis demonstrated that metoprolol prevents the
exposure of functional PSGL1 clusters, which are essential for

 interaction with platelets. These events correlated with alterations
in neutrophil properties essential for infiltration, including
migratory
velocity
and
directionality.
In
agreement
with
these data, in the mouse myocardial IR model, metoprolol
altered neutrophil 3D structure and reduced the numbers of
neutrophil–platelet
co-aggregates
that
occluded
myocardial
vessels. The inability of metoprolol to provide additional
protection after blockade of neutrophil–platelet interactions
with
the
anti-PSGL1
mAB
is
compelling
evidence
for
interference in this interaction as the mechanism underlying
the infarct-limiting action of metoprolol during myocardial IR in
mice. The demonstration that metoprolol inhibits neutrophil–
platelet interactions in healthy volunteers and ACS patients
suggests that this mechanism also operates in humans. There is
controversy on the direct effect of metoprolol on platelet
aggregation.
Some
studies
suggested
that
metoprolol
was
able
to
inhibit
ADP-
and
epinephrine-mediated
platelet
aggregation48, but recent studies did not show any anti-platelet
effect of metoprolol49. In line with the latter evidence, in our
study we found that metoprolol had no effect on platelet
aggregation or in platelet activation in healthy volunteers. These
data strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of metoprolol on
neutrophil–platelet co-aggregates was driven by a direct effect on
neutrophils. In our flow cytometry studies we defined a positive
neutrophil–platelet interaction as CD14neg, CD45 þ , CD61 þ
particles. It should be noted that there are more specific
neutrophil markers and thus our selection is a limitation of
these experiments. However, given that all data (human and
mouse) point to the same direction, we think this limitation did
not have an impact on the conclusions obtained in these
experiments.
The role of neutrophils in experimental IR injury is well
established; however, the negative results of clinical trials with
anti-inflammatory therapies (for example, C5a (refs 50,51),
CD-18 (ref. 52)) dampened hopes for this pharmacological
strategy3,
and
suggested
that
parallel
mechanisms
driving
myocardial injury were at play. The demonstration that neutro-
phil dynamics in general and neutrophil–platelet interactions in
particular are the target for the protective actions of metoprolol
administered to patients during AMI reinstates neutrophils as
a potential target for the therapeutic reduction of infarct size.
Methods
Human cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The METOCARD-CNIC trial
(NCT01311700) recruited patients suffering an AMI during hospital transit to
undergo mechanical reperfusion by primary angioplasty. Patients were randomized
to receive i.v. metoprolol (up to 15 mg) or no drug (control). Patients underwent
two CMR studies: 1 week and 6 months after AMI. Images were acquired with
a 3.0 Tesla magnet (Achieva Tx, Philips Medical Systems) with vectorcardiographic
gating and a dedicated cardiac 32-channel phased-array surface coil. The extent of
MVO was measured in the 1-week CMR study; to detect and quantify MVO,
a delayed enhancement imaging was performed 10 min after gadolinium
contrast injection, using a T1-weighted 2-D Inversion Recovery Turbo Field Echo
(2D IR-TFE) sequence. Myocardial necrosis was defined by the extent of abnormal
gadolinium enhancement, whereas MVO was defined as black-hypoenhanced areas
within the bright-hyperenhanced regions. CMR analysis was undertaken by
operators blinded to treatment allocation at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones
Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC). Myocardial necrosis and MVO were quanti-
fied by semiautomatic delineation with dedicated software (QMass MR 7.6; Medis,
Leiden, the Netherlands). Total MVO was quantified as grams of LV. To correct for
infarct size, MVO was also expressed as a percentage of the infarcted area.
Mouse procedures. Experimental procedures were approved by the CNIC Animal
Care and Ethics Committee and regional authorities. IR, thioglycolate-induced
peritonitis and IVM experiments were performed in 8–13-week-old wild-type
male C57BL/6 mice. b1-adrenergic receptor (Adrb1) knockout (KO; Adrb1KO)
mice were in a mixed background. b2-adrenergic receptor (Adrb2) knockout
(KO; Adrb2KO) mice were in a C5BL/6 background. For the BM transplant
experiments, Adrb1KO mice were backcrossed with mice expressing DsRed under
the control of the b-actin promoter to facilitate evaluation of BM engraftment.
Male and female mice were used as donors in BM transplant procedures, but
only males were used in myocardial IR and thioglycolate-induced peritonitis
experiments. All animals were randomized to receive a single i.v. injection (50 ml)
of metoprolol-tartrate (10 mM) or vehicle (saline). Histological evaluation of
injured myocardium in the myocardial IR model was performed in lysozyme
M-GFP þ (LysM-GFP)53 male mice. Intravascular neutrophil and neutrophil–
platelet interactions were scored manually in the myocardium. Neutrophils were
depleted in C57BL/6 male by i.v. injections of 50 mg anti-mouse Ly6G 24 and 48 h
before the myocardial IR procedure28. For in vivo blocking of P-selectin
glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL1), 50 mg of anti-PSGL1 antibody (clone 4RA10) was
i.v. injected 15 min after ischaemia onset. Mice were maintained under pathogen-
free conditions in a temperature-controlled room and a 12-h light–dark cycle at the
CNIC animal facilities. Chow and water were available ad libitum.
Reagents. Metoprolol-tartrate (M5391), Evans blue, triphenyltetrazolium

Mouse model of myocardial IR injury. Male 8–12-week-old mice were subjected
to 45 min occlusion of the LAD coronary artery followed by 6 or 24 h of
reperfusion. For infarct size evaluation, reperfusion was maintained for 24 h.
For analysis of MVO, neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil–platelet interactions,
reperfusion was maintained for 6 or 24 h as indicated. The IR procedure was
performed as previously described54. Briefly, fully asleep animals were intubated
and temperature controlled throughout the experiment at 36.5 �C to prevent
hypothermic cardioprotection. Thoracotomy was then performed and the LAD was
ligated with a nylon 8/0 monofilament suture for 45 min. The electrocardiogram
was monitored (MP36R, Biopac Systems Inc.) to confirm total coronary artery
occlusion (ST-segment elevation) throughout the 45 min ischaemia. Ten minutes
before reperfusion onset, mice were randomized to receive a single i.v. injection
(50 ml) of metoprolol-tartrate (10 mM) or vehicle (saline) through the femoral vein.
Dose of metoprolol was chosen after a dose response study (Supplementary Fig. 9).
At the end of reperfusion, the chest was closed and animals were kept with
100% O2 and analgesized with buprenorphine (S.C., 0.1 mg per kg) until the
end of reperfusion.

 Mouse infarct size quantification. At the end of follow up, mice were re-anes-
thetized and re-intubated, and the LAD coronary artery was re-occluded by ligating
the suture in the same position as the original infarction54. Animals were then
killed and rapidly 1 ml of 1% (w per v) Evans Blue dye was infused i.v. to delineate
AAR: myocardium lacking blood flow, that is, negative for blue dye staining.
The heart was then harvested, LV was isolated, cut into transverse slices (5–7 1-mm
thick slices per LV) and both sides were imaged. Sections post-Evans blue staining
present two different areas: one palish negative for Evans blue perfusion,
delineating AAR, and another blueish (positive Evans blue) area indicating remote
tissue. In order to differentiate infarcted from viable tissue, same slices were
incubated in triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, 1% (w per v) diluted in PBS) at
37 �C for 15 min in constant shacking. The slices were then re-photographed and
weighed. Post TTC incubation, Evans blue staining clears out and slices present
two areas: one necrotic (palish negative to TTC staining) and one reddish alive
(positive to TTC staining). Regions negative for Evans Blue staining (AAR) and
for TTC (infarcted myocardium) were quantified using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA) by blinded observer. Percentage values for AAR and infarcted
myocardium were corrected to mg independently for each slice. Absolute AAR and
infarct size were determined as the mg:mg ratio of AAR:LV and infarcted
myocardium:AAR, respectively. Animals exceeding 80% of IS were excluded
assuming absence of reperfusion.
Hearts processing for histology. At the end of reperfusion, LysM-GFP mice were
re-anesthetized, placed in a supine position, their ventral thoracic regions wiped
with 70% alcohol and killed by cervical dislocation. Next, 10 ml of PBS with
heparin (50 U per ml) was gently infused through the vena cava to avoid blood
clots. Hearts were then removed and cut into 1 mm-thick transverse sections and
fixed with 2% PFA in PBS for 24 h at 4 �C.
Heart slices (1 mm) designated to histopathological analysis of capillary
obliteration were dehydrated through an ethanol series, cleared in xylene,
embedded in paraffin wax and consequently sectioned (4 mm) for staining with
haematoxylin and eosin. All immunohistochemical procedures were performed
with an automated autostainer (Autostainer Plus, Dako) at the CNIC Histology
Unit. Images were digitally scanned (Nanozoomer-RS C110730, Hamamatsu) and
examined with image analysis software (Tissuemorph, Visiopharm) by blinded
observers. Once the lesion was identified, 10–12 images ( � 20) were taken at
random, and capillary obliteration was scored from 0 to 2, with 0 indicating the
absence of capillary obliteration and 2 indicating presence of obstruction in all
capillaries.
Confocal microscopy. Sections designated for immunofluorescence staining and
confocal microscopy were post-fixed overnight and placed in 30% sucrose for 24 h
and included in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek). Serial 4 mm coronal sections were cut on
a freezing microtome (Leica CM1950) and stored in cryoprotective solution.
Sections designated for evaluation of neutrophil infiltration of the injured area
were washed in PBS for 15 min and incubated with DAPI (1:1,000) at room
temperature for 5 min, washed in PBS twice and mounted in Mowiol mounting
medium. Images of full short-axis heart sections were acquired with an inverted
confocal laser imaging system (Zeiss LSM7004 4-Laser) and reconstructed with
Zeiss ZEN reprocessing software. Presence of Lysm-GFP þ cells analysis was
performed with ImageJ (NIH) by blinded observers. Values of total GFP þ surface
were normalized to LV section surface. A second set of sections were stained
with Dylight-650-conjugated anti-1A8 Ly6G and DAPI for quantification of
specific neutrophil identification and temporal infiltration analysis. Eight
independent 40 � were evaluated from injured myocardium from each animal,
and presence of myeloid derived cells (LysM þ ), neutrophils (LysM þ Ly6G þ )
and monocytes (LysM þ Ly6Gneg) were identified and analysed using ImageJ
by blinded observers. Four animals were stained for basal quantification. Some
sections were stained with anti-laminin to stain cell membranes (1:150) and
anti-a-actinin to visualize sarcomeres in cardiac fibres (1:200) for detailed
illustration of neutrophil infiltration in the injured myocardium. Images were
post-processed and edited using the Imaris software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland) as
indicated below.
Neutrophil–platelet interactions staining in infarcted mouse heart was adapted
from Sreeramkumar et al.8. Briefly, OCT-embedded heart slices were cut into
50 mm sections, washed in PBS for 15 min and incubated for 20 min at room
temperature in blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% BSA and 2% goat serum).
For detailed visualization and characterization of the injured zone, cell
membranes were stained with anti-laminin (1:150) and platelets were stained
with PE-conjugated anti-CD41 (1:200). Primary and secondary antibodies were
diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer, and incubations were conducted for 1 h at room
temperature. Nonspecific staining was assessed by omission of primary antibody.
Samples were counterstained with DAPI and mounted in Mowiol. Images were
acquired with a laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Leica SP8 or SP5) at the
CNIC Microscopy Unit and post-processed with Leica Las AF and Imaris software
(Bitplane AG, Switzerland). Independent vessels (7–9) were evaluated for each
animal, and intravascular neutrophil and neutrophil–platelet interactions were
scored manually.
Neutrophil purification and Adrb1 expression. Adrb1 expression in circulating
neutrophils was examined in blood drawn from wild-type or Adrb1KO mice
20 min after injection of heparin (50 ml of 50 U per ml). Whole blood was
filtered and pooled, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were purified by
gradient-centrifugation (800g, 20 min, 4 �C) in 65% Percoll Plus in Hanks balanced
salt solution (HBSS). Cells were washed in PBS and residual erythrocytes were
lysed using hypotonic buffer. Neutrophils were washed and resuspended in HBSS.
Before RNA isolation, neutrophil identity was confirmed by flow cytometry
(anti-1A8 Ly6G) and viability evaluated.
Total RNA from whole hearts, BM and purified neutrophils samples was
isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. RNA (1–2 mg) was reverse
transcribed using Ready-to-go RT–PCR Beads (27-9259-01, GE Healthcare).
PCR was performed with 40 cycles of 95 �C for 12 s and 60 �C for 1 min. All PCR
reactions were done in triplicate. Primers for Hprt and Adrb1 were as follows:
mHprt_fw-50-GAGGAGTCCTGTTGATGTTGCCAG-30, mHprt_rv-50-GGCTGG
CCTATAGGCTCATAGTGC-30; mAdrb1_fw-50-GTGGGTAACGTGCTG
GTGAT-30, mAdrb1_rv-50-GAAGTCCAGAGCTCGCAGAA-30. Amplicons
generated in the qPCR were loaded on to an agarose gel to confirm single
PCR products.
Migration transwell assay. The ability of leukocytes to migrate towards
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) was assessed using a modification of
the method of Villablanca et al.55. Briefly, wild-type or Adrb1KO mice were
heparinized (50 ml of 50 U per ml, IP) and 20 min later blood was collected and
filtered, and residual erythrocytes were lysed with hypotonic buffer. PBS-washed
leukocytes of the same genotype were pooled and resuspended in RPMI containing
10% FBS and the appropriate treatment: saline (vehicle control), 10 mM
epinephrine (positive control), 10 mM metoprolol-tartrate, or a combination
of epinephrine and metoprolol. Transwell inserts (6.5 mm, 5.0 mm pore size
(3421; Corning Costar Corporation)) were pretreated with 50 ml RPMI for 20 min
and placed in 24-well-plates before seeding cells (100 ml; B1 � 105; 490%
viability). Lower compartments (wells) were filled with 600 ml DMEM medium
containing 0.04 ng per ml CXCL1 to induce directional movement. Spontaneous
migration was assessed in wells lacking CXCL1. After incubation at 37 �C for 1.5 h,
cells in the lower compartment were collected and neutrophils (Ly6G þ cells) were
evaluated by flow cytometry. Each independent experiment was conducted with
leukocytes pooled from nine animals, and each of the five conditions was run with
four replicates. Mean spontaneous migration was subtracted from the migration
value of each well, and neutrophil migration was expressed as a percentage of
the total number of neutrophils seeded in the upper chamber at the start of the
experiment. For comparison between experiments and genotypes, migration was
normalized to the mean control (vehicle) value.
Neutrophil oxidative burst assay. Blood from wild-type or Adrb1KO mice was
collected in heparinized tubes and distributed in 100 ml aliquots, erythrocytes were
lysed with hypotonic buffer. After centrifugation leucocytes were first washed and
then re-suspended in high glucose phenol red free DMEM. Cells were then
incubated for 50 min with or without metoprolol-tartrate 100 mM at 37 �C.
As previously described30,31, dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123, 1 mM), which
converts to the fluorescent product rhodamine 123 (Rho 123) upon oxidation
was then added to the medium and cells were stimulated with the chemotactic FPR
activator-peptide, w-peptide 1 mM (WKYMVM, 1799 Tocris). After 20 min
incubation at 37 �C the reaction was stopped in ice and cells were washed in cold
HBSS containing DAPI 0.1 mg per ml (D8417, Sigma). Mean fluorescent intensity
for Rho 123 was evaluated for neutrophils (Ly6G þ cells) alive (DAPIneg) by flow
cytometry.
Model of thioglycolate-induced peritonitis. To assess the ability of metoprolol to
inhibit neutrophil recruitment, we used a well-established thioglycolate-induced
peritonitis model (see Fig. 3). Wild-type mice were intraperitoneally injected with
1 ml of thioglycolate and immediately randomized to receive a single 50 ml i.v.
injection of vehicle or metoprolol-tartrate (10 mM). Sixteen hours later, 100 ml of
blood from each animal was collected into EDTA tubes for later haematological
analysis in a haematocytometer (Pentra 80). Next, animals were killed, 2 ml PBS
was injected intraperitoneally and distributed manually for 30 s to detach infiltrated
circulatory cells. Next, another 8 ml PBS was injected to facilitate collection of
6 ml peritoneal exudate. Exudates were gently centrifuged, and cells were washed
twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-GR1 (1:200) and PE-conjugated
anti-CD115 (1:200). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min
with anti-rat 647 to detect GR1. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. All samples
were analysed by flow cytometry for exactly 30 s of constant flow. Neutrophil
recruitment efficiencies are presented as neutrophils per ml of exudate for each
independent animal.
To evaluate the role of ADRB1 in different compartments, we performed the
same experiments in Adrb1KO mice and generated cohorts of chimeric mice by
transplantation with BM cells from wild-type and Adrb1KO donors. Four weeks
after BM transplantation, chimerism was evaluated by flow cytometry as the
percentage of donated cells. Animals with chimerism below 85% were discarded;
those with chimerism above 85% underwent the thioglycolate-induced peritonitis

 protocol followed by randomization to receive either i.v. vehicle or metoprolol
(10 mM). To compare between the different chimeric groups, the mean value for
each metoprolol-treated group was normalized to the mean for the vehicle-treated
group.
Bone marrow transplant. BM transplants protocols were adapted from
Casanova et al.28. Recipient mice from Adrb1KO or wild-type genotypes
(DsRed þ or DsRed- as appropriate) were lethally irradiated (13 Gy in two doses)
before reconstitution with donor BM. Donor BM was collected from mice of the
appropriate genotype by flushing both tibiae and femurs into PBS containing 2 mM
EDTA (PEB buffer). Contaminating erythrocytes were lysed with hypotonic buffer.
Engraftment in recipient animals was assessed by flow cytometry 3–4 weeks after
transplantation. Animals bled for engraftment evaluations were rested for 1 week
before any other procedure.
Flow cytometry. Neutrophil purity for in vitro migration assay and Adrb1
expression analysis was evaluated by incubating cells with Dylight-650-conjugated
anti-1A8 Ly6G and with DAPI to assess viability. Mouse primary blood leukocytes
from peritonitis experiments were incubated with anti-Gr1 conjugated with
AF-647 and with PE-conjugated anti-CD115 and DAPI. Neutrophils were gated on
the basis of Gr1-positive and CD115-negative staining in a FACS Canto-3L flow
cytometre equipped with DIVA software (BD Biosciences). Doublet discrimination
and viability (negative to DAPI) was assessed for every sample. Data were analysed
with FlowJo (Ashland) software by blinded observer. All experiments were
conducted at the CNIC-Cellomics Unit.
Intravital microscopy. IVM of the cremaster muscle was performed after
intrascrotal injection of TNFa (0.5 mg R&D Systems)8, followed immediately by
injection of a single i.v. bolus of metoprolol (10 mM) or vehicle, and neutrophil
behaviour was evaluated 3 h after stimulus. In some experiments metoprolol was
injected 3 h after treatment with TNF-a and images immediately acquired for
analysis (see Fig. 4). The IVM system was built by 3i (Intelligent Imaging
Innovations, Denver, CO, USA) on an Axio Examiner Z.1 workstation
(Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) mounted on a 3-Dimensional Motorized Stage
(Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA). This set up allows precise computer-
controlled lateral movement between XY positions and a Z focusing drive for
confocal acquisition. The microscope is equipped with a CoolLED pE widefield
fluorescence LED light source system (CoolLED Ltd. UK) and a quad pass filter
cube with a Semrock Di01-R405/488/561/635 dichroic and a FF01-446/523/600/
677 emitter. We used a plan-Apochromat � 40 W NA1.0 N/0 objective (Zeiss).
Images were collected with a CoolSnap HQ2 camera (6.45 � 6.45-mm pixels,
1,392 � 1,040 pixel format; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA). For confocal
high-speed IVM, we used laser stacks for 488, 561 and 640 nm beams coupled with
a confocal scanner (Yokogawa CSUX-A1; Yokogawa, Japan); images were acquired
at 0.5 mm Z-intervals. Image acquisition was coordinated and offline data
analysis facilitated with SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations),
run on a Dell Precision T7500 computer (Dell Inc., Round Rock, TX, USA). For
three-dimensional analysis we used the 3D surface view function to determine the
position of the CD62L þ clusters relative to the cell body and the lumen. Six to ten
venules per mouse were analysed 210 to 300 min after TNF-a treatment by
acquisition of fluorescence (Cy3/561 channels for phycoerythirn, FITC/488
channels for FITC and Cy5/640 channels for allophycocianin) and bright-field
images with 2 � 2 for 2 min. For double staining with PE- and FITC-conjugated
antibodies, acquisition was facilitated in single (FITC) and quad (PE) filters in
order to avoid bleed-through of fluorescent signals between channels. For in vivo
labelling of neutrophils and platelets surface molecules, fluorescently labelled
antibodies were injected intravenously (anti-CD62L-FITC, anti-Ly6G-APC and
anti-CD41-PE; 0.5–1.25 mg per mouse). Images were post-processed and edited
using the Imaris software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland) as indicated below.
Analysis of blood cell interactions. Platelets in the inflamed cremaster muscle
were visualized as CD41-labelled cells and quantified as reported8. Briefly, we
defined the uropod of adherent neutrophils as the domain staining positive for
CD62L, and the leading edge as the CD62L-negative pole forming multiple
protrusions and showing guided movement. Six to ten venules per mouse were
recorded, and platelet interactions with neutrophils were counted and analysed
manually at the two distinct domains of the polarized neutrophil with the help of
Slidebook software.
Analysis of tracking of crawling neutrophils. Time-lapse movies of crawling
neutrophils were analysed with ImageJ, which includes the Manual Tracking and
the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool plugins. For each movie we first adjusted
channel intensities and converted them into RGB format. Movies were rotated so
that the vessels and the blood flow were positioned horizontally and oriented
left-right. When necessary, the Background subtraction and Image stabilization
pre-stablished plugins were applied to eliminate noise and reduce tissue twitching,
respectively. Both plugins were set up with xy calibration values, which depend on
the camera and microscope parameters, to convert pixels into linear measures, as
well as the time interval value between movie frames (3 s). Each polarized
neutrophil (identified by a clear polarized morphology or uropod staining) was
tracked manually for 1 min using the Manual Tracking Plugin, which generated a
data set with the respective xy track coordinates. We then used the Chemotaxis and
Migration Tool to plot and the velocity (mm per s), accumulated distance (mm),
euclidean distance (mm) and directionality of the tracks obtained. The Euclidean
distance is the length of the straight-line segment connecting the initial and
finishing points, whereas the accumulated distance is the total length of the path
covered by the cell. Directionality measures how straight the cell track is, and is
calculated as the ratio of euclidean distance to accumulated distance.
Analysis of 3D reconstructions of polarized neutrophils. We measured the 3D
features of intravascular neutrophils using Imaris Software (Bitplane, Oxford, UK).
From the parameters provided by the ImarisCell module, we selected prolate
ellipticity by obtaining the lengths of the three semi-axes, which correspond with
the Ellipsoid axis parameters. A prolate ellipsoid (cigar-like shape) is one for which
the polar radius is greater than the equatorial radius. For 3D cell reconstructions,
we used the ImarisCell module to define the cell body. We then segmented a region
of interest to enclose an individual cell within this region, so that the subsequent
reconstruction fitted the real cell structure. Afterwards, the respective source
channel from which the cells had to be computed was selected. For reconstruction
analysis, we chose the Ly6G-APC channel as it is a membrane-bound protein that
yields a strong signal and allows a good rendering of the actual cell morphology.
ImarisCell module determines the cell threshold by calculating voxel (3D pixel)
intensities from the enclosed cell and comparing them with the background
intensity in the enclosed sub-region. To obtain the height-to-length ratios, we
visually established the cell orientation with respect to the vessel wall surface.
Sections of each polarized neutrophil were analysed to manually measure the
height of the cell and maximum length (from the top view) with respect to the
vessel wall. For this purpose, we used Imaris Section View, which shows the
coordinates in the three display areas (xy top view, zy lateral view and xz front
view), and the Extended Crosshairs of the Section View, which in turn allows
selection of the z-stack planes to visualize the entire cell (not just one plane or
section) in the three views. A snapshot of these three views from a single cell
was taken and imported into ImageJ, where height and maximum length were
measured from the different views after setting the capture scale.
Human blood sampling. Functional tests were performed in blood samples from
20 volunteers (36±6 years, 15 men). Exclusion criteria were as follows: any
antiplatelet, anticoagulant or anti-inflammatory drug taken within the 2 previous
weeks; abnormal platelet or leukocyte count; or any history of abnormal bleeding,
thrombosis, or active inflammatory disease. Written consent was obtained from all
volunteers. Blood samples were collected into polypropylene tubes containing
sodium citrate from an antecubital vein with a 21-gauge needle, discarding the first
2 ml to avoid platelet activation. Blood was collected between 8:00 and 10:00 after
overnight fasting. Samples were processed immediately. ACS patients were
recruited at our cath-lab (both genders, age o80) from among those referred for
coronary angiogram and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention. Exclu-
sion criteria were as follows: active treatment with b-blockers; any situation which
might make it imprudent to administer an i.v.-b-blocker; asthma or chronic
obstructive lung disease; bradycardio (HR o55 b.p.m.); heart failure or valvular
heart disease; atrial fibrillation requiring antiarrhythmic therapy; renal failure with
creatinine Z2 mg per ml; liver disease with bilirubin Z2 mg per ml; acute illness of
any malignancy; pregnancy or nursing; body mass index Z27 kg per m2; previous
severe adverse reaction to b-blockers; concomitant use of other antithrombotic
drugs such as anticoagulants, dypiridamol, ticlopidine or cilostazol; treatment
before the intervention with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, or need for nonsteroid
anti-inflammatory drugs. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
enrolled. Blood samples were collected from a femoral artery catheter into
polypropylene tubes containing sodium citrate, discarding the first 2 ml. Samples
were processed immediately.
Human neutrophil–platelet interactions evaluation. Human citrated blood was
diluted 1:5 in HEPES-Tyrode’s* (5 mM hydroxyethylpiperazineethane-sulfonic
acid (HEPES), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM NaHCO3, 0.36 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM
NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, bovine albumin 0.2%. pH ¼ 7.4) and
incubated with 0, 2 or 5 mM metoprolol for 10 min. Then, 5 ml of diluted blood
was incubated with 5 mM epinephrine for 10 min. Unstimulated and epinephrine-
stimulated samples were stained with PC5-conjugated anti-CD14 anti CD45-FITC
and anti-CD61 PC7 for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Erythrocytes were
lysed for 10 min using Versalyse solution. Appropriate mouse isotype controls were
used for each antibody. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a Gallios
cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). Leukocytes were by CD45-FITC
staining. Neutrophils identification was adapted from refs 34,35 and performed by
morphological parameters (side scatter) and negative staining for CD14-PC5 but
positive staining for CD45-FITC. Neutrophil–platelet conjugates were identified as
bivariate histogram particles negative for CD14-PC5 and positive to CD61-PC7
(refs 36,37). The acquisition process was stopped after collection of 5,000
monocytes. Data are expressed as the percentage of neutrophil–platelet aggregates.

 All experiments were conducted at the Hospital Universitario Clı
´nico San Carlos,
Madrid.
Human platelet function evaluation. Platelet aggregation was assessed using light
transmittance aggregometry in PRP by the turbidimetric method in a four-channel
aggregometer (Chrono-Log 490 Model, Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA, USA)
according to standard protocols. The PRP was obtained from citrated blood at
centrifuge (800 r.p.m.) for 10 min and platelet-poor plasma was obtained after
a second centrifugation (2,500 r.p.m.) for 10 min. PRP will be adjusted to 250,000
per ml with autologous plasma. PRP was incubated with metoprolol 2 and 5 mM or
saline buffer for 15 min and then stimulated using epinephrine (5 mM). Light
transmission was adjusted to 0% with PRP and to 100% with platelet-poor plasma
for each measurement. Curves were recorded during 5 min and platelet aggregation
was determined as the maximal percent change in light transmittance.
Platelet function was determined by assessing platelet activation as surface
expression of activated GP IIb/IIIa (Becton Dickinson) and P-Selectin using
flow cytometry. Whole blood from healthy donors were drawn into trisodium
citrate tubes diluted with Hepes-tyrodes-buffer (0.2% BSA) to a final volume of
1:8:1 (blood: Hepes-tyrodes:citrate). Diluted blood was incubated with metoprolol
2 and 5 mM or saline for 15 min. Following activation with epinephrine (5 mM)
samples were incubated for 20 min with polyclonal PAC1-FITC conjugated or
PE-conjugated anti-CD62P. Appropriate isotype controls were used in each case.
Platelet activation was expressed as the percentage of platelets positive for antibody
binding. Platelets were gated on the basis of light scatter and CD61 antibody
expression. Activated platelets were defined as the percentage of expressing
the activated confirmation of PAC1 binding and P-selectin (CD62P). Data
were expressed as the percentage of platelets positive for antibody binding.
All experiments were conducted at the Hospital Universitario Clı
´nico San Carlos,
Madrid.
Statistics. Data are represented as mean±s.e. of the mean (s.e.m.), and analysed
using Prism software (Graph pad, Inc.) and Stata (Stata 12.0; StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA). Comparisons between two groups were performed
by using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test or the nonparametric
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test as appropriate. Comparisons between more than
two groups were performed by using the one-way ANOVA. The P-value was
adjusted with the Holm Sidak’s multiple comparison test. Multiple linear regression
analysis was used to study the influence of metoprolol on MVO, adjusted for
factors potentially affecting MVO such as sex, age, ischaemia duration, diabetes,
use of thrombectomy or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Test for linear trend after
one-way ANOVA was used to study the relationship between LVEF at 6 months
and MVO quartiles at 1 week. Power calculations were applied to obtain
statistically significant at P values below 0.05 significant. *Po0.05, **Po0.01,
