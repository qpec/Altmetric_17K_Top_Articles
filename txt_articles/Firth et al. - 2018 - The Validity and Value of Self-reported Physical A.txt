Background: Previous physical activity (PA) research 
in schizophrenia has relied largely upon self-report mea-
sures. However, the accuracy of this method is question-
able. Obtaining accurate measurements, and determining 
what may influence PA levels in schizophrenia, is essential 
to understand physical inactivity in this population. This 
study examined differences in self-reported and objectively 
measured PA in people with schizophrenia and the general 
population using a large, population-based dataset from 
the UK Biobank. Methods: Baseline data from the UK 
Biobank (2007–2010) were analyzed; including 1078 peo-
ple with schizophrenia (54.19 ± 8.39 years; 55% male) and 
450 549 without (56.44 ± 8.11; 46% male). We compared 
self-reported PA with objectively measured accelerometry 
data in schizophrenia and comparison samples. We also 
examined correlations between self-report and objective 
measures. Results: People with schizophrenia reported the 
same PA levels as those without, with no differences in low, 
moderate, or vigorous intensity activity. However, accel-
erometry data showed a large and statistically significant 
reduction of PA in schizophrenia; as people with schizo-
phrenia, on average, engaged in less PA than 80% of the 
general population. Nonetheless, within the schizophrenia 
sample, total self-reported PA still held significant corre-
lations with objective measures. Conclusions: People with 
schizophrenia are significantly less active than the general 
population. However, self-report measures in epidemio-
logical studies fail to capture the reduced activity levels in 
schizophrenia. This also has implications for self-report 
measures of other lifestyle factors which may contribute 
toward the poor health outcomes observed in schizophre-
nia. Nonetheless, self-report measures may still be useful 
for identifying how active individuals with schizophrenia 
relative to other patients.

Introduction
Lack of physical activity (PA) has been identified by 
the World Health Organization as one of the top-five 
causes of mortality worldwide.1 Physical inactivity is 
also strongly associated with the other main risk factors 
for premature mortality, including hypertension, hyper-
glycemia, and obesity,1 and increases the risk of cardio-
metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and heart disease.2 
Indeed, recent epidemiological evidence from European 
countries indicates that physical inactivity is responsible 
for twice as many deaths as obesity each year.3 Along 
with cardio-metabolic risk, physical inactivity is associ-
ated with lifetime incidence of common mental disorders, 
such as depression4 and anxiety.5 Furthermore, high levels 
of PA may contribute to a more favorable course of ill-
ness among those with schizophrenia,6 reducing both the 
psychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunction associ-
ated with this condition.7,8
Despite the clear benefits of exercise for both physi-
cal and mental health, a recent meta-analysis of 35 stud-
ies conducted across 10 different countries suggested

that people with schizophrenia may be significantly less 
active than the general population,9 and experience mul-
tiple barriers to participate in regular exercise.10 Recent 
worldwide data have demonstrated that cardiovascular 
diseases are associated with a greatly increased premature 
mortality in those with schizophrenia11 compared to the 
cardiovascular diseases in the general population. This is 
also evident in the United Kingdom, where people with 
schizophrenia have some of the worst metabolic health 
and premature mortality recorded worldwide.12,13 These 
health inequalities continue to grow in this patient group.14 
Although this may be due to lifestyle factors, no studies 
have compared PA levels of people with schizophrenia in 
the United Kingdom to the general population.9
Furthermore, the majority of previous studies of PA in 
schizophrenia have relied upon self-report measures,9 the 
validity and value of which remains largely unknown for 
this population. Previous work has suggested that these 
measures may have low reliability and show substantial 
differences to ”gold standard” objective measures (ie, 
accelerometry) in people with schizophrenia.15 Thus, fur-
ther research is required to obtain accurate estimates of 
PA in people with schizophrenia, establish the usefulness 
of self-report measures, and determine which factors may 
influence PA estimates. Indeed, even internationally, there 
is only a small number of population-scale studies which 
have examined PA in people with psychotic disorders, 
and all of these have relied entirely on self-report data.16,17
Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine dif-
ferences in both self-reported and objectively measured 
levels of PA in people with schizophrenia and the gen-
eral population using a large, population-based dataset 
from the UK Biobank. We also aimed to examine the 
epidemiological and clinical utility of self-report mea-
sures in people with schizophrenia through assessing the 
extent to which self-reported PA correlates with objective 
measurements.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the 
baseline assessments for the UK Biobank study, collected 
between 2007 and 2010. The UK Biobank is a popula-
tion-scale, epidemiological study assessing how various 
health-related outcomes relate to lifestyle, environmental, 
and genetic factors.18 Invitations were mailed to around 
9.2 million residential addresses in the United Kingdom, 
which successfully recruited 502 664 adults aged between 
37 and 73. Prospective participants attended their closest 
dedicated assessment center of the 22 located throughout 
the United Kingdom. Here, they provided informed con-
sent and undertook an extensive battery of computerized 
questionnaires, physical health assessments, and in-per-
son interviews with research staff. The full protocol and 
data collection processes for the UK Biobank are avail-
able elsewhere.19
Specific datasets from the UK Biobank are released to 
applicants for the purpose of investigating prespecified 
research questions, following review and approval from 
the UK Biobank’s Access Sub-Committee. This particu-
lar study was approved by the committee on October 4, 
2016, and is covered under the generic ethical approval 
from the NHS Research Ethics Committee (Ref. 11/
NW/0382).
Participants
The UK Biobank is linked to NHS hospital admission 
data, enabling access to recorded clinical diagnoses. For 
the purposes of this study, we classified the schizophre-
nia sample as participants in the UK Biobank with a 
recorded primary or secondary ICD-10 diagnosis of any 
nonaffective psychotic disorder, including schizophrenia 
and schizotypal disorders (disease classes F20–F29). The 
comparison sample was all of the UK Biobank partici-
pants with no recorded history of schizophrenia (or any 
other nonaffective psychotic disorder).
PA and Additional Assessments
PA was assessed over a typical week using 2 methods. 
First, all participants provided a self-report measure of 
PA by completing a touchscreen version of the IPAQ 
short-form, which has been used extensively in both 
healthy populations and patients with schizophrenia.9,20 
This questionnaire assesses PA over the previous week 
by asking participants about the length and frequency of 
their engagement in (1) walking, (2) moderate-intensity 
activity, and (3) vigorous-intensity activity. Scores for 
each of these different modalities of exercise were then 
used to calculate a single score for “total PA” over the 
previous week, in line with IPAQ guidelines, expressed 
as “metabolic equivalent minutes” (MET minutes) of 
activity per week.21 As these estimates rely upon people’s 
recall of activity over the previous week, participants 
with chronic neurological diseases which impair memory 
were excluded from all analyses (supplementary table 1). 
Age, gender, and other sociodemographic characteristics 
were also collected from the computerized questionnaire 
completed at the UK Biobank assessment centers. Body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated from height and weight 
measurements taken by a research assistant on-site dur-
ing the physical health assessments.
PA in a subsample of participants at a later date was 
further measured using accelerometry; the most fre-
quently used objective assessment of PA for epidemio-
logical studies.22,23 A total of 236 519 participants of the 
UK Biobank (ie, all those who had provided a current 
email address) were invited to take part in a 1-week accel-
erometer study. Of these, 106 053 signed-up to wear a PA 
monitor (44.8%) for 1 week. Those who signed-up via 
email were mailed an “Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial

Self-reported Physical Activity and Accelerometry
accelerometer” by post, programmed to capture triaxial 
acceleration data over 5 s epochs for the period of 1 week, 
at 100 Hz and a dynamic range of ±8 g. Nonwear time 
was defined as stationary periods (ie, where all 3 axes had 
a standard deviation of less than <13.0 mg) lasting for 
60 min or longer.24 Identical instructions were provided 
to each participant; informing them to secure the device 
around their dominant wrist, wear it continuously for 
7 days while engaging in their regular day-to-day activities, 
and then return the device to the UK Biobank assessment 
centre via post, using the provided prepaid envelope. The 
accelerometry scores used in this study were calculated 
from the raw accelerometer data using a rigorous data 
processing procedure, published elsewhere.24 This was 
computed as “mean vector magnitude,” which takes into 
account both the time and intensity of motion, in order 
to provide a summary score representing an average PA 
level over a given time period (in this case, one week). 
Participants who returned poorly calibrated devices 
(<0.1% of participants) were unable to be included in the 
analyses. Overall compliance was high, as 80.6% of par-
ticipants wore the device for >150/168 h. However, 6978 
participants (6.7% of sample) who had insufficient device 
wear time (<72 h) to accurately estimate average PA were 
excluded from analyses.24
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted in the statistical software 
R (version 3.1.2). To reduce the impact of anomalous 
data (ie, and those deemed due to error), we removed 
those which reported extremely high levels of activity 
and appeared as outliers (ie, the top 0.5%—supplemen-
tary figure S1) and those with self-report data and accel-
erometer data which were equal to zero weekly activity 
whatsoever (>0.1%). Self-reported activity data were 
log transformed to resolve the left skew of the distribu-
tion (supplementary figure S1). Between-subjects t-tests 
and Wilcoxon tests were then used to summarize the raw 
mean differences in self-reported PA (for low intensity, 
moderate intensity, vigorous intensity, and total METs) 
and objectively measured activity (accelerometer mean 
vector magnitude) between schizophrenia and compari-
son samples. Following this, linear mixed models con-
trolling for age, gender, and BMI as fixed effects, along 
with ethnicity and Biobank testing location as random 
effects, and setting the response variables as the activity 
measure of interest, were performed to examine between-
group differences after controlling for these potentially 
confounding variables.
We then aimed to quantify the magnitude of deficits 
in PA among people with schizophrenia. Firstly, for both 
self-report and accelerometry-calculated activity sepa-
rately, we calculated which quantile each individual with 
schizophrenia fell into within the total distribution of the 
general population. By comparing the average (and 95% 
range) of these quantile scores for self-reported activity 
to that of accelerometry activity, this provides an intui-
tive description of the extent to which people with schizo-
phrenia differ from the general population depending on 
the activity measure used.
Finally, we aimed to establish how well self-reported 
activity within people with schizophrenia aligned their 
accelerometry activity. We assessed the correlation 
between self-reported and accelerometry-measured PA 
levels within the schizophrenia sample using both ranked 
scores within the sample (Spearman’s correlation) as well 
as their percentile score within the general population 
(Pearson’s correlation). This allowed us to assess the util-
ity of self-report measures as a tool for comparing indi-
viduals with schizophrenia on the basis of their PA levels.
Results
A total of 451 627 UK Biobank subjects matched eligibil-
ity criteria and had provided at least one aspect of PA 
information to be included in at least part of this study. 
The patient sample consisted of 1078 participants with 
nonaffective psychotic disorders, diagnosed according 
to ICD-10 criteria. The mean age at study enrolment 
assessment was 54.19 years (SD = 8.39, range = 40–70) 
and were 55% male. The total comparison sample con-
sisted of 450 549 participants with no recorded history 
of schizophrenia (or any other nonaffective psychotic 
disorders). In the comparison group, the mean age was 
56.44 years (SD = 8.11, range = 38–73) and were 46% 
male. The sociodemographic characteristics of patient 
and comparison samples for different levels of the analy-
sis are displayed in table 1.
PA in Schizophrenia and Comparison Samples
Levels of self-reported and objectively measured PA in 
schizophrenia and comparison samples are displayed in 
table 1. Simple statistical tests comparing levels of total 
self-report PA (shown in figure 1a) found no differences 
between people with schizophrenia (mean = 3724 ± 3802 
METs per week) and those without (mean = 3843 ± 3861 
METs per week) (t-test: t = 1.81, df = 406.16, P = .07, 
Wilcox P = .15). This was also confirmed by linear mixed 
models controlling for age, gender, BMI (as fixed effects) 
and ethnicity and testing location (as random effects) 
(LMM coeff  = −0.45, SE = 0.45, t = 1.01, P = .312). We 
also performed separate analyses to compare schizophre-
nia and comparison samples for levels of low, moderate, 
and vigorous intensity activity. These analyses found no 
differences in any type of self-reported activity levels for 
those with schizophrenia compared to those without 
(table 1 and supplementary figure S3).
However, objectively measured PA (ie, accelerom-
etry data) showed that people with schizophrenia 
engaged in significantly less weekly activity (mean vector

magnitude = 23.3 ± 9.74) than those without (mean vec-
tor magnitude = 27.42 ± 9.47). As shown in figure 1b, 
this difference was statistically significant when com-
paring the 2 groups directly (t-test: t = 4.09, df = 83.14, 
P < .0001, Wilcox P < .0001) as well as when controlling 
for potentially influential variables (LMM coeff = −4.585, 
SE = 0.981, t = −4.67, P < .001). Additionally, we carried 
out sensitively analyses considering only those partici-
pants who had provided both sufficient data for both self-
reported total activity scores and accelerometry totals 
(to ensure the above pattern was not related to sample 
size) and found the same results (supplementary figure 
S2). Finally, we also performed sensitivity analyses using 
a patient sample including only those with a diagnosis 
of schizophrenia, schizotypical disorder or schizoaffec-
tive disorder (ICD-10 codes F20, F21, and F25: 78% of 
total sample). This found the same result as the primary 
analyses; with accelerometry scores showing large, signifi-
cant differences between schizophrenia and comparison 
samples (LMM coeff = −0.104, SE = 0.057, t = −1.826, 
P < .068), but with self-report measures failing to find a 
significant difference in total PA between groups (LMM 
coeff = −4.762, SE = 1.312, t = −3.630, P < .001).
This divergence between in self-reported and accel-
erometry activity levels was clearly demonstrated when 
assessing which quantile the schizophrenia sample’s 
score fell into with the general population: When using 
self-report PA totals, the median average scores from the 
schizophrenia sample fell into the 47th percentile for self-
reported activity, with a 95% confidence interval ranging 
from 40th percentile to the 52nd percentile. In contrast, 
when using accelerometry averages, people with schizo-
phrenia fell into the bottom 20% of the general popula-
tion, with a 95% confidence ranging from 15% to 35%. 
Thus, while self-reported measures generally place people 
with schizophrenia as functionally equivalent to those 
without, the accelerometry scores show that, on average, 
people with schizophrenia engage in less PA than 80% of 
the general population.
Although self-report measures failed to provide an 
accurate indication of levels of PA in schizophrenia 
compared to the general population, our correlational 
analyses within the schizophrenia sample found that self-
report measures are useful for comparing levels of PA 
among individuals with schizophrenia: First, when look-
ing only within the schizophrenia sample, individual’s

Self-reported Physical Activity and Accelerometry
rank on self-report accelerometry measures showed a 
moderate correlation with their ranked accelerometry 
activity score (Spearman’s correlation: 0.57, S = 3946, 
P < .001, figure 2b). Similarly, when looking at where 
each individual with schizophrenia fell with regards to 
the general population, the percentile they fell into from 
their self-reported scores was highly correlated with their 
accelerometry activity percentile score (Pearson’s correla-
tion: 0.59, t = 4.37, P < .001, figure 2a). We also sought 
to examine if any inter-individual factors among people 
with schizophrenia predicted their accuracy of self-report 
vs. objectively measured activity means. After calculating 
an activity divergence score within people with schizo-
phrenia (simply their self-reported percentile minus their 
accelerometry percentile), we did not find any evidence 
that age, gender, or BMI of people with schizophre-
nia predicted the difference between their self-reported 
activity and accelerometry measure (t < 0.2, P > .05). 
Therefore, the relationship between relative self-reported 
and accelerometry scores is expected to be reasonably 
consistent across different classes of individuals.
Discussion
This, to our knowledge, is the first study to examine 
differences in self-report and objectively measured PA 
between people with schizophrenia and those without in 
a population-scale dataset (ie, the UK Biobank). We also 
present the first large-scale research on PA levels among 
people with schizophrenia in the United Kingdom, who 
have some of the worst premature mortality and meta-
bolic health outcomes measured across the world,12,13 
which is largely attributed to lifestyle factors (such as 
PA). Across 1078 people with a lifetime diagnosis of 
schizophrenia (and schizophrenia-like disorders), and 
450 549 people without, we show that schizophrenia is 
not associated with any differences in self-report PA (as 
measured with an adapted version of the IPAQ). The data 
clearly indicated that people with schizophrenia matched 
the same self-reported scores of the average population 
for all classes of PA, including low-intensity, moderate, 
and vigorous exercise, along with total weekly levels. 
Therefore, this self-report data alone would indicate that 
the health inequalities displayed by this population could 
not be ascribed to reduced levels of PA, and suggests that 
to experience further benefits from PA (for physical and 
mental health), people with schizophrenia would actually 
have to engage in more than the average level of exercise.
However, our analysis of accelerometry data (the 
“gold-standard” objective measures of PA for epide-
miological studies22,23) showed that in fact, people with 
schizophrenia do show reduced levels of tracked activity 
compared to those without. This was a large and robust 
difference, with 95% of people with schizophrenia falling 
within the bottom 15%–35% of the general population. 
This large difference was equally apparent when using 
models to additionally control for age, gender, BMI, and 
sociodemographic variation. Therefore, this study shows 
that while self-reported data in population studies would 
suggest no PA deficit for people with schizophrenia, accel-
erometry data actually strongly supports the relationship 
between schizophrenia and insufficient PA.9
Given that PA is one of the strongest risk factors 
for premature mortality worldwide,1 and people with

schizophrenia die around 15–25 years younger than the 
general population (largely due to cardiometabolic health 
conditions),12 exercise interventions present an immedi-
ate and obvious opportunity for improving the physical 
health outcomes of this population.14,25 However, the 
means and opportunity to improve the physical health of 
this group through increasing PA would be unknown if 
self-report data were relied upon.
Furthermore, in the general population, physical inac-
tivity has also been shown to be associated with poor men-
tal health (ie, depression and anxiety) and impairments 
in cognitive functioning4,26; both of which are prevalent 
and enduring facets of schizophrenia. Thus, increas-
ing PA may also improve mental health outcomes, and 
reduce the personal and societal burden of the disorder.27 
Indeed, randomized controlled trials have shown that 
exercise interventions can significantly reduce symptoms 
and cognitive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia.7,8 
However, efforts are still required to implement PA as a 
core aspect of clinical treatment for this disorder, and to 
evaluate the impact on physical and mental health from a 
service-level perspective.27,28
Previous studies have established that self-report tools 
such as the IPAQ can be useful for identifying the most/
least active patients within a schizophrenia sample.15 
Our findings support this, but also show that these self-
report measures are unsuitable for studying differences 
in PA between people with/without schizophrenia in 
population-level studies, significantly over-estimating 
PA levels in the target population, and failing to cap-
ture large, significant differences which exist between 
samples. The inaccuracy of self-report PA in people with 
schizophrenia may also extend to measurement of other 
relevant constructs, such as diet, medication adherence 
and social interactions. Along with developing more 
accurate self-report measures for this population,29 epi-
demiological studies should consider implementing new 
tracking methods to measure PA. One promising option 
is mobile phones, which provide an ever-increasing range 
of “mHealth” options for actively and passively measur-
ing PA, along with other lifestyle variables, relevant to 
psychiatric populations.30–32 However, it must be consid-
ered that the clinical usefulness of these new technologies 
is ultimately reliant upon patient compliance.33 Although 
various strategies have proven effective for promoting 
compliance to traditional accelerometer devices in peo-
ple with schizophrenia,34 optimal techniques for engag-
ing patient in mobile health monitoring and intervention 
have yet to be determined. Nonetheless, given the broad 
acceptability and adoption of these technologies among 
people with schizophrenia,35,36 mobile devices could ulti-
mately provide a new platform for identifying and inter-
vening in low PA (and other adverse lifestyle behaviors) 
for this patient group.
One limitation of this study is the relatively limited 
size of the schizophrenia sample in comparison to the 
general population; as the 1078 patients identified fell 
short of the estimated 1% which would be expected from 
the total sample. This is because the UK Biobank study 
did not systematically assess/interview participants for 
schizophrenia or related disorders. Instead, the informa-
tion available for identifying patients with schizophrenia 
was through UK Biobank links to diagnostic records. 
Nonetheless, this methodology also adds strength to 
the results, by assuring that the target sample did indeed 
have a ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related 
disorders).
The lack of psychiatric evaluation data also meant we 
were unable to examine how the clinical characteristics 
of individuals with schizophrenia influence the accuracy 
of self-report measures. In this study, we investigated the 
sociodemographic factors (eg, age, gender) that caused 
divergence between self-report and objective measures for 
the schizophrenia sample; finding that none of these par-
ticular factors influenced this, thus indicating self-report 
measures are equally inaccurate across different classes of 
patients. However, due to a lack of clinical data in the UK 
Biobank, we were unable to explore the impact of other 
putative factors, such as symptom severity, illness dura-
tion, and cognitive dysfunction. Future research should 
aim to determine which factors influence the accuracy of 
self-report measures in this population (for PA and for 
other constructs), to inform the clinical application of 
these tools (by identifying which individuals self-report 
measures are/are not suitable for), along with providing 
new insights into what causes the observed inaccuracies 
in self-report measures.
A further limitation is that the accelerometry data 
were collected at a different time-point to self-reported 
PA, and thus some differences in weekly averages would 
be expected. Nonetheless, our findings that self-reported 
activity held significant and moderately strong corre-
lations with accelerometry scores indicates weekly PA 
totals were reasonably consistent over the data collection 
period. Finally, in this study, accelerometry data was only 
available for “total weekly PA,” as we used accelerome-
try scores derived from previous data processing studies 
of the UK Biobank (rather than raw data).24 Given that 
the self-report data showed equivalence between people 
with schizophrenia and general population across all 
classes of low intensity, moderate and vigorous activity, 
it would be interesting to objectively assess where the dif-
ferences in activity for people with schizophrenia actually 
arose from. Furthermore, the role of sedentary behavior 
should not be neglected. This can be considered an inde-
pendent construct to PA/exercise in terms of individual’s 
engagement levels, and its impact on health.37,38 Previous 
meta-analyses have shown that people with schizophrenia 
engage in high levels of daily sedentary behavior, which is 
under-estimated by self-report measures.39
Future studies should aim to improve the accuracy of 
self-report measures, or increase the ubiquity of objective

measures, to determine which types of PA are most 
reduced, and which types of sedentary behaviors are most 
increased, in people with schizophrenia. Future research 
should examine how deficits in specific intensities of activ-
ity relate to both cardiovascular health and psychiatric 
symptoms among people with schizophrenia. It should 
also be noted that this research was conducted in older 
age individuals, for both the schizophrenia and compari-
son samples. Since PA decreases per decade in both the 
general population24 and in people with psychosis,40 our 
findings may not generalize to younger people. Indeed, 
younger patients, in earlier stages of psychotic disorders, 
are generally more active, fitter and more likely to engage 
in moderate to vigorous exercise than older patients with 
long-term schizophrenia.9,40–42 Further research should 
aim to identify when differences in PA between people 
with schizophrenia and the general population first arise, 
to inform the development of targeted PA programs for 
improving the typically poor physical and mental health 
outcomes observed in this population.
