The consumption of probiotics has become increasingly popular as a means to try to improve health and 
well-being. Not only are probiotics considered beneficial to digestive health, but increasing evidence 
suggests direct and indirect interactions between gut microbiota (GM) and the central nervous system 
(CNS). Here, adult zebrafish were supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum to determine the effects 
of probiotic treatment on structural and functional changes of the GM, as well as host neurological 
and behavioral changes. L. plantarum administration altered the β-diversity of the GM while leaving 
the major core architecture intact. These minor structural changes were accompanied by significant 
enrichment of several predicted metabolic pathways. In addition to GM modifications, L. plantarum 
treatment also significantly reduced anxiety-related behavior and altered GABAergic and serotonergic 
signaling in the brain. Lastly, L. plantarum supplementation provided protection against stress-induced 
dysbiosis of the GM. These results underscore the influence commensal microbes have on physiological 
function in the host, and demonstrate bidirectional communication between the GM and the host.
Stress and anxiety disorders are two of the most common psychiatric illnesses worldwide, affecting both children 
and adults. According to the American Psychiatric Association, people who experience stress and anxiety over 
long periods of time frequently experience deleterious health outcomes. Currently, the primary medical means 
to mitigate these conditions is pharmacological treatment that attempts to counteract the dysregulation of one 
or more major neurotransmitter systems in the brain associated with these disorders. These systems include 
the catecholaminergic (noradrenaline, dopamine), GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid; GABA), glutama-
tergic (glutamate) and serotonergic (serotonin) systems1,2. However, these disorders not only manifest in specific 
behaviors and neurological symptoms, but are also often closely associated with various conditions affecting the 
digestive tract3. Despite sufficient evidence demonstrating the linkage between neurological and digestive disor-
ders, current treatments focus on minimizing dysregulation at the neurological level. Moreover, the efficacy of 
anxiolytic compounds used to treat anxiety disorders varies between individuals4, and new approaches to treat 
these conditions are needed.
Notably, manipulation and regulation of an organism’s gut microbiota (GM) may provide an alternative or 
adjunct to current approaches. Probiotics have become increasingly popular as a means to improve health and 
well-being. Not only are probiotics considered beneficial to digestive health, but increasing evidence of direct and 
indirect interactions between the GM and the central nervous system (CNS) suggests beneficial effects to neu-
rological health as well. Specifically, in addition to direct effects on the innate immune system and composition 
of the resident microbiota, certain strains of Lactobacillus exert a positive effect on anxiety-related behavior and 
responses to stress5,6.
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an emerging model species for neurobehavioral studies and their use is 
well-established in the drug screening sector. Zebrafish exhibit numerous behaviors that have been correlated

with those seen in human neurological processes and disorders, such as anxiety7, learning8, fear9, sociability10, 
and psychosis11, and zebrafish neurotransmitter systems demonstrate clear translatability to other organisms 
including rodents and humans12. Moreover, studies utilizing anxiolytic and anxiogenic treatments have validated 
many anxiety-related behavioral tests in zebrafish models both qualitatively and quantitatively13. While probi-
otics have been shown to modulate innate immunity and expression of stress-related genes in zebrafish14, it is 
currently unknown whether there is a corresponding reduction in stress- and anxiety-related behavior in the fish. 
Additionally, the effect of probiotics on the structure and function of the GM is not well understood in zebrafish.
Here, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from the intestinal content of 
zebrafish with and without L. plantarum supplementation. Furthermore, L. plantarum treatment was also 
correlated with anxiety-related behavioral testing in a novel tank diving test. In conjunction with behavioral 
changes, gene regulation involved in the GABAergic and serotonergic pathways were analyzed in the brains of 
 
L. plantarum-treated and non-treated zebrafish. Lastly, the influence of L. plantarum on stress-induced changes in 
the composition of the GM were evaluated. These data characterize the effect L. plantarum has on GM structure 
and predicted function in adult zebrafish. Moreover, these data illustrate the ability of L. plantarum to attenuate 
anxiety-related behavior and stress-induced dysbiosis of the GM.
Results
Zebrafish GM structure and function is altered by L. plantarum treatment. 
Comparison of the 
detected microbial profiles at the taxonomic level of phylum did not reveal any major core shifts of the GM (Supp. 
Table 1). Similar to previous reports15, zebrafish GM was dominated by the phyla Fusobacteria (mean ± 
 SEM 
relative abundance of 76.9 ± 
 8.3%) and Proteobacteria (11.9 ± 
 5.2%). L. plantarum treatment did not signifi-
cantly alter the α 
-diversity, as determined via the Shannon diversity index (Fig. 1A), Chao1 index (Fig. 1B), or 
the Simpson diversity index (Fig. 1C). Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that while there 
was subtle separation of groups PERMANOVA failed to detect a significant difference in β 
-diversity (Fig. 1D). 
 
A L. plantarum species-specific qPCR was performed to confirm successful colonization of L. plantarum in 
the zebrafish gut (Fig. 1E). Next, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was used to determine

microbial alterations that were significantly associated with L. plantarum treatment16. It was found that unclas-
sified (UC) Vibrionaceae, UC Pseudoalteromonadaceae, Devosia, UC Leuconostocaceae, and Rheinheimera were 
significantly enriched in the control group, whereas UC Mycoplasmataceae, Stenotrophomonas, Catenibacterium, 
UC Lactobacillaceae, and Achromobacter were enriched in the L. plantarum-treated group (Fig. 2A–G).
To determine the metabolic alterations associated with the GM differences, the Phylogenetic Investigation of 
Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) software package was applied to the current 
16S rRNA amplicon dataset17. A total of 24 different predicted gene functions, grouped according to KEGG 
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) category18, were predicted to be significantly enriched in the 
 
L. plantarum treated zebrafish (Fig. 3). Most of these pathways are broadly involved in energy metabolism and 
vitamin biosynthesis.
L. plantarum alters anxiety-related behavior and the serotonergic pathway in adult zebrafish. 
 
Novel tank diving is a validated behavior test for assessing anxiety-related behavior in adult zebrafish, wherein 
the time spent in top portions of the tank correlates with less anxiety. To determine if L. plantarum influences 
anxiety-related behavior in adult zebrafish, a novel tank diving test was performed on fish supplemented with and 
without L. plantarum. Zebrafish from both groups displayed similar locomotor activity (p > 
 0.05) as measured 
by the total distance traveled and average swimming speed (Fig. 4A,B). However, zebrafish supplemented with 
 
L. plantarum exhibited a strong trend of more transitions to the upper zone (p = 
 0.08) and spent significantly 
more time in the upper portion of the tank (p = 
 0.01) (Fig. 4C–F). These results suggest that L. plantarum is 
 
sufficient in reducing anxiety-related behavior in adult zebrafish.
To assess the expression levels of genes associated with anxiety-related behavior, quantitative real-time PCR 
was performed on samples extracted from the brains of control and L. plantarum treated zebrafish. The gene 
encoding for the GABA-A receptor alpha 1, gabra1, had a trend of up-regulation in L. plantarum-treated fish 
(p = 
 0.06). Glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad1) also had a trend in L. plantarum treated zebrafish (p = 
 0.13) 
(Fig. 4G). Similarly, genes encoding for serotonin transporters (slc6a4a and slc6a4b) were also up-regulated 
in L. plantarum-treated zebrafish, although slc6a4b was not statistically significant (p = 
 0.04 and 0.12, respec-
tively) (Fig. 4G). Neuropeptides also have modulatory roles in a variety of behaviors including stress and anxiety. 
However, L. plantarum treatment had no effect on neuropeptide Y (npy) and isotocin (oxtl) expression levels 
(p > 
 0.05) (Fig. 4G). Collectively, these results suggest that the anxiolytic effect of L. plantarum could be due to 
modulation of GABAergic and/or serotonergic pathways.

Elevation of serum cortisol and leukocyte patterning in response to a chronic unpredictable 
stress (CUS) test is unaffected by L. plantarum treatment. 
Downstream events from activation of 
the hypothalamic pituitary interrenal (HPI) axis were examined in order to determine if L. plantarum modified 
physiological effects of CUS. Serum cortisol levels were significantly elevated (p < 
 0.05) as a result of CUS in both 
the control and L. plantarum-supplemented groups (Fig. 5A). Cortisol levels from CUS fish treated with L. plan-
tarum were not found to be significantly lower than those of the CUS control group (Fig. 5A).
Increased steroid hormones in the plasma often lead to characteristic stress leukogram patterns. Leukocyte 
differentials were performed to determine whether L. plantarum treatment led to altered leukogram patterns. 
CUS was found to significantly decrease the amount of circulating lymphocytes (p < 
 0.01) in both control and 
L. plantarum-supplemented fish (Fig. 5B). A monocytosis was also revealed in zebrafish subjected to CUS inde-
pendent of L. plantarum treatment (p < 
 0.01) (Fig. 5C). No effect was observed on neutrophil and eosinophil 
counts (Fig. 5D,E). Taken together, these results suggest that L. plantarum supplementation is insufficient in 
attenuating effects of HPI axis activation due to CUS in adult zebrafish.
Stress-induced dysbiosis of the GM is protected by L. plantarum in adult zebrafish. 
To assess the 
influence of CUS on the architecture of the GM, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed on stressed and 
non-stressed zebrafish. This was done on both control fish and fish supplemented with L. plantarum to determine 
if probiotic treatment had any interactions with stress-induced GM changes. Zebrafish not supplemented with 
L. plantarum exhibited dramatic shifts in the GM after CUS. This stress-induced GM shift resulted in dimin-
ishment of the relative abundance of the core phylum, Fusobacteria (p < 
 0.001). However, the major core GM 
remained intact in zebrafish treated with L. plantarum after a chronic stress treatment (Fig. 6A). A complete list 
of OTUs altered by CUS exposure can be found in Supplementary Table 2. Principal component analysis further 
demonstrated a significant shift in the GM structure in chronically stressed zebrafish not supplemented with 
L. plantarum (Fig. 6B,C). Analysis via MANOVA detected significant main effects of both CUS and treatment 
with L. plantarum (p = 
 0.018 for both), as well as a significant interaction between those variables (p = 
 0.017). 
Overlaid clustering between the stressed and non-stressed groups indicated that no major alterations occurred 
in the GM structure of chronically stressed zebrafish supplemented with L. plantarum (Fig. 6B,C). Additionally, 
L. plantarum protected from particular stress-induced KEGG orthologue pathway up- and down- regulation. 
Riboflavin and other vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism was significantly downregulated in stressed zebrafish 
not supplemented with L. plantarum (Supp. Fig. 1). Enrichment of these specific pathways remained unaltered

dysbiosis (both structurally and functionally) of the GM can be mitigated by L. plantarum treatment in zebrafish.

Discussion
The current data provide evidence that probiotic treatment alters the structure and function of the GM and 
mitigates behavioral responses in adult zebrafish. Specifically, this study shows that L. plantarum administration 
causes subtle alterations of the GM and enriches a number of KEGG pathway orthologues involved in energy 
production. Furthermore, L. plantarum treatment was shown to significantly reduce anxiety-related behavior and 
modulate serotonergic signaling in the brain. GABAergic signaling was also thought to be altered in the L. plan-
tarum treated fish, however, no statistically significant results were found. The lack of significant findings is likely 
due to the large variance of gene expression found in individual zebrafish and the modest sample size analyzed. 
Effects of HPI axis activation in response to chronic stress was not mitigated by L. plantarum. However, the GM 
structure displayed a significant shift in response to a chronic stressor in control fish and L. plantarum treatment 
was protective against this stress-induced dysbiosis of the GM. These data are a further indication of the bidirec-
tional communication between the GM and the host, as well as additional validation for the use of zebrafish as a 
model for gut-brain interactions.
Previous studies have shown the microbiota of most mammals is dominated by the phyla Firmicutes and 
Bacteroidetes, whereas the core microbiota of zebrafish predominantly consists of bacteria from the Proteobacteria 
and Fusobacteria phyla15,19,20. However, studies have also shown similarities between the zebrafish microbiota and 
that of rodents and humans, such as colonization by species from the genus Lactobacillus14,21,22. The data shown 
here are congruent with these other findings, since we found that the GM of healthy adult zebrafish primarily 
consists of Fusobacteria and administration of L. plantarum does indeed result in colonization in the gut. To date, 
there are a limited number of studies demonstrating the associations of altered GM following treatment with pro-
biotics. The data reported here show that administration of L. plantarum did not alter α 
-diversity of the GM and 
the GM remains dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. However, principal component analysis 
(PCA) illustrating β 
-diversity revealed distinct clustering of control fish and fish treated with L. plantarum. These 
minor alterations are not completely surprising given that other studies have shown that administration of multi-
ple probiotics can significantly alter the GM23,24. Specifically, Lactobacillus rhamnosus modulates the GM associ-
ated with a reduction of serum lipids in the hyperlipidemic rat23. Moreover, it has been reported that Lactobacillus 
reuteri supplementation alters the oral microbiota within a 12 week period24.
To determine if functional metabolic changes accompanied L. plantarum-induced GM shifts, the 16S rRNA 
amplicon dataset was subjected to Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved 
States (PICRUSt) analysis. Recent human microbiome studies have shown that alterations in the GM due to 
Clostridium difficile colonization significantly alter metabolic pathways involved in amino acid biosynthesis and 
transport and binding carbohydrates25. The results of the current study further illustrate how GM modifica-
tions can influence metabolomics. L. plantarum administration significantly enriched many metabolic pathways 
involved in energy metabolism and vitamin biosynthesis. Notably, folate (folic acid) biosynthesis was predicted 
to be enriched with L. plantarum supplementation. This is congruent with previous studies showing the ability of 
probiotics to synthesize vitamins such as folic acid, riboflavin, and vitamin B12
26,27. Interestingly, both riboflavin 
and folic acid have been correlated with protection against behavioral impairments and stress28,29.
Many nutrients such as vitamins, amino acids, or dietary fibers that are consumed by the host are assimilated 
and converted into other metabolites by microbes within the gastrointestinal tract. Products of these biochemical

have a significant reduction of circulating lymphocytes (B), a significant increase in circulating monocytes  
(C), and no alterations in neutrophils or eosinophils (D,E, respectively) compared to non-stressed controls.

conversions, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), biogenic amines, or other amino acid-derived compounds 
such as serotonin or GABA, may be biologically active within the host30. Previous studies have shown that many 
of these neuroactive compounds that can be produced by the GM have the ability to alter neurological func-
tion and behavior31. One particular pathway of communication between the GM and the CNS is mediated via 
GABA transmission and is dependent upon the vagus nerve6. Our data provide further evidence of GM signaling 
through the GABAergic pathway to alter behavior. Specifically, zebrafish treated with L. plantarum exhibited 
significantly less anxiety-related behavior compared to untreated controls. Along with behavioral modula-
tion, L. plantarum administration also correlated with a trending increase of GABA-A receptor and significant 
increase in serotonin transporter expression in the brain. These findings are consistent with a recent study that 
shows up-regulation of genes involved in serotonergic signaling in the brain of L. rhamnosus-treated zebrafish32. 
Although no direct causative relationship was investigated in this study, it is known that regulation of GABAergic 
and serotonergic pathways are associated with anxiety-related behavior in many species33–37. Many of the current 
therapeutics available for treating anxiety-related symptoms are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and ben-
zodiazepines. The primary mechanism of action of these drugs is to increase serotonin and GABA transmission 
in the brain, respectively. Moreover, it has been shown that some strains of Lactobacillus catalyze the decarboxyl-
ation of glutamate, resulting in the production of GABA and CO2
38.

Anxiety and anxiety-related behavior is frequently accompanied with activation of the HPA axis and stress. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that GM modulation of anxiety-related behavior often correlates with attenua-
tion of stress responses in rodents6,39. To test the ability of L. plantarum to attenuate responses to stress, zebrafish 
with and without L. plantarum supplementation were subjected to a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) para-
digm. Responses to stress rely heavily on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and its synthesis 
of glucocorticoids. Previous reports have demonstrated functional and anatomical parallels between the zebrafish 
hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and the mammalian HPA axis, wherein cortisol is the primary cor-
ticosteroid produced in both zebrafish and humans40–42. During a characteristic stress response, corticosteroids 
often modulate leukocyte trafficking in many species43–45. Typically, a stress leukogram consists of a marginaliza-
tion of lymphocytes, complemented by an increase in serum monocytes and neutrophils. Results shown here do 
not recapitulate these findings in adult zebrafish. Activation of the HPI axis was shown in both the control group 
and fish supplemented with L. plantarum in response to a chronic stress paradigm. Serum cortisol was signifi-
cantly elevated in all fish subjected to CUS independent of L. plantarum supplementation. The elevation of serum 
cortisol was also accompanied by a significant lymphopenia and monocytosis in all stress groups. The discrepan-
cies between probiotics modulating stress responses in rodents and seemingly not affecting HPI axis activation in 
our study are possibly due to the nature of chronic unpredictable stressor administered.
Probiotics are often used to correct dysbiotic states of the GM. The results of the current study demonstrate 
that probiotic supplementation is protective against stress-induced dysbiosis of the GM in adult zebrafish. 
Specifically, the major core phylum (Fusobacteria) was greatly diminished in chronically stressed zebrafish not 
treated with L. plantarum. However, only minor stress-induced changes occurred in zebrafish with probiotic 
supplementation. Microbiota structural alterations were accompanied by predicted functional metabolic changes. 
In particular it was shown that stress-induced downregulation of riboflavin biosynthesis occurred in stressed 
fish not supplemented with L. plantarum. Pathways involved in synthesis of riboflavin and other vitamin were of 
particular interest due to their protective roles against oxidative stress29. In conclusion, this study demonstrates 
that probiotics modify the GM as well as additional evidence of key metabolic pathways that could lead to phys-
iological changes in the host. These findings underscore the influence of commensal microbes on neurological 
function and behavioral responses, while demonstrating clear bidirectional communication between the GM and 
the host. Moreover, the results provide further support for the use of zebrafish for microbiota-related neuroim-
mune research.
Methods
Animals. 
Adult wild-type zebrafish were purchased from Aquatica BioTech (Sun City Center, FL) and accli-
mated to the facility for 1 week prior to any treatment. Zebrafish were maintained in recirculating 3 L tanks at 
28 ± 2 °C on a 14:10 h light:dark cycle and fed commercial fish diet.
Lactobacillus treatment groups were supplemented with 1 × 
 106 CFU/mL of Lactobacillus plantarum 
(USDA-ARS, Washington DC) twice a day for one month prior to behavior testing or microbiota analysis. 
 
L. plantarum was administered according to adaptations of previous studies via supplementing the tank water 
during feeding times46–48. A chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm was modified from a previous study49. 
Specific conditions for the multiple stressors can be found in Supplementary Table 3. All experimental procedures 
were approved by the University of Missouri’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed 
according to the guidelines set forth in the Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals.
Microbial DNA extraction and quantification. 
Microbial DNA was extracted according to a previ-
ously published protocol optimized for microbiota analysis in adult zebrafish15. Immediately following eutha-
nasia, zebrafish GI tracts were aseptically collected into 800 μ 
L of lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM tris-HCl, 
50 mM EDTA, and 4% SDS), homogenized for 3 minutes in a Qiagen Tissuelyser II, and incubated at 70 °C for 
20 minutes. Following centrifugation at 5000 × 
 g for 5 minutes at room temperature, the supernatant was mixed 
with 200 μ 
L of 10 mM ammonium acetate, incubated on ice for 5 minutes, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 
10 minutes at room temperature. 750 μ 
L of supernatant was then mixed with an equal volume of chilled isopro-
panol, and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. The contents of the tube were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 minutes 
to pellet DNA. The pellet was rinsed twice with 70% EtOH and re-suspended in 150 μ 
L of tris-EDTA. Fifteen μ 
L 
of proteinase-K and 200 μ 
L of buffer AL (DNeasy kit, Qiagen) were added and tubes were incubated at 70 °C for 
10 minutes. 200 μ 
L of 100% EtOH was then added and the entire contents of the tube were transferred to a Qiagen 
spin column before continuing with the manufacturer’s instructions for DNA purification (DNeasy Kit, Qiagen). 
DNA was eluted in 200 μ 
L of EB buffer (Qiagen). Yield of double-stranded DNA was determined via fluorometry 
(Qubit 2.0, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using Qubit® dsDNA BR assay kits (Life Technologies).
Metagenomic library preparation and sequencing. 
Sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA 
gene was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA amplicons were constructed 
by amplification of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene with primers flanked by Illumina stand-
ard adapter sequences. Universal primers (U515F/806R) previously developed against the V4 region were used 
for generating amplicons. Oligonucleotide sequences were obtained at proBase. A single forward primer and 
reverse primers with unique 12-base indices were used in all reactions. Extracted DNA was quantitated by Qubit 
flourometer using the quant-iT HS dsDNA reagent kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions (50 uL) contained 100 ng of 
genomic DNA, forward and reverse primers (0.2 uM each), dNTPs (200 uM each), and Phusion High-Fidelity 
DNA Polymerase (1 U). PCR amplification was performed as follows: amplification at 98 °C for 3 minutes, and 25 
cycles at 98 °C for denaturation for 15 seconds, annealing at 50 °C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 °C for 30 sec-
onds, then a final extension at 72 °C for 7 minutes. Amplified product (5 ul) from each reaction was combined 
and thoroughly mixed; pooled amplicons were purified by addition of Axygen AxyPrep MagPCR Clean-up beads

(50 uL) to an equal volume of 50 uL of amplicons and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Products 
were washed multiple times with 80% ethanol and the dried pellet resuspended in Qiagen EB Buffer (32.5 uL), 
incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes, and then placed on a magnetic stand for 5 minutes. Supernatant 
(30 uL) was transferred to a low-binding microcentrifuge tube for storage. The final amplicon pool was evaluated 
using the Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer automated electrophoresis system, quantified with the Qubit 
flourometer using the quant-iT HS dsDNA reagent kit, and diluted according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 
sequencing on the MiSeq.
Bioinformatic analysis. 
Assembly, binning, and annotation of DNA sequences were performed at the MU 
Informatics Research Core Facility (IRCF). Briefly, contiguous sequences of DNA were assembled using FLASH 
software50 and contigs were culled if found to be short after trimming for a base quality less than 31. Qiime v1.751 
software was used to perform de novo and reference-based chimera detection and removal, and remaining con-
tigs were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a criterion of 97% nucleotide identity. Taxonomy 
was assigned to selected OTUs using BLAST52 against the Greengenes database53 of 16S rRNA sequences and 
taxonomy.
Quantitative RT-PCR. 
To measure the mRNA abundance of gad1, gabra1, slc6a4a, slc6a4b, neuropeptide Y 
(npy), and isotocin (oxtl), zebrafish brains were removed immediately following euthanasia. RNA was extracted 
from individual brains via an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and cDNA synthesized using an EasyScript Plus™ 
 cDNA 
Synthesis kit (Lambda Biotech, Ballwin, MO). Samples were then analyzed in duplicate and target mRNA expres-
sion was normalized to ef1a (housekeeping gene) expression. A complete list of primer sequences and references 
can be found in Supplementary Table 4. Every 10 μ 
L reaction contained 1× 
 SsoAdvanced universal SYBR® 
 Green 
supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA), 0.3 μ 
M forward and reverse primers, and 100 ng cDNA template. PCR param-
eters were: amplification at 95 °C for 3 minutes, and 50 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 seconds, annealing at 
60 °C for 20 seconds, and extension at 72 °C for 20 seconds, with a plate read after each cycle (CFX384™ 
 real-time 
system, BioRad).
Novel tank diving. 
Anxiety-related behavior was assessed by subjecting zebrafish to a novel tank diving 
test as previously described54. Novel tank diving is a validated assessment of anxiety in zebrafish that has been 
extensively studied using anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs that significantly attenuate and enhance this behavior, 
respectively54. Briefly, fish were individually placed into a novel tank and allowed to freely explore the tank for 
6 minutes. ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) was used to measure distance traveled, 
speed, transitions to various levels of the tank and time spent within those levels. The water was changed and 
tanks cleaned in between each trial to eliminate any alarm cues from previously tested fish.
Serum collection and cortisol ELISA. 
Euthanasia and serum collection was performed using previously 
described techniques55. Each fish was placed into an individual 50-mL conical tube containing 20 mL of sterile 
water with 0.1% (v/v) of clove oil. Blood was collected by cutting off the tail three millimeters cranial to the caudal 
fin. Fish were then placed in a fenestrated microtube (0.6 mL) nested within a 1.5 mL microfuge tube for centrifu-
gation at 400 × 
 g for 5 min at room temperature. The 1.5 mL tubes containing the blood samples were centrifuged 
at 4 °C, 13,800 × 
 g for 15 min. Supernatants were recovered and the serum was stored at − 
80 °C until analysis. 
Serum cortisol concentrations were determined using a cortisol ELISA kit (Salimetrics, Carlsbad, CA) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sensitivity of the assay is less than 0.007 μ 
g/dL, and cortisol concentrations 
were read on a plate reader (SpectraMax M3, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Leukocyte differentials. 
Following euthanasia, blood was collected into a heparinized capillary tube via 
cardiac puncture. Blood smears were immediately prepared from whole blood and stained with Wright-Giemsa 
using a Hematek Slide Stainer (Siemens Health Care Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, NY). The slides were examined 
by light microscopy and leukocyte differentials were performed under oil immersion with a 100× objective.
Statistics. 
Data were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software) and SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose, 
CA). Statistical significance was set at a p value of less than 0.05. Principal component analysis was performed 
using a non-linear iterative partial least squares algorithm implemented in an Excel macro kindly provided by 
Hiroshi Tsugawa of the Riken Institute (Wako, Japan) to evaluate β 
-diversity and its association with zebrafish 
treatment. MANOVA was performed using SPSS Amos 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY). PERMANOVA was performed 
using the Past 3.x software package, freely available at folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/. A student’s t-test was used for 
α 
-diversity indexes, relative microbial abundance data, behavior analysis, and for gene expression. Leukocyte 
counts and cortisol data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, with probiotic treatment as one factor and stress 
as the second factor. A student-newman-keuls post-hoc test was performed on ANOVA analyses.
