Aim: To investigate whether clinical inertia, the failure to intensify treatment regimens when required, exists in people with type 2 diabetes treated with
basal insulin.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study involving patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database between
January 2004 and December 2011, with follow-up until December 2013.
Results: A total of 11 696 patients were included in the analysis. Among all patients, 36.5% had their treatment intensified during the study period; of
these, the treatment of 50.0, 42.5 and 7.4% was intensified with bolus or premix insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, respectively. The
median time from initiation of basal insulin to treatment intensification was 4.3 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1, 4.6]. Among patients clinically
eligible for treatment intensification [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol)], 30.9% had their treatment regimen intensified. The median
time to intensification in this group was 3.7 years (95% CI 3.4, 4.0). Increasing age, duration of diabetes, oral antihyperglycaemic agent usage and
Charlson comorbidity index score were associated with a significant delay in the time to intensification (p < 0.05). Among patients with HbA1c ≥7.5%
(58 mmol/mol), 32.1% stopped basal insulin therapy.
Conclusions: Strategies should be developed to increase the number of patients undergoing therapy intensification and to reduce the delay in
intensifying therapy for suitable patients on basal insulin. Initiatives to support patients continuing on insulin are also required.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by a
decline in 𝛽-cell function and loss of glycaemic control, with
many patients ultimately requiring intensification of their treat-
ment regimen [1]. Guidelines for the treatment of patients with
type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycaemic control should be
maintained [defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <7.0%
(53 mmol/mol)] through active titration of combinations of
antihyperglycaemic medications and lifestyle modification, as
appropriate [2,3]. Additional antihyperglycaemic drugs may be
added if the HbA1c level continues to remain above the rec-
ommended target of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol). If HbA1c is ≥7.5%
(58 mmol/mol), further intensification, including the use of
insulin, is recommended [2–4]. As people with diabetes move

through the recommended treatment algorithm, those patients
who are suboptimally controlled according to the guideline tar-
gets may be at greater risk of long-term diabetes-related com-
plications [5,6].
A major concern in the clinical community is the failure of
a very high proportion of patients to reach the recommended
glycaemic targets for a considerable period of time after the
diagnosis of diabetes [7–11]. Among those with poor glycaemic
control, an overwhelmingly large proportion of patients expe-
rience a delay before their treatment is intensified [8,11]. This
delay in treatment intensification, also termed ‘
clinical iner-
tia’
, has been investigated in a number of studies [7–11]. A
recent study by Khunti et al. [8] reported that the average
time to intensification with two oral antihyperglycaemic agents
(OHAs) from one OHA, among patients with HbA1c >7.0%
(53 mmol/mol), was ∼3 years. A major reason for clinical iner-
tia is the failure to act by healthcare professionals in primary
care [12].
A large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes with poor
glycaemic control receive insulin treatment, although studies
have reported significant delay in initiation of insulin treatment
after glycaemic failure with oral antidiabetes drugs [13–15].
Failure to switch insulin regimens or to intensify treatment has
been reported even when HbA1c remains well above glycaemic

targets [16]. Initiation of insulin treatment with basal insulin
is often a preferred option for primary care physicians for its
logistic ease and also for its relatively low risk of hypoglycaemia
[15,17,18]; however, there is no fixed standard for intensifica-
tion of insulin treatment in patients who continue to have poor
glycaemic control after insulin initiation, and it is often guided
by individual patients’and their service providers’choices [3].
Although several clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of
adding multiple insulin treatment regimens in patients with
poorly controlled diabetes, studies evaluating the real-world
scenario in terms of robust and timely management of insulin
treatment in patients with diabetes are scarce [15,19,20]. More-
over, it is important that studies into clinical inertia are carried
out regularly to keep pace with changes in patient demograph-
ics, therapy options and clinical guidelines.
In the present study, we investigated whether clinical iner-
tia exists in a more progressed group of patients with type 2
diabetes; those who are treated with basal insulin ± OHAs. The
specific objectives of our analysis were: (i) to estimate the like-
lihood of intensification and time from starting basal insulin
to intensification, defined as adding bolus or premix insulin or
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs); and
(ii) to estimate the likelihood of intensification and time spent
in poor glycaemic control [HbA1c >7.5% (58 mmol/mol)]
before intensifying treatment.
Research Design and Methods
The data for this retrospective cohort study were extracted from
the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The CPRD
is one of the largest proprietary, anonymized, longitudinal,
well validated databases derived from UK primary care and it
contains patient-level clinical information including diagnoses,
mortality, laboratory results and prescription data [21]. This
database is representative of the UK general population, with
age and sex distributions similar to those reported by the UK
National Population Census [22]. All information collected in
the CPRD has been subjected to validation studies and has been
proven to contain consistent and high-quality data [23].
The cohort consisted of patients with type 2 diabetes who
had started basal insulin therapy in the period between 1 Jan-
uary 2004 and 31 December 2011, with end of follow-up on 31
December 2013 (minimum and maximum potential exposure
times were 2 years and 10 years, respectively). The patients were
classified as having type 2 diabetes according to Read/OXMIS
codes, using algorithms based on age at diagnosis, type of
treatment and age at treatment [24,25]. The patients were aged
≥18 years and had been registered in the CPRD for at least
180 days before the index date (starting basal insulin). The
index date served as baseline for the study period. The duration
of diabetes was the time from first diagnosis of diabetes in the
CPRD until the index date. Basal insulin was defined according
to British National Formulary chapter 6.1.2 (intermediate and
long-acting) [26]. Poor glycaemic control was defined as a
recording of HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) taken >6 months
after starting basal insulin: the 6-month window was chosen
to allow sufficient time to titrate patients to target HbA1c
levels. In the second objective of our analysis – to estimate the
likelihood of intensification and time spent in poor glycaemic
control [HbA1c > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol)] before intensifying
treatment – only those patients who were in poor glycaemic
control contributed to ‘
risk time’ (time in poor glycaemic
control); all other patients were censored. To understand the
influence of the HbA1c level on the decision of whether or not
to intensify treatment, a sensitivity analysis was performed with
an HbA1c threshold of 8.0% (64 mmol/mol). The influence of
comorbidities on time to intensification was evaluated using
the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score [27]. CCI scores
predict the 10-year mortality for a patient who may have a
range of comorbid conditions, such as renal failure, cancer or
congestive heart failure. Each condition is assigned a score of
1, 2, 3 or 6, depending on the level of risk [27]. In the present
study, all patients were assigned a minimum value of one based
on their diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. To assess whether the
date of basal insulin initiation, and thus potential follow-up
time, affected the time to intensification, a sensitivity analysis
of subcohorts starting basal insulin before 1 January 2006, 1
January 2009 and 1 July 2011 was performed.
The study protocol was approved by the Independent Sci-
entific Advisory Committee of the CPRD (protocol number
14_027R).
Statistical Methods
Characteristics of the study population were presented by num-
ber (%), mean [standard deviation (s.d.)], or median [interquar-
tile range (IQR)]), as appropriate. A Kaplan–Meier estimator
was used to estimate the distribution of time from initiation
of basal insulin to intensification, as well as time in poor gly-
caemic control until intensification. Time to event analysis (Cox
regression) was used to investigate the effect of covariates on the
distribution of time from basal insulin initiation until intensi-
fication, and the effect of covariates on time in poor glycaemic
control until intensification, adjusting for background covari-
ates. Index year was categorized into three subcohorts to assess
potential changes in prescribing habits over time. The covariates
included in both the analysis of the full cohort and the analy-
sis of the subcohorts in poor glycaemic control [recording of
HbA1c ≥ 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) after initiation of treatment with
basal insulin] were: age; duration of diabetes diagnosis at the
start of the cohort; body mass index (BMI); number of OHAs;
CCI score; gender; and index-year cohort for start of basal
insulin. To investigate whether HbA1c level had an effect on
the time to intensification, time-varying covariates for HbA1c
were included and served as a sensitivity analysis. Descriptive
statistics were used to capture event/censoring patterns and to
describe potential changes over time during follow-up. Patients
who did not intensify treatment were censored if HbA1c
dropped below 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) or, in the case of death,
transferring out of the practice or if there were missing data.

(a detailed overview of the exclusion criteria is provided
in Table S1). The baseline (start of basal insulin/index
date) characteristics for the total, intensified and censored
populations are shown in Table 1. Basal insulin was com-
menced in all patients at a mean ± standard deviation (s.d.)
HbA1c of 9.7 ± 2.0% (82 mmol/mol), with 80.3% of patients
being on ≥2 OHAs at commencement of insulin. Baseline
characteristics for patients clinically eligible for intensi-
fication [HbA1c >7.5% (58 mmol/mol)] are provided in
Table 2. The mean BMI ± s.d. at intensification, for patients
who intensified was 31.3 ± 6.6 kg/m2 (n = 1627) with bolus
insulin, 31.3 ± 6.2 kg/m2 (n = 1379) with premix insulin, and
38.6 ± 7.1 kg/m2 (n = 125) with GLP-1 RAs.
Time to Intensification: All Patients
The total time of exposure for all 11 696 patients was
24 561 patient-years and the totals for intensified and cen-
sored patients were 6493 and 18 122 patient-years, respectively.
Among all patients, 36.5% had their treatment intensified
during the observational period and 63.5% were censored.
Censoring was attributable to stopping basal insulin ther-
apy (63.4%) and reaching the end of follow-up (36.6%). The
median time from initiation of basal insulin to intensification
with bolus or premix insulin, or GLP-1, was 4.3 years (95%
CI 4.1, 4.6) for all patients, regardless of HbA1c level. The
estimated probability of having treatment intensified at end
of follow-up was 67.8% (data not shown). Age, duration of
diabetes, number of OHAs, CCI score, cohort year, baseline
HbA1c and BMI all had a significant association with the
time to intensification. Among the covariates included in the
Cox proportional hazards analysis, only gender had no effect.
Hazard ratios >1 indicated a shorter time to intensification,
while values <1 indicated a longer time (delay) in intensifica-
tion. Increasing age and duration of diabetes were associated
with a delay in intensification, whereas increasing BMI was
associated with a shorter time to intensification. For the CCI
score there was no difference across the categories. The results
for the number of OHAs were mixed, with any OHA use
being associated with a delay; however, those individuals on
≥2 OHAs had a slightly reduced delay compared with those
on one OHA. The index date subcohorts showed a successive
decrease in the time to intensification, with the delay being
shortest in the most recent cohort (1 January 2009 to 30 June
2011; Figure 1). Date of basal initiation did not affect time
to intensification (Table 3). Of all patients whose treatment
was intensified, 50.0 and 42.5% had treatment intensified with
bolus or premix insulin, respectively, and the treatment of
7.4% of individuals was intensified with GLP-1 RAs (data not
shown).
Time to Intensification for Clinically Eligible Patients: HbA1c
≥7.5%
The proportion of patients with HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol)
in the main cohort was 51.9% (n = 6072). Total years of expo-
sure were 9229 years. Among patients with HbA1c ≥7.5%
(58 mmol/mol), 30.9% of patients had their treatment inten-
sified. In this cohort, 69.1% of patients (n = 4193) were cen-
sored because: (i) HbA1c dropped below 7.5% (58 mmol/mol)
(30.2%) and remained there after the 6-month titration phase;
(ii) patients ended treatment with basal insulin (46.5%); or
(iii) end of follow-up was reached (23.3%). In patients who
underwent therapy intensification, the percentages of those

with HbA1c levels ≥7.5, 8.0 and 9.0% when intensifying were
96.1, 88.9 and 60.5%, respectively. The median time to inten-
sification with bolus or premix insulin or GLP-1 after the first
recording of HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) was 3.7 years (95%
CI 3.4; 4.0). The probability of having treatment intensified at
end of follow-up was 75.8% (Figure 2A). A sensitivity analy-
sis using an HbA1c of ≥8.0% (64 mmol/mol) showed a median
time to intensification of 3.2 years (95% CI 2.8, 3.5), showing
only a small reduction in the time to intensification between
these two thresholds (data not shown).
The time to intensification after the first recording of HbA1c
≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) was influenced by age, duration of dia-
betes, number of OHAs, CCI score and cohort index date.
Increasing age, duration of diabetes, OHA usage and CCI
score were associated with a longer delay in intensification.
Although the number of years’duration of diabetes had a sig-
nificant effect on time to intensification, there was no differ-
ence between the 2- to <5-year duration group and the 5-
to <10-year duration group. The longest delay was observed
in the group with >10 years’ diabetes duration. The most
recent subcohort index dates showed a trend for decreasing
time to intensification, although there was a slight increase
between the cohorts 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008
and 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2011 (Figure 2B); i.e. 46.9
and 43.1% of patients whose treatment was intensified were
intensified with bolus or premix insulin, respectively, and
10.0% of individuals were intensified with GLP-1 RAs (data
not shown). The mean ± s.d. HbA1c at the time of intensi-
fication was 9.3 ± 1.44% (n = 569), 9.6 ± 1.09% (n = 24) and
9.3 ± 1.78% (n = 75) for patients whose treatment was intensi-
fied with bolus insulin, premix insulin or GLP-1 RAs, respec-
tively. The date of basal initiation did not affect time to inten-
sification (Table 3). The mean ± s.d. first HbA1c measurement
taken 6–12 months after treatment intensification, for patients
continuing on treatment, was 8.4 ± 1.46%, 8.9 ± 1.35% and
8.2 ± 2.05% for bolus insulin, premix insulin or GLP-1, rep-
resenting respective decreases from baseline of −0.9 ± 1.52%,
−0.7 ± 1.79% and −1.2 ± 2.16% (data not shown).
Discussion
Using data from a nationally representative database, the results
of our analysis show for the first time that clinical inertia exists
among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin.
For patients clinically eligible for intensification of treatment
who were intensified, there was a median time of 3.7 years from
starting basal insulin until intensification, despite having an
HbA1c >7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Just over one-third of patients
had their treatment intensified. It should be noted that many
patients with HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) did not have their
treatment intensified at all and many stopped basal insulin
completely.
This delay in treatment intensification was more pronounced
among older people and those with a longer time since diagno-
sis. Those patients with poor glycaemic control with a higher
CCI score (more comorbidities) were also likely to wait longer
before having their treatment intensified. Multi-morbidity has
been shown to be a barrier to prescribing [28]. The higher

threshold of ≥8.0% (64 mmol/mol) showed a slight reduc-
tion in the time to intensification (3.2 years) compared with
≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and the covariate analyses showed that
there was a significant reduction in time to intensification with
increasing HbA1c level. One possible explanation for this is that
higher baseline HbA1c is responsible for the reduction in time
to intensification; this may be part of a planned, stepwise inten-
sification process by the treating physician.
Rather than treating to target, these intensification delays
suggest that many patients only have their treatment regimen
intensified once they have exceeded target HbA1c levels for an
extended duration, and some patients do not appear to have
their treatment intensified at all. The causes of these delays
are complex and include concerns among healthcare providers
regarding hypoglycaemia, weight gain and patient acceptance
[12,29,30]. These may, in part, be prudent decisions made by
physicians who wish to avoid the risk of hypoglycaemia among
people with diabetes who are perceived as frail, but equally
they may represent hesitation to reduce HbA1c in people with
diabetes who would benefit greatly from improved glycaemic
control [15].
Physicians adopting a patient-centred approach may also
treat patients differently based on their history of glycaemic
control. For example, a patient with HbA1c of 7.2% which,

over 2 years, crept above 7.5%, may be considered less in need
of treatment intensification than a patient who has never
achieved the target of <7.5%. Another reason for the delay
in intensification of insulin therapy could be that the delay in
moving people with diabetes from OHAs onto basal insulin
has a ripple effect, with patients being more progressed in
their disease, more frail, experiencing more complications, and
therefore being less able to tolerate further intensification [8].
There are also delays in intensification with basal insulin once
they have been initiated [31].
The fact that more patients had their treatment intensified
with bolus insulin or premix instead of GLP-1 RAs in the
present study probably reflects the recent introduction of
GLP-1 RAs during the study period. Secondly, initiation of
GLP-1 RAs may precede basal insulin. Although GLP-1 RAs
were not licensed for combination with basal insulin during
a significant proportion of the study period, results from
the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD)
exenatide audit indicate that the combination was being used
off-label [32]. It is conceivable, and indeed likely, that a larger
percentage of patients are currently having their treatment
intensified with GLP-1 RAs as these become more widely
adopted.
A large proportion of patients clinically eligible for inten-
sification stopped basal insulin altogether. The reasons for
stopping basal insulin are not reported in the CPRD but there
are several possible explanations. It could be that patient
non-adherence to the treatment regimen is a factor in both
the initial elevation of blood glucose concentrations and
subsequently stopping basal insulin. For example, the fear
of hypoglycaemia, inconvenience of self-injection/blood glu-
cose monitoring, concerns over weight gain, or simply the
patient not accepting the need for insulin could all lead to
omission of injections and non-adherence. This ‘
psychological
insulin resistance’is normally associated with the initiation of
insulin but may persist in patients who have commenced basal
insulin therapy [33]. Alternatively, the physician may deem
the patient to be too elderly or frail to derive sufficient benefit
from continued administration of basal insulin, and that the
risk of hypoglycaemia outweighs the benefit of a lower risk of
diabetes-related complications. It would be difficult to confirm
the reasons for stopping basal insulin using routine data.
Patient questionnaires or qualitative studies, similar to those
used to investigate the barriers to insulin initiation [34,35], are
urgently needed to uncover the causes.
The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax
and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) and
Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)
trials raised questions over the benefits of tight glucose control
in patients with type 2 diabetes [36]. In the ADVANCE study,
intensive glucose control did not change the incidence of
retinopathy or macrovascular outcomes, whilst in ACCORD,
intensive therapy produced mixed results [36]. By contrast,
results from the 10-year follow-up to the UK Prospective
Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have shown that there are long-term
benefits from improving glycaemic control that extend to a
reduction in cardiovascular diseases [6]. The disparity between
the benefit of intensive blood glucose control in the ADVANCE,
ACCORD and UKPDS trials may be partly explained by the
enrolment of older patient populations in ADVANCE and
ACCORD, where patients also had a longer duration of diag-
nosis. Furthermore, the studies were of shorter duration. This
supports the need to intensify blood glucose-lowering therapy
in a timely manner to ensure that the benefits of reduced blood
glucose are realized [6,8]. The duration of the present study was
not sufficient to assess whether failure to intensify treatment
leads to poorer clinical outcomes; however, the findings of the
UKPDS suggest that, particularly in younger patients, this is
likely to be the case [6].
The present study has several limitations. Notably, not
all people with diabetes had regular HbA1c measurements,
and BMI recordings were not available for some people with
diabetes. Insulin dose was not taken into account as this is
not recorded in the CPRD, yet an increase in basal insulin
dose should legitimately be considered an intensification
step. It may be that uptitration occurred very slowly in some
patients – ‘
titration inertia’– and exceeded the 6-month win-
dow allocated in the present study before recording time with
HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) [37]. Treatment adherence also
affected our analysis. Those people with diabetes who did not
adhere to treatment regimens were censored shortly after the
index date. The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)
points (the annual reward and incentive programme detailing
general practice achievement results) for individual practices
were not accounted for in our analysis [38]. This would have
provided deeper insight into the standard of care for people
with diabetes in the UK, and may have consequences for the
delay in intensification among those practices that score high
or low for diabetes care, but it is unlikely to have affected the
mean or median time to intensification because practices par-
ticipating in the CPRD are representative and most practices
already meet QOF targets. Additionally, QOF was introduced
in 2004, which makes it likely that most practices would have
been following QOF procedures during the study period.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine why such a
large proportion of patients clinically eligible for intensification
discontinued insulin. We speculate that these patients may have
been on very low doses of insulin; however, the focus of our
investigation is on the time to intensification – the reasons for
discontinuation should be the focus of a separate study.
The strengths of the present analysis include the large cohort
size, despite ineligibility as a result of selection criteria, and its
nationally representative make-up. This provides a clearer pic-
ture of clinical inertia in the UK than smaller studies would
be capable of providing. This study has also taken into account
many covariates, which improves the robustness of the analy-
sis. Our sensitivity analysis showed that duration of follow-up
did not affect the time to intensification in either the total or
clinically eligible populations.
In conclusion, the present study shows that there is a signif-
icant delay in the intensification of treatment in people with
type 2 diabetes with poor glycaemic control, and that many
patients do not have their treatment intensified at all. Clin-
ical inertia appears to exist at both the initiation and inten-
sification of insulin therapy [8]. This may have a negative
impact on the long-term outcomes for patients. More detailed

studies, perhaps using patient and physician questionnaires,
should attempt to establish the reasons for a delay in intensi-
fication, particularly among elderly people with diabetes and
those with comorbidities.
