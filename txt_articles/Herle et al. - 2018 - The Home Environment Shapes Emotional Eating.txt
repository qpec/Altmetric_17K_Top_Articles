Abstract 
Emotional overeating (EOE) is the tendency to eat more in response to negative 
emotions; its etiology in early life is unknown. We established the relative genetic and 
environmental influences on EOE in toddlerhood and early childhood. Data were from 
Gemini, a population-based cohort of 2402 British twins born in 2007. EOE was measured 
using the ‘emotional overeating’ scale of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire at 16 
months and 5 years. A longitudinal quantitative genetic model established that genetic 
influences on EOE were minimal; on the other hand, shared environmental influences 
explained most of the variance. EOE was moderately stable from 16 months to 5 years and 
continuing environmental factors shared by twin pairs at both ages explained the longitudinal 
association.

 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD

Emotional overeating (EOE) is the tendency to overeat in response to stress and negative 
emotions (Macht, 2008). It emerges early (Wardle, Guthrie, Sanderson, & Rapoport, 2001) 
and tracks moderately from early to late childhood [r=0.29]) (Ashcroft, Semmler, Carnell, 
van Jaarsveld, & Wardle, 2008). Understanding its etiology is important because it has been 
associated with excessive weight and weight gain in childhood (Braet & Van Strien, 1997; 
Parkinson, Drewett, Le Couteur, Adamson, & T, 2010; Steinsbekk & Wichstrom, 2015; 
Viana, Sinde, & Saxton, 2008), as well as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder  
(Pearson, Riley, Davis, & Smith, 2014). 
Two main theories have been formulated to explain the development of EOE.  The 
Psychosomatic Theory (Kaplan & Kaplan, 1957) proposes that obese individuals have not 
learned to distinguish successfully between the arousal caused by hunger and negative 
emotion; possibly because of classical conditioning in early life. This leads to increased food 
intake in response to negative feelings, and predisposes those individuals to weight gain 
(Bruch, 1964). This theory proposes that EOE is learned, rather than innate.  
The Internal/External theory (Schachter, Goldman, & Gordon, 1968) suggests a 
different basis for EOE. It proposes that healthy weight individuals tend to decrease their 
food intake in stressful situations, in response to internal physiological stress cues. On the 
other hand, obese individuals’ appetites are abnormal in not being affected by stress. The 
theory still predicts that obese individuals eat more than normal weight individuals during 
times of stress, but due to the inability to respond ‘normally’ to stress cues (van Strien & 
Ouwens, 2003). Such aberrations in biology could be innate or learned. There has been some 
support for both theories (Psychosomatic Theory: (Bongers, van den Akker, Havermans, & 
Jansen, 2015; Bruch, 1975; Heatherton, Striepe, & Wittenberg, 1998; Jansen, Havermans, & 
Nederkoorn, 2011) ; Internal/External theory: (Herman & Polivy, 1984; Schachter et al., 
1968; Willner, Muscat, & Papp, 1992). A potential mechanism through which children might

learn to overeat in response to negative emotions is classical conditioning. Parents who sooth 
their children’s negative emotions with food might inadvertently condition them to associate 
stress with food consumption or hunger, and in doing so establish maladaptive eating patterns 
at an early age. A recent experimental study of adults (n=127) supported this notion; pairing 
negative emotion  with highly palatable foods resulted in a greater desire to consume, which 
in turn might result in overeating (Bongers et al., 2015). 
Twin studies provide a powerful method for understanding the extent to which 
individual differences in a characteristic are determined by genetic and environmental 
variation. Importantly, twin analyses can also provide insight into the relative importance of 
two different types of environmental influence – aspects that are shared by two twins in a pair 
(shared environmental effects), and influences that are unique to each individual twin (unique 
environmental effects).  
Self-report psychometric questionnaires, such as the Three Eating Factor 
Questionnaire (TFEQ) (Stunkard & Messick, 1985) and the Dutch Eating Behavior 
Questionnaire (DEBQ) (Vanstrien, Frijters, Bergers, & Defares, 1986), are the most 
commonly used measures of EOE for adults. Both questionnaires measure a variety of eating 
behaviors and employ similar items to assess EOE (example items; TFEQ: ‘When I feel 
anxious, I find myself eating”; DEBQ: “Do you get the desire to eat when you are anxious, 
worried or tense?”). 
So far three adult studies (two using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire and one 
using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) have reported moderate additive genetic 
influences on EOE; explaining 45% of the variance in a UK sample (Sung, Lee, Song, Lee, & 
Lee, 2010), 31% in a Finnish sample (Keskitalo et al., 2008), and 45% in a Swedish sample 
(Tholin, Rasmussen, Tynelius, & Karlsson, 2005). In these adult samples the shared 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD

environment did not contribute to variation in EOE; instead, unique aspects of the 
environment (unshared between twin pairs) explained remaining variance.  
A recent study compared adult MZ twins raised together with MZ twins raised apart. 
Studies of twins reared apart rely on the assumption that MZ twins reared apart share only 
their genes; while MZ twins reared together share both their genes and many aspects of their 
environment. This assumption therefore makes it possible to directly estimate the 
contributions of genes and the shared environment by comparing the similarity of MZ twins 
reared together versus apart. This study confirmed the moderate influence of additive 
genetics on individual differences in EOE (55%); and, in keeping with the other twin studies, 
reported no influence of the shared environment (Elder et al., 2012). A caveat to this design is 
the potential influence of shared exposures in utero that contribute to twin similarity, prior to 
birth.   
Genetic and environmental sources of influence are known to vary considerably with 
age (Bergen, Gardner, & Kendler, 2007). EOE emerges early, and its etiology may differ 
considerably in childhood. The home family environment plays an important role for young 
children, raising the possibility that shared environmental effects on EOE might be observed 
in early childhood.  
Parents are presumed to be the most powerful socialization agents of young children’s 
eating behavior (Swinburn et al., 2011); but as children grow and mature, their eating is likely 
to be increasingly shaped by external factors. Longitudinal research suggesting that childhood 
bullying and peer influence increase the risk of obesity in adulthood, supports the increasing 
importance of peers in later childhood (Takizawa, Danese, Maughan, & Arseneault, 2015). 
Earlier in development, previous research has suggested that parents who use food to soothe 
elicit emotional eating behavior in their children (Braden et al., 2014). Further evidence for 
the importance of parental feeding comes from an experimental study (n=25 mother-child 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
6 
 
dyads) showing that children whose mothers use food to regulate emotions overconsume in 
the absence of hunger when induced with a negative mood (Blissett, Haycraft, & Farrow, 
2010). In addition, these maladaptive feeding practices have also been linked to maternal 
negative affect, posing a potential direct link between maternal affect, parental feeding 
behavior and the development of child EOE (Rodgers et al., 2014).  
 Hence establishing the relative influence of genes and environment in the 
development of EOE in early childhood and across different developmental stages is 
important because it can inform interventions aimed to reduce EOE later. If the home 
environment exerts an important influence on the development of children’s emotional eating 
(as opposed to genetic influence), targeting aspects of the home environment associated with 
EOE (e.g. emotional feeding) is warranted. So far no studies have established the relative 
influence of genes and environment in shaping EOE in children. 
This study uses prospective data from a large pediatric twin study, Gemini, to 
quantify the relative importance of genetic and environmental influences on EOE from 
toddlerhood to early childhood. The longitudinal design also allows us to establish if 
continuing genetic or environmental influences contribute to stability of EOE from 
toddlerhood to early childhood. We hypothesize that the shared environment plays a 
significant role in shaping EOE in childhood, in contrast to adult studies.   
Methods 
Participants 
All participants were drawn from Gemini (http://www.geministudy.co.uk/); a population-
based twin birth cohort set up in 2007 to investigate genetic and environmental influences on 
early growth (van Jaarsveld, Johnson, Llewellyn, & Wardle, 2010). Between March and 
December 2007 the Office for National Statistics wrote to all eligible families with twins 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
7 
 
born that year (N=6754) to ask for their consent to pass their contact details on to the Gemini 
researchers. 3435 families agreed to be contacted. 2402 families completed the baseline 
questionnaire; the baseline sample included 749 monozygotic pairs [MZs] and 1616 dizygotic 
pairs [DZs]; 37 pairs were of unknown zygosity.  
Follow-up questionnaires were sent to families when children were 16 months and 5 
years old. Gemini is generally representative of UK twins when compared with national twin 
statistics on zygosity and sex, gestational age at birth and birth weight.  Ethical approval was 
granted by the University College London Committee for the Ethics of non–National Health 
Service Human Research, and all aspects of data collection and storage were in accordance 
with the standards stipulated by this body. 
Measurement of emotional overeating 
EOE was measured using the ‘emotional overeating’ scale of the parent-reported Child 
Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ); (Wardle et al., 2001). The CEBQ is a parent 
reported questionnaire which consists of 35 items that describe a range of children’s eating 
behaviors. The questionnaire was developed to quantify child eating behaviors hypothesized 
to relate to weight and weight gain in childhood. Parents rate how much the statements apply 
to their children on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from “Never” to “Always”). 
The EOE (4 items) scale has high internal reliability (� = 0.72 - 0.79) and scores correlate 
moderately over a two-week period (r = 0.52) (Wardle et al., 2001). 
The CEBQ has been validated using behavioral measures of eating behavior in children aged 
4-5 years (Carnell & Wardle, 2007). Parents completed the EOE scale when twins were on 
average 16 months old and 5 years old. At 5 years, parents responded to four statements from 
the standard EOE scale about their child’s tendency to eat in response to negative emotions 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
8 
 
(“My child eats more when worried”, “My child eats more when annoyed”, “My child eats 
more when anxious”, and “My child eats more when s/he has nothing else to do”). 
Following in-depth qualitative pilot work with a sample of mothers with 18-month old 
toddlers, the emotion adjectives from the standard EOE scale were modified for the 16-month 
questionnaire to ensure that they were age-appropriate (‘irritable’ instead of ‘worried’; 
‘grumpy’ instead of ‘annoyed’; ‘upset’ instead of ‘anxious’). The fourth item from the 
standard EOE scale (“My child eats more when s/he has nothing else to do”) was not 
included in the 16-month questionnaire because mothers had not observed this behavior in 
their children at this young age. This item was therefore omitted from the 5-year scale as well 
to ensure consistency of items across the two ages. Parents responded to the items using a 5-
point Likert scale (‘never’; ‘rarely’; ’sometimes’; ’often’; ‘always’). Means were calculated 
for each child for EOE at both ages; scores were only included if a minimum of 2 out of 3 
items were completed. The internal consistency for the EOE scale in this sample at 16 months 
was � = 0.82; and at 5 years was � = 0.81.  
Zygosity, age and gestational age 
Gestational age was reported by parents. Information on weight at birth was taken from the 
child’s personal health record and reported by parents. Age of the child at EOE measurement 
was calculated from their date of birth and the date of questionnaire completion. Opposite sex 
twin pairs were classified as DZ. Parents of same sex twins completed a 20-item 
questionnaire to establish their zygosity. The questionnaire has been validated against DNA 
markers, showing agreement for 95% of cases; and the questionnaire is consistent over time, 
with 96% rating the same zygosity status at 3 years (Price et al., 2000).   
Gemini is an inclusive population-based cohort and all families with twins were invited to 
participate regardless of   health problems, disorders or birth complications. Additional 
sensitivity analyses were conducted excluding twins with a reported chromosomal disorder 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD

(n=20), as well as twins born earlier than 34 weeks gestation (n=262). Children born before 
34 weeks are likely to be tube-fed which can affect their feeding development, and has the 
potential to impact their eating behavior in toddlerhood and early childhood. The results from 
the full sample did not differ from the reduced sample, so the full sample was therefore used. 
Statistical analyses 
Because twins share their age and gestational age exactly (and sex for same-sex 
pairs), regress scores on gestational age, age at the time of measurement, and sex prior to 
heritability analyses to ensure these factors do not inflate the shared environmental effect. All 
twin analyses were performed on the regressed EOE scores.   Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient was used to establish the association between EOE at 16 months and 5 years. 
Twin analyses  
The basis of the twin method is to compare resemblance between identical twins 
(monozygotics, MZ) who share 100% of their genes, with that between non-identical twins 
(dizygotics, DZs) who share approximately 50% of their segregating genes. Because both 
types of twins are assumed to share their environments to a similar extent, difference in 
resemblance between the two types of twins reflects genetic contributions to the trait. If there 
is little difference in resemblance, common environments shared by twin pairs can be 
assumed to be largely responsible for individual differences in that trait. The extent to which 
identical twins differ is due to unique environmental influences not shared by twin pairs (and 
measurement error) (Rijsdijk & Sham, 2002). Genetic and environmental contributions to 
variation in EOE are estimated using two methods: comparisons of twin correlations and 
maximum likelihood structural equation modelling (MLSEM).

Twin correlations 
Correlations of twins for EOE were calculated and compared for MZs and DZs at 16 
months and at 5 years. Twin correlations were calculated using ratings of EOE for each twin 
to assess the similarity within twin pairs. The pattern of resemblance provides an indication 
of the relative importance of genetic and environmental influences on EOE at each age. 
Cross-twin cross-time (CT-CT) correlations provide an indication of the contribution of 
continuing genetic and environmental influences to the longitudinal phenotypic association 
(the stability of EOE from 16 months to 5 years). CT-CT correlations use the same principles 
as the twin correlations explained above; but instead of correlating the twin pair for EOE at 
the same age, CT-CT correlations relate twin 1’s EOE score at 16 months to twin 2’s EOE 
score at 5 years, and vice versa. 
Higher average CT-CT correlations for MZ pairs relative to DZ pairs indicates that 
common genetic factors at both ages contribute to the phenotypic association; similar CT-CT 
correlations for both types of twins indicates that common shared environmental effects at 
both ages are important in driving the phenotypic association. Twin correlations and CT-CT 
correlations were calculated using OpenMx Software (Boker et al., 2011); a package 
designed to use in R (R Core Team, 2015). OpenMx provides one average CT-CT correlation 
for MZ and DZ twin pairs separately, as it deems twin order to be irrelevant.  
 
Maximum likelihood structural equation modelling 
Maximum Likelihood structural equation modelling (MLSEM) was used to provide 
reliable parameter estimates of additive genetic effects (A), shared environmental effects (C) 
and unique environmental effects (E) with 95% confidence intervals and goodness-of-fit 
statistics. A bivariate longitudinal model was run providing estimates of A, C and E at 16 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
11 
 
months and 5 years as well as information about the extent to which the genetic, shared 
environmental and unique environmental influences underlying EOE at 16 months were the 
same as those at 5 years, denoted by the additive genetic [rA], shared environmental [rC], and 
unique environmental [rE] correlations. A high rA would indicate that the majority of the 
additive genetic effects at 16 months persist at 5 years, whereas a low rA would indicate that 
additive genetic factors are largely unique to each age. The longitudinal model also quantifies 
the extent to which continuing genetic and environmental influences explain the longitudinal 
phenotypic correlation from 16 months to 5 years (denoted as bivariate A, C and E). That is, 
the bivariate estimates explain whether stability in EOE from 16 months to 5 years is largely 
due to the same genes or the same environmental factors influencing the trait at both ages. 
The bivariate estimates are calculated by dividing the covariance of the latent factors (A, C 
and E) by the phenotypic correlation of between the two variables. Bivariate estimates and 
etiological correlations are independent of the univariate A, C, and E contributions at 16 
months and 5 years. For example, EOE could be highly heritable at both ages and correlated 
over time, but with few genetic effects in common at either age (low rA), and the longitudinal 
association being driven entirely by shared environmental effects (low bivariate A; high 
bivariate C) (Posthuma et al., 2003). MLSEM was carried out using OpenMx software 
(Boker et al., 2011). A number of fit statistics were available, including the Likelihood Ratio 
test (LRT), Aikaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion 
(BIC). As all models are nested, the LRT can be used for model identification. The BIC 
statistic was also taken into consideration because it takes account of sample size and number 
of parameters, and is therefore more appropriate than the overly conservative LRT and AIC 
in the context of large datasets like Gemini (Posada & Buckley, 2004; Trudeau, Shephard, 
Bouchard, & Laurencelle, 2003).

First a saturated model was fitted to the data, with no parameter constraints (i.e. 
estimating only means, variances and covariances for MZs and DZs), to provide fit statistics 
against which to test the goodness of fit of the ACE model. Then a full ACE model was 
fitted. For the univariate analyses more parsimonious sub-models were then tested for 
goodness-of-fit against the full ACE model; sub-models dropped A, C, and A and C together 
(E is never dropped because it includes measurement error). For longitudinal analyses, a full 
ACE model was fitted first and compared to a saturated model for goodness-of-fit. Non-
significant parameters were then dropped to identify the most parsimonious model. LRT and 
the lowest BIC value indicate the best fitting model.   
Results 
EOE scores were available for 3774 children at 16 months and 1986 children at 5 years, with 
a combined sample for the analysis of 3784 children who had data at either 16 months, 5 
years or both ages (MLSEM is able to include participants who have missing data at one time 
point).  The descriptive statistics for the analysis sample are shown in Table 1. The children 
included in these analyses did not differ from the full sample in terms of zygosity, sex, 
gestational age or birth weight. Twin pairs with unknown zygosity were excluded from the 
analyses (n= 37). EOE at 16 months was significantly associated with EOE at 5 years of age  
(r=0.25, 95% CI [0.19, 0.30]; p<0.001), such that toddlers who were prone to eating more in 
response to negative emotions tended to do this as children as well.  
There were some differences between families who remained in the study at 5 years and 
those who did not. Mothers of children in the 5 year sample were more educated, older and 
had a lower BMI at baseline, than at 16 months. However there were no differences between 
the samples in relation to the sex and gestational age of the twins.

Twin Analyses 
The intraclass correlations for the twin pairs at 16 months and 5 years are shown in Table 2. 
At both ages the MZ and DZ correlations were high and similar for both types of twins. This 
suggested a low contribution from genes and a strong contribution from the shared 
environment to variation in EOE. 
Before running the longitudinal twin model, sex limitation models were conducted to 
test for differences between boys and girls. Sex limitation models allow for separate estimates 
of A, C and E for males and females. These can then be compared to models equating the 
estimates across the sexes. The LRT suggested that models assuming separate paths for males 
and females provided a better fit at 16 months and five years. However, the A, C and E 
estimates for both and girls were not significantly different. Therefore, for the purposes of 
simplicity and accessibility, a model that included both boys and girls together is presented in 
this paper. However, fit statistics and parameter estimates for the sex limitation models can 
be found in Appendix 1. 
Longitudinal analyses 
The averaged CT-CT correlations for the MZs and DZs demonstrated similar patterns to the 
simple ICCs (Table 2). This suggested that continuing shared environmental influences 
largely explained the correlation from 16 months to 5 years, and that there were few 
continuing genetic influences that contributed to stability in EOE from toddlerhood to early 
childhood.  
MLSEM was used to calculate the univariate estimates for 16 months and 5 years (Figure 1). 
Additive genetic effects were significant at 16 months and 5 years (10% and 4% 
respectively). The majority of variance in EOE was explained by shared environmental 
effects (87% and 93% at 16 months and 5 years respectively). The variance explained by the 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
14 
 
unique environment at each age was small (3% and 3% at 16 months and 5 years 
respectively).  
A path diagram of the full longitudinal ACE model is presented in Figure 1. LRT 
= 13.218, p=0.72).  A moderate shared environmental correlation (rC=0.27) between 16 
months and 5 years indicated that even though continuing aspects of the shared environment 
account for the stability of EOE, many new shared environmental influences come into play 
at five years. There was also a significant negative genetic correlation between the two time 
points (rA= -0.26; 95% CI [-0.45, -0.08]). However, because the genetic components of 
variance at both ages were very small (especially at age 5 years, 4%), the genetic correlation 
is unreliable and difficult to interpret. The unique environmental correlation was non-
significant (rE = 0.03; 95% CI [-0.11, - 0.17]), indicating that none of the unique 
environmental effects that influenced EOE continued to influence EOE at 5 years of age. 
The bivariate estimates quantified the contribution of common genetic and 
environmental factors to the longitudinal association between EOE at 16 months and 5 years 
of age. These suggested that the longitudinal association was completely driven by shared 
environmental effects (Bivariate C:  1.07; 95% CI [1.03, 1.11]). The bivariate A was very 
small (Bivariate A: -0.07; 95% CI [-0.12, -0.02]) and bivariate E was non-significant 
(Bivariate E:  0.00; 95% CI [-0.01, 0.02]). These results made sense in the light of the fact 
that shared environmental factors were largely driving variation in EOE at both ages. 
To find the most parsimonious solution, parameters were constrained to be zero. In 
submodel 1 bivariate estimates for E were dropped, as they were found to be non-significant 
(BivE: 0.00; 95% CI [-0.01, 0.02]). Additionally in submodel 2, bivariate estimates for A 
were also dropped (Bivariate A: -0.07; 95% CI [-0.12, -0.02]). However the paths indicating 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
15 
 
variance explained by the latent factor E at 16 month and 5 years individually remained as 
they cannot be removed because they include random measurement error. When comparing 
the fit of the submodels with the full ACE model, the LRT suggested a significant 
deterioration of fit. However, due to the large sample size, the LRT can be oversensitive, 
detecting small changes in fit as significantly different. The BIC, that takes account of the 
sample size (as well as the number of parameters), suggested that submodel 2 was the best 
fitting model, because it produced the lowest BIC score (BIC=-16939.898). However the 
change in BIC (� BIC=1.503) between the models was less than 2, indicating that the 
difference was too small to discriminate meaningfully between the models.  BIC difference 
guidelines indicate that a difference of > 2 is considered suggestive of a better model fit 
(Trudeau et al., 2003). The full ACE longitudinal model is therefore presented as the best-
fitting model.  A full list of all estimates and fit statistics is presented in Table 4. 
 
Discussion 
This is the first childhood study to investigate genetic and environmental contributions to the 
development of EOE, tracking children from toddlerhood (16 months) to early childhood (5 
years). The results were in line with the hypothesis of a substantial effect of the shared 
environment on EOE in early life. However, it was somewhat surprising to observe that 
additive genetic effects contributed so little to this trait at either age (10 % and 4% 
respectively at 16 months and 5 years). These findings contrast with the high heritability 
estimates observed for other eating behaviours – Satiety Responsiveness (SR) (63%) and 
Enjoyment of Food (EF) (75%) – measured in 10 year-old children (Carnell, Haworth, 
Plomin, & Wardle, 2008). They also contrast with the high heritability estimates for four 
eating behaviours measured in Gemini at 3 months of age: Satiety Responsiveness (72%);

Slowness of Eating (84%); Food Responsiveness (59%); Enjoyment of food (54%) 
(Llewellyn, van Jaarsveld, Johnson, Carnell, & Wardle, 2010).

differences in this trait during both toddlerhood (88%) and early childhood (93%) also 
contrasts with previous studies of EOE in adults. These studies found no role of the shared 
environment, and a moderate contribution from genetic influences (Keskitalo et al., 2008; 
Sung et al., 2010; Tholin et al., 2005). However, heritability estimates are known to vary, 
particularly by age, and previous studies of EOE have only used adult samples. In order for 
genetic influences to play out, individuals need the agency to make independent choices in 
order to ‘act out’ their genetic predispositions. The young age of the sample could therefore 
explain the high impact of shared environments, as toddlers and children have limited access 
to food to regulate their emotions as they choose. Future studies could follow children into 
adolescence to investigate if genetic influences start to emerge as children gain the 
independence to act in line with their genetically predisposed traits (a phenomenon termed 
‘active gene-environment correlation’) (Bergen et al., 2007).  
A ‘passive gene-environment correlation’ might also explain the high shared 
environmental effects on variation in EOE; this refers to the ‘double whammy’ of a child 
inheriting both genes and environment related to their parents’ and their own genetically-
determined trait. For example, it seems likely that parents, who emotionally overeat, partly by 
virtue of their genetic predisposition, create an environment that nurtures this behavior in 
their children; children therefore inherit from their parents both the genes and the 
environment that encourage EOE. Passive gene-environment correlations serve to inflate 
shared environmental effects (Rijsdijk & Sham, 2002). One way to test for passive gene-
environment correlation is to use an adoption study design, comparing the correlations 
between a measure of the family environment (e.g. emotional feeding) and child measures of 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
17 
 
EOE in adoptive and non-adoptive families. Higher correlations in non-adoptive families 
would indicate a passive gene-environment correlation, as biological parents pass on their 
genetic material as well as create the family environment (Rijsdijk & Sham, 2002). 
On the whole, it is perhaps unsurprising that for young children the shared 
environment plays an important role in shaping the development of this behavior as parents 
have been shown to be the most important socialization agents of young children’s eating 
behavior (Swinburn et al., 2011), affecting their eating through parenting styles and feeding 
practices (Zlatevska, Dubelaar, & Holden, 2014), modeling eating behavior (Brownson, 
Boehmer, & Luke, 2005) and being the main gatekeepers of food (Piernas & Popkin, 2011).   
We observed that EOE in toddlerhood correlated positively and moderately with EOE 
in childhood (r=0.25); and the longitudinal association could be explained largely by 
continuing shared environmental influences from toddlerhood to early childhood.  However 
the moderate shared environmental correlation (rC=0.27) indicated that many novel shared 
environmental factors influence EOE at five years. There were no unique environmental 
effects that continued from toddlerhood to early childhood. There was a significant genetic 
correlation (rA), but due to the very small contribution of additive genetic effects on EOE at 
either age, this correlation is difficult to interpret. In addition, model fit statistics tentatively 
suggested a slightly better solution for a model excluding bivariate estimates of additive 
genetic effects (A) and unique environmental effects (E), highlighting the importance of 
shared environmental contributions to the longitudinal stability of EOE.   
Implications  
In comparison to previous cross sectional studies of adults, we report estimates for genetic 
and environmental influences on EOE at two different assessment points during childhood. 
The observation that the shared environment played the most important role in shaping EOE 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
18 
 
in early childhood suggests that many of the early influences on EOE will be modifiable, in 
contrast to genetic influence that can be harder to change. This finding provides hope that it 
will be possible to develop interventions to prevent or reduce the development of EOE in 
childhood. Because EOE is associated with both obesity and eating disorders such 
interventions are needed.  
While twin studies provide important insights into the relative importance of genetic 
and environmental influences on given characteristics, no information about the specific 
factors involved is given. Future research is needed to establish the modifiable shared 
environmental factors that play a causal role in shaping EOE in early childhood. Some 
evidence has suggested that parental feeding practices influence children’s EOE. A recent 
study measuring parental feeding practices and children’s eating behaviors in a longitudinal 
cohort of Norwegian families (N=797, age 6 and 8 years) found  instrumental feeding 
practices (i.e. using food as a reward) at age 6 predicted increased emotional overeating at 
age 8 (Steinsbekk, Belsky, & Wichstrom, 2016). Similarly, further research has established 
that children whose parents actively control their emotions through feeding engage more in 
EOE (Braden et al., 2014; Tan & Holub, 2015). In addition, children whose parents highly 
control their food intake express more EOE behaviors (Farrow, Haycraft, & Blissett, 2015).  
However, there is evidence indicating that child emotional eating elicits parental 
controlling feeding behavior (such as monitoring, restriction and pressure to eat), suggesting 
a potential bidirectional association between child eating and parental feeding (Haycraft & 
Blissett, 2012). Although, results from a larger observational study did not confirm that child 
eating at 6 years  predicted parental feeding at 8 years (Steinsbekk et al., 2016). 
Because EOE is linked to emotional dysregulation (Elks et al., 2012), focusing on 
parental efforts to promote emotion regulation (i.e. not using food to sooth negative 
emotions) in their offspring might be valuable. Lastly, a stressful and chaotic home 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
19 
 
environment has been associated with childhood obesity, potentially because it provides the 
environment in which a child would be more likely to learn to emotionally overeat 
(Gundersen, Mahatmya, Garasky, & Lohman, 2011; Wardle & Boniface, 2008).  Notably 
though, studies are needed to test the assumption that stressful environments directly increase 
the risk of developing EOE. In addition to purely environmental studies, future research is 
needed to understand how environmental exposures potentially modify the expression of 
genes involved in EOE, through epigenetic processes. Twin studies and epigenetic research 
have the potential to complement one another and elucidate how genes and environments 
interact in the development of complex human traits in early life. A particularly powerful 
design is to compare the epigenetic profiles of identical twins discordant for an 
environmental exposure (Bell & Spector, 2011); this is because identical twins are genetically 
the same. 
Overall, the high influence of the shared environment supports early theory 
(Psychosomatic Theory and Internal/External Theory) suggesting that EOE is largely learned 
in early life. 
Limitations 
Twin studies assume that MZ and DZ twins share their environments to the same extent (so-
called the ‘equal environments assumption’) (Rijsdijk & Sham, 2002). A recent analysis of 
past twin research testing for violation of the ‘equal environments assumption’ concluded that 
in the majority of studies reviewed no violations of the assumption occurred (Felson, 2014). 
Another limitation of the study is that due to the longitudinal nature of the study some 
families drop out over time. There were some differences between the families who did not 
provide follow up data at five years, and those who did. Mothers of families who remained in 
the study were more educated, older and had a lower BMI at baseline. However there were no 
differences regarding sex and gestational age of the twins. Children of mothers who are more 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
20 
 
educated and healthier might be less likely to emotionally overeat themselves, or less likely 
to emotionally feed their children. This could explain the slightly reduced mean and variance 
of EOE when the children were five years old. 
The CEBQ is parent-reported and biases are therefore possible. For example, some of 
the shared environmental effect may reflect a parent’s own tendency to emotionally overeat 
insofar as parents who tend to do this may assume that both of their children do this as well. 
On the other hand, parents may find it difficult to observe this behavior with accuracy in 
young children, and therefore rate two twins the same.  However, parents are well placed to 
report on their children’s eating behavior, arguably knowing their children better than other 
potential respondents. In addition, a range of other parent-reported eating behaviors showed 
high heritability in this sample during infancy; suggesting that parents are indeed able to 
observe differences between their twins for a range other eating behaviors, adding confidence 
to these findings (Llewellyn et al., 2010). Nevertheless, it would be useful to collect 
information from other raters in future studies (e.g. childcare providers), to compare with 
parental reports. Additional laboratory-based studies to validate the EOE subscale would be 
useful. However, exposing children to stress to observe their subsequent consumption 
behavior poses practical and ethical difficulties. Furthermore, twin analyses require large 
numbers of participants, and a psychometric questionnaire, like the CEBQ, therefore remains 
the only option to measure behavior in large cohorts like Gemini. 
 
 
Conclusion 
Variation in EOE during toddlerhood and early childhood is largely influenced by 
environmental factors shared by both twins in a family. In contrast to most other eating 
 GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EMOTIONAL OVEREATING IN CHILDHOOD 
 
21 
 
behaviors that have been explored in infancy and childhood, additive genetic effects play a 
minor role. Future studies are needed to identify the actual environmental factors influencing 
the development of EOE during the early years, and to elucidate when genetic influences 
emerge. Modifiable shared environmental factors that promote EOE need to be identified so 
that they can be targeted in interventions aimed to reduce the development EOE in childhood.

Table 4 shows fit statistics for the longitudinal analyses of EOE measured at 16 months and 5 
years. The BIC and �BIC was used to identify the best fitting model. More parsimonious 
submodels with a lower BIC value compared to the full ACE model, and with a BIC change of 
at least 2 compared to the full ACE model, are preferred (Trudeau et al., 2003). Submodel 2 
had a lower BIC value than the full ACE model, but the change in BIC was not sufficient to 
select it over the full ACE model (� = -1.503).

2 Submodel 1: In this submodel genetic covariation between EOE at 16 months and 5 years was 
constrained to 0 (i.e. Bivariate A and the additive genetic correlation (rA) were dropped). 
Submodel 1 is nested in and compared against the full ACE model.

3 Submodel 2: In this Submodel both genetic covariation and unique environmental 
covariation between EOE at 16 months and 5 years were constrained to 0 (i.e. Bivariate A, 
Bivariate  E, the additive genetic correlation (rA) and the non-shared environmental 
correlation (rE) were dropped). Submodel 2 is nested in and compared against the full ACE 
model.

Figure 1 shows the full longitudinal model including all parameters. The rectangular boxes 
represent the measured phenotype (EOE) using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire at 
16 months and 5 years. The circles indicate the latent factors of additive genetic effects (A), 
shared environmental effects (C) and non-shared environmental effects (E). The straight 
single-headed arrows reflect casual pathways with the variance explained by each latent 
factor (including 95% confidence intervals). The etiological correlations are shown on the 
curved double-headed arrows. These indicate the proportion of genetic (rA), shared 
environmental (rC) and unique environmental (rE) influences that are common across the two 
ages. The non-significant etiological correlation (rE), with a 95% Confidence Interval 
crossing 0, is represented as a dotted line. Bivariate estimates (not shown on the path 
diagram) quantify the proportion of the longitudinal association (r=0.25, p<0.001)
