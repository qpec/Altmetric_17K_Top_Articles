Abstract 
Background: Chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration represents a major social and economic burden 
worldwide. The current standard of care is limited to symptomatic relief and no current approved therapy promotes 
disc regeneration. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are easily accessible and well characterized. 
These MSCs are multipotent and exhibit great tissue regenerative potential including bone, cartilage, and fibrous tis-
sue regeneration. The use of this cell-based biologic for treating protruding disc herniation and/or intervertebral disc 
degeneration is a promising therapeutic strategy, due to their known regenerative, immuno-modulatory and anti-
inflammatory properties.
Methods: Five patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease received an intra-discal injection of autologous, 
hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (15.1–51.6 million cells) as part of a previous study. 
These patients were re-consented to participate in this study in order to assess long-term safety and feasibility of 
intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 4–6 years post 
mesenchymal stem cell infusion. The follow-up study consisted of a physical examination, a low back MRI, and a qual-
ity of life questionnaire.
Results: Patients’ lower back MRI showed absence of neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding the treated region. 
Based on the physical examination and the quality of life questionnaire, no adverse events were reported due to the 
procedure or to the stem cell treatment 4–6 years post autologous, hypoxic cultured mesenchymal stem cell infusion. 
All patients self-reported overall improvement, as well as improvement in strength, post stem cell treatment, and four 
out of five patients reported improvement in mobility.
Conclusion: This early human clinical data suggests the safety and feasibility of the clinical use of hypoxic cultured 
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of lower back pain due to degenerative disc dis-
orders and support further studies utilizing hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived stem cells. The overall improve-
ments reported are encouraging, but a larger double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical study with significant 
number of patients and implementation of validated endpoint measurements are next steps in order to demonstrate 
efficacy of this cell-based biologic.

Background
Chronic low back pain affects approximately 632 million 
people worldwide and has an enormous social impact on 
patients and a significant economic impact on health-
care budgets [1]. In the United States alone, the annual 
cost is estimated to be as high as 500 billion dollars [2, 
3]. The exact causes of disc degeneration are complex 
and involve genetic risks, smoking, obesity, aging and 
mechanical trauma [4]. The intervertebral disc is an 
immune-privileged avascular organ composed of fibro-
cartilaginous tissues that connect the vertebral bodies 
and provide stability, while allowing motion between the 
vertebrae [5, 6]. The centrally located nucleus pulposus is 
a hypoxic, hydrophilic proteoglycan-rich gelatinous core, 
surrounded by a lamellated collagenous ring, the annulus 
fibrosus and bony end-plates that separate the discs from 
the vertebrae [4, 7]. In a normal disc, there is a balance 
between the anabolic and catabolic capacity of the disc 
cells, but excessive stress can alter this balance and com-
promise extracellular matrix degradation and synthesis 
thereby initiating a degenerative cascade [8]. A loss in the 
cellular component function induces alterations in both 
the cartilaginous and proteoglycan matrix of the disc [4, 
9, 10]. Subsequently, alterations of the proteoglycan com-
ponent ultimately leads to dehydration of the nucleus 
pulposus, which impacts the ability of the disc to effec-
tively distribute and recover from mechanical loading. 
The degenerated disc may eventually weaken to develop 
a protrusion towards the spine that puts pressure on the 
nerve roots or parts of the spinal canal, causing back pain 
and possibly weakness and numbness.
The standard of care for treating disc degeneration 
involves conservative non-surgical approaches or sur-
gical interventions that target symptomatic relief and 
musculoskeletal stabilization. Currently, there is no clini-
cal therapy targeting the reversal of disc degeneration or 
that addresses intervertebral disc cell homeostasis [11, 
12]. The regenerative medicine field using cell-based 
therapies and biologics has advanced significantly over 
the past decade with numerous clinical trials aiming at 
providing treatments for neurodegenerative, orthopedic 
and cardiovascular disorders [11, 13–15]. Mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are stem cells that have extensive pro-
liferative capacity and multi-lineage potential. They arise 
from progenitor cell reservoirs and have been isolated 
from various tissues, including bone marrow [16], mus-
cle [17], and adipose tissue [18, 19]. MSCs isolated from 
various tissues share common characteristics, including 
the ability to: (1) form fibroblastic like colonies; (2) pro-
liferate extensively; (3) be directionally differentiated 
into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes; and (4) 
express several common cell surface markers. In addi-
tion, they possess immunomodulatory properties [20, 21] 
and have the ability to secrete a variety of cell mediators 
that aid in cellular repair and homeostasis.
The ideal treatment for degenerative disc disease (DDD) 
would be to conserve the physiologic function of interver-
tebral discs and reverse the degenerative cascade. The 
potential for stem cell-based therapy to treat disc degen-
eration is to repopulate the disc with viable cells capable 
of producing extracellular matrix, restoring damaged tis-
sue and enhance tissue regeneration by the secretion of 
growth factors to modulate the inflammatory response.
In this short report, we studied the long-term safety 
and feasibility (n = 5) of intra-discal injection of autol-
ogous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived mesen-
chymal stem cells for the treatment of chronic lumbar 
radiculopathy.
Rational for hypoxic cell therapy
The intervertebral disc is the largest avascular tissue in 
the human body, with oxygen gradients ranging between 
1 and 5 % [22]. Nutrients such as glucose and oxygen 
diffuse from the capillaries across the cartilaginous end-
plate and through the dense disc matrix to the cells. Dur-
ing disc degeneration, structural changes and vascular 
depletion reduce oxygen diffusion thus oxygen concen-
tration lowers, resulting in further extracellular matrix 
degradation, ultimately causing a vicious cycle of disc 
degeneration.
Several studies suggested that hypoxic pre-conditioning 
has beneficial biological effects that can impact the thera-
peutic activity of MSCs in the disc. Hypoxic culture has 
been demonstrated to upregulate chondrocyte specific 
genes such as aggrecan, collagen type II and Sox-9 [23], 
upregulate the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α 
(HIF-1α), increasing the anti-apoptotic capabilities of 
MSCs [24–26] and activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK), 
which increases migration and homing [27]. In addition, 
MSCs cultured from older patients under hypoxia dem-
onstrated enhanced self-renewal and proliferation capac-
ity compared to cultures under normoxic conditions [28]. 
Hypoxic culturing of MSCs produces many desirable bio-
logical effects that may impact the therapeutic activity of 
the MSCs post-transplant into the limited nutrient, low 
oxygen tension microenvironment of the degenerative disc.

Methods
Study overview
The five patients described in this study where diagnosed 
with lumbar degenerative disc disease associated with 
protruding discs. Thirty-eight subjects were screened, 
seven patients were enrolled in the study and 5 patients 
completed the study. These patients, in procedures 
performed in the United States, received autologous, 
hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal 
stem cells under IRB protocol (IRB protocol# 00002637) 
between 2009 and 2010. All of these patients had 
failed lower back pain standard of care and pain man-
agement including oral medication, physical therapy, 
fluoroscopically-guided epidural steroid injections, and 
activity modification. Four to six years post-cell trans-
plant (Table 1), these patients were re-consented to par-
ticipate in this study under IRB protocol (IRB protocol 
#1140608) in order to evaluate long-term safety and fea-
sibility of intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic 
cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. 
This study included a follow-up examination consisting 
of a physical examination, the completion of a quality of 
life questionnaire, and a spine MRI performed and inter-
preted by an independent radiology group (Table 2). 
Patients’ inclusion and exclusion criteria

Isolation and hypoxic culture of autologous, bone 
marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem cells
Bone marrow was harvested from each patient, as previ-
ously described [29]. Briefly, patients were placed in the 
prone position and 30 mL of bone marrow was harvested 
from each side of the posterior superior iliac spine area. 
The bone marrow aspirate was then centrifuged at 200×g 
for 6 min. The mononuclear cell layer was isolated and 
washed by centrifugation using phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS). Nucleated cells were plated into tissue culture 
flasks at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 and cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10 % 
platelet lysate, 5 μg/mL doxycycline, and 2 IU/mL hepa-
rin in a 37 °C/5 % CO2/5 % O2 incubator. Mesenchymal 
stem cells were expanded under hypoxic conditions and 
prepared for injection.
Injection of hypoxic cultured autologous, bone marrow 
derived mesenchymal stem cells
On the day of injection, hypoxic expanded mesenchy-
mal stem cells were harvested, washed and re-suspended 
in autologous platelet lysate at a final volume ranging 
between 0.25 and 1 mL. Under c-arm fluoroscopic guid-
ance, a 22 gauge spinal needle was placed over the infe-
rior articular process of the targeted spinal level to enter 
the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc. The needle 
tip was then positioned on biplanar fluoroscopy in the 
middle of the nucleus pulposus (NP). A small amount of 
contrast was injected into the NP to demonstrate a nucle-
ogram and filling of the annular fissure, followed by the 
intra-discal injection of the mesenchymal stem cells at 
the indicated cell quantity (Table 1).
Results
Below are individual case reports on the five patients 
included in the study. Summarized details of the patients 
and treatments are provided in Table 1. Overall safety 
evaluations performed are depicted in Table 2. Summa-
rized data from the quality of life questionnaire are pro-
vided in Table 3. Patient MRIs pre- and post-intra-discal 
injection, are presented in Fig. 1 and a scatter plot show-
ing overall improvement versus number of hypoxic cul-
tured MSCs injected, is presented in Fig. 2.  
Patient 1
The patient is a 53-year-old female diagnosed with 
left thoracic outlet syndrome post trauma leading to 
chronic cervical and left arm pain. Patient also pre-
sented chronic lower back pain radiating into her leg on 
the left side extending down to the level of the knee. In 
March 2008, a pre-stem cell treatment baseline MRI of 
the lumbar region revealed that patient presented mul-
tilevel lumbar degenerative disc diseases at L4–L5 and 
L5–S1with a posterior disc height of 10 mm and a pos-
terior disc protrusion of 2 mm at the latter (Fig. 1a left). 
After being explained the experimental nature of the 
proposed procedure, informed consent was obtained. 
In November 2009, this patient received an intra-discal 
injection of 27.68 million autologous, hypoxic cultured 
bone marrow-derived MSCs. Cells were injected into 
the posterior annulus fibrosus of the L5–S1 interverte-
bral disc. No complications occurred during the pro-
cedure and no adverse events were reported directly 
following the procedure. In May 2014, the patient 
returned for a follow-up examination consisting of a 
physical examination, completion of a quality of life 
questionnaire, and a lower back MRI. The lower back 
MRI post MSC transplantation, showed no neoplasms 
or abnormalities surrounding the treated region (Fig. 1b 
right). MRI measurements showed a mild progression 
of the disc degeneration with a posterior disc height of 
8 mm and a 25 % increase in the posterior protrusion 
from 2 to 2.5 mm (Fig. 1a right). As part of the quality 
of life questionnaire, the patient self-reported an overall 
improvement of 50 % post stem cell transplant as well as 
an increase in strength and range of motion (Table 3). 
No adverse events were reported due to the stem cell 
procedure based on the quality of life questionnaire and 
the physical examination.
Patient 2
The patient is a 25-year-old female with debilitating 
lower back pain with intermittent radiations down to her 
right leg. A pre-treatment MRI from July 2008 showed 
a significant reduction in disc height (8.5 mm), disc sig-
nal at L5–S1with a posterior disc protrusion of 4.3 mm 
(Fig. 1b left). Patient was explained the experimental 
nature of the procedure and signed an informed consent.

This patient received a total of 51.6 million autologous, 
hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs divided in 
two injections per patient request. She was transplanted 
with 14.3 million MSCs on July 2008 and with 37.3 mil-
lion MSCs on June 2009. Cells were delivered into the 
right posterior annulus fibrosus and at the annular/
nuclear interface of the L5–S1intervertebral disc. No 
complications occurred during the procedure and no 
adverse events were reported directly following the pro-
cedure. In April 2014 the patient returned for a follow-
up examination consisting of a physical examination, 
completion of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lower 
back MRI. The lower back MRI post MSC transplanta-
tion showed no neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding 
the treated region. MRI measurements showed mainte-
nance of disc height (8.8 mm) and a 20 % reduction of 
the posterior protrusion from 4.3 to 3.4 mm as com-
pared to the pre- stem cell treatment MRI (Fig. 1b right). 
Based on the quality of life questionnaire, the patient 
self-reported an overall improvement of 90 % post stem 
cell transplant and an increase in strength and range of 
motion (Table 3). No adverse events were reported due 
to the stem cell procedure based on the quality of life 
questionnaire and the physical examination.
Patient 3
The patient is a 40-year-old male with low back pain radi-
ating into his right leg for 18 months prior to MSC injec-
tion. A baseline pre-stem cell treatment MRI imaging 
was performed on March 2010 and showed single L5–S1 
level disc degeneration with a posterior disc height of 
6.6 mm and a posterior disc protrusion of 3.5 mm (Fig. 1c 
left). After being explained the experimental nature of 
the proposed procedure, informed consent was obtained. 
On May 2010, this patient received an intra-discal injec-
tion of 23.7 million autologous, hypoxic cultured bone 
marrow-derived MSCs. Cells were injected into the L5–
S1 intervertebral disc. No complications occurred dur-
ing the procedure and no adverse events were reported 
directly following the procedure. The patient returned 
for a follow-up examination in July 2014 consisting of a 
physical examination, completion of a quality of life ques-
tionnaire, and a lumbar MRI. The lumbar MRI post-MSC 
transplantation showed no neoplasms or abnormali-
ties surrounding the treated region. MRI measurement 
showed a mild decrease in disc height (5.6 mm) and 
a 43 % reduction of the posterior protrusion from 3.5 
to 2.0 mm post stem cell treatment (Fig. 1c right). The 
patient self-reported an overall improvement of 40 % 
post stem cell transplant as well as an increase in strength 
and range of motion (Table 3). No adverse events were 
reported due to the stem cell procedure based on the 
quality of life questionnaire and the physical examination.
Patient 4
The patient is a 43-year-old male with chronic lower 
lumbar and bilateral leg pain diagnosed with multilevel 
DDD in June 2008. In June 2009, a pre-stem cell treat-
ment MRI, used as a baseline, showed a posterior disc 
height of 8.1 mm and the presence of a posterior pro-
trusion of 4.1 mm with annular fissure and compres-
sion of the left S1 nerve root (Fig. 1d left). After being 
explained the experimental nature of the proposed pro-
cedure, informed consent was obtained. In September 
2009, this patient received an intra-discal injection of 
15.1 million autologous, hypoxic cultured bone mar-
row-derived MSCs. Cells were injected into the poste-
rior annulus fibrosus of the L5–S1 intervertebral disc. 
No complications occurred during the procedure and 
no adverse events were reported directly following the 
procedure. In March 2014, the patient returned for a 
follow-up examination consisting of a physical exami-
nation, completion of a quality of life questionnaire, 
and a lower back MRI. MRI images post-MSC injection 
showed no neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding the 
treated region. MRI measurements at the L5–S1 level 
showed a mild progression of the posterior disc height 
loss (6.9 mm) and a 40 % reduction of the posterior pro-
trusion from 4.1 to 2.5 mm post stem cell treatment 
(Fig. 1d right). The patient self-reported in the quality of 
life questionnaire an overall improvement of 10 % post 
stem cell transplant and an increase in strength while 
patient’s range of motion remained unchanged (Table 3). 
No adverse events were reported due to the stem cell

Patient 5
The patient is a 41-year-old male with chronic lower back 
pain and bilateral radiculopathy more pronounced on the 
left side. In April 2009, a pretreatment MRI showed mul-
tilevel DDD from L3–L4 to L5–S1 levels, with disc pro-
trusions at both L4–L5 and L5–S1 levels. At the L5–S1 
level, the posterior disc height was measured at 5.8 mm 
and the protrusion at 6.5 mm (Fig. 1e left). After being 
explained the experimental nature of the proposed pro-
cedure, informed consent was obtained. In August 2009, 
this patient received an intra-discal injection of 35.9 mil-
lion autologous, hypoxic cultured  bone marrow-derived 
MSCs. Cells were injected into the posterior annulus 
fibrosus of the L5–S1 intervertebral disc. No complica-
tions occurred during the procedure and no adverse 
events were reported directly following the procedure. 
The patient returned for a follow-up examination in July 
2014 consisting of a physical examination, completion 
of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lumbar MRI. The 
lumbar MRI post MSC transplantation showed no neo-
plasms or abnormalities surrounding the treated region. 
MRI measurement showed maintenance of the posterior 
disc height (5.8 mm) and a 48 % reduction of the disc pro-
trusion from 6.5 to 3.4 mm (Fig. 1e right). Based on the 
quality of life questionnaire, the patient self-reported an 
overall improvement of 80–90 % post stem cell transplant 
in addition to an increase in strength and range of motion 
(Table 3). No adverse events were reported due to the 
stem cell procedure based on the quality of life question-
naire and the physical examination.
Discussion
There is a clear unmet medical need, prior to surgi-
cal intervention, for patients with chronic lower back 
pain associated with DDD. The standard of care includ-
ing physiotherapy and corticosteroid epidural injections 
allows for pain management, at least initially, but does 
not frequently lead to prolonged pain relief and func-
tional improvement. The degenerative cascade associated 
with DDD often leads over time to the aggravation of the 
symptoms at the affected disc level, but also to the deteri-
oration of the adjacent intervertebral discs. After exhaust-
ing non-invasive options, patients face the prospect of 
surgery and, in particular, lumbar spinal fusion that does 
not guarantee complete pain alleviation and can present 
with significant complications and morbidity [30].
Regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies have 
gained tremendous interest in the past decades in 
multiple clinical applications and could represent a 
non-surgical biologic approach to improve pain and 
function in the millions of patients suffering from 
chronic low back pain associated with degenerative disc 
disease. Bone marrow-derived MSCs are of particular 
interest since they are easily accessible, they have been 
extensively studied, and they can be isolated following 
validated, standard operating procedures.
In the present study, we evaluated the safety and feasi-
bility of an intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic 
cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs in five patients 
with chronic lower back pain. The five patients received 
between 15.1 and 51.6 million MSCs. These patients 
consented to a follow up exam 4–6 years post-MSC infu-
sion consisting of a physical examination, completion 
of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lower back MRI. 
Data collected comprehensively showed that no adverse 
events, related to MSC infusion, occurred at the time of 
injection or up to 6 years post-injection, demonstrating 
long-term safety.
It is interesting to note that four out of five patients 
showed an improvement (reduction) of the protrusion 
size. Additionally all patients displayed maintenance or 
only mild worsening in disc height after long term fol-
low up. Importantly, based on the quality of life ques-
tionnaires, the majority of patients reported an overall 
improvement, as well as an improvement in strength and 
mobility. Although this represents a small sample group, 
there appears to be a correlation between the total num-
ber of hypoxic cultured MSCs injected and the overall 
improvement reported by patients (Fig. 2).
Autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived 
MSCs represent a potential attractive avenue for the 
regenerative treatment of patients with DDD. Preliminary 
safety data from the present study suggest that autolo-
gous, bone marrow-derived, hypoxic cultured MSCs are 
suitable for intra-discal injection of degenerated discs. 
Although these observations are encouraging, based on 
the small patient sample size and the uncontrolled nature 
of the study, a larger double-blind, controlled, rand-
omized clinical study with significant number of patients 
and implementation of validated endpoint measurements 
such as the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scale and the 
functional rating index (FRI) test are next steps in order 
to demonstrate efficacy of this cell-based biologic.
Conclusions
Intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured 
bone marrow-derived MSCs demonstrated safety and 
feasibility in five patients diagnosed with degenerative 
disc disease. This data further support the clinical use of 
such MSCs for the treatment of lower back pain in larger 
clinical studies.
