Summary
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was con-
ducted to examine the effects of probiotic supplementation on body weight, body
mass index (BMI), fat mass and fat percentage in subjects with overweight (BMI
25–29.9 kg m�2) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg m�2). MEDLINE, EMBASE and the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published
between 1946 and September 2016. A meta-analysis, using a random effects model,
was performed to calculate the weighted mean difference between the intervention
and control groups. Of 800 studies identified through the literature search, 15 were
finally included. The studies comprised a total of 957 subjects (63% women), with
the mean BMI being 27.6 kg m�2 and the duration of the interventions ranging
from 3 to 12 weeks. Administration of probiotics resulted in a significantly larger
reduction in body weight (weighted mean difference [95% confidence interval];
�0.60 [�1.19, �0.01] kg, I2 = 49%), BMI (�0.27 [�0.45, �0.08] kg m�2,
I2 = 57%) and fat percentage (�0.60 [�1.20, �0.01] %, I2 = 19%), compared with
placebo; however, the effect sizes were small. The effect of probiotics on fat mass
was non-significant (�0.42 [�1.08, 0.23] kg, I2 = 84%).
Keywords: Meta-analysis, obesity, probiotics, systematic review.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions
over the last few decades. In 2013, 36.9% of adult
(age ≥20 years) men and 29.8% of women were considered
overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25–29.9 kg m�2) or
obese (BMI ≥30 kg m�2) (1), and recent trend analyses show
that the number of subjects who are overweight or obese is
continuing to rise worldwide (2). Because of the multiface-
ted nature of obesity, there is no single or simple solution
to combat this growing epidemic. Novel, and most likely
individualized interventions, may thus be necessary to
effectively prevent and treat overweight and obesity.
Animal and human studies demonstrate that the trillions
of bacteria in the gut, the gut microbiota, are associated with
energy homeostasis (3,4). The gut bacteria ferment other-
wise indigestible carbohydrates, synthesize short chain fatty
acids and amino acids and may thereby, possibly, contribute
to the energy supplied to the host (5,6), although it is unclear
whether this process is of clinical significance in man.
Then again, by-products from the bacterial fermentation
process might also lower appetite and increase satiety (7),

 and by modulation of bile acid metabolism (8), the
microbiota may suppress diet-induced obesity through
increased energy expenditure (9). Also, the gut bacteria
may manipulate an individual’s taste and dietary preferences
(reviewed in (10)).
Interestingly, obesity, as compared with normal weight, is
associated with a disease-specific dysbiotic shift in the faecal
microbiota and also a lower bacterial richness (11). Energy-
restriction and weight loss, on the other hand, is associated
with an increased bacterial richness (12). The altered
microbiota in the gut of subjects with obesity seems to be
more efficient at harvesting energy from the diet (13) and
may possibly contribute to further weight gain. Conse-
quently, the gut microbiota is a potential modifiable target
for prevention and/or treatment of obesity.
Oral
administration
of
viable
strains
of
bacteria
(probiotics) has been proposed as a way of manipulating
the gut ecosystem to favour weight reduction or decrease
weight gain; however, the mechanisms by which probiotic
supplementation may influence the gut microbiota are
largely unknown (14). A few studies indicate that probiotics
may exert an effect on the function of different bacterial
species in the gut (15,16), but there is currently no clear
evidence
of
compositional
alterations
of
the
faecal
microbiota in response to probiotic supplementation (17).
Several recent studies have, however, found probiotic
supplementation to promote both weight gain and weight
loss (18,19).
Two recent reviews concluded that consumption of
probiotics slightly reduces body weight and BMI in adults.
However, first, the independent effects of probiotics on
body weight and BMI could not be determined as the
intervention groups in many of the included trials also
received prebiotics. Second, the previous reviews did not
focus on populations where weight loss is favourable, i.e.
subjects/populations with overweight or obesity. Finally, to
the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been
undertaken to examine the effects of probiotic supplementa-
tion on fat mass or fat percentage.
Objectives
This systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to examine,
through the results available from randomized controlled
trials, the independent effects of probiotic supplementation
on body weight, BMI, fat mass and fat percentage in
subjects with overweight or obesity.
Methods
Protocol and registration
This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO
(CRD42016052609) and the protocol can be accessed at
http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?
ID=CRD42016052609.
Eligibility criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of adults (18 years
or older) with overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg m�2), obesity
(BMI ≥30 kg m�2) or mean BMI ≥25 kg m�2. Studies
including subjects with gastrointestinal disorders or patients
who had undergone gastrointestinal surgery were excluded,
as were studies of patients with medical conditions in which
weight loss is contraindicated or studies including pregnant
women.
All probiotics species, whether administered through
capsules or added to foods, were accepted. Studies where
the probiotic bacterial species were not clearly defined were
excluded.
Also
excluded
were
studies
with
multiple
intervention components (e.g. prebiotics in addition to
probiotics) where the independent effects of probiotics on
outcomes were not estimated. In cases of multiple interven-
tions (different doses of probiotics and/or different species
of probiotics), the highest dose and largest number of
probiotic species were compared with control. Studies with
both short-term and longer-term follow-up, of any length,
were included. In studies where effect sizes were reported
multiple times during follow-up, the effect size after the
longest follow-up was used. We included studies comparing
intervention with placebo or no probiotic supplementation,
and the outcomes of interest were change in, or baseline and
final value of, body weight, BMI (kg /m�2), fat mass (kg)
and/or fat percentage.
Information sources and search strategy
The search was performed in cooperation with health
science librarians with expertise in systematic review
searching, using medical subject headings and text words
related to probiotics, BMI, body weight, fat mass (see
Table S1 for complete search strategy) on 1 September
2016. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, as well as the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The
electronic database search was supplemented by searching
for trial protocols through ClinicalTrials.gov. Also, addi-
tional studies were searched for in references of retrieved
articles.
The literature search was restricted to English language
and human subjects. Articles published ahead electronically,
ahead-of-print, were evaluated, but protocols not leading to
any publication were not included, and unpublished data
were not obtained. There was no restriction on publication
dates. The search strategy was subsequently peer reviewed
by a second librarian.

 Data collection
The literature search results were uploaded to http://www.
covidence.org, which is an internet-based review program
that facilitates review literature screening and collaboration
among reviewers.
Two members of the review team (H. B. and L. K. J.)
independently screened the titles and abstracts, yielded by
the search, against the inclusion criteria, with full reports
for all titles meeting the inclusion criteria thereafter
obtained. The reviewers resolved uncertainty and disagree-
ment by discussion with a senior author (J. H.), with whom
the final decision rested.
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from each study;
Authors, publication year, trial registration number, study
design and duration, method of analysis, study population
characteristics (number of subjects, % women, mean BMI
or BMI range and age range), number of probiotic species,
how probiotics were administered and the daily dose,
number of subjects in intervention and control group,
change in or baseline and final values of body weight,
BMI, fat mass and fat percentage and whether body weight,
BMI, fat mass or fat percentage were the primary outcomes
of the trial.
Risk of bias within individual studies
Risk of bias within the individual studies was independently
evaluated by two reviewers (H. B. and J. H.) using the
Cochrane collaborations tool, where the risk of selection
bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias,
reporting bias and other biases (e.g. lack of a priori sample
size calculation or an author’s financial interest) were
judged as high, low or unclear (20). The reviewers resolved
uncertainty and disagreement by discussion and consensus.
Statistical analysis
The mean change (standard deviation) in body weight, BMI,
fat mass and fat percentage from baseline was used to
calculate the mean difference (95% confidence interval
[CI]) between the intervention group and the control group.
When not provided by the study authors, we calculated the
standard deviation of the mean change in body weight,
BMI, fat mass and fat percentage using the formula in the
succeeding text (21). The correlation coefficient of the
formula was imputed using data from included studies
reporting both baseline, final values and changes from
baseline of body weight and BMI. Our estimated value of
0.90 indicated that the correlation between baseline and
final values of body weight and BMI was very high.

Results from all the individual studies were used to
calculate a weighted mean difference (WMD) using a
random effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was
assessed using Cochrane Q-test, and the magnitude of
heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2 statistics. I2 values
of 25%, 50% and 75% indicate low, moderate and high
heterogeneity, respectively (22). To investigate possible
sources of heterogeneity, we performed sensitivity analyses
and subgroup analyses using both study-level and patient-
level
characteristics.
Study
level
characteristics
were
dichotomized (according to the different within-study risks
of bias) into low risk and unclear/high risk. As the test for
between-group heterogeneity is likely to be invalid when
moderate to high heterogeneity is observed in one or more
subgroups, we ran a meta-regression (random effects) to
enable calculation of the proportion of between-study
variance explained by each patient-level or study-level
characteristic. The between-study variation accounted for
by the different covariates was estimated by comparing
tau2 in the meta-regression analysis when the covariate
was included to when the covariate was omitted from the
meta-regression analysis. Sensitivity analyses were also
performed by omitting one study at a time from the
meta-analysis, thereby assessing its effect on the WMD
(influential analysis).
Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of
funnel plots and the Egger’s test. However, tests for
publication bias were not performed when there were fewer
than 10 studies with the same endpoint as the power of the
test would be too low to distinguish chance from real
asymmetry.
Statistical
analyses
were
performed
using
Review
manager 5.3 and STATA/MP 14.2. P values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

were full text screened, a total of 11 articles did not meet
the criteria of inclusion either because the independent
effects of probiotics on outcomes were not possible to
estimate (23–30), the probiotic species were not defined
(31) or the patients had undergone gastric bypass (32) or
lacked sufficient information on the outcomes of interest
(33). Finally, 15 articles were included in the systematic
review and meta-analysis (34–48).

 Study characteristics
General characteristics of the 15 studies included in this
systematic review are presented in Table 1. The 15 studies
comprised a total of 957 subjects (63% women), with a
mean BMI of 27.6 kg m�2 and age between 18 and 75 years.
Two-thirds (n = 10) of the studies included generally healthy
subjects, whereas the remaining studies included subjects
with arterial hypertension (n = 1), non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (n = 1), hypercholesterolemia (n = 1), type 2 diabetes
mellitus (n = 1) and high fasting glucose (≥100 mg dL�1)
(n = 1). Eight of the studies included only overweight and
obese
subjects
(34,35,37,41–43,45,47),
whereas
the
remaining studies did not state that they excluded normal
weight subjects, but the mean BMI was above 25 kg m�2,
and most often closer to 30 kg m�2, in all included studies.
Two-thirds (n = 10) of the studies included one single
species of probiotics, while the remaining studies (n = 5)
included two or multiple species of probiotics. Probiotics
were supplemented in food such as yoghurt (n = 5),
fermented milk (n = 2), cheese (n = 1), soy milk (n = 1)
and capsules (n = 5) or powder (n = 1). The control groups
in all trials received either similar food without probiotics or
placebo capsules. Also, in one study, both cases and
controls were supplemented with an anti-obesity herb
(Bofutsushosan) in addition to probiotics/placebo (42).
The daily doses of probiotics varied between 1.0 × 109
and 4.8 × 1011 colony forming units (CFU), and the
duration of the trials ranged from 3 to 12 weeks (median:
8 weeks).
The majority of the studies reported changes, or baseline
and final values, of body weight (n = 13), BMI (n = 13) or
both (n = 10), whereas 7 and 5 studies reported changes
or baseline and final values of fat mass and fat percentage,
respectively. Changes in body weight, BMI, fat mass/fat
percentage
or
related
outcomes
such
as
changes
in
abdominal fat mass were the primary outcomes in 9 of the
included studies (35–37,39,40,42–45).
Risk of bias within studies
Risk of bias within the individual studies is shown in Fig. 2.
All 15 studies were randomized, and the majority (n = 11)
described the method of randomization. Methods of
allocation concealment were only properly described in
20% (n = 3) of the included studies, but almost all
(n = 14) studies were double blinded (participants and
study-personnel). None of the studies stated that outcome
assessment was blinded, but we believe that the outcome
measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding (49). Studies regarded as having low risk of bias
in terms of incomplete outcome date (n = 10) include those
with no drop outs, those where data were analysed
according to the intention to treat principle or where
reasons for exclusions were provided, as well as studies
where the number of drop-outs were evenly distributed
between the intervention and control groups. Importantly,
less than half (n = 6) of the trials were preregistered in a
clinical trial registry, which might have caused reporting
bias. Studies defined as having high risk of other biases
included those which were funded by companies with
marked interests or were researched by authors with vested
financial interests (n = 4), as well as those lacking a priori
sample size calculation (n = 9).
Results of individual studies according to different
endpoints
Body weight
The meta-analysis of the 13 studies examining the effects of
probiotics on body weight revealed that administration of
probiotics resulted in a significantly larger weight loss
(WMD [95% CI] �0.60 [�1.19, �0.01] kg) compared with
placebo, and the heterogeneity between the studies was
moderate (p = 0.02, I2 = 49.1%) (Fig. 3).

 ‘intervention duration’ individually explained 74.1% and
62.2% of between-study heterogeneity, respectively.
In the study by Lee et al., the reduction in body weight
was larger in the control group than in the intervention
group. Consequently, by removing the study by Lee et al.
from the meta-analysis, the effect of probiotic supplementa-
tion on body weight increased (�1.05 [�1.42, �0.69] kg)
(Table S2). Similarly, when this study was excluded, the
effect
of
probiotic
supplementation
on
body
weight
increased when restricting the analyses to studies where
subjects were clearly defined with overweight or obesity
(�0.73 [�1.46, �0.01] kg), generally healthy (�1.28
[�1.56, �0.70] kg) and among studies where body weight
or
related outcomes
were primary
endpoints (�1.23
[�1.69, �0.77] kg). When the study by Lee et al. was
excluded from the analyses, no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%,
p = 0.83) between the studies, or significant differences
between subgroups, were observed.
There was no indication of publication bias as the funnel
plot (Fig. S1) was satisfactory, and the Egger’s test indicated
that there was no small-study effect (p = 0.48).
Body mass index
A total of 13 studies examined the effects of probiotic
supplementation on BMI. Administration of probiotics
was associated with significantly larger reduction in BMI
(WMD
[95%
CI];
�0.27
[�0.45,
�0.08]
kg
m�2]
compared with placebo (Fig. 4), with a moderate heteroge-
neity (p < 0.01, I2 = 56.8%) between the studies.
Sensitivity analyses showed that the effect of probiotic
supplementation on BMI was reduced when the meta-
analyses were restricted to studies that only included
subjects who were clearly defined with overweight or
obesity (WMD [95% CI]; �0.14 [�0.45, 0.18] kg m�2)
and subjects who were generally healthy (�0.21 [�0.45,
0.03] kg m�2) or to studies where body weight or related
outcomes were primary endpoints (�0.21 [�0.44, 0.02]
kg m�2) (Table 3). The covariates ‘number of probiotic
species’, ‘intervention duration’ and ‘reporting bias’ each
explained 100%, 70.0% and 64.1% of between-study
heterogeneity, respectively.
The study by Lee et al. had a substantial influence on the
overall WMD, and the effect of probiotic supplementation
on BMI increased when this study was removed from the
analysis (�0.39 [�0.50, �0.29] kg m�2) (Table S3).
Similarly, the effect of probiotic supplementation on BMI
among studies where subjects were clearly defined with
overweight or obesity (�0.32 [�0,56, �0.07] kg m�2),
where subjects were generally healthy (�0.40 [�0.51,
�0.28] kg m�2] and among studies where body weight or
related outcomes were primary endpoints (�0.39 [�0.51,
�0.27] kg m�2] increased when the study by Lee et al.
was excluded from the analyses. Also, by removing this
single study, no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.58) between
the studies, or significant differences between subgroups,
were observed.
There was no indication of publication bias as the funnel
plot was satisfactory (Fig. S2), and the Egger’s test indicated
no small-study effect (p = 0.34).

 Fat mass and fat percentage
The overall estimate of the seven studies reporting changes
in fat mass showed a larger reduction in fat mass in the
intervention groups compared with the control groups, but
the difference was non-significant (WMD [95% CI];
�0.42 [�1.08, 0.23] kg), and between-study heterogeneity
was high (p < 0.001, I2 = 83.6%) (Fig. 5).
Because of the low number of studies examining the effect
of probiotics on fat mass, subgroup analyses or meta-
regression were not performed with regards to these
endpoints. However, the studies by Agerholm-Larsen et al.
and Lee et al. were the only studies reporting either
increased amounts of fat mass or lower reduction in fat
mass in the intervention group compared with the control
group, and by excluding these studies, there was no
heterogeneity (p = 0.77, I2 = 0%), and the estimated effect
of probiotic supplementation on fat mass increased (WMD
[95% CI]; �0.97 [�1.28, �0.66] kg).
Five studies reported on changes in fat percentage, and
the pooled estimate showed a significantly larger reduction
in fat percentage in the intervention groups compared with
the control groups (WMD [95% CI]; �0.60 [�1.20,
�0.01] %), with low heterogeneity (p = 0.30, I2 = 18.7%)
between the studies (Fig. 6).
Discussion
Summary of evidence
The current systematic review and meta-analysis have
examined the effect of probiotic supplementation on body
weight, BMI, fat mass and fat percentage in overweight
or obese subjects. A total of 15 randomized controlled
trials were included, whereof 13 studies reported on
changes in body weight, 13 studies reported on changes
in BMI and 7 and 5 studies reported on changes in fat
mass
and
fat
percentage,
respectively.

 sizes were small. Probiotic supplementation also reduced
body fat mass, albeit not significantly (�0.42 [�1.08,
0.23] kg).
Strengths and limitations
The present review was based on a broad literature search
performed in cooperation with an expert librarian, and it
is therefore unlikely that important trials were overlooked.
The meta-analyses examining the effects of probiotics on
body weight and BMI included an adequate number of
studies, while the number of studies included in the meta-
analyses of the effects of probiotics on body fat mass and
percentage were low, thus meaning that the latter results
should be interpreted with caution. The results are, how-
ever, strengthened in that fat mass, and percentage had been
estimated using a similar method in all trials (bioelectrical
impedance). A few studies included more than one probiotic
intervention, and we chose to include the intervention
groups who received the highest daily dose over the longest
time period as we considered these groups more likely to
experience an effect on body weight and related outcomes.
Most studies had low risk of selection, performance and
attrition bias. However, less than half of the trials were
preregistered in a clinical trial registry and were thus judged
as having unclear risk of reporting bias, while 12 studies
were either funded by companies with marked interests,
researched by authors with vested financial interests or
lacked a priori sample size calculation and were regarded
as having high risk of other biases. The majority of the
studies were of small size, and as only six trials had per-
formed a priori sample size calculations with body weight,
BMI, fat mass or fat percentage as primary endpoints, it is
likely that a number of the included studies were underpow-
ered. Also, because of small sample sizes, the baseline values
of the intervention and control groups were not always com-
parable despite being randomized. To account for this, we
estimated the mean change from baseline, where these values
were not reported, and included these values, in place of
post-intervention values, in the meta-analyses.
The study by Lee et al. was found to be the main source of
heterogeneity. Lee et al. reported greater reductions in body
weight and BMI in the control group than in the interven-
tion group. Consequently, when this study was excluded
from the meta-analyses, the WMD increased (i.e. greater
reductions in body weight and BMI in the intervention
groups compared with the control groups). This study was
the only study that included another intervention (the
anti-obesity herb Bofutsushosan) in addition to probiotics,
but we chose to include the study in the screening process
as both the intervention group and the control group
received the herb. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility of an interaction effect between the herb and
the probiotic supplement. Also, the study by Lee et al.
differed from the remaining studies in that the intervention
group received seven different species of probiotics, while
the other studies included between one and three species.
Whether the anti-obesity herb, the large number of different
probiotic species or another variable not accounted for, was
the source of heterogeneity is not known.

 All but three studies included probiotics from the
Lactobacillus genus in their interventions, and subgroup
analyses showed that the effect sizes did not differ between
studies that supplemented with Lactobacillus and those
who did not (data not shown). Because of a large number
of
studies
including
multiple
genera
and
species
of
probiotics, we did not perform further subgroup analyses.
A limitation of this study is thus that the estimates have
low specificity with regard to the effects of different
genera/species of probiotics on body weight, BMI, fat mass
and fat percentage. Further, there were no large variations
in
the
supplemented
daily
doses
of
probiotics,
and
consequently, subgroup analyses with regard to daily dose
of probiotics were not performed.
Agreements and disagreements with other studies
or reviews
In accordance with our findings, previous reviews have
found probiotics to reduce body weight in adults, and the
reported effect sizes were small (19,50). However, to the
best of our knowledge, this is the first of recent reviews
including only overweight/obese adults or populations.
Also, no previous systematic review has, to our knowledge,
examined the effects of probiotics on body fat mass and fat
percentage. One recent review examined the effect of
probiotics on body weight in infants, children and adults
and found probiotics to increase weight in infants and
children, while having the opposite effect among adults
(50). These findings raise suspicions of reporting bias
where only favourable results are reported. Hence, as the
present study only included subjects where weight loss is
favourable, we cannot exclude the possibility of selective
reporting.
A synergistic effect between probiotics and prebiotics is
not unlikely; therefore, in order to minimize between-
study heterogeneity, only studies where the independent
effects of probiotics on body weight, BMI, fat mass
and fat percentage could be determined were included.
Prior
reviews
have
included
interventions
with
both
probiotic and prebiotics, and to our knowledge, no other
review has been undertaken to examine the independent
effects of probiotics on body weight and the related
outcomes.
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis showed that short-term (≤12 weeks)
probiotic supplementation reduced body weight, BMI and
fat percentage, but the effect sizes were small. Overall, the
risk of bias within included studies was low, but, impor-
tantly, a number of trials were not registered and/or lacked
a priori sample size calculation and were thus regarded as
having unclear or high risk of reporting and other biases.
Accordingly, further long-term studies are required to
examine the effects of probiotic supplementation on various
measures on body weight.
