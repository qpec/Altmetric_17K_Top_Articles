ranscatheter ablation represents a valid treatment option in 
patients with drug-refractory symptomatic atrial fibrilla-
tion (AF).1 The majority of catheter ablation trials have mainly 
enrolled patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic 
function. In these patients, the ablative treatment has been 
shown to be effective in reducing morbidity,2–4 improving the 
quality of life (QoL),3–6 and improving functional capacity.5–7 
Background—Whether catheter ablation (CA) is superior to amiodarone (AMIO) for the treatment of persistent atrial 
fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure is unknown.
Methods and Results—This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients with persistent AF, dual-
chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, New York Heart Association 
II to III, and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% within the past 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo 
CA for AF (group 1, n=102) or receive AMIO (group 2, n=101). Recurrence of AF was the primary end point. All-cause 
mortality and unplanned hospitalization were the secondary end points. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 
months. At the end of follow-up, 71 (70%; 95% confidence interval, 60%–78%) patients in group 1 were recurrence free after 
an average of 1.4±0.6 procedures in comparison with 34 (34%; 95% confidence interval, 25%–44%) in group 2 (log-rank 
P<0.001). The success rate of CA in the different centers after a single procedure ranged from 29% to 61%. After adjusting for 
covariates in the multivariable model, AMIO therapy was found to be significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.5–4.3; P<0.001) than CA. Over the 2-year follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate was (32 [31%] 
in group 1 and 58 [57%] in group 2; P<0.001), showing 45% relative risk reduction (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.39–0.76). A significantly lower mortality was observed in CA (8 [8%] versus AMIO (18 [18%]; P=0.037).
Conclusions—This multicenter randomized study shows that CA of AF is superior to AMIO in achieving freedom from AF at 
long-term follow-up and reducing unplanned hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure and persistent AF.

However, a significant number of patients with AF also have 
LV systolic dysfunction. AF and heart failure (HF) frequently 
coexist and are often associated with several common predis-
posing risk factors such as hypertension, coronary artery dis-
ease, structural heart disease (nonischemic, valvular), diabetes 
mellitus, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea .8,9 Importantly, 
the prevalence of AF increases with HF severity, ranging from 
5% in functional class I patients to ≈50% in class IV patients.
Also, the prevalence of HF in patients with AF has been 
estimated at 42%.8 The combination of HF and AF leads to 
deleterious hemodynamic and symptomatic consequences. 
Rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) has not 
shown satisfactory results in randomized trials both in patients 
with or without HF.9–12
The Comparison of Pulmonary Vein Isolation Versus AV 
Nodal Ablation With Biventricular Pacing for Patients With 
Atrial Fibrillation With Congestive Heart Failure (PABA CHF) 
trial showed that pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) was superior 
to atrioventricular node ablation with biventricular pacing13 
in patients with AF and HF, improving their cardiac function, 
exercise capacity, and QoL; however, Jones et al14 showed that 
this benefit was achieved after more than a single procedure.
We sought to evaluate whether catheter ablation is supe-
rior to amiodarone (AMIO) for the treatment of persistent AF 
in patients with HF in a randomized controlled trial.
Methods
Study Design
Ablation vs Amiodarone for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in 
Patients With Congestive Heart Failure and an Implanted ICD/CRTD 
(AATAC) was a randomized study assessing whether catheter ablation 
is superior to AMIO for the treatment of AF. Patients ≥18 years of 
age with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defi-
brillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, New York 
Heart Association functional class II to III, and LV ejection fraction 
(LVEF) ≤40% within the past 6 months were enrolled at multiple cen-
ters. Patients were excluded if AF was caused by a reversible etiology, 
and if they had valvular or coronary heart disease requiring surgical 
intervention, early postoperative AF (within 3 months of surgery), or 
a life expectancy ≤2 years. Other exclusions included prolonged QT 
interval, hypothyroidism, history of severe pulmonary disease, and 
liver failure. Patients receiving a regular dose of AMIO (≥200 mg/d) 
were also excluded. The follow-up period of the study was 24 months. 
A flow chart showing the study design is presented in Figure 1.
Sample Size and Power
With the use of a log-rank test, the study was designed to detect at 
least 20% increase in success rate (30%–50% null hazard rate, 0.6; 
hazard ratio, 0.575) at 24 months follow-up at a 2-sided type I error 
(α) of 0.05, and 80% power. With 30% oversampling for attrition, 
a total of 200 patients (100 per group) were required to provide the 
power.
Randomization Procedure
Eligible subjects were enrolled after signing informed consent 
approved by the institutional review boards of the respective insti-
tutions, and were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo catheter 
ablation for AF (group 1) or to receive AMIO (group 2).
A computerized central randomization scheme was generated 
using block randomization, and sets of randomly selected blocks 
were provided to the investigating sites.
Primary End Point
Long-term procedural success was the primary end point for this 
study. Procedural success was defined as freedom from AF, atrial 
flutter, or atrial tachycardia of >30 seconds duration off AADs at 
follow-up.
In the ablation arm, a second ablation procedure could be per-
formed during the blanking period (3 months). After the blanking 
period, any atrial arrhythmia was considered a recurrence.
Secondary end points included complications, all-cause mortality, 
AF- and HF-related unplanned hospitalizations during the postabla-
tion follow-up, change in LVEF, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), 
and QoL measured by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure 
Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Unplanned hospitalization was defined as 
a hospital admission during the postindex procedure follow-up for 
arrhythmia-related causes or symptoms, signs, or complications of 
HF. Planned readmissions, such as hospitalization for repeat ablation 
procedures, were not counted as outcomes in this measure.
Ablation
In brief, dofetilide was discontinued 4 to 5 days before ablation, 
whereas patients on low-dose AMIO (up to 200 mg daily) were 
allowed to discontinue the drug after the blanking period.
In all patients, a double transseptal puncture was performed. 
Intravenous heparin was given with a target activated clotting 
time of 300 to 400 seconds. A circular mapping catheter (Lasso, 
Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) was used to guide the 
ablation. Intracardiac echocardiography could be used to guide 
transseptal catheterization and for anatomic orientation. An open-
irrigation tip catheter (Thermocool, Biosense Webster) was used 
for ablation.
The main goal of the ablation procedure was pulmonary vein 
antrum isolation. Pulmonary vein antrum isolation was extended 
down to the coronary sinus and to the left side of the interatrial sep-
tum, along with extensive ablations on the left atrial posterior wall 
with the aim to achieve isolation of the entire left atrial posterior wall, 
which was defined as complete electric silence on the left atrial pos-
terior wall confirmed by the absence of near-field atrial activity on 
the circular mapping catheter that was placed on the left atrial poste-
rior wall. In addition, the superior vena cava was empirically isolated 
when pulmonary vein (PV)–like potentials were found. Additional 
linear lesion ablation of complex fractionated electrograms and elimi-
nation of non-PV triggers were advised but performed according to 
the preference of the center or the operator. Antiarrhythmic medica-
tions could be restarted at the discretion of the treating physician dur-
ing the blanking period. A redo procedure within the first 3 months 
follow-up (blanking period) was not considered recurrence.
AMIO Treatment
Treatment with AMIO was initiated in the ambulatory setting.
AMIO therapy was initiated with a loading dose of ≈10 g in the 
first 2 weeks after randomization. This loading dose was given in 
divided doses: 400 mg given orally twice a day for 2 weeks followed 
by 400 mg each day for the next 2 weeks. Once the loading phase 
was completed, the maintenance dose of AMIO was 200 mg a day. 
However, 27 patients (12 in the ablation group and 15 in the AMIO 
group) receiving low-dose AMIO (<200 mg/d) were also included in 
the study. Digoxin was discontinued if possible, or the dose was at 
least reduced by 50%.
Screening pulmonary function tests and chest radiography were 
performed at baseline, and pulmonary function tests were performed 
yearly thereafter. Liver and thyroid function tests were assessed at 
baseline and every 6 months thereafter.
Congestive Heart Failure Management
All patients were on the optimal tolerated medical therapy for conges-
tive heart failure. Optimal therapy included angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in angiotensin-
converting enzyme–intolerant patients along with β-blockers, diuret-
ics, and digoxin when appropriate.
For those patients intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme /
angiotensin receptor blockers, a combination of hydralazine and iso-
sorbide dinitrate was recommended. New York Heart Association class

III patients were considered for treatment with spironolactone, whereas 
New York Heart Association class IV patients were excluded.
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction
In all patients standard 2D and Doppler echocardiography was per-
formed. LVEF was quantified by using a modified biplane Simpson 
rule in 2- and 4-chamber apical views. The LVEF measurements were 
performed by operators blinded to the randomization group and to the 
study end points.
Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire
QoL was measured at baseline and 24 months of follow-up by using 
the MLHFQ survey. It is a 21-item, self-administered, validated ques-
tionnaire that measures the effects of HF and its treatment on an indi-
vidual’s QoL. The MLHFQ produces a total score ranging from 0 to 
105. Lower scores indicate better QoL.15,16
6-Minute Walk Distance
Following the same schedule as the MLHFQ survey, 6MWD was 
obtained at baseline and 24 months, for objective evaluation of 
improvement in functional exercise capacity. It is a widely accepted 
test with good reliability in patients with congestive heart failure.17 It 
measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard 
surface in a period of 6 minutes.18
Time Course
The time course for the trial was divided into a treatment period fol-
lowed by the trial period.
The treatment period included the first 3 months postenrollment 
or postprocedure during which outcome data were not collected, 
repeat ablation could be performed and titration of AMIO dosages 
could be considered. The trial period started at the end of the treat-
ment period and continued for 21 months (the total study duration 
was 24 months). For patients undergoing repeat ablation, cardiover-
sion, or AMIO titration within the first 3 months, the treatment period 
started after the repeat procedure or AMIO dosage optimization. All 
outcome data were collected during this 21-month trial period.
Follow-Up
ECG, echocardiogram, clinical assessment with determination 
of New York Heart Association class, MLHFQ, and 6MWD were 
obtained at baseline and at 24 months follow-up. Clinic visit at 3 
months postprocedure or post-AMIO initiation included echocardio-
gram, ECG, and assessment of adverse and serious adverse events.
Arrhythmia recurrence was evaluated by using remote monitoring 
capabilities on implanted devices, with device interrogation at 3, 6, 
12, and 24 months follow-up. Adverse events were further collected 
at the end of the study.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive analysis was performed summarizing the age, sex, 
comorbidities, procedural parameters, and other relevant baseline risk 
factors. The continuous variables were reported as mean±standard 
deviation. The categorical variables were reported as number of cases 
(n) and percentage. Normality of the analysis variables were tested 
using Shapiro-Wilk test. If the normality assumption was found to be 
violated, then appropriate nonparametric tests were used.
Efficacy Evaluation
The efficacy analysis was conducted for the intent-to-treat popula-
tion. The intent-to-treat population consisted of all randomly assigned 
patients.
Primary End Point
Subjects who were recurrence-free at the end of follow-up were cen-
sored at the analysis time point, and AF-free time was defined as time 
from randomization to censor date. Survival curves were constructed 
by using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the primary null hypothesis 
was tested using the log-rank test; a 2-sided P value of <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Secondary End Points
The mortality and unplanned hospitalization rates were summarized 
across study groups. Patients requiring at least 1 rehospitalization 
were counted for this end point; time to first such hospitalization 
was analyzed by using the survival analysis technique. Death from 
any cause within the follow-up period was considered for mortality 
analysis and was compared between the groups using the log-rank 
test. Change in LVEF, 6MWD, and MLHFQ were assessed by using 
analysis of covariance model (SAS GLM procedure) with grouping 
variable as factor and baseline value as covariate.
Multivariable Analysis
Multivariable Cox regression model was used for assessing indepen-
dent predictors of AF-free survival and overall survival after adjusting 
for potential confounders.
Apart from covariates showing significant univariate asso-
ciation, potential confounders of known or expected clinical rel-
evance, regardless of their statistical significance at univariate 
analysis were considered for entering into the multivariable model.

Confounders adjusted in the multivariable model included age, 
sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The proportional-hazard 
assumption was tested by Schoenfeld residual analysis. The hazard 
ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed and pre-
sented in the results.
All tests were 2-sided and a P value <0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. Analyses were performed by using SAS 9.2 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Patient Characteristics
In total, 866 patients were screened, 331 were eligible for 
inclusion, and 203 consented and were included in the study 
and randomly assigned to receive catheter ablation (group 
1, n=102, left atrial diameter 47±4.2 mm, LVEF 29±5%) or 
AMIO (group 2, n=101, left atrial diameter 48±4.9 mm, LVEF 
30±8%). Baseline characteristics of the study population are 
presented in Table 1.
In the 102 patients undergoing catheter ablation, PVI was 
performed in 22 patients, and PVI plus posterior wall isolation 
was done in 80 patients. The total procedure time and radio-
frequency time were 168±72 and 66±34 minutes, respectively.
Arrhythmia Recurrence
During the blanking period 52 (51%) in the AMIO group and 
3 (3%) in the ablation group underwent cardioversion. After 
the blanking period, 25 (25%) and 15 (15%) patients had car-
dioversion in the AMIO and ablation group, respectively. All 
randomized patients were included in the survival analysis.
At the end of the study, 71 (70%; 95% CI, 60%–78%) 
patients in group 1 were recurrence free after average 1.4±0.6 
procedures in comparison with 34 (34%; 95% CI, 25%–44%) 
in group 2 (log-rank P<0.001). Of the 67 patients having 
recurrence in group 2, treatment failed in 7 (10.4%) after 
withdrawal of AMIO because of adverse effects (4 had thy-
roid toxicity, 2 pulmonary toxicity, and 1 patient developed 
liver dysfunction).
Because repeat interventions were allowed during the 
blanking period, and followed up for 24 months after such 
intervention, these patients accrued a maximum 27 months of 
follow-up. We performed a sensitivity analysis at the 24-month 
cutoff. At this time point, 73 (72%; 95% CI, 62%–79%) in 
group 1 and 37 (37%; 95% CI, 28%–47%) in group 2 were 
arrhythmia free (log-rank P<0.001).
In group 1, higher success was reported in patients under-
going PVI and posterior wall isolation in comparison with 
PVI alone (63 [79%; 95% CI, 68%–86%] and 8 [36%; 95% 
CI, 17%–56%], respectively; P<0.001). Success rate of abla-
tion in the different centers after a single procedure ranged 
from 29% to 61%. No patient was lost to follow-up during the 
study period. The Kaplan–Meier curve comparing recurrence 
across the study groups is presented in Figure 2.
Predictor of Arrhythmia Recurrence
We first investigated the association of AF recurrence in an 
unadjusted Cox model. In the univariate model, treatment 
with AMIO, LVEF, and diabetes mellitus showed significant 
association. The results of univariate analysis are presented 
in Table 2.
After adjusting for covariates in multivariable Cox model, 
the treatment of patients on AMIO therapy was found to be 
significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 
1.5–4.3; P<0.001) in comparison with catheter ablation. 
Besides that, diabetes mellitus showed a statistically signifi-
cant association with higher recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.1; 
95% CI, 1.07–1.26; P=0.01).
Unplanned Hospitalization and Death
Over the 2-year follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate 
was substantially lower in group 1 (32 [31%; 95% CI, 20%–
41%] and 58 [57%; 95% CI, 51%–69%] in group 2, log-rank 
P<0.001), showing 45% relative risk reduction (relative risk, 
0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.76). The NNT to avoid 1 unplanned 
hospitalization was 3.8 patients. In addition, there were sig-
nificantly fewer deaths (from all causes) in group 1 (8 [8%] 
group 1 and 18 [18%] group 2; log-rank P=0.037), with 56% 
relative risk reduction for mortality in patients receiving cath-
eter ablation (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, –0.20 to 0.96; NNT 
10 patients).
Change in LVEF, 6MWD, and MLHFQ
At baseline, the LVEF, 6MWD, and MLHFQ scores were 
not different between the catheter ablation and AMIO groups 
(Table 1).
With the exception of the 26 patients who died during 
the study period, end-of-study measurements were available 
for all 177 (94 in group 1 and 83 in group 2). In compari-
son with group 2, better improvement in terms of change in

(11±19 [median, 10] versus 6±17 [median, 5.0]; P=0.04) was 
observed in the group 1 population. When stratifying the pop-
ulation by recurrence status, recurrence-free patients (n=91) 
experienced significantly better improvement in all param-
eters than those who experienced recurrence (n=86; Table 3).
Procedural Complications
In group 1, 2 (1.96%) patients had groin hematoma, and 1 
patient (0.98%) had pericardial effusion that was conserva-
tively managed with fresh-frozen plasma and protamine.
Discussion
Main Findings
This is the first multicenter randomized study showing that in 
patients with HF and persistent AF, catheter ablation is supe-
rior to AMIO in achieving freedom from AF at the long-term 
follow-up. Importantly, ablation improved QoL and exercise 
capacity and reduced unplanned hospitalization and overall 
mortality. These findings are clinically relevant, especially 
in light of the socioeconomic advantages that arise from the 
reduced rehospitalization and mortality in HF patients.
HF and AF are the most common cardiac conditions in 
Western countries and often coexist. Pharmacological rate 
versus rhythm control is a controversial topic in the literature 
for the treatment of AF especially in light of the main results 
of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm 
Management (AFFIRM) and Rate Control versus Electrical 
Cardioversion (RACE) trials.11,12
A subanalysis of the AFFIRM trial, however, clearly show-
ing the association of sinus rhythm but not AADs with improved 
survival may reflect the fact that currently available AADs are 
neither highly efficacious nor completely safe. In addition, the 
results suggested that an effective and safe method to maintain 
sinus rhythm may improve survival. The rationale for a rhythm-
control approach includes the possibility of fewer symptoms, 
improved exercise tolerance, lower risk of stroke, superior QoL, 
and better survival, if sinus rhythm can be maintained.11,12
In patients with HF and AF, the available AADs to maintain 
sinus rhythm recommended by the international guidelines are 
limited to AMIO and dofetilide. These drugs are associated 
with significant adverse side effects and drug interaction that 
often lead to drug discontinuation.19–24 The long-term use of 
AMIO is associated with significant pulmonary, hepatic, and 
thyroid toxicity, in addition to severe bradycardia.24 Dofetilide 
requires hospitalization for careful monitoring because of 
severe QT-interval prolongation and torsades de pointes in up 
to 3% of patients, and its use is limited in patients with renal 
dysfunction, which is a common finding in HF patients.22
AF ablation might represent the ideal therapy that restores 
sinus rhythm without the adverse effects of AADs. Successful 
AF ablation results in significant improvements of left ventric-
ular function, exercise tolerance, symptoms, and QoL4 irre-
spective of the level of preprocedural rate control, suggesting 
that factors other than rate control (eg, loss of atrial contrac-
tion, atrioventricular dyssynchrony) drive the deterioration of 
cardiac function.
AF ablation has shown superior outcome achieving free-
dom from AF in comparison with AADs in several random-
ized controlled trials that enrolled paroxysmal AF patients 
with a normal heart. The success rate in patients who have 
persistent and long-standing persistent AF is variable in the 
literature. The variation in procedural outcome depends on 
different factors such as age, sex, AF types, structural heart

Overall, a higher recurrence rate has been shown in HF 
patients,3–6 and this might explain why AF ablation is not 
widely used as a rhythm control strategy in this subset of the 
patient population.
In agreement with these reports, we observed substantial 
improvement in 6MWD, LVEF, and MLHFQ scores in recur-
rence-free patients. The pathophysiology underlying HF and AF 
resulting in compromised stroke volume is the likely basis of 
altered exercise tolerance.15–18,30 Thus, the significant improve-
ment in 6MWD could reflect betterment in cardiac contractility 
and rhythm resulting in restoration of a more efficient cardiac 
contraction following successful ablation. Our results further cor-
roborated the correlation between ablation success and improve-
ment in QoL. This observation can be attributed to reinstatement 
of stable sinus rhythm, lesser burden of symptoms, and reduc-
tion in the use of health care resources and better well-being.31–33 
Results from a randomized trial conducted by MacDonald et al7 
comparing ablation versus rate-control medications in patients 
with persistent AF and LVEF <35% reported no significant dif-
ferences between groups in terms of improvement in ejection 
fraction measured by magnetic resonance (MR), exercise toler-
ance, or QoL. However, it is difficult to compare our findings 
with their results for several reasons: (1) different study design: 
ablation versus rhythm control medication in our trial and abla-
tion versus rate-control measures in their study: (2) small sample 
size (n=41); and (3) different ablation approach: majority (78%) 
of our patients received PVI and posterior wall isolation plus 
ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms and non-PV 
triggers as needed, which was the most likely reason behind the 
higher success rate than their patients who underwent PVI with 
a roof line and ablation of complex fractionated atrial electro-
grams. Recently published randomized trials have demonstrated 
suboptimal outcomes and no added advantage when linear 
lesions are performed in conjunction with PVI.34,35 Other factors 
responsible for the higher success rate in our study population 
could be the operator experience and the improved mapping and 
ablation technology in recent years that resulted in better PV 
encirclement. The results from this early study also contrast with 
more recent findings from the Catheter Ablation Versus Medical 
Rate Control for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Heart 
Failure (ARC-HF) and Catheter Ablation Versus Medical 
Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure (CAMTAF) 
trials, which both showed significant improvement in exercise 
capacity and QoL with AF ablation in comparison with phar-
macological rate control.14,36
The CAMTAF trial also showed a significant improve-
ment of LVEF after 6 months of follow-up with AF ablation in 
comparison with pharmacological rate control (+8.1 [95% CI, 
3.0–13.1] versus –3 [95% CI, –7.7 to 0.5]; P<0.001).36
Similarly, the ARC-HF trial reported a trend toward a higher 
LVEF improvement with AF ablation (mean difference, +5.6% 
(95% CI, −0.1 to +11.3; P=0.055) after 12 months of follow-up.14
Our trial shows that, after an average of 1.4 procedures, a 
clinically relevant freedom from AF can be achieved in these 
patients. Of interest is the finding that, when sorting the results 
by ablation technique, a poor success was observed in patients 
who underwent PV ablation alone in comparison with patients 
undergoing a more extensive ablation approach.
The coexistence of AF and HF increases the risk of 
unplanned hospitalization and significantly impacts health-
care costs.37 Therefore, the reduction of unplanned hospi-
talization and mortality are relevant potential benefits of the 
ablation strategy.
Study Limitation
We acknowledge certain limitations in our trial. (1) Although 
no formal comparison with a rate control strategy was per-
formed in this study, we would like to emphasize that AMIO 
is also considered in the guidelines as a rate control drug. In 
addition, 76% of the ablation group and 80% of the AMIO 
group received β-blockers at the tolerated dosage. (2) The 2 
other alternative AADs available for these patients, sotalol and 
dofetilide, were not tested in this trial, because dofetilide is 
not available in countries other than the United States and the 
patients were already on different β-blockers that they could 
tolerate. Moreover, AMIO is the most effective antiarrhythmic 
drug; therefore, these results could be extended to dofetilide

and sotalol. (3) Finally, our patients were followed up for 24 
months. Although a longer follow-up would be desirable, the 
follow-up duration in our study was longer than many other 
studies in the field of ablation. In addition, all patients had an 
implanted device, and success/failure was obtained by device 
interrogation.
Conclusion
This multicenter randomized study shows that catheter abla-
tion of AF is superior to AMIO in achieving freedom from 
AF at long-term follow-up and reducing unplanned hospital-
ization and mortality in patients with HF and persistent AF. 
The potential socioeconomic repercussion of these results will 
require further investigation.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are common cardiac conditions that often coexist. This is the first randomized study to 
show that, in patients with heart failure and persistent atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation is superior to amiodarone (the 
most used drug in these patients) in achieving freedom from atrial fibrillation at long-term follow-up. Importantly, ablation 
reduced rehospitalization and overall mortality and improved quality of life and exercise capacity. This study suggests that 
clinicians should consider catheter ablation sooner in this patient population.
