State-Specific Rates of Primary and Secondary Syphilis Among 
Men Who Have Sex with Men — United States, 2015

In 2015, the rate of reported primary and secondary syphilis 
in the United States was 7.5 cases per 100,000 population, 
nearly four times the previous lowest documented rate of 2.1 
in 2000 (1). In 2015, 81.7% of male primary and secondary 
syphilis cases with information on the sex of the sex partner 
were among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with 
men (collectively referred to as MSM) (1). These data suggest a 
disproportionate incidence of disease among MSM. However, 
attempts to quantify this disparity have been hindered by 
limited data on the size of the MSM population at the state 
level. To produce the first estimates of state-specific rates of 
primary and secondary syphilis among MSM, CDC used 
MSM population estimates based on a new methodology (2) 
and primary and secondary syphilis case counts reported in 
2015 to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. 
Among 44 states reporting information on the sex of sex 
partners for ≥70% of male cases, the overall rate of primary 
and secondary syphilis among all men (aged ≥18 years) in the 
United States in 2015 was 17.5 per 100,000, compared with 
309.0 among MSM and 2.9 among men who reported sex 
with women only. The overall rate of primary and secondary 
syphilis among MSM was 106.0 times the rate among men 
who have sex with women only and 167.5 times the rate among 
women.* These data highlight the disproportionate impact of 
syphilis among MSM and underscore the need for innovative 
and targeted syphilis prevention measures at the state and local 
level, especially among MSM. It is important that health care 
providers recognize the signs and symptoms of syphilis, screen 
sexually active MSM for syphilis at least annually, and provide 
timely treatment according to national sexually transmitted 
diseases treatment guidelines (3).
Case reports of primary and secondary syphilis cases for 
MSM, men who have sex with women only, and women were 
obtained from national data reported regularly by all states for 
2015. These data include limited demographic and clinical 
information, including the sex of sex partners. Population 
estimates of the number of MSM by state were obtained using 
new methodology that makes use of census and population-
based survey data (2). To estimate the MSM population size, 
the estimated percentage of MSM among men was adjusted 
(4) according to each U.S. county’s percentage of households 
with a male head and a male partner, obtained from American 
Community Survey summary data and urban-rural classifica-
tion (large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, 
* In this report “women” is used to describe both females aged ≥18 years (used 
for calculating rates for women) and females of unknown ages (used for 
calculating rates for men who had sex with women only).

medium or small metropolitan, or nonmetropolitan or rural) 
from the National Center for Health Statistics (4). The county’s 
percentage of MSM was adjusted according to the ratio of 
its percentage of male same-sex households to the overall 
percentage among all counties at the same urban-rural clas-
sification, which was then multiplied by the number of men 
in the county to achieve the estimated MSM population size. 
This final number was then scaled to equal 3.9% of the adult 
male population, based on a prior national MSM estimate (5).
To optimize stability of the estimates, the analysis was lim-
ited to the 44 states that included sex of sex partner in ≥70% 
of male primary and secondary syphilis case reports for 2015. 
The 70% threshold represented the best balance between 
including male cases of primary and secondary syphilis while 
gathering the most complete epidemiologic data for those 
cases. State-specific rates of primary and secondary syphilis 
among MSM were compared with rates of primary and sec-
ondary syphilis among men who have sex with women only 
and also among women (cases in men with unknown sex of 
sex partner were excluded from this analysis). Rate ratios were 
calculated as 1) the rate of primary and secondary syphilis 
among MSM divided by the rate among men who have sex 
with women only and 2) the rate among MSM divided by 
the rate among women.†
Primary and secondary syphilis cases in the 44 states included 
in the analysis accounted for 83.4% of all 23,872 reported 
primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States in 
2015. Among the reported primary and secondary syphilis 
cases among men and women in these 44 states in 2015, 12,118 
(60.8%) were among MSM, including 10,942 (54.9%) among 
men who had sex with men only and 1,176 (5.9%) cases among 
men who had sex with both men and women.
Among the 44 states, the overall rates of primary and sec-
ondary syphilis in 2015 among all men, MSM, men who have 
sex with women only, and women were 17.5, 309.0, 2.9, and 
1.8 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. State-specific 
rates among MSM ranged from 73.1 per 100,000 population 
(Alaska) to 748.3 (North Carolina) (Table 1). The overall U.S. 
rate of primary and secondary syphilis among MSM was 106.0 
times the rate among men who have sex with women only, 
with state-specific rate ratios ranging from 39.2 (Minnesota) 
to 342.1 (Hawaii). The overall rate of primary and secondary 
syphilis among MSM was 167.5 times the rate among women, 
with state-specific rate ratios ranging from 63.7 (Louisiana) 
to 2,140.3 (Hawaii).
Rates of primary and secondary syphilis among MSM varied 
by U.S. Census region and by state, with the highest rates in the 
South and West. Four of the five states with the highest primary 
and secondary syphilis rates among MSM were southern states 
(Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) 
(Table 2). Among states with the 10 highest rates of primary 
and secondary syphilis in the United States in 2015 (1), five 
states (Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and North

Carolina) also ranked among the top 10 states with the highest 
rates of primary and secondary syphilis among MSM (Table 2).
Discussion
These are the first state-specific rates of primary and sec-
ondary syphilis reported for MSM in the United States. The 
lowest state-specific MSM primary and secondary syphilis rate 
(73.1 in Alaska) exceeded the highest overall U.S. primary and 
secondary syphilis rate (70.9), which was observed in 1946. 
In every state, the incidence of reported syphilis among MSM 
was higher than the incidence among men who have sex with 
women only, with rate ratios ranging from 39.2 to 342.1. 
These data support CDC’s earlier findings using national 
population size estimates, which highlighted national dispari-
ties in syphilis incidence. In the earlier findings, the rate of 
syphilis incidence among MSM was estimated to be 154 per 
100,000 population, compared with 2.2 per 100,000 among 
other men, resulting in a rate ratio of 71 (5), in comparison 
to the estimate of 106.0 in the current analysis. However, the 
previous findings were limited in their applicability to state 
or local areas because the percentage of adult males who are 
MSM varies widely among states.
Although state-specific incidence rates varied, even in low 
incidence states (e.g., North Dakota), syphilis rates among 
MSM were higher than those among men who have sex with 
women only. The geographic variation highlights the impor-
tance of these data for state and local health departments, 
which can use these data to better understand their local 
syphilis epidemiology and target resources and interventions 
to address disparities between MSM and other population 
groups. The comparison of state-specific rates also highlights 
the high disease incidence in the South. Four of the five states 
with the highest primary and secondary syphilis incidence rates 
among MSM in 2015 were southern states. The estimates of 
state-specific rates among men who have sex with women only, 
although lower than those among MSM, also have implications 
for the rates of syphilis among women. Trends in congenital 
syphilis tend to follow trends in the incidence of primary and 
secondary syphilis among women of reproductive age, which 
has been increasing recently (6). Congenital syphilis can result 
in serious health consequences in infants (6). Although CDC 
is limited by its data usage agreement with the Council of 
State and Territorial Epidemiologists to conduct data analysis 
at the state level (7), further analyses at the county level by 
state and local health jurisdictions could be helpful to inform 
public health action by elucidating geographic disparities in 
greater detail.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, analyses were restricted to states where the sex of 
sex partners (male, female, or both) was reported for ≥70% of 
male cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases during 2015. 
Although 83.4% of all reported primary and secondary syphilis 
reported in the United States during 2015 were included, these 
jurisdictions might not be representative of all persons who 
receive a diagnosis of primary and secondary syphilis. Second, 
the denominators used in calculating the rates of primary and 
secondary syphilis were estimates of the number of MSM in 
each state, based on the reporting of same-sex households in 
the American Community Survey; underreporting of same-sex 
households could result in an underestimation of the MSM 
population and an overestimation of primary and secondary 
syphilis rates. Third, cases of syphilis in men for whom the sex 
of sex partners was unknown were excluded in calculations for 
both MSM and men who have sex with women only. If MSM 
are more likely to underreport the sex of their sex partner, this 
might result in an underestimation of the rate of syphilis among 
MSM and consequent rate ratio when comparing syphilis 
rates among MSM and men who have sex with women only. 
Improving the quality of case report data regarding sex of sex 
partner information could increase the awareness of public 
health officials regarding the characteristics of syphilis within 
their communities. Finally, primary and secondary syphilis 
case report data likely underestimate the actual number of 
incident syphilis infections in the United States because not 
all infections are diagnosed and reported (8).
Despite these limitations, these findings are consistent with 
previous reports that showed pronounced disparities in primary 
and secondary syphilis rates between MSM and men who have 
sex with women only (5), and the use of state-specific MSM 
population sizes and primary and secondary syphilis case 
counts permits comparison of primary and secondary syphilis 
rates by state. Rates among MSM compared with men who 
have sex with women only were higher in every state, but state-
specific data suggested that certain states might have a greater 
need for syphilis prevention. Because MSM represent the 
majority of all primary and secondary syphilis cases, the success 
of syphilis prevention programs is contingent upon addressing 
the high rates of syphilis among MSM. It is important that 
both private and public health care providers 1) recognize the 
signs and symptoms of syphilis, 2) conduct a comprehensive 
sexual history, 3) screen all sexually active MSM for syphilis 
at least annually, and 4) provide timely treatment according 
to national sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines 
(3). Part of this sexual history includes eliciting information 
on sexual practices and the sex of patients’ sex partners.§

rate among MSM divided by the rate among women. In this report “women” is used to describe both females aged ≥18 years (used for calculating rates for women), 
and females of unknown ages (used for calculating rates for men who had sex with women only).
¶ Montana, North Dakota, and Vermont had no cases of primary and secondary syphilis reported among women for 2015, resulting in an undefined rate ratio comparing 
MSM with women. Vermont had no cases of primary and secondary syphilis reported among men who had sex with women only in 2015, resulting in an undefined 
rate ratio comparing MSM with men who have sex with women only.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Syphilis rates in the United States have been steadily increasing 
since 2001, and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with 
men (collectively referred to as MSM) represent a disproportion-
ate number of cases. In the absence of reliable, state-specific 
denominators it has been difficult to estimate state-specific 
rates and rate ratios to accurately measure the geographic 
variation and disparity.
What is added by this report?
State-specific rate ratios comparing the rate of syphilis among 
MSM with the rate among men reporting sex with women only 
ranged from 39.2 (Minnesota) to 342.1 (Hawaii); overall, MSM 
had a rate of primary and secondary syphilis 106.0 times the 
rate among men who reported sex with women only.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These state-specific rates further highlight the disproportionate 
impact of syphilis among MSM. Providers should screen sexually 
active MSM for syphilis at least annually and provide timely 
treatment according to national sexually transmitted diseases 
treatment guidelines.
