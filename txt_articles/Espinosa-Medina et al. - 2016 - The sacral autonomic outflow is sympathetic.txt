Abstract
A kinship between cranial and pelvic visceral nerves of vertebrates has been accepted for a 
century. Accordingly, sacral preganglionic neurons are considered parasympathetic, as are their 
targets in the pelvic ganglia that prominently control rectal, bladder, and genital functions. Here, 
we uncover 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic features that distinguish pre- and postganglionic 
neurons of the cranial parasympathetic outflow from those of the thoracolumbar sympathetic 
outflow in mice. By every single one, the sacral outflow is indistinguishable from the 
thoracolumbar outflow. Thus, the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial 
nerves exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from spinal nerves, thoracic to sacral 
inclusively. This simplified, bipartite architecture offers a new framework to understand pelvic 
neurophysiology as well as development and evolution of the autonomic nervous system.
The allocation of the sacral autonomic outflow to the parasympathetic division of the 
visceral nervous system—as the second tier of a “cranio-sacral outflow”—has an ancient 
origin, yet a simple history: It is rooted in the work of Gaskell (1), was formalized by 
Langley (2), and has been universally accepted ever since [as in (3)]. The argument derived 
from several similarities of the sacral outflow with the cranial outflow: (i) anatomical—a 
target territory less diffuse than that of the thoracolumbar outflow, a separation from it by a 
gap at limb levels, and a lack of projections to the paravertebral sympathetic chain (1); (ii) 
physiological—an influence on some organs opposite to that of the thoracolumbar outflow 
(4); and (iii) pharmacological—an overall sensitivity to muscarinic antagonists (2). 
However, analysis of cellular phenotype was lacking. Here, we define differential genetic 
signatures and dependencies for parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons, both pre- and 
postganglionic. When we reexamine the sacral autonomic outflow of mice in this light, we 
find that it is better characterized as sympathetic than parasympathetic.
Cranial parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are born in the “pMNv” progenitor domain 
of the hindbrain (5) that expresses the homeogene Phox2b and produces, in addition, 
branchiomotor neurons (6). The postmitotic precursors migrate dorsally (7) to form nuclei

 (such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve) and project through dorsolateral exit 
points (7) in several branches of the cranial nerves to innervate parasympathetic and enteric 
ganglia. In contrast, thoracic and upper lumbar (hereafter “thoracic”) preganglionic neurons, 
which are sympathetic, are thought to have a common origin with somatic motoneurons (8, 
9). By implication, they would be born in the pMN progenitor domain (just dorsal to p3)—
thus from progenitors that express the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor 
Olig2 (10). The sympathetic preganglionic precursors then segregate from somatic 
motoneurons to form the intermediolateral column in mammals (11), project in the ventral 
roots of spinal nerves together with axons of somatic motoneurons, and, via the white rami 
communicantes, synapse onto neurons of the paravertebral and prevertebral sympathetic 
ganglia.
We sought to compare the genetic makeup and dependencies of lower lumbar and sacral 
(hereafter “sacral”) preganglionic neurons with that of cranial (parasympathetic) and 
thoracic (sympathetic) ones. As representative of cranial preganglionic neurons, we focused 
on the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, a cluster of neurons already well delineated 
at 13.5 days of embryonic development (E13.5), that expresses the vesicular acetylcholine 
transporter (VAChT) (Fig. 1B). Thoracic and sacral preganglionic neurons, which both form 
a mediolateral column in the spinal cord, did not express VAChT at this stage despite their 
eventual cholinergic nature. To localize them, we thus used their common marker nitric 
oxide synthase (NOS) (12) (Fig. 1, A and B), which was absent from the dorsal motor 
nucleus of the vagus nerve at E13.5 (Fig. 1B) or later (fig. S1). Thus, NOS expression 
characterizes thoracic and sacral, but not cranial, preganglionic neurons.
In contrast to cranial (parasympathetic) preganglionic neurons, thoracic (sympathetic) ones 
not only failed to express Phox2b or its paralogue Phox2a at E13.5 but also arose from 
Phox2b-negative progenitors and did not depend on Phox2b for their differentiation (Fig. 1, 
C to F, left and middle columns) but instead depended on Olig2 (Fig. 1G). Sacral 
preganglionic neurons shared all these features with thoracic ones (Fig. 1, C to G, middle 
and right columns). At E13.5, the T-box transcription factors Tbx20, Tbx2, and Tbx3 were 
expressed by cranial (parasympathetic) neurons but by neither thoracic (sympathetic) nor 
sacral preganglionic ones (Fig. 1, H to J, and fig. S2). The F-box transcription factor Foxp1, 
a determinant of thoracic preganglionic neurons (13), was expressed by sacral but not cranial 
preganglionic neurons (Fig. 1K). Differential expression of Phox2b, Tbx20, and FoxP1 
between cranial and all spinal preganglionic neurons, thoracic and sacral, was still observed 
at E16.5 (fig. S3). In sum, the ontogeny and transcriptional signature of sacral preganglionic 
neurons was indistinguishable from that of thoracic ones and therefore sympathetic as well.
Thoracic and sacral preganglionic neurons share a settling site in the mediolateral region of 
the spinal cord and a ventral exit point for their axons, whereas cranial preganglionics have a 
less systematized topography and a dorsal axonal exit point. These similarities of thoracic 
with sacral, and differences of both with cranial, are at odds with the notion of craniosacral 
outflow since its first description (1).
The targets of the sacral preganglionic neurons are in the pelvic plexus (figs. S4 and S5) and 
are considered, by definition, parasympathetic (14). Because a proportion of pelvic

 ganglionic neurons receive input from upper lumbar levels [half of them in rats (15)] and 
thus from sympathetic preganglionic neurons, the pelvic ganglion is considered mixed 
sympathetic and parasympathetic (16). This connectivity-based definition runs into a 
conundrum for cells that receive a dual lumbar/sacral input (17). The sympathetic identity of 
both thoracic and sacral preganglionic neurons that we unveil here makes the issue moot. 
Regardless, we looked for a cell-intrinsic criterion that would corroborate the sympathetic 
nature of all pelvic ganglionic cells in the form of genes differentially expressed in 
sympathetic versus parasympathetic ganglionic cells elsewhere in the autonomic nervous 
system. Neurotransmitter phenotypes do not map on the sympathetic/parasympathetic 
partition because cholinergic neurons in the pelvic ganglion comprise both 
“parasympathetic” and “sympathetic” ganglionic cells, as defined by connectivity (14), and 
bona fide sympathetic neurons of the paravertebral chain are cholinergic [reviewed in (18)]. 
However, we found that three transcription factors expressed and required in the 
sympathoadrenal lineage—Islet1 (19), Gata3 (20), and Hand1 (21)—were not expressed in 
parasympathetic ganglia such as the sphenopalatine, the submandibular, or the otic ganglia 
(Fig. 2 and fig. S6) [although Islet1 is expressed in ciliary ganglia (22) and Gata3 in cardiac 
ones (20), which thus diverge from the canonical parasympathetic molecular signature]. 
Conversely, we found that the two paralogous homeobox genes Hmx2 and Hmx3 are 
specific markers of all parasympathetic versus sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla 
(Fig. 2 and figs. S6 and S7). All cells of the pelvic ganglion were Islet1+, Gata3+, Hand1+, 
Hmx3–, and Hmx2– at E13.5 (Fig. 2) and at E16.5 (fig. S8), as were smaller scattered 
ganglia of the pelvic organs (fig. S8). Thus, all had a sympathetic transcriptional fingerprint. 
Similarly, the chicken ganglion of Remak, classically considered parasympathetic (23), 
displayed an Islet1+, Hand1+, Hmx3– signature, and thus is sympathetic (fig. S9).
Finally, we tested the pelvic ganglion for the contrasted modes of development of 
sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. Parasympathetic ganglia, unlike sympathetic 
ones, arise through the migration of Sox10+/Phox2b+ Schwann cell precursors along their 
future preganglionic nerve toward the site of ganglion formation and do not form if these 
nerves are absent (24, 25). At E11.5, the lumbosacral plexus, which gives rise to the pelvic 
nerve, extended some fibers that reached the lateral and rostral edge of the pelvic ganglion 
anlagen, most of which was already situated well ahead of them (Fig. 3A and movie S1). 
These fibers were coated with Sox10+ cells, none of which, though, expressed Phox2b (Fig. 
3B), in contrast to the cranial nerves that produce parasympathetic ganglia at the same stage 
(Fig. 3E). Deletion of all motor fibers in Olig2–/– embryos spared only two thin, presumably 
sensory, projections from the lumbosacral plexus (Fig. 3C), also devoid of Phox2b+ cells 
(Fig. 3D and fig. S10). Despite this massive atrophy, the pelvic ganglion appeared intact 
(Fig. 3C, fig. S10, and movie S2). This was verified quantitatively at E13.5 (Fig. 3, F and 
G). Thus, even though 50% of its cells are postganglionic to the pelvic nerve, the pelvic 
ganglion forms before and independently of it, as befits a sympathetic ganglion but contrary 
to parasympathetic ones.
Thus, the sacral visceral nervous system is the caudal outpost of the sympathetic outflow 
(Fig. 4 and fig. S11), the autonomic nervous system being divided in a cranial and a spinal 
autonomic system, in line with certain evolutionary speculations (26). This new 
understanding of the anatomy accounts for many data that were at odds with the previous

 one. For example, although schematics generally represent the sacral pathway to the rectum 
as disynaptic—i.e., vagal-like—[e.g., (3)], it is in fact predominantly (27) if not exclusively 
(28) trisynaptic—i.e., sympathetic-like (29). Despite the dogma of lumbosacral antagonism 
on the bladder detrusor muscle, the lumbar inhibition is experimentally absent (4) or of 
dubious functional relevance (30). The synergy of the lumbar and sacral pathway for 
vasodilatation in external sexual organs [reviewed in (29)] shows a continuity of action—
rather than antagonism, as the old model suggested—across the gap between the 
thoracolumbar and sacral outflows.
The sympathetic identity of all sacral and pelvic autonomic neurons, which our data unveil, 
provides a new framework for discoveries on pelvic neuroanatomy and physiology.
