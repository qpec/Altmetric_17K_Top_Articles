IMPORTANCE Varicose veins are common but rarely associated with serious health risks. Deep
venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are
also vascular diseases but associated with serious systemic effects. Little is known about the
association between varicose veins and the incidence of other vascular diseases including
DVT, PE, and PAD.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether varicose veins are associated with an increased risk
of DVT, PE, or PAD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study using claims data from
Taiwan’
s National Health Insurance program. Patients aged 20 years and older with varicose
veins were enrolled from January 1, 2001-December 31, 2013, and a control group of patients
without varicose veins were matched by propensity score. Patients previously diagnosed
with DVT, PE, or PAD were excluded. Follow-up ended December 31, 2014.
EXPOSURES Presence of varicose veins.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence rates of DVT, PE, and PAD were assessed
in people with and without varicose veins. Cox proportional hazards models were used
to estimate relative hazards, with the control group as reference.
RESULTS There were 212 984 patients in the varicose veins group (mean [SD] age, 54.5 [16.0]
years; 69.3% women) and 212 984 in the control group (mean [SD] age, 54.3 [15.6] years;
70.3% women). The median follow-up duration was 7.5 years for DVT, 7.8 years for PE, and
7.3 years for PAD for patients with varicose veins, and for the control group, follow-up
duration was 7.6 years for DVT, 7.7 years for PE, and 7.4 years for PAD. The varicose veins
group had higher incidence rates than the control group for DVT (6.55 vs 1.23 per 1000
person-years [10 360 vs 1980 cases]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 5.32 [95% CI,
5.18-5.46]), for PE (0.48 for the varicose veins group vs 0.28 for the control group per 1000
person-years [793 vs 451 cases]; ARD, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.16-0.24]), and for PAD (10.73 for the
varicose veins group vs 6.22 for the control group per 1000 person-years [16 615 vs 9709
cases]; ARD, 4.51 [95% CI, 4.31-4.71]). The hazard ratios for the varicose veins group
compared with the control group were 5.30 (95% CI, 5.05-5.56) for DVT, 1.73 (95% CI,
1.54-1.94) for PE, and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.68-1.77) for PAD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults diagnosed with varicose veins, there was
a significantly increased risk of incident DVT; the findings for PE and PAD are less clear
due to the potential for confounding. Whether the association between varicose veins and
DVT is causal or represents a common set of risk factors requires further research.

aricose veins are common in the general population.
The prevalence of varicose veins varies widely.1,2 Ap-
proximately 23% of adults have been reported to have
varicose veins in the United States.3,4
Varicose veins are rarely associated with serious health
risks. In contrast, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
embolism(PE),andperipheralarterydisease(PAD)arevascular
diseases that are associated with serious systemic effects. Pa-
tients with varicose veins
have increased levels of
inflammatory and pro-
thromboticmarkers.5,6In-
flammation is thought to
beassociatedwiththepathophysiologyofDVT,PE,andPAD.7,8
Because of the high prevalence of varicose veins, elucidating
potential associations between varicose veins and health-
threatening diseases is important. Previous studies evaluat-
ing the association of varicose veins with venous and arterial
disease were cross-sectional or case-control studies, had
relatively small sample sizes, and did not verify the diag-
nosis of varicose veins.9,10 Limited data are available from
longitudinal cohort studies to investigate the association
between varicose veins and the subsequent incidence of vas-
cular diseases.
This study investigated whether varicose veins are asso-
ciated with an increased risk of incident PAD, DVT, and PE in
a nationwide population-based cohort study in Taiwan.
Methods
Data Source
This retrospective cohort study used claims data from
the National Health Insurance (NHI) program linked to the
National Register of Deaths in Taiwan (eMethods in the Sup-
plement). The death registry contains date of death, which
was required information for follow-up because death was
treated as one of the censoring events. The enrollment rate in
the NHI program was 96% of the entire population in 1996 and
99% in 2015, and death registration is mandatory.11 This study
was approved by the institutional review board at Chang-
Gung Memorial Hospital, and the need for informed consent
was waived.
Identification of Study Patients
and Validation of Varicose Veins Diagnosis
We identified patients diagnosed with varicose veins from
January 1, 2001-December 31, 2013, according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi-
fication [ICD-9-CM] codes 454.xx for an outpatient or inpa-
tientclaim.Theindexdatewasdefinedasthedateofdiagnosis.
Patients were excluded if they were younger than 20 years of
age at the index date or if they had a medical history of PAD,
DVT, or PE before or on the index date (see eTable 1 in the
Supplement for ICD-9-CM codes). To assess the validity of the
454 code corresponding to the diagnosis of varicose veins, we
reviewed a random sample of outpatient medical records from
3 branches of Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (Taipei, Linkou,
andTaoyuan)thatprovidehealthcareservicestopatientswith
diverse characteristics. There were 239 patients in this sample,
which represented 1.5% of all patients (n=16 028) diagnosed
with varicose veins, of whom 39 could not be evaluated due
to incomplete or unidentifiable medical records. The valida-
tion criterion was met in 196 of the remaining 200 patients,
with a positive predictive value of 98% (95% CI, 0.95%-
0.99%)(seeeMethodsintheSupplement).Theworst-caseposi-
tive predictive value was 82% (95% CI, 0.77%-0.87%) if all 39
patients actually did not have varicose veins.
Identification of the Control Group
and Propensity Score Analysis
We randomly selected a control group without varicose veins
fromallparticipantsenrolledintheNHI.Individualsinthecon-
trol group were matched with those in the varicose veins group
at a 4:1 ratio based on year of birth, sex, and the calendar year
of index date. The participants in the control group were free
of PAD, DVT, and PE before and on the index date. Propensity
score matching was performed to balance confounders be-
tween the 2 groups. A logistic regression model was used to
estimate the exposure propensity score (ie, probability of hav-
ing varicose veins) for each participant. In the model, status
of varicose veins (yes/no) was regressed on potential con-
founders including age, sex, the calendar year of index date,
the number of outpatient visits in the past year, and comor-
bidities including hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, hyperlipidemia, malignancy, heart
failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic renal in-
sufficiency. We created propensity score–matched pairs by
matchingeachpatientwithvaricoseveinstoaparticipantwith-
out varicose veins using the greedy-matching algorithm.12,13
Comorbidities were defined as the presence of diagnosis codes
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) in at least 2 outpatient claims or
1 inpatient claim before the index date.
Study Outcomes and Follow-up
The study outcomes were PAD, DVT, and PE, defined as at
least 2 outpatient visits or 1 hospital admission with therel-
evant diagnosis codes (eTable 1 in the Supplement). All
patients were monitored from the index date until the earli-
est occurrence of PAD, DVT, and PE; death; or end of the
DVT deep venous thrombosis
PAD peripheral artery disease
PE pulmonary embolism
Key Points
Question Are varicose veins associated with an increased risk
of developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
embolism (PE), or peripheral artery disease (PAD)?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study from Taiwan
that included 425 968 adults, the presence of varicose veins
was associated with a significantly increased risk of incident DVT
(hazard ratio [HR], 5.30), PE (HR, 1.73), and PAD (HR, 1.72).
Meaning This study found a significant association between
varicose veins and DVT, and less clear potential associations
with PE and PAD; further research is needed to understand
whether the association with DVT is causal.

 study (December 31, 2014). We ascertained the study out-
comes using NHI claims and vital status data from the
National Register of Deaths. The 3 end points were analyzed
separately; that is, a patient with DVT who later developed
another end point was also counted as a case in the analysis
of the other end point.
Negative Controls and Falsification End Points
Negative control exposure and falsification end points (or
negative control outcomes) have been used to detect residual
confounding and bias due to unobserved confounders.14,15
For negative control exposure, we used hemangioma, a vas-
cular condition similar to varicose veins but unlikely to cause
PAD, DVT, or PE. We hypothesized that an association
between hemangioma and PAD, DVT, or PE may imply pos-
sible unmeasured confounding. We identified patients diag-
nosed with hemangioma (ICD-9-CM; 228.0x) in at least 2 out-
patient claims or 1 hospitalization from 2001 through 2013
and randomly selected a nonhemangioma control group
using propensity score matching for the same variables used
when selecting the controls for the patients with varicose
veins. All patients were free of PAD, DVT, or PE before and on
the index date.
We used 2 falsification end points, lung cancer (identi-
fied using the cancer registry ICD-O-3, C33-C34) and hyper-
lipidemia (ICD-9-CM; 272.xx), which are not associated with
varicose veins according to any known pathophysiologic
mechanisms. Thus, an association between varicose veins and
theseendpointsmaysuggestthepresenceofuncontrolledcon-
founders, such as smoking (a known risk factor for lung can-
cer) and obesity ( a known risk factor for hyperlipidemia).
Statistical Analysis
We compared baseline characteristics between groups using
standardized mean difference, a measure of distribution not
sensitive to sample size. This measure is calculated as the
absolute difference in means or proportions of a variable
between 2 groups divided by a pooled standard deviation of
that variable in the 2 groups.16 A standardized mean differ-
ence of less than 0.1 is typically considered to indicate
adequate balance in variables between groups.16 Kaplan-
Meier curves were generated showing cumulative probabili-
ties of experiencing the events (DVT, PE, and PAD) over time
and the differences between the 2 groups were tested using a
log-rank test. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs associ-
ated with varicose veins were estimated using Cox propor-
tional hazard models with a robust variance estimator that
accounted for the matched nature in the propensity score–
matched sample.17 Age- and sex-stratified analyses were per-
formed to assess whether the association varied with age and
sex. The interaction effects of age and sex were examined
using the likelihood ratio test comparing models excluding
and including the interaction term. We also conducted addi-
tional analyses with unadjusted and adjusted Cox propor-
tional hazard models to control for potential confounding
factors (sex, age, index year, number of outpatient visits dur-
ing the year before index date, and comorbidities including
hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, hyperlipidemia, malignancy, heart failure, ischemic
heart disease, stroke, and chronic renal insufficiency) to
assess the HRs in patients with varicose veins compared with
the age-, sex-, and calendar year–matched controls.
The proportional hazard assumption was tested by includ-
ing product terms between the predictors and a function of fol-
low-up time in the models. The assumptions were met for PAD
and PE but not for DVT. We further conducted analyses using
increments of follow-up duration (ie, >1 year, >2 years, and >5
years) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The HRs of DVT de-
creased substantially after 1 year of follow-up and remained
stable thereafter. Therefore, we performed additional analy-
ses restricting the follow-up duration to more than 1 year.
In analyses of the negative control exposures, Cox mod-
els were used for a sample consisting of patients with
hemangioma and matched controls. In analyses of the falsi-
fication outcomes, the dependent variables used in the
Cox model were lung cancer and hyperlipidemia instead of
DVT, PE, or PAD.
Two analyses were conducted to evaluate the poten-
tial effect of unmeasured confounders. First, we used the
method reported by Greenland and Lash18 to estimate how
large the association between smoking and varicose veins
would need to be to remove the observed association be-
tween varicose veins and DVT, PE, and PAD. The required para-
meters for this approach, which included estimated smoking
prevalence in the control group and the strength of associa-
tions between smoking and DVT, PE, and PAD, were obtained
from the literature (Methods section of eAppendix in the
Supplement).19-21 Second, we performed sensitivity analysis
using a confounding function approach,22 which described
the degree of the entire effect of all unmeasured and unrec-
ognized confounders. The relative risks (RRs) of DVT, PE,
and PAD were calculated using a log-binomial model with
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using
the propensity score. The marginal RRs obtained from IPTW
were corrected for various values of confounding functions,
c(0) and c(1). These parameters are counterfactual; c(0) rep-
resents a hypothetical RR of the outcome (DVT, PE, or PAD)
comparing those who actually did and did not have varicose
veins but assuming none had varicose veins; c(1) represents a
hypothetical RR of the outcome comparing those who actu-
ally did and did not have varicose veins but assuming all had
varicose veins. The values of c(0) and c(1) were then varied to
estimatetheeffectofunmeasuredconfoundingrequiredtogive
an adjusted RR. For example, c(0)=c(1) denotes the assump-
tion that there were no unmeasured effect modifiers, and c(0)
greater than 1 and c(1) greater than 1 implies that the exposed
participants would have had a greater risk of the potential out-
come than unexposed participants, if they had the same ex-
posure status.22
Missing or invalid data on age, sex, and vital status were
noted in 2% of the patients, and these patients were excluded
from the analyses. SAS software version 9.4 was used to per-
form all analyses except confounding function analyses, for
which R software was applied.22 Statistical tests were
2-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered to indi-
cate statistical significance.

 Results
Baseline Characteristics of the Study Patients
There were 239 616 patients aged 20 years and older with
varicose veins at diagnosis who were identified from 2001
through 2013. We excluded those diagnosed with PAD, DVT,
or PE before the index date (n=26 632), and classified the
remaining 212 984 patients in the varicose veins group. The
mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 54.5 (16.0) years, and 69.3%
were women (Table 1). Distributions of age and sex at diagno-
sis were not different between the varicose veins group and
the 2 control groups. The patients with varicose veins had
higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

 and more medical visits than the age-, sex-, and calendar
year–matched control group (n=851 936). Propensity score
matching resulted in 212 984 matched pairs of patients with
varicose veins and controls. The baseline characteristics were
well balanced between the groups after matching. The
median follow-up time for the specific study outcomes
ranged from 7.3 to 7.8 years in the varicose veins group and
7.4 to 7.7 years in the propensity score–matched controls.
Varicose Veins and Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism
The Kaplan-Meier curves of cumulative probability of devel-
oping an event showed increased risk of DVT and PE in
patients with varicose veins compared with propensity
score–matched controls (Figure; P<.001 for both DVT and
PE). Table 2 shows incidence rates and HRs of DVT, PAD, and
PE for the varicose veins group and propensity score–
matched controls. The incidence of DVT was higher among
the patients with varicose veins (6.55 [95% CI, 6.42-6.68] per
1000 person-years) than in the control group (1.23 [95% CI,
1.18-1.29] per 1000 person-years); absolute risk difference,
5.32 [95% CI, 5.18-5.46]). In the Cox model, the HR for the
association of varicose veins with DVT was 5.30 (95% CI,
5.05-5.56) for the patients with varicose veins compared with
the control group. In the analysis restricting the follow-up
duration to at least 1 year, the overall HR decreased to 3.98
(95% CI, 3.77-4.21). Age- and sex-stratified analyses showed
that varicose veins were associated with an increased risk of
DVT in all groups, and the HRs differed significantly by age
and sex (P for interaction <.001 for both) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). The HR was greatest among the patients aged
20 to 34 years and decreased with increasing age. The age-
and sex-specific HRs were lower but remained statistically
significant in the analyses restricting follow-up duration to at
least 1 year (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
The incidence of PE was higher among participants with
varicose veins (0.48 [95% CI, 0.45-0.52] per 1000 person-
years) compared with those in the control group (0.28 [95%
CI, 0.25-0.31] per 1000 person-years); absolute risk differ-
ence, 0.20 (95% CI, 0.16-0.24) (Table 2). The HR for the asso-
ciation of varicose veins with PE was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.54-1.94).
The association did not significantly differ by sex or age
(P values for interaction effect, .36 for sex and .62 for age)
(eTable 5 in the Supplement). Similar results were observed
in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard models compar-
ing the varicose veins group with the age-, sex-, and calendar
year–matched group (eTables 6-8 in the Supplement).
Varicose Veins and Incidence of Peripheral Artery Disease
The probability of developing PAD was higher in patients
with varicose veins than in the propensity score–matched
controls over the follow-up period (Figure, P<.001). The inci-
dence of PAD was higher in the varicose veins group (10.73
[95% CI, 10.57-10.90] per 1000 person-years) than in the pro-
pensity score–matched control group (6.22 [95% CI, 6.09-
6.34] per 1000 person-years); absolute risk difference, 4.51
(95% CI, 4.31-4.71), irrespective of age and sex (Table 2;
eTable 9 in the Supplement). Overall, the HR for the patients
with varicose veins was 1.72 (95% CI 1.68-1.77) compared
with the control group. The HR was higher among men than
in women (P value for interaction <.001), and lower with
increasing age (P value for interaction <.001) except for the
patients aged 75 years or older. Using a multivariable Cox
model with the age-, sex-, and calendar year–matched con-
trol group as the reference standard revealed similar results
(eTable 10 in the Supplement).
Negative Control Exposure and Falsification End Points
Between 2001 and 2013, we identified 117 762 patients with
hemangioma (Table 3). In analysis using propensity score–
matched controls, the HRs associated with hemangioma
were 1.09 (95% CI, 0.99-1.20) for DVT, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.81-
1.28) for PE, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78-0.86) for PAD. We per-
formed unadjusted- and multivariable-adjusted analyses
using the age-, sex-, and calendar year–matched controls.
The unadjusted Cox models revealed HRs of 1.50 (95% CI,
1.35-1.66) for DVT, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.17-1.93) for PE, and 1.00
(95% CI, 0.95-1.06) for PAD; however, the HR for DVT (1.25
[95% CI, 1.12-1.40]) and the HR for PE (1.14 [95% CI, 0.88-
1.48]) decreased after multivariable adjustments.
Analyses of the falsification end points showed a weak
association between varicose veins and increased risk of
hyperlipidemia (HR in the propensity score–matched model,
1.16 [95% CI, 1.14-1.18]; HR in the multivariable-adjusted
model, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.19-1.22]). However, a small yet statisti-
cally significant inverse association was observed for lung
cancer (HR in propensity score–matched model, 0.80 [95%
CI, 0.74-0.86]; HR in the multivariable-adjusted model, 0.81
[95% CI, 0.76-0.86]) (Table 4).
Analysis of the Potential Effect of Unmeasured Confounders
Details of the results of external adjustments for smoking are
provided in the Results section of the eAppendix in the
Supplement. In all scenarios, the smoking-adjusted RRs for
DVT were greater than 2.5. To achieve a substantial reduction
in the observed associations for PE and PAD (RR, 1.06 for
each), the RR for the associations between smoking and
these end points would have to be 5, and the smoking preva-
lence in the varicose veins group would need to be 2.4-fold
greater than that in the general population.
The RRs obtained using IPTW were 5.52 for DVT, 1.91 for
PE, and 1.79 for PAD. In sensitivity analyses (eFigure in the
Supplement), these RRs were corrected for hypothetical con-
founding functions c(0) and c(1), which shows that the RRs
decrease as the values of the confounding functions increase.
In absence of effect modifiers and unmeasured confounders,
the value of c(1)=c(0) equals to 1. For example, for DVT,
assuming c(0)=c(1), the unmeasured confounding-adjusted
RR would be equal to 1 if the confounding function was
at least 5.52 (ie, patients with varicose veins would have to be
at least 5.52 times more likely to have DVT than the controls,
if they had the same exposure status, to remove the entire
observed association between varicose veins and DVT). eFig-
ure (in the Supplement) shows all combinations c(0) of c(1)
up to a value of 2.0, none of which would bring the corrected
RR to 1 for DVT. However, for PE and PAD, some combina-
tions in this range would bring the corrected RR to 1.22,23

 Discussion
In this large, population-based cohort study, varicose veins
were associated with a significantly increased risk of DVT, PE,
and PAD. Previous epidemiological studies have examined
the association between varicose veins and the risk of
DVT.9,10 A cross-sectional study in Germany reported a 7-fold
higher prevalence of DVT in 2357 patients with varicose
veins, based solely on ICD codes without additional verifica-
tion of the diagnosis.10 A case-control study that enrolled 401
patients with DVT and 431 control patients aged 70 years or
older reported a 1.6- to 10.5-fold increase in the odds of DVT
associated with varicose veins, depending on clinical charac-
teristics such as varicose veins, leg ulcers, and leg edema.9
The present study was a longitudinal study that revealed a
strong association between varicose veins and DVT. The
overall HR of DVT decreased to 3.98 when the analysis was
restricted to a follow-up duration of 1 year or more, indicating
that the HR was higher within the first year after the diagno-
sis of varicose veins.
A population-based study in Finland of 888 patients with
varicose veins and 2006 control patients found statistically
significant increased odds of developing arterial disease
(PAD, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovas-
cular disease) in the patients with varicose veins (odds
ratio = 2).24 Authors of this report suggested that varicose
veins and arterial disease may have a common cause. In the
present study, the association between varicose veins and
PAD remained after controlling for hypertension, diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperlipidemia, and
malignancy, suggesting that the increased risk of PAD could
not be attributed solely to these confounders.
There are a several possible explanations for the findings
in this study. Animal models have shown higher concentra-
tions of macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes,
and matrix metalloproteinases in venous valves exposed to
high pressure for prolonged periods.5 Patients with chronic
venous diseases have increased leukocyte adhesion and
more activated leukocytes, as well as higher levels of inflam-
matory and prothrombotic markers.6,25 Riva et al reported
that inflammation may promote a prothrombotic state that
may facilitate venous thromboembolism.7 Lee et al reported
higher levels of hematological factors including fibrinogen,
von Willebrand factor, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),
and fibrin D-dimer in patients with diabetes and PAD com-
pared with those without PAD.8
Patients with varicose veins have increased levels of in-
flammatory and prothrombotic markers. The inflammatory
processes may cause the study outcomes (DVT, PAD, and PE),
of which the pathophysiology may be due to the inflamma-
tory process.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. First, claims data
do not include information for patients who do not seek medi-
cal assistance. Varicose veins are a lesser-known disease in the
older generation compared with other life‐threatening dis-
eases such as stroke and diabetes in Taiwan. In addition, the
unsightlyappearanceofvaricoseveinsmayembarrasstherela-
tively conservative Taiwanese patients, thereby increasing re-
luctance to seek medical assistance, a phenomenon also re-
ported among Asian patients in the United Kingdom.26
Therefore, results of the present study may only reflect the risk
among patients with more severe varicose veins requiring
medical treatment. This might also explain the higher HR for
DVT during the first year after the diagnosis of varicose veins
because patients with severe varicose veins may have been at
greater risk of developing DVT. Second, causal inferences can-
not be made as this was an observational study and thus prone
to bias due to uncontrolled confounders. In addition, infor-
mation on some potential confounders, such as smoking and
obesity were not available in the claims data, and these fac-
tors may have confounded the observed association between
varicose veins and DVT, PE, and PAD. The 2 falsification end
pointswerestatisticallyassociatedwithvaricoseveins,andthe
negative controls exposure (hemangioma) also was associ-
ated with PAD. These observations suggested that unmea-
sured confounding was likely to have existed. The magni-
tude of the association between varicose veins and PE and PAD
was small, and therefore, it may more likely be due to re-
sidual or unmeasured confounding. In the external adjust-
ment for smoking, extreme scenarios were required to re-
move the associations between varicose veins and PE and PAD
and were unlikely on the basis of data reported in previous
studies.19,20 However, when considering the overall effect of
unmeasured confounders, a confounding function of 2 to ex-
plain the observed associations between varicose veins and
PAD and PE may be plausible. A recent study showed that the
joint effect of multiple unmeasured confounders could ac-
count for an association at this strength.27
Third, the control group may have included patients
with varicose veins who did not seek medical care. This
misclassification may have resulted in an underestimation of
the association. Fourth, diagnostic evaluations for PAD are
more likely to occur in patients with varicose veins because
of their leg symptoms. This bias may partially explain the
association between varicose veins and PAD. Fifth, misclassi-
fication of DVT, PE, and PAD may have occurred because the
accuracy of these diagnosis codes in the NHI claims have
not been validated. Validation studies are needed to assess
the effect of misclassification of these end points on the mag-
nitude of the observed associations. Sixth, the study could
not examine whether greater severity of varicose veins was
associated with higher risk because varicose vein severity
was not available.
Conclusions
Among adults diagnosed with varicose veins, there was
a significantly increased risk of incident DVT; the findings for
PE and PAD are less clear due to the potential for confound-
ing. Whether the association between varicose veins and DVT
is causal or represents a common set of risk factors requires
further research.
