IMPORTANCE Despite a large rural US population, there are potential differences between
rural and urban regions in the processes and outcomes following trauma.
OBJECTIVES To describe and evaluate rural vs urban processes of care, injury severity, and
mortality among injured patients served by 9-1-1 emergency medical services (EMS).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a
prospective cohort enrolled from January 1 through December 31, 2011, and followed up
through hospitalization. The study included 44 EMS agencies transporting to 28 hospitals
in 2 rural and 5 urban counties in Oregon and Washington. A population-based, consecutive
sample of 67 047 injured children and adults served by EMS (1971 rural and 65 076 urban)
was enrolled. Among the 53 487 patients transported by EMS, a stratified probability sample
of 17 633 patients (1438 rural and 16 195 urban) was created to track hospital outcomes
(78.9% with in-hospital follow-up). Data analysis was performed from June 12, 2015,
to May 20, 2016.
EXPOSURES Rural was defined at the county level by 60 minutes or more driving proximity to
the nearest level I or II trauma center and/or rural designation in the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services ambulance fee schedule by zip code.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality (out-of-hospital and in-hospital), need for early
critical resources, and transfer rates.
RESULTS Of the 53 487 injured patients transported by EMS (17 633 patients in the
probability sample), 27 535 were women (51.5%); mean (SD) age was 51.6 (26.1) years. Rural
vs urban sensitivity of field triage for identifying patients requiring early critical resources was
65.2% vs 80.5%, and only 29.4% of rural patients needing critical resources were initially
transported to major trauma centers vs 88.7% of urban patients. After accounting for
transfers, 39.8% of rural patients requiring critical resources were cared for in major trauma
centers vs 88.7% of urban patients. Overall mortality did not differ between rural and urban
regions (1.44% vs 0.89%; P = .09); however, 89.6% of rural deaths occurred within 24 hours
compared with 64% of urban deaths. Rural regions had higher transfer rates (3.2% vs 2.7%)
and longer transfer distances (median, 97.4 km; interquartile range [IQR], 51.7-394.5 km;
range, 47.8-398.6 km vs 22.5 km; IQR, 11.6-24.6 km; range, 3.5-97.4 km).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most high-risk trauma patients injured in rural areas were
cared for outside of major trauma centers and most rural trauma deaths occurred early,
although overall mortality did not differ between regions. There are opportunities for
improved timeliness and access to major trauma care among patients injured in rural regions.

M
ultiple studies1-5 have demonstrated higher mortal-
ity rates and a greater proportion of deaths following
injury in rural compared with urban areas, although
1 study6 found no difference. Even after implementation of
a statewide trauma system that reduced mortality in urban
areas,7,8improvedtheconcentrationofseriouslyinjuredpatients
inmajortraumacenters,7,9andenhancedtheprocessesofrural
trauma care,10 mortality from trauma in rural regions did not
change.11 Differences in emergency medical services (EMS)
systems, injury severity, access to major trauma care, and
delays in care have all been cited1-4,11-13 as potential factors
explaining this discrepancy in outcomes. Other studies14,15
have demonstrated major differences in geospatial proximity
tomajortraumacentersintheUnitedStates.However,prospec-
tiveresearchaddressingdisparitiesintheprocessandoutcome
of patients injured in rural areas remains sparse, and much
of the existing literature is based on data obtained more than
20 years ago.
A prospective validation study16 of the national field
triage guidelines that included patients injured in urban and
rural settings was recently published. This study demon-
strated that, although field triage sensitivity for identifying pa-
tients with serious injuries (Injury Severity Score17 [ISS] ≥16;
range, 0-75, with higher numbers indicating greater injury se-
verity) appeared to be better in rural vs urban regions (81% vs
65.8%), only 12.5% of seriously injured rural patients were
initially transported to major trauma centers and only 39.3%
were ultimately cared for in major trauma centers.16 How-
ever, the primary results of this study did not allow a detailed
assessment of rural vs urban differences in trauma care.
We conducted a preplanned secondary analysis of the
prospective injury cohort of that study16 to detail rural vs
urban differences in field triage, processes of trauma care,
injury severity, and mortality. We sought to use these data
as an opportunity to address ongoing questions about dif-
ferences in process and outcomes between urban and rural
trauma patients.
Methods
Study Design
This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a prospective,
consecutive patient cohort in 7 counties in Oregon and
Washington. The study, as well as the secondary analysis,
was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards
in all study sites (eAppendix in the Supplement) with waiver
of informed consent.
Study Setting
The study included 44 EMS agencies transporting to 28 hos-
pitals in 2 rural and 5 urban counties in Oregon and Washing-
ton from January 1 through December 31, 2011. Rural vs
urban status was determined at the county level, with rural
counties defined using the following EMS and trauma system
factors: 60 minutes or more driving proximity to the nearest
level I or II trauma center and/or rural designation in the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Ambulance Fee
Schedule by zip code.18 The additional 5 counties included ur-
ban and suburban areas within a 30-minute driving proximity
to a level I or II trauma center and were considered urban for
the purposes of this analysis. The methods of the parent study
have been described in detail elsewhere.16 In Table 1, we re-
port and characterize the counties, EMS structures, popula-
tion served, and driving proximity to surrounding hospitals.
Participating hospitals differed in type and resource capa-
bility and included 5 level I trauma hospitals (including 2 chil-
dren’
s hospitals), 2 level II trauma hospitals, 5 level III trauma
hospitals, 5 level IV trauma hospitals, and 11 nontrauma hos-
pitals. Trauma centers in these regions are designated by state
authoritiesorverifiedbytheAmericanCollegeofSurgeonsCom-
mitteeonTrauma.20Wedefinedmajortraumacentersasalllevel
IandIItraumahospitals.The44EMSagenciesworkunderclose
medical direction, use standardized field trauma triage proto-
cols, and retrain on field triage when there are revisions to the
triage algorithm. During the study period, field triage protocols
in all counties were based on the 2006 national field triage
guidelines.21 For patients with closer proximity to a level III or
IVhospital,statetraumaguidelinesallowEMStransporttosuch
hospitals for initial evaluation and stabilization before poten-
tial interhospital transfer to a higher-level trauma center.
Patient Population and Selection
We included all injured children and adults for whom the 9-1-1
EMS system was activated within the 7 counties. This sam-
pling design provided a population-based, out-of-hospital
injury cohort defined through the lens of the EMS provider,
representing the full denominator of injured patients served
by EMS. To create a representative primary sample feasible for
medical record abstraction at the 28 hospitals, we used a prob-
ability sampling design based on the following strata: geo-
graphic region, triage status, age group, and type of receiving
hospital (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).16
Variables and Outcomes
Out-of-hospitalvariableswerecollecteddirectlyfromEMSelec-
tronic patient care reports and mapped to standardized

Key Points
Question What are process and outcome differences among
patients injured in rural vs urban areas?
Findings In this preplanned, secondary analysis of a prospective
cohort comparing 1971 rural patients and 65 076 urban patients
using 9-1-1 emergency medical services following injury, most rural
trauma deaths occurred within 24 hours. In addition, most
high-risk rural patients were cared for outside of major trauma
centers.
Meaning Patients injured in rural areas have less access to major
trauma care and deaths tend to occur early, suggesting that there
are opportunities to optimize rural trauma care.

ologic status (Glasgow Coma Scale,23 systolic blood pressure,
respiratory rate, and heart rate), procedures, mechanism of in-
jury, transport mode, initial receiving hospital, and reason for
selecting the hospital destination. We triangulated EMS rec-
ords, trauma registry records, and base hospital telephone rec-
ordstominimizemisclassificationbiasforfieldtriagestatus24,25
and matched EMS records from multiple agencies at the pa-
tient level to provide complete field-based information. The
electronic EMS data collection processes used for this study
have previously been validated.26
Amongpatientssampledforhospitalrecordabstraction,we
collected emergency department (ED) and hospital variables
using trained data abstractors (including one of us, S.S.) and a
standardized data collection form. Variables included airway
management, mechanical ventilation, surgical procedures,
blood product transfusion, intensive care unit stay, complica-
tions,interhospitaltransfer,AbbreviatedInjuryScalescores(0-6
forseparatebodyregions,with0indicatingnoinjuryand6rep-
resenting a nonsurvivable injury),27 ISS,17 and in-hospital mor-
tality.Forpatientstransferredbetweenhospitals,recordsatboth
facilities were abstracted. To supplement the abstracted hos-
pitaldata,recordsfrom9traumaregistrieswerematchedtothe
sample. We double-abstracted a portion of hospital records to
ensure reliable and consistent record abstraction.16
We defined early critical resource use as a composite mea-
sure of any of the following variables within 24 hours of ED
arrival: emergent intubation in the ED, major nonorthopedic
surgical intervention [brain, spine, neck, thorax, abdominal-
pelvic, or vascular surgery], interventional radiologic proce-
dures, packed red blood cell transfusion of 6 U or more in an
adult, or any blood transfusion in a child, or death. This defi-
nition was based on previous trauma triage research,28-33 a na-
tional consensus study34 defining trauma center need, and a
5-member advisory committee of content experts (including
two of us, J.R.H. and N.C.M.) used for the parent study.16
Statistical Analysis
Thesamplesizefortheparentstudy(n = 17633)wasdetermined
based on the desired precision around estimates for overall tri-
age sensitivity.16 To maximize the use of available information
for the present study, we used the full EMS sample (n = 67 047,
including53 487patientstransportedbyEMStoacutecarehos-
pitals) to characterize out-of-hospital care and the probability
sample (n = 17 633, weighted to represent the 53 487 patients
transported by EMS) to describe ED and in-hospital care. The
in-hospital follow-up rate of the probability sample was 78.9%.
We incorporated sampling strata and probability weights in all
analyses involving the probability sample to account for
sampling design.
We used descriptive statistics to characterize processes of
care, injury severity, and injury patterns between patients in-
jured in rural and urban regions. To address potential mortal-
ity differences, unadjusted and adjusted analyses were used.
For unadjusted analyses, mortality estimates were combined
across the out-of-hospital, ED, and in-hospital phases of care.
For adjusted analyses, we developed a multivariable logistic
regression model based on common predictors and confound-
ersusedinrisk-adjustmentmodelsfortrauma.Theroleoftime
was tested using survival analysis and hazard ratios (HRs) in
a Cox proportional hazards regression model. For all compari-
sons, rural vs urban designation was based on the region in
which the patient was initially served by EMS.
To minimize bias and preserve study power, we used mul-
tiple imputation to handle missing values,35,36 the validity and
rigor of which have been demonstrated for trauma and EMS
data.24,37,38 Flexible chains regression models were used for
multiple imputation39 with generation of 10 multiply im-

Because driving times were not available in public use geospa-

Results
Among the 67 047 injured patients evaluated by EMS during
the 12-month study period, 1971 patients (2.9%) were injured
in rural counties and 65 076 individuals (97.1%) were injured
in urban counties. Characteristics for patients in both regions
aredemonstratedinTable2.Amongthe53 487patients(79.8%)
transported by EMS, 27 535 were women (51.5%); mean (SD)
agewas51.6(26.1)years.Thoseinjuredinruralcountiestended
to be older, female, and injured by falls, but had physiologi-
cal status similar to that of patients injured in urban counties.
The EMS response and transport intervals were longer in ru-
ral counties, but the on-scene interval was similar to that of
urbancounties.Mostpatientsinruralareaswereinitiallytrans-
ported to non–level I or II hospitals, with hospital proximity

Theuseofindividualtriagecriteriaalsodifferedbyregion(eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement).
We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of triage for
identifying patients requiring early critical resources across 3
phases (field identification, initial hospital selection, and final
hospital destination) separated by rural vs urban location
(Figure1).ThesensitivityofidentifyingtraumapatientsbyEMS
at the scene of injury who ultimately required early critical re-
sources was 65.2% vs 80.5% for rural and urban regions, re-
spectively. However, few of these high-risk patients in rural re-
gionsweretransporteddirectlytomajortraumacenters(29.4%
vs 88.7%). Even after accounting for subsequent interhospital
transfers, most rural trauma patients requiring early resources
werecaredforoutsideofmajortraumacenters(39.8%vs88.7%).
Figure 2 illustrates injury severity between rural and ur-
ban patients. Rural patients had fewer minor injuries (ISS 0-8:
86.3% vs 89.9%) and more moderate injuries (ISS 9-15: 11.0%
vs 7.1%), yet the distribution of patients with more severe in-
jurieswassimilar.Theproportionofpatientswithserioushead
and thoracic injuries was similar, but serious abdominal (2.3%
vs 1.3%) and extremity (8.0% vs 5.6%) injuries were more com-
mon in rural areas.
Weevaluatedmortalityandresourceutilizationacrossmul-
tiple time points following initial contact with 9-1-1 EMS. Over-
all mortality, combined across the out-of-hospital, ED, and in-
hospital phases of care, did not differ between rural and urban
regions(1.44%vs0.89%;P = .09).However,agreaterproportion
of rural deaths occurred shortly after injury, with 90% of rural
deaths occurring within 24 hours compared with 64% of urban
deaths (Figure 3). Among the 29 deaths in rural regions, there
were15out-of-hospital(51.7%),11within24hoursorless(37.9%),
and3after24hours(10.3%).Amongthe583deathsinurbanre-
gions, 143 (24.5%) occurred out-of-hospital, 230 (39.5%) were
within 24 hours or less, and 210 (36%) more than 24 hours (ab-
solutenumbersofdeathsreflectentiresampleof67 047injured

pital, mortality was higher among rural patients in the first 24
hours (rural, 0.65%; 95% CI, 0.17%-1.13% vs urban, 0.13%; 95%
CI, 0.09%-0.16%), yet this difference disappeared when calcu-

talization (3.16% vs 3.35%) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Rates
of do-not-resuscitate order use did not differ substantively by
rural (0.21%; 95% CI, 0.03%-1.14%) vs urban (0.80%; 95% CI,
0.44%-1.43%) location.
Of the 53 487 patients transported by EMS, 2.7% (weighted
n = 1447) patients were transferred between hospitals follow-
ing EMS transport, including 3.2% of rural patients (weighted
n = 46 of 1438 transported patients) and 2.7% of urban pa-
tients(weightedn = 1401of52049transportedpatients).Among
the 28 hospitals, there were 67 different unique hospital com-
binations used for interhospital transfers. All transfers from ru-
ral regions involved higher-level facilities (38.1% to level I hos-
pitals,14.3%tolevelIIhospitals,and47.6%tolevelIIIhospitals).

multiple phases of care to address lingering questions about
rural trauma care. Although overall mortality did not differ be-
tween regions, the timing of death was different, with most
rural deaths occurring shortly after injury. Also, most high-

major trauma centers. Our findings have important public

Similar to previous research,2,4,12,13 we demonstrate that
most rural trauma deaths occur early after an injury event, of-
ten outside the hospital, which differs from urban areas. How-
ever, the overall mortality rate did not differ between regions,
a finding that contrasts with those of several prior studies.1,3,5
Thelackofastatisticallysignificantdifferenceinmortalitymay
reflectaruralsamplesizethatwasunderpoweredtodetectsuch
a difference or inherent characteristics of the rural counties in-
cluded in our sample. It is also possible that the efficiency and
resources available in urban areas delay the inevitable out-
come of patients with nonsurvivable injuries. Our data do not
provide a definitive answer to these possibilities. Previous
studies1,2,12haveattributedahighermortalityrateinruralareas
to prolonged discovery times, delays in out-of-hospital care,

cess to major trauma care. Injury severity between regions was
notsubstantivelydifferent.Althoughseriousabdominalandex-
tremity injuries were more common in rural counties, out-of-
hospital physiological status was similar and early resuscita-
tion practices did not markedly differ between rural and urban
regions. Because time of injury was unavailable, we could not
evaluate discovery time, which remains a potentially impor-
tant determinant in early rural mortality.
Regarding access to major trauma care, most high-risk pa-
tients injured in rural regions were cared for outside of major
traumacenters.Althoughthefieldidentificationstepwassimi-
larbetweenregions,thereweremajordifferencesinwherehigh-
risk trauma patients received care. Most high-risk rural pa-
tients were initially transported to non–level I or II hospitals,
regardless of triage status, reflecting hospital proximity. Even
after accounting for interhospital transfers, most high-risk
patients remained outside of major trauma centers. The high
rate of unnecessary interhospital transfers in rural trauma sys-
temssuggestedinpreviousresearch41wasnotsupportedbyour
data. Rather, rural hospitals in our sample tended not to trans-
fer patients who were most likely to benefit from care in major
trauma centers, suggesting that secondary triage (hospital-
based) and transfer processes are being underused. Improved

the emergency department: emergent intubation in the emergency

trauma transfer practices offer the opportunity to reduce vari-
ability in transfer processes41-43 and potentially enhance early
survival among patients injured in rural settings.44
There were limitations in this study. We used an EMS-
based definition for rural applied at the county level. How-
ever, a national reference45 defines rural based on different
factors, categorizing the 2 rural counties in the present study
as small metropolitan and large fringe metropolitan. It is pos-
sible that these counties may not have been remote enough
to demonstrate the mortality differences shown in previous
research. In addition, these rural regions provide advanced life
support care by EMS agencies and function as part of mature
inclusive trauma systems. Therefore, these areas may not be
generalizable to other rural regions.
Our sample was based on injured patients accessing 9-1-1
EMS.Althoughmostpatientswithseriousinjuriesusesuchser-
vices, patients presenting to hospitals outside of the 9-1-1 sys-
tem and deaths in the field without an EMS response were not
captured in our sample. In addition, the rural sample size and
total number of rural deaths were modest, which reduced our
ability to make definitive statistical comparisons and to evalu-
ate important subgroups of patients (eg, those with serious
injuries [ISS ≥16] and/or traumatic brain injury). The study was
not designed to detect mortality differences between re-
gions; it is possible that a larger sample size would have dem-
onstrated statistically significant differences in mortality be-
tween regions. Finally, in our stratified probability sampling,
we assumed that patient characteristics and outcomes at
participating and nonparticipating hospitals were similar.
Conclusions
This study identified major differences in the processes of
trauma care and sequence of events following injury in rural
vs urban regions. Although the ability to identify high-risk
patients by rural EMS providers was similar to urban regions,
there were major discrepancies in the location of hospital
care. Most rural trauma deaths occurred early after injury,
although overall mortality did not differ between regions.
Enhancing early rural trauma transfer practices may reduce
disparities in access to major trauma care and potentially
improve early survival among patients injured in rural areas.

Proportions were calculated based on the denominator of total deaths in each
region (eg, all rural proportions add to 100%). The absolute number of deaths
was calculated based on the full sample of injured patients served by EMS in
these regions during the study period (n = 67 047). Among patients injured in
rural regions, there were 29 deaths (15 [51.7%] out-of-hospital, 11 [37.9%] at
�24 hours, and 3 [10.3%] at >24 hours). Among patients injured in urban
regions, there were 583 deaths (143 [24.5%] out-of-hospital, 230 [39.5%] at
�24 hours, and 210 [36%] at >24 hours). The overall mortality comparison
demonstrated rural mortality of 1.44% (95% CI, 0.96-2.15) vs urban mortality of
0.89% (95% CI, 0.68-1.17; P = .09 for comparison). ED indicates emergency
department.
