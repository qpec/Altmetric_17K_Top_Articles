IMPORTANCE Establishment of the infant microbiome has lifelong implications on health and
immunity. Gut microbiota of breastfed compared with nonbreastfed individuals differ during
infancy as well as into adulthood. Breast milk contains a diverse population of bacteria, but
little is known about the vertical transfer of bacteria from mother to infant by breastfeeding.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association between the maternal breast milk and areolar skin
and infant gut bacterial communities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a prospective, longitudinal study, bacterial
composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in breast milk,
areolar skin, and infant stool samples of 107 healthy mother-infant pairs. The study was
conducted in Los Angeles, California, and St Petersburg, Florida, between January 1, 2010,
and February 28, 2015.
EXPOSURES Amount and duration of daily breastfeeding and timing of solid food
introduction.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Bacterial composition in maternal breast milk, areolar skin,
and infant stool by sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.
RESULTS In the 107 healthy mother and infant pairs (median age at the time of specimen
collection, 40 days; range, 1-331 days), 52 (43.0%) of the infants were male. Bacterial
communities were distinct in milk, areolar skin, and stool, differing in both composition and
diversity. The infant gut microbial communities were more closely related to an infant’
s
mother’
s milk and skin compared with a random mother (mean difference in Bray-Curtis
distances, 0.012 and 0.014, respectively; P < .001 for both). Source tracking analysis was used
to estimate the contribution of the breast milk and areolar skin microbiomes to the infant gut
microbiome. During the first 30 days of life, infants who breastfed to obtain 75% or more of
their daily milk intake received a mean (SD) of 27.7% (15.2%) of the bacteria from breast milk
and 10.3% (6.0%) from areolar skin. Bacterial diversity (Faith phylogenetic diversity,
P = .003) and composition changes were associated with the proportion of daily breast milk
intake in a dose-dependent manner, even after the introduction of solid foods.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study indicate that bacteria in mother’
s
breast milk seed the infant gut, underscoring the importance of breastfeeding in the
development of the infant gut microbiome.

icrobial colonization of the infant gut plays an im-
portant role in lifelong health.1,2 In healthy new-
borns, the gut microbiome composition shows large-
scale longitudinal changes until age 3 years, when it settles into
an adult-like anaerobic pattern.3-5 Perturbations in the micro-
biome are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune dis-
eases,suchasdiabetes,inflammatoryboweldisease,atopy,and
other conditions.6-8 The mechanisms of acquisition and pro-
gression toward a “normal” infant microbiome are poorly un-
derstood. Colonization of the infant gut is a complex process
dependent on multiple overlapping factors, including age,9
mode of delivery,10-12 type of feeding,10,12,13 and environmen-
tal exposures.14
Multiple studies have documented differences in the stool
microbiota of breastfed compared with nonbreastfed indi-
viduals during infancy and adulthood.13,15,16 Studies show that
breastfeeding confers protection against respiratory and gas-
trointestinal tract infections and allergic diseases in addition
to reducing the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obe-
sity, and inflammatory bowel disease.17 Most microbiota re-
search on the breastfeeding effects to date has focused on in-
fant stool. Little is known about the vertical transfer of breast
milk microbes from mother to infant.18
Breast milk contains a diverse population of bacteria19,20
that are hypothesized to seed the infant’s gut via breastfeed-
ing. We set out to evaluate the association between the ma-
ternal bacterial community and the infant’s stool in healthy
mother-infantpairs.Inthisreport,weshowtheextentthatma-
ternal milk and areolar skin contribute to the developing in-
fant microbiome. We also describe the predicted functional
profile of milk and infant stool bacterial communities.
Methods
Study Participants
We recruited healthy mothers and their full-term infants in the
community around Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Los An-
geles, California, and All Children’s Hospital, St Petersburg,
Florida, between January 1, 2010, and February 28, 2015. We
enrolled mother-infant pairs into the following infant age
groups: 0 to 7 days (initial colonization period), 8 to 30 days
(first period of full maternal milk supply), 31 to 90 days (be-
fore introduction of solids), 91 to 180 days (period of solid food
introduction), and 181 to 365 days (after solid food introduc-
tion). Mother-infant pairs were excluded if either had a health
condition or if the infant had received antibiotics. Institu-
tional review boards at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and All
Children's Hospital approved the study; written informed con-
sent was obtained from all mothers, and financial compensa-
tion was provided.
At the initial study visit, study personnel interviewed
mothers to collect clinical data, including basic demograph-
ics, pregnancy and delivery history, current or recent medi-
cations (including antibiotics), and infant feeding character-
istics(ageatformulaandsolidfoodintroductionandfrequency
of breastfeeding, formula, and solid foods). On all follow-up
visits, we asked about new medical conditions, antibiotic use,
and feeding characteristics, using the Research Electronic Data
Capture (REDCap Consortium; https://www.project-redcap
.org/) database.
Sample Collection, DNA Extraction, and Sequencing
We collected breast milk and areolar skin swabs from moth-
ers and stool from infants’ soiled diapers during clinic or home
study visits. Mothers expressed milk with a manual or elec-
tricbreastpumpusingsterilizedconnectorsintosterilebottles.
Longitudinal samples were obtained when possible. The DNA
extraction, library preparation, and sequencing of the V4 re-
gion of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene on a MiSeq se-
quencer (Illumina Inc) were performed using standard proce-
dures with quality control (eMethods and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We compared differences in α diversity using Faith phyloge-
netic diversity21; β diversity, using unweighted UniFrac and
Bray-Curtis; and community composition between groups
based on feeding characteristics. To evaluate sources of in-
fant stool microbiome variation, we modeled infant age, de-
mographics,deliverytype,geographiccollectionsite,andfeed-
ingcharacteristicswiththepermutationalmultivariateanalysis
of variance using distance matrices (adonis, R vegan pack-
age; R Foundation). Interaction terms were tested and not sta-
tistically significant. To predict the source of bacterial com-
munities in infant stool, we used SourceTracker, version 0.9.5,
software in Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology22 to
compare sequences in breast milk and areolar skin as input
samples (source samples) with the sequences in infant stool
(sink sample). To compare paired breast milk and infant stool
samples, we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test on UniFrac,
Jaccardindex,andBray-Curtisdistancesbetweentruemother-
infantpairsandrandomlypairedmothersandinfantsmatched
by infant age within each run. Operational taxonomic unit
(OTU) sharing was defined as the percentage of mother-
infant dyads in which a given OTU was found in both mem-
bers; permutation testing with randomly shuffled mother-
infant pairings was used to assess significance. Oligotyping
analysis was performed using sequences mapped to OTUs
shared within mother-infant dyads as previously described.23
Key Points
Question Do maternal breast milk and areolar skin bacterial
communities transfer to the infant gut?
Findings In this 12-month longitudinal study of 107 healthy
mother-infant pairs, breastfed infants received 27.7% of their gut
bacteria from breast milk and 10.4% from areolar skin during the
first month of life. Bacterial diversity and composition changes
were associated with the proportion of daily breast milk intake in a
dose-dependent manner even after introduction of solid foods.
Meaning Microbes in mother’
s breast milk seed the infant gut,
including those associated with beneficial effects, underscoring
the importance of breastfeeding in maturation of the infant gut
microbiome.

biota age of healthy children of a similar chronologic age from

quences.BothR,version3.0.3andSTAMP,version2.0.925were

was considered significant for all other analyses.
Results
Study Population
We enrolled 228 healthy individuals from 121 families, includ-
ing107mother-infantpairs,2mothersonly,and12infantsonly.
Median infant age at the time of specimen collection was 40
days (range, 1-331 days). Family and feeding characteristics are
reported in the Table and eTable 1 in the Supplement, respec-
tively.Eighty(66.1%)ofourfamilieswereHispanic/Latino.Sev-
enty-eight (64.5%) infants were born by vaginal delivery. We
analyzed at least 2 longitudinal samples from 73 (60.3%) fami-
lies. At the time of sample collection (n = 569), 484 (85.1%)
samples showed that the infants were primarily breastfed (de-
fined as receiving breast milk for >75% of their daily milk in-
take), including 298 (52.4%) who were exclusively breastfed
(defined as never having received formula).
Breast Milk, Areolar, and Infant Stool Microbiomes
Distinct bacterial communities were present in milk, areolar
skin, and stool, which differed in both composition and diver-
sity (Figure 1). Proteobacteria (Moraxellaceae, Enterobacte-
riaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae) constituted the dominant
phylum in milk, Firmicutes (Staphylococcaceae and Strepto-
coccaceae) were dominant in areolar skin, and Proteobacte-
ria (Enterobacteriaceae) and Actinobacteria (Bifidobacteria-
ceae) accounted for more than 50% of the community in infant
stool. Milk and areolar samples collected from the right and
left breast were similar (eFigure 2 in the Supplement); there-
fore, samples from the right breast were used for analyses if
samples from both sides were collected.
The breast milk bacterial community as the infant aged is
shown in Figure 2. The breast milk bacterial communities re-
mained unchanged in α diversity (within-sample diversity)
throughout the first year of life. β Diversity (between-sample
diversity) increased between mothers in the first 6 months
after delivery and then decreased. There were no significant
differences in breast milk or areolar bacteria by race/
ethnicity, infant sex, mode of delivery, or geographic location
of enrollment site.
Taxonomic Changes in Infant Stool as a Function of Age,
Feeding Type, and Other Factors
Bacterial diversity in infant stool increased with age, with con-
vergencebetweenindividualinfantsnear12months(Figure2).
Actinobacteria, specifically Bifidobacteriaceae (r = 0.31,
P < .001), typically increased and Proteobacteria, specifically
Enterobacteriaceae (r = 0.27, P < .001), decreased as the in-
fant aged. Bacterial abundance changes occurred in direct or
inverse relationships with each other in a complex network
(eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Members of the Bifidobacte-
riaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families were dominant in the
3 observed clusters.
To evaluate factors contributing to the infant stool micro-
biome, we applied a permutational multivariate analysis of
variance using the unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dis-
tance matrices (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Age accounted
for 23% of the variation between infant stool samples

 (unweighted UniFrac, P = .001). The timing of formula intro-
duction (R2 = 0.023, P = .001), solid food introduction
(R2 = 0.029, P = .001), percentage of daily breastfeeding
(R2 = 0.008, P = .002), and delivery method (R2 = 0.009,
P = .001) also represented smaller, but significant, indepen-
dent drivers of the microbiome trajectory in the developing in-
fant. Race was a significant factor using unweighted UniFrac,
but not Bray-Curtis, distances.
Infant Gut Microbiota Composition Association
With Amount of Daily Breastfeeding
We used SourceTracker22 to estimate the proportion of bacte-
ria in infant stool that originated from breast milk and areolar
skin (Figure 3). Overall, primarily breastfed infants received
morebacteriafrombreastmilkandareolarskincomparedwith
those not primarily breastfed (breast milk, 18.5% vs 5.7%,
P < .001, Wilcoxon rank sum; areolar, 5.2% vs 0.001%, P = .01,
Wilcoxonranksum).Duringthefirst30daysoflife,infantswho
were primarily breastfed received mean (SD) 27.7% (15.2%) of
the bacteria from breast milk and 10.4% (6.0%) from areolar
skin. The remaining 61.9% (16.2%) came from other sources
that we did not characterize. The contribution of bacteria from
mother’s milk and areolar skin was highest during the first
month of life and decreased as the infant aged.
Because bacterial communities in milk and areolar skin re-
mained distinct for each mother, we hypothesized that an in-
fant’s stool microbiota would be more similar to the infant’s
mother’s microbiota compared with random mothers. Com-
parison using multiple distance metrics showed closer dis-
tances between infant stool and breast milk or areolar skin
among true mother-infant pairs compared with random pairs
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). In total, 26 of 478 OTUs were
more significantly shared within mother-infant pairs vs ran-
dom pairs (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Oligotyping analysis
showed significant sharing of Streptococcus, Veillonella, and
Rothia (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Changes in the infant gut bacterial community were as-
sociated with the proportion of breastfeeding in a dose-
dependent manner. The percentage of daily milk intake was
associated with altered community composition, measured by
unweighted UniFrac distance (R2 = 0.008, P = .002). Differ-
ences in gut phylogenetic diversity did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (nonparametric t test, P = .06), but different com-
positions were observed between primarily and nonprimarily

 breastfed infants (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). We used ran-
dom forest modeling to determine the bacterial taxa that best
discriminate between the infant’s lifetime feeding pattern (ie,
exclusively vs nonexclusively breastfed). Erysipelotricha-
ceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Ruminococcaceae were the most
prominent families found in nonexclusively breastfed in-
fants that discriminated between the 2 groups (eFigure 5A in

more abundant among formula feeders at the time of the
sample collection (eFigure 5B in the Supplement).

Predicted Metagenome Function of Breast Milk
and Infant Gut Bacterial Community
Given the effect of breast milk microbiota on the infant gut
community, we sought to gain insight into the genes present
in breast milk bacterial communities using PICRUSt.24 Breast
milk contains bacteria with predicted high abundance in gene
families associated with membrane transport and carbohy-
drate, amino acid, and energy metabolism (eFigure 8 in the
Supplement). We compared metagenome predictions of in-
fant stool microbiota based on the amount of breast milk in-
take. Infants who were primarily breastfed had a lower repre-
sentationofgenesinvolvedinenergymetabolism,sphingolipid
metabolism, and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (eFig-
ure 9 in the Supplement). Infants with earlier introduction of
solid food had microbiota with increased function related to
xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism.
Discussion
Wecharacterizedbacterialcommunitiesinmother-infantpairs
and provide data suggesting that bacteria from mothers’ breast
milk and areolar skin are transferred to their infants’ guts. Key
support for this idea comes from comparisons of bacterial lin-
eages in the infants’ guts with their mothers vs random moth-
ers, which showed more shared lineages in the correct pairs.
Our data do not exclude the possibility that bacteria from in-
fants’ stool seed the mother’s microbiome. It is likely that bac-
teria cycle between the mother and infant in a constant ex-
change. However, we favor the idea that transfer of bacteria
primarily occurs from mother to infant. Breast milk is an early
source of bacteria and nutrition introduced to the infant gut
within a few hours of birth. Bacteria from mother’s milk and
skinaremostprominentintheirinfants’gutsinthefirstmonth
of life, accounting for nearly 40% of the gut bacteria in pri-
marily breastfed infants. Mother to infant microbe transmis-
sion was compromised in infants who were not primarily

A, Among primarily breastfed infants of all ages, 18.5% of the microbial
community found in the stool was derived from breast milk compared with only
5.7% in infants not primarily breastfed (P < .001, Wilcoxon rank sum). Similarly,
5.2% of the infant stool microbial community was derived from areolar bacteria
in those who breastfed more than 75% of the time compared with 0.001% in
infants who breastfed 75% or less of the time (P = .01, Wilcoxon rank sum).
B, Amount of contribution from breast milk to the infant stool was highest during

A, A subset of healthy, vaginally born, exclusively breastfed infants (n = 42) was
used to train a random forest regression model that was then applied to
estimate microbiota maturity. Relative microbiota maturity was calculated by
microbiota age of a child relative to the microbiota age of healthy children of the
same chronologic age from the spline fit line shown here. B, Differences in
relative microbiota maturity based on the age at which solid food was
introduced in our cohort. Early solid food introduction was associated with early
microbiota maturity (<4 months vs �4 months, P = .02; �4 months vs not
introduced, P = .30, Kruskal-Wallis). Boxes indicate the 25th to 75th percentile;

 breastfed. Other sources of the infant microbiome include the
mother’s gut and vaginal bacteria as well as the environment.
In mice, cross-fostering experiments initiated within 48 hours
of birth have shown that the nursing mother, rather than the
birth mother, dictates the infant microbiome composition,
which persists after weaning and for life.26 In the Human Mi-
crobiome Project, Ding and Schloss16 found breastfeeding dur-
ing infancy to be a major life-history characteristic that af-
fects bacterial composition in adults. Early life may represent
a critical window for bacterial imprinting of breast milk bac-
teria leading to nonrandom community assembly.3,27 Our
model showed that the complex ecologic network that forms
during the first 6 months of life is built on interdependent bac-
terial relationships in the infant gut. Breast milk bacteria that
seed the gut first influence and select for bacteria that follow,
leaving a footprint that can be detected even in adulthood.16
Our oligotype analysis indicated that breast milk provides
Veillonella and Rothia, bacteria genera that have been associ-
ated with a lower incidence of asthma.6 These early bacterial
seeding events may be a mechanism by which breastfeeding
protects children.

in our cohort who were not primarily breastfed had a higher
abundance of the Bacteroidaceae, which has been associated
with subsequent obesity in most pediatric studies of early gut
colonization,31-33 although not all studies agreed.34 Erysipelo-

tyrate producers. Butyrate can serve as an energy substrate
or signaling molecule to contribute to the de novo production
of lipids. Firmicutes and butyrate have also been associated
with an obese phenotype in mice and humans.37-39 These
pathways need to be explored further.
Limitations
This study has limitations. We did not sequence communities
from maternal mouth, skin other than areolar, vagina, or stool,
which may have contributed additional bacteria to infants. The
origin of breast milk bacteria is unclear. One hypothesis is that
milk bacteria come from the infant’s oral cavity. We did not col-
lect infant oral specimens. However, we did not see differences
in the microbiota of breast milk by delivery type in our cohort,
as has been similarly reported by other investigators.40 Our re-
cruitmentfocusedonbreastfeedingparticipants,andwedidnot
enroll large numbers of strictly formula-fed infants. Some par-
ticipants were unable to adhere to our longitudinal collection
schedule. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is limited in analy-

PICRUSt to estimate bacterial gene content; because the input
is 16S rRNA gene data, we did not capture any eukaryotic or
viral contributions to the metagenome.24 PICRUSt also cannot
distinguish variation at the strain level and different strains of
1 bacteria can vary in gene counts. Metagenomic shotgun se-
quencing would permit strain and more accurate functional
analysis, but is costly. Finally, we focused on bacterial commu-
nities,yetmilkisacomplexsubstancewithmanybioactivecom-

Conclusions
Our study confirms a bacterial community in breast milk and
tracksthatcommunityfrommothersintotheinfantgut.Breast
milk bacteria influence the establishment and development of
the infant microbiome with continued impact after solid food
introduction.Furthermore,breastmilkcontributesbacteriaas-

ing in the assembly of the infant gut microbiome.
