Effect of a School-Based Water Intervention
on Child Body Mass Index and Obesity
Amy Ellen Schwartz, PhD; Michele Leardo, MA; Siddhartha Aneja, MPA; Brian Elbel, PhD, MPH
IMPORTANCE Decreasing the amount of caloric beverages consumed and simultaneously
increasing water consumption is important to promoting child health and decreasing the
prevalence of childhood obesity.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the impact of water jets (electrically cooled, large clear jugs with a
push lever for fast dispensing) on standardized body mass index, overweight, and obesity in
elementary school and middle school students. Milk purchases were explored as a potential
mechanism for weight outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This quasi-experimental study used a school-level
database of cafeteria equipment deliveries between the 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 and
included a sample of 1227 New York, New York, public elementary schools and middle schools
and the 1 065 562 students within those schools.
INTERVENTION Installation of water jets in schools.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Individual body mass index (BMI) was calculated for all
students in the sample using annual student-level height and weight measurements collected
as part of New York’s FITNESSGRAM initiative. Age- and sex-specific growth charts produced
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to categorize students as
overweight and obese. The hypothesis that water jets would be associated with decreased
standardized BMI, overweight, and obesity was tested using a difference-in-difference
strategy, comparing outcomes for treated and nontreated students before and after the
introduction of a water jet.
RESULTS This study included 1 065 562 students within New York City public elementary
schools and middle schools. There was a significant effect of water jets on standardized BMI,
such that the adoption of water jets was associated with a 0.025 (95% CI, −0.038 to −0.011)
reduction of standardized BMI for boys and a 0.022 (95% CI, −0.035 to −0.008) reduction of
standardized BMI for girls (P < .01). There was also a significant effect on being overweight.
Water jets were associated with a 0.9 percentage point reduction (95% CI, 0.015-0.003) in
the likelihood of being overweight for boys and a 0.6 percentage reduction (95% CI,
0.011-0.000) in the likelihood of being overweight for girls (P < .05). We also found a 12.3
decrease (95% CI, −19.371 to −5.204) in the number of all types of milk half-pints purchased
per student per year (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results from this study show an association between a
relatively low-cost water availability intervention and decreased student weight. Milk
purchases were explored as a potential mechanism. Additional research is needed to examine
potential mechanisms for decreased student weight, including reduced milk taking, as well as
assessing impacts on longer-term outcomes.

ater is essential for human function, prevents de-
hydration, and is critical to a nutritious diet. Water
isalsoahealthyalternativetocaloricbeverages,par-
ticularly sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which have been
linked to childhood obesity.1,2 Previous work suggests that re-
placing SSBs with calorie-free beverages may lead to de-
creased weight gain in children.3,4
Nationally, obesity rates in children are high. In 2012, more
than one-third of children and adolescents were classified as
overweightorobese.5,6InNewYork,NewYork,theobesityrate
of children in kindergarten through eighth grade was 20.7%.7
Childhood obesity has both immediate and long-term effects
on health.8-10 Since 2001, New York has implemented poli-
cies and initiatives to improve the school food environment,
including improving nutrition standards, expanding fruit and
vegetable offerings, removing soda from vending machines,
and replacing whole milk with low-fat milk.11 More specifi-
cally,oneefforttoreduceSSBsinNewYorkschoolswasapolicy
established in the Chancellor’
s Regulations12 prohibiting arti-
ficial flavors, colors, or sweeteners in all beverage vending ma-
chines and limiting beverages to less than 10 cal per 8 oz for
elementary schools and middle schools (less than 25 cal per 8
fl oz for high schools). All schools made this change before the
2009-2010 academic year. These initiatives are part of a large,
multifaceted effort to curb childhood obesity and promote stu-
dent wellness.13,14 Policies or programs to encourage children
to drink water can also play an important role in addressing
childhood obesity.
In 2009, New York’
s Department of Health and Mental Hy-
giene and Department of Education (NYCDOE) launched an in-
tervention to increase access to drinking water at lunchtime
by placing “water jets” in school cafeterias. Water jets are elec-
trically cooled, large, clear jugs with a push lever for fast dis-
pensing that give students access to clean New York tap wa-
ter. Water jet machines both chill the water and oxygenate it
to keep it tasting fresh and cost approximately $1000 per ma-
chine. Plastic disposable cups are also provided by schools for
use with the water jet machines. The water jet intervention al-
lows children to choose water as a calorie-free beverage dur-
ing meal times with the goal that by offering water at lunch at
school, children will both consume more water and learn to
think of water when they are thirsty, reducing the amount of
calories consumed through other beverages. The ultimate goal
is to introduce water jets to all schools over the next several
years.Interviewswithdistrict-andschool-levelpersonnelsug-
gest the specific timing of water jet adoption by a school re-
flects the interaction of opportunity, convenience, and hap-
penstance, rather than systematic targeting.
Previous studies found providing water to students in
schools may be beneficial.15,16 One study on water jets in New
York17 examined water taking before and after water jet instal-
lation in 9 schools and compared them with control schools.
The study found that students whose schools installed water
jets nearly tripled their water taking at lunchtime relative to
control schools. Milk taking was also observed, and de-
creases in consumption were seen in the short term.
Building on previous work,17 the aim of our study was to
examine the effect of the water jets initiative in New York on
student body mass index (BMI), overweight, and obesity. Milk
purchases were explored as a potential mechanism for weight
outcomes.Thisworkaddstotheliteratureonschool-basedwa-
ter interventions and informs future efforts to curb child-
hood obesity.
Methods
Sample
The sample consisted of 1227 New York public elementary
schools and middle schools and the 1 065 562 students within
those schools (3 319 083 observations). We excluded charter
and special education schools from our sample. We also ex-
cluded schools (in a given year) where less than 50% of stu-
dents participated in the New York FITNESSGRAM (NYCDOE)
(only 1.6% of kindergarten through eighth-grade student
observations) and students with missing New York
FITNESSGRAM data (4.1% of students in schools not dropped
owing to low New York FITNESSGRAM coverage). Using a
school-level database of cafeteria equipment deliveries be-
tween the 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 academic years pro-
vided by the NYCDOE Office of School Food, we determined
if and when a school received a water jet. Of 1227 schools, 483
received a water jet (39.3%) and 744 did not (60.7%).
Study procedures were approved by both New York Uni-
versity and NYCDOE institutional review boards. No indi-
vidual consent was required for this analysis of deidentified
administrative data.
Measures, Research Design, and Statistical Analysis
BMI (Standardized BMI)
Individual BMI was calculated for all students in our sample as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. New
York schools have conducted the New York FITNESSGRAM an-
nually for all students in kindergarten through 12th grade since
the 2005-2006 academic year as part of the standards-based
physical education program.18 Physical education teachers,
trained on measurement protocols as part of the New York FIT-
NESSGRAM initiative, collected data on height and weight.
Physical education teachers’measures of student height and
weight for school-based BMI screenings have previously been

standard formula (weight/height)×703. We standardized BMI

ber of children (< 0.1%) with biologically implausible values of
BMI, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion as more than 5 SDs away from the mean, were excluded
from our analysis.21
Overweight
We used age- and sex-specific growth charts produced by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to categorize stu-
dents as overweight (≥85th BMI percentile).21
Obese
We used age- and sex-specific growth charts produced by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to categorize stu-
dents as obese (≥95th BMI percentile).21 Students classified as
obese are a subset of those classified as overweight.
Demographics
Baseline demographic variables were collected from a richly
detailed administrative data set for all students in New York
public schools between the 2007-2008 and 2012-2013 aca-
demic years. Variables included the number of students en-
rolled in each school and percentages of students eligible for
free or reduced-price meals, learning English as a second lan-
guage, enrolled in special education, female, foreign born, His-
panic, white, black, and Asian.
Milk Purchases
Weobtaineddataonmilkpurchasesbetweenthe2010-2011and
2012-2013 academic years from the NYCDOE Office of School
Food,includingannualmilkpurchasespercafeteria/kitchen,total
and by type (low-fat [1%] white, skim white, fat-free chocolate,
and whole). Very few schools (6.6% by 2013) purchased whole
milk after NYCDOE acted to eliminate whole milk from school
cafeterias during the 2005-2006 academic year.22 Those few
schoolsthatofferedwholemilkarepredominatelyschoolsserv-
ing special education students. Because milk purchases are re-
cordedbykitchen,itisimpossibletoseparatelyidentifypurchases
forschoolssharingkitchens.In2013,forexample,42.5%ofkitch-
ens serving elementary schools and middle schools provided
meals for more than 1 school. Thus, we limited our analysis of
milk purchases to elementary schools and middle schools not
sharing kitchen facilities.
Research Design
ToexaminetheeffectofwaterjetsonstudentBMI,overweight,
and obesity, we used a difference-in-difference strategy, com-
paringoutcomesfortreatedandnontreatedstudentsbeforeand
after exposure, exploiting the staggered introduction of water
jets. We identified a student as being “treated” by a water jet if
he or she spent 60 or more cumulative school days in a school
with a water jet. These estimates should be interpreted as “in-
tenttotreat”becausewedidnotidentifywhetherorhowmuch
an individual student used the water jet.
To estimate the effect of water jets on milk purchases, we
again used a difference-in-difference strategy to identify
changes in milk purchases between schools that had a water
jet and schools that did not have a water jet, before and after
introduction of a water jet. We defined water jet schools as
those having a water jet for 3 or more months, roughly 60
school days. We examined 3 separate outcomes: total milk,
chocolate milk, and low-fat and skim white milk. Total milk
included all milk types, including whole milk. Chocolate milk
served in New York schools is fat-free, and was estimated sepa-
rately because it is sweetened and flavored. Low-fat and skim
white milk were estimated together.
Statistical Analysis
School-level characteristics for water jet schools vs non–
water jet schools were compared using t tests. To estimate the
effect of water jets on zBMI, we first used an ordinary least
squares model controlling for student characteristics and
school (school fixed effects). We used a second ordinary least
squares model with student fixed effects to control for indi-
vidual student changes in each year. The same set of models
was used to estimate the effect of water jets on overweight and
obesity,againusingalinearprobabilitymodelwithschoolfixed
effects and then with student fixed effects. We estimated all
models separately by sex. We presented the main effect of in-
troducing a water jet over and above any change over time for
schools that did not introduce the water jet.
Toestimatetheeffectofwaterjetsonmilkpurchasesperstu-
dent, we used an ordinary least squares model with 3 separate
specifications. The first model included year fixed effects, the
secondaddsschoolfixedeffects,andthethirdaddstime-varying
school characteristics (share of students by race, sex, eligibility
for free and reduced lunch, special education status, English
language–learner status, and total enrollment). While ordinary
leastsquaresmodelsprovidedalinearapproximationtotheav-
erage marginal effects,23 we also estimated logistic regression
models with similar results (not shown). Analyses were con-
ducted with Stata 12 statistical software (StataCorp), and stan-
dard errors were clustered at the school level.
Results
Prevalence of Water Jets
By policy design, water jets in New York increased over time
during our analysis period, and machines were often placed
in schools in waves (Figure). The water jet intervention be-
gan with a pilot of 5 school cafeterias in the 2008-2009 aca-
demic year. By the 2012-2013 academic year, roughly two-
thirds of NYCDOE elementary schools and middle schools had
a water jet machine installed in the cafeteria.

Estimating the Impact of Water Jets
Standardized BMI
Table 2 shows the effect of water jets on our 3 outcomes of in-
terest.TherewasasignificantmaineffectofwaterjetsonzBMI,
suchthattheadoptionofwaterjetswasassociatedwitha0.025
(95% CI, −0.038 to −0.011) reduction of zBMI for boys and a
0.022 (95% CI, −0.035 to −0.008) reduction for girls (P < .01)
in the specification with school fixed effects. In the specifica-
tion with student fixed effects, there was a significant main
effect on zBMI for boys but not for girls. The adoption of wa-
ter jets was associated with a 0.017 (95% CI, 0.034-0.001) re-
duction of zBMI for boys (P = .04).
Overweight
There was also a significant main effect of water jets on over-
weight,suchthattheadoptionofwaterjetswasassociatedwith
a 0.9 percentage point reduction (95% CI, −0.015 to −0.003)
in the likelihood of being overweight for boys (P < .01) and 0.6
percentage point reduction (95% CI, −0.011 to 0.000) for girls
(P < .05) in the specification with school fixed effects. In the
specification with student fixed effects, there was a 1.2 per-
centage point reduction (95% CI, −0.019 to −0.005) in the like-
lihood of being overweight for boys (P < .01) and 0.6 percent-
age point reduction (95% CI, −0.013 to −0.001) for girls (P < .1).
Obese
There was a significant main effect of water jets on obesity for
males (β = −0.005; 95% CI, −0.010 to −0.001; P = .02) in our
school fixed-effects model that did not reach statistical sig-
nificance in our student fixed-effects models (β = −0.005;
95% CI, −0.010 to −0.001; P = .08). There was a negative but
not significant main effect of water jets on obesity for girls
(β = −0.003; 95% CI, −0.007 to 0.001; P= .15 in the school
fixed-effects model and β = −0.002; 95% CI, −0.007 to 0.001;
P= .55 in the student fixed-effects model).
Milk Purchases
Table 3 displays results of the school-level analysis that ex-
aminestheeffectofwaterjetsonmilkpurchasesfromthe2010-
2011 to 2012-2013 academic years in schools that had a water
jet for 3 or more months, corresponding to roughly 60 school
days. There was a 12.3 decrease (95% CI, −19.371 to −5.204) in
the number of half-pints of all milk types purchased per stu-
dent per year (P < .01). Estimating separately by milk type re-
vealed a significant effect of water jets on fat-free chocolate
milk purchases, but not on low-fat and skim white milk pur-
chases. We found a 13.6 decrease (95% CI, −19.796 to −7.435)
in fat-free chocolate milk half-pints purchased per student per
year (P < .01) and a 1.4 decrease (95% CI, −4.437 to 7.186) in
low-fat and skim white milk purchased per student per year,
albeit insignificant (P = .64). Adding school characteristics
yielded similar results. (Schools did not differentially change
the availability of chocolate milk after introducing the water
jet;resultsnotshown.)Addingschoolfixedeffectsyieldedsimi-
lar coefficients. Results are robust to expanding our water jet
treatment group to include schools with shorter experiences
with water jets. For example, expanding the water jet treat-
ment group (schools with water jets for 3 months or more) to
includeschoolswithwaterjetsfor2to3months(roughly40-60
school days) yields similar results.
Discussion
The goal of this study was to estimate the impact of water jets
on zBMI, overweight, and obesity in elementary school and
middle school students. Analyses revealed that zBMI and over-
weight decreased significantly for boys, and zBMI and over-
weight also decreased significantly for girls. Results attenu-
ated with student fixed effects. Including student fixed effects
means the effects were estimated using comparisons across
the same student over time (rather than comparing the same

schools). This is a conservative estimation strategy, eliminat-
ing the possibility that results were driven by changes in
student characteristics or other unobservable changes in stu-
dents. The impact of water jets on milk purchases was esti-
mated to examine a possible mechanism for weight out-
comes. Findings showed a decrease in milk purchases,
particularly chocolate milk, per student after water jets were
adopted. Examining elementary schools and middle schools
separately did not alter conclusions.
The water jets initiative is spreading across New York,
aimed at promoting student health and decreasing the inci-
dence of childhood obesity. With a one-time cost of about
$1000 per machine, water jets are a relatively low-cost inter-
vention that may reach all NYCDOE schools within a few

increased availability of water and classroom education, the
likelihood of overweight was significantly decreased. Our
study adds to the evidence that school-based water inter-
ventions on their own may have positive impacts on student
weight.
We included milk purchases in our analyses to explore a
potential mechanism to explain the association between wa-
ter jets and decreased student weight. While milk is pro-
moted as a healthy beverage for children, and arguably has
many positive nutritional qualities, it still contains calories. All
chocolate milk contains sugar, both from the naturally occur-
ring sugar lactose and from added sugar. One half-pint of fat-
freechocolatemilktypicallycontainsabout20gofsugar,about
half of which is added sugar. The total amount of sugar in
chocolate milk is roughly half that of other SSBs, such as a can
of brown cola, which contains about 40 g of sugar.24-26 This
studyfoundsignificantdecreasesinfat-freechocolatemilkpur-
chases with the introduction of water jets, suggesting that milk
is a reasonable mechanism for decreased BMI and over-
weight. A plausible explanation for our finding that choco-
late milk alone decreased is that some children might not like
white milk, and when given the option for chocolate choose
that instead. When water is then introduced, they switch away
from chocolate milk and toward water.
Another potential mechanism is that students consumed
fewerSSBsbroughtfromoutsideschool,includingsugaryjuice
or soda. This may also explain the stronger results found for
boys than girls. Work by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention examining beverage intake among high school stu-
dents found that boys consume more beverages than girls, in-
cluding SSBs.27 If boys in our study consumed more SSBs, re-
placing those beverages with water may have yielded stronger
effects for this group.
Two important data limitations are relevant. First, we used
administrative data on water jet delivery and did not observe
use in the cafeteria. However, water jet machines are rela-
tively easy to use17 and no installation is required, and dis-
trict personnel believe schools typically begin using water jets
immediately after delivery. Second, we also used administra-
tive data on kitchen-level milk purchases and lack data on milk
consumption. Although it is likely that milk purchases are
highly correlated with consumption, as the NYCDOE is moti-
vated to eliminate waste, we did not observe consumption or
waste directly. We had no data on which beverages students
consume in school. According to New York vending and com-
petitive food policies in place since the 2009-2010 academic
year, elementary school and middle school vending ma-
chines only offer beverages with less than 10 cal per 8 oz.12 No
district-wide policies regulate whether students are permit-
tedtobringotherbeveragestoschool,however.Waterjetswere
not randomly assigned, but spread across a large number of
schoolsaspartofadistrictinitiative.Finally,wehave1lessyear
of milk data than water jets and BMI data. However, analyses
using data for the overlap years are substantively unchanged.

Conclusions
Decreasing the amount of caloric beverages consumed and si-
multaneously increasing water consumption is important to
promoting child health and decreasing the prevalence of child-
hood obesity. Moreover, schools are a natural setting for such
interventions, and many policy makers are turning attention
topromotingwaterdrinkingamongstudents.Resultsfromthis
study show an association between a relatively low-cost wa-
ter availability intervention and decreased student weight. Ad-
ditional research is needed to examine potential mechanisms
for decreased student weight, including reduced milk taking,
as well as assessing impacts on longer-term outcomes. Water
jets could be an important part of the toolkit for obesity re-
duction techniques at the school setting.
