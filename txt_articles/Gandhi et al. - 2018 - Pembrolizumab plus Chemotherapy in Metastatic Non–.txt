BACKGROUND
First-line therapy for advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that lacks 
targetable mutations is platinum-based chemotherapy. Among patients with a tumor 
proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembro-
lizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of choice. 
The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher 
rates of response and longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone in 
a phase 2 trial.
METHODS
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 616 patients 
with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who 
had received no previous treatment for metastatic disease to receive pemetrexed 
and a platinum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of 
35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab mono-
therapy was permitted among the patients in the placebo-combination group who 
had verified disease progression. The primary end points were overall survival and 
progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the estimated rate of overall survival at 
12 months was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-
combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001). 
Improvement in overall survival was seen across all PD-L1 categories that were 
evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) in the 
placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 
95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2% 
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 65.8% of those in 
the placebo-combination group.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without 
EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy 
of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantly longer overall 
survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by Merck;

Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Metastatic NSCLC
I
nhibitors of programmed death 1 (PD-1) 
and its ligand PD-L1 are effective therapies for 
metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
lacking sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations. Pem-
brolizumab (Keytruda, Merck), nivolumab (Opdivo, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb), and atezolizumab (Tecen-
triq, Genentech) are approved as second-line ther-
apy. Among patients in whom the percentage of 
tumor cells with membranous PD-L1 staining 
(tumor proportion score) is 50% or greater, pem-
brolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy 
as the first-line treatment of choice. However, pa-
tients with a tumor proportion score of 50% or 
greater represent a minority of those with NSCLC. 
Because patients with advanced NSCLC can un-
dergo rapid clinical deterioration during disease 
progression, less than one half of patients with 
advanced NSCLC ever receive second-line therapy.1,2 
First-line combination regimens that include a 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor may maximize the chance 
of response and lead to prolonged survival. Modu-
lation of the immune response through PD-1 inhi-
bition may be enhanced by the potential immuno-
genic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as 
increasing the potential for antigen cross-presen-
tation by dendritic cells after the destruction of 
tumor cells,3 inhibiting myeloid-derived suppres-
sor cells,4 increasing the ratio of cytotoxic lym-
phocytes to regulatory T cells,5 and blocking the 
STAT6 pathway to enhance dendritic-cell activity.6
A randomized, phase 2 trial of carboplatin plus 
pemetrexed (Alimta, Eli Lilly) with or without 
pembrolizumab showed significantly better rates 
of response and longer progression-free survival 
with the addition of pembrolizumab than with 
chemotherapy alone.7 In the global, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial, 
we compared the combination of pemetrexed and 
a platinum-based drug plus either pembrolizumab 
or placebo in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC 
with any level of PD-L1 expression.
Methods
Patients
Patients who were at least 18 years of age were 
eligible for enrollment if they had pathologically 
confirmed metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with-
out sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations; had re-
ceived no previous systemic therapy for metastatic 
disease; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 
1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicat-
ing increasing disability)8; had at least one mea-
surable lesion according to the Response Evalu-
ation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 
1.19; and had provided a tumor sample for deter-
mination of PD-L1 status. Patients were excluded 
if they had symptomatic central nervous system 
metastases, had a history of noninfectious pneu-
monitis that required the use of glucocorticoids, 
had active autoimmune disease, or were receiv-
ing systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Be-
cause of an increased risk of pneumonitis,10 pa-
tients were also excluded if they had received 
more than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung in 
the previous 6 months. Full eligibility criteria are 
listed in the trial protocol, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatment
In this double-blind trial, patients were randomly 
assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either 200 mg of 
pembrolizumab or saline placebo, both adminis-
tered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cy-
cles. Randomization was performed by means of 
an integrated interactive voice-response and Web-
response system (i.e., treatment assignments could 
be provided by following a series of prompts on 
a touch-tone phone or by following the same 
prompts in a Web-based portal). Randomization 
was stratified according to PD-L1 expression 
(tumor proportion score, ≥1% vs. <1%), choice of 
platinum-based drug (cisplatin vs. carboplatin), 
and smoking history (never vs. former or current).
All the patients received four cycles of the 
investigator’s choice of intravenously adminis-
tered cisplatin (75 mg per square meter of body-
surface area) or carboplatin (area under the con-
centration–time curve, 5 mg per milliliter per 
minute) plus pemetrexed (500 mg per square me-
ter), all administered intravenously every 3 weeks, 
followed by pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter) 
every 3 weeks. All the patients received premedica-
tion with folic acid, vitamin B12, and glucocorti-
coids administered according to local guidelines 
for pemetrexed use.
Treatment was continued until radiographic 
progression, unacceptable toxic effects, investiga-
tor decision, or patient withdrawal of consent. If 
toxicity was clearly attributed to one agent, that 
drug alone could be discontinued. Patients in the 
placebo-combination group in whom disease pro-
gression was verified by blinded, independent 
central radiologic review were eligible to cross over 
to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy. Addi-

tional details regarding treatment decisions, in-
cluding the management of adverse events, are 
provided in the protocol.
Assessments
PD-L1 expression was assessed during screening 
at a central laboratory by means of the PD-L1 IHC 
22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent) in formalin-fixed 
tumor samples obtained by core-needle or exci-
sional biopsy or from tissue resected at the time 
that metastatic disease was diagnosed. Expression 
was categorized according to the tumor propor-
tion score (i.e., the percentage of tumor cells 
with membranous PD-L1 staining).11 Investigators, 
patients, and representatives of the sponsor were 
unaware of the patients’ tumor proportion scores. 
Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were 
graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 4.0. Tumor imaging was scheduled for 
weeks 6 and 12, then every 9 weeks through 
week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response 
was assessed according to RECIST, version 1.1.9 
Patients were contacted every 12 weeks to assess 
survival during follow-up.
End Points
The two primary end points were overall survival 
(time from randomization to death from any cause) 
and progression-free survival (time from random-
ization to disease progression, as assessed by 
blinded, independent central radiologic review, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurred first). 
The secondary end points were the response rate 
(the percentage of patients with a confirmed com-
plete or partial response), the duration of response 
(time from first documented complete or partial 
response to disease progression or death), and 
safety. Both the response rate and the duration of 
response were assessed by blinded, independent 
central radiologic review. Exploratory end points 
included the effect of PD-L1 expression on effi-
cacy and patient-reported outcomes. The full list 
of end points and the statistical analysis plan are 
available in the protocol.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by a panel of academic 
advisors and employees of Merck (in Kenilworth, 
New Jersey), the trial sponsor. An external moni-
toring committee oversaw the trial and assessed 
efficacy and safety at prespecified interim analy-
ses. The trial protocol and all amendments were 
approved by the appropriate ethics panel at each 
center. All the patients provided written informed 
consent before enrollment. Eli Lilly provided the 
pemetrexed but otherwise had no role in the trial.
All the authors attest that the trial was con-
ducted in accordance with the protocol and all 
its amendments and with Good Clinical Practice 
standards. All the authors had access to the data 
and participated in the writing or reviewing and 
editing of the manuscript. The first draft of the 
manuscript was written by the first author with 
input from authors employed by the sponsor. As-
sistance in the preparation of the manuscript was 
provided by a medical writer employed by the 
sponsor. The investigators agreed to keep all as-
pects of the trial confidential. All the authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat 
population, which included all the patients who 
had undergone randomization. Safety was as-
sessed in the as-treated population, which included 
all patients who had undergone randomization 
and received at least one dose of the assigned com-
bination therapy. The Kaplan–Meier method was 
used to estimate overall and progression-free sur-
vival. Data for patients who were alive or lost to 
follow-up were censored for overall survival at 
the time they were last known to be alive; data 
for patients who crossed over were not censored 
at the time of crossover. Data for patients who 
were alive and did not have disease progression 
or who were lost to follow-up were censored for 
the analysis of progression-free survival at the 
time of the last imaging assessment. The strati-
fied log-rank test was used to assess between-
group differences in overall and progression-free 
survival. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confi-
dence intervals were calculated with the use of a 
stratified Cox proportional-hazards model and 
Efron’s method for handling tied events to assess 
the magnitude of the treatment difference. Dif-
ferences in response rate were assessed with the 
stratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen. The 
randomization stratification factors were applied 
to all stratified efficacy analyses.
The full statistical analysis plan specified the 
performance of two interim analyses and a final 
analysis. The family-wise type I error rate was 
strictly controlled at a one-sided alpha level of 
0.025 with the use of the graphical method of

Other histologic features include large-cell carcinoma (5 patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 2 in 
the placebo-combination group), adenosquamous tumors (2 patients in the placebo-combination group), and other 
nonsquamous tumor (1 patient in the pembrolizumab-combination group).

The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score was defined as the percentage of tumor cells with 
membranous PD-L1 expression.
‖  
PD-L1 expression could not be evaluated because specimens had an inadequate number of tumor cells or no tumor 
cells. For stratification purposes, patients with PD-L1 expression that could not be evaluated were included in the sub-
group with a tumor proportion score of less than 1%; these patients were excluded from analyses of efficacy according 
to the PD-L1 tumor proportion score.

Maurer and Bretz (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). If a significant 
benefit with regard to one of the primary end 
points was found in the pembrolizumab-combina-
tion group, the corresponding alpha level would 
be rolled over for testing of the other primary end 
point. The Lan–DeMets O’Brien–Fleming spending 
function was used to control the type I error in 
the interim and final analyses.
We determined that the trial would have a 
power of 90% to show a hazard ratio for disease 
progression or death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.0095 (based on 468 events) and a hazard 
ratio of 0.70 for death at a one-sided alpha level 
of 0.0155 (based on 416 deaths) for the compari-
son between the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and the placebo-combination group. The 
planned enrollment was 570 patients.
The first interim analysis was to be performed 
after enrollment was complete and approximately 
370 events of progression or death had occurred; 
it was estimated that approximately 242 deaths 
would have occurred at this time. As of Novem-
ber 8, 2017, there were 410 events of disease pro-
gression or death and 235 deaths. On the basis of 
the observed number of events, the multiplicity-
adjusted, one-sided alpha levels at the first in-
terim analysis were 0.00559 for progression-free 
survival and 0.00128 for overall survival. Results 
were reviewed by the external monitoring com-
mittee on January 10, 2018. The monitoring com-
mittee reported that the efficacy boundaries for 
overall survival and progression-free survival had 
been met. The trial is continuing in order to evalu-
ate outcomes with additional follow-up. All data 
reported here are based on the first interim 
analysis.
Results
Patients and Treatment
A total of 965 patients were screened for enroll-
ment at 126 sites in 16 countries (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Between February 26, 
2016, and March 6, 2017, a total of 616 patients 
from 118 sites who had met all the eligibility crite-
ria were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab-
combination group (410 patients) or the placebo-
combination group (206 patients). The baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics were gen-
erally well balanced between the groups, although 
the percentage of men was higher in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group than in the placebo-
combination group (62.0% vs. 52.9%, P 
= 
0.04) 
(Table 1). A PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 1% 
or greater was reported in 63.0% of the patients, 
carboplatin was the chosen platinum-based drug 
in 72.2% of the patients, and 88.1% of the patients 
were current or former smokers.
Of the 616 patients who were enrolled, 405 in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 202 in 
the placebo-combination group received at least 
one dose of the assigned combination therapy. 
With a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range, 
0.2 to 20.4), the mean (±SD) duration of treatment 
was 7.4±4.7 months in the pembrolizumab-com-
bination group and 5.4±4.3 months in the placebo-
combination group. All four planned doses of 
cisplatin or carboplatin were received by 82.5% 
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combina-
tion group and by 74.3% of those in the placebo-
combination group; 76.5% and 66.8%, respec-
tively, received five or more doses of pemetrexed. 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix shows 
the exposure to treatment in patients who received 
carboplatin and in those who received cisplatin.)
At the time of the data cutoff in the as-treated 
population, 137 of 405 patients (33.8%) in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group and 36 of 
202 patients (17.8%) in the placebo-combination 
group were still receiving the assigned treatment 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the 
intention-to-treat population, 125 of 410 patients 
(30.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group 
and 96 of 206 patients (46.6%) in the placebo-
combination group had received at least one sub-
sequent therapy either while continuing to partici-
pate in the trial or outside the trial (Table S2 in 
Figure 1 (facing page). Overall Survival in the  
Intention-to-Treat Population.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival 
(the first of the two primary end points) in the two tri-
al groups (Panel A) and an analysis of overall survival 
in key subgroups (Panel B). Patients in the pembroli-
zumab-combination group received pemetrexed, a 
platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab; those in 
the placebo-combination group received pemetrexed, 
a platinum-based drug, and placebo. Tick marks in 
Panel A indicate censoring of data at the last time the 
patient was known to be alive. Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status scores 
range from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 
higher scores indicating increasing disability. PD-L1 
denotes programmed death ligand 1.

an effective crossover rate of 41.3% in the inten-
tion-to-treat population and 50.0% in the 170 pa-
tients who had discontinued all trial drugs. The 
effective crossover rate in the intention-to-treat 
population was similar across the subgroups of 
PD-L1 tumor proportion score.
Overall Survival
With 235 deaths in the intention-to-treat popula-
tion, the estimated proportion of patients who 
were alive at 12 months was 69.2% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group and 49.4% (95% CI, 
42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-combination group. 
The median overall survival was not reached in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group and was 
11.3 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 15.1) in the placebo-
combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 
95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). The 
benefit of the pembrolizumab combination was 
observed in all subgroups that were analyzed 
(Fig. 1B), including those with a PD-L1 tumor pro-
portion score of less than 1% (12-month overall 
survival rate, 61.7% vs. 52.2%; hazard ratio for 
death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.92), a score of 1 to 
49% (12-month overall survival rate, 71.5% vs. 
50.9%; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.90), 
and a score of 50% or greater (12-month overall 
survival rate, 73.0% vs. 48.1%; hazard ratio, 0.42; 
95% CI, 0.26 to 0.68) (Fig. 2).
Progression-free Survival
With 410 events of progression or death, the 
median progression-free survival was 8.8 months 
(95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in the pembrolizumab-com-
bination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) 
in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for 
progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 3A). The estimated proportion of 
patients who were alive and progression-free at 
12 months was 34.1% (95% CI, 28.8 to 39.5) in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 17.3% 
(95% CI, 12.0 to 23.5) in the placebo-combination 
group. The results were similar when progression 
was assessed according to investigator review 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The haz-
ard ratio for progression-free survival was less than 
1.00 across all subgroups that were analyzed 
(Fig. 3B) and across all subgroups of PD-L1 tu-
mor proportion score (Fig. 4), although the up-
per boundaries of the 95% confidence intervals 
crossed 1.00 for patients who were 65 years or 
older (median, 9.0 months vs. 6.7 months; hazard 
ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.02) and those with 
a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of less than 1% 
(median, 6.1 months vs. 5.1 months; hazard ratio, 
0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.05).
Tumor Response
The response rate as assessed by blinded, indepen-
dent central radiologic review was 47.6% (95% CI, 
42.6 to 52.5) in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and 18.9% (95% CI, 13.8 to 25.0) in the 
placebo-combination group (P<0.001). The results 
were similar when the response was assessed by 
investigator review (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The disease control rate (the proportion 
of patients with a confirmed complete or partial 
response or stable disease) was 84.6% in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group and 70.4% 
in the placebo-combination group. The change 
from baseline in the sum of the longest diame-
ters of target lesions is shown in Figure S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
The median duration of response was 11.2 
months (range, 1.1+ to 18.0+) in the pembrolizum-
ab-combination group and 7.8 months (range, 2.1+ 
to 16.4+) in the placebo-combination group. (Plus 
signs in the ranges indicate that there was no 
progressive disease at the time of the last disease 
assessment.) The response rate was higher in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group than in the 
placebo-combination group across all categories of 
PD-L1 tumor proportion score, with the greatest 
between-group difference in patients with a tumor 
proportion score of 50% or greater (61.4% vs. 
22.9%) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).

PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival 
in patients with a tumor proportion score of less than 
1% (Panel A), a score of 1 to 49% (Panel B), or a score

fit was observed in the subgroup with a PD-L1 tumor 
proportion score of 50% or greater, a finding that was 
consistent with the results of previous studies. Tick 
marks indicate censoring of data at the last time the 
patient was known to be alive.

Adverse Events
Adverse events of any cause and regardless of at-
tribution to treatment by the investigator occurred 
in 99.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-
combination group and in 99.0% of those in the 
placebo-combination group (Table 2). These events 
were of grade 3 or higher in 67.2% and 65.8% of 
the patients, respectively. Discontinuation of all 
trial drugs because of adverse events occurred in 
13.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-
combination group and in 7.9% of those in the 
placebo-combination group; discontinuation rates 
of pembrolizumab and placebo were 20.2% and 
10.4%, respectively (Table 2). The rates of adverse 
events were similar in patients who received car-
boplatin and cisplatin (Tables S4 and S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Adverse events led to 
death in 27 of 405 patients (6.7%) in the pem-
brolizumab-combination group and in 12 of 202 
patients (5.9%) in the placebo-combination group.
In the two groups, the most common adverse 
events were nausea, anemia, and fatigue (Table 2; 
exposure-adjusted rates are provided in Table S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The only adverse 
events that were reported in at least 10% of the 
patients that were more frequent in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group were diarrhea and 
rash (Fig. S6A in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were re-
ported in at least 10% of the patients in the pem-
brolizumab-combination group or the placebo-
combination group were anemia (16.3% and 15.3%) 
and neutropenia (15.8% and 11.9%) (Table 2). The 
only adverse event of grade 3 or higher that was 
more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combina-
tion group was febrile neutropenia (Fig. S6B in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Acute kidney injury 
occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab-
combination group than in the placebo-combi-
nation group (5.2% vs. 0.5%). In the pembroli-
zumab-combination group, acute kidney injury 
was of grade 3 or higher in 8 patients (2.0%) and 
led to the discontinuation of all trial therapy in 
8 patients (2.0%); at the time of this analysis, acute 
kidney injury of grade 3 or lower had resolved or 
was resolving in 9 of 19 patients.
Immune-mediated adverse events, which were 
defined on the basis of a list of terms specified 
by the sponsor and were included in the analysis 
regardless of whether they were attributed to treat-
ment by the investigator, occurred in 92 of 405 
patients (22.7%) in the pembrolizumab-combi-
nation group and in 24 of 202 patients (11.9%) 
in the placebo-combination group (Table 3). These 
events were of grade 3 or higher in 36 of 405 pa-
tients (8.9%) and 9 of 202 patients (4.5%), respec-
tively. Three immune-mediated adverse events (all 
pneumonitis) led to death in the pembrolizumab-
combination group.
Discussion
In this phase 3 trial, we found that adding pem-
brolizumab to standard chemotherapy with peme-
trexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in a risk 
of the two primary end points that was approxi-
mately 50% lower than the risks with standard 
chemotherapy alone in patients with untreated, 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensi-
tizing EGFR or ALK mutations. Together with the 
results from KEYNOTE-024,12,13 the data from 
KEYNOTE-189 suggest that introducing immuno-
therapy as a first-line therapy may have a favorable 
long-term effect on outcomes.
The survival benefit associated with the pem-
brolizumab combination was observed in all sub-
groups of PD-L1 tumor proportion scores, in-
cluding patients with a score of less than 1%, a 
population for which single-agent PD-1 and PD-L1 
inhibition have a small chance of benefit.12,14-19 The 
greatest relative benefit was observed in the sub-
group with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 
50% or greater, a finding that was consistent with 
the results of previous studies of PD-1 pathway 
inhibition in advanced NSCLC.14,15,20,21 An impor-
tant question for further study is whether the 
addition of pembrolizumab to pemetrexed and a 
platinum-based drug has greater efficacy than 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in these patients. 
Without direct comparisons, physicians and pa-
tients will need to have an individualized discus-
sion of benefit.22
Although the outcomes in the placebo-combi-
nation group appeared to be poorer than those in 
patients who had received pemetrexed and a plati-
num-based drug in some historical studies,23-25 the 
rates of disease control and progression-free sur-
vival were consistent with those in many landmark 
studies.12,26-29 The median overall survival in our 
trial may change with longer follow-up because 
there was substantial censoring of the Kaplan–
Meier curves around the time that the medians 
were reached in this analysis. As expected in the 
era of immunotherapy, the survival curves in the

Listed are all adverse events that occurred during the trial period or within 30 days thereafter (within 90 days for serious events), regardless 
of attribution to any trial treatment by the investigator. Adverse events that occurred during crossover from the placebo-combination group 
to pembrolizumab monotherapy are excluded. The as-treated population included all the patients who had undergone randomization and 
received at least one dose of the assigned combination therapy.
†  
This category includes patients who discontinued pemetrexed, a platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab or placebo because of an ad-
verse event at any time and patients who discontinued pemetrexed and pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing 
four cycles of a platinum-based drug.
‡  
Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event.
§  
The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were pneumonitis in 3 patients; intestinal ischemia in 2 pa-
tients; and acute kidney injury, acute kidney injury plus neutropenic sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrest plus respiratory failure, cardiac fail-
ure, cardiopulmonary failure, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, encephalopathy, hemoptysis, ischemic stroke, lung 
infection, mesenteric-artery embolism, myocardial infarction, neutropenic sepsis, peritonitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, pneumonia, 
and septic shock in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death in the place-
bo-combination group were cerebral hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemoptysis, intracranial hemorrhage, hypokale-
mia plus supraventricular tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonia plus respiratory failure, renal failure, 
respiratory failure, and septic shock in 1 patient each; 1 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause.

The addition of pembrolizumab did not ap-
pear to increase the frequency of adverse events 
that are commonly associated with chemotherapy 
regimens involving pemetrexed and a platinum-
based drug. Similarly, the incidence of most im-
mune-mediated adverse events was not higher 
with pembrolizumab-combination therapy than 
that previously observed with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy.12,14,20 The exception may be nephritis 
and acute kidney injury, both of which are also 
associated with pemetrexed30 and platinum-based 
drugs31 and occurred with a greater frequency in 
this trial than in earlier trials of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy.12,14,20 The frequency of deaths attrib-
uted to pneumonitis in this trial was consistent 
with the frequency previously observed with pem-
brolizumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC.12,14,20
In conclusion, in patients with metastatic non-
squamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or 
ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab 
to induction therapy with pemetrexed and a 
platinum-based drug and to pemetrexed mainte-
nance therapy resulted in significantly longer 
overall survival and progression-free survival and 
a higher response rate than the addition of pla-
cebo at a cost of a low incidence of renal dysfunc-
tion at the first interim analysis. The survival 
benefit for pembrolizumab-combination therapy 
was observed across all categories of PD-L1 ex-
pression.

The events of interest are those with an immune-related cause and are considered regardless of attribution to a trial 
drug by the investigator. The events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group. In addition to the specific preferred terms that are listed, related terms were also included. The as-treated popu-
lation included all the patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned com-
bination therapy.
