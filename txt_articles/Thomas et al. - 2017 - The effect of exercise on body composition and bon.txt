Objective: This study examined the effect of 12 months of aerobic and resistance exercise versus usual
care on changes in body composition in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors taking aromatase inhib-
itors (AIs).
Methods: The Hormones and Physical Exercise study enrolled 121 breast cancer survivors and random-
ized them to either supervised twice-weekly resistance exercise training and 150 min/wk of aerobic exer-
cise (N 5 61) or a usual care (N 5 60) group. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were conducted
at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to assess changes in body mass index, percent body fat, lean
body mass, and bone mineral density.
Results: At 12 months, the exercise group relative to the usual care group had a significant increase in
lean body mass (0.32 vs. 20.88 kg, P 5 0.03), a decrease in percent body fat (21.4% vs. 0.48%, P 5
0.03), and a decrease in body mass index (20.73 vs. 0.17 kg/m2, P 5 0.03). Change in bone mineral
density was not significantly different between groups at 12 months (0.001 vs. 20.006 g/cm2, P 5 0.37).
Conclusions: A combined resistance and aerobic exercise intervention improved body composition in
breast cancer survivors taking AIs. Exercise interventions may help to mitigate the negative side effects
of AIs and improve health outcomes in breast cancer survivors.

Introduction
Breast
cancer
is
the
most
common
cancer
diagnosis
among
American women, accounting for 30% of cancer diagnoses with an
estimated 231,840 invasive cases diagnosed in 2015, as well as an
estimated 60,290 additional cases of in situ breast cancer (1).
Approximately 65% of all breast cancer survivors are overweight or
have obesity as defined by a body mass index (BMI) ï¿½25 kg/m2
(2,3), and few breast cancer survivors exercise at recommended lev-
els of physical activity (4,5). Not only are obesity and sedentary
lifestyle believed to cause between 25% and 33% of all breast can-
cer cases (6), these risk factors are also associated with poorer out-
comes after diagnosis, in both pre- and postmenopausal breast can-
cer, and a significant increase in recurrence and elevated total
mortality (1). Findings from a recent meta-analysis showed that in
comparison with lean participants, participants with obesity had a
35% higher risk of breast cancer-related death and a 41% higher
risk of all-cause mortality (7). Additionally, breast cancer treatment
is related to increases in body fat as well as decreases in lean body
mass (LBM) and bone mineral density (BMD) (8,9). These changes

Obesity
 can put these women at increased risk for frailty fractures and osteo-
porosis, as well as further risk for comorbid chronic disease and
cancer recurrence (10,11).
Furthermore, 80% of breast cancers in postmenopausal women
are hormone receptor positive (11), and the current standard of
care is taking an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for 5 years, which
increases disease free survival by 10% to 40% compared with
tamoxifen (12-14). While AIs are associated with clinically
meaningful recurrence and mortality risk reductions (10), a side
effect is loss of BMD (15-17). Postmenopausal breast cancer sur-
vivors taking AIs lose about 2.6% of their BMD annually, which
is double the amount of BMD loss in healthy postmenopausal
women (18,19). Research examining the effects of AIs on other
components of body composition have been mixed, with some
studies showing loss of LBM and increases in body fat or mainte-
nance of total body fat and other studies showing no changes in
body weight or LBM (12-14,20-22). Side effects from AIs, such
as arthralgia or bone loss, lead some women to stop taking AIs,
thereby greatly increasing their chance of recurrence (23). Impor-
tantly, individuals with obesity have significantly higher inciden-
ces of arthralgia, putting them at greater risk for noncompliance
with AI treatment (24).
The potential negative side effects to body composition and bone
loss from AIs may be diminished or eliminated through the imple-
mentation of regular physical activity and exercise (25). However,
to our knowledge no study has examined the effect of exercise ver-
sus usual care on body composition and BMD in breast cancer sur-
vivors taking AIs. Given the efficacy of AIs and the large proportion
of women diagnosed with breast cancer recommended to take AIs, it
is important to have interventions available to improve AI side
effects as well as quality of life and all-cause mortality. Thus, we
sought to examine the effect of a 12-month combined aerobic and
resistance exercise intervention versus usual care on changes in
BMI, percent body fat, LBM, and BMD in postmenopausal breast
cancer survivors taking AIs.
Methods
The Hormones and Physical Exercise (HOPE) study was a
randomized control trial of exercise versus usual care on the pri-
mary end point of AI-associated arthralgia and the secondary end
point of body composition (25). The study protocol was approved
by the Yale School of Medicine Human Investigation Committee
and the Connecticut Department of Public Health Human Investi-
gations Committee. All participants provided written informed
consent. Breast cancer survivors were recruited via a field arm of
the Connecticut Tumor Registry, the Rapid Case Ascertainment
Shared Resource of the Yale Cancer Center from June 2010 to
December 2012.
Participants were 121 postmenopausal women within 0.5 to 4.0
years of diagnosis of hormone-receptor positive stage I to III breast
cancer who were taking an AI for at least 6 months before enroll-
ment. Inclusion criteria required participating in less than 90 min/wk
of physical activity in the past 6 months and no strength training in
the past year. Additionally, participants had to be experiencing at
least mild arthralgias (as defined by a score of 3 out of 10 on the
worst pain item of the Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]) for at least 2
months before enrollment.
Exercise intervention
Participants who were assigned to the yearlong exercise interven-
tion participated in a twice-weekly supervised resistance training
program at a local health club and were instructed to complete 150
minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic at home. The strength train-
ing was performed under the supervision of an American College
of Sports Medicine certified cancer exercise trainer and the 150
min/wk aerobic exercise program is in accordance with current
exercise recommendations for cancer survivors. (26) The aerobic
exercise intervention consisted primarily of brisk walking (on a
treadmill or outside), although participants were able to perform
other types of sustained aerobic exercise such as cycle ergometers
and elliptical trainers. Exercise started at 50% of predicted maximal
heart rate (220-age) and was gradually increased in accordance with
American College of Sports Medicine guidelines to approximately
60% to 80% of predicted maximal heart rate, which was verified by
heart rate monitors (Polar Electro, Woodbury, NY). After each exer-
cise session, participants recorded type, duration, and average heart
rate in physical activity logs which served as a measure of exercise
adherence. The strength training program was a total body program
for the lower and upper extremities. Each strength training session
consisted of three sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of six exercises (e.g.,
leg press, leg extension, leg curl, bench press, seated row) using a
linear progressive approach. Participants progressed to up to three
sets per exercise over the first 4 weeks of training. If the participant
performed two sessions in which the same weight could be per-
formed 123, the weight was then increased in the next training
session.
Usual care group
Women in the usual care group were instructed to continue with
their usual activities. Participants in both groups were provided with
a breast cancer specific educational booklet developed for the
HOPE study, which discussed topics such as lymphedema and
fatigue. This booklet was individually discussed during the exercise
training for the exercise group and in a monthly phone call for the
usual care group.
Assessment of study end points and covariates
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was completed at base-
line to collect relevant medical history as well as current medica-
tion usage, health habits, and comorbidities. Additional informa-
tion on disease stage, hormone receptor status, histological grade,
therapy and completion date, and surgery was provided by all par-
ticipants at baseline. Information on recurrence of breast cancer
and treatment was collected at 6 and 12 months and confirmed by
the participantâs physician and review of medical records. Partici-
pants recorded their daily AI use in a log that was reviewed
monthly with study staff by phone or in person. Participants also
completed an interviewer administered physical activity question-
naire, which assessed the past 6 months of recreational activity
including the type, frequency, and duration of activities (27). This
questionnaire was completed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months to
determine between groups physical activity levels. Aerobic fitness

 height were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months without
shoes and taken twice and averaged.
Sample size
Sample size was estimated at the design stage to detect a difference
in the primary end point arthralgia. We powered our study with 60
patients per group to detect a difference of standard deviation (SD) of
1.5 (SD, 2.5) in the BPI worst pain change score with 90% power at
a two-sided significance level of 0.05 based on results of the study
by Crew et al. (24).
Statistical analyses
Participants were grouped according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Permuted block randomization (at 1:1 ratio) with random block size was
performed, stratified by current bisphosphonate use and joint pain before
AI therapy. Intervention effects were evaluated by differences in mean
changes at follow-up time points between exercise and usual care groups
using mixed-model repeated measures analysis. Group 3 time interac-
tion was also included as a fixed effect. Analyses were performed using
SASV
R software (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical signifi-
cance was set at P < 0.05 using two-sided tests.
Results
As described previously (25), a total of 1,537 estrogen receptor-
positive breast cancer survivors were identified through the Rapid
Case Ascertainment Shared Resource of the Yale Cancer Center.
Screening telephone calls were completed with 1,016 women (66%
of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated at
five Connecticut hospitals). From 1,016 screening calls made, 121
(11.9%) women were eligible, interested, and randomized (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics
On average women were 62.0 6 7.0 years old and 2.7 6 3.1 years
from cancer diagnosis and had been taking an AI for 1.9 6 1.3 years
(Table 1). Women were also physically inactive and overweight
with an average BMI of 29.0 6 5.9 (Table 2). The two groups did
not differ in terms of demographics, clinical, or body composition
variables or age since menopause.
Change in physical activity levels and adherence
to the exercise intervention
At baseline, both the exercise group and the usual care group had
low levels of physical activity. Specifically, the exercise group aver-
aged 54.8 min/wk (36.5% of the recommended 150 min/wk), and
the usual care group averaged 60.7 min/wk (40.5% of the recom-
mended 150 min/wk). Over the course of the intervention, women
assigned to the exercise intervention increased their physical activity
to an average 159 6 136 min/wk, compared with 49 6 86 min/wk in
the usual care group (P < 0.001). Additionally, their aerobic fitness
as measured by VO2 max increased by 6.5% 6 3.7% in women
randomized to exercise versus a 1.8% 6 11.2% decrease in women
randomized to usual care (P < 0.001).
Changes in body composition by randomized
group
Table 3 shows mean changes in body composition variables at 12
months for both groups. At 12 months, the exercise group had a sig-
nificant increase in LBM compared with the usual care group (0.32 kg
vs. 20.88 kg, P 5 0.03). The exercise group also had favorable
changes in percent body fat at 12 months, with a reduction of 1.4%, as
opposed to an increase in the usual care group of 0.5% (P 5 0.03).
Additionally, exercisers had a decrease in BMI at 12 months as
opposed to the usual care group which had an increase in BMI

 (20.73 kg/m2 vs. 0.17 kg/m2, P 5 0.03). BMD did not change in
either the exercise or usual care groups at 12 months (0.001 g/cm2 vs.
20.006 g/cm2, P 5 0.37). However, in post hoc analyses, bisphospho-
nate use (N 5 20; exercise 5 11, usual care 5 9) modified the effect of
exercise on BMD such that women on bisphosphonates randomized to
exercise experienced an increase in BMD compared with women
randomized to usual care (0.03 g/cm2 vs. 0.01 g/cm2, P 5 0.09).
BMD changes in women not taking bisphosphonates did not differ by
randomization in those women in the exercise or usual care groups
(20.01 g/cm2 vs. 20.01 g/cm2, P 5 0.76).
Effect of exercise versus usual care on
BPI-assessed pain at baseline and 12 months
As previously described (28), the BPI-assessed worst joint pain
scores averaged 5.6 (SD 2.1) for exercisers and 5.9 (SD 1.9) in
those in the usual care condition at baseline. At 12 months, BPI
scores decreased by 1.6 points in the exercise group (a 29%
decrease), whereas the usual care group experienced an increase of
0.2 points (a 3% increase).
Discussion
In our study, 12 months of a combined aerobic plus resistance exer-
cise intervention was associated with a decrease in percent body fat
and BMI and an increase in LBM in postmenopausal breast cancer
survivors taking an AI. These favorable changes in body composi-
tion may be particularly helpful for women with obesity taking AIs.
It has been reported that AIs may be less effective in women with a
BMI >30 kg/m2, which may be due to altered endocrine function in
adipose tissue as well as comorbidities common to obesity (29). It is
also well documented that over two thirds of breast cancer survivors
are overweight or have obesity (2-4), and few participate in recom-
mended amounts of exercise (4). Current guidelines advise over-
weight women to avoid gaining weight and women with obesity to
lose weight after treatment to improve breast cancer outcomes (26).
Therefore, reducing BMI and percent body fat while maintaining or
increasing LBM may have strong clinical benefits.
It is important to note that the usual care group demonstrated evi-
dence of the expected age-related decline in LBM. Dietary-induced
weight loss is often associated with loss of LBM (30), but we
found exercise to be associated with weight and percent body fat
loss yet a favorable increase in LBM. However, neither the exer-
cise nor usual care groups experienced changes in BMD over 12
months. The women enrolled in the HOPE study were taking an
AI for an average of 1.9 years; thus AI-associated changes in
BMD may have occurred before enrollment into the HOPE study.
However, it is interesting
to note that those women taking
bisphosphonates and exercising had a trend toward an increase in
BMD, a change which could have been enhanced by exercise.
Future studies need to examine the impact of exercise versus usual
care on changes in BMD upon initiation of AI therapy, as well as
whether and what type of exercise can be considered a treatment
for AI-induced BMD losses.
Our findings support the effectiveness of a combined exercise inter-
vention for promoting beneficial body composition changes in post-
menopausal women with breast cancer who are taking AIs. Given
the high levels of obesity and inactivity in breast cancer survivors,
this could be a particularly relevant finding (3-5) as they could be at
significant risk for additional chronic disease and cancer mortality.
These findings are consistent with findings that combined exercise
interventions promote changes in adiposity across clinical groups. A
recent meta-analysis examining different exercise interventions on
anthropometric outcomes in participants with a BMI ï¿½25 kg/m2
found that combined training was most effective in reducing fat
mass and raising LBM, as compared with aerobic exercise only
(31,32). Additionally, performing resistance training twice a week
for a 6-month period can increase LBM by 1 to 2 kg, a change
which may prevent or reverse age-associated lean mass losses (33).
Previous investigations have demonstrated that intentional weight
loss due to exercise is often associated with a loss of fat mass (34)
and unchanged or increased lean mass (35,36). In the HOPE study,
BMI and percent body fat were reduced while lean mass was
increased in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.
Study limitations include that we only measured total BMD. Addi-
tionally, five participants had to discontinue use of AIs over the
course of the intervention due to joint pain (2), length of time on an
AI (1), gastric distress (1), and belief that cognition was being
affected (1). Our study may also have issues with generalizability to
other study populations, as participants were predominantly non-
Hispanic white and highly educated.
There are several strengths to this study including a randomized study
design, yearlong trial, and focus on body composition changes in
women at risk of adverse changes in body composition, i.e., women

 taking AIs. In postmenopausal women combined aerobic and resist-
ance exercise has been shown to promote increased BMD in the lum-
bar spine and femoral neck (37). Future research is necessary to better
understand the impact of AIs on body composition and whether exer-
cise can prevent any potential adverse body composition changes due
to AI therapy. Follow-up is also necessary to determine the long-term
benefits of these body composition improvements on chronic disease
risk and cancer recurrence. Research that enrolls women at AI initia-
tion may enhance the impact of exercise on beneficial changes in
BMD and body composition.O
