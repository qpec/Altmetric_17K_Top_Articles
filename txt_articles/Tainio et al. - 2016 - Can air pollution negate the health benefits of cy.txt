Active travel (cycling, walking) is beneficial for the health due to increased physical activity (PA). However, active
travel may increase the intake of air pollution, leading to negative health consequences. We examined the risk–
benefit balance between active travel related PA and exposure to air pollution across a range of air pollution and
PA scenarios.
The health effects of active travel and air pollution were estimated through changes in all-cause mortality for dif-
ferent levels of active travel and air pollution. Air pollution exposure was estimated through changes in back-
ground concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ranging from 5 to 200 μg/m3. For active travel
exposure, we estimated cycling and walking from 0 up to 16 h per day, respectively. These refer to long-term av-
erage levels of active travel and PM2.5 exposure.
For the global average urban background PM2.5 concentration (22 μg/m3) benefits of PA by far outweigh risks
from air pollution even under the most extreme levels of active travel. In areas with PM2.5 concentrations of
100 μg/m3, harms would exceed benefits after 1 h 30 min of cycling per day or more than 10 h of walking per
day. If the counterfactual was driving, rather than staying at home, the benefits of PA would exceed harms
from air pollution up to 3 h 30 min of cycling per day. The results were sensitive to dose–response function
(DRF) assumptions for PM2.5 and PA.
PA benefits of active travel outweighed the harm caused by air pollution in all but the most extreme air pollution
concentrations.

Introduction
Several health impact modelling (HIM) studies have estimated the
health benefits and risks of active travel (cycling, walking) in different
geographical areas (Mueller et al., 2015; Doorley et al., 2015). In most
of these studies, the health benefits due to physical activity (PA) from
increased active travel are significantly larger than the health risks
caused by increases in exposure to air pollution.
Most of the existing active travel HIM studies have been carried out
in cities in high income countries with relatively low air pollution levels
(Mueller et al., 2015; Doorley et al., 2015). This raises the question on
the risk–benefit balance in highly polluted environments. Health risks
of air pollution are usually thought to increase linearly with increased
exposure for low to moderate levels of air pollution, whereas the bene-
fits of PA increase curvy-linearly with increasing dose (Kelly et al., 2014;
World Health Organization, 2014). Thus, at a certain level of background
air pollution and of active travel, risks could outweigh benefits, which
would directly imply that, from a public health perspective, active travel
could not be always recommended.
In this study we compare the health risks of air pollution with the
PA-related health benefits from active travel across a wide range of pos-
sible air pollution concentrations and active travel levels. We use two
thresholds to compare PA benefits and air pollution risks (Fig. 1): At
the “tipping point” an incremental increase in active travel will no longer
lead to an increase in health benefits (i.e. max. benefits have been
reached). Increasing active travel even more could lead to the “break-
even point”, where risk from air pollution starts outweighing the bene-
fits of PA (i.e. there are no longer net benefits, compared to not engaging
in active travel).

 Methods
Our approach followed a general active travel HIM method (Mueller
et al., 2015; Doorley et al., 2015). Air pollution exposures due to active
travel were quantified by estimating the differences in the inhaled
dose of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. We selected PM2.5
because it is a commonly used indicator of air pollution in active travel
HIM studies (Mueller et al., 2015; Doorley et al., 2015), and because of
the large health burden caused by PM2.5 (GBD 2013 Risk Factors
Collaborators et al., 2015). For both air pollution and PA we used all-
cause mortality as the health outcome because there is strong evidence
for its association with both long-term exposure to PM2.5 (Héroux et al.,
2015) and long-term PA behaviour (Kelly et al., 2014).
The reduction in all-cause mortality from active travel was estimat-
ed by converting the time spent cycling or walking to metabolically
equivalent of task (MET) and calculating the risk reduction using
dose–response functions (DRFs) adapted from Kelly et al.'s3 meta-
analysis. From the different DRFs reported in Kelly et al. (2014) we
chose the one with the “0.50 power transformation” as a compromise
between linear and extremely non-linear DRFs. Non-linearity in a DRF
means that the health benefits of increased active travel would level
out sooner and a tipping point would be reached earlier than with
more linear DRFs. See supplementary material for the sensitivity analy-
sis with different DRFs. To convert cycling and walking time to PA we
used the values of 4.0 METs for walking and 6.8 METs for cycling,
based on the Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth et al.,
2011). The walking and cycling levels used in this study are assumed
to reflect long-term average behaviour.
The health risks of PM2.5 were estimated by converting background
PM2.5 concentrations to travel mode specific exposure concentrations,
and by taking into account ventilation rate whilst being active. For back-
ground PM2.5 we used values between 5 and 200 μg/m3 with 5 μg/m3
intervals. We also estimated tipping points and break-even points for
the average and most polluted cities in each region included in the
World Health Organization (WHO) Ambient Air Pollution Database
(World Health Organization (WHO), 2014), which contains measured
and estimated background PM2.5 concentrations for 1622 cities around
the world.
The mode specific exposure concentrations were estimated by mul-
tiplying background PM2.5 concentration by 2.0 for cycling or 1.1 for
walking, based on a review of studies (Kahlmeier et al., 2014). The coun-
terfactual scenario for the time spent cycling or walking was assumed to
be staying at home (i.e. in background concentration of PM2.5). See
supplementary file for the sensitivity analysis with counterfactual sce-
narios where cycling time would replace motorised transport time.
The ventilation rates differences whilst at sleep, rest, cycling and walk-
ing were taken into account when converting exposure to inhaled dose.
For sleep, rest, walking and cycling we used ventilation rates of 0.27,
0.61, 1.37 and 2.55, respectively (de Nazelle et al., 2009; Johnson,
2002). The sleep time was assumed to be 8 h in all scenarios and the
resting time was 16 h minus the time for active travel.
For the PM2.5 DRF we used a relative risk (RR) value of 1.07 per
10 μg/m3 change in exposure (World Health Organization, 2014). We
assumed that DRF is linear from zero to maximum inhaled dose. As a
sensitivity analysis we used non-linear integrated risk function from
Burnett et al. (2014) (see supplementary material for details).
The model used for all calculations is provided in Lumina Decision
Systems Analytica format in supplementary file 2 (readable with

Excel format in supplementary file 3.
Results
The tipping point and break-even point for different average cycling
times and background PM2.5 concentrations are shown in Fig. 2. For half
an hour of cycling every day, the background PM2.5 concentration
would need to be 95 μg/m3 to reach the tipping point. In the WHO
Ambient Air Pollution Database less than 1% of cities have PM2.5 annual
concentrations above that level (World Health Organization (WHO),
2014). The break-even point for half an hour of cycling every day was
at 160 μg/m3 (Fig. 2). For half an hour of walking the tipping point
and break-even point appear at a background concentration level
above 200 μg/m3 (Fig. S3, supplementary file). For the average urban
background PM2.5 concentration (22 μg/m3) in the WHO database, the
tipping point would only be reached after 7 h of cycling and 16 h of
walking per day.
Tables S2 and S3 (supplementary file) show the tipping point for cy-
cling and walking, respectively, in different regions of the world. In the
most polluted city in the database (Delhi, India, background concentra-
tion of 153 μg/m3), the tipping and break-even points were 30 and
45 min of cycling per day, respectively (Table S2, supplementary file).
In most global regions the tipping points for the most polluted cities
(44 μg/m3 to 153 μg/m3) varied between 30 and 120 min per day for cy-
cling, and 90 min to 6 h 15 min per day for walking (Table S3, supple-
mentary material).

 When we assumed that time spend cycling would replace time driv-
ing a car, benefits always exceeded the risks in the background air pol-
lution concentrations below 80 µg/m3, a concentration exceeded in
only 2% of cities (World Health Organization (WHO), 2014). Other sen-
sitivity analyses showed that the results are sensitive to the shape of the
DRF functions. With the linear DRF for active travel the break-even point
would be reached with background PM2.5 concentrations of 170 μg/m3
regardless of the active travel time (Fig. S4, supplementary material); a
level not currently found in any of the cities in the WHO air pollution da-
tabase (World Health Organization (WHO), 2014). With the most
curved DRF (0.25 power) the PM2.5 concentration where harms exceed
benefits for 1 h of cycling per day would drop from 150 μg/m3 to 130 μg/
m3 (Fig. S4, supplementary material), a level currently found only in 9
cities (World Health Organization (WHO), 2014). With a non-linear
DRF for PM2.5 the break-even point was not reached in any background
PM2.5 concentration when using “power 0.50” DRF for cycling and walk-
ing. Other input value modifications had small or insignificant impact to
the results.
Discussions
This study indicates that, practically, air pollution risks will not ne-
gate the health benefits of active travel in urban areas in the vast major-
ity of settings worldwide. Even in areas with high background PM2.5
concentrations, such as 100 μg/m3, up to 1 h 15 min of cycling and
10 h 30 min of walking per day will lead to net reduction in all-cause
mortality (Fig. S5, supplementary material). This result is supported
by epidemiological studies that have found the statistically significant
protective effects of PA even in high air pollution environments
(Matthews et al., 2007; Andersen et al., 2015). However, a small minor-
ity engaging in unusually high levels of active travel (i.e. bike messen-
gers) in extremely polluted environments may be exposed to air
pollution such that it negates the benefits of PA.
Some considerations of the limitations and the strengths of our
study need to be applied when generalising these findings.
In this analysis we took into account only the long-term health con-
sequences of regular PA and chronic exposure to PM2.5. Impacts of
short-term air pollution episodes, where concentrations significantly
exceed the average air pollution levels for a few days, may induce addi-
tional short term health effects. We have also only worked with all-
cause mortality and have, thus, not taken into account the morbidity
impact.
For the health risks of air pollution we only estimated the increased
risk during cycling and walking, not the overall health risk from every-
day air pollution. Air pollution causes a large burden of diseases all over
the world (Burnett et al., 2014) and reducing air pollution levels would
provide additional health benefits. Since transport is an important
source of air pollution in urban areas, mode shifts from motorised trans-
port to active travel would not only improve health in active travellers,
but also help to reduce air pollution exposures for the whole population
(Johan de Hartog et al., 2010).
The results are sensitive to assumptions of the linearity of dose–re-
sponse relationships between active travel-related PA and health bene-
fits, and between PM2.5 and adverse health effects. With linear DRFs for
PA the benefits always exceeded the risks at all levels of PM2.5 concen-
trations. Evidence for a linear DRF for high PM2.5 concentrations is
small and, for example, the Global Burden of Disease study applied
non-linear, disease specific DRFs for PM2.5 (Burnett et al., 2014). If the
risks of PM2.5 level out after PM2.5 concentrations over 100 μg/m3, the
health benefits of PA would always exceed the risks of PM2.5.
It should also be taken into account that the results are based on gen-
erally representative values without detailed information on local con-
ditions, or from the background PA and disease history of individuals.
For individuals highly active in non-transport domains the benefits
from active travel will be smaller, and vice versa.
Conclusions
The benefits from active travel generally outweigh health risks from
air pollution and therefore should be further encouraged. When
weighing long-term health benefits from PA against possible risks
from increased exposure to air pollution, our calculations show that
promoting cycling and walking is justified in the vast majority of set-
tings, and only in a small number of cities with the highest PM2.5 con-
centration in the world cycling could lead to increase in risk.
