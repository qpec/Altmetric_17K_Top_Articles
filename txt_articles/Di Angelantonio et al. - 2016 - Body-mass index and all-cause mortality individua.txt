Body-mass index and all-cause mortality: individual-
participant-data meta-analysis of 239 prospective studies in 
four continents
The Global BMI Mortality Collaboration* 
Summary
Background Overweight and obesity are increasing worldwide. To help assess their relevance to mortality in diff
 erent 
populations we conducted individual-participant data meta-analyses of prospective studies of body-mass index (BMI), 
limiting confounding and reverse causality by restricting analyses to never-smokers and excluding pre-existing 
disease and the fi
 rst 5 years of follow-up.
Methods Of 10 625 411 participants in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and North America from 239 prospective 
studies (median follow-up 13·7 years, IQR 11·4–14·7), 3 951 455 people in 189 studies were never-smokers without 
chronic diseases at recruitment who survived 5 years, of whom 385 879 died. The primary analyses are of these deaths, 
and study, age, and sex adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), relative to BMI 22·5–<25·0 kg/m².
Findings All-cause mortality was minimal at 20·0–25·0 kg/m² (HR 1·00, 95% CI 0·98–1·02 for BMI 20·0–<22·5 kg/m²; 
1·00, 0·99–1·01 for BMI 22·5–<25·0 kg/m²), and increased signifi
 cantly both just below this range (1·13, 1·09–1·17 
for BMI 18·5–<20·0 kg/m²; 1·51, 1·43–1·59 for BMI 15·0–<18·5) and throughout the overweight range (1·07, 
1·07–1·08 for BMI 25·0–<27·5 kg/m²; 1·20, 1·18–1·22 for BMI 27·5–<30·0 kg/m²). The HR for obesity grade 1 
(BMI 30·0–<35·0 kg/m²) was 1·45, 95% CI 1·41–1·48; the HR for obesity grade 2 (35·0–<40·0 kg/m²) was 1·94, 
1·87–2·01; and the HR for obesity grade 3 (40·0–<60·0 kg/m²) was 2·76, 2·60–2·92. For BMI over 25·0 kg/m², 
mortality increased approximately log-linearly with BMI; the HR per 5 kg/m² units higher BMI was 1·39 (1·34–1·43) 
in Europe, 1·29 (1·26–1·32) in North America, 1·39 (1·34–1·44) in east Asia, and 1·31 (1·27–1·35) in Australia and 
New Zealand. This HR per 5 kg/m² units higher BMI (for BMI over 25 kg/m²) was greater in younger than older 
people (1·52, 95% CI 1·47–1·56, for BMI measured at 35–49 years vs 1·21, 1·17–1·25, for BMI measured at 
70–89 years; pheterogeneity<0·0001), greater in men than women (1·51, 1·46–1·56, vs 1·30, 1·26–1·33; pheterogeneity<0·0001), 
but similar in studies with self-reported and measured BMI.
Interpretation The associations of both overweight and obesity with higher all-cause mortality were broadly consistent 
in four continents. This fi
 nding supports strategies to combat the entire spectrum of excess adiposity in many 
populations.

Introduction
The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity is 
high and is increasing.1,2 WHO estimates that more 
than 1·3 billion adults worldwide are overweight, 
defi
 ned by WHO as a body-mass index (BMI) of 
25–<30 kg/m², and a further 600 million are obese 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m²).3 Appropriate analyses of large-scale 
prospective studies with prolonged follow-up generally 
indicate that both overweight and obesity are associated 
with increased mortality, as is underweight (defi
 ned 
conservatively by WHO as BMI <18·5 kg/m²). However, 
it is not known how such associations vary across major 
global regions, an uncertainty relevant to international 
strategies for overweight and obesity.4 Most previous 
analyses have focused on people living in one particular 
country or continent,5–12 even though associations with 
overweight and underweight might diff
 er from one 
population to another.
Estimation of the relationships between BMI and 
mortality in various populations can help to assess the 
adverse physiological eff
 ects of excessive adiposity (and the 
adverse physiological eff
 ects of various determinants of low 
BMI). However, reliable estimates of the causal relevance of 
BMI to mortality need to limit the eff
 ects of reverse 
causality, because chronic disease and smoking can 
themselves aff
 ect BMI. To help achieve more valid 
estimates, prospective studies of BMI and mortality should, 
when possible, exclude: smokers, participants who already 
have some chronic disease at recruitment that could aff
 ect 
BMI, and those dying within 5 years of recruitment.13–16

Global 
BMI

associations of BMI with mortality across diff
 erent 
populations. It includes individual-participant data for 
10·6 million adults in 239 prospective cohort studies in 
32 countries, mainly located in Asia, Australia and New 
Zealand, Europe, or North America, about 4 million of 
whom were never-smokers without reported chronic 
diseases (mainly cardiovascular disease, cancer, or 
chronic respiratory disease) at recruitment and who were 
still being followed up 5 years afterwards.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In 2013, over 500 investigators (appendix pp 49, 50) from 
over 300 institutions in 32 countries agreed an analysis 
plan for combining individual-participant data from 
contributing studies. This prespecifi
 ed analysis plan is 
provided in the appendix (pp 51–53). The goal was to 
produce 
reliable 
estimates 
of 
potentially 
causal 
associations of overweight and obesity with mortality 
using data from studies in several regions. The 
prespecifi
 ed analysis methods were designed to 
maximise the internal validity by reducing the scope for 
bias. This Article follows PRISMA for Individual Patient 
Data reporting guidelines (appendix pp 54, 55).17
We sought data from large prospective studies 
(≥100 000 participants at baseline) or large multicohort 
consortia (total ≥100 000 participants at baseline). We 
identifi
 ed studies published from January, 1970, to 
January, 2015, through systematic literature searches and 
discussion with investigators (appendix pp 56, 57). 
Electronic searches were done with MEDLINE, Embase, 
and Scopus, and with the terms ‘“body-mass index”, 
“mortality” or “death”, “cohort” or “prospective”, and 
combinations of the words “risk”, “relative”, “ratio”, 
“hazard”, or “rate”. Prospective cohort studies or 
consortia thereof were eligible if they: (1) had information 
about weight, height, age, and sex; (2) did not select 
participants on the basis of having any previous chronic 
disease; (3) recorded overall or cause-specifi
 c deaths; and 
(4) had accrued 5 years or more of median follow-up. We 
identifi
 ed only two eligible studies that were unable to 
contribute (appendix p 37).18,19 Details of the included 
studies are provided in the appendix (pp 3–14). The 
contributing studies classifi
 ed deaths according to the 
primary cause (or, in its absence, the underlying cause), 
on the basis of coding from the International 
Classifi
 cation of Diseases, revisions 8–10, to at least three 
digits (appendix p 15), or according to study-specifi
 c 
classifi
 cation systems. Ascertainment of outcomes was 
generally based on death certifi
 cates, supplemented in 
some studies by additional data.
The appendix (p 37) describes the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. We excluded participants with a BMI 
of less than 15 kg/m² or 60 kg/m² or more, or baseline 
age younger than 20 years or older than 90 years. To 
limit residual confounding by smoking and bias due to 
eff
 ects of pre-existing disease on baseline BMI (ie, 
reverse causality), the primary analysis was restricted to 
never-smokers without specifi
 c known chronic diseases 
at baseline (eg, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or 
respiratory diseases), and omitted the fi
 rst 5 years of 
follow-up.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A previous study has claimed that relative to normal weight 
(defi
 ned by WHO as a body-mass index [BMI] of 
18·5–<25·0 kg/m²), overweight (BMI 25·0–<30·0 kg/m²) and 
grade 1 obesity (30·0–<35·0 kg/m²) are not associated with 
higher all-cause mortality. However, reliable estimates of the 
causal relevance of BMI to mortality should limit the effects of 
reverse causality, because chronic disease and smoking can 
themselves affect BMI. To help achieve such estimates, we 
established the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration, which 
involved analysis of individual-participant data from about 
10·6 million adults in 239 prospective studies in 32 countries in 
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, or North America, 
about 4 million of whom were never-smokers without chronic 
disease at recruitment who were still being followed up at least 
5 years afterwards.
Added value of this study
The Global BMI Mortality Collaboration has combined several 
features to help guide international public health policy. First, it 
involved a detailed and standardised comparison of the 
associations of BMI with mortality across prospective studies in 
four continents. Second, this analysis has been comprehensive, 
entailing data from 97% of eligible participants in relevant 
prospective cohort studies. Third, the study further subdivided 
the WHO’s normal BMI range, which is excessively wide. Finally, 
the study’s approach should have reduced the potentially 
distorting eff
 ects of smoking and ill health on BMI because the 
primary analyses were of never-smokers without previous 
disease who survived at least 5 years.
Implications of all the available evidence
This analysis has shown that both overweight and obesity (all 
grades) were associated with increased all-cause mortality. In 
the BMI range above 25 kg/m² (the upper limit of the WHO’s 
normal range), the relationship of BMI to mortality was strong 
and positive in every global region we studied (except perhaps 
south Asia, where numbers of deaths were small), lending 
support to strategies to combat the entire spectrum of excess 
adiposity worldwide. Our results challenge recent suggestions 
that overweight and moderate obesity are not associated with 
higher mortality, bypassing speculation about hypothetical 
protective metabolic eff
 ects of increased body fat in apparently 
healthy individuals.

Statistical analysis
Associations of all-cause mortality with BMI depend 
not only on the associations of specifi
 c causes of death 
with BMI in diff
 erent regions (which might diff
 er 
quantitatively), but also on how relatively common each 
specifi
 c cause of death is in the particular region (which 
can diff
 er substantially by region and over time). Hence, 
the association of all-cause mortality with BMI might 
diff
 er in regions with diff
 erent underlying mortality 
patterns. Therefore, the prespecifi
 ed primary analysis was 
stratifi
 ed by fi
 ve major geographical regions, three with 
extensive data (east Asia, Europe, and North America) and 
two with more limited data (Australia and New Zealand, 
and south Asia). Data from some or all regions are shown 
separately, in the main text or in the appendix.
Each study (or consortium of studies) analysed 
individual-participant data according to a common 
analytical plan with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC, USA) or Stata version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX, USA) provided by the coordinating centres. These 
separate results were then meta-analysed at Cambridge 
University, UK. To facilitate standardised comparisons 
with other meta-analyses, we calculated hazard ratios 
(HRs) for mortality in the six WHO-defi
 ned baseline BMI 
categories: underweight (15·0–<18·5 kg/m²), normal 
(18·5–<25·0 kg/m²; the reference category for analyses 
of these six BMI groups), overweight (25–<30·0 kg/m²), 
and obesity grade 1 (30·0–<35·0 kg/m²), grade 2 
(35·0–<40·0 kg/m²), and grade 3 (40·0–<60·0 kg/m²).20 
Because, however, most people are of normal weight or 
overweight, these two categories were subdivided, yielding 
nine groups (15·0–<18·5 kg/m²; 18·5–<20·0 kg/m²; 
20·0–<22·5 kg/m²; 22·5–<25·0 kg/m², the reference 
category 
for 
analyses 
of 
nine 
BMI 
groups; 
25·0–<27·5 kg/m²; 27·5–<30·0 kg/m²; 30·0–<35·0 kg/m²; 
35·0–<40·0 kg/m²; and 40·0–<60·0 kg/m²). The BMI 
group with the largest number of participants was chosen 
as the reference group.

meta-analyses (an extension of the DerSimonian and Laird 
procedure) and plotted against the mean BMI value within 
each category. Sensitivity analyses used other statistical 
methods (eg, fi
 xed-eff
 ect models). To enable comparisons 
across BMI groups irrespective of the choice of a reference 
group, a fl
 oating variance estimate (refl
 ecting independent 
variability within each group, including the reference 
group) was attributed to each category using Plummer’s 
method and used to calculate group-specifi
 c confi
 dence 
intervals.21
To estimate the BMI levels at which mortality risk was 
lowest (ie, the nadir), weighted linear regression yielded 
the best-fi
 tting second-degree fractional polynomial 
model relating pooled log HRs to pooled mean BMI 
levels (weighted by the inverse of the fl
 oating variance of 
the log HR), and the minimum of this polynomial was

the nadir. We assessed all-cause mortality and its main 
components, coronary heart disease, stroke, other 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory disease 
(appendix p 15). HRs were calculated separately within 
each study with Cox regression models stratifi
 ed for 
baseline age and sex (appendix pp 51–53), with 
participants contributing from the baseline survey in 
crude analyses or from year 5 in the primary analyses. 
HRs in sex-specifi
 c and baseline-age-specifi
 c groups 
(and, when appropriate, by trial groups) were combined 
across studies.22 To avoid over-fi
 tting of statistical models, 
studies with ten or fewer deaths from a particular cause 
were excluded from meta-analyses of that cause.23,24
Because the associations of BMI with mortality were 
approximately log-linear above a BMI of 25 kg/m², we 
calculated HRs per 5 kg/m² higher BMI increase by 
inverse-variance-weighted regression of the pooled log 
HRs on mean BMI values in each category.17 For all-cause 
mortality, we estimated population-attributable fractions 
for underweight, overweight, and obesity by combining 
the proportional excess mortality (X0, X1, and X2, where 
X=HR-1) in these BMI categories with the corresponding 
prevalences (P0, P1, and P2, taken from Global Burden of 
Disease25 region-specifi
 c prevalences). The population-
attributable fractions for overweight and obesity are then 
P1X1/k and P2X2/k, where k=1 + P0X0 + P1X1 + P2X2. Between-
study heterogeneity was quantifi

used two-sided p values and 95% CIs.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. SK, PG, EDA, and JD had access to 
all the data, and, together with SNB and FBH, were 
responsible for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Of 10 625 411 participants from 239 studies (median 
follow-up 13·7 years, IQR 11·4–14·7), 3 951 455 people in 
189 studies were never-smokers without specifi
 c chronic 
diseases at recruitment who survived 5 years, of whom 
385 879 died. To limit bias, the prespecifi
 ed primary 
analyses involved this restricted population. To avoid 
merging importantly diff
 erent risks, many of these 
primary analyses further subdivided the WHO-defi
 ned 
normal and overweight BMI categories, yielding nine 
BMI groups rather than six.
Table 1 shows the substantial relevance of successively 
stricter exclusions, going from crude analyses of about 
10·6 million to prespecifi
 ed analyses of about 4 million 
adults. With BMI in only six groups, the whole range 
from 18·5 kg/m² to less than 25 kg/m² is the reference 
group, and HRs were: underweight 1·47 (95% CI 
1·39–1·55), overweight 1·11 (1·10–1·11), grade 1 obesity 
1·44 (1·41–1·47), grade 2 obesity 1·92 (1·86–1·98), 
grade 3 obesity 2·71 (2·55–2·86), and any obesity 1·64 
(1·61–1·67; appendix pp 16, 17, 25). With normal and 
overweight groups more fi
 nely subdivided, however, 
BMI 22·5 kg/m² to less than 25·0 kg/m² becomes the 
reference group, and with this more precise reference 
group, the HRs for grade 1, 2, and 3 obesity increased 
slightly (table 1, 2). Mortality was lowest in the 
BMI range from 20·0 kg/m² to less than 25·0 kg/m², 
and was signifi
 cantly increased just below this BMI 
range and in the overweight range just above it (table 2). 
In these prespecifi
 ed analyses of almost 4 million 
adults, the HRs for overweight and for obesity grade 1 
were broadly similar across diff
 erent geographical 
regions (Europe, North America, east Asia, and Australia 
and New Zealand; numbers of deaths in south Asia were 
too small to be reliable), but the HRs for underweight

and grade 3 obesity appeared somewhat higher in Europe 
than in east Asia (fi
 gure 1, table 3, appendix pp 16 
–21).
Combining all regions, the HRs for overweight and 
obesity were higher at younger ages than older ages, and 
in men than women (fi
 gures 2 and 3); this fi
 nding held 
in each major geographical region (appendix pp 22–24, 
38–40). In each region, BMI was non-linearly associated 
with all-cause mortality, with nadir at BMI 20·0 kg/m² 
to less than 25·0 kg/m² and excess mortality in 
underweight, overweight, and at BMI 18·5 kg/m² to less 
than 20·0 kg/m², at the lower end of the WHO-defi
 ned 
normal range. The nadir depended on age, and 
was BMI=22 kg/m² for baseline age 35–49 years, 
BMI=23 kg/m² for baseline age 50–69 years, and 
BMI=24 kg/m² for baseline age 70–89 years.
Population-attributable fractions for all-cause mortality 
due to overweight or obesity were 19% in North America, 
16% in Australia and New Zealand, and 14% in Europe, 
but only 5% in east Asia (appendix p 25). For 
BMI 25 kg/m² or more, the association of BMI with all-
cause mortality was approximately log-linear, and of 
similar strength in each region (except perhaps south 
Asia, where numbers of deaths were small), with 
HR per 5 kg/m² units higher BMI 1·31 (95% CI 
1·29–1·33) overall, 1·39 (1·34–1·44) in east Asia, 1·39 
(1·34–1·43) in Europe, 1·29 (1·26–1·32) in North 
America, and 1·31 (1·27–1·35) in Australia and New 
Zealand. The HR decreased with age from 1·52 
(1·47–1·56) for ages 35–49 years at baseline to 1·21 
(1·17–1·25) for ages 70–89 years at baseline (trend 
p<0·0001; appendix p 26). The HR was 1·51 (1·46–1·56) 
for 
men 
versus 
1·30 
(1·26–1·33) 
for 
women 
(heterogeneity p<0·0001; fi
 gure 3). Hence, a given 
increase in BMI is associated with a far greater absolute 
mortality increase in men than in women (appendix 
p 45). As there were far more women than men, 
particularly among obese people, the HR among all 
participants was similar to the HR just among women.
For each major cause of death, BMI was non-linearly 
associated with mortality in each major region we studied 
(appendix pp 27–29, 41, 42). Above 25 kg/m², BMI was 
strongly positively related to coronary heart disease, stroke, 
and respiratory disease mortality, and moderately positively 
related to cancer mortality (fi
 gure 4); these fi
 ndings were 
broadly similar in Europe, North America, and east Asia 
(appendix pp 28, 29). Within WHO’s wide normal BMI 
range (18·5–<25·0 kg/m²) the main geographical 
diff
 erence was that, in east Asia, mortality from coronary 
heart disease had its nadir at 18·5–<20·0 kg/m², lower 
than in other regions (appendix p 28). In all regions, 
underweight was associated with substantially higher 
respiratory disease mortality and somewhat higher 
mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer 
(fi
 gure 4). HRs comparing underweight versus normal-
weight cardiovascular disease mortality were more extreme 
in Europe than elsewhere (appendix pp 28, 29).

above, crude analyses that ignored smoking and any

eff
 ects of prior disease at baseline, and did not exclude 
the fi
 rst 5 years of follow-up, yielded diff
 erent 
(presumably substantially biased) results, with ex-
aggerated HRs for underweight, inverted HRs for 
overweight, and less than half of the excess risk for 
grade 1 obesity suggested by the strict primary analyses 
(tables 1, 2, appendix p 43). 
In sensitivity analyses (appendix pp 30–36, 46–48), HRs 
were little changed in analyses that used fi
 xed eff
 ect 
models or restricted follow-up to years 5–15; considered 
age at risk rather than age at baseline; adjusted 
additionally for race or excluded participants with 
diabetes at baseline; used only studies that included both 
sexes; used only studies with baseline data for heart 
disease, stroke, and cancer; or subdivided studies by 
mean baseline BMI or median recruitment year (HRs 
were somewhat higher in studies starting before 1990 
than those after 1990, but meta-regression of HRs on 
year of recruitment was not signifi
 cant). HRs did not 
vary substantially between larger and smaller studies, 
between studies with measured and self-reported BMI, 
or between occupational and other studies.
Discussion
Associations between BMI and mortality can help to 
estimate the public health impact of excess adiposity only 
if the estimated relationships are not substantially 
distorted by the eff
 ects of smoking or ill health on BMI. 
Hence, our primary analyses were of never-smokers 
without previous disease who survived at least 5 years. 
Both overweight and obesity were associated with 
increased all-cause mortality. In the BMI range above 
25 kg/m² (ie, above the upper limit of the WHO’s normal 
range) the relationship to mortality was steep in every 
global region we studied, except perhaps south Asia 
where numbers of deaths were small.27
Our primary analyses challenge previous suggestions 
that overweight (25–<30 kg/m²) and grade 1 obesity 
(30–<35 kg/m²) are not associated with higher mortality,28 
bypassing speculation about hypothetical protective 
metabolic eff
 ects of increased body fat in apparently 
healthy individuals.29 In particular, the fi
 ndings here 
contrast with those of a 2013 review that claimed that, 
relative to normal weight, grade 1 obesity was not 
associated with excess all-cause mortality and that 
overweight was associated with lower all-cause mortality.28 
That review could not, however, control for the biases 
controlled for in our analysis. Indeed, the results of the 
current analysis (eg, table 1, table 2, and appendix pp 16, 
17) show how the limited ability of that literature-based 
review to control for bias could have accounted for its 
misleading fi
 ndings. Our study was able to reproduce 
such fi
 ndings when conducting crude analyses with 
inadequate control of reverse causality, but not when we 
conducted appropriately strict analyses.
Despite broadly similar overall fi
 ndings across diff
 erent 
continents, we found some diff
 erences. HRs per 5 kg/m² 
higher BMI above 25 kg/m² appeared to be somewhat 
greater in Europe than in North America. In each major 
region we studied, HRs were substantially higher at 
younger than at older ages, although the absolute excess 
mortality was higher in older people. HRs were 
substantially higher in men than in women, consistent 
with previous observations that, at equivalent BMI levels, 
men have greater insulin resistance, ectopic (eg, liver) fat 
levels, and type 2 diabetes prevalence.30 Our primary 
analyses of never-smokers included, however, far more 
women than men, particularly at higher BMI levels. 
Hence, our HRs for obesity (and, above 25·0 kg/m², the 
excess HR per 5 kg/m² increase in BMI) mainly describe 
eff
 ects in women, despite the substantially larger HRs in 
men. Our HRs for grade 1 obesity (male 1·70, female 
1·37; appendix p 22) suggest that men have almost 
double the proportional excess mortality of women— 
but, as age-specifi
 c death rates are typically more than 
50% higher in men, the absolute excess death rate 
associated with grade 1 obesity is about three times as 
great in men (appendix p 45).
Because the prevalence of obesity diff
 ers by region, for 
all-cause mortality there was wide variation across regions 
in the approximate population-attributable fraction due to 
overweight and obesity. These fi
 ndings suggest that if the 
overweight and obese population had WHO-defi
 ned 
normal levels of BMI, the proportion of premature deaths

that could be avoided would be about one in fi
 ve in North 
America, one in six in Australia and New Zealand, one in 
seven in Europe, and one in 20 in east Asia, assuming that 
the associations of overweight and obesity with mortality 
in our primary analyses largely refl
 ect causal eff
 ects. 
Moreover, BMI is increasing in many populations, so the 
pattern of high mortality from adiposity in North America 
might become typical elsewhere.31 At the opposite extreme, 
there was a substantially higher mortality not only among 
those in WHO’s underweight category, but also in those 
with BMI 18·5 kg/m² to <20 kg/m², suggesting that in 
excessively lean adult populations underweight remains a 
cause for concern. We have no information about whether 
the BMI in underweight individuals was always low.

Our primary analyses used three main approaches to 
help avoid bias. First, we restricted analysis to never-
smokers to avoid residual confounding by smoking as far 
as possible because merely adjusting for smoking habits 
would be unlikely to eliminate important residual biases 
due to the eff
 ect on BMI of diff
 erent intensities of 
smoking.13 Second, we sought to exclude people known 
to have specifi
 c pre-existing chronic diseases (although 
full 
information 
about 
this 
variable 
was 
often 
unavailable). Finally, we omitted the initial 5 years of 
follow-up from the analysis because diseases at baseline 
that might cause death over the next 5 years could result 
in reverse causation (where lower BMI at recruitment is 
the result, rather than the cause, of the underlying 
pathology).14–16
Our fi
 ndings are consistent with other (albeit less 
precise) studies that have used eff
 ective methods to 
reduce potential bias in evaluations of a causal 
relationship between excess BMI and mortality, 
such as Mendelian randomisation analyses,32,33 other 
instrumental variable analyses,34 and a meta-analysis of 
randomised trials.35 Our fi
 ndings are also broadly 
consistent with the stricter analyses done in a 2015 
study36 of 12 million Korean adults and with a 2016 review 
that attempted to limit the eff
 ects of reverse causality.37
The most important limitation is that our only measure 
of adiposity was BMI, so we could not directly address 
aspects of body composition such as visceral fat or fat 
distribution,38,39 nor could we consider modifi
 cation of 
HRs by metabolic factors.40 Such factors might have 
diff
 erent eff
 ects in diff
 erent populations because, at the 
same BMI, people of Asian ancestry might have higher 
amounts of body fat and greater risk of developing 
metabolic diseases than people of European ancestry.41 
Moreover, south Asia, Africa, and Latin America were 
either unrepresented or poorly represented, and large 
studies in those areas might yield diff
 erent fi
 ndings. The 
study-specifi
 c results were in general not adjusted for 
ethnicity or for socioeconomic status. We did not adjust 
for regression dilution because previous surveys have 
reported high levels of concordance in replicate BMI 
measures taken from the same adults some years apart.42
There are, however, particular strengths. Compared with 
single-country studies, we enhanced generalisability by 
combining fi
 ndings from 239 studies across four continents. 
We had access to data for about 97% of the participants in 
the studies eligible for this analysis (giving large numbers 
and negligible bias from unavailability of particular studies), 
we used a prespecifi
 ed analysis plan, we analysed individual-
participant data to avoid the potentially important 
limitations of literature-based reviews,43 and we analysed 
clinically relevant subpopulations reliably, exploiting the 
considerable statistical power of the study. We avoided 
potential over-adjustment by not adjusting for variables (eg, 
diabetes status and physical activity) that could mediate 
associations between BMI and mortality.44 Finally, our 
results were robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses.
We conclude that wherever overweight and obesity are 
common their associations with higher all-cause 
mortality are broadly similar in diff
 erent populations, 
supporting strategies to combat the entire spectrum of 
excessive adiposity worldwide.
