Biological embedding of childhood
adversity: from physiological mechanisms
to clinical implications

Abstract
Background: Adverse psychosocial exposures in early life, namely experiences such as child maltreatment,
caregiver stress or depression, and domestic or community violence, have been associated in epidemiological
studies with increased lifetime risk of adverse outcomes, including diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and psychiatric
illnesses. Additional work has shed light on the potential molecular mechanisms by which early adversity becomes
“biologically embedded” in altered physiology across body systems. This review surveys evidence on such
mechanisms and calls on researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and other practitioners to act upon evidence.
Observations: Childhood psychosocial adversity has wide-ranging effects on neural, endocrine, immune, and
metabolic physiology. Molecular mechanisms broadly implicate disruption of central neural networks,
neuroendocrine stress dysregulation, and chronic inflammation, among other changes. Physiological disruption
predisposes individuals to common diseases across the life course.
Conclusions: Reviewed evidence has important implications for clinical practice, biomedical research, and work
across other sectors relevant to public health and child wellbeing. Warranted changes include increased clinical
screening for exposures among children and adults, scale-up of effective interventions, policy advocacy, and
ongoing research to develop new evidence-based response strategies.

Background
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that adverse
childhood
experiences,
namely
exposures
such
as
neglect, abuse, caregiver mental illness, and family or
community violence, predict poorer long-term outcomes
across health and social domains. Outcomes associated
with early adversity include higher risk of type 2
diabetes, obesity, ischemic heart disease, cancers, depres-
sion, addictions, and premature mortality, as well as
social outcomes including unemployment and lower
educational attainment [1–8]. Particularly convincing
evidence comes from large birth cohorts and prospect-
ive, longitudinal life-course studies exploring predictive
relationships [3, 5–9]. Meanwhile, human and animal
research has provided insights into candidate molecular
mechanisms by which early adversity may become
“biologically embedded” in disrupted physiology [10].
Such findings support life-course models of human
health describing how early physiological development
interacts over time with behavior and ongoing risk
environments to shape outcomes holistically [7].
Nevertheless, evidence about the pathogenic effects of
childhood psychosocial adversity has not been widely
applied in clinical practice or public health initiatives.
Such knowledge has the potential to improve screening
and intervention strategies aiming to decrease exposure
to early adversity (primary prevention), limit resulting
pathology (secondary prevention), and help those already
suffering effects (tertiary prevention and treatment).
Efforts must span the life course, involving pediatric and
adult clinicians, researchers, educators, public health
practitioners, families, and communities. Awareness of

 the effects of adversity can furthermore enhance investi-
gations into the roots of human disease.
This review surveys the evidence on biological mecha-
nisms thought to link early childhood adversity to later
disease.
While
prior
literature
has
predominantly
described changes in one or a few physiological axes,
this review summarizes changes comprehensively across
body systems, offering a unified orientation for clinicians
and researchers. The specific questions addressed in-
clude (1) How can often time-limited early exposures
produce durable physiological changes? (2) How do such
physiological changes converge to generate disease? (3)
What factors underlie “differential susceptibility” to
developmental adversity, and how can interventions
promote resilience? Finally, we consider how answers to
these questions should shape action across social sectors
to promote child wellbeing and lifelong health.
Defining early life adversity
In this review, we conceptualize childhood adversity as a
negative childhood experience associated with increased
lifetime risk of poorer health and social outcomes. The
review is limited to postnatal exposures, while separate
literature covers important effects of prenatal adversity
[11]. We specifically consider psychosocial adversity,
namely that involving relationships (to caregivers, family,
community, peers) and other social experiences interact-
ing with psychological processes [12]. Examples of
psychosocial adversities include childhood maltreatment,
violence exposure, caregiver psychopathology, unstable
or depriving care environments (e.g., low-quality foster
or institutional care), adverse societal exposures such as
crime and discrimination, and other causes of psycho-
logical stress or trauma. Various childhood adversities
are prevalent globally. A recent review found that at
least 44% of children in developed countries and 59% in
developing countries had been victims of physical, emo-
tional, or sexual violence or had witnessed domestic or
community violence in the preceding year [13]. Care-
giver
poor
mental
health
is
also
common,
with
depression currently representing the leading cause of
disease-related disability globally [14].
For brevity, we refer to childhood psychosocial adver-
sity as “early life adversity” (ELA), employing an aggrega-
tive approach to conceptualize exposures. Such an
approach facilitates the synthesis of complex evidence
for application, and is supported by observed dose–re-
sponse effects linking cumulative early adversity to later
outcomes [1, 3, 5], and by the “allostatic load” paradigm
exploring pathogenic effects of cumulative all-cause
stress [15]. Such aggregative approaches require comple-
mentary efforts to differentiate effects of exposures
varying in nature, timing, and intensity [16]. Here, we do
not specifically examine low childhood socioeconomic
status (SES) as a psychosocial adversity, as poverty influ-
ences health in part via non-psychosocial pathways (e.g.,
increasing exposure to physical environmental hazards).
Meanwhile, some families living in poverty provide safe
psychosocial environments despite the challenges posed
by socioeconomic disadvantage. Nevertheless, childhood
adversities are strongly partitioned by SES, and shaped
by inequities intertwined with poverty such as those
defined by race, gender, immigration status, class, and
other axes of social inequality.
Biological embedding
Biological embedding describes processes
by
which
initially transient, homeostatic responses durably alter
physiology [10]. Events early in life may be embedded
preferentially due to a preponderance of sensitive pe-
riods, or windows of rapid development and heightened
plasticity (responsiveness to experience). While trad-
itionally described in neurodevelopment [16], sensitive
period effects have been suggested elsewhere, including
in the immune [17] and metabolic [18] systems. Epigen-
etic processes represent a key family of mechanisms
driving embedding. Epigenetic change involves stable al-
teration of gene expression via mechanisms including,
among others, attachment of chemical residues (e.g.,
methyl groups) to DNA or to molecules involved in pack-
aging and transcriptional control (e.g., histones) [19].
Methodological challenges
A key methodological challenge is the difficulty of causal
demonstration amidst social complexity. While epi-
demiological studies statistically explore confounding
and mediational pathways, randomized controlled trials
– the “gold standard” in causal inference – are often
impossible or unethical. This challenge necessitates
substantial use of animal models, enabling controlled ex-
perimentation and use of targeted molecular manipula-
tions clarifying causal pathways. These models are
considered in this review when potentially useful to
understand human processes. An additional challenge
has been the reliance on retrospective self-reporting of
ELA in many studies. Such reports may agree only mod-
erately with prospective measures, and could be more
prone to bias, though both types of measures tend to
predict similar disease and social outcomes [20]. We
therefore focus on the direction (versus size) of effects
and on physiological mechanisms, and prioritize studies
using prospective, longitudinal designs.
Search strategy
We identified peer-reviewed, academic literature from
multiple databases, including PubMed, Medline, and
PsycINFO, using search terms specifying timing in early
life (e.g., early, child*, infan*) and adverse exposures
Berens et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:135 
Page 2 of 12
 (e.g., advers*, psychological stress, maltreat*), as well as
terms for specific physiological axes as appropriate.
Priority was given to more recent studies, major reviews,
and prospective human studies. Cross-sectional and
animal studies were included where prospective human
evidence was unavailable.
Biological embedding by physiological axis
ELA has diverse effects across neural, endocrine, im-
mune, metabolic, and gut microbial axes, as reviewed
below. Table 1 summarizes key findings, while Fig. 1
provides a working conceptual model of ELA’s biological
embedding.
Axis 1: The brain
Human brain maturation is a protracted process begin-
ning in fetal life and continuing into early adulthood
[21]. Dramatic growth in gray and white matter occurs
in the first 2 years of life, when the brain attains 80–90%
of its adult volume before continuing to grow at an at-
tenuated rate [22, 23]. Alongside growth, experience-
dependent neural pruning eliminates inactive synapses.
Anatomically, the brain matures “from the bottom up,”
beginning
with
primitive
brainstem
structures
and
progressing
anatomically
in
anterior-posterior
and
inferior-superior directions, culminating with the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC). Functional development similarly
progresses from basic sensory and motor capacities to
subsequent language and executive functioning (e.g.,
cognitive control, working memory), and ultimately
higher cognition [16]. Normative neurodevelopment
thus enables environmental adaptation and progressively
complex cognition, but leaves the brain susceptible to
negative exposures for an extended period of time.
Extensive literature links ELA to pervasive, quantifiable
variation in brain structure and function [15, 21, 24, 25].
Investigation has preferentially examined “stress sensitive”
areas dense with glucocorticoid receptors, including lim-
bic structures (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala) key to
memory, learning, and emotion regulation, as well as the
PFC, critical for higher cognition, executive functioning,
and “top-down” control of lower regions [26]. Studies of
adolescents and adults provide consistent evidence of
smaller PFC gray matter volumes after ELA, paralleling
findings from experimental animal models designed to
demonstrate causality [21, 24, 25]. Smaller hippocampal
volumes have been consistently observed in ELA-exposed
adults, though not children, reflecting potential latent
effects
on
a
slow-developing
structure.
Amygdala
volumetric effects are complex, including both increases
and decreases, likely moderated by exposure timing and
type [21, 27].
Considering potential embedding mechanisms, the
“neurotoxicity hypothesis” posits that early elevation of
stress mediators, particularly glucocorticoids, kills or
impedes growth of neurons in stress-sensitive regions
via mechanisms including oxidative damage [28]. Stress
mediators potentially linked to neurotoxicity in humans
include cortisol as well as inflammatory cytokines,
excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate), and various
other molecules (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and endogenous opioids) [29]. Oxidative stress
during early neurodevelopment may also disrupt (delay
or extend) neural sensitive periods [30]. Considering
epigenetics, experimental animal models show altered
expression of genes implicated in basic neurodevelop-
mental processes (e.g., cell adhesion, sensitive period
closure) [31]. Human studies of ELA show genome-wide
methylation changes as well as gene-specific effects on
neural signaling molecules important to psychological
health and neural function, for instance serotonin,
glutamate,
dopamine,
catechol-O-methyl
transferase
(COMT), and BDNF [19].
Beyond excess stress, environmental deprivation may
also play a role in neurodevelopmental compromise, for
instance, among children in low-quality institutional care
[32]. Broadly, absence of normative psychosocial stimuli
(e.g., language exposure or caregiver interaction) during
experience-dependent development is proposed to pro-
mote excessive synaptic pruning [33]. Indeed, children
raised in depriving institutions in infancy show globally
decreased cortical thickness [34], a finding possibly par-
alleled by reduced brain-wide dendritic arborization,
spine density, and brain volume in rodent models of
early deprivation (e.g., rearing in single-occupancy cages)
[35]. Nevertheless, “depriving” exposures (such as care-
giver absence) generally evoke potent stress responses
[36] while stress mediators regulate synaptic plasticity
[37],
complicating
efforts
to
discern
whether
the
observed
structural
changes
reflect
excess
pruning
(versus, for instance, glucocorticoid neurotoxicity) and if
these mechanisms are, in fact, independent of stress-
mediated pathways.
The neurodevelopmental changes described may have
far-reaching functional and health implications. Studies
suggest that neural-structural changes mediate ELA
effects on depression [38], while sensitive period disrup-
tion may contribute to schizophrenia and autism patho-
genesis
[30,
39].
Studies
of
ELA-associated
brain
functional changes show deficits in processes including
emotion regulation, fear learning, and executive func-
tioning [21]. Functional MRI studies show differences in
centrally-driven reward processing that could mediate
ELA-related risk of psychopathologies and substance
use-related illnesses [40, 41]. Finally, disruption of
central stress-regulatory structures may promote neuro-
endocrine
disruption
linked
to
diseases
of
excess
allostatic load [42], as discussed below.

 Axis 2: Neuroendocrine stress regulation
ELA broadly impacts stress reactivity as controlled by the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA)
and
autonomic
(sympathetic/parasympathetic) axes. Both axes are under
central control by corticolimbic structures, including the
PFC, hippocampus, and amygdala [29], and involve com-
mon molecular mediators (e.g., corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF), an HPA hormone and autonomic neuro-
transmitter) [43], suggesting potentially overlapping em-
bedding pathways.
HPA axis
In response to stress, hypothalamic CRF stimulates
pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release
and, in turn, adrenal cortical secretion of glucocorticoid-
s—principally cortisol in humans and corticosterone in
many animal species. Glucocorticoids trigger diverse
systemic homeostatic responses while exerting negative
feedback on the axis. In human studies and animal
experimentation, ELA consistently predicts HPA dysreg-
ulation generally persisting into adulthood, including
patterns of hyper-reactivity, suggesting potential ac-
quired resistance to glucocorticoid negative feedback
[29], or hypo-reactivity, suggesting possible attenuated
stress sensitivity or exaggerated axis suppression [44].
Differential patterns of dysregulation may reflect vari-
ation in factors including timing and type of ELA [45],
genotype [46], current age [29], and concurrent psycho-
pathology [47]. Importantly, HPA hyper- and hypo-
reactivity both represent prototypical patterns associated
with excess allostatic load, and both predict human
stress-related chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular,
metabolic, and psychiatric diseases linked epidemiologi-
cally to ELA [15, 29, 48]. Glucocorticoid dysregulation
may also promote oncogenic tumor cell microenviron-
ments (in part via pro-inflammatory effects, as discussed
below), fostering growth, migration, invasiveness, and
angiogenesis
[49],
thus
potentially
contributing
to
observed links between ELA and cancers [7].
Considering potential mechanisms of HPA changes,
animal models of early stress have demonstrated altered
expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (involved
preferentially in axis downregulation) and receptors for
CRF, ACTH, and other key molecules [50]. In particular,
altered serotonin signaling in rats receiving unfavorable
maternal care has been shown to induce hypermethyla-
tion (silencing) of the GR promoter and related genes
[51]. Similar GR hypermethylation was subsequently
demonstrated in hippocampal tissue [52] and peripheral
lymphocytes [53] of humans maltreated in childhood.
Other epigenetic changes shown in animals include
genes controlling other key stress-related receptors (e.g.,
for CRF) and hormones (e.g., CRF, AVP, ACTH, and
cortisol), as well as in neurotransmitters/neuropeptides
in stress-regulatory brain regions [54].
Autonomic axis
In response to stress, amygdala signaling initiates sympa-
thetic activation via the brainstem, terminating in adrener-
gic signals to end organs (e.g., liver, heart, digestive tract,
and
pancreas)
and
induction
of
adrenal
medullary
epinephrine/norepinephrine release producing the proto-
typical “fight or flight” response. The parasympathetic
branch
exerts
countervailing
control,

 sympathetic-parasympathetic balance shapes overall stress
physiology [55]. Experimental animal models and observa-
tional human studies have consistently linked ELA to
autonomic dysregulation, including both hyper- and hypo-
responsiveness of sympathetic or parasympathetic path-
ways. Imbalance in either sympathetic- or parasympathetic-
dominant directions again represent manifestations of
excess allostatic load and predict stress-related diseases, in-
cluding heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and
psychopathologies [55]. Pathology associations may differ
by pattern of autonomic imbalance. Several studies, for
instance, found that attenuated sympathetic reactivity cor-
related with antisocial behavior with callous-unemotional
traits in ELA-exposed boys, while heightened reactivity
correlated
with
antisocial
behavior
without
callous-
unemotional traits [56]. Such findings remain exploratory,
and the direction of causal links, if present, is unclear.
Among few studies specifically examining mechanisms of
autonomic changes, one found that volumetric changes in
the amygdala, hippocampus, and PFC statistically mediated
autonomic changes as well as risk of psychopathology [57].
Overlapping regulation by corticolimbic structures and core
molecular mediators (e.g., CRF) suggests that some HPA-
related alterations may also impact autonomic functioning.
Axis 3: Immune functioning
Innate and adaptive immune responses work jointly to
control exogenous (e.g., microbial) and endogenous (e.g.,
necrotic/neoplastic) threats in processes dependent upon
inflammatory
mediators.
When chronically
elevated,
however, inflammatory mediators contribute to im-
munosuppression as well as oxidative stress and cytotox-
icity [58]. ELA has been linked in human studies and
animal experimentation to chronic inflammation [59]
and low-level immunosuppression, including impair-
ment of mucosal immunity in children [60] and cellular
immunity (e.g., poorer control of latent viral infection)
in adolescents [61] and adults [62]. Important work has
characterized a "pro-inflammatory phenotype", involving
exaggerated cytokine response to bacterial challenge and
progressive
glucocorticoid
receptor
desensitization,
among ELA-exposed individuals [63]. Considering po-
tential mechanisms, acquired peripheral glucocorticoid
resistance may attenuate cortisol’s anti-inflammatory
effects [18]. Meanwhile, genome-wide analysis in ELA-
exposed individuals has shown increased expression of
genes controlling not only cortisol output, but also the
activity of key inflammatory mediators like NF-κβ and
interleukin-6 (IL-6) [64], with potential antecedents
including developmental programming of monocytes for
excessive inflammatory responses [18, 65]. Finally, emer-
ging research posits that ELA-related gut dysbiosis may
contribute to chronic inflammation, as discussed below.
Health implications of immunosuppression include
compromised control of infection and other threats.
Meanwhile, inflammatory mediators linked to ELA (e.g.,
IL-1,
IL-6,
TNF-alpha,
CRP,
and
fibrinogen)
are
implicated
in
risk of
cardiovascular
and
metabolic
disease [17, 66, 67]. Inflammation is also a proposed
mechanism mediating ELA effects on later depression,
age-related diseases [3], neurodevelopmental changes
[40], cancers [49], and other systemic effects discussed.
Considering cancer risk in particular, immunosuppres-
sion impairs control of latent oncogenic viruses [68],
while inflammation further promotes oncogenic tumor
microenvironments in conjunction with stress media-
tors, as discussed above [49].
Axis 4: Metabolic health
Interest in metabolic embedding of ELA stems from epi-
demiological [1, 69] and clinical [70] studies linking ELA
to obesity, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, raising
questions about possible causal pathways. While re-
search directly linking ELA to altered development of
metabolic physiology remains emergent (versus clear in-
direct impacts via, e.g., chronic inflammation [3]), poten-
tial loci of embedding are multiple. Feeding-related
regulation involves, among other networks, dopamin-
ergic reward pathways under top-down control by the
PFC,
and
hypothalamic
nuclei
integrating
nutrient
signals to induce hunger or satiety, and systemic shifts
between
catabolism
and
anabolism
[71].
Peripheral
energy homeostasis involves an interplay of anabolic
(e.g., insulin) and catabolic (e.g., cortisol, glucagon,
epinephrine/norepinephrine)
signals
promoting
in-
creased glycemia and tissue insulin resistance.
Considering mechanisms of potential ELA effects,
chronic inflammation, as well as excess catabolic signal-
ing in those with hypercortisolemia, are proposed to
drive metabolic dysfunction. Preliminary models also
posit that ELA may durably alter hepatic expression of
cortisol-activating and -metabolizing enzymes, enhan-
cing tissue-level insulin resistance even in those who
later suppress hypercortisolemia [70]. Furthermore, a
previous study linked ELA to altered central reward
processing
promoting
excess
food
intake
in
some
individuals [72]. Additional work is needed to explore
the hypothesized pathways.
Axis 5: The microbiome
The gut microbiome represents the collective genome of
nearly 100 trillion commensal microorganisms, includ-
ing over 1000 bacterial species. Dysbiosis, a pathogenic
disruption of gut microbial composition or host-microbe
interactions, is implicated in diseases including obesity,
type 2 diabetes, and depression [73]. While genetically
influenced,
gut
microbial
composition

to

Page 6 of 12
 factors including stress, diet, infection, drugs, and toxins,
making the gut a potential mediator between environ-
ment and disease. Various previous studies have sug-
gested profound microbiome effects on neuroendocrine
and immune function, such that dysbiosis could com-
pound ELA-related changes including cortisol dysregula-
tion and chronic inflammation [73–77]. Furthermore,
growing literature on the “gut-brain axis” describes mi-
crobial influence on neural development and functioning
[78]. Pathways of influence may include microbial vagus
nerve activation, neural signaling by microbial metabo-
lites or molecular patterns, heightened inflammation
with downstream neural effects, and induction of epi-
genetic changes [77, 79, 80]. In animal experimentation
and some small human studies, dysbiosis has also been
shown to impact relevant brain and behavioral parame-
ters, including cortisol regulation, depressive and anx-
ious symptomatology, and social functioning [77, 79].
Whether ELA itself produces dysbiosis is a question of
ongoing interest [74]. A study in rodents found that in-
fant maternal separation durably altered fecal microbiota
and increased later inflammatory reactivity [81]. Work
in monkeys, meanwhile, found that transient dysbiosis
triggered by infant maternal separation predicted dur-
able immune dysfunction, supporting the possibility of
early microbiome effects on development in other axes
[82]. If human research replicates such findings, the
health implications may be considerable.
Interactive effects across axes
The above evidence illustrates how ELA-related physio-
logical changes generate feed-forward synergies; for
instance, if glucocorticoid toxicity compromises brain re-
gions tasked with stress regulation [29], or stress-related
inflammation further disrupts neural, gut microbial, and
metabolic axes to compound HPA dysregulation and fur-
ther
inflammation
[83].
Meanwhile,
brain
func-
tional changes (e.g., altered executive functions and
reward processing) may shape health-related behaviors
and ongoing social risk exposures [84]. Synergistic ef-
fects of ELA thus produce wide-ranging physiological
changes marked by aberrant neural function, endocrine
activity, chronic inflammation, immunosuppression, in-
sulin
resistance
and,
potentially,
dysbiosis.
These
changes are substantially mediated by altered develop-
ment of stress-response systems; when acute, activation
of these systems generates adaptive changes across body
systems (e.g., immune, metabolic, cardiovascular) to ad-
dress threats. However, chronic or excessive activation
contributes to the pathogenic physiological “wear and
tear” described within the allostatic load paradigm [15,
29]. In full, ELA-induced changes may mediate epi-
demiological links to key diseases, including, among
others,
obesity,
dyslipidemia,
type
2
diabetes,
atherosclerosis, asthma, thromboembolic events (myo-
cardial infarction, stroke), cancer onset and progression,
as well as addictions, psychopathology, and adverse so-
cial outcomes [1–6, 18].
Differential susceptibility to adversity
Despite
described
trends,
outcomes
among
ELA-
exposed individuals are markedly diverse. A rich litera-
ture describes this apparent differential susceptibility to
adversity, as selectively reviewed in Table 2 and recom-
mended as further reading [85, 86]. Some observed
modifiers of ELA effects include genetics [25, 87–89],
child sex and/or gender [19, 90, 91], exposure features
(e.g., timing, nature, and intensity) [21, 25], and the
presence of other risks or protective factors [36]. Of
note, substantial literature suggests that nurturing care-
giving is a particularly powerful protective factor mitigat-
ing ELA associations with physiological parameters,
including elevated allostatic load [92, 93], inflammation
[94], cortisol reactivity [95], and cellular aging [96]. Con-
sidering neurodevelopment, a prospective study found
that caregiving behaviors mediated the association of
early childhood socioeconomic stress with hippocampal
volumetric
change
[97].
Such
studies
suggest
that
caregiving quality critically shapes psychosocial risk
trajectories and developmental effects.
Clinical, research, and public health applications
The evidence linking ELA to lifelong health is substan-
tial, with important implications for clinical practice and
public health summarized in Table 3. We highlight four
recommendations in particular. First, we suggest that
screening for ELA should become a routine part of
clinical care for children and adults. This aspect of the
“developmental history” can provide information about a
patient’s risk of major pediatric and adult diseases, facili-
tating social support, protective intervention, and/or
decisions about disease screening and prevention.
Second, screening for ELA must be matched by invest-
ment
in
scale-up
of
known
effective
interventions
promoting
health
by
addressing
ELA.
Considerable
evidence suggests that caregiving-focused interventions,
for instance, may mitigate the physiological effects of
ELA. Some parameters improved by caregiving-focused
interventions
in
longitudinal
research
include
ELA-
associated chronic inflammation [98], telomere shortening
(accelerated genetic aging) [99], and gray matter volumet-
ric changes [100]. Similarly, cortisol reactivity appears to
be sensitive to caregiver-targeted interventions and to psy-
chological support interventions with ELA-exposed indi-
viduals [101]. Scale-up investments must include quality
monitoring and ongoing assessment of impact at scale.
Assessments must disaggregate effects by population
Berens et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:135 
Page 7 of 12
 subgroups, for instance, as defined by culture, SES, reli-
gion, race, or ethnicity, to identify diverse needs [102].
Third, investigators must continue to test new inter-
vention strategies to prevent or reduce the physio-
logical effects of ELA. New approaches should be
ever
more
accurately
targeted
(e.g.,
based
on
genotype-dependent response variation), scalable, ef-
fective, and evidence based, making use of the rich
literature on biological embedding. In particular, novel
approaches are needed to reach the most vulnerable
families often least impacted by existing strategies
[102]. Efforts should be aided by ongoing develop-
ment of biomarkers of ELA [103], which can be used
to track intervention effects and optimize timing and
targeting. Additional research priorities include better
characterization of ELA-microbiome links, and con-
sistent use of prospective ELA measures.
Finally, we recommend that practitioners across mul-
tiple social sectors recognize ELA as a common soil
giving root to various manifestations of poor health over
the life course, and better align strategies to advance
child welfare and public health. Disease prevention
paradigms must move beyond proximal focus on risk
behaviors (e.g., diet, substance use) for specific diseases
towards life-course models accounting for early influ-
ences on lifelong health. Efforts require coordination

Genetic variability
• Genetic polymorphisms found to moderate associations
between ELA and various outcomes; Specific examples
of outcomes
impacted with implicated genes include:
o Emotional and neuroendocrine stress reactivity: 5-HTTLPR
Lester et al., 2006 [86]
o Inflammatory response to stress: 5-HTTLPR
Fredericks et al., 2010 [88]
o Common forms of psychopathology, including depression,
ADHD, and substance addiction: NR3C1, CRHR1, OXTR, 5-HTTLPR,
HTR3A, DRD2, MAOA, BDNF, COMT
o Atherosclerosis risk: MAOA
Nemeroff et al., 2016 [25]
Heim & Binder, 2012 [87]
Zhao et al., 2013 [89]
Child sex and gender
• Complex sex differences in HPA and autonomic dysregulation
after early stress observed in animals and humans
Essex et al., 2013 [19]
• Differential effects of maternal vs. paternal stress on boys vs.
girls leads some to posit ELA effect moderation by socially
embedded gender roles
• Genetic moderators of the effects of ELA may be sex and/or gender specific
o Meta-analysis found stronger effect of MAOA genotype on
psychopathology in boys
o Different polymorphism on the 5-HTTLPR gene have been
linked with increased risk of depression following ELA in
males vs. females
Kim-Cohen et al., 2006 [90]
Brummet et al., 2008 [91]
Other child characteristics
• Pre-existing health conditions, e.g., prematurity, poor
physical health status, etc. alter social and physiological
consequences of ELA
Doom & Gunnar, 2015 [36]
• Child temperament, sensitivity to the environment, and
emotion processing are associated with risk for psychopathology
and may affect the ways in which children respond to adversity
Lester et al., 2006 [86]
Exposure characteristics
• Characteristics of the exposure, including type (e.g., sexual,
physical, emotional abuse, or neglect), chronicity, and intensity,
modify associations with physical and mental health outcomes
Nemeroff et al., 2016 [25]
• Exposures occurring during early sensitive periods can
have heightened impacts on specific developmental domains
leading to “timing effects”
Bick & Nelson, 2016 [21]
Social context and caregiving
• Family structure and stability, birth order, caregiver stress
and social support, community and societal context may
modify effects of specific adversities
Doom & Gunnar, 2015 [36]
• Presence of a dependable, supportive caregiver may “buffer”
children from effects of otherwise adverse environment
Cumulative occurrence
• Dose-response relationship between number of adversities
and health and social effects are observed in large
epidemiological studies
Felitti et al., 1998 [1]

 across health, social services, education, justice, child
protection, and other sectors to improve alignment
around children’s needs. Among others, relevant priorities
might include improving access to mental health services,
childcare, and parental leave, expanding family poverty
programs, seeking immigration and criminal justice prac-
tices that avoid separating children from nurturing care-
givers, and addressing racial inequities impacting children.
Conclusions
The findings reviewed here explore various biological
mechanisms that may explain links between adverse
childhood experiences and disease. These insights can
inform efforts to improve health across the life course.
As the emergence of novel tools, such as biomarkers of
early adversity, drives a new wave of intervention re-
search, strong collaboration is needed between medical
and public health practitioners, families, and communi-
ties based on a deep appreciation for the effects of early
adversity. The understanding of the physiology of bio-
logical embedding, as explored here, supports those
leading practice-transforming efforts.
