BACKGROUND: Physical exertion, anger, and emotional upset are 
reported to trigger acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In the INTERHEART 
study, we explored the triggering association of acute physical activity 
and anger or emotional upset with AMI to quantify the importance of these 
potential triggers in a large, international population.
METHODS: INTERHEART was a case-control study of first AMI in 52 
countries. In this analysis, we included only cases of AMI and used a case-
crossover approach to estimate odds ratios for AMI occurring within 1 hour 
of triggers.
RESULTS: Of 12 
461 cases of AMI 13.6% (n=1650) engaged in physical 
activity and 14.4% (n=1752) were angry or emotionally upset in the 
case period (1 hour before symptom onset). Physical activity in the case 
period was associated with increased odds of AMI (odds ratio, 2.31; 99% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.96–2.72) with a population-attributable risk of 
7.7% (99% CI, 6.3–8.8). Anger or emotional upset in the case period was 
associated with an increased odds of AMI (odds ratio, 2.44; 99% CI, 2.06–
2.89) with a population-attributable risk of 8.5% (99% CI, 7.0–9.6). There 
was no effect modification by geographical region, prior cardiovascular 
disease, cardiovascular risk factor burden, cardiovascular prevention 
medications, or time of day or day of onset of AMI. Both physical activity 
and anger or emotional upset in the case period were associated with a 
further increase in the odds of AMI (odds ratio, 3.05; 99% CI, 2.29–4.07; P 
for interaction <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Physical exertion and anger or emotional upset are 
triggers associated with first AMI in all regions of the world, in men and 
women, and in all age groups, with no significant effect modifiers.

ardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death 
worldwide.1 The INTERHEART study reported that 
>90% of the risk of myocardial infarction was attrib-
utable to long-term exposure to 9 risk factors.2 Most long-
term exposures (eg, lipids, obesity) are mediated through 
an intermediate phenotype (atherosclerotic change) rather 
than trigger acute rupture of atherosclerotic plaque, pre-
cipitating an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Obser-
vational studies identified potential external triggers for 
AMI, including physical exertion and anger or emotional 
upset.3,4 However, with few exceptions, the included stud-
ies had small sample sizes (n<2000) and were completed 
primarily in 1 country or geographical region (predomi-
nantly Western countries). As with long-term exposure to 
cardiovascular risk factors, the prevalence of potential 
triggers of AMI may also vary by geographical region; trig-
gers important in 1 region or ethnic group may be different 
in others. Large, international studies using standardized 
methodology are required to determine whether there are 
variations in the importance of triggering risk factors and 
to determine other factors that may modify the associa-
tion. The INTERHEART study provides an opportunity to 
study the association between these potential external trig-
gers of AMI and effect modifiers in a large, international 
population.
MethOds
study Population
As previously described, the INTERHEART study was a case-
control study of first AMI completed in 262 centers across 52 
countries.2,5 In brief, consecutive cases with first AMI (defined 
by characteristic symptoms and ischemic ECG changes) were 
recruited, in addition to at least 1 age- and sex-matched con-
trol without a history of heart disease or exertional chest pain. 
In our primary analyses, we include only the cases of AMI, 
because the exposure to potential triggers was collected sys-
tematically in cases and not in controls.
study Procedures
Trained study staff performed a standardized physical exami-
nation on participants and administered a structured question-
naire. Participants with AMI (cases) were asked dichotomous 
questions, “Were you engaged in heavy physical exertion?” and 
“Were you angry or emotionally upset?” in the 1 hour before 
the onset of symptoms and during the same hour on the pre-
vious day. Control participants were asked, “During the last 
24 hours, were you engaged in heavy physical exertion?” 
and “During the last 24 hours, were you angry or emotionally 
upset?” Data were also collected on age, ethnicity, diet, physi-
cal activity, tobacco use, education, employment, psychoso-
cial factors, and cardiovascular risk factors. Anthropometric 
measurements (height, weight, waist, and hip circumference) 
were measured in a standardized manner.6 Medical history 
(diabetes mellitus, hypertension, angina, stroke, other vascu-
lar disease, and depression) and baseline medications were 
self-reported. Smoking was categorized as never smoking, for-
mer smoking (defined as no smoking within the previous year), 
or current smoking. Obesity was defined as body mass index 
of ≥30 kg/m2. Countries were grouped into 10 geographical 
regions: Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle 
East and Egypt, Africa, South Asia, China and Hong Kong, 
Southeast Asia and Japan, Australia and New Zealand, South 
America and Mexico, and North America. Physical activity was 
categorized as mainly sedentary, mild exercise, or moderate/
strenuous activity.7 Stress was categorized as none or some 
periods of stress versus several periods or permanent stress.8 
Education was categorized as none, 1 to 8 years, 9 to 12 
years, trade school, or college/university.
All data were transferred to the Population Health Research 
Institute, McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences 
(Hamilton, ON, Canada). Ethics and regulatory committees in 
participating countries and centers approved the study proto-
col, and all participants gave informed consent before study 
involvement.
statistical analysis
Categorical variables are presented as percentage (number) 
and continuous variables as mean (SD) or median (25th–75th 
percentiles), as appropriate. A case-crossover approach was 
used for these analyses9 in which each participant acts as 
 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• In these analyses of INTERHEART, we confirm 
previous reports that heavy physical exertion and 
anger or emotional upset may act as triggers 
of first acute myocardial infarction, but we also 
extend findings to all regions of the world.
• We found an interaction between heavy physical 
exertion and anger or emotional upset with an 
additive association in participants with exposure 
to both in the 1 hour before acute myocardial 
infarction.
• We do not report effect modification by previous 
cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk fac-
tor burden, cardiovascular prevention medica-
tions, or time and day of onset of symptoms.
What are the clinical implications?
• Our findings suggest that clinicians should advise 
patients to minimize exposure to extremes of 
anger or emotional upset because of the potential 
risk of triggering acute myocardial infarction.
• Our findings suggest that heavy or vigorous phys-
ical exertion (but not any physical activity) may 
trigger a myocardial infarction.
• Therefore, given the established benefits of regu-
lar physical activity over the long term, clinicians 
should continue to advise patients about the life-
long benefits of exercise.

his/her own control. The case period was defined as the 1 hour 
before the onset of symptoms of AMI, and the control period 
was defined as the same 1-hour period on the day before the 
onset of symptoms. Conditional logistic regression was used 
to estimate odds ratios and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
physical exertion and anger or emotional upset within the case 
period compared with the control period. Because each partici-
pant acts as his or her own control, multivariable adjustment 
for baseline confounding factors was not required, but we did 
adjust for the other triggering event, because it varied with 
time, and the interaction between both triggers was signifi-
cant (P<0.001). Population-attributable risk was calculated10 
from the proportion of participants with exposure to potential 
triggers in the case and control periods; 99% CIs are also 
reported. The Breslow-Day test of homogeneity was used to 
ensure that the conditional relationship between potential trig-
gers and AMI was consistent by time and day of onset of AMI.11
Analyses were stratified by the following prespecified sub-
groups: age (<45, 45–65, >65 years), sex, smoking, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, obesity, angina, stroke, and INTERHEART 
risk score. For physical exertion only, subgroup analyses were 
also stratified by baseline level of physical activity. For anger 
or emotional upset only, subgroup analyses were also strati-
fied by baseline level of chronic stress, depression, and level 
of education. We explored for differences in the observed asso-
ciations by medications commonly used for the prevention of 
cardiovascular disease12 (aspirin, β-blockers, angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme inhibitors, and cholesterol-lowering therapies), 
geographical region, and the time of day and day of the week 
of onset of AMI. As sensitivity analyses, we first excluded par-
ticipants with exposure to alcohol in the 24 hours before AMI.13 
Second, we included the controls from INTERHEART (ie, partici-
pants without AMI) and completed a case-control analysis using 
conditional logistic regression, adjusting for the other trigger, 
the interaction term between triggers, age, sex, education, and 
the primary modifiable risk factors previously identified from 
INTERHEART (lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, fruit and vegetable 
intake, alcohol, physical activity).2
Differential effects between subgroups were considered to 
be significant if the interaction term between the subgroup and 
the exposure was statistically significant; to address multiple 
testing, a value of P<0.01 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata/MP 
13.1 for Mac except population-attributable risk, for which R 
version 3.3.1 for Mac was used.
resUlts
Of the 12 
461 included patients with AMI, the mean age 
was 58.1 years (SD, 12.2 years), 75.9% (n=9459) were 
male, and there was representation from multiple ethnici-
ties (online-only Data Supplement Table I).
Physical exertion as a trigger
Physical exertion was reported by 13.6% (n=1650) of 
participants during the case period and 9.1% (n=1111) 
during the control period. There were no significant dif-
ferences between those who reported physical exertion 
in the case period and those who did not (P>0.01 for all; 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Compared 
with the control period, the adjusted odds of AMI asso-
ciated with physical exertion occurring during the case 
period was 2.31 (99% CI, 1.96–2.72) with a population-
attributable risk of 7.7% (99% CI, 6.3–8.8; Figure 1). 
There was no statistically significant effect modification 
(all P>0.01) on analyses stratified by age group, sex, 
smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, angi-
na, stroke INTERHEART risk score, or baseline physical 
activity.
anger or emotional Upset as a trigger
Anger or emotional upset was reported by 14.4% 
(n=1746) of participants during the case period and 
9.9% (n=1210) during the control period. There were no 
significant differences between those who reported an-
ger or emotional upset in the case period and those who 
did not (P>0.01 for all; Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Compared with the control period, the ad-
justed odds of AMI associated with anger or emotional 
upset occurring during the case period was 2.44 (99% 
CI, 2.06–2.89) with a population-attributable risk of 8.5% 
(99% CI, 7.0–9.6; Figure 2). There was no statistically 
significant effect modification (all P>0.01) on analyses 
stratified by age group, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, obesity, angina, stroke, INTERHEART risk 
score, levels of stress, depression, or level of education.
effects of Both triggers
Compared with exposure to neither trigger during the 
control period, the adjusted odds of AMI associated with 
exposure to both physical exertion and anger or emo-
tional upset occurring during the case period was 3.05 
(99% CI, 2.29–4.07; P for interaction <0.001).
effect Modification by cardiovascular 
Medications
There was no statistically significant effect modification 
for physical exertion or anger or emotional upset on anal-
yses stratified by cardiovascular prevention medications 
before AMI, including aspirin, β-blockers, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, and cholesterol-lowering 
therapy (Figure 3).
effect Modification by geographical region and 
timing of aMi
There was no effect modification by geographical region 
for either trigger (Figure 4). The conditional relationship 
between physical exertion and AMI was consistent by 
time of onset (P for homogeneity=0.08) and day of on-
set (P for homogeneity=0.95). Similarly, the  
conditional

relationship between anger or emotional upset and 
AMI was consistent by time of onset (P for homogene-
ity=0.17) and day of onset (P for homogeneity=0.99). 
The odds of AMI occurring with either trigger tended to 
be highest between 6 pm and midnight and lowest be-
tween midnight and 6 am.
sensitivity analyses
There was no material change in the observed associa-
tions with the exclusion of participants with exposure to 
alcohol in the 24 hours before AMI for physical exertion 
(P for interaction=0.091) or anger or emotional upset 
(P for interaction=0.690). Heavy physical exertion was 
reported by 6.0% (790 of 13 
071) of INTERHEART con-
trols, and anger or emotional upset was reported by 7.2 
(945 of 13 
071). Compared with INTERHEART controls 
the adjusted odds of AMI associated with physical exer-
tion in cases was 3.08 (99% CI, 2.50–3.81). The ad-
justed odds of AMI associated with anger or emotional 
upset in cases was 2.41 (99% CI, 1.99–2.92).
discUssiOn
In this large, international study, we report that heavy 
physical exertion and anger or emotional upset occur-
ring in the 1 hour before first AMI are common (reported 
by 1 in 7 cases) and confirm that both exposures may 
act as external triggers for AMI. We extend previous 
findings that physical exertion and anger or emotional 
may act as external triggers for AMI14–21 to a large, 
 
international population (Figure 4). It is important to note 
that we found no significant regional differences in the 
observed association, despite differences in prevalence 
of exposure to the triggers. In addition, we report an 
additive effect of both physical exertion and anger or 
emotional upset in the case period.
Physical exertion and emotions (including anger and 
emotional upset) are reported to cause sympathetic 
activation,14 catecholamine secretion,22 systemic vaso-
constriction, and increase heart rate and blood pres-
sure, thereby modifying myocardial oxygen demand,23–26 
which may precipitate the rupture of an already vulner-
able atherosclerotic plaque.27 Therefore, it is not surpris-
ing that we identified an additive effect of both physical 
exertion and anger or emotional upset in the case pe-
riod (odds ratio, 3.05; 99% CI, 2.29–4.07; P for interac-
tion <0.001). Other potential triggers, including viewing 
stressful sporting events28,29 and ecological events such 
as earthquakes,30–32 have been implicated for similar 
reasons. These findings led to recommendations that 
the link between triggering events and their pathophysi-
ological consequences may be reduced through the use 
of aspirin, β-blockers, statins, or angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors.33 However, we report no effect modi-
fication by cardiovascular prevention medication for AMI 
associated with physical exertion or anger or emotional 
upset. Therefore, our report highlights difficulties with 
primary prevention of AMI associated with external trig-
gering events.33
Exposure to external triggers is common and clearly 
does not always lead to AMI, and it is likely that external

triggering events precipitate AMI only in the setting of bio-
logically active plaques that may be particularly vulnerable 
to plaque erosion,34 which vary significantly between indi-
viduals. The case-crossover design is a powerful approach 
to study potential external triggers for AMI and effect modi-
fication because each individual serves as his or her own 
control, thereby controlling for many potential confound-
ers.35–37 We report no significant effect modifications for 
either trigger, unlike previous reports of increased odds 
of AMI in men with physical exertion3 or increased odds 
of AMI in those with the lowest baseline levels of stress.15
Regular physical activity is known to play a role in the 
long-term prevention of cardiovascular disease,38 and pre-
vious studies report the greatest magnitude of association 
between physical activity as a trigger of AMI in sedentary 
individuals.9,39 However, although vigorous physical exer-
tion may act as a trigger of AMI, we did not find any effect 
modification in the association by baseline level of physi-
cal activity. Importantly, our findings suggest that heavy 
physical exertion may be a trigger for AMI, rather than 
any physical activity, because the INTERHEART controls 
were more habitually active. Therefore, clinicians should

continue to recommend regular physical activity, while 
highlighting that short-term intense physical activity may 
carry a risk of triggering AMI.
Although long-term exposure to established cardio-
vascular risk factors (eg, lipids, diabetes mellitus) is 
associated with 90% of the population-attributable risk 
of AMI,40 they do not modify the association between 
triggering risk factors and AMI.41 We report no effect 
modification by previous cardiovascular disease, risk 
factors, or INTEHEART risk score. We confirm previous 
reports that cardiovascular events are more common 
earlier in the day,22 because the majority of cases of 
AMI occurred between 6 am and 6 pm. Similarly, we 
report no significant difference in associations with 
triggering events throughout the day,39,42 although 
there was a tendency toward the greatest magnitude 
of association for either trigger between 6 pm and mid-
night. In addition, we found no effect modification by 
day of onset of AMI for either trigger, suggesting that 
these triggers do not appear to be triggered by work-
related activity. Taken together, these results from IN-
TERHEART suggest that further research is needed to 
identify those most vulnerable to the effects of exter-
nal triggers through risk stratification.
The main strengths of this study include the large, 
international nature of the cohort with first AMI and the 
ability to explore the role of effect modifiers because of 
the sample size. INTERHEART includes large numbers 
of individuals from all regions of the world and multiple 
ethnicities, making the results broadly applicable, un-
like previous studies of potential triggers that were per-
formed primarily in 1 country or region.9,16,18–21,39,43–47 IN-
TERHEART also includes only participants with first AMI, 
thereby reducing the  
possibility that altered lifestyles or 
risk factors resulting from previous AMI would affect our 
estimates. In addition, sensitivity analyses including the 
controls from INTERHEART using multivariable-adjusted 
conditional logistic regression yielded similar associa-
tions. Consistent with previous studies, we defined the 
case period as the 1 hour immediately preceding the 
onset of symptoms of AMI because the risk of AMI asso-
ciated with external triggers decreases significantly with 
time after exposure.47 In addition, although it is plausible 
that the effect of external triggers may last longer than 
1 hour, this would bias toward the null because the effect 
of exposure earlier than 1 hour before AMI would be not 
counted in the effect of the exposure in the case period. 
Although no previous studies report emotional upset as 
a trigger for MI, negative emotion,17 acute depression,48 
and work-related stress49 are reported as triggers for 
AMI, similar to our  
findings.
The main limitation of this study is recall bias be-
cause participants who experienced AMI may differ-
entially recall the intensity of exposure to either trig-
gering event and participants may recall exposures as 
more proximate to the MI than it actually was.50 Using 
only cases of AMI and the case-crossover approach, in 
which each participant acts as his or her own  
control, 
reduces but does not eliminate the effect of differences 
in perception between participants. In addition, sensitiv-
ity analyses including cases and controls from INTER-
HEART, adopting the case-control approach, revealed 
similar associations. Second, INTERHEART uses an 
observational design, meaning that we cannot estab-
lish causation. Third, exposure to potential triggering 
events was self-reported and objective scales were

not used, as in some previous studies. However, our 
primary findings are consistent with multiple previous 
studies, suggesting that our measurements of the ex-
posures are equally valid. Fourth, although standard-
ized methodology was used in all regions, risk factors 
(including diabetes mellitus and hypertension) were 
self-reported. However, this would likely result in an 
underestimation of the prevalence of risk factors and 
bias estimates toward the null. Fifth, our study includes 
only patients hospitalized with AMI who may not be rep-
resentative of all cases of AMI occurring within popu-
lations. Similarly, because INTERHEART includes only 
those patients presenting with first AMI and defined 
symptoms, these data cannot be applied to the impact 
of triggering events in a secondary prevention popula-
tion or in those with atypical AMI.
cOnclUsiOns
We report that physical exertion and anger or emotional 
upset are common in the 1 hour before the onset of 
symptoms of AMI and that either exposure may act as an 
external trigger for AMI. The greatest magnitude of as-
sociation was seen in those with both physical exertion 
and anger or emotional upset in the 1 hour before the 
onset of symptoms of AMI. We report no differences by 
geographical region, previous cardiovascular disease, 
cardiovascular prevention medications, cardiovascular 
risk factors, and INTERHEART risk score.
