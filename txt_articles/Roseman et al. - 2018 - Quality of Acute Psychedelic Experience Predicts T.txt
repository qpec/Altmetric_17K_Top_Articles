Introduction: It is a basic principle of the “psychedelic” treatment model that the quality
of the acute experience mediates long-term improvements in mental health. In the
present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin
for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In line with previous reports, we hypothesized
that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN) (sharing features
with mystical-type experience) and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) (similar to anxiety)
would predict long-term positive outcomes, whereas sensory perceptual effects would
have negligible predictive value.
Materials and Methods:
Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression
underwent treatment with psilocybin (two separate sessions: 10 and 25 mg psilocybin).
The Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire was used to assess the quality
of experiences in the 25 mg psilocybin session. From the ASC, the dimensions OBN and
DED were used to measure the mystical-type and challenging experiences, respectively.
The Self-Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) at 5 weeks
served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure, as in later time points some of the
subjects had gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding inferences. In a
repeated measure ANOVA, Time was the within-subject factor (independent variable),
with QIDS-SR as the within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week,
5-weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. OBN-by-Time and DED-by-Time
interactions were the primary outcomes of interest.
Results:
For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time (QIDS-SR as dependent
variable), the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were
all significant (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively, for main effects), confirming our
main hypothesis. Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation of OBN with QIDS-SR (5 weeks)
was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC (p < 0.05).
Discussion:
This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute
psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long-term changes in mental health.

INTRODUCTION
Psychedelic therapy may be more appropriately thought of
as a distinct form of (drug-assisted) psychotherapy than as a
pure pharmacotherapy. Psychedelic therapy involves a small
number of high-dose psychedelic dosing sessions that are
intended to facilitate a profound, potentially transformative
psychological experience (Dyck, 2006; Maji´
c et al., 2015).
Psychedelic dosing sessions do not take place in isolation but
rather are flanked by psychological preparation and integration.
Preparation is intended to facilitate trust and rapport and
a mind-set tuned toward emotional openness and “letting
go” of psychological resistance (Richards, 2015; Russ and
Elliott, 2017). Dosing sessions themselves typically take place
in a welcoming environment, with dim lighting, eye-shades,
calming
and
emotionally-directing
music,
with
empathic
support provided by trained therapists. The integration sessions
subsequent to the dosing session(s) involve the same therapists
(usually two) listening to the patient’s narrative of their
experience, which may include e.g., details of specific emotional
insights.
A guiding principle of psychedelic psychotherapy is that
the occurrence of a profound, potentially transformative
psychological experience is critical to the treatment’s efficacy.
Evidence has shown that high-dose psychedelic sessions can
reliably produce profound psychological experiences rated
among the most “meaningful” of a person’s life (Griffiths et al.,
2006). A number of research teams have referred to these
profound experiences and have applied relevant rating scales
that have evolved out of studies of spontaneous and drug-
induced “mystical,” “spiritual,” “peak” or “religious” experiences
(Maslow, 1959; Stace, 1960; Pahnke and Richards, 1966; Maclean
et al., 2012). Regardless of the terms chosen to define them,
evidence suggests that profound psychological experiences can
be predictive of subsequent psychological health, whether
induced by psychedelics (O’Reilly and Funk, 1964; Klavetter
and Mogar, 1967; Pahnke et al., 1970; Kurland et al., 1972;
Richards et al., 1977; Maclean et al., 2011; Garcia-Romeu et al.,
2014; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson
et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016), or other means (James, 1902;
Maslow, 1959; Noyes Jr, 1980; Ludwig, 1985; Csikszentmihalyi
and Csikszentmihalyi, 1992; Snell and Simmonds, 2015).
Furthermore, some recent ketamine for depression studies
have also found an association between the quality of acute
experience (Sos et al., 2013; Luckenbaugh et al., 2014)—including
the occurrence of mystical-type experiences (Dakwar et al.,
2014)—subsequent positive clinical outcomes. Given the growing
evidence favoring the therapeutic value of psychedelics (dos
Santos et al., 2016; Rucker et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris and
Goodwin, 2017), it is timely that we better understand their
therapeutic mechanisms.
The so-called “mystical” experience has been a classic problem
area for mainstream psychology—if not science more generally.
The term “mystical” is particularly problematic, as it suggests
associations with the supernatural that may be obstructive or
even antithetical to scientific method and progress (Carhart-
Harris and Goodwin, 2017). It is important to note that by using
the term the mystical-type experience, we are referring only to the
phenomenology of the experience and are keen not to endorse
any associations between it and supernatural or metaphysical
ideas. Readers interested in the phenomenology of mystical-
type/peak experiences may wish to explore these classic texts
(James, 1902; Stace, 1960; Maslow, 1964; Pahnke and Richards,
1966; Csikszentmihalyi and Csikszentmihalyi, 1992; Hood Jr
et al., 2009; Richards, 2015).
In the late 1960s, William Richards and Walter Pahnke
(former pupils of Abraham Maslow and Timothy Leary
respectively) developed a measure of “peak” or “mystical-type”
experience that was much inspired by the work of Stace (1960).
Studying reports of “mystical-type” experiences occurring in a
variety of different world religions, Stace identified a number of
common or “universal” components that are largely independent
of religious or cultural context (Stace, 1960). Based on this
landmark work, Richards and Pahnke developed the “mystical
experience questionnaire” (MEQ) designed to enquire whether
related components featured in the psychedelic drug experience.
The scale measured six components of experience: (1) sense of
unity or oneness, (2) transcendence of time and space, (3) deeply
felt positive mood, (4) sense of awesomeness, reverence and
wonder, (5) meaningfulness of psychological or philosophical
insight, (6) ineffability and paradoxicality (Pahnke and Richards,
1966; Pahnke et al., 1970). A similar questionnaire which is based
on Stace (1960) is the “M scale” (Hood Jr, 1975). Both the MEQ
and M scale have been found to be predictive of long-term
positive therapeutic outcomes in trials of psilocybin for cancer-
related distress (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016), tobacco
smoking (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016) and
alcohol dependence (Bogenschutz et al., 2015).
Perhaps the most widely used subjective measure of altered
states of consciousness, and particularly the psychedelic state, is
the altered states of consciousness questionnaire (ASC) (Dittrich,
1998). We chose this scale over the MEQ as it measures a broader
range of subjective phenomena, not just the “mystical-type
experience.” Crucially, this enabled us to test the specificity of
the relationship between mystical-type experiences (vs. e.g.,
perceptual changes) and subsequent therapeutic outcomes. One
of the principal ASC factors is named “oceanic boundlessness”
(OBN)—a term that has its origins in a conversation between

 Roseman et al.
Psilocybin Experience Predicts Decreased Depression
Sigmund Freud and the French intellectual and “mystic” Romain
Rolland (Freud, 1920) and makes reference to an “oceanic
feeling” of boundlessness (Freud, 1929). Sharing a common
intellectual background in Stace (1960) (Maji´
c et al., 2015), items
belonging to the OBN are closely related to those found in the
MEQ. Previous factor analyses have parcellated the ASC into
either 5 (Dittrich, 1998) or 11 dimensions (Studerus et al., 2010).
As one of the original 5 ASC factors, OBN is explicitly linked
to Stace’s “mystical experience”, (Studerus et al., 2010) and 4 of
the 11 revised ASC factors also relate to OBN. Explicitly, the
4 OBN sub-factors are named “insightfulness,” “blissful state,”
“experience of unity” and “spiritual experience” (Studerus et al.,
2010).
We recently completed an open-label clinical trial assessing
the feasibility of treating 20 patients with treatment-resistant
depression (TRD) with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017).
Results were encouraging: 47% of patients showed a clinically
significant response 5 weeks post treatment (≥50% reduction
in depressive symptoms). The present study sought to extend
on our previous reports on this trial, by specifically focusing
on whether the quality of the acute psychedelic experience was
predictive of longer-term clinical outcomes. Specifically, we asked
whether psilocybin-induced OBN and Dread of Ego Dissolution
(DED) (related to acute anxiety) were predictive of decreases in
depression at a key endpoint, whether the relationship between
OBN and decreased depression was significantly stronger than
between psilocybin’s more generic sensory perceptual effects and
depression changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This trial received a favorable opinion from the National
Research Ethics Service London—West London, was sponsored
and approved by Imperial College London’s Joint Research and
Compliance Office (JRCO), and was adopted by the National
Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network. The
National Institute for Health Research/Wellcome Trust Imperial
Clinical Research Facility gave site-specific approval for the
study. The study was reviewed and approved by the Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and a
Home Office Schedule One license was obtained for drug storage
and administration. All participants provided written informed
consent after receiving a complete description of the study.
Design
The full study procedure is reported in Carhart-Harris et al.
(2016a). The inclusion criteria were major depression of a
moderate to severe degree (16+ on the 21-item Hamilton
Depression Rating scale [HAM-D]), and no improvement despite
two adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. The patients
were asked to be antidepressants-free for at least 2 weeks
before the study. Twenty patients underwent two psilocybin-
assisted therapy sessions, a week apart. The first involved
a low-dose of psilocybin (10 mg, p.o.), and the second, a
high-dose (25 mg, p.o.). Post capsule ingestion, patients lay
with eyes closed and listened to music pre-selected by the
research team (Kaelen et al., 2017) (https://www.mixcloud.com/
MendelKa/playlists/psilocybin-v13/). Two therapists adopted a
non-directive, supportive approach, allowing the patient to
experience a mostly uninterrupted introspection. Preparation
session occurred 1 week before the 10 mg psilocybin dose and the
integration session occurred 1-day and 1-week after the 25 mg
psilocybin dose. Out of the initial 20 patients, 19 completed the
study (6 females; mean age = 44.7 ± 10.9; 27 to 64). Eight more
subjects were added to the study since publication of the initial 12
in Carhart-Harris et al. (2016a)—for a full clinical report of the 20
patients see Carhart-Harris et al. (2017).
Clinical Outcomes
Post-treatment
ratings
of
relevant
symptomatology
were
compared against those collected at baseline (before therapy).
The main clinical outcome for this analysis was the self-rated 16-
item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR16 or
just “QIDS-SR” for brevity). Five weeks after the 25 mg psilocybin
session was chosen as the primary endpoint. The reason for
this was that after 5 weeks, the next point of data collection
was 3 months, and at this time-point some of the subjects had
gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding potential
inferences. The response rate (≥50% reduction in QIDS-SR
scores) at the 5 week time point was 47% (n = 9). Secondary
clinical outcomes were used to further examine the hypothesis
that the mystical-type experience relates to positive clinical
outcome. These secondary measures were QIDS-SR at 1-day,
1-week, 3-months, and 6-months; Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI, original version) at 1-week, 3-months, and 6-months;
Clinician rated Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D)
at 1-week; Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS; measures trait
pessimism) at 1-week and 3-months; Spielberger’s Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI) at 1-day, 1-week, 3-months, and 6-months;
Life Orientation Test Revisited (LOT-R; measures optimism)
at 1-week and 3-months; and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale
(SHAPS;
measures
anhedonia)
at
1-week
and
3-months.
Standard criteria for meaningful “response” were calculated for
the depression rating scales (≥50% from baseline).
Measures of Acute Psilocybin Session
The altered state of consciousness questionnaire (ASC) (Dittrich,
1998) was used to measure the acute subjective experience. It
was completed retrospectively by the patient as the psilocybin
session was coming to an end (i.e., ∼5–6 h post ingestion). As
stated above, the ASC can be divided into 5 (Dittrich, 1998) (94
items), or 11 dimensions (Studerus et al., 2010) (42 items). The 5
dimensions are: OBN, DED, visionary restructuralization (VRS),
auditory alterations (AUA), and vigilance reduction (VIR) (n.b.
translation from the German original may explain the slightly
peculiar choice of terms e.g., “visionary restructuralization”).
As noted above, the OBN items were formulated based on six
of the nine categories of “mystical experiences” proposed by
Stace (1960) (Bodmer et al., 1994; Studerus et al., 2010) in a
similar way to the MEQ (Pahnke and Richards, 1966; Maclean
et al., 2012). Dread of ego-dissolution is considered to probe
negative, aversive experiences in which anxiety is a central aspect.
Visionary restructuralization measures altered perception and
meaning including visual hallucinations and synesthesia. The 11
sub-dimensions are made only from OBN, DED and VRS. The
OBN sub-dimensions are experience of unity, spiritual experience,
Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org

 Roseman et al.
Psilocybin Experience Predicts Decreased Depression
blissful state, insightfulness, and disembodiment. The DED sub-
dimensions are impaired control or cognition, and Anxiety. The
VRS sub-dimensions are complex imagery, elementary imagery,
audio/visual synaesthesia, and changed meaning of percepts.
We hypothesized that OBN and DED would predict clinical
outcome up to 5 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we used
repeated measure ANOVA. (analysis was done in SPSS v24,
GLM with repeated measures). Time was the within-subject
factor (independent variable), with QIDS-SR as the within-
subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks.
OBN and DED were independent variables (covariates in SPSS).
OBN-by-Time and DED-by-Time interactions were the primary
outcomes of interest. The contrast for the within-subject factor
was simple, comparing each level to the 1st one (baseline).
Furthermore, we hypothesized specificity in the relationship
between OBN and depression changes by comparing the strength
of this correlation with that between the perceptual factors
from the ASC, namely VRS and AUA, and depression changes
(Steiger, 1980; Lee and Preacher, 2013). A threshold of OBN >
0.6 was used to distinguish a “complete” OBN. This threshold
is similar to MEQ > 0.6 which was used in other studies
to identify “peakers” and “complete mystical-type experience”
(Pahnke et al., 1970; Richards et al., 1977; Maclean et al., 2011;
Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016). In a different
study, OBN and MEQ showed a Pearson correlation of 0.93
(Liechti et al., 2017), suggesting that these two questionnaire
quantify a similar experience and that a similar threshold can be
used. For descriptive purposes, we tested whether those patients
who had a “complete” OBN had a better clinical outcome. This
analysis was done to expand the initial hypothesis to other time
points and questionnaires.
We also issued participants an in-house measure, the 29-
item “psychedelic questionnaire” (PQ)—which was completed at
the same time as the ASC. The PQ has been previously used
in a number of our pharmacological challenge studies due to
its brevity relative to the full ASC (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012,
2016b). As a descriptive exploratory analysis, correlation between
PQ and clinical outcome at 5 weeks was calculated for all items.
The same exploratory analysis was also done on all of the 94 items
of the ASC.
RESULTS
Prediction of QIDS-SR up to 5 Weeks
These following are primary results of this study. Table 1 presents
the results of the repeated measures ANOVA with Time as the
within-subject factor (independent variable), QIDS-SR as the
within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-
weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. [Sphericity
assumed: Mauchly’s W = 0.71 (p = 0.411)]. For the interactions
of Time X OBN, and Time X DED, the within-subjects effect
and the within-subjects contrasts at each time point compared
to baseline were all significant (p < 0.05), confirming our
main hypothesis. Regression analysis with �QIDS-SR (5-weeks)
as a dependent variable and OBN and DED as independent
variables found that together they explain 54% of the variance
(r2 = 0.59, adjusted r2 = 0.54; standardized beta values of
OBN, DED, were 0.605, −0.649, respectively). For descriptive

Time is the within-subject factor (independent variable), QIDS-SR is the within-subject
dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks. OBN and DED are independent
variables. Time-by-OBN and Time-by-DED interactions are the primary outcomes of
interest (within-subjects effects). Within-subjects simple contrasts are calculated for each
time point compared to baseline. A significant within-subject contrast suggests a linear
relationship between OBN or DED and the difference between time points in QIDS-SR.

purposes, Figure 1 presents plots of Pearson’s correlation of
the 5 dimensions of the ASC predicting �QIDS-SR (5 weeks).
Furthermore, based on a standard threshold for defining clinical
response (≥50% reduction in QIDS-SR score at 5 weeks vs.
baseline), a comparison of responders (n = 9) vs. non-responders
(n = 10) in the 11D ASC scores is presented for descriptive
purposes in Figure 2.
As hypothesized, OBN was a significantly better predictor of
reductions in depression than both VRS and AUA (z = 1.64 and
z = 2.01, respectively, p < 0.05) (Steiger, 1980; Lee and Preacher,
2013).
Prediction of Secondary Clinical Measures
The following are the secondary results of this study. Clinical
outcomes for “complete” OBN were compared with those for
“non-complete” OBN for secondary clinical outcomes such as
measures of trait anxiety, anhedonia, optimism and pessimism
(Table 2). Patients that had “complete” OBN (n = 11, OBN =
0.83 ± 0.1) had better outcomes than those who did not (n =
8, OBN = 0.33 ± 0.16), on a number of different measures and
at different time points (1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks, 3-months, and
6-months). Response rates of “complete” OBN are presented in
Table 2.
In further exploratory analyses, correlations were calculated
between all 94 items of the ASC and �QIDS-SR and were ordered
by the strength of correlation (Table S1). The same was done for
all 29 items of the PQ (Table S2). In both examples, it is apparent
that items that best relate to OBN correlate most strongly with
positive clinical outcomes, while sensory phenomena correlate
less, and anxiety is predictive of worse outcomes.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with our prior hypothesis, psilocybin-induced high
OBN (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and low

DED (similar to anxiety) predicted positive long-term clinical
outcomes in a clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD. This result
replicates those of previous studies showing that psychedelic-
induced peak or mystical-type experiences are predictive of
positive long-term outcomes (O’Reilly and Funk, 1964; Klavetter
and Mogar, 1967; Pahnke et al., 1970; Kurland et al., 1972;
Richards et al., 1977; Maclean et al., 2011; Bogenschutz et al.,
2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016).
This relationship appears to be somewhat specific, in that OBN
was significantly more predictive of positive clinical outcomes
than altered visual and auditory perception—endorsing the
moniker “psychedelic” (“mind-revealing”) over “hallucinogen”
when referring to this class of drug—at least in the context of
psychedelic therapy. It also suggests that the therapeutic effects of
psilocybin are not a simple product of isolated pharmacological
action but rather are experience dependent. We also found
that greater DED (anxiety and impaired cognition) experienced
during the drug session was predictive of less positive clinical
outcomes.
One may naturally infer from these findings that the
occurrence of OBN or mystical-type experience mediates long-
term positive clinical outcomes (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al.,
2016) and while this assumption may be valid, we must exercise
caution about ascribing too much to this relationship. It remains
possible that as yet unmeasured and therefore unaccounted
for components of psychedelic therapy play important roles
in mediating long-term outcomes. There are several candidate
factors in this regard, and the following should not be considered
an exhaustive list: emotional insight/breakthrough or catharsis;
priming and suggestibility; reliving of trauma/defining life events;
insights about the self and relationships; the patients relationship
to music heard; his/her success at “letting go”; the quality of
therapeutic relationship; and the degree of “closure” attained
during post-drug integration work (Frederking, 1955; Sandison,
1955; Abramson, 1956; Martin, 1957; Eisner and Cohen, 1958;
Leuner, 1961; Jensen, 1963; Shagass and Bittle, 1967; Richards,
1978; Loizaga-Velder, 2013; Gasser et al., 2014; Belser et al., 2017;
Russ and Elliott, 2017; Watts et al., 2017).
These factors may exert influence before, during and after
the acute experience itself and may also be more or less
dependent on particular psychological frameworks and their
relevant vocabularies. For example, the psychoanalytic models
of Freud and Jung were dominant in psychiatry in the mid-
twentieth century and thus references to ego, repression and the
unconscious are commonplace among the psychedelic research
literature of this period. While the processes that underlie these
constructs may indeed be operative in the context of psychedelics,
little effort has been made to define, measure and quantify their

contributions (Shagass and Bittle, 1967; Barr et al., 1972). The
development of subjective (Nour et al., 2016), behavioral and
biological measures (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2016b; Lebedev
et al., 2015; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016) relevant to these constructs,
and more importantly, the processes that underlie them, would
represent an important advance not just for psychedelic science
but for the psychological frameworks themselves (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2014). We should be conscious of not being
too attached (or averse) to any specific theoretical frameworks
however, and approaches that endeavor to access “framework-
free” descriptions of phenomena may prove particularly useful
in this regard (Varela, 1996; Petitmengin, 2006). Critically, it is
our view that it is possible to work toward a secular, biologically-
informed account of the mystical-type experience that does
not resort to “explaining away” or “reducing down” the core
phenomenology and depth psychology may be a useful bedfellow
in this regard.
Returning to the present study’s main findings, DED was
found to negatively correlate with clinical outcome, yet, none
of the patients showed a worsening of clinical symptoms at
5 weeks. Less DED combined with high OBN predicted 54%
of the variance of clinical change at 5 weeks—a substantial
contribution and one that helps justify the emphasis placed on
minimizing anxiety and relinquishing psychological resistance in
psychedelic therapy (Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Sherwood et al.,
1962; Grof et al., 2008; Richards, 2015), as well as paying careful
attention to preparation and “set and setting” (Hartogsohn,
2017; Carhart-Harris et al., in press). That anxiety arises in
parallel with psychological struggle is resonant with principles
of psychoanalytic theory (Sandison, 1961), as can be seen in the
choice of terms for the “DED” and “OBN” factors of the ASC—
both of which invoke constructs that can be traced to Freud
(1929, 1962).
According to psychoanalytic theory, the overcoming of
psychological resistance is required for emotional breakthrough
and insight (Freud, 1920) and the occurrence of mystical-
type/peak experiences (Jung, 2014). Consistently, writers on
the mystical-type/peak experience have reliably identified loss
of self or “ego-dissolution” as one of its basic pre-requisites
and features (James, 1902; Stace, 1960; Maslow, 1964). Recent
work has sought to develop and validate a measure that is
sensitive to difficult or challenging psychedelic experiences
(Barrett et al., 2016; Carbonaro et al., 2016) and there is some
evidence that the intensity of such experiences is predictive of
positive long-term outcomes, whereas the duration of struggle is
predictive of negative outcomes (Carbonaro et al., 2016). This is
presumably because the successful resolution of conflict brings
with it, insight and relief, whereas the failure to breakthrough
perpetuates suffering. ASC and other questionnaires such
as the challenging experience questionnaire (CEQ) (Barrett
et al., 2016) may be insensitive to whether or not successful
resolution of psychological conflict has occurred. Therefore,
the development of new scales specifically designed to focus
on emotional breakthrough after struggle may add considerable
value.
Improving our subjective measures of high-level human
experiences such as the mystical-type/peak experience will
enhance our ability to understand their psychology and
underlying neural substrates. As touched on in the introduction,
psychopharmacology
is
increasingly
acknowledging
the
importance of “context” and particularly “environment” as a
factor mediating the effects of both intrinsic neurobiological
features
(e.g.,
genotypes)
and
exogenous
pharmacological
inputs—such as drugs (Alexander et al., 1981; Caspi et al., 2010).
For example, a recent popular model of the action of SSRIs
incorporates “environment” and cognitive (re)appraisal (Harmer
et al., 2017) as key determinants of therapeutic efficacy (see also
Branchi, 2011; Belsky, 2016). Like SSRIs, classic psychedelic
drugs also work on the serotonin system; however, unlike the
SSRIs, they are direct agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor (Nichols,
2016). There is compelling evidence that the 5-HT2A receptor
is psychedelics’ key site of action (Nichols, 2016). Intriguingly,
recent work has found that the phenotypic expression of 5-
HT2AR genotypes is significantly dependent on the influence
of “environment” (Jokela et al., 2007). These findings may
imply that enhanced sensitivity to context is an important
function of 5-HT2A receptor signaling (Carhart-Harris and
Nutt, 2017).
Ascending from the pharmacological to the whole-brain
systems level, increased cortical entropy has been found to
be a reliable feature of the psychedelic state (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2014), to relate to high-level subjective experiences such
as “ego-dissolution” (Nour et al., 2016; Atasoy et al., 2017;
Schartner et al., 2017) that are relevant to the mystical-type
experience, and to be predictive of longer-term trait changes—
such as increased “openness” (Lebedev et al., 2016). Recent
work suggests that increased brain entropy under psychedelics is
consistent with the brain being more closely tuned to “criticality”
(Atasoy et al., 2017). Criticality refers to systems that reside in
a functional “sweet spot”, critically poised between order and
disorder—in which they can effectively retain information (by
being sufficiently ordered) while being appropriately adaptive
and sensitive to change (by being sufficiently disordered).
Intriguingly, one of the signatures of a critical system is
a sensitivity to perturbation (Bak, 1996). It follows that
enhanced sensitivity to perturbation in a psychedelically-
induced “entropic” and “critical” brain may account for the
special sensitivity to “environment” that is characteristic of
the psychedelic state (Hartogsohn, 2016; Carhart-Harris et al.,
in press).
Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of OBN,
mystical-type or peak experiences (Vollenweider, 2001) should
enable us to better comprehend, define and study them.
This is important, not least because they are proving to be
important determinants of treatment success in psychedelic
therapy (Richards et al., 1977; Bogenschutz et al., 2015;
Griffiths et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ross et al.,
2016). Crucially, better understanding the biological basis of
mystical-type/peak experiences and their longer-term impact
on the mind and brain should help to demystify them,
facilitating an easier conversation about them with mainstream
psychology. Researchers in the mainstream have as much a
responsibility as those in “the periphery” to facilitate this.
Denying the relevance of these phenomena is as damaging

 Roseman et al.
Psilocybin Experience Predicts Decreased Depression
to scientific progress as denying their physical basis. The
prize for successfully integrating mystical-type experience into
mainstream science may be their potential to have a substantial
positive impact on medicine, education and society—which
ironically, may, at least in part, explain why their integration
into western society has proved so difficult to achieve (Stevens,
1987).
To summarize, the occurrence of high OBN (sharing features
with mystical-type experience) and low DED (relating to anxiety
and impaired cognition) under psilocybin predicted positive
clinical outcomes in a trial of psilocybin for TRD. This
relationship exhibited a degree of specificity, in that psilocybin-
induced OBN was significantly more predictive of reduced
depressive symptoms than the drug’s more generic visual and
auditory perceptual effects. Future work, with a larger sample
size, is required to more comprehensively and systematically
measure the influence of different potential predictive factors on
the quality of acute psychedelic experiences (Gasser et al., 2014;
Belser et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2017) and subsequent long-term
outcomes (Carhart-Harris et al., in press). As psychedelic therapy
gains influence and credibility (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin,
2017), it seems vital that appropriate consideration is paid to
the importance of promoting a certain kind of experience, as
the quality of that experience may be the critical determinant of
therapeutic success.
