Abstract
Lifestyle factors, such as food choices and exposure to chemicals, can alter DNA methylation and lead to changes in gene
activity. Two such exposures with pharmacologically active components are coffee and tea consumption. Both coffee and tea
have been suggested to play an important role in modulating disease-risk in humans by suppressing tumour progression,

 decreasing inflammation and influencing estrogen metabolism. These mechanisms may be mediated by changes in DNA
methylation. To investigate if DNA methylation in blood is associated with coffee and tea consumption, we performed a
genome-wide DNA methylation study for coffee and tea consumption in four European cohorts (N¼ 3,096). DNA methylation
was measured from whole blood at 421,695 CpG sites distributed throughout the genome and analysed in men and women both
separately and together in each cohort. Meta-analyses of the results and additional regional-level analyses were performed.
After adjusting for multiple testing, the meta-analysis revealed that two individual CpG-sites, mapping to DNAJC16 and TTC17,
were differentially methylated in relation to tea consumption in women. No individual sites were associated with men or with
the sex-combined analysis for tea or coffee. The regional analysis revealed that 28 regions were differentially methylated in rela-
tion to tea consumption in women. These regions contained genes known to interact with estradiol metabolism and cancer. No
significant regions were found in the sex-combined and male-only analysis for either tea or coffee consumption.
Introduction
Both coffee and tea include hundreds of different compounds,
which can be found and measured in blood (1–4) and that might
be associated with different outcomes. Coffee consumption has
received much attention in research, which has resulted in associ-
ations between coffee consumption and lower risk of several dis-
eases, for example, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia (5), Parkinson’s
disease (6) and type 2 diabetes (7). On the other hand, coffee con-
sumption has also been associated with an increased risk of high
blood pressure (8,9), different types of cancer (10,11) and myocar-
dial infarction (12). Both the beneficial and negative health effects
may spring from different compounds within coffee.
Even though most studies considered the impact of age, sex,
body mass index (BMI), genetics and smoking, the health effects
of coffee consumption might still be hard to separate from the
effects of people’s lifestyles and previous health problems.
Studies have shown that caffeine, the major pharmacologically
active constituent of both coffee and tea, is the explanatory
molecule for the reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease attributed
to coffee consumption (13). Caffeine also reduces dopaminergic
neurotoxicity in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (13,14).
On the other hand, the roasting of coffee leads to production of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to be carci-
nogenic (15). Tea contains substances, such as polyphenols,
which are linked to lower risk of heart disease, cancer and dia-
betes (16–20). Polyphenols are antioxidants that latch onto and
neutralize chemicals called oxidants. Oxidants have been linked
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (21,22).
Studies on smoke exposure and diet have shown that con-
sumption of bioactive components can leave a persistent mark
on the epigenetic information layer (23,24). Epigenetics is gener-
ally used to denote the regulation of genes that cannot be attrib-
uted to nucleotide variation in the DNA sequence. It includes a
number of different mechanisms of which DNA methylation is
among the most well studied. However, a systematic genome-
wide analysis of the influence of coffee and tea on DNA methyl-
ation has not been performed previously.
One reason to study the influence of coffee and tea con-
sumption on DNA methylation is that previous genetic studies
have presented evidence that individual coffee consumption
are related to genetic factors (25,26). The genetic background of
tea consumption is less conclusive at present. However, it has
previously been demonstrated that tea catechins inhibit DNA
methylation in vitro and in cultured cancer cells (27,28), arguing
that some of the health effects of tea may be mediated by epige-
netics.
In
this
study,
we
performed
an
Epigenome-Wide
Association Study (EWAS) and a regional-level analysis to deter-
mine the association between coffee and tea consumption and
changes in DNA methylation.
Results
Following exclusion of individuals lacking phenotype data, DNA
methylation data or information on any of the covariates, a final
set of 3,096 individuals from NSPHS (N¼ 723); PIVUS (N ¼ 804),
HWFS (N¼ 948) and EGM (N ¼ 621) were used in the meta-analysis
(Table 1). Coffee and tea consumption as well as mean age for all
cohorts are included in Table 1. Mean age of all included cohorts
was 56 years. Tea and coffee consumption differed between men
and women, tea consumption in women was significantly higher
in all cohorts except EGM and coffee consumption was higher in
men in all cohorts except in EGM where coffee consumption was
significantly higher in women (Table 1).
EWAS
Sex-combined analysis
In the sex-combined analyses, no individual CpG-sites were
significantly associated to either coffee or tea consumption, using
a Bonferroni threshold correcting for 421,695 sites (P < 1.19�10�7).

 Sex-stratified analysis
No CpG-sites were significantly associated with coffee or tea
in men. Neither did we see an association between coffee
and DNA-methylation in women. However, we did find an associ-
ation between DNA-methylation and tea in women. After adjust-
ing for inflation in each population (kNSPHS¼0.95, kHWFS¼1.14,
kPIVUS¼1.24, and kEGM¼1.00), no inflation was seen in the meta-
analysis (k ¼ 1.00) (Fig. 1). The lambda-adjusted analyses revealed
two significant sites, CpG-site cg18192808 (5.06�10�8), mapped to
DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C16 (DNAJC16)
and cg14055589 (9.23�10�8,) mapped to Tetratricopeptide domain
17 (TTC17) (Figs 1 and 2). cg18192808 were nominally significant
with the same direction of effect in all included populations
separately (Table 2, Fig. 3A), and cg14055589 were nominally sig-
nificant with the same direction of effect for all cohorts except
PIVUS (P ¼ 0.067) (Table 2, Fig. 3B). None of these two sites passed
QC in the EGM cohort. In men, cg18192808 and cg14055589
were not significant in the meta-analysis and overall had the
opposite direction of effect in most cohorts as compared
to women (Table 2). None of the CpG-sites located on the
sex chromosomes passed, for any of the phenotypes, even a
chromosome-wide
Bonferroni
threshold
(Px<4.45�10�6
and
Py<1.2�10�4, respectively).
The four cohorts mainly include adults and elderly people.
Therefore, we cannot conclude that the effect would be the
same in younger individuals. However, to investigate if the effect
seems to be similar between younger and older individuals we
stratified females from NSPHS into two groups. The first group
included females younger than 50 years old (N ¼ 215) and the
second group included females at the age of 50 or older (N ¼ 170).
The association between tea consumption and DNA methylation
for the two significant CpG-sites, cg18192808 and cg14055589,
show that there are no significant difference between the effects
for the two age groups for either of the two sites. For cg18192808,
the effect was �5.43�10�5 (P ¼ 0.042) and �7.08�10�5 (P ¼ 0.042),
respectively for the young
and the
older
group,
and for
cg14055589, the effect was 6.95�10�05 (P ¼ 0.069) and 0.00019
(P ¼ 0.053), respectively for the young and the older group.
Regional-level analysis
Regional-level (locus) analysis was performed using the comb-p
software (29) to identify differentially methylated regions of the
genome associated with total coffee and tea consumption.
Lambda adjusted P-values were used for this analysis. In the
sex-combined analyses and when analyzing men separately, no
significant regions were identified for tea and coffee. No signifi-
cant regions were identified for coffee in women but when ana-
lyzing
tea
in
women,
comb-p
identified
28
significantly
associated regions, located on 13 different chromosomes, map-
ping to 17 different genes (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, we identified differentially methylated CpG-sites
in whole blood that are associated with self-reported tea

 consumption in women only, but not in men. Tea consump-
tions appear to be associated with DNA methylation in women.
Women drink higher amounts of tea compared to men, which
may increase the power to find associations in women. Results
from previous studies have shown that tea consumption redu-
ces estrogen levels by catechins and theaflavines that inhibit
aromatase, an enzyme which catalyses the conversion of
androgens to estrogens. This highlights a potential difference
between the biological response to tea in men and women
(30–32). We did not find an association between DNA-methylation
and coffee, in either women or men.
Age, sex and smoking are potential confounders on the asso-
ciation between tea or coffee consumption and DNA methyla-
tion. Therefore, all analyses were adjusted for these variables
but did not stratify by reported smoking habits. In agreement
with this, our two significant sites did not overlap with findings
from a large meta-EWAS on smoking (33), making confounding
by tobacco smoking an unlikely explanation of our findings. It is
also important to note that tea and coffee findings were both
corrected for each other, making it likely that a factor associated
with tea, and not coffee, is driving the association.
The EWAS revealed two significant loci, cg18192808 and
cg14055589. cg18192808 maps to DNAJC16, which is paralogue to
DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member A3 (DNAJA3).
DNAJA3 plays a critical role in tumor suppression through its in-
teractions with oncogenic proteins (34). Interestingly, DNAJC16
has previously been shown to be up-regulated in HepG cells
upon treatment of green tea (35). The second site, cg14055589
mapped to TTC17, which plays a role in ciliogenesis (36). Both
these individual loci seem to mainly be driven by the HWFS co-
hort (Table 2 and Fig. 3A and B). This is probably due to the
larger amount of tea consumed in HWFS, which provides a
higher statistical power to detect associations within this cohort
(Table 1). As an attempt to establish whether included studies
are consistent; we present a statistical test of heterogeneity, I2,
as presented in Table 2. I2 describes the percentage of the vari-
ability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather
than by chance. The I2 values for our top CpG-sites describes a
low to moderate heterozygosity (37).
Before adjusting for inflation, two additional individual sites
were statistically significant for tea consumption in women,
cg03155301 (unadjusted P¼ 7.47�10�9, adjusted P ¼ 4.31�10�7) and
cg24165638 (unadjusted P ¼ 8.77�10�8, adjusted P¼ 8.36�10�6).
cg03155301 maps to TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1)
and showed a nominal significance in all included populations
but with an opposite direction of effect in EGM. TEAD1 plays a key
role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a pathway involved in organ
size control and tumor suppression. Interestingly, studies have re-
ported correlations between tea drinking and cancer (19,31,38).
The second site, cg24165638, mapped to azurocidin 1 (AZU1),
showed the same direction of effect in all populations, but was
not nominally significant in NSPHS and EGM. AZU1 is an interesting
gene since the protein it encodes binds heparin, which prevents
blood coagulation (39). Diseases associated with AZU1 include
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and gastric cancer (40).
It has previously been shown that tea consumption is asso-
ciated with a lower risk of developing cancer (19,31). In our re-
gional analysis, five cancer-associated genes were differentially
methylated with tea consumption in women: THBS2, which has
been shown to function as a potent inhibitor of tumour growth
(41) and angiogenesis (42); TSPAN32, which is located within an
important tumour suppressor region (43); CTBP1, which is in-
volved in promoting the carcinogenesis of human glioma (44);
SLC44A5, a potential therapeutic target in hepatocellular carci-
noma (45) and CLIC1 that is known to be overexpressed in
malignant tumours (46,47) (Table 3).
As many as six genes known to interact with estradiol
(THBS2, CTBP, ACACA, RIMS1, PLS1, CLIC1) were significantly as-
sociated with tea consumption in the regional analysis in women
(41,42,48–51). Previous studies have reported tea consumption to
lower estradiol levels, which is believed to protect against breast
cancer (31,32). It is also biologically plausible that the interaction
between tea consumption, estrogen levels and DNA methylation
would be more apparent in women compared to men.
Limitations
When correcting for inflation, only two out of the four individual
CpG-sites that were associated with tea consumption remained
significant. Inflation is usually higher in EWAS studies compared
to GWAS studies since we expect that the DNA methylation pat-
tern will change in response to many different environmental
factors. It is also reasonable to believe that part of the inflation is
due to the large impact of tea metabolites on DNA methylation,
since previous studies have shown that catechins affect DNA
methylation (27,28). Adjusting for inflation may therefore de-
crease statistical power to find significant results and interesting
findings may be revealed by the un-adjusted analysis. The only
way to be sure that we correctly adjust for cofounding is to do
controlled experiments.
Our hypothesis was that tea and coffee consumption affect
DNA methylation. However, an EWAS does not allow for

 establishing causality of the observed effects. There is a possibil-
ity that confounding variables correlated with tea consumption
are the truly causal factor behind the alterations in DNA methyl-
ation. The most obvious confounding factors that are associated
with coffee and tea consumption are smoking and age. In order
to eliminate confounding effects by smoking and age, these vari-
ables were including as covariates in all analyses. Reverse causa-
tion is also a possibility, where DNA methylation would, in itself,
affect tea and coffee consumption. Mendelian randomisation
(MR) approaches have been developed to answer this question,
but these require large study sizes to perform, and although pre-
vious studies have shown growing evidence that individual cof-
fee and caffeine consumption and response to caffeine are
related to genetic factors (25,26) and show a high heritability
(52,53) we don’t have the power to perform MR in this cohort. In
contrast, the heritability and genetic background of tea con-
sumption is less conclusive at present (30), making such MR
analyses impractical to perform as of yet for tea to ascertain the
directionality of the associations on which we report.
We did not have information about decaffeinated coffee
consumption. Consumption of decaffeinated coffee is relatively
uncommon, however, if caffeine is a factor associated with DNA
methylation our study may be biased due to missing information
on decaffeinated coffee consumption habits. Brewing technique
may also influence DNA methylation. Cafestol and kahweol,
known as coffee-specific anti-carcinogenic lipids (54) in coffee,
are extracted by boiling water, but retained by coffee filters.
Consequently, the lipid content of boiled un-filtered coffee may
be as much as 60 times higher than the lipid content of filtered
coffee (55). Since only the NSHDS cohort provided information on
coffee brewing technique, for statistical power reasons, no sub-
analysis according to brewing technique was performed.
The same is true for different types of teas that will consist of
different important constituents such as catechins and teafla-
vins, e.g. black tea (fermented), and green tea (unfermented). We
did not have information on which kind of tea that was con-
sumed. In addition, the content of caffeine in tea also depends
on the plant variety, processing of tealeaves, brewing time as
well as brewing methods. Cup size is also different between
countries, which lead to a bias in our measurement of the
amounts of beverage consumed. However, this bias is unlikely to
lead to false positives, but rather to decreased statistical power.
To perform the EWAS, we used whole blood samples. Blood
has an inter-individual variability in the fractions of different
DNA-containing blood cells. Previous studies have shown that
differences in methylation can be the result of variability in cell
composition when blood is used in DNA methylation studies
(14). We therefore corrected for variability in cell composition
(CD8T-, CD4T-, NK- and B-cells, monocytes and granulocytes) be-
tween individuals. However, we do not know if the association
between DNA methylation and coffee or tea consumption is spe-
cific to only one cell type or present in all of the individual cell
types in blood. Predicted cell proportions for the low-frequency
cell types, such as T cells, may be less accurate than those of the
higher frequency cell types. However, previous studies have also
shown that cell composition does not have a significant effect
and that it mainly depends on the exposure you are looking at
(56,57). However, studies have shown that metabolites from cof-
fee and tea consumption end up in the blood stream (1–4), mak-
ing it a directly exposed tissue and thus relevant to study in this
respect. We do not have other tissue specimens available to test
if associations are also present in tissues more directly related to
some of the health effects reported for tea consumption, such as
reduced risk of breast cancer.
The two significant CpG-sites show nominal significance
with the same direction of effect in all included cohorts, which
strengthen our results. However, replication in an independent
cohort would further confirm these associations and to clarify
which components in tea that has an effect on gene regulation,
we need to investigate the effect of tea on cell migration in vitro.
It should also be noted that the results of the regional analysis
should be interpreted with care since the consistency between
the cohorts was unclear and comb-p has been reported to some-
times induce spurious results when the association is weak (58).
In conclusion, this study did not find an association between
coffee consumption and DNA-methylation. In women, 6 genes
interacting with estradiol were observed to be associated with
tea consumption using region based analyses. Estradiol has pre-
viously shown to be decreased in blood due to tea consumption.
We also found genes involved in cancer, previously shown to be
associated with tea consumption.
Materials and Methods
Study populations
This study included participants from four European cohorts,
including 3,096 subjects, further described below.
Northern Sweden Population Health Study (NSPHS)
The Northern Sweden Population Health Study (NSPHS) was ini-
tiated in 2006 to provide a health survey of the population in the
parishes of Karesuando and Soppero, County of Norrbotten, and
to study the medical consequences of lifestyle and genetics.
This parish has about 3,000 inhabitants who meet the eligibility
criteria in terms of age (> 14 years) of which 1,069 individuals
participated in the study. The median age of these individuals
was 50 years, ranging from 14 to 94 (Table 1). For each partici-
pant in the NSPHS, whole blood, plasma and serum samples
were taken and immediately frozen and stored at �70�C.
Genomic DNA for methylation analyses was extracted from pre-
viously frozen peripheral blood leukocytes using a phenol:chlo-
roform protocol. The participants were asked to answer a
questionnaire about diet and lifestyle factors including coffee
and tea consumption. The NSPHS study was approved by the
local ethics committee at the University of Uppsala (Regionala
Etikpro
¨vningsn€
amnden, Uppsala Dnr 2005:325) in compliance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their writ-
ten informed consent to the study including the examination of
environmental and genetic causes of disease. In case the partic-
ipant was not of legal age, a legal guardian gave additional
consent. The procedure used to obtain informed consent and
the respective informed consent form have recently been dis-
cussed in the light of present ethical guidelines (59). More infor-
mation about the NSPHS has been published previously (60).
Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study (HWFS)
The Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study has been described in
detail elsewhere (61). In short: 2,417 singleton births with de-
tailed birth records, born between 1 February 1945 and 31 March
1946 with mothers that were exposed to the Dutch famine of
1944-45 during or immediately preceding pregnancy were se-
lected. Likewise 890 births from 1943 and 1947 were selected to
include individuals whose mothers were not exposed to famine
during this pregnancy. For 70% of the individuals, an address
could be obtained and they were invited by mail to participate

 together with a same-sex sibling not exposed to the famine as
a family-control. In total 1,075 interviews and 971 clinical
examinations were performed between 2003 and 2005. The
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Columbia University Medical
Center and the Medical Ethical Committee (MEC) of Leiden
University Medical Center approved this study and participants
provided verbal consent at the start of the telephone interview
and written informed consent. Coffee and tea consumption was
ascertained from a 140-item food frequency questionnaire that
has been validated for the Dutch population (62).
EnivroGenoMarkers project (EGM)
The EnivroGenoMarkers project (www.envirogenomarkers.net)
involved subjects from the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition study (EPIC-ITALY) and the Northern
Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS) (Table 1) (63–65).
Both studies used population-based recruitment with standard-
ized lifestyle (including smoking) and personal history ques-
tionnaires, anthropometric data and blood samples collected at
recruitment (1993–1998 for EPIC-ITALY; 1990–2006 for NSHDS).
The EnviroGenomarkers project and its associated studies and
protocols were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of
Umea
˚, as regards the Swedish cohort, and the Florence Health
Unit Local Ethical Committee, as regards the Italian cohort, and
all participants gave written informed consent. The studies were
conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines. 659 buffy
coat samples from both cohorts were thawed and DNA was iso-
lated using the QIAamp Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN), evaluating it
spectrophotometrically and by agarose gel electrophoresis.
The prospective investigation of the Vasculature in
Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS)
Eligible subjects were those aged 70 years living in the commu-
nity of Uppsala, Sweden. The subjects were chosen from the
register of community living and were invited in a randomized
order. The subjects received an invitation by letter within
2 months of their 70th birthday. Of the 2,025 subjects invited,
1,016 subjects participated giving a participation rate of 50.1%
(66). Median age of individuals in PIVUS was 70.1 years, ranging
from 69.8 to 70.7 years (Table 1). The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the University of Uppsala (Dnr:00-419) and
the participants gave informed consent. All subjects were inves-
tigated in the morning after an overnight fast, where collection
of blood for DNA preparation took place. No medication or
smoking was allowed after midnight.
Determination of DNA methylation status
Genomic DNA for 743 samples from NSPHS, 659 samples from
EGM, 1,016 samples from PIVUS and 971 from HWFS was
bisulfite-converted using an EZ DNA methylation Kit (ZYMO re-
search) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The
methylation status of the genomic DNA was then assessed us-
ing the Human Methylation450 BeadChip, (Illumina, San Diego,
USA)
according
to
the
standard
protocol.
The
Human
Methylation450 BeadChip, (Illumina, San Diego, USA) has been
validated in previous studies (67,68).
Analysis of the raw data in NSPHS was performed using
minfi. Normalization was performed using Subset-quantile
Within Array Normalisation (SWAN). A marker detection P-val-
ue � 1.38�10�10 (Bonferroni adjusted P-value ¼ 0.05, adjusted for
the number of individuals * the number of CpG sites analyzed)
was applied, a Probe Call rate of > 0.98, and an individual call
rate of > 0.98 was used. DNA methylation data were obtained
for 743 individuals with self-reported coffee and tea consump-
tion available.
Analysis of the raw data in PIVUS was performed using
GenomeStudio 2011.1 from Illumina Inc. After exclusion of rep-
licates a total of 1,002 study participants had methylation data
available for quality control procedures. Three samples were ex-
cluded based on poor bisulphite conversion efficiency, twelve
samples due to low pass rate of CpG sites (<98.5% with a detec-
tion P-value >0.01), six samples based on low SNP genotype
match (>1 SNP mismatches) between genotypes from the meth-
ylation array and Omni/Metabochip genotyping chips and 14
samples due to abnormal leukocyte cell counts (>10�109 cells/
l). The signal intensities for the methylated and unmethylated
state were then quantile-normalized for each probe type sepa-
rately. DNA methylation data were obtained for 967 individuals,
804 with self-reported coffee and tea consumption available.
The preprocessing of methylation data from EGM has been
described previously (65). All 659 samples passed the inbuilt
Methylation450 BeadChip 450K quality control. Probes were
excluded from the analysis when >20% of samples had detec-
tion P-values <0.05, which resulted in 53,053 probes being ex-
cluded.
432,524
probes
were
used
in
analysis
and.
DNA
methylation data were obtained for 659 individuals, 621 with
self-reported coffee and tea consumption available.
Raw 450k data processing of the HWFS described in detail
before (69). In short: array QC was performed with MethylAid (70)
and bisulfite conversion efficiency assessed using both the dedi-
cated probes on the 450K array and Sanger Sequencing of a set
of random samples. Sample swaps and admixtures were pre-
vented by comparing the measurement of 21 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) by 450K array with data acquired by
MASSARRAY and by confirming recorded sex with DNA methyla-
tion patterns of the X-chromosomal CpG sites. Normalization of
the dataset was performed by Functional Normalization after ap-
plying NOOB background correction in the minfi package (71) us-
ing six principal components. All measurements with a detection
P-value>0.01 or zero intensity value in one of the color channels
was set as missing. The measurement success rate per sample
was>99%. DNA methylation data were obtained for 950 individ-
uals, 948 with self-reported coffee and tea consumption available.
Estimation of cell fractions from the methylation data
To ensure that the results were not influenced by variation in
cell fraction between samples, we estimated the fraction of
CD8T-, CD4T-, NK- and B-cells, monocytes and granulocytes in
the study samples. This was done using the R package minfi (38)
that allows for estimating cell fractions in Illumina 450K meth-
ylation data from whole blood. This method is based on the
methylation data published for flow-sorted cells (72) and algo-
rithms derived from the study by Houseman et al. (73).
Coffee and tea measurements
The phenotypes analysed were self-reported coffee and tea con-
sumption converted to cups/month.
Statistical analysis
The level of methylation was reported as average beta values,
array and batch (bisulfite conversion plate and scan batch).

 Association between coffee and tea consumption and the trans-
formed methylation beta values were adjusted for sex and age.
To test if smoking was correlated with coffee and tea consump-
tion, we ran a linear regression adjusting for sex and age. We
found both coffee and tea consumption to be correlated to to-
bacco smoking. Coffee was positively correlated (roh ¼ 0.21,
P ¼ 1.97�10�9) and tea negatively (roh ¼ �0.045, P ¼ 0.030). This
is an interesting result that is in line with previous studies
showing that tea drinkers are overall more health conscious
compared to coffee drinkers (74). Coffee consumption was fur-
ther adjusted for tea consumption and tea was adjusted for cof-
fee
consumption.
Analyses
were
performed
in
men
and
women, both separately and together.
Association between coffee and tea consumption and the
transformed methylation beta values were analyzed in NSPHS,
PIVUS and EGM using linear models. NSPHS is a population-
based study including related individuals and special methods
were therefore used to handle relatedness. All statistical analy-
ses were performed using the stats library of R version 2.15.10
(75). A kinship matrix was used to adjust beta values for pedi-
gree structure when analyzing the association between bever-
age consumption and methylation. Pairwise kinship matrices
were calculated for genotyped SNPs (N ¼ 180,212) using the ibs
function implemented in GenABEL. This function computes a
matrix of average IBS (identical by state) for a group of people.
In addition to covariates included for the other cohorts, we also
included year of collection (e.g. 2006 or 2009).
The HWFS contains same-sex sibling pairs and we therefore
used generalized estimation equations (GEE), as implemented
in the R geepack package, with a Gaussian link function to eval-
uate the association between DNA methylation beta values and
coffee or tea consumption, controlling for sibships. In addition
to covariates above, models were additionally adjusted for fam-
ine exposure status and the first three principal components
calculated on the entire beta-value matrix to adjust for cell het-
erogeneity (given their almost perfect correlation with one or
more cell fractions measures as imputed with the algorithm of
Houseman et al. (73)).
Before performing the meta-analysis, all cross-hybridized
CpG-sites where removed (N ¼ 52,172), leaving 421,695 autoso-
mal sites. 11,232 CpG-sites were located on the X chromosome
and those were only analyzed in men and women separately;
while 416 CpG-sites located on the Y chromosome were meta-
analyzed only in men. Meta analyses were performed using an
inverse variance weighted fixed-effects model implemented in
PLINK (76) for men and women together and on the results from
the analyses stratified by sex. Significant results were further
adjusted for inflation by correcting the standard error and P-
value for each included population using the inflation factor
lambda (genomic control).
Regional-level analysis
To perform a regional (locus)-level analysis, we used the comb-
p software (29). Briefly, it groups correlated CpG sites in a 200-bp
sliding window. The program search for a single CpG-site with a
Bonferroni-adjusted P-value less than 1�10�3, and providing it
finds another CpG-site with an adjusted P-value less than
1�10�3 within 200 bases, a putative region will be defined. For
this analysis, we used the lambda-adjusted meta-analysis.
Significant regions were identified as those with at least two
CpG-sites and a corrected P value < 0.05. Comb-p performs a
Stouffer-Liptak correction on probes by assessing all CpG-sites
within
a defined window
as weighted by their observed
correlation.
