Background: The choice between anterior approach (AA) and posterior approach (PA) in primary total
hip arthroplasty (THA) is controversial. Previous reviews have predominantly relied on data from
retrospective studies.
Methods: This systematic review included prospective studies comparing postoperative outcomes
through 90 days of AA vs PA in primary THA. Outcomes were pain severity, narcotic usage, hip function
using Harris Hip Score, and complications. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for all out-
comes. Efficacy data were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) where values of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8,
and 1.0 were defined as small, medium, large, and very large effect sizes, respectively. Complications
were reported as the absolute risk difference (RD) where a positive value implied higher risk with AA and
a lower value implied lower risk with AA.
Results: A total of 13 prospective comparative studies (7 randomized) with patients treated with AA
(n ¼ 524) or PA (n ¼ 520) were included. The AA was associated with lower pain severity (SMD ¼ �0.37,
P < .001), lower narcotic usage (SMD ¼ �0.36, P ¼ .002), and improved hip function (SMD ¼ 0.31,
P ¼ .002) compared to PA. No differences between surgical approaches were observed for dislocation
(RD ¼ 0.2%, P ¼ .87), fracture (RD ¼ 0.2%, P ¼ .87), hematoma (RD ¼ 0%, P ¼ .99), infection (RD ¼ 0.2%,
P ¼ .85), thromboembolic event (RD ¼ �0.9%, P ¼ .42), or reoperation (RD ¼ 1.3%, P ¼ .26). Conclusions of
this study were unchanged when subjected to sensitivity analyses.
Conclusion: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies comparing postoperative
outcomes through 90 days of AA vs PA in primary THA, patients treated with AA reported less pain,
consumed fewer narcotics, and reported better hip function. No statistical differences in complication
rates were detected between AA and PA. Ultimately, the choice of surgical approach in primary THA
should consider preference and experience of the surgeon as well as preference and anatomy of the
patient.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a highly cost-effective surgery
with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $10,000 per
quality-adjusted life year vs no surgery [1]. Although most THA
patients
realize
clinically
meaningful
improvements
in
pain
severity and joint function [2], there remains opportunity to
further improve outcomes by hastening recovery, shortening the
length of hospital stay, and decreasing the risk of dislocation,
fracture, and infection. A posterior approach (PA) is the most

 commonly used THA technique worldwide [3]. The anterior
approach (AA) has generated increased interest recently. Pro-
ponents of the AA report advantages of shorter hospital stay, less
perioperative pain, faster functional recovery, and lower disloca-
tion risk [4e6]. Others have reported a protracted learning curve
and higher early revision rates with AA [7,8]. Candidates for THA
report that their choice of surgical approach is based, in part, on
their desire for a technique that allows quicker functional recovery
[9].
Therefore,
rigorous
comparative
evaluation
of
surgical
approach methods in primary THA is warranted.
With the shift toward value-based care in the US healthcare
system, hospitals are highly incentivized to reduce complication
rates, both in-hospital and perioperatively [10]. Hospitals partici-
pating in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR)
model receive a bundled payment for in-hospital claims as well as
all episodes of care through 90 days postdischarge. Of the total
90-day cost of care associated with Medicare Severity-Diagnosis
Related Group 469 and 470 (major joint replacement or reattach-
ment, with or without major complication or comorbidity), post-
discharge episodes of care comprise nearly 50% of these costs [11].
To the extent that choice of surgical approach may influence peri-
operative recovery, complication risk, and associated healthcare
costs, evaluation of THA outcomes through 90 days postdischarge is
a useful metric.
Several systematic reviews [12,13] have reported comparative
outcomes with AA vs PA for primary THA, yet none have focused on
perioperative outcomes. In addition, more than half of the studies
in each review were retrospective in nature. The purpose of this
systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare postoperative
outcomes through 90 days of AA vs PA THA among prospective
comparative studies. To the extent possible, the design of this meta-
analysis attempted to address each component of the CJR model,
which includes complication rate, patient satisfaction, and pain
management.
Methods
Literature Search
This review followed the guidelines set forth in the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
[14]. This systematic review was not registered, and a public protocol
does not exist. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for prospective
comparative studies of AA vs PA that reported efficacy and compli-
cations of primary THA. Therapeutic search terms consisting of “THA”
and “total hip arthroplasty” were combined with the following sur-
gical approach-specific search terms: anterior, direct, posterior,
posterolateral, and Smith-Petersen. Additionally, manual searches
were conducted using the Directory of Open Access Journals, Google
Scholar, and the reference lists of included papers and relevant meta-
analyses. No language or date restrictions were applied to the
searches. The final search was conducted on June 30, 2017.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
Two researchers independently identified studies for eligibility.
Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Main inclusion criteria
included prospective study of primary THAwith comparison of AAvs
PA, predominant diagnosis of osteoarthritis, and at least one
extractable perioperative outcome. Titles and abstracts were initially
screened to exclude review articles, commentaries, letters, case
reports, and obvious irrelevant studies. Full texts of the remaining
articles were retrieved and reviewed. Studies were excluded if the
design was retrospective, if all patients received bilateral THA, or if
prespecified outcomes were not reported or not calculable. When
multiple studies included overlapping series of patients, only the
study with the largest sample size was included. Data were inde-
pendently extracted from eligible peer-reviewed articles by 2 re-
searchers and data discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

 Outcomes
This review included postoperative outcomes reported through
90 days following primary THA. Main efficacy outcomes of this
study included pain severity, need for opioid analgesia, and hip
function using the Harris Hip Score (HHS). Postoperative pain
severity was preferentially extracted from a visual analogue pain
scale or, secondarily, from the HHS or Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale [15].
Narcotic use was preferentially extracted as morphine equivalents
consumed during follow-up or, secondarily, alternative opioid
consumption metrics. HHS was reported as the score at final
follow-up in the perioperative period or the change in HHS during
this period. When efficacy data were reported at multiple intervals
within 90 days of follow-up, the final value was extracted for
analysis. Complications included dislocation, fracture, hematoma,
infection,
thromboembolic
event,
and
reoperation
reported
through 90 days of follow-up. Complication frequencies included
in-hospital and events through 90 days of follow-up because
complications in each period were rarely reported. The Cochrane
Collaboration tool was used for assessing risk of bias in each study
[16]. The risk of bias tool assesses sequence generation, allocation
concealment,
blinding,
incomplete
outcome
data,
selective
outcome reporting, and other sources of bias.
Data Synthesis
A random effects meta-analysis model was applied for all out-
comes given the a priori assumption of heterogeneous treatment
effects among studies. Denominators were adjusted to include the
number of patients or hips, as appropriate. For continuous data
reported on the same scale, the mean difference between groups

 was the reported statistic. The standardized mean difference (SMD)
was used for continuous data reported on different scales. For
reference, SMD values of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 are defined as small,
medium, large, and very large effect sizes, respectively [17]. For
binary outcomes, the absolute risk difference between groups was
the reported statistic given the inclusion of zero total event trials
[18]. For each outcome, the effect size and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated in each study and visually displayed using
forest plots. Heterogeneity of outcomes among studies was esti-
mated with the I2 statistic where values of �25%, 50%, and �75%
represent low, moderate, and high inconsistency, respectively [19].
Publication bias was visually assessed with funnel plots (not
shown) and quantitatively assessed using Egger’s regression test.
Sensitivity analyses included a one-study removed analysis where
the
meta-analysis
for
each
outcome
was
recalculated
after
removing one study at a time to explore the impact of single studies
on treatment effects, and an analysis that included randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) only. P-values were 2-sided with a signifi-
cance level <.05. All analyses were performed using Comprehen-
sive Meta-analysis (version 3.3; BioStat, Englewood, NJ).
Results
Study Selection
After screening 340 records for eligibility, 13 prospective compar-
ative studies (14 manuscripts) [5,6,20e31] with 1044 patients treated
with AA (n ¼ 524) or PA (n ¼ 520) were included in the meta-analysis.
The most common reasons for exclusion were retrospective study
design (27), no relevantoutcomesreported(23), andno comparison of
AA vs PA (20). A flow diagram of study identification and selection is
shown in Figure 1.
Patient and Study Characteristics
Among 13 included studies, 7 were RCTs and 6 were prospective
nonrandomized studies. Comparing patients treated with AA vs PA,
pooled
baseline
patient
characteristics
were
well-matched,
including age (62 vs 63 year), female gender (60% vs 58%), and
body mass index (27 kg/m2 in each group) (Table 1). Learning cases
were not explicitly included in any study although this information
was not reported in 2 studies. Risk of bias assessment for each study
is described in Table 2. The primary risks of bias were attributable
to inclusion of nonrandomized studies.
Short-Term Efficacy Outcomes
In follow-up through 90 days post-treatment, AA was associated
with lower pain severity, lower narcotic usage, and improved hip
function compared to PA. In 9 studies reporting these data, pain
severity was lower with AA (SMD ¼ �0.37, 95% CI �0.52 to �0.21,
P < .001) with minimal heterogeneity among studies (I2 ¼ 11%,
P ¼ .34) (Fig. 2). Pain severity was reported on a 0-10 visual
analogue scale in 3 studies, on the HHS pain subscore in 1 study,
and on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoar-
thritis Index pain subscore in 1 study. In 5 studies reporting these
data, narcotic usage was also lower with AA (SMD ¼ �0.36, 95%
CI �0.60 to �0.13, P ¼ .002) with low heterogeneity among studies

 (I2 ¼ 36%, P ¼.19) (Fig. 3). Narcotic usage was reported as morphine
equivalents in 3 studies, number of narcotic pills consumed in 1
study, and days using narcotics in 1 study. In 8 studies reporting
these data, HHSs were higher in follow-up with AA (SMD ¼ 0.31,
95% CI 0.11-0.51, P ¼ .002) with low to moderate heterogeneity
among studies (I2 ¼ 44%, P ¼ .08) (Fig. 4). The HHS values used in
the analysis included the total scores at final follow-up through 90
days in 7 studies and the change in HHS total score in 1 study.
Significant publication bias was not observed for any short-term
efficacy outcome.
Short-Term Complications
Over 90 days of follow-up, no differences between surgical ap-
proaches were observed for dislocation, fracture, hematoma, infec-
tion, thromboembolic event, or reoperation (Table 3). In studies
reporting these data, the pooled frequency of individual events
ranged from 1% to 4% in each group. For each complication, hetero-
geneity was low and publication bias was not evident, apart from
significant publication bias identified for reoperation rates (Egger’s
P-value<.01). When adjusting for publication bias using a trim and
fill technique, the risk difference for reoperation decreased from 1.3%
to 0.8% and remained not statistically different.
Sensitivity Analyses
We performed 2 types of sensitivity analyses to assess the
robustness of the meta-analysis conclusions, including a one-
study removed analysis and an analysis of RCTs only (Table 4).
Overall, the main results of this meta-analysis were unchanged
when assessing only RCTs or when removing one study at a time.
In all analyses, the AA remained associated with lower pain
severity, lower narcotic use, and higher HHSs relative to PA, with
no differences between approaches for any complication. When
isolated to RCTs only, the SMD for AA improved from �0.37
to �0.44 for pain severity, �0.36 to �0.37 for narcotic usage, and
0.31 to 0.41 for HHS.
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 prospective
studies with more than 1000 patients comparing postoperative
outcomes through 90 days with AA vs PA in primary THA, patients
treated with AA reported less pain, consumed fewer narcotics,
and reported better hip function. No statistical differences in
complication rates were detected between AA and PA. These
conclusions were unchanged among various sensitivity analysis
assumptions.
The reason for less pain, lower narcotic usage, and greater hip
function with the AA remains speculative. One possible rationale
for these results is the avoidance of muscle splitting and reduced
soft tissue damage with the AA. In contrast, the PA involves
detachment of the tensor fascia lata, which may impair dynamic
stabilization and require activity restrictions until soft tissues have
adequately healed. In support of this hypothesis, 2 RCTs have re-
ported lower C-reactive protein levels with AA vs PA [31,32].
Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging [33] and cadaver [34]
studies have revealed less soft tissue damage to gluteal and
external rotator muscles with AA vs PA. On balance, each of these
effects favoring the AA is small-to-medium in magnitude. Thus,
whether these early differences are large enough to be detectable
by patients remains unknown.

 We found no statistically significant differences in complication
rates between surgical approaches. Prior studies reporting compli-
cation rates between the 2 approaches are conflicting [4,21,35,36].
Complications were uncommon and this meta-analysis may have
been underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences be-
tween surgical approaches. Furthermore, the sample size within any
AA or PA group ranged from 19 to 60 patients among studies.
Therefore, it is plausible that rare events were undetected in some
studies due to the small study size. Nonetheless, differences in
complication rates between surgical approaches were small and
were further reduced for most individual complications when
evaluating RCTs only. Importantly, because no study in this meta-
analysis included learning cases, it is plausible that complication
risks could be higher with inexperienced surgeons using either
approach. Additionally, given the mean body mass indexof 27 kg/m2
in each group, it is also possible that complication rates in each
group were underestimated [37e39].
The CJR model requires mandatory participation among 791
hospitals in 6 geographical areas. Participating hospitals are
accountable for all Medicare fee-for-service Part A and B costs during
the hospital stay as well as for 90 days following hospital discharge.
As part of the CJR, 3 hospital-level quality of care measures are used
to derive a composite quality score. The risk-standardized compli-
cation rate comprises 50% of the score, a patient satisfaction survey
comprises 40% of the score, and a patient-reported outcome mea-
sure focused on pain management comprises 10% of the score.
Hospitals with higher composite quality scores are eligible to receive
reconciliation payments and lower effective discount percentages
on reconciliation payments and repayments [40]. To the extent
possible based on data typically reported in the THA literature, the
design of this meta-analysis attempted to address each component
of the composite quality score. Comparable complication rates and
lower pain severity findings from this review may relate to the
complication and pain elements of the composite quality score.
While patient satisfaction was not reported in any study, it is plau-
sible that lower narcotic usage and better hip function might
translate to higher patient satisfaction scores. Therefore, while the
results of this meta-analysis do not directly translate to quality
composite scores specified in the CJR model, these data may be
viewed as hypothesis-generating for future studies that evaluate
hospital reimbursements with AA vs PA.
We report the first known meta-analysis of prospective compar-
ative studies evaluating AA or PA for primary THA. The systematic
reviews of Higgins et al [12] and Meermans et al [13] compared AAvs
PA, albeit over longer follow-up periods. Still, common data derived
from these reviews can be compared. In Higgins et al study, AA was
associated with less pain and better hip function in early follow-up,
lower dislocation risk over longer term follow-up, and no difference
in intraoperative fracture risk. Meermans et al reported improved
early hip function with AA, but no difference between surgical ap-
proaches in longer term follow-up; complication risk was not eval-
uated in this review. Synthesis of these results in light of outcomes
from this study suggest modest reductions in pain severity and better
hip function with AAvs PA during early follow-up, with no detectable
difference in short-term complication risk. Although Higgins et al
reported lower dislocation risk with AA, we found no difference in
dislocation risk between surgical approaches. A plausible explanation
is that our review included data through 90 days of follow-up,
whereas the Higgins meta-analysis reported dislocation risk over
longer term follow-up. Despite these early modest advantages of the
AA, the comparative safety and effectiveness of these surgical ap-
proaches over long term follow-up is unclear.
Strengths of this meta-analysis are inclusion of only prospective
comparative studies, comprehensive evaluation of efficacy and
complications, low heterogeneity in outcomes among studies, and
results that were robust to sensitivity analyses. This study also had
several limitations. First, generalizability of these findings to less
experiencedcentersisunknownbecause the studies did notexplicitly
exclude learning curve cases. Second, given the focus on the 90-day
postoperative period, long-term comparative outcomes between AA
and PA cannot be inferred from these results. Third, despite greater
efficacy and comparative complication risk with AA during the 90-
day postoperative period, no conclusions regarding cost utility with
either approach can be derived from this research. Finally, compli-
cation reporting was inconsistent among studies, with several studies
excluding this information altogether. Therefore, complication out-
comes reported here should be interpreted cautiously.
Conclusion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective
studies comparing postoperative outcomes through 90 days of AA
vs PA in primary THA, patients treated with AA reported less pain,
consumed fewer narcotics, and reported better hip function. No
statistical differences in complication rates were detected between
AA and PA. Ultimately, the choice of surgical approach in primary
THA should consider preference and experience of the surgeon as
well as preference and anatomy of the patient.
