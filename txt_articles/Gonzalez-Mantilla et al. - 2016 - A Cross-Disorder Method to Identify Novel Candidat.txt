A Cross-Disorder Method to Identify Novel Candidate Genes
for Developmental Brain Disorders
Andrea J. Gonzalez-Mantilla, MD; Andres Moreno-De-Luca, MD; David H. Ledbetter, PhD; Christa Lese Martin, PhD
IMPORTANCE Developmental brain disorders are a group of clinically and genetically
heterogeneous disorders characterized by high heritability. Specific highly penetrant genetic
causes can often be shared by a subset of individuals with different phenotypic features, and
recent advances in genome sequencing have allowed the rapid and cost-effective
identification of many of these pathogenic variants.
OBJECTIVES To identify novel candidate genes for developmental brain disorders and provide
additional evidence of previously implicated genes.
DATA SOURCES ThePubMeddatabasewassearchedforstudiespublishedfromMarch28,2003,
throughMay7,2015,withlargecohortsofindividualswithdevelopmentalbraindisorders.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS A tiered, multilevel data-integration approach was used,
which intersects (1) whole-genome data from structural and sequence pathogenic
loss-of-function (pLOF) variants, (2) phenotype data from 6 apparently distinct disorders
(intellectual disability, autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and epilepsy), and (3) additional data from large-scale studies, smaller cohorts, and
case reports focusing on specific candidate genes. All candidate genes were ranked into
4 tiers based on the strength of evidence as follows: tier 1, genes with 3 or more de novo
pathogenic loss-of-function variants; tier 2, genes with 2 de novo pathogenic loss-of-function
variants; tier 3, genes with 1 de novo pathogenic loss-of-function variant; and tier 4, genes
with only inherited (or unknown inheritance) pathogenic loss-of-function variants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Development of a comprehensive knowledge base of
candidate genes related to developmental brain disorders. Genes were prioritized based on
the inheritance pattern and total number of pathogenic loss-of-function variants identified
amongst unrelated individuals with any one of six developmental brain disorders.
STUDY SELECTION A combination of phenotype-based and genotype-based literature review
yielded 384 studies that used whole-genome or exome sequencing, chromosomal microarray
analysis, and/or targeted sequencing to evaluate 1960 individuals with developmental brain
disorders.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This approach increased the yield of gene discovery over
what would be obtained if each disorder, type of genomic variant, and study design were
analyzed independently. These results provide further support for shared genomic causes
among apparently different disorders and demonstrate the clinical and genetic heterogeneity
of developmental brain disorders.

D
evelopmental brain disorders (DBDs) are a group of
heterogeneous conditions characterized by deficits
that affect multiple functional domains, such as cog-
nition, behavior, communication, and motor skills.1 Develop-
mental brain disorders include intellectual disability or devel-
opmental delay (ID/DD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophre-
nia, bipolar disorder (BD), and epilepsy. The clinical presen-
tation of these disorders is highly variable, ranging from mild
tosevereimpairmentsacrossthemajorareasofdevelopment.2
Clinical and epidemiologic studies1-3 reveal that DBDs fre-
quently co-occur with other developmental and/or neuropsy-
chiatricdisordersandsharecommonandoverlappingsignsand
symptoms.3
Developmental brain disorders are considered distinct
clinical entities by the DSM-54 and the International Classifi-
cationofDiseases,10thRevision.5However,previousstudies1,6-8
provide strong evidence of common underlying molecular
pathways and shared genetic causes, such as copy number and
single-nucleotide variants, among apparently different DBDs.
For example, structural and sequence variants in NRXN1
(HGNC 8008) are associated with Pitt-Hopkinsâ€“like syndrome,
ID/DD, ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, BD, and epilepsy.9 Vari-
ants in ADNP (HGNC 15766), CHD8 (HGNC 20153), SCN2A
(HGNC 10588), and PTCHD1 (HGNC 26392) have similarly been
reported in individuals with a range of DBDs.10-13 Likewise, re-
current copy number variants (CNVs), including deletions at
1q21.1, 16p11.2, 17q12, and 22q11.2, have been identified in in-
dividuals with ID/DD, ASD, schizophrenia, and epilepsy.14-17
Because of the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of
DBDs, the identification of causative genetic variants has been
challenging. However, recent advances in copy number and
next-generation sequencing technologies, such as whole-
exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing
(WGS), have revolutionized the diagnostic approach to DBDs,
revealing causative genetic mutations in approximately 25%
to 50% of individuals with a DBD.18-21 These technologies have
also been successfully used in the research setting for gene dis-
covery in large cohorts of individuals with ASD, ID/DD, epi-
lepsy, and schizophrenia, generating vast amounts of pub-
licly available genomic data.22-24
Otherlarge-scalestudies25-27ofindividualswithDBDshave
found that identifying independent de novo pathogenic loss-
of-function (pLOF) variants (ie, nonsense, frameshift, or splice
site) in the same gene among unrelated individuals is a pow-
erful statistical approach to reliably identifying disease caus-
ative genes. Sanders et al25 studied 928 individuals with ASD
and applied a permutation test to determine that 2 or more de
novo pLOF variants were highly unlikely to occur by chance
andprovidesignificantevidenceforASDassociation(P = .008;
false discovery rate [q] = 0.005). Willsey et al26 similarly as-
sessed1043probandswithASDandfoundthatobserving2and
3 de novo pLOF variants in the same gene in unrelated indi-
viduals identifies an ASD gene with a 97.8% and greater than
99.9% chance of being a true ASD gene, respectively (q = 0.02
and0.0002,respectively),whereasgeneswithasingledenovo
pLOF variant are more likely than not to be true ASD genes
(54.7% chance, q = 0.45). Likewise, Dong et al27 studied 787
families with ASD (2963 individuals) and concluded that genes
with a single de novo pLOF variant have a 50.4% (q = 0.496)
probability of being associated with ASD, whereas genes with
at least 2 de novo pLOF variants have a 97.6% probability of
being associated with ASD (q = 0.024).
This robust statistical approach has been used to identify
disease risk genes in large cohorts of individuals with DBDs,
such as ASD, yielding a steadily increasing number of genes
associated with ASD. However, rare pLOF variants identified
in a single individual are usually not discussed in the results
of these publications and often remain as isolated findings rel-
egated to the supplemental data. Genomic data from smaller
cohortsandcasereportsaresimilarlynotroutinelypooledwith
data from larger studies, thus precluding the identification of
potential individuals who may represent the second or third
de novo pLOF variant, moving the gene over the threshold for
being considered disease causative. Moreover, previous
studies25-27 using this approach have been restricted to co-
horts of individuals ascertained based on a single categorical
diagnosis; therefore, genomic data from individuals with ap-
parently distinct DBDs are not being jointly analyzed in search
of independent pLOF variants in the same gene among unre-
lated individuals.
In this study, we expanded the aforementioned method
and developed a multilevel data-integration approach,
which capitalizes on 3 genotype-phenotype data sources:
(1) genomic data from structural and sequence pLOF variants
(de novo and inherited), (2) phenotype data from 6 appar-
ently distinct DBDs (cross-disorder), and (3) data from large-
scale studies, smaller cohorts, and case reports (cross-study).
We used this method to identify and categorize DBD candi-
date genes and shared genetic causes and molecular path-
ways that transcend clinical diagnostic boundaries.
Methods
Development of a Comprehensive Cross-Disorder

We conducted a tiered approach to develop a comprehensive
database of DBD candidate genes. Our first step comprised an

included in the results section and supplemental data of each
article. Institutional review board approval and informed con-
sentwerenotrequiredbecauseallthedataincludedwerepooled
from publicly available studies.
We included all cases with pLOF variants, which we de-
fined as LOF sequence variants and single-gene deletions that
include one or more exons. We excluded individuals with in-
tronic, missense, or silent sequence variants, individuals with
duplicationsordeletionsinvolvingmorethanonecodinggene,
and individuals with more than one pLOF variant. For each in-
dividual, we documented the presence or absence of each of
the 6 DBDs, the type of genomic variant and inheritance pat-
tern, and the type of genomic diagnostic platform used in the
study. The phenotype information was used only as part of the
inclusion criteria.
Wesubsequentlyselectedthosegeneswith2ormorepLOF
variants identified in 2 or more unrelated individuals and con-
ducted a second comprehensive genotype-based literature re-
viewfocusedoneachofthesegenestoidentifyadditionalpLOF
variants and/or clinical manifestations from smaller cohort
studies and case reports (eFigure and eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). To avoid double counting individuals and variants, we
carefully annotated the cohort name, individual identifica-
tion number, phenotype, and all available variant informa-
tion and removed duplicate entries. Two investigators
(A.J.G-.M. and A.M.-D-.L.) independently reviewed all the data
points included in the knowledge base. Although our study de-
sign resembles a meta-analysis in the comprehensive litera-
ture review, it does not follow the formal statistical approach
used in meta-analyses. To provide an easily accessible re-
source for researchers, physicians, and other health care pro-
fessionals, we created a comprehensive online database with
all our genotype and phenotype findings, which can be
accessed at http://geisingeradmi.org/dbdgenes.
DBD Candidate Gene Prioritization
To classify and prioritize our findings, we ranked all DBD can-
didate genes into 4 tiers based on the strength of evidence as
follows: tier 1, genes with 3 or more de novo pLOF variants;
tier 2, genes with 2 de novo pLOF variants; tier 3, genes with 1
de novo pLOF variant; and tier 4, genes with only inherited (or
unknown inheritance) pLOF variants. Genes from tiers 1 and
2 are considered high-confidence DBD causative genes,
whereas those from tiers 3 and 4 are categorized as emerging
DBD causative genes. In addition to the de novo events, genes
from all tiers could have any number of inherited (or
unknown inheritance) variants.
Results
Identification and Prioritization of DBD Candidate Genes
Our initial phenotype-based literature review yielded 1911 in-
dividuals with pLOF variants involving 1034 genes from 118
studies. Filtering our results to genes with 2 or more pLOF vari-
ants identified in at least 2 unrelated individuals resulted in
241 genes from 1110 individuals. The genotype-based litera-
ture review identified 850 additional individuals with pLOF
variantsin85ofthe241initiallyidentifiedgenes,from266new
studies, for a total of 1960 individuals with pLOF variants in
241 genes (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The pLOF sequence variants were identified in 1516 indi-
viduals (77.3%) and were detected using targeted sequencing
(820[54.1%]),WES(660[43.5%]),andWGS(36[2.4%]).Single-
gene exonic deletions were observed in 444 individuals
(22.7%), with most variants from studies using genome-wide
chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) (413 [93.0%]) and the
remaining 31 (7.0%) being identified with targeted CNV analy-
sis. Overall, 1109 variants (56.6%) were identified using an un-
biased,genome-widediagnosticplatform(WGS,WES,orCMA),
whereas 851 (43.4%) came from studies using targeted ge-
nomic analyses. Information regarding the inheritance pat-
tern was not available for 671 individuals (34.2%). Of the 1289
with available inheritance data, 810 (62.8%) were de novo and
479 (37.2%) were inherited (Table 1).
We ranked all DBD candidate genes into 4 tiers based on
thestrengthofevidence(Table2).Tier1includes59geneswith
3 or more de novo pLOF variants. Tier 2 comprises 44 genes
with 2 de novo pLOF variants. Tier 3 includes 68 genes with 1
de novo pLOF variant, and tier 4 contains 70 genes with only
inherited or unknown inheritance pLOF variants. Genes with
the strongest level of evidence from tier 1 can be further sub-
divided based on the number and inheritance pattern of all
pLOF variants observed (Figure 1). Six genes have more than
25denovopLOFvariantseach(ARID1B[HGNC18040],STXBP1
[HGNC 11444], CDKL5 [HGNC 11411], SCN1A [HGNC 10585],
SYNGAP1 [HGNC 11497], and CHD7 [HGNC 20626]), 21 genes
have 10 to 22 de novo pLOF variants, and 32 genes harbor 3 to
9 de novo pLOF variants.
Increased Yield of Risk Allele Identification
and Discovery of Novel DBD Candidate Genes
Compared with the use of our multilevel data-integration ap-
proach, had we used a classic categorical diagnostic ap-
proach for gene discovery and only considered genes with 2
or more pLOF variants identified in unrelated individuals with
the same DBD, the total number of unique disease-associated
genes would be 208. By implementing a cross-disorder ap-
proach to DBDs and integrating genotype and phenotype data
from individuals with 6 apparently distinct disorders, we pro-
vided the required evidence to include 33 additional genes in
the knowledge base (12 high-confidence genes from tiers 1 and

2 and 21 emerging candidate genes from tiers 3 and 4), which
would have been missed with a categorical diagnostic ap-
proach (Table 2). Furthermore, by transcending clinical diag-
nostic boundaries, we increased the evidence level for 18 ad-
ditional genes, which were ranked one tier higher because of
our cross-disorder approach (Table 2).
Moreover, our multilevel data-integration approach iden-
tified 7 novel high-confidence DBD candidate genes (tier 2)
and provided evidence of 10 novel putative candidate genes
(tiers 3 and 4), which were not previously considered to act as
mendelian genes with high penetrance and large effect size in
any brain disorder (Table 3). Evidence of 2 of the novel candi-
date genes (ELAVL2 [HGNC 3313] and OR52M1 [HGNC 15225])
came from individuals with different disorders with different
types of genomic variants (structural and sequence) reported
by different studies, whereas 10 additional genes (HIVEP3
[HGNC 13561], MOV10 [HGNC 7200], NEDD9 [HGNC 7733],
RALGAPB [HGNC 29221], YTHDC1 [HGNC 30626], CCDC91
[HGNC 24855], EDA2R [HGNC 17756], MSRA [HGNC 7377],
ARHGEF38 [HGNC 25968], and EYS [HGNC 21555]) were iden-
tified by the cross-disorder and cross-study approach and 5
(ZWILCH [HGNC 25468], LPP [HGNC 6679], OR2T10 [HGNC
19573], CYLC2 [HGNC 2583], and LRBA [HGNC 1742]) exclu-
sively by the cross-study approach (unrelated individuals
with variants in each gene had the same DBD). All the pLOF
variants identified for these genes came from the supplemen-
tal data of different studies, which did not discuss such find-
ings in the main report. For example, 2 unrelated individuals
from different cohort studies have de novo pLOF variants in
NEDD9: one with ID/DD and ASD from the Simons Simplex
Collection reported by Iossifov et al28 and another with epi-
lepsy reported by the EuroEPINOMICS-RES Consortium
et al.29 Mutations in this gene were previously reported in
individuals with different types of cancer, including mela-
noma, glioblastoma, and gastric cancer, but not in association
with any developmental or neuropsychiatric disorder.30
Variable Expressivity of DBD Genes
Ofthe241DBDcandidategenes,75(31.1%)wereassociatedwith
a single disorder (ASD, 63; ID/DD, 6; schizophrenia, 5; and
ADHD, 1), 79 (32.8%) with 2 disorders, 49 (20.3%) with 3 dis-
orders, 25 (10.4%) with 4 disorders, and 11 (4.6%) with 5 dis-
orders. Two genes, NRXN1 and PARK2 (HGNC 8607), were as-
sociated with all 6 DBDs. Although there is significant
phenotypic heterogeneity and diagnostic overlap of appar-
ently different disorders associated with most of the DBD can-
didategenes,theprevalenceofreporteddisordersvariesamong
genes, and a specific DBD association profile can be observed
for each gene. Furthermore, certain genes appear to be en-
riched for specific disorders more than others. For example,
as shown in Figure 2, the frequency of epilepsy is greater than
thatofID/DDinindividualswithpLOFvariantsinSCN1A,which
in turn is greater than the frequency of ASD. Conversely, in-
dividuals with pLOF variants in CHD8 have a higher fre-
quency of ASD than ID/DD and epilepsy, whereas probands
with variants in ARID1B are more likely to be diagnosed as hav-
ing ID/DD than ASD or epilepsy. However, the extent and de-
tail of the phenotype data included in our study are restricted
to the clinical information reported by multiple articles, which
is frequently scarce and incomplete. For example, large co-
hort studies often only report the categorical diagnosis used
as inclusion criteria for the study (eg, epilepsy) but omit im-
portant neurodevelopmental comorbidities (eg, ID/DD, ASD).
In addition, many individuals recruited to study cohorts based
on certain categorical diagnoses, such as ID/DD and ASD, are
young and have not passed through the age of risk to develop

tegrating apparently different categorical diagnoses and mul-
tiple study designs, we likely decrease the burden of some
phenotyping biases.
Discussion
In this study, we developed and implemented a genomic-
driven, tiered approach to DBD candidate gene identifica-
tion, which capitalizes on the vast and rapidly increasing
amount of publicly available genotype and phenotype data
on multiple individuals with a broad range of brain disor-
ders. We identified 241 candidate genes for DBD and priori-
tized them based on the strength of evidence. Our multi-
level data-integration approach increased the yield of DBD
candidate gene discovery over what would be obtained if
each disorder, type of genomic variant, and study design
were analyzed independently.
The power of our approach comes from genotype and phe-
notypedataintegrationatmultiplelevels.Thisisthefirststudy,
to our knowledge, to integrate (1) genomic data from struc-
tural and sequence pLOF variants identified using different di-
agnosticplatforms(WGS,WES,CMA,andtargetedgenomicap-
proaches), (2) phenotype data from any 1 of 6 apparently
distinctbraindisorders(ID/DD,ASD,ADHD,schizophrenia,BD,
and epilepsy), and (3) data from different types of study de-
signs (large-scale cohorts, case series, and case reports). More-
over, we included de novo and inherited pLOF variants to cap-
ture a broader spectrum of genomic variation. We focused our
analyses on pLOF variants to provide the highest level of con-
fidence on the deleteriousness of the observed variants. Al-
though recent studies22,31 have begun to include de novo mis-
sense variants predicted to be damaging by a combination of
in silico tools (developed to model the effects of amino acid
substitutions on protein structure and function), we ex-
cluded missense events, which account for most events iden-
tified by large-scale sequencing studies, to avoid ambiguity in
the interpretation of their functional consequences. This ap-
proach results in higher specificity and reduced sensitivity.
Previous studies25-27 have found that identifying indepen-
dent de novo pLOF variants in the same gene among unre-
lated individuals is a powerful statistical approach to reliably
identifying disease-causative genes. In our study, we identi-
fied 59 genes with at least 3 and 44 genes with 2 independent
de novo pLOF variants, thus providing strong evidence to con-
sider this group of 103 genes as high-confidence DBD caus-
ative genes. In addition, previous studies26,27 have also found
that genes with a single de novo pLOF variant are more likely
than not to be true risk alleles with a 50.4% to 54.7% chance
of truly being disease associated. We identified 68 genes with
1 de novo variant plus at least another pLOF event that was in-
herited or of unknown inheritance and 70 genes with 2 or more
pLOF inherited (or of unknown inheritance) variants. Al-
though the strength of evidence (based on de novo variant
counts) is not as robust as that of genes within tiers 1 and 2,
we consider these genes as emerging DBD causative genes. We
hypothesize that as we continue our ongoing approach to DBD
gene discovery, a subgroup of genes included in tiers 3 and 4
will soon move up to tiers 1 and 2 because of the rapidly in-
creasing number of studies reporting a wealth of genomic and
phenotypic data from individuals with a variety of brain dis-

orders. If pLOF variants were to be identified in DBD candi-
date genes among unaffected individuals (properly screened
for neuropsychiatric disorders), the pathogenicity tier of such
genes would be reduced.
Thistypeofstudyhascertainlimitations.First,theamount
and quality of the phenotype data used for our multilevel data
integration approach rely on the clinical information pro-
vided by each individual study, which is often limited. Sec-
ond, we excluded missense variants, deletions involving more
than1codinggene,andindividualswithmorethan1pLOFvari-
ant, which decreases the sensitivity of our method. However,
the use of such strict inclusion and exclusion criteria limits the
number of potential confounding factors and provides the
strongestandleastambiguousevidenceforthecandidategenes
identified. Third, we based part of our approach on a method
that was developed based on de novo variants exclusively, and
our study also includes inherited pLOF variants. To circum-
vent this fact, we created a tiered system for gene prioritiza-
tion, which ranks genes based on the number of de novo vari-
ants.Withthisapproach,geneswithintiers1and2,whichhave
at least 2 independent de novo pLOF variants, are considered
high confidence, and genes within tiers 3 and 4 (1 de novo and
only inherited variants, respectively) are considered emerg-
ing candidate genes. Fourth, because our approach relies on
published data, it is subject to publication bias.
A previous study31 took a similar cross-disorder ap-
proach to identify DBD candidate genes. Li et al31 pooled WES
andWGSdatafrom3555trioswithany1of4disorders(ID,ASD,
epilepsy,orschizophrenia)from36studiesandusedtheTrans-
missionandDeNovoAssociationprogram31toidentifyahigher
prevalence of de novo variants (mainly missense variants) in
probands relative to their unaffected control siblings. On the
basis of annotation of de novo exonic variants, they priori-
tized 764 potential candidate genes, of which 53 were associ-

ated with more than 1 disorder and 1, SCN2A, with all 4 DBDs.
The main differences with our study include our exclusion of
missense variants to avoid ambiguous pathogenicity interpre-
tations and our inclusion of (1) 2 additional brain disorders
(ADHD and BD), (2) structural pLOF variation in addition to se-
quencevariants,(3)inherited(andunknowninheritance)pLOF
variants, and (4) a larger number and different types of stud-
ies (351 publications in addition to the 36 studies reviewed
by Li et al31).
Our results are consistent with the concept of develop-
mental brain dysfunction, which our group recently pro-
posed to encompass a continuum of developmental disabili-
ties and neuropsychiatric disorders.1 This model emphasizes
atypicalbraindevelopmentasacommondenominatorthatcan
manifest as cognitive, behavioral, and/or motor impairments
and arise from a genetic anomaly or an insult to the develop-
ing brain. Furthermore, the specific profile of impairments
(type and severity) resulting from the underlying brain dys-
function can be used to determine an individualâ€™
s categorical
clinical diagnosis and guide treatment.
Conclusions
The continued efforts of the scientific community to estab-
lishandexpandlargedata-sharinginternationalconsortiadedi-
cated to study the underpinnings of brain disorders will fur-
ther increase our knowledge of genomic causes shared by
apparently distinct disorders. The creation of a comprehen-
sive database, updated in real time, of all potentially caus-
ative variants associated with all medical disorders will allow
for continuous gene discovery. By sharing genotype and phe-
notype data on individuals with DBDs with fellow research-
ers, physicians, and other health care providers, common un-
derlyingmolecularpathwaysthatmaybeamenabletopotential
therapeutic interventions are likely to emerge.
