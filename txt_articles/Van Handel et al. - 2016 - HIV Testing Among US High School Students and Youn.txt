abstract
BACKGROUND: We assessed HIV testing trends among high school students and young adults.
METHODS: We analyzed National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to assess HIV testing prevalence among high 
school students and young adults aged 18 to 24, respectively. Logistic regression models 
for each sample stratified by gender and race/ethnicity were estimated to assess trends in 
the percentages ever tested, with year as a continuous linear variable. We report absolute 
differences in HIV testing prevalence and model results for 2005–2013 (YRBS) and 2011–
2013 (BRFSS).
RESULTS: During the study periods, an average of 22% of high school students (17% of male 
and 27% of female students) who ever had sexual intercourse and 33% of young adults 
reported ever being tested for HIV. Among high school students, no change was detected in 
HIV testing prevalence during 2005–2013, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity. Among 
young adult males, an average of 27% had ever been tested, and no significant changes were 
detected overall or by race/ethnicity during 2011–2013. Significant decreases in testing 
prevalence were detected during 2011–2013 among young adult females overall (from 
42.4% to 39.5%), young adult white females (from 37.2% to 33.9%), and young adult black 
females (from 68.9% to 59.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV testing prevalence was low among high school students and young adults. 
No increase in testing among young adult males and decreased testing among young adult 
black females is concerning given their higher risk of HIV infection.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: HIV 
disproportionately affects adolescents and young 
adults compared with the overall population. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
recommends routine HIV screening for Americans 
aged 13 to 64, yet 50% of adolescents and young 
adults with HIV remain undiagnosed.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study found HIV 
testing prevalence was low among high school 
students (25%) and young adults (33%). No increase 
in testing among males and decreased testing 
among young adult black females is concerning 
given their higher risk of HIV infection.

In 2010, persons aged 13 to 24 years 
made up 17% of the US population 
but accounted for 26% of estimated 
new HIV infections.1 The majority 
of HIV infections occur among gay, 
bisexual, and other men who have 
sex with men (MSM) and among 
black females.1 Among adolescents 
and young adults living with HIV 
infection, 44% were undiagnosed, 
the highest percentage of any age 
group.2 Without HIV testing and 
diagnosis, adolescents and young 
adults cannot take advantage of HIV 
care and treatment that can improve 
their health and reduce the risk of 
transmission to others.3,4 In 2006, 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) released the 
“Revised Recommendations for HIV 
Testing of Adults, Adolescents, and 
Pregnant Women in Health Care 
Settings” (referred to hereafter 
as Revised Recommendations) 
encouraging clinicians to screen 
all persons aged 13 to 64 years for 
HIV infection.5 Since then, multiple 
organizations, including the US 
Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) in 2013, also recommended 
that all adolescents and adults be 
screened for HIV infection.6 The 
CDC has implemented several 
testing initiatives, including the 
Expanded Testing Initiative (since 
2007) and social media campaigns 
(eg, Act Against AIDS since 2009), 
to increase the number of persons 
(both adolescents and adults) tested 
and diagnosed with HIV, particularly 
persons disproportionately affected 
by HIV (ie, blacks or African 
Americans [referred to as black 
females or black males], Hispanics or 
Latinos, and MSM).7,8 In addition, HIV 
prevention projects for young MSM of 
color and young transgender persons 
of color (since 2011) specifically 
focus on intensifying prevention 
efforts among these populations.9
The CDC reported no evidence of 
increases in HIV testing among high 
school students during 2005–2011 
or among young adults aged 18–24 
years during 2000–2010.10 In this 
article, we update previous trend 
analyses because it is important to 
understand whether current testing 
programs have led to an increase 
in HIV testing. Increased testing 
would lead to a decrease in the high 
percentage unaware of their HIV 
infection. This study investigated 
trends in HIV testing among high 
school students during 2005–2013 
and trends in HIV testing among 
young adults during 2011–2013 to 
determine if trends have changed 
from the stable testing patterns 
previously reported and to expand 
on the previous report by assessing 
trends for specific subgroups (eg, 
high school students who have ever 
had sexual intercourse).10
METHODS
Data Sources
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
System includes a national school-
based Youth Risk Behavior Survey 
(YRBS) conducted biennially among 
students in grades 9 through 12. 
The survey methodology has been 
previously described.11 Briefly, the 
sampling frame for the 2005–2013 
national YRBSs consisted of all 
regular public (might include charter 
schools and public alternative, special 
education, or vocational schools) 
and private (might include religious 
and other private schools, but not 
private alternative, special education, 
or vocational schools) schools with 
students in at least 1 of grades 9 
through 12 in the 50 states and 
the District of Columbia. A 3-stage 
cluster sample design was used. 
Survey procedures were designed to 
protect students’ privacy by allowing 
for anonymous and voluntary 
participation. The CDC’s Institutional 
Review Board approved the protocol 
for the national YRBSs. The school, 
student, and overall response rates 
during 2005–2013 averaged 80%, 
87%, and 69%, respectively, and 
the average sample size was 14 675 
students. A weight based on student 
gender, race/ethnicity, and grade was 
applied to each record to adjust for 
school and student nonresponse and 
oversampling of black and Hispanic/
Latino students. Weighted estimates 
are representative of all students in 
grades 9 through 12 attending public 
and private schools in the United 
States. The YRBS questionnaire is 
self-administered during regular 
class time and includes a question 
on HIV testing: “Have you ever been 
tested for HIV, the virus that causes 
AIDS (Do not count tests done if you 
donated blood).”
BRFSS is a state-based, annual 
cross-sectional random-digit-
dialed telephone (landline and cell) 
survey that collects information 
on preventive health practices 
and health care access. State-level 
data were combined to produce 
annual national estimates for the 
civilian, noninstitutionalized adult 
US population. BRFSS interviewers 
asked respondents 2 questions: 
“Have you ever been tested for HIV? 
Do not count tests you may have had 
as part of a blood donation. Include 
testing fluid from your mouth” and 
“Where did you have your last HIV 
test – [specific settings listed]?” The 
average median weighted survey 
response rate was 47% (average 
state range: 30%–62%) during 
2011–2013.12 We analyzed 2011–
2013 BRFSS data for respondents 
residing in the 50 states and District 
of Columbia to match the area 
covered by the national YRBSs and 
included those who were aged 18 
to 24 years and reported a “yes” or 
“no” response to having ever been 
tested. We limited our analysis to 
2011–2013 data because of recent 
methodological changes that could 
affect assessment of HIV testing 
trends.13 The final sample included 
90% of respondents who were aged 
18 to 24 years, which was an average 
of 21 790 respondents annually. 
Data are weighted to account for the 
complex survey design, nonresponse,

and sociodemographic factors to 
yield estimates representative of 
civilian, noninstitutionalized young 
adults aged 18 to 24 years in the 
United States.
Data Analysis
We report the prevalence of HIV 
testing among high school students 
(YRBS) and young adults aged 
18 to 24 years (BRFSS). Analyses 
were conducted using YRBS data 
overall and by gender and race/
ethnicity among 3 subgroups: 
students who reported ever having 
sexual intercourse, having sexual 
intercourse with ≥4 persons, and 
having sexual intercourse with ≥1 
persons during the past 3 months. 
Analyses were conducted using 
BRFSS data overall, by gender and 
race/ethnicity. Statistical analyses 
were conducted on weighted 
data using SUDAAN (for YRBS) 
and SAS version 9.3 (for BRFSS) 
and accounted for the complex 
sampling designs for each survey. 
For each subgroup, separate logistic 
regression models were used to 
assess linear time trends in the 
percentages of students and young 
adults who reported having ever 
been tested for HIV, with year as a 
continuous linear variable, adjusting 
for gender, race/ethnicity, and grade 
(YRBS only) when applicable. We 
report the absolute difference and 
the linear β and associated P value 
from 2005 to 2013 for YRBS and 
from 2011 to 2013 for BRFSS data.
RESULTS
HIV Testing Among High School 
Students, YRBS
During 2005–2013, an average of 
22% of high school students who 
ever had sexual intercourse, 34% of 
students who had sexual intercourse 
with ≥4 persons, and 24% of 
students who had sexual intercourse 
with ≥1 person during the past 3 
months had ever been tested for HIV. 
The prevalence of HIV testing did not 
change overall, by gender, or by race/
ethnicity within gender, among any 
of the 3 subgroups (Fig 1A, B, and C; 
Table 1). An average of 17% of male 
and 27% of female students who ever 
had sexual intercourse had ever been 
tested for HIV. The lowest average 
prevalence rate was among white 
male students (15%), and the highest 
average prevalence rate was among 
black female students (36%).
HIV Testing Among Young Adults, 
BRFSS
During 2011–2013, an average 
of 33% of young adults had ever 
been tested for HIV. Trends varied 
significantly by gender and race/

3 months were assessed overall and by gender using the YRBS data from 2005 to 2013. The prevalence of HIV testing did not change overall or by gender 
among these 3 subgroups (P > .05). D, Trends in HIV testing among young adults aged 18 to 24 years were assessed overall and by gender using the BRFSS 
data from 2011 to 2013. The prevalence of HIV testing decreased signifi
 cantly overall from 34.5% in 2011% to 32.7% in 2013 (P = .016), did not change 
signifi
 cantly among young men (average 27%, P > .05), and decreased signifi
 cantly among young women from 42.4% in 2011% to 39.5% in 2013 (P = .016).

ethnicity. Among young adult males, 
an average of 27% had ever been 
tested for HIV. No significant changes 
were detected in the prevalence of 
HIV testing among males overall 
or by race/ethnicity subgroup (Fig 
1D; Table 2). Among young adult 
females, a significant decrease in 
the prevalence of HIV testing was 
detected overall from 42.4% in 2011 
to 39.5% in 2013 (Fig 1D, 3.0% 
decrease, β = –0.06, P = .02), among 
young adult white females from 
37.2% in 2011 to 33.9% in 2013 
(3.3% decrease, β = –0.07, P = .02), 
and among young adult black females 
from 68.9% in 2011 to 59.9% in 
2013 (9.0% decrease, β = –0.20, P 
= .002). Young adults who had ever 
been tested for HIV reported that 
their last HIV test was at a private 
doctor office/health maintenance 
organization (40.5%), clinic (31.2%), 
hospital (8.8%), HIV testing site 
(4.8%), correctional facility (1.2%), 
or other setting (13.6%) (Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
Less than one-quarter of high school 
students who have had sexual 
intercourse and one-third of young 
adults have ever been tested for HIV. 
During 2005–2013, the percentage 
of sexually experienced high school 
students who had ever been tested 
for HIV did not change overall or for 
any subgroup. During 2011–2013, 
the percentage of young adults 
who have ever been tested did not 
increase among young adult males 
and decreased significantly among 
young adult females overall and 
among young adult white and black 
females. No increase in testing among 
young adult males and decreased 
testing among young adult black 
females is concerning because they 
account for the majority of new 
HIV infections among persons aged 
13–24 years. These results indicate 
that recommendations to screen all 
adolescents and young adults for HIV 
infection, regardless of risk, have 
not been widely implemented. HIV 
testing programs do not appear to 
be successfully reaching high school 
students and young adults.
Adolescents and young adults living 
with HIV infection are more likely 
to be unaware of their HIV infection

undiagnosed HIV infection,2 yet our 
results indicate that HIV testing 
rates are low and not increasing 
among this population, regardless 
of sexual behavior, race/ethnicity, 
and gender. CDC and the USPSTF 
recommend that all adolescents 
and adults be screened for HIV 
infection.5,6 The USPSTF considered 
prevalence of sexual activity and STIs

and prevalence of STIs is high among 
high school–age adolescents,15 
routine HIV screening starting at age 
15 years was chosen.6 We limited 
our analysis to sexually experienced 
high school students to focus our 
analysis on persons who may have 
been exposed to HIV through sexual 
intercourse. Although our analysis 
is the first to assess trends in HIV 
testing among sexually experienced 
high school students, previous 
analyses of YRBS data found similarly 
low HIV testing rates. For example, 
in 2007, 13% of all high school 
students had ever been tested for 
HIV. The prevalence of HIV testing 
was higher among students who had 
ever had sexual intercourse (22%) 
than those who had never had sexual 
intercourse (4%).16 More recently, 
Coeytaux et al (2014) used YRBS 
data pooled from 2005 to 2011 and 
found that HIV testing was positively 
associated with HIV-related 
risk behaviors among sexually 
experienced high school students.17
Similarly, CDC previously reported no 
change in the percentages of young 
adults ever tested for HIV (34%) 
using 2000–2010 National Health 
Interview Survey data.10 In contrast, 
data from 1999–2010 NHANES 
indicated a decreasing trend, from 
38% in 1999–2000 to 30% in 2009–
2010 among young adults aged 18 
to 24 years.10 Although the previous 
report including National Health 
Interview Survey and NHANES data 
did not further investigate trends 
by subgroup and therefore could 
not identify the groups driving the 
overall trends among young adults, 
its results and our results indicate 
testing is not increasing among 
young adults.
Additional efforts are needed to 
achieve widespread uptake of HIV 
testing among high school students 
and young adults. HIV testing 
programs should consider how to 
best reach young persons in racial/
ethnic minority groups, especially 
blacks and Hispanics/Latinos and 
all MSM, because these groups are 
disproportionately affected by 
HIV infection. Black adolescents 
and young adults account for an 
estimated 57% of all new HIV 
infections among this age group 
in the United States, followed by 
Hispanic/Latino adolescents and 
young adults (20%).9 Evidence 
indicates increasing racial/ethnic 
disparities in new HIV infections 
among adolescents and young 
adults.18 Although HIV testing was 
higher among young adult black 
males compared with young adult 
white males, the prevalence of HIV 
testing among young adult males did 
not change among any race/ethnicity 
subgroup to reflect increasing 
disparities.
We found a decrease in the 
prevalence of HIV testing among 
young adult black females during 
2011–2013, which is disconcerting 
given the high rate of infection among 
black adult females. In 2013, the 
diagnosis rate among black females 
(34.8 per 100 000) was higher than 
the rate for females of any other 
race/ethnicity subgroup.19 Black 
females remain an important target 
population for HIV testing programs. 
For example, an Act Against AIDS 
campaign, “Take Charge. Take 
the Test,” is a national campaign 
implemented in 2012 to encourage 
HIV testing among black/African 
American females aged 18 to 34 
years.8
Adolescents and young adults may 
face unique barriers that need to be 
addressed to increase access to and 
utilization of HIV testing services, 
such as lack of access to health 
care, low provider awareness of 
recommendations, and insufficient 
sexual health knowledge.17,20–23 
Inadequate access to HIV prevention 
and treatment services is a major 
barrier for adolescents, particularly 
those of racial/ethnic minority 
subgroups, because many have only 
limited contact with the health care 
system and are less likely to receive 
regular preventive health care.17,20 
Even among those with access to 
preventive health care, studies 
have found limited knowledge 
of HIV testing recommendations 
for adolescents and young adults 
among pediatricians and health 
care providers.21 In an analysis 
of adolescents at a large urban 
pediatric emergency department, 
78% of providers were unaware 
of the revised recommendations.21 
Provider recommendation has been 
shown to be the most important 
predictor of obtaining an HIV test 
among adolescents.24,25 Our results 
support the importance of provider 
recommendation because 80% of 
young adults who were ever tested 
for HIV last tested in a clinical setting.
Provider education and 
implementation of system-level 
interventions, such as those 
used to implement routine HIV 
screening in prenatal and urgent 
care settings,26–28 could be applied 
to testing for adolescents and 
young adults. These interventions 
should also consider the complex 
issues of confidentiality, disclosure, 
and consent in adolescent care 
because adolescents also cite 
concerns about confidentiality.29,30 
As currently structured, routine 
clinic visits for adolescents often 
do not include blood tests. The 
Committee on Pediatric AIDS

provides recommendations on how 
health care providers for adolescents 
can successfully provide HIV 
screening and prevention services 
to their clients.23 The American 
Academy of Pediatrics, Committee 
on Pediatric AIDS, can build on 
these recommendations to better 
understand when, where, and by 
whom adolescents should be tested.
Schools can also play a critical role 
in increasing access to HIV testing 
services for students.31 Federal Title 
X clinics must provide confidential 
sexual health services; however, 
other clinical settings might not 
offer such protections depending 
on the state. Teens may need access 
to confidential services, meaning 
services are provided without 
parental involvement in either the 
delivery or payment of the service. 
Consequently, parent’s insurance may 
not be a viable payment option if an 
“Explanation of Benefits” statement 
reveals the receipt of services to 
parents. In addition, young people 
might not have the ability to get to 
services that are only open during 
school hours. Schools can either 
provide services at onsite or nearby 
clinics or create referral systems to 
clinics that have been assessed for 
their teen-friendly (ie, confidential) 
nature and accessibility. In addition to 
overcoming barriers related to access 
to care, knowledge about HIV among 
adolescents and young adults is 
limited, and often they underestimate 
their personal infection risk.22,23 
Sexual health education could 
improve the ability of adolescents and 
young adults to assess their risk for 
HIV infection and increase testing.16
At least 5 limitations to this 
analysis should be noted. First, 
the cross-sectional design of 
YRBS prevents identification of 
temporal order between HIV testing 
and risk behaviors. Second, the 
self-reported nature of YRBS and 
BRFSS can introduce bias (eg, 
recall, nonresponse, social 
desirability). The extent of 
underreporting or overreporting of 
behaviors cannot be determined, 
although the survey questions in 
YRBS demonstrate good test–retest 
reliability.32 Third, YRBS data apply 
only to youth who attend school and 
therefore are not representative 
of all persons in this age group. 
Nationwide, in 2009, of persons 
aged 16 to 17 years, ∼4% were not 
enrolled in a high school program 
and had not completed high 
school.33 Fourth, the gender 
of sexual partners is not included 
in these surveys. Therefore, we 
could not identify MSM who 
account for the greatest number of 
adolescents and young adults living 
with HIV infection. However, all 
adolescents and young adults should 
be screened for HIV, regardless 
of risk, specifically in areas with 
prevalence of undiagnosed HIV 
≥0.1%. Annual HIV testing, not 
addressed in this analysis, should 
focus on those at higher risk and 
in need of repeat HIV testing. 
Fourth, we could not determine if 
respondents were tested for other 
STIs, which would provide useful 
context information about potential 
risk for HIV and other sexual health 
care interactions. Lastly, sexually 
experienced respondents in BRFSS 
could not be identified; therefore, 
some persons included in the 
analysis may not have been exposed 
to HIV through sexual intercourse, 
the most common transmission risk 
behavior. However, on the basis 
of data from National Survey of 
Family Growth, 86% of women and 
83% of men aged 18 to 24 years 
have had sexual intercourse by 
age 22, indicating the effect of this 
nonsexually experienced population 
on our results is likely minimal.34,35
CONCLUSIONS
Increasing the percentage of 
adolescents and young adults 
screened for HIV is important 
for increasing awareness of HIV 
infection and reducing new HIV 
infections among this population. 
However, less than one-quarter of 
high school students who have had 
sexual intercourse and one-third of 
young adults have ever been tested 
for HIV, and there was no evidence 
of increased testing. No increase in 
testing among male students and 
young adult males and decreased 
testing among young adult black 
females is of special concern given 
the higher risk of HIV infection 
among men and black women. 
Multipronged testing strategies, 
including provider education, 
system-level interventions in clinical 
settings, adolescent-friendly testing 
services, and sexual health education 
will likely be needed to increase 
testing and reduce the percentage of 
adolescents and young adults living 
with HIV infection.
