Background. Following universal recommendation for use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in US adults 
aged ≥65 years in September 2014, we conducted the first real-world evaluation of PCV13 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospi-
talized vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in this population.
Methods. Using a test-negative design, we identified cases and controls from a population-based surveillance study of adults 
in Louisville, Kentucky, who were hospitalized with CAP. We analyzed a subset of CAP patients enrolled 1 April 2015 through 30 
April 2016 who were aged ≥65 years and consented to have their pneumococcal vaccination history confirmed by health insurance 
records. Cases were defined as hospitalized CAP patients with PCV13 serotypes identified via culture or serotype-specific urinary 
antigen detection assay. Remaining CAP patients served as test-negative controls.
Results. Of 2034 CAP hospitalizations, we identified PCV13 serotypes in 68 (3.3%) participants (ie, cases), of whom 6 of 68 
(8.8%) had a positive blood culture. Cases were less likely to be immunocompromised (29.4% vs 46.4%, P = .02) and overweight 
or obese (41.2% vs 58.6%, P = .01) compared to controls, but were otherwise similar. Cases were less likely to have received PCV13 
than controls (3/68 [4.4%] vs 285/1966 [14.5%]; unadjusted VE, 72.8% [95% confidence interval, 12.8%−91.5%]). No confounding 
was observed during adjustment for patient characteristics, including immunocompromised status, body mass index, and history of 
influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (adjusted VE range, 71.1%−73.3%).
Conclusions. Our study is the first to demonstrate real-world effectiveness of PCV13 against vaccine-type CAP in adults aged 
≥65 years following introduction into a national immunization program.

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) represents only a fraction 
of the adult pneumococcal disease burden [1, 2]. By comparison, 
nonbacteremic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) makes 
up the vast majority of pneumococcal disease in adults [2]. In 
2014, the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization 
Trial in Adults (CAPiTA), a double-blind, placebo-controlled 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted in the Netherlands, 
demonstrated efficacy of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV13) against both overall and nonbacteremic vac-
cine-type CAP (VT-CAP) in adults aged ≥65 years [3]. As a 
result of this trial [4] and evidence that, despite herd protection 
 
induced by the PCV13 infant vaccination program [5, 6], 
roughly 10% of all adult CAP was still caused by PCV13 sero-
types [7], in September 2014 the US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) revised their 17-year-old pneumococcal vac-
cination recommendation for older adults to include PCV13 
use for all adults aged ≥65 years [7, 8]. This update augmented 
long-standing use of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine (PPSV23) [8] with PCV13 in this population [7, 8].
Since that time, >30% of US adults aged ≥65 years have received 
PCV13 [9]. As with any vaccine, it is important to assess not only 
the clinical efficacy and safety, but also the real-world effectiveness 
of vaccination following routine introduction into a broader pop-
ulation. Namely, for PCV13, it is not currently known whether the 
efficacy observed in the RCT setting of the Netherlands [3] would 
be reflective of the real-life experience of an adult population as 
clinically and demographically diverse as the United States. We 
addressed this important question by evaluating PCV13 effective-
ness against hospitalized VT-CAP in adults aged ≥65 years follow-
ing the age-based ACIP recommendation for use of PCV13 in this 
population [7] using an observational study design.

PCV13 Vaccine Effectiveness in US Adults
METHODS
Design and Setting
We estimated PCV13 VE against hospitalized VT-CAP using 
a test-negative design (TND). The TND is considered a robust 
type of observational study for evaluating VE against infectious 
respiratory diseases [10–13]. This TND was conducted as a 
nested case-control substudy within a large, population-based 
CAP surveillance study. The surveillance study prospectively 
enrolled adults living in Louisville, Kentucky, who were hos-
pitalized with CAP in 1 of 9 adult acute-care hospitals from 
 
7 October 2013 through 30 September 2016 [14].
Participants
We obtained institutional review board approval (IRB) from the 
University of Louisville Human Subjects Research Protection 
Program Office (IRB number 13.0408) and from the research 
offices at each participating study hospital. All participants 
provided written, informed consent prior to the conduct of any 
study-related procedures. Clinical and radiological criteria were 
used to define CAP [14] based on prior, similar studies [15, 16]. 
CAP was defined based on (i) clinical evidence of ≥2 of the fol-
lowing: fever, hypothermia, chills or rigors, pleuritic chest pain, 
cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, malaise, or 
abnormal auscultatory findings suggestive of pneumonia; and 
(ii) radiographic evidence, which included a chest radiograph 
and/or a computed tomographic image with an infiltrate con-
sistent with pneumonia as determined by the treating health-
care provider or radiologist at the time of presentation. Patients 
with hospital-acquired pneumonia or who did not provide a 
urine sample or did not have a final diagnosis of pneumonia 
at discharge were excluded. Patients could contribute >1 CAP 
hospitalization event to the study if a subsequent CAP hospital-
ization for the same patient occurred >30 days after the previ-
ous hospitalization.
Clinical and demographic characteristics were obtained for all 
patients. Clinical characteristics were based on medical record 
review. Risk for pneumococcal disease was defined by the pres-
ence or absence of underlying immunocompromising and chronic 
medical conditions with each patient categorized as high-risk 
(immunocompromised), at-risk (immunocompetent, but chronic 
disease present), or healthy [8, 17, 18]. Categories were based on 
CDC designations, which are applied to current ACIP recommen-
dations for pneumococcal vaccination [8, 17, 18].
Analysis Population
We limited our analysis to persons aged ≥65 years because cur-
rent vaccination guidelines recommended universal PCV13 
vaccination for this age group [7]. In addition, only patients 
enrolled between 1 April 2015 and 30 April 2016 were included 
because (i) it occurred after universal recommendation for adult 
PCV13 use (September 2014) [7], and (ii) detailed pneumococ-
cal vaccination history was obtained from health insurers during 
this time period. Participants had to consent to have their pneu-
mococcal vaccination history confirmed by health insurance 
records. Patients were excluded if, after consent, their health 
insurer could not be reached. Finally, we excluded patients who 
received pneumococcal vaccination ≤30 days prior to urine 
sample collection because a previous study suggested that recent 
pneumococcal vaccination could impact detection of pneumo-
coccal serotypes in urine samples [19].
Defining Cases and Test-Negative Controls
We performed blood culture, BinaxNOW (Alere, Walthman, 
Massachusetts), and a PCV13 serotype-specific urinary antigen 
detection (UAD) assay (Pfizer Inc) on all enrolled patients as a 
study-related procedure. The UAD assay is ≥95% sensitive and spe-
cific for detecting PCV13-type pneumococcal serotypes in patients 
with bacteremic or nonbacteremic radiographically confirmed 
CAP when validated against a gold standard of bacteremic pneu-
monia [20–22]. We collected sputum/respiratory and pleural fluid 
cultures (when appropriate) as a part of standard medical care.
We defined cases as patients hospitalized for CAP in whom 
PCV13 serotypes were identified by any method, including 
from UAD or routine culture from blood, respiratory tract, or 
pleural fluid. All other patients who met study inclusion criteria 
but for whom PCV13 serotypes were not identified from any 
source served as test-negative controls. This approach mimics 
the definition of test-negative controls commonly used in TND 
studies of influenza VE [13].
In sensitivity analyses, we estimated PCV13 VE using 2 dif-
ferent control groups. In the first sensitivity analysis, controls 
were defined as non-PCV13-type pneumococcal CAP (Broome 
method) [23]. That is, controls were patients in whom pneu-
mococcus was detected by routine culture or BinaxNOW, but 
PCV13 serotypes were not identified from culture or UAD. This 
method has been most commonly used to estimate VE against 
IPD [23]; however, this approach was limited for identifying 
controls in our study given that UAD only detects PCV13 sero-
types. In the second sensitivity analysis, we defined controls as 
CAP patients in whom pneumococcus was not detected by any 
method (culture, UAD, or BinaxNOW), similar to a recently 
published TND study [24].
Vaccine Exposure
Pneumococcal vaccination status was based on whether receipt 
of ≥1 dose of PCV13 or PPSV23 could be confirmed by health 
insurance records. We contacted all health insurers that provided 
coverage for each patient included in the analysis and requested 
a record of any pneumococcal vaccine(s) received in the last 
5 years, including which pneumococcal vaccine(s) were received 
and the date of administration. Patients were considered vac-
cinated if they received pneumococcal vaccination >30 days 
before hospitalization for CAP. We obtained previous influenza 
vaccination status (within the last year) via patient self-report.

Statistical Analysis
Odds of having received PCV13 for cases and controls were con-
structed and compared using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs). We calculated VE as 1 minus the OR 
multiplied by 100%. We also estimated PCV13 VE against non-
bacteremic (only) VT-CAP by restricting the primary analysis to 
patients in whom blood culture results were negative. In addition 
to constructing crude OR and VE estimates, we performed logis-
tic regression modeling to assess PCV13 VE after adjustment for 
potentially confounding factors. Any variable(s) that changed the 
estimated OR for PCV13 by ≥10% (ie, confounder) [25] remained 
in the final model. We used a 2-sided α of .05 for all analyses.
RESULTS
Of 4188 adult hospitalizations for CAP
, 2348 occurred among 
patients aged ≥65 years. Of these, 314 (13.4%) participants for 
whom pneumococcal vaccination status could not be obtained 
from health insurance records (n = 208) or pneumococcal vacci-
nation occurred ≤30 days before urine sample collection (n = 106) 
were excluded, leaving a final analysis population of 2034 CAP 
hospitalizations (Figure 1). Only 111 of 2034 (5.5%) were repeat 
CAP hospitalizations from a previously enrolled study patient.
Median participant age was 76 years (range, 65−102 years); 
35.4% were aged ≥80 years. Most participants were white 
(88.5%), non-Hispanic (>99%), and had ≥1 at-risk or high-
risk condition (87.9%). The most prevalent comorbid condi-
tions were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (52.6%), 
coronary artery disease (35.4%), congestive heart failure 
(31.9%), and diabetes mellitus (32.2%). Almost half (45.8%) 
were high risk/immunocompromised, with chronic renal dis-
ease (22.8%) and malignancy (19.1%) being the most common 
high-risk/immunocompromising conditions. Smoking preva-
lence was 19.0%. Median body mass index (BMI [kg/m2]) was 
26.2; 30.2% of participants were obese. Median Pneumonia 
Severity Index (PSI) [26] was 106, with 27.0% of participants 
having PSI = 5. Median hospital stay for CAP was 6 days 
(range, 1−49 days); 132 (6.5%) patients died during the initial 
hospitalization for CAP and 258 (12.7%) patients died within 
30 days of hospitalization.
Self-reported receipt of influenza vaccination within the 
previous year was 68.0%. Based on health insurance records, 
in the last 5 years, 21.2% received PPSV23, 14.2% received 
PCV13, and 3.0% received PCV13 and PPSV23. Median time 
since last dose of PPSV23 and PCV13 was 553 and 157 days,

aRisk level was based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifications of risk for pneumococcal disease using information about chronic medical conditions collected from 
the medical record. “High-risk” patients were defined as having certain immunocompromising conditions including immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, generalized 
malignancy (excluding skin cancer), hematologic malignancy, diseases requiring treatment with immunosuppressive drugs including long-term corticosteroids or radiation therapy, nephrotic 
syndrome, chronic renal failure (including end-stage renal disease), or organ transplantation. “
At-risk” patients were defined as the absence of immunocompromising conditions but the 
presence of ≥1 chronic medical condition including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, or current alcoholism or smok-
ing. “Healthy patients” were defined as participants without any immunocompromising or chronic medical conditions listed above [8, 17
, 18].
bBMI was measured as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). Two participants were missing information about BMI.
cOne participant was missing information about PSI.
dOne person was missing information about whether or not they had weekly exposure to a child aged <5 years.
eFour participants were missing information about current drug abuse.

UAD and BinaxNOW results were available for all partici-
pants. Culture results (predominately from blood) were avail-
able for 93.7% (1905/2034) of participants. Of 2034 CAP 
hospitalizations, we identified PCV13 serotypes in 68 (3.3%) 
who served as cases. The remainder (1966/2034 [96.7%]) served 
as test-negative controls. Nearly all of the cases (66/68 [97.1%]) 
were identified by UAD, 8 of 66 (12.1%) of whom also had pos-
itive cultures (5 blood, 2 sputum, 1 bronchoalveolar lavage). 
Serotyping results were not available for 2 of the 5 blood cul-
tures. Two additional cases, for whom UAD was negative, were 
identified by culture alone (1 blood, 1 sputum). Thus, most 
cases 62 of 68 (91.2%) were nonbacteremic.
Cases were less likely to be high risk/immunocompromised 
(29.4% vs 46.4%, P = .02) and overweight or obese (BMI ≥25.0) 
(41.2% vs 58.6%, P = .01) compared to controls, but were oth-
erwise similar (Table 2). Cases were less likely to have received 
PCV13 than controls (3/68 [4.4%] vs 285/1966 [14.5%]; unad-
justed VE, 72.8% [95% CI, 12.8%−91.5%]; Tables 2 and 3). 
Effectiveness against nonbacteremic VT-CAP was similar, 
with an unadjusted VE of 70.1% (95% CI, 4.1%−90.7%). No 
confounding was observed during univariate and multivari-
able adjustment for clinical and demographic characteristics, 
including immunocompromised status, BMI, and history of 
influenza and PPSV vaccination for VT-CAP (adjusted VE 
range, 71.1%−73.3%) or for nonbacteremic VT-CAP (adjusted 
VE range, 67.5%−70.7%; Table 3). Thus, our crude model 
served as the final model for both outcomes. We also compared 
patients who received PCV13 (n = 288) to patients who did 
not (n = 1746) to compare the proportion of hospitalized CAP 
caused by PCV13 serotypes by vaccination status. CAP patients 
who received PCV13 were less likely to have PCV13 serotypes 
detected (3/288 [1.0%] vs 65/1746 [3.7%], P = .02).
The 3 VT-CAP cases among PCV13-vaccinated persons were 
serotypes 3 (n = 2) and 19A (n = 1). All 3 of these cases occurred 
among at-risk female patients; 2 occurred among patients who 
were aged ≥80 years. Among the 65 patients who did not receive 
PCV13, serotype 3 was most commonly detected (n = 25 
[38.5%]), followed by serotypes 19A (n = 12 [18.5%]) and 
6A (n = 9 [13.8%]). Among the 6 cases that were positive for 
PCV13 serotypes in UAD and culture, serotyping results dis-
agreed for 2. For 1 patient, UAD identified serotype 19A while 
blood culture identified serotype 3. For the other patient, UAD 
identified serotype 3 whereas sputum culture identified a non-
PCV13 serotype. Removing these 2 patients from the analysis 
or defaulting to culture results in these 2 instances, however, 
had no appreciable effect on our results.
In the first sensitivity analysis where controls were defined as 
non-PCV13-type pneumococcal CAP, 164 (8.1%) participants 
aged ≥65 years had pneumococcus detected by any method 
(culture, UAD, or BinaxNOW). A lower proportion of cases 
received PCV13 than controls (3/68 [4.4%] vs 11/96 [11.5%], 
P = .16); however, this difference was no longer statistically 
significant after the majority of nonpneumococcal controls from 
the primary analysis were excluded. This corresponded to an 
unadjusted VE of 64.3% (95% CI, –33.1% to 90.4%). Evidence 
of confounding in univariate and multivariable models was lim-
ited (adjusted VE range, 60.3%−69.2%) (Table 4). Results from 
the second sensitivity analysis, where controls were defined as 
nonpneumococcal CAP, were nearly identical to the primary 
analysis with VE estimates ranging from 71.5% to 73.8% in uni-
variate and multivariable models (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Following universal recommendation for PCV13 use in older 
adults in the United States, PCV13 VE against hospitalized 
VT-CAP among a clinically and demographically diverse pop-
ulation of adults aged ≥65 years was 73%. VE against nonbac-
teremic (only) VT-CAP was similar (70%), given that the large 
majority (91%) of cases were nonbacteremic. These VE estimates 
were robust against adjustment for potentially confounding par-
ticipant demographic and clinical characteristics and history 
of influenza vaccine and PPSV23 use. Furthermore, it is both 
reassuring and noteworthy that PCV13 VE against VT-CAP was 
confirmed in a US population with a high prevalence of immu-
nocompromising conditions (46%) and other chronic medical 
conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(53%), congestive heart failure (32%), and diabetes mellitus 
(32%), and where PPSV23 was used (21% in the last 5 years).
PCV13 VE against VT-CAP seen in our observational study 
(73%) was higher than what was previously observed in the 
CAPiTA RCT (46%) and was comparable to the 75% efficacy 
seen against IPD in the same study [3]. Our study differs from 
the RCT in several ways. First, high-risk/immunocompromised 
patients were included in our study and made up nearly half of 
the study population, but were excluded in the RCT. Second, 
our study was conducted in Louisville, Kentucky, where 21% 
of patients aged ≥65 years received PPSV23 in the past 5 years. 
In contrast, in the Netherlands, where the RCT was conducted, 
PPSV23 was not recommended for use in adults. However, 
both high-risk/immunocompromised adults and those who 
have previously received PPSV23 elicit lower immunologic 
responses to PCV13 compared to adults without high-risk/
immunocompromising conditions and adults naive to PPSV23 
[27, 28]. Thus, based on these 2 differences alone, a higher VE 
was unexpected in our study. Our study, however, was obser-
vational and, unlike an RCT, is potentially subject to unmea-
sured confounding. Whether unmeasured confounding alone 
explains a higher observed point estimate in our study, however, 
is unclear. Moreover, CIs around our VE estimates were wide 
and overlapped the range of VT-CAP VE estimates observed 
in the RCT [3].
Sensitivity analyses that restricted test-negative controls to 
non-PCV13-type pneumococcal CAP [23] and to nonpneumo-
coccal CAP [24] yielded point estimates that were consistent with

aRisk level was based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifications of risk for pneumococcal disease using information about chronic medical conditions collected from 
the medical record. “High-risk” patients were defined as having certain immunocompromising conditions including immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, generalized 
malignancy (excluding skin cancer), hematologic malignancy, diseases requiring treatment with immunosuppressive drugs including long-term corticosteroids or radiation therapy, nephrotic 
syndrome, chronic renal failure (including end-stage renal disease), or organ transplantation. “
At-risk” patients were defined as the absence of immunocompromising conditions but the 
presence of ≥1 chronic medical condition including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, or current alcoholism or smok-
ing. “Healthy patients” were defined as participants without any immunocompromising or chronic medical conditions listed above [8, 17
, 18].
bBMI was measured as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). Two participants were missing information about BMI.
cOne participant was missing information about PSI.
dOne person was missing information about whether or not they had weekly exposure to a child aged <5 years.
eFour participants were missing information about current drug abuse.

those from the primary analysis. This finding is not surprising 
given that previous studies of influenza VE have also suggested 
that variations in the definition of test-negative controls have lit-
tle impact on overall point estimates [29]. Results from sensitivity 
analyses that restricted controls to non-PCV13-type pneumo-
coccal CAP, however, were not statistically significant at P < .05, 
likely due to a large reduction in sample size when restricting the 
analysis population to pneumococcal CAP patients.
Our study has limitations. Although TND studies have been 
shown to be valid for determining VE, the TND is an observa-
tional study and is not immune to selection bias or confound-
ing [10–12, 30]. Our VE results were, however, highly robust 
to adjustment for many potentially confounding factors (eg, 
age, risk status, and previous history of PPSV23 and influenza 
vaccine) and sensitivity analyses of how test-negative controls 
were defined. In observational settings, the TND is less sus-
ceptible to bias caused by differences in healthcare-seeking 
behavior among cases and controls [10–12, 30]. In traditional 
case-control studies, it is often difficult to ensure that controls 
are representative of the source population from which cases 
were identified [31]. However, test-negative controls are, by 
definition, patients presenting with similar clinical syndromes 
as cases (hospitalized CAP in our study).
UAD (alone) detected the large majority of PCV13-type CAP 
cases in our study. The sensitivity and specificity of UAD were 
shown to both be nearly 100% based on blood culture, both 
in the original UAD validation studies [20, 21] and in a recent 
multicenter study conducted by CDC [22]. It should be noted, 
however, that no gold standard for nonbacteremic CAP exists. If 
nonbacteremic pneumonia leads to less antigenuria than bactere-
mic pneumonia, sensitivity of the UAD may be lower for detect-
ing nonbacteremic cases. There is no reason, however, to assume 
this would occur differently between vaccinated and unvacci-
nated persons. Thus, any reduced sensitivity of the UAD for non-
bacteremic disease (that occurred nondifferentially) would only 
drive our VE estimates toward the null (ie, our estimates would 
underestimate the true VE). Moreover, VE estimates are pri-
marily dependent on test specificity. UAD agreed with the gold 
standard of blood culture in our study in 4 of 5 instances. In the 
1 instance of discordance with blood culture, both UAD and cul-
ture both identified a PCV13 serotype, thus this discordance (ie, 
defaulting to culture) did not impact our results.
Another limitation is that PCV13 uptake during our study 
period was relatively low (roughly 14%). Nevertheless, pneumo-
coccal vaccination history was collected in a stringent manner 
that required health insurance company verification for each

aVE was calculated as 1 minus the odds ratio from the logistic regression model of PCV13 vs no PCV13 multiplied by 100%. Season of enrollment was modeled as spring vs summer vs 
fall vs winter. Age group was modeled as age 65–79 vs ≥80 years. Gender was modeled as male vs female. Race was modeled as white vs non-white. Ethnicity was modeled as Hispanic 
vs non-Hispanic. Place of residence was modeled as home vs other. Risk level was based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifications of risk for pneumococcal disease 
and modeled as healthy vs at-risk vs high-risk [8, 17
, 18]. BMI (kg/m2) was modeled as obese vs overweight vs normal weight vs underweight; two patients were missing information 
about BMI and were excluded from the univariate and fully-adjusted models. PSI was modeled as a continuous variable; one patient was missing information about PSI and was excluded 
from the univariate and fully-adjusted models. Healthcare exposure in last 3 months, weekly exposure to children aged <5 years, influenza vaccine receipt within previous year, and history 
of PPSV23 in last 5 years were modeled as yes vs no. One patient was missing information about weekly exposure to children aged <5 years and was excluded from the univariate and 
fully-adjusted models.

PCV13 Vaccine Effectiveness in US Adults
patient. We excluded patients who received pneumococcal vac-
cination within 30 days of urine sample collection to prevent 
false positives by UAD [19]. PCV13 coverage was slightly higher 
(18%) if these patients were included in population uptake esti-
mates. PCV13 uptake based on health-insurer records in our 
study (14%−18% with study midpoint between September and 
October of 2015) was comparable to national estimates of PCV13 
coverage based on Medicare claims for the same age group and 
time period recently published by the CDC (15%−20% between 
September and October of 2015) [9]. It is possible that some 
patients received PCV13, but no record of PCV13 receipt could be 
found in health insurance claims [9]. This potential misclassifica-
tion bias, however, would drive results toward the null (ie, lower 
VE estimate), and would only overestimate VE if it occurred dif-
ferentially between cases and test-negative controls. Finally, the 
overall number of cases was relatively small (n = 68), and because 
only 3 patients who received PCV13 developed VT-CAP, mean-
ingful evaluations of serotype-specific PCV13 VE and stratified 
analyses (eg, VE among different risk groups) were not possible.
The estimated annual incidence of hospitalized CAP in the 
Louisville surveillance study for adults aged ≥65 years was 
approximately 2300 per 100 000 person-years [32], and the 
United States has roughly 49 million adults in that age group. 
Thus, the 73% (95% CI, 13%−92%) effectiveness against 3.7% 
of CAP observed in our study translates to an estimated rate 
reduction of hospitalized CAP of approximately 62 (11−78) 
per 100 000 person-years. Over 5 years, for which PCV13 has 
shown a minimum duration of protection [33, 34], this rep-
resents 137 000 (24 000−173 000) cumulative cases of hospital-
ized CAP that are potentially preventable with PCV13 in the 
United States. This is comparable to the estimated number of 
hospitalizations averted from the US seasonal influenza vac-
cination program in the same age group (13 000−166 000) 
based on CDC estimates of annual influenza-related hospital-
ization in nonpandemic years [35, 36] and assuming a range 
of influenza VE of 20%−60% in older adults [37]. Further, 
based on the median hospitalization length of 6 days and the 
6.5%−12.7% risk of dying as a result of the CAP hospitalization 
observed in our study, this could equate to as many as 824 000 
(145 000−1 035 000) hospital days and 17 440 (1570−21 920) 
deaths averted over 5 years with adult PCV13 use in the United 
States. To date, PCV13 uptake in older US adults has been

PCV13 vaccination in this US population, and in other adult
