Abstract
Background
Cancer cachexia negatively impacts cancer-related treatment options, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality,
yet no established therapies exist. We investigated the anabolic properties of testosterone to limit the loss of body mass in
late stage cancer patients undergoing standard of care cancer treatment.
Methods
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial was undertaken to assess the potential ther-
apeutic role of adjunct testosterone to limit loss of body mass in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix or head
and neck undergoing standard of care treatment including chemotherapy and chemoradiation. Patients were randomly
assigned in blocks to receive weekly injections of either 100 mg testosterone enanthate or placebo for 7 weeks. The primary
outcome was per cent change in lean body mass, and secondary outcomes included assessment of quality of life, tests of phys-
ical performance, muscle strength, daily activity levels, resting energy expenditure, nutritional intake, and overall survival.
Results
A total of 28 patients were enrolled, 22 patients were studied to completion, and 21 patients were included in the
final analysis (12 placebo, nine testosterone). Adjunct testosterone increased lean body mass by 3.2% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0–7%) whereas those receiving placebo lost 3.3% (95% CI, �7% to 1%, P = 0.015). Although testosterone patients main-
tained more favourable body condition, sustained daily activity levels, and showed meaningful improvements in quality of life
and physical performance, overall survival was similar in both treatment groups.
Conclusions
In patients with advanced cancer undergoing the early phase of standard of care therapy, adjunct testosterone
improved lean body mass and was also associated with increased quality of life, and physical activity compared with placebo.

Introduction
Cancer cachexia is a tumour-induced, progressively debilitat-
ing loss of skeletal muscle, with or without a concurrent loss
of fat, experienced by many late-stage cancer patients.1 This
degenerative body condition results from an energy imbal-
ance associated with various combinations of decreased
nutritional intake (e.g. anorexia, decreased appetite, and
physical barriers to feeding) and metabolic disruption (e.g.
hypermetabolism due to tumour load and/or systemic
inflammation).
Cachexia
contributes
to
cancer-related
morbidity and mortality, reducing quality of life and cancer
treatment options.2–5 Consequently, indices of body compo-
sition such as body mass index (BMI) and weight loss are
good predictors of patient prognosis and survival.6 Despite
the impact on patient quality of life and treatment outcomes,

 weight loss is seldom monitored or managed over the course
of cancer treatment.1 Although anorexia can contribute to
weight loss in cancer patients, nutritional intervention alone
is often inadequate to fully reverse declining body condition.7
Oncologists and nutritionists treating cachectic cancer pa-
tients seek to improve treatment options,8 and multimodal
interventions that include stimulating anabolic pathways
may provide a palliative intervention.9–11
Primary and secondary hypogonadism is appreciated as a
complication in male cancer patients with implications on
body composition, survival, and quality of life. Testosterone
therapy has been proposed as potentially beneficial in some
populations of cancer patients.9,12,13 Therapeutic testoster-
one replacement has been assessed to treat fatigue in
hypogonadal male cancer patients14; however, it has not
been thoroughly tested to manage loss of lean body mass
in cancer patients. Our lab has demonstrated that women
have a similar anabolic skeletal muscle response to testoster-
one administration as men,15 and testosterone therapy along
with supplemental amino acids successfully increased lean
mass during standard of care treatment in a patient with re-
current cervical cancer.10 In this randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial, we sought to deter-
mine if the anabolic effects of testosterone supplementation
could prevent or reverse the loss of skeletal muscle in men
and women with late-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the
cervix or head and neck.
Materials and methods
Study design
This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the University of Texas Medical Branch.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
prior to participation. The primary endpoint was the per cent
change in lean body mass over 7 weeks of testosterone ther-
apy in cervical and head and neck cancer patients with ad-
vanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma staged by
their treating oncologist. Preliminary data from our lab indi-
cated that following 3 months of testosterone therapy, sub-
jects gained on average 2 kg of lean body mass with a
standard deviation of 1 kg while the placebo group had no
net change. Based on these data, power analysis for a two-
sided t-test indicated a sample size of 12 patients per group
would provide >0.99 power to detect changes in lean body
mass, with as few as six patients per group providing power
>0.87.
Because of the infirmed study population, it was not possi-
ble to maintain a strictly regimented study schedule without
interfering with patient treatment. Despite flexibility around
patient treatment schedules, average study duration and
testing schedules were similar between groups. Study dura-
tion averaged 47.8 ± 9.6 days in the placebo group and
47.0 ± 7.7 days in the testosterone group. Mid-treatment
measures were taken on average within 3.9 ± 3.3 days of
the study midpoint, and all post-treatment measures were
taken within 8 days of the final injection. A per-protocol
pairwise deletion was used to incorporate only patients with
complete pre-treatment and post-treatment datasets for
paired sample analysis. Survival was monitored for 1 year fol-
lowing the end of the study, and Kaplan–Meier survival
curves were assessed using GraphPad Prism 6.07 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical comparisons
between groups were made using unequal variance t-tests,
and
paired
sample
t-tests
were
used
to
compare
pre-treatment and post-treatment measures. A P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Patients were considered for participation in this study if
they had advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of
the cervix (stages IIB, IIIA, and IIIB) and were between the
ages of 18 and 65, or if they had advanced (stage III or IV)
or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and
were between the ages of 18 and 75. In addition, patients
were required to have lost at least 5% of body mass over
the past 12 months,16 and to be ambulatory with some activ-
ity (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0 or 1).17
Patients were deemed eligible to sign consent for study par-
ticipation by scoring >23 points on the 30 point Mini Mental
State Examination.18 We screened 28 patients of mixed age,
race, and gender with either cervical or head and neck cancer
to participate in this study (http://clinicaltrials.gov number
NCT00878995) (Figure 1).
Of the 28 screened patients, 24 signed consent and were
randomized in blocks of 3 by the institutional pharmacy to re-
ceive weekly injections of either 100 mg of testosterone
enanthate (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14). Two patients stopped
participating mid-study and were lost to follow-up. In addi-
tion, one patient in the testosterone group had multiple pri-
mary tumours and was removed from analysis.
All study data were collected at the Institute for Transla-
tional Sciences Clinical Research Center at the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX. Researchers had no
input or restrictions on standard of care patient therapy in-
cluding chemotherapy and radiation.
Testosterone treatment
A testosterone replacement paradigm commonly used to
treat hypogonadal men was chosen to include weekly im in-
jections of either 100 mg testosterone enanthate or placebo
(sterile saline) over a period of 7 weeks. Testosterone and
placebo injections were given by a nurse using an opaque sy-
ringe to obscure visual differences between testosterone and

 placebo. Because of the late stages of cancer examined in this
study, we elected to treat both men and women with the
same dose of testosterone as this dose and duration would
not
be
expected
to
affect
female
secondary
sexual
characteristics.
Blood chemistry
Laboratory reports from blood drawn as part of patient stan-
dard of care were used to monitor blood haemoglobin con-
centration (Hb), total haematocrit (HCT), total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),
C-reactive protein, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
Average pre-treatment and post-treatment values for pla-
cebo and testosterone groups are reported. Blood levels of
testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone-binding
globulin
(SHBG)
were
measured
pre-treatment,
mid-
treatment, and post-treatment. Because of sex-related differ-
ences in these values, blood levels were assessed separately
for men and women, resulting in four separate groups (i.e. fe-
male placebo, male placebo, female testosterone, and male
testosterone). Average pre-treatment values were compared
between combined groups (men and women) and between
treatment groups within each sex using unequal variance t-
tests. Because the treatment level of testosterone, free tes-
tosterone, and SHBG are directly affected by treatment, each
patient’s mid-treatment and post-treatment levels were com-
bined to determine an average on-treatment level. Average
treatment levels were compared with pre-treatment levels
within each group to assess changes in hormone levels using
paired sample t-tests. Two of the six women in the testoster-
one group were not included in the analysis of free testoster-
one and SHBG because pre-treatment values were not
available. An additional two women in the testosterone
group had only a single treatment measure of SHBG to deter-
mine average treatment level.
Body composition
Primary measures of lean mass, along with secondary mea-
sures of total body mass, fat mass, and bone mineral content,
were assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-
treatment time points by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) scans using a GE Lunar iDXA (GE Healthcare; Chicago,
IL, USA). BMI was calculated from total body mass and
patient height. Pre-treatment and post-treatment DXA data
Figure 1 History of study participation from screening through analysis for patients with cervical (C) or head and neck (H/N) cancer. In this double-
blind study, cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive weekly doses of testosterone (T) or placebo (P) for 7 weeks. Blood chemistry was mon-
itored for safety, and hormone levels tested regularly. Nutritional intake and activity was monitored throughout. Patients with pre and post-treatment
measurements were analysed for body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), resting energy expenditure (REE), physical performance
(Biodex and Short Physical Performance Battery), and quality of life questionnaires (General Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy).

 were collected for all 12 placebo and nine testosterone pa-
tients; however, mid-treatment scans were missing for one
testosterone patient. Mid-treatment values are depicted
graphically but not included in statistical analysis. Average
pre-treatment DXA measures for placebo and testosterone
groups were compared using unequal variance t-tests. Paired
sample t-tests were used to determine significance of change
from pre-treatment values to post-treatment time points
within each group. The post-treatment per cent change from
baseline was determined for each patient, and the average
per cent change in the placebo and testosterone groups
was compared using unequal variance t-tests.
Dynamic muscle strength
A Biodex System 4 Pro dynamometer (Biodex Medical Sys-
tems; Shirley, NY, USA) was used to assess pre-treatment
and post-treatment peak leg extension torque and power
for seven placebo and eight testosterone patients. Mid-
treatment measures were not available for two of the eight
testosterone patients. Patients completed a warm-up set of
30 leg extensions at a maximum angular velocity of 500°/s
(chosen to minimize resistance during the warm-up). Follow-
ing the warm-up period, peak isometric torque was measured
during three sets of three sustained contractions of 5 s each
against a fixed angle of 90°. The three sets were conducted at
a patient-determined 25% (set 1), 50% (set 2), and 100%
(set 3) effort with a rest period of 15 s between sets. Follow-
ing a rest period of 2 min, peak isokinetic power was similarly
measured over three sets of three repetitions at an angular
velocity of 90°/s, with sets at 25% (set 1), 50% (set 2), and
100% (set 3) of maximal patient-determined effort, with rep-
etitions within each set occurring approximately once every
5 s and a rest period of 15 s between each set. Average
pre-treatment peak power and peak torque measures for
the placebo and testosterone groups were compared using
unequal variance t-tests. Mid-treatment values are depicted
graphically but not included in the statistical analysis. The
per cent change for each patient over the duration of the
study was compared in the placebo and testosterone groups
using unequal variance t-tests. Paired sample t-tests were
used to determine significance of change from pre-treatment
to post-treatment time points for each group.
Physical performance
A Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)19 was per-
formed at pre-treatment and post-treatment time points on
eight placebo and five testosterone patients to assess func-
tional measures of physical ability including balance, gait
speed, and the ability to rise unassisted from a chair. Compo-
nent subtests were scored based on performance and com-
bined for an overall test score. Post-treatment change from
baseline score was determined for the total SPPB score and
each subtest. A change in overall SPPB score of one point
or greater was considered meaningful.19–21
Quality of life
The General Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
(FACT-G) questionnaire (version 4) (www.facit.org) was used
to assess physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being
(SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and functional well-
being (FWB) of patients at pre-treatment and post-treatment
time points.22 Each of the 27 questions in this survey are
scored on a scale of 0 to 4 and corrected so that a higher
score indicates a more favourable response, for a maximum
of 108 points. As established in the FACIT guidelines, the
FACT-G score was included in analysis if >80% of questions
were answered in the questionnaire. Eight patients in the pla-
cebo group and eight patients in the testosterone group met
the minimum requirements for both pre-treatment and post-
treatment time points. The post-treatment change from
baseline scores was determined for the total FACT-G score,
as well as each of the four subtests, and the trial outcome in-
dex (TOI; sum of physical and function well-being subtest
scores).22 We used previously established minimal important
difference (MID) criteria to determine meaningful clinical
change within each group for total FACT-G (�8.3 decrease;
+4.4 increase), PWB (�2.2 decrease; +1.4 increase), SFWB
(�2.9 decrease; +1.9 increase), EWB (�0.7 decrease; +0.5 in-
crease), and FWB (�4.2 decrease; +1.4 increase) scores.23
The MID for the TOI was established by the sum of the con-
stituent subtest MIDs (�6.4 decrease; +2.8 increase).
Resting energy expenditure and nutrition
Resting energy expenditure was measured (mREE) according
to best-practice recommendations24 at pre-treatment and
post-treatment time points using indirect calorimetry for 10
placebo and eight testosterone patients. Following overnight
fasting, patients were asked to rest quietly for 15 min in bed.
A Vmax Encore 29 metabolic cart (Carefusion, San Diego, CA,
USA), calibrated prior to data collection, was used to monitor
oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production
(VCO2) for 25 min while the patients rested in bed under a
gas collection canopy. Values over the final 20 min of breath
collection were averaged to calculate mREE using Weir’s
equation.25 Pre-treatment mREE was compared between
groups using unequal variance t-tests and changes over the
course of the study were assessed within each group using
paired t-tests. Predicted REE (pREE) was also determined
using the Harris–Benedict equations26 based on each pa-
tient’s pre-treatment weight, age, height, and gender. Pa-
tients were considered hypometabolic if pre-treatment REE
was <90% of predicted, and hypermetabolic if pre-treatment
REE was more than 110% of predicted.27 Paired t-tests were
used to compare mREE with pREE.
Patients were asked to keep a self-reported dietary record
(SDR) of daily nutritional intake throughout the study. When
patients were housed within the Clinical Research Center at
UTMB, detailed daily hospital dietary records (HDR) charted
the mass and caloric value of all food consumed. Nutritional

 intake was determined based on serving size and per-item
nutritional information using Nutrition Data System for
Research software (versions 2009–2014), developed by the
Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Min-
neapolis, MN, USA. SDR were included in the analysis if the
patient reported not eating or recorded at least one con-
sumption event for the day. Days that included HDR that
were known to be incomplete (i.e. days when patient was
discharged, admitted, or left hospital observation) were not
included in nutritional data analysis unless SDR completed
the record for that day. For days with both SDR and HDR,
these two sources were combined with preference of over-
lapping records given to HDR to provide a complete record
for that day. Patients with at least 10 days of complete die-
tary intake records were included in the nutritional analysis,
resulting in nine placebo patients averaging 26.6 days of re-
cords and seven testosterone patients averaging 30.4 days
of records. The average daily energy intake for each patient
was determined from all qualifying records throughout the
study period.
The combination of both REE and nutritional information
was available for nine placebo and seven testosterone pa-
tients allowing an assessment of the relationship between
energy consumption and REE. Energy balance was calculated
for each patient as
Energy Balance ¼ Daily Energy Intake=Pre
�Treatment mREE
to determine the average percentage of the REE con-
sumed daily for each group.

accelerometry monitor (ActiGraph GT1M or GT3X; ActiGraph,
LLC; Pensacola, FL, USA) on their waist throughout the 7 week
study (removed only for bathing) to monitor the duration and
intensity of daily activity. Activity data were recorded in 1 min
epochs and assessed using ActiLife software version 6.8.2
(ActiGraph, LLC: Pensacola, FL, USA). A pre-set ActiLife soft-
ware algorithm (Troiano, 2007)28 was used to establish wear
time. Similarly, default software settings (Freedson Adult,
1998)29 were used to classify accelerometer-determined ac-
tivity counts per minute (CPM) into four categories29: seden-
tary (0–99 CPM), light activity (100–1951 CPM), moderate
activity (1952–5724 CPM), and vigorous activity (5725–9498
CPM). The average per cent of time spent in each activity cat-
egory per week was determined for the placebo and testos-
terone
groups
over
the
7
week
study
period
for
comparison. Only days with at least 40% wear time were in-
cluded in the analysis, consistent with thresholds used in
healthy populations30–32 as well as in other populations of
cancer patients.33–35 Valid wear days in each week with ≥1
valid wear day were used to calculate weekly mean values.32
Patient compliance for wearing activity monitors was not
complete and decreased over the duration of the study.
Two placebo and three testosterone patients did not have
any time points that met the minimum criteria and were
excluded. The total number of placebo and testosterone pa-
tients analysed for each time point is listed below the x axis
in Figure 6.
Adverse events
Adverse events were defined as events recorded in the medical
records that were not part of the patient’s routine care (e.g.
placement and maintenance of percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy (PEG) tube, intravenous fluids, and brachytherapy).
Fever associated with known infection was not listed as a sepa-
rate adverse event; however, fever not associated with a sec-
ondary diagnosis (e.g. urinary tract infection, and pneumonia)
was listed separately. Anaemia was not considered an adverse
event as it routinely occurs in cancer care and was anticipated.
Results
Overall survival
Baseline demographics were similar between the two groups,
with no significant differences (Table 1). Kaplan–Meier sur-
vival curves were not different between the two groups
(P = 0.96) with 1 year post-study survival of 56% for testoster-
one and 58% for placebo patients (Figure 2).
Blood chemistry
Average pre-treatment and post-treatment blood chemistry
levels are listed in Table 2. Five of the 10 men in the study
had baseline testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL, and nine
of the 11 women were below 30 ng/dL (Figure 3A). There
was a significant difference between men and women in
pre-treatment levels of testosterone (P < 0.001) (Figure
3B), and free testosterone (P < 0.001) (Figure 3C). Pre-
treatment levels of SHBG were highly variable and not
significantly different between men and women (P = 0.12)
(Figure 3D). Testosterone administration resulted in in-
creased average levels of testosterone in men (P = 0.011)
and women (P < 0.001), as well as increased free testoster-
one in the men (P = 0.011) and women (P = 0.019), but SHBG
did not change significantly in men (P = 0.10) or women
(P = 0.84) (Figure 3B–3D).
Throughout the study, both groups maintained an aver-
age total cholesterol level between 120 and 200 mg/dL.
Both groups also maintained average HDL levels above
35 mg/dL and average LDL levels below 160 mg/dL. Aver-
age measures of blood Hb and Hct were below anaemic

 Body composition
Body mass decreased significantly in the placebo group by an
average of 7.0% (95% CI, �9.5% to �4.5%, P < 0.001) and
was virtually unchanged in the testosterone group (�0.6%,
95% CI, �3.8% to 2.6%, P = 0.64). The average per cent loss
of body mass was significantly greater in the placebo group
than the testosterone group (P = 0.002) (Figure 4A). The aver-
age per cent change in bone mineral content was not signif-
icantly different between the placebo and testosterone
groups (P = 0.583) (Figure 4B). Lean body mass decreased
in the placebo group by an average of 2.0 kg or 3.3% (95%
CI, �7.3% to 0.7%, P = 0.09), and increased in the testoster-
one group by an average of 1.3 kg or 3.2% (95% CI, �0.5%
to 6.7%, P = 0.06). The per cent change in lean body mass
was
significantly
different
between
treatment
groups
(P = 0.015) (Figure 4C). The loss of body mass in both the pla-
cebo and testosterone groups occurred primarily from fat
loss over the duration of the study. Fat mass decreased signif-
icantly in the placebo group by an average of 17.1%
(P < 0.001) and decreased significantly in the testosterone
group by an average of 10.7% (P = 0.004). Although the mean
per cent fat lost in the placebo group was greater than the
testosterone group, this difference was not statistically signif-
icant (P = 0.092) (Figure 4D). Over the duration of the study,
BMI decreased significantly in the placebo group by an
average of 6.4% (P < 0.001) and was unchanged in the
testosterone group (�0.05%, P = 0.809). The per cent
decrease in BMI was significantly greater in the placebo
group than the testosterone group (P = 0.004) (Figure 4E).
Dynamic muscle strength
Over the duration of the study, there was no significant
change in average peak torque in the placebo group (+2.9%,
P = 0.76) or the testosterone group (+6.3%, P = 0.77). The av-
erage per cent change in peak torque was not significantly
different between the placebo and testosterone groups
(P = 0.73) (Figure 5A). Average peak power also did not
change significantly in the placebo (+3.8%, P = 0.29), or tes-
tosterone group (+7.0%, P = 0.78). The average per cent
change in peak power was not significantly different between
the placebo and testosterone groups (P = 0.83) (Figure 5B).
Physical performance
Based on previously established criteria for grading SPPB
scores,19–21 there was no meaningful change from baseline
physical performance scores in the placebo group (+0.3;
Table 3). The testosterone group had a clinically meaningful
increase in total SPPB score of 1.4 points following treatment
due primarily to an increased average chair rise score.

 Quality of life
Based on previously established criteria for minimally im-
portant difference (MID)23 the testosterone group showed
clinically meaningful improvement in total FACT-G quality
of life score (+4.5) with no meaningful change in the
placebo group (�3.1) (Tables 3 and 4). Physical well-being
declined meaningfully and to a similar extent in both the
placebo (�2.5) and testosterone (�2.6) groups. Social
well-being improved meaningfully in the testosterone group
(+3.6) and had no meaningful change in the placebo group
(�0.4).

 Resting energy expenditure and nutrition
At baseline REE testing, three testosterone and two placebo
patients were hypermetabolic with REE values more than
110% of predicted, and two testosterone and two placebo pa-
tients were hypometabolic with REE values <90% of pre-
dicted.27
Average
baseline
REE
was
not
significantly
different from predicted REE based on body weight, age,
height, and gender for the placebo (1409 kcal/day, P = 0.55)
or testosterone (1286 kcal/day, P = 0.80) groups (Table 5).
Over the duration of the study, mean REE did not change
significantly
in
the
testosterone
(post-treatment
REE = 1260 kcal/day, P > 0.99), or the placebo groups
(post-treatment REE = 1324 kcal/day, P = 0.11).
Based on combined self-reported and hospital dietary in-
take records, the average daily energy intake for the placebo
(1374 kcal/day) and testosterone (1345 kcal/day) groups
were not significantly different (P = 0.89) (Table 5). The en-
ergy balance (caloric intake/baseline REE) assessment re-
vealed that placebo patients consumed on average 96% of
the calories required by their REE, and testosterone patients
consumed 104% of their REE requirements. While the aver-
age energy balance was more positive in the testosterone
group than placebo, the values were variable and not signifi-
cantly different (P = 0.63).
Activity
The average time spent in vigorous activity remained consis-
tently low (below 0.5%) in both the placebo and testosterone
groups throughout the study (Figure 6A and 6B). Within the
testosterone group, the average time over the 7 week study
period spent in moderate activity (1.3%), light activity
(21.8%), and sedentary (76.7%) remained relatively stable
(Figure 6B). Within the placebo group, sedentary time
increased by 10.8 percentage points from a baseline of
72.5–83.3% over the 7 week study period (Figure 6A). This
increased sedentary behaviour resulted from a 2.8% point
decrease in moderate activity, and a 7.7% point decrease in
light activity.
Adverse events
Table 1 reveals that urinary tract infections occurred in five
(33%) placebo and two (22%) testosterone patients and oc-
curred exclusively in cervical cancer patients. Pneumonia oc-
curred in two (22%) testosterone patients and did not occur
in the placebo group. Fever with unreported cause occurred
in two (17%) placebo patients and was not reported in the
testosterone group. One placebo patient suffered a stroke
following a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with
blockage in a central catheter.
Discussion
Our rationale for conducting this study was based on our on-
going mechanistic studies on the effects of testosterone on
skeletal
muscle.
Although
not
sufficiently
studied,
re-
searchers recognize the potential of testosterone therapy to
treat inflammation and lean body mass loss associated with
cancer, cirrhosis, and heart failure.9,12,13,39,40 While many
studies have focused on the ability of testosterone to stimu-
late muscle protein synthesis,41–44 we have recently shown
that testosterone also has significant effects on skeletal mus-
cle wasting through its ability to inhibit expression of NF-kB
inducing kinase, a key kinase in the catabolic NF-kB signalling
pathway.45 Therefore, we hypothesized that testosterone
therapy could significantly impact cachexia in late stage can-
cer patients by both stimulating anabolic and suppressing
catabolic skeletal muscle pathways. We elected to study late
stage cancer patients to test this hypothesis in the most se-
vere of cachexia conditions. Here, we report novel findings

 that testosterone therapy prevented loss of body mass in
patients with cervical or head and neck cancer undergoing
standard of care treatment, by selectively increasing lean
mass. Moreover, this increase in lean mass resulted in
positive functional outcomes of improved quality of life and
preserved activity.

The General Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) quality of life questionnaire is composed of questions regarding physical
well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and functional well-being (FWB). Trial outcome index
(TOI, PWB + FWB) is also assessed. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) includes tests of walking speed, rising from a chair
unassisted, and standing balance. Both tests are rated so that a higher score indicates better quality of life (FACT-G) or physical
performance (SPPB).

 Seven weeks of testosterone supplementation preserved
body mass (Figure 4A) and BMI (Figure 4E) at near baseline
measures, while both declined significantly in the placebo
group. Both treatment groups had similar declines in fat mass
over the study period (Figure 4D), and the preservation of
body condition was selectively due to the differential changes
in lean body mass between the two groups (Figure 4C). While
the placebo group experienced a loss of lean body mass typ-
ically seen in cancer cachexia, patients receiving supplemen-
tal testosterone increased lean mass by over 3%. The
similar loss of fat mass in both groups suggests that
testosterone administration neither moderated nor exacer-
bated fat loss.
The increase in lean mass in the testosterone group
was associated with functional improvements in physical
performance with an increase in SPPB score of 1.4 points
(Table 3) and was also associated with patients maintaining
daily activity levels (Figure 6). This preservation of activity
occurred without discernable differences in the patient per-
ception of fatigue as assessed by FACT-G questionnaire
scores (Table 4). Questionnaire-based subjective assessment
of perceived fatigue may be an inadequate measure of treat-
ment effectiveness if it is accompanied by unrecognized
changes in physical activity.
The SFWB subtest was the most improved by testosterone
on the FACT-G questionnaire (Table 4), and specifically ques-
tions that examine the patient’s subjective interpretation of
other’s behaviours towards them (i.e. I get emotional support
from my family; I get support from my friends; my family has
accepted my illness). As a socially relevant hormone, testos-
terone levels and exogenous administration affect social in-
teractions including interpretation of the emotions and
intentions of others.46 Because testosterone has both andro-
genic and psychological effects, supplemental administration
to patients suffering from cancer cachexia may positively
affect social well-being independently from its effect on body
condition.
Although the cachexia associated with some forms of
cancer is sometimes attributed to a hypermetabolic state,47
our study did not show direct evidence of hypermetabo-
lism (Table 5). Testosterone therapy has been shown to
preferentially preserve lean mass in hypogonadal obese
men undergoing weight loss in a restricted energy diet48
and may help to maintain a more favourable body compo-
sition despite anorexia and weight loss often associated
with late stage cancer. In the testosterone group, a stable
body mass corresponded to stable REE measurements over
the study period; however, a 7.0% decrease in body mass
in the placebo group corresponded to a 9% decrease in
mREE. This reduced post-treatment mREE in the placebo
group is similar to the value predicted by the Harris–
Benedict equation based on the post-treatment reduction
in body mass.
The persistent anaemia seen throughout the study in
both treatment groups was anticipated because of bleeding
commonly associated with both cervical and head and neck
cancers as well as the standard of care chemotherapy and
radiation therapy patients underwent.49,50 In older men
and women, low testosterone levels are associated with
anaemia,51 and testosterone supplementation typically re-
sults in increased Hct and Hb.52–54 Testosterone administra-
tion effectively increases Hb in anaemic dialysis patients.55
While
not
examined
in
this
study, the
erythropoetic
stimulation by testosterone therapy has potential secondary
benefit for cancer patients at increased risk of blood loss
and anaemia.
The
body
condition
of
cancer
patients
undergoing
standard of care treatment may be degraded by factors
beyond a strict definition of cancer cachexia including
glucocorticoid treatment, chemotherapy, anorexia, and tu-
mour progression. While these additional factors are not
controlled for in this study, adjunct testosterone therapy
had a significant effect on lean body mass and is a prom-
ising, readily available intervention that could have a pro-
found clinical impact. Future larger studies are required
to discern potential confounding factors for change in lean
mass including inflammatory load, cancer progression, and
the effect of treatment. Although testosterone administra-
tion preserved lean and total body mass and improved
measures of quality of life in our study, this short-duration
treatment with limited sample size did not have a discern-
able effect on 1 year survival (Table 1; Figure 2). Because
cachectic weight loss is a good predictor of lifespan,6 the
anabolic effects of testosterone administration have the
potential to extend life in cachectic cancer patients. Future
studies of testosterone administration with greater num-
bers of patients treated at earlier stages of cancer therapy
are warranted to confirm the profound beneficial effects
on lean body mass, ensure patient safety, and properly
assess potential benefit for patient survival and other
secondary measures.

Resting energy expenditure was measured using indirect respirom-
etry (mREE) before and after treatment and compared to Harris–
Benedict predicted REE (pREE) based on pre-treatment body
weight, age, height, and gender. Nutritional intake was deter-
mined from combined self-reported and hospital dietary records.
Energy balance was calculated as the daily nutritional intake/pre-
treatment mREE.
Testosterone therapy ameliorates cancer-related muscle loss

 Conclusions
Seven weeks of testosterone supplementation ameliorated
weight loss in late stage cancer patients by preferentially
increasing lean body mass. The significant improvement in
lean body mass with testosterone administration was
associated with clinically meaningful improvements in patient
quality of life and physical performance but did not increase
survival. In the current study, 7 weeks of testosterone
therapy was not associated with adverse events or safety
concerns that could be attributed to testosterone administra-
tion in either men or women.
Acknowledgements
We thank all the wonderful patients for their selfless par-
ticipation in this trial. This study was conducted with the
Figure 6 Average weekly activity budget over a 7 week study period for head and neck or cervical cancer patients receiving weekly placebo (A) or
testosterone (B) injections. Activity was monitored by patient worn accelerometers and categorized by the per cent of total time spent in activity cat-
egories of sedentary, light activity, moderate activity, and vigorous activity. The number and per cent of total placebo (n = 12) and testosterone (n = 9)
patients that met the minimum threshold of wearing the activity monitor at least 40% of the time for each week are listed below the axis. Vigorous
activity averaged <0.5% of weekly activity at all time points and is therefore not discernable in these figures.
