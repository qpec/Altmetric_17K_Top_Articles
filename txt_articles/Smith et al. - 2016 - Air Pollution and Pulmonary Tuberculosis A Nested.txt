Introduction
Air pollution is a substantial cause of 
morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting 
in major public health impacts and millions 
of dollars lost each year [Holgate et al. 1999; 
World Health Organization (WHO) 2011]. 
Recent meta-analyses have revealed an asso-
ciation between indoor air pollution, primarily 
from biomass fuel combustion, and tubercu-
losis (TB) disease (Lin et al. 2007; Sumpter 
and Chandramohan 2013). Ecologic studies, 
including several conducted in the United 
States, also suggest that TB is associated with 
ambient air pollution, including both short-
term (Shilova and Glumnaia 2004) and long-
term exposures (Iwai et al. 2005; Smith et al. 
2014; Tremblay 2007). An ecologic study in 
Japan reported a correlation between annual 
total suspended particles in air and TB (Iwai 
et al. 2005). While exploring seasonal fluctua-
tions of TB incidence in an ecologic analysis in 
Russia, Shilova and Glumnaia (2004) found 
that along with climatic factors, atmospheric 
pollutants [including nitric oxide (NO), 
carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide 
(SO2)] were associated with TB incidence. In 
a recent study of 196 patients from two Los 
Angeles, California, hospitals, a correlation 
was observed between annual small particle-
size particulate matter (PM2.5) and acid-fast 
bacilli (AFB) smear–positive TB compared 
with AFB-negative TB (Jassal et al. 2013). 
However, epidemiologic studies that consider 
a wide variety of individual-level air pollutant 
exposures in a large sample that is generalizable 
to the general population are lacking.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative 
agent of TB. The immune system is most 
often able to contain this infection; however, 
weakened immunity, caused by HIV, 
diabetes, and a host of other factors, can 
cause TB to reactivate (i.e., to progress from 
inactive to active infection) (Raviglione et al. 
1995; WHO 2010). Biologically, air pollut-
ants could be involved in the reactivation of 
TB through altering macrophage function, 
thereby increasing susceptibility to developing 
active TB. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) play a central 
role in containing and inhibiting the growth 
of mycobacteria (Flad et al. 1995; Fremond 
et al. 2005), but animal experiments on the 
effects of air pollution on cytokine expression 
in general (Saito et al. 2002a) and in response 
to mycobacterial infection (Hiramatsu et al. 
2005; Saito et al. 2002b) have both indicated 
decreased levels of these proteins. Long-term 
exposure to diesel exhaust has been shown to 
reduce TNF-α and IFN-γ production (Saito 
et al. 2002a, 2002b), to decrease expres-
sion of IFN-γ and inducible NO synthase 
mRNAs, and to increase the mycobacterial 
load in mice (Hiramatsu et al. 2005).
In this study, we aimed to investigate 
whether exposure to criteria air pollutants 
SO2, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), CO, ozone 
(O3), particulate matter with aerodynamic 
diameter of ≤ 10 μm (PM10), and particu-
late matter with aerodynamic diameter of 
≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is associated with increased 
risk of active pulmonary TB in a well-defined 
population of northern California residents.
Methods
Study Population
We conducted a nested case–control study 
of the association between air pollution and 
pulmonary TB disease among members of 
Kaiser Permanente Northern California 
(KPNC), an integrated health care delivery 
system providing care to 3.3 million resi-
dents in the greater San Francisco, Oakland, 
San Jose, Sacramento, and Fresno areas. 
KPNC serves ~25–30% of the entire popu-
lation in the geographic areas served. Cases 
included all patients newly diagnosed with 
active pulmonary TB among adult KPNC

Background: Ecologic analyses, case–case comparisons, and animal experiments suggest positive 
associations between air pollution and tuberculosis.
oBjectives: We evaluated this hypothesis in a large sample, which yielded results that are appli-
cable to the general population.
Methods: We conducted a case–control study nested within a cohort of Kaiser Permanente of 
Northern California members. All active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases newly diagnosed 
between 1996 and 2010 (n = 2,309) were matched to two controls (n = 4,604) by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity on the index date corresponding with the case diagnosis date. Average individual-level 
concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone 
(O3), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and 10 μm (PM10) 
for 2 years before diagnosis/entry into the study were estimated using measurements from the 
California Air Resources Board monitor closest to the participant’s residence.
results: In single-pollutant adjusted conditional logistic regression models, the pulmonary TB 
odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the highest quintile (vs. lowest) were 1.50 (95% CI: 
1.15, 1.95) for CO and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.84) for NO2. Corresponding estimates were 
higher among never [1.68 (95% CI: 1.26, 2.24)] than ever [1.19 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.92)] smokers 
for CO. In contrast, for NO2, estimates were higher among ever [1.81 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.91)] 
than never [1.29 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.71)] smokers. O3 was inversely associated for smokers [0.66 
(95% CI: 0.43, 1.02)] and never smokers [0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81)]. No other consistent patterns 
were observed.
conclusions: In this first, to our knowledge, U.S. nested case–control study on air pollu-
tion and pulmonary TB, we observed positive associations with ambient CO and NO2, which 
require confirmation.

members. Cases were individuals, between 
January 1996 and December 2010, with 
either: a) a new clinical diagnosis and a 
prescription for at least 30 days of anti-
tuberculosis medication such as isoniazid, 
rifampin, ethambutol, or pyrazinamide; or 
b) an initial positive TB culture. For cases, 
diagnosis date, use of anti-TB drugs and 
relevant laboratory assays were abstracted 
from the KPNC clinical databases. Controls, 
selected from KPNC members free of TB on 
the index date of diagnosis of the case, were 
matched to cases (2:1) by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, 
other). All cases and controls were KPNC 
members for a minimum of 2 years prior to 
entry into the study. Institutional Review 
Board approval was obtained from KPNC 
and from the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill before research was initiated. 
This study was limited to analysis of existing 
data that involved no direct inter 
action with 
subjects and therefore met criteria for a waiver 
of informed consent.
Exposure Assessment
Exposures estimates for each individual were 
determined using average ambient concentra-
tions of PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO, and 
SO2 from all relevant monitors operating in 
California in the 24 months before diagnosis/
entry into the study. Based on the assumption 
that air pollution acts to increase susceptibility 
to develop pulmonary TB upon exposure to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we posited a priori 
that the etiologically relevant exposure window 
was the period within 24 months before the 
initial infection with TB (Raviglione et al. 
1995; WHO 2010). Pollutant concentrations 
were obtained using monitoring stations from 
California’s State and Local Air Monitoring 
Network Plan (http://www.arb.ca.gov/aqd/
netrpt/netrpt.htm) with ≥ 75% complete-
ness in each month. Monitors with ≥ 25% 
incomplete data for a month were not 
included in the analysis; therefore, pollutant 
exposure measurements obtained from these 
monitors were recoded as missing and were not 
included in the analysis for that pollutant. The 
Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual 
Environments (IMPROVE 2012) network, 
which provides additional coverage of PM2.5 in 
less-populated areas of the state, was included 
to supplement PM2.5 measurements because 
state and local agencies only began monitoring 
PM2.5 in 1999.
To assess individual-level air pollution 
exposure, geocoded patient home addresses 
(current and up to 2 years before diagnosis) 
were assigned the pollutant concentra-
tion of the closest available monitor (see 
Figures S1–S6 for the distribution of monitors 
in California). For each study participant, 
monthly exposures were estimated for each 
residence of record during the 24 months 
before diagnosis/entry into the study and were 
then added together to calculate the average 
of the aggregate exposures. In addition, we 
assigned average 8-hr values for CO and 
O3 {consistent with the values used for the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards [U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
2008b]} from these same monitors closest to 
each participant’s home address.
Potential individual-level confounders 
and effect measure modifiers were ascertained 
from KPNC’s electronic clinical databases, 
including data on age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
length of KPNC membership, cigarette 
smoking, alcohol hospitalization (defined as 
any record of hospitalization in which exces-
sive alcohol intake/abuse was documented 
within the electronic clinical data), HIV 
status, comorbidity (diabetes, COPD, renal 
dialysis), and residential address history. To 
examine the potential role of smoking in the 
association between air pollution and pulmo-
nary TB, a variable was constructed from all 
smoking information recorded in the KPNC 
electronic clinical database; if smoking was 
indicated anywhere in the records, the subject 
was considered an ever smoker; otherwise, 
the subject was considered a never smoker. 
Additionally, data from the 2000 U.S. Census 
were used to create block-level continuous 
variables (median household income, percent 
foreign-born, and percent with more than 
high school education) as indicators of socio-
economic status at diagnosis/study entry for 
factors not routinely collected at KPNC.
Statistical Analysis
We used conditional logistic regression 
analysis, adjusting for all matching factors (age, 
sex, and race/ethnicity), to estimate the odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the association between pulmonary 
TB and each average air pollutant concentra-
tion (SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM10 and PM2.5) 
assigned to each individual for the 24 months 
prior to diagnosis date/date of study entry. 
Exposure levels below the 20th percentile were 
used as the referent category for each pollutant. 
Individual monthly air pollutant averages were 
considered in the 24 months before diagnosis 
(to explore variations in lag time), but our 
conclusions did not differ from the 24-month 
averages; threfore, the results for the 24-month 
averages are shown.
Potential confounders and effect modi-
fiers were identified through reviewing current 
literature and by examining causal diagrams 
to clarify relationships between factors 
(Rothman et al. 2012). Potential confounders 
were further assessed using a > 10% change in 
estimate criteria (Greenland 1989) for several 
risk factors that could potentially confound 
the relationship between air pollution and 
pulmonary TB: cigarette smoking, length 
of KPNC membership, median household 
income, percent foreign-born people in 
the census block, education in the residen-
tial census block, alcohol hospitalization, 
diabetes, and HIV status. Using these criteria, 
no factors were found to confound the air 
 
pollution– 
pulmonary TB associations and 
were therefore not included in the final 
analysis. The final models included only the 
matching factors (age, sex, and race/ethnicity).
Potential effect modifiers [cigarette 
smoking, alcohol hospitalizations, diabetes, 
COPD, HIV status, renal dialysis (all catego-
rized as ever/never), and percent foreign born 
in census block (continuous)] were further 
assessed using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) 
(Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). To deter-
mine the presence of effect modification, 
we compared LRTs from models with and 
without interaction terms included in the 
conditional logistic regression model. Effect 
modification was considered present if the 
LRT differed at a significance level of < 0.10. 
Only smoking met this criterion, and thus 
only these stratum-specific ORs are shown.
A multipollutant analysis for air pollution 
and pulmonary TB association was also consid-
ered. All analyses were performed using SAS 
(version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Characteristics of pulmonary TB cases and 
matched controls nested within the KPNC 
membership are summarized in Table 1. We 
identified 2,309 cases of pulmonary TB, and 
4,604 controls matched 2:1 to cases by age, 
sex, and race/ethnicity, which were drawn 
from the existing KNPC membership during 
the study period, 1996–2010. Less than one-
third (2,028) of the participants were classified 
as ever smokers. The study population was split 
equally by sex, although a larger percentage 
of males were considered ever smokers than 
females (44.1% vs. 19.9% among cases 
and 36.0% vs. 20.1% among controls). As 
expected, never smokers were younger than 
ever smokers (median = 47 and 54 years, 
respectively). The proportion of Asians and 
Hispanics within this study was consistent 
with the racial/ethnic distribution of resi-
dents in this geographic area, as well as the 
at-risk population for TB in the United States 
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) 2011].
As shown in Table 2, average ambient air 
pollution concentrations in the 24 months 
before the diagnosis date varied greatly for 
participants. Median air pollution concentra-
tions were the same among never smokers 
and ever smokers for all pollutants, with the 
exception of CO. Ambient CO concentra-
tions measured in the 24 months prior to 
pulmonary TB diagnosis/entry into the

study were slightly higher for never smokers 
than for ever smokers. Because the number 
and location of available monitors within 
the network varied, particularly for PM2.5, 
which was not routinely monitored until 
1999, the number of cases and controls with 
available pollutant data also varied over the 
study (see Table 3). As shown in Table 4, 
Spearman’s correlation air-pollutant averages 
in the 24 months before the date of diagnosis 
showed only moderate correlations between 
pollutants. The strongest correlation observed 
between ambient averages of air pollutants 
was seen for PM10 and PM2.5 (r = 0.61).
Pulmonary TB
Figure 1 and Table 5 present the odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for the single-pollutant model associations 
between air pollution (in quintiles) and 
pulmonary TB in the 24 months prior to 
diagnosis date/study entry among all cases 
and matched controls. All effect estimates 
were adjusted for the matching factors of 
age, sex, and race/ethnicity. There was no 
evidence of association between any of the 
criteria pollutants PM2.5, PM10, and SO2, 
and pulmonary TB.
As shown in Figure 1 and Table 5, CO 
and NO2 were positively associated with 
pulmonary TB for the two highest quintiles 
of exposure in single-pollutant models. For 
example, the strongest positive effect esti-
mates among all subjects (ever and never 
smokers combined) for the association 
of ambient air pollution and pulmonary 
TB were observed for CO [OR = 1.50 
(95% CI: 1.15, 1.95)], as shown in Table 5. 
Additionally, as measured concentrations of 
CO exposure increased, the associated odds of 
pulmonary TB increased. NO2 was also posi-
tively associated with pulmonary TB, with 
an apparent dose–response pattern between 
exposure and pulmonary TB odds.
An inverse association was observed for 
8-hr O3 and pulmonary TB, with all expo-
sures above the lowest quintile resulting in 
decreases in the effect estimates, which was 
evident in the single-pollutant models. For 
example, compared with those in the lowest 
quintile of O3 exposure, those in the highest 
quintile had a considerable decrease in risk 
of pulmonary TB [OR = 0.66 (95% CI: 
0.55, 0.79)].
We also considered multi-pollutant 
models (Table 5). Although the results of 
the single- and multi-pollutant models were 
generally consistent, effect estimates were 
attenuated. For instance, in multi-pollutant 
models, the OR for the highest quintile of 
Table 1. Distribution of characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis disease (TB) cases and matched controls nested within the Kaiser Permanente of Northern 
California (KPNC) membership, 1996–2010.

CO exposure was 1.21 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.83). 
Moreover, the dose–response pattern observed 
in the single-pollutant model for the associa-
tion between CO and pulmonary TB became 
nonmonotonic in the multi-pollutant models. 
Although the dose–response pattern between 
NO2 exposure and pulmonary TB odds 
continued to be observed in multi-pollutant 
models, multi-pollutant CIs included the 
null value.
Pulmonary TB Stratified by 
Smoking
In single-pollutant models, cigarette smoking 
was found to be an effect modifier of the 
association between ambient CO and pulmo-
nary TB (p = 0.10) for the interaction on a 
multiplicative scale. Following stratification, 
a dose–response pattern persisted among 
never smokers, and the effect estimates for 
the highest quintiles of 8-hr CO exposure, 
compared with those of the lowest, were more 
pronounced among never smokers [OR = 1.68 
(95% CI: 1.26, 2.24)] than among ever 
smokers [OR = 1.19 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.92)], as 
shown in Figure 2 and Table 6.
Once stratified on smoking status, the 
dose–response pattern previously observed 
in nonstratified models was less pronounced. 
The association between NO2 and pulmonary 
TB, in the single-pollutant models, was more 
pronounced among ever smokers [OR = 1.81 
(1.13, 2.92) for the highest vs. the lowest 
quintile of exposure] than among never 
smokers [OR = 1.29 (0.97, 1.71)], but based 
on LRT heterogeneity in the effect estimates 
was not statistically significant (p = 0.19).
Upon stratification by smoking status, 
the strength of the inverse association was 
similar among both never smokers and ever 
smokers in the single-pollutant models for the 
 
association between O3 and pulmonary TB.
Stratified analyses of the multi-pollutant 
model estimates by cigarette smoking status 
yielded results similar to those of the single-
pollutant analysis (see Table S1).
Discussion
In this sample of residents of northern 
California (2,309 cases and 4,604 controls), 
which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 
large U.S. study within a well-defined popula-
tion to assess the potential associations between 
individual-level estimates of the criteria air 
pollutants and pulmonary TB, exposure to 
average 8-hr CO concentrations in the highest 
quintile during the 24 months before diagnosis 
was associated with a 50% elevation in the 
odds of developing pulmonary TB (95% CI: 
15, 95%) relative to the odds among those 
in the lowest quintile of exposure. When 
the analysis was stratified by smoking status, 
effect estimates for the association between 
CO and pulmonary TB were slightly stronger 
for never smokers and weaker or null for ever 
smokers. Positive associations were also noted 
for NO2, although the magnitude of the asso-
ciation was stronger in ever smokers than in 
never smokers. In addition, effect estimates 
were reduced by approximately one-third for 
O3. No consistent associations were observed 
among the other pollutants studied, including 
PM2.5, PM10, and SO2.
Multi-pollutant analyses were conducted 
to assess the association of combined 
exposure to several air pollutants with odds of

 Air pollution and pulmonary TB in Northern California

pulmonary TB. Although the multi-pollutant 
model may account for possible mutual 
confounding between pollutants, there is the 
potential for variance inflation and bias in 
analyses that adjust for multiple pollutants if 
these are highly correlated (Rothman et al. 
2012; Schisterman et al. 2009). Because it 
is unclear which model resulted in the least-
biased estimates, both single- and multi-
pollutant model results were presented. 
Several of the effect estimates from the multi-
pollutant models for the association between 
air pollution and pulmonary TB are attenu-
ated toward the null value, with wider confi-
dence intervals than in the single-pollutant 
model; however, the effect estimates continue 
to reflect the same patterns of association in 
general. These results emphasize the need for 
precise effect estimates as well as for improved 
assessment of both air pollution exposure 
concentrations and smoking status.
The associations observed for CO were 
consistent with other available evidence on 
this issue. Exposure to ambient CO in the 
United States in this setting is primarily a 
marker of exposure to combustion products 
and secondary vehicular traffic (U.S. EPA 
2010), and experimental studies have shown 
that diesel exhaust affects immune processes 
that inhibit TB in mice (Hiramatsu et al. 
2005; Saito et al. 2002b). The findings of 
a previous study of combustion products 
are consistent with the hypothesis that coal 
consumption, according to annual historical 
statistics, may be linked to TB because both 
have followed similar trends in the United 
States, Canada, and China (Tremblay 2007), 
although this is a crude ecological comparison 
(Tremblay 2007).
In our study, risk of pulmonary TB was 
also positively associated with exposure to 
NO2. This gaseous pollutant is produced 
primarily from combustion sources, such as 
motor vehicle exhaust and electric generating 
units (U.S. EPA 2008a). Individuals living 
near busy roads are therefore more likely to 
be exposed to NO2 pollution (Gilbert et al. 
2007; U.S. EPA 2008a) than individuals 
who do not, and they may disproportionately 
suffer from any related health effects [U.S. 
EPA 2008b; Health Effects Institute Panel 
on the Health Effects of Traffic-Related Air 
Pollution (HEI) 2010; Oosterlee et al. 1996]. 
Although individual pollutant exposure 
depends predominantly on local outdoor 
concentrations, indoor pollution such as 
smoking and using gas appliances may alter 
exposure levels (U.S. EPA 2008b). It is also 
possible that the associations with NO2 may 
represent exposure to traffic-related air pollu-
tion rather than exposure to NO2 specifically.
In this study, an inverse association was 
observed for O3 and pulmonary TB, with all 
exposures above the lowest quintile resulting

in decreases in pulmonary TB risk. This 
observed relationship between O3 concen-
trations and pulmonary TB is not entirely 
unexpected because levels of ambient O3 and 
NO2 are bonded by chemical coupling. In 
the presence of sunlight, nitrogen is depleted 
in the formation of O3 (Clapp and Jenkin 
2001; U.S. EPA 2013). As a result, indi-
viduals exposed to high levels of NO2 often 
experience low levels of O3, particularly along 
high-traffic areas (Jerrett et al. 2005; Lipsett 
et al. 2011).
We observed no consistent association 
between PM2.5 and pulmonary TB. We are 
aware of one previous study (Jassal et al. 2013) 
that reported a positive association between 
ambient PM2.5 and the odds of having acid 
fast bacilli detected (vs. not detected) on a 
sputum smear (an indication of active TB); 
however, this finding was based on a popula-
tion of fewer than 200 hospital patients in Los 
Angeles, California. In contrast, our results are 
based on nested case–control study data for 
6,913 participants who were broadly represen-
tative of the northern California population 
from which they were drawn, and our cases 
were compared with a control population that 
did not have active TB. Additional studies 
are needed to elucidate possible associations 
between PM2.5 and active pulmonary TB.
Assigning individual average exposures by 
relying on the ambient air monitoring near 
to the participant’s home likely introduces 
some exposure misclassification. This issue 
may be particularly relevant to CO assessments 
because of considerable spatial variability in 
ambient CO concentrations (U.S. EPA 2010). 
Further, exposure misclassification might have 
occurred as a result of variations in residential 
ventilation systems, levels of physical activity, 
or time spent outdoors, away from home, or 
traveling by car outside of the participant’s resi-
dential area. This last item is important because 
considerable CO exposure can be experienced 
while driving or riding in vehicles (U.S. EPA 
2010). However, these potential sources of 
error are common to many epidemiologic 
studies focused on assessing health effects 
associated with air pollution that have also 
used our approach to estimate individual-level 
ambient concentrations (Brauer et al. 2008; 
Brunekreef et al. 2009; Lipsett et al. 2011). 
These errors are perhaps nondifferential, given 
that exposure estimates for our cohort of Kaiser 
subjects were constructed at CARB (by C.G.), 
without knowledge of the subjects’ outcome 
status, by matching the subject address 
recorded in each subject’s medical record with 
the air pollutant concentrations recorded at 
the nearest monitor. In addition, cases and 
controls were nested in the Kaiser cohort 
and were required to have at least 2 years of 
Kaiser membership for study eligibility, 
and we adjusted for census-block–derived 
Figure 2. Conditional logistic regression estimated adjusteda odds ratios (ORs)b and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) for the associations of pulmonary tuberculosis (pulmonary TB) and quintilec in the estimates of

education and income, all of which would 
help to reduce any differential misclassifica-
tion bias associated with residential location 
and hence exposure estimation. All of these 
issues would increase the likelihood of nondif-
ferential exposure misclassification, which 
may bias results toward the null (Rothman 
et al. 2012). However, differential misclassi-
fication is possible, given that assignment of 
exposure status was not dichotomous; thus, 
spurious associations could arise. Perhaps by 
improving exposure estimation through the 
use of sophisticated methods such as land use 
regression or kriging (Hoek et al. 2008; Jerrett 
et al. 2005), future studies could enhance our 
ability to determine the true magnitude of the 
air  
pollution–TB association.
To examine the potential role of smoking 
in the association between air pollution 
and TB, participants were considered never 
smokers if there was no indication of smoking 
anywhere in their records. This method of 
categorizing smokers may have resulted in 
underestimation of smoking prevalence in 
this study population if smoking status was 
underreported in the clinical data. This under-
estimation could have lead to a spurious 
result when smoking status was included in 
the analyses if the error was differential by air 
pollution exposure status. However, the assign-
ment of smoking status was made blinded to 
case status and air pollution exposure status; 
thus, differential misclassification of smoking 
seems unlikely. Further, for study eligibility, 
cases and controls were matched on age and 
were required to have Kaiser membership of at 
least 2 years in duration, both of which would 
help to reduce—although not entirely elimi-
nate—the likelihood of differential exposure 
misclassification because of cohort or accul-
turation differences. Nondifferential error of 
a covariate would result in attenuation of the 
effect  
estimates (Rothman et al. 2012).
Recent immigration status, a factor that 
puts individuals at disproportionately increased 
risk of TB in the United States (CDC 2011), 
was not available for cases and controls in this 
population. Instead, we included the percent 
of the census block that was foreign-born 
in our early statistical models; however, the 
covariate did not confound our associations. 
Although use of this proxy is inexact, manda-
tory screening confirms that all immigrants 
should be free of active TB upon entry into the 
United States (Liu et al. 2009). Furthermore, 
to ensure that recent immigrants (those 
at the highest risk) were screened out of the 
study and that we captured cases of TB that 
were activated within the United States, we 
implemented a 2-year KPNC membership 
 
requirement for study eligibility.
This nested case–control study conducted 
within a large well-defined population has 
several advantages. The KPNC membership 
provided a clear sampling framework for selec-
tion of controls and enabled a broad represen-
tation of the population at large. However, 
KPNC members were somewhat better 
educated than the surrounding geographic 
population, had fewer individuals in the 
income extremes, and had a lower prevalence 
of smokers (Gordon 2006). Nevertheless, the 
uniform access to health care in this popula-
tion minimized the potential for selection bias, 
and the availability of detailed clinical data 
allowed us to explore potential confounding 
and effect modification of numerous risk 
factors associated with TB including chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
alcohol hospitalizations, diabetes, renal 
dialysis, and immunosuppressive conditions 
including HIV (CDC 2011; Liu et al. 2009). 
Finally, the availability of the criteria air pollu-
tion data permitted us to construct ambient 
exposure concentrations during the 24-month 
period prior to a diagnosis of pulmonary TB 
for all KPNC study participants with available 
pollutant data; this period is considered the 
critical window between exposure to myco-
bacteria and development of active pulmonary 
TB (Raviglione et al. 1995; WHO 2010).
The persistence of ambient air pollution 
remains a major public health problem, and 
millions worldwide die each year from causes 
directly related to air pollution (WHO 2011). 
Although levels of air pollution have continu-
ally dropped in the United States and in other 
developed countries in recent years, levels in 
developing countries remain high and are 
even increasing in many areas (WHO 2011). 
Many of the same countries with high levels 
of air pollution are also burdened with the 
highest levels of TB and increasing prevalence 
of cigarette smoking (Cohen and Mehta 2007; 
Hassmiller 2006).
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results showed positive 
associations between ambient concentrations 
of CO and NO2 and risk of pulmonary TB 
among residents of northern California. To 
our knowledge, this is the first large, nested 
case–control study with individual-level esti-
mates of air pollution concentrations that has 
been conducted in the United States; thus, 
future studies in places similar to the United 
States (i.e., with low TB rates and low air 
pollution levels) using larger sample sizes and 
improved characterization of smoking status 
(both allowing for examination within various 
smoking strata) are needed to confirm our 
findings. Studies are also needed in countries 
outside the United States that experience 
higher rates of TB and increased exposure to 
outdoor air pollution. Given the large number 
of people worldwide who are infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are exposed 
to high concentrations of air pollution, any 
association between air pollution and TB is of 
considerable public health importance because 
attention to the impacts of air quality may 
contribute to global TB control.
