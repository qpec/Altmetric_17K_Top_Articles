Neurologic signs and symptoms frequently
manifest in acute HIV infection
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the incidence, timing, and severity of neurologic findings in acute HIV
infection (pre–antibody seroconversion), as well as persistence with combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART).
Methods: Participants identified with acute HIV were enrolled, underwent structured neurologic
evaluations, immediately initiated cART, and were followed with neurologic evaluations at 4
and 12 weeks. Concurrent brain MRIs and both viral and inflammatory markers in plasma and
CSF were obtained.
Results: Median estimated HIV infection duration was 19 days (range 3–56) at study entry for the
139 participants evaluated. Seventy-three participants (53%) experienced one or more neuro-
logic findings in the 12 weeks after diagnosis, with one developing a fulminant neurologic man-
ifestation (Guillain-Barré syndrome). A total of 245 neurologic findings were noted, reflecting
cognitive symptoms (33%), motor findings (34%), and neuropathy (11%). Nearly half of the
neurologic findings (n 5 121, 49%) occurred at diagnosis, prior to cART initiation, and most of
these (n 5 110, 90%) remitted concurrent with 1 month on treatment. Only 9% of neurologic
findings (n 5 22) persisted at 24 weeks on cART. Nearly all neurologic findings (n 5 236, 96%)
were categorized as mild in severity. No structural neuroimaging abnormalities were observed.
Participants with neurologic findings had a higher mean plasma log10 HIV RNA at diagnosis
compared to those without neurologic findings (5.9 vs 5.4; p 5 0.006).
Conclusions: Acute HIV infection is commonly associated with mild neurologic findings that
largely remit while on treatment, and may be mediated by direct viral factors. Severe neurologic
manifestations are infrequent in treated acute HIV. Neurology® 2016;87:148–154

Although HIV can cross into the CNS within days of systemic infection,1 little is known about
the vulnerable neuroanatomy or neurologic presentation of acute HIV, the first days to weeks
after infection. Presently, the literature on the early neuroclinical events in HIV infection is
skewed towards instances of fulminant neurologic involvement. Cases of Bell palsy2,3 have been
reported, as well as the more serious sequelae of Guillain-Barré syndrome,4 optic neuritis,5
encephalitis,6,7 myelopathy,8 and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.9,10 While these neuro-
logic events likely occurred in the weeks and months following infection, it is unclear that these
represent the typical neurologic experience following HIV infection. A study of community-
identified individuals with primary HIV infection, generally defined as within the first year of

 exposure, examined the incidence of promi-
nent neurologic findings, and reported 12 of
290 cases (4.1%) experiencing any neurologic
presentation.11 Without systematic neurologic
assessments of participants from a known
catchment area, true frequency of neurologic
findings cannot be assessed, and the full spec-
trum of neurologic involvement in acute HIV
may be overlooked.
To better identify the neuroclinical events in
acute HIV infection, we prospectively charac-
terized the incidence, timing, and severity of
neurologic findings in individuals with a labora-
tory-screened diagnosis of acute HIV, using
structured neurologic evaluations across the
first 12 weeks following diagnosis and treat-
ment. Most participants were systematically
captured from individuals voluntary accessing
HIV testing, allowing for estimates of the inci-
dence of neurologic findings during acute HIV.
METHODS Participants. We included individuals diagnosed
with acute HIV infection from the Southeast Asia Research Col-
laboration with the University of Hawaii (SEARCH) 010/RV254
cohort in Bangkok, Thailand, described previously.12 Participants
electively sought testing at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous HIV
clinic in Bangkok, and were identified in acute HIV using hier-
archical algorithms from pooled nucleic acid and sequential
enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing. Exclusion criteria include
age ,18 years, positive urine pregnancy test, major medical or
psychiatric disorders, or chronic HIV. Of the 108,099 samples
screened for inclusion between May 14, 2009, and July 31, 2014,
236 cases of acute HIV infection (Fiebig I–V)13 were identified,
of which 189 entered the parent study and 134 had complete
neurologic data. We also enrolled 8 additional participants
screened through a separate study, the Early Capture HIV Cohort
Center in Pattaya, Thailand, where high-risk individuals were
tested for HIV every 3 days. Three of these participants were
excluded due to incomplete data. Estimated infection duration
was determined either by self-report of a single exposure date or,
for participants with multiple potential exposures, calculated as
a median of these dates. Plasma biomarkers of HIV infection were
obtained at study entry and participants were confirmed to be in
Fiebig stages I–V of acute HIV, per published guidelines.12 One
participant who enrolled in Fiebig V was later reclassified as
Fiebig VI due to subsequent narrowing of assay thresholds, and
was retained in the study.
At study entry, the presence of acute retroviral syndrome
(ARS) was determined by a HIV-trained physician using a stan-
dardized checklist of qualifying symptoms, requiring $3 to occur
in the timeframe of estimated infection and diagnosis. The pres-
ence of illicit drug use was assessed in a structured interview and
reflected any self-reported use within 4 months preceding diag-
nosis. Participants completed a validated Thai version of the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),14 with depres-
sion (HADS-D) or anxiety (HADS-A) determined by either bor-
derline abnormal (8–10) or abnormal (11–21) subscores, per the
original, validated ranges.15 To minimize the influence of other
study elements, the psychiatric self-assessments were completed
first, followed by medical and neurologic evaluations, blood col-
lection, neuropsychological testing, and then MRI and lumbar
puncture. After initial assessments, participants then started either
a combination antiretroviral therapy regimen (cART) composed
of efavirenz, tenofovir, and either emtricitabine or lamivudine, or
the cART regimen augmented with antiretrovirals maraviroc and
raltegravir (cART1),16 as part of the parent study. Following
HIV diagnosis, expedited evaluations were typically completed
within 48 hours, and 94% of participants initiated therapy within
3 days of identification (range 0–5 days; median 0 days).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. We received study approval from institutional review
boards at UCSF, Yale University, Chulalongkorn University, and
the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and all participants
provided written, informed consent for research.
Neurologic characterization. Structured neurologic interviews
and examinations that were based on the AIDS Clinical Trials
Group Macroneurological Examination17 were performed at
study entry by HIV-trained physicians (J.L.K.F., E.K., J.A.,
N.P.). These were repeated at 4 and 12 weeks after initiating
cART. Self-reported cognitive and neurologic symptoms were
assessed through standardized questions, with participants’
responses rated by degree of functional impairment. Findings in
neurologic
examinations
reflect
standardized
scoring;
for
example, finger taps were rated as normal if 15 or more were
completed in 5 seconds. A brief neuropsychological testing
battery was completed, comprising the Grooved Pegboard test
in nondominant hand (fine motor function), Color Trails 1
and Trail Making A (psychomotor speed), and Color Trails 2
(executive functioning/set-shifting), as previously reported.18 To
calculate an overall measure of cognitive function based on
a mean of z-scores (NPZ-4), raw neuropsychological testing
results were standardized to healthy Thai control data.19
Lumbar punctures were completed at study entry on 24% of
participants, with the lower limit of detection of CSF HIV
RNA of 100 copies/mL. T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid-
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI brain scans were
electively obtained at study entry on the same 1.5T GE
scanner, and were independently interpreted by 2 separate
neuroradiologists (S.L. and J.N.).
Analyses. Univariate analyses were reported as frequencies and
percents, and means were used for continuous data. Comparisons
between groups were performed using 2-tailed unpaired t tests for
continuous data, and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed for
ordinal data. x2 analyses were performed comparing proportions
between groups. Analyses were performed on Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA) and used p # 0.05 for statistical significance.
Effect sizes are reported as r2 for t tests and u for x2 tests.
RESULTS For the 197 individuals enrolled in the par-
ent cohort between May 14, 2009, and July 31, 2014,
we identified 139 with complete data. Of the 58
excluded participants, 1 left the study, 51 had incom-
plete neurologic examination data, and 7 were excluded
due to incomplete demographic information. No par-
ticipants were lost to follow-up. Excluded individuals
differed from study participants only by age (31 vs 28
years, p 5 0.01), but not other demographic factors.
Men comprised 93% of participants, and 98% of these
identified their risk for infection as having sex with
men. Three participants were transgender women.

For

Neurologic symptoms and examination findings. One or
more neurologic findings were reported or identified
in 73 of 139 participants (53%) within the first 12
weeks following acute HIV diagnosis, including one
individual with a fulminant neurologic presentation
of HIV, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (table 1).
Of the 245 individual neurologic findings identified
in 73 participants, 122 were neurologic or cognitive
symptoms
self-reported
during
the
structured
neurologic
interview,
and
123
were
objective
neurologic examination findings (table 2). Age, sex,
drug use, estimated infection duration, Fiebig stage,
and being on the augmented cART arm of the parent
protocol were not associated with overall presence or
absence of neurologic findings.
Cognitive complaints reflected 33% of neurologic
findings in acute HIV, including increased cognitive
effort, problems with memory, and difficulty concen-
trating. To explore the possible contribution of affec-
tive symptoms to self-reported cognitive symptoms,
we examined associations with available HADS com-
pleted at weeks 0, 4, and 12 (n 5 120). The presence
of any cognitive complaints within the first 12 weeks
after HIV diagnosis did not correlate with presence or
absence of abnormal depression on the HADS-D
(x2 5 0.9; p 5 0.35) in that time, although when
examining the HADS-D as a continuous variable, par-
ticipants reporting cognitive symptoms did have higher
average HADS-D scores (5.3 vs 3.9; p 5 0.01, r2 5
0.05). In contrast, cognitive complaints within the first
12 weeks following diagnosis did correlate with the
presence of abnormal anxiety on the HADS-A (x2 5
4.1; p 5 0.04, u 5 0.18) during that time, but those
with cognitive complaints had similar average HADS-
A scores (7.2 vs 6.2; p 5 0.09) compared to individuals
not reporting cognitive symptoms. To explore whether
any self-report of cognitive complaints coincided with
objective cognitive deficits, we examined participants
with neuropsychological testing data. When compar-
ing participants’ composite NPZ-4, those with any
cognitive complaints across the first 12 weeks of
HIV diagnosis had lower, thus more impaired, cogni-
tive functioning at week 0 (20.24 vs 0.06, p 5 0.01,
r2 5 0.05; n 5 38, n 5 79), week 12 (0.09 vs 0.52,
p 5 0.001, r2 5 0.13; n 5 23, n 5 58), and week 24
(0.001 vs 0.45, p 5 0.05, r2 5 0.06; n 5 23, n 5 52)
compared to participants without any cognitive
complaints.
Motor findings detected on the Unified Parkin-
son’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) elements in the
macroneurologic examination comprised 34% (n 5
82) of all neurologic findings, and primarily reflected
a slowing of fine finger and hand movements. No
instances of resting tremor, rigidity, or postural change
were observed. Over 11% (n 5 26) of all neurologic
findings in acute HIV were due to neuropathy, affect-
ing 17% of participants, and aside from the case of
GBS, all neuropathy was in a distal sensory pattern. To
examine whether injury from peripheral neuropathy
contributed to the observed motor slowing, we re-
viewed the 22 participants with any finger tap abnor-
malities across the first 12 weeks after diagnosis. Only
3 had any neuropathy in that time, and only 2 of these
had co-occurring neuropathy at visits where finger tap
abnormalities were found.
The individual who developed GBS had presumed
dengue fever over a month prior to HIV diagnosis,
and subsequently experienced a defined, HIV-
attributable antiretroviral syndrome. The participant
presented in acute HIV Fiebig III stage with a partic-
ularly low CD4 count of 7 cells/mm3 that increased
to 180 cells/mm3 after 4 weeks on the standard cART
regimen. The neurologic examination revealed no
deficits through the week 4 visit; however, 3 days
later, he developed reduced proximal arm strength.
Within 48 hours, there were ascending distal pares-
thesias, followed by diffuse areflexia and weakness in
the lower extremities. The participant was hospital-
ized and given a diagnosis of GBS, supported by nerve
conduction and CSF studies. He was treated with 2
mg/kg of IV immunoglobulins over 5 days. At most
extreme, the participant experienced facial diplegia
and profound limb weakness and sensory deficits.
After discharge, he progressively improved, with
return to normal function in 6 months. Fifteen
months after GBS diagnosis, he remained functionally

ished reflexes in the left leg, and mildly decreased vibra-
tory sense distally.
Timing of neurologic findings and change concurrent
with cART. Nearly half of all neurologic findings in
acute HIV occurred at the initial visit (49%; n 5
121), just prior to the initiation of cART. Concurrent
with 4 weeks on treatment, 90% (n 5 110) of the
neurologic findings that were present at diagnosis had
remitted. Participants on the augmented cART1 reg-
imen experienced a similar average number of neuro-
logic findings across the week 4 and 12 evaluations,
after therapy was started, compared to those on the
cART regimen (0.75 vs 0.98, p 5 0.36). Only 9%
(n 5 22) of all neurologic findings reported in the first
12 weeks remained at 24 weeks after diagnosis, and
these tended towards self-reported cognitive symptoms
(n 5 10), with the case of GBS accounting for 6 of 9
persisting neurologic examination abnormalities.

 Severity of neurologic findings. Almost all neurologic
findings in acute HIV infection were reported as slight
or mild in severity (96%; n 5 236), such as a dimin-
ished capacity for concentration without impacting
overall function. Of the 3% (n 5 8) of neurologic
findings reported as moderate in severity, 6 of 8 find-
ings were present at the week 0 visit, just prior to
initiation of cART, and 7 of 8 reflected motor findings
(e.g., incoordination, slowed movements, postural
instability). The only severe neurologic finding was
leg weakness in the patient with resolving GBS.
Comparison between participants with and without
neurologic findings. The 73 participants with at least
one neurologic finding in acute HIV were found to
have a higher average plasma viral load (log10 HIV
RNA) at diagnosis compared to the 66 participants
without neurologic findings (5.9 vs 5.4; p 5 0.006,
r2 5 0.05). There were no differences in their initial
clinical severity of HIV, as reflected by average number
of ARS symptoms (5.9 vs 4.9, p 5 0.09; n 5 138). No
differences were found between participants with and
without neurologic findings in terms of CSF log10
HIV RNA (3.7 vs 3.1, p 5 0.14; n 5 32); plasma
CD4 (339 vs 381 cells/mm3, p 5 0.46; n 5 139);
plasma neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation
(2,307 vs 2,193 pg/mL, p 5 0.69; n 5 55); or CSF
neopterin (1,948 vs 1,986 pg/mL, p 5 0.67; n 5 26).
Six participants were found to have CSF HIV
RNA below detection limits of our assay at the time
of presentation, 2 of whom had no neurologic find-
ings. However, 4 individuals with undetectable CSF
HIV RNA had a total of 5 neurologic findings possi-
bly attributable to CNS anatomy, including increased
cognitive
effort,
difficulty
with
concentration,
decreased facial expression, postural instability, and
upper extremity incoordination.
We did not identify T1-weighted or T2 FLAIR
abnormalities among the 62 participants with MRI
scans at diagnosis, which included 35 individuals with
neurologic findings. Five individuals had mild white
matter hyperintensities (figure).
DISCUSSION This study identifies that mild neuro-
logic findings are common in the months following
acute HIV diagnosis when antiretroviral therapy is
promptly initiated, with mild cognitive complaints,
motor findings, and neuropathy occurring most fre-
quently. With rapid treatment, only rare fulminant
neurologic involvement was observed in this sample.
Cognitive complaints were frequent in acute HIV,
and the presence of cognitive complaints correlated
with the presence of abnormal anxiety on the
HADS-A. Although several studies have found no
group deficits on neuropsychological testing in early
or acute HIV,18,20 we found that the subset of patients
with acute HIV with initial cognitive complaints had
lower neuropsychological test z scores across the first
6 months following diagnosis. These scores fell within
a normal range for both groups, and all clinical
changes were small. The measurably lower perfor-
mance in those with cognitive complaints may
instead have mechanistic relevance, reflecting an ini-
tial process whereby HIV impacts brain functioning.
These findings were observed in participants in acute
HIV with early treatment intervention, and it is
unknown whether a common underlying mechanism
could cause progressive neuropsychological decline in
those without rapid treatment.
The UPDRS portion of a standard HIV neuro-
logic examination identified a mild bradykinesia
occurring in acute HIV, and may imply a selective
vulnerability in extrapyramidal neuroanatomy early
in infection. While fulminant parkinsonism is a rare
presentation of primary HIV,21 magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) data implicate an anatomical
basis for extrapyramidal involvement in acute HIV
infection, with a trend towards elevated markers of
inflammation (e.g., choline/creatinine) in the basal
ganglia compared to controls.1 However, this macro-
neurologic examination was not designed for acute
HIV, instead aiming to capture UPDRS components
of parkinsonism described in chronic HIV,17,22 and
the mild upper extremity bradykinesia may reflect
neural network dysfunction elsewhere in the motor
system.23 Other possible localizations include inflam-
mation in frontal white matter, which has been
observed in acute HIV infection through MRS
myo-inositol/creatinine ratio elevations.1

 While neuropathy was reported or observed in
17% of our acute HIV participants, another study
in untreated primary HIV infection reported neurop-
athy occurring in as many as 35% of individuals.24 In
that study, neuropathy was found to correlate with
CSF and plasma markers of immune activation, rais-
ing the possibility that immediate treatment may
reduce adverse neurologic outcomes.
We identified that higher plasma HIV RNA level
at diagnosis was associated with having one or more
neurologic findings, supporting a relationship with
systemic disease severity and neurologic outcomes.
However, these participants experienced a similar
clinical severity in terms of number of ARS symp-
toms, and no differences in plasma or CSF markers
of macrophage activation, although the assessments
of CSF markers were limited by sample size. A sepa-
rate study in primary HIV observed that CSF HIV
RNA, as opposed to plasma HIV RNA, was elevated
in those with neurologic symptoms compared to
those without.25 In that study, participants had no
systematic neurologic evaluation, and had a high rate
of severe sequelae requiring hospitalization.
Neurologic findings in acute HIV may not require
direct CNS viral involvement, as 4 of our participants
experienced
CNS-referable
neurologic
findings
despite undetectable CSF HIV RNA at diagnosis. It
is possible that our participants have a discrepancy
in the presence of HIV RNA in the CSF vs that in
the brain parenchyma, an inherent sampling limita-
tion when CSF is used to infer brain involvement.
Similar incongruity has been described in macaque
models of early HIV.26 However, the presence of
CNS-referable symptoms in participants without
detectable CSF HIV RNA may imply an indirect role
of systemic immune activation or inflammation,
although we did not observe group differences in
a plasma marker of macrophage activation. A study
in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease of immune
activation without CNS antibody expression, similarly
found cognitive deficits compared to controls that were
unrelated to the participant’s mood or medication.27
Relatedly, the observed case of GBS may not have been
caused by direct HIV-related factors, but instead by
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, as has
been reported in primary HIV.28
All participants received cART upon study entry;
thus our study lacks the untreated arm needed to
demonstrate how early cART intervention influences
the trajectory of neurologic findings in acute HIV.
Consequently, we report only concurrent changes
without attributing causality. Additionally, the lack
of comparative neurologic findings in uninfected con-
trol participants limits the ability to determine what is
driven by HIV infection, vs baseline incidence in this
population. The decreased frequency of findings
concurrent with cART initiation supports the notion
that these findings are related to HIV infection. It is
also possible that the early cluster of findings at diagno-
sis instead resulted from a natural virologic progression
of HIV infection, and is independent of treatment.
Interestingly, while early treatment is presumed to be
neuroprotective, a study of patients with primary
HIV showed compromised microstructural and mac-
romolecular neuroimaging changes in the anterior cor-
pus callosum, as well as increased CSF percent, in those
starting treatment in the first year compared to
untreated controls also in primary HIV.29
There was illicit drug use in this population, possi-
bly confounding our neurologic findings, although the
pattern of use was principally sporadic amyl nitrite use
(poppers) during sexual encounters.30 Given the
homogeneity of participants in terms of HIV-1 clade
CRF01-AE, our findings may not generalize to other
clades. Additional study limitations include the
restricted demographics of the participants.
Individuals diagnosed and treated during acute
HIV infection commonly have mild neurologic find-
ings, but a low frequency of fulminant neurologic is-
sues, in the first 3 months after diagnosis. The mild
neurologic findings include cognitive complaints,
motor findings, and neuropathy, and tend to remit
concurrent with treatment.
