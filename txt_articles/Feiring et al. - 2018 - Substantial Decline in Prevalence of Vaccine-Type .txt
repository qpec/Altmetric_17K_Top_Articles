Background. In 2009, quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was introduced in a school-based single-cohort pro-
gram targeting 12-year-old girls in Norway. We estimated the impact of the Norwegian HPV immunization program.
Methods. Three birth cohorts of 17-year-old girls, 2 nonvaccine-eligible cohorts (born 1994 or 1996) and 1 vaccine-eligible 
cohort (born 1997) were invited to deliver urine samples. The samples were analyzed for 37 HPV genotypes. HPV prevalence was 
compared between birth cohorts and between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls within and across birth cohorts after linkage to the 
Norwegian Immunisation Registry.
Results. In total, 17 749 urine samples were analyzed. A 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%–47%) reduction in any HPV 
type and 81% (95% CI, 76%–85%) reduction in vaccine types (HPV-6/11/16/18) were observed in the vaccine-eligible cohort com-
pared to the 1994 cohort. Vaccine types were reduced by 54% (95% CI, 39%–66%) and 90% (95% CI, 86%–92%) in unvaccinated and 
vaccinated girls, respectively, from the 1997 cohort, compared with unvaccinated girls born in 1994. A significant reduction was also 
observed for several nonvaccine types. Vaccine-type prevalence was reduced by 77% (95% CI, 65%–85%) in vaccinated compared 
with unvaccinated girls from the 1997 cohort.
Conclusions. In this largely HPV-naive population, we observed a substantial reduction in vaccine and nonvaccine types in 
vaccinated and unvaccinated girls following introduction of HPV vaccination.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most com-
mon sexually transmitted infection. Based on the oncogenic 
potential, HPV genotypes are classified as high-risk (HR), 
probably/possibly HR, or undetermined or low-risk (LR) 
types [1]. HPV infection is the underlying cause of cervical 
and other anogenital cancers, as well as cancers in the oro-
pharynx [1, 2]. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are responsible for 70% 
of all cases of cervical cancer, whereas HPV-6 and HPV-11 
cause 90% of genital warts [2].
In Norway, the HPV vaccine has been offered in a school-
based immunization program with single-cohort delivery to 
12-year-old girls since 2009. In contrast to most Western coun-
tries, no catch-up vaccination of older girls was initially offered.
Since the HPV vaccine was first introduced in national pro-
grams in 2007, several studies have described real-life effec-
tiveness including reduction of precancerous cervical lesions 
among vaccinated women [3–7]. In addition to the direct effect 
against vaccine types, the population-level effectiveness will 
depend on cross-protection against nonvaccine types as well as 
the extent of herd protection achieved in a given setting. To our 
knowledge, previous effectiveness studies have only been per-
formed in countries with catch-up vaccination. HPV vaccines 
are prophylactic and do not clear ongoing infections. In clinical 
trials in women aged 16–26 years, the efficacy of HPV vaccines 
is higher in HPV-naive populations than in total vaccinated 
cohorts, reflecting the lack of protection against ongoing HPV 
infections [8, 9]. Thus, protection is likely to be less effective in 
older catch-up populations, in comparison to young and mostly

 Early Impact of HPV Vaccine in Norway • JID 2018:218 (15 December) • 1901
HPV-naive populations. Effectiveness data from school-based 
programs in countries with single-cohort delivery only have not 
been reported.
Three HPV vaccines including antigens from 2, 4, or 9 HPV 
types are currently licensed. The quadrivalent vaccine, includ-
ing antigens against HPV-6/11/16/18, was used in Norway until 
2017. The HPV vaccine uptake increased from 70% in the first 
birth cohort that was eligible for HPV vaccination (born in 
1997) [10] to 89% among girls born in 2004 [11].
In Norway, organized cervical screening is not offered until 
the age of 25. Thus, screening data are not suitable to assess early 
vaccine impact. Consequently, a national HPV surveillance 
program comprising a series of nationwide, population-based 
cross-sectional studies was set up, assessing HPV prevalence in 
urine samples from girls and young women not yet targeted by 
the national screening program [12].
The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of 
the Norwegian school-based HPV immunization program, 
by comparing the HPV prevalence in urine samples from 
17-year-old girls in 3 birth cohorts: the first vaccine-eligible 
cohort and 2 birth cohorts not eligible for routine HPV vac-
cination. We studied the direct effect in vaccinated individu-
als and the potential herd effect in nonvaccinated individuals. 
Furthermore, the cross-protective effect against nonvaccine 
types and possible type replacement were assessed. Finally, the 
total effectiveness of the program (direct plus indirect effects) 
was estimated.
METHODS
Inclusion and Sampling
Girls from 3 birth cohorts (1994, 1996, and 1997) were eligi-
ble for inclusion. Girls born in 1994 (baseline cohort) and 1996 
were not eligible for HPV vaccination. Girls born in 1997 (vac-
cine cohort) were the first birth cohort eligible for HPV vacci-
nation. The Norwegian Central Population Registry was used to 
obtain information on all girls in the 3 birth cohorts residing in 
Norway as of 1 February the year they turned 17 (2011, 2013, 
and 2014 for girls born in 1994, 1996, and 1997, respectively). 
Girls were invited by mail around their 17th birthday. Due to an 
administrative error, 5260 girls born in November/December 
1994 were not invited. In total, 25 811 girls born in 1994, 31 749 
girls born in 1996, and 31 389 girls born in 1997 were invited.
Upon informed consent, girls received a urine sampling 
kit and were asked to return a first-void urine sample to the 
Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The sample device con-
tained boric acid to prevent bacterial growth. All samples were 
registered, aliquoted, and stored at –80°C prior to analysis at the 
Norwegian HPV Reference Laboratory at Akershus University 
Hospital. Participants received 2 cinema tickets as compensa-
tion. All samples received by 26 November 2014 were analyzed 
for HPV by 19 August 2015 and have been included in the sta-
tistical analyses.
The study was approved by the Regional Committee for 
Medical and Health Research Ethics, South East Norway and 
the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.
HPV Vaccination
Individual records on HPV vaccination were retrieved from the 
Norwegian Immunisation Registry. Notification of all vaccina-
tions provided through the national childhood immunization 
program is mandatory without the need for consent [13]. HPV 
vaccinations provided outside the immunization program are 
notifiable, but the vaccinees or their parents/guardians may 
oppose notification. Thus, vaccination outside the program 
may be subject to some underreporting. However, the effect on 
our results is most likely negligible as only a total of 1000–2000 
girls/women per year were prescribed HPV vaccine outside the 
immunization program from 2007 to 2014 [14].
Vaccine doses administered <15 days prior to urine sampling 
were unlikely to have a clinical impact and were not taken into 
account.
When comparing invited and participating girls, vaccine 
uptake was calculated as of 1 January the year of urine sampling 
for the respective birth cohorts.
Girls who had not received any doses of HPV vaccine were 
defined as unvaccinated, whereas girls who had received all 3 
doses were defined as vaccinated. Partially vaccinated girls were 
excluded from analysis.
HPV Testing
DNA extraction and HPV genotyping were performed at the 
Norwegian HPV Reference Laboratory as previously described 
[12]. In brief, the presence of HPV DNA was investigated 
using a modified GP5+/GP6+ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
protocol [15], followed by Luminex-based genotype detec-
tion [16]. Sample adequacy was evaluated through a β-globin 
PCR assay. The assay detects 37 genotypes: 12 HR HPV types 
(HPV types 16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59), 1 prob-
ably HR type (HPV-68), 9 possibly HR types (HPV types 
26/30/53/66/67/69/70/73/82), and 15 LR types (HPV types 
6/11/40/42/43/54/61/74/81/83/86/87/89/90/91) [1]. The sam-
ples were analyzed consecutively with overlaps between birth 
cohorts, according to the same genotyping protocol.
The HPV prevalence data was linked to data from the Central 
Population Registry and to the immunization records, using the 
unique personal identifier allocated to all Norwegian citizens.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the prevalence with corresponding 95% Wilson 
score confidence intervals (CIs) [17] for each individual HPV 
type and for the following combinations: “any HPV type,” 
“any HR type,” “any probably/possibly HR type,” “any LR 
type,” “vaccine types (HPV-6/11/16/18),” “HPV-16/18,” “HPV-
6/11,” “any nonvaccine HR type,” “any HR type other than 
HPV-16/18/31/33/45,” “HPV-31/33/45 (HR types for which

cross-protection has been suggested),” “HPV-31/33/45/52/58 
(additional HR types in the nonavalent vaccine),” “HPV-
6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58” (nonavalent vaccine types), as well 
as for multiple HPV infection.
To compare HPV prevalence between groups, we calculated 
relative risks (RRs) with 95% Koopman CIs [18]. Girls born 
in 1996 and girls born in 1997 were compared to girls born 
in 1994 (baseline cohort). Girls born in 1997 were also com-
pared to girls born in 1996. To estimate total effectiveness of 
the HPV immunization program (direct effect plus herd effect), 
we compared vaccinated girls born in 1997 (vaccine cohort) to 
unvaccinated girls in the baseline cohort [19]. To estimate herd 
effect, we compared unvaccinated girls in the vaccine cohort to 
unvaccinated girls in the baseline cohort. Finally, we compared 
vaccinated and unvaccinated girls within the vaccine cohort. 
Adjusting for region of residence using log-binomial regression 
did not change the estimates and is not included in the results 
section.
All tests were 2-sided, and P values <.05 were considered sta-
tistically significant. The data were analyzed with Stata/SE 15.0 
(StataCorp) software.
RESULTS
Approximately 20% of the invited girls participated by deliv-
ering a urine sample (Table 1). We observed small differences 
in participation rates between the northern, middle, western, 
southern, eastern, and capital regions of Norway, ranging from 
19.8% to 23.1% for the 1994 cohort, from 17.0% to 20.0% for the 
1996 cohort, and from 21.7% to 24.5% for the 1997 cohort. In 
total, 17 749 urine samples were analyzed.
Vaccine uptake was higher in participating than in all invited 
girls (Table 1). Among participating girls born in 1994, 1996, 
and 1997, 1.7%, 3.8%, and 77.0%, respectively, had received 3 
doses of HPV vaccine. The mean age at first dose was higher in 
the 1994 and 1996 cohorts than in the 1997 cohort, but similar 
among invited and participating girls within each cohort (15.1, 
14.6, and 12.5 years, respectively).
At the cohort level, the prevalence of any HPV type declined 
from 19.9% (95% CI, 18.8%–21.0%) in the baseline cohort to 
11.5% (95% CI, 10.8%–12.3%) in the vaccine cohort (RR, 0.58 
[95% CI, .53–.63]), corresponding to an overall reduction, irre-
spective of HPV type, of 42% (95% CI, 37%–47%) (Table 2). 
The prevalence of vaccine types declined from 7.4% (95% CI, 
6.7%–8.1%) in the baseline cohort to 1.4% (95% CI, 1.1%–1.7%) 
in the vaccine cohort (RR, 0.19 [95% CI, .15–.24]), correspond-
ing to a reduction of 81% (95% CI, 76%–85%). Furthermore, 
significant reductions were observed for combinations of non-
vaccine types as well as for several single nonvaccine types, 
including LR types, probably/possibly HR types, and the HR 
types HPV-31, -33, -39, -45, -51, -52, and -59 (Table 2, Figure 1,

and Supplementary Table 1). Estimates for all of the single HPV 
types according to their classification in species are presented in 
Supplementary Table 1. The proportion of HPV-positive girls 
with >1 HPV type declined from 46.4% (95% CI, 43.4%–49.3%) 
in the baseline cohort to 32.2% (95% CI, 28.9%–35.7%) in the 
vaccine cohort.
A significant reduction in prevalence of any HPV type as 
compared to the baseline cohort was also observed in the 1996 
cohort (RR, 0.78 [95% CI, .72–.84]; Table 2). The prevalence of 
vaccine types was also significantly reduced (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 
.56–.76]). Several nonvaccine-type combinations were also sig-
nificantly reduced.
When comparing the vaccine cohort to the 1996 cohort, we 
observed a significant decline in the prevalence of any HPV 
type, vaccine types, and several nonvaccine type combina-
tions, as well as some single nonvaccine types (Supplementary 
Table 2).
Compared to unvaccinated girls in the baseline cohort, 
the prevalence of any HPV type was significantly reduced in 
both unvaccinated and vaccinated girls in the vaccine cohort 
(RR, 0.54 [95% CI, .46–.63] and 0.59 [95% CI, .54–.65], respec-
tively; Table 3). For vaccine types, the prevalence declined from 
7.7% (95% CI, 7.0%–8.4%) in unvaccinated girls in the baseline 
cohort to 3.5% (95% CI, 2.6%–4.6%) in unvaccinated girls and 
to 0.8% (95% CI, 0.6%–1.1%) in vaccinated girls born in 1997. 
This corresponds to a reduction of 54% (95% CI, 39%–66%) in 
unvaccinated and 90% (95% CI, 86%–92%) in vaccinated girls 
born in 1997. Among vaccinated girls born in 1997, significant

reductions in prevalence were also observed for several single 
nonvaccine types, including LR types, probably/possibly HR 
types, and the HR types 31, 33, 39, 45, 51, 52, and 59 (Figure 2). 
The reduction of HPV-31/33/45 combined was 68% (95% CI, 
54%–77%). The reduction of nonavalent vaccine types was 76% 
(95% CI, 71%–80%). Significant reductions in the prevalence 
of several single nonvaccine types and combinations were also 
observed among unvaccinated girls born in 1997.
We observed no difference in the prevalence of any HPV type 
between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls within the vaccine 
cohort (RR, 1.09 [95% CI, .92–1.30]), but found a significantly 
lower prevalence of vaccine types in vaccinated girls (RR, 0.23 [95% 
CI, .15–.35]) (Table 4). A significantly higher combined prevalence 
of any nonvaccine HR types was seen in vaccinated as compared 
to unvaccinated girls born in 1997 (RR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.02–1.97]).
In a supplementary analysis among unvaccinated girls 
only, we observed a significant reduction in the prevalence of 
any HPV type in the 1996 cohort compared with the baseline 
cohort and a further reduction in the vaccine cohort (RR, 0.79 
[95% CI, .73–.86] and 0.54 [95% CI, .46–.63], respectively; 
Supplementary Table 3). Similar patterns were observed for 
vaccine types and several nonvaccine-type combinations.
DISCUSSION
In this large, population-based, cross-sectional study, we found 
a significant reduction in HPV prevalence after introduction of 
the HPV vaccine in Norway. The overall reduction of any HPV 
type was 42%, and the reduction in vaccine types was 81% in 
the vaccine cohort, as compared to the baseline cohort. The 
total effectiveness of the HPV immunization program against 
vaccine types was 90%. A reduction in several nonvaccine types 
was also observed. The reduction of HPV-31/33/45 combined 
was 68%. Within the vaccine cohort, the prevalence of vaccine 
types was reduced by 77% in vaccinated as compared to unvac-
cinated girls. Significant reductions in vaccine types and several 
nonvaccine types were also observed in unvaccinated girls born 
in 1997, indicating herd effect.
A major strength of the current study is the large sample size 
and the population-based design. The study is one of the largest 
of its kind, with 17 749 samples tested for 37 HPV genotypes. 
The vaccine impact was assessed at age 17 years, 5 years after 
vaccination. In studies in cervical screening populations, vac-
cine impact is generally measured at a higher age.
Individual records from the Norwegian Immunisation 
Registry enabled linkage of HPV prevalence data to individ-
ual HPV vaccination status. Notification to the Norwegian 
Immunisation Registry is mandatory, and information from the 
electronic patient record systems is transferred electronically to 
the immunization registry [13]. Thus, registration is considered 
nearly complete.
Another strength is the high uptake of HPV vaccine in 12- 
to 13-year-old girls, in general not yet sexually active, and thus

probably HPV naive. The mean age at first vaccine dose was 
12.5 years. In a recent study from Norway, only 3% of students 
in upper secondary school reported to have had sexual inter-
course before the age of 14 [20]. No catch-up vaccination was 
offered in Norway until 2016, and vaccine uptake was low in 
age cohorts not eligible for routine HPV vaccination. Thus, the 
presented results are likely to reflect the effectiveness of the vac-
cination program in a largely HPV-naive population.
Urine sampling is noninvasive and reported to be preferred 
over self-collecting cervicovaginal swabs [21, 22]. In young 
prescreening populations, as in our study, urine sampling may 
provide higher response rates than self-collected genital swabs, 
as demonstrated in nonattenders to cervical screening at age 
21 [23]. The HPV prevalence may be lower in urine samples 
than in cervical samples [24–26]. However, several studies have 
found a good agreement between HPV detected in urine and 
cervical samples, and urine sampling has been suggested as an 
adequate alternative to monitor the impact of HPV immuniza-
tion programs or to increase uptake in screening [22, 25–28].
The response rate in our study was quite low, although higher 
than reported from similar studies in the same age group [29–
31]. The low response rate may have caused selection bias. We 
have no information on sexual history or socioeconomic fac-
tors, and participating and nonparticipating girls may differ 
in these respects. We would, however, expect any association 
between these factors and the willingness to participate to be

 Early Impact of HPV Vaccine in Norway • JID 2018:218 (15 December) • 1907
similar across the invited birth cohorts. The recruitment proce-
dure was identical for all birth cohorts. The median age at first 
in Norway, intercourse has been stable in the period 2002–2017 
 
[20, 32, 33]. Thus, we believe that the comparisons between 
birth cohorts are valid.
The HPV vaccine uptake was higher in participants than in 
nonparticipants. However, in several previous studies, includ-
ing one with Norwegian data, no association between HPV 
vaccination and sexual behavior was seen [30, 34–37]. The vast 
majority of HPV-vaccinated girls in our study were vaccinated 
before becoming sexually active, further reducing the proba-
bility of an association between HPV vaccination and sexual 
behavior. Nevertheless, due to possible selection bias, we can-
not rule out the possibility that unvaccinated and vaccinated 
participants in our study differ with regard to sexual behavior. 
If non–sexually active unvaccinated girls were more willing to 
participate than sexually active unvaccinated girls, the mea-
sured HPV prevalence in unvaccinated girls would be lower 
than in the total unvaccinated population of girls born in 1997. 
This could partly explain the slightly higher prevalence of non-
vaccine types observed in vaccinated as compared to unvacci-
nated girls born in 1997. Given such selection bias, the vaccine 
effectiveness would be underestimated, whereas the herd effect 
would be overestimated.
Samples from the baseline cohort were collected in 2011, 
2 years into the HPV immunization program. The girls in the 
first vaccine-eligible birth cohort were only 14 years old in 2011. 
We therefore believe the herd effect in the 3-years-older unvac-
cinated baseline cohort to be minimal.
The HPV prevalence in the 2 nonvaccine-eligible cohorts is 
comparable to findings in urine samples from 15- to 18-year-old 
girls in Scotland, prior to HPV vaccine introduction [29]. Other 
population-based studies in similar age groups have reported 
somewhat higher prevalence of any HPV type, but lower preva-
lence of vaccine types in self-collected cervical samples [30, 38].
We observed a substantial reduction in HPV vaccine types, 
consistent with reports from other countries [3, 4, 6, 39–41]. 
Moreover, in line with previous studies [3, 4, 6], we found a 
strong herd effect in unvaccinated girls.
Previous meta-analyses, including data on both quadriva-
lent and bivalent vaccine, have found evidence of cross-pro-
tection against HPV-31 or the combination HPV-31/33/45 
 
[3, 5], whereas a slight increase in HPV-39 and -52 was found 
in one meta-analysis [5]. Cross-protection against HPV-
31, -33, -35, -45, and -52 has been reported for the bivalent 
vaccine [6, 41]. We observed significant reduction in several 
single nonvaccine types, including LR types, probably/possi-
bly HR types, and the HR types HPV-31, -33, -39, -45, -51, 
-52, and -59, both when comparing the vaccine cohort to the 
baseline cohort and when comparing vaccinated girls in the 
1997 cohort to unvaccinated girls in the baseline cohort. The 
observed reduction of nonvaccine types may be due to changes 
in sexual behavior, natural variation, cross-protection, or 
unknown causes. There is no indication of a change in sexual 
behavior in Norway during recent years [20, 32, 33]. Natural 
variation may explain some of the decline in HPV types where 
cross-protection has previously not been suggested. However, 
natural variation alone seems unlikely to have caused such 
a large reduction, in particular for vaccine types and known 
cross-protective types. Alternatively, the reduction of non-
vaccine types could be linked to the absence of HPV-16/18, 
which is known to impair the immune response in the cervix, 
in particular through depletion of Langerhans cells [42, 43]. 
The reduction could also be attributable to vaccine-induced 
cross-reactivity of CD4 T-helper cells, as suggested in an ear-
lier study [44]. They observed a significant reduction in HPV-
6, -11, and -74 in HPV-naive girls and women vaccinated 
with bivalent vaccine, not targeting HPV-6/11. Although 
a higher level of cell-mediated immune response has been 
found for the bivalent AS04 adjuvanted vaccine than for the 
quadrivalent vaccine [45], our findings may suggest a role for 
cross-protective cellular immunity in naive cohorts vaccinated 
with non-AS04 adjuvanted vaccines.
Interestingly, we also observed a significant reduction in sev-
eral single nonvaccine types in unvaccinated girls in the vaccine 
cohort, suggesting a possible cross-protective herd effect, also 
reported for the bivalent vaccine [6].
As previously reported, we also observed a significant reduc-
tion in HPV prevalence in the 1996 cohort [12]. Given the large 
herd protection in unvaccinated girls, it seems likely that the 
reduction in HPV prevalence in the 1996 cohort, at least par-
tially, is caused by herd effect, and not entirely by natural fluc-
tuation in the occurrence of HPV. Girls born in 1996 are only 
1 year older than the first vaccine-eligible cohort, and urine 
samples were collected in 2013, 4 years into the vaccination 
program.
We observed no indication of type replacement after the 
introduction of the HPV immunization program in Norway, in 
line with recent findings from Scotland [6]. This must, however, 
be followed closely over the coming years as more birth cohorts 
enter the program.
Although the prevalence of vaccine types was lower among vac-
cinated than unvaccinated girls within the 1997 cohort, no differ-
ence in prevalence of any HPV type was observed, as previously 
reported [31, 40]. A slightly higher prevalence of some nonvaccine 
types was observed in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated 
girls in the 1997 cohort. However, in both groups the prevalence 
was significantly lower than in unvaccinated girls in the baseline 
cohort. Similar findings were recently reported in Australia [40]. 
This may be explained by unmasking of nonvaccine types due 
to lack of primer competition in the PCR assay in the absence of 
HPV-16/18 in samples from vaccinated girls [40, 46].
The prevalence of multiple infections was high, consistent 
with findings from other studies [47, 48], but declined following

vaccination. The interplay between multiple HPV infections 
and changes in HPV prevalence following introduction of HPV 
vaccination programs warrants further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
Single-cohort delivery of HPV vaccine to 12- to 13-year-old 
girls was associated with a reduction in vaccine types of 90% 
in vaccinated and 54% in unvaccinated girls in the first vac-
cine-eligible cohort 5 years after vaccination. A substantial 
reduction in nonvaccine types was observed in both vacci-
nated and unvaccinated girls, suggesting cross-protection and 
herd effect. No indication of type replacement was observed. 
The early impact of the HPV immunization program in this 
largely HPV-naive Norwegian population seems more ben-
eficial than anticipated upon introduction of the vaccine in 
2009, but more effectiveness studies in HPV-naive popula-
tions are needed to confirm the findings. With the growing 
amount of evidence for sustained long-term protection of 
HPV vaccine [49, 50], we feel optimistic that the observed 
reduction in HPV prevalence in urine samples may translate 
into a future decline in the incidence of precancerous lesions 
and cervical cancer in Norway.
