Colorectal cancer (CRC) displays a complex pattern of inheritance. It is postulated that much
of the missing heritability of CRC is enshrined in high-impact rare alleles, which are
mechanistically and clinically important. In this study, we assay the impact of rare germline
mutations on CRC, analysing high-coverage exome sequencing data on 1,006 early-onset
familial CRC cases and 1,609 healthy controls, with additional sequencing and array data on
up to 5,552 cases and 6,792 controls. We identify highly penetrant rare mutations in 16% of
familial CRC. Although the majority of these reside in known genes, we identify POT1, POLE2
and MRE11 as candidate CRC genes. We did not identify any coding low-frequency alleles
(1–5%) with moderate effect. Our study clarifies the genetic architecture of CRC and
probably discounts the existence of further major high-penetrance susceptibility genes, which
individually account for 41% of the familial risk. Our results inform future study design and
provide a resource for contextualizing the impact of new CRC genes.

 C
olorectal cancer (CRC), a major cause of cancer-related
mortality, displays a complex pattern of inheritance.
The genetic architecture of CRC susceptibility encom-
passes a broad spectrum of risk, from rare, highly penetrant
germline mutations associated with well-characterized syndromes
to common polymorphisms, each individually conferring small
risks. However, much of the familial risk remains unexplained but
is widely postulated to be enshrined in unidentified, rare, high-
impact variants. This class of susceptibility is mechanistically
important and highly relevant to the clinical management of both
familial
and
sporadic
CRC1.
Our
recent
application
of
next-generation
sequencing
to
familial
cases
led
to
the
discovery of mutations in POLE and POLD1 that predispose
to CRC, thus providing evidence for the existence of hitherto-
unidentified,
rare,
high/moderate-penetrance
susceptibility
alleles2. We therefore implemented whole-exome sequencing
(WES) to quantify the contribution of rare disruptive variants to
the heritable risk of CRC and identify new susceptibility genes.
The high baseline rate of rare, neutral germline variants makes
the identification of rare CRC predisposition alleles problematic.
We therefore designed a study for the extreme phenotype of
early-onset CRC, as heritability is substantially greater when
diagnosed young and/or is familial. In 2007, we established the
UK National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics (NSCCG) as a
bio-repository for studying susceptibility to CRC3. From 23,693
CRC cases (diagnosed o70 years) with European Ancestry
recruited between 2007 and 2013, we identified 1,143 with
early-onset CRC (r55 years) documented to have at least one
first-degree
relative
with
CRC,
a
highly
enriched
subset
representing o2% of all CRC. One thousand and twenty-eight
of the 1,143 Discovery series of cases were subjected to WES. For
comparison, we analysed WES data on 1,644 UK population
controls from the 1958 Birth Cohort (1958BC) with no history of
malignancy. We identify high-penetrant rare mutations in 16% of
familial CRC. Although the majority of these reside in known
genes, we identify POT1, POLE2 and MRE11 as candidate
CRC genes. Our study clarifies the genetic architecture of CRC
and
probably
discounts
the
existence
of
further
major
high-penetrance susceptibility genes.
Results
Whole-exome sequencing. Cases and controls were sequenced
using Illumina TruSeq exon capture and Hi-Seq 2000 technology
(Fig.1 and Methods). To avoid erroneous findings, we performed
alignment and variant calling of all samples simultaneously
(Methods). We excluded 57 subjects with low-quality data or
non-European ancestry (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Each
captured base was sequenced to an average depth of 48 � across
samples; cases and controls had similar sequencing metrics
(Supplementary Table 1). We estimated sensitivity and specificity
of calls using a subset of 1,332 samples, which had been
genotyped using Illumina HumanExome-12v1_A Beadchips,
identifying high levels of concordance (Methods). The final data
set comprised 1,006 Discovery cases and 1,609 controls (Fig.1 and
Supplementary Fig.1) for which the characteristics are detailed in
Supplementary Table 2.
Analysis of recurrent variants. We first examined individual,
moderately
low-frequency
coding
variants
(minor
allele
frequency (MAF) 1–5%) for an association with CRC risk.
No signal deviated from that expected by chance. To maximize
the detection of a statistically significant association, we per-
formed a meta-analysis of our Discovery series with Illumina
HumanExome-12v1_A Beadchip genotypes on an additional
series of 5,552 cases and 6,792 controls (Fig.1 and Methods).
Meta-analyses
did
not
identify
a
statistically
significant
association for any single variant (that is, P44.0 � 10 � 7).
Gene-based analysis of rare variants. We next examined the
impact of rare alleles (MAFo1%) collectively within a gene on
CRC risk by aggregating single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
indels (‘T1’ test) in each gene and comparing the counts between
cases and controls (Methods). Empirical P-values were obtained
using permutation. Acknowledging the limitations of in-silico
prediction to enrich for harmful alleles, we considered three sets
of variants: Class 1, disruptive mutations (nonsense and frame-
shift); Class 2, predicted damaging (disruptive plus missense
predicted to be damaging and splice donor/acceptor-site): and
Class 3, all non-synonymous changes. To account for multiple
testing we set the threshold for exome-wide significance at
P ¼ 8.0 � 10 � 7 (Bonferroni correction for 20,000 genes and 3
classes of variants).

Figure 1 | Study design to investigate the contribution of rare disruptive
mutations to the heritable risk of CRC. WES was performed on a highly
enriched subset of CRC patients recruited to the NSCCG and a series of UK
population controls from the 1958 Birth Cohort. After QC, this Discovery
set comprised 1,006 early-onset (diagnosed r55 years) familial cases
(Z1 first-degree relative with CRC) and 1,609 controls. To test the
hypothesis that low-frequency variants confer risk for CRC, we performed a
meta-analysis alongside 12,344 UK samples genotyped on the Illumina
HumanExome-12v1_A Beadchip. To test the hypothesis that a burden of rare
mutations in a gene confers risk for CRC, we performed a burden test on
rare (o1% frequency) coding variants and subsequent meta-analysis
alongside additional sequencing data from 3,770 UK samples (WGSET).
Finally, we performed GSEA to investigate whether the burden of rare
variants are overrepresented in a specific biological pathway.

 Class 1 variants showed the strongest enrichment with
significant associations being shown for known susceptibility
genes: MSH2, MLH1 and APC (Fig.2 and Supplementary Data 1).
T1 association for APC based on Class 2 variants was far less
significant, emphasizing the issue of assigning pathogenicity to
missense
variants
(Supplementary
Data
2).
Moreover,
for
well-documented CRC genes, including MSH6 and PMS2,
irrespective of class, T1 associations did not attain statistical
significance, reflecting also their more limited contribution to
CRC susceptibility (Fig.2 and Supplementary Data 1–3). None of
the cases were identified as being carriers of multiple Class 1
mutations in a known gene (Supplementary Note 1).
To estimate the maximal contribution of known susceptibility
genes to familial CRC, we relaxed sequencing filters and manually
assessed additional rare variants incorporating ClinVar/InSight
annotations (Methods). Nine per cent of the CRC cases could
be ascribed to rare Class 1 mutations in the established
high-penetrance genes. Even including the contribution of all
rare non-synonymous variants, only 31% of familial CRC is
explained (Fig.3 and Supplementary Table 3).
To search for novel CRC susceptibility genes we confined
analysis to the 863 cases, which did not carry a probable
disease-causing mutation in an established high-penetrance CRC
gene. Although no T1 association was exome-wide significant
(Supplementary Data 1), we sought support for promising
associations using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data on an
additional 188 familial cases (WG188) in conjunction with WGS
data on 3,582 UK10K controls—WGSET (Fig.1 and Methods).
We restricted this analysis to genes with Class 1 nominally
significant T1 P-values in the Discovery series. Evaluating
candidate genes for support in the WGSET, the presence of
recurrent variants and biological plausibility identified three novel
potential CRC genes—IL12RB1, LIMK2 and POLE2 (Tables 1
and 2). The recurrent IL12RB1 truncating variants p.Gln542Ter
(three WES and two WGSET cases) and p.Gln32Ter (one WES
and one 1958BC control) cause recessive IL12-Rb1 deficiency4.
Interestingly, another IL12RB1 truncating mutation (Gln376Ter)
has been linked with intestinal gastric cancer5. In LIMK2, we
identified the recurrent variant p.Gln574ArgfsTer12 in five WES
cases and one 1958BC control. Positive selection for decreased
LIMK2 activity during CRC initiation and progression has
been documented6, and of the 18 LIMK2 mutations catalogued
by COSMIC, 14 were identified in colorectal tumours7. The
recurrent POLE2 p.Leu469PhefsTer17 variant was detected in
three WES and one WG188 cases; the mutation is rare in
Europeans (Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) frequency
10/27,173; Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4). POLE2 is a
subunit of the polymerase epsilon enzyme complex. POLE
mutation causes polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis8;
hence, there is a strong likelihood that POLE2 mutation will affect
CRC. Support for this comes from the recent identification
of POLE2 mutations in two families segregating CRC and
polyposis9.
Gene-set enrichment analysis. As far as they have been
deciphered, cancer susceptibility genes for the same tumour type
are often implicated in the same biological processes. To
complement our T1 analysis of single genes, we conducted a
gene-set enrichment analysis10 (GSEA) based on the GO
Biological Process ontology using our entire Discovery series to
identify genes, which individually may not be so remarkable as to
be detectable at the exome-wide level of significance (Methods).
The DNA_REPLICATION gene set was significantly associated
with
CRC
(Q-value
o0.1
in
gene-set

test;
Supplementary
Table
5).
This
enrichment
is
driven
by
disruptive mutations in MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 and MSH6, but
also POLE2, and POT1 and MRE11A genes hitherto not
previously implicated in CRC susceptibility.
POT1 and MRE11A represent credible CRC predisposition
genes a priori. Both genes participate in telomere length

 maintenance; in addition, MRE11A is a double-strand break
repair nuclease involved in homologous recombination and is
inactivated in mismatch repair-deficient cancer. Three cases had
disruptive mutations in MRE11A, including the ovarian cancer-
associated mutation p.Leu7fsTer18 (ref. 11), which was identified
in a 55-year-old male with microsatellite stable rectosigmoid
adenocarcinoma. There was no documented family history of
ovarian cancer (Supplementary Table 4). In POT1, we identified
three
disruptive
mutations
(two
WES
and
one
WG188;
Supplementary Table 4) including the familial glioma variant
p.Asp617GlufsTer9, predicted to impair association with telo-
meres12. In addition to glioma, inherited POT1 mutations are
documented
to
cause
familial
melanoma13,14,

syndrome15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The mother of
the p.Asp617GlufsTer9 mutation carrier had CRC at 47 and
lymphoma at 76 years. Our findings are compatible with a more
extensive spectrum of cancer types associated with POT1
mutation.
Search for recessively acting variants. Although most Mendelian
CRC genes are dominant, inactivation of MUTYH, one of the
three key components of base-excision repair, causes recessive
CRC16. We looked expressly for evidence of homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for rare damaging variants. Although
not highly powered to detect such alleles, we identified compound
heterozygosity
for
the
base-excision
repair
gene
NTHL1
p.Gln90Ter/p.Gln287Ter (Supplementary Table 4), supporting
the recent observation of NTHL1 as a rare cause of recessive
CRC17.
Analysis of common variants. Although not the primary
purpose of this study, we took the opportunity to search for
common (that is, MAF 45%) SNVs and indels influencing CRC
risk—identifying a significant association with ATF1 c.327C4T
(rs1129406; MAF ¼ 0.39, P ¼ 2.08 � 10 � 7).
Analysis of non-coding variants. Although our sequencing
primarily targeted exons, a proportion of ‘off-target’ reads are
expected to encompass gene regulatory regions (Methods).
Acknowledging the limitations of these data we examined
such variants, identifying a significant association with a
common variant rs749072 (chr3.37096024:g.T4C, MAF ¼ 0.36,
P ¼ 8.0 � 10 � 8), which is associated with MLH1 promoter
methylation18. No rare non-coding variant showed a significant
association.
Discussion
Here we have searched for high-impact mutations within the
exome, a highly enriched subset of the genome in which it has
been argued that disease-causing mutations are most likely to
reside. By focusing on the exome, we have limited our ability to
identify pathogenic mutations outside of transcribed regions and
targeted capture is insufficiently sensitive to detected copy
number variation. However, data catalogued by CLINVAR on
the known CRC genes suggests copy number variations (1–50 kb)
are likely to account for o10% of pathogenic mutations.
Accepting these caveats, our findings invite several conclusions.
We can confidently ascribe 15% of familial CRC cases to rare

in
established
CRC
predisposition
genes
with
a
maximum estimate of 31%. We also have found evidence for
novel CRC predisposition genes, which merit further functional
and/or replication analysis. The biological function of the
candidate CRC genes we identified (MRE11, POLE2 and POT1)
further underscore the centrality of DNA replication/instability as
a cause of heritable CRC. It is however unlikely that further major
high-penetrance genes with a similar profile to the mismatch
repair or APC genes exist. Moreover, we did not identify any
coding low-frequency alleles (1–5%) with moderate effect.
Over the range of allele frequencies and effect sizes compatible
with the established 2.2-fold sibling relative risk of CRC19, our
study had over 80% power to identify a new predisposition gene
accounting for 41% of the familial risk (Supplementary Fig.3).
Our study thus clarifies the genetic architecture of CRC
and probably discounts the existence of further major high-
penetrance susceptibility genes. For alleles having a more modest
impact on overall CRC burden, sample sizes of 10,000 cases are
likely
to
be
required
for
gene
discovery
initiatives.
The
identification of missense driven CRC genes will be hampered
by our inability to accurately classify such mutations, acting to
dilute the association signal and reducing effective population
size. Thus, our analysis highlights a major requirement in cancer
gene discovery studies, to improve on the ability to accurately
assign pathogenicity to sequence changes. In the meantime,
additional evidence such as functional data and/or screens of
further cases will be required to prioritize candidate pathogenic
coding variants. Furthermore, our ability to identify common risk
variants, coupled with the prediction from statistical modelling of
genome-wide association study (GWAS) data that 17% of the
heritable CRC risk can be ascribed to common variants20,
provides a rationale for continued implementation of GWAS to
identify new risk loci. It is notable that the mutations in the
known genes are associated with more profound family history of
CRC than in those in whom a genetic diagnosis cannot be made
(Supplementary Table 2). Thus, from the clinical perspective,
gene testing should not detract from the value of a detailed family
history to inform screening requirements in patients and families.
In
conclusion,
from
our
analysis
it
is
clear
that
the
identification of additional significant CRC gene associations will
require very large-scale sequencing in conjunction with careful
statistical analysis. However, such efforts should not detract from
the analysis of small but highly informative CRC families
ascertained on the basis of highly selected phenotypes and which
are likely to continue to prove highly effective in gene discovery.
Methods
Ethics. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals with ethical
review board approval (UK National Cancer Research Network Multi-Research
Ethics Committee 02/0/097) and the study was conducted in accordance with the
declaration of Helsinki.
Samples and data sets for discovery. The cases comprised 1,028 unrelated
patients (559 male) with CRC, aged r55 years at diagnosis (mean age 48.7,
s.d. ¼ 6.0), who had at least one first-degree relative with CRC, ascertained between
2003 and 2011 through the NSCCG3. All the patients were UK residents and had
self-reported European ancestry. Germline DNA was isolated from EDTA-venous
bloods using standard methods and picogreen quantified.
The controls comprised 1,644 healthy individuals from the UK 1958BC21—974
from the ICR1000 data set (EGAD00001001021)22 and an additional 670 individuals,
all sequenced at The Institute of Cancer Research as per the Discovery cases.
Whole-exome sequencing. A Covaris E Series instrument (Covaris Inc., Woburn,
MA, USA) was used to fragment 1 mg of DNA from each individual. Illumina’s
Truseq 62 Mb expanded exome enrichment kit was used to prepare indexed
paired-end libraries, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA); 2 � 100 bp sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000
technology.
Read mapping and variant analysis. CASAVA software (v.1.8.1, Illumina) was
used to extract paired-end fastq files. The alignment of reads to build 37 (hg19) of
the human reference genome was performed using Stampy23 and BWA24 software.
The Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATKv3) pipeline was implemented according to
best practices25,26. Analysis was restricted to capture regions defined in the Truseq
62 Mb bed file plus 100 bp padding. The Variant Effect Predictor (VEP; ref. 27) was
used to provide annotations on the predicted impact of each variant together with
functional classifications from the CONDEL28 algorithm. We additionally
annotated with alignability of 100mers and distance from simple repeats defined
by UCSC browser tracks.
Sample-level quality control. Using the set of common SNVs defined in
dbSNPv138 and performing genotype calling using the Platypus29 algorithm,
we assessed sample quality according to a number of metrics. We identified
seven individuals who had non-northern European ancestry, through principal
component analysis using EIGENSTRAT30 software in conjunction with
HapMap Project data. In addition, we excluded individuals with high levels of
heterozygosity, sex discrepancy, poor call rate and contamination (Supplementary
Fig. 1). During the course of the study, two 1958BC controls were identified as
having been diagnosed with cancer and they were excluded. We calculated a
similarity metric between all samples to assess identity-by-state; no related
individuals were identified. Cases and controls were compared using transition/
transversion ratios, dbSNP percentage and number of alternate alleles across of
different VEP classes called by the GATK pipeline. No substantial difference was
observed between these metrics for cases and controls (Supplementary Table 1).
Variant filters. We considered only canonical transcripts and for each variant,
assuming the most deleterious predicted effect for each transcript according to
VEP. In gene-based analyses, only non-silent variants were considered (that is,
transcript ablations, splice donor/acceptors, splice region, stop gain, frameshift,
stop lost, initiator codon variants, transcript amplifications, in-frame insertion/
deletions and missense). For all analyses, we imposed GATK internal calling
thresholds excluding variants as per the current best practice guidelines—in the
99.5th truth tranche for SNVs and 499th tranche for indels. To further identify
false positives, which would have an adverse impact on the analysis, we adopted an
automated approach imposing: GQ Z30; for a heterozygous call, an alternate
depth Z3 and w2o10.83 (that is, P40.0001) for the observed versus expected
distribution of alternate/reference alleles (alt-ref-ratio); UCSC alignability
(100 bp window size) ¼ 1, not in simple repeat; Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
test (P41.0 � 10 � 8) in cases and controls; and an overall call rate Z75%
in both cases and controls.
Contamination analysis. We used verifyBamID to estimate per sample levels of
contamination, identifying a single contaminated sample, which was excluded.
ExomeArray concordance. We evaluated the fidelity of exome sequencing in
1,332 samples, which had also been genotyped using Illumina HumanExome-
12v1_A Beadchip arrays (Illumina). Probes were excluded if monomorphic, call
rate o0.99 in cases/controls, there was a significant difference in uncalled
genotypes between cases and controls (Po0.05), there was a significant Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium in controls Po0.001 and if non-autosomal. Samples were
excluded if the call rate was o0.99 or called variants exhibited outlying hetero-
zygosity (43 s.d.). Concordance was assessed for rare biallelic SNVs (o5% fre-
quency). SNVs with unresolvable strands (A/T and C/G) were excluded. We used
PLINK-seq to extract a set of 46,811 SNVs seen in the exome array data. Assuming
that this set constitutes the set of true positives, we assessed the sensitivity of our
exome sequencing data by counting the number of these variants correctly iden-
tified through our exome-sequencing protocol. Specificity and sensitivity across all
alleles with MAFo0.05 was 499.99% and 78.4%, respectively, for filtered variants.
Coverage of non-coding regions. The Illumina expanded TruSeq Exome
Enrichment captures 62 Mb of the human exonic regions, including 28 Mb of
50- and 30-untranslated regions. As part of the analysis pipeline, the TruSeq capture
regions are padded by an additional 100 bp at either end as per GATK best
practices. In total, 46 Mb of intronic sequence and 21 Mb of promoter regions are
captured (62% at 410 � coverage).
Samples and data sets for replication. The WG188 cases comprised 188 CRC
cases selected for early age of presentation and family history from the Colorectal
Tumour Gene Identification study (http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.
aspx?StudyID=7590). All of the cases were UK residents and had self-reported
European ancestry. All were mutation negative for mismatch repair mutations.
WGS data (mean average coverage 58 � ) were obtained using the Complete
Genomics technology31. Variant call format files were extracted using CGAtools.
Only exonic variants were considered for this analysis.
UK10K individual-level variant call format files were downloaded from the
Sanger ftp site. ALSPAC (1,828) and TWINSUK (1,754) samples that passed

 UK10K quality control metrics were extracted. Only coding variants that had
passed UK10K quality control were considered. European population frequencies
of coding variants were downloaded from ExAC—release 0.3. For this analysis, a
subsection of the ExAC data was used, excluding samples analysed as part of The
Cancer Genome Atlas.
The Illumina Exome array data comprised Infinium Human Exome BeadChip
12v1.0 or 12v1.1 exon array data on 5,552 UK cases and 6,792 UK controls, which
we have previously reported32. We excluded samples overlapping with the
Discovery exome-sequencing set.
Statistical analysis. For individual variant association, we performed a per-var-
iant analysis (considering each alternate allele in turn) using a two-sided Fisher’s
exact test implemented in R software (version 3.1.3). Meta-analysis was performed
with exome array data sets to combine evidence across study-specific P-values
under a fixed-effects model.
For gene-centric analysis, to test whether rare mutations contribute to CRC,
we performed a collapsing burden test imposing a maximal MAF threshold of 1%
(T1 test). We applied the T1 test to three different types of variant groups:
(1) Disruptive (stop gain and frameshift); (2) Predicted damaging (stop gain,
frameshift, missense predicted to be damaging by CONDEL and splice site
acceptor/donors); and (3) Non-synonymous (all coding non-synonymous
variants). Significance levels were assessed using 105 permutations on case/control
status. Genes with a T1 Po0.01 were permuted an additional 2 � 106 times,
to ensure recovery of statistical significance for associations. Exome-wide
significance was considered to be P ¼ 8.0 � 10 � 7, corresponding to a Bonferroni
correction for the testing of B20,000 genes and three variant sets.
The T1 burden test was applied to both Discovery (exome) and WGSET sets.
For the Discovery set, the T1 test was performed on both the full set of 1,006 cases
and a set of cases where CRC could not be confidently ascribed to pathogenic
variant in an established CRC predisposition gene. To create this reduced set, we
took a conservative criterion to maximize the opportunity of discovering a novel
association. Those samples that contained either a Class 1 variant or a variant
previously described as being pathogenic or likely to be pathogenic by InSight
(The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours) were
removed, leaving 863 samples potentially harbouring novel associations.
The replication analysis, based on the WGSET, was restricted to genes with
Class 1 nominally significant T1 P-values in this reduced Discovery series.
Meta-analysis was performed on the two data sets, to combine evidence across
study-specific P-values using sample size-weighted Z-score method, implemented
in METAL33,34.
We assessed the biological plausibility of candidate genes on the basis of
interaction with a known high-penetrance gene, being part of a known CRC
pathway, mapping to a GWAS signal, being significantly somatically mutated in
CRC, established tumour suppressor or oncogenic role.
We used GSEA to assess the potential over-representation of damaging variants
within a curated set. Ranking of genes was based their T1 permuted P-values.
A pre-ranked GSEA was then performed using sets defined as being part of the
same GO biological process (c5.bp.v2.5.symbols.gmt provided by GSEA software).
Set-based permutations (10,000) were performed to determine significance. Leading
edge analysis was performed on all gene sets stipulating a Q o0.25, to identify genes
that accounted for each set’s enrichment signal (Supplementary Table 5).
Calculation of study power. Disease allele frequency in controls was taken as the
baseline allele frequency, whereas the frequency in cases was determined by a
weighted average of the enrichment found in cases with one, two and three affected
first-degree relatives. Allele counts were then sampled from frequencies between
0.00001 and 0.01, and relative risks between 1.75 and 4.0. A Fisher’s test was then
performed for each sampling of cases and controls. This process was performed
10,000 times for each frequency/relative risk combination and for each instance the
frequency of tests that were significant at an exome-wide significance of 8.0 � 10 � 7
equated to study power.

deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive, which is hosted by the
European Bioinformatics Institute, accession numbers EGAS00001001666 and
EGAS00001001667, respectively. The remaining data are either contained within
the Article and its Supplementary Information or available from the authors on
