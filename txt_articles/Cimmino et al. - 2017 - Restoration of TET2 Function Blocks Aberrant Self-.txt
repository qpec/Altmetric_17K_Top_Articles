SUMMARY
Loss-of-function mutations in TET2 occur frequently in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with a 
DNA hypermethylation phenotype. To determine the role of TET2 deficiency in leukemia stem 
cell maintenance, we generated a reversible transgenic RNAi mouse to model restoration of

 endogenous Tet2 expression. Tet2 restoration reverses aberrant hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cell (HSPC) self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with vitamin C, a cofactor of Fe2+ and α-
KG-dependent dioxygenases, mimics TET2 restoration by enhancing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine 
formation in Tet2-deficient mouse HSPCs and suppresses human leukemic colony formation and 
leukemia progression of primary human leukemia PDXs. Vitamin C also drives DNA 
hypomethylation and expression of a TET2-dependent gene signature in human leukemia cell 
lines. Furthermore, TET-mediated DNA oxidation induced by vitamin C treatment in leukemia 
cells enhances their sensitivity to PARP inhibition and could provide a safe and effective 
combination strategy to selectively target TET deficiency in cancer.
In Brief
Vitamin C treatment mimics the effect of TET2 restoration on leukemic stem cells and enhances 
the efficacy of PARP inhibition in suppressing leukemia progression.
INTRODUCTION
TET2 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in hematopoietic malignancies. Somatic 
deletions and loss of function mutations in TET2 are seen in ~10% of de novo acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML), ~30% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and almost 50% of chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients (Delhommeau et al., 2009; Kosmider et al., 
2009). TET2 mutations are associated with DNA hypermethylation, increased risk of MDS 
progression, and poor prognosis in AML (reviewed in Guillamot et al., 2016).
The ten-eleven-translocation (TET1-3) proteins are α-ketoglutarate- and Fe2+-dependent 
dioxygenases (α-KGDDs) that catalyze the iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). 
These oxidized mCs are key intermediates in DNA demethylation via replication-dependent 
dilution or base excision repair (BER). Truncations or catalytic domain mutants of TET2, as 
found in leukemia patients, affect Fe2+ and/or α-KG binding, leading to impaired 5mC

 oxidation and DNA hypermethylation (Pastor et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014). These findings 
highlight the importance of targeting aberrant DNA methylation for the treatment of TET2 
mutant diseases.
Several studies have modeled TET2 loss of function in mice (Guillamot et al., 2016). Tet2 
deletion causes progressive defects in hematopoiesis, including increased hematopoietic 
stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and myeloid lineage expansion. These phenotypes correlate 
with loss of 5hmC in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), DNA 
hypermethylation, and altered gene expression consistent with a myeloid lineage bias in self-
renewing progenitors. A significant proportion of Tet2-deficient mice develop a CMML-like 
disease, characterized by increased circulating white blood cells (WBCs), monocytosis, and 
splenomegaly (Moran-Crusio et al., 2011; Quivoron et al., 2011).
TET2 mutations are seen at high allele frequency in CD34+ HSPCs (Delhommeau et al., 
2009; Papaemmanuil et al., 2016) and in a wide variety of hematopoietic malignancies 
(Guillamot et al., 2016), suggesting such mutations are early drivers of transformation in 
cells with multi-lineage potential. TET2 mutations are also found in the WBCs of otherwise 
healthy adults with clonal hematopoiesis, a condition of aging associated with myeloid 
lineage bias and increased risk of progression to MDS and AML (Sperling et al., 2017). 
Hence, TET2 mutation represents a pre-leukemic lesion that can enable disease progression, 
either by altering the epigenetic landscape or by promoting acquisition of additional 
oncogenic lesions in aberrantly self-renewing stem cells.
Conceivably, restoring TET2 function could provide therapeutic benefit to patients with 
clonal hematopoiesis or MDS, but it remains unclear if TET2 deficiency is necessary for 
disease maintenance. To test this possibility, we generated reversible RNAi transgenic mice 
to model knockdown and restoration of endogenous Tet2 in hematopoietic cells. We found 
that Tet2 knockdown recapitulates the effects of Tet2 deletion, leading to aberrant HSC self-
renewal and disease. Furthermore, reversing Tet2 silencing promotes DNA demethylation, 
cellular differentiation, and cell death, leading to a block in aberrant HSPC self-renewal.
To achieve pharmacological restoration of TET2 activity, we used vitamin C, a co-factor for 
α-KGDDs. Notably, exogenous vitamin C promotes DNA demethylation in embryonic stem 
cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Chung et al., 2010; Esteban et al., 
2010) and dramatically enhances 5hmC levels in a TET-dependent manner (Blaschke et al., 
2013; Chen et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2013). Although vitamin C administration has been tested 
in solid tumors, with some reports of efficacy (Fritz et al., 2014), the possibility that it might 
act as a targeted therapy to “correct” TET deficiency has not been explored.
Indeed, vitamin C treatment mimics Tet2 restoration by promoting DNA demethylation and 
reversing aberrant HSPC self-renewal. Vitamin C administration also impedes CMML 
progression, myeloid skewing of Tet2-deficient hematopoietic cells, and the expansion of 
primary human AML blasts. Treatment of human AML cell lines with vitamin C increases 
5mC oxidation and promotes active demethylation. These events trigger a transient DNA 
damage response, which, combined with PARP inhibition, increases cell death. Our studies

 implicate vitamin C, through its ability to enhance TET function, as a potentially non-toxic 
therapy for TET-associated malignancies.
RESULTS
Generation of Reversible Tet2 Knockdown Mice
To model reversible Tet2 knockdown, we generated miR30-based transgenic small hairpin 
RNA (shRNA) mice that express a doxycycline (Dox)-regulated, fluorescence-linked Tet2-
specific shRNA (shTet2) from the Col1a1 locus (Premsrirut et al., 2011). The shRNA mice 
were bred to two transactivator mouse strains: (1) Vav-tTA (VTA) transgenic mice, which 
express a pan-hematopoietic, tetracycline-off (Dox-off) tTA transactivator (Kim et al., 2007) 
(Figure 1A), and (2) ROSA26-M2rtTA (RTA) tetracycline-on (Dox-on) inducible mice, in 
which M2rtTA expression is driven ubiquitously from the endogenous ROSA26 promoter 
(Hochedlinger et al., 2005) (Figure 1B). Compound transgenic shRNA progeny harboring 
VTA or RTA exhibit Dox-regulated target gene restoration or knockdown, respectively. 
Transgenic shRNA mice expressing Renilla luciferase-specific shRNA (shRen) were used as 
negative controls for knockdown and restoration studies (Dow et al., 2014).
Bone marrow (BM), thymus, and spleen RNA from VTA-shTet2 mice (6- to 8-week-old) 
showed 50%–70% Tet2 knockdown by qRT-PCR, compared with VTA-shRen controls 
(Figure 1C). Mice with Tet2 knockdown developed sustained myeloid lineage bias in 
peripheral blood (PB) by 6 months of age, and compared with controls, had markedly 
decreased survival, splenomegaly, and expansion and infiltration of GFP+ cells in spleen and 
liver (Figures S1A–S1F). At sacrifice, diseased VTA-shTet2 mice displayed an increased 
frequency of cKit+ cells in the spleen (Figure S1G) and a predominance of myeloid and 
erythroid cells. BM Lineage Sca1+Kit+ (LSK) cells, Lineage-Sca1− cKit+ (cKit+ 
progenitors), and CD34+ FcR-expressing granulocyte and myeloid progenitors also were 
increased (Figure S1H). These data are consistent with mouse models of Tet2 deficiency.
The kinetics of Tet2 knockdown and restoration were assessed in cohorts of VTA and RTA-
shTet2 mice fed Dox food for 28 days (Figure 1D). After 3–7 days of Dox, GFP expression 
was induced and sustained in the PB of RTA-shTet2 mice (Figure 1E), whereas complete 
loss of GFP was detectable after 7–14 days in VTA-shTet2 mice (Figure 1F). By 3 days of 
Dox treatment, depletion of Tet2 mRNA was observed in cKit+ HSPCs (Figure 1G) and 
immature CD11b+ myeloid lineage cells (Figure 1H) purified from RTA-shTet2 BM, 
whereas complete restoration of endogenous Tet2 levels inVTA-shTet2 mice was achieved 
by 28 days.
Tet2 Restoration Reverses Aberrant Self-Renewal
Tet2-deficient HSPCs exhibit increased re-plating capacity in colony-forming assays and a 
competitive advantage in BM reconstitution studies (Moran-Crusio et al., 2011; Quivoron et 
al., 2011). To ask if sustained loss of Tet2 function is required for aberrant stem cell self-
renewal, we first performed serial re-plating assays of VTA-shTet2 colony-forming cells in 
methylcellulose medium (Figure 2A). Colonies from VTA-shTet2 (Tet2-knockdown) BM 
were re-plated successively until aberrant self-renewal was observed and then placed in

 methylcellulose media with or without Dox. Consistent with previous studies comparing 
wild-type and Tet2-deficient BM cells, control VTA-shRen colonies did not re-plate beyond 
three passages (P3), while Tet2 knockdown (VTA-shTet2) colonies replated for up to four 
passages (P4) (Figure 2B). Re-plating for a fifth passage (P5), in the presence of Dox to turn 
off the expression of shTet2, caused a block in colony-forming capacity, loss of GFP 
expression (Figures 2C and 2D), and a 2-fold increase in Tet2 mRNA levels (Figure 2E).
We next assessed the effect of Tet2 restoration in the context of oncogenes that cooperate 
with Tet2 deficiency and accelerate leukemia onset, such as AML-ETO9a and FLT3-ITD 
(Rasmussen et al., 2015; Shih et al., 2015). RTA-shTet2 cKit+ cells transduced with an 
AML-ET09a-IRES-mCherry (AE9aC)-expressing retrovirus or total BM cells from Flt3-
ITD; RTA-shTet2 mice were serially re-plated in methylcellulose. Tet2 knockdown increased 
the re-plating capacity of AE9aC-expressing (Figure S2A) and Flt3-ITD-expressing (Figure 
S2B) cells, whereas Tet2 restoration impaired re-plating (Figures S2C–S2F) and promoted 
myeloid differentiation (Figures S2G and S2H).
To determine the effect of Tet2 restoration on HSC self-renewal in vivo, we performed 
competitive bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays. As reported previously for Tet2+/− 
and Tet2− /− BM, Tet2 knockdown cells displayed a competitive advantage (Figure S2I) and 
a myeloid lineage bias in donor PB (Figure S2J). Beginning at 6 weeks post-transplant, Dox 
food was administered to half of the cohort, and treated and untreated mice were monitored 
for donor chimerism for up to 28 weeks. VTA-shRen donor frequency in PB remained 
unchanged upon Dox treatment (Figure 2F), whereas Dox-treated VTA-shTet2 recipients 
showed a significant loss of competitiveness from 20 weeks post-transplant (Figure 2G), 
which correlated with loss of fluorescence-coupled shRNA expression (Figure 2H). Dox 
treatment also reversed the myeloid lineage bias caused by Tet2 knockdown in VTA shTet2 
donor PB (Figures 2I–2J). Administering Dox from the day of transplant (0 weeks), or pre-
treating donor mice with Dox for 4 weeks prior to BMT (−4 weeks), was even more 
effective at blocking the competitive advantage of VTA-shTet2 knockdown cells upon 
restoration than treatment beginning at 6 weeks or 12 weeks post-transplant (Figures S2K 
and S2L). Significant loss of donor chimerism upon Tet2 restoration was observed in all 
stem and progenitor cell compartments and in myeloid lineage cells of the BM and spleen 
(Figure S2M). These effects correlated with an ~2-fold increase in Tet2 expression in sorted 
populations of donor LSK, cKit+ progenitors, and immature CD11b+ cells (Figure 2K). 
Therefore, sustained Tet2 deficiency is required to maintain aberrant HSC self-renewal, and 
its effects are reversed upon Tet2 restoration.
Tet2 Restoration Promotes Myeloid Differentiation and Cell Death in HSPCs
To study how Tet2 restoration influences HSC function, we generated inducible cKit+ Tet2 
knockdown cell lines in cytokine-containing media. Inducing Tet2 knockdown in RTA-
shTet2 cKit+ cells over a 2-week period led to reduced Tet2 mRNA levels (2- to 2.5-fold), 
compared with those in control RTA-shRen cells (Figures S3A and S3B). Tet2 expression 
was restored completely 10–14 days following Dox-withdrawal (Figures 3A, S3C, and 
S3D). Similar kinetics of Tet2 restoration were observed in Dox-treated VTA-shTet2 cells 
(Figures S3E and S3F). Restoring Tet2 caused a block in cell proliferation (Figures 3B, S3G, 
Cimmino et al.

 and S3H), due to an increase in annexinV+ apoptotic cells (Figure 3C) and a delay in cell-
cycle progression (Figures S3I and S3J).
Tet2 knockdown cells in culture expressed cKit, Sca1, and CD34 on their surface in addition 
to low expression of the SLAM markers CD150 and CD48, but were negative for FcR and 
the myeloid lineage markers Gr1 and CD11b (Figure S3K). Upon prolonged Tet2 restoration 
(Days 18 and 21), a slight decrease in cKit+ surface expression was detected, while CD11b 
and CD34 expression increased modestly (Figures 3D and 3E). Increased CD34 expression 
is associated with loss of long-term self-renewal potential in mouse HSCs (Wilson et al., 
2008), and Tet2 has been shown to facilitate the expression of myeloid-specific genes such 
as Mac1/CD11b in B cells undergoing CEBPα-induced trans-differentiation (Kallin et al., 
2012). Hence, these data suggest that loss of aberrant self-renewal capacity in Tet2-restored 
cells is associated with impaired proliferation, increased cell death, and priming toward 
myeloid differentiation.
Differential Methylation Correlates with Global Transcriptional Changes upon Tet2 
Restoration
Steady-state Tet deficiency, modeled in mouse ESCs and HSCs, is associated with genomic 
loss of hydroxymethylation and DNA hypermethylation (Pastor et al., 2013). Similarly, 
significant DNA hypermethylation (gain of 5mC) and decreased hydroxymethylation (loss 
of 5hmC) was induced upon Tet2 knockdown in HSPCs (Figure S3L). Conversely, DNA 
demethylation (~30% loss of total 5mC) was observed after 7–10 days of Tet2 restoration in 
cKit+ Tet2-knockdown cells (Figure 3F); concomitantly, 5hmC levels increased 10–14 days 
after restoration to almost 2-fold those of knockdown levels (Figure 3G). These findings are 
consistent with a role for TET2 in promoting DNA demethylation. Interestingly, global 
methylation levels were restored after 14 days despite peak Tet2 restoration; these regions of 
the genome could represent newly methylated loci in combination with higher levels of 
5hmC.
TET family members can promote gene activation or repression (Pastor et al., 2013; Shen et 
al., 2014), and these transcriptional alterations are coupled to altered DNA methylation 
across gene bodies, enhancers, and at the boundaries of DNA methylation canyons 
(Rasmussen et al., 2015; Wiehle et al., 2015). To identify the locus-specific changes in DNA 
methylation upon Tet2 restoration, we performed single base resolution reduced 
representative bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) (Gu et al., 2011). Differentially methylated 
cytosines (DMCs) either gained or lost methylation and were most abundant after 10 days of 
Tet2 restoration (Figures 4A and S4A). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) exhibited 
greater losses than gains in methylation at CpG shores (>2 kb distance from CpG islands) 
and across exons and introns, suggesting loss of DNA methylation specifically within gene 
bodies (Figure 4B). Determining which genomic regions are direct targets of TET2 in 
primary hematopoietic cells by chromatin-binding studies has been hindered by the lack of 
antibodies that recognize endogenous TET2. However, by using a TET2 chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) signature generated by overexpressed, flag-
tagged TET2 in mouse erythroid leukemia cells (Pan et al., 2017), we found that at day 10 of 
restoration, TET2-bound DMRs were highest at promoters, exons, and CpG shores, with

 CpG island DMRs enriched for TET2 binding from days 7–14 of restoration (Figures S4B 
and S4C).
Transcriptomic analysis revealed a strong bias toward upregulation of genes (n = 173) as 
opposed to gene down-regulation (n = 15), with >2-fold changes (p < 0.05) after 10 days of 
Tet2 restoration (Figures 4C and 4D). This bias correlated with the peak in differential 
methylation observed at day 10 of Tet2 restoration (Figures 3G and 4A). The tendency 
toward greater downregulation of gene expression by 14 days of restoration might reflect a 
slowing of cell proliferation or activation of cell death in response to a threshold level of 
Tet2 achieved by 10 days of restoration (Figures 4E and 4F).
Tet2 Restoration Drives Loss of Aberrant DNA Methylation and Expression of Myeloid 
Differentiation Genes
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that genes up-regulated upon 14 days of 
restoration included cytoskeletal regulators that are highly expressed in differentiated 
myeloid lineage cells, including Ras homolog gene family, member C (RhoC) and Ras and 
Rab interactor 2 (Rin2), the epigenetic regulator DNA-methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b), and 
the transcription factor early B cell factor-1 (Ebf1). Conversely, genes important for cytokine 
signaling, such as the Map kinase family member Map3k14, were downregulated (Figure 
4G). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed apoptosis, death receptor signaling, and DNA 
damage response pathways (p53 signaling) to be specifically upregulated at 10 days of 
restoration (Figure S4D). These pathways might reflect active DNA de-methylation as the 
primary response to Tet2 restoration in these cells, despite a peak in 5hmC levels by 14 days 
of restoration.
TET2 mutant leukemia patients exhibit DNA hypermethylation, and distinct AML subtypes 
can be identified by their unique methylation signatures (Figueroa et al., 2010). By 14 days 
of Tet2 restoration, the mouse orthologs of genes hypermethylated in AML patients tended 
to be upregulated; conversely, genes hypomethylated in AML were downregulated. 
Specifically, 5/7 unique gene clusters that are aberrantly hypermethylated in subtypes of 
AML compared with normal human CD34+ cells were significantly upregulated (false 
discovery rate [FDR] <0.25) following Tet2 restoration (Figures 4H and 4I; Table S1). 
Upregulated genes included those hyper-methylated in patients with AML1-ETO (t(8;21)) or 
PML-RAR translocations or bearing CEBPA mutations (Table S1).
Vitamin C Treatment Mimics Effects of Tet2 Restoration
Our findings suggested that TET2 restoration could provide a novel therapeutic strategy to 
target TET2 mutant cells in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, MDS, or AML. As genetic 
restoration is not an option in patients, we sought to pharmacologically augment TET 
activity. Vitamin C is a co-factor of α-KGDDs and can increase 5hmC and promote TET-
dependent DNA demethylation (Young et al., 2015). Biochemical studies suggest that 
vitamin C binds TET2 and acts as a targeted electron donor to restore iron to the Fe2+ state 
in the TET catalytic cycle, thereby increasing the rate of 5mC oxidation by up to 8-fold (Yin 
et al., 2013). We hypothesized that vitamin C treatment, by increasing TET catalytic activity, 
might pharmacologically mimic Tet2 restoration in Tet2-deficient HSCs.

 Treatment of wild-type Lin− cKit+ cell cultures with vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid [L-AA]) led 
to a 2-fold increase in 5hmC and a 2-fold loss in 5mC in genomic DNA, as measured by dot 
blot analysis (Figure 5A). Moreover, whereas Tet2+/− or Tet2− /− cells showed aberrant re-
plating capacity (>4 passages) when treated with PBS, vitamin C-treated cells showed a 
severe block in re-plating capacity (Figure 5B). Importantly, vitamin C did not affect colony 
formation by wild-type cells. High levels of vitamin C can lead to reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) production via the Fenton reaction (Du et al., 2012). However, serial re-plating 
capacity was still blocked when catalase, an enzyme that can decompose hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) to water and oxygen, was included with vitamin C in the media (Figure 5C).
There are multiple members of the α-KGDD family, and most, if not all of these, use 
vitamin C as a co-factor (Young et al., 2015). Although the ability of vitamin C to suppress 
re-plating correlated with increased 5hmC and decreased 5mC levels in DNA, these findings 
alone do not establish that vitamin C affects self-renewal via TET family members. Notably, 
Tet2−/− cells were somewhat resistant to the effects of vitamin C, yet still showed decreased 
re-plating compared with untreated cells (Figure 5D). Conceivably, other TET family 
members compensate for the absence of Tet2 and mediate the effects of vitamin C on 
Tet2−/− cells; alternatively, vitamin C could act through other α-KGDDs. Tet2 and Tet3 are 
the most abundantly expressed Tet genes in HSPCs (An et al., 2015). We therefore 
performed colony-forming assays with BM cells from Tet2+/−, Tet2−/−, and Tet2−/− Tet3-
knockdown, the latter generated by crossing Tet2−/− mice to RTA transgenic shTet3 mice 
(Tet2−/− Tet3KD). Tet2−/− Tet3KD cells exhibited increased re-plating capacity (Figure S5A), 
comparable to Tet2+/− and Tet2−/− cells. However, Tet2−/− Tet3KD cells were far more 
resistant than Tet2−/− cells to the inhibitory effect of vitamin C on serial re-plating (Figures 
5D and S5A). Furthermore, vitamin C-evoked 5hmC generation was markedly impaired in 
Tet2−/− Tet3KD cKit+ cells (Figure 5E), consistent with the significantly decreased Tet2 and 
Tet3 mRNA levels in Tet2−/−Tet3KD cells (Figure 5F). Together, these data suggest that 
vitamin C blocks aberrant HSPC self-renewal primarily by increasing TET2 and TET3 
activity.
Vitamin C is an essential dietary requirement in humans, due to mutation in the enzyme L-
gulonolactone oxidase, which remains functional in mice (Young et al., 2015). Despite being 
able to generate vitamin C in the absence of dietary supplementation, mice deficient in Tet2 
still develop myeloid malignancies that mimic human disease. This finding suggests that 
supra-physiological doses of vitamin C might be required in vivo to block TET2 mutant 
hematopoietic neoplasia. Previous pharmacokinetic studies showed that administration of 
vitamin C as sodium ascorbate (ASC) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection in mice can increase 
plasma levels from approximately 10 μM up to 30 mM for 10–30 min and remain >200 μM 
for up to 4 hr (Yun et al., 2015). To ask if high-dose vitamin C could induce 5hmC 
production in vivo, we injected a cohort of mice with a single dose of ASC (4 g/kg). Flow 
cytometric analysis of 5hmC in PB revealed an increase in 5hmC that remained ~2-fold 
above baseline levels for 2–6 hr post-injection (Figure 5G). We then tested the effect of daily 
injections of ASC for 3 successive days and again found 5hmC levels to be higher than 
baseline, with a 2-fold loss in 5mC in PB (Figure S5B).

 As Tet2 restoration blocks myeloid disease progression following BMT, we treated mice 
reconstituted with Tet2+/+ or Tet2−/− BM with i.p. injections of PBS or ASC for 24 weeks 
(Figure S5C). As expected, compared with Tet2+/+ recipients, Tet2−/− mice developed 
CMML-like disease with elevated WBC counts from 12 weeks post-transplant in the PBS-
injected group that increased progressively to 24 weeks. Remarkably, and consistent with its 
effects in vitro, ASC treatment significantly decreased WBC counts (Figure 5H) and CMML 
progression in Tet2−/− mice. Minor decreases in WBC counts were also observed in ASC-
injected Tet2+/+ recipients. The decrease in Tet2−/− WBCs upon ASC treatment correlated 
with a diminished frequency of myeloid lineage donor cells (Figure 5I) and decreased 
numbers of circulating myeloid cells in PB (Figure 5J).
Next, we performed colony-forming and liquid differentiation assays with purified leukemic 
HSPCs and blasts from three TET2 mutant patients (Table S2). Similar to our observations 
on Tet2-deficient mouse cells, patient-derived HSPCs and blasts showed decreased 
clonogenicity in methylcellulose assays (Figure S5D) and increased surface expression of 
the myeloid marker CD14 in liquid culture upon treatment with vitamin C (Figure S5E).
We also evaluated the effects of ASC on two primary human AML PDX models (Table S2). 
Upon detection of >1% human CD45+ (hCD45+) cells in PB, mice were treated i.p. with 
PBS or ASC (Figure S5F). Circulating hCD45+ cells in PB, spleen weight, and blast 
frequency in BM and spleen were all reduced in ASC-treated PDXs, compared with PBS 
controls (Figures S5G–S5J). These data suggest that high-dose vitamin C treatment could be 
effective for preventing myeloid disease progression.
Vitamin C Increases TET Activity in Human AML Cells and Drives DNA Hypomethylation
The ability of vitamin C to block self-renewal and myeloid disease progression in mice 
prompted us to explore its effects on TET function and 5hmC generation in the HL60 and 
MOLM13 cell lines, representative of acute myeloblastic and acute monocytic leukemia, 
respectively (Table S3). These cell lines do not harbor TET mutations (Barretina et al., 2012) 
but were shown to be sensitive to vitamin C treatment in a previous study (Kawada et al., 
2013); however, a mechanistic role for TET activity and 5hmC in the effects of vitamin C 
was not explored. Consistent with our observations using mouse HSPCs, vitamin C 
treatment for 72 hr caused increased 5hmC formation in both lines (Figure 6A), without 
altering TET1-3 expression (Figure S6A). We performed 5hmC DNA immunoprecipitation 
(5hmeDIP) with genomic DNA from untreated HL60 cells (0 hr) and cells treated for 72 hr 
with vitamin C. Nearly all differentially hydroxymethylated peaks (29,492; 97%) exhibited 
gain of 5hmC upon vitamin C treatment (Figure 6B). Increased 5hmC was enriched within 
gene bodies, compared with transcription start sites (TSS) or transcription end sites (TES) 
(Figure 6C), and in the center of CpG islands and at CpG shores (+/− 3 kb) (Figure S6B). 
Traditional bisulfite sequencing does not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC. Therefore, we 
performed oxidative RRBS (oxRRBS), which first converts 5hmC to 5fC and, after bisulfite 
treatment and sequencing, allows comparative DNA methylation changes to be quantified 
specifically at 5mC sites (Booth et al., 2013). We observed a 2-fold loss in 5mC by 72 hr of 
vitamin C treatment in both leukemia cell lines (Figures 6D and S6C). DMRs were 
distributed almost identically in the two lines, with 50% located within CpG islands and

 shores and >70% associated with gene bodies and promoters (Figure 6E). Greater loss than 
gain in 5mC was observed across almost all chromosomes (Figure 6F) with 1.5- to 2-fold 
greater loss in 5mC in all CpG contexts and genomic loci (Figure 6G).
Transcriptomic analysis revealed strong overlap in the vitamin C-regulated genes in HL60 
and MOLM13 cells after 12 hr of treatment (Figure S6D), although there was less overlap at 
72 hr (Figure S6E). Nevertheless, there was enrichment for Tet2-restored genes from mouse 
cKit+ cells following 12 hr of vitamin C treatment of both human leukemia lines (Figure 
S6F), which remained significant in MOLM13 cells at 72 hr (Figures 6H and S6G). 
Fourteen out of 50 (14/50) genes upregulated by Tet2 restoration in mouse cKit+ cells also 
were induced in both human leukemia lines after 12 hr of vitamin C treatment, including 
genes involved in apoptotic and death receptor signaling (BAX, GADD45a), 
phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (CHKA and CHKB), and NOTCH signaling (PSENEN) 
(Figure 6I). Of the top genes downregulated by Tet2-restoration, 34/50 were downregulated 
in both leukemia lines after 12 hr of vitamin C (Figure S6H). Hence, vitamin C treatment 
can enhance TET2 function in human leukemia cells in a manner similar to the effects of 
Tet2 restoration in mouse HSPCs.
TET-Mediated Oxidation of DNA by Vitamin C in Combination with PARP Inhibition 
Enhances AML Cell Death
We observed significant decreases in cell viability of Tet2+/−, Tet2−/−, and Tet2−/− Tet3KD 
mouse cKit+ cells during liquid culture (2 weeks) in the presence of increasing 
concentrations of vitamin C (Figure S7A). As seen in colony-forming assays, vitamin C had 
less effect on the viability of Tet2−/− and Tet2−/− Tet3KD cells in liquid culture compared 
with Tet2+/− cells. Remarkably, Tet2 restoration or vitamin C treatment of AML-ETO9a-
expressing or FLT3-ITD-expressing, Tet2 knockdown cells also impaired their proliferation 
in liquid culture (Figures S7B and S7C). We therefore extended our analysis of the effects of 
vitamin C on 5hmC formation and cell viability to a panel of human myeloid leukemia lines, 
including (in addition to HL60 and MOLM13) K562 (blast crisis chronic myeloid 
leukemia), THP1 (acute monocytic leukemia), and KG-1 and KASUMI-1 (acute 
myeloblastic leukemias) (Table S3). Vitamin C caused decreased viability after 72 hr of 
treatment in all cell lines (Figure 7A) without any change in TET1-3 expression (Figure 
S7D). The effects on proliferation increased at higher vitamin C concentrations (up to 1 
mM), but there was a substantial decrease in viability even at lower doses (125 μM) when 
cells were treated for up to 2 weeks (Figure S7E).
Levels of 5hmC increased in DNA from all human leukemia cells tested in response to 
vitamin C treatment for 72 hr (Figure 7B). Although 5hmC is a stable modification, its 
iterative oxidation products, 5fC and 5caC, recruit the BER machinery and are actively 
removed by thymidine DNA glycosylase (TDG) (Shen et al., 2014). Notably, vitamin C-
treated human AML cells exhibited 5fC depletion, changes in 5caC levels and loss of 5mC 
(Figure 7C), suggestive of active DNA demethylation by BER. As noted above, vitamin C 
can generate increased H2O2, which could promote oxidative DNA damage and trigger 
DNA repair (Cadet and Wagner, 2013). However, 2-phospho-L-ascorbic acid (P-AA), which 
does not generate ROS (Du et al., 2012), also induced 5hmC formation and cell death in 
Cimmino et al.

 AML cells (Figures S7F and S7G). Moreover, vitamin C (at 250 μM or 1 mM) did not 
increase dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence, an indicator of intracellular ROS (Figure 
S7H).
Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) is an essential mediator of BER that targets single-
strand breaks (SSBs) induced by DNA damage and recruits BER complex proteins (Morales 
et al., 2014). The peak of DNA demethylation upon 10 days of Tet2 restoration to cKit+ cells 
correlated with increased expression of Parp and Gadd45 (Figure 7D), whose gene products 
function in DNA demethylation (Barreto et al., 2007; Ciccarone et al., 2012). As noted 
above, Tet2 restoration also evoked a p53 transcriptional signature, consistent with a DNA 
damage response (Figure S4D). We therefore compared the expression of PARP, GADD45, 
and additional genes involved in BER and active DNA demethylation, including DNA 
glycosylases (MBD4, UNG, TDG, SMUG1, MUTYH), ligases (NEIL1/2), endonucleases 
(APEX1/2, FEN1), and polymerases (POLDβ, POLD1/2) in vitamin C-treated human AML 
cells. Indeed, BER genes such as PARP and GADD45 were upregulated in HL60 (Figure 
7E) and MOLM13 cells (Figure 7F), indicating that Tet2 restoration and vitamin C treatment 
induce the expression of genes whose products mediate active DNA demethylation.
PARP inhibition can increase tumor sensitivity to DNA damage induced by chemotherapy 
and results in synthetic lethality in cells lacking intact BER or harboring homologous 
recombination (HR) defects (Morales et al., 2014). We hypothesized that TET-mediated 
DNA oxidation induced by vitamin C could render AML cells hypersensitive to PARP 
inhibition by blocking DNA repair associated with DNA demethylation. To test this 
possibility, we treated AML cell lines with combinations of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and 
vitamin C (L-AA), at varying doses. Remarkably, combination olaparib/vitamin C treatment 
caused a greater loss in viability of HL60, MOLM13, THP1, and KG1 cells than either agent 
alone (Figures 7G and S7I).
DISCUSSION
We have found that targeted restoration of Tet2 is sufficient to block aberrant self-renewal of 
pre-leukemic stem cells. Similarly, vitamin C, by enhancing the activity of TET family 
dioxygenases, acts as a pharmacologic mimic of Tet2 restoration. Moreover, genetic or 
pharmacological restoration of TET activity confers an emergent vulnerability in leukemia 
cells, rendering them more sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Together, these results suggest new 
therapeutic strategies for clonal hematopoiesis, MDS and AML.
In the 1970s, Cameron et al. (1979) first administered high-dose intravenous (i.v.) vitamin C, 
in parallel with oral supplementation, to treat solid tumors, and saw some clinical responses. 
Subsequent clinical trials failed to show any therapeutic benefit of high-dose vitamin C, but 
these failures might have been due to the intrinsically limited bioavailability of orally 
administered vitamin C (Padayatty and Levine, 2016). Intracellular vitamin C levels in 
humans vary from 1 mM in WBCs to 10 mM in brain cells. Yet, following oral 
administration of very high doses of vitamin C (>500 mg/day), maximal plasma 
concentrations do not exceed 150 μM, due to homeostatic downregulation of the sodium-
dependent vitamin C transporter that regulates intestinal absorption (Young et al., 2015). By

 contrast, i.v. administration of vitamin C can yield plasma levels up to 100-fold higher than 
normal levels with minimal toxicity (Padayatty and Levine, 2016).
Several recent clinical trials report some clinical benefit of high-dose i.v. vitamin C 
treatment of solid tumors (Fritz et al., 2014), yet the underlying therapeutic mechanism has 
remained largely undefined. One study suggested that vitamin C decreases viability of 
human leukemia cell lines by promoting downregulation of HIF1α and the anti-apoptotic 
genes, BCL2, BCL2L1, and MCL1 (Kawada et al., 2013). Others recently showed that 
vitamin C selectively kills KRAS and BRAF mutant colorectal cancer cells by targeting 
GAPDH (Yun et al., 2015). Vitamin C treatment of various cancer cell lines also enhances 
the viral mimicry response to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as 5-azacytidine (Liu 
et al., 2016). Given the diversity of α-KG and Fe2+-dependent enzymes that utilize vitamin 
C as a co-factor (including prolylhydroxylases, jumonji histone demethylases, and TET 
enzymes) (Young et al., 2015), the mechanistic basis for vitamin C action could well depend 
on the type of cancer and/or its dependence on specific dioxygenases.
Most leukemia patients with TET2 mutations or deletions exhibit mono-allelic TET2 loss 
(Abdel-Wahab et al., 2009; Delhommeau et al., 2009), and disease progression in Tet2+/− 
and Tet2−/− mice is almost indistinguishable (Moran-Crusio et al., 2011), indicating that 
even a 50% loss of TET2 function can initiate aberrant hematopoiesis. We have found that 
vitamin C impairs aberrant re-plating capacity and myeloid disease progression in HSPCs 
even in the complete absence of functional Tet2. Recent studies have shown that Tet2 and 
Tet3 exhibit overlapping tumor suppressive roles, as both are highly expressed in myeloid 
progenitors and their combined deletion leads to rapid and aggressive AML (An et al., 
2015). TET3 activation might compensate sufficiently for lack of TET2 to diminish aberrant 
self-renewal upon vitamin C treatment. Indeed, we find that combined Tet2/Tet3 deficiency 
causes severe depletion of steady-state 5hmC in HSPC DNA, diminished capacity for 5hmC 
generation in response to vitamin C, and markedly decreased efficacy of vitamin C in 
suppressing aberrant self-renewal. These findings suggest that vitamin C acts predominantly 
through TETs, and accordingly, a minimal amount of TET activity is required for vitamin C 
action.
MDS and AML patients are typically elderly, with a median age of 65–70 years at disease 
onset. Intensive myeloablative treatment regimens are possible in only a minority of such 
patients and are associated with decreased efficacy and increased therapy-related mortality 
(Zeidan et al., 2014). DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) elicit higher overall response 
rates in MDS and AML patients with TET2 mutations and provide an alternative to 
aggressive chemotherapy (Bejar et al., 2014). Re-expression of tumor suppressors has been 
the main focus of HMAs; however, the DNA damage response is also an important regulator 
of active DNA demethylation. While 5mC and 5hmC are stable modifications in the 
genome, 5fC and 5caC are normally present at very low levels, and their accumulation 
would lead to an increased requirement for BER to remove these modifications. This 
requirement, in turn, confers an emergent vulnerability on these cells, rendering them more 
sensitive to inhibitors of BER, such as PARPi, that can be exploited for targeted therapy.

 Decreased TET expression and loss of 5hmC are seen in a wide variety of solid tumors, as 
well as in many hematologic malignancies (Rasmussen and Helin, 2016). Our results 
suggest that future clinical trials should incorporate high-dose vitamin C as an adjuvant to 
standard chemotherapy/demethylating therapy, especially for TET2-deficient neoplasms, and 
also predict further improvement in efficacy with the addition of PARP inhibition.

 BoyJ (CD45.1) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred in a mouse facility 
at NYU Medical Center. Germ-line Tet2-deficient mice have been described previously 
(Moran-Crusio et al., 2011). For bone marrow transplantation studies, sex-matched recipient 
mice of both sexes, aged 8–10 weeks, were transplanted with donor and support bone 
marrow cells isolated from mice aged 6–8 weeks.
Primary cell culture—Total bone marrow cells from Vav-tTA or Flt3ITD;Rosa-rtTA 
shRen/shTet2, Tet2+/+, Tet2+/− and Tet2−/− mice (6–8 weeks) or purified bone marrow cKit+ 
cells from Rosa-rtTA shRen/shTet2 mice transduced with AE9a-IRES-mCherry retrovirus 
were plated in methyl-cellulose medium (Methocult M3434 or M3534, Stem Cell 
Technologies). Cells were seeded at 20,000 total bone marrow cells or 2000 purified cKit+ 
cells per replicate. Colony forming units were enumerated using a Zeiss Axio Observer 
microscope and re-plated (2,000 cells/replicate) every 7–10 days. Primary mouse 
hematopoietic progenitor cells from Vav-tTA shTet2, Rosa-M2rtTA shRen/shTet2 mice in 
combination with Flt3ITD or AE9a were cultured in OpitMEM (GIBCO) with 10% FBS, 100 
U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and recombinant mouse 
SCF (50ng/ml), IL3 (10ng/ml) and IL6 (10ng/ml) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Doxycycline (Dox) 
was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for all cell culture assays. For vitamin C 
treatment, L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) or ascorbate (ASC) was added directly to methylcellulose 
or liquid culture medium at a final concentration of 250 μM unless otherwise indicated. 
Catalase treatment was performed at a concentration of 1unit/ml of medium.
Cell lines—The human leukemia lines HL60, MOLM13, K562, KG1, THP1 and 
KASUMI1 were grown in RPMI (GIBCO). PlatinumE cells used for retroviral transfections 
were maintained in DMEM with 10%–20% FBS. Media were supplemented wtih 100 U/mL 
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and cultures were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Patient samples—Diagnostic BM aspirates were obtained from AML patients treated at 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) or Princess Margaret Cancer Center 
(PMCC). All samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent. The use of 
human materials was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of MSKCC and Princess 
Margaret Cancer Center in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
Primary AML colony formation and liquid differentiation assays—Blasts 
(SSClow, CD45int, CD99high) and residual HSPC (SSClow, CD45int, CD34+, CD38-, 
CD99low) from primary AML specimens were double FACS–sorted to > 95% purity and 
seeded in methylcellulose (MethoCult H4435, Stem Cell Technologies). After 14 days, 
colonies were counted under an Olympus BX41 microscope. For liquid differentiation 
assays, sorted cells were plated at 1×106/mL in Stem Span (Stem Cell Technologies) media, 
supplemented with human cytokines that support monocyte/macrophage differentiation: 
SCF (50 ng/mL), IL-3 (10 ng/mL), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3–ligand (FLT3-L; 50 ng/mL), 
G-CSF (10 ng/mL) (Peprotech). After 7 days, immunophenotypic analysis was performed 
by flow cytometry for CD14 expression.
Xenotransplantation—Experiments were carried out in accordance with institutional 
guidelines approved by MSKCC. NSGS (6–10 weeks-old) mice were bred under pathogen-

 free conditions. For xenotransplantation, mice were sub-lethally irradiated (200–250 cGy) 
3–24 hr before transplantation by direct intrafemoral injection. CD34+ cells purified by 
immunomagnetic selection from viably frozen patient bone marrow or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (Miltenyi Biotec) were used as the source of cells for xenografts. CBC 
analysis was performed on peripheral blood collected from submandibular bleeding using a 
Procyte Dx Hematology Analyzer (IDEXX Veterinary Diagnostics).
METHOD DETAILS
Immunohistochemistry and microscopy—Tissues were dissected from mice for 
fixation overnight in 10% formalin (Fisher). Fixed tissues were dehydrated and embedded in 
paraffin for sectioning. Paraffin sections (5 μm) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) (Leica Autostainer XL). For immunohistochemistry, GFP or TurboGFP 
antibodies (ThermoFisher) were used and counterstained with hematoxylin. Fluorescence 
imaging and light microscopy were performed by using a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope.
Flow cytometry—Single cell suspensions were prepared from bone marrow, spleen or 
peripheral blood. Red blood cells were lysed with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) 
buffer, and the remaining cells were resuspended in PBS with 3% FBS. Non-specific 
antibody binding was blocked by incubation with 20 μg/ml Rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 
min, and cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min on ice. For 5hmC 
detection, cells were fixed at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized 
with 0.2% Triton X-100, denatured with 2N HCl, neutralized with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 
8.0, and incubated with anti-5hmC (1:400) or isotype control antibodies for 30 min. Cells 
were then washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor 
594 (1:500) for 30 min, washed again and resuspended in PBS for flow cytometry. For 
detection of ROS activity, the cell permeable cloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate 
(CM-H2DCFDA) reagent was used (0.3 μM for Tet2-deficient cells or 1 μM for human 
AML cell lines). Upon oxidation, CM-H2DCFDA is converted to 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein 
(DCF), which is then detected by fluorescence spectroscopy (excitation/emission spectra of 
495nm/529nm, respectively). Stained cells were quantified using a BD Fortessa analyzer or 
isolated with a MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) or BD ARIA II. FlowJo software 
(TreeStar) was used to generate flow cytometry plots.
Bone marrow competitive transplantation—Freshly dissected femurs and tibiae were 
isolated from donor Vav-tTA, Tet2+/+ or Tet2−/− (CD45.2+), as well as Tet2+/+ (CD45.1+) 
mice. Bones were flushed with PBS using a 22.5 gauge needle, and the isolate was 
centrifuged (5 min, 0.5g, 4°C) and treated with red cell lysis buffer, as described above. 
Total nucleated bone marrow cells were re-suspended in PBS, passed through a 40 μM cell 
strainer and counted. Donor cells (0.5 × 106 per genotype, per mouse) were mixed 1:1 with 
support bone marrow cells (CD 45.1+), and transplanted via retro-orbital injection into 
lethally irradiated (2 × 550 Rad) CD45.1+ recipient mice. Chimerism was monitored by 
flow cytometry (anti-CD45.1 and anti-CD45.2, BD Bioscience) of peripheral blood at 4-
week intervals post-transplant for 20 weeks, at which time mice were sacrificed and 
chimerism was assessed in other hematopoietic compartments (bone marrow and spleen).

 Retroviral transduction—Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were isolated by 
sorting Lin–cKit+Sca1+ cells, cultured in the presence of 50 ng/ml SCF, 50 ng/ml Flt3 
ligand, 10 ng/ml IL-3, and 10 ng/ml IL-6, and infected with concentrated supernatants of 
AML-ETO9a-IRES-mCherry retrovirus after 24 and 48 hr. Transduction efficiency was 
determined by reporter fluorescence at 96 hr, and 2,000 sorted cKit+ cells were plated in 
methylcellulose media (M3434) for colony formation assays, as described above.
Cell viability and cell cycle—Apoptosis assays were performed by staining with 
Annexin V (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, in combination 
with DAPI. The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell viability assay kit (Promega), which is 
based on luminescent quantification of ATP, was also used to assess relative viability of cell 
cultures. For cell cycle studies, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 
0.2% saponin and stained with 2 μg/ml DAPI prior to flow cytometric analysis.
Quantitative RNA expression assays—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the 
RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA quantity and quality were determined by using an 
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA-seq libraries were prepared from total RNA by polyA 
selection using oligo-dT beads (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The resulting poly A+ RNA served as input for library construction using 
standard Illumina protocols. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 
sequencer using 50 bp single reads. For mRNA quantification, total RNA was used for 
cDNA synthesis using Superscript III first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR 
reactions were carried out using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) and a Lightcycler 480 II 
(Roche).
RNA sequencing analysis—Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted to 
FASTQ format by using Illumina bcl2fastq software. Sequencing reads were aligned to the 
human or mouse genomes, as appropriate (build hg19/GRCh37 and mm10/GRCm38, 
respectively), by using the splice-aware STAR aligner [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/23104886]. The featureCounts program [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
24227677] was utilized to generate counts for each gene based on how many aligned reads 
overlapped its exons. For sequencing depth and alignment results summary see Tables S4 
and S5. Counts were then normalized and used to test for differential expression by using 
negative binomial generalized linear models, as implemented by the DESeq2 R package 
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516281].
Gene set enrichment analysis—Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using 
gene set as permutation type, 1,000 permutations and log2 ratio of classes, or with gene set 
and Signal2Noise as metrics for ranking genes. Gene sets used in this study were identified 
from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB Curated v4.0). Gene pathways and 
functions were assessed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN Bioinformatics).
Global DNA methylation quantitation—DNA samples were isolated by proteinase K 
digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA was denatured, and 2-fold serial dilutions 
were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane in an assembled Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). 
The blotted membrane was washed, air-dried, baked for 2hrs, blocked with 5% TBS-T, and

 incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-5hmC, anti-5fC, or anti-5caC antibodies or mouse 
monoclonal anti-5mC antibody (1:1000) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG 
secondary antibodies (1:3000). ELISAs for 5hmC and 5mC were performed using 
MethylFlash hydroxymethylated and methylated DNA quantification kits (colorimetric, 
Epigentek), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Bisulfite sequencing—Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from mouse HSPCs and 
human AML cells grown in vitro. DNA methylation sequencing was performed and 
analyzed using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) methodology, as 
described previously (Gu et al., 2011). Oxidative bisulfite treatment was performed by using 
a TruMethyl-Seq Kit (CEGX) to generate oxRRBS libraries. The amplified libraries were 
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 with 50 bp single-end reads, following standard 
Illumina sequencing protocols. Primary and downstream data analyses, including calculation 
of differential methylation, were performed using Methylkit (Akalin et al., 2012).
Bisulfite sequencing analysis—Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted 
to FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The sequencing reads were quality- and 
adaptor-trimmed using Trim Galore [https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
trim_galore/] in RRBS mode. The trimmed reads were aligned to the human or mouse 
genomes (build hg19/GRCh37 and mm10/GRCm38, respectively), as appropriate, by using 
Bismark [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21493656] with Bowtie 2 aligner [https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22388286]. Bismark also was used for methylation calls. 
Differential methylation analysis and annotation was performed with the methylKit R 
package [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034086]. For tiling windows analysis, the 
genome was divided into 500 bp windows, and methylation information was summarized for 
each tile. Regions with low coverage (below 50X) or very high coverage (above 99.9th 
percentile) were discarded (for sequencing depth and alignment results summary see Tables 
S6 and S7).
5-hydroxymethylcytosine DNA immunoprecipitation (5hmeDIP), sequencing 
and analysis—Genomic DNA (0.5 μg) isolated from HL60 human AML cells was 
sonicated using a Covaris sonicator followed by end-repair, A-tailing and adaptor ligation 
using standard Illumina protocols. Ten percent (10%) of the input volume was retained prior 
to immunoprecipitation with anti-5hmC antibodies (1 μg/ml, Active Motif) at 4°C overnight. 
Immunoprecipitated DNA was recovered on protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen), and 
DNA was purified from input and immunoprecipitated samples using Ampure beads, after 
proteinase K digestion followed by PCR amplification of libraries.
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. Sequencing results were 
demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ format by using Illumina bcl2fastq. Reads were 
aligned to the human genome (build hg19/GRCh37) with Bowtie 2 [https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22388286] using local alignment. Only confidently mapped 
reads (mapping quality > 30) were retained. Duplicate reads were discarded using Picard 
[http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/]. MACS [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
18798982] was utilized to perform peak calling with a q-value cutoff of 0.05. The R 
Bioconductor package DiffBind [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/

 DiffBind.html] was used for identifying sites that are differentially bound between sample 
groups. The differential analysis method was set to use the DESeq2 package for more 
conservative full library size normalization and to avoid the assumption that most of the sites 
are not differentially bound. Profile plots of enrichment at genomic intervals were generated 
using deepTools [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799436]. Sequencing depth and 
alignment results are summarized in Table S8.
