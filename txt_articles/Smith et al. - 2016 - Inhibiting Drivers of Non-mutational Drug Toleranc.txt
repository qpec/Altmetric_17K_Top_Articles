SUMMARY
Once melanomas have progressed with acquired resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-
targeted therapy, mutational heterogeneity presents a major challenge. We therefore examined the therapy
phase before acquired resistance had developed and discovered the melanoma survival oncogene MITF as a
driver of an early non-mutational and reversible drug-tolerance state, which is induced by PAX3-mediated
upregulation of MITF. A drug-repositioning screen identified the HIV1-protease inhibitor nelfinavir as potent
suppressor of PAX3 and MITF expression. Nelfinavir profoundly sensitizes BRAF and NRAS mutant mela-
noma cells to MAPK-pathway inhibitors. Moreover, nelfinavir is effective in BRAF and NRAS mutant mela-
noma cells isolated from patients progressed on MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy and in BRAF/NRAS/
PTEN mutant tumors. We demonstrate that inhibiting a driver of MAPKi-induced drug tolerance could
improve current approaches of targeted melanoma therapy.
INTRODUCTION
The identification of the vast genetic heterogeneity in tumors of
cancer patients progressed on targeted therapy (Burrell et al.,
2013) reveals a major challenge and emphasizes the need to
improve effectiveness of treatment before mutational acquired
resistance prevails. Clearly, there is room for improvement and
in melanoma this is highlighted by the observed increase in
progression-free survival in BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination
therapies compared with BRAF inhibitor monotherapies (Larkin
et al., 2014; Long et al., 2015).
In BRAF mutant melanoma cells, BRAF is the driver of cellular
signaling — the prerequisite to BRAF-targeted therapy (Salama
and Flaherty, 2013). Moreover, in a patient who shows a signifi-
cant response to BRAF inhibitors, BRAF-driven cells must be
dominating the tumor(s) at the time of treatment when the drug
affects the majority of cells. This is crucial, because our knowl-
edge about mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling
networks (Lito et al., 2012; von Kriegsheim et al., 2009) suggests
that, in the initial phase of inhibitor treatment, a fairly uniform
response will occur while the BRAF-driven signaling network
readjusts. This readjustment will allow a cell to quickly adapt to
Significance
The immense genetic heterogeneity found in mutational acquired resistance to targeted therapy highlights the need for
more effective treatment before resistance occurs. By focusing on melanomas during the initial response phase of treat-
ment, we discovered that the upregulation of the melanoma survival oncogene MITF drives early drug tolerance. This pro-
cess is reversible; revealing the non-mutational nature of the MITF-mediated drug tolerance. Importantly, we demonstrate
that this non-mutational tolerance phase, which precedes acquired mutational resistance, provides an opportunity for more
effective treatment approaches. By repositioning an HIV drug to target MITF as a driver of MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi)-induced
drug tolerance we identify a clinically relevant approach for melanoma therapy that has the potential to improve initial
responses and delay the onset of resistance.

 the new input. Importantly, it is this uniform response to MAPK-
pathway inhibition that we might be able to take advantage of.
If the driver of this newly established fitness could be targeted
before heterogeneity of acquired resistance develops, this
should significantly prolong responses and hence delay the
occurrence of acquired resistance.
Surprisingly, while enormous effort has gone into understand-
ing the molecular events in mutational acquired resistance, not
much attention has been given to what happens during treat-
ment, particularly during the early phase when patients still
respond to drug treatment with inhibition of the MAPK pathway.
BRAF inhibitor-induced rewiring can occur within the first
24 hr leading to a dampening of the inhibitor effect (Lito et al.,
2012). Other adaptive signaling seen in melanoma cells within
24–48 hr involves an altered oxidative metabolism (Haq et al.,
2013a), increased phosphorylation of AKT (Gopal et al., 2010),
and upregulation of ERBB3 (Abel et al., 2013). Exposure to
MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) for 9–12 days can enrich drug-tolerant
melanoma cell populations that display chromatin modifications
paralleled by upregulation of histone demethylases (Menon
et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2010). Selection for sub-populations
might also occur as seen with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-expressing cells (Sun et al., 2014). Nevertheless, EGFR,
ERBB3, and AKT also display increased expression and/or
phosphorylation in the majority of progressed melanomas
(Abel et al., 2013; Girotti et al., 2013; Long et al., 2014). This sug-
gests that the above-described events are not reversible when
the MAPK pathway becomes re-activated.
We and others have previously reported that the melanoma
transcription factor MITF can provide resistance to MAPK-
pathway inhibitors through various mechanisms, such as
enhancing survival signaling and altering metabolism (Gopal
et al., 2014; Haq et al., 2013a, 2013b; Johannessen et al.,
2013; Smith et al., 2013; Wellbrock and Arozarena, 2015).
Enhanced MITF expression is linked to innate resistance, and
increased MITF expression as well as MITF amplification is found
in some progressed melanomas (Gopal et al., 2014; Ji et al.,
2015; Muller et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2014). Importantly,
not only are MITF focal amplifications significantly linked to the
BRAF mutant melanoma subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas
Network, 2015), but the expression of MITF is also tightly regu-
lated by BRAF-initiated MAPK signaling (Wellbrock and Marais,
2005; Wellbrock et al., 2008). This led us to investigate its poten-
tial involvement in driving increased fitness during the initial
phases of treatment.
RESULTS
MITF Expression Is Upregulated in Response
to Long-Term BRAF and MEK Inhibition
We analyzed melanomas from 11 patients undergoing treatment
with vemurafenib or a dabrafenib/trametinib combination (Table
S1), and found that, within the first 2 weeks of treatment, MITF
expression was upregulated in 9 of 11 patients (Figure 1A). In
all samples, expression of the ERK target DUSP6 was decreased
(Figure S1A), indicating that the MAPK pathway was inhibited,
albeit to different degrees. The upregulation of MITF correlated
with increased expression of its target genes TYR and MLANA
(Figure S1A), which is in line with previous observations of
increased melanoma differentiation antigen expression on treat-
ment (Frederick et al., 2013), and indicates that MITF is func-
tional. We also observed MITF and target gene upregulation in
BrafV600E mouse melanoma allografts in syngeneic mice treated
with an MEK inhibitor, as well as in human BRAFV600E melanoma
xenografts grown in mice treated with either a BRAF inhibitor or
an MEK inhibitor, and again this correlated with downregulation
of DUSP6 expression (Figures 1B and S1B).
To analyze the consequences of this upregulation, we iso-
lated A375-GFP melanoma cells from tumor-bearing mice
treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (100 mg/kg) for
12 days, at which point the tumor response was reaching a
plateau (Figure 1C). Confirming our previous observations,
the cells isolated from vemurafenib-treated tumors expressed
increased MITF when compared with cells isolated from
vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 1D). Importantly, the cells that
had been exposed to the drug in the tumors of treated mice
were more tolerant to BRAF inhibition than cells isolated from
untreated tumors, with an over 10-fold increase in the concen-
tration causing 50% of maximal growth inhibition (GI50) (Fig-
ure 1E). Moreover, in agreement with the previously described
function of MITF in resistance to MAPK inhibitors (Haq et al.,
2013b; Johannessen et al., 2013; Muller et al., 2014; Smith
et al., 2013), depletion of MITF rendered drug-tolerant A375-
GFP cells sensitive again (Figure 1F). Notably, after drug
removal the upregulation of MITF seen in A375-GFP cells was
reversible in vivo as well as in vitro (Figure 1G). The latter was

 also seen in A375-T cells, in vitro long-term MEK inhibitor-
treated A375 cells, which are tolerant when on drug treatment,
but become sensitive again when off treatment (Figures S1C–
S1E). These observations are crucial as it demonstrates that
in order for MITF to provide tolerance to MAPK inhibitors, no
mutational event is required.
Our data suggest that a buildup of MITF expression occurs
as a direct adaptive response to MAPKi treatment during a
tolerance phase (Figure 1H). This phase of pathway inhibition
and rewiring precedes acquired resistance, and, importantly,
recent data suggest that during this phase, rewired cells can
support the outgrowth of mutated clones with inherent resis-
tance, thereby contributing to the establishment of acquired
resistance (Obenauf et al., 2015). Indeed, drug-tolerant A375-
GFP cells display increased expression of genes characteristic
for rewired cells (Figure S1F). In our model (Figure 1H), mutated
clones that display cell-autonomous resistance will eventually
re-establish tumor growth. Many (mutated) drivers of acquired
resistance, often leading to pathway reactivation and profound
heterogeneity, have been identified. However, our data sug-
gest that increased MITF is driving an early drug-tolerance
phase.

A Drug Screen to Target PAX3 and
MITF as Potential Drivers of Early
Drug Tolerance Identifies Nelfinavir
With the idea that targeting the MITF
buildup would affect the tolerance phase
and thus delay the onset of acquired resistance, we embarked
on identifying the cause of MITF upregulation in response to
MAPKi. We assessed crucial regulators of MITF in biopsies
from patients on treatment, and found a significant correlation
of MITF transcripts with the expression of the paired-box tran-
scription factor PAX3 (Figure 2A). Thus, PAX3, a well-known
transcriptional regulator of MITF (Kubic et al., 2008), is upregu-
lated during MAPKi treatment, which is also seen within 48 hr
in a panel of BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines (Figure 2B). The
upregulation of PAX3 was paralleled by MITF, but its upregula-
tion was only marginal during this time in cell lines expressing
low basal MITF levels (A375, WM266-4) (Figure 2B). Never-
theless, MITF expression increases at later time points (see
A375-T, Figure 1G) and this delay is due to a complex competi-
tive regulation of the MITF promoter involving additional tran-
scriptional regulators (Wellbrock et al., 2008). This delay is also
seen at protein level in A735 cells, where depletion of PAX3 in
the presence of MEK inhibitor strongly suppresses MITF expres-
sion (Figure 2C).
PAX3 expression is highly enriched in cutaneous melanoma
compared with >170 other cancer types (Figure 2D). In addition,
we have shown previously that reduced PAX3 expression

 sensitizes melanoma cells to MEK inhibitors (Smith et al., 2013).
These findings make the PAX3-MITF axis a good target to coun-
teract MITF-driven drug tolerance. We performed an immuno-
fluorescence-based screen using a library of 640 US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to identify com-
pounds that will target PAX3 and MITF expression (Figure S2A).
We also assessed melanoma cell survival in response to the
drug library and set a threshold at the effect on survival induced
by RNAi-mediated depletion of PAX3 or MITF, respectively (Fig-
ures 2E and 2F). For PAX3 expression we set a threshold of a
Z score of �10, which led to the identification of 18 drugs result-
ing in significant downregulation of PAX3 expression. For MITF
expression we set a threshold of a Z score of �5, because we
wanted to account for delayed effects on MITF with it being a
PAX3 target gene.
Applying these criteria, we identified seven drugs that reduced
both PAX3 and MITF expression (Figures 2E and 2F, and S2B).
Among these drugs nelfinavir mesylate, an HIV1-protease
inhibitor that had shown anti-neoplastic activity (Chow et al.,
2009), had the strongest effect on the expression of both PAX3
and MITF.
PAX3 and MITF Suppression Is Required for Nelfinavir-
Induced Growth Inhibition
Nelfinavir efficiently suppressed PAX3 and MITF expression in
a panel of BRAF mutant melanoma cells (Figures 3A and B)
and reduced the GI50 for the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in drug-
tolerant A375 melanoma cells (A375-T) by �60-fold, comparable
with the GI50 in sensitive cells (Figure 3C). Moreover, the GI50 of
nelfinavir correlates with PAX3 and MITF expression levels (Fig-
ures S3A), and ectopic overexpression of PAX3 or MITF rescued,
whereas MITF depletion enhanced the growth inhibition induced
by nelfinavir and MEK inhibition (Figures 3D and 3E, and S3B–
S3D). Together, this indicates that suppression of PAX3 and
MITF is contributing to the growth inhibitory effects.
We next aimed to identify how nelfinavir affects PAX3 and
MITF expression. MITF mRNA levels were reduced within 24 hr
of nelfinavir treatment (Figure 3F), suggesting that PAX3 regu-
lates MITF transcription and is the nelfinavir target. To assess
events upstream of PAX3, we analyzed phosphatidylinositol 3
(PI3)-kinase/AKT signaling and HSP90 activity as they can be
targeted by nelfinavir (Gantt et al., 2013; Gills et al., 2007; Shim
and Liu, 2014). However, we did not observe loss of AKT phos-
phorylation or changes in the HSP90 client protein AKT at times
when reduced PAX3 expression occurred (Figure S3E). Further-
more, there was no effect on BRAF protein levels in cells ex-
pressing BRAFV600E (Figure S3F), another HSP90 client protein
(da Rocha Dias et al., 2005). These findings confirm previous
data that nelfinavir does not target PI3-kinase signaling in mela-
noma cells (Jiang et al., 2007), and rules out an involvement of
HSP90 in the inhibitory effect of nelfinavir on PAX3 protein levels.
Moreover, nelfinavir affects PAX3 mRNA expression (Figure 3G),
suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of PAX3 is sup-
pressed by nelfinavir.
Nelfinavir Suppresses PAX3 Expression through
SMAD2/4 and SKI
In melanocytes, the transcriptional co-suppressor SKI regulates
expression from the PAX3 promoter. This is controlled by trans-
forming growth factor b (TGF-b), which induces SMAD2 phos-
phorylation and the formation of a SMAD2/4/SKI repressor com-
plex (Yang et al., 2008). Melanoma cells, however, often display
constitutive activation of TGF-b signaling, and this is reflected in
a steady-state presence of nuclear phospho-SMAD2 (Figure 4A).
Nelfinavir increased the amount of SMAD2 and consequently
nuclear phospho-SMAD2 in melanoma cell lines in the absence
of exogenous TGF-b (Figures 4A and 4B), and, importantly, this
correlated with the reduction in PAX3 and MITF expression
(Figure 4B).
For SMAD2 to act as suppressor for PAX3 it requires SKI (Xu
et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2008), and we detected SMAD2 in SKI
immunoprecipitates from melanoma cells under steady-state
conditions (Figure 4C). Nelfinavir treatment increased the recruit-
ment of not only SMAD2 but also SMAD4 to SKI (Figure 4D) and
the recruitment of SKI to the PAX3 promoter (Figure 4E). The
suppressor function of SKI is maintained in melanoma, where
its overexpression led to a reduction and its depletion to an in-
crease in PAX3 and MITF expression (Figures 4F and 4G, S4A
and S4B). Likewise the overexpression of SMAD2 suppressed
PAX3 expression (Figures 4F and S4C), and while depletion of
SMAD4 or SMAD2 increased PAX3 levels, nelfinavir was not
able to effectively suppress PAX3 in the absence of the SMADs
(Figures 4H and S4D and S4E).
MEK Regulates the SKI-Mediated Suppression of PAX3
Because we had identified the SMAD2/4/SKI complex as
relevant for the inhibitory action of nelfinavir on PAX3 transcrip-
tion, and nelfinavir counteracted the MAPKi-induced tolerance
in melanoma cells (see Figure 3C), we wanted to identify the
link between the SMAD/SKI suppressor complex and MAPK
signaling.
ERK can regulate SMAD function at various levels in TGF-b
signaling, but we did not detect any effect of MEK inhibition
on SMAD2 steady state or TGF-b-induced nuclear localization,
or TGF-b-stimulated transcription of SPARC or VEGF in mela-
noma cells (Figures S5A and S5B). However, MEK activity
was relevant for the TGF-b-mediated suppression of PAX3 (Fig-
ure S5B). This suggested a link between MEK and the transcrip-
tional co-suppressor SKI, and indeed BRAF or MEK inhibition
reduced SKI protein and mRNA levels in melanoma cells (Fig-
ures 5A and 5B). Furthermore, SKI overexpression from an
ectopic promoter prevented the upregulation of PAX3 expres-
sion otherwise seen when the MAPK pathway is inhibited (Fig-
ures 5C and 5D). Similar results were found with SMAD2, whose
overexpression also enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of
MEK inhibition (Figures S5C and S5D). Thus, our data suggest
a mechanism whereby BRAF and MEK stimulate the expres-
sion of SKI, which together with SMAD2 suppresses the PAX3
promoter. However, inhibition of BRAF or MEK relieves the
SKI suppressor activity and increases PAX3 transcription, which
will eventually increase MITF expression. In line with this, SKI
recruitment to the PAX3 promoter is reduced in the presence
of an MEK inhibitor and this is counteracted by nelfinavir (see
Figure 4E).
The individual functional links supporting such a mechanism
were seen in vivo in A375 tumors, where reduced SKI expression
correlated with increased PAX3 and MITF expression in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 5E). Moreover, we observed a similar
274

 correlation in patients on MAPKi treatment. SKI expression was
reduced in nine patients and this was correlated with an upregu-
lation of PAX3 and MITF expression (Figure 5F). However, in two
patients SKI expression was not reduced and PAX3 and MITF
expression dropped below the initial expression levels before
treatment (Figure 5F).

 In line with the idea that the observed PAX3/MITF response is
a consequence of MAPK-pathway inhibition and as such occurs
while patients are still responding to treatment, we found that in
tumors from our cohort of patients whose melanoma had pro-
gressed, PAX3 and MITF expression were generally reduced
and SKI expression was restored (Figures S5E and S5F). This
correlated with the recovery of DUSP6 expression and ERK
phosphorylation in three available patient samples (Figure S5G),
suggesting pathway reactivation in these tumors. A similar corre-
lation was seen in gene expression datasets (Figure S5H) derived
from two different patient cohorts (Long et al., 2014; Rizos et al.,
2014). Analysis of these datasets further revealed increased
PAX3 and MITF expression in �40% and �23% of progressed
tumors, respectively (Figures S5I and S5J, and 5G). However,
analysis of all ‘‘on treatment’’ datasets found that �80% of
tumors display upregulated PAX3/MITF expression before pro-
gression (Figure 5G).
Nelfinavir Sensitizes to BRAF and MEK Inhibition in
BRAF Mutant Melanoma
Because nelfinavir efficiently suppresses PAX3 and MITF expres-
sion, we wanted to assess its function in MAPK-pathway-target-
ing therapy. MITF is a crucial regulator of G1/S transition, and
accordingly PAX3 and MITF depletion as well as nelfinavir treat-
ment resulted in a G1 arrest (Figures S6A and S6B). However,
MAPKi combination treatment induced cell death and reduced
cell numbers in a synergistic manner in BRAF mutant melanoma
cell lines, but not in the BRAF mutant/MITF-negative colon can-
cer cell line RKO (Figures 6A and 6B). Furthermore, the GI50 for
combination treatments increased with enhanced PAX3 and
MITF expression (Figure S6C). The presence of nelfinavir during
a 3-week treatment of drug-tolerant A375-GFP cells #026 and
#549 (isolated from BRAF inhibitor-treated mice, see Figure 1C)
with MAPKis overcame the development of resistant clones
(Figure 6C). In a short-term zebrafish xenograft assay, combina-
tion treatment resulted in tumor volume reduction (Figure 6D),
demonstrating that nelfinavir can sensitize to the cytotoxic ef-
fects of the inhibitor in vivo. However, the time frame of this exper-
iment does not allow assessing the tolerance phase during which
we have observed PAX3 and MITF upregulation. We therefore
treated mice bearing A375 xenografts with nelfinavir for a period
of 3 weeks. During this time, as seen previously, BRAF inhibition
induced a profound upregulation of both PAX3 and MITF expres-
sion (Figures 6E and 6F). While nelfinavir treatment alone pro-
duced a slight reduction in PAX3 as well as MITF expression, its
combination with a BRAF inhibitor completely abolished the
PAX3 and MITF upregulation (Figures 6D and 6E). This was corre-
lated with MITF target gene expression (Figure S6D) and tumor
growth, where the BRAF inhibitor/nelfinavir combination led to
an over 80% reduction in tumor volume (Figure 6G).
Nelfinavir Sensitizes NRAS Mutant Melanoma to MEK
Inhibition
Because MITF is crucial for the survival of the melanocyte line-
age, we argued that it would also be relevant for NRAS mutant
melanoma cell survival. Indeed, the depletion of MITF from
MITF-expressing NRAS mutant melanoma cells significantly
sensitized these cells to MEK inhibition (Figure 7A). Nelfinavir
also sensitized NRAS mutant melanoma cells to MEK inhibition
and reduced PAX3 and MITF expression, whereas no sensitiza-
tion was seen in the KRAS mutant colon cancer cell line HCT116
(Figures 6B, 7A, and 7B). We next tested two short-term cultures
from a patient with NRASQ61K mutant melanoma progressed on
MEK inhibitor treatment. This patient also carried an MITFE318K
germline mutation, which is linked to increased melanoma
susceptibility (Table S2). Both cultures still responded to MEK in-
hibitor with reduced ERK phosphorylation (Figure 7C), suggest-
ing that the resistance had developed by acquiring additional
survival advantages. Nelfinavir treatment profoundly sensitized
the growth of these cultures to MEK inhibition (Figure 7D).
Nelfinavir Overcomes Mutant NRAS-Mediated Acquired
Resistance
Mutated NRAS is found in �18% of melanomas with acquired
resistance (Shi et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2014). Confirming
previous observations (Nazarian et al., 2010), we found that
in a short-term culture derived from a BRAF-inhibitor-treated
patient, who progressed with a NRASQ61K mutation (Table S2),
a BRAF inhibitor was not efficient in inhibiting ERK phosphoryla-
tion (Figure 8A). MEK inhibition, however, blocked ERK phos-
phorylation and was �10 times more effective in reducing cell
growth than BRAF inhibition (Figure 8A). However, the presence
of nelfinavir increased cell killing by �500-fold compared with
BRAF inhibition (Figure 8A). This increased cytotoxic effect
was also seen at the level of caspase3 cleavage, demonstrating
that nelfinavir enhances the cytotoxic effects of MEK inhibition
(Figure 8B).
We have shown that nelfinavir sensitizes to MAPKi under basal
growth conditions, but also counteracts the MAPKi-induced
upregulation of PAX3 and MITF, which we detect in tumors on
treatment. However, some tumors progress with increased
levels of MITF expression (see Figure 5G). For the BRAFV600E;
NRASQ61K culture, we did not have a paired ‘‘before’’ culture
and hence could not assess whether PAX3 or MITF expression
was increased in the culture from the acquired resistant tumor.
We therefore moved to a more controlled system and used the
previously described in vitro generated resistant M249-R4 cells,
which are derived from BRAFV600E;PTEN�/- M249 cells (Nazarian
et al., 2010). In NRASQ61K-expressing M249-R4 cells, ERK acti-
vation by MEK is resistant to BRAF inhibition, but the cells still
respond to MEK inhibition (Figure 8C). M249-R4 cells express

expression (Figure 8F). While nelfinavir
strongly sensitizes M249 to BRAF inhibi-
tor, M249-R4 cells do not display a major
response (Figure 8G), further confirming
their resistance to BRAF inhibition. How-
ever, nelfinavir increased the sensitivity
to MEK inhibition not only in M249 but
also in M249-R4 cells, where the GI50
was shifted almost 100-fold when nelfi-
navir was present (Figure 8G). Most
importantly however, this sensitization
was also seen in vivo, where the MEK in-
hibitor/nelfinavir combination completely
suppressed tumor growth, even when tumors started to prog-
ress on MEK inhibitor monotherapy (Figure 8H). This was re-
flected in PAX3, MITF, as well as MITF target gene expression

 (Figures 8I and S7), demonstrating that reduced MITF function is
linked to repressed tumor growth.
DISCUSSION
The mutational heterogeneity found in tumors of patients pro-
gressed on targeted therapy implies that additional strategies
to tackle reduced responsiveness to small molecule inhibitor
treatment should be considered. Our data suggest that targeting
a non-mutational tolerance phase preceding acquired muta-
tional resistance can be such a strategy.
Drug-induced tolerance has been reported in cell lines from
various cancer cell types after long-term in vitro treatment,
and this has been linked to chromatin modifications (Sharma
et al., 2010). Comparable observations were made in mela-
noma cell lines treated with sub-lethal concentrations of
vemurafenib (Menon et al., 2015). This resulted in chromatin
modifications paralleled by a distinct expression program
involving the upregulation of stem cell markers and downregu-
lation of differentiation markers like MLANA and TYR, which is
in line with downregulation of MITF. A similar response might

have occurred in the tumors of the two
patients, where we observed a reduction
in MITF expression. We do not know
whether
the
lower
frequency
of
this
response within a 2-week time frame
reflects that losing MITF expression is
not due to a direct signaling response to
MAPK-pathway inhibition, and might be
either an indirect consequence of overall
changes in the epigenetic state over time
or enrichment of MITF-negative cell popu-
lations on treatment. Considerably more
samples from patients on treatment will
be required to validate the frequency of
MITF reduction and to address these
questions.
Nevertheless, in line with others (Gopal et al., 2014; Ji et al.,
2015), we find reduced MITF expression in �50% of tumors on
progression. So far it is unclear what triggers this response,
because we and others find that the other 50% of acquired resis-
tant tumors not only display MITF expression levels comparable
with before treatment, a fraction of patients also relapse with
tumors having greatly increased MITF (Gopal et al., 2014;
Ji et al., 2015), which might be the result of MITF amplification
(Van Allen et al., 2014). We found upregulated MITF expression in
the NRASQ61K-driven M249-R4 cells, and although we do not
know whether MITF can drive acquired resistance, we show
that targeting MITF in acquired resistant cells can sensitize
them to MAPK inhibitors.
Predominant upregulation of MLANA and other MITF target
genes within the first 14 days of treatment with BRAF inhibitor
monotherapy has also been reported in another cohort of
patients (Frederick et al., 2013). Moreover, while the expression
of these melanoma differentiation antigens was back to basal
level in patients on progression, in a patient who then was treated
with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination, the MITF target genes
were again upregulated in response to treatment (Frederick
280
Cancer Cell 29, 270–284, March 14, 2016 ª2016 The Authors
 et al., 2013). This strongly supports the reversible non-mutational
nature of these changes, and also further suggests that MITF
upregulation is a fairly uniform response.
The upregulation of MITF was paralleled by the upregulation
of the transcriptional regulator PAX3 (Kubic et al., 2008). In
adult melanocytes as well as in development, PAX3 expression
is suppressed by TGF-b signaling, and the transcriptional co-
repressor SKI plays a crucial role in this suppression (Xu et al.,
2000; Yang et al., 2008). We identified SKI as an MAPK-regulated
suppressor of PAX3 in melanoma cells. SKI is an important regu-
lator of melanoma growth (Chen et al., 2009), and the elevated
MAPK-pathway activity found in melanomas might contribute

to its increased expression. By suppress-
ing PAX3, SKI counteracts the positive
regulation of the MITF promoter induced
by BRAFV600E through BRN2 (Wellbrock
et al., 2008). SKI thus helps to maintain
the MITF homeostasis downstream of
BRAFV600E required for BRAF-driven mel-
anoma development (Wellbrock and Aro-
zarena, 2015).
We demonstrate that the HIV1-protease inhibitor nelfinavir
targets PAX3 expression by increasing the SMAD2/4/SKI sup-
pressor complex. Nelfinavir induces an increase in SMAD2 levels
within 6 hr, but we have not yet identified the upstream regulator
of this event. Nelfinavir can inhibit the proteasome (Gupta et al.,
2007), which could slow down the turnover of SMAD2. However,
this is unlikely to be the case in melanoma cells, where protea-
some inhibition very effectively increases MITF levels (Wellbrock
and Marais, 2005; Wu et al., 2000), as we observe efficient down-
regulation of MITF. While in various cancer types nelfinavir tar-
gets AKT signaling, the underlying mechanisms in this context
are still a matter of debate (Shim and Liu, 2014). Moreover, a

 previous study analyzing a panel of BRAFV600E melanoma cells
did not detect any reduction in AKT phosphorylation (Jiang
et al., 2007), and we confirm these previous observations. Over-
all, data concerning the mode of action of nelfinavir are conflict-
ing and also appear to be dependent on the cancer cell type.
Nelfinavir induces cell death in various cancer cell lines partly
by triggering ER stress and autophagy (Gills et al., 2007). How-
ever, in melanoma cells we observed a cell-cycle arrest as initial
response, which confirms previous findings of nelfinavir inducing
a G1 arrest and suppressing CDK2 activity in melanoma cells
(Jiang et al., 2007). The latter is striking, because CDK2 itself is
an important MITF target gene (Du et al., 2004). Moreover
MITF controls the expression and activity of G1/S transition
regulators such as p21, p27, and RB (Wellbrock and Arozarena,
2015), all of which have been described to be affected by nelfina-
vir in melanoma cells (Jiang et al., 2007).
The concept of repositioning HIV protease inhibitors such as
nelfinavir for cancer therapy has become of interest ever since
anti-neoplastic activities have been observed with these agents
(Shim and Liu, 2014). Particularly nelfinavir has growth inhibitory
activity in a variety of different cancer types in vitro and in vivo,
and several clinical trials testing nelfinavir are currently ongoing
(Shim and Liu, 2014). While the peak plasma concentration
of nelfinavir in HIV patients is around 8 mM (Markowitz et al.,
1998), using higher doses (without approaching the maximum
tolerated dose) can lead to plasma concentrations around
5–15 mM (Gantt et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2012). Although we do
not know the concentration we achieve in mice at 25 mg/kg/day,
the levels reached in patients are in the range of the concentra-
tion we used (5–10 mM) to sensitize melanoma cells to BRAF or
MEK inhibitor-induced cell death in vitro.
In summary, we show that inhibiting MITF expression by nelfi-
navir has a potent enhancer effect on the action of BRAF and
MEK inhibitors. Moreover, even in cells that do not display
elevated expression of MITF, its relevance for melanoma cell sur-
vival appears to be sufficient for inhibitor sensitization. Our data
suggest that apart from increasing initial responses also in NRAS
mutant patients, the nelfinavir/MEK inhibitor combination could
restore the MAPK inhibitor response in patients relapsed with
increased NRAS signaling. Thus, by targeting a cancer-type-
specific master regulator that plays an important role in the initial
phases of drug-induced tolerance, we identify a clinical relevant
approach for melanoma therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
For more detailed information see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Patient Samples and In Vivo Work
Patients with mutant BRAFV600-positive metastatic melanoma were treated
with either a BRAF inhibitor, or a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors
(for patient characteristics see Table S1). All patients consented for tissue
acquisition as per an institutional-review-board-approved protocol (Office
for Human Research Studies, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center). Tumor
biopsies were obtained before treatment (day 0), at 10–14 days on treat-
ment, and/or at time of progression if applicable. All animal procedures
involving animals were ethically approved by University of Manchester
Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Bodies (AWERB) and carried out under
license in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Proce-
dures) Act (1986) and guidelines of the Committee of the National Cancer
Research Institute.
RNA Isolation and qPCR Analysis
RNA from cell lines or frozen tumor tissue was isolated with TRIZOL and
selected genes were amplified by qRT-PCR using either SYBR green (Qiagen)
or TaqMan probes.
Cell Culture Treatments and Drug Dose-Response Analysis
All melanoma cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium/10% fetal calf serum (PAA). Cell numbers were measured as the
optical density at 595 nm (OD595) of solubilized crystal violet from formalin-
fixed cells. For all in vitro experiments vemurafenib was used as BRAF
inhibitor. Different MEK inhibitors (PD184352, selumetinib, and trametinib)
were used and are specified in the figure legends. For dose-response
curves, cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with serial dilutions
of the indicated drugs. The GI50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism
version 6.00.
Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by standard western
blotting protocols. Primary antibodies were as follows: MITF (C5), Neo-
markers, Lab Vision; phospho-ERK (MAPK-YT), Sigma; ERK2 (C-14), PAX3
(N-19), BRAF (F-7), and SKI (H-329), Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and
SMAD2, pSMAD2, SMAD4, pAKT (S473), and Caspase 3, Cell Signaling
Technology.
Statistical Analysis
Data represent the results for assays performed in triplicate, with error bars to
represent SD or SEM. Statistics used were as follows: predominately Stu-
dent’s t test and one-way ANOVA with Tukeys’s post hoc test performed using
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Mac OS, GraphPad Software. Pearson cor-
relation was used to analyze associated gene expression and Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test to analyze tumor growth. Throughout the text: *p < 0.05; **p <
