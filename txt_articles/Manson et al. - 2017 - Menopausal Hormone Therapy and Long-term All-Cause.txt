IMPORTANCE Health outcomes from the Women’s Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin
and Estrogen-Alone Trials have been reported, but previous publications have generally not
focused on all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
OBJECTIVE To examine total and cause-specific cumulative mortality, including during the
intervention and extended postintervention follow-up, of the 2 Women’s Health Initiative
hormone therapy trials.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational follow-up of US multiethnic
postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled in 2 randomized clinical trials between
1993 and 1998 and followed up through December 31, 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA, 2.5 mg/d) (n = 8506) vs placebo (n = 8102) for 5.6 years (median) or CEE
alone (n = 5310) vs placebo (n = 5429) for 7.2 years (median).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cause-specific
mortality (cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, and other major causes of
mortality) in the 2 trials pooled and in each trial individually, with prespecified analyses by
10-year age group based on age at time of randomization.
RESULTS Among 27 347 women who were randomized (baseline mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.2]
years; 80.6% white), mortality follow-up was available for more than 98%. During the
cumulative 18-year follow-up, 7489 deaths occurred (1088 deaths during the intervention
phase and 6401 deaths during postintervention follow-up). All-cause mortality was 27.1% in
the hormone therapy group vs 27.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% CI,
0.94-1.03]) in the overall pooled cohort; with CEE plus MPA, the HR was 1.02 (95% CI,
0.96-1.08); and with CEE alone, the HR was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-1.01). In the pooled cohort for
cardiovascular mortality, the HR was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92-1.08 [8.9 % with hormone therapy vs
9.0% with placebo]); for total cancer mortality, the HR was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.95-1.12 [8.2 %
with hormone therapy vs 8.0% with placebo]); and for other causes, the HR was 0.95 (95%
CI, 0.88-1.02 [10.0% with hormone therapy vs 10.7% with placebo]), and results did not
differ significantly between trials. When examined by 10-year age groups comparing younger
women (aged 50-59 years) to older women (aged 70-79 years) in the pooled cohort, the ratio
of nominal HRs for all-cause mortality was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.43-0.87) during the intervention
phase and the ratio was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-1.00) during cumulative 18-year follow-up,
without significant heterogeneity between trials.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among postmenopausal women, hormone therapy with CEE
plus MPA for a median of 5.6 years or with CEE alone for a median of 7.2 years was not
associated with risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or cancer mortality during a cumulative
follow-up of 18 years.

 T
he Women’
s Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy
trials were designed to assess the benefits and risks of
menopausal hormone therapy taken for chronic dis-
ease prevention by predominantly healthy postmenopausal
women.1-3 The double-blinded, placebo-controlled, random-
ized clinical trials, conducted among US postmenopausal
womenaged50to79yearsatenrollment,testedthemostcom-
mon formulations of hor-
mone therapy prescribed
at the time of study initia-
tion: conjugated equine
estrogens (CEE) plus me-
droxyprogesterone ac-
etate (MPA) for women
with an intact uterus and CEE alone for women with hyster-
ectomy. The CEE plus MPA trial was stopped early (after 5.6
years) due to an increased risk of breast cancer and overall risks
exceeding benefits2; the CEE-alone trial was stopped after 7.2
years due to an increased risk of stroke.3 Postintervention fol-
low up has been ongoing.
Health outcomes, including all-cause mortality from the
2 hormone therapy trials, have been reported,2-7 but previ-
ous publications have not focused on all-cause and cause-
specific mortality. Moreover, the current report includes ex-
tended follow-up and mortality surveillance of the entire
randomized cohort using the National Death Index (NDI; 7489
deathsthroughDecember31,2014).Hormonetherapyhasbeen
shown to have a complex balance of benefits and risks with
important effects on numerous outcomes—some of which dif-
fer between the 2 hormone therapy formulations.2,3,6 All-
causemortalityisacriticallyimportantsummarymeasurerep-
resenting the net effect of hormone therapy on serious and
life-threatening health conditions. Thus, we examined total
and cause-specific mortality during cumulative 18-year fol-
low-up (intervention plus extended postintervention phases)
of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trials, individually and pooled,
with attention to potential differences by age.
Methods
Study Design
Details of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trial designs, adher-
ence, and outcome adjudication procedures (including for
mortality) have been previously published (trial protocol in
Supplement 1).1-3,6 Briefly, 27 347 postmenopausal women
ages 50 to 79 years were recruited from 1993 to 1998 at
40 US clinical centers; 16 608 women with a uterus were
randomized to receive daily oral CEE (0.625 mg) plus MPA
(2.5 mg, Prempro) or placebo and 10 739 women with hyster-
ectomy were randomized to receive daily oral CEE
(0.625 mg, Premarin) alone or placebo. The primary out-
comes of both trials were incident coronary heart disease
and invasive breast cancer.1 Institutional review board
approval was obtained at each center and all participants
provided written informed consent. Race and ethnicity were
self-reported. Postintervention follow-up included deaths
through December 31, 2014 (median, 18 years cumulatively),
with mortality ascertained by regular surveillance of the
cohort through the NDI and by reports of next of kin or the
postal service. NDI searches were conducted at 7 time points
before 2015 for all participants who had unknown vital sta-
tus. Some hazard ratios (HRs) may differ slightly from those
previously reported due to more complete mortality ascer-
tainment in the present report. After the trials were stopped,
participants were unmasked to randomization assignment
and fewer than 4% of women reported personal posttrial
hormone therapy use.
Statistical Analysis
For each trial, cumulative analyses included all randomized
participantsaccordingtotheirrandomizationassignmentfrom
time of randomization until death or December 31, 2014, the
last date covered by the NDI linkage, based on the intention-
to-treatprinciple.Mortalityendpointsincludedall-causemor-
tality (primary analysis); cardiovascular disease (CVD) mor-
tality (further subdivided into deaths from coronary heart
disease, stroke, and other known CVD); cancer mortality (sub-
divided into deaths from breast, colorectal, and other known
cancers);andothermortality(basedontheotherleadingcauses
of death in women including Alzheimer disease or other de-
mentia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], inju-
ries and accidents, and other known causes). HRs were esti-
mated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age
and randomization status in the WHI Dietary Modification
Trial. Preplanned analyses included presentation of cumula-
tive and intervention-phase HRs and forest plots for each trial
separately, as well as for the pooled trials unless the P value
for heterogeneity between trials was less than .05 (eTables 1-3
in Supplement 2). HRs may exhibit time dependencies within
or between phases as previously reported.4,5
Age subgroup analyses were preplanned for the major
mortality end points. Interactions between randomization
group and age stratum were based on a 1 degree-of-freedom
test for linear trend; 10-year age groups (based on age at time
of randomization) were assigned a continuous value (0,1, 2).
HRs for younger vs older age groups were also directly com-
pared as ratios.
Statistical tests were based on a 2-sided log-rank (score)
test. Nominal (unadjusted) P values are provided and those of
CEE conjugated equine estrogens
COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease
CVD cardiovascular disease
MPA medroxyprogesterone acetate
Key Points
Question What is the relationship between use of menopausal
hormone therapy vs placebo for 5 to 7 years and mortality over 18
years of follow-up?
Findings Among postmenopausal women who participated in 2
parallel randomized trials of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen
alone, all-cause mortality rates for the overall cohort in the pooled
trials were not significantly different for the hormone therapy
groups vs the placebo groups (27.1% vs 27.6%; hazard ratio, 0.99
[95% CI, 0.94-1.03]).
Meaning Menopausal hormone therapy for 5 to 7 years was not
associated with risk of long-term all-cause mortality.

 less than .05 were considered statistically significant. How-
ever, P values should be interpreted cautiously due to mul-
tiple comparisons. Sensitivity analyses were restricted to par-
ticipants who took more than 80% of study pills (active or
placebo) for at least 2 years or until death. All statistical analy-
ses were conducted using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS In-
stitute Inc) and R software version 2.15 (R Foundation for Sta-
tistical Computing, http://www.r-project.org/).
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Study Follow-up Periods
Baseline characteristics for the 2 randomization groups in each
trial were well balanced on demographic and clinical risk fac-
tors (Table). The CEE plus MPA trial ended in July 2002 (after
a median of 5.6 years),2,6 and the CEE-alone trial ended in Feb-
ruary 2004 (after a median of 7.2 years).3,6 The present report
isbasedonmortalityfollow-upthroughDecember31,2014(end
of the last NDI search), and includes 7489 deaths (1088 oc-
curred during the intervention phase and 6401 occurred post-
intervention; 4083 additional deaths since the last report). In
addition to the intervention phases, the results reported in this
study include median postintervention follow-up of 12.5 years
and cumulative follow-up of 18 years for the CEE plus MPA trial
and a median postintervention follow-up of 10.8 years and cu-
mulativefollow-upof18yearsfortheCEE-alonetrial(Figure1).
Mortality is more than 98% complete, based on NDI
evaluation.8
All-Cause Mortality
Cumulative Follow-up Phase
Duringcumulative18-yearfollow-up,all-causemortalityinthe
overall pooled cohort was 27.1% with hormone therapy vs
27.6% with placebo (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.03]; P = .60). For
theindividualtrials,all-causemortalitywas26.4%forCEEplus
MPA vs 26.0% for placebo (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96-1.08];
P = .51), and for CEE alone it was 28.3% vs 30.0% for placebo
(HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88-1.01]; P = .11) (Figure 2; eTable 1 in
Supplement 2).
Intervention and Postintervention Phases
Duringtheinterventionphase,all-causemortalityinthepooled
cohort was 4.0% with hormone therapy vs 4.0% with pla-
cebo (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.90-1.14]; P = .86; eFigure and eTable
2 in Supplement 2). Compared with placebo, women random-
ized to receive to CEE plus MPA had an HR of 0.97 (95% CI,
0.82-1.16;P = .77)andwomenrandomizedtoreceiveCEEalone
had an HR of 1.04 (95% CI, 0.89-1.22; P = .62) (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). During the postintervention period, the HR for
all-causemortalitywas1.04(95%CI,0.97-1.10;P = .28)forCEE
plus MPA and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-0.99; P = .03) for CEE alone
(eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Age-Stratified Analyses
The HRs for all-cause mortality tended to differ by age during
the intervention and cumulative follow-up phases. Compar-
ing younger women (aged 50-59 years) with older women
(aged 70-79 years), the ratios of nominal HRs for all-cause
mortality in the pooled cohort were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.43-0.87)
during the intervention phase and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-1.00)
during the cumulative 18-year follow-up, without significant
heterogeneity between trials (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Comparing hormone therapy with placebo, the HRs in the
pooled cohort during the intervention phase were 0.69 (95%
CI, 0.51-0.94) for women aged 50 to 59 years, 1.04 (95% CI,
0.87-1.25) for women aged 60 to 69 years, and 1.13 (95% CI,
0.94-1.36) for women aged 70 to 79 years (P value for trend
by age = 0.01) (Figure 3; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The
trends by age were not statistically significant during cumu-
lative follow-up (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79-1.01] for women
aged 50 to 59 years; HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.05] for women
aged 60 to 69 years; and HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.96-1.10] for
women aged 70 to 79 years; P value for trend = 0.06)
(Figure 4; eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Cardiovascular Mortality
Cumulative Follow-up Phase
During cumulative follow-up, 2456 deaths from CVD oc-
curredinthepooledcohort.CVDmortalitywas8.9%inthehor-
mone therapy group vs 9.0% in the placebo group (HR, 1.00
[95% CI, 0.92-1.08]; P = .98), without differences between
trials. The HRs in the pooled cohort for coronary heart dis-
ease mortality (0.97 [95% CI, 0.86-1.09]; P = .60) and stroke
mortality (1.06 [95% CI, 0.90-1.24]; P = .47) did not differ sig-
nificantlybetweenhormonetherapyandplacebogroupsorbe-
tween trials (Figure 2; eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Intervention and Postintervention Phases
Neither treatment was significantly associated with CVD mor-
tality during the intervention phase (eFigure and eTable 2 in
Supplement2).Comparedwithplacebo,womenintheCEEplus
MPA group had an HR of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.78-1.48; P = .65) and
womenintheCEE-alonegrouphadanHRof1.01(95%CI,0.78-
1.31;P = .95).Similarly,theHRsfordeathsduetocoronaryheart
disease, stroke, and other known CVD causes were not signifi-
cantly increased or decreased in either trial during the inter-
vention (eFigure and eTable 2 in Supplement 2) or postinter-
vention phases (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Age-Stratified Analyses
No statistically significant trends for CVD with age were ob-
served in either trial during any study phase (Figure 3 and
Figure 4; eTables 1-3 in Supplement 2).
Cancer Mortality
Cumulative Follow-up Phase
During cumulative follow-up, 2207 deaths from cancer oc-
curred in the pooled cohort. Cancer mortality rates and HRs
in the pooled cohort were similar between the intervention
group (8.2%) and the placebo group (8.0%) (HR, 1.03 [95% CI,
0.95-1.12]; P = .50) (Figure 2; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Mor-
tality was 8.3% for CEE plus MPA vs 7.9% for placebo (HR, 1.06
[95% CI, 0.95-1.18]; P = .31) and it was 8.0% for CEE vs 8.1%
for placebo (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.86-1.13]; P = .86). For breast
cancer mortality, the HRs for cumulative follow-up were 1.44

(HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.88-1.02]; P = .14). When examined by

 plus MPA vs placebo (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77-1.11]; P = .42),
and 2.4% vs 3.2% for CEE vs placebo (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59-
0.94]; P = .01) (Figure 2; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). HRs for
deaths from COPD, accidents or injuries, and other causes
were not significantly increased or decreased during cumula-
tive follow-up in either trial (Figure 2).
Intervention and Postintervention Phases
During the intervention phase, the HR for other (non-CVD,
noncancer) causes of mortality was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.39-0.90;
P = .01) for CEE plus MPA vs placebo but did not differ by
treatment group in the CEE-alone trial. Regarding specific
causes of death, there were fewer deaths from COPD during
the CEE plus MPA intervention (eFigure in Supplement 2),
but the number of events was small. During the postinter-
vention phase, a lower risk of mortality from dementia
emerged in the pooled cohort (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.99];
P = .03) and in the CEE-alone trial (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.58-
0.92]; P = .008) (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Age-Stratified Analyses
HRs for other (non-CVD, noncancer) mortality during the
intervention phase were similar across age groups for CEE
plus MPA but lower for younger women than for older
women in the CEE trial (P value for trend by age = 0.002)
(Figure 3; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). However, numbers of
events of individual outcomes (COPD, dementia, injuries or
accidents, other) were too small to assess cause-specific dif-
ferences by age during the intervention. During cumulative
follow-up, lower risks of non-CVD, noncancer mortality per-
sisted among women aged 50 to 59 years in the CEE-alone
trial (HR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89), although the trend for
age was no longer significant (P value for trend = 0.22)
(Figure 4).
There were fewer deaths from COPD among women aged
50 to 59 years in the CEE trial (eTable 1 in Supplement 2), but
the number of events was small.
Additional Analyses
In additional sensitivity analyses censoring participants who
took less than 80% of study pills (active or placebo) during
the first 2 years, results were generally similar to intention-
to-treat results, but statistical power was reduced. For cumu-
lative follow-up, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.03 (95%
CI, 0.95-1.11) for the CEE plus MPA trial and 0.94 (95% CI,
0.86-1.03) for CEE alone. The pattern suggestive of lower
mortality risks for younger women when compared with
older women during the intervention phase persisted in
these analyses (P value for trend by age = 0.05 in pooled
analyses), but age trends were not statistically significant
during cumulative follow up. In analyses of all-cause and
cause-specific mortality with stratification by time since
menopause, results were generally similar to the age-
stratified analyses, but statistical power was lower due to
missing age at menopause for many participants. In addition,
sensitivity analyses adjusted for time-varying differences in
initiation of statins between treatment group,9 had no appre-
ciable effect on the results.
Discussion
During cumulative 18-year follow-up among 27 347 postmeno-
pausal women in the WHI hormone therapy trials, CEE plus
MPA and CEE alone were not associated with increased or de-
creased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or total cancer mor-
tality. Based on 7489 cumulative deaths over 18 years (1088
deaths during the intervention phase and 6401 deaths during
postintervention follow-up [Figure 1]; >98% ascertainment of
mortality), HRs for all-cause mortality in the hormone therapy
group vs the placebo group were 0.99 (95% CI, 0.94-1.03;
P = .60) in the overall pooled cohort, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.08;
P = .51)withCEEplusMPA,and0.94(95%CI,0.88-1.01;P = .11)
with CEE alone (Table). HRs for all-cause mortality also did not
differ between the hormone therapy and placebo groups dur-
ing the intervention phases of the trials. When examined by
10-year age group (based on age at randomization) compar-
ing women aged 50 to 59 years to those aged 70 to 79 years,
the ratios of nominal HRs for all-cause mortality in the pooled
cohort were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.43-0.87) during the intervention
phase and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-1.00) during cumulative 18-
year follow-up (eTable 4 in Supplement 2), without signifi-
cant heterogeneity between trials. The trend by age group was
statistically significant during the intervention phase but not
during the cumulative follow-up period.
Results for cause-specific mortality should be inter-
preted cautiously due to multiple comparisons. Although
younger women (aged 50-59 years) tended to have lower HRs
than older women for mortality due to CVD, cancer, and other
(non-CVD, noncancer) causes during the intervention phases
of the 2 trials, only the latter outcome in the CEE-alone trial
showed a statistically significant trend with age (P value for
trend by age = .002), partially influenced by adverse effects of
CEE in women aged 70 to 79 years. During cumulative follow-
up, trends in cause-specific mortality across age groups were
not statistically significantly different. For non-CVD, noncan-
cer mortality, the significantly reduced risk among younger
women in the pooled trials during the intervention phase (HR,
0.52 [95% CI, 0.28-0.97]; P value for trend by age = .01; eTable
2 in Supplement 2) appeared attributable to small reductions
in several outcomes rather than a marked reduction in a single
outcome; a risk reduction persisted only for CEE during cu-
mulative follow-up. The observed reduction in deaths from
AlzheimerdiseaseorotherdementiaintheCEEtrialandpooled
cohort requires particular caution in view of findings of ad-
verse effects of these interventions on cognitive function and
incident dementia in the WHI Memory Study.10,11 Although
rates of dementia mortality in WHI are well aligned with age-
specific national statistics,12 deaths from dementia can be
underreported,andcompetingrisksfromothercausesofdeath
or confounding cannot be excluded. It is unknown whether fa-
vorable effects of hormone therapy on insulin resistance and
diabetes13,14—major determinants of cognitive decline—15,16
contributed to these findings.

 hormone therapy use for 5 to 7 years on life-threatening out-
comes. Previous WHI reports have focused on incident diag-
noses such as coronary heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, hip
fracture, and other major outcomes—all of which are serious
but predominantly nonfatal and led to fewer than half of the
deaths in the cohort. The current analyses include a large num-
ber of deaths during 18 years of follow-up (4354 deaths in the
CEE plus MPA trial and 3135 in the CEE trial). Given the hor-
mone therapy-related health risks identified in the CEE plus
MPA trial2,6,10 and the CEE-only trial3,6, it is noteworthy that
no elevations in all-cause mortality were found during either
theinterventionorcumulativefollow-upphasesofthesetrials.
Althoughthesefindingslendsupporttopracticeguidelinesen-
dorsing use of hormone therapy for recently menopausal
women with moderate-to-severe symptoms, in the absence of
contraindications,17-19 the attenuation of age differences with
longer follow-up and potential health risks of treatment6,20,21
wouldnotsupportuseofhormonetherapyforreducingchronic
disease or mortality. Moreover, it is unclear whether benefits
would outweigh risks with longer duration of treatment. In
clinicaldecisionmaking,theseconsiderationsmustbeweighed
against the evidence linking untreated vasomotor symptoms
in midlife women to impaired health and quality of life, dis-
rupted sleep, reduced work productivity, and increased health
care expenditures.17,22,23
No other randomized clinical trial of hormone therapy, to
our knowledge, has been large enough to assess a potential
modifying effect of age on all-cause mortality, and most pre-
vious trials of chronic disease outcomes have focused on older
women.17,24 Observational studies, which include primarily
women who initiate hormone therapy in early menopause,
have generally demonstrated lower mortality among women
using hormone therapy compared with nonusers,25-28 al-
thoughfewstudieshavedistinguishedbetweenestrogenalone
and combination estrogen plus progestin. HRs in most large
cohort studies have ranged from 0.40 to 0.80,25-28 but such
studies may be susceptible to several potential sources of
confounding.17,29 Regarding cause-specific mortality, the most
marked risk reductions reported in observational studies have
been for coronary or CVD deaths. The potential influence of
ageontherelationbetweenhormonetherapyandvasculardis-
ease has received considerable attention, including divergent
effects of hormone therapy on atherosclerotic lesions in early
vs late menopause.30-33
Total cancer mortality did not differ significantly be-
tween intervention and placebo groups in either trial despite
the increased incidence of breast cancer with CEE plus MPA34
andconcernsaboutanincreasedriskofhormone-sensitivecan-
cers with both regimens.29 Hormone therapy has a complex
relationship with cancer. Although a significant reduction in
breast cancer was seen with CEE,35,36 a significant increase
in breast cancer incidence with CEE plus MPA has been
documented.6,37DivergentfindingsforCEEaloneandCEEplus
MPA for breast cancer point to an adverse effect of progestin
on the breast epithelium,38 but progestins have been linked
to favorable effects on the endometrium and a decreased risk
of endometrial cancer became apparent with long-term
follow-up of the CEE plus MPA trial.6,39 Moreover, these regi-
mens did not appear to alter mortality outcomes for other can-
cer sites, including lung cancer, and had no significant effect
on total cancer incidence.6
Several limitations of this study warrant consideration.
Only 1 dose, formulation, and route of administration in each
trial was assessed; thus, results are not necessarily generaliz-
able to other hormone preparations. The greater than 98%
follow-up through the NDI obviates many of the concerns of
previousWHIreportscoveringpostinterventionfollow-up;vir-
tually all cohort deaths are captured in these analyses due to
the NDI searches. Nonetheless, specificity of cause of death
may vary across outcomes. Finally, the nominal P values pre-
sented here should be interpreted cautiously, as multiple out-
comes and subgroups were examined. Thus, cause-specific
mortality analyses should be considered exploratory.
Conclusions
Among postmenopausal women in WHI, hormone therapy
with CEE plus MPA for a median of 5.6 years or CEE for a me-
dian of 7.2 years was not associated with risk of all-cause, car-
diovascular, or total cancer mortality during a cumulative
follow-up of 18 years.
