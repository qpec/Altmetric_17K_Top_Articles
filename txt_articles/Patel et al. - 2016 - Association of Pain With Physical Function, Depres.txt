Abstract
Purpose of Study: To characterize the prevalence and longitudinal effects of pain in older Veteran and non-Veteran 
 
women.
Design and Methods: Data on 144,956 participants in the Women’s Health Initiative were analyzed. At baseline, Veteran 
status, pain severity, and pain interference with activity were assessed. Outcomes of physical function, depressive symptoms, 
fatigue, and sleep quality were reported at baseline by all study participants and longitudinally on two follow-up occasions 
(3 years and 13–18 years after baseline) in the observational study participants (n = 87,336).
Results: At baseline, a total of 3,687 (2.5%) had a history of military service and 22,813 (15.8%) reported that pain lim-
ited their activity level moderately to extremely during the past 4 weeks. Prevalence of pain interference did not differ in 
Veterans and non-Veterans (16.8% and 15.7%, respectively; p= .09). At baseline, women with moderate-to-extreme pain 
interference had substantially worse physical function and greater symptoms of depression, fatigue, and insomnia than 
those with less pain (p < .001 for all comparisons), adjusting for several social, behavioral, and health related factors. There 
were no significant military service by pain interference interactions for any of the outcomes (p > .2), indicating that the 
effect of pain interference on outcomes at baseline did not vary between Veterans and non-Veterans. Moderate-to-extreme 
pain interference was associated with a greater rate of decline in physical function over time (p < .001) and higher incidence 
of limited physical functioning (p < .001), but these effects did not vary by Veteran status. Similar results were observed 
with pain severity as the exposure variable.

 Implications: As the Veteran population ages and the number of women exposed to combat operations grows, there will 
be an increased need for health care services that address not only pain severity and interference but also other disabling 
comorbid symptoms.

Chronic pain is a common condition among community-
dwelling older adults. A national study of Medicare ben-
eficiaries estimated that bothersome pain afflicts half of 
older adults and increases significantly with greater disease 
burden (Patel, Guralnik, Dansie, & Turk, 2013). The func-
tional consequences of pain in older adults are substantial. 
For example, the inability to walk three blocks was 72% 
higher in older adults with pain than in those without pain, 
adjusting for demographics and comorbidity (Patel et al., 
2013). Several population-based studies have also shown 
that pain is associated with clinically significant decrements 
in performance-based measures of physical capacity, such as 
grip strength, gait speed, and overall lower extremity func-
tion (Al Snih, Markides, Ray, & Goodwin, 2001; Bryant, 
Grigsby, Swenson, Scarbro, & Baxter, 2007; Eggermont, 
Bean, Guralnik, & Leveille, 2009; Leveille, Bean, Ngo, 
McMullen, & Guralnik, 2007; Patel et al., 2013; Reid, 
Williams, & Gill, 2005). Importantly, older women, rela-
tive to older men, are more likely to report presence of pain 
as well as have a higher total number of pain locations 
(Patel et al., 2013).
Pain is also a major health problem among Veterans 
(Institute of Medicine, 2011). Painful musculoskeletal 
conditions are commonly diagnosed among female and 
male Veterans, although the causes of these conditions 
might vary by sex. For example, previous studies, as far 
back as the late 1970s, have shown high rates of muscu-
loskeletal injuries (e.g., stress fractures) among women in 
basic training (Knapik et al., 2013; Kowal 1980; Reinker 
& Ozburne, 1979; Ross & Woodward, 1994). Also, his-
tory of sexual trauma among women with pain is asso-
ciated with greater pain intensity and pain interference 
with function (Haskell, Papas, Heapy, Reid, & Kerns, 
2009). The risk of musculoskeletal injury has likely 
increased among women in more recent military opera-
tions as exposure to combat and the physical demands 
of carrying heavy equipment have increased. Notably, 
an analysis of national clinical and administrative data 
from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) showed 
that not only did the diagnosis of painful musculoskel-
etal conditions increase annually after Veterans returned 
from deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom 
(Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom but also 
women had a higher prevalence of these conditions than 
men and this difference increased over time (Haskell 
et al., 2012). Musculoskeletal injuries related to mili-
tary service might contribute to long-term risk of chronic 
pain conditions such as osteoarthritis. In one national 
survey of community-dwelling adults, the prevalence of 
physician-diagnosed arthritis was significantly higher in 
Veterans (32%) than in non-Veterans (22%) (Dominick, 
Golightly, & Jackson, 2006), although these survey find-
ings were not reported by gender. Among older Veterans 
receiving care in the VHA, arthritis is more common in 
women than in men (Steinman et al., 2012).
As the population of women enlisted in the military 
grows and ages, it is important to understand the experi-
ence and impacts of pain on physical and mental health 
among older women Veterans. Indeed, a systematic review 
noted a gap in understanding aging and health issues 
among women Veterans (Bean-Mayberry et al., 2011). 
Considering that pain is the leading cause of disability 
reported by older women (Leveille, Fried, & Guralnik, 
2002) and that pain relief is a leading health care goal of 
older adults (Fried et al., 2011), we analyzed data from the 
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) to characterize the preva-
lence and longitudinal effects of pain among older Veteran 
and non-Veteran women.
The disablement process model provides a useful frame-
work for investigating the impact of pain in older adults 
(Nagi, 1976; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994). This model recog-
nizes that disability can be caused by a diverse set of condi-
tions, ranging from congenital or developmental disorders 
to injuries with long-term sequelae to chronic diseases such 
diabetes and heart failure. The model posits that patho-
logical processes or conditions contribute to physiologic 
impairments that in turn limit one’s capacity to carry out 
basic physical or cognitive actions (i.e., functional limita-
tions). Although interventions targeting the pathology 
stage would theoretically reduce the rate of functional 
decline, the reality is that the majority of older adults have 
multiple chronic conditions (Salive, 2013; Wolff, Starfield, 
& Anderson, 2002). Accordingly, researchers have increas-
ingly examined the effects of symptoms and impairments 
on functional outcomes as they are likely to be more ame-
nable to clinical intervention (e.g., Tinetti et al., 2011; 
Whitson et al., 2009).
Despite increasing research on pain in the Veteran popu-
lation and in the general adult population, relatively few 
studies have directly compared the experience or impacts 
of pain in Veterans and non-Veterans, particularly in 
women. In the current study, we sought to characterize 
and determine whether the prevalence of pain, both pain 
intensity and pain interference with activity, and its impact 
on physical functioning varies according to military service 
history in the WHI. We also examined the cross-sectional 
and longitudinal associations of pain with other potentially 
disabling symptoms, including depression, fatigue, and

 insomnia, to further characterize the impact of pain among 
older Veteran and non-Veteran women.
Methods
Study Population
Baseline data from the WHI observational study (OS; 
n = 93,676) and clinical trial (CT; n = 68,132) as well as 
longitudinal data from the OS were analyzed. Study par-
ticipants were postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years 
at baseline who were recruited at 40 clinical centers in 
the United States between October 1993 and December 
1998 (Anderson et al., 2003; Women’s Health Initiative 
Study Group, 1998). The study protocol was approved by 
the institutional review boards of all study sites and the 
clinical coordinating center, and written informed consent 
was obtained from all study participants. Data collection 
protocols varied according to the WHI study component, 
although all participants completed a common set of ques-
tionnaires at baseline that assessed demographics, health 
behavior, health conditions, symptoms, functional status, 
and health-related quality of life. Veteran status was deter-
mined at baseline with the following question, “Have you 
served in the U.S. armed forces on active duty for a period 
of 180 days or more?”
Pain Measurement
Two questionnaire items on pain were collected as part 
of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey (RAND36; Hays, 
Sherbourne, & Mazel, 1993). Participants were asked about 
pain severity using a 5-point Likert-type response scale 
(“None” to “Severe”), “During the past 4 weeks, how much 
bodily pain have you had?” The second question on pain 
interference asked, “During the past 4 weeks, how much did 
pain interfere with your normal work (both outside your 
home and at home)?” Five response options ranging from 
“Not at all” to “Extreme” were provided. To identify those 
with pain that is more bothersome and more likely to elicit a 
clinical response from health care providers, the five response 
options for the pain severity item were dichotomized into 
“None-to-Mild” versus “Moderate-to-Severe”; the pain 
interference item responses were dichotomized into “Not 
at all-to-A little bit” versus “Moderately-to-Extremely”. In 
addition, the two pain questions were used to calculate the 
RAND36 Bodily Pain subscale score, ranging 0–100 with 
higher scores indicating a composite of less pain severity and 
interference (Hays et al., 1993).
Outcome Measures
Chronic pain can contribute not only to decreased physical 
functioning but also to emotional distress as well as reduced 
sleep quality, which in turn can reduce pain thresholds and 
increase feelings of fatigue. Thus, several outcomes relevant 
to the disablement process and aging were examined to 
characterize the impacts of pain. Physical functioning was 
measured by 10 questions in the RAND36 that assess func-
tional limitations across a range of activities (e.g., walk-
ing, stair climbing, lifting heavy objects). Four RAND36 
questionnaire items on level of energy and tiredness were 
used to measure fatigue. The standard scoring rubric 
was applied to provide a 0–100 score for the RAND36 
Physical Functioning and Fatigue subscales with higher 
scores indicating better health or functioning (Hays et al., 
1993). Depressive symptoms were assessed using six items 
from the depression scale of the Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies (CESD) and two items from the National Institute 
of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule (Burnam, 
Wells, Leake, & Landsverk, 1988). The scoring algorithm 
developed by Burnam and colleagues was used to compute 
depressive symptoms scores, ranging 0–1 with higher val-
ues reflecting greater depressive symptom burden; a cutoff 
of ≥0.06 suggests clinically significant depressive symp-
toms. The 5-item WHI Insomnia Rating Scale was used to 
assess sleep quality; four items assess problems with the 
initiation and maintenance of sleep, whereas the fifth item 
assesses sleep quality (Levine et al. 2003). The total sleep 
scores range from 0 (best) to 20 (worst); a score ≥9 indi-
cates problematic insomnia (Levine, et al. 2003). In the 
OS, the physical function, depressive symptoms, fatigue, 
and insomnia outcomes were measured at baseline (1993–
1998), Year 3 of follow-up, and during the extension study 
contact in 2011–2012 (13–18 years of follow-up).
Other Measures
Several demographic and health-related factors that might 
confound the pain–physical function relationship were 
also included in the data analysis. Age, race/ethnicity, 
marital status, education, and family income were self-
reported at baseline. For smoking history, participants 
were categorized into never smoked, former smoker, and 
current smoker. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, 
using measurements collected at baseline by trained study 
staff. The World Health Organization’s categorization of 
BMI was used to classify participants into underweight 
(<18.5), healthy weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–
29.9), obese I (30.0–34.9), obese II (35.0–39.9), and obese 
III (≥40.0). Physical activity was measured in metabolic 
equivalents per week using a validated questionnaire that 
assessed the duration and intensity of individual activities 
(Johnson-Kozlow, Rock, Gilpin, Hollenbach, & Pierce, 
2007). For alcohol consumption, participants were cat-
egorized into nondrinker, former drinker, consumes <1 
drink per week, and consumes ≥1 drink per week. Use 
of hormone therapy (HT) was self-reported. The fol-
lowing health conditions were self-reported at baseline: 
arthritis, hip fracture, hypertension, diabetes, myocardial

 infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, angina, and 
cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).
Data Analysis
Responses to the pain interference and pain severity 
questionnaire items at baseline as well as the RAND36 
Bodily Pain subscale score were compared according 
to Veteran status using chi-square and t-test statistics 
(Supplementary Table 1). Baseline participant charac-
teristics were then compared according to level of pain 
interference and Veteran status using chi-square, t-test, 
or Wilcoxon rank sum test statistics (Table 1). Both the 
pain interference and pain severity items were examined 
separately with each of the outcomes. Because the find-
ings were similar with both items, only the pain interfer-
ence results are described in the current report; the pain 
severity results are included in the Supplementary Tables. 
Cross-sectional associations of pain interference and 
pain severity with the outcome measures were assessed 
using linear regression (Table 2; Supplementary Table 3). 
Logarithmic transformations were applied to the skewed 
outcome variables (depressive symptom and sleep qual-
ity), but results were not meaningfully different using 
transformed versus nontransformed data; therefore raw, 
nontransformed variables were used to facilitate interpre-
tation of results. To determine whether military service 
history modifies the effects of pain interference and pain 
severity on the outcome measures, statistical interaction 
terms of Veteran status by pain interference and Veteran 
status by pain severity were tested. Random effects linear 
regression models were used to assess the longitudinal 
associations of pain interference and pain severity with 
the study outcomes (Table 3 and Figure 1; Supplementary 
Table 4). Statistical interaction between pain interference 
and follow-up time was tested to determine whether the 
rate of change in the outcome measure differed between 
those with and without moderate-to-extreme pain inter-
ference. Pain severity by follow-up time interactions were 
also tested. In addition, Poisson regression models were 
fitted using generalized estimating equations to prospec-
tively examine the incidence of study outcomes among 
OS participants who did not have the outcome at base-
line (Table 4 and Figure 2; Supplementary Table 5). Based 
on clinically relevant cutpoints established in previous 
studies or the baseline distribution of scores in the WHI, 
limited physical functioning was defined as a RAND36 
Physical Functioning subscale score of <50, depres-
sive symptoms as a CESD score of ≥0.06, fatigue as a 
RAND36 Fatigue subscale score of <50, and insomnia 
as an insomnia rating scale score of ≥9. Applying more 
conservative definitions of the outcomes (e.g., RAND36 
Physical Functioning subscale score <40) did not mean-
ingfully change the results. All analyses were completed 
using Stata SE 13 (College Station, TX). Associations 
were considered statistically significant when p < .05.
Results
Among the 161,639 women enrolled at baseline, 16,683 
were missing information on military service or did not 
report their level of pain, yielding an analytic sample size 
of 144,956 for the current study. A total of 3,687 (2.5%) 
had a history of military service, 29,226 (20.2%) reported 
moderate-to-severe pain, and 22,813 (15.8%) reported that 
pain limited their activity level moderately to extremely 
during the past 4 weeks. Importantly, however, neither pain 
severity nor pain interference varied by military service his-
tory (Supplementary Table 1). In Veterans and non-Veter-
ans, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe pain was 20.8% 
and 20.2%, respectively (p = .36); prevalence of moder-
ate-to-extreme pain interference was 16.8% and 15.7%, 
respectively (p = .09). In addition, there were no significant 
differences in the overall RAND36 Bodily Pain subscale 
score by military service history (p = .11; Supplementary 
Table 1). The distributions of demographic and health 
characteristics at baseline are shown by Veteran status in 
Supplementary Table 2. An important overall difference to 
note is that Veterans were 6 years older on average than 
non-Veterans (median age 69 and 63 years, respectively; 
p < .001).
The distributions of baseline participant character-
istics are shown in Table 1 according to military service 
history and level of pain interference. Among Veterans, 
there were no significant differences between pain inter-
ference groups in age or ethnicity; however, participants 
with moderate-to-extreme pain interference were more 
likely to be divorced or widowed and have a lower level 
of education and family income than those who reported 
less pain interference. Veterans with moderate-to-extreme 
pain interference were substantially more likely to be 
obese and have comorbid medical conditions, and less 
likely to be physically active and drink alcohol. Smoking 
history and HT use did not vary between pain interference 
groups among Veterans. Similar distributions of baseline 
participant characteristics were observed in non-Veterans, 
although all of the between-pain interference group com-
parisons were statistically significant, perhaps because of 
the large sample size.
Table 2 shows the baseline association of pain interfer-
ence with physical function, depressive symptoms, fatigue, 
and sleep quality. In Veterans and non-Veterans, there were 
striking differences between those with and without mod-
erate-to-extreme pain interference for all four outcomes. 
Women with moderate-to-extreme pain interference had 
substantially worse physical functioning as well as greater 
symptoms of depression, fatigue, and insomnia than those 
who reported less pain interference, even when adjusting 
for several social, behavioral, and health related factors. As 
reflected in the means shown in Table 2, there were no sig-
nificant military service by pain interference interactions for 
any of the outcomes (p > .2), indicating that the effect of pain 
interference on outcomes at baseline did not vary between

 Veteran and non-Veteran participants. Supplementary 
Table 3 shows similar results for pain severity.
Although there were large baseline differences in out-
comes by pain interference in both Veteran and non-
Veteran women, there were less robust differences in the 
average rate of change over time between pain interference 
groups. For example, Figure 1 shows that while women 
with moderate-to-extreme pain interference had poorer 
physical function than those with less pain interference 
at baseline, the rates of decline were similar between pain 
interference groups in Veterans and non-Veterans. When 
adjusted for potential confounders, the mean difference in 
the annual rate of decline in physical function between the 
pain interference groups was statistically significant in both 
Veterans and non-Veterans (Table 3), although the effect 
sizes were relatively small. Moderate-to-extreme pain was 
also associated with worsening fatigue over time relative 
to less pain interference; however, there were no significant 
differences in the rate of change in depressive symptom 
or insomnia rating scores according to pain interference 
(Table 3). Similar to the cross-sectional analysis, there were 
no significant military service by pain interference by time 
interactions for any of the outcomes (p > .20). The longitu-
dinal effects of pain severity were similar and are shown in 
Supplementary Table 4.
Despite the limited effects of pain interference on the 
rate of change in the outcome scores, Figure 2 shows that 
the cumulative incidence of limited physical function, 
depressive symptoms, fatigue, and insomnia was signifi-
cantly higher in women with moderate-to-extreme pain 
interference than in those with less pain interference. For 
example, among participants with physical function scores

 above 50 at baseline, the incidence of limited physical func-
tion (falling below 50) was twofold higher in women with 
moderate-to-extreme pain interference than in those with 
less pain interference among Veterans and non-Veterans. 
The risk of limited physical function, depressive symptoms, 
fatigue, and insomnia remained significantly increased in 
participants with moderate-to-extreme pain interference 
relative to those with less pain interference after adjusting 
for several demographic and health-related behaviors and 
conditions (Table 4). Supplementary Table 5 shows similar 
effects of pain severity on the incidence of study outcomes.
Discussion
In this large, diverse cohort of postmenopausal women, 
the prevalence of moderate-to-extreme pain interference 
and moderate-to-severe pain did not differ according to 
military service history. The impacts of pain interference 
and pain severity on functional, fatigue, and sleep quality 
outcomes were substantial but also did not vary according 
to Veteran status. Women with moderate-to-extreme pain 
interference reported significantly worse physical function, 
depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sleep quality at baseline 
than women with less pain interference. These large differ-
ences at baseline contributed to higher incidence of reach-
ing clinically relevant thresholds over time for each of the 
outcome measures in women with moderate-to-extreme 
pain relative to those with less pain interference. Similar to 
the cross-sectional findings, the longitudinal effects of pain 
interference and pain severity on outcomes did not vary by 
Veteran status.
Few previous studies have compared pain in Veteran with 
non-Veteran women. Murphy and colleagues (2014) ana-
lyzed nationally representative data from the 2011–2013 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and reported 
that the prevalence of a composite outcome of several pain-
ful conditions (i.e., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia) was significantly higher in 
Veteran men and women than in non-Veteran counterparts.

 non-Veterans narrowed with advancing age. Indeed, among 
women aged 65 and older, there was no difference by 
Veteran status in the prevalence of having a painful, chronic 
condition (Murphy et al., 2014). This finding might reflect 
the evolving role women have had in the military, with 
younger cohorts more likely engaged in a wider range of 
physically demanding jobs along with exposure to combat 
operations and thus at increased risk for injuries with pain-
ful sequelae compared with older generations, such as the 
Veteran participants in the Women’s Health Initiative.
Although there was no difference in pain reporting 
between Veterans and non-Veterans in the current study, 
the impact of pain was significant. For example, the mean 
difference at baseline between those with and without 
moderate-to-extreme pain interference on the RAND36 
physical function subscale was 20 in Veterans and non-Vet-
erans (Table 2), adjusting for several potential confounding 
factors (unadjusted difference was approximately 30). The 
minimum clinically important difference for the physical 
function subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item 
Short Form General Health Survey (Ware & Sherbourne, 
1992), which uses the same questionnaire items as the 
RAND36 but applies a slightly different scoring algorithm 
(Hays, et al., 1993), ranges between 5 and 20 in certain 
orthopedic and rheumatologic patient populations (Busija, 
Osborne, Nilsdotter, Buchbinder, & Roos, 2008; Spratt, 
2009). Further, the standard deviation for the physical 
function subscale was less than 20 in the current study, 
indicating that the baseline mean difference in physical 
functioning between participants with and without moder-
ate-to-extreme pain interference was both large and clini-
cally significant. This finding is consistent with previous 
studies that have used self-reported and performance-based 
assessments of physical function to investigate the effects 
of pain in community-dwelling older adults (Al Snih et al., 
2001; Bryant et al., 2007; Convinsky, Lindquist, Dunlop, 
& Yelin, 2009; Eggermont et al., 2009; Leveille et al., 2007; 
Patel et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2005; Shah et al. 2011).
In contrast to the cross-sectional findings at baseline, the 
longitudinal effect of pain interference on the rate of change 
in physical functioning scores over time was less robust in 
both Veteran and non-Veteran women (Table 3). This more 
limited effect likely reflects that (a) participants with mod-
erate-to-extreme pain had greater limitations in physical

 function at baseline than those with less pain interference and 
(b) limitations in physical function are powerful predictors of 
mortality (e.g., Cooper, Kuh, & Hardy, 2010; Cunningham, 
Crystal, Bozzette, & Hays, 2005; Studenski et al., 2011). In 
addition, the frequency of assessments was limited to three 
occasions for the observational study participants, with a 
large time interval between the second and third assessments 
(approximately 10–15 years in the observational study). It 
is conceivable that the combination of lower levels of physi-
cal function at baseline, selective attrition from mortality 
(Weitlauf et al., 2015), and larger time intervals between 
assessments might have contributed to an underestimation of 
the rate of functional decline in participants with pain rela-
tive to those without pain. Nonetheless, the risk of report-
ing a low RAND36 physical function subscale score of <50 
over time was approximately twofold higher in women with 
moderate-to-extreme pain interference than in those with less 
pain interference (Figure 2 and Table 4). This finding is con-
sistent with previous prospective studies with more frequent 
assessments that have shown pain predicts functional decline 
over time in community-dwelling older adults (Buchman 
et al., 2010; Eggermont et al., 2014; Makris, Frankel, Han, 
Leo-Summers, & Gill, 2014; Shah, et al., 2011).
In addition to the functional consequences of pain, the 
results from the current study also highlight the clinical com-
plexity of chronic pain in older women. Not only do the 
physiologic changes that accompany aging (e.g., decline in 
renal and hepatic function) complicate pharmacologic treat-
ment options but comorbid diseases and symptoms also pose 
major challenges to pain management (Makris, Abrams, 
Gurland, & Reid, 2014; Reid, Eccelston, & Pillemer, 2015). 
Indeed, in both Veterans and non-Veterans, WHI partici-
pants who reported moderate-to-extreme pain interference 
were much more likely to be obese, less physically active, and 
have greater disease burden than those who reported less 
pain interference (Table 1). In addition, symptoms of depres-
sion, fatigue, and insomnia were more severe in participants 
who reported moderate-to-extreme pain interference rela-
tive to those who reported less pain interference (Table 2). In 
fact, in women with pain interference, the mean depressive 
symptom and insomnia rating scores at baseline (Table 2) 
were at or above the thresholds used to suggest presence of 
depression (depressive symptom score ≥0.06; Burnam, et al., 
1988) and insomnia (insomnia rating ≥9; Levine, et al., 
2003), respectively. Further, the risk of developing these out-
comes over time was significantly higher in women report-
ing moderate-to-extreme pain interference at baseline than 
those with less pain interference (Figure 2 and Table 4). The 
marked baseline differences in depressive symptoms, fatigue, 
and insomnia by pain status as well as differences in the bur-
den of chronic medical conditions indicate that multimodal 
treatment strategies that integrate pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral ther-
apy, exercise) will be needed to help older women manage 
their pain and comorbid symptoms.
The VHA’s stepped care model of pain management is 
designed to meet the challenges of providing effective care 
for aging Veterans, such as the WHI participants character-
ized in the current study. The stepped care model is evidence-
based and applies a tiered approach beginning with routine 
screening, assessment, and treatment of pain in primary 
care (for a comprehensive review of the model, see Kerns, 
Philip, Lee, & Rosenberger, 2011). Primary care providers 
apply evidence-based treatment algorithms that can include 
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. If the 
patient’s pain does not respond to this treatment or if the 
patient has a complex mix of comorbidity that increases 
risk for adverse outcomes, then the primary care provider 
can consult specialty pain management services, such as 
pain medicine, rehabilitation medicine, behavioral pain 
management, or mental health programs. If pain intensity 
or pain interference persists, then patients are referred to 
tertiary interdisciplinary pain centers for comprehensive 
medical, psychological, and rehabilitation services. The evi-
dence base for stepped care pain management in the VHA 
continues to grow (Bair et al, 2015), including the appli-
cation of telecare to expand pain management services in 
primary care (Kroenke et al., 2014).
A limitation of the current study was that informa-
tion on the length, type, and era of military service was 
not available in the WHI. Also, the pain assessment was 
limited to two questionnaire items from the RAND36. 
Although we were unable to characterize other important 
aspects of pain (e.g., pain quality, duration, or source), 
the classification of WHI participants with moderate-to-
extreme pain interference has good face validity and was 
strongly associated with physical function and other disa-
bling symptoms. Another limitation was that the length of 
time between follow-up assessments varied and was lim-
ited to two occasions, which might have contributed to an 
underestimation in the rate of change in study outcomes 
over time. In addition, no information on VHA use was 
available. Among Veterans, previous research suggests 
that users of VHA services are different from nonusers on 
a range of factors, including higher prevalence of arthri-
tis (Dominick, Golightly, & Jackson, 2006). Finally, the 
generalizability of the study is limited as the WHI study 
participants were not selected to represent the general 
population of postmenopausal women. Nonetheless, the 
current study is among the first to compare pain interfer-
ence and severity in Veteran and non-Veteran women in a 
large, diverse cohort study of postmenopausal women fol-
lowed for several years that collected a range of outcomes 
relevant to pain and aging.
In summary, moderate-to-severe pain and moderate-to-
extreme pain interference were common in Veterans and 
non-Veterans who participated in the WHI. Postmenopausal 
women with pain, regardless of Veteran status, had a clini-
cally significant reduction in physical function as well as a 
high burden of depressive symptoms, fatigue, and insom-
nia. Accordingly, as the population of women Veterans 
ages and the number of women exposed to physically 
demanding jobs and combat operations grows, there will 
be increased need for health care services that address not
