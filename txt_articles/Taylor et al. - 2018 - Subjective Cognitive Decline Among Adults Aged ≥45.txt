Subjective Cognitive Decline Among Adults Aged ≥45 Years — 
United States, 2015–2016
Christopher A. Taylor, PhD1; Erin D. Bouldin, PhD1,2; Lisa C. McGuire, PhD1
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the self-reported expe-
rience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory 
loss within the previous 12 months (1,2) and one of the earliest 
noticeable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (Alzheimer’s), a 
fatal form of dementia (i.e., a decline in mental abilities severe 
enough to interfere with everyday life) (1). Alzheimer’s is the 
most common form of dementia, although not all memory 
loss results from Alzheimer’s (3). To examine SCD, CDC 
analyzed combined data from the 2015 and 2016 Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. Overall, 
11.2% of adults aged ≥45 years reported having SCD, 50.6% 
of whom reported SCD-related functional limitations. Among 
persons living alone aged ≥45 years, 13.8% reported SCD; 
among persons with any chronic disease, 15.2% reported 
SCD. Adults should discuss confusion or memory loss with a 
health care professional who can assess cognitive decline and 
address possible treatments and issues related to chronic disease 
management, medical care, and caregiving.
BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit–dialed telephone 
survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years in all 
50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and several U.S. 
territories.* The six-question cognitive decline module 
(optional for states in 2015 and 2016) examines how SCD 
affects the life of respondents aged ≥45 years, including 
difficulties performing activities or caring for themselves. 
Overall, 49 states (all except Pennsylvania), Puerto Rico, and 
DC administered the module in one or both years. For five 
states that administered the module in both years, only 2016 
data were included in this analysis. For the BRFSS surveys in 
2015 and 2016, the overall combined landline and cellular

telephone response rates among states, Puerto Rico, and DC 
ranged from 30.7% to 65.0% (median = 47.1%).†
Respondents who answered affirmatively to the question 
“During the past 12 months, have you experienced confusion 
or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting 
worse?” were classified as having SCD. Respondents with 
SCD were asked if SCD caused them to give up day-to-day 
activities such as cooking, cleaning, taking medications, driv-
ing, or paying bills; how often they needed and could receive 
necessary assistance with those activities; how often SCD 
interfered with their ability to work, volunteer, or engage in 
social activities; and whether they had discussed SCD with a 
health care professional. Respondents who reported “always,” 
“usually,” or “sometimes” (as opposed to “rarely” or “never”)

giving up day-to-day activities or interference with ability to 
work, volunteer, or engage in social activities were classified 
as having SCD-related functional limitations.
Data were examined by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation level, veteran status, employment, and living alone. 
Chronic disease status was ascertained by history of heart 
disease; stroke, or cerebrovascular disease; asthma; lung dis-
ease; cancer (other than skin); arthritis; or diabetes. Data were 
analyzed using statistical software and methods that accounted 
for the complex survey design and weighted data. Prevalence 
rates were unadjusted.
Among adults aged ≥45 years, 11.2% reported SCD, 
50.6% of whom reported SCD-related functional difficulties 
(Table 1). SCD prevalence increased with age, from 10.4% 
among adults aged 45–54 years to 14.3% among those aged 
≥75 years and was lower among college graduates (7.0%) than 
among those with less than high school education (18.2%). 
The prevalence of SCD-related functional difficulties among 
college graduates (30.8%) was half that of those without a 
high school diploma (64.9%). Among persons living alone, 
13.8% reported SCD; 55.7% of those reported SCD-related 
functional difficulties (Table 1).
The prevalence of SCD varied by state (Table 2). The lowest 
prevalence of SCD was reported in South Dakota (6.0%), and 
the highest was reported in Nevada (16.3%).
Nearly twice the percentage of persons reporting SCD-
related functional limitations had talked to a health care 
professional (58.1%) compared with those without functional 
limitations (30.4%) (Table 3). Among persons with a func-
tional difficulty, 81.1% reported having given up household 
activities or chores because of SCD, and 73.3% reported that 
SCD interfered with their ability to work, volunteer, or engage 
in social activities.
Discussion
SCD can be a symptom of early-stage dementia conditions, 
including Alzheimer’s (1,2). Not everyone who reports SCD 
will develop dementia, but some studies have shown that half 
of older adults with subjective memory complaints go on 
to develop more severe cognitive decline within 7–18 years 
(1,4,5). Even without progression to more severe cognitive 
impairment, SCD might signify a decreased ability for self-care. 
Inability to perform activities important to daily living such as 
preparing meals or managing money affect the ability to live 
independently and might also affect the ability to socialize or 
remain fully employed.
These findings are similar to those from an analysis of per-
sons aged ≥60 years in 21 states from the 2011 BRFSS survey, 
which found a 12.7% prevalence of SCD (6). In that study, 
the highest prevalence was among Hispanics (16.9%) and the 
lowest was among non-Hispanic blacks (11.8%), in contrast 
to the current study, which found the highest prevalence 
among non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives 
(19.6%) and the lowest among non-Hispanic Asians or Native 
Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders (6.8%). The inclusion of

additional states and the expansion of the age groups might 
have contributed to these differences.
In both 2011 (6) and 2015–2016, a higher SCD prevalence 
was found among adults aged ≥75 years than among those aged 
45–74 years. This is similar to the prevalence of Alzheimer’s, 
according to 2018 data from the Alzheimer’s Association, 
which found an estimated 3% of persons aged 65–74 years, 
17% of persons aged 75–84 years, and 32% of persons aged 
≥85 years had Alzheimer’s (1,7). This analysis found a higher 
prevalence of SCD and related functional limitations in per-
sons with less formal education, similar to previously reported 
patterns of higher dementia prevalence in persons with less 
formal education (8).
Younger adults might be more likely to attribute limitations 
in their lifestyle to SCD or might be more sensitive to its effects. 
Conversely, older adults might be less aware of the effects of 
SCD or consider it a normal part of aging. Among persons 
aged 45–54 years, 10.4% reported SCD, and 59.8% of those 
persons reported SCD-related limitations that affected work, 
household chores, or social activities. Although Alzheimer’s 
is rare in persons aged <65 years, the finding of SCD and 
related functional limitations among younger adults could 
indicate early symptoms of cognitive decline that can be a

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a form of impairment in 
which more frequent or worsening confusion or memory loss 
can affect the ability to care for oneself.
What is added by this report?
Among adults aged ≥45 years, 11.2% reported SCD, including 
10.4% of adults aged 45–54 years. Among all persons who 
reported SCD, only 45.4% had discussed it with a health 
care professional.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Adults with confusion or memory loss should talk to a health 
care professional who can assess cognitive decline and address 
possible treatment of symptoms, management of other 
co-occurring chronic health conditions, advance care planning, 
and caregiving needs, and who ensures that the patient 
receives appropriate information and referrals.
precursor to memory disorders and dementia like Alzheimer’s. 
These functional limitations might have important health and 
economic impacts. Adults aged 45–54 years are in their prime 
working years, when salaries peak, workers are most produc-
tive, and when workers contribute to their retirements and 
consume goods and services (9). An inability to work during 
these years might have financial implications for these adults 
and their families. Persons with SCD-related functional limi-
tations might have to reduce their time working or leave the 
workforce entirely; in this study, nearly three fourths of those 
with a functional difficulty reported that SCD interfered with 
their ability to engage in activities outside the home, includ-
ing working.
Fewer than half (45.4%) of respondents with SCD reported 
speaking to a health care professional about it. More than half 
of those with SCD-related functional limitations reported 
speaking to a health care professional about SCD compared 
with fewer than one third of persons without such limitations, 
suggesting that limitations in ability to perform instrumental 
activities of daily living might prompt discussion with a health 
care professional. Persons might incorrectly believe that cogni-
tive decline is an inevitable part of aging, which could discour-
age them from consulting a health care professional. CDC 
encourages persons with confusion or memory loss to talk to a 
health care professional. After evaluation, even if treatment of 
symptoms is not an option, early assessment of cognitive issues 
can facilitate addressing potential safety issues, discussion of 
advanced care planning, including the need for caregiving, and 
ensuring receipt of appropriate information and referrals (10). 
Early assessment is important because memory issues can affect 
a person’s ability to manage their health; among those reporting 
other chronic health conditions, 15.2% also had SCD.

§ By definition.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, data on SCD are self-reported. Whereas the 
SCD module was cognitively tested, it is not administered 
alongside an objective measure of cognitive performance. 
Therefore, the accuracy of the reports of SCD is unknown. 
Second, response bias might affect response to SCD questions 
and might underestimate SCD prevalence. Finally, BRFSS is 
not administered to persons with known cognitive problems 
who might not generate reliable data. In addition, BRFSS is 
only administered to noninstitutionalized adults, excluding 
adults living in long-term care facilities, where a proportion 
of residents have SCD. Therefore, these results cannot be used 
to estimate the prevalence of SCD across all U.S. populations.
Cognitive decline is an important public health issue affect-
ing older adults, their families, and their caregivers, as well 
as the economy and health care system. As a precursor to 
dementia, including Alzheimer’s, SCD can impair a person’s 
ability to care for themselves by limiting their ability to work, 
particularly those adults who report SCD in their prime 
working years (i.e., 45–54 years). Estimating the prevalence of 
SCD might allow states to plan for those who might develop 
dementia in the future.
