Abstract
The mechanism by which aspirin consumption is linked to
significant reductions in the incidence of multiple forms of cancer
and metastatic spread to distant tissues, resulting in increased
cancer patient survival is not well understood. In this study, using
colon cancer as an example, we provide both in vitro (cell culture)
and in vivo (chemically induced mouse model of colon cancer)
evidence that this profound antineoplastic action may be associ-
ated with aspirin's ability to irreversibly inhibit COX-1–mediated
platelet activation, thereby blocking platelet–cancer cell interac-
tions, which promote cancer cell number and invasive potential.
This process may be driven by platelet-induced epithelial–mes-
enchymal transition (EMT), as assessed using confocal microsco-
py, based upon changes in cell morphology,growth characteristics
and fibronectin expression, and biochemical/molecular analysis
by measuring changes in the expression of the EMT markers;
vimentin, b-catenin, and SNAIL. We also provide evidence that
a novel, gastrointestinal-safe phosphatidylcholine (PC)-associated
aspirin, PL2200 Aspirin, possesses the same or more pronounced
actions versus unmodified aspirin with regard to antiplatelet
effects (in vitro: reducing platelet activation as determined by
measuring the release of thromboxane and VEGF in culture
medium; in vivo: inhibiting platelet number/activation and extrav-
asation into tumor tissue) and chemoprevention (in vitro: inhibit-
ing colonic cell growth and invasive activity; in vivo: inhibiting
colonic dysplasia, inflammation, and tumor mass). These results
suggest that aspirin's chemopreventive effects may be due, in part,
to the drug blocking the proneoplastic action of platelets, and the
potential use of Aspirin-PC/PL2200 as an effective and safer
chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer and possibly other
cancers. Cancer Prev Res; 10(2); 142–52. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Ever since its discovery in 1897, in addition to its activity to
inhibit fever/pain/inflammation, aspirin when used chronically
has been linked to a reduced incidence of a number of diseases
including thrombosis/heart disease, arthritis, and cancer activity
(1). Insight into the cardiovascular preventive action of aspirin
came with Vanes' discovery that aspirin and related NSAIDs act by
inhibiting COX enzyme activity, that regulate the generation of
eicosanoids, providing a mechanism for the class' anti-inflam-
matory/antiplatelet activity (1). Indeed, aspirin's unique ability to
irreversibly inhibit platelet COX-1 (via acetylation), led to its
widespread use in patients at the risk of heart disease/thrombosis
(2, 3).
Interestingly, there is a long history connecting blood coag-
ulation disorders with late-stage cancer that dates back to the
pioneering observation of Armand Trousseau who, in 1865,
made the observation linking later stage cancer and venous
thrombosis (4–6). It is now well established that thrombocy-
tosis and elevated circulating tissue factor levels are predictors of
later stage cancer along with increased incidence (4- to 8-fold)
of venous thrombosis. A body of work demonstrates that
platelets have the capability of interacting with circulating
tumor cells (CTC) either directly or as a fibrin-associated net-
work with neutrophils, and in so doing, prolonging the CTC
circulatory half-life (7). In addition, platelets have been
reported to trigger epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
of cancer cells (8–10).
The association between low-dose (75–325 mg) aspirin
consumption and a significant (20%–40%) reduction in can-
cer incidence was shown for colorectal cancer and the devel-
opment of nine different non-gastrointestinal cancers (11). It
was also reported that aspirin use was significantly associated
with a profound increase in patient survival, thereby reducing
the risk of fatal adenocarcinoma (1, 11, 12). Of interest was the
observation that the metastatic spread of cancer could also be
reduced, even if aspirin consumption was initiated postdiag-
nosis (12, 13). Aspirin use has now been linked to a reduced
cancer incidence in >20 cancers, including the major cancers
afflicting our current population that are responsible for the

 preponderance of cancer-related hospitalizations/costs, mor-
bidity, and mortality activity (1, 12, 14–20).
Because of this compelling evidence, we designed studies
using in vitro and in vivo models of colon cancer to explore the
fundamental question of whether aspirin's antineoplastic activ-
ity is linked to its established ability to irreversibly inactivate
platelets via COX-1 inhibition. The experiments focus on
whether aspirin blocks platelets from promoting EMT, cancer
cell growth, and the metastatic spread of cancer. In the current
study, we also evaluated the chemopreventive activity of a
novel phosphatidylcholine (PC)-associated aspirin, which has
been formulated on the basis of its reported improved gastro-
intestinal safety in both preclinical studies (21, 22), as well as a
pilot clinical trial (23). There is an unmet need for a gastro-
intestinal-safe aspirin, as the toxicity of aspirin to cause peptic
ulceration and excessive gastrointestinal bleeding in susceptible
individuals has limited the recommendations of this common-
ly available drug to the public at-large as a chemopreventive
agent. These issues are reflected by the September 2015 recom-
mendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
where individuals aged 50–69 years are advised to take low-
dose aspirin on a daily basis to prevent colorectal cancer, under
the physician's consultation (24).
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Mice were maintained in accordance and compliance with
the policies approved by the Animal Welfare Committee
(AWC), the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) for The University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston (UTHealth, Houston, TX). Samples of human blood
for platelet isolation were obtained from normal subjects after
obtaining informed consent under Institutional Review Board
(IRB)-approved protocols at the Baylor College of Medicine
and UTHealth (Houston, TX).
Mouse strains
Young adult (20–24 g) male BALB/c mice and young adult
(22–24 g) female Swiss Webster mice were supplied by Harlan
Laboratories, Inc. (now Envigo) and housed in the Center for
Laboratory Animal Medicine & Care (CLAMC) facility at
UTHealth (Houston, TX).
Cancer cells
Colon cancer cells (human Caco-2; HTB37) were purchased
from the ATCC and murine colon cancer cells (MC-26) were
obtained from the NIH National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD).
The cell lines were cultured in suggested growth medium with
10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). All the cell lines were regularly authen-
ticated on the basis of viability, morphology, and growth. Tests for
mycoplasma were negative and were conducted with the MycoA-
lert Mycoplasma Detection Kit from Lonza.
Chemicals and reagents
All chemicals, buffers, and cell culture media were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, unless described separately. Matrigel Mem-
brane Matrix (354234) was from Corning. Azoxymethane (AOM)
and dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS, 36,000–50,000 MW) were
purchased from MP Biomedicals LLC.
Aspirin test drugs
For in vitro studies, pharmaceutical grade aspirin was purchased
from Novacyl Inc. and was dissolved in RPMI1640 culture media
before undergoing sterile filtration. Aspirin-PC was prepared from
aspirin and soy PC (S100 from Lipoid LLC). Initially, the PC was
dissolved in chloroform and dried in a sterile glass vial under
nitrogen gas. Then solubilized aspirin (in culture media) was
added to the PC vial at a 1:1 ratio by weight and the vial was bath
sonicated for 30 minutes. For in vivo studies, aspirin was pur-
chased from a local pharmacy (Walgreens) and was prepared by
crushing a tablet and suspending in water with sonication to a
concentration of 2.5 mg/mL for intragastric administration. Aspi-
rin-PC was prepared by mixing Novacyl aspirin with Lipoid
Phosal 35SB cGMP which is the PC in the commercial formula-
tion of Aspirin-PC. This mixture was suspended by bath sonica-
tion in water for animal studies.
Antibodies
A mouse mAb of b-catenin (sc-7963), rabbit polyclonal anti-
body of vimentin (sc-5565), HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(sc-2054), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (sc-2055)
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A rabbit polyclonal anti-
body of b-actin (PA1183) and was from Thermo Scientific.
Human and mouse platelet isolation
Using a previously described technique to isolate platelets
(25), human blood was drawn into an acid/citrate/dextrose
(ACD) anticoagulant at a ratio of 1:9 (v/v) from healthy fasting
donors. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifuging
blood at 200 � g for 15 minutes at room temperature. PRP
supplemented with 75 nmol/L of PGE1 was centrifuged at
1,000 � g for 10 minutes at room temperature to obtain a
platelet pellet that was resuspended and washed with buffer and
adjusted to 2.5 � 108 platelets/mL. Mouse blood (BALB/c) was
collected from the inferior vena cava of random isoflurane-
anesthetized mice into 3.8% sodium citrate at the ratio of
1:10 (v/v) for studies with PRP, and into ACD at the ratio of
1:10 (v/v) for washed platelet studies. Blood was diluted 1:1 with
PBS and PRP was isolated following centrifugation at 68 � g for
10 minutes. Washed platelets were obtained following addition-
al centrifugation of PRP as described previously (26). Platelets
were resuspended in RPMI1640 with 0.01 U/mL of apyrase and
counts adjusted to 2.5 � 108 platelets/mL.
Cancer cell growth assay
At the time of drug testing, human and murine colon cancer
cells were seeded onto the Transwell chamber (purchased from
Corning) with 0.4 mmol/L porous membrane at 6.25 � 104 in 250
mL of serum-free RPMI1640 and washed platelets that were freshly
collected from human or mouse were added in the bottom well at
5 � 107 in 500 mL of serum-free RPMI1640. Cells without platelet
incubation served as a control. After 36-hour incubation, 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazolyl-2) 2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide (MTT,
Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added to the media of cells in the
Transwell at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL for 4 hours and
the cells extracted and stained for MTT as described previously
(27). The membrane was cut and extracted into plate wells
containing 200 mL of the formazan solvent (90% isopropanol,
0.2% SDS, and 0.01 N HCl) in a 48-well plate, and read at an
absorbance of 570 nm.

 Cancer cell invasion assay
To assess invasive activity, 2.5 � 105 mouse MC-26 colon
cancer cells and 1 � 108 washed platelets were mixed in 500 mL
of serum-free RPMI1640 and applied to the uppermost Trans-
well chamber with 8-mm porous membrane precoated with
Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and 750 mL of serum-free RPMI1640
was added into the bottom chamber in a 48-well culture plate.
Cells without platelets served as control. After 16–20 hours of
incubation at 37�C and 5% CO2, the noninvading cells and
extracellular matrix were gently removed with a cotton swab
and the number of invading cancer cells located on the lower
side of the Transwell membrane was assessed by fixing and
staining with Hema 3 stain kit (Fisher HealthCare Protocol),
and counting under a microscope.
Coculture of cancer cells and washed platelets
In studies to assess EMT activity, MC-26 cancer cells were
cocultured with mouse washed platelets (mWP) at a ratio of
1:400 at 37�C, 5% CO2 for 18–24 hours. The 1: 400 was ratio
was modeled after published studies, where a clear platelet
effect on cancer cell growth and invasive activity was reported
(28). The cultured cells were washed one time with PBS and
then lysed with RIPA buffer (Fisher Scientific) for Western blot
of vimentin. To assess b-catenin translocation into the nucle-
us, subcellular fractionation was performed according to the
Abcam subcellular fractionation protocol. Briefly, the above
cocultured cells were collected in cold fractionation buffer,
and cell membrane/cytosolic fraction and nucleus fraction
were prepared by two rounds of differential centrifugation.
The cell fraction samples were used for Western blot of
b-catenin. For immunofluorescence staining, the MC-26 cells
were cocultured with mWPs at ratio of 1:400 on 18-mm
coverslips with or without the test drugs in a 12-well plate
for 18–24 hours.
Western blot analysis
Protein concentration of the cell extracts (whole cell lysates or
subcellular fractions) was first determined by the BCA assay
(Pierce), and then extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, trans-
ferred to PVDF membrane, and analyzed by Western blot analysis
with the indicated antibodies.
mRNA analysis
RNA was extracted from the MC-26 cells supplemented with
aspirin test drugs in the presence or absence of platelets, and
reverse transcribed using Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit
(Qiagen). qRT-PCR was then performed using QuantiFast SYBR
Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) with primers specific for mouse Snail
(Snail forward: 50-GGAAGCCCAACTATAGCGAGC-30; reverse:
50-CAGTTGAAGATCTTCCGCGAC-30). Expression of GAPDH
was used to normalize the data and the relative mRNA analysis
was calculated using the comparative Ct method.
AOM/DSS mouse model of colon cancer
Based upon a previously described technique alone (29),
young (40–50 days old) female Swiss Webster mice were ran-
domly assigned to treatment groups. On the basis of our previous
experience, a minimum of 5 animals per group were needed to
detect significant differences. They were administered a single
intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) at 7.5 mg/kg.
One week after the AOM challenge, the mice were placed on
drinking water containing dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) at 2%,
3%, or 4% for 7 days, and then provided normal diet and drinking
water for the next 2 weeks. The DSS challenge was repeated
two more times (in total 3-cycles of DSS) and the protocol took
10 weeks.
The test drugs, aspirin and Aspirin-PC, at a daily aspirin dose
(20 mg/kg) were administered intragastrically starting a week
before the AOM challenge. The AOM control group was daily
intragastrically administered the same volume of saline. The
absolute control group did not receive AOM, DSS, or test drugs.
During the study, body weight was determined every week as a
measure of general health and fecal samples were also collected
weekly for hemoglobin analysis as a measure of gastrointestinal
(GI) bleeding (potential side effect of aspirin). At the end of the
10-week study period, blood was collected, the mice were eutha-
nized by overdose of isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracot-
omy, and the colon measured in length and weighed and biopsies
taken and snap frozen in liquid N2 for biochemical analysis or
fixed and stained for aberrant crypt foci (ACF) counts and immu-
nohistochemical (IHC) staining; hematocrit was assessed to
detect blood loss due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Whole blood
from the four mice groups were used to isolate PRP, count
platelets, and TXB2 analysis. PRP was further challenged with
2.5 mg/mL of collagen or left untreated (basal). The degree of
platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry using anti-P-
selectin FITC and isotype control antibodies, as published previ-
ously (26).
Cytokine ELISA
Serum or cell culture medium was measured by using the TXB2
EIA kit (Cayman Chemical, catalog no. #501020) or a mouse
VEGF-A ELISA Kit (Pierce, catalog no. #EMVEGFA) according to
the manufacturer's specifications. Sera were collected from the
blood samples of individual mice at the end of the experiment
under terminal anesthesia following a protocol for cardiac punc-
ture. Serum samples were separated from blood within 1 hour
following blood collection by centrifugation at 500 � g for 10
minutes, and then aliquoted and stored at �80�C for subsequent
testing. Cell culture media were collected at the end of the
experiments and cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 � g for 10
minutes and then stored at �80�C for subsequent testing.
Aberrant crypt foci
Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were identified in colonic tissue using
a previously described technique (30). The excised colonic tissue
was opened and placed mucosal-side-up onto paper, fixed in 10%
buffered formalin, and briefly stained with 0.3% methylene blue.
A 40� magnifying lens was used for tissue examination. All
measurements were performed by persons who were unaware of
the treatment group.
Immunofluorescence
The cultured cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
permeabilized by incubation in 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked
with 10% goat serum, and then stained with polyclonal anti-
fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by Alexa-647–conjugated
goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). After-
wards, the samples were stained for f-actin, g-actin by Alexa
Fluor 488 phalloidin and the nuclei by DAPI (Molecular

 Probes/Invitrogen). To assess the presence of platelets in the
colonic mucosa, sectioned colonic tissue mounted on the slides
were stained with a rat anti-CD41 antibody, followed by a FITC-
conjugated goat anti-rat polyclonal antibody, and the nuclei by
DAPI, based upon a previously described technique (31, 32).
Finally, sections were mounted on slides with elvanol
(DuPont). Specimens were then visualized either by Decon-
volution Microscopy employing an Olympus IX-70 micro-
scope connected to a DeltaVision imaging system (Applied
Precision), or Nikon A1R confocal laser microscope system
and the NIS-Elements C software. The quantitation of immu-
nofluorescence density was done using ImageJ software by
measuring pixel units.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the statistics appli-
cation StatView 5.01 (SAS Institute Inc.). Values are expressed as
the mean � SEM, and were evaluated by ANOVA followed by
Fisher PLSD test. The association of colonic tumor mass with
circulation platelet number was evaluated by percentiles by
correlation/covariance. A P value < 0.05 with two-tailed testing
was deemed statistically significant.
Results
Platelet-induced proliferation of colon cancer cells can be
attenuated by aspirin test drugs
We initially assessed the growth-stimulatory effect of platelets
on mouse (MC-26 cells, Fig. 1A) and human (Caco-2, Fig. 1B)
colon cancer cell lines. The ability of both mouse and human
platelets to promote the proliferation of cancer cells within 48
hours was, in turn, dose-dependently reduced by aspirin and
Aspirin-PC, with evidence that the Aspirin-PC may possess greater
growth-inhibitory efficacy, within a dose rangeof 0.1–1.0 mmol/L
(Fig. 1A and B).
The ability of platelets to promote the invasive potential of
cancer cells can be blocked by aspirin test drugs
Using culture plates where the top and bottom chambers were
separated by a porous membrane insert, we investigated the
Figure 1.
Platelet-induced proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells can be attenuated by aspirin test drugs. Mouse or human washed platelets (mWPs or hWPs)
promote the growth of mouse MC-26 (A) or human Caco2 (B) and this effect is blocked by aspirin and Aspirin-PC. C, Evidence that mouse washed platelets (mWPs)
promoted the invasion of mouse MC-26 colon cancer cells, and this effect was blocked by both aspirin and Aspirin-PC. D, Coculture of platelets with colon
cancer cells stimulated medium TXB2 and VEGF levels which were, respectively, inhibited by aspirin and Aspirin-PC. Values in each group were calculated from
triplicates of three separate studies (n ¼ 9).

 ability of platelets to promote translocation/invasion of the
cancer cells to the bottom chamber. The results in Fig. 1C using
MC-26 cells demonstrate that coculture with mouse platelets
promoted invasive activity, as we measured an approximately
20-fold increase in cell number across the membrane. Interest-
ingly, this platelet-induced invasion was dose dependently atten-
uated by addition of the aspirin test drugs to the medium at
concentrations >0.3 mmol/L, with a tendency for Aspirin-PC to be
more effective (Fig. 1C). Coculture of cancer cells and platelets
promoted the generation of the COX-1 product, TXB2, indic-
ative of platelet activation, and both aspirin drugs significantly
reduced TXB2 levels by >80% (Fig. 1D). We also screened the
culture medium for alterations in the concentration of other
growth mediators and determined that the coculture of plate-
lets with MC-26 cells resulted in a significant increase in levels
of VEGF in the medium, which was blocked by both aspirin and
Aspirin-PC (Fig. 1D). In contrast, platelet-derived TGFb1 was
not increased when cocultured with mouse or human cells, and
its release was not affected by either of the aspirin test drugs
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Platelets promote EMT of cancer cells: attenuation with aspirin
test drugs
As platelets have been reported to induce EMT in cancer cells,
we performed in vitro experiments to assess whether aspirin
interferes with the EMT process. We initially observed that, in
addition to a marked increase in cell number, MC-26 cells
underwent a profound morphologic transformation within 48
hours after being cocultured with platelets. Both a change in shape
to a more mesenchymal cell type and the formation of fibronec-
tin-associated microfilamentous structures that formed an extra-
cellular network connecting adjacent cells were seen (Fig. 2A and
B). These platelet-induced morphologic changes were less evident
when aspirin or Aspirin-PC was added to the culture medium
(Fig. 2C). We also demonstrated that platelets promoted the
translocation of b-catenin from the membrane/cytoplasm to the
nucleus as shown by Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions
(Fig. 3A), which was reduced when the aspirin test drugs were
added to the culture medium, with Aspirin-PC being a more
effective EMT inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, platelet coculture
induced an increase in vimentin expression of whole-cell lysates
(Fig. 3C), and similar to the effects on b-catenin, this platelet-
induced precancerous change was reduced if the cells were incu-
bated with the aspirin test drugs with Aspirin-PC being consis-
tently more effective (Fig. 3D). Finally, platelets increased mRNA
expression of Snail (Snai1) in MC-26 cells, an EMT-inducing
transcription factor, which was dose dependently inhibited by
both aspirin and Aspirin-PC (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Antineoplastic efficacy of Aspirin-PC and aspirin in a murine
colon cancer model
The in vivo model system chosen to study antineoplastic drug
efficacy was an established mouse model of colon cancer, in
which a chemical carcinogen that induces colonic dysplasia/
neoplasia, azoxymethane (AOM), is used in combination with
a chemical, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), which induces
colonic inflammation/colitis (schematically depicted in Fig.
4A). This combination induces the formation of aberrant
colonic crypts which progresses to adenoma at an accelerated
rate in comparison with AOM alone (29).
To optimize the DSS concentration, a study was performed to
test cyclic use of 2%, 3%, or 4% DSS in the drinking water after a
single AOM injection. At the end of the study, it was found that the
circulating platelet number was increased dose dependently with
2%–4% DSS, with significant differences observed in AOM/3%
DSS and AOM/4% DSS groups compared with that of the mice in
the saline control group (Fig. 4B). This is in contrast to the lack of
effect of AOM, in the absence of DSS, on platelet number (Fig.4B),
emphasizing the importance of colonic inflammation as the
driver of thrombocytosis. Most interestingly, the ratio of colon
weight to body weight, which is a measure of colonic tumor mass,
was tightly associated (R ¼ 0.82, P < 0.001) with the number of
circulating platelets (Fig. 4C).
Subsequently, we used 3% DSS after AOM to evaluate the
chemopreventive activity of the aspirin test drugs. Mice were
intragastrically administered aspirin or Aspirin-PC commencing
1-week prior to AOM injection, at a daily aspirin dose (20 mg/kg)
that is comparable with low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) in
Figure 2.

 humans. As shown in Fig. 4D, the circulating platelet number
increased in the AOM/DSS/saline group (P < 0.01 vs. controls),
and the aspirin test drugs reversed the thrombocytosis induced by
AOM/DSS treatment (P < 0.05). We also determined that serum
TXB2 levels were decreased 80%–90% (P < 0.01) in the two aspirin
treatment groups (Fig. 4E), indicating that the drugs' ability to
inhibit platelet COX-1 activity, as well as platelet number. Com-
pared with platelets from the control mice, AOM/DSS/saline
treatment appeared to increase basal platelet activation as
observed by an increase in P-selectin staining. Importantly, plate-
lets from the mice treated with aspirin and Aspirin-PC also failed
to demonstrate collagen-induced platelet activation, as measured
by P-selectin expression (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Mice treated with AOM/DSS appeared to gain less body weight
than controls, with only the AOM/DSS/saline group being sig-
nificantly lower than that of the control group at the study's end,
(Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5), suggesting that the animals
developed systemic disease. The measurement of colonic aberrant
crypts presented in Fig. 5A demonstrates that AOM/DSS treatment
increasedthisdysplasticchangein the colonicmucosa (P < 0.001),
and both aspirin and Aspirin-PC treatments were effective
(P < 0.01) in reducing aberrant crypt number toward control
values. In addition, it was found that the colon weight/length in
the AOM/DSS groups was higher than that of the control group
(P < 0.01), which is reflective of mucosal edema/inflammation
and that this ratio was lower in animals in both aspirin treatment
groups (Fig. 5B, P < 0.05). To assess colonic tumor mass, the ratio
of colon weight to body weight was calculated, as shown in Fig.
5C. Consistent with the above observations, there was an increase
in this measure of colonic tumor mass over control values in the
AOM/DSS/saline group (P < 0.01), which was reduced (P < 0.05)
by both aspirin test drugs.
Changes in fecal hemoglobin (Supplementary Fig. S6) reflect
gastrointestinal bleeding at the times of DSS administration,
which was resolved by the end of the study period (week 10).
Furthermore, at euthanasia, the hematocrit did not show any
differences among groups (Supplementary Fig. S7), indicating the
transient DSS-induced gastrointestinal blood loss was not lasting
and there was no detectable gastrointestinal bleeding from any of
the drug treatments. This supports the gastrointestinal safety of

 chronic dosing with the relatively low aspirin dose of 20 mg/kg
dose of aspirin and Aspirin-PC in mice.
Using an immunofluorescent chemical (IFC) stain for CD41
platelet surface integrin, we assessed whether platelets seed into
colonic tissue undergoing dysplasia/neoplasia, and if so, whether
this pattern was affected by treatment with aspirin or Aspirin-PC.
Representative IFC results shown in Fig. 6A and B, provides
evidence that platelets are generally present at a low density and
restricted to the large vessels present in the submucosa of control
colonic mucosal tissue, whereas their number is noticeably
increased within the major blood vessels of the dysplastic/hyper-
trophic colonic mucosa of AOM/DSS–challenged mice with evi-
dence of translocation across the endothelium and traffic to
adjacent submucosal/subepithelial tissues. This morphologic pat-
tern was less evident in the aspirin and Aspirin-PC–treated mice,
where infiltration of the platelets into the submucosa of the
colonic mucosa was rarely observed, which was quantitatively
supported by a reduction in fluorescent intensity of colonic tissue,

similar to values seen in normal (noncancerous) tissue (Fig. 6C).
Discussion
The mechanism by which aspirin use is linked to a reduction
in cancer incidence and metastases has yet to be fully elucidated.
As aspirin consumption has been associated with a reduced
incidence of numerous cancers, it suggests that one way the drug
may act is at a stage which is common for most tissues under-
going dysplasia (1, 11, 12). As tissue inflammation is tightly
linked to many chronic disease states including cancer, and
aspirin has clear anti-inflammatory actions, this drug action
may be an important component in its chemopreventive activity
(1, 33). Indeed, a number of laboratories (34, 35) reported that
colorectal cancer tissue overexpresses COX-2, suggesting it may
be the primary target enzyme by which NSAIDs and notably
COX-2–selective inhibitors (coxibs) reduce cancer incidence
and recurrence. Although this indeed is an attractive theory, it
has a number of limitations. These include evidence that coxibs
have chemopreventive activity that may be limited to familial
adenomatous polyposis patients. In comparison, there is more
compelling evidence for aspirin protection in more common
colorectal cancers such as in Lynch Syndrome (hereditary non-
polyposis) patients (36, 37). Also, not all cancers overexpress
this COX isoform, and Rothwell reported that cancers affecting
the proximal colon, which generally do not overexpress COX-2,
are more responsive to aspirin use than those of the distal colon
(38). Finally, for aspirin to target COX-2 in most cancers and
affect the metastatic spread of tumor cells would require that
aspirin remain stable in circulation. However, pharmacokinetic
data demonstrates that aspirin rapidly hydrolyzes to salicylic
acid within 10–20 minutes after it enters the blood (39), and
salicylic acid has a much lower (100–1,000 fold) COX-2 inhib-
itory activity versus aspirin, especially in tissues undergoing
inflammation (40).
Because of these aforementioned reasons, we felt an alternative
mechanistic basis of aspirin's antineoplastic action needed to be

 explored. Indeed, as indicated earlier, platelets are a primary target
of aspirin and are involved in thrombosis of late-stage cancer
patients. Platelets are known to promote EMT of cells in the early
stage of dysplasia thereby playing a role in cancer cell invasiveness,
attachment, and growth, processes that are thought to be mediated
in part by the release of mediators, notably platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), VEGF, and TGFb (8–10). Thus, as speculated by a
number of investigators (33, 41), the platelet is a likely target of
aspirin, especially as the irreversible inhibition of platelet COX-1
via acetylation, will inactivate theplatelet for its circulatoryhalf-life
(7–10 days in humans and 5–7 days in mice), until a new
generation of platelets enters the circulation via megakaryopoiesis.
Based upon this background, we performed in vitro and in vivo
studies to directly evaluate the role of aspirin's antiplatelet activity
in its ability to inhibit colon cancer growth and invasive potential.
We also evaluated the chemopreventive activity of a novel phos-
pholipid-associated aspirin, which was the result of our labora-
tory studies that showed surface-active lipids, such as phospha-
tidycholine (PC) play an intrinsic role in protecting the gastro-
intestinal mucosa from surface injury, as may be caused by
NSAIDs (42, 43). Subsequently, a family of PC-NSAIDs was
developed that possesses reduced gastrointestinal toxicity, pri-
marily by attenuating the surface-injurious action of NSAIDs,
while maintaining the therapeutic activity of the drugs (44). These
observations were the impetus for the commercial development
of PL2200 Aspirin (PLx Pharma Inc) which combines aspirin with
a PC-enriched soy lecithin. We have previously reported that
PL2200 Aspirin induces significantly fewer gastroduodenal endo-
scopic ulcers than normal aspirin in a 7-day trial of healthy
subjects, aged >55 years, who are most susceptible to the gastro-
intestinal side-effects of NSAIDs (23). PL2200 Aspirin also
appears to have profound antiplatelet activity in both healthy
and diabetic subjects, supporting its potential use for both car-
diovascular disease and possibly cancer. Results described above
demonstrate that platelets promote the growth and invasive
potential of both mouse (MC-26) and human (Caco-2) colon
cancer cells, and that these actions can be dose dependently
blocked by both aspirin and Aspirin-PC. Similar to Hynes and
colleagues' studies (10), weconfirmed that platelets promote EMT
in colon cancer cells, and that these robust platelet-dependent
cellular/biochemical changes can also be blocked by our aspirin
test drugs.
We performed in vivo studies in mice with an established model
of colon cancer that uses a regimen of AOM and DSS (29). It
should be noted that we used this particular model, as it
simulates the colonic inflammation and adenoma formation
that occurs clinically in colorectal cancer, and has been dem-
onstrated to be responsive to NSAIDs and other chemopreven-
tive agents, whereas another colorectal cancer model, APC
(Min/þ) mice demonstrated little or no response to aspirin,
possibly because the polypoid lesions occur primarily in the
small intestine (45). Accordingly, using the AOM/DSS model
we demonstrated that daily treatment of mice with 20 mg/kg of
aspirin or the equivalent dose of Aspirin-PC, significantly
reduced both the formation of aberrant crypts in the colon,
which is a sign of dysplasia as well as colonic tumor mass in
comparison with saline-treated controls. Interestingly, the
AOM/DSS–challenged animals also had elevated platelet
counts, which were reduced in the aspirin-treated groups, with
little difference in the anticancer action observed between
Aspirin-PC and the unmodified NSAIDs. This result thereby
differs from our in vitro results where Aspirin-PC consistently
possessed more pronounced potency/efficacy to inhibit cancer
cell growth and invasive activity. Future experiments will be
designed to provide an explanation for these results. Using the
mouse colon cancer model system, we demonstrated that
platelets migrated into the inflamed colonic mucosa and adja-
cent tumor tissue, appeared to be associated with the vascula-
ture as well as surrounding areas of mucosal inflammation/
dysplasia and this response was reduced in mice treated with
aspirin and Aspirin-PC. These observations are consistent with
studies by Granger's laboratory (46) that reported increased
platelet reactivity in colonic mucosa undergoing DSS-induced
inflammation, and a recent study by Qi and colleagues (31)
that reported the presence of platelets in both intestinal tumors
from APC Min mice and from clinical biopsies of patients with
colorectal cancer, and a study from Miyashita and colleagues
(32) of platelet extravasation into the invasive front of pan-
creatic ductal adenocarcinomas. We extended these very inter-
esting observations, to demonstrate that the ability of platelets
to seed into areas of colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. Using a
similar approach, Guillem-Llobat and colleagues (47) recently
reported that platelet-induced biochemical changes associated
with EMT of human HT-29 colon carcinoma cells was blocked
by COX-1 inhibitors including aspirin.
It is very important to emphasize that the findings presented
above that aspirin's chemopreventive activity is attributable to
the NSAID's ability to irreversibly inhibit platelet COX-1 and
their subsequent activation, has limitations, being generally
correlative in nature, and future experiments are planned to
study aspirin sensitivity in animals where we experimentally
manipulate platelet number and COX expression (e.g., trans-
genic mice where platelet COX-1 is disrupted). Also, it has been
reported that aspirin and related NSAIDs can inhibit cancer cell
growth and/or promote apoptotic activity of cancer cells by
COX-independent pathways, that involve activation of the
tumor suppressor AMP kinase (AMPK), or inhibition of the
transcription factors, NFkB and AP-1 or directly affecting mito-
chondrial function (48, 49).
In summary, our findings suggest that aspirin's antineoplastic
actions can be explained, in part, by the drug's ability to rapidly
inhibit the number/activity of circulating platelets via irreversible
COX-1 inhibition. Thus, our results support the use of low-dose
aspirin for chemoprevention that is sufficient to block platelet–
cancer cell interactions, which play a fundamental role in cancer
formation and progression, while having limited anti-inflamma-
tory activity. These findings address the initial actions of aspirin
on cancer development and do not dismiss COX-2 and its
downstream proinflammatory eicosanoid products as being
important in certain cancers, which remains an attractive target
in explaining the chemopreventive action of coxibs/NSAIDs when
used at anti-inflammatory doses. Finally, we present evidence that
a novel lipid-based aspirin, Aspirin-PC/PL2200 Aspirin, possesses
similar chemopreventive actions to low-dose aspirin and may be
more effective. Future experiments are planned to determine the
efficacy and safety of PL2200 Aspirin in subjects that are at high
risk for the development of colorectal cancer.
