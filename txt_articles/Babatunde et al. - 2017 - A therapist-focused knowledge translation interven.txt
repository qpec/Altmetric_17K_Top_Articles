Abstract
Background: Nonadherence to treatment remains high among patients with musculoskeletal conditions with
negative impact on the treatment outcomes, use of personal and cost of care. An active knowledge translation (KT)
strategy may be an effective strategy to support practice change. The purpose of this study was to deliver a brief,
interactive, multifaceted and targeted KT program to improve physiotherapist knowledge and confidence in
performing adherence enhancing activities related to risk, barriers, assessment and interventions.
Methods: We utilised a 2-phase approach in this KT project. Phase 1 involved the development of an adherence
tool kit following a synthesis of the literature and an iterative process involving 47 end-users. Clinicians treating
patients with musculoskeletal conditions were recruited from two Physiotherapy and Occupational therapy national
conferences in Canada. The intervention, based on the acronym SIMPLE TIPS was tested on 51 physiotherapists in
phase 2. A pre- and post-repeated measures design was used in Phase 2. Graham’s knowledge-to-action cycle was
used as the conceptual framework. Participants completed a pre—intervention assessment, took part in a 1-h
educational session and completed a post—intervention assessment. A questionnaire was used to measure
knowledge of evidence—based treatment adherence barriers, interventions and measures and confidence to
perform evidence—based adherence practice activities. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency
and percentage), Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon Sign-Ranked tests.
Results: Barriers and facilitators of adherence were identified under three domains (therapist, patient, health
system) in phase 1. Seventy percent of the participants completed the questionnaire. Results indicated that 46.8%
of respondents explored barriers including the use of behaviour change strategies and 45.7% reported that they
measured adherence but none reported the use of validated outcomes. A significant improvement in post-self-
efficacy scores for the four adherence enhancing activities was observed immediately after the workshop.
Conclusion: The use of a multi-modal KT intervention is feasible in an educational setting. A brief interactive
educational session was successfully implemented using a toolkit and caused a significant increase in
physiotherapists’ knowledge and confidence at performing adherence enhancing activities in the very short-term.
Further testing of SIMPLE TIPS on long-term adherence practices could help advance best practices specific to
treatment adherence in MSK practice.

 Background
Musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders cause more functional
limitations than any other group of disorders within the
adult population leading to huge healthcare expenditure
and loss of work [1]. Systematic reviews consistently
show that exercise is beneficial for key clinical outcomes
such as pain, physical function, and quality of life [2, 3].
However, exercise adherence is necessary for program
effectiveness, and prevention of recurrent, persistent
and disabling problems [4, 5]. Non-adherence to exer-
cise remains high for many MSK conditions [6, 7] and
negatively affects treatment effectiveness and duration,
personnel use, the therapeutic alliance, waiting times,
and cost of care [8, 9]. The WHO defines adherence as
“the extent to which a person’s behaviour, corresponds
with recommendations from a healthcare professional”
(HCP) [10]. This means the associated barriers, inter-
vention and outcome measures (BIM) for improving
adherence will vary based on the nature of the treat-
ment recommendations from the HCP. For example, a
barrier to home exercise performance could be forgetful-
ness as compared to transportation difficulties to access
clinic-based treatment. Likewise, measuring attendance to
treatment sessions may be sufficient to track clinic exer-
cise adherence as compared to assessment of the patient’s
unsupervised
completion
of
home
exercise.
These
differences would therefore, inform the type of strategy
developed by the HCP in collaboration with the patient to
overcome the challenge of nonadherence to treatment.
Evidence shows that to achieve improved patient ad-
herence to treatment, HCPs like physiotherapists need
to be supported in efforts to implement a decision-
making paradigm that integrates patient preferences,
clinical circumstances, personal experience, and scien-
tific evidence for individual patients [11, 12]. This can be
achieved through knowledge translation (KT) strategies
that optimize how current knowledge can be translated
into clinical practice. However, there is growing recogni-
tion that problems in knowledge generation rather than
KT hinders the knowledge-to-action (KTA) translation
process [13]. Effective knowledge transfer has to balance
objective knowledge from empirical research such as
clinical trials and subjective knowledge such as therapist
and patient experience [13, 14]. This bidirectional ap-
proach to KT is regarded as a way to overcome some of
the obstacles hindering application of available research
knowledge in clinical practice [15, 16]. If physiothera-
pists (PTs) are to play a significant role in promoting pa-
tient adherence, further training on MSK treatment
adherence management is warranted.
According to the WHO empowering HCPs to manage
adherence involves designing context-specific tools adapt-
able to different settings [10]. Specifically, education and
training is required to simultaneously address the areas of
knowledge (information on adherence), thinking (the clin-
ical decision-making process) and action (behavioural
tools). This suggests that PTs and ultimately patients
would benefit from access to specific training and tools for
improved treatment adherence and outcomes. Available
literature recommends closing the gaps in three key
areas: knowledge about instruments for assessing ad-
herence [17, 18], broad determinants and barriers to
adherence [12, 19–21] and how to implement evidence-
based adherence enhancing interventions [22, 23]. This
would increase HCP capacity building for adherence
enhancing activities with a potential to increase treat-
ment outcomes in MSK conditions. The purpose of this
KT study was two fold:
Phase 1 – To develop an evidence-based educational
strategy to improve therapist knowledge about adherence
to treatment and confidence for adherence enhancing
activities.
Phase 2 – To verify its efficacy after a brief interactive
educational session. We hypothesised that the median
differences between pre-workshop and post-workshop
confidence scores would not be equal to zero.
Theoretical perspective
The knowledge creation component started with the
synthesis of the knowledge and previous work in this
area. A brief summary of the explicated principles and
practices revealed that several theories inform treat-
ment adherence. The main theory chosen for this KT
initiative was self-determination theory (SDT) [24, 25],
which aims to increase patient’s autonomous motiv-
ation and perceived competence to take responsibility
for their therapy through the needs supportive environ-
ment created by the therapist. SDT has also been inte-
grated
with
other
theories
to
reduce
redundancy
between theories and utilise each theory’s strength [26].
For example, autonomous motivation from SDT was
shown to be positively associated with attitudes, sub-
jective norms and perceived behavioural control from
theory of planned behaviour for MSK injury prevention
and rehabilitation [27]. The psychological needs of
autonomy and relatedness from SDT also influenced
both self-efficacy theory variables: confidence and out-
come expectation [28]. Thus, adherence to rehabilita-
tion could plausibly be achieved through strategies that
shape the patient’s autonomous motivation by offering
support for valued outcomes, providing rehabilitation
tasks in an autonomy-supportive manner such as ac-
knowledging
commitment,
providing
rationale
and
choice,
and
fostering
competence
and
confidence
through clear feedback on effective preventative and
rehabilitation exercises and strategies.

 Conceptual framework
The Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) cycle [16] guided our
approach to the development and planned implementa-
tion of a knowledge resource about adherence BIM. The
KTA framework contains two key components: know-
ledge creation (knowledge funnel) and knowledge action
(action cycle). Knowledge creation, where ideas are for-
mulated and techniques and products are developed, lies
at the heart of the model as shown in Fig. 1. This
process involves knowledge inquiry (primary studies of
variable quality addressing a specific question), know-
ledge synthesis (a summary of the literature using expli-
cit methods), and knowledge tools/products (knowledge
synopsis that are presented in a clear and accessible for-
mat). Ultimately, it reveals the most refined data that is
valid and useful for dissemination. The action cycle de-
scribes various activities required for knowledge applica-
tions to produce real change as shown in Fig. 1. It
consists of seven phases represented by (1) identifying
the problem, (2) adapting knowledge to local context,
(3) assessing barriers to knowledge use, (4) selecting,
tailoring and implementing interventions, (5) monitoring
knowledge use, (6) evaluating outcomes and (7) sustain-
ing knowledge use. The relationship between knowledge
creation and knowledge action is recognized as fluid and
dynamic, each influencing the other. Figure 2 highlights
the steps in the KTA cycle used in this study.
Rationale for KT strategy
We began this KT initiative by identifying the problem.
In this case, the problem was a dearth of information to
support physiotherapists in MSK practice towards a
variety of treatment adherence enhancing goals related
to identifying and mitigating barriers, interventions for
improving nonadherence and outcome measures for
tracking adherence. When we surveyed the literature in
planning this study, we found no resource in terms of a
decision aid or tool kit available to support clinician’s in
tackling the mounting problem of exercise nonadherence
reported in MSK rehabilitation practice and research. We
had observed anecdotal interest in managing treatment
nonadherence in patients with various MSK conditions
and valued its potential for increasing treatment outcomes
in rehabilitation. The evidence reviewed for this KT

 intervention through completion of two scoping reviews
[Babatunde FO, MacDermid J, MacIntyre N. Characteris-
tics of therapeutic alliance in physiotherapy and occupa-
tional therapy for musculoskeletal conditions: a scoping
review of the literature; Babatunde FO, MacDermid J,
MacIntyre N. Adherence measures for clinic- and home-
based exercise in musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice:
a scoping review of the literature, unpublished observa-
tions] suggests that it would be helpful to create an educa-
tional intervention to increase PT’s knowledge and
awareness about the problem of nonadherence in MSK
physiotherapy. It is anticipated that this approach would
facilitate a paradigm shift in PT perspective that supports
exploring barriers with patients in detail, tailoring inter-
ventions to the needs of the patient and measuring adher-
ence in clinical practice. There has been a relatively low
level of knowledge transfer in this area and significant and
clinically relevant findings from adherence studies have
not been widely implemented in MSK PT practice. Our
focus, therefore, was to create a clinically relevant
knowledge product to empower therapists about strategies
for managing treatment adherence.
Literature review
Evidence on adherence barriers
The WHO Multidimensional Adherence Model proposes
that adherence is determined by the interplay of factors
related to five constructs; socioeconomic, health care sys-
tem, condition, treatment, and the patients [10]. Although,
the available literature suggests over 200 barriers [10],
several barriers to treatment adherence are mainly focused
on patient factors with the relative neglect of determinants
introduced by HCPs such as PTs [29]. A synthesis of the
literature [30] showed strong evidence for the effect of
physical (level of physical activity, in-treatment adherence,
exercise in previous weeks), psychological (self-effi-
cacy, depression, anxiety/stress, helplessness), socio-
demographic (social/family support, barriers to exer-
cise) and clinical (exercise-related pain) barriers in
physiotherapy outpatient clinics. Emerging evidence

 suggests that health care system-related factors such
as the patient-therapist relationship (PTR) may be the
best predictor of exercise adherence in MSK clinical
practice [19]. PTR is partly within the control of the ther-
apist and represents a promising route for promoting ex-
ercise adherence in MSK rehabilitation [19]. Therapist-
related factors such as tone of voice, positive feedback,
empathy, guidance, communication of clear information
and trust contributes to improved adherence to exercise
[31, 32] and improved treatment outcomes [11]. These
factors are potentially modifiable barriers to recovery and
require targeted interventions [18]. There was a dearth of
literature related to barriers introduced by health care
professionals or health organization. In our scoping re-
view, we categorized the different qualities of the therapist
and synthesised the evidence on the relationship between
adherence and patient-therapist relationship.
Evidence on adherence interventions
In view of providing solutions, many adherence inter-
ventions directed towards patients have typically focused
on education for increased knowledge. Single strategies
are less effective for increasing adherence compared to
combined cognitive, behavioural, and motivational com-
ponents [23]. Clearly, interventions to optimize adher-
ence must be extended beyond the provision of advice
since information alone is inadequate for creating or
maintaining good adherence habits. Although there have
been efforts to improve adherence to treatment for
patients with MSK conditions, it seems that they have
had suboptimal effect due in part to shortcomings in
supporting potent behavior change skill sets that can be
adopted in clinical practice [9, 33, 34]. In a Cochrane
review [23] on interventions for MSK conditions, it was
concluded that simple educational and behavioral strat-
egies such as providing feedback or using an exercise
contract, providing supervised exercise, follow-up to
reinforce exercise behavior, supplementing face-to-face
instruction and scheduling convenient treatment times
and allowing for rescheduling may enhance adherence.
Ultimately, combined interventions may be effective at
promoting adherence to exercise. Due to the multidi-
mensional nature of adherence, a broad approach is re-
quired to improve the effectiveness of strategies.
Evidence on adherence measures
Within clinical practice, objective measures of exercise
adherence remain underutilised [17]. Similarly, in rando-
mised controlled trials for MSK disorders, exercise
adherence measures are non-existent or limited by use
of non-standardized instruments that capture only one
domain of adherence [17, 18]. There is currently no gold
standard for measuring exercise adherence and more
than two hundred measures have been identified in MSK
rehab [35]. Only eight measures have been reported to have
evidence of psychometric evaluation: Rehabilitation Adher-
ence Questionnaire (RAQ) [36], Community Healthy Ac-
tivities Model Program for Seniors Activities Questionnaire
for Older Adults [37], Hopkins Rehabilitation Engagement
Rating scale [38], Adherence to Exercise Scale for Older
Patients [39], Sport Injury and Rehabilitation Adherence
Scale [40], Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation [41],
modified rehabilitation Adherence Questionnaire [42],
and Rehabilitation Adherence Measure for Athletic
Training [43]. In the second scoping review on adher-
ence measures completed by our team, we also identi-
fied
several
measures
for
adherence.
They
were
categorised as follows: use (clinic-based, home-based) and
type of measure (questionnaire, log/diary, Likert-like
scale).
Methods
The professional associations approved the session plan
submitted for the two conferences. All participants
agreed to allow their data to be analyzed anonymously
to develop and assess the effectiveness of the project and
signed an informed consent form.
PHASE 1: Development of SIMPLE TIPS
The process of knowledge product development for this
project was initiated by mapping the principles and
practices described in the scientific literature on adher-
ence to exercise for MSK conditions with reference to
the three topic areas of BIM as follows:
1. Overview of exercise adherence barriers and
determinants – Summary of the barriers to
adherence and behavioural mechanisms driving
adherence related to the patient and the therapist.
2. Interventions for creating or maintaining exercise
habits – Summary of behaviour change techniques
and tools, choosing best available interventions,
developing coping plans, action plans and goal
setting.
3. Clinically useful outcome measures – Summary of
methods for assessing adherence using home diaries,
single-item questionnaires and multi-item
questionnaires.
This is important because there is no single strategy
deemed effective for managing treatment adherence
across all patients, conditions and settings. Conse-
quently, strategies have to be tailored to individual pa-
tients [10].
Secondly, we used an iterative process in developing
the tool because the information needs to be applicable
across a range of MSK practice settings and client popu-
lation. We understood that the final content and format

Page 5 of 16
 would emerge through team interactions and feedback
from potential users.
Setting: The Canadian Society of Hand Therapy (CSHT)
conference held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in June 2015
Participants: Forty eight participants attended the ses-
sion and included PTs (n = 7) and occupational thera-
pists
(OT)
(n = 41).
All
participants
consented
to
participate in this KT project. Participants were from
various clinical practice settings for adults with MSK
conditions. All but four of the participants practiced in
Canada. Ten percent ran a private practice.
Session: In order to involve end-users in the develop-
ment process, we conducted a breakout session titled
“Understanding adherence to treatment in hand therapy:
focus on barriers, outcome measures and interventions”.
The session was targeted at therapists to increase aware-
ness about the areas of BIM. This session was an invited
session facilitated by one of the investigators (FB). The
1-h interactive session also sought feedback on three
key areas of relevance, accessibility, and format and
method that are deemed contributory to the value of
KT initiatives for health professionals [44]. Enquiries
on practice, patient categories and strategies for identi-
fying barriers to adherence, measuring adherence and
managing nonadherence were included during discus-
sion. The session was audio recorded and key themes
summarized from the transcripts. Feedback from the
first session was used to develop the educational inter-
vention that was used in Phase 2.
The overall challenge we faced in developing a KT tool
was how best to present the information to therapists in a
useable format that is easily retrievable from memory in
clinical practice. Due to the extensive amount of informa-
tion obtained and necessary for consideration by thera-
pists, we decided to present the information using the
mnemonic; “SIMPLE TIPS”. We anticipated that this
would facilitate easy uptake of information from a large
volume of literature within a short period of time. This
was based on a similar approach proposed for managing
adherence to medication by Atreja et al. [45] using the
word “simple”. We categorised key points from therapist’s
feedback and evidence from primary and secondary re-
search based on areas of BIM to develop the educational
intervention: SIMPLE TIPS tool (Table 1). This was used
in Phase 2 and available on request from the authors.
PHASE 2: Delivering educational intervention and
verifying results
Setting: The Canadian Physiotherapy Association annual
congress on June, 2015.
Participants: All PTs managing adults with neuromuscu-
loskeletal disorders were targeted for this study. Participants
were approached at the door as they entered the venue of
the workshop by a graduate student who explained the
evaluation component of the session. Consenting re-
spondents were given the questionnaire and instructed
to complete the pre-workshop questions before the ses-
sion started. It was assumed that all participants read
and understood the session focus as documented in the
conference plan provided to every participant upon
registration for the conference.
Session: The educational session was titled “Understand-
ing Adherence to Exercise in Musculoskeletal Physiother-
apy; Focus on Barriers, Interventions and Measures led by
the principal investigator (FB). The session was included
under the theme “Joint and Health” for the mini sympo-
sium on Exercise and Physiotherapy for the conference on
June 18, 2015. The format included 35 min interactive
PowerPoint presentation and 15 min small group discus-
sion using a clinical vignette followed by 10 min of ques-
tions
and
answers.
Learning
strategies
of
teaching,
discussion, and reflection in practice was used in delivering
the session. The session was delivered using principles
from problem-based learning and concepts shown to be
effective at delivering new information to HCPs based on
adapted clinical vignettes [46]. According to Peabody et al.
[47, 48] clinical vignettes are a special type of clinical
teaching case scenario used to measure professionals’ or
trainees’ knowledge and clinical reasoning. They are short
descriptions of a person’s health situation which contain
precise references to what are thought to be the most
important factors in the decision-making process of re-
spondents. Vignettes require respondents to apply their
knowledge to a situation, much like they would need to do
in a real clinical encounter. This is opposed to choosing
from a fixed list of multiple choice options.
There were two aspects to this session: physiothera-
pist’s knowledge and confidence to apply evidence-based
information in the areas of MSK treatment barriers, ad-
herence outcome measures and adherence interventions
in their clinical practice. The aim of the session was that
participants would be able to do the following by the
end of the session: select appropriate outcome measures,
describe the various determinants of adherence to exer-
cise, identify evidence based strategies for improving
short and long term adherence to exercise, and apply
the most up to date literature on exercise adherence to
mitigate the problem of nonadherence in MSK rehabili-
tation clinical practice. The primary outcomes were par-
ticipant’s knowledge and confidence to apply evidence-
based adherence enhancing activities related to barriers,
measures and interventions.
A pre-post repeated measures evaluation plan was
used. This included a pre-intervention assessment before
the session (Time 1) and a post-intervention assessment
immediately after the session (Time 2). On the day of
the brief interactive session, prior to beginning the inter-
vention (Time 1), the participants were prompted to
Babatunde et al. Archives of Physiotherapy  (2017) 7:1 
Page 6 of 16
 reflect on their current clinical practice to answer the
pre-workshop questions. This was followed by the lec-
ture which ended with discussion of the clinical vignette
(Additional file 1). Participants were encouraged to
complete the post education questionnaire during the
question and answer period or drop complete or incom-
plete questionnaires on their chairs before exiting the
room for their next scheduled educational event. The
facilitator encouraged the participants to provide feed-
back on the format, shared evidence and personal plan
to use evidence in practice. The responses were used to
write-up a summary of the KT workshop. Attendance
and participation feasibility was explored by examining
the percentage of those who attended the session, took
the questionnaire and returned it.
Questionnaire
Questionnaire items were designed to identify current
and future practices for supporting adherence to exercise
during clinical practice. The questionnaire as shown in
the appendix (Additional file 2) was divided into two
parts; part A was completed before the session started
and part B was completed at the end of the session. In
Part A, subgroups of items were used to evaluate the per-
sonal learning objective, assessment of barriers, measuring
exercise adherence, strategies for improving adherence,
and confidence to perform adherence enhancing activities.
In Part B, subgroups of items were used to evaluate quality
of the session, experience at the session, confidence to
perform adherence enhancing activities, fulfillment of

 learning objectives, recommending session to others,
significant highlight of session and immediate goal for
utilizing knowledge in practice. Items were added to the
top of the questionnaire to evaluate respondent demo-
graphics, practice characteristics and work setting. The
primary source of items were survey tools by Jette et al.
[49] and Daudle et al. [50] designed for evaluating physio-
therapists behaviour and confidence to implement re-
search evidence in clinical practice. Refer to Additional
file 2 for details. The confidence (self-efficacy) to perform
adherence enhancing activities was measured (pre- and
post) using an 11-point scale that was developed in adher-
ence to guidelines for developing self-efficacy scales [51].
Four items were generated to evaluate self-efficacy to
perform each of the following steps of facilitating adher-
ence to exercise according to the WHO [10].: (1) identify
patients with potential for poor adherence, (2) assess bar-
riers to exercise, (3) use an outcome measure to assess
adherence to exercise, and (4) intervene to improve adher-
ence in practice. To complete the scale, respondents were
asked to rate their level of confidence in their ability to
perform each activity, using an 11-point scale ranging
from 0% (“cannot do at all” to 100% (“certain can do”).
Item-level responses were averaged to obtain a summary
score ranging from zero to hundred percent.
Six physiotherapists working in education and research
(n = 2), Neuromusculoskeletal rehabilitation (n = 2), ortho-
paedic outpatients (n = 1), private practice (n = 1) reviewed
the questionnaire and the adherence self-efficacy scale and
verified their face validity and relevance. The question-
naire was designed to facilitate completion of each part in
5 to10 min and some questions were re-worded to
enhance clarity based on the feedback provided.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were
used to summarize all variables. Preliminary analysis
revealed that for the “disagree” and “strongly disagree”
categories of the participants experience and the “poor”
and “below average” categories of rating of workshop
quality, many participants did not input any data. Given
the absence of utility data for those categories, subse-
quent analysis focused on the other categories, namely
“average”, “above average”, “excellent” for workshop
quality and “strongly agree”, “neutral” “agree” for re-
sponse on the participant’s experience. The proportion
of respondents rating of whether they measure adher-
ence or explore adherence with patients was compared
among respondents working across three practice settings
(private practice, hospital outpatients/rehabilitation and
inpatient/acute care), geographical region (Maritimes,
Central, Prairies) and experience (≤10 years, >10 years)
with Fisher’s exact due to small sample size and violation
of

square
test
assumptions
using
predicted
proportions for expected values. The Wilcoxon sign
ranked procedure was used to analyse the difference in
confidence between pre- and post-self-efficacy scores. This
nonparametric test was selected because the distribution
scores were positively skewed and did not meet paramet-
ric assumptions. A non-directional test was performed
with alpha set at 0.05. All data were managed and analysed
using Stata© statistical software (version 13).
Results
All participants in Phase 1 indicated that adherence to
treatment was a big issue in their current practice and
they were interested in strategies for managing this
problem. The interaction revealed significant knowledge
gaps in the areas of BIM for MSK treatment adherence.
Only six participants formally assess patient adherence
during clinical practice and this involved mostly the use
of logs and diaries. Participants were not aware of any
valid and reliable instruments for assessing adherence to
therapy recommendations. Barriers and facilitators iden-
tified during the discussion with therapists are summa-
rized in Table 2. Seven participants were aware of
behavioural interventions for adherence and only two re-
ported formal training in this area. Majority of the par-
ticipants reported that there are few opportunities for
professional development in this area of MSK practice
and more KT strategies are required to communicate
the evidence. The following feedback was provided on
the format and method of a feasible clinic focused KT
resource: providing access to a downloadable resource
through PT and OT organizational websites, webinar or
audio recorded presentation between 45–60 min, and
development of a MSK rehabilitation focused toolkit and
reference list.
Educational Intervention
Fifty one out of 87 PTs who attended the workshop gave
consent
and
received
the
questionnaire;
42
were
returned out of which 35 questionnaires were completed
(70%). Table 3 highlights the participant characteristics.
In summary, most respondents were female (57%), had
more than 20 years’ experience (28%), and practiced in
Nova Scotia (34%). The greatest proportion of respon-
dents worked in facility-based outpatients (25%) and
private practice (17%) settings. Less than 15% worked in
acute care, rehabilitation or academic/research settings.
The least represented setting were school, industrial and
animal rehabilitation (<5%). Orthopaedics/MSK was the
most therapist specialty (42%). Few therapists (<10%)
managed neurological and pediatric conditions while
fewer (<5%) managed cardiorespiratory and women
health conditions. More than half of respondents (57%)
were eager to learn about strategies for improving pa-
tient
adherence,
while

 instruments for assessment and identifying barriers. Less
than 5% of respondents were interested in application of
content of the session in research.
Barriers to Adherence
Thirty two respondents answered the question about
exploring barriers with patients. Almost half (46.8%),
reported that they assess barriers, 25% were unsure about
assessing adherence and 28% stated that they do not as-
sess barriers to exercises. Among the respondents that an-
swered yes or maybe, 42% (15/25) further highlighted the
strategies used to understand barriers to exercise. Only
one participant reported the use of an outcome measure;
the Tampa scale of Kinesiophobia [52], to capture poten-
tial barriers. Three respondents reported the use of the
stages of change model [53], two respondent mentioned
exploring self-efficacy [54]. Use of open-ended questions
on transportation, time issues and home exercise compli-
ance (seven respondents) and monitoring attendance (two
respondents) was also reported. Respondents that explore
behaviour change techniques were those with more ex-
perience (>10 years). The proportion of respondents rat-
ing whether they assess barriers by experience, practise
setting and region of practice is reported in Table 4. There
was significant between-group difference for where clini-
cians were practicing (p = 0.04).
Measuring treatment adherence
With respect to measuring adherence, 45.7% of the re-
spondents do so routinely while 25.7% and 28.5% were
unsure or do not measure adherence respectively. The
three most common techniques for measuring adher-
ence were objective change (27.7%), subjective question-
ing (27.7%) and exercise demonstration and quality
(27.7%). Only 11% of respondents utilised attendance
records or accurate exercise recall or exercise diaries/
logs. Others provided stickers (5.5%) to patients for their
calendars. The proportion of respondents rating whether
they measure adherence by experience, practise setting and
region of practice is reported in Table 3. There was signifi-
cant between-group difference for where clinicians were
practicing (p = 0.035). More PTs in facility based inpatient
and outpatient practice were more likely to assess adher-
ence compared to those who practice in private practice.
Reported adherence enhancing strategies
Ten themes emerged from analysis of the response to the
question about how participants currently address patient
adherence as shown in Table 5 and Fig. 3. Nearly 60% of
respondents reported that they manipulate some aspect of
exercise prescription to improve adherence. For example,
prescribing less than four exercises, incorporating activ-
ities into daily routine, prescribing exercises based on

 patient preference and ensuring proper technique were
highly represented. Some forms of education such as en-
suring patients understand the rationale for treatment was
the most reported strategy and used by 38%. Motivational
and behavioural strategies such as behaviour change
techniques and focusing on progress were incorporated by
32.3%. Use of technology and visual aids such as re-
minders and logs and goal planning were each reported by
nearly a third of respondents. About a quarter of the
respondents utilise visual aids and goal planning. Treat-
ment variables such as supervision or working in groups
or with a buddy were included in current practice by 17%.
Patient-related interventions and communication each
accounted for 11% of current strategies. The least used
strategy was function-based outcomes which represented
about 5% of responses.
Session impact and quality
Most respondents judged six of seven qualities as “above
average” and “excellent” as shown in Fig. 4. Most re-
spondents agreed that they advanced their knowledge
through participation in the session as shown in Fig. 5.
Sixty percent considered the workshop beneficial for ad-
vancing their knowledge on importance of assessing
adherence. Many respondents (71%) reported that the

 session was beneficial at increasing awareness of adher-
ence interventions. An increase in knowledge on out-
come measures and barriers to adherence was reported
by 57% and 54% of participant’s respectively. Less than
10% felt their general insight into importance of adher-
ence and measuring adherence remained unchanged.
Approximately 15% reported their level of knowledge
about assessing barriers to adherence was unchanged.
Very few participants (<5%) were unable to determine if
they were better equipped to manage nonadherence.
Most participants agreed that the session was impactful
for all aspects of the intervention (Fig. 5).
Self-efficacy for adherence enhancing activities
Participants reported confidence in their own ability
to develop and implement strategies to improve ad-
herence (Table 6). A Wilcoxon signed-Ranks test indi-
cated that the post workshop scores were significantly
higher than pre workshop scores for adherence risk
identification (z = 4.42, p = .0001), assessing adherence (z =
4.45, p = .0001), managing adherence (z = 4.53, p = .0001)
and implementing strategies to improve adherence (z =
4.66, p = .0001).
Planned Adherence Enhancing Strategy
Twenty-five participants provided an immediate plan of
action for the next 2 to 4 weeks based on their experi-
ence at the workshop. As shown in Table 7 most partici-
pants (52%) reported that they would like to start
incorporating some form of objective assessment of ad-
herence in their future clinical practices. Approximately,
32% planned to utilize some of the interventions from
knowledge shared into current practice while 28% would
seek to improve their communication skills through for-
mal and informal training opportunities. Participants
that intended to start considering potential barriers ac-
tively with patients or develop a personal learning plan
in response to knowledge gained through the session
were 16%. One participant’s view remained unchanged
with the assertion that all the responsibility still lies with
the patient.
Discussion
In this article, we outline an example of how an inte-
grated KTA process involving both researchers and clini-
cians was used to develop and test the effectiveness of a
tool kit for translating MSK exercise adherence princi-
ples into strategies adaptable in clinical practice. The
results of this KT project are very insightful and showed
that PTs have a generally positive regard for evidence-
based practice for adherence to exercise in MSK re-
habilitation. In both sessions, several physiotherapists
reported that understanding the concept of adherence is
paramount to implementing exercise interventions suc-
cessfully. The key educational component of this KT
strategy was the development of the acronym - “SIMPLE
TIPS” from a summary of relevant and highly cited arti-
cles from the exercise adherence literature. This ap-
proach was well received based on feedback from the
participants in both sessions.

 In the main KT intervention, respondents showed an
increase in confidence in adherence enhancing activities
after the session. Overall, the session quality was rated
as above average and there was strong agreement that
the brief session was impactful. However, very few use
objective measures of exercise adherence or explore bar-
riers to exercise with their patients. No respondent was
able to identify any validated physiotherapy instruments
for assessing exercise adherence used in their clinical
practice. Furthermore, most of the strategies suggested
for improving patient adherence were patient related.
These findings are surprising in view of the recent ex-
pansion in the exercise adherence literature and the im-
portance PTs attach to enhancing adherence. Therapists
want current research evidence to be presented in sim-
ple and adaptable forms that clinicians can implement in
practice with minimal additional burden on limited time.
Therapists in private practice asserted that change in
practice would require tools that do not put additional
burden on limited time to deliver care. Similarly, support
from managers or practice leaders facilitate adoption of
research into public health settings. This findings sup-
ports the evidence that clinicians refer to the pressures
of the health care environment and administrators’ em-
phasis on productivity as barriers that directly inhibit
their ability to locate, appraise and adapt research evi-
dence into daily clinical practice [55].
This brief KT educational session was designed to
bridge the gap between research and clinical practice for
adherence to MSK rehabilitation. The goal was to
present evidence-based information using an interactive
format that both inform and challenge therapists to re-
flect on current practice and become knowledgeable
about strategies for enhancing patient adherence to
treatment in their individual practice. To our knowledge,
this is the first KT intervention using an active strategy
to translate research to clinical practice for exercise ad-
herence among PTs. A recent systematic review of KT
strategies in allied health professions by Scott et al. [56]
included 11 KT interventions in PT with only two stud-
ies [57, 58] reporting a consistent positive effect for the
main outcome. One study showed sustained positive at-
titude and beliefs about evidence based practice was re-
ported in one of the two studies [39]. Most of the
studies were focused on the management of MSK condi-
tions or use of clinical practice guideline, used single or

 multiple intervention, assessed professional/process out-
comes and involved participants ranging from 4 to 114
PTs. The authors concluded that the most effective strat-
egy for disseminating of research evidence to allied
health professions remains unknown.
In the absence of a consensus on the ways to measure
adherence, assess barriers to adherence or enhance adher-
ence in MSK practice, this KT project is a step in the right
direction towards communicating available research evi-
dence to clinicians. This then allows clinicians to use their
clinical judgement to determine what is best practicable in
their individual clinical settings. It is accepted that passive
interventions such as postal dissemination do not auto-
matically lead to use in practice or change in practice [59].
Active strategies are therefore preferred. For example,
Bekkering et al. [60] showed that an educational session
(two 2 h sessions), feedback and use of reminders resulted
in a moderate improvement in guideline-consistent behav-
iour among physiotherapists treating low back pain com-
pared to disseminating guidelines by mail alone. Similarly,
Brown et al. [61] utilised a 1 h presentation as the primary
strategy among multiple interventions for disseminating
information on falls prevention. The authors concluded
that the focused nature of the education strategy was
responsible for the reported increase in use of fall preven-
tion practice behaviours. These findings infer that there
are some benefits to brief educational sessions. To the
contrary, a correlation between the length of educational
input and likelihood of change in PT practice has been
reported [33]. The use of opinion leaders to initiate KT
interventions while highly regarded have only had little
impact on MSK rehabilitation clinical practice or out-
comes [62].
The decision to utilise conferences as an avenue for this
KT project was informed by the evidence suggesting that
PTs continue to make clinical decisions primarily based on
knowledge gained from peers, continuing education confer-
ences, and entry-level education rather than knowledge
translated from individually sourced research evidence [59].
PTs are expected to use a decision-making paradigm that
combines patient preferences, clinical situations, personal
experience, and scientific evidence into an optimal clinical
decision for an individual patient [63, 64]. However, little
attention has been paid to the best ways in which to sup-
port the effort of PTs in the area of adherence to exercise.
This is further highlighted by the fact that less than 20% of
the respondents had earlier received any type of training to
improve understanding and skill development in the three
areas relevant to improving adherence practices in muscu-
loskeletal rehabilitation. Ultimately, PTs have to maintain
responsibility for their own continuing professional devel-
opment. Nonetheless, with over 30,000 biomedical journals
published each year and estimates that a clinician needs to
read 19 articles each day to stay up-to-date [58], it is

 reasonable to develop more KT initiatives and tools to
facilitate clinician access to research evidence.
Limitations
The nature of this KT outreach and evaluative project
does not permit generalization to a larger population.
Instead, the focus was on describing the current evi-
dence for managing nonadherence in patients with MSK
conditions, the development and implementation of an
educational tool aimed at improving therapist knowledge
and attitude for a group of PTs. Among the limitations
of this project include the lack of validity of the ques-
tionnaire used and low reliability of some of the items.
The questionnaire used was developed using similar
items to those surveyed in the study PTs by Jette et al.
[49] and Daudle et al. [50] However, these studies were
focused on a general view and barriers to evidence based
practice for PTs managing patients with Stroke. Using
instruments that are reliable and valid is essential to
strengthen the evidence that could be drawn from sur-
vey studies. The findings from the analysis could have
been skewed by a higher response rate from members of
the CPA more interested in adherence and therefore,
more positive about it. No effort was made to control
for external circumstances that may have impacted the
participants’ attitudes, beliefs and behaviors during this
project. For example, all the participants may have read
the abstract prepared for the session before attending
the session. This could have led to a positive regard for
and understanding of adherence to exercise. There was
also a low number of respondents in this project (87
accessible PTs, 58% gave consent, 42% completed ques-
tionnaire). This project was not conducted in a typical set-
ting
and
we
assume
that
nature
of
professional
conferences where clinicians have to attend multiple ses-
sions in one day may have caused the low response. Fi-
nally,
the
short
educational
session
used
may
be
inadequate to facilitate the substantial behaviour change
required to ensure that the evidence communicated is
retained and adopted into clinical practice. A direct meas-
ure of practice behaviour would have been a preferred
way to assess sustained positive effect of the increased
confidence to perform adherence enhancing activities
among the PTs surveyed.
Practice implications
The outcome of this KT project has implications for the
educational, research and clinical communities. The
findings show that therapists in MSK rehabilitation
highly regard adherence enhancing activities as contribu-
tory to improving patient outcomes but feel inadequate
to intervene at various levels. The education community
can play a role in providing continuing education at clin-
ical sites and local provincial regions to facilitate adher-
ence enhancing skills in practice who to a great extend
include exercise therapy in the management of MSK
conditions. Despite the increasing evidence on tools for
assessing adherence, this remains a poorly implemented
routine in clinical practice. This implies the need to ex-
press research information in a way that encourages
clinicians to apply evidence in their daily practice. We
are currently designing a website to promote access to
current evidence on adherence to exercise. It would also
be beneficial to partner with local physiotherapy bodies
to facilitate the development of an adherence enhancing
toolkit since this is believed to promote adoption of con-
sistent behaviour in clinical practice [62]. This could
then be made available in various formats including a
training manual, website and app to provide a simple
stop for clinicians to access published evidence in sum-
mary format and potentially overcome barriers of lack of
time reported by clinicians [63]. The delivery of educa-
tional outreach sessions’ provided at the therapists’
workplace with an actual patient has also been suggested
and shown to be effective [63] for facilitating KT and
hopefully eventual behaviour change.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a brief active strategy involving a 1 h inter-
active educational session was successfully implemented
and caused an increase in physiotherapists’ knowledge
and confidence at performing adherence enhancing activ-
ities. Despite this, it cannot be inferred that this would
actually lead to a change in long term adherence
