 Dislocation remains a common cause of failure after total 
hip arthroplasty. The limitations of existing approaches to 
address instability have led to the development of pow-
erfull options: constrained liners, dual mobility and large 
heads. These implant-related options have proven to be 
very efficient, but have raised concerns.
 
 With constrained liners, restricted range of motion (ROM) 
is responsible for impingement leading to high likelihood 
of failure, depending on the design, with various failure 
modes.
 
 Improvements of the bearing materials have addressed some 
of the concerns about increased volumetric wear of conven-
tional polyethylene and offer an option to reduce instability: 
large diameter heads have the advantage of increased ROM 
before impingement, increased head-neck ratio, and jump 
distance. Highly cross-linked polyethylene helps address 
the risk for increased wear, and also large heads provide 
improved stability without the risk of mechanical failures 
observed with constrained liners. However, the increase of 
the head size remains limited as reducing the thickness of 
the liner may lead to fractures. In addition, the jump dis-
tance decreases as the cup abduction increases.
 
 The dual mobility concept simultaneously attempts to 
address head-neck ratio, constraint, and jump distance. 
Despite the need for longer follow-up, concerns raised 
about potential increased wear and intra-prosthetic dislo-
cation with first generation implants have been addressed 
with modern designs.
 
 With a dramatic increase of the head-neck ratio whilst 
reducing the risk of mechanical failure or excessive wear, 
dual mobility THA outperforms large diameter heads and 
constrained liners at 10 years follow-up. For these reasons, 
dual mobility continues to gain interest worldwide and is 
becoming the most popular option to manage instability.

Introduction
Despite the fact that total hip arthroplasty (THA) is com-
monly reported with successful results, instability remains 
a disappointing complication and one of the most com-
mon reasons for revision. Prevalence of instability has 
been reported ranging from 0.2% to 7% after primary 
procedures and can reach 10% and even more after revi-
sion surgery.1
Despite numerous surgical options which have been 
proposed, treatment of instability remains a challenge, 
and highly variable success rates have been reported. Re-
operation for instability is known to carry the highest like-
lihood of failure of any re-operation after THA2 with 
re-dislocation rates ranging from 20% to 40%.3,4
With better understanding of the causes of dislocation 
and development of improved and powerful technologies 
over the last decade, improved rates of prevention of insta-
bility or restoration of stability are anticipated. Selection of 
the implant is one of the critical steps to prevent unstable 
THA. Three main options that provide some protection 
against dislocation have emerged: constrained liners, dual 
mobility implants, and use of large diameter femoral heads.
A literature review of each of these options follows with 
particular attention to the clinical results, and advantages 
and disadvantages are identified.
Constrained liners
The use of constrained liners has been reported with 
encouraging results in restoring stability in revision THA 
for recurrent dislocation. Therefore, constrained implants 
gained interest in the late 1990s and have become one of 
the most popular options worldwide to treat instability. 
Many manufacturers have produced various commercial 
implants, but there are two prevailing designs of con-
strained liners. In the first, the liner extends beyond a 
hemisphere with polyethylene extended around the rim 
and with an inner diameter of the opening that is smaller 
than the prosthetic head. Reduction of the head within the 
liner is achieved through mechanical expansion of the 
inner diameter of the rim. An external metal ring is locked 
to the liner to prevent it from re-expanding (Fig. 1).
In the second design, the constrained tripolar implant 
(Stryker Howmedica Osteonics, Rutherford, NJ) consists of 
a bipolar component locked into an outer polyethylene 
liner during the manufacturing process. The opening of

the liner has an embedded metallic locking ring. The bipo-
lar component consists of a 22 mm, 28 mm, or 32 mm 
prosthetic head that snaps into a polyethylene shell with a 
polished cobalt-chrome backing. It is free to rotate, but is 
locked in place by a second inner retaining ring (Fig. 2).
A literature review of the use of constrained implants 
reported a mean rate of dislocation of 10%, and a mean re-
operation rate, for reasons other than dislocation, of 4%, at 
a mean follow-up of 51 months (range 24 to 124 months).5
Efficacy of constrained devices has been shown to be 
design-dependent. Dislocation rates have been reported 
ranging between 4.5% and 29% with the S-ROM cup.6,7 
The tripolar constrained design provided better short-
term results with dislocation rates ranging from 2.9% to 
3.5%,8 and 6% to 7% at ten years.9,10
Berend et al11 reported a ten-year follow-up of 667 
constrained THAs with an overall dislocation rate of 
17.5%.
Limitations of constrained implants
Both designs of constrained implants result in a restricted 
range of motion (ROM) and have a greater prevalence of 
impingement of the femoral neck on the cup. Impinge-
ment is responsible for high stress transmission to multi-
ple interfaces, leading to liner damage, locking mechanism 
failure, dislocation and loosening (Fig. 3).
Unacceptably high failure rates have been reported 
with the use of constrained devices. Berend et al11 reported 
a long-term failure rate of 42.1% with the tripolar con-
strained implant, while Labek et al12 reported a 100% fail-
ure rate using the Duraloc constrained inlay (Depuy/
Johnson and Johnson, Warsaw, IN). Survival at 10.2 years 
was 90% with the tripolar constrained implant using com-
ponent failure as the end-point, and 68% for all modes of 
failure.10 A review of the failed tripolar constrained 
implants at the Mayo Clinic found an average time to fail-
ure of only 28.4 months, with a total failure rate of 11%.13 
Five different modes of failure had been identified. Because 
of the complexity of the design, mechanical failures were 
found at most of the device interfaces. Impingement was 
involved in the occurrence of all types of mechanical 
failure.

numerous parts, is shown. The bipolar component (22, 28 or

cobalt-chrome backing and locked in place by a retaining ring) 
is locked into an outer polyethylene liner with an embedded 
metallic locking ring during the manufacturing process.

A modified design of constrained device has been pro-
posed, with strategically positioned polyethylene cut-outs 
to provide significant improvements in ROM in flexion, 
internal rotation, extension and external rotation.14 A 12% 
re-dislocation rate and a 3% rate of revision for cup aseptic 
loosening at only 1.8-year follow-up has been reported in 
a series of patients treated for recurrent dislocation with 
this device.15
Dual mobility
Dual mobility is a concept first introduced by Bousquet in 
the late 1970s. Such a system combines both the large 
head articulation and low friction arthroplasty concepts. 
In a dual mobility articulation, the interposition of a mobile 
ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) 
component between the prosthetic head and the highly 
polished inner surface of an outer metal shell provides 
two bearings (Fig. 4).
In so doing, the dual mobility system provides a 
greater effective head size and improved head-to-neck 
ratio (Fig. 5). Dual mobility is therefore expected to 
improve the ROM to impingement and joint stability. 
Laboratory studies have confirmed this assumption and 
have emphasised the advantages of dual mobility over 
conventional implants.16,17 Computer simulation studies 
have demonstrated greater posterior jump distance with 
dual mobility implants than with standard hemispherical 
fixed bearings.18
With dual mobility systems, in vitro motion preferen-
tially occurs at the inner bearing and the outer bearing 
engages at the extremes of motion. Analysis of retrieved 
implants has shown wear patterns at the outer surface of 
the mobile UHMWPE component, confirming that mobil-
ity in vivo occurs at the two bearings.19,20 Better under-
standing of the biomechanics of dual mobility has led to 
improvements of the original design and modern, newer-
generation implants have become available, with 
enhanced cementless cup fixation, optimised geometry, 
and improved bearing materials (Fig. 6).
The use of either a dual layer coating of hydroxyapatite 
and titanium plasma spray, or a porous metal coating 
with modern dual mobility implants (stainless steel or 
cobalt-chromium outer shell) has improved mid-term sur-
vivorship.21 Long-term survivorship of modern dual 
mobility implants are promising but are not yet available.
In addition, specific designs have been developed in 
order to secure the press-fit fixation in cases with limited 
bone stock (Fig. 7). In cases with severe bone loss, the use 
of cemented dual mobility implants into a cage is a relia-
ble option to consider.22
Various newer geometries with subtle modifications of 
the original cylindrospherical design of the cup have been 
offered by manufacturers during recent years: hemispher-
ical, subhemispherical, or anatomical cups are currently 
available in order to improve the prosthetic ROM free of 
impingement, and to avoid psoas tendon-to-cup 
impingement.
As dual mobility systems have raised concerns regard-
ing the potential for increased polyethylene wear, highly 
cross-linked polyethylene, has recently been introduced. 
Results of in vitro wear tests support the use of highly 
cross-linked polethylene, with a significant reduction in 
wear of at least 85% under adverse conditions and over 
97% under pristine conditions when compared with a sin-
gle articulation hip with conventional polyethylene.23 
Even in cases with excessive cup abduction, in vitro wear 
patterns of dual mobility implants using highly cross-
linked polyethylene compare favourably with conven-
tional implants.24 Clinically, encouraging reports with the 
use of highly cross-linked polyethylene are emerging; 
however, follow-up remains limited to date.25-27

Fig. 4 The dual mobility concept: exploded view (a) and 
assembled view (b). The mobile polyethylene component 
between the prosthetic head and the inner surface of the metal 
cup provides two bearings (inner between the prosthetic head 
and the polyethylene component, and outer between the 
polyethylene component and the outer metal shell).
Fig. 5 The dual mobility concept : the prosthetic head 
(22.2 mm or 28 mm) is snapped into the mobile UHMWPE 
component and is free to rotate, and the outer surface of the 
mobile component articulates against the outer metal shell. 
Therefore the head-to-neck ratio is increased as the mobile 
polyethylene component increases the effective head size 
which actually corresponds to the outer diameter of the mobile 
polyethylene component.

Clinical reports on the use of first-generation dual 
mobility implants have emphasised the efficiency of the 
concept in preventing instability.28,29
Over the past ten years, the number of clinical reports with 
the use of modern designs of dual mobility implants both for 
primary and revision procedures has risen. Most of these 
studies are observational. In primary procedures, the use of 
dual mobility systems has been reported with low dislocation 
rates, ranging from 0% to 4.6% both in patients at risk for 
dislocation and in non-selected patients (Table 1). Unlike con-
ventional implants, the cumulative risk for dislocation does 
not increase with time with dual mobility systems.29
Dual mobility has also been reported with remarkably 
low dislocation rates in revision THA, ranging from 0% to 
1.4% at short- to mid-term follow-up.40-43 In the challenging 
situation of unstable THA, revision is known to carry a high 
probability of failure.2 Reports on the use of modern dual 
mobility systems in such situations have demonstrated the 
efficacy of dual mobility to restore stability, with short- to 
mid-term re-dislocation rates ranging from 0% to 5.5% 
(Table 2).
Limitations of dual mobility systems
With an additional bearing, dual mobility systems have 
raised concerns of whether or not wear might be increased 
compared to a conventional bearing. Clinical reports on 
the use of the first generation of dual mobility implants 
have shown encouraging results, with global survival rates 
as high as 81% at 15 years, 75% at 20 years, and 74% at 22 
years.29 In addition, wear measurements from retrieved 
first-generation dual mobility implants have confirmed low 
wear rates.20 With improved designs of modern dual mobil-
ity systems, six-year survivorship has been reported as high 
as 100%, but no long-term survivorship data are yet 
available.52
As described previously, highly cross-linked polyethyl-
ene has been introduced to optimise wear resistance in 
dual mobility. However, to date, despite encouraging 
early results, the long-term benefit of highly cross-linked 
polyethylene has not been clinically demonstrated.
Intra-prosthetic dislocation (IPD) is another potential 
limitation of dual mobility systems.53 This specific failure 
mode has been revealed with the experience of the first 
generation of implants, and occurs when the prosthetic 
head dislodges from the mobile polyethylene component. 
An incidence of 2% to 4% of such a complication with the 
first generation of implants had been reported.28,29 As the 
main mechanism for such a complication results from 
polyethylene wear at the retentive rim of the polyethylene 
component, IPD is typically a long-term complication. 
With substantial improvements of the head/neck geome-
try, recent reports have demonstrated a dramatic decrease 
of the incidence of IPD ranging from 0% at 6 years52 to 
0.28% at 10 years36 with the newer generation of implants 
using conventional polyethylene.
The recent introduction of highly cross-linked polyeth-
ylene with modern designs has raised concerns regarding 
the possibility of increased risk of IPD, because of the 
potentially reduced mechanical properties and fatigue 
strength of irradiated polyethylene.54 Damage in the 
retentive area may lead to IPD. For this reason, despite 
encouraging early clinical results at between two and five 
years’ follow-up,26 and because sporadic reports of early 
IPD have recently emerged,55,56 the long-term benefit of 
highly cross-linked polyethylene in dual mobility systems 
is not yet clinically demonstrated.
Large diameter heads
Although dislocation is multi-factorial, head size has been 
recognised to have a strong influence on stability. Increas-
ing the head size results in an increase of the head-to-neck

 Constrained liners, dual mobility or large diameter heads to avoid disloCation in tha

ratio, improvement of the range of motion to impinge-
ment, and an increase in the amount of displacement 
required before the head dislocates.57 This has led to an 
increasing use of large diameter prosthetic heads over the 
last decade.58 Multiple studies have emphasised the benefit 
of large heads in reducing dislocation rates. However, the 
use of larger head sizes has raised concerns regarding wear. 
Advances in bearings (hard-on-hard bearings, and highly 
cross-linked polyethylene) with improved wear properties 
have led to renewed interest in the use of large heads, and 
have expanded prosthetic head options from the traditional 
sizes of 22 mm, 28 mm and 32 mm to diameters as large as 
60 mm. Crowninshield et al.59 have demonstrated an almost 
linear increase in the prosthetic ROM free of impingement 
with an increase in the femoral head diameter from 22 mm 
to 40 mm. In addition, the displacement required for dislo-
cation substantially increased with the head size. However, 
increasing cup abduction greatly reduces the stability 
advantage of larger femoral heads, and may lead to 
increased tensile stress at the periphery of the polyethylene, 
material deformation, implant failure and dislocation. 
Despite an increase in ROM to impingement with increasing 
head size from 22 mm to 38 mm, Burroughs et al60 did not 
observe a significant benefit going from 38 mm to 44 mm in 
terms of prosthetic impingement.
Other clinical studies with large femoral head sizes have 
been reported with reduced dislocation rates. Lombardi 
et al61 reported a dislocation rate as low as 0.05% in a 
series of 2020 THAs using greater than 36 mm heads. Stroh 
et al62 reported a significantly higher rate of dislocation 
with small diameter heads (1.8%) compared to the large 
diameter heads (0% with 36 mm or 40 mm diameters).
In a prospective randomised clinical trial comparing 
dislocation rates between revision THAs using 36 mm and 
40 mm head diameters on one hand, with 32 mm head 
diameter on the other, Garbuz et al63 reported a signifi-
cantly reduced dislocation rate with the larger heads 
(1.1% versus 8.7%).
Lachiewicz et al64 reported a 4% rate of early disloca-
tion using 36 mm and 40 mm diameter heads in a series 
of 122 primary hip arthroplasties performed in patients 
presumed at high risk for dislocation.
Available larger diameter material combinations include 
metal or ceramic on highly cross-linked polyethylene and 
metal-on-metal. The use of large head metal-on-metal 
bearings has been largely abandoned as national joint reg-
istries have shown significantly higher failure rates.65,66
Large ceramic heads are available commercially in sizes 
up to 48 mm. Ceramic-on-ceramic bearings have extremely 
low wear rates, and ceramic-on-polyethylene bearings are 
also reported with attractive low wear rates.
Limitations of big heads
Despite the finding that large femoral heads have clearly 
decreased the risk of instability, they have raised some

concerns regarding potential downsides. Larger diam-
eter heads are responsible for increased volumetric 
wear. Reduced thickness of the polyethylene with larger 
head size may also lead to early failure, because of 
increased stress within the material. Development of 
highly cross-linked polyethylene has partly diminished 
these concerns with significant improvement of wear 
resistance.67 However, concerns regarding the potential 
for mechanical failures and fractures with thinner poly-
ethylene liners remain as sporadic cases have been 
reported.68,69
In addition, large metal heads have raised concerns 
regarding the potential adverse local tissue reactions 
(ALTR) secondary to corrosion and metal release at the 
head-neck taper junction.70 Increasing the head size gen-
erates large torsional forces at the trunnion-head junction, 
and significantly increases the maximal principal stress in 
the neck medial area, regardless of the material used for 
the head (Cobalt-Chrome or Alumina).71 These torsional 
forces potentiate tribocorrosion72 and probably lead to 
ALTR.
The use of large heads has also been reported with 
potential anterior hip pain and groin pain secondary to 
impingement against the iliopsoas muscle or tendon.73,74 
The recent introduction of antomically-contoured heads 
to address this potential disadvantage of big heads has 
not been evaluated as yet.
Summary
Constrained liners, dual mobility and large diameter fem-
oral heads are powerful and efficient options to prevent or 
to treat THA instability. Before choosing one implant, the 
arthroplasty surgeon should be aware of the design con-
cept, the advantages, disadvantages and outcome data. 
He also has to keep in mind that the surgical techniques 
remain critical whatever the selected implant.
Constrained liners have been reported not only with 
inconsistent results on stability related to the design of 
the constraining device but also with a high risk for 
mechanical failure because of high stress transmission. 
Large diameter heads require the use of alternate bear-
ings such as highly cross-linked polyethylene or ceramic 
in order to address the concern about increased wear. 
However, thickness of the liner and risk for fracture of 
polyethylene or ceramic remains a concern. The dual 
mobility concept simultaneously attempts to address 
head-neck ratio, constraint, and jump distance. Unlike 
those reports regarding the use of constrained devices 
and large heads, recent reports show no evidence of 
increased wear nor risk for mechanical failure with mod-
ern designs of dual mobility at 10 years’ follow-up. Dual 
mobility therefore continues to gain interest worldwide 
and is becoming one of the most popular current options 
to manage unstable THA.
