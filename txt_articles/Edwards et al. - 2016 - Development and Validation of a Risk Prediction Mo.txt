IMPORTANCE Patient selection for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) should
include assessment of the risks of TAVR compared with surgical aortic valve replacement
(SAVR). Existing SAVR risk models accurately predict the risks for the population undergoing
SAVR, but comparable models to predict risk for patients undergoing TAVR are currently not
available and should be derived from a population that underwent TAVR.
OBJECTIVE To use a national population of patients undergoing TAVR to develop a statistical
model that will predict in-hospital mortality after TAVR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patient data were obtained from the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy (STS/ACC TVT) Registry.
The model was developed from 13 718 consecutive US patients undergoing TAVR in centers
participating in the STS/ACC TVT Registry from November 1, 2011, to February 28, 2014.
Validation was conducted using 6868 records of consecutive patients undergoing TAVR from
March 1 to October 8, 2014. Covariates were selected through a process of expert opinion and
statistical analysis. The association between in-hospital mortality and baseline covariates was
estimated using logistic regression. The final set of predictors was selected via stepwise variable
selection. Data were collected and analyzed from November 1, 2011, to February 28, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital TAVR mortality.
RESULTS The development sample included 13 718 patient records from 265 participant sites
(of 13 672 with data available, 6680 men [48.9%]; 6992 women [51.1%]; mean [SD] age, 82.1
[8.3] years). The final validation cohort included 6868 patients from 314 participating centers
(3554 men [51.7%]; 3314 women [48.3%]; mean [SD] age, 81.6 [8.8] years). In-hospital
mortality occurred in 730 patients (5.3%). The C statistic for discrimination was 0.67 (95% CI,
0.65-0.69) in the development group and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.62-0.69) in the validation group.
The final model covariates (reported as odds ratios; 95% CIs) were age (1.13; 1.06-1.20),
glomerular filtration rate per 5-U increments (0.93; 0.91-0.95), hemodialysis (3.25; 2.42-4.37),
New York Heart Association functional class IV (1.25; 1.03-1.52), severe chronic lung disease
(1.67; 1.35-2.05), nonfemoral access site (1.96; 1.65- 2.33), and procedural acuity categories 2
(1.57; 1.20-2.05), 3 (2.70; 2.05-3.55), and 4 (3.34; 1.59-7.02). Calibration analysis demonstrated
no significant difference between the model (predicted vs observed) calibration line (−0.18 and
0.97 for intercept and slope, respectively) compared with the ideal calibration line.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry have been used to
develop a predictive model of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing TAVR. Validation
based on a population of patient records not used in model development demonstrates
discrimination and calibration indices that are more favorable than other models used in
populations with TAVR. This model should be a valuable adjunct for patient counseling,
local quality improvement, and national monitoring for appropriateness of selection of
patients for TAVR.

A
ccurate risk prediction models for cardiac procedures
are an essential component of patient-centric care. The
Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American
College of Cardiology (ACC) have produced several statistical
models to predict procedural outcomes based on patient char-
acteristics and disease severity.1-4 Risk models perform best
when developed from a population undergoing the specific
procedure that is the focus of the model.5-8 At present, STS and
ACC models are based on populations undergoing well-
established conventional procedures.
In recent years, this array of conventional cardiac proce-
dures has been augmented by transcatheter aortic valve re-
placement (TAVR). TAVR was developed to provide a treat-
mentoptionforpatientswithcriticalaorticstenosiswhoarenot
optimalcandidatesforsurgicalaorticvalvereplacement(SAVR).
This population includes patients with a prohibitive or a high
riskforSAVRmortality.TocomparetheexpectedresultsofSAVR
vs TAVR in a given patient, we must develop TAVR risk models
that are based on large populations of patients who have un-
dergone TAVR. This ability to assess patient risk preopera-
tivelyisakeyelementinpatientselection9-12;yet,toourknowl-
edge,nowell-acceptedstatisticalriskmodelhasbeendesigned
specifically for the population undergoing TAVR.5,6,9,13-17
General agreement exists that a population undergoing
TAVR will be necessary to develop a model that performs
well.5-7,17,18 In the United States, a national registry was devel-
opedin2011tocaptureallcommercialTAVRcases.Withthesup-
port of the US Food and Drug Administration, numerous stake-
holderscollaboratedtocreatetheSTS/ACCTranscatheterValve
Therapy (TVT) Registry.18-20 Using this rich source of real-
world clinical information from virtually all commercial TAVR
cases in the United States, we have developed a statistical pre-
dictivemodelofin-hospitalmortalitybasedentirelyonapopu-
lation of more than 13 000 patients undergoing TAVR.
Methods
The outcome for this model is in-hospital mortality. The ACC
and STS have designated Chesapeake Research Review Incor-
poratedastheirinstitutionalreviewboard.ATVTRegistrypro-
tocol was submitted to Chesapeake Research Review Incor-
porated, which approved this study and granted a waiver of
informed consent.
Study Cohorts
TVT Registry Population
The appropriate clinical indication for TAVR was determined
by at least 2 cardiothoracic surgeons. In general, the patients
undergoing TAVR were considered to be unsuitable for or at
extreme risk with SAVR. Patients underwent radiographic and
echocardiographic assessment to ensure anatomy appropri-
atefortheTAVRdevice.PatientswereofferedTAVRonlyiftheir
expected survival was at least 1 year.
Development and Validation Samples
The analysis data set included procedures performed from
November 1, 2011, to February 28, 2014. From a starting popu-
lation of 13 887 TVT records, we excluded 169 records (1.2%)
with missing data for in-hospital mortality. The validation
sampleincluded6868consecutiveproceduresperformedfrom
March 1 to October 8, 2014. The development and validation
populations had similar clinical characteristics.

approachtoaccessowingtopatientfactorsbeyondtheircontrol.
For this reason, the inclusion of nonfemoral access as a poten-
tial covariate was believed to be appropriate.
The association between discharge mortality and base-
line covariates was estimated via logistic regression. A com-
bination of forward and backward steps was used. Using rec-
ords from the development sample, the final set of 9 predictors
(eTable 2 in the Supplement) was selected via forward step-
wise variable selection with P ≤ .05 to enter and P ≤ .05 to stay.
Each forward-selection step was followed by 1 or more back-
ward elimination steps. The selection process was termi-
nated if no additional variables could be added at P ≤ .05 or if
the current model was identical to a previously tested model.
Model covariates were highly complete, with most candi-
datecovariateshavinglessthan2%missingdataandonly1can-
didate covariate having more than 3% missing data (ejection
fraction [3.2%]). In the rare case of missing data, unknown val-
ueswereimputedtothemostcommoncategoricalvariableand
to the median or subgroup-specific median of continuous vari-
ables. Multiple imputation was not used because of the very
low rate of missing data and because multiple imputation had
a negligible impact in models previously developed by the STS
and ACC in cohorts with similarly low rates of missing data.1-3
Statistical Analysis
We decided to perform stepwise selection after performing
MonteCarlosimulationsandbootstrapresamplingtoassessthe
consistency of variable selection across randomly resampled
data sets. The multivariable association model covariates and
mortality were summarized by reporting odds ratios with ap-
proximate95%CIs.Confidenceintervalswereconstructedwith
empirical (sandwich) SEs to account for the clustered data
structure. Clustered data refers to the lack of statistical inde-
pendence between patients within the same hospital. Analy-
ses were performed from November 1, 2011, to February 28,
2014, using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc) and R (version
3.0.3; https://cran.r-project.org) software.

of predicted risk among patients in the validation sample. The
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was also used for ob-
jective assessment of calibration. We conducted a test of over-
fitting in the validation sample by estimating the association of
in-hospital mortality and each patient’
s predicted log odds of
mortality according to the final model. The test was per-
formed by fitting a univariable logistic regression with dis-
charge mortality as the outcome variable and the patient’
s pre-
dicted log odds of mortality according to the final risk model as
the only explanatory variable. A perfectly calibrated model has
an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1. A Wald test was used to as-
sesswhethertheactualestimatedvaluesweresignificantlydif-
ferent from these ideal values. Discrimination was assessed by
calculating the C statistic (the area under the receiver operat-
ing characteristics curve) among patients in the validation
sample.
Results
From a starting cohort of 6877 patients undergoing TAVR from
March 1 to October 8, 2014, we excluded 9 patients with miss-
ing discharge mortality status, for a final validation cohort of
6868 from 314 participating sites (3554 men [51.7%]; 3314
women [48.3%]; mean [SD] age, 81.6 [8.8] years). The final
model covariates were age, glomerular filtration rate, hemo-
dialysis, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class
IV,severechroniclungdisease,nonfemoralaccesssite,andpro-
cedural acuity. Procedural acuity, sometimes termed opera-
tive priority, refers to the patient’
s preprocedure clinical state
that determines the urgency of the procedure. Higher-acuity
status is associated with higher degrees of acute clinical com-
promise and the need for more urgent intervention. Defini-
tions are listed in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
In the development sample, the final study cohort in-
cluded 13 718 records from 265 participant sites (of 13 672 with
data available, 6680 men [48.9%]; 6992 women [51.1%] mean
[SD]age,82.1[8.3]years).In-hospitalmortalityoccurredin730
patients (5.3%). The model coefficients and odds ratios with
95% CIs for each covariate are given in Table 1. The model
intercept was −4.72976. The C statistic was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.65-
0.69) in the development sample and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.62-
0.69) in the validation sample.
Calibration plots were generated using predicted vs ob-
served results, as described above. To obtain objective quan-
tification of the degree of calibration, the overall calibration
line was compared with a line demonstrating perfect calibra-
tion (intercept, 0; slope, 1). The model values of −0.18 and 0.97
for intercept and slope, respectively, were not significantly dif-
ferent from the perfect calibration line. As shown in eTable 3
in the Supplement, we found no significant difference in the
validation sample in the slope and intercept of the model cali-
bration line and an ideal line denoting perfect calibration.
As shown in Figure 1, we found good agreement between

Discussion
This model based on TVT Registry data demonstrates excel-
lentcalibrationintheoverallpopulationandinimportantclini-
cal subsets. Model discrimination as measured by the C sta-
tistic is higher than that for previously reported models that
have been used in the population undergoing TAVR.5,6,21
The STS risk models and the logistic European System
for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation models5 were devel-
oped to predict risk in conventional surgical procedures such
as SAVR. In addition, these models have been used to predict
risk in the population with TAVR, but because the models
were not specifically developed from a patient population
undergoing TAVR, their application in this context is
questionable.5,6,9,13-17
The TVT Registry provides an ideal source of informa-
tion on virtually all commercial TAVR cases in the United
States. The National Coverage Determination from the Cen-
ters for Medicaid & Medicare Services18 specifies that reim-
bursement is contingent on participation in a national regis-
try with an array of specifications, all of which are met by
the TVT Registry. This stipulation indicates that virtually all
patients with TAVR are entered into this registry, thereby
creating a real-world database of the TAVR experience. The
registry now has more than 20 000 patient records with
detailed pre-TAVR clinical information and post-TAVR out-
comes, including procedural mortality. This information
provides an ideal substrate for the development of a statisti-
cal model designed to predict procedural outcomes.
End Point Selection
The Steering Committee of the TVT Registry has been com-
mitted to the development of a series of risk models that will
be based on TVT Registry data. The initial outcome to be mod-
eled was selected after a thorough review of collected data. In-
hospital mortality is a clearly defined outcome with obvious
clinicalimportanceandahighdegreeofcompleteness,thereby
making it the best candidate for modeling at the present time.
Subsequent models based on survival of 30 days and longer
are planned (see below).
Covariate Selection
Theselectionofcovariatestookintoaccountthenecessarybal-
ance between inclusion of the most important risk factors on
one hand and a desire for reasonable parsimony on the other.
We began with an initial set of candidate variables (eTable 1
in the Supplement) and through a process of expert opinion
reduced the number to 14. Further statistical analysis deter-
mined that reducing the set to 9 covariates (eTable 2 in the
Supplement) had no effect on model performance indices. Af-
ter this process by the development task force, the covariates
were scrutinized by the entire TVT Registry Steering Commit-
tee to arrive at the final set of 9 risk factors. This set of risk fac-
tors will be subject to continuous evaluation and is certain to
change as more data are gathered into the TVT Registry.

Model Performance Compared With Other Models
Validation of the TVT Registry model was performed using a
training set–test set approach. The model was developed
from a population of 13 718 records and validated against a
population of 6868 records that had not been used in model
development.
DiscriminationwasassessedusingtheCstatistic.22,23When
recently used in a population with TAVR, the C statistic was
reported to be 0.60 for the standard STS valve mortality risk
model and 0.53 for the European System for Cardiac Opera-
tive Risk Evaluation.5 The STS model C statistic was found to
be 0.62 when applied to the specific TVT Registry validation
sample used in the present study. The C statistic of 0.66 for
the TVT Registry model presented herein is an improvement
over the previously reported C statistic for the standard STS
valve mortality risk model,5 the European System for Cardiac
OperativeRiskEvaluation,5andtheFrenchAorticNationalCore
Valve and Edwards 2 (FRANCE-2) model.21 Only the TVT Reg-
istry and the FRANCE-2 models are based solely on a popula-
tionwithTAVR.Acomparisonofcovariatesusedineachmodel
is shown in Table 2. We should also mention that the slope and
intercept of the TVT Registry model calibration line demon-
strated considerable improvement over the calibration data for
the STS risk model and European System for Cardiac Opera-
tive Risk Evaluation model when used in a population under-
going TAVR.5
Application
Thismodelwasdevelopedtoassesspatient-leveloutcomepre-
dictions, in contrast to other models that have been devel-
oped for comparison of center-level risk-adjusted outcomes.
The performance of the TVT Registry model compared with
other models indicates that the TVT Registry model may have
a role in patient selection. The model results should not dic-
tate which patients are candidates for TAVR; rather, the model
should be used as 1 element in the selection process to be con-
sidered in concert with history, physical examination, labo-
ratory information, and clinical judgment. The model may also
provideusefulinformationforpatientcounseling.Patientsmay
be advised of their predicted TAVR procedural mortality based
on a national risk-adjusted analysis of real-world patients with
a clinical profile similar to their own. This expected TAVR mor-
tality can be compared with the risk for SAVR mortality as de-
termined from existing STS models that are derived from a
broad national population. The TVT Registry model predicts
in-hospital mortality, whereas the STS SAVR model predicts
30-day mortality.
As data accumulate, the TVT Registry model should yield
valuable information about the evolution of the clinical pro-
file of those patients undergoing TAVR. The change in the pre-
dicted risk over time will provide an objective way to monitor
for indication creep associated with a liberalization of proce-
dural indications over time. This type of analysis may well de-
fine clinical subsets of patients who accrue particular benefit
from the procedure or, conversely, reveal subsets not well
served by TAVR.
Thevalueofprovidingindividualcenterswithrisk-adjusted
outcome data for comparison against national benchmarks is
widely recognized.3,24,25 This information will be provided to
TVT Registry participant sites several times each year so that
local quality programs can monitor risk-adjusted results in this
challenging population. The reports will be based on TVT Reg-
istry model data and will be presented in a manner that facili-
tates the identification of areas that could be improved.
Limitations
Although the model adjusts for numerous key covariates, not
all risk factors could be included. Frailty indices such as the
5-m walk test of gait speed26 and quality-of-life measures such
as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire26 are gen-
erally recognized as potentially important factors, but at this
point they are incompletely collected, thereby precluding con-
siderationinthemodel.Usingdatatakenentirelyfromtheearly
TAVR experience, the selected risk factors in this model may
not include covariates that will eventually be found to influ-
ence mortality. In keeping with the design of the TVT Regis-
try, patients enrolled in pivotal trials are not included in the
registry. All data in the TVT Registry are subject to internal data
qualitychecks;however,theexternalauditprocessisinitsearly
stages and data quality cannot be ensured completely. An in-
dependent auditing group was scheduled to begin formal
audits in 2015.18
Future Models
The model presented herein is the first of a series of risk
models that will be developed by the TVT Registry. A model
for 30-day mortality is particularly important because an
appreciable number of patients undergoing TAVR survive
the hospitalization but succumb within 30 days. Data for
30-day mortality are more difficult to capture because
30-day follow-up requires contacting patients after dis-
charge. Aggressive efforts are under way to ensure a high
rate of data return for this critical variable so that it can be
the focus of upcoming models.

The TVT Registry is collecting data to determine 1-year sur-
vival. The 1-year survival information requires linking with the
Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services data in a challeng-
ing administrative process. At this early stage of the registry,
these data are sparse, but in the near future adequate infor-
mation for modeling should be possible.
The ability to predict and risk adjust for nonfatal outcomes
is essential for this high-risk population. Models to predict the
probability of neurologic deficit are now being developed, and
other nonfatal outcome models will be added in the future.
Patient frailty is determined by a preprocedure 5-m walk
test.26 In the elderly population with TAVR, frailty may be an
important risk factor for periprocedural complications and
longer-term procedural benefit.27-29 In the last 2 years, frailty
data are available for approximately 75% to 80% of patient
records. As more complete frailty data become available, the
impact of frailty will be examined statistically to determine its
value as a covariate. Frailty will likely be included as a covar-
iate in forthcoming TVT Registry risk models.
The TVT Registry is one of the few clinical registries to col-
lectquality-of-lifedata.TheKansasCityCardiomyopathyQues-
tionnaire is administered before and at 30 days and 1 year af-
ter the procedure. Information gained from the Kansas City
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire can serve as a general index
of procedural benefit. Linking this information to the wealth
of clinical data in the TVT Registry will enable the creation of
models that can predict the probability of the TAVR benefit.
This link will be especially valuable in the population under-
going TAVR and should be taken into account with predicted
survival data. For example, a patient may have a favorable pre-
dicted TAVR mortality but a low probability of procedural ben-
efit. Information of this kind will be readily available in this
new generation of risk models that should be powerful
adjuncts in the process of appropriate patient selection.
Conclusions
Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry from 2011 to 2014 have
been used to develop a predictive model of in-hospital
mortality for patients undergoing TAVR. We used 13 718
patient records to develop the model and 6868 patient rec-
ords not used in model development for validation. The vali-
dation process demonstrated discrimination and calibration
indices that are more favorable than other models that have
beenusedinpopulationsundergoingTAVR.Thismodelisbeing
incorporated into the standard TVT Registry software and
should be a valuable adjunct for patient counseling, perfor-
mance assessment, local quality improvement, and national
monitoringoftheappropriatenessofpatientselectionforTAVR.
