Our experiences, even as adults, shape our brains. Regional differences have been
found in experts, with the regions associated with their particular skill-set. Functional
differences have also been noted in brain activation patterns in some experts. This
study uses multimodal techniques to assess structural and functional patterns that
differ between experts and non-experts. Sommeliers are experts in wine and thus
in olfaction. We assessed differences in Master Sommeliers’ brains, compared with
controls, in structure and also in functional response to olfactory and visual judgment
tasks. MRI data were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry as well as automated
parcellation to assess structural properties, and group differences between tasks were
calculated. Results indicate enhanced volume in the right insula and entorhinal cortex,
with the cortical thickness of the entorhinal correlating with experience. There were
regional activation differences in a large area involving the right olfactory and memory
regions, with heightened activation specifically for sommeliers during an olfactory task.
Our results indicate that sommeliers’ brains show specialization in the expected regions
of the olfactory and memory networks, and also in regions important in integration
of internal sensory stimuli and external cues. Overall, these differences suggest that
specialized expertise and training might result in enhancements in the brain well into
adulthood. This is particularly important given the regions involved, which are the first to
be impacted by many neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Several studies have assessed the development of new skills in adulthood and associated changes
in brain structure. Diverse areas of expertise have been studied including taxi driving and
hippocampal volume (Maguire et al., 2000), juggling and visual and motor regions of the cortex
(Draganski et al., 2004), musicians and the auditory cortex (Bermudez and Zatorre, 2005), and
more recently expertise in perfume has been associated with olfactory regions of the frontal
lobe (Delon-Martin et al., 2013). Similarly, there have been studies looking at distinct functional
activation patterns in experts. For example, musicians show a distinct pattern of prefrontal activity
compared with non-musicians when listening to different rhythms (Chen et al., 2008), perfumers

MRI Characteristics of Sommeliers
show distinct patterns of activation in the olfactory regions and
hippocampus when imaging smells (Plailly et al., 2012) and even
sommeliers, or wine experts, showed enhanced regions of the
memory network when tasting wines during an fMRI study
(Pazart et al., 2014). Sommeliers’ brains are of particular interest
since their expertise is centered on the chemo-senses, olfaction
and gustation, but associated with multiple other functions
including memory, judgment, and the amalgamation of this with
other senses. The olfactory regions are relevant to diseases such
as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, where initial neurodegeneration
is isolated to regions important in smell. Furthermore, given
that sommeliers are experts not just in a single domain (e.g.,
olfaction and gustatory) but combine these, we felt that they may
have specialization in regions important in integrating sensory
information.
While several studies have assessed either structural or
functional differences in experts, few look at both in the same
cohort. It seems likely that there is a mechanistic relationship
between functional and structural changes in brains as they gain
expertise. In highly complex activities and areas of expertise that
are multi-faceted in nature, regional structural differences may
tell only part of the story. The same regions should show both
functional and structural differences between experts and non-
experts. Here, we investigate the differences between the brains
of Master Sommeliers and non-wine-experts with an emphasis
on multimodal analysis analyzing both structural and functional
brain differences.
Sommeliers are experts in wine. Master Sommeliers have
worked their way to the top of their field. In addition to
depending heavily on their sense of smell and taste, sommeliers
learn to draw on their memory and other senses, notably vision.
Specifically, sommeliers use mental imagery, such as imagining
the fruits and vegetables in a grocery store, when judging wine.
This is part of the Deductive Tasting Method by which they
are trained and which they use in their examinations, including
the blind tasting component1. By the end of their training, they
have accumulated a wealth of knowledge linked to the smell of
the wines, which is always evaluated prior to tasting. Thus, we
expected the sommeliers in our study to show enhanced size and
activity of regions important in olfactory memory, multimodal
integration, designation of hedonic value, and emotional salience.
We further expected the differences in functional activation to
be specific to olfactory-based tasks, not tasks in other sensory
modalities.
Prior studies have pointed to the right hemisphere as being
dominant for many aspects of olfaction, including olfactory
memory (Jones-Gotman and Zatorre, 1993). Visual imagery
has been shown to involve all aspects of the visual system,
even primary regions (Klein et al., 2000; Slotnick et al., 2012).
Integration of sensory and meta-cognitive data is frequently
associated with the insula. The anterior insula bilaterally has
been shown to be critical in olfactory and gustatory integration
(Craig, 2011; Seubert et al., 2013; Small et al., 2013). It is
also considered important in integrating sensory stimuli across
modalities, and assigning hedonic value and emotional salience
1https://www.mastersommeliers.org/resources
to stimuli [e.g., disgust (Calder et al., 2000)]. We thus expected
sommeliers and non-expert controls to differ in activation of
regions in the right hemisphere important in memory, olfaction,
vision, as well as the insula. Perception, familiarity and labeling
of odors have been shown to involve regions of the frontal lobe
including the orbitofrontal regions and anterior cingulate (Royet
et al., 1999; Gottfried and Dolan, 2003; de Araujo et al., 2005)
so these regions may also be involved in the process under
investigation.
There is limited literature on imaging of olfactory expertise.
In a structural neuroimaging study, perfumers showed increases
in gray-matter volume in the bilateral gyrus rectus, and the
anterior piriform cortex, the latter correlating with experience
(Delon-Martin et al., 2013). Functional neuroimaging studies
have also been conducted in sommeliers while they tasted (as
opposed to smelled) wine. The authors of one such study
explored gustatory processing of wine compared with glucose in
seven sommeliers and seven non-experts (Castriota-Scanderbeg
et al., 2005), and found enhanced activation of the anterior
part of the left insula, adjoining orbitofrontal cortex, as well
as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally in sommeliers.
In a similar study comparing 10 sommeliers with 10 controls,
participants underwent a “blind taste test” during scanning
(Pazart et al., 2014). During the tasting phase of this study there
was enhanced activation for the sommeliers in the right anterior
insula, as well as the hippocampus and regions in the occipital
cortex. However, prior to tasting wines, sommeliers always use
olfaction to make decisions and judgments about the wine that
they are about to experience. Olfaction has been shown to be
more consistently unilateral (right dominant) whereas gustation
seems to involve both hemispheres (de Araujo et al., 2003).
There have been no studies, to date, assessing the differences
between activation patterns in sommeliers and those without
special expertise in wine during the smelling of wine, despite this
being a stage in the process when they make their initial and most
complex judgments.
Studying experts in olfactory memory is important given that
the regions involved in this task are frequently the first impacted
by neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s (Braak
and Braak, 1995; Gomez-Isla et al., 1996) and Parkinson’s disease
(Scatton et al., 1983; Braak et al., 2003). By studying structural
and functional differences in experts who likely learned most
of their specialized skill during adulthood, we will understand
more about the plasticity of these regions important in aging, and
perhaps inform future interventions.
This study examined whether structural brain differences were
evident in sommeliers and if they correlated with accumulated
years of experience. Such findings have been reported in other
expertise groups (7). This correlation would be important since
it would suggest a response to increased training and practice, as
opposed to a pre-existing difference in their brains which may
have predisposed sommeliers to becoming experts in their field.
We also assessed differences between experts and controls during
functional tasks associated with wine-judgments and compared
these to visual judgment tasks, since we wanted to assess specific
differences in the skill-set unique to sommeliers, not perceptual
judgment more widely.

MRI Characteristics of Sommeliers
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics
All methodology was reviewed and approved by the Cleveland
Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the imaging study.
Pilot data used for stimuli-selection were collected at the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, under a protocol approved by
their IRB.
Participant Selection and Recruitment
Master Sommeliers were recruited with the assistance of JJ,
Master Sommelier and extensively involved in both training of
sommeliers and in the local community. After being approached
informally by him and allowing their contact details to be shared,
they were contacted by DB or SB to ascertain interest. All
Master Sommeliers were considered eligible. The Court of Master
Sommeliers provides a diploma to those who pass their four-stage
examination process2. There are only 219 Master Sommeliers
worldwide, all of whom have passed this process that takes several
years. By including only individuals with this distinction, we
could be assured that we were assessing true experts. However,
this restriction did limit the number of sommeliers who we could
include, and hence posed a limit to the potential sample size.
We were able to recruit from the Las Vegas resort community
and surrounding regions. Controls were recruited via word of
mouth and advertising from among the local professional and
academic community at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
Controls were matched as closely as possible to sommeliers on
age and gender. To assess the extent of wine knowledge in the
controls especially, a brief, 10-item, multiple-choice wine quiz
was developed to assess wine knowledge. Controls scoring 90%
or higher at the screening phase were excluded from the study
(n = 2) since they were likely to have a higher level of wine-related
expertise than most of the non-sommelier population.
Task Design
Stimuli Selection: Pilot Study
After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the
University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), a preliminary selection
of possible stimuli was conducted with UNLV students. Twelve
male participants between the ages of 21–33 were recruited to
participate. Following informed consent, participants were given
the wine knowledge test. For this pilot study, only participants
scoring below 70% were included. Eight non-wine blends were
made by mixing varying amounts of vodka, cognac, Fusion brand
verjus (a non-alcoholic grape juice made from the same grapes as
many wines), fruit essences and in some cases water-soaked oak
chips. Participants were blindfolded using a cloth sleep mask. The
researcher held a glass jar containing either wine or a non-wine
underneath the participant’s nose and instructed the participant
to inhale through their nostrils. During the first task, participants
were asked to tell the researcher if they smelled a wine or a
non-wine.
During the second task, participants were asked to tell
the researcher if they smelled a white or a red wine. Four
2http://www.mastersommeliers.org
white wines and four red wines were included. All jars during
both tasks were chosen at random. Immediately following the
olfaction tasks, participants were led to a computer and asked to
rapidly categorize variably pixilated pictures of zebra patterns or
fingerprints to allow us to match this visual task with the olfactory
tasks on difficulty of identification.
Scores on the wine knowledge quiz ranged from 20 to 70%
with a mean of 45%. Participants were able to distinguish
between wines and non-wines with accuracy, ranging from 58
to 100%. Accuracy in distinguishing white wines from red wines
varied from 25 to 91%. Accuracy at distinguishing between
zebra patterns and fingerprints varied from 93 to 100%. Stimuli
were selected based on participant accuracy. Specifically, stimuli
from the bottom and top twenty percent of piloted stimuli
were chosen. From this preliminary data, two white wines (2011
Walt Chardonnay and 2010 Trimbach Gewurztraminer), two
red wines (2008 San Leonino Chianti Classico and 2010 Januik
Cabernet Sauvignon), and three non-wine mixtures (a blend of
white verjus with a small amount of vodka (either Tito’s or
Belvedere), and some combination of fresh lemon juice and very
dilute pear or apricot essence) were chosen. Wines were opened,
and non-wines mixed fresh, for each imaging session, with a
maximum of three participants being run in a session.
Imaging Study: Olfactory Apparatus
Prior to entering the scanner subjects were fitted with a custom-
designed mask consisting of a medical-grade oxygen face-mask
modified to accommodate the placement of eight polyurethane
tubes immediately below the nose. Each tube was attached to a
small glass bottle containing a small amount (4 ml) of either wine
(four bottles, two red and two white), or non-wine (three bottles),
or nothing (one bottle). Additional tubing (polyurethane, 3.2 mm
outer diameter and 1.7 mm inner diameter – Frethane 85,
Freelin-wade, McMinnville, OR, USA) connected each vial to
the olfactometer, located outside of the magnet room. The
olfactometer is a computer controlled pneumatic stimulator
(Institute for Biomagnetism and Biosignal analysis, University
of Munster, Germany) that provides air pulses of well-defined
duration. Its adaptation for olfactory research has been previously
described (Frasnelli et al., 2010). The delay in getting the odorant
from the trigger to the participant is 20–50 ms. The apparatus are
depicted in Figure 1.
Tasks/Timing
Programming
Stimuli were presented using a custom interface written in
Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, CA, USA).
Four different tasks, two olfactory and two non-olfactory, were
presented pseudo-randomly in an event-related design. Each trial
began with a 2-s visual cue informing participants which task
to perform during the subsequent stimulus presentation which
lasted 4 s. The inter-trial interval (ITI) varied from 0 to 5500 ms.
For all tasks, participants reported their task-related decision
using a two-button response pad. Button response-categories
were reversed between participants so, for example, half the
participants used the left button for red wine and half used the
right button. The entire study consisted of two runs of 80 trials

instructed by the Presentation program. The air then traveled in a tube to one of eight bottles, seven of which included either wine or non-wine liquid, the other was
empty. The air then went in a different tube to the mask attached to the face of the participant. The birdcage coil used during imaging is not depicted in the picture.
Visual stimuli were presented using a mirror above the participant’s head.

and lasted approximately 20 min. Figure 2 illustrates the timing
and tasks.
There were two different olfactory tasks. For both tasks,
a single odorant was presented concurrently with an equal-
duration visual cue that instructed participants to sniff, but also
reminded them of the task to perform. Odorants were delivered
for 4 s. During the red or white wine task, participants were
pseudo-randomly presented air scented with one of two red wines
or one of two white wines. Participants reported whether the
odorant was from a red or white wine. A total of 40 trials were
conducted, 10 of each odorant. During the wine or non-wine
task, participants were pseudo-randomly presented odorants
from a red wine, a white wine, or one of three non-wines.
Participants reported whether the odorant was from a wine or
a non-wine. A total of 40 trials were conducted, eight of each
odorant.
There were two different non-olfactory tasks. During the
fingerprint or zebra task, participants were randomly presented

pixilated images of either a fingerprint or a zebra pattern (see
Figure 2 for example of stimuli). Participants were instructed
to report whether the image was a fingerprint or a zebra
pattern. A total of 40 trials were conducted, 20 of each image
category. The image presented during each trial was unique
so that no image was presented more than once. During the
motor task, participants were delivered a 4-s stream of air
through an olfactometer channel that contained no odorant and
were instructed to respond by arbitrarily pressing the left or
right button. A total of 40 trials were conducted. Due to a
potential confound associated with the red or white wine task (the
“clean” air pushed through during the motor task was potentially
contaminated residual odor in the mask during the motor task,
thus we had no adequate control) only the wine vs. non-wine
olfactory task in comparison to the fingerprint vs. zebra visual
control was analyzed in this pilot study.
Out-of-Scanner Tasks
General olfactory ability was evaluated using the University of
Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; Doty et al., 1984).
The test consists of a booklet containing a series of standardized
microencapsulated odorants. Scratching the paper releases each
odor, which must then be identified by the participant (i.e.,
“scratch and sniff”). Results of this test indicate the degree to
which individuals can identify smells in a forced-choice scenario.
Wine knowledge was assessed using the wine quiz. The wine
quiz is a 10-item questionnaire developed for this project by MEP.
The quiz contains questions about varietals, terroir, origin and
tasting techniques.
MRI Acquisition
All images were acquired on a Siemens Magentom Verio Syngo
MR B17 3 Tesla MRI scanner with a birdcage head coil.
A high resolution (1 mm × 1 mm × 1.2 mm) structural
image was acquired using a 3-dimensional, T1-weighted gradient
echo MP-RAGE sequence (repetition time = 2300 ms, Echo
time = 2.98 ms, flip angle = 9). A total of 160 1.2 mm
sagittal slices were acquired, each with a 256 × 256 matrix and
256 × 256 mm FOV, with parallel imaging (GRAPPA = 2, 24
reference lines). This was used in the VBM analysis.
Functional scans were acquired using gradient-echo T2-
weighted echoplanar imaging (EPI), optimized for blood-oxygen-
level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. Imaging parameters were
TR/TE = 2500/28 ms; flip angle = 80◦; field of view, 256 mm; slice
thickness 4 mm; in-plane resolution/voxel size, 2 × 2 × 4 mm.
A total of 240 volumes were obtained during each of two trial
sessions.
Data Analysis
Behavioral Data Analysis
Independent samples Student’s t-test were used to compare
demographic details including Age and scores on the wine quiz
and UPSIT tests. Repeated Measures ANOVA were used to
compare accuracy and reaction time data between groups and
between tasks. Post hoc testing was completed using the Least
Square’s Differences approach. All data were analyzed using SPSS
(v. 20, IBM).
Preprocessing of Structural MRI Data
Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) preprocessing was completed
using SPM 8. The DARTEL tool was used to segment the
structural image into gray matter and white matter, generate
templates based on the scans used in this study, smooth to 8 mm
and normalize these to MNI-defined standard space. We used the
“preserve amount” option, thus utilizing modulation to reduce
likelihood of error. VBM shows regions of relative density, and
with the modulation option, volume, which differ between two
groups.
Preprocessing of fMRI Data
fMRI data were analyzed using SPM 12. EPI data were input
into a standard pre-processing pipeline that performed slice time
correction, realignment, co-registration and normalization to the
MNI 2 mm template. Finally, data were smoothed with an 8 mm
Gaussian kernel.
Structural Data Analysis
Structural data were analyzed using a two-step approach. First,
voxel-wise comparisons were completed using VBM in a region
restricted to the frontal and temporal lobes since these covered
the range of brain regions important in olfaction and memory
where we suspected there would be a structural difference.
This mask was made using the MARINA SPM extension. This
allowed for the assessment of differences between sommeliers
and controls in a large brain regions without very specific
a priori hypotheses in an exploration unburdened by the
restrictions imposed from corrections for multiple comparisons.
Following preprocessing, MNI-normalized data were subjected
to a two-sample t-test, comparing sommeliers and controls, with
punc < 0.005 and a threshold voxel count of 50 and regions
significantly different between the two groups were identified.
Secondly, we wanted to complete regional cortical thickness
analyses based on the VBM findings. Freesurfer was used to
calculate cortical thickness of parcellated regions of the entire
brain for all subjects. Details on the usage of this software are
documented elsewhere3. We visually checked for distortions.
Cortical thickness values of individual regions of interest were
extracted for each individual. We concentrated the analyses
on those regions seen as significantly different on the VBM
analyses. Cortical thickness of these regions were correlated with
demographic variables, specifically age and years as a sommelier.
Functional Analysis
The pre-processed fMRI data were analyzed using SPM12. The
first level design matrices of individual general linear models
incorporated 11 regressors. Four regressors for the olfactory task
(correct response to Wine-None-Wine task, correct response
to Red-Or-White-Wine task, false response to Wine-None-
Wine task, and false response to Red-Or-White-Wine task),
three regressors for the non-olfactory tasks (correct response to
Fingerprint-Zebra task, false response to Fingerprint-Zebra task,
and response to Motor task), and four session related regressors
(begin, instruction, fixation, and Mistrial time). Regressors were

defined with onset of the event till the response of the participant.
These 11 task based regressors were convolved with the canonical
hemodynamic response function. At the second level, analysis
was performed using ANOVA, assessing for group (sommelier
vs. control), task [olfactory (wine/non-wine task) vs. visual
(fingerprint/zebra task)], and interaction effects with age as a
covariate. For this purpose, age was mean-centered by subtracting
the overall mean age across all subjects. We used only correct
responses to ensure that participants were attending to the task.
The significance threshold for the group and task interaction
results were determined using AlphaSim program (available in
AFNI)4. The t-maps for the interaction were thresholded with
an initial voxel-wise threshold p < 0.001 (uncorrected), and
a cluster-extent threshold of k > 60 to achieve a cluster-level
FWER corrected p < 0.05. We were particularly interested in
the interaction, since we hypothesized that there would be a
greater difference for sommeliers completing the olfactory task,
compared with other effects. Following the ANOVA which was
completed using SPM we extracted beta values in the regions
involved in the interaction to visualize post hoc differences. The
extracted Beta values from the relevant regions were also entered
these into a correlation analysis with years of experience of the
sommeliers.
RESULTS
Participants and Behavioral Results
Thirteen individuals were recruited into each group, including
two women in each group. Demographic characteristics and
results of the wine quiz and UPSIT are summarized in Table 1.
Sommeliers were, as expected, better on both the Wine Quiz and
the UPSIT compared with controls. A normal score on the UPSIT
is generally considered to be 34, so the sommeliers completed
significantly better than normal, while controls performed as
expected.
During fMRI tasks, overall accuracy and reaction time
were probed. Groups did not differ on accuracy or timing
during any task, although there was a main effect of task on
both these measures (accuracy [F(2,38) = 30.95, p < 0.0005]
and response time [F(3,36) = 31.31, p < 0.0005]). This was
driven by greater accuracy/faster response times during the

visual task, which was completed with highest accuracy and
quickest responses, compared to motor and olfactory tasks. There
was also a significant difference between reaction time during
the motor tasks compared to the visual and both olfactory
tasks.
Only correct trials were used for the analyses. For the visual
task these were on average 35.32/40 for sommeliers and 34.30/40
for the controls. For the wine non-wine task these were 27.69/40
for sommeliers and 26/40 for controls.
Structural Differences
Voxel-based morphometry results revealed three regions that
differed between the two groups: sommeliers had higher volume
in regions in the right and left entorhinal cortex, the right insula
region, and in a small region in the left hippocampus (Table 2,
Figures 3A,B).
Relationships of Regional Cortical Thickness to
Experience
To further explore any association between regional differences
and expertise, right entorhinal and right insular thickness were
obtained using Freesurfer and correlated with age and years
as a master (i.e., years since passing the Master Sommelier
exam). Results are shown in Figures 3C,D. There is a positive
correlation between right entorhinal cortex thickness (r = 0.689,
p = 0.047) and experience. There were no significant correlations
for either the right insula (Figure 3D) or the left entorhinal
cortex.
Functional Differences
Task Based Differences
The ANOVA results revealed main effects for both group and
task, and several regions of significant interaction between group
and task. All results were adjusted for age which was included
as a covariate of no interest, however age itself did not show any
significant effect in the group or task comparisons, or interaction.
For the main effect of group, Sommeliers showed five clusters as
being more active, across tasks, compared with controls, these are
detailed in Table 3. For the main effect of task, there were several
very large clusters that were more active in the olfactory task, and
very specific visual regions were more active during the visual
task. These are also reported in Table 3. The regions involved in
the interaction are detailed in Table 4 and visualized in Figure 4.
Most were in the right hemisphere, and in the regions around the
olfactory cortices, limbic, and temporal memory regions, insula

MRI Characteristics of Sommeliers

and some involvement of the visual cortex and association cortex.
The one cluster in the left hemisphere was centered around
hippocampus and visual cortices and a similar region in the right
was also significant. Since this interaction was the central effect
of interest, we used these regions to create a mask and extract
mean Beta values for each group during task. The mean values
and distribution of each of six significant clusters are graphically
displayed in Figure 5. As expected, the sommeliers had a much
higher level of activation than controls during the olfactory task.
There were no apparent group differences on the visual task.
Most clusters show highest levels of activation for the sommeliers
during the olfactory task, and it is this finding that is likely to be
driving the interaction effect.
Correlation with Experience
There were no significant findings when assessing correlation
between beta values extracted from the regions discussed above
and years of experience as a sommelier.

DISCUSSION
This pilot study revealed differences in both structure and
function of sommeliers’ brains compared with controls. We
found that the entorhinal cortex, a region relevant to olfactory
processing, and more particularly to olfactory memory, was
both relatively greater in volume in sommeliers compared with
controls, and that it’s thickness (in the right hemisphere) was
correlated with experience. Other regions that have been shown
to be important in olfactory discrimination, specifically the
insula (Rolls et al., 2003; Plailly et al., 2007), were also larger
in sommeliers, although a correlation between thickness and
experience was not found. Large regions, including parts of
the brain responsible for olfactory processing, memory, and
crossmodal processing, were more active during olfactory tasks
compared with visual tasks in sommeliers than in controls. The
regions that were more active overlapped with the regions that
were found to be larger in volume, and were also more extensive
in the right hemisphere.
Enhanced Volume of the Entorhinal
Cortex
Given the importance of the region to olfactory memory, this
finding was expected. Sommeliers spend years learning about the
olfactory qualities and other aspects of wine, and no doubt draw
on that memory whenever they make a judgment about wine.
We further found a relationship between years of experience and
cortical thickness of the right entorhinal cortex. In many ways,
this finding echoes that of Maguire et al. (2000) in taxi drivers

who show enlargement of hippocampal regions with driving
experience. It is also similar to the earlier finding of Delon-
Martin et al. (2013) in perfumers, who showed increased size of
the piriform cortex, a region of olfactory cortex directly adjacent
to the entorhinal cortex. Furthermore, although we larger volume
of this region bilaterally, compared with controls, the volume
of the right hemisphere was larger than the left, consistent with
early research on hemispheric lateralization of olfactory memory
(Jones-Gotman and Zatorre, 1993). The entorhinal cortex may
additionally be involved in more primary odor perception or
identification tasks in addition (Wilson et al., 2014), which would
also be highly relevant to a sommelier’s experience and skills.
Given this region’s sensitivity to aging and neurodegenerative
disease, it is especially interesting that we found this result
comparing an older group of sommeliers with younger controls.

Enhanced Volume of the Right Insula
The dorsal subregion of the insula was found to be larger
in volume in sommeliers. This is thought to be due to the
importance of this region in combining multisensory and higher
order cognitive processes, activities that sommeliers practice
throughout their training and work. The cortical thickness
of this region had no relationship with experience, however,
which is interesting in comparison to the finding with the
entorhinal cortex. It may be that this region changes early in
the training process and then plateaus, or that only part of this
heterogeneous region responds to cross-modal sensory expertise.
Longitudinal studies would be needed to further explore the

relative impact of training on different regions. Further study
regarding the particular role of subregions of the insula in cross-
modal expertise would also be of interest.
Enhanced Activation in Sommeliers
Compared with Controls
Multiple regions showed an interaction between group and task,
that appeared to be driven by more activity in sommeliers
than controls, specifically during the olfactory judgment task.
Importantly, task performance was similar between the two
groups, making us more confident in the activation differences.
We made the tasks similar enough to sommeliers’ work to
be meaningful, but also wanted the tasks to require a similar
amount of attention in both groups, thus made the tasks entirely
novel (i.e., not discriminating types of wine, but rather wine
from non-wine). These regions included olfactory, limbic, visual
imagery, and multimodal regions. They are similar to those
reported in an earlier study with fewer subjects comparing the
taste and after-taste of wine and water in sommeliers compared
with controls (Delon-Martin et al., 2013; Pazart et al., 2014).
We assume that the enhanced, more widespread, activation
in sommeliers implies more complex processing of the same
information. Overall, there was somewhat more activation in the
right hemisphere of sommeliers compared with controls. This
is consistent with earlier studies that suggest right hemispheric
dominance for olfaction and olfactory memory (Jones-Gotman
and Zatorre, 1993). There were some left hemisphere differences
in the interaction, always with analogous differences in the right
hemisphere, specifically, in the hippocampus, lingual gyrus and
precuneus. Previous fMRI studies of taste in sommeliers have
also shown mixed lateralization: one study comparing tasting
of wine vs. glucose showed more left insula activity compared
with controls during the after-taste period (Castriota-Scanderbeg
et al., 2005), while the study by Pazart et al. (2014) showed
enhanced right but not left anterior insula activation during
tasting but not during aftertaste.
The visual region enhancements both in the main effect of
group (sommeliers more than controls) and in the interaction are
interesting, this could be due to training of master sommeliers
to use multiple senses while learning about wine, and to use
imagery (e.g., of the fruit and vegetable section of a grocery store)
when blind tasting5. This might explain the apparently enhanced
activation of these regions in sommeliers during the olfactory
task.
We did not demonstrate a difference in activation over the
piriform [which we consider to be part of the olfactory cortex
(Zatorre et al., 1992) although one cluster extended into the
olfactory cortex though only by a few voxels.] in the interaction.
Others have noted the inconsistency of imaging studies in
olfaction to specifically demonstrate piriform involvement (Zald
and Pardo, 2000) although an alternative explanation here might
be that this primary olfactory cortex is equally activated by both
groups.
From its comparison to activation during a complex visual
discrimination task, our results support the specificity of the
5http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323696404578300182010199640
enhanced activation seen during the olfactory discrimination
tasks, and particularly so in sommeliers. While the olfactory
network enhancement makes intuitive sense, the result of the
current study point to the specificity of this finding. Had we
not included this visual control task, one could argue that the
Master Sommeliers attended more to perceptual judgment tasks
in general, and that this was not specific to tasks involving
olfactory stimuli. Our use of a visual judgment task as a
comparison provides evidence for the specificity of enhanced
cortical activation during processes involving chemical senses in
sommeliers.
There was no relationship between enhanced functional
activation and years of experience. Future longitudinal studies
will be important in learning more about the interrelationship
between activation intensity and experience. There may be
a causal relationship with those regions that show enhanced
activity early in the training process showing enhanced volume
or thickness over time. Similarly, we did not find any significant
differences in certain parts of the olfactory network including
the orbitofrontal cortex. The regions that were different were
more specifically related to olfactory memory and cross modal
integration, and it might be that these are the particular strengths
that are enhanced in sommeliers, however, future research
and direct comparison with other olfactory experts such as
perfumers might be important to further disentangle the regions
that could be specifically enhanced in one expert group over
another.
The findings reported here were statistically robust, but it
remains a pilot study, and repetition of the study with more
participants will be important. This may allow the detection
of correlations with experience that were not observed in the
current functional dataset, although they were seen with the
structural data. Matching subjects on age will be an important
feature of these studies. Future research assessing the longitudinal
impact of training on student sommeliers might reveal more
about brain changes. Given the restricted number of Master
Sommeliers, any further studies might be multi-site in nature,
or centered around the timing of a wine event when multiple
sommeliers are located near one center. It would also be of
interest to compare experts with different interests directly,
such as perfumer and wine experts, or with different sensory
expertise, such as comparing sommeliers with visual experts
such as those who detect fraudulent art work, or finger print
recognition experts. This would allow us to learn more about the
specificity of perceptual expertise. We also cannot make claims
about the cellular level mechanisms of changes with experience.
The development of new techniques in PET imaging, including
imaging ligands that detect microglial processes, might be useful
in understanding this process as suggested by the authors of
a recent review (Zatorre et al., 2012). In the future, we would
balance the number of wines and non-wines used, as this may
have enhanced a novelty effect for the non-wines in the current
study as participants become more habituated to the two white
wines more quickly than the three non-wines. Similarly, in future
studies we will test our participants’ memory, to see whether the
enhanced thickness and connectivity of these regions is correlated
with memory performance on neuropsychological tests.

MRI Characteristics of Sommeliers
This study identified enhanced structural and functional
patterns in the olfactory network of sommeliers. These findings
are consistent with the learning they undergo in achieving the
status of Master Sommelier. Furthermore, the volume of a region
of the brain involved in olfactory memory was associated with
experience, suggesting that the continued training results in
morphological changes of the brain. These results speak to the
plasticity of the adult brain in response to sensory expertise.
Future research into therapeutic sensory-cognitive training in
individuals at risk from neurodegenerative diseases, such as
Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, which impact the same regions of the
limbic system and entorhinal cortex, might provide an important
clinical application of these results.
