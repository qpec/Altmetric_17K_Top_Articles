abstract
More than 10% of young children experience clinically signifi
 cant mental 
health problems, with rates of impairment and persistence comparable to 
those seen in older children. For many of these clinical disorders, effective 
treatments supported by rigorous data are available. On the other hand, 
rigorous support for psychopharmacologic interventions is limited to 2 large 
randomized controlled trials. Access to psychotherapeutic interventions is 
limited. The pediatrician has a critical role as the leader of the medical home 
to promote well-being that includes emotional, behavioral, and relationship 
health. To be effective in this role, pediatricians promote the use of safe and 
effective treatments and recognize the limitations of psychopharmacologic 
interventions. This technical report reviews the data supporting treatments 
for young children with emotional, behavioral, and relationship problems 
and supports the policy statement of the same name.
At least 8% to 10% of children younger than 5 years experience clinically 
significant and impairing mental health problems, which include 
emotional, behavioral, and social relationship problems. 
1 An additional 
1.5% of children have an autism spectrum disorder, the management 
of which has been reviewed in a separate report from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). 
2 Children with emotional, behavioral, 
and social relationship problems (“mental health problems”), as well as 
their families, experience distress and can suffer substantially because 
of these problems. These children may demonstrate impairment across 
multiple domains, including social interactions, problematic parent–child 
relationships, physical safety, inability to participate in child care without 
expulsion, delayed school readiness, school problems, and physical 
health problems in adulthood.

Exposure to toxic stressors, such 
as maltreatment or violence, and 
individual, family, or community 
stressors can increase the risk of 
early-onset mental health problems, 
although such stressors are not 
necessary for the development of 
these problems. Early exposure to 
adversity also has notable effects on 
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal 
axis and epigenetic processes, 
with short-term and long-term 
consequences in physical and mental 
health, including adult cardiovascular 
disease and obesity.25 In short, 
young children’s early emotional, 
behavioral, and social relationship 
problems can cause suffering 
for young children and families, 
weaken the developing foundation 
of emotional and behavioral health, 
and have the potential for long-term 
adverse consequences. 
26, 
 
27 This 
technical report reviews the data 
supporting treatment of children 
with identified clinical disorders, 
including the efficacy, safety, and 
accessibility of both pharmacologic 
and psychotherapeutic approaches.
PREVENTION APPROACHES
Although not the focus of this 
report, a full system of care includes 
primary and secondary preventive 
approaches, which are addressed 
in separate AAP reports. 
28, 
 
29 Many 
family, individual, and community 
risk factors for adverse emotional, 
behavioral, and relationship health 
outcomes, including low-income 
status, exposure to toxic stressors, 
and parental mental health 
problems, can be identified early 
using systematic surveillance and 
screening. An extensive review of 
established prevention programs 
for the general population and 
identified children at high risk 
are described in the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMHSA)’s 
National Report of Evidence-
Based Programs and Practices 
(http:// 
www. 
nrepp. 
samhsa. 
gov/ 
AdvancedSearch. 
aspx). Outcomes 
of these programs highlight the 
value of early intervention and the 
potential to improve parenting 
skills using universal or targeted 
approaches for children at risk. 
The programs use a variety of 
approaches, including home visiting, 
parent groups, targeted addressing 
of basic needs, and videos to 
enhance parental self-reflection 
skills and have demonstrated 
a range of outcomes related to 
positive emotional, behavioral, and 
relationship development. One 
model developed specifically for the 
pediatric primary care setting is the 
Video Interaction Project, in which 
parents are paired with a bachelor’s-
level or master’s-level developmental 
specialist who uses video and 
educational techniques to support 
parents’ awareness of their child’s 
developmental needs. 
30
Acknowledging that early preventive 
interventions are an important 
component of a system of care, the 
body of this technical report focuses 
on treatment of identified clinical 
problems rather than children at 
risk because of family or community 
factors.
PSYCHOSOCIAL TREATMENT 
APPROACHES
The evidence supporting family-
focused therapeutic interventions for 
children with clinical-level concerns 
is robust, and these are the first-
line approaches for young children 
with significant emotional and 
behavioral problems in most practice 
guidelines. 
31 
 
 
–35
Generally, these interventions take an 
approach that focuses on enhancing 
emotional and behavioral regulation 
through specialized parenting tools 
and approaches. The interventions 
are implemented by clinicians with 
training in the specific treatment 
modality, following manuals and 
with fidelity to the treatment model. 
Primary care providers can be 
trained in these interventions but 
more often lead a medical home 
management approach that includes 
ongoing primary care management 
and support and concurrent 
comanagement with a clinician 
trained in implementing an evidence-
based treatment (EBT).
Effective treatments exist to 
address early clinical concerns, 
including relationship disturbances, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), disruptive 
behavior disorders, anxiety, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder. 
Measured outcomes include 
improved attachment relationships, 
symptom reduction, diagnostic 
remission, enhanced functioning, and 
in one study, normalization of diurnal 
cortisol release patterns, which 
are known to be related to stress 
regulation and mood disorders. 
31, 
 
33 
– 
35 
Psychotherapies, including 
treatments that involve cognitive, 
psychological, and behavioral 
approaches, have substantially more 
lasting effects than do medications. 
Some preschool treatments have 
been shown to be effective for 
years after the treatment ended, a 
finding not matched in longitudinal 
pharmacologic studies.36 
– 
38 It is for 
this reason that the recent ADHD 
treatment guidelines from the AAP 
emphasize that first-line treatment of 
preschoolers with well-established 
ADHD should be family-focused 
psychotherapy.

includes only those with rigorous 
randomized controlled empirical 
support. Because the parent–child 
relationship is a central force in 
the early emotional and behavioral 
well-being of children, a number of 
empirically supported treatments 
focus on enhancing that relationship 
to promote child well-being. Each 
intervention focuses on enhancing 
parents’ ability to identify and 
respond to the infant’s cues and to 
meet the infant’s emotional needs. 
All interventions use infant–parent 
interactions in vivo or through 
video to demonstrate the infant’s 
cues and opportunities to meet 
them. Some explicitly focus on 
enhancing parents’ self-reflection and 
increasing awareness of how their 
own upbringing may influence their 
parenting approach.
Child Parent Psychotherapy 
and its partner Infant Parent 
Psychotherapy are derived from 
attachment theory and address the 
parent–child relationship through 
emotional support for parents, 
modeling protective behaviors, 
reflective developmental guidance, 
and addressing parental traumatic 
memories as they intrude into 
parent–child interactions. 
40, 
 
41 This 
therapy is flexible in its delivery 
and can be implemented in the 
office, at home, or in other locations 
convenient for the family. On 
average, child–parent psychotherapy 
lasts approximately 32 sessions. In 
infants and toddlers, the empirically 
supported therapy enhances parent–
child relationships, attachment 
security, child cognitive functioning, 
and normalization of cortisol 
regulation. 
42 
–44
For infants and toddlers who have 
been adopted internationally, those 
in foster care, or those thought to 
be at high risk of maltreatment 
because of exposure to domestic 
violence, homelessness, or parental 
substance abuse, the Attachment 
and Biobehavioral Catch-Up 
caregiver training supports 
caregivers in developing sensitive, 
nurturing, nonfrightening parenting 
behaviors. In 10 sessions, caregivers 
receive parenting skills training, 
psychoeducation, and support in 
understanding the needs of infants 
and young children. This intervention 
model is associated with decreased 
rates of disorganized attachment, the 
attachment status most closely linked 
to psychopathology, and is associated 
with increased caregiver sensitivity 
and, notably, normalized diurnal 
cortisol patterns. 
45 
– 
47
In the Video Feedback to Promote 
Positive Parenting program, mothers 
with low levels of sensitivity 
to their child’s needs review 
video feedback about their own 
parent–child interactions, with 
a focus on supporting sensitive 
discipline, reading a child’s cues, and 
developing empathy for a child who 
is frustrated or angry. In the most 
stressed families, this intervention 
is associated with decreased infant 
behavioral difficulties and increased 
parental sensitivity. 
48
Treatments focused on mother–
infant dyads affected by postpartum 
depression show promising effects on 
relationships and infant regulation. 
49 
Data in older children suggest 
effective treatment of maternal 
depression may result in reduction 
of child symptoms or an increase in 
caregiving quality.

Preschoolers (2–6 Years)
ADHD and disruptive behavior 
disorders (eg, oppositional defiant 
disorder and conduct disorder) are 
the most common group of early 
childhood mental health problems, 
and a number of parent management 
training models have been shown 
to be effective. It should be noted 
that the criteria for these disorders 
have been shown to have validity 
in young children, 
 
22, 
 
53 although 
the validity is dependent on a 
systematic assessment process that 
is most easily conducted in specialty 
settings. All of these parent training 
models share similar behavioral 
principles, most consistently teaching 
parents: (1) to implement positive 
reinforcement to promote positive 
behaviors; (2) to ignore low-level 
provocative behaviors; and (3) 
to respond in a clear, consistent, 
and safe manner to unacceptable 
behaviors. The specific approaches to 
sharing these principles with parents 
vary across interventions.  
Table 1 
presents some of the characteristics 
of the best-supported programs, all 
of which are featured on SAMHSA’s 
national registry of evidence-based 
programs and practices. 
34, 
54 The New 
Forrest Therapy, Triple P (Positive 
Parenting Practices), the Incredible 
Years Series (IYS), Helping the 
Noncompliant Child, and Parent Child 
Interaction Therapy (PCIT) all have 
shown efficacy in reducing clinically 
significant disruptive behavior 
symptoms in toddlers, preschoolers, 
and early school-aged children. The 
New Forrest Therapy, Helping the 
Noncompliant Child, and IYS also 
have proven efficacy in treating 
ADHD. 
35, 
 
55 
– 
57
In the New Forrest Therapy, sessions 
include parent–child activities 
that require sustained attention, 
concentration, turn-taking, working 
memory, and delay of gratification, all 
followed by positive reinforcement 
when the child is successful. 
32, 
 
35 This 
model has been shown to decrease 
ADHD symptoms substantially 
and to decrease parents’ negative 
statements about their children. 
35 
Triple P is a multilevel intervention 
that includes targeted treatment of 
children with disruptive behaviors. 
55 
The 3 highest levels of care include 
teaching parents about the causes of 
disruptive behaviors and effective 
strategies as well as specific 
problem solving about the child’s 
individual patterns. The child is 
included in some sessions to create 
opportunities to implement the new 
strategies and for the therapist to 
model the behaviors. IYS includes a 
parent-focused treatment approach,

in which groups of parents learn 
effective strategies, practice with 
each other, and discuss clinical 
vignettes presented on videos.56 
The child group treatment can occur 
concurrently with the parent training 
and focuses on emotional recognition 
and problem solving. This treatment 
initially was developed to treat 
oppositional defiant disorder and 
conduct disorder, for which a large 
body of evidence demonstrates 
its efficacy. Recent studies also 
have demonstrated effectiveness 
in treating inattention and 
hyperactivity. 
66 An unintended yet 
measureable benefit is promoting 
language. 
67 In PCIT, parents are 
coached in positive interactions 
and safe discipline with their child 
by the therapist, who is behind a 
one-way mirror and communicates 
to a parent via a small microphone 
in the parent’s ear (“bug in the 
ear”). This treatment is unique 
because parents’ achievement of 
specific skills determines the pace 
of the therapy, allowing movement 
from the first phase, focused on 
positive reinforcement, to the 
second phase, focused on safe, 
consistent consequences. PCIT has 
been shown to have large effects on 
child behavior problems and parent 
negative behaviors in real time. 
Importantly, it is also effective in 
reducing recidivism of maltreating 
parents. 
68 Helping the Noncompliant 
Child also provides 2 portions of the 
treatment, with the first focused on 
differential attention and the second 
focused on compliance training. 
Parents move through the therapy 
based on observed skill acquisition, 
learning by demonstration, role 
plays, and practice at home and in 
the office with their child. Helping the 
Noncompliant Child has been shown 
to have similar effectiveness as NFP 
in treating ADHD in children 3 to 4 
years old and those wtih comorbid 
ODD.

Anxiety disorders also are common 
in very young children, with nearly

10% of children meeting criteria for 
at least 1 anxiety disorder. Cognitive 
behavioral therapy and child–parent 
psychotherapy, both of which also 
are listed on the SAMHSA registry 
of EBTs, are effective in reducing 
anxiety in very young children. When 
cognitive behavioral therapy is 
modified to match young children’s 
developmental levels, children 
as young as 4 years can learn the 
necessary skills, including relaxation 
strategies, naming their feelings, and 
learning to rate the intensity of the 
feelings. 
31 In cognitive behavioral 
therapy, children are exposed to the 
story of their trauma in a systematic, 
graduated fashion, using the coping 
strategies and measuring feeling 
intensity skills that they practice 
simultaneously throughout the 
intervention. Two randomized 
studies have examined cognitive 
behavioral therapy in trauma-
exposed preschoolers, and both have 
shown that children in the cognitive 
behavioral therapy treatment arm 
showed fewer posttraumatic stress 
symptoms as well as fewer symptoms 
of disruptive behavior disorders 
than did children in supportive 
treatment. 
70, 
 
71 Effects are sustained 
for up to a year after treatment. 
71, 
72 
Child–parent psychotherapy is 
similarly effective in treating children 
exposed to trauma. Child–parent 
psychotherapy is an attachment-
focused treatment that supports the 
parent in creating a safe, consistent 
relationship with the child through 
helping the parent understand the 
child’s emotional experiences and 
needs as well as parental reactions. 
40 
Child–parent psychotherapy is more 
effective in reducing child and parent 
trauma symptoms than supportive 
case management and community 
referral. 
73 Importantly, child–parent 
psychotherapy shows treatment 
durability with sustained results at 
least 6 months after treatment.
Other more common anxiety 
disorders and mood disorders have 
received less research attention. 
CBT has been shown effective in 
addressing mixed anxiety disorders 
including selective mutism, 
generalized anxiety disorders, 
separation anxiety disorder, and 
social phobia. 
62, 
 
63 A randomized 
controlled trial demonstrated that 
modified PCIT was effective in 
helping parents recognize emotions, 
although not better than parent 
education in reducing depressive 
symptoms. 
74 Significant controversy 
and limited data about the validity 
of diagnostic criteria for bipolar 
disorder remain, and no rigorous 
studies of nonpharmacologic 
interventions in this age group 
exist. 
75
Although the studies described 
previously show positive effects 
of parent management training 
approaches, limitations are notable. 
Attrition of up to 30% is not 
uncommon among these approaches, 
suggesting that there is a significant 
proportion of the population for 
whom these treatments do not seem 
to be a good fit, whether because of 
the frequency of appointments, the 
content, the therapeutic relationship, 
stigma about mental health care, or 
other barriers. 
60, 
 
76, 
 
77
PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT 
APPROACHES
As highlighted in both the 
professional and lay press, an 
increasing number of publicly 
and privately insured preschool 
and even younger children 
are receiving prescriptions for 
psychotropic medications. 
78 
 
– 
81 
After increasing drastically in the 
1990s, claims data indicate that 
rates of stimulant prescriptions 
have plateaued in recent years, but 
the rates of prescriptions of atypical 
antipsychotic agents continue to 
increase.78, 
 
81 
– 
83 Although prescribing 
data are limited, it appears that 
pediatric providers are the primary 
prescribers for psychopharmacologic 
treatment in children younger 
than 5 years, as they are for older 
children. 
84, 
85
The evidence base related to 
psychopharmacologic medications 
in young children is limited, and 
clinical practice has far outpaced 
the evidence supporting safety or 
efficacy, especially for children 
in foster care. 
33, 
 
81 Specifically, 2 
rigorous randomized controlled 
trials have examined the safety 
and efficacy of medications in 
young children. Both studies 
found that treatment of ADHD in 
young children with medication, 
specifically methylphenidate and 
atomoxetine, was more effective 
than placebo but less effective than 
documented in older children. 
36, 
 
86, 
87 
Both also reported that young 
children had higher rates of 
adverse effects, especially negative 
emotionality and appetite and sleep 
problems, than did older children. 
86, 
 
87 
Less rigorously studied are the 
atypical antipsychotic agents, such 
as risperidone, olanzapine, and 
aripiprazole, for which prescription 
rates have increased substantially. 
33, 
 
88 
These agents have known 
metabolic risks, including obesity, 
hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, 
and hyperprolactinemia, as well 
the potential for extrapyramidal 
effects.89, 
 
90 Long-term safety data 
regarding use of these medications 
in humans, including the effects 
on the brain during its most rapid 
development, are not available.
ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED 
TREATMENTS
The balance of risks and benefits 
of treatment of early childhood 
emotional, behavioral, or relationship 
problems strongly favors the 
safety and established efficacy of 
the EBTs over the potential for 
medical risks and lower levels of 
evidence supporting the medication. 
Fewer than 50% of young children 
with emotional, behavioral, or 
relationship disturbances, even

Residency training and continuing 
medical education has traditionally 
provided limited opportunities for 
collaboration between pediatric 
and child psychiatry residents and 
with other mental health providers, 
including doctoral level and 
master’s level clinicians, although 
there are calls to increase these 
opportunities. 
93, 
 
94 The limited 
opportunities for collaboration in 
training and limited supervised 
opportunities to assess young 
children with mental health problems 
likely result in graduating residents 
having limited experience in early 
childhood mental health as they enter 
the primary care workforce. The AAP 
has worked to address this gap by 
developing practice transformation 
approaches, including educational 
modules and anticipatory guidance 
approaches that promote emotional, 
behavioral, and relationship 
wellness (see the AAP Early Brain 
and Child Development Web site 
at http:// 
www. 
aap. 
org/ 
en- 
us/ 
advocacy- 
and- 
policy/ 
aap- 
health- 
initiatives/ 
EBCD), and around the 
country, there appears to be an 
increase in collaborative training 
opportunities for pediatric residents 
with developmental–behavioral 
pediatrics faculty and fellows, triple 
board residents, child and adolescent 
psychiatry trainees, and other mental 
health professionals.
Many of these barriers are not 
specific to early childhood emotional, 
behavioral, and relationship 
health but are quite apparent in 
this area. Although representative 
epidemiologic data examining the 
rates of psychotherapeutic treatment 
of preschoolers are not available, 
only 1 in 5 older children with a 
mental health problem receives 
treatment, 
 
95 and it seems likely that 
the rate is lower among preschool-
aged children. A major challenge 
is the workforce shortage among 
child psychiatrists, child mental 
health professionals, and pediatric 
specialists trained to meet the 
specialized emotional, behavioral, 
and relationship needs of very young 
children and their families. 
96 
 
–99 
Anecdotally, it seems that many 
therapists trained in EBTs remain 
close to academic centers, further 
exacerbating the shortage in regions 
without such a center. Promising 
statewide initiatives, such as “PCIT of 
the Carolinas” learning collaborative, 
which promote organizational 
readiness and capacity within 
agencies, clinician competence, and 
treatment fidelity and consultation 
with therapists, may begin to foster 
access to EBTs. Such models are 
promising approaches to improving 
access to clinicians trained to 
evaluate a very young child or to 
implement EBTs.
Even in communities with early 
childhood experts who are trained in 
EBTs, third-party payment systems 
traditionally have rewarded brief 
medication-focused visits. 
28 When 
emotional and behavioral health 
services are “carved out” of health 
insurance, important barriers to 
accessing care include limitations 
on primary care physicians’ 
ability to bill for “mental health” 
diagnoses, limits on numbers of 
visits, payer restriction of mental 
health providers, and low payment 
rates. 
98, 
 
100 
–102 Until 2013, the 
Current Procedural Terminology 
coding system did not recognize 
the extended time needed for early 
childhood emotional and behavioral 
assessment and treatment (and the 
payment for the new code tends to 
be minimal), and many payers will 
not reimburse for services without 
the patient present or for phone 
consultation or case conferences. 
Lastly, the billing and coding system 
does not recognize relationship-
focused therapy, requiring the 
individual participants to have 
an International Classification of 
Diseases–codable diagnosis, and only 
a few states accept developmentally 
specific diagnoses, such as the 
Diagnostic Criteria: 0-5, as 
reimbursable conditions. 
103
Finally, stigma and parental beliefs 
may interfere with referrals to 
EBTs for very young children 
with emotional, behavioral, and 
relationship problems. 
104 
 
 
–108 
Parents’ interest in treatment 
may be influenced by perceived 
stigma related to the mental health 
problem or their own experiences 
with the mental health system. 
109 
Provider stigma about mental health 
and concerns about a child being 
“labeled” may reduce referrals as 
well. Some parents also may be 
concerned that involvement with a 
mental or behavioral health specialist 
may increase their risk of referral to 
child protection services.
INNOVATIVE MODELS OF ACCESS 
THROUGH THE MEDICAL HOME
For children with emotional, 
behavioral, or relationship problems, 
the pediatric medical home remains 
the hub of a child’s care, just as it 
is for other children with special 
health care needs. 
110 Even without 
a comprehensive diagnostic 
assessment or knowledge of the 
details of each EBT, use of specific 
communication strategies, the 
“common factors” approach, has 
been shown to improve outcomes 
in older children. Specifically, 
implementation of the common 
factors approach was associated with 
reduced impairment from symptoms 
and reduced parent symptoms in 
a randomized controlled trial of 
58 providers. 
111 Subsequently, the 
mnemonic “HELP” was introduced by 
the AAP Task Force on Mental Health 
to prompt clinicians in key elements 
of the model, including offering 
hope, demonstrating empathy, 
demonstrating loyalty, using the 
e7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
language the family uses about the 
concerns, and partnering with the 
family to develop a clearly stated 
plan, with the parents’ permission. 
112 
Because of the stigma related to mental 
health issues, “hope” and “loyalty” are 
especially powerful first steps.
Innovative and successful 
adaptations of EBTs have been 
developed for the primary care 
setting. 
55, 
 
64, 
 
65 Triple P has been 
implemented successfully in primary 
care settings using nurse visits to 
provide the psychoeducation for 
parents and also has been studied 
as a self-directed intervention for 
parents of children with clinically 
significant disruptive behavior 
symptoms, with modest but 
sustained effects up to 6 months. 
61 
A pilot PCIT adaptation for 
primary care showed promising 
results, although larger studies 
are needed.113 Most recently, 
a randomized controlled trial 
demonstrated that the Incredible 
Years Series can be implemented 
effectively in the pediatric medical 
home for children with mild to 
moderate behavior problems. In this 
study, parent-reported behavioral 
problems decreased significantly 
compared with the group on the wait 
list, as did observed negative parent–
child interactions. 
114
The strategy for identifying 
providers of EBTs varies state 
to state. However, all but 3 
states have an Early Childhood 
Comprehensive Services grant from 
the Human Resources and Service 
Administration (http:// 
mchb. 
hrsa. 
gov/ 
programs/ 
earlychildhood/ 
comprehensivesyst 
ems/ 
grantees/ 
) 
and are developing systems of care 
for young children. EBTs tend to 
be concentrated around academic 
settings, so contacting local 
developmental–behavioral pediatric 
divisions and child and adolescent 
psychiatry and psychology divisions 
often helps, and the originator of the 
model often knows providers trained 
in the intervention (eg, www. 
pcit. 
org). Innovative practice models, 
such as consultation or colocated 
mental health professionals, can be 
effective approaches to ensuring 
children have access to care. 
115
In areas with more trained EBT 
providers, opportunities for 
colocated care seem promising. 
In such models, a clinician, who is 
often a master’s level clinician or 
psychologist, works in the practice 
as part of the team to provide short-
term mental health interventions, 
such as skills-training in behavioral 
management. In older children, 
such interventions are effective in 
decreasing ADHD and oppositional 
defiant disorder, although not 
conduct disorder or anxiety, and 
in increasing the likelihood of 
treatment completion. 
116 Models of 
consultation that support primary 
care providers in the management 
of children who have been referred 
for EBT or who have no access to an 
EBT are under development, often 
through federally funded projects, 
such as SAMHSA’s Linking Actions 
to Unmet Needs in Child Health 
Project (http:// 
media. 
samhsa. 
gov/ 
samhsaNewsletter/

aspx).
COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT PLAN
Clinical emotional, behavioral, or 
relationship problems commonly 
cooccur with other developmental 
delays, especially speech problems. 
For example, in one mental health 
program for toddlers, 77% of children 
also had a developmental delay. 
117 
A comprehensive treatment plan 
includes attention to any comorbid 
conditions, although such combined 
or serial treatments have not been 
studied explicitly. Similarly, family 
mental health problems, such as 
maternal depression, can reduce the 
efficacy of parent management training 
approaches. In older children, effective 
treatment of maternal depression is 
effective in reducing child symptoms 
and fewer diagnoses. 
51
SUMMARY
Very young children can experience 
significant and impairing 
mental health problems at rates 
comparable to older children. Early 
adversity, including abuse and 
neglect, increases the risk of early 
childhood emotional, behavioral, 
and relationship problems and is 
associated with developmental, 
medical, and mental health 
problems through the lifespan. 
EBTs can address early childhood 
mental health problems effectively, 
reducing symptoms and impairment 
and even normalizing biological 
markers. By contrast, the research 
base examining safety and efficacy 
of pharmacologic interventions is 
sparse and inadequate. Systems 
issues, including graduate medical 
education systems, access to trained 
providers of EBTs for very young 
children, and coding, billing, 
and payment structures all 
interfere with access to effective 
interventions. Not insignificantly, 
social stigma related to mental 
health held by parents, primary care 
providers, and the greater society 
likely work against access to care for 
children.
CONCLUSIONS
The existing data demonstrate 
strong empirical support for 
family-focused interventions for 
young children with emotional, 
behavioral, and relationship 
problems, especially disruptive 
behavior disorders and anxiety 
or trauma exposure. By contrast, 
the empirical literature examining 
psychopharmacologic treatment 
is limited and highlights risks 
of adverse effects. A number of 
workforce and other barriers may 
contribute to the limited access.
