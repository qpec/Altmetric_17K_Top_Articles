Women’s descriptions of childbirth trauma
relating to care provider actions and
interactions

Abstract
Background: Many women experience psychological trauma during birth. A traumatic birth can impact on postnatal
mental health and family relationships. It is important to understand how interpersonal factors influence women’s
experience of trauma in order to inform the development of care that promotes optimal psychosocial outcomes.
Methods: As part of a large mixed methods study, 748 women completed an online survey and answered the
question ‘describe the birth trauma experience, and what you found traumatising’. Data relating to care provider
actions and interactions were analysed using a six-phase inductive thematic analysis process.
Results: Four themes were identified in the data: ‘prioritising the care provider’s agenda’; ‘disregarding embodied
knowledge’; ‘lies and threats’; and ‘violation’. Women felt that care providers prioritised their own agendas over the
needs of the woman. This could result in unnecessary intervention as care providers attempted to alter the birth
process to meet their own preferences. In some cases, women became learning resources for hospital staff to observe
or practice on. Women’s own embodied knowledge about labour progress and fetal wellbeing was disregarded in
favour of care provider’s clinical assessments. Care providers used lies and threats to coerce women into complying
with procedures. In particular, these lies and threats related to the wellbeing of the baby. Women also described
actions that were abusive and violent. For some women these actions triggered memories of sexual assault.
Conclusion: Care provider actions and interactions can influence women’s experience of trauma during birth. It is
necessary to address interpersonal birth trauma on both a macro and micro level. Maternity service development and
provision needs to be underpinned by a paradigm and framework that prioritises both the physical and emotional
needs of women. Care providers require training and support to minimise interpersonal birth trauma.

Background
Around one third of women experience trauma whilst
giving birth [1, 2]. A traumatic birth experience is asso-
ciated with postpartum mental health problems, includ-
ing
depression
and
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
[PTSD] [1, 3–6]. Poor mental health in the postnatal
period can alter a woman’s sense of self, and disrupt
family
relationships
[7–10].
Difficulties
with
early
mother-baby bonding can negatively influence a child’s
social, emotional and mental development [11]. In
addition, the experience of a traumatic birth can influ-
ence a woman’s future decisions regarding where, how,
and with whom she gives birth [12, 13]. For example,
women may choose to birth at home to avoid repeating
a traumatic hospital experience [14]. Jackson et al. [15]
found that the decision to freebirth (give birth without a
professional care provider) can be influenced by previous
birth traumatic. Therefore, the consequences of a trau-
matic birth experience can be substantial and wide-
ranging for women and their families.
Birth trauma has been associated with medical interven-
tion and type of birth [5, 16, 17]. It has been defined as a
perception of ‘actual or threatened injury or death to the
mother or her baby’ [18]. However, Beck [19] argues that

 the perception of trauma is in the ‘eye of the beholder’
, and
should be defined by the woman experiencing it. Qualita-
tive studies exploring women’s experiences of traumatic
birth identify interactions with care providers as a more im-
portant factor than medical intervention or type of birth
[20–23]. For example, a perceived lack of control and in-
volvement in decision-making can contribute to the experi-
ence of trauma [21, 23]. A study by Thomson and Downe
[20] found that trauma was related to ‘fractured interper-
sonal relationships with caregivers’
, and that women felt dis-
connected, helpless and isolated during birth. Whilst not all
traumatic birth experiences result in PTSD, two quantita-
tive meta-analyses identified that negative care provider in-
teractions are a significant risk factor for PTSD [5, 17]. A
study by Harris and Ayers [24] also found that the strongest
predictor of developing birth related PTSD was interper-
sonal difficulties with care providers, in particular experien-
cing a lack of support.
A recent Cochrane Review [25] concluded that women
require improved emotional support during birth from
their care providers to reduce the risk trauma. Health care
professionals have an ethical, legal and professional obliga-
tion to provide safe and respectful care [26–28]. In order to
improve care, it is important to understand what interac-
tions and actions are associated with trauma [20]. This
paper focuses on traumatic care provider actions and inter-
actions from the perspective of the women experiencing
them. The findings contribute to the body of literature
examining women’s experiences of traumatic birth; and to
an understanding of how care providers influence women’s
perceptions of trauma. This paper presents a subset of find-
ings from a large mixed methods study that investigated
parental mental health following traumatic birth. The quan-
titative findings have not yet been published. The qualita-
tive
findings
concerning
paternal
mental
health
are
reported elsewhere [29]. This paper presents the qualitative
findings relating to women’s descriptions of birth trauma
involving care provider actions and interactions.
Methods
The mixed methods study involved parents completing
an online survey, and additional face-to-face interviews
with fathers [29]. The online survey included questions
on demographics, descriptive birth assessments, parent-
infant attachment, partner relationship quality, current
mental health, and coping strategies used after the
trauma. In addition, the survey incorporated a question
about the experience of birth trauma with space for a
written response. A qualitative approach was taken to
explore women’s written descriptions of trauma. The
area of interest in this aspect of the study was women’s
experiences of trauma, rather than outcomes associated
with trauma. The majority of qualitative data related to
care provider actions and interactions, and this paper
presents themes relating to this data.
Participant recruitment
Participants were recruited via online social media forums
such as Facebook, Twitter and a midwife’s blog site. Inclu-
sion criteria was that participants were over 18 and had
experienced a traumatic birth. A definition of a traumatic
birth was not provided in order to capture what partici-
pants themselves considered’trauma’ [19]. There was no
exclusion criterion for time since the birth, as women’s
memories of childbirth remain strong over time [30]. Par-
ticipant information detailing the research question and
aims was provided on the first page of the online survey.
In order to obtain consent, participants were required to
read an online consent form and ‘click’ agree prior to
accessing the survey.
Data collection
After consenting to participate, participants completed an
online survey administered through the program Survey
Monkey. The survey included demographics (eg. age, rela-
tionship status) and information such as type of birth (eg.
caesarean, vaginal); place of birth (eg. public hospital,
home); and admission of baby to special care (Table 1). The
quantitative element of the study comprised of a number of
psychological assessment tools: Maternal Postnatal Attach-
ment [31]; Quality of Marriage Index [32]; Depression Anx-
iety Stress Scale-21 [33]; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Checklist-5 [34]; and The Brief Cope index [35]. The quali-
tative element of the study involved women responding in
their own words to the question ‘describe the birth trauma
experience, and what you found traumatising’. The mean
length of written responses was 69 words.
Data analysis
Women’s descriptions of trauma were analysed using a
six-phase inductive thematic analysis process described
by Braun and Clarke [36]. Phase one involved becoming
familiar with the data by reading and re-reading; and
noting initial ideas. In phase two initial codes were gen-
erated and data relevant to each code was collated.
Phase three of the process involved collating the codes
into potential themes. These themes were reviewed in
phase four to ensure they were consistent in the coded
extracts and across the entire data set. In phase five
themes were defined and named using words and
phrases. Phase six involved selecting extract examples to
illustrate the themes, and relating the analysis to the re-
search question and the literature. Three researchers
participated in the thematic analysis process to ensure
consistency in analysis and findings.

 Findings
A total of 943 women completed the online survey from
around the world. The majority of participants were
from Australia and Oceania (36.8%), North America
(34.2%) and Europe (25.5%). A small number of partici-
pants were from South America (2.1%), Asia (0.9%),
South Africa (0.5%) and the Middle East (0.2%) (Table 1).
The majority of participants gave birth in a public hos-
pital (69%) and either had an unplanned caesarean
(37%), or an unassisted vaginal birth (34.3%) (Table 1).
In addition, 34.4% of participants reported that their
baby was admitted to special care nursery.
Of the 943 participants, 748 (79%) responded to the
qualitative question ‘describe the birth trauma and what
you found traumatising’. A third of respondents de-
scribed events such as premature labour, haemorrhage
or concerns regarding their baby’s wellbeing. However,
the majority (66.7%) described care provider actions and
interactions as the traumatic element in their experience.
From the data relating to interpersonal factors, four
overarching themes were identified from the descrip-
tions. The themes are presented below with illustrative
data using the participants’ own words, therefore spell-
ing and grammar varies. The term ‘care provider’ is used
to refer to the professional responsible for the woman’s
care. In the women’s accounts care providers included
obstetricians, midwives and nurses.
Prioritising the care provider’s agenda
Women described how care providers prioritised their
own agenda over the needs of the woman. In some cases
it was made clear to women that their labour was keep-
ing the care provider from something, or someplace they
would rather be:
I found my OB’s lip service to my wishes and then his
switch against them traumatic. I found the comment
“let’s get this over and done with, I have a golf game
to get to” traumatic… (045)
… after an OB coming in and telling me that she
would like me to deliver by 5 pm because she wanted
to go home, I just burst in to tears… (549)
Women felt that they were subjected to unnecessary
and unwanted medical interventions in order to meet
the needs of their care providers:

 I begged not to have a c section, neither I nor my
baby were in distress or danger, but because the
doctor was ready to go home, he did a terrible section
that resulted in almost a year of recovery. (220)
I was steamrolled with unnecessary intervention
and didn’t get to speak with a doctor about my
options, risks vs benefits… I feel like the nurses,
doctors and hospital only did what was in their
best interest, not mine… It was a nightmare.
(381)
Some women described how they became a learning
resource for the benefit of hospital staff. For example,
care providers offered other staff the opportunity to
practice without seeking women’s permission:
… the doctor asked a student nurse, first day on
the job, if she wanted to suture my episiotomy
incision. (644)
… 20 people in theatre and half were sitting down on
phones and chatting away while I had someone
training with forceps on me… (867)
One woman described feeling like she “… was part of
an experiment” (565) rather than a woman giving birth.
In particular, women experiencing unusual births be-
came a spectacle for others to watch:
… I was a looking point for students and anyone who
hoped to witness a twin vaginal birth and a breech
birth. (523)
One woman wrote about how the room filled with
staff hoping to watch her give birth to her breech baby:
… and the amount of people that filled the room to
watch a vaginal breech delivery, when I failed at this,
everyone left. (662)
When she was unable to provide this learning oppor-
tunity she no longer warranted being an object of obser-
vation. The value of her birth experience for others
appeared to be based on what she could provide in
terms of a learning experience.
Disregarding embodied knowledge
Many of the descriptions involved women’s own em-
bodied knowledge being disregarded in favour of their
care provider’s assessment of events:
… I felt like I was being told I was silly for thinking I
was in labour and that this awful pain was nothing to
be worried about. My opinion was dismissed and
ignored as I was just a first timer… (436)
In particular ‘being in labour’ was a contested area.
Women’s perceptions of being in labour were based on
their embodied experience, whereas care provider’s per-
ceptions were based on clinical findings. For example,
one woman was considered to ‘not be in labour’ because
her cervix was not dilating according to care provider’s
expectations:
Hospital staff did not listen to me, didn’t trust me to
know my body. Dismissed me as a first time mother
who was over reacting. In actual fact I dilated from 0
to 6 in just over an hour. The hospital midwives told
me that I was just feeling the period pain associated
with early labour and induction… (485)
Another woman described how her midwife deter-
mined she was not contracting, therefore not in labour,
based on an abdominal palpation:
Was going into premature labour and midwife
palpated during a contraction and stated I was not
having them. Eventually went into labour as they
ignored me… Although not traumatic in medical
terms, felt completely disgruntled that my journey
was not taken on own merits and was completely
ignored as a woman during labour. (061)
Both of these women considered themselves to be in
labour, and having their embodied knowledge disre-
garded was traumatic.
Embodied knowledge was also dismissed when women
experienced an urge to push before care providers con-
sidered it appropriate. Women were instructed to ignore
what was happening in their body and stop pushing:
Told to stop pushing and… being told what to do
when my body was telling me differently. (248)
Being told to stop pushing when baby was clearly on
its way. Being told I had a long way to go when baby
was on the way out. (436)
Care providers used clinical assessments (vaginal exami-
nations) to determine whether pushing was appropriate.
Based on the findings of these clinical assessments women
were ordered to over-ride their own bodily urges:
… I had the strongest urge to push, the midwife on staff
insisted on an internal examination to check dilation,
she told me if I pushed now I would end up with an
emergency caesarean due to my cervix swelling. She
then spent the next hour yelling at me not to push and
trying to talk me into an epidural (I was trying my
hardest to not push but my body kept taking over). I
was begging to be allowed to push…. (932)
Reed et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:21

 In some cases women described feeling that the wellbeing
of their baby was in danger. When they attempted to alert
care providers their embodied knowledge was disregarded:
… I felt like everything was going wrong and found
that distressing. I felt like people didn’t believe me
when I said something didn’t feel right. (851)
… My baby was in distress and had mec liquor and in
all honesty probably should’ve been sectioned, at this
stage I was begging for one as I knew something was
wrong with my baby but they refused… (732)
In these descriptions women’s own assessment of
labour progress and fetal wellbeing was not valued or
acted on which caused trauma.
Lies and threats
Women perceived that they were being lied to by care
providers to coerce them into agreeing to unnecessary
interventions:
It was not the birth itself that I found traumatic,
rather the way we were treated by the midwife. Being
lied to in order to speed up my labour unnecessarily
and putting me and my baby at risk. (015)
All of this is avoidable and unnecessary, if only we
had known… I was forced into interventions that I
believed were unnecessary. I was also lied to many
times by the doctors. (857)
They also described how care providers threatened them
in order to coerce them into undergoing procedures:
My daughter was breech… I was told that if I didn’t
consent to the cesarean before labor started then they
would perform a cesarean without my consent under
general anesthesia when I arrived (267).
In this case, the woman was threatened with surgery
against her wishes. Other women were threatened with
having their baby taken from them if they did not com-
ply with proposed interventions:
Psychological coercion - ie “if you do not consent to
syntocin OR a c-section then we can get our friend
the psych registrar down here to section you - then
we can do whatever we want to you but you may not
be able to keep your baby” - All I wanted was to let
my body go into labour naturally - my baby was not
in distress… (186)
I was bullied into an induction late on a Sunday night
and then told I would be kept over night. I wasn’t
aware when I finally agreed to be induced after quite
some time of being threatened with DoCS
[Department of Child Safety] etc. (400)
The most common threats described by women re-
lated to the wellbeing of the baby. Some women used
the term ‘dead baby threat’ to describe how they were
coerced, for example: “dead baby threats to gain con-
sent…” (860); and “forced into c section with dead baby
threat…” (223). Some care providers asked women if
they wanted their baby to die when they declined an
intervention:
…Being bullied into interventions with such wording
the following: “Do you want a dead baby?”… (919)
Women felt that care providers were lying about the
risks to the baby in order to pressure them into comply-
ing. They did not believe their babies were in danger,
and in some cases had evidence that their care provider’s
assessment was incorrect:
…I was basically told that if I didn’t have a c-section
on their timetable I would kill my baby, even though
they couldn’t tell me what exactly was “wrong” as to
why I was not delivering vaginally… They broke me
down gradually until they declared my baby was “in
distress” (she wasn’t… I could see the screens). (559)
… Lots of coercion and being told my baby would die
if I didn’t consent to the c-section. She was born with
apgars of 9 and 9. (194)
Being lied to and threatened contributed to the experi-
ence of trauma, particularly when it involved the well-
being of the baby.
Violation
Many women described their birth experience as ‘violat-
ing’. A lack of control appeared to be associated with a
sense of violation. For example, one woman described
that she felt “…out of control and violated” (660). In
these descriptions, care providers carried out actions
against the explicit wishes of the woman:
…All in all, I felt very bullied, and even violated… It
was the feeling of disempowerment and not having
the right to do with my body what I wished - and that
someone else could force me to do something against
my will. (731)
I felt violated, and angry that I should have to defend
myself and my body while I was trying to push my
baby out. (733)
The descriptions of what care providers did to women
were, in many cases, graphic and violent. For example, one
woman wrote “…couldn’t be tubed nurses manually choked
Reed et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:21 
Page 5 of 10
 me out” (490). Another wrote that she was “… assaulted va-
ginally by medical staff during crowning” (295). These de-
scriptions focused on the manner in which the care
provider acted, in addition to their actions:
… She was very rude and condescending, both to
myself and to my midwife. She proceeded to dig out
my uterus without any numbing medication. It was
horrifying… (431)
…The pain was not the traumatic bit, it was the way
that I was treated during my labour. I was 20 years
old. I had more midwives than I can count, attempt
an internal examination and one yelled at me to
‘relax!’ because she couldn’t force her fingers in. She
was a bloody bitch to put it lightly. (256)
One woman described how her obstetrician assaulted
her to gain her compliance to induce labour:
She said she wanted to do one more cervical check. I
consented and when she did it, she grabbed my cervix
and pinched it. She would not let go until I consented
to letting her break my water. I was in tears from the
pain, screaming, begging and sobbing for her to let go
and get her hand out of my vagina. She would not let
go until I consented, which I finally did. (997)
A number of women described how they screamed
‘no’ as care providers carried out procedures. For ex-
ample, one woman told her care provider “expressively”
that she “didn’t want any vaginal examinations” (413).
Her care provider persuaded her to have a vaginal exam-
ination telling her that they “would be very gentle and
would stop if it was too much”. However her wishes
were not respected during the examination:
I was crying and screaming in pain telling her no and
to stop and she carried on, my husband shouted at
her to leave me alone and she carried on. (413)
Another woman described how her doctor failed to
respond to direct requests, and then to screams for
her to stop:
The doctor would not get her fingers out of my
vagina even when directly told. After it was
discovered that I suffered tearing, I wanted the tearing
to be healed on its own - no stitches, but she and
another doctor stitched anyway, despite my screaming
at them to stop. (445)
In addition, some women wrote about being ‘held
down’ while care providers carried out procedures
against their will:
…Being pinned down by 4 midwives (forcing an
unnecessary oxygen mask on me just so my screams
of ‘no’ were muffled) and my husband so the
consultant could examine me against my will. (888)
…At one point, 3 nurses physically held me down
despite my protests that I couldn't breathe and
needed a minute to catch my breath before the
procedure (AROM). They held me down until the
doctor was finished… (491)
Women described how equipment tethered or tied them
to the bed during labour: “was tethered to the bed during
an induction…” (328), and “I was tied to the bed, forced to
lay on my back…” (418). Women experienced being forced
into birth positions: “screaming, lots of people, nurses for-
cing me down and ripping my legs open…” (565). In par-
ticular, care providers made women lie on their backs:
During birth, multiple nurses screamed in my face
“PUSH!!!” and flipped me onto my back and forced
my legs open, holding me down… (414)
In describing their experiences women used words
such as “humiliating” (561); “belittled” (520); “brutal and
barbaric” (132). Some described “being treated like a
piece of meat” (979), or an animal:
…I was treated like a cow having trouble calving, and
felt abused and humiliated. (222)
A number of women used language associated with
sexual assault and rape, writing that they felt: “…raped
and mutilated” (376), “… violated and damaged” (119),
“…violated and scared and disgusting” (423). Women
who had previously experienced sexual abuse or rape de-
scribed how the actions of care providers triggered dis-
tressing memories:
…my cervix was manually dilated forcefully after
pleading for the Dr. to stop. This caused me to re-
experience a previous rape. Later in my birth my Dr.
performed a deep episiotomy after being told repeat-
edly that I did not want one… Images and fears from
my past sexual abuse/assaults became constant in my
mind after birth. (057)
…the whole experience was made worse as it
triggered my post traumatic stress that related to gang
rape in my teens. (444)
One woman felt that her birth experience was more trau-
matising than her experience of sexual abuse as a child:
…The most terrifying part of whole ordeal was being
held down by 4 people and my genitals being touched
Reed et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:21

 and probed repeatedly without permission and no say
in the matter, this is called rape, except when you are
giving birth. My daughter’s birth was more sexually
traumatising than the childhood abuse I’d
experienced… (201)
Discussion
This study described women’s experiences of birth
trauma. The data set was large, and women recounted
similar experiences across different birth settings and
cultural contexts. The findings contribute to an under-
standing of birth trauma from the perspective of women
experiencing it. Whilst non-interpersonal factors con-
tributed to trauma, the majority of descriptions involved
care provider actions and interactions. These findings
are consistent with other studies that identify the rela-
tionship between the care provider and the woman as
critical to the birth experience [20, 21, 37]. Whilst care
providers may consider their actions and interactions to
be routine, some woman experience them as traumatic
[19]. Therefore, it is vital that care providers understand
how their practice influences the psychological and emo-
tional experience of birth, in addition to the physical
outcome of birth.
In this study women described how care providers
priorised their own agendas over the needs of the
woman. This approach to practice is contrary to global
standards regarding woman-centred maternity services
[26, 38]. In addition, women felt that this resulted in un-
necessary interventions, as care providers attempted to
alter the birth process to fit their agenda. There is global
concern regarding the increase in unnecessary medical
intervention during birth [39, 40]. Therefore, this phe-
nomena needs to be further examined as a possible con-
tributing factor. In some cases, women in the study
described how hospital staff observed or practiced on
them to facilitate their learning. Whilst clinical learning
is an important element of professional development,
further research is needed to examine women’s experi-
ence of participation in these activities.
Women reported that their embodied knowledge about
labour onset, progress, and fetal wellbeing was disregarded
in favour of their care provider’s clinical evaluation. The
clinical diagnosis of labour onset usually involves the as-
sessment of contraction pattern and cervical dilatation [41].
However, this evaluation can conflict with women’s own
perceptions regarding the onset of their labour [42, 43],
causing distress [44–48]. Contradictory perceptions of pro-
gress can also occur during the expulsive phase of labour
when women experience an uncontrollable urge to push
[49]. Being instructed to resist the urge to push can be dis-
tressing for women [50, 51]. In this study, instructions to
stop pushing were based on assumptions regarding normal
labour timeframes, and on vaginal examinations. However,
there is increasing debate in the literature regarding the ac-
curacy of prescribed timeframes [52]; the efficacy of vaginal
examinations [53]; and how clinical assessments relate to
women’s experience of birth [49, 54, 55]. Whilst further re-
search is necessary to examine women’s embodied know-
ledge of fetal wellbeing during labour, dismissal of women’s
concerns has been found to contribute to the experience of
trauma [56].
Consent is an important legal and ethical principle in
health care [57]. For consent to be valid it must be vol-
untarily and feely given; the person consenting must not
be under any undue influence or coercion; and there
must be no misrepresentation as to the nature or neces-
sity of the procedure. However, women in the study de-
scribed being lied to, and threatened in order to gain
their agreement for procedures. In particular, lies and
threats centred on the wellbeing of the baby, and some
women referred to this as ‘the dead baby threat’. Bohren
et al. [56] also found that care providers threatened
women regarding the safety of their baby in order to en-
sure they complied during labour. In addition, women in
this study were threatened with being reported to child
safety services if they did not agree to proposed proce-
dures. Other studies have identified that women choos-
ing birth options outside of the norm, such as freebirth,
or homebirth after a caesarean, can experience threats
relating to the safety of their baby, and of being reported
to child safety agencies [13, 58].
Women’s accounts of birth trauma often included vio-
lence and physical abuse. Unfortunately these findings
are not unique, and the World Health Organization [38]
reports that many women worldwide experience disres-
pectful, abusive or neglectful treatment within maternity
services. This phenomena has resulted in the introduc-
tion of the legal term ‘obstetric violence’ in some coun-
tries [59]. Women in the study used language associated
with sexual assault and rape. Beck [19] also found that
women likened the actions of care providers to rape; and
Elmir et al. [21] noted that women used the term ‘birth
rape’ to describe experiences of obstetric
violence.
Kitzinger [60] suggests that women who experience a
traumatic birth display similar symptoms to rape survi-
vors. In addition, women who have a history of sexual
abuse or rape can have memories triggered by their care
provider’s actions and interactions [19]. Montgomery et
al. [61] carried out a study exploring the experience of
birth for women with a history of childhood sexual
abuse. They found it was not the intimate procedures
themselves that triggered abuse memories. Instead, it
was the manner in which the procedures were carried
out. Actions and words that reduced a woman’s sense of
control, and disempowered her could result in a ‘re-en-
actment of abuse’. These findings are consistent with
this study, whereby descriptions of trauma focused on

Page 7 of 10
 the manner in which actions were carried out, rather
than on the physical procedures themselves.
A systematic review concluded that whilst the mis-
treatment of women in labour occurs at the level of
care provider interactions, it is influenced by system-
atic failures at the health facility and health system
level [56]. Current health systems are underpinned by
a technocratic, biomedical paradigm in which the pa-
tient is considered passive, and authority and respon-
sibility are inherent in the practitioner [62]. The
power dynamics operating within this paradigm con-
tribute to legitimising the control that care providers
have over women, and subsequently to mistreatment
[56]. Risk aversion and the avoidance of litigation is
also a key component that influences care provider’s
practice
within
the
current
technocratic
maternity
system [63–65]. However, concerns about litigation
focus on perceived risks to physical outcomes for
mothers and babies, rather than on psychosocial im-
pacts of care [63–65].
Wagner [66] argues that dehumanising practices are
so pervasive within maternity services, that care pro-
viders are unable to perceive them. He uses the ana-
logy of fish being unable to see the water they swim
in, to describe this phenomenon. This notion is sup-
ported by Bohern et al.’s [56] review that found some
care providers consider the mistreatment of women
to be normal. However, some care providers are cog-
nisant of the paradigm in which they operate. In par-
ticular, research has demonstrated that midwives are
often aware of an inherent conflict between woman-
centred care, and the needs of the technocratic ma-
ternity system [67–69]. Midwives consciously adjust
their practice to meet the cultural needs of the facil-
ities in which they work in order to protect them-
selves professionally [67–69]. However, this results in
what Hunter calls ‘emotional work’
, as midwives prac-
tice in ways that are contradictory to their own
woman-centred philosophy [68]. In addition, a recent
study [70] found that midwives who witness interper-
sonal birth trauma can experience trauma themselves.
The researchers suggest that witnessing this type of
trauma may be perceived as a threat to their sense of
personal and professional integrity.
Addressing interpersonal related birth trauma will
require a multifold response on both a macro and
micro level. Davis-Floyd [62] suggests that more ef-
fective woman-centred care can be delivered by com-
bining
humanism
and
holism
with
the
current
technocratic approach. However, this will require a
cultural paradigm shift to support the evolution of
such an approach. The World Health Organization
recommends that five key actions should be taken to
develop and sustain respectful maternity care for all
women [38]. Firstly, greater support from govern-
ments and development partners for research and ac-
tion on disrespect and abuse. Secondly, initiation and
support of programs designed to improve the quality
of maternal health care, with a strong focus on re-
spectful care as an essential component of quality
care. Thirdly, emphasising the rights of women to
dignified, respectful care throughout their childbearing
experience. Fourthly, the generation of data relating
to respectful and disrespectful care practices, systems
of accountability and meaningful professional support.
Finally, the involvement of all stakeholders, including
women, in efforts to improve quality care and elimin-
ate disrespectful and abusive practices. In addition, it
can be argued that the current risk discourse needs
to
be
expanded
to
include
psychosocial
risk
in
addition to physical risk. On a micro level, Fenech
and Thomson [7] suggest that care providers require
training to develop their ability to prevent and iden-
tify trauma, and to respond sensitively to women’s
emotional concerns.
Limitations
The study was a cross-sectional qualitative study, there-
fore cannot establish cause and effect. There was a lack
of representation across many countries with partici-
pants
mainly
from
Australia
and
Oceania,
North
America, and Europe, and findings cannot be generalised
globally. In addition, the data consisted of short written
descriptions within a larger quantitative survey. In-depth
qualitative accounts elicited by participant interviews
may have enriched theme development.
Conclusion
In this study women’s descriptions of childbirth trauma
centred on the actions and interactions of care pro-
viders. Women described how care providers prioritised
their own agendas; disregarded embodied knowledge;
used lies and threats to gain compliance; and violated
them. Findings contribute to the growing body of litera-
ture relating to women’s experiences of traumatic birth.
Interpersonal birth trauma is becoming increasingly
recognised as a global issue, and measures are required
to address it. Recommendations include changing the
current technocratic paradigm by including holistic and
humanistic approaches to care delivery. Maternity ser-
vice provision needs to be underpinned by the World
Health Organization’s ‘five actions’ [38] to develop, pro-
mote and sustain respectful woman-centred care. Care
providers require training and support to understand,
value, and practice in ways that optimise psychological
outcomes for women.
