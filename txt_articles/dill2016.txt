Feminized care work occupations have traditionally paid lower wages compared to non–care 
work occupations when controlling for human capital. However, when men enter feminized 
occupations, they often experience a “glass escalator,” leading to higher wages and career 
mobility as compared to their female counterparts. in this study, we examine whether men 
experience a “wage penalty” for performing care work in today’s economy, or whether the 
glass escalator helps to mitigate the devaluation of care work occupations. Using data from 
the Survey of income and Program Participation for the years 1996-2011, we examine the 
career patterns of low- and middle-skill men in health care occupations. We found that men 
in occupations that provide the most hands-on direct care did experience lower earnings 
compared to men in other occupations after controlling for demographic characteristics. 
However, men in more technical allied health occupations did not have significantly lower 
earnings, suggesting that these occupations may be part of the glass escalator for men in the 
health care sector. minority men were significantly more likely than white men to be in direct 
care occupations, but not in frontline allied health occupations. male direct care workers 
were less likely to transition to unemployment compared to men in other occupations.

T
he devaluation of feminized care work occupations is well estab-
lished. Those who work in occupations where they care for other 
people experience lower earnings as compared with workers of similar 
skill and education in non–care work occupations (Duffy 2011; England 
2005; England, Budig, and Folbre 2002). however, care work jobs are 
largely filled by women (often as high as 90 percent), and less is known 
about how men fare in these kinds of female-dominated occupations, par-
ticularly in an economy that offers fewer job alternatives for many men 
(Gatta and Roos 2005; Price-Glynn and Rakovski 2012). We use the term 
“care work” to refer to occupations in which workers provide face-to-face 
services that contribute to the physical, mental, social, or emotional well-
being of others (Duffy, Albelda, and hammonds 2013; Duffy, Armenia, 
and Stacey 2015). As a case study for examining the careers of low- and 
middle-skill men in care work occupations, we use care work occupations 
in the health care sector that typically do not require a four-year college 
degree, which we refer to as frontline health care occupations.
Our expectations for men’s careers in female-dominated health care 
occupations are guided by two sociological perspectives. On one hand, a 
large body of research has shown that workers in female-dominated occupa-
tions earn less in comparison to occupations that do not have a high percent-
age of female workers, even when controlling for skill level and education 
(Budig 2002; Cohen and huffman 2003a, 2003b; Gauchat, Kelly, and 
Wallace 2012; Reskin 1988). Further, as described above, there is substan-
tial evidence that workers also experience a “wage penalty” for working in 
care work occupations (England, Budig, and Folbre 2002; Findlay, Findlay, 
and Stewart 2009; Palmer and Eveline 2012). On the other hand, another 
body of research has focused on the “glass escalator” effect and has shown 
that men in female-dominated professions, which include most care work 
occupations, tend to have higher wages and wage growth as compared to 
their female counterparts (Baughman and Smith 2011; Price-Glynn and 
Rakovski 2012; Ribas, Dill, and Cohen 2012). Men are said to ride the glass 
escalator in pink-collar occupations because of their higher likelihood of 
being promoted, or because they locate themselves in specialties that have 
higher compensation or prestige (Snyder and Green 2008; C.L. Williams 
1992). Thus, the glass escalator may help to compensate for the devaluation 
of care work in terms of men’s wages in frontline health care occupations. 
In this study, we ask whether men working in low- and middle-skill caring 
occupations experience a penalty in earnings compared to men in other

occupations, or whether the benefits of the glass escalator help to mitigate 
the devaluation of care work in today’s economy. We also explore the char-
acteristics of men who enter frontline health care occupations; we give 
special attention to racial minorities, who face additional disadvantages in 
the labor market and may be more likely to be “pushed” into pink-collar 
occupations because of a lack of alternative job options (Gatta and Roos 
2005; S.L. Williams and Villemez 1993). Finally, we examine the job stabil-
ity of frontline health care workers as compared to men in other occupa-
tions. In today’s economy, where layoffs and periods of unemployment are 
common (Autor 2010), we ask whether frontline health care occupations 
provide a higher degree of job security for low- and middle-skill men.
ThE NEw ECONOmY AND FRONTLINE  
hEALTh CARE OCCupATIONS
Since the 1970s, there has been a decline in many traditionally male-
dominated jobs for low- and middle-skill workers. Low-skill jobs are those 
that require a high school degree or less, while “middle-skill” jobs are those 
that generally require some education and training beyond high school but 
less than a four-year college degree (holzer and Lerman 2009). Middle-skill 
job training requirements can include associate’s degrees, vocational cer-
tificates, significant on-the-job training, previous work experience, or gen-
erally “some college” less than a bachelor’s degree (holzer and Lerman 
2009). Manufacturing and production jobs—traditionally the highest paid 
jobs for low- and middle-skill men—have been lost over the last several 
decades (Kalleberg 2011; Morris and Western 1999; Osterman 2000); 
indeed, the percentage of Americans employed in manufacturing jobs has 
dropped by half since the 1970s (holzer and Lerman 2009). The shift in the 
economy away from manufacturing and toward the service sector, which is 
sometimes referred to as the “New Economy,” has been especially difficult 
for men with lower levels of education, who have seen their real wages drop 
by as much as 15-20 percent over the last 30 years (Mishel et al. 2012). 
Low- and middle-skill men who are racial/ethnic minorities are particularly 
vulnerable in today’s labor market. As compared to non-hispanic white 
low- and middle-skill workers, they are disproportionately likely to be low-
wage workers, to experience low wage growth during their careers, or to 
become unemployed (Acs, Loprest, and Ratcliffe 2010).
As low- and middle-skill workers have lost jobs in traditionally male-
dominated occupations, female-dominated, frontline health care jobs have 
increased (Dwyer 2013; u.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor 
 at UNIV MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST on March 18, 2016

Statistics 2012). In this study, frontline health care occupations are 
defined as low- or middle-skill occupations in health care settings that 
require a high degree of face-to-face interaction with patients (Schindel 
et al. 2006). These occupations include nursing assistants, home health 
aides, respiratory therapists, and surgical technicians, and they are among 
the fastest growing jobs in the united States (u.S. Department of Labor, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012). This has been shown to be due to the 
demands of chronic illness in an expanding, aging population 
(Bodenheimer, Chen, and Bennett 2009), the benefits to families and the 
elderly gained through the New Deal (Jacoby 2001), and women’s par-
ticipation in the paid workforce (Thistle 2006). Women typically fill 
between 70 and 90 percent of frontline health care jobs (Schindel et al. 
2006), but as men face fewer job alternatives, there is some evidence that 
more men are pursuing jobs in the health care sector that have tradition-
ally been filled by women (henderson 2012).
The Devaluation of Feminized Occupations and Care work
Occupations with a higher percentage of women, which include frontline 
health care occupations, pay less than occupations with a lower percentage 
of women, even after adjusting for measurable differences in education 
requirements, skill levels, and working conditions (Cohen and huffman 
2003a, 2003b; England, Budig, and Folbre 2002). Research on the relation-
ship between an occupation’s female share and worker compensation gener-
ally supports a devaluation view of the work performed by women 
(England, Allison, and Wu 2007; Karlin, England, and Ross 2002; Levanon, 
England, and Allison 2009). A devaluation view assumes that gendered 
cultural beliefs portray women’s work as being less competent and status-
worthy (Ridgeway and England 2007). Consequently, this view assumes 
that female-dominated occupations will be devalued by both employers and 
prospective employees because of the lower status of female employees, 
and that pay will be lower predominately because women fill jobs in these 
occupations. Care work occupations are typically female-dominated occu-
pations, so it is not surprising that care work occupations are devalued when 
controlling for skill level and education. however, research has shown that 
workers in care work occupations experience an even greater “wage pen-
alty,” since jobs involving care work pay less than other feminized jobs of 
similar skill levels that do not involve care (England, Budig, and Folbre 
2002). Some researchers argue that because caring labor jobs are assumed 
to require altruism, compassion, and kindness—qualities that are thought to

be embodied by women—the skills needed to perform these jobs are often 
overlooked (Duffy 2005). In other words, we tend to equate care with “kind-
ness” and fail to recognize the skill dimensions required of care work occu-
pations (England, Budig, and Folbre 2002; Cotter, hermsen, and Vanneman 
2004). Scholars have also argued that care work is devalued because of 
cultural assumptions that workers should provide these services because of 
“love,” not “money.” Thus, paid care workers are implicitly expected to 
show their proper motivation by accepting lower wages (England and Fobre 
1999; Folbre and Nelson 2000).
Past research has shown that men typically enter female-dominated 
occupations only when jobs in traditionally male or integrated occupa-
tions or industries are unavailable (Simpson 2005; C.L. Williams 1993), 
and this is particularly the case when those occupations are most associ-
ated with quintessential “women’s work” (Gauchat, Kelly, and Wallace 
2012; Jacobs 1993). The low wages in female-dominated care work occu-
pations and the stigma attached to doing “women’s work” may make these 
jobs unattractive to men, and the majority of men in female-dominated 
occupations are not there by choice (Lupton 2000). Indeed, past research 
has found that male workers with labor market disadvantages—namely 
racial and ethnic minorities, those who are nonnative born and nonnative 
English speakers, and those with lower socio-economic status—are more 
likely to be in female-dominated occupations (Gatta and Roos 2005; S.L. 
Williams and Villemez 1993).
The Glass Escalator
Men may be reluctant to go into feminized occupations because of 
lower pay and prestige, but research has shown that men in female-dom-
inated occupations have higher wages and are more likely to be promoted 
compared to their female peers (Budig 2002; Snyder and Green 2008). 
Normative understandings and practices associated with masculinity often 
underscore men’s cultural, discursive, and material advantages (Connell 
and Messerschmidt 2005). Consequently, men who cross the gender line 
into pink-collar jobs face less opposition than women crossing into male-
dominated occupations (Pierce 1995; Taylor 2010). Once inside, men 
profit from the expectations of masculinity by riding the glass escalator to 
better pay, promotion, and enhanced social support (Budig 2002; Snyder 
and Green 2008; Taylor 2010; C.L. Williams 1992). Christine Williams’s 
(1992, 1995) research on the career paths of men in feminized occupa-
tions suggests that men benefit from being in a work world that rewards

stereotypically masculine attributes, regardless of the gender composition 
of the occupation. Williams and others argue that cultural beliefs about 
masculinity and femininity are built into the structure of the work world 
across all settings, and these beliefs serve to disadvantage women and 
enhance men’s opportunities (Budig 2002; C.L. Williams 1992). 
Consequently, men are “pushed” in ways often subtle and invisible toward 
positions that carry greater wages, prestige, and authority (henson and 
Rogers 2001; Snyder and Green 2008; C.L. Williams 1992).
There is some evidence of a glass escalator for men in lower level 
health care occupations. Price-Glynn and Rakovski (2012) found that 
white male nursing assistants experienced some advantages compared to 
women, such as working in nonprofit and smaller facilities that typically 
have higher pay and better working conditions. Men also had higher 
household incomes and were less likely to rely on government assistance 
(Price-Glynn and Rakovski 2012). These studies suggest that gender 
norms have changed enough to accommodate men doing women’s work, 
but men still experience privilege and may be cushioned from the wage 
penalty experienced by women performing the same work. however, not 
all men may be experiencing the same advantages. Studies of wages 
among frontline health care workers suggest that citizenship and race may 
be more important factors than gender in determining advantages for 
workers (Rakovski and Price-Glynn 2010; Ribas, Dill, and Cohen 2013). 
Wingfield (2009) found that Black male nurses experienced stereotypes 
from both clients and supervisors that limited their opportunities for pro-
motion. Indeed, in a commentary on the theoretical development of the 
glass escalator, Williams (2013) concurs that the glass escalator does not 
operate uniformly across all occupations, or for all racial, ethnic, or immi-
grant groups.
Beyond Compensation: Job Stability in Today’s Economy
In addition to the earnings of care workers, we are interested in job 
stability as a measure of job quality. Male frontline health care workers 
may feel stigmatized in these low-status, female-dominated occupations 
and exit quickly for other occupations or unemployment (Simpson 2004, 
2005). Further, low wages and heavy workloads have been shown to con-
tribute to high turnover in this population of workers (Dill, Morgan, and 
Marshall 2013). however, frontline health care jobs may provide greater 
job stability for men in today’s economy because of instability in many 
male-dominated occupations. In previous generations, many blue-collar 
occupations were characterized by rewards for tenure and seniority, which

created incentives for workers to remain in their jobs and with their 
employers (e.g., working in a unionized automotive factory) (Doeringer 
and Piore 1971). In today’s economy, manufacturing and production jobs 
have declined, and many low- and middle-skill men have been at increased 
risk of being laid off (holzer and Lerman 2009).
In this study, we explore the characteristics and careers of men in front-
line health care occupations, or low- and middle-skill jobs in the health 
care sector that require a high degree of patient interaction. We examine 
who enters frontline health care occupations and whether the advantages 
that men have traditionally experienced in female-dominated occupations 
(e.g., the glass escalator) compensate for the general devaluation of care 
work. using longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program 
Participation, there are three main questions we seek to answer in this 
analysis.
First, what are the odds of being a male frontline health care work, net 
of (i.e., after regression-based statistical adjustments for) personal charac-
teristics? We give special attention to racial and ethnic minorities, who 
may be more disadvantaged in the labor market and consequently may be 
more likely to be “pushed” into care work occupations. We expect to find 
that men who are racial minorities will be more likely to be frontline 
health care workers than white men. Second, what is the earnings effect 
of working in a frontline healthcare job? if the glass escalator mitigates 
the devaluation of care work occupations, we expect to find that men in 
frontline health care occupations have earnings that are not significantly 
lower than men in other occupations, net of personal characteristics. In 
our analyses of earnings, we look closely at racial/ethnic groups to see if 
the glass escalator has different effects for these groups. And third, what 
are the odds of transitions to unemployment for frontline health care 
workers as compared to the general male workforce? if frontline health 
care occupations provide greater stability in the labor market for low- and 
middle-skill men, we expect to find that frontline health care workers are 
less likely to transition to unemployment as compared to men in other 
occupations.
mEThODS
The data used in this analysis come from the 1996, 2001, 2004, and 
2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), 
administered by the u.S. Census Bureau. The SIPP universe includes the 
noninstitutionalized resident population living in the united States.

Individuals were interviewed either by phone or in person every four 
months over the survey period; each interview is called a wave. The pan-
els cover three to four years and include between eight and 12 waves of 
data. All data used in this study were made available by the Center for 
Economic and Policy Research (CEPR 2012). The strengths of SIPP 
include its longitudinal design, detailed three- to four-year information on 
individuals, its greater attention to hispanic and immigrant populations 
relative to other surveys (McKernan and Ratcliffe 2002), and its unique 
identification of respondents’ employers. Our sample includes all male 
respondents between the ages of 18 and 65 in all four (1996, 2001, 2004, 
and 2008) SIPP Panels. The pooled sample includes 148,272 individuals 
and 1,040,990 observations. The respondents completed 5.04 survey 
waves on average. We use criteria identified by Schindel et al. (2006) to 
create a subsample of frontline health care workers in the SIPP. The sub-
sample includes respondents who were (1) employed in a health care set-
ting, (2) in an occupation that requires hands-on patient care, and (3) in an 
occupation that typically requires an associate’s degree or less. A list of 
the occupations categorized as frontline health care occupations is included 
in the appendix. The frontline worker sample includes 883 individuals and 
6,433 observations. Frontline health care respondents completed 5.03 
survey waves on average.
Dependent Variables
In this study, we include analyses of three dependent variables. First, we 
examine the likelihood of a male respondent being a frontline health care 
worker. We distinguish between two groups of frontline health care workers 
based on the level of training required to work in an occupation. Direct care 
occupations typically require a limited amount of post–high school training 
or a vocational certificate and include workers such as nursing assistants, 
patient care technicians, and home health workers. Frontline allied health 
occupations usually require an associate’s degree or equivalent training and 
include workers such as respiratory therapists, ultrasound technicians, and 
surgical technicians. Second, we use the natural log of monthly earnings to 
analyze the earning effects of being a frontline health care worker. With this 
measure, regression coefficients can be interpreted approximately as per-
centage differences in earnings. All earnings are inflation-adjusted to 2011 
dollars (the last year of data collection). Third, to analyze job stability, we 
constructed a categorical variable that indicates the survey wave in which 
an individual transitioned to unemployment. Individuals who were unem-
ployed may be so voluntarily or involuntarily.

Independent Variables
In our analyses, we included a variety of work-specific variables. In 
some models, whether a worker is a direct care worker or frontline allied 
worker (see above) is an independent variable. For workers that were not 
in frontline health care occupations, we also included occupational cate-
gories based on the u.S. Census 2000 Major Occupational Groups.1 
Occupational dummy variables include (1) Management, business and 
financial; (2) Professional; (3) Service; (4) Sales, Office and administra-
tive support; (5) Farming, fishing and forestry; (6) Construction and 
extraction; (7) Installation, maintenance, and repair; (8) Production; (9) 
Transportation and material moving; and (10) Armed Forces. Production 
is the reference category.2 We controlled for union membership and full-
time status (more than 35 hours per week for all weeks during the month) 
with dummy indicator variables. We constructed a variable of job tenure, 
which indicates the number of months an individual has worked for their 
current employer. In the analyses, we divide tenure by 100 to keep the 
range consistent with other variables.
Demographic variables in the analysis include educational attainment 
level, which was coded into four categories: less than high school, high 
school graduate, some college, or a college degree or higher. These were 
included as dummy variables in the models with high school degree as the 
reference category. Race/ethnicity is divided into four categories: white, 
Black, hispanic, or other, with white as the reference category. We also 
included interaction terms between race/ethnicity and frontline health care 
occupational categories. Additional demographic variables included in the 
analyses were marital status (married = 1, else = 0), caring for children 
under the age of 18 (1 = yes, 0 = no), and age (ranged 15-65). Four catego-
ries indicated region: Northeast (the reference category), Midwest, South, 
and West. Finally, we included dummy variables that indicate the year of 
data collection. The work-related and demographic variables included in 
our analyses have been linked to earnings and career transitions in past 
studies of low-level health care workers (Dill, Morgan, and Marshall 
2013; Price-Glynn and Rakovski 2012; Ribas, Dill, and Cohen 2013). A 
summary of the sample characteristics is shown in Table 1.

Logistic regression models were used to analyze the odds of a male 
being in a frontline direct care or frontline allied health occupation, which 
are binary variables. The data used for this analysis are pooled cross-

Earnings
Linear regression models were used to analyze the natural log of infla-
tion-adjusted monthly earnings. The data used for this analysis are pooled 
cross-sectional observations; we use the first survey observation for respond-
ents in all four SIPP panels. We limit this analysis to full-time workers only, 
or workers who worked at least 35 hours per week during all weeks of the 
month. As described above, with this measure, regression coefficients can 
be interpreted approximately as percentage differences in earnings.
Transitions to unemployment
As a proxy of job stability, we examined transitions to unemployment 
during the survey period as the dependent variable. The analysis uses 
longitudinal data and includes all of the observations where an individual 
is working during the survey period and the first quarter of their transition 
away from their job (if a transition did occur). We used fixed effects logit 
models to examine patterns of employment transitions among frontline 
health care workers (Singer and Willett 2003). In this analysis, the data 
were restricted to observations when an individual was observed working 
during the survey period, and their immediate occupational transition 
observations. Specification tests confirmed that multicollinearity was not 
a concern for any of the models; VIF scores were below 2 for all models. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 13.
SAmpLE ChARACTERISTICS
Table 1 shows summary statistics for male frontline workers and the 
general male workforce. The summary statistics are drawn from the first 
observation of respondents in the 1996 and 2008 cohorts. Men in frontline 
health care occupations and the general male workforce in the sample were 
about 37 years old; about 50 percent were married, and around 35 percent 
had children under the age of 18. In the 1996 cohort, there was a higher 
percentage of minority men employed as frontline health care workers as 
compared to the general male workforce; for example, 24 percent of front-
line health care workers were Black, as compared to 11 percent of workers 
in the general male workforce. however, in the 2008 cohort, a higher per-
centage of frontline health care workers were white, and the percentage of

minorities in frontline health care occupations more closely resembled the 
general male workforce. Rates of unionization were similar across all 
workers (around 15 percent), but men who were not in frontline health care 
occupations had longer job tenure in their current job (77 months on aver-
age) as compared to frontline health care workers (87 months as compared 
to 59 months in 2008, respectively). Finally, frontline health care workers 
had on average higher education compared to the general male workforce. 
In 2008, 54 percent of frontline health care workers had some college, 
compared to just 32 percent of the general male workforce. however, the 
percentage of college graduates was the same (28 percent). The distribu-
tion of workers across the u.S. Census Major Occupational Groups and 
other sample characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Figure 1 shows mean inflation-adjusted monthly earnings for full-time 
workers in a few highlighted occupational groups. We chose to highlight 
earnings for workers in occupational groups that contain many jobs com-
parable to frontline health care work in terms of skill and education. 
Figure 1 shows that mean earnings for frontline allied health workers, or 
workers in health care that provide patient care and typically have an 
associate’s degree or equivalent, had higher average earnings as compared 
to workers in service, office and administration, construction, and produc-
tion occupations. Further, workers in frontline allied health and direct care 
occupations had monthly earnings that consistently rose between 1996 
and 2008, while the other highlighted occupations had monthly earnings 
that stagnated or declined over the same period.

men in Frontline health Care Occupations
The results of logistic regression models predict being a male frontline 
health care worker (shown in Table 2). The pooled cross-sectional sample 
includes the first observation for each respondent in the 1996, 2001, 2004, 
and 2008 cohorts of the SIPP. Black men were 3.3 times more likely than 
white men to be direct care workers (p < 0.001), and other minority men 
were 1.8 times more likely to be direct care workers (p < 0.001). Men who 
have more education—those with some college or a college degree—were 
significantly more likely to be both direct care workers and frontline allied 
health workers as compared to those with a high school degree (p < 
0.001), while those with less than a high school degree were significantly 
less likely to work in these occupations (p < 0.05). Last, men in the 2004 
and 2008 cohorts were significantly more likely to be direct care workers 
as compared to the 1996 cohorts (p<.001).
Earnings Effect of Frontline health Care work
The results of the linear regression models predict inflation-adjusted 
earnings among full-time employees (shown in Table 3). Model 1 
includes interaction terms between race and frontline health care occu-
pations. The model indicates that white men in direct care occupations 
earned 21 percent less per month, net of personal characteristics. Black 
men in direct care occupations experienced a similar penalty (22 per-
cent), hispanics had a penalty of 4 percent, and other minorities earned 
61 percent less, net of personal characteristics. however, the interac-
tion terms were not statistically significant, suggesting that racial 
minorities in frontline health care occupations did not experience sig-
nificantly more or less disadvantage in earnings compared to minority 
men in other occupations. Model 2 includes occupational categories. 
The reference group for all occupational categories was production. 
Model 2 indicates that direct care workers had monthly earnings that 
were 10 percent lower than workers in production occupations (p < 
.05), but frontline allied health workers had earnings that were 22 per-
cent higher than production workers (p < .001).
Job Stability among Frontline health Care workers
The fixed effects logit model predicts worker transitions to unemploy-
ment (Table 4). All control variables described in the measurement section 
were included in the model, but some are not shown in Table 4. Recall that

DISCuSSION
A goal of this study was to explore whether the glass escalator that men 
experience in female-dominated occupations would compensate for the 
“wage penalty” that workers experience in care work occupations. Past 
research has shown that jobs involving care work are devalued compared 
to other jobs of similar skill levels that do not involve care (England, 
Budig, and Folbre 2002), but the advantages that men experience in 
female-dominated occupations may boost their earnings and job stability

(Snyder and Green 2008; C.L. Williams 2013). On one hand, our study 
tells a story about men in frontline health care occupations that is consist-
ent with past research on the devaluation of care work (Duffy 2011; 
England 2005; England, Budig, and Folbre 2002). When we look at men 
who are direct care workers, or those care workers who provide a high 
level of nurturant care for patients (Duffy 2011), we find that men across 
all racial/ethnic groups experience a “wage penalty” as compared to the 
general male workforce, net of personal characteristics including educa-
tion and job tenure. When we included occupational control variables for 
all workers with production occupations as the reference group, we found 
that direct care workers earned 10 percent less than their blue-collar coun-
terparts. This suggests that even in today’s economy, where manufactur-
ing jobs have declined in availability and job quality, men in direct care

occupations still experience a substantial “wage penalty” for working in a 
feminized care work occupation, when controlling for personal demo-
graphics. These findings indicate that the glass escalator does not mitigate 
the lower wages in direct care occupations that are strongly associated 
with “women’s work.”
Our findings are also consistent with past research that has shown that 
men are reluctant to enter care work occupations, particularly those that 
are strongly stigmatized as “women’s work,” and that men in these occu-
pations are not there by choice (Gauchat, Kelly, and Wallace 2012; Jacobs 
1993; Lupton 2000). We find evidence that higher rates of racial/ethnic 
minorities work in female-dominated occupations, presumably because 
they face greater disadvantages in the labor market and lack access to bet-
ter paying, male-dominated occupations, which is consistent with past 
research (Gatta and Roos 2005; S.L. Williams and Villemez 1993). We 
found that African American men were three times more likely to be direct 
care workers as compared to white men, while hispanic and other minor-
ity men were about one and half times more likely to be direct care work-
ers. That white men are significantly less likely to be direct care workers 
reflects the lower status and corresponding devaluation of direct care 
work for men. Male frontline health care workers who are minorities also 
experience wage penalties in frontline health care occupations, although 
the wage penalties for minority frontline health care workers are not sig-
nificantly different from the wage penalties that minority men experience 
in other occupations.
On the other hand, there were suggestions throughout our findings that 
men did experience some advantages in frontline health care occupations. 
First, when we look descriptively at the data, inflation-adjusted monthly 
earnings went up consistently over time for both direct care and frontline 
allied health workers, while men in service, administrative and office, con-
struction, and production occupations experienced stagnant or declining 
wages in later cohorts (see Figure 1). These descriptive data suggest that 
earnings among male frontline health care workers have been increasing 
since the mid-1990s, while earnings in other occupations—particularly in 
male-dominated blue-collar occupations—have stagnated or decreased. 
Rising earnings over time for men in frontline health care occupations may 
help to compensate for the devaluation of care work occupations.
Second, we found that frontline allied health workers did not have earn-
ings that were significantly lower than the general male workforce, net of 
characteristics such as education and job tenure. In fact, when we con-
trolled for occupation, we found that frontline allied health workers had

 Dill et al. / GLASS ESCALATOR 353
earnings that were significantly higher (22 percent) than workers in pro-
duction occupations when controlling for demographic characteristics. 
These findings lend support to the idea that, at least within frontline allied 
health occupations, the glass escalator may help to mitigate the devalua-
tion of care work, resulting in earnings that are not lower than other occu-
pations when controlling for personal characteristics. The high demand 
for health care workers and the decline of many alternative job options 
traditionally held by men (e.g., manufacturing and production) may also 
be contributing to a narrowing of the wage gap between these industries 
(Bodenheimer, Chen, and Bennett 2009; Schindel et al. 2006).
Further, we found that white men were more likely to occupy the more 
lucrative, more skilled, frontline allied occupations compared to minority 
men, who were overrepresented in the direct care occupations. White men 
may be more attracted to frontline allied occupations because these occu-
pations have higher educational requirements compared to other frontline 
occupations and, like nursing, have experienced an increase in technical 
skill requirements as these occupations have become more professional-
ized (Judd and Sitzman, 2014). The technical skills required for many of 
the jobs—such as using computers and diagnostic technology—means 
that these jobs do not require as much of the intimate patient care associ-
ated with “women’s work” and may be less stigmatized and more appeal-
ing to men (Cottingham 2013). Indeed, frontline allied health occupations 
may be part of the glass escalator for the careers of low- and middle-skill 
men in the health care sector. Third, we found that direct care workers had 
greater overall job stability as compared to the general male workforce in 
that they were less likely to transition to unemployment during the survey 
period. The greater job stability that we see among frontline health care 
workers likely reflects the greater demand for workers in the health care 
sector, particularly in comparison to industries that have been dominated 
by men, such as manufacturing. This greater job stability may contribute 
to the benefits that men experience in frontline health care occupations 
and help to compensate for the devaluation of care work occupations. 
Finally, we want to note that we found some evidence that more men are 
going into frontline health care occupations. This is a common narrative 
in the press about today’s labor market, arguing that men in search of 
work are moving into service sector jobs that have been traditionally 
dominated by women (Dewan and Gebeloff 2012; Rosin 2012; Vigeland 
2012). In our study, we found that men were significantly more likely to 
be in direct care occupations in the 2004 and 2008 cohorts as compared to 
the 1996 cohort.

In conclusion, we find that men who are in occupations that are most 
strongly associated with “women’s work”—direct care work occupa-
tions—experience a “penalty for caring.” Earnings among direct care 
workers are lower as compared to the general male workforce after con-
trolling for demographic characteristics. however, frontline allied health 
workers do not suffer from the same wage disadvantages and are, in fact, 
better off than many blue-collar workers. Frontline direct care workers 
also have greater overall job stability in that they are less likely to transi-
tion to unemployment. Consequently, while we find some evidence that 
the devaluation of care work is reflected in the careers of men in frontline 
health care occupations, there is also evidence that the advantages that 
men assume in the world of work (C.L. Williams 1992) and the conditions 
of today’s economy help to overcome the devaluation of care work occu-
pations.
This study has a number of limitations. First, we only capture men that 
were currently working in frontline health care occupations; we do not 
account for men who had moved into management or other more lucrative 
occupations in the health care sector. Another concern is the potential 
uncontrolled endogeneity between tenure/work experience and wages. 
Studies on the effect of tenure on wage rates have pointed out that wage 
rate and tenure may be simultaneously determined by unmeasured factors, 
which can result in biased or inconsistent estimation (Burdett and Coles 
2010). Finally, all studies of turnover and job mobility must be qualified 
by the unmeasured “real” reasons why some people move in and out of 
jobs, such as working two jobs, relocating, taking temporary leaves of 
absences from work, and other conditions we do not measure. Strengths 
of the study include the large sample size, the use of nationally repre-
sentative data, and the inclusion of multiple time periods.
Future research should continue to examine shifting gender roles in 
the New Economy. For example, the advantages that men in frontline 
allied health occupations experience lead us to ask whether the health 
care industry is the new pathway to the middle class for low- and 
middle-skill men (Andersson, holzer, and Lane 2005). Are these jobs—
and the certification required—the new threshold for entry into the 
middle class in the New Economy? Men with a high school degree 
previously gained access to the middle class through male-dominated 
occupations that provided a lifetime career with opportunities for 
upward advancement (Cappelli 1999; Kalleberg 2009). Much has been 
written about the breakdown of labor market opportunities for this 
population, but our study suggests that the associate’s degree—and

perhaps feminized health care occupations—may be replacing blue-
collar occupations as a key path to stable earnings and careers. The 
presence of men in low- and middle-skill care work occupations may 
redefine “women’s work” as both men’s and women’s work. however, 
research suggests that men, particularly white men, are navigating the 
glass escalator into the more technical, medical areas of care work in 
the health field in order to reap the rewards of rising wages and stabil-
ity. While women and minority men continue to be clustered in lower-
paying direct care occupations, the more technical frontline allied 
health occupations may be culturally reinterpreted as men’s work, 
preserving conventional understandings of masculinity.

NOTES
1. The occupational categories used in the analysis were created using the 
2000 u.S. Census Major Occupation Group Recodes.
2. We chose to use production occupations as the reference category so that we 
could directly compare frontline health care workers to those in production occu-
pations. Many production occupations provide jobs for low- and middle-skill 
men, but these are male-dominated occupations, in contrast to feminized frontline 
health care occupations.
