Abstract
Objective Currently
available
measles
vaccines
are
administered
by
subcutaneous
injections
and
require
reconstitution with a diluent and a cold chain, which is
resource intensive and challenging to maintain. To over-
come these challenges and potentially increase vaccination
coverage, microneedle patches are being developed to
deliver the measles vaccine. This study compares the cost-
effectiveness of using microneedle patches with traditional
vaccine delivery by syringe-and-needle (subcutaneous
vaccination) in children’s measles vaccination programs.
Methods We built a simple spreadsheet model to compute
the vaccination costs for using microneedle patch and
syringe-and-needle technologies. We assumed that micro-
needle vaccines will be, compared with current vaccines,
more heat stable and require less expensive cool chains
when used in the field. We used historical data on the
incidence
of
measles
among
communities
with
low
measles vaccination rates.
Results The cost of microneedle vaccination was estimated
at US$0.95 (range US$0.71–US$1.18) for the first dose,
compared with US$1.65 (range US$1.24–US$2.06) for the
first dose delivered by subcutaneous vaccination. At 95 %
vaccination coverage, microneedle patch vaccination was
estimated to cost US$1.66 per measles case averted (range
US$1.24–US$2.07) compared with an estimated cost of
US$2.64 per case averted (range US$1.98–US$3.30) using
subcutaneous vaccination.
Conclusions Use of microneedle patches may reduce
costs; however, the cost-effectiveness of patches would
depend on the vaccine recipients’ acceptability and vaccine
effectiveness of the patches relative to the existing con-
ventional vaccine-delivery method. This study emphasizes
the need to continue research and development of this
vaccine-delivery method that could boost measles elimi-
nation efforts through improved access to vaccines and
increased vaccination coverage.
Key Points
Use of microneedle patch technology in measles
vaccination programs potentially reduces costs and
extends vaccine coverage in hard-to-reach
communities.
Acceptability of new technology relative to the
conventional vaccine-delivery method is one of the
key elements of cost-effectiveness of the
microneedle patch.

 1 Introduction
The measles vaccine has been available since 1963, and
following its widespread use, global estimated measles
deaths have decreased dramatically from 2.6 million in
1980 to 145,700 in 2013 [1, 2]. Following substantial
decreases in measles incidence, an expert advisory panel
was convened by the World Health Organization (WHO)
and concluded that measles can and should be eradicated.
In 2012, a group of experts identified the research priorities
for global measles control and eradication including the
need for innovative strategies for increasing vaccination
coverage and improving vaccine delivery [3].
Currently available measles vaccines are commonly
packaged in multi-dose vials of lyophilized dried powder
that require a well-functioning cold chain (i.e., 2–8 �C) for
transportation and storage [4, 5]. These vaccines then
require reconstitution with a diluent, before being admin-
istered by subcutaneous injection using a conventional
syringe and needle. Once the vial is opened and the vaccine
is reconstituted, it has a shelf life of approximately 6 h,
after which unused reconstituted vaccine must be dis-
carded. Discarding such unused vaccine can lead to
notable levels of wastage. Therefore, delivering the vaccine
requires a complex logistical system and well-trained
healthcare personnel. To address such shortcomings, new
methods of vaccine delivery are being researched and
developed, such as aerosolized vaccines, dry powder, and
microneedle patches [6].
We focus this analysis on microneedle patches, which
have shown particular promise to date [4, 6–8]. These
patches consist of micron-scaled needles made of either
metal or a polymer. The metal needles are pre-coated with
the vaccine, while the polymer needles deliver the vaccine
by dissolving into the skin (i.e., dermis and epidermis)
[4, 6, 7]. Microneedle patches are likely to be fabricated
with an inexpensive plastic applicator that provides an
audible feedback (a snapping noise) when a user correctly
uses the device on a patient. Thus, the microneedle patch
may eliminate the need for in-the-field vaccine reconsti-
tution prior to administration, reducing the need for sharps
handling and waste disposal, and thus reducing vaccine
wastage. The simplicity of using patches can also poten-
tially reduce program costs because patients can be vac-
cinated by minimally trained health personnel or perhaps
even self-administered by a patient or a patient’s parent or
caregiver [4, 8]. In addition, preliminary findings have
shown that the microneedle patches will be more ther-
mostable than currently available vaccines [4], reducing
necessary cold chain volumes and easing transportation.
Prototype microneedle patches, containing the measles
vaccine,
successfully
generated
neutralizing
antibody
responses in a small animal model [4]. In light of these
positive results, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of using
the microneedle patch vs. a subcutaneous injection in
measles vaccination programs, primarily for low- and
middle-income countries. This technology may also be
suitable for vaccinating against other diseases. This anal-
ysis will aid practicing public health officials, and decision
makers in organizations who are contemplating funding
investments in the research and development of the
microneedle technology.
2 Methods
We built a simple spreadsheet-based, incidence-of-measles
model (Electronic Supplementary Material Appendix 1) to
calculate the potential vaccinations and related costs for a
hypothetical population of approximately 11 million that
consists of 1,000,000 children (9.2 % of the total popula-
tion) under 5 years of age. Actual size of the population
and the birth cohort do not impact the findings and con-
clusion of our analysis because the costs and efficiency of
two different vaccine-delivery methods are the primary
focus of this research. We used historical data recording
the incidence of measles among communities where chil-
dren had low, or even no, rates of measles vaccination
(Electronic Supplementary Material Appendix 2; Table 1).
We assumed that the risk of measles infection was equal
throughout the population of children. We then used pub-
lished data that provide estimates of a reduction in the
incidence of measles for every 1 % increase in children
effectively vaccinated against measles [5]. Note that Hall
and Jolley reported higher levels of reduction in measles
incidence once 80 % or more of children were effectively
vaccinated [5]. This is due to the ‘‘herd immunity’’ effect,
and the use of their estimates incorporates that effect into
our model. We then used the model to estimate the com-
parative impact and cost-effectiveness of potentially dif-
ferent
levels
of
measles
vaccine
effectiveness
and
vaccination coverage as a result of the two different types
of vaccine administration technologies (conventional sub-
cutaneous injection vs. microneedle patches).
In the base model, we assumed that 100 % of children in
the target population were susceptible to measles. We set
the vaccination coverage target at 95 %, vaccine effec-
tiveness of 85 % for both vaccination methods, and vaccine
compliance rates of 100 % for subcutaneous injection and
90 % for microneedle patches. We further assumed 7.7 %
of those receiving the first dose of measles-containing
vaccine (MCV) would drop out and not receive the second
dose of vaccine. We assumed in this population of children
that the WHO measles vaccination recommendations
328
B. B. Adhikari et al.
 would be followed, and that children would receive two
doses of MCV [9]. We further assumed that these two
doses (the first dose: MCV1 and the second dose: MCV2)
were administered in a 1-year period to susceptible chil-
dren in the model population. We examined the impact of
differing levels of coverage (from 0 to 100 %). We also
varied the effectiveness of the vaccine by both dose and
type of vaccine administration technology (Table 1).
We used previously published costs data for measles
vaccination from Zambia [15], and adjusted those costs to
2010 $US, assuming a 3 % annual inflation rate (Tables 2,
3). We calculated different sets of costs for delivering and
administering the first and second doses of measles vaccine
using two different technologies (subcutaneous injections
and microneedle patches). The first dose is considered a
routine measles vaccine and the second dose is similar to a
mass vaccination campaign, referred to as a supplementary
immunization activity (SIA) [9]. We also allowed for
technology-induced differences in vaccine storage (cold
chain or cool chain), and differing levels of vaccine
wastage factors (Tables 2, 3). Characterizations of costs for
the first and second dose are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
We calculated the cost-effectiveness of vaccine technolo-
gies as the cost per measles case averted, estimated by
dividing the total costs of the vaccination program by the
total number of measles cases averted. We then compared
the cost-effectiveness of conventional needle-based tech-
nology (subcutaneous injection, status quo) and the new
technology (microneedle patch) in terms of costs of per
case of measles averted. We took the perspective of the
payer (budgetary impact to a government of a low- and
middle-income country) of vaccination services. We did
not account for medical care-associated savings as a result
of measles cases averted, as we assumed that the type of
vaccination technology will not alter the benefits from an
averted case of measles (i.e., medical care costs saved are
the same for both technologies). Because we considered a
1-year analytic time frame, we discounted model inputs
and outputs, and the potential benefits of measles cases
averted beyond a 1-year period.

 mumps, and rubella vaccine [16]. They concluded that a
single dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine ‘‘is
at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles…’’.
Kidd et al. [14] estimated the following levels of measles
vaccine effectiveness in three regions of Burkina Faso: in
Bogodogo 94 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 45–99); in
Zorgho 87 % (95 % CI 37–97); and, in Sahel 84 % (95 %
CI 41–96). More recently, Yang et al. estimated that in
Guangzhou Province, China, for the period 2009–2012, in
children aged 8 months to 14 years, a single dose of
measles vaccine was 89.1 % (95 % CI 44.5–97.9) effec-
tive, and two or more doses were 97.8 % (95 % CI 88.3–
99.6) effective [12]. On the basis of the results from these
studies, we assumed that a second dose boosted vaccine
effectiveness to 97.75% (among those receiving the second
dose). We further assumed, based on WHO data, that 7.7 %
of those receiving the first dose of MCV would drop out
and not receive the second dose [17]. In the sensitivity
analyses, we consider the impact of different levels of
vaccine effectiveness applied to the two vaccine adminis-
tration technologies (Table 1). We used the following
general equation to estimate the impacts of measles vac-
cination programs:
Reduction in incidence of measles after vaccination
¼ susceptible children
� percentage of children effectively vaccinated;
where the percentage of children effectively vaccinated is
the percent of the model population vaccinated multiplied
by vaccine effectiveness. The values used in these equa-
tions are shown in Table 1. We estimated the impacts of
vaccine coverage values ranging from 0 to 100 %. Users of
our spreadsheet model can also explore the impact of
changes in assumed vaccine effectiveness.
2.2 Vaccination Program Costs
We assumed that the first dose of MCV was administered
as part of a routine vaccination program, while the second
dose of MCV would be similar to the mass vaccination
campaign, referred to as a SIA. In 2009, the WHO reported
that 132 countries deliver the second dose of MCV as part
of routine vaccination programs, while 49 countries con-
duct ‘‘regular, nationwide campaigns… (SIA)’’. Routine
vaccines are usually delivered in healthcare facilities (e.g.,
health posts and clinics), whereas vaccines in SIAs are

a Costs associated with subcutaneous syringe-and-needle injection were based on Dayan et al. [15],
adjusted to 2010 $US. Costs for microneedle patches were based either on subcutaneous syringe-and-needle
injection costs (e.g., vaccine antigen, transportation, and supplies) or expert opinion. See text for further
details
b The wastage factor was defined as the number of vaccine doses wasted per vaccine dose administered,
and the wastage factor values for the subcutaneous syringe and needle were based on the results of
published studies [15, 18]. The wastage cost included the costs of vaccine, cold (or cool chain) storage, and
transport; we assumed microneedle patches required cool chain storage, were single dose packaged, and
had 50 % less wastage than syringe-and-needle vaccines

 delivered outside the healthcare facilities to reach children
who do not have easy access to the health system [9].
The microneedle technology is not yet fully developed
nor licensed for large-scale production and use; thus, there
are no available data on the costs associated with its use in
the field. Therefore, we made the following assumptions to
calculate costs (Tables 2, 3 provide relevant sources).
Vaccine (antigen), transportation, and social mobiliza-
tion costs were the same for both technologies (i.e., sub-
cutaneous injection and microneedle patch).
Because microneedles can be applied by ‘‘minimally
trained personnel’’, we assumed that the costs of personnel,
supervision, planning, and training for microneedle patches
will at least be 50 % less than that of subcutaneous
vaccinations.
Currently available vaccines required a cold chain (e.g.,
2–8 �C) [18], whereas microneedle vaccine patches need
only a cool chain (e.g., room temperature of 15–20 �C; the
exact requirements have yet to be determined) [4].
For the syringe-and-needle vaccination method, we used
vaccine wastage factors of 3.42 and 1.10 for MCV1 and
MCV2, respectively [15], but for microneedles, because of
greater heat stability, we assumed vaccine wastage would
be 50 % less than the syringe-and-needle method.
We assumed, owing to the simplicity of design, that the
fabrication of microneedle patches will cost one third of the
cost of manufacturing subcutaneous injection equipment.
To address the uncertainties around the costs, for each
cost item, we used mean, low, and high itemized costs to
estimate the costs in a range (Tables 2, 3).
Because vaccination by microneedles is a new tech-
nology, we assumed there might be vaccine acceptabil-
ity/compliance issues that will directly or indirectly affect
the vaccine effectiveness. We thus considered a wide range
of vaccine coverages (Table 1).
We did not include any costs associated with treating
vaccine-related adverse events because the safety profile
for microneedle patches has not been assessed. Two small

 studies (fewer than 100 persons per study group), that
assessed the potential acceptability and efficacy of micro-
needle patches, did not note any serious adverse events
associated with using microneedle patches. Neither study,
however, used the measles vaccine [6, 7]. We did explore,
using ranges of costs as a proxy (Tables 2, 3), the potential
for increased costs as a result of factors such as treating
vaccine-related adverse events.
2.3 Sensitivity Analyses
In addition to varying the percentage of persons vaccinated
from 0 to 100 % [13], and allowing for variability in costs,
we also conducted a number of sensitivity analyses. We
analyzed the impact on the cost-effectiveness vaccination
by altering the vaccine effectiveness of MCV1 from the
baseline value of 85 % to either 77 % (10 % lower from
baseline) and 94 % (10 % higher from baseline). We
considered the impact on the number of measles cases in
the model population with both changes in vaccination
coverage and three different levels of vaccine effective-
ness. The latter analysis allowed us to consider the trade-
off from using a technology that provides a relatively lower
level of effectiveness in an individual, but allowed a
greater degree of vaccination coverage and thus produced
an overall greater degree of vaccine-induced protection in
the vaccinated population of children.
3 Results
3.1 Estimated Measles Incidence
Without any vaccination, potentially almost the entire
susceptible population of children would become infected
by measles in the 1-year period (Fig. 1, at 0 % MCV
coverage). As the vaccine coverage increases, the inci-
dence of measles decreases (Fig. 1). Rate of decline by
increasing vaccine coverage for microneedle patches is
lower because of the underlying assumption of a lower
compliance (e.g., vaccine acceptance) rate. The rate of
decline in measles incidence with the second dose is non-
linear owing to the fact that the second dose of vaccine is
effective only to the persons who are not immunized by the
first dose. The second dose acts as booster for immuniza-
tion among children.
3.2 Estimated Total Costs per Administered Dose
We estimated total costs per administered dose of the first
dose of MCV to be US$1.65 (range US$1.24–US$2.06) for
subcutaneous vaccinations, and US$0.95 (range US$0.71–
US$1.19)
for
vaccination
using
microneedle
patches
(Table 2). Similarly, we estimated the cost of the second
dose of MCV by subcutaneous injection was US$1.07
(range US$0.80–US$1.34) compared with US$0.70 (range
US$0.52–US$0.87) for the microneedle patch (Table 3).
The largest cost component was wastage, responsible for
30–65 % of mean costs for MCV1 using the subcutaneous
syringe-and-needle injection (Table 2).
3.3 Cost per Case of Measles Averted
As a result of the non-linear nature of the measles cases-by-
percent vaccinated (Fig. 1), the cost-per-case averted
changed (i.e., increased) as coverage of vaccination
increased (Fig. 2). For example, for subcutaneous vacci-
nations, at 50 % coverage, the mean cost per case averted
was US$2.04 (range US$1.53–US$2.54) and at 95 %
coverage,
the
mean
was
US$2.64
(range
US$1.98–
US$3.30). Similarly, for the cost of vaccinations using
microneedle patches, at 50 % coverage, the mean cost per
case averted was US$1.32 (range US$0.99–US$1.65) and
the cost was US$1.66 per case averted (range US$1.24–
US$2.07) at 95 % coverage (Table 4).
Costs of vaccination delivery and administration are
described in Tables 2 and 3. Epidemiological parameters
and values are described in the text and Table 1. For
clarity, we omitted cost-effectiveness uncertainty bounds
because of ranges in the costs of vaccination (Table 4).
Because of the assumed reduced costs associated with
using the microneedle patch (Tables 2, 3), the costs per
case averted using the microneedle patch were always less
than those associated with subcutaneous vaccinations.
Regardless of the vaccination coverage levels compared,
there were no overlaps in the ranges of cost-effective-
ness—microneedle patches always cost less per case
averted than syringe-and-needle delivery (Table 4; Fig. 2).
3.4 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
Average costs presented in Table 4 to avert measles cases
are based on the assumption that the microneedle patches
are equally as effective as subcutaneous injections. How-
ever, this may not be the case in practice. In the context of
two alternative vaccine-delivery methods not being equally
effective, we need to compare the costs and outcomes in
terms
of
the average
cost-effectiveness
ratio. When
microneedle patches are equally or more effective than the
subcutaneous injection, microneedle patches are cost sav-
ing. As the effectiveness of microneedle patches increases,
the cost savings increases as more measles cases are
averted by a more effective vaccine-delivery method
(Fig. 3).
There can be, under certain conditions, a trade-off
between vaccine effectiveness and coverage. For example,
332
B. B. Adhikari et al.
 when the first dose (MCV1) was 95 % effective, and there
was 55 % coverage, there were approximately 350,000
cases. The same impact could be achieved for a vaccination
technology that was 75 % effective but achieved approxi-
mately 70 % coverage (because, say, it was easier to use
effectively in the field) (top dotted line, Fig. 4).

Cost-Effectiveness of Microneedle Patches for Vaccination

 This differential between effectiveness and coverage,
however, disappeared when MCV1 was 95 % effective,
and there was approximately 85 % vaccination coverage,
causing approximately 200,000 cases. At 75 % effective-
ness, even 100 % coverage did not achieve the same
number of cases (lower dotted line, Fig. 4). In situations
where ‘high’ levels of vaccination coverage (e.g., 85 % or
more) have already been achieved and maintained, the
potential advantages of the microneedle may not be suffi-
cient to cause it to be widely used if microneedle-admin-
istered vaccines are notably less effective than syringe and
needle.

schedule of measles-containing vaccine with the second-dose coverage being 7.7 % less than the first-dose coverage, 85 % vaccine effectiveness
for a single dose, and 97 % effectiveness for two doses. Costs of vaccination delivery and administration were as described in Tables 2 and 3.

 3.5 Sensitivity Analyses
Because of the differences in vaccination costs (Tables 2,
3), even if microneedle patches are less effective than
currently available syringe-and-needle vaccinations, they
would still cost less per case averted (Fig. 2). For example,
if MCV1 using a microneedle patch was only 77 %
effective and subcutaneous vaccinations 94 % effective, it
would still cost less per case averted to use a microneedle
patch under any comparison of different levels of vacci-
nation (Fig. 2). Cost-effectiveness of vaccination is also
dependent on the existing incidence of measles (or existing
immunity) in a given population. The average cost per case
of measles averted is lower in a population with a high
level of expected measles incidence (low level of existing
immunity) and the costs per case averted by immunization
increase in the population with a higher proportion of
immunity against measles (Fig. 5).
4 Discussion
We showed that in a variety of circumstances, the use of
microneedle patches instead of subcutaneous injections for
measles vaccination campaigns could substantially reduce
costs. In addition to the cost advantages, microneedle
patches
potentially
have
several
important
logistical
advantages (e.g., reduced cold chain requirements, fewer
trained staff required) that could increase vaccine cover-
age, especially in hard-to-reach communities. Other vac-
cine-related technologies, such as aerosolized vaccines,
could also offer advantages over the subcutaneous vacci-
nation [19]. These technologies should also be carefully
monitored and evaluated. However, many of those poten-
tial alternate technologies may still require the vaccine to
be kept in cold chains, and thus do not offer the logistical
advantages of the microneedle-based technologies.
In this article, we have computed costs of the measles
vaccine based on a study by Dayan et al. [15]. Levin et al.
[20] estimated the costs of routine (first-dose) and SIA
(second-dose) measles vaccines (Table 5). We assumed
constant average costs per vaccine (irrespective of cover-
age level), but Levin et al.’s estimates are dependent on the
existing vaccination coverage. They assumed increasing
marginal costs as coverage increases. The average costs for
the routine vaccine are close to our estimates (subcuta-
neous injection), but the SIA vaccine (the second dose of
MCV in our estimates) costs are somewhat different. Our
estimates are country neutral and probably it is one of the
benefits of being country neutral that we do not need to
match with any other country’s estimate as long as we are
within the range. Average costs of a measles case averted
largely depend on the existing incidence of measles. In a
population with a lower incidence of measles, relative costs
are less in terms of costs per case averted (Fig. 5).
In cost-effectiveness analyses, we assumed that micro-
needle patches were equally effective as subcutaneous
injections in immunization against measles. Figure 6
illustrates the average costs of measles cases averted by
microneedle patches. To be cost effective, patches should
be at least 45 % effective relative to syringe-and-needle
technology.
In most developing countries, immunization programs
are limited and the effect of immunization of such pro-
grams is little felt [10]. To achieve the goal of global

 microneedles can be used to vaccinate against other dis-
eases such as influenza, polio, and hepatitis B [7, 21, 22].
Our analysis has several limitations. Our generic, non-
country-specific approach to modeling may not realistically
match the burden of measles and costs of vaccination in
many countries where eliminating measles is still a sig-
nificant challenge. As the microneedle technology moves
closer to actual mass production and deployment, it may be
worthwhile to build a complex disease transmission model,
set for each specific country where the new technology
could be used.
Another limitation is that we only included direct costs
associated with vaccine delivery and excluded any costs
associated with the medical care of measles cases, vaccine-
related side effects, and indirect costs incurred by persons
and communities (e.g., illness-related time lost from work).
However, such costs likely would not vary by vaccination
technology and excluding these indirect costs is not likely
to bias the results toward either technology. Another
potential limitation is that many of the vaccination costs
used in this paper were measured in Zambia [15] and such
costs may vary in other developing countries. However,
what is most important and ‘drives’ the results presented
here, is not the actual costs but rather the cost differential
that may occur when a measles vaccination program
switches
from
syringe-and-needle
technology
to
the
microneedle technology. The Excel tool (Electronic Sup-
plementary Material Appendix 1) allows users to modify
the itemized costs and see the impacts on the cost-effec-
tiveness of vaccination methods.
In addition, because the microneedle patch is a new and
untested vaccine-delivery method, we had to make several
assumptions about the costs associated with vaccinations
using microneedle patches, such as the assumption that a
cool rather than a cold chain is required for microneedles.
The microneedle technology is still in the early phases of
research and development, and has not been licensed by the
US Food and Drug Administration. Our cost-effectiveness
comparison assumed that microneedle patches are already
developed and in mass production, and so we did not
account for costs associated with preclinical research
including costs associated with obtaining intellectual
property rights, implementing clinical trials, further pro-
duct development, and manufacturing of microneedle pat-
ches. Similarly, the public acceptance rate of new vaccine
technology would be determined by factors such as
advertisements and other promotional activities. Costs of
advertisement and promotions are not included in the
analysis. Therefore, the assumed cost savings would not be
fully realized until the new vaccine-delivery method was in
routine use. Finally, the potential cost advantages of
microneedle vaccinations would not be realized in situa-
tions where the microneedle patch confers notably less
protection than vaccines delivered by subcutaneous injec-
tion, and vaccination coverage is already at ‘high levels’.
5 Conclusion
Use of microneedle patches in childhood measles vacci-
nation programs may reduce the costs of immunization and
potentially increase vaccination coverage, particularly in
the hard-to-reach population in developing countries. Cost-
effectiveness of patches depends on various factors such as
vaccine acceptance rates and vaccine effectiveness of the
microneedle patches relative to the subcutaneous vaccine-
delivery method compared in this study. Potential benefits
examined regarding the use of microneedle patches for use
in measles vaccination programs may well be extended to
other vaccines. This reinforces the need to complete
research and development and conduct clinical trials of
microneedle patches to determine their suitability for use in
large-scale vaccination programs.
