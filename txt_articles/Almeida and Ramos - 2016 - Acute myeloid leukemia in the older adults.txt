AML is an aggressive hematological malignancy with highest incidence in the older adults. The adverse
features of AML in the elderly, and the frailties and comorbidities frequently present in them, make their
management a particularly difficult therapeutic challenge. In this context, it is important to assess
carefully patient- as well as disease-associated prognostic features with validated tools. The fittest pa-
tients should be considered for curative therapy, such as bone marrow transplantation, whereas low
intensity options may be more appropriate for frail patients. Here we review how to assess patients with
elderly AML and the treatments options available for them.

1. Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare disease afflicting an-
nually 3–4 persons per 100,000 individuals. With a median age at
diagnosis of 67 years, this disease is far more common in the el-
derly [1]. In this age group, AML has a particularly dismal outcome
with less than 5% of the patients being alive 5 years after the di-
agnosis, as compared to 40% in the young [2,3]. Considering that
individuals aged 65 in the Western world are expected to survive
approximately another 20 years, and even those aged 80 three
additional years [4], AML has a devastating impact on the survival
of this age group.
The reasons for the poor outcomes in the older adults are both
patient- and disease-related. Advanced age is often accompanied
by frailty and comorbidities, which have an important impact on
the tolerance these patients have to intensive treatment mod-
alities [5]. In addition, the lower rates of complete remission (CR)
in the elderly (40–50% vs 60–70% in the young) [3] and the short
duration seen in those who are eligible for treatment [5], point
towards a different disease biology in this age group. From a
clinical viewpoint, it is far more frequent for elderly patients to
have received previous cytotoxic treatment or radiotherapy or to
have antecedent hematologic diseases, such as myelodysplastic
(MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms [5]. In addition to these
clinical features, the cytogenetic profile of elderly patients with
AML also differs from that of younger patients, presenting a
greater incidence of multiple chromosomal abnormalities [6]. The
introduction of new potent sequencing technologies has shed

 considerable light on the molecular mechanisms of AML patho-
physiology, and further reinforced the observation that AML in the
elderly is biologically distinct. Thus, mutation screening has
identified mutations in genes coding for epigenetic regulators,
such as TET2, DMNT3A, IDH1/2, ASXL1 and EZH2, kinases and cell
cycle regulators, such as TP53, NPM1 and FLT3 and transcription
factors, such as RUNX1 and CEBPA [7], and showed that the cy-
togenetic and mutational profile of AML in the older adults pa-
tients is significantly different from that of younger patients [8].
The methylation patterns seen in them resemble more closely
those seen in MDS [9]. These unique features of AML in the elderly
population urge a fresh approach to these patients.
2. Geriatric assessment
Older adults frequently have an advanced biological age. This
not a constant feature and a number of them keep fit and healthy
until late in their lives. Nevertheless, the opportunity to develop
several diseases, as well as to acquire a low functional reserve,
increases with chronological age and any experienced malignant
hematologist recognizes that some elderly AML patients may be
unable to withstand intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic he-
mopoietic cell transplantation. An excruciating clinical problem is
how to predict with confidence such a situation when confronting
an apparently fit/unfit individual patient. In this situation, a
comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the appropriate an-
swer and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has issued
specific guidelines to help the physician in the care of older adults
with cancer [10]. However, CGA is somehow complex and not al-
ways readily available. Some screening tools (e.g. VES13 or G8)
have been developed to decide which patients deserve a CGA in
order to optimize resources [11,12]. Despite the fact that they
predict survival in hematological patients (eg. G8 score up to 14
score points seems a bad prognostic factor), their sensitivity and
specificity as compared to the gold standard (i.e. CGA) is not op-
timal [13,14] and a simplified geriatric assessment approach is
much needed and now actively pursued (see the next section). Our
suggestion for this purpose, based on the approach of Klepin et al.
[15,16], is shown in Table 1 and requires that the clinical team
becomes familiar with some additional clinical tools beyond per-
formance status and comorbidity scores [17,18], such us the Short
Physical Performance Battery [19], or the more straightforward
Gait Speed [20,21], as well as the Modified Mini-Mental Score [22]
or the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire [23].
3. Prognosis
The management of AML in the elderly patient presents a sig-
nificant challenge for hematologists. Careful evaluation of both
patient and disease is required in each individual case to make
optimal management decisions, and maximize the benefit to the
patient. Apart from the extremely old patients, chronological age
per se is particularly unreliable in identifying patients who will not
tolerate intensive regimens.
As stated in the introduction, AML in the older adult shows some
biological differences with AML in the young. As far as prognostic
factors are concerned (see Table 2), the vast majority are the same,
but their relative proportion is different. The data from MRC/LRF,
based on more than two thousand patients included in clinical trials
in UK, showed that age, performance status, white blood cell count,
cytogenetics, and type of AML (de novo vs. secondary) are the most
relevant prognostic factors [24]. Recent analysis of population-de-
rived data from Sweden [25] included outcomes from over 3000
adult AML patients, of which 26% had secondary AML. Analysis of
prognostic factors found that secondary AML significantly impacted
survival in younger patients but, in older patients, it did not emerge
as an independent poor prognostic factor, suggesting that second-
ary AML lacks the prognostic impact in this population previously
attributed by the MRC/LRF [24].
Flow cytometry has attained a central role in the diagnosis of
AML and recent data have shown that the degree of phenotypic
maturity determined by this technique can also deliver important
prognostic information in the elders [26]. These phenotypes can
predict both CR rates and survival, suggesting that they reflect
intrinsic resistance to treatment. The prognostic weight of mini-
mal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry seems compara-
tively higher in the elders than in the young [27].
By contrast, the relative impact of molecular findings in the
elderly is poorly defined, probably as a consequence of a less in-
tensive research in this population. At present time, the impact of
the associations appears to be in general the same than in the
young, despite the fact that their relative weight may be lower
[28]. Interestingly, in some particular cases, such as DNMT3A co-
don R882 mutations [29], the behavior is opposite.

 Finally, the best-defined prognostic factors come from selected
cohorts of patients participating in clinical trials, something that
might have hidden other patient-derived prognostic factors. In this
sense, comorbidity [5,30], polypharmacy [31], physical function
and cognition [32,33], as well as fatigue [32], appear to be also
relevant for prognosis, since they impact on patient's ability to
withstand the insult of chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT). Among specific comorbidities, previous
cerebrovascular, renal, liver, psychiatric and rheumatological dis-
eases have been particularly associated with increased risk of
death [5]. As regards comorbidity scores, the Charlson comorbidity
index [17] and the HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI) [34] have been
shown to predict overall survival in elderly AML.
4. Treatment options
Life expectancy in AML not only depends on the disease itself,
but also on usual risk factors for mortality in the general popula-
tion. Nevertheless, the tremendous impact of AML on the short
term (conferring a very high relative mortality) overrides any other
consideration as regards the eventual need for specific therapy.
Thus, if the patient does not receive specific treatment, his/her life
expectancy will probably be only a few months since diagnosis,
although low-blast count AML might have a slower evolution [35].
Nowadays, only 40% of the elderly population receive specific AML
therapy within the first 3 months from diagnosis in the US, ac-
cording to recent data from SEER-Medicare Database, highlighting
that there is much room for improvement in this field [36].
Treatment options for elderly AML must be based on four main
factors: patient's clinical condition, disease characteristics, patient
wishes and social support. Thus, the most frail and oldest among
the oldest will have the least net benefit from chemotherapy or
hematopoietic transplantation, even if they receive the best avail-
able treatment, while the fittest and youngest patients will benefit

 most. Having said that, it is obvious that the “relative prognosis” of
an elderly AML patient will depend on our capability to administer
an effective treatment, and that the risk-benefit of subjecting a
patient to intensive chemotherapy must be carefully weighed and
based not only on the predicted toxicity of the regimen, but also on
the likelihood of response, where cytogenetics play a dominant role.
Indeed, the relation between adverse cytogenetics and poor and
short-lived responses to intensive chemotherapy have been con-
sistently demonstrated [37,38]. The most favorable situation would
be a patient harboring acute promyelocytic leukemia, who can be
treated conventionally in most cases with rather optimistic ex-
pectations, followed by core-binding-factor leukemias, where the
benefit of conventional chemotherapy is also important. In the re-
mainder of the elderly AML patients, intensive chemotherapy has
not consistently shown to improve overall survival within con-
trolled clinical trials (Table 3), and the information that supports its
potential benefit comes from registry data. This is the consequence
not only of a high early mortality, but also of a short duration of the
responses [38]. Thus, the proportion of AML patients aged 65 years
and over that nowadays receive intensive chemotherapy in daily
practice is much lower than in the young [36]. The role of HCT in
the treatment of elderly AML will be discussed later on in this re-
view, but the proportion of older adults that are finally transplanted
is also small.
The comparisons of intensive vs. attenuated/supportive therapy
are scarce and of low quality. By contrast, higher-level evidence
supports the fact that patients treated with low-intensity regi-
mens live longer than those that received only supportive therapy
(Table 3). In practice, the physician should aim to proceed to
conventional intensive chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic
transplantation whenever this is feasible (taking into account
disease-related, patient-related and transplantation-related prog-
nostic factors), since this is the best option for curing the leukemia,
whereas supportive therapy alone should be avoided as much as
possible, and every effort should be made to administer at least
low-intensity chemotherapy. Recently, a predictive scoring system
for response and survival in elderly patients treated in real world
by azacitidine, based exclusively on clinical features, has been
developed and validated in Europe [39] (Table 4 and Fig. 1). Fur-
thermore, some data suggest that this drug might even result in
superior OS, as compared to intensive chemotherapy or low-dose
cytarabine, in patients harboring high-risk cytogenetics, MDS-re-
lated AML, or erythroleukemia [40–42]. This might be improved in
the near future by including some molecular predictors such as
mutations in TET2 [43] and IDH1/2 [44].
Despite promising response rates, none of the various other
agents tested, other than azacitidine in low-blast count leukemia,
have been able to overcome the 12 months landmark for median
overall survival (Table 5) and there is great need for novel agents
in this group of patients.
Currently, there are numerous novel agents being tested in
clinical trials, many of which target recently described molecular
defects. These include modified cytotoxics, epigenetic regulators,
cell cycle kinase inhibitors, etc. Many are currently being tested in
monotherapy or in combination with already established regi-
mens. According to very preliminary results from Phase I/II trials,
several agents hold promise, such as a) The FLT3 inhibitors gil-
teritinib (ASP2215) [45] and sorafenib [46], which have been tes-
ted in monotherapy, and in combination with chemotherapy in the

 case of sorafenib. Remission rates obtained with monotherapy are
as high as 50% in patients with FLT3 mutations. Combination of
sorafenib with chemotherapy in adults with mutated FLT3 im-
proved 1 yr survival from 30% to 62% [46]. As regards the multi-
kinase inhibitor midostaurin, its efficacy in combination with
standard chemotherapy (RATIFY trial) in patients under 60 [47] is
yet to be proved in patients over 60, b) The Inhibitors of IDH1 and
IDH2, which have obtained overall response rates of about 40% in
heavily pre-treated older AML patients harboring IDH-1 or IDH-2
mutations [48], c) The addition of the HDAC inhibitor pracinostat
to azacitidine, that achieved 1-year survival rates of 60% with 54%
overall response rate [49], d) Monoclonal antibodies, such as va-
dastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A), an anti-CD33 antibody con-
jugated with a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer, as well as Durvalu-
mab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, that have shown promising pre-
liminary response rates and are currently being tested further
[50,51].
The progressive unraveling of the molecular pathophysiology of
AML is likely to identify more therapeutic targets, which may
widen in the near future the therapeutic armamentarium for el-
derly AML.
5. Hematopoietic cell transplantation
HCT is generally recommended for AML patients with inter-
mediate or high risk cytogenetics, when the aim of treatment is
curative. However, elderly patients are seldom offered a transplant
mainly due to concerns regarding toxicity, despite the fact that the
main reason for death after HCT in the older adult is not toxicity
but relapse [52]. Fortunately, there has been a steady increase in
the number of HCTs in this patient group in the past decade [53] as
a consequence of the introduction of less intensive conditioning
regimes, which have significantly reduced toxicity whilst main-
taining
successful
engraftment.
Nevertheless,
nowadays
only
about 8% of elderly patients with AML undergo HCT each year in
the US [36], even though they constitute more than 50% of the
new AML cases.
Outcome analysis in this population indicates that those who
are submitted to HCT have a relatively favorable outcome, with
almost 40% 3-year relapse-free and overall survival [54]. It is
therefore essential to identify those patients whose fitness and
disease characteristics make them the best candidates for trans-
plant. Beyond chronological age [55], factors that predict OS and
relapse are high risk AML (cytogenetics, gene mutations), higher
HCT-CI scores, patient CMV status and greater HLA disparity, while
the impact of donor age is still disputed, especially in the context
of reduced-intensity conditioning regimes. In addition, poor per-
formance status and active infections are associated with poorer
outcomes and these patients should not be transplanted, unless
their condition improves. Similarly, patients who have active dis-
ease at the time of HCT are very unlikely to maintain remission
long term, and should be rather rescued with chemotherapy and
transplanted when in CR. Patients with favorable prognostic dis-
ease, especially those with CBF mutations and no additional poor
risk cytogenetic or molecular markers, do well with consolidation
chemotherapy and do not benefit from transplant in first remis-
sion. Therefore all elderly patients with good performance status
(ECOG PS 0-1) and with any disease risk other than the good
prognostic group should be considered for HCT, depending on
their HCT-CI [56] and EBMT [57] risk score (Table 6).
The role of geriatric assessment in identifying patient vulner-
abilities before HCT is still in the beginning, but gait speed, in-
strumental activities of daily living and cognition evaluation,
among other clinical parameters, seem to be useful for this pur-
pose [58]. The analysis of the impact of HCT on the quality-of-life
of the older adults is also very much in its infancy. Lastly, it should
be emphasized that HCT candidates must be identified at diagnosis
and this option discussed upfront with the patient as some elderly
patients may not agree on an aggressive treatment course.
6. Social issues
Dependency, disability, general functioning, cognition, quality-
of-life, caregiver, burden of disease…are recurrent terms when
confronting diseases of the elderly. Many older adults, but not
most, would keep free of dependency and disability until late in
their lives, and the very proportion will depend on their previous
life-style and comorbidity. In this population, the optimal target
should be to cure the disease without compromising heavily the
quality-of-life on the short term, as well maintaining general
functioning and cognition on the long term. A systematic evalua-
tion of quality-of-life during treatment and general functioning
and cognition of this population, before and after treatment,
would be of great help for informing clinical decisions, but for the
time being the available information is scarce.
Social and family support is critical in patients dependent for
basic activities of daily life, but also for those dependent only for
instrumental activities or even in the independent ones (limited
budget, frequent hospital visits, unexpected medical complica-
tions, less prone to visit the Emergency Department) [59]. Such a
support may modulate the type and intensity of the treatment to
be given, even in the best developed countries, and becomes cri-
tical when welfare state is less than optimal.
Finally, the burden of disease in elderly AML is huge, for the
patient, his/her family and the whole society, and specially in this
time of targeted therapy. It is the physician's responsibility to try
and make an optimal use of scarce resources to achieve the best
outcomes while avoiding discrimination purely on grounds of age.
7. Conclusion
Treatment options remain limited for older adults with AML. It
is essential to tailor the choice of therapy to patient's condition
and disease characteristics, and a few patients benefit from ag-
gressive approaches. Some novel agents hold promise, but it is
unlikely that they will achieve much benefit as single agents and,
hopefully, combinations may provide better results in the future.
HCT is increasingly safer and, therefore, more feasible in this pa-
tient population but the toxicities of previous treatments and the
logistics of donor availability may delay the transplant and put at
risk the fragile remissions which may have been obtained. Whe-
ther as a bridge to transplant or on their own, low-intensity ap-
proaches may help to improve the outlook of elderly patients with
AML.

 Finally, additional research on the impact of pre-treatment
geriatric assessment and different therapeutic approaches, in-
cluding HCT, on the quality-of-life of older adults, as well as higher
social awareness of the huge resources concerned to improve the
outcome of this elderly population in the near future, is much
needed.
