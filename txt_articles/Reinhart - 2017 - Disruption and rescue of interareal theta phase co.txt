Rescuing executive functions in people with neurological and
neuropsychiatric disorders has been a major goal of psychology
and neuroscience for decades. Innovative computer-training re-
gimes for executive functions have made tremendous inroads, yet
the positive effects of training have not always translated into
improved cognitive functioning and often take many days to
emerge. In the present study, we asked whether it was possible to
immediately change components of executive function by directly
manipulating neural activity using a stimulation technology called
high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-
tACS). Twenty minutes of inphase stimulation over medial frontal
cortex (MFC) and right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) synchronized
theta (∼6 Hz) rhythms between these regions in a frequency and
spatially specific manner and rapidly improved adaptive behavior
with effects lasting longer than 40 min. In contrast, antiphase
stimulation in the same individuals desynchronized MFC-lPFC
theta phase coupling and impaired adaptive behavior. Surpris-
ingly, the exogenously driven impairments in performance could
be instantly rescued by reversing the phase angle of alternating
current. The results suggest executive functions can be rapidly up-
or down-regulated by modulating theta phase coupling of dis-
tant frontal cortical areas and can contribute to the development
of tools for potentially normalizing executive dysfunction in
patient populations.

A
daptive control refers to the dynamic processing that coor-
dinates goal pursuit, allowing us to adjust our actions to
changing situations and improve performance after events such
as negative feedback from the environment (1, 2). Impaired
adaptive control is observed in many neurological and neuro-
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer’s
disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy (3–9). Thus,
it is not surprising that efforts to improve adaptive control have long
characterized the fields of psychology and neuroscience.
Computerized training has proven to be effective in the do-
mains of language, motor function, and vision (10, 11). However,
in other cognitive domains such as attention, working memory,
and adaptive control, the effects of computer training interven-
tions have been contradictory and less clear (12–14). One sig-
nificant drawback to cognitive training is the duration of task
practice required, often on the order of days and weeks, before
desired results are achieved. Here, we asked whether it was
possible to use brain stimulation technology to induce immediate
and lasting neuroplastic changes in the functional connectivity
hypothesized to underlie the adaptive control of behavior and
learning in humans.
We targeted the phase coupling or synchronization of elec-
troencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in the theta frequency band
(∼6 Hz) between medial frontal cortex (MFC) and lateral pre-
frontal cortex (lPFC) because correlative studies have suggested
that functional cortical circuits for adaptive control may emerge
by theta phase coupling between these regions, specifically fol-
lowing control-related prompts such as motor errors, conflict, or
negative performance feedback (15, 16). We sought to isolate
and alter the spectral and spatial properties of connectivity, using
nine-channel high-definition transcranial alternating current
stimulation (or HD-tACS), which promises an unprecedented
degree of anatomical precision and the capability to conduct
multifocal modifications of neural activity in a frequency-specific
and bidirectional manner. The stimulation protocols delivered 6-
Hz HD-tACS simultaneously to MFC and lPFC with a relative
0° (inphase) or 180° (antiphase) phase difference between targeted
areas (Fig. 1A). We predicted that the different stimulation proto-
cols (i.e., inphase/antiphase) might bias error feedback-related
network synchronization in opposite directions, and thus facilitate
or impede the neural integration of MFC and lPFC. Second, if
MFC-lPFC theta coupling elicited by error feedback represents a
causal mechanism underlying flexible behavior, then a bidirectional
manipulation of this connectivity should cause bidirectional changes
(i.e., improvements and impairments) in performance related to
adaptive control and learning.
Results
In Experiment 1, each subject participated in three different
stimulation conditions (i.e., 6-Hz inphase, 6-Hz antiphase, and
sham) on different days with stimulation order counterbalanced
across subjects. Inphase/antiphase stimulation allowed us the
unique opportunity to gain bidirectional control over the nature
of the theta interaction between MFC and lPFC. We targeted
right lPFC in Experiment 1. During and after the delivery of HD-
tACS, on each day, subjects performed a modified version of a
Significance
We show that the timing of alternating-current stimulation can
couple or decouple low-frequency brain rhythms between
segregated frontal cortical areas in a highly selective fashion
without changing other neural frequencies, synchronization
across the opposite cerebral hemisphere, or local neural activ-
ity. The up- and down-regulation of interareal neural coupling
caused bidirectional changes in adaptive control and learning
measured behaviorally. It was even possible to induce behav-
ioral deficits and then immediately rescue this behavior in the
same individuals in a matter of minutes. The findings suggest it
is possible to intervene in the neural integration between
frontal cortical structures that govern complex human behav-
ior. The development of drug-free interventions for addressing
disorders of excessive and deficient cortical connectivity
is implicated.

 classic time-estimation task (17) while we recorded their EEG
brain rhythms (Fig. 1B). Since the original discovery of human
feedback-related electrophysiological activity, this task has been
rigorously used to study feedback-guided learning, and thus is a
model task for examining interareal neural communication
during adaptive behavior and learning.
In the task, participants were instructed to respond when they
had estimated a time-lapse of 1.7 s. Feedback at the end of the
trial indicated whether the estimation was “too fast,” “too slow,”
or “correct.” A response ±200 ms around target time was con-
sidered correct. Six blocks of 80 trials each with valid feedback
were interleaved with six blocks of 20 trials each without valid
feedback (Fig. 1C, see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods for
details). This manipulation allowed us to examine adaptive be-
havior and learning using performance measures in nonfeedback
blocks that would reflect the maintenance of the internal rep-
resentation of the time interval learned during preceding feed-
back trials, as no external feedback was available to guide later
adjustment. We used established measures of learning (i.e., error
magnitude and response variability) (18) and adaptive control
(i.e., adjustment efficiency) (19) to evaluate the effects of stim-
ulation on behavior.
Experiment 1. Shifting the phase of the alternating current applied
simultaneously to MFC and right lPFC, switched the direction of
the causal effects on learning and adaptive behavior. As shown in
Fig. 2A, antiphase stimulation increased error magnitude [F(1, 29) =
6.833; P = 0.014] and response variability [F(1, 29) = 4.871;
P = 0.035] and decreased adjustment efficiency [F(1, 29) = 13.149;
P < 0.01] relative to sham. By stimulating subjects during their
performance of the task, we could observe the emergence of
the behavioral deficits that occurred roughly after the third
initial block (i.e., ∼18 min) and outlasted the 40-min post-
stimulation period. The consistency in behavioral deficits over
time prevented subjects from learning from feedback in the
antiphase condition [feedback × time interactions, Fs(5, 145) <
2.039; Ps > 0.142], unlike during the sham baseline, when the
same subjects showed evidence of learning and adaptive efficiency
[feedback × time interactions, Fs(5, 145) > 2.716; Ps < 0.042].
In contrast, inphase stimulation caused the opposite pattern
of results: decreasing error magnitude [F(1, 29) = 61.058; P <
0.01] and response variability [F(1, 29) = 51.746; P < 0.01], and
increasing adjustment efficiency [F(1, 29) = 43.625; P < 0.01],
relative to sham. These behavioral benefits began roughly after
the second initial block (i.e., ∼10 min) and continued through the
full recording session. The learning improvements after inphase
stimulation were so dramatic that subjects appeared to immedi-
ately reach peak levels of performance, no longer requiring explicit
feedback to perform the task at high proficiency (Fig. 2A, blue lines,
blocks 5–12). This observation was supported by stimulation ×
feedback interactions for error magnitude [F(1, 29) = 4.527; P =
0.042] and response variability [F(1, 29) = 5.368; P = 0.028] during
the poststimulation period. To rule out artifacts related to the 6-Hz
stimulation protocol, we administered the same inphase HD-tACS
protocol except using 35-Hz alternating current. We observed no
significant effects of the 35-Hz stimulation on behavior [Fs(1, 20) <
1.117; Ps > 0.303], suggesting a degree of frequency specificity in the
frontal mechanism augmented by the 6-Hz stimulation driving
changes in adaptive behavior (see Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, SI Re-
sults for details). Thus, by reversing the relative phase difference of
the alternating current applied over medial and right lateral frontal
cortices, we could rapidly and bidirectionally control components of
adaptive efficiency and learning.
To test the hypothesis that the behavioral impairments/
improvements caused by 6-Hz stimulation were a result of
phase desynchronization/synchronization of theta rhythms be-
tween MFC and right lPFC, we examined feedback-related
interareal phase coupling on valid feedback trials immediately

recorded for 60 min while subjects performed the time-estimation task. The first 20 min consisted of inphase (blue), antiphase (red), or sham (black) HD-tACS,
depending on the test day, and was followed by 40 min in which no stimulation was applied. The task alternated between blocks of feedback (FB,
gray) and nonfeedback (NFB, white) trials. Critically, EEG data were analyzed only after the HD-tACS during the poststimulation period to avoid
stimulation-related artifacts.

 after the 20-min stimulation period (i.e., blocks 5–12). Criti-
cally, we focused only on data collected after the stimulation
period (i.e., after blocks 1–4) to avoid any confounding effects
of stimulation-induced artifacts (20). We calculated inter-
electrode phase coupling, a measure of the consistency of
phase angles between two regions averaged over trials (un-
weighted by magnitude information) (6, 21), focusing on
electrodes overlaying the MFC (i.e., FCz) and right lPFC (i.e.,
F6). The surface Laplacian was used to improve spatial pre-
cision and filter out distant effects resulting from volume
conduction (see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods for
methodological details and additional analyses controlling for
volume conduction) (6, 22).
We found evidence to support the hypothesis that the precise
timing of MFC-right-lPFC theta phase coupling governs the
flexible control of behavior. The bidirectional behavioral effects
of stimulation closely mirrored the bidirectional changes in theta
phase synchronization (Fig. 2 B and C). Relative to sham, 6-Hz
antiphase stimulation reduced theta phase coupling over MFC
and right lPFC on error versus correct feedback trials [F(1, 29) =
7.597; P = 0.01]. In contrast, inphase stimulation in the same
subjects more tightly aligned the phases of the theta rhythms
between these regions [F(1, 29) = 25.446; P < 0.01]. The phase-
dependent stimulation effects on theta coupling showed a high
degree of frequency and hemispheric (or spatial) specificity.
First, no between-stimulation condition differences in phase
coupling on error minus correct feedback trials were observed at
other frequency bands over the right [FCz-F6, Fs(2, 58) < 2.197;
Ps > 0.133] or left [FCz-F5, Fs(2, 58) < 0.630; Ps > 0.476; Fig. 2C]
hemisphere. Second, theta phase coupling between electrodes
overlaying MFC (FCz) and left lPFC (F5) was not modulated by
stimulation [F(2, 58) = 0.666; P = 0.508; Fig. 2C]. Moreover,
stimulation effects in connectivity were not accompanied by
changes in local (i.e., intraelectrode intertrial) signal power in
the theta band over regions of interest: MFC [FCz, F(2, 58) =
0.100; P = 0.864], right lPFC [F6, F(2, 58) = 0.409; P = 0.657], left

 lPFC [F5, F(2, 58) = 0.666; P = 0.508] (Fig. 2D). In sum, antiphase
stimulation applied concurrently to medial and right lateral
frontal cortices appeared to disrupt theta connectivity in a se-
lective fashion, causing behavioral impairments in adaptive ef-
ficiency and learning. However, by reversing the phase angle of
alternating current, we could completely flip the results, causing
a preferential boost to right-lateralized theta connectivity and
improvements in measures of adaptive behavior (see SI Appen-
dix, SI Discussion for details).
The results in Fig. 2 A–D support the view that theta phase
coupling mediates an MFC–right–lPFC interaction critical to
components of adaptive control and learning. However, to pro-
vide a more rigorous quantification of the long-range theta dy-
namics underlying adaptive behavior, we performed single-trial
regression analyses. As illustrated in Fig. 2E, at baseline, one-
sample t tests of the individual standardized β-weights revealed
that peak theta phase coupling between MFC (i.e., FCz) and
right lPFC (i.e., F6) after error feedback predicted greater
posterror accuracy (i.e., smaller error magnitude on the trial
after error feedback; t29 = 3.277; P < 0.01). The effect was right
lateralized. Theta phase coupling across the left hemisphere (i.e.,
from FCz to F5) did not predict single-trial fluctuations in
posterror accuracy (t29 = 0.782; P = 0.441). Critically, antiphase/
inphase stimulation weakened/strengthened, respectively, the
single-trial relationships between right-lateralized theta phase
coupling and posterror accuracy, while having no effect on
connectivity–behavior relationships involving the left hemisphere
[stimulation × hemisphere interaction, F(2, 58) = 6.953; P < 0.01].
Parsing this interaction revealed that after antiphase stimulation,
β-weights related to FCz-F6 connectivity–behavior correlations
were no longer significant (t29 = 1.259; P = 0.218) and signifi-
cantly reduced relative to sham (t29 = 2.203; P = 0.036), whereas
after inphase stimulation, β-weights were highly significant (t29 =
6.237; P < 0.01) and enhanced relative to sham (t29 = 2.824; P <
0.01). Thus, by applying multifocal alternating current to MFC
and right lPFC, it appeared we could causally manipulate the
connectivity underlying aspects of adaptive behavioral control in
a bidirectional and selective manner at the single-trial level.
Experiment 2. The results from Experiment 1 offer a striking
demonstration for how high-resolution neuromodulation can be
used to isolate and augment right-lateralized MFC-lPFC theta
connectivity, with bidirectional effects on adaptive behavior
based on the phase angle of the alternating current used. Next,
we asked whether the same was true for left-hemisphere theta
connectivity. Based on the lateralized nature of the single-trial
brain–behavior correlations observed at baseline (Fig. 2E), and
previous reports of right-lateralized feedback-related theta rhythms
during reward processing, feedback learning, and action adjust-
ments (23–26), we hypothesized that MFC–right–lPFC connec-
tivity would be preferentially used in the causal implementation
of flexible learning behavior, whereas MFC–left–lPFC connec-
tivity would not directly influence cognitive performance. Of
note, little is known about the nature of the theta dynamics that
link MFC to different hemispheres of the lPFC and whether
these different spatial streams of theta connectivity across the
cerebral hemispheres serve different functions necessary for
adaptive behavior and learning. In brief, we found that we could
synchronize or desynchronize the theta rhythms over MFC and
left lPFC according to the timing of the alternating current ap-
plied over these regions, paralleling the electrophysiological re-
sults from Experiment 1, using right-lateralized stimulation.
However, surprisingly, this causal manipulation had no effect on
behavior (see SI Appendix, SI Results and Fig. S1 for details). The
findings across Experiments 1 and 2 suggest a functional asym-
metry in frontal cortex, whereby left-lateralized theta connec-
tivity, although potentially involved in the communication of the
adjusted action plan, does not appear to function like right-
lateralized connectivity in bringing about the actual imple-
mentation of the flexible behavior. These results are consistent
with neuroimaging studies suggesting a dominant role for right
lPFC in cognitive action control (27, 28), but future work is
needed to clarify the functional relevance of left-lateralized theta
connectivity, which may be revealed using tasks that elicit greater
left-hemisphere synchronization, such as those involving positive
affect or linguistic processing (see SI Appendix, SI Discussion for
additional information).
Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, we sought a more rigorous dem-
onstration of causal control over adaptive human behavior with
greater potential real-world and clinical applicability. We asked
whether it was possible to pit the opposing causal effects of the
stimulation protocols we developed in Experiment 1 against each
other. Specifically, could we use antiphase HD-tACS to induce
performance deficits, and then immediately rescue behavior us-
ing inphase stimulation? Various forms of frontal cortical dys-
connectivity and maladaptive control are consistently observed in
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (9, 29, 30), and thus
efforts to build novel drug-free tools for restoring neurocognitive
function and behavior have important implications for human
health and disease.
In Experiment 3, all subjects underwent two different test
days, each with three consecutive stimulation sessions adminis-
tered while subjects performed the time-estimation task (Fig.
3A). On one test day, subjects received a sequence of sham,
antiphase, and inphase stimulation, whereas on another day, the
same subjects received three consecutive sham stimulation ses-
sions. The order of active and sham test days were counter-
balanced across subjects (see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods
for details).
The results from Experiment 3 showed that we could not only
replicate the behavioral results from Experiment 1, using anti-
phase stimulation, but that the inphase protocol could correct all
antiphase induced behavioral deficits and instantly return sub-
jects’ performance to baseline levels in less than 20 min. Con-
sistent with Experiment 1 (Fig. 2A), antiphase stimulation
increased error magnitude [F(1, 29) = 19.150; P < 0.01] and re-
sponse variability [F(1, 29) = 21.540; P < 0.01] and decreased
adjustment efficiency [F(1, 29) = 14.621; P < 0.01] compared with
the chronologically equivalent session on the sham test day (Fig.
3B). Surprisingly, after three blocks (i.e., ∼18 min) of inphase
stimulation, all performance deficits were effectively normalized,
such that measures of error magnitude [F(1, 29) = 0.332; P =
0.569], response variability [F(1, 29) = 0.181; P = 0.673], and
adjustment efficiency [F(1, 29) = 0.730; P = 0.400] recorded from
blocks 4–8 were statistically indistinguishable from the chrono-
logically equivalent sham session. Experiment 3 demonstrated
the plasticity of a phase-sensitive mechanism in frontal cortex
and how neuromodulation technology could exploit this mech-
anism’s plasticity to disrupt and then rapidly repair adaptive
control and learning in the same individuals. The results
suggest that functionally relevant adult brain plasticity can be
augmented on the timescale of minutes with an immediate
effect on adaptive behavior.
To test whether the behavioral effects of Experiment 3 could
be a result of fluctuations in baseline behavior across days, cre-
ating a potential confound in the results related to the electrical
brain stimulation, we performed test–retest reliability analyses by
comparing data during the first sham sessions across days. For
this analysis, we compared error magnitude, response variability,
and adjustment efficiency data collected during the first session
of each test day in which sham stimulation was administered
(Fig. 3B, first session, blocks 1–8, solid vs. dashed black lines). We
found evidence of successful learning exhibited by significant
feedback × time interactions [Fs(3,
87) > 5.734; Ps < 0.01].
However, critically, no main effects of test day [Fs(1, 29) < 0.027;

 Ps > 0.872] or interactions involving test day [Fs(3, 87) < 0.585;
Ps > 0.596] were observed. In addition, individual behavioral
values in these sham conditions across test days were significantly
correlated (Spearman’s rhos > 0.621; Ps < 0.01). The results
indicate that the primary performance metrics on this classic
time estimation task were rather stable over a period of ap-
proximately 1 wk (average time between testing, 8.3 ± 2.5 d) and
further strengthen confidence in the validity of the stimulation-
induced behavioral results obtained across Experiments 1–3.
In Experiment 3, we found that inphase stimulation could
recover adaptive behavior that was artificially impaired, using
antiphase stimulation. We based this interpretation on the ob-
servation that subjects’ measures of adaptive control and learn-
ing improved after inphase stimulation, eventually returning to
baseline sham levels of performance. However, it is also possible
that inphase stimulation had no effect and the behavioral mea-
sures simply improved on their own as a function of time and
further practice on the task, as the deleterious effects of anti-
phase stimulation gradually wore off. To test this alternative
hypothesis, we invited back all 30 participants from Experiment
3 to participate in an additional test day in which we applied the
sequence of sham, antiphase, and sham stimulation. On the basis
of data from the 19 subjects who returned, we found that the
impairments induced by antiphase stimulation were not naturally
resolved with time and further practice, but continued through-
out the full sham session after antiphase stimulation (Fig. 3B,
third session, solid black lines). This was demonstrated by signif-
icant effects of stimulation, increasing error magnitude [F(1, 18) =
14.217; P < 0.01] and response variability [F(1, 18) = 20.719; P <
0.01], and decreasing adjustment efficiency [F(1, 18) = 13.642; P <
0.01] in the sham session after an antiphase session (Fig. 3B, third
session, solid black lines), relative to the sham session after a
sham session (Fig. 3B, third session, dashed black lines). These
results are consistent with the enduring impairments we ob-
served in Experiment 1 after antiphase stimulation (Fig. 2A) and
support the interpretation that by reversing the relative phase
difference of HD-tACS applied over MFC and right lPFC, we
could effectively rescue impaired adaptive control in healthy
individuals.
Discussion
Here, we provide evidence for a causal relation between inter-
areal theta phase synchronization in frontal cortex and multiple
components of adaptive human behavior. The results support the
idea that the precise timing of rhythmic population activity
spatially distributed in frontal cortex conveys information to di-
rect behavior (31–35). Given previous work showing that phase
synchronization can change spike time-dependent plasticity (35–
37), together with our findings showing stimulation effects on
neural activity and behavior can outlast a 20-min period of
electrical stimulation (Fig. 2A), it is reasonable to suppose that
the externally modulated interareal coupling changed behavior
by causing neuroplastic modifications in functional connectivity.
That is, the results suggest the striking conclusion that we may be
able to noninvasively intervene in the temporal coupling of dis-
tant rhythmic activity in the human brain to optimize (or im-
pede) the postsynaptic effect of spikes from one area on the
other, improving (or impairing) the cross-area communication
necessary for cognitive action control and learning (see SI
Appendix, SI Discussion for additional theorizing). Moreover,

Experiment 3 received the sequence of sham, antiphase, and sham stimulation to determine whether the deleterious effects of antiphase stimulation would

 these neuroplastic alterations in functional connectivity were
induced with a 0° phase, suggesting that inducing synchroni-
zation does not require a meticulous accounting of the com-
munication delay between regions such as MFC and lPFC to
effectively modify behavior and learning. This finding conforms
to empirical and modeling work showing that despite long axonal
conduction delays between distant brain areas, theta phase syn-
chronizations at 0° phase lag can occur between these regions
and underlie meaningful functions of cognition and action (35,
38, 39). It is also possible that a third subcortical or posterior
region with a nonzero time lag interacted with these two frontal
areas to drive changes in goal-directed behavior.
Finally, the results showing that patterns of synchronization in
frontal cortex can be exogenously isolated and enhanced are
potentially relevant to the understanding and treatment of brain
disorders associated with cortical hypoconnectivity, such as
Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and schizophrenia (8, 9), whereas
the results showing that synchronization can be effectively re-
duced might be useful in addressing the hyperconnectivity im-
pairments observed in disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s
disease (9). Future work is needed in basic and clinical science to
determine the true applicability of the HD-tACS protocols as
potential therapeutic tools. This includes more fully investigating
the effects of stimulation on other components of executive func-
tion, tracking the full time course of the neural and behavioral gains
and losses associated with each protocol, and determining whether
the effects can be prolonged and made more potent by modifying
stimulation parameters, such as stimulation duration and intensity,
repeated stimulation sessions, and the pairing of stimulation with
cognitive training. The potential seems high for capitalizing on
the experience-dependent plasticity underlying training- and
stimulation-induced cognitive enhancement and for maximizing
intervention strategies to rescue cognitive functions in patient
populations.
Materials and Methods
Materials and methods used in this study are discussed in SI Appendix, SI
Materials and Methods. Briefly, all participants gave written informed con-
sent approved by the Boston University Institutional Review Board and were
paid. All experiments were within-subjects, sham-controlled, and double
blind, in which subjects received 20 min of HD-tACS while performing a time
estimation task (Fig. 1B). Subjects’ EEG was continuously recorded (2,048-Hz
sampling rate, 0.05–200-Hz bandpass filter) while they performed this task.
The
electrophysiological
and
behavioral
data
were
analyzed
offline.
Debriefing questions confirmed that subjects were blind to the nature of the
stimulation conditions.
