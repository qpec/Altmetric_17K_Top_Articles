Abstract
Background: It is unclear whether emergency weekend colon and rectal cancer surgery are associated with worse outcomes (ie, weekend 
effect) because previous studies mostly used administrative data, which may insufficiently adjust for case-mix. Materials and Methods: Pro-
spectively collected data from the 2012–2015 Dutch ColoRectal Audit (n=5,224) was used to examine differences in 30-day mortality and 
severe complication and failure-to-rescue rates for emergency weekend (Saturday and Sunday) versus Monday surgery, stratified for colon 
and rectal cancer. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, American Society of Anesthesiologists 
classification score, tumor stage, presence of metastasis, preoperative complication, additional resection for metastasis or locally advanced 
tumor, location primary colon tumor, type of rectal surgery (lower anterior resection or abdominal perineal resection), and type of neo-
adjuvant therapy (short-course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy). Results: A total of 5,052 patients undergoing colon cancer surgery 
and 172 undergoing rectal cancer surgery were included. Patients undergoing colon or rectal cancer surgery during weekends had signifi-
cantly more preoperative tumor complications compared with those undergoing surgery on a weekday. Additionally, differences in year 
of surgery and location of primary tumor were found for colon cancer surgery. Emergency colon cancer surgery during the weekend was 
associated with increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.10–2.50) and severe complications (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.63) 
compared with surgery on Monday. Estimates for emergency weekend rectal cancer surgery were similar but not statistically significant, 
likely explained by small numbers. Conclusions: Weekend emergency colon cancer surgery was associated with higher mortality and severe 
complication rates. More research is needed to understand which factors explain and contribute to these differences.

Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently diagnosed can-
cer for which surgery has a crucial role in treatment. 
Unfortunately, surgery also carries considerable risks 
of postoperative complications and mortality.1,2 There

colon surgery,5,6 whereas patient characteristics, 
complication risks, and clinical outcomes are clearly 
different for colon and rectal cancers.9 
 Another important limitation of most previous 
studies on the weekend effect, regardless of the di-
agnosis, is the use of administrative data. Adminis-
trative data can reflect inaccurate coding,10 but also 
often lack necessary information to adjust for the dif-
ferent case-mix using clinical variables.11,12 As a re-
sult, whether the weekend effect is merely a product 
of the selection of worst cases presenting during the 
weekend or is caused by other factors related to the 
quality of care delivered on weekends remains un-
clear. However, when restricting to emergency cases, 
such selection is less likely to occur on weekends and 
not (during out-of-office hours) on weekdays. Due to 
these matters, there is an increasing demand for pop-
ulation-based data from clinical audits because these 
may provide the necessary clinical data for case-mix 
adjustment. The Dutch ColoRectal Audit (DCRA), 
previously known as the Dutch Surgical Colorectal 
Audit, is a nationwide clinical audit in the Neth-
erlands with the objective to measure and improve 
quality of CRC surgery. It registers detailed clinical 
data to enable case-mix adjustment to make valid 
comparisons of outcomes of different providers.13 
The aim of the current study, therefore, was to 
investigate whether there is a weekend effect after 
emergency colon and rectal cancer surgery using 
data from the DCRA. 
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Setting
Data were prospectively collected from the DCRA, 
a nationwide quality improvement audit initiated in 
2009. All Dutch hospitals (n=88) performing CRC 
surgery participate in the DCRA. The DCRA is a 
disease-specific audit and contains a wide range of 
variables with specific information regarding patient 
and tumor characteristics, diagnostics, treatment, 
complications, and mortality. A more detailed de-
scription of the DCRA is published elsewhere.13,14 
Study Population
All nonelective patients (n=5,246) registered in 
the DCRA for surgical resection of primary CRC 
in the period from 2012 until 2015 were included. 
Patients with synchronous tumors, treated with the 
“wait-and-see” approach, who underwent proce-
dures solely performed through transanal endoscopic 
microsurgery, and without information on date of 
surgery, mortality, or location of the primary tumor 
were excluded (n=22). Elective resections were ex-
cluded because weekend elective surgery is not com-
mon practice in the Netherlands, and therefore any 
surgeries performed during the weekend were likely 
to be a specific selection of patients giving rise to 
treatment by indication bias. The study protocol was 
presented to the Medical Ethical Committee of the 
Leiden University Medical Center, which declared 
that no ethical approval was necessary for this type 
of study under Dutch law and waived the need for 
informed written consent from patients (P16.243).
Data and Definitions 
Previous studies varied regarding whether day of 
admission or day of surgery was used to define the 
weekend; we used day of surgery to define the week-
end (Saturday and Sunday). A more precise period 
(eg, including evening or nights) could not be given 
because no specific information on time of surgery 
was available. 
Outcome measures were mortality, severe com-
plication, and failure to rescue (FTR). Mortality was 
defined as postoperative death in the hospital dur-
ing the same admission or within 30 days after resec-
tion. Severe complication was defined as any postop-
erative complication leading to a prolonged hospital 
stay of >14 days, a reintervention, or mortality. FTRs 
were defined as patients with a severe complication 
who died within 30 days after resection or during the 
same hospital admission. These definitions have also 
been used in previous DCRA studies.14–17 
Case-mix variables used to adjust outcomes 
for both colon and rectal cancer surgery were age, 
sex, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, 
American Society of Anesthesiologists classification 
score, presence of metastasis, preoperative complica-
tions, and additional resection for metastasis or lo-
cally advanced tumor. Specific for colon cancer, the 
pathologic tumor stage and location of the prima-
ry tumor were added to the case-mix variables, and 
specific for rectal cancer, the clinical tumor stage, 
type of surgery (low anterior resection or abdominal 
perineal resection), and neoadjuvant therapy (short-
course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) were 
added. These case-mix variables have been previous-

ly identified as relevant for patient outcome and hos-
pital comparisons, and are thus part of the standard 
DCRA case-mix models.14 
Statistical Analysis 
First, patient characteristics were compared between 
weekend and weekday surgery, separately for colon 
and rectal cancer, using chi-square tests. Subsequent-
ly, logistic regression was used to examine whether 
unadjusted and adjusted outcome rates differed be-
tween weekend and weekday surgery. Monday was 
used as reference category. Analyses were adjusted for 
the case-mix variables. Goodness of fit of the adjusted 
models was assessed using C-statistics by calculating 
the area under the receiver operating characteristics 
curve. Results were considered statistically significant 
at P<.05. Statistical analyses were performed using 
SPSS version 23 (IBM Corporation). 
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analyses were performed with all week-
days combined. Furthermore, because hospital care 
during Dutch national holidays is likely similar to 
weekend care, dates listed as national holidays for 
hospitals (n=10) were coded as weekend. Subse-
quently, primary analyses were repeated. 
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 5,224 patients receiving emergency care 
were included in the analyses, with 5,052 (96.7%) 
undergoing colon cancer surgery and 172 (3.3%) 
undergoing rectal cancer surgery. Among emergency 
colon cancer surgery, 4,244 (84.0%) were performed 
during a weekday and 808 (16.0%) during the week-
end. Patients undergoing weekend emergency colon 
cancer surgery more often had preoperative tumor 
complications than weekday surgery patients (Table 
1). Furthermore, the location of the primary tumor 
and year of surgery significantly differed, with rela-
tively more weekend surgeries performed in recent 
years. Among emergency rectal cancer surgeries, 150 
(87.2%) were performed during a weekday and 22 
(12.8%) during the weekend. Preoperative tumor 
complications more often occurred in patients un-
dergoing weekend emergency rectal cancer surgery 
(Table 1). 
Outcomes for Colon and Rectal Cancer Surgery
In emergency colon cancer surgery (Table 2), the 
highest mortality, severe complication, and FTR 
rates were found for weekend surgeries (9.9%, 31.8%, 
and 31.1%, respectively). After adjustment for case-
mix, weekend surgeries had 66% higher mortality 
and 29% higher severe complication rates compared 
with Monday surgeries (Table 2). Estimates for FTR 
were in the same direction but not statistically sig-
nificant, which is likely due to the smaller sample 
size as only complicated cases are included.
In emergency rectal cancer surgery, the highest 
mortality, severe complication, and FTR rates were 
found for weekend surgeries (18.2%, 45.5%, and 
40.0%, respectively). However, no significant differ-
ences were found for weekend surgeries after adjust-
ment for case-mix, even though estimates went in 
the same direction as for colon cancer surgery, likely 
caused by the small numbers (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analysis 
Combining all weekdays showed similar results (data 
not shown). Slight differences in the odds ratios 
(ORs) were observed, but the direction of the as-
sociation remained the same. Coding surgeries per-
formed on a Dutch national holiday as a weekend 
surgery (n=76) also did not influence the results 
(data not shown). 
As a post hoc analysis, we explored whether os-
tomies or anastomoses were more often performed 
during weekend or weekday surgery, because this 
may indicate either a different patient population 
not accounted for by case-mix correction and/or a 
difference in experience of the surgeon performing 
the surgery, and thereby suggest possible explanatory 
or mediating factors. For emergency colon cancer 
surgery, more ostomies were created on the week-
end than on weekdays (43.6% vs 38.8%; P=.018). 
During weekdays, the percentage of anastomoses 
was higher compared with the weekend (55.6% 
vs 50.1%; P=.018). Including this as an additional 
variable (ostomy, anastomosis, or both) in the mul-
tivariate analyses, with having both an ostomy and 
anastomosis as the reference category, resulted in the 
FTR rate being significantly higher after emergency 
weekend colon cancer surgeries (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 
1.04–2.66).

Weekend Effect in Colon and Rectal Cancer Surgery
739
Discussion
The present study has shown higher mortality and 
severe complication rates after emergency colon can-
cer surgery performed during the weekend. Estimates 
for FTR and emergency rectum cancer surgery were 
in the same direction but not statistically significant, 
likely explained by the small sample size. By separat-
ing colon and rectal cancer, we believe that our results 
provide a more complete picture of the occurrence of 
a weekend effect in colorectal surgery and a better 
starting point for further research into explanatory 
factors and quality improvement initiatives. 
Given the worse outcomes seen after emergency 
colon cancer surgery during weekends, it is impor-
tant to better understand the complex mechanism 
that may result in the observed weekend effect. Be-
cause the weekend effect also remained after case-
mix adjustment using clinical variables, we elimi-
nated the possibility that the effect might be caused 
by a case-mix selection, making differences in orga-
nization of perioperative care during weekends seem 
more likely. In an attempt to gain more insight into 
this mechanism, we explored whether having an 
anastomosis or an ostomy might be an explanatory or 
mediating factor, indicating either a specific patient 
group not accounted for in case-mix adjustment and/
or a less experienced surgical team. It can be argued 
that ostomies are less risky to perform and there-
fore more preferred among less specialized surgeons 
who might be on call on some weekends. However, 
the decision-making around ostomies and anasto-
moses is influenced by many other factors, with the 
condition of the patient being the most important, 
which might explain the increased FTR rate when 
this factor was included in the analysis. Therefore, 
it seems far more likely that this effect is the result 
of a complex combination of surgeon specialization 
and patient condition, requiring more research into 
the mechanism behind the observed weekend effect. 
Future studies should shift the focus toward pos-
sible explanatory factors, such as organization of care 
during the weekends compared with weekdays—
not only whether the perioperative period is in the

weekend but also whether care given in the postop-
erative period is during the weekend. Factors sug-
gested to explain the weekend effect are less (expe-
rienced) hospital staff and resources available during 
the weekends.18 This would suggest a broader focus, 
because it should also include delay in diagnosing 
complications and performing reinterventions, rath-
er than only focusing on the initial operation being 
performed in the weekend. For instance, an anasto-
motic leakage, a common serious complication in 
colorectal surgery, is typically diagnosed between 5 
and 8 days after surgery,19 so when this occurs during 
a weekend, it may result in higher FTR rates if not 
detected early enough, even though the primary sur-
gery was performed on Monday or Tuesday. This will 
only be detected when looking specifically at delay 
during weekends in diagnosing complications and/
or performing reinterventions during weekends. One 
study, with a relatively small study population, ob-
served intervening weekends to be a risk factor for 
delay in diagnosing anastomotic leakage and, sub-
sequently, relaparotomy.20 In addition, a study into 
hospital characteristics and the effect on FTR fol-
lowing major surgery suggested that microsystem 
characteristics are likely to be more important in 
managing postoperative complications, because only 
part of the variability between low- and high-mor-
tality hospitals could be explained by macrosystem 
factors such as hospital size.21 Therefore, it might be 
far more complicated than simply having specialized 
surgeons on call 24 hours a day or more beds avail-
able, but rather could be an interplay between avail-
ability of diagnostics, sufficient and experienced staff 
at the wards with the ability to recognize early signs 
of complications, and quick surgical interventions by 
specialized surgeons if needed.
This study has some limitations, one of which 
is that no information was available regarding out-
of-hospital deaths occurring >30 days after surgery. 
However, for this to influence our results, the out-of-
hospital deaths should have followed a different pat-
tern than the included 30-day mortality, which does 
not seem likely. Another limitation may be our lack 
of information on day of admission, making it pos-
sible that weekend surgeries are represented by the 
worst cases and that other slightly less emergent sur-
geries are postponed to Monday. This might suggest 
an overestimation of the weekend effect we found. 
Use of the DCRA in the current study could be con-
sidered a strength, particularly because of the avail-
able clinical variables in contrast to previous studies 
that mostly used administrative data. Previous stud-
ies often report that they were unable to fully adjust 
for the different patient characteristics because of 
the lack of clinical data indicating a different case-
mix in weekends.18 Our results still show differences 
after adjusting for a broad scale of these clinical case-
mix variables, indicating that the weekend effect 
found in this study may possibly be due to a variation 
in care instead of a selection effect. 
Conclusions
The current study demonstrated worse patient out-
comes after emergency colon cancer surgery performed 
on weekends, reflecting a weekend effect. Future stud-
ies should examine explanatory factors, including dif-
ferences in quality of care during weekends compared 
with weekdays in terms of diagnostic availability, sur-
gical experience, and postoperative care that may af-
fect the detection of early signs of complications.
