Abstract
Background—Douching was recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of urinary 
metabolites of endocrine disrupting phthalates, but there is no literature on douching in relation to 
ovarian cancer. Numerous case-control studies of genital talc use have reported an increased risk 
of ovarian cancer, but prospective cohort studies have not uniformly confirmed this association. 
Behavioral correlation between talc use and douching could produce confounding.
Methods—The Sister Study (2003–2009) enrolled and followed 50,884 women in the US and 
Puerto Rico who had a sister diagnosed with breast cancer. At baseline participants were asked 
about douching and talc use during the previous 12 months. During follow-up (median of 6.6 
years) 154 participants reported a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. We computed adjusted hazard ratios 
(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ovarian cancer risk using the Cox proportional hazards 
model.
Results—There was little association between baseline perineal talc use and subsequent ovarian 
cancer (HR: 0.73 CI: 0.44, 1.2). Douching was more common among talc users (OR: 2.1 CI: 2.0, 
2.3), and douching at baseline was associated with increased subsequent risk of ovarian cancer 
(HR: 1.9 CI: 1.2, 2.8).
Conclusions—Douching but not talc use was associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer in 
the Sister Study.

Introduction
Cancer of the ovary is the most lethal gynecological cancer in women, and its etiologies 
remain poorly understood. In 2015, there were an estimated 21,290 new cases and 14,180 
ovarian cancer deaths among women in the United States (1). Family history of ovarian or 
breast cancer is a major risk factor. Nulliparity is also associated with increased risk of

 ovarian cancer, whereas tubal ligation and oral contraceptive use are reportedly associated 
with reduced risk (2).
Genital talc use and douching could plausibly introduce particles and toxicants into the 
upper reproductive tract and increase the risk of cancers and infections. Talc particles have 
been found embedded in cervical and ovarian tumors (3). Some douching products are 
known to contain phthalates, which disrupt endocrine pathways and could influence ovarian 
cancer risk through hormone disruption (4). A recent analysis of data from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found an association between douching and 
urinary concentrations of phthalates (5). Douching has also been associated with adverse 
health effects and reproductive problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic 
pregnancy (6), as well as decreased fertility (7).
To the best of our knowledge, no existing studies have investigated the association between 
douching and ovarian cancer, but talc use was associated with ovarian cancer in many case-
control studies (8–13). A meta-analysis of 14 population-based, case-control studies (14) 
and a large, pooled case-control analysis (15) both reported positive associations between 
genital talc use (ever vs. never) and ovarian cancer. The only prospective studies to examine 
talc and ovarian cancer (16, 17) found no strong associations overall, but one observed 
increased risk for invasive serous ovarian cancer, specifically (17). In this study we 
investigate the association between ovarian cancer and both douching and talc use, using 
prospective data from the Sister Study cohort.
Methods
The Sister Study, launched in 2003, enrolled 50,884 women across the United States and 
Puerto Rico. Enrollees were aged 35 to 74 years and had never had breast cancer but each 
had a full or half-sister who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. More than one sister per 
family could participate.
After excluding participants who had bilateral oophorectomies (N=9,023) or ovarian cancer 
(N=167) prior to enrollment or who had no follow-up information (N=40), we included 
41,654 participants in this analysis. As of July 2014 (median follow-up 6.5 years), 154 
incident ovarian cancer cases had occurred. We included tumors of the ovary (N=135), 
fallopian tubes (N=7), peritoneum (N=4), or of uncertain origin but likely from one of the 
three aforementioned primary sites (N=8). The Institutional Review Boards of the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Copernicus Group approved this study 
and all participants provided written consent.
Participants completed computer-assisted telephone interviews, which included questions 
about reproductive history (including any oophorectomies), health conditions, and lifestyle 
factors. Participants also completed a self-administered questionnaire about personal care 
products used in the 12 months prior to enrollment, which included questions about 
frequency of douching and about genital talc use in the form of powder or spray applied to a 
sanitary napkin, underwear, diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal area. Response categories 
were: did not use, used less than once a month, used 1–3 times per month, 1–5 times per

 week, or more than 5 times per week. Because most members of the cohort reported not 
douching and not using talc, we used dichotomous use/nonuse variables for analysis.
Updated information on oophorectomies was collected in follow-up questionnaires 
administered every 2–3 years. We ascertained information on any new cancers via an annual 
health update and the follow-up questionnaires and were able to confirm 96 of the ovarian 
cancer cases using medical records (N=87) or death certificate/National Death Index data 
(N=9). For the remaining 58 cases, we relied on information provided by the participant 
herself (N=52) or her next of kin (N=6). Among women with available medical records who 
self-reported ovarian cancer, 90% were confirmed.
There were five eligible cases with an unknown exact age at diagnosis. For them, we 
imputed an age midway between their last ovarian cancer-free follow-up interview and their 
age at the time we were notified of the diagnosis (or death). Although we did not genotype 
women directly for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, we asked each woman in her baseline 
interview whether she had ever been tested and, if so, what the result of those tests were. For 
the purposes of this analysis, a woman was treated as BRCA1/2 mutation positive if 1) she 
had a positive test or 2) she had a sister with a known positive test and she had no known 
negative test.
Statistical Analyses
We computed adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the 
association of talc use and douching with ovarian cancer risk using Cox proportional hazards 
models, with age as the primary time scale. Follow-up lasted from age at baseline until age 
at diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Follow-up time was censored at their age of bilateral 
oophorectomy after baseline, death, or last contact. Because some participants had sisters 
who also enrolled in the cohort, we used generalized estimating equation methods to 
calculate robust variances to account for family clustering. We evaluated proportionality 
assumptions of the Cox model by assessing the improvement in goodness-of-fit provided by 
including an age-by-factor interaction term.
In addition to the main effect, we evaluated the joint effect of both douching and using talc. 
We classified participants into four categories: neither exposure, talc use exclusively, 
douching exclusively, or both exposures. We also carried out a number of stratified analyses. 
We stratified by reproductive factors such as menopausal status, parity, hysterectomy, and 
tubal ligation to explore possible effect modification (10, 13). We tested for differences 
across strata using the p-value for an exposure-by-modifier interaction term.
We selected potential confounders or effect modifiers of the association between ovarian 
cancer and the exposures of interest in this analysis a priori based on assumed causal 
relationships among the covariates (18), and included: patency (yes/no blockage of 
reproductive tract by tubal ligation or hysterectomy), menopausal status (pre- or 
postmenopausal), duration of oral contraceptive use (none, <2 years, 2–<10 years, 10 or 
more years), parity (yes/no), race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or 
other), and body mass index (BMI; <25, 25–29.9, or >30 kg/m2), all of which were fixed at 
baseline levels.

 We conducted six sensitivity analyses. In the first, we restricted to the 96 cases confirmed by 
medical record or death certificate/National Death Index data. For our second sensitivity 
analysis we looked for evidence of etiologic heterogeneity by further restricting this pool to 
medically confirmed cases with serous ovarian cancer (N=49). For our third sensitivity 
analysis, we included all 154 eligible ovarian cancer cases as well as 5 additional cases that 
had unknown ages at diagnosis and pre-baseline oophorectomies (N=159 cases total). We 
did this to examine the influence of our assumptions about the relative timing of their 
oophorectomies versus their ovarian cancer diagnoses. We further examined the influence of 
imputing age at diagnosis in our fourth sensitivity analysis by excluding the 5 cases with 
imputed diagnosis ages but intact ovaries (N=149 cases total). For our fifth sensitivity 
analysis, we excluded participants from families known to carry BRCA mutations (N=347 
exclusions, including 10 cases) since the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer for individuals with 
a BRCA1/2 mutation is substantially higher (19) and the etiology may be different. Lastly, 
we conducted analyses excluding the first year of follow-up, to minimize the possibility that 
symptoms of undiagnosed ovarian cancer were leading participants to use douche or talc. All 
analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and using the Sister 
Study data release version 4.1.
Results
Table 1 summarizes characteristics of cases and non-cases at baseline. Most participants 
were non-Hispanic white (84%), and most were postmenopausal (56%). Women who later 
became cases were somewhat older (mean 57.8 versus 54.8), more often white, and more 
often nulliparous. Cases were also more likely to have a first-degree family history of 
ovarian cancer and more than one first-degree relative with breast cancer. They were also 
more likely to carry a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. While ever/never use of 
oral contraceptive was similar across cases and non-cases, the distribution of duration of use 
differed. More non-cases (26%) than cases (16%) had used oral contraceptive for more than 
10 years. Compared to women who neither douched nor used talc, women who douched 
were more likely to be non-Hispanic black (23% vs. 6%) and to have less than a college 
degree (62% vs. 44%) and women who used talc were more likely to have a BMI over 30 
kg/m2 (41% vs. 25%; eTable).
Douching in the 12 months prior to study enrollment was reported by 13% of non-cases and 
20% of cases (Table 2). Talc use in the 12 months prior to study enrollment was reported by 
14% of non-cases and 12% of cases. Only 7 cases (5%) reported both douching and talc use.
Ever douching during the 12 months prior to study entry was associated with increased 
ovarian cancer risk (adjusted HR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.8; Table 2). By contrast, talc use 
during the 12 months prior to study entry was associated with reduced risk after the same 
confounder adjustments (HR: 0.73 CI: 0.44, 1.2) and there was a negligible change in the 
estimated effect with additional adjustment for douching (HR: 0.70 CI: 0.42, 1.1). We 
observed no proportional hazards assumption violations for any of the examined models.
Douching with no talc use was also associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer 
compared with use of neither talc nor douching (adjusted HR: 1.9 CI: 1.2, 2.9), which is

 similar to the overall effect estimate of douching. There was an inverse association between 
exclusive talc use and ovarian cancer, and a positive association for douching and talc use 
combined (HR: 1.8, CI: 0.81, 3.9). There was no evidence for interaction on a multiplicative 
(p=0.39) or additive (p=0.72) scale.
To explore effect modification, we performed analyses stratified by a number of 
reproductive factors including tubal ligation status, hysterectomy status, menopause status, 
and parity (Figure). We also stratified by patency to see if blockage of access to the ovaries 
by either tubal ligation or hysterectomy might modify the association between ovarian 
cancer and douching or talc use. For all stratifications, there were no modifications of effect 
estimates for either douching or talc use (all heterogeneity p-values >0.05).
HRs for talc use differed little in the first five sensitivity analyses, showing a HR change no 
greater than 0.04. By contrast, exclusion of ovarian cancers without medical record or death 
certificate confirmation (by censoring their follow-up at the reported diagnosis age) 
attenuated the association between douching and ovarian cancer (HR: 1.1, CI: 0.62, 2.1). 
Likewise, restriction to medically confirmed serous ovarian cancer also attenuated effect 
estimates (HR: 1.4 CI: 0.64, 3.2). However, ovarian cancer cases who had reported that they 
douched were substantially less likely to have a medical record available (40%) than ovarian 
cases who did not douche (69%), suggesting that medical records were informatively 
missing, biasing results based on the restricted analysis. There was very little change in 
douching effect estimates when excluding the five cases with uncertain diagnosis dates or 
including the five women reporting oophorectomies before the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. 
Exclusion of known positive BRCA1/2 families slightly strengthened the association 
between douching and ovarian cancer (HR: 1.9, CI: 1.3, 2.9). In our sixth sensitivity 
analysis, exclusion of the first year of follow-up time resulted in negligible changes in the 
HRs for douching and talc use (HR: 1.8, CI: 1.2, 2.8 and HR: 0.86, CI: 0.52, 1.4 
respectively).
Discussion
In this large prospective cohort, which gave rise to 154 incident cases of ovarian cancer, 
there was a positive association between douching and incident ovarian cancer. Talc use was 
associated with a slight reduction of ovarian cancer risk. Our study of ovarian cancer 
grouped together all cancers designated as ovarian (88%), fallopian (5%), peritoneal (3%), 
or those designated as uncertain but either ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal (5%). With recent 
literature suggesting that most cancers classified as ovarian likely originated in the fallopian 
tubes (20), we felt that this grouping was appropriate.
Interest in talc as a carcinogen arose because of its chemical similarity to asbestos, which 
has been previously linked to ovarian cancer (21). One challenge with studying talc is that 
the chemical formulation of talc has changed over time (9), and not all powders contain the 
mineral talc (e.g. cornstarch-based products). Previous case-control studies have noted 
evidence for a positive association (8–13), with some evidence that the effect is strongest in 
premenopausal women (13). Given these results, the biological plausibility, the rarity of the 
exposure, and imprecision of estimates, we cannot exclude a small increase in risk

 associated with talc use, despite our inverse findings. Then again, with the exception of the 
finding that talc use was positively associated with serous ovarian cancer in the Nurses’ 
Health Study (17), the prospective studies have not provided evidence supporting an 
association between talc use and ovarian cancer overall (17) or between talc use and ovarian 
cancer overall among post-menopausal women (16).
The numbers for the Sister Study as a whole given in Table 2 reveal an odds ratio of 2.1 (CI: 
2.0, 2.3) for douching in relation to talc use. Thus, the two practices are correlated. If 
douching is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, some of the earlier reports on talc could have 
been subject to confounding bias. However, the one case-control study that did include 
douching as a covariate still observed a positive association between talc use and ovarian 
cancer risk (8). Another factor that may contribute to our null findings is that we categorized 
the exposure based on the 12 months prior to enrollment as a dichotomous ever/never factor 
rather than a quantitative measure of total applications, as has been done in previous studies.
Because Sister Study participants all have a first-degree family history of breast cancer, they 
are more likely than the general population to develop ovarian cancer (estimated observed/
expected number of cases = 1.6 based on SEER rates). We also note that, by design, we 
excluded women with a previous history of breast cancer, thereby discounting some 
individuals who were at increased risk for ovarian cancer. While these selective factors may 
limit generalizability, there is no clear mechanism by which they would bias the estimated 
effect of talc use or douching on ovarian cancer.
Our review of the literature suggests that our study is the first to examine the association 
between douching and ovarian cancer. This association could reflect uncontrolled 
confounding by behavioral factors we have not captured well. For example, women may be 
more likely to douche if they are prone to infections or other reproductive health problems 
that could themselves be related to ovarian cancer.
If the association is causal, it could be related to the recently reported positive association 
between douching and higher urinary levels of phthalate metabolites observed in National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants (5). Phthalates are endocrine-
disrupting chemicals and may be harmful to the fallopian tubes or the ovaries (22). In an 
animal study, exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at 500 and 2,000 mg/kg demonstrated 
ovarian toxicity through decreased progesterone and increased apoptosis in granulosa cells 
(23). Further, ovarian cancer cell lines have been found to increase cell proliferation and to 
up-regulate cell-cycle regulatory genes following treatment with di-n-butyl phthalate (24). 
We did not collect detailed information about specific products used in douching, so we are 
unable to estimate exposure to individual phthalates.
Douching could also force tissue, menstrual fluids, or foreign materials up the reproductive 
tract, resulting in inflammation (e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease (6)) or infection of the 
fallopian tubes or ovaries themselves. This inflammation and infection could also contribute 
to ovarian cancer risk, as supported by the observed positive association between pelvic 
inflammatory disease and ovarian cancer (25).

 If the association is causal and related to the transfer of xenobiotics into the upper 
reproductive tract, we would expect to see a stronger association in women with both a 
uterus and patent fallopian tubes. However, the evidence in our data appeared to be driven by 
the subcohort of women with hysterectomy and/or tubal ligation (Figure).
Since our study was prospective in nature, it is robust to potential differential reporting bias 
as exposures are recorded prior to development of cancer. Another important strength of the 
study was that we controlled for many potentially confounding factors.
An important limitation of our study is that we collected douching and talc information on 
individuals for the year prior to study entry and have not accounted for the latency of ovarian 
cancer, which is likely to be long (26). If latency is 15 to 20 years, douching habits at 
baseline do not accurately reflect the period of risk, although women who douched at 
baseline are likely to have been douching for a substantial amount of time before that as 
well. Also, given that there have been health advisories against douching because of its other 
potential risks, participants who douched in the past may have stopped douching and would 
be misclassified. Thus, the relative risk for douching in relation to ovarian cancer could be 
underestimated. Future studies that ascertain a complete history of douching are warranted.
Although the baseline questionnaire did ask women about their use of douche and talc 
between the ages 10 and 13, very few women responded yes to douching (2%), and we were 
unable to make use of those data. By contrast, talc use during ages 10–13 had a prevalence 
of 18% in the cohort, but there was no detectable effect of pre-pubertal talc use on risk (HR: 
1.1 CI: 0.74, 1.7).
Exposure information was very complete, with only 832 participants (2%) missing the 
personal care products questionnaire entirely, and an additional 655 and 1,188 missing data 
for the questions about douching or talc use, respectively. However, for approximately 37% 
of cases we have not yet received medical records to confirm the diagnosis. We found that 
medical record retrieval was differential by exposure, with a lower proportion with medical 
records among women who douched than among women who did not. This informative 
missingness mathematically contributed to the substantial attenuation in the HR estimate for 
the association between vaginal douching and ovarian cancer when we restricted to cases 
with medical record confirmation. Medical record retrieval for ovarian cancer began only 
recently, and women with cancers diagnosed early in follow-up are more likely to be missing 
medical record information. Some of the unconfirmed diagnoses may be confirmed later via 
medical records or the National Death Index.
In this large, prospective study, we did not observe an association between recent talc use 
and ovarian cancer risk, but did find a strong positive association between douching and 
ovarian cancer risk.
