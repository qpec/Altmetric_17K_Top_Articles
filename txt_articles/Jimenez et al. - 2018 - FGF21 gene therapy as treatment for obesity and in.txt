Abstract
Prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity is increasing world-
wide. Currently available therapies are not suited for all patients in
the heterogeneous obese/T2D population, hence the need for novel
treatments. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is considered a
promising therapeutic agent for T2D/obesity. Native FGF21 has,
however, poor pharmacokinetic properties, making gene therapy
an attractive strategy to achieve sustained circulating levels of this
protein. Here, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) were used to
genetically engineer liver, adipose tissue, or skeletal muscle to
secrete FGF21. Treatment of animals under long-term high-fat diet
feeding or of ob/ob mice resulted in marked reductions in body
weight, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation, hepatic
steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, and insulin resistance for
> 1 year. This therapeutic effect was achieved in the absence of
side effects despite continuously elevated serum FGF21. Further-
more, FGF21 overproduction in healthy animals fed a standard diet
prevented the increase in weight and insulin resistance associated
with aging. Our study underscores the potential of FGF21 gene
therapy to treat obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D.

Introduction
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is growing at an alarming
rate, and T2D has become a major health problem worldwide. T2D
and insulin resistance are very strongly associated with obesity,
whose prevalence is also increasing (So & Leung, 2016). Obesity
increases the risk of mortality (Peeters et al, 2003) and is also a very
significant risk factor for heart disease, immune dysfunction, hyper-
tension, arthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, and certain types of
cancer (Spiegelman & Hotamisligil, 1993; Whitmer, 2007; Roberts
et al, 2010). Lifestyle intervention and conventional pharmacologic
treatments have proven effective for many obese and T2D patients.
However, these therapeutic options are not successful in all cases
and are not exempt of undesirable side effects. Hence, there is a
medical need for novel, well-tolerated treatments for the large and
heterogenous population of obese/T2D patients.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has recently emerged as a
promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of obesity and T2D
(Kharitonenkov & DiMarchi, 2017). This peptide hormone is
secreted by several organs and can act on multiple tissues to regu-
late energy homeostasis (Potthoff et al, 2012; Fisher & Maratos-
Flier, 2016). One of the main secretors of FGF21 is the liver (Markan
et al, 2014). FGF21 binds specifically to the FGF receptors (FGFR)
and needs b-Klotho as an obligate co-receptor (Fisher & Maratos-
Flier, 2016). The administration of recombinant FGF21 protein to
ob/ob, db/db, or high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice or to obese Zucker
diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats promotes a robust reduction in adiposity,
lowers blood glucose and triglycerides, and improves insulin sensi-
tivity (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005; Coskun et al, 2008; Berglund
et al, 2009; Xu et al, 2009a; Adams et al, 2012a,b). Similarly, liver-
specific overexpression of FGF21 in transgenic mice protects
animals
from
diet-induced
obesity
and
insulin
resistance
(Kharitonenkov et al, 2005; Inagaki et al, 2007). Moreover, the

 administration of FGF21 to obese diabetic rhesus monkeys markedly
reduces fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels and
induces a small but significant loss of body weight (Kharitonenkov
et al, 2007).
The native FGF21 protein has, however, poor pharmacokinetic
properties, including a short half-life (ranging from 0.5 to 2 h), in
part because of increased glomerular filtration in the kidney due to
its small size (~22 kDa), and susceptibility to in vivo proteolytic
degradation and in vitro aggregation (Zhang & Li, 2015; So & Leung,
2016). The pharmaceutical industry is devoting considerable efforts
to overcoming these limitations and improving the yield of produc-
tion of FGF21 analogues or mimetics to enable the development of
potential drug products (Zhang & Li, 2015; So & Leung, 2016). These
FGF21-class molecules have been reported to have similar therapeu-
tic efficacy than the native FGF21 protein in small and large animal
models of obesity and T2D (Foltz et al, 2012; Hecht et al, 2012;
Adams et al, 2013; Talukdar et al, 2016; Stanislaus et al, 2017).
Indeed, first-generation FGF21 analogues have already reached the
clinical stage, and reports from two phase I clinical trials have
shown significant improvement of dyslipidemia, slight body weight
loss, and reductions in fasting insulinemia in patients with obesity
and T2D (Gaich et al, 2013; Talukdar et al, 2016). Thus, preclinical
evidence and clinical evidence corroborate that FGF21 may be an
attractive candidate to combat obesity and TD2.
Despite the pharmacokinetic improvements, FGF21 analogues/
mimetics
require
periodic
administrations
to
mediate
clinical
benefit, which may not only be uncomfortable for patients and
compromise treatment compliance but may also raise immuno-
logical issues associated with the administration of exogenous
proteins (Gaich et al, 2013; Talukdar et al, 2016; Kim et al,
2017). Here, we took advantage of adeno-associated viral (AAV)
vectors and their ability to mediate multi-year production of
therapeutic proteins (Mingozzi & High, 2011; Naldini, 2015) to
develop a gene therapy strategy for obesity and T2D based on
FGF21 gene transfer to the liver, adipose tissue, or skeletal
muscle. AAV vectors, derived from non-pathogenic viruses, are
predominantly non-integrative vectors that persist for years as
episomes in the nucleus of non-dividing cells (Lisowski et al,
2015; Wolf et al, 2015). Multiple studies have reported high
transduction efficiencies for in vivo gene transfer with these
vectors, as well as excellent safety profiles in clinical studies
(Mingozzi & High, 2011; Naldini, 2015). In particular, studies in
large animal models (Rivera et al, 2005; Niemeyer et al, 2009;
Callejas et al, 2013; Bainbridge et al, 2015), as well as clinical
studies (Hauswirth et al, 2008; Maguire et al, 2008; Simonelli
et al, 2010; Buchlis et al, 2012; Jacobson et al, 2012; Gaudet
et al, 2013; Testa et al, 2013; Nathwani et al, 2014; Bainbridge
et al, 2015), have provided strong evidence of AAV-mediated
long-term expression for a variety of therapeutic proteins in the
absence
of
clinically
significant
adverse
events.
Thus,
AAV-
mediated gene therapy can potentially overcome the pharmacoki-
netic limitations of FGF21-class molecules.
Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a single administra-
tion of AAV vectors encoding FGF21 enabled a long-lasting increase
in FGF21 levels in circulation, which resulted in sustained counter-
action of obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance in two
different models of obesity and T2D, the HFD-fed mouse and the
ob/ob mouse. In healthy animals, it prevented age-associated
weight gain and insulin resistance. Our results underscore the
potential of FGF21 gene therapy to treat these conditions.
Results
Persistent reversion of obesity by liver-specific AAV8-mediated
FGF21 overexpression
Two-month-old C57Bl6 mice (“young adults”) were fed either a
chow or a HFD for 10 weeks. During these first 2.5 months of
follow-up, while the weight of chow-fed animals increased by 27%,
animals fed a HFD became obese (72% body weight gain) (Fig 1A).
Obese animals were then administered intravenously (IV) with
1 × 1010 or 5 × 1010 viral genomes (vg) of serotype 8 AAV vectors
encoding a murine optimized FGF21 coding sequence, whose expres-
sion was under the control of the synthetic liver-specific hAAT
promoter (AAV8-hAAT-FGF21). As controls, another cohort of obese
mice and the cohort of chow-fed mice received 5 × 1010 vg of non-
coding null vectors (AAV8-null). Following AAV delivery, mice were
maintained on chow or HFD feeding for about 1 year; that is, up to
16.5 months of age, and body weight and metabolic parameters were
monitored regularly. Animals treated with 1 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-
FGF21 gained as much weight as AAV8-null-injected HFD-fed mice
(Fig 1A). In marked contrast, the cohort of mice treated with
5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 normalized their body weight within
a few weeks of AAV delivery (Fig 1A). Indeed, the mean body
weight of this group of animals became indistinguishable from that
of the chow-fed, AAV8-null-injected cohort for the duration of the
follow-up period (~1 year) (Fig 1A and Appendix Fig S1A).
Having observed the profound effects on body weight exerted by
FGF21 gene transfer to the liver, and taking into account that
obesity and T2D are pathologies associated with aging, we set out
another study in which animals began HFD feeding when older, at

 the age of 29 weeks (“adults”). By week 38, older HFD-fed mice had
also become obese, with a mean body weight gain of ~40%
(Fig 1B). Mice were then administered IV with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21
vectors at three different doses: 1 × 1010, 2 × 1010, and 5 × 1010 vg/
mouse. As previously, chow and HFD-fed cohorts injected with
AAV8-hAAT-null vectors (5 × 1010 vg) were used as controls. A
clear dose-dependent loss of body weight was observed in the
groups treated with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21. Similar to the observations
made in younger mice, the lowest dose of vector did not counteract
the weight gain associated with HFD feeding, although the mean
weight of these animals was always lower than that of AAV8-null-
injected HFD-fed mice (Fig 1B). Animals treated with 2 × 1010 vg
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 initially lost 10% of body weight and continued
to progressively lose weight to reach the weight of chow-fed animals
toward the end of the study (~8 months) (Fig 1B and Appendix Fig
S1B). Upon administration of 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21, adult
mice also experienced progressive loss of body weight, which by the
end of the study (16.5 months of age) was similar to the weight
documented before the initiation of the HFD feeding (Fig 1B and
Appendix Fig S1B).
The counteraction of obesity by AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 treatment
was parallel to a dose-dependent decrease in the weight of the main
white adipose tissue (WAT) depots, such as the epididymal
(eWAT), inguinal (iWAT), and retroperitoneal (rWAT) fat pads,
both in animals treated as young adults and in those treated as
adults (Fig 1C and Appendix Fig S1C). The HFD-induced increase in
the weight of the liver was completely normalized by FGF21 gene
transfer at the highest doses of vector used, whereas the weight of
the quadriceps was unchanged by the diet or AAV delivery (Fig 1C
and Appendix Fig S1D).
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated mice of both ages showed specific
overexpression
of
codon-optimized
FGF21
in
the
liver
(Appendix Fig S1E), which resulted in secretion of FGF21 into the
bloodstream in a dose-dependent manner in both groups of mice,
with levels remaining stable for up to 1 year after a single adminis-
tration of the vector (Fig 1D).
Liver overproduction of FGF21 reverses HFD-associated WAT
hypertrophy and inflammation
HFD feeding induces an increase in the size of WAT adipocytes (Sat-
tar
&
Gill,
2014).
Administration
of
FGF21-encoding
vectors
counteracted this increase (Fig 2A). Morphometric analysis of WAT
revealed that the area of white adipocytes of animals treated as
young adults with 1 × 1010 or 5 × 1010 vg of vector and of mice
treated as adults with 2 × 1010 or 5 × 1010 vg of vector was similar
to that of animals fed a chow diet (Fig 2B). In both groups of
FGF21-treated animals, there was a redistribution of the size of
adipocytes,
with
a
greater
proportion
of
smaller
adipocytes
(Appendix Fig S2A). In agreement with the decrease in adiposity
and reversal of WAT hypertrophy, adiponectin and leptin levels
were also normalized in animals treated with highest doses of
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors, irrespective of the age of initiation of
the treatment (Fig 2C and D).
Obesity also causes the inflammation of WAT (Hajer et al, 2008).
Thus, we analyzed inflammation in this tissue through immunos-
taining for the macrophage-specific marker Mac2 and the expression
of
pro-inflammatory
molecules.
While
HFD-fed
mice
showed
increased presence of macrophages, revealed as “crown-like” struc-
tures, in the eWAT, animals treated as young adults or adults with
5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 had no sign of macrophage infiltra-
tion (Fig 2E and Appendix Fig S2B). This was parallel to the normal-
ization in the expression of the macrophage markers F480 and CD68
and of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-1b (Fig 2F–H
and Appendix Fig S2C–E), indicating that FGF21 expression counter-
acted the inflammation of WAT associated with obesity.
FGF21 overproduction by the liver enhances energy expenditure
without inducing browning of subcutaneous WAT
The loss of body weight observed in the animals treated with AAV8-
hAAT-FGF21 vectors was not due to a reduction in food intake.
Weekly measurements of the number of calories consumed per day
revealed that FGF21-treated animals actually ate more than controls
groups
(Fig 3A).
When
indirect
calorimetry
was
performed
2 months after AAV delivery, both mice treated as young adults and
those treated as adults with 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 and fed
a HFD had much higher energy expenditure during the light and
dark cycles than age-matched control groups (Fig 3B). Similar
results were obtained in animals treated as young adults 10 months
after AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 delivery (Appendix Fig S3A).
This observation was in agreement with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-
mediated effects on locomotor activity. In contrast to the hypoactiv-
ity observed in the open-field test in the animals fed a HFD that

 received AAV8-null vectors, mice treated with 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-
hAAT-FGF21 as young adults showed the same degree of sponta-
neous locomotor activity than chow-fed, null-injected animals. As
shown in Fig 3C, 1 year after AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 delivery, treated
animals travelled more distance, rested less time, and spent more
time doing slow and fast movements than untreated HFD-fed
controls.
Given that changes in energy expenditure may reflect changes in
thermogenesis, we evaluated the degree of activation of the brown
adipose tissue (BAT). Both mice treated as young adults and those
treated as adults with 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 showed
decreased lipid deposition in BAT (Fig 3D). The content of UCP1
protein in BAT was increased in a dose-dependent manner in mice
treated with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors as young adults (Fig 3E),
consistent with an increase in non-shivering thermogenesis induced
by FGF21 gene transfer to the liver.
The browning of the subcutaneous WAT, characterized by the
appearance of beige adipocytes, is also associated with increases in
energy expenditure (Harms & Seale, 2013). To evaluate whether
browning was accountable for the enhancement of energy expendi-
ture observed following AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 treatment, histological
evaluation
of
iWAT
was
performed.
In
agreement
with
the
decreased weight of this pad (Fig 1C), the adipocytes of HFD-fed
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated animals were smaller than those of
HFD-fed null-injected animals (Fig 3F). Treatment with AAV8-
hAAT-FGF21 vectors, nevertheless, did not result in increased detec-
tion of multilocular beige adipocytes in iWAT at any of the doses
tested, either in animals treated as young adults or in those treated
as adults (Fig 3F). Accordingly, there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences in the levels of UCP1 protein in iWAT between the
HFD-fed groups (Appendix Fig S3B).
The creatine-driven substrate cycle and sarco/endoplasmic retic-
ulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b (Serca2b)-mediated calcium cycling can
increase thermogenesis in iWAT independently of UCP1 (Kazak
et al, 2015; Ikeda et al, 2017). Higher levels of expression of phos-
phatase orphan 1 (Phospho1), an enzyme involved in the creatine-
driven substrate cycle, were observed in iWAT of HFD-fed mice
treated with 5 × 1010 vg of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 when compared
with age-matched, chow- and HFD-fed control groups (Fig 3G),
suggesting that the activity of the creatine-driven cycle was probably
increased as a result of FGF21 gene transfer. Regarding the calcium
cycling-dependent thermogenic mechanism, no differences in the
expression levels of Serca2b were detected in the iWAT of animals
treated with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors when compared with
chow- or HFD-fed null-treated animals (Appendix Fig S3C). On the
other hand, the iWAT expression of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2),
another enzyme involved in the same cycle, was increased by
HFD feeding in both null- and AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated mice
(Appendix Fig S3C). Altogether, these results suggest that the
calcium cycling-dependent thermogenic mechanism is not involved
in the improvement of whole-body energy homeostasis observed
after AAV-FGF21 treatment.
Reversal of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis by liver
FGF21 overproduction
Histological analysis of the liver showed that all null-treated animals
fed a HFD had marked hepatic steatosis at the time of sacrifice
(Fig 4A–D). In contrast, HFD-fed mice receiving 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-
hAAT-FGF21 as young adults or as adults evidenced reversal of this
pathological deposition of lipids (Fig 4A). These histological find-
ings were parallel to a marked reduction in the total liver triglyc-
eride and cholesterol content of 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-
treated animals (Fig 4B and C). In addition, animals fed a HFD and
treated with 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors when young
adults or adults showed no sign of hepatic inflammation, as
evidenced by the lack of staining for Mac2, which revealed
increased presence of macrophages in the livers of null-treated HFD-
fed mice (Fig 4D). Finally, FGF21 gene transfer to the liver reversed
hepatic fibrosis. While collagen fibers were readily detectable
following PicroSirius Red staining or Masson’s trichrome staining of
liver sections from animals fed a HFD and injected with control null
vectors, they were undetectable in the livers of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-
treated mice (Fig EV1 and Appendix Fig S4). These mice also
showed markedly reduced hepatic expression of collagen 1 (Fig 4E
and F). Altogether, these findings indicated that AAV8-hAAT-FGF21
treatment protected from the development of HFD-induced non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

 Liver overproduction of FGF21 reverses HFD-induced islet
hyperplasia and insulin resistance
Null-treated mice fed a HFD for up to 1 year showed normal fasted
or fed glycemia (Fig 5A), but were hyperinsulinemic (Fig 5B),
suggesting that these mice had developed insulin resistance. In
contrast, HFD-fed mice treated with 5 × 1010 vg of AAV8-hAAT-
FGF21 as young adults or adults were, by the end of the study,
normoglycemic and normoinsulinemic in both fasted and fed condi-
tions (Fig 5A and B). In animals treated as adults, administration of
the 2 × 1010 vg dose also led to normal circulating insulin levels
(Fig 5B). The lowest dose, however, did not significantly reduce
hyperinsulinemia
in
any
group
(Fig 5B).
Moreover,
HFD-fed
animals treated as young adults with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors
showed decreased circulating levels of glucagon compared with
HFD-fed null-treated mice (Fig EV2A).
While AAV8-null-treated mice developed islet hyperplasia as a
consequence of HFD feeding, the b-cell mass of animals treated with
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors (at the doses of 2 × 1010 or 5 × 1010 vg/
mouse) was similar to that of control mice fed a chow diet (Figs 5C
and EV2B). Double immunostaining for insulin and glucagon of
pancreatic sections from HFD-fed AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated mice
showed normal distribution of a- and b-cells in the islets of these
animals, with localization of glucagon-expressing cells in the periph-
ery of the islet and of insulin-expressing cells in the core (Fig EV2C).
To confirm the increased insulin sensitivity of FGF21-treated
animals, an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed
~2 months post-AAV delivery. As expected, feeding with HFD from
the age of 9 or 29 weeks led to a loss of insulin sensitivity in animals
injected with AAV8-null (Fig 5D and E). In contrast, animals adminis-
tered with 5 × 1010 vg of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 as young adults or
adults showed greater insulin sensitivity than their age-matched,
chow-fed controls (Fig 5D and E). Administration of the intermediate
or low dose of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 also improved insulin sensitivity,
irrespective of the age at treatment (Fig 5D and E); the response of
these FGF21-treated cohorts was indistinguishable than that of their
respective chow-fed control groups (Fig 5D and E).
To
evaluate
glucose
tolerance
in
FGF21-treated
mice,
an
intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) (2 g glucose/kg bw)
was
performed
10 weeks
after
AAV
administration.
HFD-fed
animals injected with either null or FGF21-encoding vectors at a
dose of 1 × 1010 vg/mouse were glucose intolerant and showed
markedly increased circulating levels of insulin during the GTT
(Fig 5F and G). In contrast, animals treated with 5 × 1010 vg/mouse
of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 showed improved glucose clearance when
compared to chow-fed control mice (Fig 5F). Insulin levels were
indistinguishable between these two experimental groups (Fig 5G).
These results further confirmed improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-
fed mice treated with 5 × 1010 vg/mouse of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21.

 increased bone resorption, which could cause bone loss (Wei et al,
2012; Wang et al, 2015; Talukdar et al, 2016; Charoenphandhu
et al, 2017; Kim et al, 2017). Given the therapeutic potential of
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, we
evaluated the long-term effects of gene transfer on the bones of the
animals treated with the highest dose of vector. At the time of sacri-
fice (~16.5 months of age), the naso-anal length and the tibial length
were normal in the animals that were administered with AAV8-
hAAT-FGF21 vectors at 9 or 29 weeks of age (Fig EV3A and B). We
then examined bone structure by micro-computed tomography
(lCT). Analysis of the proximal epiphysis of the tibia revealed no
significant differences in the trabecular and cortical bone of mice
fed a HFD and administered with 5 × 1010 vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 in
comparison with age-matched mice treated with null vectors. Specif-
ically, no differences were documented in the bone mineral density
(BMD) (Fig EV3C), bone mineral content (BMC) (Fig EV3D), bone
volume (BV) (Fig EV3E), bone volume/tissue volume ratio (BV/TV)
(Fig EV3F), bone surface/bone volume ratio (BS/BV) (Fig EV3G),
trabecular number (Tb.N) (Fig EV3H), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th)
(Fig EV3I), or trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (Fig EV3J). Similarly,
the analysis of the compact bone at the tibial diaphysis showed no
differences in the BMC, BMD, BV, BV/TV, or BS/BV between the
HFD-fed null-injected or FGF21-treated groups (Fig EV3K–O).
The pathological effects of FGF21 have been reported to be medi-
ated, at least in part, by increased production of insulin-like growth
factor binding protein 1 (IGFPB1) by the liver (Wang et al, 2015). In
agreement with the lack of bone alterations, high-dose AAV8-hAAT-
FGF21 treatment did not lead to an increase in the levels of circulat-
ing IGFBP1 protein in animals treated 12 (young adults) or 6
(adults) months earlier when compared to null-injected HFD-fed
mice (Fig EV3P). Circulating IGF1 levels were also normal in all
experimental groups (Fig EV3Q). Altogether, these results support
the safety for bone tissue of AAV-mediated FGF21 gene transfer to
the liver.
Long-term feeding (> 60 weeks) with a HFD has been associated
with increased incidence of liver neoplasms in C57BL/6J mice (Hill-
Baskin et al, 2009; Nakagawa, 2015). In our study in animals that
initiated the HFD as young adults and maintained it for 60 weeks,
we found liver tumors in 66.7% (6/9) of animals injected with null
vectors. Animals treated with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors were
protected from HFD-induced development of liver neoplasms: 0%
(0/8) of animals treated with the 5 × 1010 vg of FGF21-encoding
vectors showed tumors, and the incidence was 40% (4/10) in the
cohort treated with the lowest dose (1 × 1010 vg). None (0/11) of
the chow-fed mice developed tumors in the same period of time.
Effects of liver overproduction of FGF21 on ob/ob mice
The ob/ob mice are a well-known model of extreme obesity and
insulin resistance (Fellmann et al, 2013). To test the anti-obesogenic
and anti-diabetic effects of FGF21 gene transfer in this animal
model, 8-week-old ob/ob mice were administered IV with either
1 × 1011 or 5 × 1011 vg/mouse of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors.
Ob/ob animals administered with 5 × 1011 vg/mouse of AAV8-null
vectors served as controls. While the body weight of null-injected
ob/ob mice increased significantly during the follow-up of the study
(20 weeks), the body weight of ob/ob animals treated with 5 × 1011
vg AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 decreased ~7% during the first 2 weeks after
AAV administration and remained stable thereafter (Fig 6A and B
and Appendix Fig S5A). Ob/ob mice administered with 1 × 1011 vg
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21
gained
weight
during
the
course
of
the
20 weeks, but significantly less (10% weight gain) than the AAV8-
null-injected
cohort
(50%
weight
gain)
(Fig 6A
and
B
and
Appendix Fig S5A).
Similar to HFD-fed animals, following gene transfer we docu-
mented dose-dependent overexpression of FGF21 specifically in the
liver (Appendix Fig S5B). This led to secretion of the protein into
the bloodstream; similar levels of circulating FGF21 were docu-
mented 2 and 5 months following AAV delivery, demonstrating
stable production of the protein by the engineered liver (Fig 6C).
In agreement with their lower body weight, ob/ob animals over-
expressing FGF21 in the liver showed significantly decreased size of
white adipocytes, particularly those animals treated with 5 × 1011
vg (Fig 6D). This was parallel with a dose-dependent increase in
circulating
adiponectin
levels

inflammation, as evidenced by decreased staining for Mac2 and
expression of F4/80 and TNF-a in eWAT (Appendix Fig S5C–E).
Noticeably, ob/ob mice treated with 5 × 1011 vg showed a remark-
able reduction in “crown-like” structures in eWAT (Appendix Fig
S5C).
While 7-month-old ob/ob mice showed marked hepatic steatosis,
the liver of FGF21-treated ob/ob mice did not show accumulation of
lipids in hepatocytes (Fig 6F). This agreed with a 60% reduction in
the weight of this organ (Appendix Fig S5F and G) as well as with a

 marked reduction in the total liver triglyceride and cholesterol
content (Appendix Fig S5H and I) in ob/ob mice receiving therapeu-
tic vectors. Ob/ob animals treated with both doses of AAV8-hAAT-
FGF21 also showed decreased fed glycemia, and their insulinemia in
the fed state was reduced by ~70% (Fig 6G and H). Treatment with
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 improved insulin sensitivity in comparison with
AAV8-hAAT-null-treated ob/ob mice (Fig 6I), confirming the obser-
vations made in HFD-fed animals.
We evaluated whether the decrease in circulating glucose
levels
observed
in
ob/ob
mice
after
AAV-FGF21
treatment
resulted
from
suppression
of
hepatic
gluconeogenesis
by
measuring
the
expression
by
qPCR
of
phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). No
changes in the expression of these enzymes were observed in
the
liver
of
AAV-FGF21-treated
ob/ob
mice,
except
for
the
animals treated with 1 × 1011 vg of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 that
showed increased PEPCK expression (Appendix Fig S6A and B).
These results suggested that AAV-mediated long-term expression
of FGF21 in the liver, and the subsequent increase in circulating
FGF21, did not lower glucose by inhibiting hepatic glucose
production.
The glucose-lowering effects of FGF21 have also been attributed
to increased glucose uptake by adipocytes and enhanced energy
expenditure (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005; Xu et al, 2009b; Hondares
et al, 2010; Ding et al, 2012; Camacho et al, 2013; Emanuelli et al,
2014; Samms et al, 2015). Thus, we assessed in different pads of
adipose tissue (iWAT, eWAT, and iBAT) the expression of key
components of the glucose uptake machinery by qPCR, such as the
glucose transporters Glut1 and Glut4, the glucose phosphorylating
enzymes hexokinase I and II (HKI and HKI), and UCP1 in the case
of iBAT. In AAV8-FGF21-treated ob/ob mice, the expression of
Glut1 was increased in iWAT and iBAT (Appendix Fig S6C) and that
of Glut4 was increased in eWAT, iWAT, and iBAT (Appendix Fig
S6D). HKI and HKII were upregulated only in iBAT (Appendix Fig
S6E and F). Moreover, UCP1 expression was increased in the iBAT
of ob/ob mice treated with the high dose of AAV8-FGF21 vectors
(Appendix Fig S6G). Altogether, these results suggest that the long-
term amelioration of glycemia observed in ob/ob mice following
treatment with AAV-FGF21 vectors probably results from increased
glucose uptake by white and brown adipocytes and enhanced ther-
mogenesis in iBAT.
Reversion of obesity and insulin resistance by AAV8-mediated
gene transfer of FGF21 to the eWAT of ob/ob mice
To explore whether it was possible to achieve the same degree of
therapeutic benefit through production of FGF21 by another tissue
besides the liver, we engineered the epididymal white adipose tissue
pad by intra-depot administration of FGF21-encoding AAV8 vectors.
Eleven-week-old ob/ob mice received an intra-eWAT injection of
1 × 1010, 5 × 1010, 2 × 1011, or 1 × 1012 vg/mouse of AAV8 in
which murine optimized FGF21 was under the transcriptional
control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter. To avoid expression of the
transgene in other main organs for which AAV8 shows strong
tropism, such as liver and heart (Gao et al, 2002; Zincarelli et al,
2008; Wang et al, 2010), we took advantage of microRNAs (miRs).
Target sequences for miR-122a and miR-1, which selectively detar-
get transgene expression from liver and heart when included into
AAV vectors (Jimenez et al, 2013; Mallol et al, 2017), were added
in tandem repeats of four copies to the 30-UTR of the FGF21 expres-
sion cassette (AAV8-CAG-FGF21-dmiRT). Animals injected with
vectors lacking any coding sequence (AAV8-CAG-null) at a dose of
1 × 1012 vg/mouse were used as controls.
While ob/ob mice injected with null vectors continued to gain
weight during the 14-week follow-up period (~45% weight gain),
there was a clear dose-dependent moderation of the weight gain in
cohorts treated with FGF21-encoding vectors (~25, ~18, ~8% for
doses 1 × 1010, 5 × 1010, 2 × 1011 vg/mouse, respectively, Fig 7A
and B). Moreover, animals injected with the highest dose of AAV8-
CAG-FGF21-dmiRT showed an initial loss of weight of approxi-
mately ~13% and by the end of the experiment had returned to their
initial body weight (Fig 7B).
Gene transfer to the eWAT resulted in a dose-dependent increase
in the levels of FGF21 in serum (Fig 7C). Circulating FGF21 rose
mainly due to expression of the transgene in the eWAT; limited
expression was observed in iWAT and only at the highest doses of
vector used (Fig 7D). In agreement with our previous work
(Jimenez et al, 2013; Mallol et al, 2017), the inclusion of the
microRNA target sequences efficiently prevented expression in heart
and liver; only marginal expression was observed in the liver at the
highest dose used (data not shown).
Similar to the observations made in ob/ob mice in which FGF21
gene transfer was targeted to the liver, ob/ob mice that received

 intra-eWAT injections of AAV8-CAG-FGF21-dmiRT vectors showed
a reduction in the size of white adipocytes of the epididymal pad
(Fig 7E). Circulating adiponectin levels also increased with dose
(Appendix Fig S7A). eWAT inflammation, evaluated through Mac2
staining, was also reduced as a function of the dose of vector, as did
the expression of the macrophage marker F4/80 (Appendix Fig S7B
and C).
The liver of ob/ob mice injected with null vectors or the lowest
dose of AAV8-CAG-FGF21-dmiRT showed accumulation of lipid
droplets in hepatocytes (Fig 7F). The administration of doses of
5 × 1010 vg/mouse or higher of FGF21-encoding vectors completely
prevented the development of hepatic steatosis (Fig 7F), which
correlated with the weight of the organ (Appendix Fig S7D) and its
total triglyceride and cholesterol content (Appendix Fig S7E and F).
Further evidence that the dose of 5 × 1010 vg/mouse represented a
threshold for therapeutic efficacy came from the analysis of
glycemia and insulinemia. While the dose of 1 × 1010 vg/mouse did
not modify the levels of blood glucose in the fed state and only
partially reduced insulin levels, doses of 5 × 1010 vg/mouse and
higher completely normalized glycemia and insulinemia (Fig 7G
and H). Accordingly, the three highest doses of AAV8-CAG-FGF21-
dmiRT injected in the eWAT greatly improved insulin sensitivity in
comparison with AAV8-null-injected ob/ob mice, while the lowest
dose had no effect on the ITT (Fig 7I). Altogether, this study con-
firmed the therapeutic potential of overexpressing FGF21 in adipose
tissue.
The skeletal muscle as a source of circulating FGF21
Skeletal muscle (Skm) is a readily accessible tissue and has been
used to produce secretable therapeutic proteins (Haurigot et al,
2010; Callejas et al, 2013; Jae
´n et al, 2017). To explore whether the
Skm could represent a viable source of circulating FGF21, AAV
vectors of serotype 1, which show a high tropism for Skm (Chao
et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2006; Lisowski et al, 2015), carrying murine
optimized FGF21 under the control of the CMV promoter were used
(AAV1-CMV-FGF21). Vectors were injected at a dose of 5 × 1010 vg/
muscle to the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tibialis cranialis of
both legs (total dose, 3 × 1011 vg/mouse) of 8-week-old C57Bl6
mice. Control animals were injected with AAV1-null vectors at the
same dose. The use of healthy mice fed a standard diet further
allowed us to evaluate the long-term safety of FGF21 gene therapy.
Eleven-month-old animals injected with FGF21-encoding vectors
at 8 weeks of age showed a marked increase in circulating
FGF21 (Fig 8A), which was parallel to high levels of expression of
vector-derived FGF21 in the three injected muscles (Fig 8B). In
agreement with previous reports, this combination of vector sero-
type, promoter, and route of administration did not lead to expres-
sion of the transgene in the liver (Fig 8B).
At the end of the ~10-month follow-up period, mice injected
intramuscularly
with
AAV1-CMV-FGF21
maintained
the
body
weight they had at the initiation of the study and were ~38% slim-
mer than controls, which steadily increased their weight as animals
aged (Fig 8C). While the weight of the muscles was barely affected
by FGF21 gene transfer, the weight of the white and brown depots
as well as the liver was considerably reduced (Fig 8D). Indeed, the
weight of the WAT pads analyzed was reduced by > 50% (Fig 8D).
Moreover, mice treated with AAV1-CMV-FGF21 showed a marked
reduction in the hepatic total triglyceride content (Fig 8E). No
changes in hepatic cholesterol levels were observed (Fig 8F). As
opposed to null-injected animals, animals treated with AAV1-CMV-
FGF21 showed normoglycemia (data not shown) and reduced insu-
linemia when they were approximately 1 year old (Fig 8G). Accord-
ingly, FGF21-treated mice showed markedly improved insulin
sensitivity at the end of the study (Fig 8H). Altogether, this study
demonstrates that administration of AAV vectors that leads to thera-
peutically relevant levels of circulating FGF21 is safe in the long-
term in healthy and may be used to counteract the increase in body
weight and insulin resistance associated with aging.
Discussion
The present work provides the first evidence of long-term counterac-
tion of obesity and insulin resistance upon a one-time administra-
tion of a gene therapy AAV vector encoding FGF21. First, we took
advantage of AAV8 vectors and a liver-specific promoter to overex-
press a codon-optimized FGF21 coding sequence in the liver, the
main tissue from where circulating endogenous FGF21 is derived
(Markan et al, 2014). This resulted in a sustained increase in FGF21
levels in the bloodstream. We demonstrated disease reversal for
> 1 year by the AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 approach in HFD-fed mice—the
model that most closely resembles the metabolic characteristics of
human obesity and insulin resistance—treated either as young
adults or when older than 9 months. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the longest follow-up ever reported for an FGF21-based treat-
ment in HFD-fed mice and demonstrates both the efficacy and the
safety of our therapeutic approach. Remarkably, the efficacy of
FGF21 gene transfer to the liver was confirmed in the genetically
obese ob/ob mouse model. Moreover, gene transfer directly to

 epididymal white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice afforded the same
degree of therapeutic benefit, and administration of FGF21-encoding
AAV vectors to the skeletal muscle counteracted age-associated
body weight gain and insulin resistance.
Intravascular administration of FGF21-coding AAV8 vectors
targeting the liver several weeks after the initiation of feeding with a
HFD led to a dose–response reduction in body weight. Importantly,
once that body weight of HFD-fed obese animals was normalized, it
remained stable for the whole follow-up period and, in the case of
the animals that received the high dose of vector, it never reached
values below the weight at the initiation of the study. The loss of
body weight was parallel to a decrease in the weight of the adipose
tissue pads and in adipocyte size. In agreement with the reduction
in the size of the adipose depots, the levels of the adipokine adipo-
nectin and leptin were normalized, and no WAT inflammation was
detected. Similar observations were described in transgenic mice
overexpressing
FGF21
(Tg-FGF21) (Kharitonenkov
et al,
2005;
Inagaki et al, 2007) and in animals treated pharmacologically with
native FGF21 or FGF21 analogues/mimetics (Coskun et al, 2008;
Berglund et al, 2009; Xu et al, 2009a; Adams et al, 2012a,b; Foltz
et al, 2012; Hecht et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2013; Emanuelli et al,
2014; Zhang & Li, 2015; Markan & Potthoff, 2016; So & Leung, 2016;
Talukdar et al, 2016; BonDurant et al, 2017; Stanislaus et al, 2017).
Importantly, treatment with FGF21 vectors also prevented body
weight gain and adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation in
ob/ob mice.
The clear effect of FGF21 on body weight in HFD-fed treated
animals was observed despite an increase in food intake, in agree-
ment with previous reports (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005; Coskun
et al, 2008; Inagaki et al, 2008; Laeger et al, 2017). Since FGF21 has
been shown to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier (Hsuchou
et al, 2007), and circulating FGF21 levels were increased following
gene transfer, the effect of the treatment on food intake could be the
consequence of a direct effect of FGF21 on the central control of
food intake. Alternatively, FGF21 may have indirectly affected food
intake by increasing energy expenditure in treated animals (vide
infra), who compensate for this increase by eating more.
Possible explanations for the reduction in body weight may be
provided by the increase in energy expenditure and locomotor
activity documented in AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated animals, also
observed
previously
after
pharmacological
FGF21
treatment
(Coskun et al, 2008; Xu et al, 2009a). However, previous studies
have described a decrease in physical activity and in basal core
temperature in both fasted transgenic mice overexpressing murine
FGF21 specifically in the liver under control of the ApoE promoter
(ApoE-mFGF21) and in lean mice fed a ketogenic diet (KD) (Inagaki
et al, 2007; Bookout et al, 2013). This led to the hypothesis that
FGF21 induced torpor. Other studies have reported observations in
agreement with our results and opposed to those reported previ-
ously (Inagaki et al, 2007; Bookout et al, 2013). In a different line of
FGF21 transgenic mice, in which overexpression of human FGF21
was also driven by the ApoE promoter (ApoE-hFGF21), no dif-
ferences in body temperature were observed when mice were fed a
HFD (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005), which suggested that the effects
of FGF21 may be dependent on nutrient context (Solon-Biet et al,
2016). In agreement with this hypothesis, treatment of HFD-fed WT
mice with recombinant FGF21 also augmented body temperature
and physical activity (Coskun et al, 2008; Xu et al, 2009a). We also
observed an increase in locomotor activity following intravascular
administration of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors to HFD-fed mice
which, together with the observations of previous studies argue
against the possibility of FGF21 being a torpor-promoting factor.
The raise in energy expenditure following FGF21 gene transfer
could be the consequence of increased non-shivering thermogenesis
in BAT, as suggested by the reduction in lipid deposition and the
increment in UCP1 protein levels in BAT. This agrees with previ-
ously published data in small animals treated with recombinant
native FGF21 or with FGF21 analogues/mimetics which demon-
strated increased UCP1 in BAT and enhanced energy expenditure as
a consequence of the treatment (Owen et al, 2014; Douris et al,
2015; Samms et al, 2015; Ve
´niant et al, 2015). However, there is
currently controversy on whether FGF21 effects are UCP1 dependent
or not. It has been described that treatment of UCP1 knockout mice
with a long-acting FGF21 analogue increased energy expenditure
despite the lack of UCP1 (Ve
´niant et al, 2015). In contrast, in
another study in UCP1-deficient mice FGF21 failed to increase meta-
bolic rate (Samms et al, 2015). Supporting a UCP1-independent
mechanism, the effects of FGF21 administration to mice have been
reported to be maintained after ablation of iBAT (Camporez et al,
2013; Emanuelli et al, 2014; Bernardo et al, 2015). In these studies,
only the iBAT pad was surgically excised, what may in turn result
in increased compensatory thermogenic activity in the remaining
BAT depots of the animal and/or in increased appearance of ther-
mogenic-competent beige adipocytes in subcutaneous WAT. In
agreement with this possibility, an increase in UCP1 expression and
protein content were detected in the iWAT of mice treated with
FGF21 upon surgical removal of iBAT, compared with the levels
observed in sham-operated FGF21-treated animals (Bernardo et al,
2015). Therefore, we believe it cannot be ruled out that that FGF21
effects on energy expenditure are UCP1-dependent.
An FGF21-mediated induction of UCP1 has also been described
for iWAT (Hondares et al, 2010; Adams et al, 2012a,b; Fisher et al,
2012; Emanuelli et al, 2014; Douris et al, 2015). Nevertheless, in
AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated animals, we did not observe an induc-
tion of browning in iWAT. In agreement with our results, treatment
of HFD-fed mice or obese cynomolgus primates with FGF21 analo-
gues also failed to induce browning of iWAT, but mediated
considerable loss of body weight (Ve
´niant et al, 2015; Talukdar
et al,
2016).
In
addition,
our
results
also
support
the
idea
that FGF21 effects on glucose homeostasis (vide infra) are inde-
pendent
from UCP1 induction
in WAT (Samms
et al, 2015;
Ve
´niant et al, 2015). Altogether, these results indicate that brown-
ing of iWAT is not necessary for FGF21 anti-obesogenic and anti-
diabetic effects.
Two recent studies demonstrated alternative mechanisms by
which the subcutaneous adipose tissue could improve energy home-
ostasis such as the creatine-driven cycle (Kazak et al, 2015) and the
Serca2b-dependent calcium cycling (Ikeda et al, 2017). Treatment
with AAV8-hAAT-FGF21 vectors increased the expression of Phos-
pho1 in iWAT suggesting that UCP1-independent mechanisms may
also contribute to the enhancement of energy expenditure mediated
by treatment with AAV-FGF21 vectors.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and NASH are strongly associ-
ated with insulin resistance and T2D in humans (Kitade et al, 2017)
and constitute main targets in the development of anti-diabetic treat-
ments. In our study, feeding of mice with a HFD for over 10 months

 resulted in increased weight of the liver and marked alteration of its
structure, with presence of large lipid vacuoles and fibrosis in the
liver parenchyma as well as marked inflammation. Liver FGF21
gene therapy led to complete correction of liver alterations, and the
liver of AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated HFD-fed animals resembled that
of mice fed a chow diet. Similar observations were made in ob/ob
mice treated with intravascular AAV8-hAAT-FGF21. Altogether,
these results underscore the potential of FGF21 gene transfer to the
liver to counteract this pro-diabetogenic condition.
As a result of the improvements observed in white and brown
adipose tissues and in liver, both HFD-fed and ob/ob mice treated
with liver-targeted FGF21 gene therapy showed a remarkable
increase in insulin sensitivity, clearly demonstrated by the correc-
tion of hyperinsulinemia and the improved performance in the ITT
and GTT. Noticeably, HFD-fed mice treated with the lowest dose of
vector, which did not prevent weight gain, also showed an improve-
ment in insulin sensitivity, suggesting that not all the positive effects
of FGF21 on glucose metabolism are dependent on weight loss.
Similar effects on glucose homeostasis have previously been
reported in insulin-resistant rodents and in obese diabetic non-
human primates (Kharitonenkov et al, 2007; Berglund et al, 2009;
Hale et al, 2012; Hecht et al, 2012; Ve
´niant et al, 2012; Adams et al,
2013; Camporez et al, 2013; Emanuelli et al, 2014; Charoenphandhu
et al, 2017; Stanislaus et al, 2017). Clinical studies with FGF21
analogues conducted so far, however, have failed to show improve-
ments on glycaemia (Gaich et al, 2013; Talukdar et al, 2016; Kim
et al, 2017), although studies were likely too short to fully repro-
duce observations made in animal models. It remains to be deter-
mined whether gene therapy, which leads to constant production of
the protein and steady circulating levels, can improve glycaemia
and insulin sensitivity in humans.
As an alternative to the liver, we explored the possibility of
using white adipose tissue as a secretory organ for FGF21. The
high secretory capacity of this organ may be exploited for the
development of new gene therapy strategies for diseases in which
supply of the therapeutic agent into the bloodstream is needed for
treatment (Jimenez et al, 2013). Results confirmed that AAV-engi-
neered WAT could act as a pump to secrete FGF21 to the circula-
tion and mediate the same therapeutic efficacy achieved when
targeting the liver. We observed that following intra-eWAT admin-
istration of the highest dose, some of the vector leaked to the
bloodstream and transduced iWAT, although at much lower levels.
Actually, the minimal efficacious dose (5 × 1010 vg/mouse) did
not lead to iWAT transduction, confirming that expression of
FGF21 in this organ is not a requirement for therapeutic effect.
Expression in other potentially important target organs for AAV8
transduction, such as liver and heart, was efficiently prevented by
inclusion of target sequences for microRNAs strongly expressed in
these organs (Shingara et al, 2005; Qiao et al, 2011). Therefore,
WAT is an attractive alternative target site, particularly for patients
not eligible for liver-directed gene transfer because of underlying
hepatic diseases, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. WAT is also an
easily accessible organ and there is the possibility of easy surgical
removal in case of adverse events.
Additionally, we also tested the ability of the skeletal muscle to
produce and secrete FGF21. This study not only confirmed the
skeletal muscle as another possible target organ for FGF21 gene
therapy but also demonstrated a very exciting finding of our work:
that gene transfer of FGF21 to healthy animals fed a chow diet was
safe and could prevent the weight gain and insulin resistance devel-
oped as animals’ age. Although further studies are warranted, this
observation opens the spectrum of potential indications for FGF21
gene therapy, especially for healthy aging.
The potential of FGF21 to treat obesity and insulin resistance has
prompted the pharmaceutical industry to develop a myriad of analo-
gues and mimetics that have the same biological actions than
endogenous
FGF21
but
improved
pharmacokinetic
properties
(Zhang & Li, 2015; So & Leung, 2016). Gene therapy can offer some
advantage over these designed molecules. On the one hand, there is
the possibility of achieving therapeutic levels of a protein following
a single administration of the gene therapy product, with obvious
implications for patient management. Despite the fact that long-
acting FGF21 molecules have been developed, they still require peri-
odic administrations that are inconvenient for patients and may
compromise in some cases therapeutic adherence. But most impor-
tantly, gene therapy allows one to work with the wild-type protein,
that is recognized as own by the immune system and signals
through the canonical FGF21 signaling pathways, avoiding unspeci-
fic biological responses. Regardless of the route of administration,
long-term steady levels of circulating FGF21 were obtained in mice
treated with AAV-FGF21 vectors, supporting the absence of anti-
transgene immune responses in these animals. In contrast, humoral
responses have been observed shortly after administration of
FGF21 analogues to non-human primates and humans (Adams
et al, 2013; Gaich et al, 2013; Kim et al, 2017; Stanislaus et al,
2017), and the implications of these responses to long-term drug
efficacy are yet unknown. In addition, those FGF21-class molecules
that act as receptor agonists, both in a Klotho-dependent or in
Klotho-independent manner, may have unpredictable biological
effects in vivo.
The two main safety concerns to be considered for a chronic
treatment with FGF21 are possible deleterious effects on bone home-
ostasis and, given the growth factor nature of FGF21, the potential
for tumorigenesis (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005; Kharitonenkov &
DiMarchi, 2017). Tg-FGF21 mice expressing the transgene specifi-
cally in the liver are shorter, and bone loss has been reported in Tg-
FGF21 mice as well as in animals and humans treated with recombi-
nant native FGF21 protein or FGF21 analogues/mimetics (Wei et al,
2012; Wang et al, 2015; Talukdar et al, 2016; Charoenphandhu
et al, 2017; Kim et al, 2017). Despite the fact that the levels of circu-
lating FGF21 achieved in our study in HFD-fed mice treated with the
highest dose were in the same range as those observed in Tg-FGF21
mice (Inagaki et al, 2008), we did not observe any differences in the
naso-anal or tibial length in AAV8-hAAT-FGF21-treated animals,
irrespective of the age at treatment. It is worth noticing that the
group of animals that were treated as young adults received the
vectors at an age at which closure of the bone growth plate has not
yet occurred (Kilborn et al, 2002). Our mice were of the same strain
than the Tg-FG21 reported to be shorter, then the striking dif-
ferences on bone growth may be due to effects caused during
embryonic development and/or early post-natal life of transgenic
animals. Alternatively, it has been postulated that the bone pheno-
type observed in TgFGF21 might not be a direct consequence of
FGF21 action but rather of the chronic, FGF21-induced negative
energy
balance
present
in
these
animals
(Kharitonenkov
&

 trabecular and cortical bone loss following treatment of HFD-fed
mice with FGF21-encoding AAV8 vectors. There is currently contro-
versy as whether FGF21 has deleterious effects on bone mineral
density. Tg-FGF21 mice have reduced bone mass (Wei et al, 2012;
Wang et al, 2015). Short-term pharmacological treatment with
native FGF21 or analogues/mimetics caused bone loss and/or alter-
ation of markers of bone turnover in rodents and humans (Wei
et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2015; Talukdar et al, 2016; Charoen-
phandhu et al, 2017; Kim et al, 2017). In contrast, a very recent
study described no effect of short-term FGF21 treatment on bone
mass in HFD-fed mice, suggesting that FGF21 is not critical for bone
homeostasis in rodents (Li et al, 2017).
Regarding tumor formation, although the number of animals
used in our studies was low, the striking difference in the incidence
of liver neoplasms between animals injected with null vectors or
therapeutic vectors actually argues in favor of a protective role of
FGF21 against malignancies. FGF21 gene transfer to the liver did
not only not cause tumors per se but also prevented the formation
of tumors induced by long-term HFD feeding. In agreement with
these findings, no signs of pathological proliferation were detected
in the liver of two different transgenic mouse models overexpressing
FGF21 from birth (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005; Huang et al, 2006) or
in mice treated with recombinant native FGF21 (Adams et al,
2012a,b). Moreover, overexpression of FGF21 specifically in the
liver in transgenic mice or treatment with native FGF21 delayed the
appearance of chemically induced tumors (Huang et al, 2006; Xu
et al, 2015).
Noticeably, the levels of FGF21 in circulation necessary to medi-
ate beneficial therapeutic effects were very similar independently of
the target organ for gene transfer and were around 25–50 ng/ml,
which is much lower than the peak concentrations achieved in clini-
cal trials after periodic administration of FGF21 analogues (Dong
et al, 2015; Talukdar et al, 2016). This indicates that constant low
levels of serum FGF21 could be more efficacious. Importantly, these
levels of circulating FGF21 did not produce bone toxicity in mice
and prevented the development of liver tumors associated with
long-term HFD feeding.
With its excellent record of efficacy and safety, and the approval
in Europe of the first in vivo gene therapy product in 2012 (Bu
¨ning,
2013)—with others under way—AAV-mediated gene therapy has
broadened its range of applications from monogenic to non-heredi-
tary diseases, such as diabetes. There is considerable preclinical and
clinical experience with liver and muscle-directed gene transfer for a
variety of hereditary conditions, which provide support to the feasi-
bility of approaches such as those proposed here for the treatment
of complex metabolic diseases in humans. In this work, we have
developed gene therapy approaches for obesity and insulin resis-
tance based on the use of AAV vectors encoding FGF21. One-time
administration of these vectors to obese animals enabled a long-
lasting increase in FGF21 levels in circulation, which resulted in
sustained counteraction of obesity, adipose tissue inflammation,
insulin resistance, and NASH in the absence of adverse events. In
healthy animals, this approach was safe and promoted healthy aging.
Our results constitute the basis to support the future clinical transla-
tion of FGF21 gene transfer to treat T2D, obesity, and related comor-
bidities. Nevertheless, studies that investigate the long-term safety
and efficacy of the approach in large animals, including non-human
primates, are mandatory before moving AAV-FGF21-mediated gene
therapy to the clinic for the treatment of these highly prevalent
diseases.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Eight-, nine-, or 29-week-old male C57BL/6J mice and 8- or 11-
week-old B6.V-Lepob/OlaHsd (ob/ob) mice were used. Mice were
kept in a specific pathogen-free facility (SER-CBATEG, UAB) and
maintained under a light–dark cycle of 12 h at 22°C. Mice were fed
ad libitum with a standard diet (2018S Teklad Global Diets�,
Envigo) or a high-fat diet (TD.88137 Harlan Teklad). When stated,
mice were fasted for 16 h. For tissue sampling, mice were anes-
thetized with inhalational anesthetic isoflurane (IsoFlo�, Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) and decapitated. Tissues of
interest were excised and kept at �80°C or in formalin until analy-
sis. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the
Ethics Committee in Animal and Human Experimentation of the
Universitat Auto
`noma de Barcelona.
Recombinant AAV vectors
An AAV expression cassette was obtained by cloning, between
the ITRs of AAV2, the murine codon-optimized FGF21 coding
sequence (coFGF21) under the control of either: (i) the human
a1-antitrypsin promoter (hAAT); (ii) the cytomegalovirus (CMV)
promoter, or (iii) the early CMV enhancer/chicken beta actin
(CAG) promoter with the addition of four tandem repeats of
miRT122a
(50CAAACACCATTGTCACACTCCA30)
and
of
miRT1
(50TTACATACTTCTTTACATTCCA30) sequences cloned in the 30
untranslated region of the expression cassette (Jimenez et al,
2013; Mallol et al, 2017). A non-coding cassette carrying the
hAAT, the CAG, or the CMV promoter but no transgene was used
to produce null vectors. Single-stranded AAV8 or AAV1 vectors
were produced by triple transfection in HEK293 cells and purified
using an optimized CsCl gradient-based purification protocol that
renders vector preps of high purity and devoid of empty capsids
(Ayuso et al, 2010). Viral genome titers were determined by quan-
titative PCR using linearized plasmid DNA as standard curve.
Administration of AAV vectors
For systemic administration, AAV vectors were diluted in 200 ll of
0.001% F68 Pluronic� (Gibco) in PBS and injected via the tail vein.
The
intra-eWAT
administration
was
performed
as
previously
described (Jimenez et al, 2013). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with
an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine
(10 mg/kg). A laparotomy was performed in order to expose eWAT.
AAV vectors were resuspended in PBS with 0.001% Pluronic� F68
(Gibco) and injected directly into the epididymal fat pad. Each
epididymal fat pad was injected twice with 50 ll of the AAV solu-
tion. The abdomen was rinsed with sterile saline solution and closed
with a two-layer suture. For intramuscular administration of AAV
vectors, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
ketamine/xylazine. Hind limbs were shaved, and vectors were
administered by intramuscular injection in a total volume of 180 ll

 divided into six injection sites distributed between the quadriceps,
gastrocnemius, and tibialis cranialis of each hind limb.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed for 12–24 h in 10% formalin, embedded in
paraffin and sectioned. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C
with rat anti-Mac2 (1:50; CL8942AP; Cedarlane), guinea pig anti-
insulin (1:100; I-8510; Sigma-Aldrich), or rabbit anti-glucagon
(1:100; 219-01; Signet Labs). Biotinylated rabbit anti-rat (1:300;
E0467; Dako), goat anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated)
(1:200; A11011; ThermoFisher), goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated) (1:300; A11073; ThermoFisher), or rabbit
anti-guinea pig coupled to peroxidase (1:300; P0141; Dako) were
used as secondary antibodies. The ABC peroxidase kit (Pierce)
was used for immunodetection, and sections were counterstained
in Mayer’s hematoxylin. Hoechst (B2261; Sigma-Aldrich) was
used
for
nuclear
counterstaining
of
fluorescent
specimens.
PicroSirius Red staining and Masson’s trichrome staining were
used to evaluate fibrosis. Morphometric analysis of adipocyte
size was performed in eWAT sections stained with hematoxylin–
eosin as previously described (Mun
˜oz et al, 2010). Four animals
per group were used and at least 250 adipocytes/animal were
analyzed. Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse 90i micro-
scope (Nikon). The percentage of b-cell area in the pancreas
was analyzed in two insulin-stained sections 200 lm apart, by
dividing the area of all insulin+ cells in one section by the total
pancreas area of that section. b-Cell mass was calculated by
multiplying pancreas weight by percentage of b-cell area, as
previously described (Jimenez et al, 2011).
RNA analysis
Total RNA was obtained from different tissues using isolation
reagent (Tripure, Roche, for liver and QIAzol, Qiagen, for adipose
depots) and an RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) and treated with DNAseI
(Qiagen). One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the
Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche). Real-time
quantitative PCR (qRT–PCR) was performed in a Lightcycler
(Roche) using the Lightcycler 480 SyBr Green I Master Mix (Roche)

Western blot analysis
iWAT and iBAT were homogenized in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qia-
gen), and the protein fraction was isolated from the organic phase
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were separated
by 12% SDS–PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit
polyclonal anti-UCP1 (1:1,000; ab10983; Abcam) and rabbit poly-
clonal anti-a-tubulin (1:1,000; ab4074; Abcam) antibodies. Detec-
tion was performed using ECL Plus detection reagent (Amersham
Biosciences).
Hormone and metabolite assays
Hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol content were determined by
chloroform: methanol (2:1 vol/vol) extraction of total lipids, as
described previously (Carr et al, 1993). Triglycerides and cholesterol
were quantified spectrophotometrically using an enzymatic assay
(Horiba-ABX) in a Pentra 400 Analyzer (Horiba-ABX). Glycemia
was determined using a Glucometer Elite
TM (Bayer) and insulin
levels were measured using the Rat Insulin ELISA kit (90010, Crystal
Chem). Glucagon levels were measured using a glucagon radioim-
munoassay (#GL-32K, EMD Millipore). Serum FGF21, adiponectin,
leptin, IGFBP1, and IGF1 were determined using the Mouse/Rat
FGF-21 ELISA kit (MF2100, R&D Systems), the Mouse Adiponectin
ELISA kit (80569, Crystal Chem), the Mouse Leptin ELISA kit
(90030, Crystal Chem), the IGFBP1 (Mouse) ELISA kit (KA3054,
Abnova),
and
the
m/r
IGF-I-ELISA
kit
(E25,
Mediagnost),
respectively.
Insulin tolerance test
Insulin (Humulin Regular; Eli Lilly) was injected intraperitoneally at
a dose of 0.75 IU/kg body weight to fed mice. Glycemia was
measured in tail vein blood samples at the indicated time points.
Glucose tolerance test
Awake mice were fasted overnight (16 h) and administered with an
intraperitoneal injection of glucose (2 g/kg body weight). Glycemia
was measured in tail vein blood samples at the indicated time
points. Venous blood was collected from tail vein in tubes (Micro-
vette� CB 300, SARSTEDT) at the same time points and immediately
centrifuged to separate serum, which was used to measure insulin
levels.
Indirect calorimetry
An indirect open circuit calorimeter (Oxylet, Panlab) was used to
monitor O2 consumption and CO2 production. Mice were individual-
ized and acclimated to the metabolic chambers for 24 h, and data
were collected in each cage for 3 min, every 15 min, for 24 h. Data
were taken during the light and dark cycles and were adjusted by

 the eXplore Locus CT scanner (General Electric) at 27-lm resolu-
tion. Trabeculae were analyzed in 1 mm3 of proximal tibial epiph-
ysis and 1.8 mm3 of cortical tibial diaphysis in four mice/group.
Bone parameters were calculated with the MicroView 3D Image
Viewer & Analysis Tool. The length of the tibia was measured from
the intercondylar eminence to the medial malleolus.
Open-field test
The open-field test was performed between 9:00 am and 1:00 pm as
previously reported (Haurigot et al, 2013). Briefly, animals were
placed in the center of a brightly lit chamber (41 × 41 × 30 cm)
crossed by two bundles of photobeams (LE 8811; Panlab) that detect
horizontal and vertical movements. Motor and exploratory activities
were evaluated during the first 6 min. The total distance covered was
evaluated using a video tracking system (SMART Junior; Panlab).
Statistical analysis and data processing
Sample size determination was based on previous experience with
similar studies. Randomization was performed using the excel
function Roundup() or by GraphPad QuickCalcs to allocate mice in
each group. In addition, we tested that the mean body weight and
the mean glycemia were statistically not different for each experi-
mental group prior to assignment to diet and/or treatment groups.
Furthermore, each experimental group was caged separately to
avoid any caging effects. All tests (ITT, GTT, Open-field, etc.) were
performed by investigators blinded to the treatment. All results are
expressed as mean � SEM. The GraphPad Prism 7 software was
used for statistical analyses. Data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc correction, except for those param-
eters involving comparison of only two experimental groups, in
which case an unpaired Student’s t-test was used. Differences were
considered significant when P < 0.05. All P-values for main fig-

The paper explained
Problem
As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity increases
worldwide, so does the need for better therapies suited for the
heterogeneous obese/T2D patient population. Fibroblast growth factor
21 (FGF21) is a promising therapeutic agent for T2D/obesity, but the
native FGF21 protein has poor pharmacokinetic properties, including a
short half-life and susceptibility to in vivo proteolytic degradation,
which have hampered the pharmacological development of FGF21-
based drug products.
Results
In this study, we took advantage of adeno-associated viral vectors
(AAV) to genetically engineer tissues and obtain sustained circulating
levels of FGF21. Gene transfer to the liver of animals fed a high-fat
diet for a long time or of ob/ob mice resulted in marked reductions in
body weight, adiposity, non-alcoholic liver disease, and insulin resis-
tance for > 1 year. Similar observations were made when FGF21 was
overexpressed and secreted from epididymal white adipose tissue of
ob/ob mice. Furthermore, FGF21 production following the engineering
of skeletal muscle of healthy animals fed a standard diet prevented
the increase in weight and insulin resistance associated with aging.
Importantly, these therapeutic effects were obtained in the absence of
side effects despite continuously elevated serum FGF21.
Impact
Our results show that FGF21 gene therapy holds great translational
potential in the fight against insulin resistance, T2D, obesity, and
related comorbidities.
