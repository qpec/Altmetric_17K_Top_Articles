Abstract
Background: There is currently no blood-based test for detection of early-stage osteoarthritis (OA) and the
anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has relatively low sensitivity for
early-stage disease. Morbidity in arthritis could be markedly decreased if early-stage arthritis could be routinely
detected and classified by clinical chemistry test. We hypothesised that damage to proteins of the joint by
oxidation, nitration and glycation, and with signatures released in plasma as oxidized, nitrated and glycated
amino acids may facilitate early-stage diagnosis and typing of arthritis.
Methods: Patients with knee joint early-stage and advanced OA and RA or other inflammatory joint disease
(non-RA) and healthy subjects with good skeletal health were recruited for the study (n = 225). Plasma/serum and
synovial fluid was analysed for oxidized, nitrated and glycated proteins and amino acids by quantitative liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data-driven machine learning methods were employed to explore
diagnostic utility of the measurements for detection and classifying early-stage OA and RA, non-RA and good
skeletal health with training set and independent test set cohorts.
Results: Glycated, oxidized and nitrated proteins and amino acids were detected in synovial fluid and plasma of
arthritic patients with characteristic patterns found in early and advanced OA and RA, and non-RA, with respect to
healthy controls. In early-stage disease, two algorithms for consecutive use in diagnosis were developed: (1) disease
versus healthy control, and (2) classification as OA, RA and non-RA. The algorithms featured 10 damaged amino
acids in plasma, hydroxyproline and anti-CCP antibody status. Sensitivities/specificities were: (1) good skeletal health,
0.92/0.91; (2) early-stage OA, 0.92/0.90; early-stage RA, 0.80/0.78; and non-RA, 0.70/0.65 (training set). These were
confirmed in independent test set validation. Damaged amino acids increased further in severe and advanced OA
and RA.
Conclusions: Oxidized, nitrated and glycated amino acids combined with hydroxyproline and anti-CCP antibody
status provided a plasma-based biochemical test of relatively high sensitivity and specificity for early-stage diagnosis
and typing of arthritic disease.

 Background
Oxidation, nitration and glycation of proteins are non-
enzymatic processes in tissues and body fluids that produce
some of the most quantitatively and functionally important
spontaneous post-translational modifications of proteins in
clinical disease. Reaction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
with proteins produces a characteristic profile of oxidative
damage: trace level oxidized amino acid residues in proteins
such as methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), dityrosine (DT), N-
formylkynurenine (NFK) and others. Reaction of proteins
with reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as peroxynitrite
characteristically forms 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Protein gly-
cation occurs at N-terminal and lysine residue sidechain
amino groups to form Nε-(1-deoxyfructosyl)lysine (FL) and
other fructosamine derivatives, which degrade slowly to
form end-stage stable adducts collectively called ad-
vanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Reactive dicar-
bonyl metabolites such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal (MG)
and
3-deoxyglucosone
(3-DG)
are
also
important
physiological glycating agents and react mainly with
arginine residues of proteins to form AGEs. Clinical
measurement of protein oxidation, nitration and glyca-
tion adducts was recently reviewed [1] (see Additional
file 1: Figure S1).
One of the first examples of involvement of oxidative
damage in clinical disease was modification of cartilage
and other proteins of the joint during development of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [2, 3]. Increased oxidative
damage and nitration to proteins in RA likely arises as a
consequence of increased ROS and RNS formed in the
respiratory burst of neutrophils and macrophages migrat-
ing into the arthritic joint [4]. Osteoarthritis (OA) is also
driven by inflammation, at least in the early stages, and
may involve increased ROS and RNS exposure [5].
Increased ROS also originates from mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion of chondrocytes and other cells implicated in both RA
and OA development [6, 7]. Protein glycation has also been
implicated in the development of arthritis, which may arise
through oxidative stress-driven glycation or “glycoxidation”
in RA [8, 9] and through age-related accumulation of
AGEs in cartilage, facilitating development of OA [10].
Oxidative damage, nitration and glycation of cartilage is as-
sociated with misfolding and aggregation of the proteogly-
can–collagen
network
surrounding
chondrocytes
and
matrix degradation. These damaging modifications are
thought to compromise structural integrity and viscoelasti-
city of cartilage, impairing its ability to sustain mechanical
pressures and joint function [11].
In principle, measurement of protein oxidation, nitration
and glycation adducts could provide multiple mechanistic
biomarkers of arthritic disease to aid in clinical-chemistry-
based diagnosis and progression of disease. This is particu-
larly important for detection of early-stage disease. In the
detection of early-stage RA (eRA), use of disease-modifying
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has produced the
prospect of a therapeutic cure for RA [12]. Severe life
impairment by development of OA may likely be pre-
vented if arthritic disease is identified and treated in
the early stages [13].
Currently, magnetic resonance imaging techniques
have been developed for evaluation of cartilage damage
in early-stage OA (eOA). These imaging techniques have
approximately 70 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity
compared to reference diagnosis by arthroscopy. They
require expensive instrumentation, time and facilities
[14]. They cannot be used in patients with implanted
pacemakers or aneurysm coils.
Detection of RA by clinical chemistry assessments has
been improved by introduction of the anti-cyclic citrulli-
nated peptide (CCP) antibody test, which has 68 %
sensitivity and 98 % specificity in established disease
[15]. The presumed antigen is citrullinated protein (CP),
which we recently identified as increased in both eRA
and eOA, with only dominant immunogenicity in the
former [16]. The anti-CCP antibody test is now consid-
ered state-of-the-art in RA diagnosis. It has relatively
low sensitivity for eRA of 61 % and hence, improvement
is desirable [15].
In searching for biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, ana-
lysis of proteins is often considered and preferred over
analysis of amino acids, because proteins are typically
longer-lived than amino acids and may be linked fu-
nctionally to the mechanism of the target disease.
Restricted access to samples of affected tissues often
precludes measurement of target tissue-based proteins.
Proteins damaged by oxidation, nitration and glycation
undergo proteolysis to release oxidized, nitrated and
glycated amino acids - also called oxidation, nitration
and glycation free adducts [1]. Increase in such trace-
level damaged amino acids in synovial fluid equilibrates
rapidly with plasma. Amino acids may be detected with
high analytical specificity and sensitivity and robustly
quantified by stable isotopic dilution analysis liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) [17]. Plasma levels of oxidized, nitrated and gly-
cated amino acids may thereby provide signatures of
protein damage, dysfunction and disease progression in
the joint in early and advanced stage arthritis. In com-
bination with the biomarker of bone turnover and
resorption - hydroxyproline (Hyp) - and anti-CCP anti-
body status, the signature may be made specific for
arthritic disease [15, 16, 18].
In this study we explored changes in the level of
oxidized, nitrated and glycated proteins and related
trace-level oxidized, nitrated and glycated amino acids in
plasma and synovial fluid from subjects with early-stage
and advanced or severe OA and RA or non-RA and
healthy controls with good skeletal health.

 Methods
Patients, healthy subjects and sampling
Patient recruitment, characteristics and sampling was
as
previously
described
[16].
The
recruited
study
groups are illustrated in Fig. 1a and b. Briefly, patients
with eOA (n = 46), eRA (n = 45) and inflammatory
arthritis other than RA (non-RA (n = 42)), and patients
with longstanding severe, advanced OA, aOA (n = 17),
and advanced RA, aRA (n = 22), were recruited at
multiple sites: Orthopaedic Clinics, University Hospital
Coventry & Warwickshire (UHCW), Coventry, UK;
Department of Rheumatology, Ipswich Hospital NHS
Trust, UK; Department of Rheumatology, Royal Devon
and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, UK; and
Rapid
Access
Rheumatology
Clinic,
City
Hospital,
Birmingham, UK.
Criteria for eOA were: subjects presenting with new-
onset knee pain, normal radiographs of the symptomatic
knee and routine exploratory arthroscopy with macro-
scopic findings classified as grade I/II on the Outer-
bridge scale; recruited at UHCW, Coventry, UK. Patients
with eRA and non-RA were recruited within 5 months
of the onset of symptoms of inflammatory arthritis at
the Rapid Access Rheumatology Clinic, City Hospital,
Birmingham, UK. Synovial fluid and peripheral venous
blood samples were collected on initial presentation and
diagnostic outcomes were determined at follow up. A
diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) was made

early-stage arthritic diseases combined. A random outcome is 0.33

 according to the 1987 American Rheumatoid Associ-
ation criteria [19]. A diagnosis of non-RA was made
where alternative rheumatological diagnoses explained
the inflammatory arthritis, as described [20]. For ex-
ample, training-set non-RA subjects had reactive arth-
ritis (n = 6), pseudogout (n = 1), and unclassified (n = 3).
Criteria for aOA were: longstanding or established
severe symptoms of OA (≥2 years duration of disease)
with corresponding radiographic changes (Kellgren-
Lawrence grade IV changes on radiographs) and under-
going therapeutic knee aspiration and corticosteroid
instillation or total knee replacement; and recruited at
UHCW, Coventry, UK and Ipswich Hospital NHS
Trust, Ipswich, UK. Criteria for aRA were: joint stiff-
ness in the mornings of at least one hour duration;
symmetrical swelling in three or more joints; radio-
graphic evidence of bone erosions; rheumatoid nod-
ules with increased serum rheumatoid factor (RF);
and symptoms of ≥2 years duration [19]. Patients
with aRA were recruited at Ipswich Hospital NHS
Trust, UK and Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation
Trust, Exeter, UK. Criteria for these clinical classifications
are similar to those suggested in consensus position and
best practice statements [21, 22].
Healthy controls were recruited at participating clinical
centres (n = 53). For healthy control subjects the inclusion
criteria were no history of joint symptoms, arthritic dis-
ease or other morbidity. Exclusion criteria were: history of
injury or pain in either knee; taking medication excepting
oral contraceptives and vitamins; and any abnormality
identified on physical examination of the knee. Control
subjects and patients with early-stage disease were re-
cruited as two independent cohorts for a training set and
independent test set for data analysis in machine learning
methods as explained subsequently.
Peripheral venous blood samples from healthy sub-
jects and patients with eOA were collected after over-
night fasting with EDTA anti-coagulant. Synovial fluid
from the eOA study group was collected concur-
rently. Venous blood and synovial fluid samples for
eRA, non-RA, aOA and aRA study groups were col-
lected in the non-fasted state. For analytes studied
herein, diurnal variation in serum Hyp from healthy
subjects was 20 % and for other amino acids up to
13–25 %, depending on the analyte [23, 24]. Diurnal
variation in plasma protein glycation and oxidative
stress in healthy subjects was <15 %, as judged by
plasma fructosamine and plasma cysteine, respectively
[25, 26]. Synovial fluid was collected from patients
with aOA and aRA and eOA, eRA and with non-RA
recruited for the training set cohort. Synovial fluid
was not collected from patients with eOA, eRA or
non-RA in the test set cohort in which analytes were
determined only in plasma/serum.
Blood and synovial fluid were centrifuged (2000 g,
10 minutes) and the plasma and synovial fluid super-
natant were removed and stored at –80 °C until analysis.
Samples were centrifuged within one hour of collection.
A critical time-limiting feature for sample processing is
the rate of sample oxidation, as judged by loss of
reduced glutathione (GSH) and other thiols, which leads
to subsequent increase in protein oxidation adducts
(see subsequent text). This prompt sample processing
maintains >70 % GSH and thereby avoids artefactual
increase in protein oxidation adducts in sample col-
lection [27, 28]. Repeated freeze thawing was avoided
as this increases estimates of the protein oxidation
adduct, methionine sulfoxide [29].
Serum was available for the eRA and non-RA study
groups and plasma was available for all others. Serum is
comparable to plasma as a sample matrix where the
major protein lost during clotting (fibrinogen) does not
affect median glycation, oxidation and nitration adduct
residue content normalised to amino-acid-modified and
related free adduct and Hyp concentrations [1, 16].
Analysis of oxidized, nitrated and glycated protein and
oxidation, nitration and glycation free adducts in plasma/
serum and synovial fluid
The contents of oxidation, nitration and glycation ad-
duct residues in plasma/serum and synovial proteins
were quantified in exhaustive enzymatic digests by stable
isotopic dilution analysis LC-MS/MS, with correction
for autohydrolysis of hydrolytic enzymes as described
[17]. Oxidation, nitration and glycation free adducts
were determined in the ultrafiltrates of the same sam-
ples. Ultrafiltrate of plasma/serum or synovial fluid
(100
μl)
was
collected
by
microspin
ultrafiltration
(10 kDa cutoff) at 4 °C. Retained protein was diluted
with water to 500 μl and washed by four cycles of
concentration to 50 μl and dilution to 500 μl with water
over the microspin ultrafilter at 4 °C. The final washed
protein (100 μl) was delipidated and hydrolysed enzy-
matically as described [16, 17].
Protein hydrolysate (25 μl, 32 μg protein equivalent)
or ultrafiltrate was mixed with stable isotopic standard
analytes (for amounts see Additional file 1: Table S1)
and analysed by LC-MS/MS using an Acquity™ UPLC
system with a Quattro Premier tandem mass spectrom-
eter (Waters, Manchester, U.K.) [17]. Samples are main-
tained at 4 °C in the autosampler during batch analysis.
The columns were: 2.1 × 50 mm and 2.1 mm × 250 mm,
5 μm particle size Hypercarb™ (Thermo Scientific), in
series with programmed switching, at 30 °C. Chro-
matographic retention is necessary to resolve oxidized
analytes from their amino acid precursors to avoid inter-
ference from partial oxidation of the latter in the elec-
trospray ionization source of the mass spectrometric

 detector. Analytes were detected by electrospray positive
ionization and mass spectrometry multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode where analyte detection re-
sponse is specific for mass/charge ratio of the analyte
molecular ion and major fragment ion generated by
collision-induced dissociation in the mass spectrometer
collision cell. The ionization source and desolvation gas
temperatures were 120 °C and 350 °C, respectively, cone
gas and desolvation gas flow rates were 99 and 900 l/h
and the capillary voltage was 0.60 kV. Argon gas (5.0 × 10-3
mbar) was in the collision cell.
For MRM detection, molecular ion and fragment ion
masses and collision energies optimized to ± 0.1 Da
and ± 1 eV, respectively, were programmed (Additional file
1: Table S1). Analytes determined were: oxidation adducts
- MetSO, DT and NFK; nitration adduct –3-NT; and gly-
cation adducts - FL, and advanced glycation endproducts
(AGEs), Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), Nε-(1-carbox-
yethyl)lysine (CEL), Nω-carboxymethylarginine (CMA),
hydroimidazolones derived from glyoxal, methylglyoxal
and 3-deoxyglucosone (G-H1, MG-H1 and 3DG-H),
respectively), pentosidine and methylglyoxal-derived lysine
dimer (MOLD); and others - Hyp and amino acids - arg,
lys, tyr, trp, met and val (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Valine is determined in protein hydrolysates for the prote-
ase autohydrolysis correction [17]. Oxidation, nitration
and glycation adduct residues are normalised to their
amino acid residue precursors and given as mmol/
mol amino acid modified; and related free adducts
are given in nM. Chemical structures and biochemical
and clinical significance of these analytes have been
described elsewhere [1, 16].
Other assessments
Anti-CCP antibody positivity was assessed by automated
enzymatic immunoassay (EliA CCP; Phadia, Uppsala,
Sweden).
Machine learning analysis
The objective was to distinguish between the following
four groups: healthy control, eOA, eRA and non-RA. In
all cases, the diagnostic algorithms were trained on the
training data set, before being used to predict the disease
class for each sample in the test data set (Fig. 1a and b).
A two-stage approach was taken: (1) to distinguish be-
tween disease and healthy control; and (2) to distinguish
between eOA, eRA and non-RA. The outcome was to
assign, for each test set sample, a set of probabilities cor-
responding to each of the disease/control groups - the
group assignment being that for which the probability is
highest. Test data were held separate from algorithm
training; algorithm settings were not adjusted once we
began to analyse the test set data, thereby guarding
against overfitting and hence providing a rigorous
estimate of predictive performance. We also performed
fivefold cross-validation separately on each of the train-
ing, test data sets, to assess predictive performance
internally for each data set. Four algorithm types were
tested for performance using random forests, multi-
class
logistic
regression,
multi-class
sparse
logistic
regression, and support vector machines [30–32]. In
the training set cross-validations, we use a panel of 15
plasma biomarkers: RF, anti-CCP antibody positivity,
Hyp and MetSO, DT, NFK, 3-NT, FL, CML, CEL,
CMA, G-H1, MG-H1, 3DG-H and pentosidine free ad-
ducts. Methylglyoxal-derived lysine dimer (MOLD) was
omitted as levels were close to the limit of detection.
We used the area under the curve of the receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) plot (AUROC) statistic as our
measure of performance [33], with the 95 % CI deter-
mined via bootstrap analysis using the R package pROC
[34]. In the training-set test set cross-validation we used
the minimum set of features giving the maximum
AUROC. This minimum feature set was used in the test
set validation. We produced sensitivity/specificity values
from the ROC curves using an automated procedure
that finds where the sensitivity/specificity values are
most similar. Where we consider three classes, we con-
sider a set of one-versus-all ROC curves (one per class).
Fivefold cross-validation was carried out on the training
set data to give an initial estimate of predictive per-
formance, and to identify the best-performing machine
learning method. We then trained the algorithm on the
entire training set, before making predictions for the
test
data
set.
We
also
performed
fivefold
cross-
validation on the test set data. Data were analysed using
R version 3.1.3.
Statistical analyses
Non-normally distributed variables are summarized as
median (lower to upper quartile), two groups were
compared using the Mann–Whitney U test and four
groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test
for independent samples and Wilcoxon’s signed ranks
test for two-group, paired samples (plasma and syn-
ovial fluid from the same donor). Correlation analysis
was performed using the Spearman method. Data were
analysed using SPSS, version 22.0. A Bonferroni cor-
rection of 13 was applied for testing of multiple pro-
tein oxidation, nitration and glycation adduct levels,
assuming a null hypothesis that any of the 13 adducts
measured may have levels that are significantly chan-
ged in the arthritic disease study groups. Data were
considered significantly different when the P value was
<0.05/13 or <0.0038. This report adheres to the guide-
lines for transparent reporting of a multivariable pre-
diction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis
(TRIPOD statement) [35].

 Results
Summary description of protein oxidation, nitration and
glycation adduct changes in the plasma and synovial
fluid and inter-compartment correlations in patients with
early and advanced arthritis
Changes in protein oxidation, nitration and glycation
status in plasma and synovial fluid in patients with eOA,
aOA, eRA, aRA and non-RA with respect to plasma
levels in healthy controls are summarised in a heat map
(Fig. 2). Data and detailed descriptions of the changes
are given in Additional file 1: Supplementary informa-
tion and Tables S2–S7, including a description of the
effects of drug therapy in aRA. The heat map indicates
there were changes in protein oxidation, nitration and
glycation adduct levels in both adduct contents of protein
and free adduct concentrations in plasma and synovial
fluid. The different patterns of adduct levels provides the
basis to detect and distinguish the presence and type of
arthritis at the early stage of clinical development, and in
advanced-stage disease.
In plasma for healthy controls and early-stage disease
(eOA, eRA and non-RA), there were changes in oxidation,
nitration and glycation adduct contents of protein
(MetSO, DT, 3-NT, FL, MG-H1, CMA and pentosidine)
and oxidation and glycation free adduct concentrations
(MetSO, NFK, DT, CMA and MOLD; P < 0.05, Kruskal-
Wallis), indicating disrupted proteostasis in protein
glycation, oxidation and nitration in the plasma com-
partment and tissue release into plasma of free adducts
from proteolysis of oxidized and glycated proteins.
Similar analysis for early-stage and advanced disease of
the same type showed the following changes in plasma:
for aOA versus eOA, increased NFK, DT, 3-NT, CML
and 3DG-H adducts of protein and increased MetSO,
NFK, DT, 3-NT, CEL and CMA free adducts; and for
aRA versus eRA, increased DT, 3-NT, FL, CML, G-H1,
MG-H1 and CMA adducts of protein and increased
MetSO, DT and pentosidine free adducts.
To assess if changes of analyte in the synovial fluid are
reflected by similar increases in plasma we computed
inter-compartment homotypic correlation (correlation
between levels of a marker in plasma and synovial fluid
from the same subject) (Table 1). For eOA and eRA
combined, in early-stage disease there were 10 homoty-
pic correlations between synovial fluid and plasma for
oxidized, nitrated and glycated amino acids and only 5
homotypic correlations for oxidation nitration and glyca-
tion adducts of protein. For aOA and aRA combined, in
advanced disease there were 9 homotypic correlations
between synovial fluid and plasma for oxidized, nitrated
and glycated amino acids and 13 homotypic correlations
for oxidation nitration and glycation adducts of protein:
in non-RA there were 3 homotypic correlations for amino
acids (3 glycated amino acids) and one homotypic correl-
ation for protein (glycated protein). This suggests that
oxidized, nitrated and glycated amino acids equilibrate
readily between synovial fluid and plasma compartments in
early-stage arthritis and both oxidized, nitrated and glycated
amino acids and proteins equilibrate between synovial fluid
and plasma compartments in advanced-stage arthritis.
Machine learning analysis
To explore the diagnostic utility of protein damage mea-
surements we analysed plasma amino acid analyte data
by a machine learning approach. Random forests was
the best-performing method. Application of two algo-
rithms consecutively gave the best diagnostic outcome.
First, with algorithm 1 we discriminated between healthy
control and early-stage arthritis. Second, with algorithm
2 we identified types of arthritis - eOA, eRA and non-
RA. Algorithms were trained with a training set subject
group and validated independently in a different test set
subject group (Fig. 1). Training set data are in Additional
file 1: Tables S3, S6 and S7 and test set data are in
Additional file 1: Tables S8–S10. Algorithm features for
maximum AUROC were:

ation, respectively. A random outcome is 0.33 (three

ity assessment decreased the AUROC by 0.0023. Related

were: 0.92/0.90, 0.80/0.78 and 0.70/0.65; 0.83/0.84, 0.77/

Discussion
Increased protein oxidation, nitration and glycation of
cartilage have long been implicated as damaging modifi-
cations in the joint, mediating development of arthritic
disease [2, 3, 8]. There have been few studies on protein
damage in early-stage disease. Experimental studies of
gene deletion and pharmacological activation of nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription
factor that coordinates basal and inducible expression of
enzymes protective against oxidative stress and dicarbo-
nyl glycation [36, 37], supports a role of oxidative
damage and dicarbonyl glycation in the development of
OA and RA [38, 39]. Trace-level oxidation, nitration and
glycation free adducts potentially indicate the presence
of this in plasma.
Early-stage detection of arthritic disease and effective
lifestyle
and/or
pharmaceutical
interventions
could
markedly decrease morbidity in OA, achieve a cure for
RA and improve outcomes for other arthritic disease
[12, 13]. Development of drugs to suppress oxidative
damage and glycation damage to collagen in arthritis will
be facilitated by availability of companion diagnostic
tests based on related biomarkers [40]. There is no
established method to detect eOA. Radiography remains
the method of choice for later staging of aOA but shows
little or no change in eOA. The anti-CCP antibody test
is now a clinical standard biochemical test for RA and
diagnosis is often confirmed before damage to the joint
occurs. Even for eRA, however, the anti-CPP antibody
test has relatively low sensitivity [15]; indeed, we ob-
served sensitivity of 56 % herein with patients recruited
within 5 months of the onset of symptoms [16]. Hith-
erto, biomarkers of protein oxidation, nitration and
glycation have not been developed for clinical diagnostic
application in arthritis, excepting studies on plasma 3-
NT [41]; the trace-level of these biomarkers leads to
them often being overlooked in untargeted approaches
to biomarkers in arthritis [42].
Herein we comprehensively and quantitatively measured
protein glycation, oxidation and nitration adducts in
plasma and synovial fluid in arthritis. Analysis for diagnos-
tic application suggests a rapid plasma-based test derived
for diagnosis of presence and typing of early-stage arthritis
suitable for skeletal health screening based on plasma oxi-
dized, nitrated and glycated amino acids in combination

 with Hyp and the anti-CCP antibody test is available and
suitable for further validation and development.
In developing an improved test for detection and
typing of early-stage arthritis we focussed on the trace
glycated, oxidized and nitrated amino acids in plasma as
reporters of damaging modifications of proteins in joints.
Plasma is readily accessed, ultrafiltrate easily prepared and
analytes rapidly and robustly quantifiable by stable iso-
topic dilution analysis LC-MS/MS [1]. This technology is
available in most clinical chemistry laboratories; it is the
most stable mass spectrometry platform and relatively
inexpensive to implement, with analyte interference-free
multiplexing and low cost. A rapid escape rate of amino
acids in synovial fluid to plasma [43, 44] suggested that
plasma/serum is a suitable surrogate sample for synovial
fluid. The findings of similar levels of analytes in synovial
fluid and plasma in patients and positive correlation
between plasma and synovial fluid levels of analytes for
the different study groups support this.
Basing our diagnostic algorithm test on oxidized, nitrated
and glycated amino acids rather than oxidized, nitrated and
glycated proteins provided for simple and rapid pre-analytic
processing; cf. 4 days for enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins
[17]. Changes in normal, undamaged amino acids of
plasma in advanced arthritis were studied previously
but had limited diagnostic utility [45, 46]; the damaging

 modifications of oxidation, nitration and glycation provide
a mechanistic link to arthritic disease and thereby diag-
nostic significance. Oxidized, nitrated and glycated amino
acids are changed in other disease conditions [47–49];
combination of the responses with Hyp, however, make
for specific detection of arthritic disease [16].
Surprisingly, there was evidence of decreased oxida-
tion, nitration and glycation adducts in proteins of early-
stage disease in eOA, eRA and non-RA. This may relate
to increased capillary permeability and increased trans-
capillary escape rate (TER) of albumin in early-stage dis-
ease [50]. Albumin thereby has shorter residence time in
plasma and longer residence time in interstitial fluid in
the peripheral tissues at a lower concentration and likely
in the presence of lower concentrations of oxidizing,
nitrating and glycating agents. It will thereby have an
overall decreased rate of oxidation, nitration and glyca-
tion. Increased capillary permeability has been observed
in RA [51]. This effect is lost when marked increase in
protein glycation, oxidation and nitration in the joints in
advanced disease outweighs the effects of increased
protein residence time at interstitial sites. Albumin TER
has been described previously as a confounding factor in
the diagnostic use of plasma protein glycation [52].
In the two-step algorithm-based diagnosis, feature
selection by the data-driven machine learning process
produced algorithms with multiple oxidation, nitration
and glycation adducts, suggesting estimates of these
adducts contribute to the diagnostic power to discriminate
both disease versus control and also typing of early-stage
disease. Hyp was important in discriminating disease versus
control but not for typing of early-stage arthritis. This is
likely because increased Hyp was common to all types of
early-stage arthritis [16]. Similarly, anti-CCP antibody status
was important in discriminating types of arthritis and hence
was a feature only in the second algorithm. This analysis
builds on the wealth of experience and diagnostic value of
anti-CCP antibody positivity in the detection of RA [15].
AUROC values were very high (0.99 for skeletal health
versus disease, and 0.98 for eOA), indicating a high
probability
of
correctly
identifying
early-stage
OA.
Omission of the anti-CCP antibody positivity assessment
gave only a minor improvement in AUROC for arthritis
typing and so may be omitted with minor loss of per-
formance. These were observed particularly for cross-
validations in both training set and test set data and
were lower in independent test set validation. Further
validation is required in independent patient cohorts
and study of the association of the diagnostic response
to clinical symptoms and radiographic changes. There is
also potential for monitoring of disease progression.
There have been no similar machine learning studies
excepting our previous study with plasma Hyp and CP
[16]. AUROC values herein were markedly improved for
detection of healthy controls, eOA and non-RA, and
slightly decreased for eRA (0.93 versus 0.98). Addition
of plasma CP estimates from our previous study [16] in
the algorithm optimisation herein did not improve diag-
nostic performance. Other studies have developed algo-
rithms based on measurement of cytokines but for
advanced OA and RA [53]. Clinical detection of early-
stage arthritis herein is potentially advantageous. Other
serum markers for eOA detection have been suggested -
disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
motifs (ADAMTS)-4, ADAMTS-5, matrix metallopro-
teinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-3 - but sensitivity and speci-
ficity was not reported [54]. The diagnostic performance
of the two-step algorithm herein improves significantly
on other current candidate biomarkers proposed for
early-stage arthritis [16, 55, 56].
Conclusions
There were characteristic profiles of protein oxidation, ni-
tration and glycation adducts in protein from synovial fluid
and plasma, and related oxidized, nitrated and glycated
amino acids, in good skeletal health and arthritis disease,
with changes in the latter associated with classification and
severity of disease. Combination of estimates of oxidized,
nitrated and glycated amino acids with hydroxyproline and
anti-CCP antibody status in plasma provided a biochemical
test of relatively high sensitivity and specificity for early-
stage diagnosis and typing of arthritic disease.
