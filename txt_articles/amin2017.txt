Clusters of unvaccinated children are particularly susceptible 
to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease1,2. Existing mes-
saging interventions demonstrate short-term success, but 
some may backfire and worsen vaccine hesitancy3. Values-
based messages appeal to core morality, which influences 
the attitudes individuals then have on topics like vaccina-
tion4–7. We must understand how underlying morals, not just 
attitudes, differ by hesitancy type to develop interventions 
that work with individual values. Here, we show in two cor-
relational studies that harm and fairness foundations are not 
significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy, but purity and 
liberty foundations are. We found that medium-hesitancy par-
ents were twice as likely as low-hesitancy parents to highly 
emphasize purity (adjusted odds ratio: 2.08; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.27–3.40). High-hesitancy respondents were twice 
as likely to strongly emphasize purity (adjusted odds ratio: 
2.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.39–3.31) and liberty (adjusted 
odds ratio: 2.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.50–3.21). Our 
results demonstrate that endorsement of harm and fair-
ness—ideas often emphasized in traditional vaccine-focused 
messages—are not predictive of vaccine hesitancy. This, com-
bined with significant associations of purity and liberty with 
hesitancy, indicates a need for inclusion of broader themes 
in vaccine discussions. These findings have the potential for 
application to other health decisions and communications 
 
as well.
Growing numbers of parents who request non-medical vac-
cine exemptions for their children indicate cause for concern about 
maintaining sufficiently high immunization coverage levels in the 
United States8–10. Although the trend appears to have stabilized and 
 
immunization coverage remains high overall11, the greater cause for 
concern is geographic clustering of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated 
 
children. When they are geographically clustered, partially or fully 
unvaccinated children are more susceptible to outbreaks of vac-
cine-preventable disease1,2, mainly because vaccine exemption rate 
levels are higher in these clusters than the overall state coverage lev-
els12–15. Parents of such children are classified as vaccine-hesitant; 
the different types of hesitancy are based on the type and strength 
of their concerns about vaccination16,17. Individual immunization 
behaviours range from total vaccine acceptance to total vaccine 
refusal, with attitudes towards general vaccination or a specific 
vaccine influencing acceptance. Many vaccine-hesitant individuals 
demonstrate nuanced attitudes towards immunization rather than 
 
dichotomous positive or negative attitudes18. Such individuals may 
accept some vaccines but refuse or delay others19,20. Individuals 
express their hesitancy in three ways: (1) receive all vaccines but 
express concerns about vaccination, (2) selectively delay or refuse 
vaccines or (3) refuse all vaccines18.
Several classification systems exist for categorizing parental 
attitudes towards vaccination and identifying different types or 
strengths of vaccine hesitancy21,22. Gust et al.17 identified five pro-
files of attitudes towards vaccination—the immunization advocate, 
the ‘go along to get along’ parents, the health advocate, the fence sit-
ter and the worried—based on a sample of parents with at least one 
child under seven years of age. Keane et al.23 classified parents using 
four groupings of vaccine attitudes: vaccine believers (those con-
vinced about the benefits of vaccinating), cautious parents (those 
who actively seek information about vaccines but may experience 
anxiety about getting their child vaccinated), relaxed parents (those 
with relaxed parenting styles and without a particularly strong atti-
tude towards vaccines) and unconvinced parents (those with the 
most negative attitudes towards vaccinations). A quantitative sys-
tem, developed by Opel et al.16,19, assesses hesitancy using three dif-
ferent constructs—immunization behaviours, beliefs about vaccine 
safety and efficacy, and general attitudes towards vaccines—and 
classifies individuals as low, medium or high hesitancy. The hesi-
tancy categories were validated against immunization behaviours. 
Children of medium-hesitancy parents were under-immunized 
for 14% more days than children with low-hesitancy parents, and 
children of high-hesitancy parents were under-immunized for 51% 
more days than those with low-hesitancy parents16. Another clas-
sification system, termed the 4C model and developed by Betsch, 
Böhm and Chapman24, classifies individuals based on the main rea-
son for non-vaccination. The four categorizations include compla-
cency (an individual believes vaccination is unnecessary due to a 
low perceived risk of disease), convenience (structural barriers pre-
vent follow-through on individual intent to vaccinate), confidence 
(individuals lack trust in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines and 
vaccine systems) and calculation (individuals lack strong attitudes 
about vaccination, weighing the perceived risk of vaccination and 
disease against each other). Because of the variation in drivers of 
vaccine hesitancy, well-informed communication in both health-
care practice settings and public campaigns is key to vaccine atti-
tude shift.
Overall, there are few evidence-based strategies to address vac-
cine hesitancy and even fewer based on quantitative evidence25.

hesitancy

Recent interventions have focused on vaccine knowledge and edu-
cation26,27 and message framing3,28 as methods to change vaccination 
attitudes. Most demonstrate short-term success, but some back-
fire and worsen parental hesitancy about vaccines3 or temporarily 
increase vaccination rates but may lead to long-term dissatisfaction 
and decreased intention to vaccinate28.
The apparent resistance of vaccine attitudes to interventions 
focused on education suggests that attitudes towards vaccines may 
instead be rooted in deeper intuitions that guide individual deci-
sions. Moral Foundations Theory was developed to identify the 
key dimensions of moral judgement and decision-making29,30. This 
theory proposes that a set of innate intuitions lead humans to cer-
tain emotional responses (for example, approval or disapproval) to 
particular interpersonal events. Early theoretical work on this topic 
proposed that people often quickly make moral decisions based 
on emotional, intuitive processes such as these and come up with 
post hoc reasons and justifications31. Subjects in past studies were 
unable to provide justifications for their decisions regarding moral 
dilemmas that elicited strong intuitive reactions, but stripped away 
rational bases for decisions guided by such reactions32,33. Attitudes 
towards vaccines may be similarly based in such intuitive processes.
Six foundations have been proposed: care/harm, authority/sub-
version, loyalty/betrayal, liberty/oppression, purity/degradation 
and fairness/cheating34,35. Reliance on these foundations is typically 
associated with approval of actions that uphold virtues and prac-
tices related to these foundations, vigilance against violations of 
the virtues and practices, and disapproval of such violations36. The 
care/harm foundation promotes virtues related to caring for oth-
ers and protecting them from harm. It also involves compassion 
for those who are vulnerable or suffering and anger towards those 
who harm others34. The authority/subversion foundation gives rise 
to concerns about respect for and obedience to authority, while the 
loyalty/betrayal foundation is associated with virtues of in-group 
loyalty, patriotism and sacrificing oneself for the group36. The lib-
erty/oppression foundation involves valuing individual freedom 
and liberties while resenting dominance by others35. Concerns with 
sanctity, chastity and avoiding contamination (spiritual and meta-
phorical) of oneself and one’s group stem from the purity/degrada-
tion foundation. This foundation is associated with disapproval of 
acts that are deemed ‘disgusting’ or ‘unnatural’
.
The extent to which each of the six moral foundations is used 
in moral judgments and decision-making varies by individual and 
across cultures. Early work has shown that differential endorsement 
of moral foundations can explain differences in political orienta-
tion where past attempts to explain political ideology with rational 
self-interest models had failed36. In this study, liberals rated the care 
versus harm and fairness versus cheating foundations as more rel-
evant to their moral judgements, whereas conservatives rated the 
authority versus subversion, loyalty versus betrayal and purity ver-
sus degradation foundations as more relevant. Moral foundations 
have since been associated with attitudes and attitudinal shift on 
topics as varied as climate change, suicide and philanthropy4–7,37,38. 
Differences in attitudes towards vaccination may similarly stem 
from differences in reliance on moral foundations.
Past research has demonstrated that framing persuasive mes-
sages using the moral foundations that underlie people’s attitudes 
and judgements can successfully change attitudes. For instance, 
one study found that conservatives were more persuaded to rec-
ognize the legitimacy of climate change and engage in conserva-
tion behaviours by messages framed using the moral foundations 
more strongly endorsed by conservatives (that is, purity, authority 
and loyalty: “Demonstrate your respect by following the examples 
of your religious and political leaders who defend America’s natu-
ral environment. SHOW YOUR PATRIOTISM”) than messages 
framed using those moral foundations more strongly endorsed by 
liberals (that is, care and fairness: “Do the right thing by preventing 
the suffering of all life-forms and making sure that no one is denied 
their right to a healthy planet. SHOW YOUR COMPASSION”)39. If 
vaccine hesitancy is indeed rooted in particular moral foundations, 
identifying which moral foundations are associated with vaccine 
hesitancy would provide a promising direction for the development 
of a values-based messaging intervention. More favourable attitudes 
towards vaccines may increase intention to vaccinate, ultimately 
increasing rates of immunization.
Research on the attitudes of vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-refus-
ing parents40 and on frequent claims of anti-vaccination websites41,42 
provides reason to suspect that some of the six moral foundations 
might relate to vaccine hesitancy. An opinion commonly expressed 
by these sources is that vaccines are unnatural and exposing chil-
dren to diseases ‘naturally’ to build up immunity is preferable. 
Anti-vaccination websites also often claim that vaccines contain 
‘contaminants’42. These concerns may be rooted in the purity moral 
foundation, with its emphasis on avoiding anything disgusting or 
unnatural. Another frequent message on anti-vaccine websites is 
that mandatory vaccination policies violate parental civil liberties42. 
The liberty foundation may be associated with such concerns about 
vaccine policy. Distrust of scientists and government officials who 
promote vaccinations is also common among people with unfa-
vourable vaccine attitudes and anti-vaccination websites40–42. This 
distrust may be associated with low reliance on the authority foun-
dation and its associated respect for and obedience to authority, or 
possibly high reliance on the liberty foundation and its resentment 
of perceived oppressors.
Other relationships between moral foundations and vaccine hes-
itancy are plausible as well. The care/harm foundation may under-
lie vaccine hesitancy to the extent that people are concerned about 
the harm that might result from vaccines, particularly if it affects 
vulnerable children. This foundation may also stimulate parents’ 
protective instincts regarding vaccination and disease. The fairness/
cheating foundation may fuel outrage in response to the percep-
tion that pharmaceutical companies motivated by profit have an 
unfair voice in vaccine policy42. However, these two foundations 
may also be linked with concerns among individuals with pro-
vaccine attitudes that unvaccinated children put others (particularly 
those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) at risk. The 
loyalty/betrayal foundation may be the least likely to be related to 
attitudes towards vaccines. However, it is important to assess all six 
moral foundations to determine which are associated with attitudes 
towards vaccines, as past research shows that it is often not read-
ily apparent which moral domains are relevant to one’s own judge-
ments on a given topic38. Moreover, since the moral foundation 
scales used in this study have been shown to correlate with each 
other36, assessing the strength of such associations when controlling 
for other moral foundations is also key.
Here, we present the results of direct investigations into the asso-
ciation of the values-based foundations of moral foundations theory 
with parental vaccine hesitancy. The first study included 1,007 con-
senting parents who met eligibility criteria and answered an online 
survey about moral foundations and vaccine attitudes. Individuals 
were eligible for the study if they resided in the United States, were 
between 18 and 50 years of age (inclusive) and had at least one child 
under the age of 13. Participants were 66.4% female. Most were 
between 18 and 40 years of age (76.6%) and had either one (40.1%) 
or two (36.1%) children (see Supplementary Table 1 for full demo-
graphics and Supplementary Fig. 1 for a participant flow diagram). 
Of the respondents, 73.0% were classified as low hesitancy accord-
ing to their Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines score, while 
approximately 11% were classified as medium hesitancy and 16% 
were classified as high hesitancy (see Supplementary Table 2 for 
demographics stratified by hesitancy).
We first developed an unconditional polytomous logistic regres-
sion model treating the degree of vaccine hesitancy (low, medium

or high) as the outcome of interest. The starting model contained 
predictor terms for all six moral foundations, age, gender, education 
and number of children. We also dichotomized the moral founda-
tion scores into high and low based on the mean study population 
score and age into 18–40 years and 41+ years. The rationale behind 
model choice and all categorizations can be found in the Methods. 
After stepwise backwards predictor elimination and confounding 
assessment for demographic terms, our final no-interaction model 
(model 1A) contained variables for all six moral foundations, edu-
cation and age. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CIs) calculated from this model can be seen in Fig. 1 (see 
Supplementary Table 3 for numerical values for all ORs, 95% CIs 
and P values for model 1A).
Medium-hesitancy parents were twice (adjusted OR (aOR): 2.08, 
95% CI: 1.27–3.40) as likely as low-hesitancy parents to place high 
emphasis on purity. High-hesitancy parents were also twice as likely 
as low-hesitancy parents to place high emphasis on purity (aOR: 
2.15, 95% CI: 1.39–3.31) and liberty (aOR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.50–3.21). 
Inversely, high-hesitancy parents were half as likely (aOR: 0.43, 95% 
CI: 0.27–0.67) as low-hesitancy parents to place high emphasis on 
respect for authority. The strengths of emphasis on harm and fair-
ness were not statistically significantly (P < 0.05) associated with 
the degree of vaccine hesitancy. To ensure categorization did not 
impact our statistical results, we conducted a multiple linear regres-
sion using the continuous versions of the outcome and predictors 
(except for education, which was initially categorical) included in 
model 1A. The statistical results from this linear regression support 
those from model 1A (see Supplementary Table 4 for all regression 
coefficients (β 
), standard errors (s.e.) and P values). Although we 
did not include political ideology in our starting model to avoid 
politicizing an as-yet non-partisan issue, we conducted a sensitiv-
ity analysis to see if its inclusion in model 1A greatly impacted our 
estimated ORs. We also conducted a similar analysis with gender, 
even though confounding assessment had indicated it did not need 
to be included. The ORs remained stable in both the political ideol-
ogy and gender analyses (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, respec-
tively, for all ORs, 95% CIs and P values).
We repeated our modelling methodology, this time also includ-
ing all two-way interaction terms in our starting model to explore 
possible differences in effect estimates across covariate categories. 
Our final interaction-containing model (model 1B) contained 
variables for all six moral foundations, age, education and a lib-
erty–age interaction term. The results from model 1B, shown in 
Fig. 2, reveal that the age group to which an individual belonged 
impacted the likelihood of high liberty foundation endorsement 
(see Supplementary Table 7 for numerical values for all ORs, 95% 
CIs and P values for this model).
Medium-hesitancy parents over the age of 40 were one-third 
(aOR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13–0.81) as likely as their low-hesitancy 
counterparts to place high emphasis on liberty; however, there was 
no statistically significant association for liberty in the younger par-
ents. High-hesitancy parents less than 40 years of age were two and 
a half (aOR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.59–3.87) times as likely as their low-
hesitancy counterparts to place high emphasis on liberty, although 
there was no statistically significant association for parents greater 
than 40 years of age. We then conducted a multiple linear regres-
sion using the continuous versions of the predictors and outcome 
for model 1B (see Supplementary Table 8 for all β 
 coefficients, stan-
dard errors and P values), as described previously for model 1A. 
The statistical results support most of those for model 1B, although 
the liberty–age interaction is no longer statistically significant. We

repeated the political ideology and gender sensitivity analyses, as 
described for model 1A, with model 1B. All but one of the estimated 
ORs remained stable in both analyses (see Supplementary Tables 9 
and 10 for all ORs, 95% CIs and P values for the ideology and gender 
analyses, respectively). The liberty estimate for parents > 40 years of 
age in the ideology analysis decreased (aOR: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.75–3.07) 
 
but remained statistically insignificant.
A second study, conducted independently of the first, validated 
the main findings of study 1. This study examined the relation-
ships between moral foundations, attitudes towards vaccines and 
beliefs about vaccines taken from previous research and content 
analyses of anti-vaccine websites. An additional goal was to deter-
mine whether vaccine-related purity- and liberty-themed violations 
uniquely mediated the influence of some foundations on vaccine 
attitudes more than others (for instance, if concerns about toxins 
in vaccines mediated potential relationships between the purity or 
harm foundations and overall attitudes).
Participants in study 2 were recruited from Amazon Mechanical 
Turk (MTurk) based on their responses to a previous demographic 
survey used to identify parents. Individuals were eligible for the 
study if they were at least 18 years of age, resided in the United States 
and had at least one child. The final sample for analysis included 
464 consented parents (see Supplementary Fig. 2 for a participant 
flow diagram). Respondents were 60.3% female and had a mean age 
of 42.3 years (ages ranged from 20 to 80). In total, 85% of partici-
pants had at least some college education and 73% had one or two 
children. This validation study did not stratify parental attitudes by 
level of hesitancy.
First, we developed a multiple regression model (model 2A) 
treating vaccine attitudes as the outcome of interest and included 
continuous variables for all six moral foundations, education and 
age. Both the purity (β 
: 0.06, s.e.: 0.01) and liberty (β 
: 0.03, s.e.: 0.01) 
foundations statistically significantly (P < 0.05) predicted vaccine 
attitudes (see Supplementary Table 11 for all β 
 coefficients, s.e. and 
P values for this model). Next, we tested for mediation of these rela-
tionships using the Hayes approach.
The first model testing mediation (model 2B) included the purity 
foundation as the predictor variable, vaccine-related purity- and lib-
erty-violation 
beliefs 
as 
mediator 
variables, 
and 
vaccine 
attitudes 
as 
the 
outcome variable. Including both purity- and liberty-violation beliefs 
as mediators allowed us to determine whether only purity-violation 
 
beliefs might explain the association between the purity founda-
tion and vaccine hesitancy or both purity- and liberty-violation 
 
beliefs mediated this association. The other five moral foundations, 
age and education were included as covariates. Model 2B, which 
is presented in Table 1, yielded evidence of an indirect (media-
tion) effect of purity on vaccine attitudes through both purity- 
 
(β 
: 0.03, s.e.: 0.007) and liberty-violation beliefs (β 
: 0.03, s.e.: 0.007).
The second model testing mediation (model 2C) included the 
liberty foundation as the predictor variable, vaccine-related purity- 
and liberty-violation beliefs as mediator variables, and vaccine 
attitudes as the outcome variable. Including both purity- and lib-
erty-violation beliefs as mediators allowed us to determine whether 
only liberty-violation beliefs explained the association between the 
liberty foundation and vaccine attitudes, or both purity- and liberty-
violation beliefs mediated this association. The other five moral 
foundations, age and education were included as covariates. Model 
2C, which is presented in Table 2, provided evidence of an indi-
rect (mediation) effect of liberty on vaccine attitudes through both 
purity- (β 
: 0.01, s.e.: 0.004) and liberty-violation beliefs (β 
: 0.01, 
 
s.e.: 0.006).
We demonstrated in our first study that several distinct values 
are associated with parental vaccine hesitancy. However, more 
foundations are significantly associated with high hesitancy than 
with medium hesitancy. For medium-hesitancy parents, the only 
association is high endorsement of purity, while high hesitancy is 
associated with high endorsement of both purity and liberty and 
low endorsement of authority. The influence of different genera-
tional values may also prove important, as younger high-hesitancy 
parents are more likely to highly endorse liberty. Although this 
age–liberty interaction is not statistically significant in the linearly 
regressed version of model 1B, we attribute this to the sparse data 
in each age–liberty score category (only 1,007 participants across 
1,023 possible age–liberty score combinations). The strength of 
the associations characterized in study 1 is not impacted by either 
gender or political ideology. This finding is particularly useful 
because, although moral foundations theory originally focused 
on explaining tribal political attitudes, our research supports that 
the association of moral foundations with vaccine attitudes tran-
scends political ideology. The phenomenon of political ideology 
not modifying the relationship between moral foundations and 
attitudes is not unique to vaccines. For example, a previous study 
demonstrated that moral foundations were predictive of victim-
blaming attitudes, even when controlling for ideology and right-
wing authoritarianism43.
Previous studies have focused on overt concerns cited by vaccine-
hesitant parents44. We demonstrate in our second study that these 
concerns are directly linked to purity and liberty moral founda-
tions. Past research has also found a connection between disgust 
and contamination concerns and negative vaccine attitudes45,46. The 
results from study 2 further elaborate on this work, as we found that 
high emphasis on the purity and liberty foundations is associated 
with vaccine beliefs directly tied to purity foundation violations 
(for example, vaccines contain poisons and toxins, while diseases 
like measles are natural). High emphasis on the liberty foundation 
is associated with vaccine beliefs directly tied to liberty foundation

violations (for example, vaccine mandates violate civil liberties 
and are excessive government control). These results demonstrate 
that vaccine purity- and liberty-violation beliefs mediate the rela-
tionship between purity and liberty foundations and vaccine atti-
tudes. These results also suggest that moral foundations may shape 
the beliefs one has about an attitude object in ways beyond those 
directly related to the moral foundation. For instance, the purity 
foundation may influence overall attitudes towards vaccines, which 
in turn promote beliefs that are in line with these attitudes—even 
beliefs that have seemingly little to do with purity. However, we can-
not determine causality with these studies alone.
We recognize there are a few limitations to this work, as the 
data were collected from an online convenience sample of parents 
and these results may be of limited generalizability. However, our 
claims are bolstered by the fact that purity and liberty were statisti-
cally significant predictors of vaccine attitudes in the second study, 
which was independently conducted with no contact between the 
researchers of the first and second studies until analysis of both sets 
of data had been completed. Other high-quality vaccine-focused 
studies have also been conducted using MTurk47, further support-
ing our decision. We are also unable to assess causality between 
moral foundations and vaccine hesitancy due to the cross-sectional 
nature of our studies, but our characterization of patterns in asso-
ciations suggests that a moral foundations approach should be 
further pursued to evaluate vaccine-focused messages that avoid 
a backfire effect.
Future interventions in vaccine attitudes may be similarly framed 
using the moral foundations associated with medium or high hesi-
tancy, as done previously with the moral foundations associated 
with political ideology39. Messages could present vaccine effects and 
importance couched in purity and liberty foundation-stimulating 
terms. Terminology (the Moral Foundations Dictionary)36, vignettes48 
and visual images (the Socio-Moral Image Database)49 have been 
tested for their stimulation of different foundations, although these 
resources are not specifically focused on vaccines. These resources 
could be used to develop interventions that describe the pros of vac-
cinating in foundation-framed messages or refute classic vaccine 
hesitations and negative attitudes using arguments framed in terms 
of the foundations the hesitation is based in. For example, an inter-
vention framed in terms of the purity foundation might read, ‘Boost 
your child’s natural defences against diseases! Keep your child pure 
of infections – Vaccinate!’ This message might show a picture of a 
child with measles. An intervention framed in terms of the liberty 
foundation might read, ‘Take personal control of your child’s health! 
Vaccinations can help your child and others be free to live a happy and 
healthy life’
, along with pictures of children playing. Messages could 
be displayed at public schools, libraries, doctors’ offices and even on 
the Internet, where parents frequently obtain information about vac-
cines and would likely encounter them42. However, it is important 
to note that the above messages are simple examples and have not 
been formally tested. Immunization programmes could also integrate 
such an approach into communications training for their personnel 
and educational modules for clinicians, as well as the development of 
foundation-framed talking points for quick reference.
Overall, this work quantifies the associations of moral foun-
dations with vaccine attitudes. These results indicate a promising 
direction for the development of messaging interventions formed by 
quantitative evidence and less reliant on cues from common sense. 
Our data also suggest that health decisions are, to some extent, 
linked with moral concerns. However, the extent to which moral 
foundations impact health decisions would need to be replicated in 
studies focused on other health behaviours. More importantly, this 
morals-based approach can easily be applied to other health deci-
sions and may provide a standardized, yet easily adaptable approach 
for public health interventions.
Methods
Study 1. Study population recruitment. After approval of the study protocol by 
the Emory University Institutional Review Board, parents of children under 13 
years of age were recruited online through MTurk. Due to the explorative nature 
of the work, we used the general guideline of between 10 and 30 observations 
(at minimum) per intended predictor and comparison50–52 to determine that we 
needed a minimum sample size of 600. A link to the survey was posted on the 
MTurk website, along with a brief description of the study and the associated 
monetary compensation if individuals were eligible and completed the survey. 
However, we did not include any eligibility criteria in the MTurk posting to prevent 
individuals from fraudulently gaining access to the survey. Interested respondents 
answered a brief series of screening questions to ensure that they met eligibility  
criteria (between 18 and 50 years of age, resident of the United States and at least 
one child under 13 years of age). Screening questions were phrased to prevent 
participants from guessing which demographic groups we were recruiting.  
We explicitly stated that participants would not be paid for answering screening 
questions and we also prevented the same IP address from accessing the survey 
more than once. These measures were implemented to prevent ineligible 
individuals from answering the screening questions multiple times to fraudulently 
participate. Eligible individuals then saw a consent form displayed and were 
required to answer a question asking if they consented to taking part in the study. 
Only individuals who selected ‘Yes’ when asked if they were willing to take part in 
the study were allowed to answer the remainder of the survey questions.
Survey instrument. The survey was developed based on the Parent Attitudes about 
Childhood Vaccines short scale, Moral Foundations Questionnaire and Liberty 
Foundation Questionnaire. The five-item Parent Attitudes about Childhood 
Vaccines short scale was the vaccine hesitancy outcome analysed in this study. 
The Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines short scale contained five items, 
each answered on a three-point scale (‘Yes’
, ‘No’ or ‘Don’t know’
, or ‘Hesitant’
, 
‘Not hesitant’ or ‘Not sure’
, depending on the item) within three categories: 
vaccine behaviours, attitudes about vaccine safety and efficacy, and general health 
attitudes16,53.
The 30-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire contained items on a 6-point 
Likert scale designed to capture each moral foundation construct29 (sample items 
in Supplementary Table 12). Questions asked about the relevance of the statement

when determining whether something was right or wrong and the importance of 
the presented consideration when making decisions. Answers ranged from ‘Not 
at all relevant’ to ‘Extremely relevant’ for relevance questions, and from ‘Strongly 
disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’ for judgement questions. The nine-item Liberty 
Foundation Questionnaire used similar questions to assess the liberty foundation35. 
This scale was developed after the original five-foundation Moral Foundations 
Questionnaire35. Two previously validated attention checks asked the respondents 
to rate how relevant someone’s ability to do mathematics was to judging whether 
something was right or wrong (acceptable answers included ‘Not at all’ to 
‘Somewhat’) and how much they agreed with the statement ‘It is better to do good 
than to do bad’ (acceptable answers ranged from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Strongly agree’). 
These items checked whether participants were paying attention and responding 
meaningfully, as the selection of ‘unacceptable’ answers reflected careless answering 
of the survey. This check was performed in keeping with previous work48. The 
collected demographic information included each respondent’s age, number of 
children, level of education, gender and political ideology.
Scoring and cleaning data. Survey data were analysed using SAS 9.4 (32 bit, English) 
software (SAS Institute; https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/sas9.html).  
Respondents who failed either of the two attention checks in the survey were 
removed from the analysis. The Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines items 
were each scored on a scale of zero to two points, with a summary score ranging 
from zero to ten. For all but one item, ‘Yes’ and ‘Hesitant’ answers received two 
points, ‘Don’t Know’ answers received one point and ‘No’ and ‘Not hesitant’ 
answers received zero points. The ‘I trust the information I receive about shots’ 
item was reverse-scored (‘Yes’ = 0, ‘Don’t know’ = 1 and ‘No’ = 2). Summary 
scores were then categorized into level of vaccine hesitancy: low hesitancy (0–4), 
medium hesitancy (5–6) and high hesitancy (7–10) in keeping with previous work 
done with this scale53, which also demonstrated significant differences in under-
vaccination at these cutpoints16.
Moral Foundations and Liberty Foundation Questionnaire items were scored 
on a 0–5 scale. For relevance questions, ‘Not at all relevant’ answers received zero 
points, with each sequential answer receiving one point more than the previous, 
all the way through to five points for an ‘Extremely relevant’ answer. Judgement 
questions followed a similar pattern, with ‘Strongly disagree’ answers receiving 
zero points and ‘Strongly agree’ answers receiving five points. Thus, moral 
foundation scores ranged from 0 to 30 for each foundation except liberty, as these 
foundations each had six total items. The liberty summary score initially ranged 
from 0 to 45 due to the three additional items and was linearly scaled down to 
range from 0 to 30 to allow direct comparison with other constructs. All moral 
foundation summary scores were dichotomized into low or high endorsement 
based on the mean sample score for each of the foundations. This was done so 
that any significant associations could be easily used in a clinical setting. All 
sociodemographic variables were categorized based on the response options 
except for age. Age was dichotomized into 18–40 years and 41+ years based on 
exploratory linear regressions with each foundation score that demonstrated a 
potential interaction between age and liberty. This categorization further allowed 
for clinical application of any potential results. Categories for number of children 
included one, two, three, four and five or more. Categories for level of education 
included high school level education at most, some college-level education, 
college degree, some graduate-level education, and graduate degree. Categories for 
political ideology included liberal, moderate, conservative, libertarian and other/
don’t know.
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics for the distribution of age, number of 
children, education, gender, political ideology and high versus low foundation 
endorsement were calculated (reported in Supplementary Table 1). All 
characteristics except high versus low foundation endorsement were compared by 
hesitancy category using Fisher’s exact tests with a Monte Carlo simulation due to 
the prohibitive computational time without this simulation (see Supplementary 
Table 2 for results). We also calculated standardized Cronbach’s alphas (reported 
in Supplementary Table 13) for each of the six moral foundation constructs. 
A logistic model was then created to investigate associations of the six moral 
foundations with each Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines hesitancy 
category. No significant deviations from model assumptions were observed. We 
used unconditional polytomous logistic regression models due to the exploratory 
nature of the work, as we did not want to artificially impose a proportional odds 
assumption required to conduct an ordinal logistic regression on the hesitancy 
categories. Thus, hesitancy category was treated as a nominal categorical variable. 
The scores for each moral foundation were treated as dichotomous categorical 
variables. Age, number of children, gender and education were included as 
covariates of interest in the first starting model. Confounding was assessed using 
an all-possible-subsets approach on covariates eligible for removal (that is, those 
not statistically significant). Covariates whose removal did not result in more than 
a 10% change in OR estimates were removed to yield the most parsimonious no-
interaction model (reported in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). All originally 
continuous terms in the final model were returned to their continuous form to 
verify that categorization did not impact the statistical results of the terms in the 
model and a multiple linear regression was conducted (reported in Supplementary 
Table 4). We also conducted sensitivity analyses for both political ideology and 
gender (reported in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, respectively). This entailed 
adding the parameter of interest to the finalized model and assessing whether OR 
estimates meaningfully changed (defined as a change of more than 10% from the 
finalized model’s estimate).
In the second starting model, interaction terms were also included to assess any 
difference in the magnitude of effect at the low and high level of moral foundation 
endorsement due to these covariates. Backwards elimination was then performed 
on the interaction terms, with the significance level for elimination set at P < 0.05. 
Removal of all non-significant interaction terms produced the fully adjusted model 
used as the gold standard for the assessment of confounding by the covariates 
of interest. Confounding was assessed using an all-possible-subsets approach 
on covariates eligible for removal (that is, those not featured in any statistically 
significant interaction terms or those not statistically significant). Covariates whose 
removal did not result in more than a 10% change in OR estimates were removed 
to yield the most parsimonious interaction-containing model (reported in Fig. 2 
and Supplementary Table 7). All originally continuous terms in the final model 
were returned to their continuous form to verify that categorization did not impact 
the statistical results of the terms in the model and a multiple linear regression was 
conducted (reported in Supplementary Table 8). Again, we conducted sensitivity 
analyses for both political ideology and gender (reported in Supplementary 
Tables 9 and 10, respectively). This entailed adding the parameter of interest to the 
finalized model and assessing whether the OR estimates meaningfully changed 
(defined as a change of more than ~10% from the finalized model’s estimate).
Study 2. Study population recruitment. After approval of the study protocol by 
the Loyola University Chicago Institutional Review Board, parents were recruited 
through MTurk using a previous demographics survey used to identify parents 
who were at least 18 years of age and a resident of the United States. We aimed to 
recruit about 500 parents, over-powering our study to detect a small effect. After 
viewing the consent form and clicking a button to indicate informed consent, 
participants completed the 30-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire and the 
9-item Liberty Foundation Questionnaire. They were then randomly assigned to 
view obituaries depicting hypothetical deaths due to either complications from 
vaccines or vaccine-preventable illnesses. Participants rated their disgust and 
outrage towards these deaths. The purpose of the obituary manipulation was to 
increase anti-vaccination attitudes in the vaccine-complication condition and 
decrease anti-vaccination attitudes in the vaccine-preventable illness condition 
to ensure sufficient variability in attitudes towards vaccines to detect potential 
relationships with any of the moral foundations. The manipulation was not 
designed to manipulate moral foundations, nor was it designed to manipulate 
message frames targeting different moral foundations. The type of obituary 
participants viewed had no appreciable effect on any outcomes; therefore, the 
obituary manipulation is not discussed. Participants then completed measures 
of vaccine purity-violation beliefs and vaccine liberty-violation beliefs. Finally, 
participants completed items assessing general vaccine attitudes (see below for 
more details).
Survey instrument. The survey featured the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, 
Liberty Foundation Questionnaire and two attention checks as described in 
study 1. Participants then completed measures of vaccine beliefs and attitudes 
based on past research. For example, negative attitudes towards vaccines among 
parents were linked to beliefs that vaccines are unsafe, ineffective or unnecessary 
to prevent diseases54. Content analyses of anti-vaccine website claims identified 
similar themes concerning the safety, effectiveness or necessity of vaccines42,55. 
Many anti-vaccination websites often claim that vaccines contain poisons or 
are unnatural, with other claims focused more on vaccine policy (for example, 
mandatory vaccinations in public schools as violations of civil liberties) than 
vaccines themselves. Borrowing items from a previous survey and analyses of anti-
vaccination website claims42,54,55, we created measures of vaccine purity-violation 
beliefs (for example, ‘Vaccines contain poisons/toxins/contaminants’), vaccine 
liberty-violation beliefs (for example, ‘Vaccine mandates are excessive government 
control’) and general vaccine attitudes (for example, ‘Children should get vaccines 
on a delayed schedule’) to explore how these beliefs mediated the influence of 
different moral foundations on vaccine attitudes. Demographic questions included 
age, gender and education.
Scoring and data cleaning. Survey data were analysed using IBM SPSS 21 (http://
www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032236) and the PROCESS 
macro for SPSS (http://www.processmacro.org/index.html). Respondents who 
were non-parents and those who failed to answer one or more questions were 
removed from the analysis. The Moral Foundations Questionnaire was scored as 
described in study 1. Scoring of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and Liberty 
Foundation Questionnaire was done as described for study 1. A programming 
error resulted in exclusion of the items ‘Chastity is an important and valuable 
virtue’ from the purity scale and ‘One of the worst things a person could do is hurt 
a defenceless animal’ from the harm scale. Thus, the fairness, loyalty and authority 
scales each had six items, as in study 1. Moral foundation scores ranged from 0 to 
30, except the liberty foundation scores, which ranged from 0 to 45. Items assessing

vaccine purity-violation beliefs (n = 7), vaccine liberty-violation beliefs (n = 7) and 
general vaccine attitudes (n = 6) were separately averaged to create summary scores 
for each construct. Values for each construct ranged from 1 to 7.
Statistical analysis. Cronbach’s alphas (reported in Supplementary Table 12) for 
moral foundation constructs, vaccine purity- and liberty-violation beliefs and 
general vaccine attitudes were calculated. A multiple regression model (reported 
in Supplementary Table 11) was created to investigate the associations of the six 
moral foundations with the three constructs of interest: vaccine purity-violation 
beliefs, vaccine liberty-violation beliefs and vaccine attitudes. The six moral 
foundations were regressed on vaccine attitudes, with age and level of education 
as covariates. Hayes mediation analyses were conducted to test for mediation 
using the PROCESS macro56. The first mediation analysis (reported in Table 1) 
included the purity foundation as the predictor variable, vaccine purity-violation 
beliefs and liberty-violation beliefs as mediator variables, and vaccine attitudes 
as the outcome variable. The other five moral foundations, age and education 
were included as covariates. The second mediation analysis (reported in Table 2) 
included the liberty foundation as the predictor variable, vaccine purity-violation 
beliefs and liberty-violation beliefs as mediator variables, and vaccine attitudes as 
the outcome variable. The other five moral foundations, age and level of education 
were again included as covariates. Before the primary analyses, data were examined 
for violations of assumptions of the statistical tests conducted (that is, multiple 
regression). Visual inspection of quantile–quantile plots and histograms suggested 
that the data were approximately normally distributed, including the regression 
residuals, and no significant deviations from any other assumptions were observed.

Editorial Policy Checklist   
�    �Experimental design�
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
Study 1: Due to the explorative nature of the work, we used the general guideline of 
between 10 and 30 observations (at minimum) per intended predictor and 
comparison to determine that we needed a minimum sample size of 600.  
Study 2: We aimed to recruit about 500 parents, over-powering our study to detect 
a small effect.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
Study 1: Data were excluded if participants were ineligible based on pre-established 
eligibility criteria, declined to participate, did not complete all questions, did not 
follow instructions, or failed the included attention checks. These criteria were pre-
established. 
Study 2: Data were excluded if participants did not complete all questions, provided 
demographic information that contradicted the information they provided earlier, 
did not return to complete the main survey, or failed the included attention checks.
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
The main results from Study 1 were reasonably replicated in Study 2. In both 
studies, purity and liberty were statistically significant.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Participants were not allocated into experimental groups, as these studies were 
observational in nature. Study 2 participants were randomly assigned to view 
obituaries depicting hypothetical deaths due to either complications from vaccines 
or vaccine-preventable illnesses.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to group 
allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
As no group allocation occurred during data collection or analysis in Study 1, 
blinding is not relevant to these studies. Study 2 investigators were not blinded to 
obituary group allocation.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.

12. Description of human research participants
Describe the covariate-relevant population characteristics 
of the human research participants.
Study 1: Participants were 66.4% female. Most were between 18 and 40 years of 
age (76.6%) and had either one (40.1%) or two (36.1%) children. 
Study 2: Respondents were 60.3% female and had a mean age of 42.3 years (ages 
ranged from 20 to 80).  Eighty-five percent of participants had at least some college 
education and 73% had one or two children.
