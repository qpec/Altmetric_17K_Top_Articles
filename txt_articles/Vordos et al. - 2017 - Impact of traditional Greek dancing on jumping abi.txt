Introduction
Cardiac rehabilitation programmes contribute to the manage-
ment of cardiovascular disease and reduce all-cause and car-
diac mortality and morbidity.1,2 Rehabilitation is a complex 
form of intervention that may include a variety of therapeutic 
approaches, such as psychological support, appropriate die-
tary instructions and education. Exercise training is a major 
component of rehabilitation and has been consistently dem-
onstrated to improve functional capacity and the quality of 
life of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).2–10 Specifi- 
cally, the combination of aerobic, flexibility and resistance 
exercise in a training programme brings multiple benefits by 
improving all the parameters of physical fitness.11,12

Abstract
Aims: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a training programme based on traditional Greek dance 
on the jumping ability, muscle strength and lower limb endurance in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
Patients and methods: Forty Greek patients with CHF graded as NYHA ⩽ II and aged 73.2±4.7 years were randomly 
divided into two groups. Group A (n=20) participated in a three-month physical rehabilitation programme based on 
Greek traditional dances, whereas group B (n=20) remained untrained and served as the control group. All patients 
were studied before and after the 12-week exercise training programme. At baseline and follow-up the exercise capacity 
of the patients was evaluated by the six-minute walking test, their lower extremity muscle strength was evaluated 
by an isokinetic dynamometer and their jumping ability by the Myotest-Pro test, which includes three types of jumps 
(plyometric, countermovement and squat jumps).
Results: No significant difference was observed between the two groups at the baseline evaluation. At follow-up, group 
A showed significant improvements in walking distance calculated from the six-minute walking test (10.0% improvement; 
p<0.05), in lower limb strength (10.32% improvement; p<0.05), and in countermovement jump speed (6.9%; p<0.05) and 
squat jump speed (5.8%; p<0.05). Group A also increased their jump plyometry height by 13.86% (p<0.05), their counter 
jump height by 10.68% (p<0.05) and their squat jump height by 10.45% (p<0.05). Group A had a 6.85% (p<0.05) increased 
force of counter jump compared with group B.
Conclusion: The design and implementation of cardiac rehabilitation programmes using Greek traditional dances in 
patients with CHF are both safe and effective in improving lower limb function.

The reduced or limited participation of patients in 
rehabilitation programmes creates serious concerns. 
Dancing is considered to be an alternative form of exer-
cise that can attract patients to participate in training pro-
grammes and also results in beneficial effects on balance, 
strength and cardiovascular function. Furthermore, it is a 
complicated form of motor activity, which combines leg 
movements with different types of bounces, squats, speed 
and swings with rhythmic alterations.13,14 Greek tradi-
tional dances are a pleasant and enjoyable activity and, 
combined with music and the variety of moves, contrib-
ute to socialization and a reduction in anxiety and mild 
depression, in addition to improving quality of life and 
providing multiple benefits in patients with chronic 
health disorders.13–17
In Greece, traditional dances represent the culture of 
the country and are a popular activity among both young 
and older people. There are different styles of dances 
from the different Greek islands and communities, 
reflecting local history and customs. Greek dancing has 
a major social role in bringing people and communities 
together during celebrations such as Easter or local fes-
tivals, and during family events – for example, wed-
dings. It has been shown that this form of activity has a 
positive impact on the functional capacity and psycho-
logical condition of people with chronic disease.13,18 
However, the use of traditional dancing as an interven-
tion in cardiac rehabilitation programmes has not been 
well established and needs further investigation. Thus 
the aim of this study was to evaluate a cardiac rehabilita-
tion programme with Greek traditional dances as the 
main component as an alternative form of exercise. The 
effects of dancing on jumping ability, muscular strength 
and endurance of the lower extremities and also the rela-
tionship between these variables were investigated in 
patients with CHF.
Methods
Sample
Eighty-four patients with CHF, randomly selected from a 
list, were initially approached to participate in the study. 
Forty-four of these patients were later excluded from the 
study: 18 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 26 declined 
to participate. The final sample consisted of 40 people aged 
73.2±4.7 years with CHF (NYHA score ⩽ II) recruited 
through The Elderly Open Care Centre, Thessaloniki, 
Greece. The study met the criteria in the CONSORT guide-
lines (Figure 1). Twenty-four patients were classified as 
NYHA class I and 16 patients as NYHA class II. Patients 
belonging to NYHA class III or IV were excluded from the 
study as a result of difficulties in intervention. The left ven-
tricular ejection fraction was estimated by echocardiography 
to be between 42 and 47%. Patients who had contraindica-
tions for exercise, such as unstable angina, recent myocardial 
infarction, conduction disorders (third degree atrioventricu-
lar block), moderate to severe aortic stenosis, acute pericar-
ditis or myocarditis, resting systolic blood pressure ⩾200 
mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ⩾100 mmHg, postural 
hypotension >20 mmHg, ST segment depression >2 mm, 
recent embolism, thrombophlebitis, insulin-dependent dia-
betes mellitus and severe neurological or orthopaedic prob-
lems were excluded from the study.
None of the patients had participated in any form of 
exercise during the past year. The patients were asked to 
abstain from any other form of recreational or systematic 
exercise during the study period and were required to 
have achieved least 80% attendance in the exercise inter-
vention programme to be included in the analysis. The 
final sample consisted of 40 patients with CHF who were 
randomly assigned to a dance group (group A, 13 men 
and seven women) or to a control group (group B, 14 men 
and six women). Patients in group A followed a 12-week 
exercise training programme, while patients in group B 
did not follow any exercise intervention and were asked 
to perform normal daily activities and continue their sed-
entary lifestyle.
All patients were informed about the purpose and 
procedures of the study and completed a written informed 
consent form before participation according to the ethi-
cal committee and recommendations of the Aristotle 
University of Thessaloniki.
Study design
The study was a randomized controlled trial. At the begin-
ning and end of the three-month study protocol, all patients 
underwent a physical examination, functional capacity 
assessment, and measurements for jumping ability, 
strength and endurance of their lower extremities. The 
validity and reliability of the equipment used to evaluate 
the patients were certified by the manufacturers.
Devices and process measurements
The six-minute walking test19 was applied to evaluate the 
muscle endurance of the patients’ lower limbs. To assess 
the strength of the lower limbs, a leg–chest dynamometer 
was used.20 Three measurements were performed using a 
Myotest-Pro21–23 (Myotest, Switzerland) dynamometer 
and the average value was used to estimate the jumping 
ability of the patients by measuring their jump height, the 
contact time of their foot with the ground, and their 
strength and speed during jumps. Three tests were applied. 
The first test consisted of three consecutive plyometric 
jumps (PJs) and the average jump height (in centimetres) 
and contact time of the patients’ foot with the ground (in 
milliseconds) were recorded. The second and third tests 
included three consecutive countermovement (CMJ) and 
squat (SJ) jumps, respectively, and recorded the average of 
 152 
European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 16(2)
the jump height and the average strength and speed of the 
jumps. An audible alarm from Myotest-Pro was used dur-
ing testing to initiate and execute valid jumps in conjunc-
tion with confirmation from the researcher, as there was a 
possibility of impaired hearing in these older patients.
The PJ test began by moving from the upright position 
with hands on hips and legs stretched. In the CMJ, the 
patients began moving from the upright position with 
hands on hips and legs stretched and then, with a continu-
ous motion, the patients bent their legs into a squat posi-
tion and performed the jump. The SJs began by moving 
from a squat position followed by the jump.
Exercise training protocol
The patients in group A followed a three-month exercise 
training programme conducted at three municipal gyms, 
consisting of three 40–65 min weekly sessions. The 
warm-up in each session lasted about 10 minutes and 
included walking on a treadmill and aerobic exercises, 
accompanied by stretching exercises to prepare the muscu-
loskeletal system of the patients for the main part of the 
session. The main part of the session lasted for 30–45 min-
utes and mainly consisted of Greek traditional dances. In 
the first four weeks of the training programme the duration 
and intensity of the dances were progressively increased, 
while in the following weeks until the end of the pro-
gramme the intensity remained constant. The last part of 
each session consisted of a 10-minute recovery period with 
stretching and relaxing exercises.
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed with the Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) version 20.0 
software for Windows. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test

was used to test the normality of the distribution. 
Differences in distance, muscular strength, jump height 
(PJ, CMJ and SJ), contact time, force and speed between 
and within the two groups at baseline and at the end of the 
programme were evaluated by two-way ANOVA with 
repeated measures using main effects analysis and the syn-
tax of SPSS, with time and group being the independent 
variables. Pearson correlation analysis was used to investi-
gate the relationship between these variables. Variables 
were expressed as mean±SD values. A two-tailed p-value 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
The total attendance of patients in group A at the training 
sessions was 91.25% (p<0.05). Table 1 gives the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the patients who 
completed the study.
Analysis of variance showed that overall there was a sig-
nificant effect of factor time (F(19, 13)=10.028, p=0.000, 
η2=0.936, power=1.000), group (F(19, 13)=3.004, p=0.024, 
η2=0.815, power=0.883) and a significant time × group inter-
action (F(19, 13)=5.093, p=0.002, η2=0.882, power=0.991) 
at the examined variables.
At the start of the programme there was no significant 
difference between the two groups with respect to anthropo-
metric characteristics (weight, height, body mass index), 
clinical cardiac parameters (arterial blood pressure, heart 
rate) or functional tests. Table 2 presents the results for the 
six-minute walking test, strength of lower limbs and jump-
ing ability. Group A showed significant improvements in 
walking distance (10.0%; p<0.05), lower limb strength 
(10.3%; p<0.05), PJ height (13.9%; p<0.05), CMJ height 
(10.7%; p<0.05) and SJ height (10.5%; p<0.05). Moreover, 
the contact time of the PJs and the force of the CMJs were 
improved by 9.4% (p<0.05) and 9.6% (p<0.05), respec-
tively. Group A also showed an increased speed in the CMJs 
and SJs of 6.9% (p<0.05) and 5.8% (p<0.05), respectively. 
Group B showed no statistically significant difference 
between the initial and final measurements. Table 3 gives 
the factor effects at the variables of the study and the statisti-
cal indexes of variance analysis (F, p, η2, power).
Following the three-month training programme, the 
strength of lower limbs in group A was correlated with PJ 
(r=0.79, p<0.01), CMJ (r=0.83; p<0.01) and SJ (r=0.86; p 
<0.01).
Discussion
This study design included a centre-based form of cardiac 
rehabilitation. This form of exercise seems to be effective in 
improving clinical and health-related quality of life out-
comes in patients with CHF included in a short term trial.24 
The main finding of this study was that a 12-week cardiac 
rehabilitation programme with Greek traditional dances had 
a beneficial effect on jumping ability, muscular strength and 
endurance of the lower limbs in elderly patients with CHF.
Dance belongs to the category of exercise characterized by 
weight transfer because it is a complex physical activity with 
a variety of movements, speeds and vertical displacements.14 
Greek dancing seems to affect the functional capacity of 
patients through several mechanisms. The improvements in 
physical fitness parameters such as strength, maximum heart 
rate, VO2 peak and balance13 depend on the type of dance. In 
their study, Pitsi et al.14 classified Greek traditional dances 
according to maximum heart rate (HRmax) achieved as fol-
lows: eight dances corresponded to 53–63% of HRmax, nine 
dances to 64–69% of HRmax and nine dances to 74–86% of 
HRmax. Thus some dances seem to increase mostly aerobic 
capacity, causing adaptations in heart rate and maximum oxy-
gen uptake, while others that include jumps and swings of the 
body affect aerobic capacity, strength and jumping ability.
The results of this study showed that Greek traditional 
dancing improves strength, endurance and jumping ability, 
resulting in strengthening of the musculoskeletal system of 
the lower limbs. As a consequence of these effects, patients 
were able to act more independently and effectively with 
respect to the challenges of their daily life, such as walk-
ing, climbing stairs and reducing or limiting falls, resulting 
in an improvement in their quality of life.13–17

The improvement in cardiorespiratory endurance was 
lower than in the study of Kaltsatou et al.13 in which the 
intervention lasted for eight months. The latter study found 
a greater improvement (20.5%) attributed to the longer 
duration of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. Other 
studies have reported similar results to our study in the six-
minute walking test following an eight-week rehabilitation 
programme.15,25 The improvement in the walking test is 
assigned to cardiorespiratory and muscular adaptations 
after exercise training activities.3
A previous study has demonstrated an improvement in 
the maximum force of the lower limbs.13 However, this 
was lower in our study, possibly as a result of the shorter 
training programme. Our results were similar those 
obtained in the study of Maiorana et al.26 during a 
12-week follow-up exercise training programme. The 
mechanisms responsible for the augmentation of the 
lower limb strength caused by dancing may include an 
increase of muscle mass, oxidative capacity and periph-
eral blood flow.27
The jumping ability in older people with heart failure has 
not previously been evaluated. It must not be considered 
negligible as it is one of the main components of physical 
condition, along with strength, endurance, speed and flexi-
bility.27 In our study, the jump height of the three types of 
jump (PJ, CMJ, SJ) was improved by the end of the training 
programme, showing that Greek dances have a positive 
effect on jumping ability in patients with CHF, probably due 
to strengthening of their leg muscles, especially the gastroc-
nemius and quadriceps muscles. Furthermore, the contact 
time as measured by the PJs and the speed and force as esti-
mated by performing the CMJs were also increased. The 
lower increase in the force estimated by the SJs could be 
attributed to the difficulty of the test.

The higher increase in PJs may be explained by the sim-
ple procedure of the test and the efficiency of the gastroc-
nemius muscle. The increase in CJs compared with the SJs 
can be explained by the different starting positions, com-
bined with the storage and reutilization of elastic energy.28 
This was evidenced by the significant correlation between 
the improved force of the lower limbs with the jump height 
and the power of execution observed in this study.
This study had several limitations. These were the short 
time period of the programme and a sample size that did not 
allow further comparison between patients with CHF NYHA 
FC I and NYHA FC II. Considering the positive aspects of 
Greek traditional dancing in patients with CHF, another limi-
tation was the lack of data about anxiety and depression, as 
they did not meet the purpose of the study. However, the 
results of this study support the positive influence of dancing 
on the functional capacity of lower limbs in patients with 
CHF, leading to an improvement in neuromuscular coordina-
tion that may reduce the risk of falls and musculoskeletal 
injuries. An exercise rehabilitation programme based on 
Greek traditional dances is an alternative type of exercise 
that may attract the participation of more patients. The ben-
eficial functional effects help patients with CHF to operate 
independently and more efficiently in their daily life and 
activities. Therefore we suggest without reservation the 
design and implementation of cardiac rehabilitation pro-
grammes with Greek traditional dances as the main form of 
exercise training. These programmes will produce similar 
results to those in patients following a formal exercise pro-
gramme, contribute to the modernization of cardiac rehabili-
tation programmes and increase the attendance of patients.
Implications for practice
•
•
Jumping ability was measured in patients 
with chronic heart failure following a short 
exercise programme that included tradi-
tional Greek dances.
•
•
This research is particularly important 
because it fills a knowledge gap about the 
influence of dance on the functional capacity 
of the lower limbs and its ability to achieve 
better neuromuscular assembly and to reduce 
falls and musculoskeletal injuries.
•
•
Including dance in an exercise programme is an 
alternative way to deal with the problems caused 
by abstinence and reduced interest in exercise.
•
•
The beneficial functional effects help 
patients with chronic heart failure to oper-
ate autonomously and more efficiently in 
their daily activities.
•
•
Dance contributes to the modernization of car-
diac rehabilitation programmes and is a valua-
ble tool for physical education teachers, doctors 
and patients with chronic heart failure.
