Abstract  
The problem of retained surgical bodies (RSB) after surgery is an issue for surgeons, hospitals and 
the entire medical team. They have potentially harmful consequences for the patient as they can be 
life threatening and usually, a further operation is necessary. The incidence of RSB is between 0.3 
to 1.0 per 1,000 abdominal operations, and they occur due to a lack of organisation and 
communication between surgical staff during the process. Typically, the RSB are surgical sponges 
and instruments located in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and pelvis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Retained surgical bodies (RSB) are any 
foreign bodies left inside the patient after the 
operation and in general, a further procedure is 
necessary. The consequence of foreign bodies after 
surgery may manifest in different forms immediately 
after the operation, months or even years after the 
surgical procedure. With more than 28 million 
operations performed nationwide, the number of 
cases in which foreign bodies are left behind during a 
procedure in the United States has been estimated at 
around 1500 cases per year [1, 2]. Surgery is 
challenging, with the risk of retained surgical bodies 
increasing particularly in complicated cases such as 
obese patients or trauma requiring the use of 
numerous 
instruments, 
retractors 
and 
surgical 
sponges. During surgery, systems are in place to 
create a safe environment for the patient while the 
surgeon 
works 
with sponges and instruments; 
however, they are not impervious to human error. 
Commonly, the discovery of the foreign 
bodies after surgery occurs due to non-specific 
complaints. The retained bodies can present as a 
mass usually in the abdominal cavity and are 
diagnosed during a routine radiological examination. If 
patients complain in the period after the operation of 
pain, frequent infections and a palpable mass, this 
would suggest the presence of retained surgical 
bodies. 
Regarding the type of RSB, sponges are the 
most many foreign bodies retained in the human body 
after surgery, being located in body cavities such as 
the abdomen, pelvis and retroperitoneal space. 
These sponges may remain in the body for days, 
months or 
even 
years before 
manifesting 
as 
inflammatory reactions. When retained bodies are 
suspected, diagnosis must be confirmed by computed 
tomography (CT) [3]. In addition, surgical instruments 
such as clamps, retractors, electrodes or drains can 
be left behind after operations, especially in the 
abdominal cavity [4]. Instruments made of stainless 
steel, like retractors, may evoke minimal reactions but

all foreign bodies have the potential to cause pain, 
obstruction, ileus or abscess. According to the 
literature, approximately 80% of cases diagnosed with 
RSB are those in which the number of declared 
materials was correct at the end of the operation [5, 
6]. Good communication inside the operating room is 
essential for minimal errors during surgery. The 
retention of RSF after surgery has medical and legal 
implications, occurring as a result of mistakes by the 
entire medical team, not just the surgeon. 
Before 
every 
operation 
instruments 
are 
counted by the scrub nurse and as a standard 
procedure,  they are counted at the end of the 
procedures to ensure that they have all been 
accounted for, and nothing has been left behind in 
the patient. Counting instruments during operations is 
difficult, especially during emergency surgery such as 
abdominal trauma, in which the whole team is 
engaged in treating the patient. 
 
 
Clinical manifestation of retained surgical 
bodies after surgical procedure 
 
The RSB can manifest differently depending 
on their location and the type of material. They can 
remain in the nose, inside of the tracheobronchial 
tree, 
retroperitoneal space, 
uterus, and spine; 
however, 
they 
are 
commonly 
located 
in 
the 
abdominal cavity. RSB inside the abdominal cavity 
can produce pain, abdominal tumours that can raise 
suspicions 
for 
malignant 
mass, 
intraabdominal 
abscess, obstructive ileus, intestinal perforation, 
gastrointestinal fistula, bleeding and can migrate 
transmurally [7]. 
They 
can 
clinically 
manifest 
as 
acute 
reactions like an inflammatory response, infection or 
abscess within days or weeks after the operation. 
Furthermore, retained surgical foreign bodies inside 
the body cavity may also manifest as aseptic 
inflammation or exudative without infection, leading to 
nonspecific manifestation [8]. Patients may complain 
of pain and discomfort months or years after their 
procedure, especially in those cases where sponges 
remain [9]. Acute reactions after surgical procedures 
require immediate attention for further diagnosis and 
urgent surgery to remove the foreign body. 
The further operation to retrieve the RSB is 
very successful if performed soon after the first 
procedure, typically within t w o  weeks. At this 
stage, they can be detected by X-ray or can 
manifest as an inflammatory reaction. In such cases, 
a reasonable approach is first to attempt to remove 
the RSB laparoscopically. In the case of chronic 
manifestation months or even years after the first 
procedure, it is important to perform a CT scan first as 
a tumour-like mass or bowel obstruction, as well as 
various types of fistulae may be involved [7, 10]. 
Often, malignant tumours are suspected in such 
chronic manifestations, so CT and MRI scans are 
important to establish a diagnosis. 
The RSB can be organised as a mass inside 
the abdominal cavity, and a tumour may be 
suspected [11], in which case, extensive diagnostic 
imaging can distinguish the RSB from a tumour mass. 
Fibrinous changes present as a soft tissue mass in 
about 27% [12] or as an aseptic RSB that can result 
in granulomatous reactions and adhesions. In some 
cases, RSB may be organised in an abscess and 
manifest with clinical signs of sepsis [13]. 
RSB may also manifest as inflammation in 
the area surrounding the retained surgical sponge 
and may be associated with a bowel obstruction [14]. 
These cases require immediate surgery once it has 
been established that the RSB is causing the 
blockage. The RSB can lead to perforation of the 
intestinal 
wall 
and 
pathological 
communication 
between the adjacent structures [7]. This erosion can 
result in fistula formation, another form of complication 
related 
to 
retained 
foreign 
bodies 
[15, 
16]. 
Gastrointestinal 
bleeding 
from 
the 
upper 
gastrointestinal tract can also occur and may be life 
threatening for the patient, requiring urgent treatment 
with clinical restitution [17]. Transmural migration of 
the RSB after surgery can cause an intestinal 
obstruction when the RSB migrates from the 
abdominal to intraluminal space of the bowel [18]. 
Surgery is required to resolve this complication. 
As previously mentioned, the most commonly 
retained surgical items are sponges due to their 
extensive use, especially when surgeons are dealing 
with trauma and massive bleeding [19]. Surgical 
sponges are referred to as ''gossypiboma'' or 
''textiloma'' [1]. 
 
 
How to prevent RSB during surgical 
procedures 
 
Approximately 88% of RSB cases occur in a 
situation where the sponge and instrument counts 
were declared “correct” [1]. Counting the surgical 
materials used during the surgical procedure is the 
responsibility of the nurses under a direction of the 
doctors. The Association of Operating Room Nurses 
published 
an 
uptodate.com 
policy 
in 
2015 
recommending the points below that are widely used 
in the United States hospitals [20]. Specifically, counts 
should be performed at the following time points 
during the procedure: - before the procedure begins 
(initial count); - whenever new additional items are 
used during the operation; - before the surgeon closes

the body cavity; - when the surgeon begins to close 
the wound; and - when the surgeon closes the skin 
(final count). 
This accounting system was developed as 
part of the United States National Surgical Patient 
Safety Project (nothing left behind) with the aim to 
prevent retained surgical items [21]. 
 
 
Methods 
 
Literature Review 
The literature was searched via Pub Med, 
Scientific Commons and Google Scholar databases 
using the search term ‘foreign bodies after surgery’. 
Only articles in the English language were included in 
the review. 
 
 
Results 
 
In total, more than 30 articles were found 
related to retained surgical bodies after surgery, 
reporting different reasons for the preserved bodies 
being left inside the operation field after the surgical 
procedure. According to Gawande and Al, in the 
majority of cases where sponges were left behind, the 
number of sponges before closing was always 
declared correct, suggesting that counting alone is not 
sufficient. In addition, studies showed that body mass 
index, intraoperative complications and unexpected 
events are associated with an increased risk for 
retained bodies after 
surgical 
procedures [22]. 
Furthermore, authors, in their study of 34 cases 
with retained surgical bodies, concluded that a 
breakdown in communication within the operation 
team was the most important factor in relation to the 
issue of surgical bodies [23]. 
Finally, the studies reviewed recommended 
that the best strategies to prevent retained surgical 
bodies were good communication in the operation 
theatre, systematic counting of materials used during 
the surgical procedure, use of tracking devices for 
electronic sponge counts and counting before the 
cavity and skin are closed. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
The aim of this review was to identify 
weakness in the surgical team’s performance which 
may result in foreign bodies being left in body 
cavities. The retention of foreign bodies is an issue for 
all surgical procedures but is often associated with 
cases of traumatic injury at the emergency unit and 
during elective operations requiring different teams 
during the surgical procedure. The diagnosis of an 
RSFB is based upon imaging studies, and if an RSFB 
is suspected in the immediate postoperative period, 
plain radiographs of the surgical field should be 
performed. 
Radiopaque surgical instruments and devices 
should be immediately apparent on plain film and the 
characteristic appearance of radiopaque tape or wires 
of 
laparotomy 
pads 
and 
surgical 
sponges, 
respectively, should indicate their presence. The 
diagnosis of retained bodies can also be made using 
CT and gastrointestinal contrast studies. 
Excellent communication within the surgical 
team was identified as a major factor to minimise the 
number 
of 
surgical 
bodies 
left 
after 
surgical 
operations in the body cavity. Therefore,  to eliminate 
the occurrence of RSFB, the surgical team must work 
together to ensure a safe operation and good post-
operative outcomes; excellent communication during 
the procedure between the surgeons, nurses and 
anaesthetists is key to success. 
 
In conclusion, RSFB are still common despite 
new surgical techniques and equipment. The key to 
preventing the incidence of RSB is excellent 
communication within the surgical team, between the 
surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists.
