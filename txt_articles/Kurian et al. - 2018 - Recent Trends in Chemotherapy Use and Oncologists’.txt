Abstract
Background: There is growing concern about overtreatment of breast cancer as outcomes have improved over time.
However, little is known about how chemotherapy use and oncologists’ recommendations have changed in recent
years.
Methods: We surveyed 5080 women (70% response rate) diagnosed with breast cancer between 2013 and 2015 and accrued
through two Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (Georgia and Los Angeles) about chemotherapy receipt
and their oncologists’ chemotherapy recommendations. We surveyed 504 attending oncologists (60.3% response rate ) about
chemotherapy recommendations in node-negative and node-positive case scenarios. We conducted descriptive statistics of
chemotherapy use and patients’ report of oncologists’ recommendations and used a generalized linear mixed model of che-
motherapy use according to time and clinical factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: The analytic sample was 2926 patients with stage I–II, estrogen receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2–negative breast cancer. From 2013 to 2015, keeping other factors constant, chemotherapy use was estimated to de-
cline from 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 30.8% to 38.3%) to 21.3% (95% CI ¼ 19.0% to 23.7%, P < .001). Estimated decline
in chemotherapy use was from 26.6% (95% CI ¼ 23.0% to 30.7%) to 14.1% (95% CI ¼ 12.0% to 16.3%) for node-negative/
micrometastasis patients and from 81.1% (95% CI ¼ 76.6% to 85.0%) to 64.2% (95% CI ¼ 58.6% to 69.6%) for node-positive
patients. Use of the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) did not change among node-negative/micrometastasis patients, and in-
creasing RS use in node-positive patients accounted for one-third of the chemotherapy decline. Patients’ report of oncolo-
gists’ recommendations for chemotherapy declined from 44.9% (95% CI ¼ 40.2% to 49.7%) to 31.6% (95% CI ¼ 25.9% to 37.9%),
controlling for other factors. Oncologists were much more likely to order RS if patient preferences were discordant with their
recommendations (67.4%, 95% CI ¼ 61.7% to 73.0%, vs 17.5%, 95% CI ¼ 13.1% to 22.0%, concordant), and they adjusted recom-
mendations based on patient preferences and RS results.

 Conclusions: For both node-negative/micrometastasis and node-positive patients, chemotherapy receipt and oncologists’
recommendations for chemotherapy declined markedly over time, without substantial change in practice guidelines. Results
of ongoing trials will be essential to confirm the quality of this approach to breast cancer care.
Medical oncologists are leading efforts to reduce the burden of
treatment for patients diagnosed with curable breast cancer.
Recent advances in test algorithms enable increasingly precise
estimates of the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for individual
patients (1–3). The growing concern about overtreatment is par-
ticularly acute for patients with early-stage disease, for some of
whom the benefit of chemotherapy approaches nil in the face of
substantial harms. The criteria for chemotherapy decision-
making are evolving from being based primarily on anatomy to
biology (2–5). Prior studies have shown decreasing use of adju-
vant chemotherapy concomitant with increasing use of tumor
genomic profiling in patients diagnosed from 2006 to 2013 (6–9).
Despite this progress, questions remain about the causes of this
downward trend in chemotherapy receipt and whether it per-
sists. Prior studies have been limited by a lack of granular infor-
mation from patients’ and oncologists’ reports of the treatment
decision-making context, and by a lack of direct assessment of
the impact of clinical factors including changes in the use of 21-
gene recurrence score (RS) testing on treatment trends (10–12).
Treatment decisions are influenced by factors other than clin-
ical information, including patients’ fear of recurrence and physi-
cians’ reluctance to miss any potential opportunity to improve
survival (13). Yet little is known about the perspectives of patients
and their attending oncologists during the most recent period of
changing views about adjuvant therapy. Understanding the shift-
ing patterns of systemic therapy decisions is essential to initia-
tives that aim to advance the individualization and quality of
cancer care. We therefore examined trends in chemotherapy re-
ceipt and oncologists’ recommendations in a large, contempo-
rary, diverse, population-based sample of newly diagnosed breast
cancer patients, along with their oncologists’ perspectives on
chemotherapy decision-making.
Methods
Study Sample
After approval by institutional review boards (including a waiver of
signed informed consent), the iCanCare study selected 7303
women age 20 to 79 years who had been diagnosed with stage 0–II
breast cancer and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and
End Results (SEER) registries of Los Angeles County and Georgia.
Patients diagnosed in the first quarter of 2013 through the second
quarter of 2015 were sent surveys approximately three months af-
ter surgery on a monthly basis; 5080 women completed the survey
(response rate ¼ 70%) (Supplementary Figure 1, available online).
Patients with distant metastasis and/or tumors larger than 5 cm
were excluded. We oversampled Asian, black, and Hispanic
women in Los Angeles, as previously reported (14). For the pre-
sented analysis, patients with stage 0 disease were excluded be-
cause they were not eligible for treatment with chemotherapy,
while all other iCanCare participants were included.
Data Collection
We developed survey content using a conceptual framework,
the published literature, and our previous work. Content
validity was evaluated through systematic review by design
experts, cognitive pretesting with patients, and pilot research in
representative populations (15,16).
We used a modified Dillman method (17), including a $20
cash incentive and reminders to patients who did not respond.
All survey materials were in English, with Spanish-translated
materials
added
for
women
whose
surnames
suggested
Hispanic ethnicity. We merged survey responses with SEER
data. Patients reported their oncologists’ names and their spe-
cialties, the address was verified by the SEER registries, and
these doctors were surveyed (using a similar Dillman approach)
in 2015.
Measures
SEER registries provided diagnosis date, cancer stage, grade
(1–3), tumor size, and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone re-
ceptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)/neu status. RS testing and results (low, intermediate,
high) were provided by the testing laboratory, Genomic Health,
Inc., to SEER registries and merged with survey and SEER data,
as previously reported (10). Patients were eligible for this study
if they had invasive disease (stage I–II) that was ER-positive and
HER2-negative.
Nodal
status
grouping
followed
National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for adjuvant
systemic therapy (5): node-positive (American Joint Committee
on Cancer [AJCC] Anatomic Staging categories N1 or N2) vs
node-negative or only micrometastasis smaller than 2 mm in
size (AJCC categories N0 and N1mi, defined hereafter as “node-
negative/micrometastasis”).
Patients provided information about age at diagnosis, race/
ethnicity, chemotherapy receipt, whether they ever met with an
oncologist, and whether the oncologist recommended chemo-
therapy on a five-point scale (strongly in favor of chemother-
apy, somewhat in favor, left it up to me, somewhat against
chemotherapy, strongly against; the first two responses were
defined as recommendation for and the last two as recommen-
dation against chemotherapy).
Oncologists were asked whether they would recommend
chemotherapy and/or order a tumor genomic test in response
to two clinical scenarios in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-
negative disease. The first scenario was a patient with more fa-
vorable disease: age 60 years, postmenopausal, 0.7 cm tumor,
node-negative. The second scenario was a patient with less fa-
vorable disease: age 48 years, premenopausal, 2.2 cm tumor,
two involved lymph nodes. Oncologists were asked after each
scenario 1) whether they would recommend adjuvant chemo-
therapy (yes/no) and 2) whether they would order a tumor geno-
mic test that estimates the probability of distant recurrence and
benefit of chemotherapy (eg, RS) before making a chemotherapy
decision (yes/no). Oncologists were then given additional infor-
mation for each scenario followed by the same two questions,
intended to elicit the extent to which their recommendations
could be influenced by patient preferences. For the node-
negative scenario, the patient expressed an initial desire to
receive chemotherapy, and for the node-positive scenario the
patient expressed an initial desire to avoid chemotherapy. For

 each scenario, oncologists were asked whether they would rec-
ommend chemotherapy if a genomic test yielded a score that
ran counter to the patient’s nodal status (RS ¼ 34, in the high-
risk category if node-negative; RS ¼ 16, in the low risk-category
if node-positive) (1,3). The oncologist questionnaire is included
as Supplementary Material (available online), and the patient
questionnaire has been previously published (18).
Statistical Methods
We conducted descriptive statistics of the patterns and timing
of chemotherapy use and patients’ report of oncologists’ recom-
mendations. We used a generalized linear mixed model with
logit link to model chemotherapy receipt (yes/no) as a function
of time and clinical factors, considering a potential correlation
in chemotherapy receipt among patients seeing the same on-
cologist. Modeled factors consisted of age, study site, RS testing,
tumor grade, tumor size, nodal status, and time between diag-
nosis and survey completion and site. We tested nodal status
and other clinical factors for interactions with diagnosis date.
We used this model to estimate the marginal predicted proba-
bilities for the overall sample and prespecified subsamples av-
eraged over all clinical and demographic factors (19). We then
estimated marginal probabilities of chemotherapy receipt at
each quarter under two different scenarios: one assuming con-
stant RS testing across time and the other modeling changes in
RS testing rate observed in the node-positive subsample. For
each scenario, we estimated the rate of change in chemother-
apy use and compared these rates in order to estimate the
impact of changes in RS testing frequency. We used the boot-
strap
method
to
estimate
variance
of
these
estimates
(Supplementary Figure 2, available online). We used estimates
from a generalized ordinal mixed model that included the same
predictors as in the model for chemotherapy use to estimate
marginal trends in patients’ reports of oncologists’ recommen-
dations. All models incorporated patient survey and nonres-
ponse weights so that statistical inference was representative
of our target population. Oncologist survey descriptive results
incorporated nonresponse weights based on both physician and
average patient characteristics. Analyses using multiply im-
puted data (not shown) were consistent with reported results.
We used Proc NMIXED and proc SURVEYFREQ (SAS version 9.4).
We used the Rao-Scott chi-square test to assess the statisti-
cal signficiance of differences in proportions and likelihood ra-
tio tests to compare the goodness of fit of different models.
P values of less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 2926 women met inclusion criteria (Supplementary
Figure 1, available online), of whom 2844 had data available for
all covariates and comprised the analytic sample for chemo-
therapy receipt. The analysis of trends in patient report of on-
cologist
recommendations was restricted to patients
who
reported seeing an oncologist (2393) and had complete informa-
tion for all covariates (2347). Mean patient age was 62 years, 56.2%
white, 15.9% black, 17.4% Hispanic, and 7.9% Asian (Table 1).
There were no statistically significant changes in patient charac-
teristics over time.
Chemotherapy Receipt Trends
Chemotherapy receipt was associated with younger age (per 10
years: odds ratio [OR] ¼ 0.44, 95% confidence interval, 95%
CI ¼ 0.38 to 0.51), high RS (vs not tested: OR ¼ 14.14, 95% CI ¼ 6.08
to 32.88), nodal involvement (OR ¼ 13.46, 95% CI ¼ 9.39 to 19.28
for node-positive vs node-negative/micrometastasis), and grade
(grade 3 vs grade 1: OR ¼ 10.45, 95% CI ¼ 6.90 to 15.83), but not
with study site (OR ¼ 1.11, 95% CI ¼ 0.81 to 1.53) (Supplementary
Figure 2, available online).
From 2013 to 2015, odds of receiving chemotherapy declined
by 14.3% per quarter, controlling for testing and all other patient
covariates (OR ¼ 0.86, 95% CI ¼ 0.80 to 0.91) (Supplementary
Figure 2, available online). Receipt of chemotherapy declined
from 34.5% (95% CI ¼ 30.8% to 38.3%) to 21.3% (95% CI ¼ 19.0% to
23.7%) based on estimates from Supplementary Figure 2 (avail-
able online) applied to the sample, while holding clinical and
testing characteristics constant across the time. Figure 1 shows
chemotherapy estimated trends by nodal status, controlling for
change in all clinical variables including RS testing. In the node-
positive
group,
chemotherapy
declined
from
81.1%
(95%
CI ¼ 76.6% to 85.0%) to 64.2% (95% CI ¼ 58.6% to 69.6%), and in
the node-negative/micrometastatic group, it declined from
26.6% (95% CI ¼ 23.0% to 30.7%) to 14.1% (95% CI ¼ 12.0% to
16.3%).
Trends in RS Receipt and Effect on Chemotherapy Use
Half of the patients with node-negative/micrometastatic dis-
ease received RS, with a slow increase over time from 52.1%
(95% CI ¼ 43.8% to 60.3%) in the first half of 2013 to 54.1% (95%
CI ¼ 48.4% to 59.8.1%) in the first half of 2015 (Supplementary
Figure 3, available online). By contrast, during the same time pe-
riod, RS testing in patients with node-positive disease increased
from 26.1% (95% CI ¼ 11.3% to 40.9%) to 42.7% (95% CI ¼ 28.3% to
57.1%) (Supplementary Figure 3, available online). Figure 2
shows trends in chemotherapy receipt by nodal status, esti-
mated in two different ways in order to isolate the effect of
changes in RS test rates on treatment: the solid lines represent
results when RS use and all other covariates are held constant
over the entire time period; the dashed lines show estimated
chemotherapy rates, allowing the rate of RS testing to vary as
observed over time. For the node-positive group, the average de-
cline per quarter in these two scenarios is –2.0% per quarter
(95% CI ¼ –2.6% to –1.4%) when testing is held constant and –
3.0% (95% CI ¼ –4.0% to –1.9%) when testing rates are allowed to
vary as observed (Figure 2).The difference in rates is –1% per
quarter (95% CI ¼ –1.7% to –0.3%), suggesting that the changing
rates of testing are responsible for about one-third of the decline
estimated in a scenario where testing rates are allowed to vary as
observed. In the node-negative/micrometastatic group, there was
no statistically significant change (Ptrend ¼ .66) in RS testing
(Supplementary Figure 3, available online), and thus no difference
was observed between the solid and dashed lines (Figure 2).
Patients’ Reports of Oncologists’ Recommendations
Among those who reported an oncologist recommendation
about chemotherapy (n ¼ 2393, 84.1%), 1.4% of patients received
chemotherapy when oncologists recommended against it, vs
17.0% and 74.9% when oncologists “left it up to me” or recom-
mended chemotherapy, respectively (chi-square test, P < .001).
There was a marked decline over time in the odds of patients’

 reporting that their oncologists recommended chemotherapy
(OR ¼ 0.92, 95% CI ¼ 0.88 to 0.96), holding other characteristics
constant, representing a decline of 8.2% per quarter (95%
CI ¼ 3.9% to 13.3%). Figure 3 shows that patient report of having
received a recommendation for chemotherapy declined from
44.9% (95% CI ¼ 40.2% to 49.7%) to 31.6 % (95% CI ¼ 25.9% to
37.9%), controlling for other factors, with a corresponding in-
crease in reports of receiving a recommendation against che-
motherapy. The trend in reported oncologist recommendations
about chemotherapy did not differ by node status (likelihood
ratio test, P ¼ .85).
Oncologists’ Perspectives on Chemotherapy Use in Case
Scenarios
We identified 504 oncologists and 304 completed surveys (re-
sponse rate ¼ 60.3%). The yearly volume of new breast cancer
patients was 21.2% (1–20 patients), 35.8% (21–50), and 34.9%
(�51). For the more favorable prognosis scenario, few oncolo-
gists would recommend chemotherapy (9.3%, 95% CI ¼ 5.8% to
12.9%), while more than two-thirds (71.4%, 95% CI ¼ 66.0% to
76.8% ) would order a genomic test before making a decision
(Figure 4A). When presented with additional information that
the patient initially desired to have chemotherapy, oncologists
were more likely both to recommend chemotherapy (from 9.3%,
95% CI ¼ 5.8% to 12.9%, to 29.3%, 95% CI ¼ 23.7% to 34.9%, chi-
square test, P < .001) and to order a genomic test before making
a decision (from 71.4%, 95% CI ¼ 66.0% to 76.8% to 87.4%, 95%
CI ¼ 83.3% to 91.4% , P < .001). When asked how their recom-
mendation would change if a genomic profiling test (RS) pre-
dicted a high risk of distant recurrence (RS ¼ 34), virtually all
oncologists (96.5%, 95% CI ¼ 94.4% to 98.6%) would recommend
chemotherapy.
For the less favorable prognosis scenario, virtually all (99.6%,
95% CI¼ 98.9% to 100.0%) oncologists would recommend chemo-
therapy, and few (17.5%, 95% CI ¼ 13.1% to 22.0%) would order a
tumor genomic test before making a decision (Figure 4B). When
presented with information that the patient initially desired to
avoid chemotherapy, oncologists were somewhat less likely to
recommend chemotherapy (from 99.6%, 95% CI¼ 98.9% to 100.0%,
to 91.3%, 95% CI ¼ 87.9% to 94.7%, chi-square test, P < .001) but
much more likely to order a genomic test (from 17.5%, 95%
CI¼ 13.1% to 22.0%, to 67.4%, 95% CI¼ 61.7% to 73.0%, P < .001).
When presented with an RS of 16 (low risk), oncologists were
much less likely to recommend chemotherapy (from 91.3%, 95%
CI¼ 87.9% to 94.7% to 56.4%, 95% CI¼ 50.7% to 62.2%, P < .001).
Discussion
In this large, diverse, contemporary population-based sample of
newly diagnosed, early-stage breast cancer, we observed a
marked decline in chemotherapy receipt from 2013 through
2015. The chemotherapy decline was independent of changes in
clinical factors including RS use. RS testing rates did not change
at all in node-negative/metastatic patients (the majority of
patients) over time. RS testing did increase in the node-positive
patients, but we estimated that RS testing accounted for only
about one-third of the downward chemotherapy trend in node-
positive patients before controlling for changes in testing rates.
Patients’ reports of their oncologists’ recommendations for
chemotherapy declined at a rate commensurate with changes
in chemotherapy receipt. Oncologists’ perspectives on chemo-
therapy recommendation, elicited independently at one point
in time near the end of the study period, generally adhered to
practice guidelines, yet also reflected willingness to be respon-
sive to patient desires. For a patient with less favorable progno-
sis
node-positive
disease,
the
patient’s
desire
to
avoid
chemotherapy was associated with a marked increase in oncol-
ogists’ inclination to order genomic testing before making a rec-
ommendation, suggesting a possible mechanism for the 20%
increase we observed in RS use among node-positive patients
over time.

 Several studies have examined trends in RS and chemother-
apy use (6–9,20–22). These studies documented a decline in che-
motherapy over the last decade with increasing RS testing. We
and others have modeled the impact of RS use on chemother-
apy decision-making and identified scenarios in which RS tends
to encourage vs discourage chemotherapy (8,21,23). This study
builds on earlier work by demonstrating an ongoing marked
drop in chemotherapy use that is independent of RS testing
trends. While it is possible that use of other genomic assays (eg,
70-gene signature) (24) increased during the study period, our
survey respondents did not report frequent use of other assays,
and guidelines stipulate RS as the only assay validated to pre-
dict chemotherapy response. Oncologists appeared to be a driv-
ing force in the observed chemotherapy trends, as there were
powerful concomitant trends in patients’ reports of oncologists’
recommendations. During the study period, there was no major
change in the most prominent US guidelines, those of the NCCN
(which

patients in 2015 (26,27). The decline in chemotherapy use de-
spite an incomplete evidence base suggests a broad change in
culture, with oncologists moving away from chemotherapy for
patients with hormone-responsive early breast cancer.
We speculate that this powerful trend is due to a shift in fo-
cus toward tumor biology and away from anatomy as we strive
to identify individual patients whom chemotherapy is likely to
harm more than it helps. Much of the decline in chemotherapy
use may result from an evolution in oncologists’ attitudes about
the management of “close calls” (cases in which there is
uncertainty as to whether chemotherapy is warranted) because
of a growing literature that supports omitting chemotherapy
among patients with favorable tumor features (3,22,24). The evi-
dence for such a paradigm shift lies in our finding that, when
faced with the same clinical information, oncologists inter-
preted it differently in later than in earlier years of this study.
Concurrently, patients may be increasingly concerned about the
well-known and publicized toxic side effects of chemotherapy
(28), particularly if oncologists express less enthusiasm about
its benefits. This growing sea change in decision-making about
chemotherapy is important for both oncologists and patients to
recognize. In this context, evidence published after this study
may rapidly accelerate the trend to reduce chemotherapy
among node-positive patients (3,29).
Oncologists offered perspectives on chemotherapy use that
generally followed standard algorithms; however, their recom-
mendations were also sensitive to patient preferences. Our
results suggest that oncologists use tumor genomic profiling to
adjudicate mismatch between patient preference and practice
guidelines. For example, oncologists initially indicated low use
(17.5%) of a genomic profiling test in the node-positive case sce-
nario, but when confronted by a discordant patient preference,
oncologists’ inclination to order a genomic test surged to 67.4%.
Notably, patient preferences that were discordant with guide-
lines (and most oncologists’ initial recommendations) shifted
oncologists’ stance on chemotherapy by 10 to 20 percentage
points. Yet when the combination of patient preferences and
genomic results were both discordant with oncologists’ initial
recommendation, oncologists’ stance shifted far more substan-
tially. These results offer a window into the clinical encounter

 and demonstrate the process by which oncologists integrate
practice guidelines, patient preferences, and genomic profiling
to individualize breast cancer care.
Aspects of the study merit comment. This study’s strengths
include a large, contemporary, diverse population-based patient
sample, highly complete ascertainment of RS directly from the
testing laboratory, detailed clinical information integrated with
survey data from both patients and their attending oncologists,
and high response rates. Limitations include the use of patient
report, an indirect and imperfect measure of the strength of
oncologists’ chemotherapy recommendations, a relatively small
number of node-positive cases, absence of detailed information
on lymph node number and size, extracapsular extension and
specific chemotherapy agents, a relatively brief study period,
and geographic restriction to two US regions. Oncologists were
surveyed only once, limiting our ability to study treatment
decision-making from their perspective over time.
The trends we document are remarkable for their steepness
of decline, independent of clinical factors and despite no major
change in the evidence base over the study period. This result
represents an evolution of clinical oncology culture driven by
oncologists’ appropriate concerns about overtreatment in this
generally favorable-prognosis population. However, a lingering
concern is that oncologists may be overshooting the mark in
patients with less favorable prognosis, especially if pending tri-
als do not support that genomic testing algorithms are equally
predictive in node-positive vs node-negative disease. Thus, the
results of pending clinical trials will be essential to confirm the
rationale of this approach to treatment.
