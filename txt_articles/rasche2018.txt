Abstract
Aims: High concentrations of air pollutants are associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction. The European
Union has defined statutory limits for air pollutants based on upper absolute concentrations. We evaluated the asso-
ciation between rapid changes in air pollutants and the risk of myocardial infarction independently of absolute
concentrations.
Methods and results: Using a hospital-based case-crossover study, effects of 24h changes of nitrogen oxides (NOX/2),
particulate matter (PM10), and ozone on the risk of myocardial infarction was assessed in 693 patients. In the overall
population, increases of NOX of more than 20 mg/m3 within 24 h were associated with an increase in the risk of
myocardial infarction by up to 121% (odds ratio (OR) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19–4.08). Comparably,
rapid increases of NO2 of more than 8 mg/m3 tended to increase myocardial infarction risk by 73% (OR 1.73, 95% CI
0.91–3.28) while myocardial infarction risk decreased by 60% after a decrease of NO2 concentration of more than
8 mg/m3 (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.21–0.77), suggesting a close-to-linear association. While results for ozone concentrations
were ambiguous, rapid change in PM10 was not associated with myocardial infarction risk.
Conclusion: Dynamics and extent of increase in nitrogen oxide concentrations may be an independent risk factor for
myocardial infarction. As there are currently no European Union statutory limits reflecting this dynamic variation of air
pollutants on a daily basis, the results urgently call for confirming studies in different geographical regions to verify the
observations.

Introduction
The acute coronary syndrome and its key component –
acute
myocardial
infarction
(MI)
–
account
for
approximately
20%
of
all
deaths
in
Europe.1
Observational studies suggest that besides the classical
cardiovascular risk factors, long- and short-term expos-
ure to high concentrations of particulate and gaseous
pollutants mainly from anthropogenic sources such as
vehicles is also associated with an increased risk of
MI.2–4 In recognition of the adverse medical effects of

 these air pollutants, the European Union (EU) has
defined statutory limits for a number of air pollutants
associated with risk of MI including nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), particulate matter with a diameter of less than
10 mm (PM10) and ozone (O3).5
Unfortunately, the current regulations suffer from a
significant drawback. The EU statutory limits on air
pollutants are modelled on an upper absolute concen-
tration of a specific air pollutant which – if exceeded – is
regarded as being harmful for human health. This
approach does not account for the potential adverse
effect of rapid variations of air pollutants on the risk
of MI – independent of the absolute ambient concen-
tration.
Rapid
variations
of
other
environmental
factors such as ambient temperature and air pressure
are already known to affect cerebrovascular health
independently of an absolute ambient concentration.6
The impact of rapid variations of air pollution on risk
for MI is plausible from a biological perspective: short-
term exposure to NO2 has been associated with an
increased
rate
of
ventricular
tachyarrhythmias.7
Knowledge of a potential association between rapid
variations in air pollutants and risk of MI is of high
relevance because even in cities that do not violate the
EU statutory limits for the major air pollutants, and are
accordingly deemed ‘clean’, the concentrations of air
pollutants are not static and can vary on a daily basis.
The current case-crossover study was designed to
gain knowledge on the currently unknown effect of
rapid changes of ambient concentration of major air
pollutants on the risk for MI. Using a multivariable
model that also considers actual weather as a significant
confounder, we hypothesized that 24h variations in the
concentrations of the major ambient air pollutants
nitrogen oxides (NOX), NO2, O3 and PM10 are asso-
ciated with MI risk. Determination of a potential link
between rapid changes in air pollution levels and the
risk for MI could be particularly valuable towards an
evidence-based adaptation of existing statutory limits
of air pollutants, to ward off an increase in adverse
health outcomes and achieve greater public health
protection.
Methods
Study design
This retrospective, hospital-based case-crossover study
was carried out at the Jena University Hospital in
Central Germany. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Jena University Hospital.
The University Hospital is the only primary care
hospital for the city of Jena and its 100,000 inhabitants.
The city of Jena has a temperate climate with moder-
ately
cool
winters
and
mild
summers.8
Patient
admission data were drawn from the hospital’s patient
data
management
system
using
the
International
Classification of Diseases – 10th Revision codes for
ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; I20.0–
I20.3) in the primary diagnostic position. MI in this
study refers to STEMI (see Discussion). The study
catchment area was < 10 km around Jena University
Hospital and only cases with postal codes registered
in this area were selected. The study period was from
1 January 2003 until 31 December 2010. If a patient
was treated more than once for MI during the study
period,
only
the
first
admission
was
selected
to
remove the bias of an individual’s susceptibility to air
pollution. Patient health records including cardiac cath-
eterization reports and electrocardiograms (ECGs)
were individually analysed by both trained physicians
and medical study personnel to identify patients
treated for MI, to determine the date and time of MI
onset and to verify the diagnosis. Diagnosis of STEMI
was confirmed when in the emergency or admission
ECG a new ST elevation at the J-point in two contigu-
ous leads was present. Cut-off points were � 0.2 mV
in men and � 0.15 mV in women in leads V2–V3 and/
or � 0.1 mV in other leads.9 Additional data col-
lected included age, sex, risk factors to calculate the
individual Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk
Score10 and grade of coronary heart disease (CHD)
determined
by
cardiac
catheter.
Left
ventricular
ejection fraction was obtained from post-admission
echocardiographic reports and classified according to
Lang et al.11
We excluded all cases with (1) inaccessible patient
files, (2) admission due to reasons other than MI, (3)
onset of symptoms outside the study catchment area
and (4) undeterminable onset of MI or time interval
between symptom onset and admission �72 h.
Air pollution data containing NO2, NOX (total con-
centration of NO þ NO2), O3 and PM10 were provided
by the Thuringian State Environmental Agency in Jena
(longitude 11� 35’ E/latitude 50� 56’ N/altitude 140 m).
In addition, meteorological data including ambient
temperature, relative air humidity and atmospheric
pressure were provided for the entire study period as
hourly data by the Meteorological Monitoring Station
of the Jena University of Applied Sciences (longitude
11� 34’ E/latitude 50� 55’ N/altitude 215 m).
Statistical analysis
We used a bidirectional case-crossover model to exam-
ine the short-term effect of rapid variations in the con-
centrations of air pollutants on the risk of MI. The
case-crossover model has previously been developed
to study the effect of a short exposure to a well-defined
potential harmful event on the risk for an acute and

 rare disease.12 Our study design is similar to the case–
control model design with the difference that each
patient serves as his or her own control. Thus, inference
in this study is based on within-person comparisons
comparing the potentially health influencing air pollu-
tant concentrations shortly before the onset of MI
symptoms (hazard period) with the same concentra-
tions that prevailed in the previous and following
week (bidirectional control period to control for time-
trends13). The number of days between the hazard
period and MI onset is referred to as lag time. Three
different lag times were used to consider a potential
delay before the air pollutant fully affects the individ-
ual’s risk of MI (lag time 1: 24 h changes in air pollu-
tants between day –2 and –1 before onset of MI
symptoms; lag time 2: respective changes between day
–3 and –2; lag time 3: respective changes between day
–3 and –4). Considering a potential non-linear relation-
ship between air pollution and risk of MI, air pollutants
were analysed as categorized variables in four cate-
gories
compared
with
one
reference
category.
Categories were chosen after visual inspection of the
respective distribution curve. For cut-off values see
Figure 2. Data were analysed in the overall sample as
well as in the following subgroups: sex (male/female),
age (<65 years ¼ young/ � 65 years ¼ old), cardiovascu-
lar risk profile (Framingham Score < 12 ¼ low risk
profile; � 12 ¼ high risk profile), and grade of coronary
disease (one-, two- or three-vessel disease). Generalized
linear mixed models (GLMMs) were fitted using odds
ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval
(95% CI) to quantify the association between environ-
mental data and MI risk.14 GLMMs extend the gener-
alized linear model approach allowing the linear
predictor to contain fixed as well as random effects.15
The fact that GLMMs account for within patient cor-
relation is one major advantage of this model.16 In this
study,
air
pollutants
together
with
corresponding
meteorological parameters (ambient air temperature,
relative air humidity and atmospheric pressure) were
regarded as fixed effects and the single patient as a
random effect. Because a number air pollutants are
known to be correlated with meteorological factors17
and patients are likely to be exposed to both environ-
mental
components,
we
used
this
multi-variable
approach combining air pollution and weather in one
statistical model. The statistic software R (V. 3. 2. 3,
package ‘lme4’, function ‘glmer’) was used for all cal-
culations. To reduce a possible bias associated with
multiple testing, air pollutants, meteorological vari-
ables, hazard and CIs, outcome groups and statistical
tests performed were chosen prior to the examination
of the data. As MI is a relatively rare disease with a
lifetime prevalence of less than 10%, we interpret ORs
as relative risks.18
Results
Study population
Of 1152 cases with MI in the primary diagnostic pos-
ition, six cases (0.5%) could not be analysed because
the respective patient files were not available during the
screening period. Another 306 cases (26.6%) were
excluded as hospital admission was not due to MI
(i.e. inaccurate hospital admission data, elective admis-
sion for cardiac catheterization, treatment optimiza-
tion, suspected but not verified MI or similar). We
excluded 11 cases (1%) because the onset of MI symp-
toms ensued remote to the study catchment area
(i.e. MI occurred while on vacation and initial treat-
ment was performed abroad). These patients were
thus not exposed to Jena air pollution during the
hazard period and therefore excluded. We excluded a
further 136 cases (11.8%) as we were unable to retro-
spectively determine the onset of the MI or whether the
time interval between MI onset and admission was
�72 h. The remaining 693 cases formed the basis for
this case-crossover study. The patient selection process
is visualized in Figure 1 and patient characteristics are
presented in Table 1.

 Environmental parameters
Table 2 summarizes the distribution of 24h changes in
mean daily values of air pollutants. Average daily con-
centrations of NO2 ranged from 2.67 to 63.39 mg/m3
(median:
17.78 mg/m3),
of
NOX
from
2.67
to
181.79 mg/m3 (median: 21.74 mg/m3), of O3 from 2 to
117.29 mg/m3 (median: 44.74 mg/m3) and of PM10 from
3.92 to 166.79 mg/m3 (median: 18.96 mg/m3). During the
study period, the average daily temperature ranged
from –14.01 to 28.64�C (median: 10.9�C). Average
daily
atmospheric
pressure
and
relative
humidity
values ranged from 955.14 to 1017.1 hPa (median:
990.63 hPa)
and
40.01–99.9%
(median:
79.52%),
respectively.
Risk of MI in relation to rapid changes in air pollution
NOX. In the overall population, increases of NOX of
more than 20 mg/m3 and of 8–20 mg/m3 were associated
with an increase in the risk for a MI by up to
121% with a lag time of two (2 d) or three days (3 d)
(>20 mg/m3: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.19–4.08 for lag 3 d; OR
1.54, 95% CI 0.84–2.83 for lag 2 d; 8–20 mg/m3: OR
1.51, 95% CI 1.04–2.18 for lag 3 d) (Figure 2). In all
subgroups, we saw a similar pattern of increase of MI
risk with ORs between 1.01 and 4.16 after an increase
in NOX with a comparable lag time of three days
(Figure 3). However, significance was only reached in

with a low cardiovascular risk (>20 mg/m3: OR 2.49,

Additionally, but with a lag time of two days, MI risk
increased in young patients after an increase of NOX by
more than 20 mg/m3 (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.11–8.97).
NO2. In the overall population, rapid changes of ambi-
ent NO2 concentration were associated with risk of
MI in a close-to-linear manner. While, with a lag time
of one day, the risk of MI showed a tendency to
increase by 73% after an increase in NO2 concentration
of more than 8 mg/m3 (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.91–3.28), MI
risk decreased by 60% following a decrease in the NO2
concentration by more than 8 mg/m3 (OR 0.4, 95% CI

 0.21–0.77) (Figure 2). In almost each subgroup, NO2
concentration and MI risk showed a similar pattern
as in the overall population with a lag time of one
(Figure 4) or two days. We found an increased risk of
MI in patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile
after an increase in NO2 concentration of more
than 8 mg/m3 (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.02–9.74, lag 1 d)
(Figure 4). Similarly, after an increase of 3–8 mg/m3,
the risk of MI was more than doubled in patients with
a three-vessel CHD (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.01–4.09,
lag 2 d). ORs in all other subgroups indicated a similar
increase in the risk of MI following an increase in the
concentration of NO2 though significance was not
reached (Figure 4). In agreement with this, following
a decrease in NO2 concentration of more than 8 mg/m3,
the risk of MI in men decreased by up to 71%
(OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.64, lag 1 d, Figure 4; OR
0.45, 95% CI 0.21–0.97, lag 2 d), in younger patients

CHD by 73% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07–0.99, lag 1 d,
Figure 4) and with a three-vessel CHD by 73% (OR
0.27, 95% CI 0.07–0.99, lag 3 d), respectively. After a
smaller decrease of 3–8 mg/m3 in the concentration of
NO2, the risk of MI still decreased by 47% (OR 0.53,
95% CI 0.31–0.9, lag 2 d) in patients with a low cardio-
vascular risk profile. However, we observed a decreased
MI risk in patients with two-vessel CHD after an
increase in NO2 concentration of more than 8 mg/m3
(OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.85, lag 2 d; OR 0.19, 95%

O3. In the overall population, the risk of MI decreased
after an increase of the O3 concentration between
5 mg/m3 and 15 mg/m3 (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47–0.95)
with a lag time of two days (Figure 2). In subgroups,
MI risk decreased in patients with low cardiovascular
risk (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.93, lag 2 d) and two-
vessel CHD (5–15 mg/m3: OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17–0.71,
lag 1 d) after an increase in O3 concentration between
5 mg/m3 and 15 mg/m3. However, in women MI risk
increased after a reduction in O3 concentrations of
more than 15 mg/m3 (OR 3.47, 95% CI 1.02–11.8)
or between 5 mg/m3 and 15 mg/m3 (OR 2.37, 95% CI

 PM10. There was no association between rapid changes
in PM10 and MI risk in the overall population
(Figure 2). In subgroups, the risk of MI increased
with a lag time of three days after a decrease of PM10
of 3–10 mg/m3 in women (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.06–3.56),
older patients (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04–2.19), patients
with a high cardiovascular risk profile (OR 1.72, 95%
CI 1.03–2.88) and patients with a three-vessel CHD
(OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.23–3.84), respectively. In contrast,
in older patients the risk of MI tended to increase after
an increase in PM10 of 3–10 mg/m3 (OR 1.20, 95% CI
0.82–1.75) and > 10 mg/m3 (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.86–
3.28) with a lag time of two days even though results
barely missed significance.
Discussion
This case-crossover study investigates the association
between rapid changes in major air pollutants and the
risk for MI. Our study extends the current knowledge
in three major aspects. First, our results suggest that the
risk of MI associated with nitrogen oxides is dependent
not only on long- or short-term exposure to a high
ambient concentration of these gaseous pollutants but
also on the dynamic and extent of their increase.
Second, a rapid increase in NO2 as well as in NOX
concentrations is associated with increased risk of MI.
And third, nitrogen oxides may also impact the risk of
MI in presumably clean air zones.
Strengths and weaknesses
Our study includes a number of important methodo-
logical
strengths,
including
its
robust
statistical
approach integrating air pollution and weather in one
statistical model, its large study population with a ver-
ified diagnosis and time point of onset of MI symp-
toms, as well as the geographical proximity of the
individual patient to the meteorological and air pollu-
tion monitoring stations.
The case-crossover study design used herein to deter-
mine the association between air pollution and risk of
MI is a modification of the case–control design by
virtue of the fact that every patient serves as his
or her own control.12 An advantage of these intra-
individual
comparisons
is
that
the
case-crossover
approach controls for fixed confounders such as sex,
age, current smoking, chronic disease, long-term medi-
cation
or
socioeconomic
status
by
study
design.
Further, we controlled for circadian confounders such
as weekday19 by choosing a seven day control interval.
Because the case-crossover design is known to be
potentially vulnerable to time-trends with regard to
exposure, a bidirectional control period was applied.13
We performed a multi-variable analysis that also
considered the main meteorological variables to esti-
mate the air pollution-dependent risk of MI. This
approach takes into account the interactions between
air pollution and weather such as between NOX and
NO2 and basic meteorological parameters20 or between
PM10 and temperature17 as well as interactions between
the single pollutants.
One critical success factor for a case-crossover study
is the exact determination of the time point of onset of
the acute medical condition. It is known that patients
with symptoms of MI do not necessarily present in the
Emergency Department directly after onset of symp-
toms and patients may not remember the exact time
point of symptom onset. To exclude this potential
recall bias, MI in this study refers to STEMI only
because presentation of patients suffering non-STEMI
and unstable angina is known to be delayed.21,22
However, we expect that both entities are similarly trig-
gered by air pollution as the pathophysiology of non-
STEMI and STEMI is not significantly different.21
Nevertheless, 21.4% of all cases included in our study
have not been admitted on the day of manifestation of
symptoms and we manually adjusted for the day of MI
occurrence in our dataset. This indicates that previous
studies in which the day of admission was regarded as
the time point of MI occurrence could show a potential
bias.23–26 In addition, since we had no records of patients
who died of MI before reaching the hospital, it is pos-
sible that the effects of air pollutants are underestimated
if they actually triggered the fatal MI.
Even though we included a sufficient number of
patients to allow a detailed analysis to be conducted in
the overall population, results in subgroups have to be
interpreted with appropriate care due to the restricted
sample size in some of the subgroups analysed for five
air pollution categories. In case-only studies, risk esti-
mates are potentially vulnerable to time trends in expos-
ure. Thus, a bidirectional control interval was chosen to
minimize this potential confounder.13
Nitrogen oxides
NOX is defined as the sum of the ambient concentration
of NO and NO2.27 NOX – and primarily NO – are
emitted directly into the atmosphere by high-tempera-
ture combustion of fossil fuels.28 In the atmosphere,
NO reacts with oxygen or O3 to form secondary NO2.
High ambient concentrations of NO and NOX are
believed to have relatively minor impacts on health29
and EU statutory limits for NO and NOX with regard
to their effect on human health are lacking. In contrast,
adverse effects of NO2 on human health have been
shown in a number of epidemiological studies. Short-
and long-term exposure to high concentrations of NO2
have been associated with an increase in the overall
Rasche et al.

 mortality30–32 and cardiovascular mortality32–34 due to
heart failure35 and acute MI.36–42 Based on these pre-
vious studies, we in fact anticipated that 24h increases
in nitrogen
oxides
would be associated
with
an
increased risk of MI. However, we were surprised at
the magnitude of the effect. For example, a recent
meta-analysis
reported
a
very
modest
association
between NO2 and risk for MI with a relative risk of
1.011 for each 10 mg/m3 higher absolute NO2 concen-
tration.2 In our study, MI risk was more than doubled
both in the overall population and in the subgroups
after a 24h increase in NO2 and NOX of more than
8 mg/m3 and 20 mg/m3, respectively. This magnitude
of the increased risk for MI comes close to the risk
associated with the classical risk factors such as arterial
hypertension, diabetes or smoking.43 Even though we
assume that methodological differences partly contrib-
ute to the different effect sizes our results suggest that
the magnitude and rapidity of the increase in the con-
centration of nitrogen oxides may be at least as import-
ant for the risk of MI in comparison with their absolute
ambient concentrations.
The majority of studies investigating the impact of
nitrogen oxides on cardiovascular health and onset of
MI have been performed in dense urban areas with
significant
air
pollution.33,37–40,44
Compared
with
these studies, the ambient air quality in the city of
Jena is good and is reflected by the low numbers of
days during which the concentration of air pollutants
exceeds the (EU) daily air quality limit values.45 For
example, during the study period, the EU statutory
limits for the concentration of NO2 of 200 mg/m3
during any 1h time window was not surpassed in the
catchment area and the annual average NO2 concentra-
tion remained below the 40 mg/m3 EU limit value.
Although there are no EU statutory limits for NOX
to specifically protect human health, the EU has
defined an annual average limit of 30 mg/m3 of NOX
to protect the vegetation but has placed no obligation
towards reporting violations of this limit during a single
day.46 Even though the ambient air in the city of Jena is
comparably clean, the significant association between
rapid changes in nitrogen oxides and onset of MI
suggests that the current EU statutory limits do not
sufficiently protect against effects relating to the cardio-
vascular health of the population. A more specific def-
inition and stricter implementation of statutory limits
for rapid increases of nitrogen oxides are potentially
needed to address this issue and to close this gap
regarding the risk of MI.
The exact mechanisms of how nitrogen oxides have a
detrimental cardiovascular effect are as yet unclear
although a number of potential mechanisms have
been investigated,28,47 including an impaired autonomic
cardiovascular control7 and increased concentrations of
reactive oxygen species associated with cellular damage
of the cardiovascular system.48
O3
In contrast to the harmful effects of high concentrations
of O3 for respiratory health,49 our results suggest that a
rapid increase of O3 levels lowers the risk of MI. This
finding is in line with most studies investigating abso-
lute O3 concentrations as a risk factor for MI.36,47 It
has been suggested that this observation is likely an
indirect
effect
of
unmeasured
pollutants
such
as
PM2.5, which are positively linked with MI risk but
inversely correlated with O3 or they may be due to
collinearities between model covariates.36
PM10
Particulate matter refers to a subgroup of airborne par-
ticles consisting of various solid and liquid particles
that have been associated with subclinical atheroscler-
osis, cardiovascular mortality and an altered cardiac
autonomic activity.50,51 Our results suggest that there
is no association between a rapid change of ambient
PM10 concentration – a subgroup of airborne particles
with a diameter of less than 10 mm – and acute MI risk
in the general population, which is in line with most
other studies considering the absolute PM10 concentra-
tion as the exposure variable.47 However, a recent
meta-analysis reported a very small but significant
effect of PM10 on the risk of MI (relative risk: 1.006
for an incremental unit of 10 mg/m3).2 Again, studies
included in that meta-analysis considered the absolute
concentration of PM10 rather than the rapid changes in
PM10 as the exposure variable and results are difficult
to compare.
Conclusion
As its main finding, our study suggests that MI risk
may not only depend on the long- or short-term expos-
ure to a high ambient concentration of nitrogen oxides
but also on the dynamics and extent of their increase.
Rapid increases of nitrogen oxides are not uncommon
even in apparently clean air cities but are not reflected
in current EU statutory limits. Because the magnitude
of the effects observed may be clinically relevant, our
results call for urgent larger scale studies in different
geographical regions to verify the observations and to
make reliable policy recommendations for public and
health care institutions.
