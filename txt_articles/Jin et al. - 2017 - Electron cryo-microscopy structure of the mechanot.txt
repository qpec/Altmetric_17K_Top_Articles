Abstract
Mechanosensory transduction for senses such as proprioception, touch, balance, acceleration, 
hearing and pain relies on mechanotransduction channels, which convert mechanical stimuli into 
electrical signals in specialized sensory cells1. How force gates mechanotransduction channels is a 
central question in the field, for which there are two major models. One is the membrane-tension 
model: force applied to the membrane generates a change in membrane tension that is sufficient to 
gate the channel, as in the case of bacterial MscL channel and certain eukaryotic potassium 
channels2-5. The other is the tether model: force is transmitted via a tether to gate the channel. 
Recent study suggests that NOMPC, a mechanotransduction channel that mediates hearing and 
touch sensation in Drosophila, is gated by tethering of its ankyrin repeat (AR) domain to 
microtubules of the cytoskeleton6. Thus, a goal of studying NOMPC is to reveal the underlying 
mechanism of force induced gating, which could serve as a paradigm of the tether model. 
NOMPC, a Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel and the founding member of the TRPN 
sub-family7, fulfills all the criteria for a bona fide mechanotransduction channel1,8, and is 
important for a variety of mechanosensation-related behaviors such as locomotion, touch and 
sound sensation across different species including C. elegans9, Drosophila8,10-11 and zebrafish12. 
NOMPC has 29 ARs, the largest number among TRP channels. They are implicated as tether to 
convey force from cytoskeleton to the channel, thus to mediate mechanosensation6,13-15. A key 
question is how the long AR domain is organized as a tether that can trigger channel gating. Here 
we present a de novo atomic structure of NOMPC determined by single particle electron cryo-

 microscopy (cryo-EM), and discuss how its architecture could provide a means to convey 
mechanical force to generating an electrical signal within a cell.
By screening NOMPC homologues, we identified full-length Drosophila NOMPC for 
structural analysis. Recombinantly expressed NOMPC is functional and purified protein 
retains microtubule binding activity (Extended Data Fig. 1). Purified and detergent-
solubilized protein was either exchanged to amphipols or reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs 
for structure determination (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b), following procedures previously 
described16,17. Electron micrographs and two-dimensional (2D) class averages of negatively 
stained NOMPC showed that the nanodisc sample has better-organized features in the 
cytoplasmic domain than the amphipol sample (Extended Data Fig. 2c-f). Moreover, 
estimated resolution and structural features in the map from nanodisc sample are 
significantly better while the overall architectures are comparable to those from the 
amphipol sample (Extended Data Figs 3, 4). Based on the 3.6Å resolution map of the 
channel in nanodiscs (Extended Data Figs 4, 5), we constructed a de novo atomic model of 
NOMPC. Side chain positions of most residues from Ala359 to Trp1602 (including 22 ARs, 
namely ARs 8-29) and from Arg1670 to Gly1689 were identified, except for some charged 
residues exposed to solvent, or located at the contact sites between neighboring AR domains 
(Fig. 1). In addition, we were able to trace the Cα chain of the first 7 ARs, from Met124 to 
Ala359. The N-terminal domain prior to the first AR is too flexible to be modeled, and they 
are predicted to be un-structured.
Strikingly, four AR domains from the tetrameric NOMPC are organized into a quadruple 
structure with each domain resembling a helical spring (Fig. 1a-d, Extended Data Fig. 6a-d), 
unlike those in other TRP family proteins such as TRPV116 and TRPA118. The connection 
between the ARs region and the transmembrane core could be separated into two parts: a 
stack of linker helices and two helices that span only half of the lipid bilayer from the 
cytoplasmic side and form an elbow-like structure (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 6e). We 
name this new feature as the “pre-S1 elbow”. It packs against the S1 helix and creates a 
“bay” with S1 and S4 from the same subunit plus S3-S5 from the adjacent subunit to harbor 
phospholipids (discussed below).
The transmembrane domain of each NOMPC subunit is composed of six transmembrane α-
helices (S1–S6) and a re-entrant pore loop located between S5 and S6 (Fig. 1f). Four 
subunits form a homotetramer through domain swap-interactions (Fig. 1c, Extended Data 
Fig. 6) as in other TRP channels and voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. Following S6, 
the “signature” TRP domain is sandwiched between the linker helices and the S4-S5 linker 
(Fig. 1f). A short helix immediately after the TRP domain is packed against S2 and the pre-
S1 elbow. Beyond these, the C-terminus is mostly unstructured (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 
6).
The central pore of NOMPC has two major constrictions, sharing the general architecture of 
TRP, Nav, Cav and K channels16,19-21. At the upper constriction, the carbonyl oxygens of 
residues Phe1505 and Gly1506 in the pore loop face the pore (Fig. 2a). The diameter of this 
constriction (3.8Å defined by opposing van der Waals surfaces (vdW), 7Å defined as the 
distance between the centers of opposing oxygen atoms) is large enough to accommodate a

 partially-hydrated cation (Extended Data Fig. 7a), and is comparable to the size of the 
corresponding region of the open state (∼3.5Å vdW, ∼8Å distance) rather than the closed 
state (∼1.5Å vdW, ∼4Å distance) of TRPV122. A negatively charged residue (Glu1511) just 
above the upper constriction presumably attracts cations to the pore (Fig. 2); replacing 
Glu1511 with a positively charged residue reduces the single channel conductance8.
The lower constriction of the channel adopts a closed architecture (Fig. 2a, Extended Data 
Fig. 7a) with Ile1554 forming a hydrophobic seal, similar to TRPV1 in the closed state16. 
Replacing Ile1554 with alanine results in a leaky channel yielding large basal current 
without mechanical stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 7b), confirming its critical role in 
preventing ion flow through the pore. The overall arrangement of the central pore of 
NOMPC is thus similar to the TRPA1 pore, with the upper constriction in a conformation 
that can accommodate ions while the lower gate is closed18.
We observed densities that can be attributed to lipids, with the most pronounced densities 
found in the intracellular leaflet. A tightly bound lipid (Fig. 3a, b) occupies a hydrophobic 
cleft formed by the pre-S1 elbow, S1, S4 and the S4-S5 linker of one subunit and S5 of its 
adjacent subunit. The inner surface of this pocket is coated with hydrophobic side chains, 
creating an ideal environment for the lipid aliphatic chains. Near the solvent-accessible face, 
His1423 in the S4-S5 linker coordinates the lipid polar headgroup (Fig. 3b). His1423Ala 
mutant is still expressed on the cell membrane but the channel no longer responds to 
mechanical stimulation, and mutation of the adjacent His1424 had no effect on channel 
function (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7c, d), suggesting that this specific lipid-protein 
interaction is functionally important. Density for this lipid also appears in the amphipol map, 
indicating that this lipid is tightly bound and may represent an endogenous lipid.
The pre-S1 and linker domains that connect the AR domain to the transmembrane core 
adopt an architecture reminiscent of the stacked helices in TRPA118, but distinct from the 
known structures of TRPV channels16,23-25. A series of “linker helices” are sandwiched 
between the transmembrane domain and the AR domain (Fig. 1e, f), creating a network of 
interactions connecting the S4-S5 linker via TRP domain to the ARs (Fig. 3d-g). As a novel 
addition to the transmembrane domain, two helices form an inverted “V”, which partially 
inserts into and then exits the membrane next to (and in sequence immediately before) S1. 
This “pre-S1 elbow” makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with the S1 helix (Fig. 3d), and 
at the same time wraps around the cavity occupied by the tightly bound lipid (Fig. 3a, b), 
holding the lipid in proximity to His1423 of the S4-S5 linker (Fig. 3a, b).
Facing towards the cytoplasm, the S4-S5 linker forms a loop that encircles the side chain of 
the conserved Trp1572 of the TRP domain (Fig. 3e), creating a pivotal point of contact 
between the S4-S5 linker and the TRP domain that interacts with the densely-packed linker 
helices connected to the AR domain (Fig. 3f, g). Substitution of Trp1572 with alanine results 
in a channel that exhibits a prominent basal current but no longer responds to mechanical 
stimuli with an increase of current amplitude (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 7b, c). This 
tryptophan critical for channel gating is the invariant hallmark of TRP domains conserved in 
other TRP channel subfamilies26. Its mutation in TRPV3 leads to Olmsted syndrome27, and

 in TRPV4 causes gain-of-function phenotypes28. Thus, this tryptophan residue is of critical 
importance in the gating of multiple TRP channels.
On the opposite face of the TRP helix, pointing away from the membrane, a number of 
residues form complementary hydrophobic and polar contacts with the linker helices below 
(Fig. 3f). The remaining linker helices sit essentially parallel to the membrane surface, 
stacking above and below one another through a series of hydrophobic patches on adjacent 
faces (Fig. 3g). The linker region also contacts a helix from the very C-terminus of NOMPC, 
with residues from Trp1677 to Gly1689 forming a helix that stacks parallel to the final set of 
linker helices connected to the ARs (Fig. 3g). The extensive hydrophobic contacts between 
layers of linker helices provide a continuous connection from the AR domain via TRP 
domain to the S4-S5 linker and the C-terminus of the S6 helix. This architecture implies that 
the TRP domain may be the key element in linking the AR domains with the gate of the 
channel.
The most striking and unique feature of NOMPC is the architecture of its AR domains. Four 
AR domains that each resembles the shape of a helical-spring bundle together as a 
quadruplex. Along each subunit, there are four major contact points between adjacent 
subunits (Fig. 4a), forming two types of inter-subunit interactions that maintain its overall 
architecture. The first type is between AR24-26 of one subunit and AR16-18 of its neighbor 
to the left (Fig. 4a, upper panel). Near this position, the quadruplex formed by the four AR 
domains reaches its largest diameter. The second type is between AR7-10 of one subunit and 
AR9-12 of its neighbor on its left (Fig. 4a, lower panel), creating a second constriction of the 
AR quadruplex. Both types of interactions are formed by an array of polar residues from 
subunits facing each other. These two contact regions also harbor the sites of mutations that 
affect NOMPC cell surface expression or mechano-gating6. The contact surfaces are 
relatively broad, spanning several ARs in both subunits. Many residues that appear close 
enough to interact across subunits are polar, with a number of possible interacting partners 
on adjacent subunits, potentially allowing different contacts to form and dissolve. Also, side 
chain densities of about half of the polar residues in these interacting regions are not well 
resolved, even though most of the non-polar residues that are in these regions but not 
involved in interaction between AR domains have well resolved side chains. These features 
suggest that neighboring AR domains could move slightly with respect to one another.
Indeed, a reconstruction combining all particles revealed that the local resolution of the AR 
domain is lower than that of the transmembrane and linker domains (Extended Data Fig. 4). 
Further classification of the entire dataset resulted in three major classes (Fig. 4b, Extended 
Data Fig. 8), with slightly different conformations in the N-terminal ARs (Fig. 4c, d) and 
linker helices (Fig. 4e) but similar structure of the transmembrane core (Fig. 4f) with the 
same constriction at Ile1554 that is too narrow to allow the passage of a hydrated ion. 
Relative to the consensus class (Extended Data Fig. 8), from which the high-resolution 
structure was determined, the ARs of Class 1 are closer to the transmembrane domain, while 
the ARs of Class 2 are moved further away (Supplementary Video 1). The linker domain 
also has a subtle counter-clockwise rotation from Class 1 to 2, when viewed from the 
cytosolic side (Fig. 4e). From Class 1 to 2, Tyr411 (AR9) moved ∼3Å along the symmetry 
axis, while Ala1128 (AR29) moved ∼2Å parallel to membrane. It suggests that the

 downward displacement of the ARs (pulling away from membrane) could cause linker 
rotation. In Class 3, the linker positions are similar to those in the consensus class, but the 
distal ARs are displaced outwardly (Supplementary Video 2). Density for the N-terminal 
(lower) ARs is substantially weaker in this class, and the lower junction between AR 
domains appears to have widened, indicating that inter subunit interactions are weaker in 
this region. Superposition of the ARs alone from all classes shows small conformation 
differences of ARs with overall RMSDs of 0.94Å (class 1 vs 2), 1.27Å (class 1 vs 3) and 
1.24Å (class 2 vs 3) (Extended Data Figure 9a). The postulated transitions between three 
classes (Supplementary Video 1-3) suggest that the entire quadruplex architecture is 
relatively flexible, raising the possibility that the spring-shaped ARs can transmit the force 
experienced by the distal N-termini to the linker domain.
It is conceivable that the AR domains could undergo larger deformations than the difference 
noted between classes 1-3. The 24 ARs of Ankyrin-B co-crystallized with a peptide29 
display a spiral substantially different from that seen in NOMPC (Extended Data Fig. 9b), 
and these 24 ARs are capable of undergoing much larger deformations without unfolding14, 
consistent with the idea that large, spring-like motions may be possible for the AR domains 
of NOMPC.
For mechanical gating of NOMPC channel that is conveyed through its AR domain and 
critically dependent on microtubule integrity6, a movement of S6 that widens the 
constriction formed by Ile1554 would be required to open the channel. Comparison of the 
open and closed states of TRPV1 suggests that a rotation of the TRP domain in the plane of 
the membrane accompanied with movement of the S4-S5 linker correlates with pore 
opening22,24. A similar movement of the TRP domain in NOMPC would likely be 
associated with a substantial displacement of the pre-S1 elbow and/or linker helices linked to 
the AR domain. Notably, superimposition of different classes of NOMPC structures 
indicates that a rotation of the TRP domain and its associated linker helices may result from 
movements of the AR domains (Fig. 4e, f). The network of interactions along the linker 
helices establishes a tight connection from the AR domain to the TRP domain that extends 
from S6 and packs against the S4-S5 linker, likely coupling a movement of the AR domain 
to the pore formed by S5, S6 and the intervening re-entrant pore loop.
In cells, the highly conserved AR domain (Extended Data Fig. 10) could in principle be 
displaced in a variety of ways with respect to the membrane (Extended Data Fig. 9c-e). It 
appears that a motion of the AR domain greater than what we observed in the three classes 
would be required to drive channel opening, though we cannot exclude the possibility that 
some of these closed channel conformations correspond to a desensitized state or a captured 
intermediate state during gating transitions (Extended Discussion in Methods). While it is 
unlikely that membrane deformation alone is the driving force in NOMPC gating6, as in the 
case of other mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo and TRAAK channels3-5, 30, the 
proximity of a lipid molecule interacting with the functionally important His1423 at the S4-
S5 linker suggests that lipid protein interactions may play an important role in channel 
activity. It will be of interest to explore the conformational changes that underlie 
mechanogating in future studies. Our structural analysis suggests that the AR domain could 
act as a spring or a knob, linking mechanical displacement to channel opening.

 Methods
Screening of NOMPC orthologues
To identify the best protein for structural analysis, we screened through different NOMPC 
orthologues from Drosophila, zebrafish and Xenopus for high protein expression and 
conformational homogeneity (conservativity of these NOMPC orthologues are shown in 
Exteanded Data Fig. 10). All orthologues were expressed, purified, and analyzed as 
described in more details below for Drosophila NOMPC. In brief, the orthologues were 
expressed in HEK293 GnTi- cells, extracted in detergent followed by affinity purification, 
exchanged into amphipol A8-35, applied to size exclusion chromatography and 
subsequently examined by negative stain EM. Only Drosophila and zebrafish orthologues 
were expressed in sufficient amount for protein purification, with Drosophila NOMPC 
showing narrower peak from size exclusion chromatography as well as more homogeneous 
protein particles with better-organized features from negative EM. Thus, we selected 
Drosophila NOMPC for further studies.
Expression and purification of NOMPC
Full-length Drosophila NOMPC was expressed in HEK293 GnTi- cells using the BacMam 
system as described previously31. In brief, Bacmid for expressing NOMPC tagged with a 
Strep-GFP tag was generated in DH10Bac E. coli cells by transformation of the modified 
pFastBac construct with the mammalian CMV promoter. Baculovirus was generated by 
transfecting Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cultured at 27 °C 
in Sf-900 III SFM (Gibco) with the bacmid using the FuGENE transfection reagent 
(Promega). After that, the baculovirus was amplified twice in Sf9 cells to obtain sufficient 
virus for large-scale infection. HEK293 GnTi- (ATCC) cells were grown in suspension at 
37 °C in ESF SFM Serum-Free Medium (Expression Systems LLC) supplemented with 1% 
FBS. When the cells reached a density of 1.5-2×106 cells/mL, baculovirus was added to the 
culture (10-15%, v/v). After 24 hours, the culture was supplemented with 10 mM sodium 
butyrate to boost the expression, then further incubated at 30 °C for 48 hours before harvest.
Protein purification and sample processing prior to cryo-EM grid preparation was all carried 
out at 4 °C. Approximately 4 g cell pellet (from ∼0.5 L culture) was resuspended and lysed 
by stirring for 20 min in 50 mL hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 1 mM 
EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) supplemented with 1× complete protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl (PMSF). The membrane fraction was 
collected by centrifugation (35,000 ×g, 30 minutes), then homogenized with a Dounce 
homogenizer in extraction buffer (20 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1× 
complete protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). Protein was extracted in 50 mL 
extraction buffer plus 2% n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM) and 0.4% Cholesteryl 
hemisuccinate (CHS) with gentle stirring for 2 hours. Afterward, the lysate was cleared by 
centrifugation (35,000 ×g, 1 hour). The protein sample in DDM+CHS was then mixed with 
2.5 mL CNBr-activated sepharose resin (GE healthcare) coupled with anti-GFP nanobody32 
and incubated with inversion overnight. On the second day, the resin was collected on a 
column by gravity and washed with 10× column volume of wash buffer (WB) containing 20 
mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% DDM, 0.01% CHS, 1 mM EDTA supplemented

 with 0.1mg/ml 3:1:1 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):1-
palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE): 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG). The washed resin was incubated quiescently 
with 2.5 mL WB containing 0.2 mg TEV protease overnight to cleave the Strep-GFP tag and 
release the protein.
Same procedures were followed to purify NOMPC with Strep-GFP tag retained except that 
Strep-Tactin sepharose (IBA Lifesciences) was used for affinity purification and the protein 
was eventually eluted by 2.5 mM desthiobiotin (Sigma) in WB.
Amphipol exchange and nanodisc reconstitution
The concentration of retrieved protein was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. 
For amphipol exchange, the protein sample was mixed with amphipols A8-35 (1:3, w/w) 
with gentle agitation overnight. Subsequently, 1 mL sample was applied to a Superose-6 
column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with column buffer (CB, 20 mM Bicine pH 8.5, 500 
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Further concentration or freeze-thaw of peak collections from size 
exclusion chromatography causes protein aggregation. The peak fraction corresponding to 
tetrameric NOMPC at a concentration of ∼0.6 mg/ml was immediately examined by 
negative stain EM (after 10 fold dilution) and used for cryo-EM grid preparation.
For nanodisc reconstitution, lipid was prepared as described previously17 except that the 
lipid was rehydrated with water. The protein sample in DDM+CHS was mixed with 
MSP2N2 and soy PC (Avanti) at a molar ratio of NOMPC monomer:MSP2N2:soy 
PC=1:4:100. The mixture was incubated with constant rotation for four days. During the 
first three days, Bio-beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) were supplemented to the mixture once a day 
(3:100, v/v) to initiate the reconstitution by gradually removing detergents from the system. 
Afterward, the reconstituted sample was cleared by passing through a mini column, and then 
applied to a Superose-6 column equilibrated with CB. The peak fractions were collected, 
concentrated to ∼3 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra filter device (100-kDa MWCO, Millipore), 
examined by negative stain EM followed by immediate cryo-EM grid preparation.
EM sample preparation and data acquisition
Electron microscopy data was acquired and processed as described previously, with some 
minor modifications16. First, samples were assessed by negative stain EM to determine 
suitability for cryoEM33. Briefly, 2.5 μL of sample at 20-50 μg/mL was applied to a glow 
discharged continuous carbon grid, which was then treated with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate. 
These grids were imaged on a Tecnai T12 microscope (FEI Company) operated at 120 kV 
and at a nominal magnification of 52,000× using an UltraScan 4000 camera (Gatan), 
corresponding to a pixel size of 2.02 Å on the specimen.
Grids for cryo-EM were prepared with CP3 (Gatan). C-flat R1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids 
(Protochips) were glow-discharged for 30s. Then 2.5μL protein sample at a concentration of 
∼3mg/mL was applied onto the carbon face of the grids. The grids were blotted with 
Whatman #1 filter paper on the carbon side and bare plastic on the back side with an offset 
of -1 for 2.5 seconds at 92% humidity and plunge frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid 
nitrogen. The grids were loaded onto a 300 kV Polara (FEI) with a K2 Summit direct

 electron detector (Gatan). Data were collected at nominal magnification of 31,000×, 
corresponding to a physical pixel size of 1.22 Å (0.61 Å super resolution pixel size) on the 
specimen with a dose rate of 10 electrons per physical pixel per second. Images were 
recorded with SerialEM34 in super-resolution counting mode and a defocus range of -1.5 to 
-3.0 μm. A total exposure of 8s was used, with 0.2s subframes (40 total frames) to give a 
total dose of 54 electrons per Å2 (1.35 electrons per Å2 per subframe).
Cryo-EM grids of NOMPC in amphipols were prepared similarly, and Cryo-EM images 
were first collected at the Janelia CryoEM facility Titan Krios (FEI Company) microscope 
operated at 300kV and equipped with a Cs corrector and a post-GIF K2 camera. Cryo-EM 
images were collected with an energy selection slit of 20 eV and a physical pixel size of 1.35 
Å. This yielded an initial reconstruction at ∼4.8 Å (data not shown) from ∼121,000 particles 
selected from 3,720 images by one round of 2D classification and two rounds of 3D 
classification in Relion. Subsequent data were collected on the UCSF Polara as above, 
yielding the amphipol reconstruction shown here.
Image Processing
For negative stain data, Simplified Application Managing Utilities for EM Labs (SAMUEL) 
scripts were used for image processing, particle picking and 2D classification16. In this 
package, 2D classification was carried out by ten cycles of correspondence analysis, k-
means classification and multi-reference alignment using SPIDER operations ‘CA S’, ‘CL 
KM’ and ‘AP SH’35. For cryo-EM data, dose-fractionated super-resolution image stacks 
were drift corrected and binned 2×2 by Fourier cropping using MotionCor2 (ref 36) (after 
discarding the first two frames). Motion-corrected sums without dose-weighting were used 
for CTF determination using GCTF37. Motion-corrected sums with dose-weighting were 
used for all other image processing, including particle picking. Particle picking, 2D 
classification, 3D classification and refinement procedures were carried out using both 
RELION1.4 and RELION 2 (ref 38). An ab initio 3D reconstruction was generated from a 
small initial cryo dataset using the program PRIME implemented in the Simple package39. 
This reconstruction was then filtered to 60 Å resolution and used as an initial reference 
model for 3D auto-refinement in RELION. All 3D refinements were carried out following 
the gold-standard procedure in which the dataset is divided into two half sets and refined 
independently. 3D reconstruction was first calculated and refined without symmetrization 
(C1). Since no obvious asymmetric features were seen, C4 symmetry was then applied 
throughout the refinement. After refinement had converged, the final dataset was subjected 
to ‘post-processing’ in RELION, in which a soft mask was calculated and applied to the two 
half-maps before calculating the corrected Fourier shell correlation (FSC) and the resolution 
was estimated using FSC=0.143 criterion40 on the corrected FSC curves in which the 
influences of the mask were removed. Temperature-factor estimation and map sharpening 
were also performed in this step. Local resolution estimates were calculated with 
unsharpened raw density maps using the ResMap41.
Model building
Ab initio model building was carried out in COOT42. Initial placement of the TM helices 
was made based on sequence alignment with TRPV1 and TRPA1. A rough model of the N-

 terminal AR domain was built by positioning individual Ankyrin repeats (pdb code: 4RLV) 
into EM density for each of the 29 Ankyrin repeats. Sequence register was then determined 
by assigning aromatic and other residues with bulky sidechains to well-resolved densities in 
the final sharpened density map. The linker domain, which is largely α -helical, was then 
built by connecting the two domains, with large, well-resolved side-chains serving as 
markers. After building by hand, the model was refined in PHENIX43 using 10 cycles of 
real-space refinement and the electron scattering table. Problematic regions and 
Ramachandran outliers were then manually corrected in COOT, followed by an additional 
10 cycles of real-space refinement in PHENIX. For cross-validation, the final model was 
refined against one of the half maps generated in RELION. FSC curves were then calculated 
between the refined model and half map 1 (‘work’, used in test refinement), the refined 
model and half map 2 (‘free’, not used in test refinement) and the refined model and the 
summed map. There is no significant gap between ‘work’ and ‘free’ FSC curves, indicating 
little effect of over-fitting. Additional validation of the model was carried out using 
MolProbity44 and EMRinger45 (Supplementary Information Table 1). The program 
CAVER46 was used to calculate the pore profile shown in Figure 3. The program PyMol was 
used to calculate surface representation of electrostatic potentials.
Microtubule-binding assay by TIRF microscopy
Microtubules were prepared as previously described47. Unlabeled tubulin was mixed with 
biotinylated tubulin and Alexa-640 labeled tubulin at a ratio of ∼10:2:2 in BRB80 buffer (80 
mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgCl2). 5 mM GTP was added and the 
mixture was incubated in a 37°C water bath for 10 minutes. Afterward 20 μM of Taxol was 
added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 50 minutes at 37°C. Microtubules 
were spun over a 25% sucrose cushion at 160,000 ×g for 10 minutes in a tabletop centrifuge 
prior to use.
Flow chambers with attached microtubules were performed as described48. 5mg/ml of 
biotin-BSA was flowed into a 15uL chamber. After 5 minutes, the chamber was washed with 
BRB80, and 0.5mg/ml of streptavidin was flowed in. After 5 minutes, the chamber was 
washed and microtubules were flowed in and incubated for 10 minutes. Afterward the 
chamber was washed briefly with BRB80 and then assay buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 
mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol 0.1 mg/ml 
Biotin-BSA, 0.5% pluronic acid F-127, and 0.2 mg/ml κ-casein). 70nM of NOMPC-Strep-
GFP in amphipol or Strep-GFP was then flowed in and allowed to incubate for 2-3 minutes 
before washing and imaging. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) images were 
acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TE200-E microscope by μManager software49.
NOMPC mutagenesis and cell recording
All point mutations were introduced to nompC gene in the pBluescript vector by site-
directed mutagenesis (quick change), and verified by sequencing the entire coding region of 
nompC.
For patch recording in HEK293 GnTi- cells, nompC in the pFastBac-CMV-GFP vector was 
transfected with FuGENE transfection reagent (Promega) into HEK293 GnTi- cells plated

 on glass coverslips. Transfected cells were ready for patch recording after cultured in 
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 30 °C for 36-48 hours. For patch recording 
in Drosophila S2 cells, wild type and mutant nompC genes were sub-cloned into the 
pUAST-GFP vector and subsequently co-transfected with pAc-GAL4 into S2 cells using 
Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN). Transfected cells were then cultured at 25 °C in 
Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% FBS. 24-48 hours after 
transfection, the cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with 0.2 mg/mL 
Concanavalin A (Con A, Sigma) 20 minutes prior to recording. GFP positive cells identified 
under the fluorescence microscope were used for whole-cell and outside-out recordings as 
described previously6,8. The pipette solution (140 mM potassium Gluconic acid, 10 mM 
HEPES pH 7.3) and the bath solution (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3) were adjusted 
to 295 mOsm and 305 mOsm respectively with sucrose. The electrical resistance of patch 
electrodes filled with pipette solution is 4-6 MΩ. Mechanical stimuli were given via a High 
Speed Pressure Clamp (HSPC, ALA-scientific) following established procedures6,8. 
Mechanogated currents were measured at -60 mV. Electrical signals were sampled at 10 kHz 
and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz with the Multiclamp 700B amplifier, DIGIDITA 1440A. Data 
were recorded and processed with Clampex 10.3 (Molecular Devices).
Immunohistochemistry
Non-permeabilized cell staining was performed as previously described7. In brief, an 
antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope of NOMPC (rabbit anti-NOMPC-EC7) was 
diluted (1:100) in serum free medium without detergent and incubated for 30 minutes with 
transfected S2 cells attached on Con A coated coverslip. Afterward, the cells were washed 
three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at 4°C. The fixed 
cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and subsequently incubated with Alexa 555 
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 
minutes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST). After brief wash with PBST, 
samples were mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting media (Vector Laboratories). 
Images were acquired on a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope.
Extended Discussion
As indicated by our NOMPC structure and electrophysiological data, and comparison with 
other TRP channels22-24, the movements of transmembrane helices required for the pore to 
adapt an open conformation would likely be associated with a substantial displacement of 
the pre-S1 elbow and/or linker helices, which could propagate to the AR domain (or in the 
case of mechanical gating, this would propagate from the AR domain). Previous studies 
showed that NOMPC channel gating in response to mechanical stimulation is conveyed 
through its AR domain and critically dependent on microtubule integrity6. In this study, we 
show that purified NOMPC also decorates microtubules (Extended Data Figure 1b), likely 
with its N-terminus interacting with microtubule. Movement of microtubules could then 
cause AR domain to be displaced in a variety of ways with respect to the membrane: lateral 
movement, pushing or pulling against the membrane, or even twisting (Extended Data 
Figure 9c). Conceivably these motions may impact channel gating; it is possible that only 
one such movement (or a subset of these movements) can cause channel opening.

 Our structural analysis suggests that the AR domains possess some degree of flexibility. 
However, the closed pore conformation of all three classes characterized in this study could 
indicate that such small motions may not be sufficient to cause channel opening. It appears 
that a motion of the AR domain greater than what we observed in the three classes would be 
required to activate the channel. The ability to deform is likely to be an important functional 
aspect of this unique spring-shaped quadruplex architecture. The linker domain can tolerate 
small movement without inducing channel activation suggesting that forces below a certain 
threshold do not lead to channel activation. This may help attenuate response and prevent 
unwanted channel opening due to small mechanical movements. In addition, this flexibility 
may allow the channel to deform rather than break outright in response to very strong 
stimuli. Another possibility is that some of these closed channel conformations correspond 
to a desensitized state or a captured intermediate state during gating transitions, perhaps 
analogous to some of the voltage-gated channel structures with the voltage sensor in the 
activated state and the pore still in the closed (pre-open) state50.
Sensitivity to mechanical stimulation, on the other hand, likely results from the extensive 
network that connects the cytoplasmic ARs via the linker helices to the TRP domain and the 
S4-S5 linker, and possibly other structural elements in their vicinity. This bridge between the 
transmembrane core and AR domains is probably the key to translate ARs movement into 
displacement of residues constricting the pore, leading to channel opening. The path of force 
transmission is likely through the TRP domain, and it may also involve the S4-S5 linker, 
which appears to interact with a lipid molecule.

The flowchart of classification procedures with RELION is shown. After 1 round of 2D 
classification, 190,879 particles were subjected to 3D refinement, yielding a 3.7Å map (C4 
imposed). Following 3D classification of these particles, 175,314 particles were selected and 
refined, yielding the final map at 3.55Å resolution (C4 imposed), which was used to build 
the ‘consensus model’. Additional classification of these 175,314 particles using a mask to 
exclude all regions outside the AR domain gave 3 major classes, which were subsequently 
refined to ∼3.8-4.0Å resolution.

 Extended Data Figure 9. Flexibility of AR domains and model of NOMPC mechanogating
a, Superposition of NOMPC AR domains from three classes are shown in three views as 
indicated. Overall, the entire AR domains from all three classes overlap well with each other. 
There are small differences in some ARs, which is caused by slight shift of individual AR as 
rigid body, suggesting small mobility and plasticity of the AR domain. b, Superposition of 
NOMPC AR domain (blue) with human Ankyrin-B AR domain (pink) shown in three views 
as indicated, suggesting that elastic deformation of NOMPC AR domain under pressure 
could potentially be more dramatic than the shift presumably caused by thermal motion as 
shown in a. A peptide from the C-terminal region of Ankyrin-R, which was added to 
stabilize Ankyrin-B ARs for crystallization by forming an auto-inhibitory segment (AS) 
structure, is also shown here (AnkR AS, in orange). c, Schematic of NOMPC (without 
precise depiction of domain swap between neighboring subunits) showing the N-terminus 
tethered to a microtubule. Mechanical force is transduced from the microtubule cytoskeleton 
to NOMPC, possibly causing lateral movement, extension, compression or torsion of the AR 
domain. d, e, Movement of the AR domain that immediately precedes the linker helices 
results in displacement of the TRP domain and S4-S5 linker that are connected to the ends 
of the pore domain, triggering channel opening.

 Figure 1. 3D reconstruction of NOMPC
a–d, NOMPC density map in nanodisc (EMD-8702). Unsharpened (transparent) and 
sharpened (solid and color coded) maps are shown, from side (a, b), top (c) and bottom (d). 
e, Diagram illustrating major structural domains of one subunit, color coded to match ribbon 
diagrams in f. Dashed lines denote regions where the density map is insufficient for model 
building. ARs 1-7 are colored in pale red because its density is insufficient to position side 
chains. f, Ribbon diagram showing one NOMPC subunit denoting specific domains (pdb 
code: 5VKQ).

 Figure 2. Architecture of the ion permeation pathway of NOMPC
a, Solvent-accessible pathway along the ion permeation pore illustrated as blue surface. 
Residues located at the selectivity filter and lower gate are rendered as sticks. b, Top view of 
the NOMPC pore region is shown in surface representation, colored by the electrostatic 
potentials (negative: red; positive: blue).

 Figure 3. Lipid-protein and linker domain interactions
a, The transmembrane domains of two adjacent subunits are shown in blue and red from the 
cytosolic face (left) and with the cytosolic domain facing down (right). The lipid bound to 
the S4-S5 linker of the red subunit is colored green. b, Enlarged view of boxed region of 
NOMPC shows the density map (green mesh) of the lipid superimposed with an atomic 
model of the bound phospholipid. The side chain of His1423 from the S4–S5 linker is close 
(∼2.9Å) to the lipid headgroup, and the adjacent His1424 is further away (∼4.8Å). c, 
Representative traces of mechanogated current of wild type NOMPC and NOMPC mutants 
(H1423A, H1424A, K1573A and W1572A) under pressure ranged from 10 mmHg to 50 
mmHg with 10 mmHg increment, recorded by outside-out patch clamp. The H1424A and 
K1573A mutations are negative controls showing that not any random mutation in the S4-S5 
linker or TRP domain abolishes mechanogated current of NOMPC. d-g, Enlarged views 
from the boxed regions showing key interactions between residues from interacting domains. 
Hydrogen bonds are indicated as dashed lines (d, e). EM density is shown in mesh (f).

 Figure 4. Motion of the AR domain
a, Interactions between the adjacent ARs. Residues with charged and polar side chains are 
indicated as colored balls (negative: red; positive: blue). b, Three sub-classes with different 
conformation in ARs. c-f, Comparison of class 1 and 2 at different positions along the ARs 
and linker domain. The ARs shifted vertically along the symmetry axis at the lower junction 
in the vicinity of AR9 (c) and laterally relative to the symmetry axis above the upper 
junction, at AR29 (d). While there is no obvious vertical movement at the linker regions, 
there is a small domain rotation (e and f).
