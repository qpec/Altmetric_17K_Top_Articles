IMPORTANCE Sunscreen use is a modifiable behavior that can help reduce the risk for skin
cancer, prevent sunburns, mitigate photoaging, and treat photosensitive dermatoses.
A better understanding of consumer sunscreen preferences would inform dermatologists
in their own recommendations.
OBJECTIVE To determine the characteristics and the most commonly cited positive and
negative features of highly rated sunscreens described by consumers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The top 1 percentile of sunscreen products on
Amazon.com as of December 2015 was selected according to average consumer review
(�4 stars) and the highest number of consumer reviews. Descriptive data for each product
were collected from the product page and manufacturer claims. The top 5 “most helpful”
reviews (positive and critical) were analyzed and coded by a consensus qualitative coding
scheme, which included positive and negative descriptors in 6 major categories according to
consumer comments: affordability, cosmetic elegance, separate ratings, product ingredients,
product performance, and skin compatibility.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine
whether characteristics of each product (eg, American Academy of Dermatology [AAD]
criteria, sun protection factor [SPF], or vehicle) could be used to predict price per ounce.
The number (percentage) of comments categorized by major themes and subthemes was
determined. Illustrative consumer comments were also collected.
RESULTS There were 6500 products categorized as sunscreens in the Amazon.com, online
catalog. Of the 65 products evaluated, the median price per ounce was $3.32 (range,
$0.68-$23.47). Of products, 40% (26 of 65) did not adhere to AAD guidelines (broad
spectrum, SPF �30, and water resistant) for sunscreens. Vehicles, fulfillment of AAD criteria,
and sunscreen type predicted a higher price per ounce. Cosmetic elegance was the most cited
positive feature (198 of 325 [61%] comments) followed by product performance (146 of 325
[45%] comments) and skin type compatibility (78 of 325 [24%] comments).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort of highly rated sunscreen products, a significant
proportion did not adhere to AAD guidelines, mostly attributable to a lack of water resistance.
The most striking variation in this cohort was price, which varied by more than 3000%.
Dermatologists should balance the importance of cosmetic elegance, cost, and AAD
guidelines for sun protection in making their recommendations to consumers.

S
unscreen use is a modifiable behavior proven to reduce
theriskforskincancers,preventphotoaging,reducesun-
burns, and control photosensitive dermatoses. Despite
these results, sunscreen use remains persistently low for ado-
lescents and adults.1 Insufficient sunscreen use is likely a mul-
tifactorial problem. Consumer preferences and recommenda-
tions likely drive sunscreen use but have not been well
investigated previously. Understanding these factors will help
health care professionals learn about meaningful patient con-
siderations regarding sunscreens to increase their sustained
use for preventive health.
In 2012, the market for sunscreens was expected to be-
come a $1 billion industry by 2016 with an expansive range of
marketedsunscreenproducts.2Ofconsumers,73%buybeauty
and personal care products through Amazon.com, which to-
tals an estimated 9% of all sunscreen sales occurring with this
online retailer.3 Previous work showed that online customer-
reported reviews of consumer products have a powerful
effect on purchasing decisions.4 Understanding the charac-
teristics of consumer reviews for highly consumer-rated
sunscreens would provide useful information for dermatolo-
gists to help inform their recommendations to patients.
Methods
The keyword sunscreens was searched in the broader cat-
egory of “Beauty and Skin Care” products on the US internet
retailer Amazon.com. From the results, we determined the top
1percentileofsunscreenproductsaccordingtotheaveragecon-
sumer review (≥4 stars) and the number of consumer reviews
(>150 reviews) (eTable in the Supplement). Descriptive data
for each product, including SPF strength, price, and active in-
gredients, were also collected. Sunscreen products marketed
for the face, body, and children were included. Tanning
lotions and oral sun protection capsules were excluded. For
products with multiple-size options, the product with the
highest number of reviews was included in the analysis and
coded as 1 entry. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to associ-
ateaproduct’
sdescriptivecharacteristicswithpriceperounce.
For each sunscreen product, the content of the top 5 most
helpful positive and critical comments as voted by consum-
ers (325 total comments) was analyzed. Reviewer character-
istics, such as skin type, age, and prior dermatological condi-
tions, were not consistently available on the Amazon.com
platform. Three of us (S.X., M.K., and A.A.) developed, com-
pared, and reconciled a single, standard qualitative coding
scheme. Two of us (M.K. and A.A.) coded consumer-reported
commentsforpositiveandnegativedescriptorswithmajorcat-
egories,includingaffordability,cosmeticelegance,separaterat-
ings,productingredients,productperformance,andskincom-
patibility.Foreachmajorcategory,subthemeswerealsocoded.
Cosmetic elegance was defined as any feature associated with
skin sensation on application, color, or scent. Product perfor-
mance included SPF and real-world effectiveness in prevent-
ing sunburn, and product ingredients focused on the sun-
screen’
s active and inactive ingredients. Skin compatibility
reflected how the product performed in association with skin
conditions cited by reviewers. Comments may have multiple
subcodes for a given major category (eg, a product was noted
to be nongreasy and have a pleasant scent). Of entries, 20%
(65 comments) were coded by one of us (S.X.) to ensure inter-
nal validity as previously reported.5,6 This study was deemed
exempt by the institutional review board at Northwestern
University.
Results
There were 6500 products categorized as sunscreens in the
Amazon.com online catalog. The top 65 products were
selected first by ratings (≥4 stars). This group was then
ranked by the number of consumer reviews (a surrogate for
popularity) to finalize the cohort. Our calculations revealed
that the top 1 percentile of Amazon.com sunscreen products
acquired more than 24 400 customer reviews as of December
2015. The median review rating was 4.5 of 5 stars with a
median of 288 customer reviews (range, 178-1792 reviews)
per product. Price per ounce was highly variable. The median
price per ounce was $3.32 (range, $0.68-$23.47). The median
SPF was 35 (range, 4-110), with 89% (58 of 65) of products
being 30 or higher. Sunscreens with an active chemical ingre-
dient were most common (40%; 26 of 65) followed by physi-
cal sunscreens (32%; 21 of 65) and a combination of chemical
and physical sunscreens (25%; 16 of 65). Of products, 92%
(60 of 65) had a broad-spectrum claim and 62% (40 of 65)
were labeled as water or sweat resistant. For vehicles, creams
were the most common (49%; 32 of 65) followed by lotions
(29%; 19 of 65) and sprays (11%; 7 of 65). Nearly all products
(88%; 57 of 65) had additional claims associated with being
sensitive skin compatible, preservative-free, natural and/or
organic, noncomedogenic, or animal safe. Of the highest
rated sunscreen products on Amazon.com, 40% (26 of 65)
did not adhere to AAD criteria (SPF ≥30, broad-spectrum
claim, and water and/or sweat resistance). Sunscreens that
adhered to AAD criteria or had water resistance were associ-
ated with higher cost (P < .001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Physical
sunscreens were more expensive than chemical sunscreens
(P = .001). From highest to lowest cost, creams were more
Key Points
Question What are the characteristics and features of sunscreens
that consumers rate favorably?
Findings In this analysis of the top 1 percentile of sunscreen
products on an online retailer, consumers preferred sunscreen
products predominately for their cosmetic elegance followed by
product performance. The cohort had a wide range of prices
($0.68-$23.47 per ounce), with 40% (26 of 65) of highly rated
products not adhering to the American Academy of Dermatology’
s
recommended criteria for sunscreens, mostly owing to a lack of
water and/or sweat resistance.
Meaning Dermatologists should balance the importance of
cosmetic elegance, cost, and adequate sun protection in making
their recommendations to consumers.

In analyzing the top-voted comments for each product,
several consonant themes emerged. First, cosmetic elegance
was the most cited positive feature associated with sun-
screen products (61%; 198 of 325) followed by product perfor-
mance (45%; 146 of 325). Skin compatibility (24%; 78 of 325)
and product ingredients (17%; 55 of 325) were cited less com-
monly as positive features. A few consumer reviews cite sepa-
rate ratings (12%; 39 of 325) and price (9%; 29 of 325) as posi-
tive features. Second, when negative features were cited,
patients mostly noted cosmetic elegance concerns (22%; 72 of
325). Product performance (11%; 36 of 325), product ingredi-
ents (10%; 33 of 325), and expense (9%; 29 of 325) were com-
parable as negatively cited features. Only a few reviewers
cited skin compatibility concerns, formulation changes, and
separate ratings as negative features.
An analysis of the subthemes confirmed more specific de-
terminants of consumer preferences with sunscreens. Catego-
rizedincosmeticelegance,thesubthemesof“rubsinwell”and
“positive tactile skin feel” were most commonly cited. Third,
productresidueandthicknesswerethemostcommonnegative

tivefeatures.Forskincompatibility,sunscreensthatdidnotcause
acne were most commonly cited as a positive feature (13%; 42

ingredients were cited specifically as positive features (10%;

high cost were not commonly cited as positive or negative
concerns (9%; 29 of 325) (Table 3).
Discussion
For our cohort, cosmetic elegance was the most commonly
citedpositivefeature.Qualitativeresearchwithconsumerspro-
vides insight into the consumer attitude when it comes to sun-
screens.Priorresearchhasshownthatpeopleapplymoreprod-
uct when it spreads easily. Increased use means producing
photoprotection that more closely reflects the expected
photoprotectionorSPF.7,8Ourqualitativeanalysisprovidesem-
pirical evidence of this as well. In cosmetic elegance, consum-
ers frequently cited the subtheme of rubs in well. Our results
clarify features identified by previously published studies
indicating consumer preference for sunscreens that specifi-
cally did not leave residues and were not greasy.9
For product effectiveness, the sunscreen SPF was not fre-
quently cited as a positive feature, which may be associated
with a lack of consumer understanding of SPF10 or preselec-
tion of high SPF products. Real-world product performance,
such as “effective” and “did not sunburn,
” were how consum-
ers described product effectiveness, which makes the results
difficult to interpret because variables such as UV index, ex-
posure time, amount of sunscreen applied, and consumer skin
type are not clearly specified. However, most of our cohort in-
clude sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or greater (89%; 58 of 65),
which should have provided adequate protection with proper
use. The emphasis on effectiveness, even among this high SPF
cohort, could reflect patient misunderstanding of the differ-
ence between expected and produced photoprotection.
For skin compatibility, most products claimed additional
product features in addition to sun protection, including safe
for sensitive skin, preservative-free, or noncomedogenic. Pa-
tients should be counseled that these labels are marketing
mechanismsinsteadofperformancestandardssuchasSPFregu-
lated by the US Food and Drug Administration, although these
factors may have equal importance to patients and should be
discussed to promote products that satisfy both areas. Prod-
uct ingredients and separate ratings were less commonly cited
features. Physical sunscreen ingredients (zinc and titanium ox-
ide) were more likely to be cited as positive features, whereas
nanoparticles (6 comments) were the most commonly cited
negative feature regarding product ingredients. Active ingredi-
ents zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, particularly micronized
versions, offer superior UV-A protection and photostability.11
Asmall,noticeableamountofdetailedcommentscitedthe
Environmental Working Group ratings (22 comments) for pur-
chasing decisions surrounding product safety. Environmen-
tal Working Group was cited more often than dermatologist
recommended (18 comments) regarding positive product fea-
tures. This group describes itself as a nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization and determines its sunscreen rankings accord-
ing to manufacturer and toxicology databases without sec-
ondary verification of product performance.12 Negative cos-
metic elegance was the most frequently cited feature followed
by product performance and skin compatibility. This study is
limited to highly rated products, making interpretation of the
negative comments more difficult to generalize.
Analogous to Consumer Reports’review of sunscreens,13
our cohort also had a wide range of prices with a difference be-
tween the least and most expensive products ($0.68-$23.47
per ounce). Cost is an important consideration, especially for
those with an increased risk of developing skin cancer, such
aspatientswhounderwentanorgantransplantforwhomregu-
lar photoprotection is recommended. For these patients, the
cost of daily sunscreen use can range from $249 to $292 per
year. If used daily for 1 week, sunscreen cost for a family of 4
can range from $178 to $238.14 Although expense was not fre-
quently cited as a negative feature, previous studies showed
that expensive sunscreens may compel patients to use less.15,16
Dermatologists are often asked by patients to recommend sun-
screen products.17 Health care professionals should incorpo-
rate cost-conscious recommendations of sunscreens for
patients, particularly in skin cancer prevention.
The AAD has published guidelines recommending sun-
screen products that have an SPF of 30 or higher, broad-
spectrum coverage, and water and sweat resistance.16 A sig-
nificant proportion (29%; 19 of 65) in our cohort of highly rated
sunscreens did not adhere to AAD guidelines solely owing to
a lack of water or sweat resistance claims. Because many prod-
ucts in our cohort were comarketed as moisturizers or daily
beauty products, water-resistant products would not be a criti-
cal feature. Consumers may choose a non–water-resistant
sunscreen product with more favorable cosmetic elegance.

Because water exposure reduces the efficacy of sunscreens
when a person is sweating or immersed in water, water-
resistant products are often reserved for use in water-related
activities or sports with profuse sweating. Previous studies
showed that two-thirds of sunscreen products are advertised
as cosmetics (38%; 25 of 65) or moisturizers (26%; 17 of 65),
whereas a minority were advertised as a stand-alone
sunscreen (19%; 12 of 65).18 These findings may cause con-
sumer confusion regarding what makes up an adequate sun-
screen product. A small but significant proportion (11%; 7 of
65) of the cohort had an SPF of less than 30. Physicians should
educate consumers on these key considerations. Nine of 10 of
the least costly sunscreen products in the cohort did adhere
to AAD guidelines.
There are several important limitations in this study.
Although these data sources represent 9% of all sunscreen

a There were 65 sunscreen products in the cohort.
bThe qualitative coding of the top 5 most helpful comments (positive and
critical) voted by consumers for each product in the entire cohort is
summarized. As expected, positive features were much more likely to be cited
than negative features. The features were similar in themes but opposite in
valence. Cosmetic elegance was the most cited positive and negative feature
followed by product performance, skin compatibility, and product ingredients.
When investigating specific subthemes, consumers most commonly cited how
the product absorbed as a positive and negative feature. Exemplary quotes
were only included for all features cited with more than 5% (>3) of the total
comments assessed.

sales, the generalizability may be limited because of the lack
of reviewer demographic information. Another limitation of
this study was the use of higher-rated product reviews as a sur-
rogate for product popularity. Research in product marketing
suggests that online review measurements, specifically vol-
ume and valence, directly influence product sales.19-21 Of our
cohort, 46% (30 of 65) was also in Amazon.com’
s top 100 best
sellers list in the sun protection category. We believe that our
cohort mitigates the volatility that exists with best seller lists,
which are updated hourly. This frequent updating may change
theexactproductnameandreviewnumberofsunscreens.Fur-
therworkcomparingourcohort’
srepresentationwiththecata-
log of other major online retailers would provide further in-
sight. Finally, a limitation of using the AAD guidelines is that
consumers who use sunscreen daily and do not engage in
sweat-producing activities or water sports may appropriately
choose not to use water-resistant sunscreens.
Although our data showed that dermatologist recommen-
dations were not a significantly cited positive feature, derma-
tologists are the most likely physicians (86%) to recommend
sunscreen use in all outpatient visits where sunscreen use is
mentioned.22 Frequently, patients with skin concerns ask for
nonprescription product recommendations from dermatolo-
gists. Dermatologists should be aware of the implications of
their recommendations, particularly regarding cost and con-
sumerpreferences.WithrecentlegislationallowingtheUSFood
and Drug Administration to rapidly advance the approval of
additionalsunscreens,consumersanddermatologistswillhave
more product options to consider soon.23 Although sun-
screen products available in Europe have better UV absorp-
tion performance, there is limited empirical evidence that this
leads to lower skin carcinogenesis in clinical practice.24 Ulti-
mately, dermatologists must remain informed of the contin-
ued evolution of sunscreen products and consumer prefer-
ences to improve use.
Conclusions
There is wide variability in price, SPF protection, and prod-
uct claims among commercially available sunscreens. Con-
sumer comments show that cosmetic elegance is the most im-
portant positive feature, followed by product performance.
Dermatologists should counsel patients that sunscreen prod-
ucts come with numerous marketing claims and varying cos-
metic applicability, all of which must be balanced with ad-
equate photoprotection. In addition, consumers should be
advised to select a product with broad-spectrum coverage, an
SPF of 30 or higher, and water and/or sweat resistance in the
setting of water activities or high ambient temperatures. Our
list provides dermatologists, other health care professionals,
and patients with a cohort of sunscreen products organized by
consumer preference, ranked by price or rating, and detailed
information regarding how those products adhered to sun-
screen performance standards together with their consumer
reviews.

NOTABLE NOTES
A Probable Case of Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia Encountered in Mark Twain’s Autobiography
Alexandra C. Villasante Fricke, MD; Mariya Miteva, MD
In Mark Twain’
s autobiography, he describes visiting his uncle’
s farm-
housein1847MissouriwhereanelderlyAfricanAmericanslavewoman,
“
Aunt Hannah,”lived.1 She had “
a round bald place on the crown of her
head”and every summer for 5 or 6 years the children “used to creep
aroundandgazeatitinreverentsilence.”
1AuntHannah’
salopeciaismost
likely central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) based on the pat-
tern, distribution, demographics, and the demonstrated irreversibility
over at least 5 or 6 years.
CCCA is a scarring alopecia that typically begins on the crown or
vertexandgraduallyexpandscentrifugally.2Itisthemostcommoncause
of scarring alopecia among women of African descent. CCCA was first
called“hotcombalopecia”in1958.Throughtheyearsithasbeenattrib-
uted to chemical relaxers and grooming styles, but recent data suggest
that it may be a heritable condition.2
InWestAfricansocietiesinthe1500s,hairgroomingincludedcomb-
ing, braiding, twisting, shaving, and dyeing as well as using herbal oint-
ments, clay, and palm oil.3 In the United States, most African slaves did
not have access to resources for grooming, and covering the hair with
kerchiefswascommon.3Slaveswhoworkedinsideoftenworebraidsand
plaits.Itwasafterthetransatlanticslavetradewasoutlawedin1808that
plantation owners encouraged grooming so that slaves would appear
healthyfordomestictrade.Cornmealandkerosenewereusedascleans-
ers, coffee as dye, and kitchen fats as moisturizers. After application of
moisturizer, a heated butter knife was used to style the hair into curls,
and curls were set around cotton on Sundays. Men used axle grease to
dyeandstraightenhair.Homemaderelaxersmixinglyeandpotatoeswere
used infrequently as they were very caustic.3
Heated flat iron plates were not commonly used until the late 19th
century.3In1905MadamC.J.Walkercreatedanointmentthatwasmeant
to moisturize and grow hair, but in combination with a hot comb also
straightened hair. The first commercial chemical hair relaxer was in-
vented in 1905 by African American Garrett Augustus Morgan, who in-
cidentally noticed that polish for sewing needles also straightened fur.
He developed a cream, sold by 1913.3
AuntHannah,bornperhapsaround1760,livedbeforetheeraofhot
combs and hair relaxers. She was likely not afforded time or resources
for personal grooming in her youth. She may have had access to heated
butterknivesorlyeinadulthood,butitislikelythatheruseofthesewas
limited. If our hypothesis about Aunt Hannah’
s diagnosis is correct, this
may support the argument that CCCA is a multifactorial disease with a
possible genetic component.
