In Brief
Vanderweyde et al. show that the
interaction of microtubule associated
protein tau with the RNA binding protein
(RBP) TIA1 regulates stress granule (SG)
formation as well as misfolding and
aggregation of tau. TIA1 knockdown
prevents tau misfolding and tau-
mediated toxicity, which points to RBPs
as potential targets for therapy of
tauopathies.

SUMMARY
Dendritic mislocalization of microtubule associated
protein tau is a hallmark of tauopathies, but the role
of dendritic tau is unknown. We now report that tau
interacts with the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TIA1
in brain tissue, and we present the brain-protein in-
teractome network for TIA1. Analysis of the TIA1 in-
teractome in brain tissue from wild-type (WT) and
tau knockout mice demonstrates that tau is required
for normal interactions of TIA1 with proteins linked to
RNA metabolism, including ribosomal proteins and
RBPs. Expression studies show that tau regulates
the distribution of TIA1, and tau accelerates stress
granule (SG) formation. Conversely, TIA1 knockdown
or knockout inhibits tau misfolding and associated
toxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons, while over-
expressing TIA1 induces tau misfolding and stimu-
lates neurodegeneration. Pharmacological interven-
tions that prevent SG formation also inhibit tau
pathophysiology. These studies suggest that the
pathophysiology of tauopathy requires an intimate
interaction with RNA-binding proteins.
INTRODUCTION
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are a class of about 800 proteins
that function in the nucleus to regulate mRNA maturation,
including splicing, RNA helicase activity, RNA polymerase elon-
gation, and nuclear export (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008).
RBPs also function in the cytoplasm where they regulate RNA
translation, trafficking, sequestration, and degradation. RBP
function is strongly regulated by the multiple signaling cascades
integrated with RNA translation/protein synthesis, which will be
referred to as ‘‘translational signaling.’’ The cytoplasmic actions
of RBPs play a particularly crucial role in neurobiology because
the large distance between the soma and synapse demands a
proportionately large role of RBPs in the trafficking of mRNA
transcripts (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2011).
Increasing evidence links neurological disease processes to
dysfunction of neuronal RBPs, RNA granules, and stress gran-
ules (SGs) (Ramaswami et al., 2013; Wolozin, 2012). SGs are a
particular type of RNA granule that accumulates during the
translational response to stress. RBPs, such as T cell intracel-
lular antigen 1 (TIA1), contain prion-like, poly-glycine-rich do-
mains, which promote their physiological reversible aggregation
(Thomas et al., 2011). Nucleation by core RBPs, such as TIA1, is
followed by recruitment of secondary RBPs to form a mature SG,
which is a key component of stress-induced translational sup-
pression. SGs play a dynamic role in mRNA triage by sorting
sequestered mRNAs for re-initiation, storage, or degradation.
Mutations in multiple RBPs cause motor neuron diseases,
including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Li et al., 2013).
Many of the mutations in RBPs that are linked to disease appear
to increase the tendency of these proteins to aggregate (John-
son et al., 2009; Kwiatkowski et al., 2009). Studies from our lab
and others show that the mutations also increase RNA granule
formation, leading to SGs that are larger and more abundant,
as well as larger and slower transport granules (Alami et al.,
2014; Colombrita et al., 2009; Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010,
2014). Studies with recombinant FUS and hnRNAPA1 indicate
that these proteins exhibit a normal ability to cycle between so-
lution and gel phases, forming liquid droplets. However, muta-
tions in either protein impair the phase transition, leading to for-
mation of stable amyloid-like fibrils (Lin et al., 2015; Molliex et al.,
2015; Nott et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015).
Formation of pathological RNA granules is associated with
neuropathology. For instance, TIA1 co-localizes with neuropa-
thology in brain tissue of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FTDP-17),
frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD-TDP), ALS, Huntington’s
disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, and spinomuscular atrophy,
as well as in animal models of these diseases (Liu-Yesucevitz
et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2011; Vanderweyde et al., 2012;

 Wolozin, 2012). Our previous work suggests that the biology of
tau is intimately linked to TIA1, with the proteins accumulating
concomitantly with each other over the disease course in brain
tissue from subjects with human tauopathies as well as animal
models of tauopathies (Vanderweyde et al., 2012).
We now report that tau promotes SG formation and modulates
the patterns of protein interactions of TIA1, a main SG compo-
nent. The interaction between tau and TIA1 promotes tau misfold-
ing and assembly at the site of SGs and results in the degenera-
tion of processes and stimulation of apoptotic markers in primary
neurons. Reducing TIA1 inhibits tau-misfolding and degeneration
in neuronal cultures. These results indicate that tau plays an
important role in neuronal RBP biology and suggest that RBPs
and SGs contribute to the misfolding of tau. These results also
raise the possibility that the pathophysiology of tauopathies,
such as AD, is associated with dysfunction of RBP biology.
RESULTS
Tau Increases Somatodendritic Localization of TIA1
The distribution of TIA1 was examined in primary cultures of hip-
pocampal neurons from wild-type (WT) and tau�/� mice to inves-
tigate whether tau regulates the distribution of TIA1 (Figure 1A).
Primary hippocampal neurons from tau�/� mice were trans-
duced with TIA1-GFP ± AAV1 WT Tau-V5 or P301L Tau-V5.
TIA1 exhibited a strong nuclear localization in neurons from
tau�/� mice, with few TIA1 granules (Figure 1A). Expressing
TIA1 plus tau dramatically increased the amount of somatoden-
dritic TIA1, with the TIA1 exhibiting a strong granular character
(Figure 1A); little or no TIA1 was observed in axons (Figure S1A).
Quantification shows that P301L tau significantly increased the
size of TIA1 SGs compared to WT tau but produced fewer SGs
than WT tau (Figures 1A–1C), which is strikingly similar to effects
produced in neurons by disease-linked mutations in RBPs, such
as TDP-43 (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2014).
The ability of tau to regulate TIA1 RNA granule formation sug-
gests a biological role for tau in RNA granule trafficking, which
was investigated using live-cell imaging. Tau�/� neurons
(3 days in vitro [DIV] 3) were transduced with AAV1-TIA1-mRFP
(a monomeric form of RFP) ± AAV9-WT or P301L tau, and, at
DIV 21, the neurons were imaged. Compiled traces showing par-
ticle localization and tracks of TIA1 granules show decreased
granule movement with tau expression (Figures 1D–1G). Tau in-
hibited net displacement and velocity of TIA1 granules, with

 retrograde (–) movement inhibited more than anterograde (+)
movement (Figure 1H). Granule size was inversely correlated
with granule velocity (Figures 1D–1G), with the trend particularly
pronounced with P301L tau where the granule area versus veloc-
ity graph shows a distinct inflection at about 1.2 mm2 (Figure 1G).
As with SG formation, this effect is strikingly similar to the rela-
tionship between size and granule movement among TDP-43
granules (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2014; Alami et al., 2014).
tau Increases SG Number and Size
Next, we investigated the effects of tau on SG formation using
mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. Stress induces TIA1 to exit
the nucleus, aggregate, and bind transcripts to form SGs (Fig-
ure 2A); TIA1 SG formation can be prevented by concurrent
treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors, such as cyclohex-
imide, that stabilize ribosomes on the mRNA. Expressing hu-
man tau (4R0N WT and P301L) increased SG formation in
the HT22 cells (Figure 2B). HT22 cells were transfected with
human tau (4R0N WT and P301L) and then examined ± arse-
nite (0.5 mM, 30 min) to induce SGs. Tau overexpression
strongly increased RNA granule formation under basal and
stressed conditions (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B). Double label-
ing of these granules demonstrated that they are bona-fide
SGs because they are positive for two SG markers: TIA1
and PABP; in addition, co-treatment with 10 mg/ml cyclo-
heximide prevented formation
of
the
tau/SG
complexes
(Figure 2B).
Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed to test whether
TIA1 associates with tau biochemically. HT22 cells were trans-
fected with WT tau (4R0N) and TIA1, and the human specific
Tau13 antibody was used to IP the complex, followed by immu-
noblotting for TIA1; IP with anti-TIA1 followed by immunoblotting

 with Tau13 was also performed, which produced compelling ev-
idence indicating robust associations (Figure 2C).
Next, we applied a live-cell imaging approach to examine the
effects of tau on stress granule dynamics. Expressing tau with
TIA1-RFP strongly increased the rate of SG formation (Figures
2D–2F). P301L tau accelerated the rate of SGs formation more
than WT tau, with increased consolidation into larger SGs (Fig-
ures 2D–2F). Thus, tau accelerates SG formation. Taken
together, these studies point to an important role of tau in regu-
lating trafficking and assembly of RNA granules, including SGs.
SGs are thought to reflect adaptation of protein synthesis to
stress; typically the stress-induced changes in protein synthesis
are associated with an overall reduction in protein synthesis.
Analysis of cells overexpressing tau (4R0N, P301L) showed a
decrease in total protein synthesis (measured by SUnSET assay)
in response to tau overexpression in a Tet-inducible HEK WT tau
(4R0N) cell line following addition of doxycycline, which is
consistent with the data above suggesting that tau promotes
SGs and the translational stress response (Figure 2G).
tau Regulates the Interaction of TIA1 with Its Proteome
Proteomic studies revealed a surprising role for tau in regulating
the proteins that interact with TIA1. To investigate whether tau
exerts control over TIA1 protein interactions, TIA1 was immuno-
precipitated from cortical brain tissue of 10-month-old WT
(C57BL/6J), tau�/�, and TIA1�/� mice. The specificity of the
TIA1 IP was verified by immunoblotting with anti-TIA1 antibody
(Figure 3A), and the resulting TIA1 proteome was examined by
mass spectrometry. 163 proteins were identified that were pre-
sent in TIA1 immunoprecipitates from WT or tau�/� brains and

evident in the C57BL/6 and tau�/� lysates but absent from the TIA1�/� lysates. Excluding from the proteomic analysis any proteins that were present in the TIA�/�
IP eliminates proteins immunoprecipitated non-specifically. Binding of RPL7 and EWSR1 to TIA1 was greatly reduced in the tau�/� cortices, as suggested by the
mass spectrometry studies. In contrast, binding of DDX5 to TIA1 was not affected by the absence of tau.

(n = 3 mice per group). Only edges containing more than three shared annotation clusters are shown. Background circles indicate protein clusters in the TIA1

 absent in the TIA1 immunoprecipitates from TIA1�/� brains (Fig-
ure 3C; Table S1). Protein associations identified by proteomics
were validated by repeat mass spectrometry on fresh samples,
as well as by immunoblot for tau and four proteins that gave
strong signals by mass spectrometry: RPL7, EWSR1, hnRNPR,
and DDX5 (Figures 3A and 3B). As expected, endogenous
mouse tau (MAPT) was abundantly detected in the TIA1 immu-
noprecipitates (Table S1). Figure 3C summarizes the average
protein level for each TIA1-binding protein detected in the WT
versus tau�/� mass spectrometry samples by a hierarchically
clustered heatmap.
Next, we analyzed the TIA1-binding proteome using the Data-
base for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) bioinformatics resource available via the NIH (Huang
et al., 2009). As expected, immunoprecipitating TIA1 from WT
mouse brain tissue identified proteins exhibiting statistically sig-
nificant enrichment (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) for anno-
tation terms involving RNA metabolism (Table S2), including
ribonucleoprotein (KEYWORDS, FDR = 6.30E-06), RNA-binding
(KEYWORDS, FDR = 2.09E-05), and RNA recognition motif
RNP-1 (INTERPRO, FDR = 2.15E-03); proteins involved in mito-
chondrial and vesicular/synaptic function also exhibited signifi-
cant enrichment (Table S2). We also constructed a network dia-
gram to understand the functional connectivity of TIA1-binding
proteins in the brain (Figure 3D). In the network, lines connecting
nodes indicate shared functional annotations with other pro-
teins in the TIA1 network; the size of each node corresponds
to the degree of replication in the WT samples (n = 3). Note
that some proteins listed in the hierarchical table (Figure 3C)
are absent from the network (Figure 3D) because they lack
known shared functional annotations with the other TIA1-bind-
ing proteins. The network of TIA1-binding proteins in WT mouse
cortex includes multiple proteins linked to RNA metabolism,
including ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL6, 7, 10A, 13 and 13A,
MRPL46, RPS3, and 4X), translational regulatory proteins
(EIF4A1, PABPC1, and NACA), small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(SNRNP70 and SNRPB), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-
proteins (HNRNPF, HNRNPR and HNRNPUL2, EWSR1, and
SYNCRIP), and helicases (DDX5 and DDX17) (Figure 3D). Impor-
tantly, deletion of tau eliminated the interaction of TIA1 with
many proteins in the network, particularly those associated
with RNA metabolism and RNA translation (Figure 3D, red cir-
cles). This network analysis of the TIA1-binding proteomes
from the WT and tau�/� mouse brain highlights the important
role that tau plays in regulating proteins that interact with
TIA1, with loss of tau abrogating interactions with multiple
core TIA1-binding proteins, including EWSR1, RPL6, RPL7,
MRPL46, RBM17, and SNRNP70 (Figures 3C–3F). To further
validate this finding, we separately analyzed the proteins
decreasing (Figure 3E) or increasing (Figure 3F) their association
with TIA1 by greater than 2-fold in tau�/� mice compared to WT
mice in order to understand how tau affects the protein interac-
tions of TIA1. Proteins decreasing their association with TIA1
were enriched for various functional annotation terms related
to RNA metabolism, including ribosomal, ribonucleoprotein,
and RNA-binding (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results sug-
gest that the presence of tau protein is required for normal inter-
action of TIA1 with the RNA metabolism machinery.
RNA-binding Proteins in the TIA1 Proteome Co-localize
with tau Pathology In Vivo
The strong role of tau in the TIA1-binding proteome raised the
possibility that TIA1-associated RBPs might co-localize with
tau pathology in human tauopathies and mouse models of
tauopathy. Brain tissue (frontal cortex) from 11-month-old
rTg4510 mice were labeled with antibodies for TIA1, EWSR1,
DDX5, RPL7, TDP-43, and FUS (Figure 4); all samples were
co-labeled with the anti-phospho-tau antibody, PHF1. Proteins
present in the TIA1 network (TIA1, EWSR1, DDX5, and RPL7)
all co-localized with PHF1-positive tau pathology. The RPL7
reactivity was notable because it tended to localize to the outer
rim of tau pathology (Figure 4). No co-localization with PHF1 pos-
itive tau pathology was observed for TDP-43 or FUS, which are
not part of the TIA1-binding network (Figure 4).
TIA1 and tau Interact Biochemically
Studies using primary neuronal cultures confirmed the interac-
tions between tau and TIA1. Hippocampal neurons from tau�/�
mice were grown in culture and transduced with AAV9-WT or
P301L tau ± AAV1-TIA1-mRFP (or mRFP) (Figure S4A). Immuno-
blotting demonstrated that TIA1 regulates tau levels. TIA1 over-
expression reduced levels of total tau, while TIA1 knockout
increased levels of total tau (Figures S4A and S4B). The mecha-
nism of regulation appeared to have limited dependence on the
proteasomal or autophagic systems, because neither MG132
nor chloroquine prevented tau reductions upon TIA1 expression
(Figure S4C). IP with TIA1 indicated that total tau (Tau13, recog-
nizes total human tau) or phospho-tau (PHF1, recognizing phos-
pho-tau S396/404) bound exogenous and endogenous TIA1
(Figure S4A). Pre-treating the lysate with RNase A, or use of a
TIA1 construct lacking the three RNA recognition motifs abol-
ished the association, indicating that tau associated with TIA1
through an RNA intermediate (Figure S4D, data for RNase A
treatment shown). The role of RNA intermediates supports the
hypothesis that tau participates in RNA granule biology. Tau
could also interact with RNA directly as suggested by prior
studies (Kampers et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2006).
TIA1 Modulates the Misfolding, Stability, and Insolubility
of Granular tau
The association of tau with TIA1 complexes raised the possibility
that TIA1 might also modulate tau misfolding. TIA1 forms
RNA granules, which provide an environment with abundant
aggregated proteins as well as RNA, a known promoter of tau
misfolding. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between
TIA1 levels and tau misfolding was examined. The response of
tau misfolding to knockdown of endogenous TIA1 was examined
first. TIA1 knockdown was validated by immunoblot (Figure 5A).
Next, primary hippocampal neurons (DIV 2) were transduced
with AAV1 WT human tau, then transduced with AAV9 shTIA1
or scrambled (shScr) on DIV 4 to knock down TIA1, and aged
to DIV 21. Analysis of MC1 reactivity at DIV 21 demonstrated
that TIA1 knockdown elicited a robust decrease in MC1 levels
(Figures 5B and 5C).
Overexpressing TIA1 exhibited a robust reciprocal response,
increasing levels of MC1 reactivity. Tau�/� hippocampal neurons
were transduced with WT or P301L tau AAV9 and TIA1-GFP or
Cell Reports 15, 1455–1466, May 17, 2016

 GFP lentivirus, and immunolabeled for MC1 tau and MAP2. Im-
aging demonstrated that neurons co-expressing tau and TIA1
displayed abundant MC1+ granules in processes that were not
apparent in neurons expressing tau alone, and that co-express-
ing TIA1 increased the size of the granules (Figures 5D–5F).
The ability of TIA1 to promote tau granules led us to hypothe-
size that TIA1 increased the stability of tau in granules. To test
this hypothesis, we generated a photo-convertible tau (PC-
Tau, WT 4R0N) construct that stably converts from cyan to
green, transfected cortical neurons (DIV 5) with the PC-Tau ±
TIA1, performed the photo-activation at DIV 21 and then imaged
for 6 hr. Neurons transfected with PC-Tau plus mCherry control
exhibited green tau fluorescence present both diffusely and in
granules. The tau fluorescence decreased steadily over 6 hr
down to a level of approximately 40% of the original fluores-
cence levels (Figures 5G and 5H). In contrast, cortical neurons
transfected with PC-Tau + TIA1 exhibited greatly reduced decay
rates, with PC-Tau fluorescence remaining above 80% at 6 hr
(Figures 5G and 5H). Expressing tau with TIA1 also caused a
higher proportion of the tau to localize to granules, consistent
with Figures 5D–5F. These data indicate that TIA1 stabilizes
tau in granules.
The stabilization of tau in granules combined with the presence
of misfolded, MC1+ tau in SGs raised the possibility that TIA1
increases formation of insoluble tau in granules. To test this
hypothesis, HT22 cells were transfected with WT tau or P301L
tau ± TIA1-RFP (Figure S5A). TIA1 was immunoprecipitated; the
TIA1 bound and unbound fractions were biochemically fraction-
ated into sarkosyl soluble and insoluble fractions. Overexpressing
TIA1 promoted the clearance of tau in all fractions except the
insoluble-TIA-bound (Figure S5A) where the amount of insoluble
tau (WT and P301L) associated with TIA1 was increased (Figures
S5A and S5B). Thus, our findings suggest that association with
TIA1 promotes formation of insoluble tau, which is thought to
be a key step in forming neurofibrillary tangles.
Translational Inhibitors and Kinase Inhibitors Modulate
SGs and tau Granules in Dendrites
The interaction between tau and TIA1 points to compelling ap-
proaches for modulating formation of tau granules in neurons.
SGs are regulated by translational inhibition. Cycloheximide pre-
vents elongation, which leaves ribosomes stalled on mRNA and
inhibits SG formation, while puromycin causes premature trans-
lational termination leading to release of the 60S ribosomal sub-
unit from the mRNA, promoting SG formation. Analysis of tau
granules in neuronal cell lines demonstrated that cycloheximide
prevented formation of tau granules (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B),
while puromycin stimulated formation of tau granules (data not
shown). We hypothesized that tau granules might be regulated
in a similar manner in neuronal dendrites.

 Primary cultures of tau�/� hippocampal neurons were trans-
duced with AAV9-WT tau or P301L tau ± AAV1-mRFP or TIA1-
mRFP (Figure 6). Neurons expressing WT or P301L tau and
mRFP control exhibited tau that was spread relatively diffusely
along processes, with only weak granules evident (Figure 6A).
However, co-transducing WT or P301L tau with TIA1 resulted
in processes with large granules positive for tau and TIA1, and
little to no diffuse tau (Figure 6A, arrows). Comparison of the
effects of the two different translational inhibitors, puromycin
and
cycloheximide,

 formation of tau and TIA1 are both modulated by translational
signaling.
The role of tau in SG biology in neurons also suggests that
kinases that regulate tau dynamics might also regulate tau-
mediated SG formation in neurons. For instance, proline-
directed kinases are known to phosphorylate tau, which leads
to dissociation of tau from microtubules and increases the pro-
pensity of tau to aggregate (Lee et al., 2011; Matenia and Man-
delkow, 2009). Chemical inhibitors of GSK3b, CDK5, p38,
MARK, and Fyn all significantly inhibited formation of granules
positive for TIA1 and phospho-tau (P-S396/404, PHF1) (Figures
6D and 6E). The strongest SG inhibition was observed with the
p38 inhibitor, which is known to act downstream of each of these
kinases (Roux and Blenis, 2004).
Use of phospho-mimetic tau constructs demonstrated a direct
role for tau phosphorylation in modulating SG formation. Trans-
fections were performed using phospho-mimetic (PMIM) or
phospho-null (PNULL) tau constructs in which 14 sites exhibiting
increased phosphorylation in AD were replaced with either
aspartate or alanine (Hoover et al., 2010). HT22 cells were trans-
fected with P301L, P301L PMIM, or P301L PNULL tau ± TIA1-
RFP. Cells were treated ± 25 mM salubrinal and SG were imaged
for endogenous TIA1 (Figures S6A and S6B) or transfected TIA1-
RFP (Figures S6B and S6C). Imaging showed more SGs in the
presence of phospho-mimetic tau, and fewer SGs in the pres-
ence of phospho-null tau (Figures S6A–S6C). Salubrinal treat-
ment increased the number of SGs in all conditions; salubrinal
inhibits the PP2A adaptor protein, GADD34, which increases
eIF2a phosphorylation and reduces mRNA translation (Boyce
et al., 2005). These data point to direct phosphorylation of tau
as a modulator of SG and tau granule formation in neurons.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a is regulated
by phosphorylation. We investigated whether inhibiting PKR or
PERK, two kinases that phosphorylate eIF2a, might also inhibit
tau mediated SG formation. SGs were induced by transfection
with TIA1 ± WT tau. After 24 hr, the cells were treated with
inhibitors of PKR (C16, 1 mM, Sigma) or PERK (GSK2606414,
50 nM, EMD/Millipore), and then SG number was quantified
after 24 hr. PKR or PERK antagonists strongly inhibited tau-
mediated SG formation (Figures 6F and 6G). Thus, inhibiting
translationally directed kinases also decreases tau-mediated
SG formation.
TIA1 Modulates the Pathophysiology of tau
The results above identify a functional interaction between TIA1
and tau, with tau promoting formation of TIA1+ SGs, and TIA
enhancing both tau catabolism and tau consolidation. Further
studies suggest that the functional interactions between TIA1
and tau also extend to neurodegeneration, where our results
show that TIA1 knockout inhibits tau-mediated degeneration,
while TIA1 overexpression increases tau-mediated degenera-
tion. Effects on degeneration were investigated by transducing
hippocampal neurons (DIV 3) from tau�/� mice with AAV9-WT
or P301L tau ± AAV1-TIA1-mRFP or mRFP and imaging for
MAP2 at DIV 21 (Figures 7A and 7B). Next, hippocampal neurons

dendritic length but had no effect independent of tau (Figure 7B).

 knockout prevented this toxicity (Figure 7C). Hippocampal
neurons (DIV 3) from TIA1�/� mice transduced with AAV9-
P301L tau exhibited neurite lengths similar to neurons trans-
duced with AAV9-WT tau (Figure 7C). These data indicate that
TIA1 expression is necessary for dendrite shortening associated
with expression of P301L tau (Figure 7B, right panel).
Additional studies suggest that the modulation of dendritic
length by TIA1 and tau is sensitive to translational signaling.
Tau�/� and TIA1�/� primary hippocampal neurons were trans-
duced with AAV9-WT tau or P301L tau ± AAV1-TIA1-mRFP or
mRFP, and at DIV 21 treated with translation inhibitors puromy-
cin (5 mg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 mg/ml). Translation inhibition
with cycloheximide did not affect dendrite length, while treat-
ment with puromycin, which induces SGs, potentiated the
decrease in dendritic length associated with TIA1/tau overex-
pression (Figures S7A and S7B).
Induction of toxicity was also apparent using biochemical as-
says. We examined levels of synaptic and apoptotic markers by
immunoblot in WT primary cortical neurons transduced with
AAV1-mRFP or TIA1-mRFP ± AAV9-WT tau or P301L tau.
Markers examined included synaptophysin, PSD-95, caspase-
3, and cleaved caspase-3. The data indicate a striking loss in
the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin in neurons co-trans-
duced with tau and TIA1, indicating a corresponding loss of
axonal terminals (Figure 7D). Levels of cleaved caspase-3 were
also elevated in TIA1 and tau co-transduced neurons indicating

enhanced toxicity (Figure 7E), which was
potentiated by concurrent treatment with
25 mM salubrinal (Figure 7E). Interestingly,
changes in the post-synaptic marker
PSD-95 levels were not prominent (Figure 7D). Analysis of
DNA fragmentation also showed that TIA1 increased apoptosis
in tau expressing neurons (Figure 7F). These data suggest
that the interaction of TIA1 with tau can promote neurode-
generation under conditions where SG formation is enhanced,
such as occurs with TIA1 overexpression or exposure to SG
inducers.
DISCUSSION
Tau is classically considered to function as a microtubule binding
protein that plays an important role in axonal trafficking; how-
ever, in tauopathies tau accumulates in the somatodendritic
compartment where it forms protein aggregates. The cellular
logic behind somatodendritic accumulation is poorly under-
stood. Our results suggest that the shift in tau localization to
the somatodendritic compartment occurs to facilitate formation
of SGs, which are RNA/protein complexes that are part of the
translational stress response. SGs normally accumulate in the
soma and dendrites as small insoluble macromolecular com-
plexes in response to stress. In neurodegenerative diseases
SGs become very large, and associate with pathological pro-
teins, such as tau (in AD) and TDP-43 (in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis) (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010; Vanderweyde et al.,
2012). In moderation, this stress response is likely beneficial,

 degenerative response, such as that caused by overexpressing
tau and either co-expressing with TIA1 or treating with
puromycin.
TIA1 is known to be a protein involved in nuclear splicing, but
recent studies also show that it is one of the core proteins that nu-
cleates cytoplasmic SGs (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008). The
network of proteins that associate with TIA1 in the brain includes
14 proteins that are very strongly linked from a functional
perspective. This group of proteins includes RBPs typically asso-
ciated with the spliceosome (SNRPB, snRNP70, DDX5, and
RBM17), RBPs associated with mRNA transport (HNRNPR and
EWSR1), and multiple ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL6, 7 10A, 13,
13A, RPS 3, 4X). The prominence of ribosomal proteins highlights
the important role of RNA translation in this network. Loss of tau
abrogates TIA1-binding to five out of 14 proteins in this core
network, RPL6, RPL7, EWSR1, SNRNP70, and RBM17, which
points to a role for tau in this translational and transport machinery
(Figure 3D). TIA1 shows reduced dendritic localization in tau�/�
neurons (Figures 1A and 1B), which suggests altered interactions
with trafficking proteins, but the mechanism for this altered local-
ization remains to be determined. The interaction between tau
and TIA1 parallels a recent study demonstrating that TIA1 inter-
acts with tubulin to regulate microtubules in yeast (Li et al.,
2014). In addition, the interaction of TIA1 with proteins, such as
SIRT2 and clathrin (CLTB), have not been reported previously
and might point to regulatory interactions unique to the brain.
The prominence of members of the U1 SNRNP family (SNRNP70,
SNRPB, and RBM17) in the TIA1 network is striking (Figures 3C
and 3D). Previous work identified strong accumulation of cyto-
plasmic SNRNP70 aggregates in the AD brain (Bai et al., 2013).
The presence of these TIA1-binding proteins whose binding is
tau dependent points to interactions that might be more promi-
nent in neurons or glia than in somatic cells.
The TIA1-binding proteome might differ between neurons and
most peripheral cells because neurons must manage RNA
biology in dendrites and synapses. RNA must be transported
to the synapse, where RNA translation is tightly linked to synap-
tic activity through activity-dependent translation. This means
that RBPs exert a much larger footprint on cellular activity
outside of the nucleus in neurons (and possibly glia) than in so-
matic cells. The prominence of ribosomal proteins in the brain
TIA1 network combined with the presence of RBPs important
for RNA transport, such as HNRNPR, SYNCRIP, and EWSR1,
emphasizes an important role for tau in regulating RNA transport
and translation during stress. Under basal conditions, tau is pre-
sent in dendrites only at low levels but localizes to the somato-
dendritic compartment during stress (Frandemiche et al., 2014;
Hoover et al., 2010; Zempel et al., 2013; Zempel and Mandel-
kow, 2014). Tau might function in this context to slow RNA
granule transport and regulate the interaction of TIA1 with other
SG proteins, which would facilitate SG formation and the trans-
lational stress response.
The immunohistochemical studies of the TIA1 proteome com-
ponents complement existing studies to highlight an important
role for the TIA1 proteome network in the pathophysiology of
AD and other tauopathies. Each of the four RBPs examined
that were part of the TIA1 protein interactome co-localized with
tau pathology. One of these proteins, RPL7, is a tau-dependent
TIA1-interacting protein that has also been observed to be
associated with tau in human pathological samples (Minjarez
et al., 2013). Another tau-dependent TIA1-interacting protein is
EWSR1, which is genetically linked to amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis (Couthouis et al., 2012). These intersecting pieces of evi-
dence suggest a model in which the accumulation of aggregated
RNA-binding proteins in tauopathies might result from shared
hyperactive SG pathways that also leads to the accumulation
of aggregated tau.
The intersection of SGs with tau biology becomes particularly
important when considering therapeutic implications. Protein
aggregation in neurodegenerative disease has been classically
considered to result from dysfunctional protein misfolding. How-
ever, SGs and other RNA granules exhibit protein aggregation
that occurs as part of a normal physiological pathway, exhibiting
inherent abilities to cycle between the liquid and solid states (Lin
et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Nott et al., 2015; Patel et al.,
2015; Vanderweyde et al., 2012). In the cell, TIA1 functions as
a core component of SGs, promoting their nucleation. The
studies above take advantage of the importance of TIA1 for
nucleation of SGs and of tau granules. We show that deletion
or knockdown of TIA1 in cultured neurons reduces the ability
of cells to form SGs, inhibits pathological tau misfolding, and
prevents tau-mediated degeneration. Thus, our work identifies
TIA1 knockdown as a potentially important approach to inhibit
tau misfolding and tau-mediated degeneration.
A large number of biochemical pathways also have the ability
to disperse SGs and RNA granules. Each of these pathways are
potential targets of drug discovery. We show that proline-
directed kinases, which are known to regulate the association
of tau with microtubules, also regulate the tau-mediated SG
pathway. Attention to the SG pathway highlights compelling ap-
proaches to regulation. For instance, drug discovery efforts built
around inhibiting SG formation have been successfully used to
identify novel agents that prevent aggregation of TDP-43, which
might be an effective treatment for ALS (Boyd et al., 2014; Kim
et al., 2014). Translational inhibitors provide an additional mech-
anism for regulation. The translational inhibitors, puromycin or
cycloheximide, reciprocally induce or prevent tau-mediated SG
formation and also modulate the degeneration associated with
overexpression of TIA1 with tau. Puromycin and cycloheximide
are admittedly toxic, but we show that kinases regulating eIF2a
phosphorylation, including PKR and PERK, regulate tau-medi-
ated SG formation. These kinases might be particularly effective
for tauopathies, such as AD, because they appear to inhibit dis-
ease processes at multiple levels, including preventing toxicity
associated with b-amyloid (Ohno, 2014). Thus, the role of tau
in RNA granule biology highlights the potential role of reversible
protein aggregation in the pathophysiology of tauopathies and
presents a corresponding wide range of avenues for pharmaco-
therapy of AD and other tauopathies.

Cell Reports 15, 1455–1466, May 17, 2016
 Cell Culture
HT22 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), incubated
24 hr, treated after 24 hr (25 mM salubrinal, 5 mg/ml puromycin, 10 mg/ml cyclo-
heximide), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 48 hr. Primary mouse P0
hippocampal cultures were grown for 21 days in Neurobasal medium supple-
mented with B-27 (Invitrogen).
AAV Transduction
At DIV 2, neurons were transduced with AAV9 vectors at MOI 20 (mRFP, TIA1
shTIA1-GFP, or shControl-GFP). At DIV 7, neurons were transduced with
AAV9-WT or P301L tau virus (MOI 20).
Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (Vander-
weyde et al., 2012). Primary antibodies used were Tau: CP-13, PHF1, MC1
(1:150 each), and Tau13 (1:5,000); SGs were TIA1 (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology); and neurons were MAP2 (1:1,000, Aves).
Image Analysis
SG density and dendritic processes were quantified using ImageJ (using Im-
ageJ plug-ins NeuronJ, tracing MAP2 positive processes for dendritic mea-
surements). Granule movement and formation was quantified using Bitplane
Imaris Track software (Imaris).
Photo-conversion
Photo-convertable WT human tau (PC-Tau) was generated by sub-cloning hu-
man 4N0R tau into the pPS-CFP2-C mammalian expression vector (Evrogen
catalog no. FP801). Primary cortical cultures (E16) were transfected at DIV 5
and aged to DIV 18–23 prior to photo-conversion using a diode 405-nm laser
on a Zeiss LSM-710 Duo Scan microscope.
Biochemical Fractionation
HT22 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1 3 Halt protease inhibitor cocktail
(Thermo Scientific), 13 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP, Roche),
sonicated, and centrifuged for 1 hr at 100,000 3 g at 4�C, and the supernatants
were collected in RIPA buffer. The pellets were sonicated and suspended in
urea buffer.
Sarkosyl Insoluble and Soluble tau Fractions
Supernatant (100 ml with 100 mg protein) in RIPA buffer plus 1% sarkosyl deter-
gent was rotated at room temperature for 1 hr and then centrifuged 1 hr
(100,000 3 g at room temperature). The supernatant and the sarkosyl pellet
were suspended in sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblots were performed using 15-well- 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitro-
gen) for electrophoresis, 1 hr blocking in 5% milk, 4�C overnight antibody
incubation (1:7,500 Tau13, 1:500 PHF1, 1:500 TIA1 (Santa Cruz), 1:500, synap-
tophysin (Santa Cruz), 1:1,000 PSD-95 (NeuroMab), 1:1,000 caspase-3 or
cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology), or 1:10,000 actin (Millipore)
in PBS. Secondary antibodies (Jackson) were incubated in 5% milk for 1 hr
at room temperature. Developing used SuperSignal West Pico Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
IP
Lysates (100–300 mg) were pre-cleared with rec-Protein G-Sepharose 4B Con-
jugate beads (Invitrogen) and then immunoprecipitated using ON 4�C with
0.5 ml PHF1 antibody, 1 ml Tau-5 antibody (Abcam), 1 mL MC1 antibody, or
0.5 mL of TIA1 antibody (Santa Cruz) or 1:200 HA antibody (Covance), followed
by addition of 50 ml protein G rec-Protein G-Sepharose 4B conjugate beads
and incubation for 1 hr at 4�C. The beads were spun down and washed, boiled
in SDS sample buffer. and blotted.
Measurement of protein synthesis followed the SUnSET protocol using a
30-min puromycin treatment (Schmidt et al., 2009).
Proteomics
Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed using the total ion current (TIC)
for proteins identified by LC-MS/MS normalized to the TIC level of TIA1 de-
tected in each sample. The 163 proteins identified as unique in the WT and
tau KO conditions were submitted to the DAVID Functional Clustering tool
(Huang et al., 2009). Twelve resulting clusters with enrichment FDR <0.05
were identified, and each of the 163 proteins was associated with the cluster(s)
based on its membership in the clustered gene sets. A network was induced
between proteins by counting the number of clusters shared between pairs
of proteins and visualized in the program Gephi 0.8.2.
Cell Death Studies
Caspase 3/7 cleavage was quantified with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit,
Promega. Apoptosis detected DNA fragmentation (TiterTACS Colorimetric
Apoptosis Detection kit, Trevigen).
