Abstract
Background: We prospectively examined the relationship between dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), carbohydrate, sugars, 
and fiber intake (including fruits, vegetable of breads/cereals fiber) with successful aging (determined through a multidomain approach). 
Methods: A total of 1,609 adults aged 49 years and older who were free of cancer, coronary artery disease, and stroke at baseline were 
followed for 10 years. Dietary data were collected using a semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire. Successful aging status was 
determined through interviewer-administered questionnaire at each visit and was defined as the absence of disability, depressive symptoms, 
cognitive impairment, respiratory symptoms, and chronic diseases (eg, cancer and coronary artery disease).
Results: In all, 249 (15.5%) participants had aged successfully 10 years later. Dietary GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake were not significantly 
associated with successful aging. However, participants in the highest versus lowest (reference group) quartile of total fiber intake had greater 
odds of aging successfully than suboptimal aging, multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–2.84). 
Those who remained consistently below the median in consumption of fiber from breads/cereal and fruit compared with the rest of cohort 
were less likely to age successfully, OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.34–0.84) and OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.44–0.95), respectively.
Conclusions: Consumption of dietary fiber from breads/cereals and fruits independently influenced the likelihood of aging successfully over 
10 years. These findings suggest that increasing intake of fiber-rich foods could be a successful strategy in reaching old age disease free and 
fully functional.
Key Words: Blue Mountains Eye Study—Carbohydrate—Fiber—Glycemic index—Successful aging
The effect of carbohydrate nutrition on health outcomes and disease 
has increasingly been the recent focus of research. Some carbohy-
drate-rich foods have less effect than others to increase blood glucose 
(1). This property of individual foods is called the “glycemic index 
(GI),” a measure of carbohydrate quality (1–3). Dietary glycemic 
load (GL) is the product of a food’s GI and total available carbohy-
drate content and represents both the quantity and quality of carbo-
hydrates, that is, the total glycemic impact of a portion of the food 
(4,5). Both dietary GI and GL have been proposed to contribute to 
the development of obesity (6), diabetes, and cardiovascular disease 
(7). Further, specific aspects of carbohydrate quality, such as intakes 
of sugary foods and dietary fiber, are thought to influence health 
outcomes including obesity and its comorbidities (8,9). Moreover, 
foods that are high in fiber, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and leg-
umes contain more than just fiber. These co-passengers with fiber 
may provide the protective health properties of fiber, rather than the 
fiber itself (10). Also, additional properties of fiber, such as viscosity 
and fermentability, may be more important characteristics in terms 
of physiological benefits (11).
Rowe and Kahn first described successful aging as absence of 
disease, good social engagement, lack of physical disability, and good 
mental health (12). Resolving the effects of dietary macronutrients

 on aging and health remains a fundamental challenge, with pro-
found implications for human health (13). Sabia et al. (14) showed 
that daily consumption of fruits and vegetables by UK adults was 
associated with a 35% increased odds of aging successfully over 
16.3 years. More recently, a Australian cohort study showed that a 
fruit-based eating pattern was positively associated with a successful 
aging outcome (ie, lack of chronic disease, little limitation in physi-
cal function, and good mental health) for12 years (15). We recently 
showed that greater compliance with recommended national dietary 
guidelines (higher diet quality) was associated with an increased 
likelihood of successful aging, as determined through a multidomain 
approach (16). However, no population-based cohort study has 
investigated the temporal association between a range of carbohy-
drate nutrition variables (total dietary carbohydrate, GI, GL, fiber, 
and total sugars) and aging status. Associations of inflammation 
with age-related pathologies are well documented (17), and given 
that the effects of carbohydrate nutrition variables such as GI/GL 
and fiber on inflammatory markers are also established (18), it is 
plausible that carbohydrate nutrition is of particular relevance to 
the aging process.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the independent 
relationship between various aspects of carbohydrate nutrition (total 
dietary carbohydrate, GI, GL, fiber from different food sources, and 
sugars) and a comprehensive definition of successful aging that 
included being free of disability and chronic disease (coronary artery 
disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer); having good mental health and 
functional independence; and having good physical, respiratory, and 
cognitive function for a follow-up period of 10 years. For compari-
son, we also examined the association between the aforementioned 
carbohydrate nutrition variables and 10-year mortality risk in this 
cohort of older adults.
Methods
Study Population
The Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) is a population-based 
cohort study of common eye diseases and other health outcomes 
in a suburban Australian population located west of Sydney. Study 
methods and procedures have been described elsewhere (19). 
Baseline examinations of 3,654 residents aged 49 years and older 
were conducted during 1992–1994 (BMES-1, 82.4% participation 
rate). Surviving baseline participants were invited to attend exami-
nations after 5 years (1997–1999, BMES-2), 10 years (2002–2004, 
BMES-3), and 15 years (2007–2009, BMES-4) at which 2,334 
(75.1% of survivors), 1,952 participants (75.6% of survivors), and 
1,149 (55.4% of survivors) were reexamined, respectively, with 
complete data. The University of Sydney and the Western Sydney 
Area Human Ethics Committees approved the study, and written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants at each exami-
nation. All study methods were performed in accordance with the 
approved guidelines.
Nutritional Assessment
Dietary data were collected using a 145-item self-administered 
semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (20). At all 
BMES examinations, participants used a nine-category frequency 
scale to indicate the usual frequency of consuming individual food 
items during the past year. For the current study, FFQ data collected 
at BMES-1 were used in the analyses. This FFQ included ques-
tions about the types of breakfast cereals consumed that were used 
to increase the accuracy of the GI calculations. The FFQ showed 
reasonable agreement for carbohydrates and GI, yielding correlation 
coefficients of 0.55 and 0.57, respectively, and correctly classifying 
nearly 80% of participants within one quintile for carbohydrate 
intake and 74% participants within one quintile for GI, in a subset 
of participants who had completed 12 days of weighed food records 
over three seasons (21,22). The methodology used to determine 
intakes of specific carbohydrate nutrition variables are presented in 
Supplementary Material.
Assessment of Study Outcomes (Aging Status and 
Mortality)
We assessed chronic diseases throughout the 10-year follow-up 
(ie, from BMES-1 to BMES-3). Medical history was determined by 
interviewer-administered questionnaire at each visit. The suboptimal 
aging group in the context of this study included all participants 
who were alive 10 years later, but who were not classified as aging 
successfully (see definition subsequently) (14). Among surviving par-
ticipants aged 60 years and older, we used a definition similar to that 
used by Sabia et al. (14), which defined successful aging as satisfying 
each of the following criteria: no history of cancer, coronary artery 
disease, stroke, angina, acute myocardial infarction, or diabetes; 
good cognitive, physical, respiratory, and cardiovascular function-
ing; and the absence of disability; good mental health, and functional 
independence (see Supplementary Material) (16).
To identify and confirm persons who died after BMES-1, demo-
graphic information including surname, first and second names, 
gender, and date of birth of the participants were cross-matched 
with Australian National Death Index (NDI) data, as previously 
described (23). Validity of NDI data has been reported to have high 
sensitivity and specificity for cardiovascular mortality (92.5% and 
89.6%, respectively) (24). The census cutoff point for deaths was 
end of December 2004 (ie, a 10-year period from BMES-1 or the 
baseline examination).
Statistical Analysis
SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for statistical 
analyses. Study factors were carbohydrate nutrition (total carbo-
hydrates, GI, GL, total sugars, and fiber) and three categories of 
study outcome were defined: successful aging (key study outcome), 
death during follow-up, and suboptimal aging. Baseline character-
istics of study participants who were followed over 10 years were 
compared using χ2 tests and general linear model. Multivariable 
polytomous logistic regression analyses for the outcome of aging 
status (successful aging, suboptimal aging, and having died) used 
the generalized logit link and adjusted for age, sex, marital status, 
living status, smoking, and weight status. Further adjustment for 
energy-adjusted total fiber intake was performed when total carbo-
hydrates, GI, GL, and total sugars were analyzed as the study fac-
tors. Participants also reported who they lived with (alone or with, 
eg, partner, child, or friend) and current marital status (married, 
widowed, divorced, or never married). Body mass index was calcu-
lated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). Participants also 
self-reported history of smoking as never, past, or current smoking. 
Current smokers included those who had stopped smoking within 
the past year. Carbohydrate nutrition variables were analyzed as 
a continuous variable (per 1 unit) and categorical variable (quar-
tiles). Associations between baseline dietary intake and sustained 
low intake (below the median dietary intake over 10 years) and the 
three categories of outcomes (suboptimal aging, successful aging, 
and death) were both explored.

Results
Of the 3,654 participants aged 49 years and older examined at the 
baseline examination (BMES-1), 1,116 were excluded as they had 
cancer, coronary artery disease, and/ or stroke at the baseline exami-
nation. A further 929 were excluded as they did not have dietary 
data and/or had insufficient information to characterize their aging 
status 10 years later, leaving 1,609 participants for longitudinal 
analyses. Of these 1,609 participants, 610 (37.9%) had died, 750 
(46.6%) were suboptimal agers, and 249 (15.5%) were successful 
agers 10 years later. Supplementary analysis was conducted where 
we compared dietary intakes between those who were followed up 
(n = 1,327) versus those who were excluded because they were not 
followed up 10 years later but who also had not passed away during 
this follow-up period (n = 361); regardless of their aging status. We 
found that those who were excluded because they did not return for 
the 10-year examination (BMES-3) versus those who came back had 
higher dietary GI intakes (56.9 vs 56.1, p = 0.01) but lower total 
fiber intake (26.3 vs 28.0 
g/day, p = 0.002), fruit fiber (6.3 vs 7.2 
g/
day, p = 0.003) and breads/ cereal fiber intakes (6.7 vs 7.7 
g/day, 
p = 0.002). We found no significant differences with the other dietary 
variables (data not shown). Supplementary Figure 1 shows that with 
increasing age at baseline there is an increase in mortality rate, how-
ever, the proportion of participants who aged successfully or were 
suboptimal agers decreased with increasing age. At baseline, those 
who aged successfully compared with those who were classified as 
suboptimal agers or had died were more likely to be younger, less 
likely to smoke, and have lower dietary GI intake but higher intakes 
of total fiber and breads/cereal fiber (Table 1). Those who died versus 
those who were suboptimal and successful agers were more likely to 
be men and have higher dietary GL intake (Table 1).
Table 2 shows that participants who were in the highest quar-
tile compared with the lowest quartile of dietary GI intake at base-
line had 65% increased risk of dying rather than suboptimal aging 
10 years later, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.65 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.10–2.47). Compared with those in the first quartile, 
participants in the third and fourth quartile of total fiber intake 
were more likely to age successfully rather than suboptimal aging, 
OR 2.06 (95% CI 1.31–3.23) and OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.13–2.84), 
respectively (Table 3). Participants in the third versus first tertile of 
baseline breads/cereal fiber consumption had 78% increased odds 
of successfully aging 10 years later. An inverse association between 
consumption of breads/cereal fiber and mortality risk was also 
observed (Table 3). Participants in the third and fourth quartile of 
fruit fiber intake versus those in the first quartile had 64% and 81% 
increased likelihood of aging successfully than suboptimal aging, 
respectively.
We examined the linear associations between baseline intakes of 
carbohydrate nutrition variables and aging status over the 10 years. 
After multivariable adjustment, each 1-unit increase in dietary GI 
intake at baseline was associated with 4% increase in risk of death 
rather than suboptimal aging 10 years later, OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.01–
1.07). Also, each 1-unit increase in energy-adjusted total fiber intake 
was associated with a 2% increased likelihood of aging successfully 
versus suboptimal aging, multivariable-adjusted OR 1.02 (95% CI 
1.00–1.04). Each 1-unit increase in baseline bread/cereal fiber intake 
at baseline was associated with increased odds of successful aging 
compared with suboptimal aging, multivariable-adjusted OR 1.03 
(95% CI 1.00–1.06).
We also assessed the aging status of participants who remained 
consistently below the median intake of the various carbohydrate 
nutrition variables compared with all other participants, that is, 
those who remained consistently above the median or fluctuated 
between above/below the median during the 10 years. For these 
analyses, we had 810 participants who had complete dietary data at 
all three time points (BMES-1, -2, and -3) as well as sufficient infor-
mation to characterize their aging status 10 years later (Table 4). 
Participants who remained consistently below the median in con-
sumption of fiber from breads/cereal and fruit compared with the

Discussion
We provide novel epidemiological evidence of an independent 
association between dietary fiber intake and successful aging (as 
determined through a multidomain approach), during 10-year 
follow-up. Higher baseline consumption of energy-adjusted total 
fiber, breads/cereal fiber, and fruit fiber were all associated with 
a greater likelihood of aging successfully than suboptimal aging. 
In contrast, a reduced likelihood of aging successfully rather than 
suboptimal aging was observed among participants whose con-
sumption of dietary breads/cereal fiber and fruit fiber remained 
consistently below the median during the 10 years. Baseline 
dietary GI intake was positively associated with risk of death, 
whereas breads/cereal fiber consumption was inversely associated 
with 10-year mortality risk. However, dietary GI, GL, and total 
carbohydrate and sugar intake were not associated with aging 
successfully.

 Among older adults, fiber from fruits and breads/ cereals (pri-
marily from rolled oats and wholemeal/wholegrain breads), but 
not from vegetables independently predicted successful aging. 
This suggests that the influence of dietary fiber on health and 
aging could vary depending on the food sources which are con-
sistent with prior studies that have shown varying effects of fiber 
from different sources on cardiovascular outcomes and kidney 
disease (25,26). Several mechanistic pathways could explain the 
association between dietary fiber intake and aging status. First, 
aging is associated with the development of a systemic state of 
low-grade chronic inflammation and with progressive deterio-
ration of metabolic function (27). Hence, the protective effect 
of dietary fiber could be partly attributed to the avoidance of 
postprandial hyperglycemic peaks (28), because recurrent post-
prandial hyperglycemia results in overproduction of reactive free 
radical molecules and greater release of inflammatory cytokines 
(28–30). Moreover, it was proposed that short-chain fatty acids 
produced by fermentation of dietary fiber by intestinal microbi-
ota interact with the anti-inflammatory chemoattractant receptor 
GPR43, that is, dietary fiber may be molecularly linked to positive 
influences on inflammatory responses (18,31). Also, observational 
studies addressing dietary fiber or whole grain intake almost con-
sistently suggest a benefit of a higher consumption on low-grade 
inflammation (18).
In the BMES, older adults who consistently consumed a diet that 
was high in dietary GI and GL had a greater risk of dying over the 
10 years. The positive association between dietary GI/GL intake and 
reduced life expectancy is consistent with the growing evidence that 
increasing the consumption of high GI and GL foods could contrib-
ute to increased oxidative stress and both acute and chronic low-
grade inflammation (18,28,29). However, dietary GI/GL was not a 
significant predictor of successful aging. This is surprising, given that 
dietary GI/GL are associated with inflammatory markers (18,28,29), 
and associations of inflammation with age-related pathologies are 
established (17). It is unclear as to why dietary GI/GL was associated 
with mortality risk but not with successful aging, it could be that 
there was inadequate statistical power to detect a link with mortal-
ity, as over a third had died over the 10 years as opposed to only 
around 15% who had aged successfully, which could have led to 
the inability to detect any modest associations with GI/GL. We also 
caution that our findings could be due to chance and would require 
confirmation by other larger cohort studies.
Strengths of our study include its prospective study design, 
representative population-based sample with relatively high 
participation minimizing selection bias, use of a validated food 
questionnaire to collect information on dietary intakes and a com-
prehensive definition of successful aging. A study limitation is that 
some of the aging outcomes were self-report and not objectively 
measured (eg, respiratory function), hence, it could be subject to 
potential measurement errors. Similarly, there is potential for mis-
classification because information on dietary intake was collected 
by self-report. Although random within-person variation could 
attenuate any true association, the FFQ was designed to minimize 
this error by assessing average long-term dietary intake during the 
successive follow-up period (32). These repeated measurements 
take into account possible changes in diet with time and reduce 
random variation in reporting. Although the total effects of carbo-
hydrate intake may not be fully depicted by the questionnaire, any 
measurement errors should be unrelated to the end points due to 
the prospective study design (25,32). Finally, because there were 
differences in, for example, dietary intakes of fiber and GI at base-
line between those who were examined at 10 years versus those 
who had not died, but had also not come back for the 10-year 
follow-up, there is the possibility of selection bias influencing 
observed associations in this study.
In summary, our study findings underscore the importance of 
diet for aging and age-related diseases. Specifically, we show that 
older adults whose diets are consistently high in fiber consumption 
(particularly from breads/cereals and fruits) have a greater likeli-
hood of aging successfully in the longer term. Conversely, our find-
ings indicate that other aspects of carbohydrate nutrition including 
total carbohydrate intake and dietary GI/GL are not independent 
predictors of successful aging. These epidemiological data suggest 
that lifestyle interventions increasing the intake of fiber-rich foods 
could be a successful strategy in reaching old age disease free and 
fully functional.
