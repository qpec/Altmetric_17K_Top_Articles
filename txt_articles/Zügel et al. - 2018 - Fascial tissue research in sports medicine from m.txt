The fascial system builds a three-dimensional continuum 
of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense fibrous 
connective tissue that permeates the body and enables 
all body systems to operate in an integrated manner. 
Injuries to the fascial system cause a significant loss of 
performance in recreational exercise as well as high-
performance sports, and could have a potential role in 
the development and perpetuation of musculoskeletal 
disorders, including lower back pain. Fascial tissues 
deserve more detailed attention in the field of sports 
medicine. A better understanding of their adaptation 
dynamics to mechanical loading as well as to 
biochemical conditions promises valuable improvements 
in terms of injury prevention, athletic performance and 
sports-related rehabilitation. This consensus statement 
reflects the state of knowledge regarding the role of 
fascial tissues in the discipline of sports medicine. It 
aims to (1) provide an overview of the contemporary 
state of knowledge regarding the fascial system from 
the microlevel (molecular and cellular responses) to 
the macrolevel (mechanical properties), (2) summarise 
the responses of the fascial system to altered loading 
(physical exercise), to injury and other physiological 
challenges including ageing, (3) outline the methods 
available to study the fascial system, and (4) highlight 
the contemporary view of interventions that target 
fascial tissue in sport and exercise medicine. Advancing 
this field will require a coordinated effort of researchers 
and clinicians combining mechanobiology, exercise 
physiology and improved assessment technologies.
Terminology And definiTions
The term fascia was originally used to describe a 
sheet or band of soft connective tissue that attaches, 
surrounds and separates internal organs and skel-
etal muscles. Advancing research on the physiolog-
ical and pathophysiological behaviours of a range 
of connective tissues has revealed that this defini-
tion is too restrictive. Understanding of mechan-
ical aspects of connective tissue function depends 
on consideration of a host of interconnected and 
interwoven connective tissues beyond these sheets 
or bands, and there is enormous potential gain from 
understanding the convergence of biology under-
pinning adaptation, function and pathology. 
The 
fascial 
system 
includes 
adipose 
tissue, 
adventitia, neurovascular sheaths, aponeuroses, 
deep and superficial fasciae, dermis, epineurium, 
joint capsules, ligaments, membranes, meninges, 
myofascial 
expansions, 
periostea, 
retinacula, 
septa, tendons (including endotendon/peritendon/
epitendon/paratendon), visceral fasciae, and all the 
intramuscular and intermuscular connective tissues, 
including endomysium/perimysium/epimysium.1
With its diverse components, the fascial system 
builds a three-dimensional continuum of soft, colla-
gen-containing, loose and dense fibrous connec-
tive tissue that permeates the body and enables all 
body systems to operate in an integrated manner 
(figure 1).1 In contrast, the morphological/histolog-
ical definition describes fascia as ‘a sheet, or any 
other dissectible aggregations of connective tissue 
that forms beneath the skin to attach, enclose, and 
separate muscles and other internal organs’.1 The 
proposed terminology distinguishing the terms 
‘fascia’ and ‘fascial system’ allows for the precise 
identification of individual structures as well as 
grouping them for functional purposes.
Consensus meeTing
The Second International CONNECT Conference 
was held at the University of Ulm, Germany, on 
16–19 March 2017, as part of a conference series 
aimed at fostering scientific progress towards a 
better understanding and treatment of fascial tissues 
in sports medicine. After the conference, a meeting 
was held with conference speakers and other 
field-related experts to discuss and find consensus 
regarding the role of fascial tissue in the field of 
sports medicine.
Injuries to a variety of fascial tissues cause a 
significant loss of performance in sports2 and have a 
potential role in the development and perpetuation 
of musculoskeletal disorders, including lower back 
pain.3 A major goal of clinicians is to return athletes 
and patients to activity, training and competition 
after injury.
This consensus statement reflects the current 
state of knowledge regarding the role of fascial 
tissues in the discipline of sports medicine and will 
be updated as part of a consensus meeting during 
the CONNECT conference. This paper aims to 
summarise the contemporary state of knowledge 
regarding the fascial system from the microlevel 
(molecular and cellular responses) to the macrolevel 
(mechanical properties), and the responses of the

molecular adaptation of fascial tissues: effects of physical 
exercise, ageing, sex hormones and inflammation
Molecular crosstalk between extracellular matrix (ECM) mole-
cules and cellular components is an important determinant of 
fascial tissue physiology and pathophysiology. A molecular chain, 
characterised by high functional and structural plasticity and 
bidirectional molecular interactions, connects the cellular cyto-
skeleton to the ECM (figure 2). Small functional and structural 
alterations in the ECM result in complex cellular adaptation 
processes and, vice versa, changes in cell function and structure 
leading to ECM adaptation.4 Therefore, fascial tissue homeo-
stasis is the result of a complex interplay and dynamic crosstalk 
between cellular components and the ECM. Especially under 
dynamic conditions such as growth and regeneration, strong 
alterations of the local ECM microenvironments are necessary 
to allow cellular adaptation and rebuilding of fascial tissues. All 
factors influencing cell or ECM behaviour can result in changes 
in the structure and homeostasis of tissues and organs.
The ECM also works as a molecular store, catching and 
releasing biologically active molecules to regulate tissue and 
organ function, growth and regeneration. Molecules stored in 
the ECM network can be cleaved to release biologically active 
cleavage products.5 Mechanical stress can induce the release and 
activation of ECM-stored molecules, inducing the cleavage prod-
ucts of collagen XVIII and other basement membrane compo-
nents. It has been shown that endostatin (the 20 
kDa C-terminal 
fragment of collagen XVIII) can modulate vascular growth and 
function.6–8 In addition, changes in the ECM by ageing or phys-
ical exercise may be involved in triggering systemic effects via 
excreted circulatory molecules, such as the exercise-responsive 
myokine irisin,9 which has been proposed to increase energy 
expenditure in mice and humans.

Consensus statement
In fascial tissues such as tendons, acute and chronic loading 
stimulates collagen remodelling.10 As the exercise-induced 
increase in collagen synthesis is lower in women than in men, and 
as injury frequency and the expression of oestrogen receptors in 
human fascial tissue are sex-dependent, oestrogens may play an 
important regulatory role in ECM remodelling.11–13 The effects 
of oestrogens on collagen synthesis appear to differ between 
rest and response to exercise. While oestrogen replacement 
in elderly, postmenopausal women impairs collagen synthesis 
in response to exercise, oestrogen has a stimulating effect on 
collagen synthesis at rest.14 Oral contraceptives, on the other 
hand, have an overall depressing effect on collagen synthesis.15
Physiological ageing is a highly individual process character-
ised by a progressive degeneration of tissues and organ systems. 
Age-related alterations in fascial tissues include densification 
(alterations of loose connective tissue) and fibrosis (alterations 
of collagen fibrous bundles).16 Functionally, these pathological 
changes can modify the mechanical properties of fascial tissues 
and skeletal muscle, thereby contributing to pain-related and 
age-related reductions in muscle force or range of motion, which 
cannot be solely explained by the loss of muscle mass.17 ECM 
structural, biochemical, cellular and functional changes occur 
during ageing.18 Interestingly, ageing is characterised by chronic, 
low-grade inflammation—the so-called inflammaging.19 As the 
ECM is the main site of inflammatory responses taking place in 
tissues, it is not surprising that the ECM can interact with immune 
cells to change their function, which is important for growth 
and regeneration of tissues. Leucocyte extravasation depends 
on cleavage of the basal membrane by locally released prote-
ases. Tenascin and osteopontin are examples of ECM molecules 
important for the regulation of the local immune response.20 21 
In addition, ECM plays an important role as a barrier to trans-
migration of immune cells in and out of the tissue. Although 
early inflammation after tissue damage due to physical exercise 
or injury is crucial for tissue remodelling and adaptation,22 23 
stem cell activity and collagen synthesis may be inhibited by the 
chronic intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prior to 
exercise.24 25 However, limiting the magnitude of inflammation 
might be beneficial for tissue regeneration and gains in muscle 
mass and strength, depending on the nature of the injury,26 and 
in elderly people.27
Outlook 
and 
perspectives 
for 
future 
research: 
 insights into the structure–function relationship of the ECM, 
especially in ageing and injured fascial tissues and skeletal muscle, 
are highly relevant for maintaining musculoskeletal function in the 
elderly during daily life and exercise and for prevention of exercise-
related overuse injuries in athletes. While a body of literature exists 
on metabolic activity and ECM remodelling in human tendons 
in response to exercise, much less is known and more research is 
needed to investigate the molecular response of other fascial tissues 
(such as intramuscular fascial tissue) to altered loading and ageing.
myofascial force transmission
Conventionally, skeletal muscles have been considered as 
primarily transmitting force to their osseous insertions through 
the myotendinous junction.28 However, in situ experiments 
in animals and imaging studies in humans have shown that 
intermuscular and extramuscular fascial tissues also provide a 
pathway for force transmission.29–33 Although the magnitude of 
non-myotendinous force transmission under in vivo conditions 
is disputed,34 35 the contribution of these pathways is thought to 
be dependent, in part, on the mechanical properties of myofas-
cial tissue linkages.36 Myofascial tissue that is stiffer or more 
compliant than normal has been shown to influence the magni-
tude of intermuscular force transmission and, arguably, may have 
a significant effect on muscle mechanics.37–39 The mechanical 
properties of fascial tissues can be modified by several factors, 
which, inter alia, include a change in fluid content, crosslinks 
and molecular organisation and content of specific ECM mole-
cules, and the contractile activity of myofibroblast cells.40 41 
Changes can also be a consequence of muscle injury,42 disease,43 
surgical treatment37 or ageing (figure 3).44
As fascial tissues connect skeletal muscles, creating a multidi-
rectional network of myofascial continuity,45 altered local forces 
(eg, by muscular contraction) might also affect the mechanics 
of adjacent tissues. In fact, a plethora of cadaveric and animal 
studies have demonstrated substantial mutual interactions 
between neighbouring muscles arranged serially in slings (eg, 
latissimus muscle and gluteus maximus muscle)46 and parallel to 
each other (eg, lower limb synergists).47 For example, when seen 
from a fascial perspective, the knee-joint capsule is influenced 
by directly inserting tendons and by more distant structures 
such as the gluteus maximus or the tensor fasciae latae and their 
connecting fasciae.48 However, it remains to be further eluci-
dated how such findings translate into human in vivo conditions.
Although scarce, initial in vivo evidence points towards a 
significant role of myofascial force transmission for the loco-
motor system. Available data point towards the existence of (1) 
remote exercise effects and (2) non-local symptom manifesta-
tions in musculoskeletal disorders, both of which might be of 
relevance in athletic and therapeutic settings. It has been shown 
that stretching of the lower limb increases the range of motion of 
the cervical spine, and patients with sacroiliac pain display hyper-
activity of the gluteus maximus and the contralateral latissimus

muscle.49–51 Because the involved body regions are connected via 
myofascial chains, myofascial force transmission might be the 
cause of the observations. Besides interactions between muscles 
arranged in series, significant amounts of force have been shown 
to be transmitted in vivo between muscles located parallel to 
each other; electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle 
leads to a simultaneous displacement of the soleus muscle.30 This 
intralimb myofascial force transmission may be of relevance in 
diseases such as cerebral palsy.38
Outlook 
and 
perspectives 
for 
future 
research: 
 
Although the basic mechanisms of myofascial force transmission 
have been studied, there is a need to discern the influence of 
variables, such as age, sex, temperature and level of physical 
activity, within healthy physiological and pathological settings. 
Furthermore, despite convincing in vitro evidence for the existence 
of myofascial force transmission, its relative contribution to the 
occurrence of remote exercise effects under in vivo conditions has 
to be further elucidated. Besides mechanical interactions between 
adjacent tissues, non-local changes of stiffness or flexibility may 
also (at least partly) stem from neural adaptations, for example, a 
systemic reduction of stretch tolerance.
injury of fascial tissues: cellular and mechanical responses to 
damage
Excessive or prolonged loading or direct trauma to fascial tissues 
initiates micro and macro changes necessary for tissue repair. 
These effects may also contribute to pathological changes that 
modify tissue function and mechanics, leading to compromised 
function of the healthy tissue. Effects may become systemic, and 
thus not limited to the injured/loaded tissues.
Following an acute injury from overload or anoxia in fascial 
tissues, the immune response aims to phagocytose injured cells. An 
acute inflammatory response is typically short-lived and reversible 
and involves the release of a range of molecules, including proin-
flammatory cytokines from injured cells and macrophages, along 
with other substances (eg, bradykinin, substance P and prote-
ases) that sensitise nociceptive afferents52 and promote immune 
cell infiltration. If loading is prolonged or repetitive, persistent 
inflammation may develop,53 54 leading to the prolonged presence 
of macrophages and cytotoxic levels of cytokines in and around 
tissues, ultimately resulting in ongoing tissue damage. Some tissue 
cytokines (eg, interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 
transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ-1)) are fibrogenic cyto-
kines that can promote fibrosis via excessive fibroblast proliferation 
and collagen matrix deposition.55
Overproduction of cytokines also maintains sensitisation of noci-
ceptive afferents—a change that would increase production and 
release of substance P (a known nociceptor neuropeptide). Recent 
studies show that substance P can stimulate TGFβ-1 production 
by tendon fibroblasts, and that both substance P and TGFβ-1 can 
induce fibrogenic processes independently of each other.56
T
aken together, these findings suggest that both neurogenic 
processes (nerves are the primary source of substance P) and loading/
repair processes (TGFβ-1 is produced by fibroblasts in response to 
mechanical loading and during repair) can contribute to increased 
collagen in fascial tissues. Fibrosis (eg, collagen deposition) around 
the tendon, nerve and myofascial tissues influences dynamic biome-
chanical properties secondary to tissue adherence and can tether 
structures to each other or induce chronic compression.57 Increased 
collagenous tissues surrounding the nerves can tether the nerves 
and also enhance pain behaviours.58 Furthermore, inflammatory 
cytokines can ‘spill over’ into the bloodstream, leading to wide-
spread secondary tissue damage and central nociceptor wind-
up.53 59 Circulating TNF is elevated in chronic lower back pain,60 
and recent data highlight a relationship between elevated TNF and 
greater risk for progression to chronic pain in some individuals61 
and in animal models of overuse.59
Muscles also undergo changes in muscle fibre composition, 
adiposity and fibrosis in response to injury to related struc-
tures (eg, injury to an intervertebral disc) even in the absence of 
muscle trauma (figure 4). These changes closely resemble those 
identified for direct muscle trauma, such as supraspinatus tendon 
lesion,62 although with some differences (eg, differences in the 
distribution of infiltrating fat). After an injury to an intervertebral

disc, deep back muscles undergo rapid atrophy,63 64 most likely 
mediated by neural changes such as reflex inhibition.65 This is 
followed by changes in muscle fibre composition (slow-to-fast 
muscle fibre transition), fibrosis and fatty infiltration associated 
with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, 
TNF).66 Increased cytokine expression was first identified from 
an mRNA analysis of the muscle, but with an unclear origin. 
Recent work suggests this is mediated by an increased propor-
tion of proinflammatory macrophages,67 hypothesised to result 
from altered metabolic profiles of the muscle as a consequence 
of transition to more fast (fatigable) muscle fibres.68 Adipose 
tissue is a potential source of proinflammatory cytokines and 
has been implicated in a range of musculoskeletal conditions, 
including osteoarthritis.69 Regardless of the underlying mecha-
nism, fibrotic changes in the muscle have a substantial potential 
impact on tissue dynamics and force generation capacity.
Exercise, physical modalities and pharmacological interven-
tions have all been shown to reduce the inflammatory processes 
associated with fascial tissue injury and fibrosis. For example, 
early treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs can prevent/
reverse pain behaviours induced by TNF signalling and reduce 
downstream collagen production in animal models.70 Stretching 
of fascial tissues can promote resolution of inflammation both in 
vivo and in vitro,71 and manual therapy can prevent overuse-in-
duced fibrosis in several fascial tissues.72 In terms of muscle 
changes, resistance exercise is necessary to reverse fatty changes 
(and perhaps fibrosis) in chronic conditions,73 whereas gentle 
muscle activation is sufficient to reverse early muscle atrophy,74 
and whole body exercise can prevent inflammatory changes in 
back muscles that follow intervertebral disc injuries.75
Outlook 
and 
perspectives 
for 
future 
research: 
Future research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the 
mechanisms underlying the impact of treatments on fibrosis and 
fatty changes in fascial tissues. Although there is evidence that 
exercise, physical therapies or pharmacological approaches can 
impact inflammatory processes, and reduce consequences, further 
work is required to understand how best to tailor interventions 
based on the time-course of pathology and type of exercise, or 
whether there is additional benefit from combined treatments.
imaging and non-imaging tools for diagnosis and assessment
Pathological changes in the mechanical properties of fascial 
tissues have been hypothesised to play an essential role in 
musculoskeletal disorders such as chronic pain conditions and 
overuse injuries.76 As a result, considerable demand for diag-
nostic methods examining fascial tissue function has arisen. In 
basic research, an oft-used approach is to study molecular and 
mechanical changes in myofibroblasts and other biomarkers via 
needle biopsy and subsequent immunohistochemistry.77
To evaluate the effects of treatment and exercise in clinical 
settings, a series of methods are available (table 1). Changes in 
water content can be analysed via bioimpedance assessment,78 but 
there are no data on reliability and validity of measurements in 
smaller body regions. Manual palpation represents a cost-neutral 
and widely used screening method aimed at assessing viscoelastic

properties (eg, stiffness); however, similarly, its reliability is 
limited.48 79 80 81 However, the approach is based on a number of 
assumptions, and available devices often lack a thorough proof 
of validity.77 82 Moreover, no tissue-specific conclusions can be 
drawn due to the black-box character of the measurements.83 
Imaging methods such as ultrasound or elastography, in contrast, 
are promising tools for explicitly quantifying the mechanical 
properties of fascial tissues under in vivo conditions.84
Producing a distortion of the measured tissue (eg, through 
compression or shear waves), elastography provides ultrasound 
images reflecting the relative hardness of the targeted area. 
Recently, the technique has been increasingly applied in muscu-
loskeletal research. However, the existence of several different 
methods, lack of standardisation and frequent appearance of 
artefacts during measurements threaten the validity of achieved 
results.85 Without the use of elastography, the conventional 
ultrasound image can be reliably used to display and measure 
the morphology of fascial tissues, such as myofascial tissues, 
ligaments and tendons.86 Some initial studies have, moreover, 
attempted to quantify relative movement (eg, sliding of fascial 
layers and shear strain) using cross-correlation calculations.87
Despite some initial applications to myofascial tissues, most data 
on ultrasound imaging are available for tendon measurements 
(figure 5). In the late 1990s, advancements made in the applica-
tion of B-mode ultrasonography allowed quantification of the 
tensile deformation of human tendons, in vivo, based on tracking 
of anatomical features in the tendon when pulled on by the force 
exerted in the in-series muscle during static contraction.88 Unfor-
tunately, the in vivo stiffness and Young’s modulus results often 
disagree with findings from in vitro material tests, when forces 
and elongations are precisely controlled and measured. Errors 
are likely being caused by in vivo measurement simplifications in 
the quantification of both tendon deformation and the loading 
applied during the static muscle contraction. The former includes 
simplifications regarding the tendon’s resting length, line of pull 
and uniformity in material properties. The latter includes simpli-
fications regarding the effect of loading on tendon moment arm 
length, the effect of antagonist muscle coactivation and the unifor-
mity in tendon cross-sectional area. Most of these simplifications 
can be avoided by appropriate measurements to quantify the 
neglected effects. In addition, recent developments in ultrasound 
shear-wave propagation89 and speckle tracking90 have the potential 
to substantially improve experimental accuracy and physiological 
relevance of in vivo findings.
In contrast to static muscle contraction tests aimed at assessing 
human tendon stiffness and Young’s modulus, scanning during 
dynamic activities has typically been applied to document 
tendon deformations directly, through morphometric analysis on 
scans,90 91 or indirectly, through ultrasound propagation speed 
analysis,92 93 to investigate the interaction between tendon and 
muscle in the studied task. These experimental approaches are 
relatively immune to problems caused by erroneous quantifica-
tion of tendon forces; however, appropriate measurements need 
to be taken to validate the assumption that the usual practice of 
tracking a single tendon anatomical point, or a tendon region 
limited by the size of the scanning probe, can give a representa-
tive picture for the entire tendon.
Outlook 
and 
perspectives 
for 
future 
research: 
 
In view of the current diagnostic methods’ limitations, further 
research investigating the measurement properties (eg, validity) is 
warranted to provide evidence-based recommendations. Hence, 
within the clinical assessment of mechanical soft-tissue properties, 
collected data should be interpreted with caution, and, as long as 
no clear gold standards exist, a combination of methods seems 
advisable instead of focusing exclusively on one technique. 
Ultrasound-based assessments of tendon deformability on loading 
have grown in popularity but can provide erroneous conclusions 
due to several invalid assumptions and approximations typically 
made to simplify the experimental protocol. Most of these errors 
can be eliminated by appropriate measurements.
mechanobiology of fascial tissues: effects of exercise and 
disuse
The main principles of the above ultrasound-based methodology 
have been implemented in numerous studies over the last 20 
years to study the adaptability of human tendons to exercise and 
disuse.94 95 The findings convincingly show that human tendons

respond to the application of chronic overloading by increasing 
their stiffness and to chronic unloading by decreasing their stiff-
ness. The mechanisms underpinning these adaptations include 
changes in tendon size and changes in Young’s modulus. One 
common finding among studies is that tendon adaptations occur 
quickly, within weeks of mechanical loading/unloading applica-
tion.96 97 Importantly, however, some studies report adaptations 
in tendon size but not tendon material,98 and others in tendon 
material but not size,96 while some report adaptations in both 
tendon size and material.99
To study human tendon mechanobiology and explore the basis 
of the above distinct adaptability features, both cross-sectional 
and longitudinal experimental designs have often been adopted. 
Cross-sectional designs have been used for the following 
purposes: (1) to compare tendons subjected to different habitual 
loads due to their specific anatomical location,100 (2) to compare 
tendons between limbs with muscle strength asymmetry,98 (3) to 
compare tendons in humans with different body mass but similar 
habitual activities95 and (4) to compare tendons in athletes with 
those in sedentary individuals.99 Study designs (1), (2) and (3) 
support the notion that adjustments in tendon stiffness to accom-
modate changes in physiological loading are accomplished by 
adding or removing tendon material rather than altering Young’s 
modulus of the tendon. Importantly, the addition or removal of 
tendon material does not seem to always occur uniformly along 
the tendon, but in some regions only, which can go undetected 
unless the whole tendon is examined.101 In contrast to study 
designs (1), (2) and (3), findings from study design (4) show that 
improvements in Young’s modulus of the tendon may occur and 
account fully for, or contribute to, the increased tendon stiffness 
in response to loading. Interestingly, exercise-training interven-
tion studies also report improvements in Young’s modulus of the 
tendon.94–96 In combination, these findings indicate that stiff-
ening of the tendon through alteration of its material requires 
‘supra-physiological’ loading features (eg, in terms of loading 
magnitude, frequency and/or duration). Once this rapid adap-
tation occurs and the exercise becomes a habitual daily activity, 
alterations in tendon size might mediate any further changes in 
tendon stiffness.
Outlook 
and 
perspectives 
for 
future 
research: 
 
Combining ultrasonography with dynamometry methods has now 
made it possible to assess in vivo human tendon plasticity under 
conditions of altered mechanical loading. T
wo important questions 
warrant further research. (1) What is the mechanism underpinning 
regional differences in tendon adaptability in terms of tendon size? 
Possibilities worth investigating include differences in local stress, 
local Young’s modulus, local blood flow and mechanotransduction 
sensitivity. Finite element modelling of the tendon may be an 
appropriate avenue to examine the first two possibilities. (2) What 
is the limiting factor in tendon plasticity to exercise? An intuitive 
answer is that the magnitude and time-course of tendon plasticity 
are merely determined by how much and how fast the in-series 
muscle force increases as the muscle adapts to the chronically 
increased load, but confirming this requires systematic research.
interventions for fascial tissue pathologies in sports medicine
Fascial tissue dysfunction in the field of sports medicine is 
rarely treated surgically. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used for 
sports-related overuse pathologies; however, they may impair 
regeneration and diminish tissue adaptation.24 25 Gyrase-in-
hibiting antibiotics often contribute to an increased likelihood 
of tendon injuries in sports.102 In addition, injections of plate-
let-rich plasma seem to be successful in some cases of tendinop-
athy, although efficacy remains inconclusive.67 103 Moderate 
evidence exists on the value of shockwave therapy and eccentric 
loading in tendon healing.104 105 Similarly, foam rolling (tool-as-
sisted massage of myofascial tissues) seems to improve short-
term flexibility and recovery from muscle soreness75 106 107 and 
decrease latent trigger point sensitivity.103 Nevertheless, the phys-
iological mechanisms of these reported effects remain unclear, 
although initial evidence suggests increases in arterial perfu-
sion, enhanced fascial layer sliding and modified corticospinal 
excitability following treatment108 109 (F Krause et al, submitted, 
2018). Finally, manual therapies, such as massage, osteopathy 
or Rolfing (a massage technique based on achieving symmetrical 
alignment of the body), are frequently used to improve fascial 
tissue regeneration or athletic performance, although their effi-
cacy still remains to be validated.110 111
Outlook 
and 
perspectives 
for 
future 
research: 
 
Hopefully, current and future improvements in assessment 
methodologies will generate more conclusive research regarding 
which treatment modalities are most promising for specific 
conditions. While commercial and other interests often favour the 
promotion of premature positive conclusions about specific fascia-
related treatments, strict application of scientific rigour is essential 
for the development of this promising field.
