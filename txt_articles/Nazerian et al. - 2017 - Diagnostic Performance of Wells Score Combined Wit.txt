ABSTRACT
Objective: Lung and venous ultrasound are bedside diagnostic tools increasingly used in the early diagnostic
approach of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the possibility of improving the conventional
prediction rule for PE by integrating ultrasound has never been investigated.
Methods: We performed lung and venous ultrasound in consecutive patients suspected of PE in four emergency
departments. Conventional Wells score (Ws) was adjudicated by the attending physician, and ultrasound was
performed by one of 20 investigators. Signs of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at venous ultrasound and signs of
pulmonary infarcts or alternative diagnoses at lung ultrasound were considered to recalculate two items of the Ws:
signs and symptoms of DVT and alternative diagnosis less likely than PE. The diagnostic performances of the
ultrasound-enhanced Ws (USWs) and Ws were then compared after confirmation of the final diagnosis.
Results: A total of 446 patients were studied. PE was confirmed in 125 patients (28%). USWs performed
significantly better than Ws, with a sensitivity of 69.6% versus 57.6% and a specificity of 88.2% versus 68.2%. In
combination with D-dimer, USWs showed an optimal failure rate (0.8%) and a significantly superior efficiency than
Ws (32.3% vs. 27.2%). A strategy based on lung and venous ultrasound combined with D-dimer would allow to
avoid CT pulmonary angiography in 50.5% of patients with suspected PE, compared to 27.2% when the rule
without ultrasound is applied.
Conclusions: A pretest risk stratification enhanced by ultrasound of lung and venous performs better than Ws
in the early diagnostic process of PE.
C
linical prediction rules are recommended to ori-
entate the diagnostic process of many acute dis-
eases, such as coronary syndromes, heart failure, aortic
syndromes and also venous thromboembolic disease.
For suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), the interna-
tional guidelines recommend the use of a combination
of D-dimer with clinical scores, such as the Wells
score (Ws), to optimize the diagnostic process and the

 use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography
(CTPA) for final confirmation.1–5
Ultrasound is a safe, rapid, and powerful diagnostic
tool and the integration of the clinical assessment with
point-of-care ultrasound is growingly considered in the
assessment of acute patients.6 Moreover, with the
advent of portable machines, ultrasound is exponen-
tially used by the clinical care teams in the early evalu-
ation of patients presenting with dyspnea, chest pain,
syncope and shock, all conditions where PE is in the
differential diagnosis. The strength of ultrasound is
based on its ease of use at bedside and good accuracy
when performed by physician with an appropriate
training. Some authors already investigated its diagnos-
tic performance in patients with suspected PE.7–11
However, apart from the intrinsic diagnostic power of
ultrasound in the definitive diagnosis of a complex dis-
ease, to date no one investigated the possibility of
improving the prediction rules for PE by integrating
clinical data with lung and venous ultrasound.
The main aim of this study was to compare the
diagnostic performance of the Ws to that of the Ws
combined with lung and venous ultrasound (USWs).
Furthermore, as secondary outcome, we evaluated
whether a diagnostic strategy based on clinical and
ultrasound data could safely reduce the use of CTPA.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This was an observational cohort multicenter diagnos-
tic accuracy study. Study patients were recruited from
July 2014 to April 2015 in the emergency departments
(EDs) of four Italian university hospitals staffed with
14, 20, 22, and 45 ED beds. The four EDs had
annual censuses of 50,000, 50,000, 80,000, and
100,000 visits and admission rates of 10, 15, 13, and
12%,
respectively.
The
local
ethics
committees
approved the study. Written informed consent was
obtained for inclusion in the study. The study was reg-
istered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02190110).
Study Protocol and Population
Consecutive patients, older than 18 years, presenting
with dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and palpitations
with suspected acute PE, were considered eligible for
the study. The suspicion of PE was subjectively estab-
lished by the attending physician after the initial stan-
dard
evaluation,
which
included
medical
history,
physical
examination, and electrocardiogram in all
patients and arterial blood gas analysis and chest X-ray
when requested for clinical reasons. The attending physi-
cian adjudicated the scores of the Ws items (Data Sup-
plement S1, available as supporting information in the
online version of this paper) and gave notification to the
sonographer investigator. Patients not studied by ultra-
sound within 3 hours from enrollment were excluded.
The attending physician, blinded to ultrasound results,
ordered a multidetector CTPA, or scintigraphy in alter-
native, independently from the patient’s enrollment and
in accordance to the standard of care recommended by
international guidelines.1–3 High-sensitive D-dimer was
part of the routine evaluation of patients suspected of PE
and was considered negative based on the cutoff value
(not aged adjusted) of each center.
Ultrasound Examination
Lung and venous ultrasound were performed by one
of 20 sonographer investigators. They were eight
senior physicians (seven internal medicine specialists
and one pulmonologist) and 12 residents in internal
medicine, emergency medicine, or pulmonology with
at least 6 months’ experience in lung and venous
ultrasound produced on their own. This practical per-
sonal experience was always preceded by a teaching
course in emergency ultrasound, continued by a per-
iod of training assisted by an expert including a mini-
mum
of
30
lung
and
30
venous
ultrasound
examinations. Investigators were blinded to diagnostic
tests and to all the clinical information except symp-
toms of presentation and visible physical signs. Ultra-
sound
examinations
were
performed
using
the
following multiprobe machines: three MyLab30 Gold,
one MyLab40, one Mylab50, and one Mylab alpha
(Esaote SpA); one Logiq3 and one Logiq5 Pro (Gen-
eral Electric); and one HD7 (Koninklijke Philips
N.V.). Lung and veins were studied according to pre-
defined
ultrasound
protocols.
The
effective
time
needed to perform the examination was recorded with-
out considering machine positioning and switch on
procedure. Lung was examined by longitudinal and
oblique scans on anterior–lateral and posterior tho-
racic areas by convex or linear probes based on inves-
tigator convenience. The anterior–lateral examination
was performed with the patient in the supine or near-
to-supine position. When feasible, dorsal areas were
scanned in the sitting position or by turning the
patient in the lateral decubitus on both sides in case
of forced supine position. The examination
was

 targeted to the detection of pulmonary infarcts. Pul-
monary infarcts were defined as pleural-based, well-
demarcated, and echo-poor triangular or rounded con-
solidations of at least 0.5 cm in main diameter.9
Other predefined findings, consistent with alternative
diagnoses that might explain the symptoms of presenta-
tion, were lung consolidations suggestive of pneumonia,
pleural effusion, and diffuse interstitial syndrome. All
the above-mentioned findings were defined and diag-
nosed according to international recommendations on
point-of-care lung ultrasound.12 Pleural effusion, when
not associated with a pulmonary infarct, was never con-
sidered diagnostic for PE. Rather, a large isolated pleural
effusion in a dyspneic patient or an effusion combined
with a consolidation and a complex ultrasound pattern
typical of infection were considered alternative diagnosis.
Leg venous ultrasound was performed using a linear
probe. The femoral veins and the popliteal veins were
visualized in short axis and compressed. Deep venous
thrombosis (DVT) was defined by the absence of total
collapse of the vein during compression. After the com-
pletion of lung and venous ultrasound examination, the
investigators completed the ultrasound standardized
form (Data Supplement S2, available as supporting
information in the online version of this paper).
Ws and USWs
On the basis of ultrasound signs detected by the sono-
grapher, two items of the Ws were recalculated: the
item “signs and symptoms of DVT” was replaced by
“venous ultrasound positive for DVT.” The item “al-
ternative diagnosis less likely than PE” was replaced by
“alternative diagnosis less likely than PE after lung
ultrasound” (Table 1). The latter item was considered
positive and assigned three points if at least one pul-
monary infarct was visualized at lung ultrasound,
whereas it was assigned zero points in the absence of
infarcts and if a condition of ultrasonographic findings
compatible with an alternative pulmonary diagnosis
was detected. If lung ultrasound was normal, the
assigned points remained those considered in the con-
ventional Ws. The diagnosis of PE was considered
“unlikely” for scores ≤4, both for Ws and for USWs.
In a nonrandomized subgroup of patients, we calcu-
lated the interobserver agreement of the two items
reported above for Ws and USWs. To this purpose,
the subgroup was selected based on a convenience
sampling when two sonographers were available to
perform the ultrasound examination in the same
patient within the time limit. Each patient of this
subgroup was independently scanned by two sonogra-
phers, who filled the ultrasound form in a blinded
fashion, while the items of the Ws were independently
assigned by two attending physicians.
Criterion Standard for PE Diagnosis
Multidetector CTPA (≥64 row detectors) was the pri-
mary second-level diagnostic imaging test used in all
enrolling centers. If CTPA was contraindicated due to
contrast medium allergy or severe renal failure, lung
scintigraphy was scheduled. After the conclusion of
this
first
diagnostic
process,
patients
entered
a
3-months follow-up. All included patients were asked
to contact the ED, in case of new, worsening, or recur-
rent symptoms after discharge from the hospital.
PE diagnosis was established only upon confirma-
tion by a second-level diagnostic imaging test per-
formed in the ED or during the time course of the
follow-up. This latter had three main characteristics: 1)
post hoc evaluation of the clinical chart in admitted
patients at the end of the 3 months, 2) outpatient visit
at the end of the follow-up, and 3) phone interview at
the end of the follow-up and request to communicate
any change during the time course. In patients who
died before the diagnostic completion, PE was consid-
ered the cause of death only when confirmed by
autopsy or when the cause remained unexplained and
PE could not be confidently ruled out. In each center,
final diagnosis was established by a physician expert in
PE diagnosis who, blinded to study results, reviewed
all the clinical and imaging data obtained in ED, dur-
ing hospitalization and follow-up.

 sided McNemar’s test assuming a sensitivity of 60% of
the Ws,13 a prevalence of acute PE of 25%, and an
alpha error of 1%. Based on these assumptions, the
minimal number of patients needed to detect a 10%
increase in sensitivity of USWs with a power of 80%
is 392. Unpaired student’s t-test was used to compare
normally distributed data. Fisher’s exact test was used
for comparison of noncontinuous variables expressed
as proportions. A p-value of <0.05 indicates statistical
significance. All p-values are two-sided. The extended
McNemar and the McNemar test were used to evalu-
ate if there was significant difference in the sensitivities
and specificities of Ws and USWs.14 The contribution
of each ultrasound item was studied by plotting the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of Ws,
Ws plus venous ultrasound, Ws plus lung ultrasound,
and USWs as a whole.15 The k-statistic was calculated
to assess interobserver agreement.16
To evaluate a diagnostic strategy to rule-out PE, the
failure rate and the efficiency of D-dimer in patients
with Ws or USWs unlikely were calculated. Failure
rate (false-negative proportion) was calculated as the
number of patients with a negative D-dimer and a
final diagnosis of PE divided by all patients with nega-
tive D-dimer in the unlikely groups. Efficiency was
defined as the proportion of patients with negative
D-dimer combined with Ws unlikely or USWs unli-
kely among study patients.
Calculations were performed with the use of SPSS
statistical package (version 17.0, SPSS Inc.). The study
had no funding source.
RESULTS
Study Population
Of 491 patients considered for the study, 446 patients
were included in the final analysis (Figure 1). CTPA
was performed in 297 (66.6%) whereas lung scintigra-
phy in nine patients (2%). PE was confirmed in 125
(28%) patients (Table 2). Diagnosis of PE was estab-
lished in 119 patients by CTPA, in five by lung
scintigraphy, and in one by autopsy. Characteristics of
patients with and without PE are shown in Table 3.
USWs Versus Ws
USWs showed a 12% increase in sensitivity and 22%
increase
in
specificity
when
compared
to
Ws
(p < 0.01 for both; Table 4). The number of patients
classified “unlikely” with the Ws was 272 (61%)
versus 321 (72%) with USWs (p < 0.01). In these
“unlikely” groups, PE was then diagnosed (false nega-
tives) in 53 (19.5%) in the Ws score group and in 38
(11.8%) when the USWs was applied (p < 0.01). The
analysis of ROC curves showed that the area under
the curve (AUC) values of Ws combined with only
venous ultrasound (76.4%, 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 71.1% to 81.7%) or Ws combined with only
lung ultrasound (77.5%, 95% CI = 72.5% to 82.5%)
were significantly better in comparison to the AUC of
Ws alone (65.3%, 95% CI = 59.4% to 71.2%;
p < 0.01 for both). The AUC of the USWs (86.2%,
95% CI = 82.1% to 90.3%) was superior to all these
three (p < 0.01; Figure 2). USWs overall accuracy was
85% (95% CI = 80.7% to 89.3%) when ultrasound
was performed by senior physician and 80% (95%
CI = 74.2% to 85.8%) when performed by residents.
Interobserver agreement was investigated in a sub-
group of 36 patients. Final diagnosis of PE was not
statistically different among this group and all included
patients. The k-values for “signs and symptoms of
DVT” and “alternative diagnosis less likely than PE”
were 0.65 and 0.51, respectively, whereas the k-values
for the respective ultrasound-enhanced items were
0.94 and 0.79, respectively.
Lung and Venous Ultrasound
Lung and venous ultrasound were performed in all
patients. The time needed for ultrasound examination
was 7 � 3 minutes (mean � SD). In 40 cases (9%)
lung was studied only on anterior–lateral areas due to
poor compliance or impossibility to move the patient.
Seventy-five (16.8%) patients showed at least one pul-
monary infarct at ultrasound, with a mean of 1.6
lesions per patient, and in 57 (76%) of these, PE was
confirmed. Figure 3 shows a pulmonary infarct sur-
rounded by pleural effusion. In the 18 (24% of 75)
patients with pulmonary infarct detected by lung ultra-
sound without PE, the final diagnoses were pneumo-
nia in seven cases, heart failure and tachyarrhythmia
in four, COPD/fibrosis in two, lung cancer in two,
previous thromboembolic disease in two, and muscu-
loskeletal chest pain in one. Sensitivity, specificity, and
positive and negative predictive values of pulmonary
infarct for PE diagnosis were 45.6, 94.4, 76, and
81.7%, respectively. In the 371 patients without pul-
monary infarcts (83.2%), at least one alternative lung
ultrasound
diagnosis
was
detected
in
176
cases
(47.4%). Alternative diagnoses were pleural effusion in
105 cases, pneumonia in 87, and diffuse interstitial

 syndrome in 66. Of 85 (19.1%) patients with DVT at
venous ultrasound, PE was confirmed in 74 (87.1%),
corresponding to 59.2% of all PE patients. Diagnostic
performance of venous ultrasound is reported in
Table 3.
Diagnostic Strategies to Rule Out PE Based
on Ultrasound, Clinical Scores, and D-dimer
The diagnostic variables of different strategies to rule
out PE, including clinical and ultrasound data without
D-dimer and Ws or USWs with D-dimer, are reported
in Table 5. Of 167 patients with lung ultrasound
signs of a possible alternative diagnosis, without
infarcts and no evidence of DVT at venous ultra-
sound, PE was still diagnosed in 12 (7.2%). PE was
also diagnosed in seven (5.9%) of 119 patients with a
USWs = 0.
In 396 (88%) patients, D-dimer was available for
statistical analysis, of whom 248 with Ws unlikely and
288 with USWs unlikely. The failure rate (0.8%) of
USWs ≤ 4 and negative D-dimer was half the failure
rate
of
Ws
≤
4
and
negative
D-dimer
(1.9%;
p = 0.33). Efficiency of USWs plus D-dimer (32.3%)
was significantly superior (+5.1%) to Ws plus D-dimer
(27.2%; p < 0.01).

Nazerian et al. • ULTRASOUND-ENHANCED WELLS SCORE IN PULMONARY EMBOLISM
 DISCUSSION
This multicenter study demonstrated that integration
of an ultrasound study of lung and leg veins improves
the accuracy of a pretest probability score in the diag-
nostic process of PE at bedside. The accuracy of Ws
was significantly increased when the item “signs and
symptoms of DVT” was replaced by “venous ultra-
sound positive for DVT” and the item “alternative
diagnosis
less
likely
than
PE”
was
replaced
by
“alternative diagnosis less likely than PE after lung
ultrasound.” The best accuracy was obtained when
results from both lung and venous ultrasound were
considered. In our study, we used a point-of-care ultra-
sound technique that was easy to learn by the opera-
tors,
low
cost,
and
noninvasive.
All
these
characteristics potentially make this technique suitable
for a wide use as an extension of the physical exami-
nation in the acute care setting. Notably, lung and
venous ultrasound were rapidly feasible in all patients
by a large number of physicians with different skills,
expertise, and professional background.
Two items of the Ws, the probability of PE and
clinical signs of DVT, are based on considerations that
are strictly subjective and the risk of high variability
when physicians with different experience and skills
adjudicate these two items is concrete.17–20 In the pro-
posed USWs, the two substitute items supported by
an early ultrasound study of lung and veins represent
the objective transposition of the probability of PE (di-
rect visualization of pulmonary infarction or signs of
alternative diagnoses) and DVT (definitive confirma-
tion of the diagnosis). Indeed, the interobserver agree-
ment of the ultrasound signs was significantly superior
to the clinical judgment in the present experience and
in comparison to a previous study.20
Accordingly with previous studies, to validate the
safety of a diagnostic strategy to rule out PE, the upper
limit of the 95% CI around the failure rate should
not be higher than 3%.21–25 Guided by this limit, we
also investigated different strategies to rule out PE and
whether these strategies may allow reducing safely the
number of CTPA performed in emergency (Table 5).
The strategies based on ultrasound without D-dimer

 (USWs = 0 or lung ultrasound signs of alternative
diagnosis, without infarcts and no evidence of DVT at
venous ultrasound) were shown to be not sufficiently
safe. However, our study showed that in the group of
patients with USWs unlikely, a negative D-dimer
could safely rule out PE with the upper limit of the
95% CI fairly below the limit of 3% (2.3%). These
results show that D-dimer is still needed even when
ultrasound is used to enhance the clinical prediction
rule. In patients with Ws unlikely, a negative D-dimer
showed a 95% CI upper limit around the failure rate
of 4.5%. We must report that a diagnostic strategy
based on USWs and D-dimer obtained a non–statisti-
cally significant decrease in the failure rate when com-
pared with Ws plus D-dimer (0.8% vs. 1.9%).
In the diagnostic process, we also analyzed the
potential of lung and venous ultrasound to rule in PE.
Our study, confirmed the high specificity of the ultra-
sound lung examination for infarcts reported in a
recent metanalysis.26 However, the positive predictive
value was still inadequate to rule in PE without the
need for a confirmative second-level diagnostic test, as
we had 18 false-positive patients on lung ultrasound
who would have been improperly treated with antico-
agulants. Thus, combination with other data and
imaging tools should be considered before final confir-
mation. Regarding venous ultrasound, a positive proxi-
mal compression technique showed a high positive
predictive value for PE. Indeed, the ultrasound diagno-
sis of proximal DVT in patients suspected of PE is
already considered sufficient for final confirmation in
emergency by the societal guidelines and warrants anti-
coagulant treatment without further testing.1–3,7 Salaun
et al.27 investigated the application of leg venous

 ultrasound in suspected PE, but only when performed
by specialists in vascular ultrasound. In their study,
13% of patients with positive DVT, corresponding to
44% of all PE, concluded the diagnostic process for
PE without CTPA. The novelty of our approach is
that venous ultrasound is applied as part of a rapid
point-of-care ultrasound technique in the hands of
physicians with different background and not depend-
ing on external consultations of vascular specialists or
radiologists. Even if ultrasound confirmation of DVT
in our USWs is not sufficient alone to give high prob-
ability (score = 3), it remains a criterion to conclude
the process and start treatment according to societal
guidelines. Indeed, diagnosis of DVT not necessarily
coincide with PE but demands starting anticoagula-
tion.
In Figure 4 we propose a new diagnostic strategy
that integrates USWs and D-dimer that must be vali-
dated in further studies specifically designed. The pro-
posed integration with ultrasound allows to avoid a
number of CTPA that is superior to the conventional
approach (50.5% vs. 27.2%). This difference is based
on a better performance of USWs to rule out PE
(USWs “unlikely” combined with negative D-dimer)
and on the possibility to avoid CTPA when DVT is
diagnosed by venous ultrasound.
LIMITATIONS
Our study did not consider other validated prediction
rules. However, a recent meta-analysis comparing the
Ws to the revised Geneva score demonstrated a supe-
rior accuracy of the former.28 In a meta-analysis by
Lucassen et al.,13 the sensitivity of the dichotomized
Ws was close to that obtained in our study, whereas
the specificity was superior. The high interoperator
variability of two items of the Ws, confirmed in our
study, may have an influence on the discrepancy found
in different studies. The aim of our study was to vali-
date a basic ultrasound technique for the first examina-
tion of patients suspected of PE. It was necessary to
assure the possibility of a wide diffusion based on ease
and efficiency of implementation among physicians
with different levels of skills and experience, still main-
taining enough reliability and safety. For this reason,
we chose to exclude cardiac ultrasound and to involve
a high number of ultrasound operators. Such choices
have some limitations. First, including a cardiac exami-
nation might further increase the accuracy of our ultra-
sound approach. Indeed, a multiorgan ultrasound
approach that includes the cardiac evaluation showed
to be useful in the diagnosis of PE in previous stud-
ies.10,11 However, cardiac ultrasound is not feasible in
all patients due to the concrete possibility of poor ultra-
sound windows, in addition to being far more time-
consuming and needing a longer educational training
than lung and venous ultrasound. An ultrasound
approach limited to lung and veins is more practical as
a first-level strategy. Second, we cannot exclude that
the accuracy of lung and venous ultrasound obtained
in our study may had been improved by involving only
few operators with very high ultrasound skills and
experience. However, involving a large number of
physicians with different background and experience
better represents the daily practice of the ED. More-
over, although the technique used has proved to be of
simple acquisition and application, there are still chal-
lenges and uncertainty associated with a rapid learning
process and accuracy variability in different institutions
and staffs. A correct and effective skill acquisition and

 sufficient practice should always precede the applica-
tion of lung and venous ultrasound in the diagnostic
process of PE. The rate of PE in this study was high
(28%) and it is not known how would be the perfor-
mance of Ws enhanced by lung and venous ultra-
sound in a population with lower PE incidence. Chest
x-ray is an inexpensive and rapid diagnostic imaging
test routinely used in the ED; in fact, about two-thirds
of enrolled patients underwent chest x-ray. The treating
physician when assigning the Ws item “alternative
diagnosis less likely than PE” was influenced by chest
x-ray results; however, a specific evaluation of the diag-
nostic accuracy of “chest x-ray enhanced” Ws was not
performed. Finally, we must highlight that the main
aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic perfor-
mance of USWs with Ws and that the study was not
powered to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic
strategy based on USWs plus D-dimer; therefore, for
this purpose the study can be considered only hypothe-
sis generating.
CONCLUSIONS
In
patients
with
suspected
pulmonary
embolism,
point-of-care lung and venous ultrasound is feasible
and rapid and increases the accuracy of the conven-
tional Ws. However, integration with the D-dimer is
still needed. A diagnostic strategy, which integrates
clinical information, lung and venous ultrasound, and
D-dimer, may increase the performance of risk stratifi-
cation and may reduce the use of computed tomogra-
phy
pulmonary
angiography
in
the
diagnostic
approach to pulmonary embolism, still maintaining an
acceptable safety profile.
