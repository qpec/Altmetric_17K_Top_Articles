GTPase of immunity-associated protein 5 (Gimap5) is linked with lymphocyte survival,
autoimmunity, and colitis, but its mechanisms of action are unclear. Here, we show that
Gimap5 is essential for the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) following
T cell activation. In the absence of Gimap5, constitutive GSK3β activity constrains c-Myc
induction and NFATc1 nuclear import, thereby limiting productive CD4+ T cell proliferation.
Additionally, Gimap5 facilitates Ser389 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of GSK3β,
thereby limiting DNA damage in CD4+ T cells. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition and
genetic targeting of GSK3β can override Gimap5 deficiency in CD4+ T cells and ameliorates
immunopathology in mice. Finally, we show that a human patient with a GIMAP5 loss-of-
function mutation has lymphopenia and impaired T cell proliferation in vitro that can be
rescued with GSK3 inhibitors. Given that the expression of Gimap5 is lymphocyte-restricted,
we propose that its control of GSK3β is an important checkpoint in lymphocyte proliferation.

TPase of immunity-associated protein 5 (Gimap5) is
linked with lymphocyte survival, immune homeostasis,
and (auto)immune disease. Specifically, polymorphisms
in human GIMAP5 are associated with increased risk of
islet autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE)1–3, and asthma4. Mice and rats with
complete
loss-of-function
(LOF)
mutations
have
reduced
lymphocyte survival, loss of immunological tolerance predispos-
ing to autoimmunity and colitis, and abnormal liver pathology
resulting
from
persistent
post-natal
extramedullary
hematopoiesis5–14. Despite this critical role of Gimap5 in lym-
phocyte
survival
and
peripheral
tolerance,
the
underlying
mechanism(s) are unclear.
Gimap proteins are predominantly expressed in lymphocytes
and regulate lymphocyte survival during development, selection,
and homeostasis15. Members of this family share a GTP-binding
AIG1 homology domain16,17 and seem to be localized to different
subcellular compartments, with Gimap5 localizing in multi-
vesicular bodies (MVB) and lysosomes18. Overall, a function for
Gimaps in maintaining T cell homeostasis is not clearly defined.
We
previously
generated
Gimap5-deficient
mice,
so-called
“sphinx” mice, which have a missense mutation in Gimap5 that
results in what is essentially a null allele6. Gimap5sph/sph mice
progressively lose CD4+ T cells and B cells, an effect that is
associated with reduced regulatory T (Treg) cell function, while
remaining CD4+ T cells have an activated phenotype, but have an
impaired capacity to proliferate5,6. These immunologic defects
result in spontaneous and lethal colitis that is preventable with
CD4+ T cell depletion, Treg cell transplantation, or antibiotic
therapy5,6. Despite these effective therapies, the cell-intrinsic
defects in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells, including their reduced
survival, persist. In addition to colitis, livers from Gimap5sph/sph
mice have an abnormal morphology with extramedullary hema-
topoiesis and associated foci of hematopoietic cells and hepato-
cyte apoptosis6–8.
The family of glycogen synthase kinases-3 (GSK3) includes
constitutively active protein serine/threonine kinases encoded by
two genes, Gsk3a and Gsk3b. Studies have shown that GSK3β has
an
essential
function
in
T
cell
differentiation
and
proliferation19–22. GSK3 phosphorylates a variety of substrates,
often within the phosphodegron domains, thereby regulating
protein ubiquitination/degradation and their activity23. Among
the substrates targeted directly by GSK3 are c-Myc, NFATc1,
Mcl-1, and β-catenin24. Studies have established that upon
antigen-specific
activation
of
T
cells,
GSK3β
activity
is
inhibited19–22,
thereby
facilitating
T
cell
activation
and
proliferation. Phosphorylation of GSK3β at residues Ser9 or
Ser389 and physical separation of GSK3β from its target
proteins through vesicle association have been proposed as
mechanisms of GSK3β inhibition25,26. Inhibition of GSK3 by
phosphorylation of Ser389 is essential for lymphocyte viability
upon double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB) evident during V(D)J
recombination in thymic T cell development or in B cells
undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR)27.
Further reports have demonstrated that GSK3β is involved
in the regulation of nonhomologous end-joining repair of DSB,
with pharmacological inhibition and shRNA knockdown of
GSK3β
promoting
DNA
repair28.
Nonetheless,
the
exact
mechanism by which inhibition of GSK3 activity is regulated in
T cells is unclear.
In the current study, we provide an important insight into the
functional role of Gimap5. Gimap5 is a critical inhibitor of
GSK3β in both human and mouse CD4+ T cells, affecting c-Myc
and Mcl-1 expression, NFATc1 nuclear translocation, and T cell
fitness by controlling the DNA damage response occurring during
T cell proliferation.
Results
Gimap5sph/sph mice have normal thymic output of CD4+
T cells. Studies implicate a loss of peripheral CD4+ T cells in both
Gimap5-deficient mice and rats6,8,12,15,29–31. To determine whe-
ther the observed reduction in peripheral CD4+ T cells might
stem from abnormal thymic CD4+ T cell development, we
investigated whether the survival and/or output of thymic CD4+
T cells in Gimap5sph/sph mice was affected. To assess the survival
of thymocytes, we isolated thymic CD4+ T cells and cultured
them in the presence of IL-7 for 1 week. Subsequently, the
number of live single positive (SP) CD4+/CD8− T cells was
quantified at various incubation times. Notably, our data indicate
no differences in the survival ex vivo between SP CD4+ thymo-
cytes isolated from wildtype (WT) and Gimap5sph/sph mice
(Supplementary Figure 1A).
We next assessed if reduced thymic output of CD4+ T cells
might contribute to lymphopenia in Gimap5sph/sph mice, and
quantified the presence of recent thymic emigrants (RTE)32 in the
spleen of WT and Gimap5sph/sph mice. Importantly, we found no
marked differences in the frequency of splenic RTE as defined by
CD24hi CD4+ T cells between 3-week-old WT or Gimap5sph/sph
mice (Supplementary Figure 1B). These data are in line with our
previous studies showing Gimap5sph/sph mice have a relatively
normal thymic development of CD4+ T cells6.
Activation-induced cell death of peripheral CD4+ T cells. We
next focused on the peripheral survival of CD4+ T cells in
Gimap5sph/sph mice. We considered that either post-thymic sur-
vival of Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells or T-cell receptor (TCR)-
induced activation contributes to the loss of CD4+ T cells in the
periphery. The latter would be consistent with our previous stu-
dies showing that Gimap5sph/sph T cells failed to proliferate after
TCR stimulation with αCD3/αCD28 ± IL-26. Moreover, a pro-
gressive loss of CD4+ T cells is observed post-weaning—a period
in which the CD4+ T cell compartment has to cope with marked
changes in gut microbial antigens. To directly test the role of TCR
activation in vivo, we generated Gimap5sph/sph; Rag2−/−;OT-II
TCR transgenic mice. These mice contain CD4+ T cells that only
recognize the OVA323–339 epitope presented by I-Ab in C57BL/6
mice and lack endogenous CD4+ T cell repertoires and CD8+
T cells and B cells. Interestingly, their CD4+ T cell compartment
is largely maintained in the absence of antigen and predominantly
have a naïve (CD44lo;CD62hi) phenotype (Fig. 1a, b). In contrast,
Gimap5sph/sph;Rag2−/−;OT-II mice exposed to ovalbumin in
drinking water have a reduced CD4+ T cell population with an
increased proportion of remaining CD4+ T cells displaying a
memory-like phenotype (CD44hi;CD62Llo) compared to WT
controls (Fig. 1a, b). Moreover, these mice failed to induce
antigen-specific Treg cells (Fig. 1c). These data show that antigen-
specific activation of Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells directly con-
tributes to the loss of these cells in vivo. To assess the potential
contribution of reduced homeostatic survival of peripheral CD4+
T cells, we isolated CD4+ T cells from the spleen of WT and
Gimap5sph/sph mice and cultured them in the presence of IL-7.
The number of live CD4+ T cells was quantified at various time
points; in contrast to the thymic SP CD4 T cells, splenic
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cell numbers were significantly reduced
compared to WT (Fig. 1d). These data suggest that peripheral
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells have a reduced peripheral survival
compared to WT CD4+ T cells.
We next sought to identify whether the cell-intrinsic apoptosis
pathways contributed to the reduced CD4+ T cell survival in
Gimap5sph/sph mice. One study suggests that Gimap5 directly
binds anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL15, while another
suggests that loss of Gimap5 is associated with increased Mcl-1

 degradation and compromised mitochondrial integrity in hema-
topoietic progenitor cells7. To test the potential role of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL in the reduced survival of Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells, we
crossed the Gimap5sph/sph allele onto a Bim−/− background.
Importantly, we observed no rescue of peripheral T cell survival
(Supplementary Figure 2A–D). We next assessed Mcl-1 expres-
sion in resting and activated CD4+ T cells and observed that
accumulation of Mcl-1, similar to hematopoietic progenitor cells7,
was reduced in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells compared to WT
controls after 24 h of stimulation with αCD3/αCD28 (Supple-
mentary Figure 2E). Studies have shown that Bax/Bak deletion
can prevent CD4+ T cell death in the complete absence of Mcl-
133. However, crossing the Gimap5sph/sph allele onto a Bax/Bak
double-deficient background failed to rescue CD4+ T cell survival
(Supplementary Figure 2F), thus the impact of the reduced Mcl-1
expression is unclear. Finally, we sought to investigate if Gimap5-
deficient CD4+ T cells were more susceptible to cell-extrinsic
apoptosis pathways. Stimulation of CD4+ T cells with αCD3/
αCD28 in the absence/presence of activating Fas antibodies for
8 h, however, resulted in similar frequencies of apoptotic and
dead cells between WT and Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells
(Supplementary Figure 2G).
Together these data indicate that the reduced survival of
peripheral CD4+ T cells in Gimap5sph/sph mice occurs indepen-
dently of the cell-intrinsic apoptosis pathways.
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells have abnormal GSK3 activity. To
identify the molecular defects that mediate decreased prolifera-
tion, we assessed the activation of proximal signaling pathways in
CD4+ T cells from 3-week-old Gimap5sph/sph mice. At this age,
CD4+ T cell numbers are comparable to WT with a normal
frequency of naïve CD4+ T cells that have a quiescent phenotype
(Supplementary Figure 3A). Importantly, our data indicated no
abnormalities in the activation of proximal signaling pathways
(IκB, ERK, JNK, AKT, p38, mTORC1, and p70 S6K) (Supple-
mentary Figure 3B–D). However, we observed a marked reduc-
tion in protein levels of the transcription factor (TF) c-Myc in
activated Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a). C-Myc is a TF
necessary for the metabolic programming of T cells following
activation and is required for optimal T cell proliferation34,35.
Notably, myc mRNA levels in resting or αCD3/αCD28-stimulated
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells were comparable to WT controls,
suggesting that reduction in protein levels was the result of
changes
in
post-translational
regulation
(Fig.
2b).
Post-
translational regulation of c-Myc is mediated in part by the
family of GSK3 proteins, which is comprised of constitutively
active protein serine/threonine kinase paralogs GSK3α and
GSK3β. GSK3α/β phosphorylate c-Myc at Thr58, priming it for
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation36.
Studies suggest that GSK3β plays an essential role in T cell
differentiation and proliferation. Specifically, upon antigen-

 specific activation of T cells, GSK3β activity is inhibited19–22,37,
thereby facilitating T cell activation and proliferation. GSK3
phosphorylates
a
variety
of
substrates,
regulating
protein
ubiquitination/degradation and/or their activity23. Among the
substrates targeted by GSK3 are c-Myc, Mcl-1, NFATc1, and β-
catenin24,38–41. Elevated GSK3 activity in stimulated Gimap5sph/
sph CD4+ T cells would account for the reduced protein levels of
Mcl-1
(Supplementary
Figure
2E),
which
is
targeted
for
proteasomal degradation upon phosphorylation by GSK339,40.
Moreover, αCD3/αCD28-stimulated Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells
also showed a slight reduction in β-catenin protein expression,
but normal β-catenin mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure 4A,B),
consistent with an elevated GSK3 activity.
To further investigate whether GSK3 activity was elevated in
the absence of Gimap5, we stimulated WT and Gimap5sph/sph
CD4+ T cells with αCD3/αCD28 for 24 h. During the final 4 h,
proteasomal degradation was blocked with the inhibitor MG132
to allow the evaluation of GSK3 phosphorylation of c-Myc at
Thr58. Strikingly, Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells had a higher
proportion of c-Myc phosphorylation than WT CD4+ T cells
(Fig. 2c). Moreover, the GSK3-inhibitor LiCl increased c-Myc and
β-catenin accumulation in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells following
TCR stimulation (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figure 4C). We thus
hypothesized
that
impaired
suppression
of
GSK3
activity
compromises productive T cell proliferation in Gimap5sph/sph
mice. To test this, CD4+ T cells from WT and Gimap5sph/sph mice
were stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 in the presence/absence of
GSK3-inhibitors, LiCl or 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO).
Strikingly, in the presence of GSK3-inhibitors, CD4+ T cells from
Gimap5sph/sph
mice
completely
regained
their
proliferative
capacity in vitro and showed comparable survival to WT CD4+
T cells (Fig. 2e).
Finally, we assessed nuclear translocation of NFATc1, a TF
necessary
for productive T cell activation (Supplementary
Figure 4D) and regulated by GSK3α/β42,43. Unlike c-Myc and
β-catenin, however, GSK3 phosphorylation of NFATc1 regulates

 (Supplementary Figure 4F). Together these data suggest that the
absence of Gimap5 causes impaired inactivation of GSK3,
ultimately resulting in a failure to accumulate TFs and nuclear
localization that are critically required for CD4+ T cell survival/
proliferation.
Loss of Gimap5 results in impaired sequestration of GSK3β. As
mentioned, antigen-specific activation of T cells requires inacti-
vation of GSK3 activity22; we therefore sought to determine how
inactivation of GSK3β in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells was
impaired. The exact mechanism by which inhibition of GSK3β
activity is regulated is not well defined. However, a variety of
mechanisms have been proposed, including phosphorylation at
residues Ser926 and Ser38927 as well as changes in localization—
i.e., physical sequestration of GSK3β in MVB25. Given that
Gimap5 expression is observed in lysosomes and MVB18, we first
tested whether vesicular sequestration of GSK3β is affected.
Specifically, we quantified vesicular GSK3β intensity, the number
of vesicles, and the size of GSK3β-associating vesicles in WT and
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells at 0, 6, and 24 h after CD4+ T cell
stimulation. Notably, GSK3β became associated with punctate
vesicles in WT cells and GSK3β intensity, vesicle number, and
vesicle size were markedly decreased in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+
T cells after 24-h stimulation (Fig. 3a), indicating that physical
segregation of GSK3β from cytosolic target proteins25,44,45 may
provide a mechanism of inhibition. Next, we sought to identify if
GSK3β+ vesicles associate with Gimap5 expression following CD4
+ T cell activation. Interestingly, ImageStream analysis of resting/
activated WT and Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells indeed showed
colocalization between Gimap5 and GSK3β in a subset of punc-
tate cytosolic vesicles of activated WT CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3b) with
~54% of Gimap5+ vesicles also positive for GSK3β. Given that
Gimap5 is expressed in lysosomes (Lamp1+), but also Lamp1neg
vesicles (Supplementary Figure 5B), we sought to further char-
acterize Gimap5/GSK3β double positive (DP) vesicles using var-
ious endosomal/lysosomal markers. Interestingly, our studies
showed limited association between Rab5, Rab7, or Lamp1
expression and Gimap5/GSK3β DP vesicles (Supplementary
Figure 5A–E). To confirm colocalized expression of Gimap5 and
GSK3β in vesicles, we examined WT and Gimap5sph/sph CD4+
T cells by high-resolution, three-dimensional confocal micro-
scopy, enabling us to visualize Gimap5-GSK3β colocalization in
the axial as well as xy planes. Consistent with the ImageStream
analysis, GSK3β colocalized with Gimap5 in stimulated WT CD4
+ T cells in punctate vesicles (Fig. 3c).
GSK3β
vesicular
sequestration
has
predominantly
been
described in the context of Wnt signaling25. To test the potential
involvement of Wnt signaling, we incubated WT CD4+ T cells
either directly with Wnt3a or examined blocking of Wnt
secretion by incubating activated CD4+ T cells in the presence/
absence of IWP-2 (a Wnt secretion inhibitor46,47). Subsequently,
we
assessed
GSK3β
sequestration
using
ImageStream
and
determined the proliferation capacity of WT CD4+ T cells.
Neither Wnt3a nor IWP-2 affected the vesicular sequestration in
WT CD4+ T cells or impacted T cell proliferation (Supplementary
Figure 6A–D). Moreover, no significant differences in Wnt3A
mRNA expression were observed between WT and Gimap5sph/sph
CD4+ T cells at resting or activated conditions (Supplementary
Figure 6E). Together, our data indicate that following activation
of CD4+ T cells, GSK3β is sequestered in vesicles and that this
vesicular accumulation of GSK3β is markedly impaired in
Gimap5-deficient CD4+ T cells following activation.
Impaired GSK3β phosphorylation and increased DNA damage.
Phosphorylation at residues Ser926 and Ser38927 has been pro-
posed as a mechanism of GSK3β inhibition. Phosphorylation of
GSK3β at Ser9 is mediated by AKT (and possibly other kinases)
following TCR signaling48, while inhibition of GSK3β by phos-
phorylation of Ser389 is linked with lymphocyte fitness in the
context of DNA DSB evident either during V(D)J recombination
in thymic T cells or in B cells undergoing immunoglobulin CSR27.
Furthermore, reports have shown that pharmacological inhibition
and shRNA knockdown of GSK3β promote the repair of DSB,
suggesting a role for GSK3β inhibition during the DNA damage
response28. We thus next considered that GSK3β inhibition by
phosphorylation—i.e., P-Ser9 or P-Ser389—during T cell acti-
vation was impaired in mutant cells. Interestingly, analysis of
αCD3/αCD28-stimulated WT and Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells
showed normal phosphorylation of Ser9 within the first 30 min
(Supplementary Figure 7A,D), 24 h (Supplementary Figure 7A),
and after 2 days (Fig. 3d). In contrast, phosphorylation of GSK3β
at position Ser389 (primarily observed 2 days after T cell acti-
vation) was impaired in Gimap5sph/sph T cells (Fig. 3d). Phos-
phorylation of Ser389 is thought to be mediated by p38 MAPK27.
However, we observed no differences in the activation of p38
MAPK between WT and Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3d,
Supplementary Figures 7C and 3B). To further define whether the
reduced phosphorylation of GSK3β at position Ser389 was a
result of an overall reduction in GSK3β nuclear expression, we
performed ImageStream studies to define the level of both total
GSK3β and P-Ser389 GSK3β in the nucleus. Interestingly, both
total and phosphorylated GSK3β levels were markedly reduced in
the nucleus of activated Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells (day 2)
(Fig. 3e–i), while some P-Ser389 GSK3β could be observed in
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells predominantly in punctate vesicles
outside of the nucleus (Fig. 3e), revealing an impaired distribution
of P-Ser389 GSK3β in activated Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells.
Importantly, the reduction of P-Ser389 was associated with a
marked increase in DNA damage (γH2AX expression; Fig. 4a) in
Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells undergoing cell cycle, leading to
increased p53 expression and phosphorylation (Fig. 3d), and
ultimately reduced cell survival (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Figure 7G). Notably, Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells with DNA
damage (γH2AX+) were not actively undergoing apoptosis
(Supplementary
Figure
7E,F).
Importantly,
the
significant
increase in DNA damage observed in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+
T cells was reduced in the presence of GSK3 inhibitors (Fig. 4c,
d), confirming the critical function of GSK3 inactivation in

Pharmacological targeting of GSK3 prevents immune pathol-
ogy. We next tested the potential of GSK3 inhibitors to maintain
T cell survival and prevent colitis/liver pathology in vivo. We
treated WT and Gimap5sph/sph mice with LiCl (150 mg/kg in
drinking water, ad libitum) starting at 3 weeks of age until
8 weeks of age, by which time severe colitis can be observed. LiCl
treatment of Gimap5sph/sph mice effectively maintained the CD4+
T cell and B cell populations in Gimap5sph/sph mice (Fig. 5a, b),
while the proportion of CD4+ T cells displaying the memory-like
phenotype (CD44hi;CD62lo) was reduced compared to untreated
Gimap5sph/sph mice (Fig. 5c).
Notably, while the Treg cell frequency within the CD4+ T cell
population of Gimap5sph/sph mice is not affected (Supplementary
Figure 8C), their progressive loss of suppressive function is
thought to be a key factor in driving colitis in Gimap5sph/sph
mice5. We thus next asked if pharmacological inhibition of GSK3
could prevent this defect. Specifically, we purified regulatory
T cells from the spleens of vehicle- and LiCl-treated WT and
Gimap5sph/sph mice and cocultured them with αCD3-stimulated
WT CD8+ T cells. Strikingly, while Treg cells from vehicle-treated
Gimap5sph/sph mice were incapable of suppressing CD8+ T cell
proliferation in vitro, Treg cells from LiCl-treated Gimap5sph/sph
mice demonstrated normal suppressive capacity (Fig. 5d).
Importantly, LiCl treatment completely prevented colitis and
significantly reduced crypt loss and leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 5e,
f and Supplementary Figure 8A). Finally, LiCl treatment corrected
the regenerative liver phenotype with limited hemorrhage and
hematopoietic stem cell presence observed in the liver of LiCl-
treated Gimap5sph/sph mice (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig-
ure 8B). Overall, these data provide a causal link between GSK3
activity and reduced T cells and B cell survival in Gimap5sph/sph
mice and the development of regenerative liver disease and colitis.
Genetic targeting of GSK3β in CD4+ T cells prevents colitis.
While we observed comparable results in rescuing effects of loss
of Gimap5 with two mechanistically distinct inhibitors of GSK3,
each of these molecules has other effects on cellular processes and
proteins. GSK3 consists of two ubiquitously expressed paralogs,
GSK3α and GSK3β; to assess selectivity and importance of GSK3β
specifically in the CD4+ T cell-mediated pathology, we next
examined whether genetic ablation of GSK3β in CD4+ T cells was
sufficient to prevent loss of CD4+ T cells and immunopathology
in Gimap5sph/sph mice. To test this hypothesis, we generated WT-
or Gimap5sph/sph-; Cd4-cre/ert2; Gsk3bfl/fl mice49—allowing for
the conditional ablation of GSK3β specifically in CD4+ T cells
upon treatment with tamoxifen. WT and Gimap5sph/sph on a
Gsk3bfl/fl or Gsk3bWT/WT background were treated with tamox-
ifen starting at 3 weeks of age. At 8 weeks of age, mice were
characterized for CD4+ T cell survival and their phenotype.
Tamoxifen treatment resulted in an effective ablation of GSK3β
expression in CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Figure 9A) and
increased survival of CD4+ T (but not B) cells in the periphery
(Fig. 6a and Supplementary Figure 9B,C). Moreover, in the
absence of GSK3β, Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells maintained a
naïve phenotype comparable to WT peripheral CD4+ T cells
(Fig. 6b). Importantly, conditional deletion of Gsk3β in CD4+
T cells was sufficient to prevent the development of colitis
(Fig. 6c, d). In contrast, no effect on the liver damage with a
similar presence of hematopoietic foci observed in tamoxifen-
treated Gimap5sph/sph; Gsk3bfl/fl mice was observed (Supplemen-
tary Figure 9D). These findings confirm the critical function of
GSK3β expression/activity in CD4+ T cell survival and T cell-
mediated gut pathology in Gimap5sph/sph mice.
Human GIMAP5 LOF mutation results in T cell deficiencies.
During the course of our studies, we identified a 16-year-old
patient who was referred to our institution for the evaluation of
an immune deficiency. The patient presented with splenomegaly,
lymphopenia with low CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as NK
cells, and was found to have decreased frequency of naive CD4+
T cells and increased CD4+ T-effector memory cells (see Sup-
plementary Note 1 for patient description). Using whole-exome
sequencing, the patient was found to be homozygous for a rare
non-synonymous SNP (rs72650695, position 7:150742750) in the
coding region of GIMAP5 causing a Leu → Pro amino acid change

 at residue 204 (Fig. 7a). Immunoblot analysis showed that the
missense mutation resulted in undetectable protein expression of
both GIMAP5 isoforms. (Fig. 7a). The rs72650695 SNP is a rare
variant (minor allele frequency ~0.002076 in ExAC database) and
both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers. Given that
the lymphopenia and overall clinical profile were strikingly
similar to Gimap5-deficient mice, and no other mutations in
candidate genes were identified, we considered that the immune
deficiency was caused by a LOF mutation in GIMAP5.
To define the T cell deficiency in the GIMAP5−/− patient, we
compared T cell proliferation from the patient with his
heterozygous mother. Similar to CD4+ T cell proliferation in
Gimap5-deficient mice, a marked reduction in T cell proliferation
was observed that could be rescued in the presence of LiCl
(Fig. 7b). After expansion of T cells in vitro using phytohemag-
glutinin (PHA) followed by incubation with IL-2, rested T cells
were examined for c-Myc expression. Immunoblot analysis
showed a marked reduction of c-Myc levels in both resting
(Fig. 7c) and αCD3/αCD28 re-stimulated patient cells as
compared to the heterozygous mother (Fig. 7d). Importantly,
similar to T cell proliferation, c-Myc levels could be restored upon
treatment of cells with LiCl, suggesting that in human GIMAP5
−/− T cells, GSK3 inhibitors offer therapeutic potential to correct
the immunodeficiency and prevent immune pathology.
We next assessed colocalization of GIMAP5 and GSK3β in
healthy control cells activated with αCD3/αCD28. Similar to
previous studies, ImageStream analysis of primary CD4+ T cells
from healthy individuals showed that GIMAP5 was selectively
expressed in vesicles, including but not limited to lysosomal
vesicles (Fig. 8a, b). Moreover, we observed colocalization
between GIMAP5 and GSK3β that was significantly increased
1–2 days after CD4+ T cell activation with ~66% of GIMAP5+
spots in CD4+ T cells positive for GSK3β (Fig. 8a, c, d). Similar to
murine CD4+ T cells, accumulation of GSK3β was predominantly
observed in GIMAP5+ vesicles that were CD107 negative (Fig. 8c,
d). Furthermore, vesicular association of GSK3β in GIMAP5−/−
CD4+ T cells restimulated with αCD3/αCD28 after expansion was
markedly reduced as determined by number of GSK3β spots,
GSK3β spot size, and overall GSK3β intensity within spots
(Fig. 8e–h). Notably, overall GSK3β expression and vesicular
localization was also enhanced in CD4+ T cells that had first been
expanded compared to primary CD4+ T cells both before and
after αCD3/αCD28 stimulation (Fig. 8a, g, and h). We next
determined whether the activation of GIMAP5−/− CD4+ T cells

 was associated with increased DNA damage, by comparing the
level of γH2AX in CD4+ T cells from control and patient cells.
After 2 days of re-stimulation with αCD3/αCD28, a significant
increase in intensity of γH2AX was observed in patient CD4+
T cells compared to control T cells upon activation (Fig. 8i, j).
Together these data reveal a striking similarity between the
molecular pathways in mouse and human T cells that are affected
by loss of GIMAP5 function.
Discussion
Here, we report a critical role for Gimap5 in inactivating GSK3β
during CD4+ T cell activation that affects two key regulatory
events required for T cell proliferation. In the absence of Gimap5,
impaired inactivation of GSK3β through a reduced vesicular
association results in a failure to accumulate or induce nuclear
translocation of TFs necessary for productive T cell proliferation
(Fig. 9). Moreover, when T cells are cycling (i.e., at day2), we
observed an impaired nuclear accumulation of P-Ser389 GSK3β
that was associated with increased DNA damage and a reduced
lymphocyte fitness. Importantly, we show that pharmacological
targeting of GSK3 or genetic deletion of Gsk3b corrects T lym-
phocyte survival and prevents severe early-onset colitis in
Gimap5-deficient mice. Moreover, we describe a human patient
with a GIMAP5 LOF mutation. The patient presents with an
immunodeficiency strikingly similar to Gimap5-deficient mice,
including the development of lymphopenia, reduction in TFs
such as c-Myc, as well as increased DNA damage and reduced
survival upon T cell activation. Notably, GSK3 inhibitors can
restore accumulation of c-Myc protein and improve T cell sur-
vival during activation in vitro.
GSK3β is constitutive active kinase in resting T cells and has a
large number of reported targets (>100) that include important
signaling components and TFs important for growth and suvi-
val50. These include but are not limited to c-Myc, β-catenin, and
NFATc1—key TFs required for growth and activation of the
transcriptional program in T cells34,51,52. In addition, our studies
identify an important function for GSK3β in limiting DNA
damage during CD4+ T cell proliferation. The latter could very
well be mediated by direct effect of GSK3β on components such
as p53, Mcl-1, but also Mdm2, a GSK3β target that is an
important negative regulator of p5353. We tested the contribution
of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1 as one potentially important
survival factor, but our studies showed little rescue of CD4+
T cells in Bax/Bak-deficient mice, suggesting that a combination
of pathways are likely underlying the failure of CD4+ T cells to
survive and undergo proliferation. Thus, the relative contribution
of these GSK3β targets in the overall Gimap5 phenotype is cur-
rently unclear and will be an important, but challenging question
to address.
Until recently, AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the N-
terminal tail of GSK3β was believed to be the primary mechan-
ism of its inhibition. However, the generation of phospho-
insensitive forms of GSK3 (GSK3αS21A/GSK3βS9A) and the
characterization of GSK3β’s active site have clearly demonstrated
that GSK3 N-terminal phosphorylation neither completely inhi-
bits activity nor is involved in every GSK3 signaling axis44,54–56.
More recently, phosphorylation of the Ser389 site in GSK3β has

 been implicated as a key step in GSK3β inactivation and main-
taining lymphocyte fitness during the DNA damage response to
DSB27. Reports by Yang et al. indicate that reduction of GSK3β
activity through inhibition or knockdown limits the accumulation
of these DSB28. Other reports link GSK3 inhibition to increased
cell survival upon induction of DNA damage by preventing its
action on p53; active GSK3β binds to and promotes the actions of
p5357–59. In addition, evidence suggests that the GSK3-mediated
regulation of the transcriptional program (e.g. c-Myc, NFATc1)
contributes to the optimal DNA repair response. For instance,
consistent with our observations, inhibition of NFAT nuclear
translocation impairs DNA repair upon UV irradiation60,61.
Moreover, the report by Thornton et al. demonstrates the
importance of phosphorylation of GSK3β at position Ser389 by
using Ser389Ala knockin mice that have a reduced fitness of
T cells and B cells undergoing V(D)J recombination and per-
ipheral B cells undergoing activation27. However, P-Ser389 of
GSK3β can also readily be observed following γ-radiation or upon
treatment with doxorubicin27,28, suggesting a broader context for
this mechanism of GSK3β inactivation in limiting DNA damage.
While the study by Thornton et al. suggests limited P-Ser389 after
18 h of stimulation in peripheral CD4+ T cells27, our studies show
significant Ser389 phosphorylation at 48 h during the peak of the
proliferation-associated DNA damage response in WT CD4+
T cells—phosphorylation that is notably reduced in Gimap5-
deficient T cells. Currently, it is unclear why Gimap5-deficient
CD4+ T cells fail to phosphorylate Ser389—a process thought to
involve activation of Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and
phosphorylation by p38. Our data suggest phosphorylation of p38
is unaffected in Gimap5-deficient T cells, indicating that an
alternative pathway is involved. Notably, at 24 h of activation, we
did observe a marked decrease in the association of GSK3β with
cytosolic vesicles—a mechanism proposed for GSK3 inhibition
through the Wnt signaling pathway. This was followed by an
overall reduced P-Ser389 and nuclear translocation of GSK3β,
while remnant P-Ser389 GSK3β could be observed in punctate
vesicles outside of the nucleus of Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells after
2 days stimulation. These observations suggest that Gimap5
facilitates the subcellular localization of GSK3β and imply that the
nuclear translocation of GSK3β is required for a productive T cell
response.
While dysregulation of GSK3 may be the most striking phe-
notype observed in the absence of Gimap5, it may not be the only
effect of Gimap5 deficiency. Crystallographic studies revealed that
Gimap proteins manifest a nucleotide coordination and dimer-
ization mode similar to dynamin GTPase—a component essential
for the scission and fusion of cellular vesicular compartments
such as endosomes62. Thus, Gimap5’s homology to dynamin
raises the possibility that it may be more broadly involved in
vesicular transport, rather than restricted solely to the seques-
tration of GSK3β. Interestingly, while Gimap5 is expressed in
lysosomes and MVB, our data demonstrates that the increased
vesicular association of GSK3β following T cell activation occurs
predominantly in Lamp1/CD107 negative vesicles, suggesting
lysosomal-independent functions for Gimap5.
A study suggested that Gimap5 can interact with Bcl2 family
members to regulate apoptotic pathways15; however, our studies
show that the loss of CD4+ T cells could not be rescued when
Gimap5sph/sph mice were crossed to the apoptosis-resistant Bim-
deficient or Bax/Bak-deficient backgrounds. Nonetheless, the Bcl2
family member Mcl-1 is targeted for degradation by GSK3-
mediated phosphorylation, allowing the release of pro-apoptotic
binding partners. A study by Chen et al. suggested that loss of
Gimap5 was associated with enhanced Mcl-1 degradation in
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) ultimately leading to compro-
mised mitochondrial integrity and an overall reduced survival of
HSC7. We observe a similar reduction in Mcl-1 levels in stimu-
lated CD4+ T cells, although the in vivo relevancy is unclear. This
reduction is consistent with impaired GSK3 inhibition, providing
an explanation for the increased Mcl-1 degradation. Moreover,
our data indicate that treatment of Gimap5sph/sph mice with GSK3
inhibitors in vivo prevents/corrects the development of hemato-
poietic foci in the liver. This correction was not observed when
GSK3β was genetically ablated in CD4+ T cells, potentially indi-
cating that HSC were directly targeted by LiCl treatment. This is
consistent with the observation that the liver phenotype still
develops in Gimap5sph/sph mice on a Rag-deficient background,
which lacks CD4+ T cells8.
It is feasible that GSK3 dysregulation has more subtle effects
than activation-induced T cell death. We have previously shown
that a subset of highly pathogenic memory-like CD4+ T cells
survives and drive colitis in the Gimap5sph/sph mouse. These
remaining cells have a limited capacity to proliferate but robustly
produce IFNγ and IL-17a. The accumulation of these cells and
concurrent loss in number and function of regulatory T cells in
Gimap5-deficient models results in an imbalance between Th17
and Treg cells that promotes the development of autoimmune
conditions, including severe colitis (mice), aggravated EAE (LEW
rats), and T1D (BB rats)5,6,10,11,13. Although the roles of Wnt
signaling, GSK3, and β-catenin in CD4+ T cell polarization and
activity are controversial19,20,63–67, dysregulation of GSK3 activity
in CD4+ T cells has been linked with skewing toward pathogenic

 Th17 cells. Studies by Beurel et al. have shown that upregulation
of GSK3 promotes Th17 polarization, while its inhibition blocks
this process20. In contrast, inhibition of GSK3 activity potentiates
the polarization and suppressive capacity of Treg cells63,66,68. This
provides a potential mechanism as to why Gimap5sph/sph Treg
cells have a reduced suppressive capacity that can be restored by
long-term LiCl treatment.
We show that a dysregulation of GSK3 in lymphocytes can lead
to a primary immune deficiency, as observed in Gimap5sph/sph
mice and the GIMAP5 LOF patient. Given its importance in
maintaining CD4+ T cell homeostasis and differentiation, we
propose that even a minor dysregulation of GSK3 within the T
cell compartment could result in abnormal polarization of CD4+
T cells, leading to preferential differentiation of Th17 cells over
regulatory T cells. Such a dysregulation may be occurring in
autoimmune diseases associated with pathogenic Th17 cells, such
as Crohn’s disease, T1D, and multiple sclerosis69–71, or in
Gimap5-associated diseases such as SLE, T1D, and allergic
asthma1–4. In this case, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity offers
a new promising therapeutic approach for treating patients with
immunopathogenic T cell responses.
T cells depend on their ability to undergo clonal expansion for
an efficient immune response during infection or to maintain
immune homeostasis in the gut. Our studies reveal a key role for
Gimap5 in inactivating GSK3β during CD4+ T cell activation, a
link that is critically required to maintain T cell fitness and allows
for productive T cell proliferation. We propose that the Gimap5-
mediated inactivation of GSK3β is an essential molecular
mechanism to support productive CD4+ T cell responses.
Moreover, our studies point to a remarkable therapeutic potential

 for GSK3 inhibitors to improve CD4+ T cell survival/proliferation
and prevent immunopathology. Thus far, GSK3 inhibitors have
been used to treat a variety of diseases including Alzheimer’s
disease, mood disorders, cancer, and diabetes mellitus (for
extensive reviews see72,73). Our current data reveal a new ther-
apeutic application of GSK3 inhibitors specifically in the treat-
ment of immunodeficient patients that have GIMAP5 LOF
mutations. These patients present a strikingly similar phenotype
to Gimap5-deficient mice and suffer from recurrent (viral)
infections most likely stemming from an overall lack of T cell
fitness. We posit that GSK3-inhibitors will improve overall T cell
survival
and
function
and
may
prevent/correct
immune-
associated sequelae observed in these patients. In addition, ther-
apeutic targeting of this pathway may be relevant for the treat-
ment of patients with SNPs in GIMAP5 linked to development of
islet autoimmunity in T1D, SLE1–3, or asthma4.
Methods
Study design. For the proposed experiments involving the studies of immune
responses in vivo, both male and female mice were used. All strains of mice used
were generated on a C57BL/6J background and confirmed by whole-genome SNP
analysis and we anticipated limited genetic variation. To minimize confounding
secondary factors arising from lymphopenia and other late-stage pathologies that
develop in Gimap5sph/sph mice, CD4+ T cells from 3-week-old mice were used
unless otherwise noted. At this age, Gimap5sph/sph mice have relatively normal
numbers of CD4+ T cells with a normal frequency of naïve T cells that have a
quiescent phenotype comparable to WT mice. Since we were interested in T cell
proliferation/survival in WT vs. Gimap5-deficient cells, we expected to find strong
differences in measurement (e.g., normal vs. absence of T cell survival/prolifera-
tion). In cases where the differences in the observed phenomena were clear and
distinct, a group size of 6 mice was suitable to give statistically significant (i.e., P <
0.05) data. For these studies, we estimated that, with a sample size of 6, we have a
99% power to detect at least 25% reduction in the percentage of proliferating cells
in stimulated Gimap5sph/sph cells with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-
tailed).
Mice and reagents. All experiments were performed according to the US National
Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the IACUC of The Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital. C57BL/6 J mice were obtained from Jackson. Gimap5sph/sph
mice were generated as described6 and bred in-house to generate WT or
Gimap5sph/sph;Rag2−/−;OT-II, WT or Gimap5sph/sph;Tg (Cd4-cre/ert2) 11Gnri/J;
Gsk3bfl/fl mice in the vivarium of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. All mice were
maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Purified α-mouse-CD3 (17A2)
and α-mouse-CD28 (37.51) antibodies (Biolegend) were used for murine T cell
activation. For human T cell studies, purified αCD3 (OKT3) and αCD28 (CD28.2)
antibodies (Biolegend) were used. 7-AAD was purchased from BD. Ovalbumin,
LiCl, BIO, ionomycin, and phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L) were obtained from
Sigma. Monoclonal antibody MAC421 was used as probe for Gimap5 as descri-
bed6. GSK3β was probed with monoclonal antibody Clone 7/GSK-3b from BD.
Information on all antibodies used can be found in Supplementary Table 1.
T cell analyses. To characterize lymphocyte populations ex vivo, lymphocytes
from spleen and mesenteric lymph node (mLN) were isolated and stained with
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for mouse CD4, CD8, CD19, B220, CD25,
CD44, CD62L, and Foxp3. In all experiments, samples were stained with a fixable
viability dye; analysis was restricted to live cells unless otherwise stated.
For all in vitro murine CD4+ T cell experiments, unless otherwise noted, Mojo-
purified (Biolegend) CD4+ T cells were stimulated with plate-bound αCD3 (1 μg/
mL) + soluble αCD28 (2 μg/mL). Cells were cultured in supplemented IMDM
medium containing 10% FBS, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and
50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (BME). T cell proliferation was quantified by incubating
CD4+ T cells in 5 μM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) in 0.2% FBS for
5 min. Cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated in the presence of GSK3
inhibitors LiCl (2.5 mM) or BIO (100 nM). After 3 days incubation, proliferation
was evaluated by analyzing CFSE dilution by flow cytometry. In indicated
experiments, 200 ng/mL Wnt3a, 2 µM IWP-2, or 200 ng/mL Cyclosporin A (CsA)
were added. DNA damage was evaluated by γH2AX staining in conjunction with 7-
AAD staining for cell cycle analysis. Early phosphorylation of GSK3β (S9), Akt
(S473), and p38 (T180/Y182) was evaluated by stimulating rested CD4+ T cells
with αCD3 (5 μg/mL)/αCD28 (2 μg/mL) for the indicated time point before
staining for flow cytometry. Early phosphorylation of AKT, p38, ERK, and JNK,
and the degradation of IκB was also evaluated in CD4+ T cells upon stimulation
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/mL) and ionomycin (750 ng/
mL). Ex vivo survival of CD4+ T cells was evaluated by culturing Mojo-purified
peripheral CD4+ T cells or total thymocytes with 5 ng/mL IL-7 for 0–7 days. The
number of surviving cells was determined by staining for CD4 and viability and
counted on a flow cytometer using counting beads (Biolegend).
Immunoblotting. Protein lysates from human T cells were prepared according to
standard methods from resting cells or cells stimulated with 5 µg/mL αCD3 + 2 µg/
mL αCD28 ± 5 mM LiCl for 24 h. For mouse experiments, Mojo-isolated (Bio-
Legend) CD4+ T cells were stimulated with αCD3 and αCD28 ± 2.5 mM LiCl for
the indicated time periods prior to preparing protein lysates. In indicated experi-
ments, 10 μM of proteasomal inhibitor MG132 was added 4 h prior to lysis of the
cells. Lysates were separated using 10% Bis-Tris Gels, transferred to nitrocellulose,
and immunoblotted with primary antibodies to GIMAP5, phospho-c-Myc (T58),
c-Myc, pGSK3β (S389), pGSK3β (S9), total GSK3β, phospho-p53 (S15), total p53,

AMNIS ImageStream flow cytometry. For mouse localization studies, CD4+
T cells were stimulated with αCD3 + αCD28. After 6, 24, or 48 h CD4+ T cells were
stained with antibodies to CD4 (GK1.5), Gimap5 (MAC421), GSK3β (BD 610202),
pGSK3β (S389) (EMD Millipore 07–2275), DAPI, and a fixable viability dye. In
indicated experiments, 200 ng/mL Wnt3a and 2 µM IWP-2 were added. For
NFATc1 localizations studies, isolated CD4+ T cells were stimulated indicated
times. Cells were stained with antibodies for CD4 and NFATc1 (clone 7A6), DAPI,
and a fixable viability dye. Live CD4+ T cells were analyzed for NFATc1 and DAPI
localization by delineating regions of positive signal (i.e., a mask). Nuclear trans-
location was measured by similarity dilate, which represents the log transformed
Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient and is a measure of the degree to which two
images are linearly correlated within a masked region. In human GIMAP5-
localization studies, CD4+ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors by MACS-purification (Miltenyi Biotec)
and stimulated with αCD3 (5 µg/mL) and αCD28 (2 µg/mL). After 24 and 48 h,
T cells were stained with antibodies to CD4, GIMAP5 (CST 14108), GSK3β (BD
610202), CD107b (Miltenyi Biotec), and a fixable viability dye. GSK3β vesicular
localization in patient and control CD4+ T cells was measured upon restimulation
of resting T cells after IL-2 expansion. Colocalization, vesicular localization, and
nuclear localization was evaluated using ImageStream Data Exploration and
Analysis Software (IDEAS) 6.1 as described in detail74. Specifically, colocalization
was quantified using the Bright Detail Similarity representing the log transformed
Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the localized bright spots with a radius of 3
pixels or less within the masked area in the two input images.
Confocal microscopy. To visualize the localization of GSK3β and Gimap5 at a
higher resolution, CD4+ T cells isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of WT
and Gimap5sph/sph mice were stimulated with αCD3/αCD28. After 24 h, cells were
stained with antibodies for Gimap5 (MAC421) and GSK3β (BD61202). Cells were
counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/mL) and mounted in Prolong Gold anti-fade
reagent (Cell Signaling Technology). Samples were imaged on a Nikon A1 LUN-V
inverted microscope using a 100× objective with oil immersion. For each imaged
cell, Z-stacks were generated by taking images at a 0.125 μm step. To refine loca-
lization, images were deconvolved using the Landweber algorithm (15 iterations) in
NIS Elements v4.5 (Nikon). Z-stacks were assembled and GSK3β and Gimap5
localization assessed in Imaris Image Analysis software v8.3 (Bitplane).
Calcium flux. Splenocytes isolated from individual WT or Gimap5sph/sph mice were
stained with Indo-1 (2 µg/mL) at 1 × 106 cells/mL for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were
then stained for CD4 and rested for ≥1 h in cell loading medium (HBSS + 1 µM
CaCl2 + 1 µM MgCl2 + 1% FBS) at room temperature. Five minutes prior to ana-
lysis, cells were warmed to 37 °C. To evaluate calcium flux, samples were acquired
for ~30 s without stimulation and an additional 270 s after stimulation with αCD3/
αCD28 (1.25 µg/mL) or ionomycin (800 ng/mL) for a total of 5 min.
Real-time PCR. Mojo-purified (Biolegend) CD4+ T cells were rested or stimulated
with αCD3/αCD28 for 24 h. Cells were lysed with TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Sci),
mRNA isolated, and reverse transcription performed using a High-capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNAs were amplified with
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) and quantified by Light-Cycler 480-
II instrument (Roche). The following primer pairs were used: myc, forward: 5′-
ATGCCCCTCAACGTGAACTTC-3’, reverse: 5′-GTCGCAGATGAAA-
TAGGGCTG-3′; wnt3a, forward: 5′-CTCCTCTCGGATACCTCTTAGTG-3′,

GGATCTGGCCCTTGAACCTT-3′. Expression of myc, wnt3a, and ctnnb1 was
normalized to L32 and set relative to unstimulated WT samples.
In vivo OVA administration. The role of TCR signaling in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T
cell survival in vivo was evaluated by crossing Gimap5sph/sph mice with Rag2−/−;
OT-II mice. OVA (1 mg/mL) was administered to 10-week-old mice in drinking
water ad libitum. After 5 weeks, T cell survival and Treg cell-induction were
evaluated by flow cytometry.
In vivo lithium treatment. To evaluate if in vivo inhibition of GSK3 activity could
prevent the development of Gimap5sph/sph-associated pathologies, 3-week-old mice
were administered 150 mg/kg LiCl in drinking water. After 4–5 weeks, liver
damage, colitis, and lymphocyte populations were evaluated by histology and flow
cytometry, respectively. Animals were assigned to treatment and vehicle groups
randomly, with equal numbers of male and female mice assigned to each group.
For these experiments, WT and Gimap5sph/sph genotypes were cohoused during
treatment. Investigators were blinded to mouse genotype and treatment status
during analysis.
Genetic deletion of GSK3β. GSK3β hyperactivation in Gimap5sph/sph CD4+ T cells
was evaluated by crossing Gimap5sph/sph; Gsk3bfl/fl mice to Cd4cre-ert2 mice,
allowing for the tamoxifen-inducible genetic deletion of Gsk3b in CD4+ T cells.
Tamoxifen was administered in food to 3-week-old mice (40 mg/kg body weight;
Harlan Laboratories Teklad Diets). At 8 weeks, liver damage, colitis, and lym-
phocyte populations were evaluated by histology and flow cytometry, respectively.
Histology. Colon tissue was collected and immediately fixed in 10% buffered
formalin solution overnight, followed by routine paraffin embedding. Hematoxylin
and eosin staining were performed on 4 µm sections from the paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks for conventional light microscopy analysis. Histological scoring was
performed double-blind as described before5,6,. Briefly, scoring parameters inclu-
ded quantitation of the area of distal colon involved, edema, erosion/ulceration of
the epithelial monolayer, crypt loss/damage, and infiltration of immune cells into
the mucosa. Severity for the area involved (erosion/ulceration and crypt loss) was
graded on a scale from 0 (normal), 1 (0–10%), 2 (10–25%), 3 (25–50%), and 4
(>50%). Immune cell infiltration was scored as 0, absent; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and
3, severe. Total disease score was expressed as the mean of all combined scores per
genotype.
In vitro regulatory T cell suppression assay. Treg cell suppression assays were
performed as described using Treg cells isolated from the spleens of WT and
Gimap5sph/sph mice treated with either LiCl or vehicle5. In brief, CD4+ T cells were
enriched by magnetic separation (Mojo, Biolegend) and stained for viability, CD4,
and CD25. Live CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were isolated by FACS using a
Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP cell sorter. Sorted Treg cells were cocultured with
the indicated ratios with 5 × 104 CTV-labeled CD8+ T cells isolated from a naïve
mouse. An additional 1 × 105 T cell depleted, gamma-irradiated (1500 rad) sple-
nocytes were also cocultured as bystander cells. CD8+ T cells were stimulated with
0.5 μg/mL αCD3; proliferation was assessed by CTV dilution after 3 days of
coculture.
Expansion of human T cells. For all studies concerning human cells, informed
consent was obtained and studies were approved by the CCHMC institutional IRB.
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of a GIMAP5-deficient patient and a
healthy parent by Ficoll-Paque Plus density gradient centrifugation. Isolated
PBMCs were cultured in RPMI, 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL strep-
tomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 mM HEPES and were stimulated with 5 µg/
mL PHA-L ± 5 mM LiCl. After 4 days, T cells were selectively expanded in 150 U/
mL rhIL-2 (Miltenyi) ± 5 mM LiCl for 8 days. Expanded T cells were rested for
2 days in the absence of IL-2 and LiCl before use in reactivation experiments. Prior
to expansion, patient’s PBMCs were stained for CD3, CD4, and CD8 and analyzed
by flow cytometry for evaluation of circulating lymphocyte populations.
Analysis of DNA damage response in human CD4+ T cells. Rested patient
T cells were restimulated with 5 µg/mL αCD3 and 2 µg/mL αCD28. After 24, 48,
and 72 h stimulation, cells were stained for viability, CD3, CD4, CD8, and γH2AX
and analyzed by flow cytometry. At 24 and 48 h, cells were stained with α-CD4, α-
γH2AX, DRAQ5, and a fixable viability dye. Analysis was performed on live CD4+
T cells using ImageStream flow cytometry as detailed above.
Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism4® software
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For studies comparing T cells from C57BL/
6 J, Gimap5sph/sph; and/or Gsk3bflox/flox mice or involving chemical treatment of
T cells, Student’s two-tailed test or ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple com-
parisons test for three or more groups were used. Data were considered statistically
significant if P values were <0.05. Data were normally distributed.
Data availability. The data that support the findings of this study are available
from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
