 Design—Prospective cohort study.
Participants—22,068 predominantly white individuals born to 15,271 women and followed 
from age 9–14 through age 20–28 years.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Risk of obesity based on IOTF or WHO cutoffs, depending 
on age. Secondary outcomes included risks of obesity associated with changes in mode of 
delivery, and differences in risk between birth-mode discordant siblings.
Results—4,921 individuals (22%) were born by cesarean section. The cumulative risk of obesity 
through the end of follow-up was 13% among all participants. The adjusted RR (95% CI) for 
obesity comparing cesarean to vaginal birth was 1.15 (1.06, 1.26). This association was stronger 
among women without known indications for Cesarean section (RR=1.30 (95% CI 1.09, 1.54)). 
Vaginal birth after cesarean was related to a 31% (95% CI: 17%, 47%) lower risk of offspring 
obesity compared to repeat cesarean section. In within-family analysis, individuals born by 
cesarean had a 64% (8%, 148%) higher odds of obesity than their siblings born vaginally.
Conclusions and Relevance—Cesarean birth was associated with offspring obesity after 
accounting for major confounding factors. While additional research is needed to clarify the 
mechanisms underlying this relation, clinicians and patients should weigh this risk when 
considering cesarean sections in the absence of a clear indication.

INTRODUCTION
Nearly 1.3 million cesarean sections are performed yearly in the United States, making it the 
most common surgical procedure1 and accounting for one third of deliveries nationwide.2 
When indicated, cesarean sections reduce morbidity risk to mother and fetus and, in many 
cases, are a life-saving intervention.3 Nevertheless, they have risks. Women undergoing a 
low-risk planned cesarean experience a 3-fold greater risk of major morbidity – including a 
5-fold greater risk of cardiac arrest, a 3-fold greater risk of hysterectomy and puerperal 
infection and a 2-fold greater risk of thromboembolism – compared with women who have 
low-risk planned vaginal deliveries.4 Cesarean delivery is also related to an increased risk of 
maternal mortality.5 The most salient immediate risk to children is a higher frequency of 
respiratory complications.6,7 In addition, there is increasing evidence suggesting that 
children born by cesarean experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes later in life.
8–10 With these concerns in mind, leading professional organizations have advocated for the 
prevention of primary cesarean delivery as a strategy to reduce the overall frequency of 
cesarean delivery.11
A growing literature suggests that cesarean section is related to a higher risk of offspring 
overweight and obesity. Two meta-analyses have reported pooled odds ratios (95% CI) of 
1.22 (1.05, 1.42) for offspring obesity12 associated with C-section. However, inference from 
most of the existing studies has been hampered by limited sample size,13 suboptimal control 
for shared risk factors (e.g. pre-pregnancy BMI and common pregnancy

 complications)12,14,15 or both16. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the relation between 
mode of birth (Cesarean vs. vaginal) and offspring obesity is real or indicative of residual 
confounding. To overcome these limitations, we investigated the relation between cesarean 
section and offspring risk of obesity among participants of the Growing Up Today Study 
(GUTS), a large prospective cohort of individuals followed from childhood through early 
adulthood.
METHODS
GUTS is an ongoing prospective cohort study of young adults followed since 1996. A total 
of 16,882 children aged 9 to 14 years responded to the baseline questionnaire, and an 
additional 10,923 children aged 9 to 14 enrolled in 2004. Participants have been followed 
with yearly self-administered follow-up questionnaires between 1997 and 2001 and with 
biennial questionnaires thereafter17,18. Study details have been described previously.19,20 
From the 23,655 GUTS participants for whom complete data on their mothers’ pregnancies 
were available, we excluded those for whom height and weight information was missing 
(n=221) and those who were not born of a singleton pregnancy (n=1,366). The final study 
included 22,068 individuals born to 15,271 women with follow up through 2011. The study 
was approved by the Human Subjects Committees of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of 
Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
In each follow-up questionnaire, participants reported their height and weight, which are 
validly reported by preadolescents21, adolescents22–24 and adults25,26, although there is 
potential misclassification of obesity based on self-reported anthropometry. Body mass 
index (BMI) was calculated from these data as weight in kilograms divided by height in 
meters squared. For individuals under 18 years of age, we defined obesity according to age- 
and sex-specific cutoffs proposed by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF, which 
provides continuity in BMI cutoffs used to define of overweight and obesity in children and 
in adults).27 For individuals older than 18 years, we defined obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) using 
World Health Organization cutoffs.28,29 Once an individual was classified as obese, they 
were considered obese for the reminder of follow-up.
Mode of delivery (cesarean vs. vaginal) was reported by the participants’ mothers in 2009 
using a questionnaire aimed at collecting lifetime pregnancy information.30 A validation 
study conducted among 154 women enrolled in NHS and the Collaborative Perinatal Project 
found perfect maternal recall of cesarean section at an average of 32 years after delivery.31 
The same validation study also showed that long-term maternal recall of many pregnancy 
related events, including diagnosis of major pregnancy complications (hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, placental abruption and placenta previa), 
offspring birth weight, gestational age at delivery, and pregnancy multiplicity, were highly 
reproducible and specific.31
Information on covariates of interest in GUTS was prospectively collected from the GUTS 
participants’ mothers as part of their participation in NHS-II (maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, 
pre-pregnancy smoking, race/ethnicity, region of residence at delivery) and in the GUTS 
baseline and follow-up questionnaires (participant birth date, sex, breastfeeding duration).

 Maternal age at delivery was calculated as the difference, in years, between participants’ 
date of birth and the mothers’ date of birth.
Age-standardized pre-pregnancy and pregnancy characteristics were calculated for all 
participants and according to delivery mode. To evaluate the association between cesarean 
section and offspring obesity, we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) using log-binomial regression models with generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) to adjust for potential confounders while accounting for correlations in outcomes 
between siblings. We obtained crude and multivariable-adjusted estimates of this relation. 
The multivariable adjusted models included terms for maternal age at delivery (continuous), 
race (white, other), region (Northeast, Midwest, West, South), year of birth (<=1984, 1985–
89, >1989), pre-pregnancy BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24.99, 25–29.99, 30+ kg/m2), maternal height 
(continuous), gestational diabetes (yes, no), pre-eclampsia (yes, no), pregnancy induced 
hypertension (yes, no), gestational age at delivery (<37, 37–39, 40–42, 43+ weeks), birth 
weight group (<5, 5–6.9, 7–8.4,8.5–9.9, 10+ lbs), pre-pregnancy smoking (never, past, 
current), previous Cesarean section (yes, no), offspring sex (boy, girl) and birth order 
(continuous). Missing categories were created for variables with missing value. We also 
fitted marginal structural models where the probability of undergoing a Cesarean section 
was predicted for each woman based on these same factors and subsequently used to weight 
each observation using stabilized weights.32,33 In addition, we fitted sex-stratified and age-
stratified models and assessed the significance of heterogeneity by adding cross-product 
terms between mode of delivery and age at BMI report or sex to the main multivariable 
model. We also performed additional analyses treating BMI at each follow-up period as a 
continuous or binary outcome (obesity yes/no), to avoid problems related to change in 
classification over time while still capturing changes within individuals over time. While 
some lifestyle and behavioral factors during childhood are risk factors for obesity, we did not 
consider them as confounders because none precede both exposure and outcome and 
therefore cannot, by definition, confound the association between cesarean section and 
offspring obesity. In fact, it has been shown that inclusion of this type of covariates does not 
improve precision when the outcome is binary and may instead introduce bias. 34,35
To address the possibility of residual confounding, we conducted a series of alternate 
analyses. We first restricted the analysis to participants without known risk factors for 
Cesarean section (maternal pre-pregnancy BMI<25kg/m2, no gestational diabetes, no 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, never smoker, maternal age <30 years old, gestational 
age at delivery between 37 and 42 weeks, and birth weight between 5 and 9.9 lbs). We also 
evaluated adjusting for maternal BMI as a continuous variable allowing for non-linear 
relations. We then estimated the effect of change in delivery mode on offspring obesity using 
data from successive pregnancies of the same woman. Specifically, we estimated the effect 
on offspring obesity of vaginal birth among women with a previous cesarean delivery 
(vaginal birth after cesarean; VBAC) relative to women with repeated cesarean deliveries, as 
well as the effect of cesarean delivery among women with a previous vaginal delivery reltive 
to a repeated vaginal delivery. Lastly, to minimize the effect of post-natal environment and 
time-invariant maternal factors, we performed a within-family analysis comparing the risk of 
obesity for siblings discordant in mode of delivery.34–37 In this last analysis we used 
conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI comparing

 participants born by cesarean to their vaginally born siblings. In addition, we evaluated the 
potential for residual confounding by weight gain during pregnancy in the subset of 
participants for whom this information was available (N=11,067). All analyses were 
conducted using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 22,068 individuals in the study, 4,921 (22%) were born by Cesarean section. The 
cumulative risk of obesity through the end of follow-up was 13% among all participants. 
Age-standardized maternal and offspring characteristics, overall and by mode of delivery, 
are presented in Table 1. Women who delivered by Cesarean had a higher pre-pregnancy 
BMI, and were more likely to have experienced gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and 
pregnancy induced hypertension. They were also more likely to have had a previous 
Cesarean delivery. C-sections were also more frequent in pre-term and post-term births, and 
for offspring who were either low-birth weight or macrosomic. The Cesarean delivery rate 
was highest between 1985 and 1989 and decreased thereafter.
Cesarean birth was associated with higher risk of obesity in crude analyses (RR=1.30, 95% 
CI: 1.21–1.41). After adjustment for potential confounders, the association attenuated but 
remained statistically significant (Table 2). The multivariate adjusted RR for developing 
obesity comparing Cesarean to vaginal birth was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.26; p=0.002). Most 
of the attenuation resulted from adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Of the 2,766 
individuals who were classified as obese at some point during follow-up, 1,206 were 
classified at a later follow-up period as non-obese. When these individuals were excluded 
from the analyses, the corresponding adjusted RR (95% CI) was 1.16 (1.03, 1.30). When 
using repeated measures of BMI over time, the mean difference (95% CI) in BMI over the 
entire follow-up period between individuals born by Cesarean and vaginally-delivered 
individuals was 0.29 (0.18, 0.40) kg/m2 in the multivariate analyses. The association 
between cesarean section and offspring obesity was similar across strata of age. The 
multivariate adjusted RRs (95% CI) for obesity were 1.23 (1.03, 1.46) at ages 9–12, 1.16 
(1.03, 1.31) at ages 13–18, and 1.10 (0.98, 1.24) at ages 19–28 (p, heterogeneity=0.13) 
(Figure 1 and eTable 1). Associations were also similar for females (1.12, 0.99–1.27) and 
males (1.18, 1.04–1.34) (p, heterogeneity=0.62).
The association between cesarean delivery and offspring obesity remained in analyses aimed 
at addressing the possibility of residual confounding. Similar results were found when 
confounders were accounted for using propensity-score based methods, when maternal pre-
pregnancy BMI was modeled as a continuous variable, when repeated obesity status at each 
follow-up period was considered, when analyses were restricted to individuals whose 
mothers had no known risk factor for cesarean section or to siblings (Table 2 and eTable 1). 
Further adjustment for breastfeeding duration and gestational weight gain did not change the 
conclusions (data not shown).
We then estimated the effect of change in delivery mode on offspring obesity. Among 
women with a previous C-section (N=2,815), offspring’s obesity risk was 31% (17%, 47%) 
(RR (95%CI)=0.69 (0.53, 0.83)) lower after a VBAC compared to a repeat Cesarean

 delivery. Among women with a previous vaginal delivery (N=12,815), the estimated 
increased risk in offspring obesity (1.13, 0.98–1.30) (Table 3) was comparable to the 
equivalent estimate in the entire population (1.15, 1.06–1.26), although it failed to reach 
statistical significance.
Lastly, we used data from successive pregnancies and siblings to perform a within-family 
analysis of discordant mode of delivery among the 12,903 individuals with one or more 
siblings in GUTS in order to minimize potential confounding by shared post-natal 
environment and time-invariant maternal factors. In this analysis, the odds of obesity were 
64% (8%, 149%) higher among individuals born by Cesarean than their vaginally born 
siblings. The association was similar for ages 9–18 years and for ages 19–28 years (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this large cohort of U.S. individuals followed from childhood, through adolescence and 
young adulthood, Cesarean section was associated with a 15% increase in the risk of 
offspring obesity after adjusting for major confounding factors. The relation was similar 
across strata of age and remained consistent in a large number of sensitivity analyses. This 
association was stronger (30% increased risk) among individuals without known risk factors 
for C-section. Analyses of change in mode of delivery across multiple pregnancies revealed 
that individuals born through VBAC were 31% less likely to become obese than those born 
through a repeat Cesarean. Moreover, within-family analysis showed that individuals born 
through Cesarean section were 64% more likely to be obese than their siblings born through 
vaginal birth. The consistency of these findings across multiple strategies to account for 
potential confounding factors, in particular the analyses restricted to individuals without 
known risk factors for cesarean section and those conducted within families, strongly 
suggest that this relation may not be due to confounding factors but may instead represent a 
true biological effect.
While evidence is still building, the observed higher risk of offspring obesity associated with 
Cesarean section may be a consequence of differences in gastrointestinal microbiota 
established at birth.38,39 Vaginally delivered infants have greater exposure to their mother’s 
vaginal and gastrointestinal microbiota compared to infants delivered by Cesarean, who are 
mainly exposed to their mother’s skin microbiota and to external environmental bacterial 
communities at birth.40–42 This early-life difference in mode of delivery leads to altered gut 
microbiota pattern in offspring.39 Compared with infants born vaginally, newborns delivered 
by Cesarean section harbor more staphylococcus, less bifidobacteria, and less diverse 
bacteria species in microbiota colonization, a pattern that has been linked to increased 
capacity for energy harvest and risk of overweight and obesity at later life.39,43,44 Studies 
documenting differences in microbiota according to mode of delivery have mainly been 
limited to the first year of life. Whether differences in offspring microbiota are sustained 
long-term remains to be evaluated.
Our findings extend and refine evidence in this area. Despite inconsistent findings from 
individual studies,44–51 two recent meta-analyses reported a 22% increased odds of adult 
obesity12 associated with Cesarean delivery. However, many of the studies included in these

 meta-analyses—particularly in the meta-analyses for adult obesity—failed to account for 
important potential confounders, most importantly for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.12,15 
Several additional studies have reported on the relation with childhood obesity since the 
publication of these meta-analyses. A study of 2,988 Canadian children found a non-
statistically significant higher risk of obesity among children born through Cesarean section 
after adjusting for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (multivariate OR=1.20, 95% CI: 0.87–1.65).
14 Similarly, a study of German children found that Cesarean section was related to a higher 
risk of offspring obesity at 2 years of age (n=1734, OR, 1.68, 95%CI, 1.10–2.58), but not at 
6 (n=1244, OR, 1.49, 95% CI, 0.55–4.05) or 10 years of age (n=1170, OR, 1.16, 95% CI, 
0.59–2.29) after adjusting for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.52 Despite the lack of statistical 
significance of the findings of these two studies, which could be explained by their limited 
sample size, the magnitude of the associations reported is similar to our estimates.
The most important limitation of our study is that we lack data on intrapartum indications 
for cesarean delivery. However, the most common intrapartum indications of Cesarean 
delivery, namely fetal intolerance of labor and arrest of labor 53, are not known risk factors 
for childhood obesity and are therefore unlikely to be important confounders of the relation 
between Cesarean section and offspring obesity. Similarly, we do not have detailed data on 
other potentially important information about labor and delivery such as whether or not 
women underwent labor, whether or not membranes were ruptured nor detailed information 
on antibiotic use during pregnancy or labor and delivery. An additional limitation is the 
under-representation of minorities in our cohort. However, there are no a priori reasons to 
believe this relation would differ across race or ethnicity. In addition, all mothers in our 
studies were nurses participating in a long-term health study. While this facilitated their 
long-term follow-up, that of their offspring and the prospective collection of high-quality 
detailed data, it may hamper the generalizability of the findings to the general population. 
For example, pre-pregnancy BMI was lower than that of women of reproductive age in the 
US around the same time.54 An additional limitation is that estimates of the prevalence of 
obesity using self-reported information may be lower than estimates based on direct 
anthropometry. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that misclassification of obesity status was related 
to mode of birth. Hence, the most likely effect of this error is to attenuate the association 
towards the null. Finally, we lacked information on offspring microbiota or other potential 
biological mediators to further explore the underlying mechanisms.
Nevertheless, the current study has multiple strengths and was able to address the most 
salient limitations of previous studies. The prospective study design, large sample size, and 
long-term follow-up allowed us to examine the relation of cesarean section and offspring 
obesity risk from childhood through early adulthood and to provide precise estimates of the 
association. The availability of key pre-pregnancy and pregnancy information allowed for 
multiple sensitivity analyses aimed at addressing residual confounding. In addition, 
information on multiple pregnancies from the same woman and extensive family data 
enabled us to estimate, for the first time in this literature, the effects of changes in mode of 
delivery and to minimize the effect of confounding due to environmental factors and time-
invariant maternal characteristics by conducting within-family analyses.

 In conclusion, we observed an association between Cesarean delivery and increased risk of 
offspring obesity that persisted through early adult life. We also report for the first time a 
protective effect of VBAC on offspring obesity and a significant difference in risk of obesity 
between siblings discordant for mode of birth. The relation between Cesarean section and 
offspring obesity was stronger in analyses restricted to individuals without known risk 
factors for Cesarean section and in within-family analyses. These findings suggest that this 
relation may be a true adverse outcome of Cesarean delivery that clinicians and patients 
should weigh when considering cesarean sections in the absence of a clear medical or 
obstetric indication. Since large randomized trials of Cesarean vs. vaginal birth may not be 
ethically feasible, additional research from large, prospective studies with high quality data 
on pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and delivery information is needed to address whether these 
findings are generalizable to minorities and to investigate whether increased obesity rates 
translate to increased risk of adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes among individuals born by 
Cesarean section.
