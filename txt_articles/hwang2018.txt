 Radiotherapy first came into routine use in the treat-
ment of patients with cancer in the early 1930s1. Today, 
approximately half of all cancer diagnoses have an 
indication for radiotherapy, with substantially greater 
use in the metastatic setting2,3. Modern radiotherapy 
techniques, such as volumetric modulated arc therapy, 
intensity- 
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic 
body radiation therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery are 
sophisticated and enable the delivery of effective doses of 
radiation to tumours at a submillimetre level of accuracy 
while avoiding the toxicity profiles that were previously 
seen with older techniques4.
The delivery of ionizing radiation in the form of 
 
X- 
rays, γ- 
rays, electrons, protons, and other modalities 
results in the intracellular production of reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) that interact with DNA, producing 
toxic adducts, single- 
strand breaks, and double- 
strand 
breaks. Radiation- 
induced DNA damage results in cell 
cycle inhibition as well as tumour cell death through 
apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy5,6. The release 
of endogenous danger signals, known as damage- 
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), can engage the 
immune system to increase cytokine release, promote 
the presentation of tumour- 
associated antigens (TAAs) 
on antigen- 
presenting cells (APCs), and stimulate 
diversification of the host T cell repertoire7–9.
The adverse effects of radiotherapy are the result 
of the effects of radiation- 
induced DNA damage on 
patients’ nonmalignant tissues. In the short term, 
radiation- 
induced tissue damage and the associated 
inflammatory infiltrate can cause mucositis, pneumo-
nitis, and other localized reactive changes. In the longer 
term, adverse effects can include stromal changes 
involving collagen deposition, contracture, neoangio-
genesis, and second malignancies, the clinical relevance 
and incidence of which are highly dependent upon 
treatment site, target volume, fraction size, and total 
dose10–14.
Anticancer immunotherapy, in the form of immune- 
checkpoint inhibition (ICI), is a paradigm shift that has 
transformed the care of patients with advanced- 
stage 
cancers, with the most notable improvements seen in 
patients with melanoma, non- 
small-cell lung, bladder, 
renal, head and neck cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma 
and in those with malignancies characterized by DNA 
microsatellite instability5,15–20. These agents target T cell 
negative feedback loops, or ‘immune checkpoints’
, which 
prevent the development of excessive immune responses

Abstract | Immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T- lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTL 
A-4), 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD- 
L1) have 
transformed the care of patients with a wide range of advanced- 
stage malignancies. More  
than half of these patients will also have an indication for treatment with radiotherapy.  
The effects of both radiotherapy and immune- 
checkpoint inhibition (ICI) involve a complex 
interplay with the innate and adaptive immune systems, and accumulating evidence suggests 
that, under certain circumstances, the effects of radiotherapy synergize with those of ICI 
 to augment the antitumour responses typically observed with either modality alone and  
thus improve clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms by which radiotherapy and  
immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors synergistically modulate the immune response might also affect 
both the type and severity of treatment- 
related toxicities. Moreover, in patients receiving 
immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors, the development of immune- 
related adverse events has been 
linked with superior treatment responses and patient survival durations, suggesting a relationship 
between the antitumour and adverse autoimmune effects of these agents. In this Review 
, we 
discuss the emerging data on toxicity profiles related to immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors and 
radiotherapy 
, both separately and in combination, their potential mechanisms, and the 
approaches to managing these toxicities.

 and autoimmunity. Two major classes of immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors have emerged — those targeting 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), such as 
ipilimumab or tremelimumab, and those targeting pro-
grammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), such as nivolumab 
and pembrolizumab, or its ligand, programmed cell 
death 1 ligand 1 (PD- 
L1), such as durvalumab and 
atezolizumab.
The adverse effects of immune- 
checkpoint inhib-
itors targeting the CTLA-4 or PD-1–PD- 
L1 axes are 
diverse and distinct, with differences in toxicity profiles 
reflecting the mechanistic underpinnings of each tar-
get. CTLA-4 and PD-1 regulate different stages of the 
immune response. When naive T cells are primed by 
exposure to antigens presented by APCs in draining 
lymph nodes, they become activated. Within 48–72 h 
of activation, these T cells begin to express CTLA-4 
on their surfaces, which is able to compete with CD28 
for binding to CD80 or CD86 on the surface of APCs. 
This competition between CTLA-4 and CD28 attenu-
ates the early activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and 
improves the immunosuppressive functions of regu-
latory T (Treg) cells21–23. Ctla4-knockout mice develop 
abnormal patterns of lymphoproliferation and often 
develop autoimmune diseases, such as pancreatitis 
and myocarditis24–26. In humans, inactivating poly-
morphisms in CTLA4 are linked with a wide array of 
autoimmune disorders including thyroiditis, diabetes 
mellitus, coeliac disease, myasthenia gravis, Addison 
disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid 
arthritis27–32. The breadth of T cell activation induced 
by CTLA-4 inhibition is thought to be responsible 
for the wide range of immune- 
related adverse events 
(irAEs) associated with these agents, which are some-
times severe and can occur during treatment or even 
long after treatment cessation.
In contrast to CTLA-4, the primary site of action 
of PD-1 and its ligands is in peripheral tissues, includ-
ing the tumour microenvironment (TME). PD-1 
expressed on activated T cells can interact with PD- 
L1 
or PD- 
L2 expressed on the surface of cancer cells or 
tumour- 
infiltrating immune cells, thus inhibiting the 
cytotoxic action of those T cells33,34. Correspondingly, 
upregulation of PD- 
L1 by tumour cells leads to increased 
levels of T cell exhaustion and is thought to be a means 
of cancer cell immune evasion35,36. Similar to CTLA-4, 
mouse models lacking expression of PD-1 have dis-
tinct autoimmune phenotypes, such as lupus- 
like syn-
dromes or dilated cardiomyopathy37,38. Inhibitors of the 
PD-1 axis only activate a restricted subset of T cells in 
the TME and in the circulation; accordingly, the irAEs 
associated with these agents tend to be more limited in 
scope, severity, and incidence but have an earlier onset 
than the adverse effects of CTLA-4 inhibition39.
The nonredundant and collaborative effects of anti- 
CTLA-4 and/or anti- 
PD-1–PD- 
L1 antibodies with 
 
radio 
therapy were elegantly revealed in a co- 
clinical 
study involving mouse models and patients with meta-
static melanoma7. The findings of this study demonstrate 
that anti- 
CTLA-4 antibodies inhibit the immunosup-
pressive activity of Treg cells and increase the ratio of 
CD8+ T cells to Treg cells in the TME, while inhibition 
of the PD-1–PD- 
L1 interaction primarily reverses T cell 
exhaustion7. By contrast, in the same study7, irradiation 
of tumours distinctly increased the diversity of the 
T cell receptor (TCR) pool. In both mouse models and 
patients with metastatic melanoma, pathologist- 
rated 
high levels of PD- 
L1 expression in at least 2% of tumour 
cells was associated with persistent T cell exhaustion 
and poor responses to the combination of radiother-
apy and CTLA-4 inhibition7. This finding suggested the 
potential benefit of combining radiotherapy with simul-
taneous inhibition of the CTLA-4 and PD- 
L1 pathways. 
Radiotherapy and immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors 
are both commonly used in the treatment of patients 
with advanced- 
stage solid tumours and, therefore, 
the potential synergistic effects of concurrent radio-
therapy and ICI on antitumour immunity are of great 
interest. The ability of radiotherapy to potentiate the 
effects of ICI was provocatively demonstrated in a case 
report, in which a patient with metastatic melanoma 
progressed on ICI but subsequently had a profound 
abscopal response, or out- 
of-field systemic response, 
after receiving focal palliative radiotherapy40. The 
 
abscopal effect was first described in 1953 based on 
 
the observation that local radiotherapy can sometimes 
induce regression of metastatic lesions located far from 
the irradiated site41 and is now thought to be driven by 
immune- 
mediated mechanisms42. Unequivocal absco-
pal responses to radiotherapy seem to be uncommon 
in clinical practice, although preclinical and clinical 
research findings published in the past few years have 
demonstrated the synergistic effects of ICI and radio-
therapy, with numerous clinical trials designed to assess 
the optimal sequence, timing, and dose of radiotherapy 
and ICI currently ongoing39,43,44.
Importantly, the collaborative mechanisms by which 
radiotherapy and ICI modulate the immune response 
might also affect the spectrum and severity of treatment- 
related toxicities. Given the increasing clinical use of this 
combination and the implications for patients, we criti-
cally review the emerging toxicity risks associated with 
combined radiotherapy and ICI.
Key points
• The effects of radiotherapy on both tumours and nonmalignant tissues involve a 
complex interplay with the immune system, potentially resulting in both 
immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects.
• under certain circumstances, radiotherapy might augment the antitumour effects of 
immune- 
checkpoint inhibition (ICI) by releasing endogenous danger signals and 
cytokines, increasing the presentation of tumour- 
associated antigens on antigen- 
presenting cells, and stimulating diversification of the T cell repertoire.
• Combination therapy with radiotherapy and ICI might affect both the type and 
severity of treatment- 
related toxicities, especially immune- 
related adverse events.
• Data from numerous retrospective series and a handful of prospective studies, both 
single- 
arm and randomized, provide burgeoning evidence that the combination of 
palliative radiotherapy and ICI is safe overall without a substantial site- 
specific 
increase in adverse events.
• The available evidence suggests that ICI following definitive chemoradiotherapy for 
non- 
small-cell lung cancer does not increase the incidence of grade ≥3 pneumonitis 
over either treatment modality alone.
• Addition of ICI to high- 
dose stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy for brain 
metastases might increase the risk of treatment- 
related brain necrosis.

 Preclinical rationale
The importance of the host immune system to the anti-
neoplastic effects of radiotherapy was first established 
in the 1970s using a mouse model of fibrosarcoma, on 
the basis of experiments demonstrating that the radia-
tion dose required for tumour control is substantially 
lower in immunocompetent mice than in immunocom-
promised mice45. Subsequently, the findings of numer-
ous preclinical studies have elucidated the interplay 
between the immune system and radiotherapy at both 
the local and systemic level, which has been reviewed in 
detail elsewhere43,46. In brief, focal radiotherapy induces 
immunogenic cell death and leads to the production of 
DAMPs and cytokines and/or chemokines in the TME 
that promote the recruitment of immune cells with both 
antineoplastic and tumour- 
promoting effects, such as 
dendritic cells, effector T cells, T
reg cells, myeloid- 
derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumour- 
associated mac-
rophages (TAMs)47–50. Importantly, radiotherapy might 
be able to serve as an in situ vaccine by inducing the 
release of TAAs and increasing the number of antigen- 
presenting dendritic cells in the TME and in the draining 
lymph nodes, in which antigen- 
specific effector T cells 
are primed and activated before entering the circula-
tion in search of tumour cells to neutralize51–53. Beyond 
direct stimulatory effects on the adaptive immune 
system, radiotherapy also engages the innate immune 
system by causing the release of nucleic acids into the 
cytoplasm, which is sensed by Toll- 
like receptors, RIG- 
I-like receptors, and the stimulator of interferon genes 
(STING) pathway and activates the type I interferon 
(IFN) response47.
Abscopal effects of radiotherapy alone have been 
reported >45 times in various case reports54, although 
this effect remains a phenomenon that is rarely observed 
clinically. Hence, considerable interest exists in develop-
ing strategies to augment both the frequency and effi-
cacy of abscopal responses43,46,55–57. Even if TAA- 
specific 
effector T cells are generated and activated, immuno-
suppressive mechanisms both in the systemic circula-
tion and in the TME can hinder the development of an 
effective antitumour response. Moreover, the effects of 
radiotherapy on the immune system are complex and 
can include direct myeloablative effects, as well as more 
nuanced immunosuppression. For example, irradia-
tion can increase the population of tumour- 
associated 
Treg cells52,58,59. These inhibitory cells have an important 
role in modulating inflammation and preventing the 
development of autoimmunity by secreting IL-10 and 
TGFβ, which suppress effector T cells and stimulate the 
immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs60. Interestingly, 
levels of CTLA-4 expression on Treg cells doubled at 
 
3 days after whole- 
body irradiation in a mouse model61, 
which provides a mechanistic basis for potential synergy 
between CTLA-4 inhibition and radiotherapy. To this 
end, researchers investigated the combination of radio-
therapy with concurrent and subsequent treatment with 
anti- 
CTLA-4 antibodies in syngeneic mice injected sub-
cutaneously with mouse breast carcinoma cells in two 
locations, one within the radiation field and one out-
side, as well as in a second mouse model of colon carci-
noma62. These investigators found that fractionated, but 
not single- 
dose, radiotherapy was effective at initiating 
an abscopal response that corresponded with increased 
infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the 
nonirradiated tumour. Following these observations, 
numerous preclinical studies have explored the effects of 
combinations of different forms of immunotherapy, var-
ying radiation doses and/or fractionation, and the timing 
of radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy, with generally 
disparate results; therefore, this strategy remains an area 
of active investigation46. Larger doses of radiation per 
fraction have typically been associated with enhanced 
abscopal responses63, although a patient- 
specific and 
disease- 
specific optimal dose range most likely exists 
that provides an adequate level of immune stimulation 
without triggering dose- 
dependent immunosuppressive 
mechanisms, such as induction of the DNA exonuclease 
TREX1, which degrades the cytosolic double- 
stranded 
DNA typically generated by radiotherapy, thereby 
reducing the extent of any immunogenic effects64.
In a landmark study7, researchers examined the 
interplay between radiotherapy and ICI. In a single- 
arm 
phase I clinical trial involving 22 patients with multiple 
melanoma metastases, the delivery of hypofraction-
ated radiotherapy to a single index lesion followed by 
CTLA-4 inhibition with ipilimumab was well tolerated 
and yielded a response rate in nonirradiated tumours of 
18%7. In analogous in vivo investigations, B16-F10 mice 
with experimentally induced melanomas located in the 
bilateral flank were likewise treated with radiotherapy 
to one lesion with subsequent or concurrent CTLA-4 
blockade, resulting in a similar response rate of 17%7. 
Examinations of treatment- 
resistant tumours in mice 
revealed a lack of an increase in the CD8+ T cell:T
reg cell 
 
ratio, marked upregulation of PD- 
L1 expression, and 
evidence of persistent T cell exhaustion. Similarly, 
patients with high PD- 
L1 levels (defined as detectable 
PD- 
L1 expression in ≥2% of tumour cells in a biopsy 
sample) did not respond to combined radiotherapy and 
anti- 
CTLA-4 antibodies, had features suggestive of T cell 
exhaustion, and had significantly worse outcomes than 
those with lower PD- 
L1 levels. Upfront treatment of the 
mouse model with combined radiotherapy, anti- 
CTLA-4 
antibodies, and anti- 
PD-1 or PD- 
L1 antibodies yielded a 
remarkable complete response rate of 80%, while omis-
sion of radiotherapy or anti- 
CTLA-4 antibodies yielded 
a complete response rate of only 20%7. Although these 
various provocative studies suggest that combining 
radiotherapy with immunotherapies targeting differ-
ent immune checkpoints might be an effective strategy, 
an important limitation is that most of these data were 
generated in mouse models with bilateral subcutaneous 
tumours that do not accurately recapitulate the TME 
of human tumours65. Hence, we expect greater clarity 
to emerge from future research using autochthonous 
 
and/or orthotopic models, as well as from ongoing 
clinical trials.
The cost of the increased efficacy provided by com-
bined ICI (inhibition of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 or PD- 
L1) 
is a concomitant increase in toxicity39. Radiotherapy 
generally influences the immune response via mecha-
nisms that do not overlap with ICI; therefore, one could 
posit that adding radiotherapy to ICI (with inhibition

 of either one or more than one checkpoint) might 
further increase both the risk and severity of adverse 
effects. Specifically, delivery of radiotherapy requires 
the placement of a margin around the target to account 
for the presence of microscopic disease, variations intro-
duced by motion, and setup errors, which can expose 
patients’ nonmalignant tissues to high- 
dose radiation 
and could stimulate an autoimmune response through 
mechanisms similar to those involved in generating an 
antitumour immune response, such as the release of 
self- 
antigens. Unfortunately, preclinical models do not 
accurately capture the range of toxicities observed in 
patients. A notable example is provided by the lack of 
hypophysitis in mouse models exposed to ipilimumab, 
which contrasts with the observation of this condition as 
an irAE affecting up to 8% of patients66,67. Hence, direct 
clinical evidence is necessary to accurately inform on 
the safety and risks of combining radiotherapy with ICI.
Immune- 
related adverse events
Overview of immune- 
related adverse events. A grow-
ing body of data are emerging from large- 
cohort, pro-
spective clinical trials on the adverse event profiles of 
anti- 
CTLA-4 and anti- 
PD-1 or PD- 
L1 antibodies. These 
toxicities, and recommendations for their management, 
have previously been described in detail in this journal 
and elsewhere40,68 — thus, our discussion herein is lim-
ited to a brief overview. In studies in which toxicities 
were graded, the National Cancer Institute Common 
Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event scale (version 4) was 
used as the standard.
In the initial phase I/II study of ipilimumab in 
patients with metastatic melanoma, the reported rate of 
grade 3–4 irAEs was 14% and the rate of grade 1–2 irAEs 
was 58%69. The most commonly reported irAEs of any 
grade were diarrhoea and/or colitis, rash and/or viti-
ligo, elevated serum transaminase levels, and endocrine 
dysfunction — typically hypophysitis (Fig. 1). Data from 
phase II or III studies involving ipilimumab mono-
therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma have 
revealed any- 
grade irAEs in approximately 50–65% of 
 
patients, with grade 3–4 irAEs occurring in 5–27% 
of patients70–73.
Clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy 
of anti- 
PD-1 antibodies as monotherapy have reported 
any- 
grade irAEs in 13–41% of patients, with grade 
3–4 irAEs in 1–11% of patients17–19,74–77. Immune- 
related 
colitis and hypophysitis are more frequent with anti- 
CTLA-4 antibodies, while pneumonitis and thyroid 
dysfunction occur more often with antibodies targeting 
PD-1 signalling78.
Combined ICI with ipilimumab and either 
nivolumab or pembrolizumab is considerably more toxic 
than monotherapy with either agent alone. A pooled 
analysis of data from the Checkmate 037, 067, and 069 
trials revealed grade 3–4 irAEs in 8%, 19%, and 40% of 
patients treated with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and the 
 
combination of these two agents, respectively79. In 
 
the combination therapy cohort, 39% of patients dis-
continued treatment owing to adverse drug reactions, as 
opposed to 8% and 15% of patients in the cohorts receiving 
 
nivolumab or ipilimumab monotherapy, respectively.
In February 2018, ASCO and the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) published a 
Clinical Practice Guideline on the management of irAEs, 
which was developed based on a systematic review of 
the literature and the consensus of a multidisciplinary 
panel80. Specific recommendations vary by the site of 
toxicity, although in general, grade 1 irAEs can be closely 
observed with continuation of ICI, while grade 2–3 irAEs 
require suspension of ICI and initiation of moderate or 
high doses of corticosteroids. Grade 4 irAEs merit indef-
inite cessation of treatment with immune- 
checkpoint 
inhibitors, high- 
dose steroids, and additional immuno-
suppression with biologic agents such as infliximab in 
patients with refractory symptoms80.
Association between irAEs and clinical outcomes. 
Data from a phase I–II study of the safety and efficacy 
of ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma 
published in 2008 revealed an association between dis-
ease control and grade 3–4 irAEs69. The findings of sev-
eral subsequent studies have confirmed this association 
between irAEs and a favourable prognosis81–84, even after 
adjusting for cumulative dose of immune- 
checkpoint 
inhibitors85. In a pooled analysis of 576 patients with 
advanced- 
stage melanoma who received nivolumab, the 
objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher 
in patients who had irAEs of any grade than in those 
who did not (ORR 49% versus 18%; P < 0.001) and in 
those who experienced grade ≥3 irAEs than in those 
with grade 1–2 irAEs (ORR 85% versus 47%; P < 0.001)85. 
Importantly, response rates and the duration of the 
responses were not diminished by the use of immuno-
modulatory agents (typically corticosteroids) to treat 
irAEs. Similar results have been observed in patients 
with metastatic lung cancer treated with anti- 
PD-1 or 
anti- 
PD-L1 antibodies. In a cohort of patients with met-
astatic lung cancer receiving treatment at Massachusetts 
General Hospital, the occurrence of grade ≥2 irAEs pre-
dicted improved all- 
cause mortality (HR 0.45, 95% CI 
0.22–0.93; P = 0.03)83. Similarly, a landmark analysis of 
data from patients with advanced- 
stage non- 
small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab showed 
that the development of any irAE was predictive of 
improved progression- 
free survival (PFS) and over-
all survival (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29–0.94; P = 0.03 and 
HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10–0.67; P = 0.003, respectively)84. 
These data suggest that the development of irAEs often 
portends an effective antitumour immune response. 
Importantly, not all patients who develop irAEs have 
superior survival outcomes because toxicities can be 
severe, and even fatal, in a small subset of patients.
These observations raise an important question 
regarding how the association between irAEs and 
responses to ICI can be explained. Perhaps augmenta-
tion of the antitumour immune response by ICI cannot 
be fully decoupled from an autoimmune response result-
ing in irAEs owing to pre- 
existing and emerging self- 
targeted T cells. Similarities among tumour neoantigens, 
non 
malignant tissue antigens, and microbial epitopes 
that might lead to cross reactivity have been described 
in patients who responded to ICI86,87. Hence, one could 
hypothesize that a certain degree of immune- 
related

 toxicity is likely necessary in order to generate an ade-
quate antitumour immune response. Indeed, this scenario 
might be akin to the long- 
standing challenges in balanc-
ing the competing risks of graft versus leukaemia effects 
and graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation88. Generally, 
severe GVHD is associated with a poor prognosis, while 
mild- 
to-moderate chronic GVHD is associated with a 
lower risk of relapse and favourable survival outcomes89,90.
Radiation- 
associated toxicities
Cellular exposure to ionizing radiation creates ROS and 
DNA double- 
strand breaks91, resulting in apoptosis, 
necrosis, mitotic catastrophe, senescence, and/or auto-
phagy. Nonmalignant tissues can better withstand this 
insult owing to their largely intact cellular repair mecha-
nisms, whereas these repair pathways are often disrupted 
during tumorigenesis. The use of protracted treatment 
regimens involving the delivery of small, daily doses (or 
fractions) of radiation provides more opportunity for cel-
lular repair in nonmalignant tissues than in tumour tis-
sues, thereby presenting a therapeutic window. However, 
even intact mechanisms of cellular repair have their lim-
itations, and adverse effects on nonmalignant tissues in 
the setting of therapeutic radiotherapy are well described.
Radiation- 
associated toxicities are mediated, in part, 
through the innate and adaptive immune systems, and 
this relationship is currently an area of active investiga-
tion. Chemoradiotherapy, for example, has been shown 
to modulate circulating effector T cells, MDSCs, T
reg cells,

 and humoral responses in patients with cancer9,92, and 
exposure to radiation alone has been shown to increase 
the diversity of TCRs in tumour- 
infiltrating lymphocytes 
found in unirradiated tumours in mouse models of mela-
noma7. Exposure to radiation has also been shown to 
upregulate the expression of major histocompatibility 
complexes and to potentiate antigen presentation by a 
melanoma cell line in vitro93. These interactions have 
implications for both cancer control and toxicity risks 
in nonmalignant tissues.
Clinical radiation toxicities and molecular mecha-
nisms. Radiation is generally considered to be a local 
treatment with anatomical disease- 
site-specific toxicities 
(Table 1). The inherent radiosensitivity of the nonma-
lignant tissue at the treatment site, the dose (reported 
in gray (Gy)), and the fractionation of radiation that is 
delivered (how much radiation is given per treatment 
and how much time separates each treatment) gener-
ally determine the frequency and severity of these tox-
icities. Radiation can cause a wide range of toxicities in 
nonmalignant tissues, which are generally either acute 
toxicities that develop over weeks to months (owing to 
inflammatory processes) or late- 
onset toxicities that 
develop over months to years (owing to fibrotic and/or 
atrophic processes). Acute toxicities are generally most 
evident in tissues with rapid cellular turnover, such as 
mucosal or epithelial surfaces, while late- 
onset toxicities 
are of greater concern in tissues with cells with long life 
cycles and a limited repair capacity, such as those con-
taining stromal cells, cardiac myocytes, or neurons. The 
immune system has a central role in the development of 
both acute and late- 
onset radiation- 
associated adverse 
effects.
The mechanisms of radiotherapy- 
induced nonma-
lignant tissue injury are complex and typically involve 
oxidative stress, senescence of stem cells, and the effects 
of pro- 
inflammatory and/or fibrogenic cytokines94,95. 
Pro- 
inflammatory cytokines, for example, have been 
shown to mediate the immunogenic response to radio-
therapy. This effect has been demonstrated in fibrosis- 
prone mouse models exposed to TGFβ, which facilitates 
tissue remodelling and inflammation after radiation 
therapy96. The lung parenchymal response to radio-
therapy provides another illustrative example: radiation 
pneumonitis is characterized by an inflammatory reac-
tion in the lungs driven by increased vascular permea-
bility, hyperaemia, leukocyte infiltration, and cytokine 
release97. Pulmonary fibrosis is thought to result from 
chronic inflammation- 
associated fibroblast proliferation, 
macro 
phage migration, and collagen deposition, which 
is driven and sustained by several growth factors and 
cytokines including TGFβ, FGFs, IL-1, IL-6, and tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF)97. Profibrotic macrophages secrete 
TGFβ and are key drivers of these changes94, although 
many other signalling molecules are currently being 
considered as potential predictive biomarkers of radia-
tion toxicities98. Subsets of T cells also have a role in the 
response of nonmalignant tissues to radiotherapy by 
adopting pro- 
inflammatory and pro- 
fibrotic profiles 
during both the acute and chronic phases of the tissue 
response94,99. The efficacy of anti- 
inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive agents (such as corticosteroids) in 
the management of a broad range of radiation- 
associated 
toxicities further highlights the paramount role of the 
immune system in the nonmalignant tissue response to 
radiotherapy.
Pre- 
existing comorbidities. The incidence, morbidity, 
and mortality associated with site- 
specific radiotherapy- 
induced toxicities are further modulated by comorbid 
pathologies of the ‘organs at risk’
. Given the role of the 
immune system in the nonmalignant tissue response to 
radiotherapy, the toxicity profiles of patients with auto-
immune diseases, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and connective 
tissue diseases (CTDs), are of special interest.
ILD is more prevalent in patients with lung cancer 
than in the general population, most likely because 
environmental exposures and chronic inflammation are 
overlapping risk factors for both diseases100. Patients with 
ILD are typically also considered to be poor candidates 
for surgery owing to a high risk of postoperative respira-
tory complications101. As such, definitive radiotherapy is 
often considered instead of surgery in patients who have 
potentially curable lung cancers. Patients with early stage 
NSCLC and ILD treated with stereotactic radiotherapy 
(SRT), a specialized form of image- 
guided, high- 
dose, 
high- 
precision treatment, have a higher incidence of 
severe pneumonitis than those without ILD, including in 
the nonirradiated lung, suggesting an immune- 
mediated 
mechanism102–104. For simplicity, we apply SRT as an 
umbrella term that includes single- 
fraction treatments, 
which are also known as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
Similar levels of caution should be applied to patients 
with IBD receiving pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy. 
The inflammatory mechanisms responsible for radiation 
enteropathy and IBD share common pathways, includ-
ing the secretion of cytokines, such as TGFβ, IL-1, IL-6, 
and TNF, as well as dysbiosis of gut bacteria105. As such, 
the principles governing the management of patients 
with IBD might also apply to radiation enteropathy. 
The findings of several retrospective series suggest that 
29–46% of patients with IBD that receive radiation ther-
apy will develop severe gastrointestinal complications, 
wherein the aforementioned immune mechanisms likely 
become amplified106.
Lastly, delivering radiotherapy to patients with CTDs 
has long been a recognized challenge and is often con-
sidered a relative or even absolute contraindication to 
radiotherapy given the potential for severe toxicities107. 
Other series have shown that scleroderma and sys-
temic lupus erythematosus are both associated with an 
increased risk of radiation- 
induced toxicities; however, 
various aspects, including small sample sizes and hetero-
geneity among both patients and the treatments they 
received, limit the conclusions that can be made107–109.
Management of radiation- induced toxicities. 
Ultimately, the effects of radiotherapy on nonmalignant 
tissues and the incidence and severity of toxicities are 
dependent on the specific anatomical site that is irradi-
ated, the presence of comorbid conditions, the volume of 
tissue treated, and the radiation dose and fractionation.

 Therefore, efforts to mitigate radiation- 
induced tox-
icities are dependent on the optimization of all these 
parameters. The two primary strategies involve reduc-
ing the level of radiation delivered to organs at risk and 
the clinical management of radiation- 
induced toxicities 
once they occur.
Over the past 2 decades, the development of tech-
nologies enabling the delivery of more conformal doses 
of radiotherapy, such as IMRT, proton therapy, and 
SRT4, have reduced the risk of radiation- 
induced toxic-
ities by decreasing the dose delivered to nonmalignant 
tissues while still enabling the delivery of tumoricidal 
doses of radiation to the target110–113 (Fig. 2). Dose de- 
escalation provides another method of reducing the 
dose of radiation delivered to nonmalignant struc-
tures and is an active area of investigation, especially 
in the setting of radiosensitive tumour histologies, 
such as human papillomavirus- 
associated cancers of 
the head and neck114. Once radiation- 
induced toxici-
ties occur, the goal of management becomes the con-
trol of symptoms and reduction of further damage in a 
site- 
specific manner.

 Safety of combination therapy
The excitement surrounding the potential synergy 
between radiotherapy and ICI might prove to be a 
double- 
edged sword. In both patients and mouse mod-
els, radiotherapy has been shown to diversify the TCR 
repertoire, leading to the priming and activation of naive 
T cells that recognize TAAs7,40. However, given that a cer-
tain degree of overlap exists between the toxicities seen 
with radiotherapy and those associated with ICI, and the 
observation that radiotherapy can induce immunogenic 
damage or death of nonmalignant host cells, concerns 
exist that the combination of radiotherapy and ICI 
might increase both the incidence and severity of irAEs 
(Fig. 3). In this section, we discuss the available evidence 
addressing this concern (Table 2).
Current FDA- 
approved indications for ICI mostly 
relate to use in the metastatic setting, in which palliative 
radiotherapy also has an important role. To address the 
safety of combining palliative radiotherapy with ICI, Bang 
and colleagues115 retrospectively identified 133 patients 
 
with metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, or renal cell car-
cinoma (RCC) treated with at least one cycle of an 
anti- 
CTLA-4 or anti- 
PD-1 antibody and palliative radio-
therapy (with a median equivalent dose of 40 Gy delivered 
in 2 Gy fractions). The median follow- 
up duration was 
 
6 months from the start of ICI and 9 months from the start 
 
of radiotherapy. A total of 46 patients (35%) had at least 
one irAE, but only 8% had a grade ≥3 irAE. Receiving 
more than the median equivalent radiotherapy dose in 
2 Gy fractions was associated with an increased incidence 
of irAEs of any grade (50% versus 42%; P = 0.01) and 
delivery of radiotherapy within 14 days of ICI was asso-
ciated with a non- 
statistically significant higher rate of 
irAEs of any grade (39% versus 23%; P = 0.06)115. A sim-
ilar retrospective study involving 46 patients with meta-
static cancer of varied histologies (50% of which were 
NSCLCs) treated with nivolumab and concurrent radio-
therapy (typically 30 Gy delivered in 10 fractions using 
3D conformal techniques) revealed toxicity rates of 24% 
(grade 3), 2% (grade 4), and 4% (grade 5)116. The median 
follow- 
up duration in this study was 3.3 months, and data 
were reported in abstract form only. Importantly, only 
36% of grade 3 toxicities occurred within the radiation 
field, and all grade 4 and 5 toxicities occurred outside 
of the field and were attributed to nivolumab alone. The 
lack of a clear association between the irradiated site and 
specific irAEs in these two studies suggests that any tox-
icities emerging from interactions between radiotherapy 
and ICI are primarily systemic rather than local.
In a prospective phase I trial involving 73 patients 
with heavily pretreated metastatic solid tumours, patients 
received extracranial SRT delivered to 2–4 metastases 
 
(at site- 
specific dose of 30–50 Gy in 3–5 fractions) 
followed by initiation of pembrolizumab within a week 
of completion of radiotherapy117. Patients were not 
screened for PD- 
L1 expression. The ORR was 13.2%, 
although 26.9% of patients had a ≥30% reduction in 
the diameter of any single nonirradiated metastatic 
lesion, with evidence of abscopal effects correlating 
with higher IFNγ- 
induced gene expression in a subset 
of patients117. The median follow- 
up duration for toxic-
ities was 5.5 months. Despite major differences in the 
radiation technique, radiation dose, and fractionation 
used, the risk of grade ≥3 adverse events (8%) was iden-
tical to that reported by Bang et al.115,117. In contrast to 
the previous study, however, an association between the 
 
anatomical location of the irradiated site and the toxic-
ities was observed, with dose- 
limiting toxicities seen 
only in patients who received thoracic radiotherapy. 
Some potential reasons for this difference include the 
prospective study design, the use of higher doses of 
radio 
therapy, and the uniformly short intervals between 
the cessation of radiotherapy and initiation of ICI. A 
nonrandomized phase II study involving 17 patients with 
metastatic triple- 
negative breast cancer who received 
concurrent palliative radiotherapy (30 Gy in 5 fractions) 
and pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) revealed a

of-field responses (33%) in 
unselected patients than those found in prior studies, 
which had previously shown an ORR of 13–19% with 
ICI alone in patients with PD-

However, these numbers must be interpreted with cau-

12 weeks of study entry and were therefore not evaluable

 safety profile; however, all patients received combined- 
modality treatment and, therefore, these studies do not 
provide insight into whether the addition of radiotherapy 
to ICI increases the risk of irAEs.
In two other retrospective series, investigators 
compared the outcomes of patients receiving radi-
otherapy and ICI with those of patients receiving ICI 
alone. Researchers retrospectively reviewed data from 
88 patients with unresectable stage III–IV melanoma 
who received ipilimumab, of whom 44 also received 
extracranial radiotherapy with either a definitive or a 
palliative intent121. Baseline characteristics were evenly 
distributed across both groups, with the exception of 
better functional status and fewer brain metastases in 
the ipilimumab monotherapy group. Most patients 
(57%) received radiotherapy before ipilimumab, with a 
median interval of 10 weeks. No statistically significant 
differences were observed in the rates of irAEs between 
patients who received ipilimumab monotherapy or the 
combination of ipilimumab and radiotherapy (25% 
versus 18%; P = 0.61) or between those who received 
ablative versus those who received conventionally frac-
tionated radiotherapy (19% versus 17%; P > 0.99)121. 
Despite patients in the combined- 
modality group hav-
ing unfavourable baseline characteristics, no significant 
differences in PFS or overall survival outcomes between 
the groups were observed. Similarly, Aboudaram and 
colleagues122 examined the outcomes of 59 patients 
with metastatic melanoma who received treatment with 
anti- 
PD-1 antibodies either with or without palliative 
radiotherapy (mean dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions). In 
this study, radiotherapy was administered to 17 patients 
either concurrently or within 1 month before initiation 
of anti- 
PD-1 therapy. The rates of irAEs of any grade 
(29% versus 34%; P = 0.72) and grade ≥3 (7% versus 
12%; P = 0.65) were similar among patients who received 
radiotherapy and those who did not. The ORR was sig-
nificantly higher among patients in the radiotherapy 
group than in the nonradiotherapy group (65% versus 
33%; P = 0.02), with one patient who progressed on 
sequential ipilimumab and nivolumab demonstrating 
a durable complete response after the addition of focal 
radiotherapy to the latter. A nonsignificant trend was 
also observed towards improved 6-month disease- 
free 
survival (65% versus 50%; P = 0.32) and overall sur-
vival (76% versus 59%; P = 0.42) with the addition of 
radiotherapy to anti- 
PD-1 antibodies122.
Taken together, data from these retrospective series 
suggest that the combination of palliative radiotherapy 
and ICI in patients with advanced- 
stage melanoma 
is safe and does not lead to a significant increase in 
irAEs, regardless of the temporal relationship between 
the two treatments (Table 2). However, findings from 
one series119 revealed a correlation between both the 
ICI and the radiotherapy dose received and the inci-
dence of irAEs. In another series, investigators did not 
grade irAEs121, making the results difficult to compare 
with those of other studies. Overall, the incidences of 
grade ≥3 irAEs ranged from 7–31% across studies. Other 
factors contributing to these heterogeneous results 
include the use of different inhibitors and radiotherapy 
doses, different sites of irradiation, and the duration of 
follow- 
up monitoring119–122 (Table 2). Given these lim-
itations, prospective validation of these preliminary 
findings is essential.
Central nervous system toxicities. Brain metastases are 
common in patients with advanced- 
stage melanoma, 
NSCLC, or breast cancer and are generally associated 
with a poor prognosis123. Treatment typically involves a 
combination of surgical resection, WBRT, and/or SRT124. 
Immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors might inhibit or delay 
the development or progression of intracranial metas-
tases71,125,126. Moreover, data from several retrospective 
series suggest synergy between intracranial radiother-
apy and ICI, which has sparked interest in exploring the 
clinical benefits of this combination127–131.
Treatment- 
associated brain necrosis (TABN) after 
radiotherapy and/or other treatments can occur sec-
ondary to endothelial apoptosis and neuroinflamma-
tion132. The risk of TABN correlates with tumour size, 
exposure to higher doses of radiotherapy, and con-
current use of chemotherapy; radiographically, TABN 
frequently involves white matter and can have a similar 
appearance on MRI to that of a tumour, with enhance-
ment, oedema, and/or mass effects133–135. Most pub-
lished studies to date on the incidence of TABN after the 
combination of intracranial radiotherapy and ICI have 
focused on patients with metastatic melanoma. Fang 
and colleagues136 analysed the outcomes of 137 patients 
with melanoma brain metastases who received SRT to a 
combined total of 1,094 lesions plus ipilimumab and/or 
 
pembrolizumab. With a median follow- 
up of 9.8 months, 
the crude rate of radiographic TABN was 27%, with no 
significant differences in risk of TABN among patients 
receiving different types of ICI (P = 0.55). On multivariate 
analysis, treatment with chemotherapy within 6 months 
 
of SRT (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.22–3.97; P = 0.009) and a 
greater number of lesions (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.15; 
P = 0.002) were both associated with an increased risk 
of TABN, whereas the type or timing of ICI relative to 
SRT and/or targeted therapy were not136. The incidence 
of TABN in approximately a quarter of patients in this 
study is comparable to that observed after SRT alone, 
as determined in a contemporary series137. Other series 
examining the risk of TABN after combined SRT and 
ICI have revealed similar results: TABN in 20–30% 
of patients138,139.
Several studies have directly compared the risks 
of TABN after SRT with or without ICI. In a single- 
institution series, investigators examined the outcomes 
of 180 patients with brain metastases from various 
primary malignancies who received SRT and systemic 
therapy in the form of chemotherapy, targeted ther-
apy, and/or ICI140. After a median follow- 
up duration 
of 11.7 months, 21.7% of patients in this series devel-
oped TABN. After stratifying patients by the type of 
systemic therapy received, 16.9% of patients receiv-
ing chemotherapy developed TABN, compared with 
25.0% who received targeted therapy, and 37.5% who 
received ICI. Thus, the incidence of TABN was signif-
icantly greater in patients receiving ICI (OR 2.40, 95% 
CI 1.06–5.44; P = 0.03) and lower in patients receiving 
chemotherapy (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18–0.78; P = 0.01)140.

 Similarly, in a single- 
institution retrospective study138, 
investigators described the outcomes of 480 patients 
with brain metastases from primary melanoma, NSCLC, 
or RCC who received SRT with or without ICI (ipili-
mumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab). Using a com-
posite definition of TABN as either radiographically or 
pathologically confirmed, a higher rate of symptomatic 
TABN was observed in those receiving both SRT and 
ICI than in those undergoing SRT alone (20% versus 7%; 
P < 0.001)138. However, significant differences in baseline 
characteristics between the groups limit the strength 
of these conclusions; for example, more patients who 
received ICI had melanoma histology (63% versus 20%; 
P < 0.001) and received additional SRT (51% versus 35%; 
P = 0.002), both of which are potential TABN risk fac-
tors. Moreover, despite the large number of patients rel-
ative to those included in prior series, only 115 patients 
received combined SRT and ICI, which precluded the 
use of propensity score matching analysis138.
In another retrospective series141, investigators 
explored the outcomes of 54 patients with brain meta-
stases from melanoma undergoing SRT either in com-
bination with (n = 20) or without (n = 24) ipilimumab 
within 4 months of SRT. At a median follow- 
up duration of 
 
7.3 months, the rate of radiographic TABN was 21% with 
SRS alone and 30% with the combination of SRT plus 
ICI (P = 0.08). After isolating only symptomatic cases of 
TABN, the incidence was 15% in both groups (P > 0.99). 
Unlike in the other studies described, Diao and col-
leagues131 distinguished treatment- 
related imaging 
changes (TRICs) from pathologically confirmed TABN 
when examining a cohort of 72 patients with a total of 
310 melanoma brain metastases who were undergoing 
SRT with concurrent ipilimumab (59 brain met 
astases), 
with nonconcurrent ipilimumab (160 brain meta-
stases), or without ipilimumab (91 brain metastases). At 
a median follow- 
up duration of 6.9 months, the rate of 
symptomatic TRICs was significantly higher in patients 
receiving concurrent or nonconcurrent ipilimumab than 
in those receiving SRT alone (6.4% versus 0%; P = 0.005), 
although the rates of pathologically confirmed TABN 
were low in both groups (2.3% versus 0%; P = 0.22)131. 
In this study131, investigators reported an approximately 
tenfold lower rate of pathologically confirmed TABN 
in patients receiving combined SRT and ICI than in 
other series, in which investigators primarily used 
 
radiographic changes to diagnose TABN (Table 2).
The collective available evidence on the safety of 
concurrent ICI and intracranial radiotherapy is mixed, 
with some studies indicating a higher rate of TABN 
with combination therapy than with SRT monother-
apy138,140 and others showing no such trend131,141 (Table 2). 
Notably, the incidence of radiographic TABN in most 
series designed to investigate this question has typically 
been 20–30%, which is comparable to that observed 
in modern series of patients receiving SRT alone137. 
Potential explanations for these disparate results include 
the smaller cohort sizes of several series128,129 leading to 
underpowered assessments, variations in prescribed SRT 
doses and normalization, and shorter follow- 
up dura-
tions in certain series than in others (6–7 (reFs131,141) 
versus 12–25 (reFs138,140) months), which is relevant 
because the median time to development of TABN is 
 
8–11 months137,142. Intriguingly, the findings of several 
studies have demonstrated an association between TABN 
and improved survival outcomes in patients with mela-
noma brain metastases139,140 that is similar to the independ-
ent observations of an analogous relationship between risk 
of irAEs in general and responsiveness to ICI81–85.
Nevertheless, prospective investigations of the 
safety of combined intracranial radiotherapy and ICI 
are imperative. Moreover, the risks of neurotoxicities 
beyond TABN, and those associated with radiotherapy 
modalities other than SRT, such as WBRT, should also be 
addressed in more detail. Taking a step in this direction, 
Williams and colleagues143 conducted a phase I prospec-
tive study involving 16 patients with melanoma brain 
metastases to determine the maximum- 
tolerated dose 
and safety profile of combined ipilimumab with WBRT 
(arm A; including 5 patients with ≥5 brain metastases 
or any lesion with a maximal diameter >4 cm; 30 Gy in 
 
10 fractions) or SRT (arm B; including 11 patients who did 
 
not meet eligibility criteria for WBRT and received SRS 
with dosing per RTOG 90–05: lesion diameters ≤2 cm, 
2.1–3.0 cm, or 3.1–4 cm received single- 
fraction SRS at 
doses of 24 Gy, 18 Gy, and 15 Gy, respectively)133. The 
dose of ipilimumab was escalated independently in 
each arm from 3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Minimum follow- 
up was 1 month with a median follow- 
up of 8.0 months 
for arm A and 10.5 months for arm B. The combination 
seemed to be well tolerated, albeit with a short follow- 
up period; a total of 21 grade 1–2 neurotoxicities were 
observed, most commonly headache (38%), subclinical 
intracranial haemorrhage (25%), and nausea and/or 
vomiting (19%)143. Notably, no patients developed grade 
4–5 toxicities or TABN, although the number of patients 
included in the study was too small to make any broad 
conclusions.
In summary, data from a handful of retrospec-
tive investigations131,136,138–141 and a phase I prospective 
study143 indicate that the combination of intracranial 
radiotherapy and ICI has a tolerable safety profile over-
all; although data from some studies suggest an increased 
risk of TABN with the combination compared with radi-
otherapy alone, this change in risk seems to be primarily 
in the form of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 
episodes (Table 2). Important avenues for future research 
include randomized studies designed to compare the 
performance of intracranial radiotherapy alone with that 
of combination radiotherapy and ICI, as well as more 
investigations involving patients with nonmelanoma 
disease histologies.
Pulmonary toxicities. Antibodies targeting the PD-1–
PD- 
L1 axis have transformed the management of 
patients with advanced- 
stage NSCLC on the basis of 
data from a series of pivotal randomized phase III trials 
demonstrating improvements in overall survival with 
anti- 
PD-1 or anti- 
PD-L1 antibodies compared with the 
 
use of cytotoxic chemotherapies16,144–148. Moreover, 
estimates made using the National Cancer Database 
and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results pro-
gramme indicate that 40–50% of patients with advanced- 
stage lung cancer received radiotherapy as part of their

 treatment149,150. Patients with symptomatic pulmonary 
metastases from other primary forms of cancer also 
frequently receive thoracic radiotherapy. Therefore, a 
better understanding of the potential risks of toxicities 
when combining ICI with thoracic radiotherapy in this 
population is paramount.
Case reports describe the development of grade ≥3 
pneumonitis in patients receiving the combination of 
ICI and thoracic radiotherapy, but these studies do not 
reveal whether the risk of clinically relevant pneumo-
nitis is higher than in patients receiving only a single 
treatment modality151. To address this question, we 
conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 164 
consecutive patients with metastatic lung cancer treated 
with anti- 
PD-1 or anti- 
PD-L1 antibodies83. Baseline 
characteristics were similar in patients who received 
thoracic radiotherapy (n = 73) and those who did not 
(n = 91), except that fewer patients in the thoracic radi-
otherapy group had adenocarcinoma (49% versus 75%; 
 
P = 0.001) and targetable alterations (4% versus 16%; 
P = 0.01). The cumulative incidence of grade ≥2 irAEs 
at 2 years was 15% for the entire study cohort, which is 
comparable to the rates observed in large- 
cohort, ran-
domized trials investigating ICI in patients with meta-
static NSCLC16,144,146. At a median follow- 
up duration of 
 
12 months for survivors, the crude rates of grade ≥2 irAEs 
 
(13.7% versus 15.4%; P = 0.83), all- 
grade pneumonitis 
(8.2% versus 5.5%; P = 0.54), and grade ≥2 pneumonitis 
 
(4.1% versus 3.3%; P > 0.99) were not significantly 
different between the thoracic radiotherapy and non-
thoracic radiotherapy groups83. Among patients who 
received thoracic radiotherapy, no differences in the 
median prescribed dose were observed when stratified by 
the presence or absence of pneumonitis (52.8 Gy versus 
50.4 Gy; P = 0.76). Most patients (78%) received thoracic 
radiotherapy before initiation of ICI, with a median 
interval of 8.6 months between the two treatments; 
 
5.3% of these patients developed grade ≥2 pneumonitis. 
 
By contrast, none of the 16 patients who received 
thoracic radiotherapy between cycles of ICI, tho-
racic radiotherapy after ICI, or more than one course 
of thoracic radiotherapy developed symptomatic 
pneumonitis83.
KEYNOTE-001 was an international, multicentre, 
phase I trial of pembrolizumab in patients with progres-
sive metastatic NSCLC with a primary objective of eval-
uating the safety and efficacy of this agent148. Shaverdian 
and colleagues152 conducted a single- 
institution, sec-
ondary analysis of data from 97 patients enrolled in 
KEYNOTE-001 and found that patients who received 
any form of radiotherapy before initiation of pembroli-
zumab (n = 42) had significantly longer median PFS 
 
(4.4 versus 2.1 months; P = 0.019) and overall survival 
 
(10.7 versus 5.3 months; P = 0.026) than those who 
received no previous radiotherapy (n = 55) after a 
median follow- 
up duration of 32.5 months in survivors. 
The radiotherapy and nonradiotherapy groups were well 
balanced in terms of age, gender, performance status, and 
smoking history, although patients in the radiotherapy 
cohort had a greater incidence of brain metastases. In this 
study, disease stage at initial diagnosis was not associated 
with PFS or overall survival on multivariate analysis. 
 
The small subset of patients who received thoracic 
radiotherapy (n = 24) at a median of 11.5 months before 
pembrolizumab had a higher incidence of all- 
grade pul-
monary toxicities (13% versus 1%; P = 0.046), although 
no significant difference in risk of grade ≥3 pneumoni-
tis was detected between the thoracic radiotherapy and 
nonthoracic radiotherapy groups (4% versus 1%, with 
only one event observed in each group; P = 0.44)152.
The findings of these two series83,152 suggest that the 
combination of thoracic radiotherapy and ICI does not 
significantly increase the risk of high- 
grade pneumo-
nitis compared with ICI alone; however, most patients 
received thoracic radiotherapy several months before 
ICI, so whether or not earlier initiation of ICI after 
thoracic radiotherapy would increase the risk of tox-
icities remained unknown (Table 2). The randomized, 
placebo- 
controlled phase III PACIFIC trial investigated 
the role of consolidation durvalumab in patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC without disease progres-
sion after two or more cycles of platinum- 
based chemo-
radiotherapy153. In this trial, a total of 713 patients were 
randomized 2:1 to receive consolidation durvalumab or 
placebo starting between 1 and 42 days after completion 
of definitive chemoradiotherapy. The first interim ana-
lysis was conducted at a median follow- 
up duration of 
14.5 months. At this point, investigators found that con-
solidation durvalumab significantly improved median 
PFS (16.8 versus 5.6 months; P < 0.001)153. From a tox-
icity standpoint, any- 
grade pneumonitis was slightly 
more frequent in the combined radiotherapy and ICI 
group than in the radiotherapy only group (33.9% versus 
24.8%; P value not reported) but the incidence of clini-
cally relevant grade 3–4 pneumonitis was similar (3.4% 
versus 2.6%; P value not reported)153. In conclusion, data 
from the PACIFIC trial153 provide invaluable prospective 
validation of findings from other series indicating that 
the serial administration of definitive thoracic radio-
therapy and ICI, even in close temporal succession, 
does not significantly increase the risk of high- 
grade 
pneumonitis. Additional investigations regarding the 
tolerability of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy and ICI 
are warranted.
Conclusions
Mounting preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that 
radiotherapy induces both local and systemic immune 
responses that are able to synergize with ICI to improve the 
 
efficacy of these treatments and therefore improve 
 
the outcomes of patients. However, the mechanisms by 
which radiotherapy and ICI might synergize to provide 
antitumour effects could also lead to overlap in terms 
of toxicity profiles. Hence, over the past few years, 
increasing interest has emerged in studying the safety of 
combined radiotherapy and ICI. Most of the available 
evidence to date comes from single- 
institution retro-
spective studies. Overall, the findings of these studies 
indicate that combined palliative radiotherapy and ICI 
seems to be safe without a notable site- 
specific increase 
in the risk of adverse events. In patients with lung cancer, 
the incidence of high- 
grade pneumonitis is not elevated 
in those receiving definitive doses of thoracic radiother-
apy followed by ICI on the basis of both retrospective

 and randomized prospective data. By contrast, the evi-
dence from patients with brain metastases receiving SRT 
is mixed: the findings of some studies show an increase 
in TABN with combined SRT and ICI, although oth-
ers did not find such a correlation. Therefore, caution 
is warranted when combining radiotherapy and ICI, 
especially with intracranial radiotherapy. Further inves-
tigations into the optimal dose, fractionation, and tim-
ing of radiotherapy in combination with different types 
and doses of ICI will be critical for maximizing patient 
benefit. Chemotherapy can also modulate the efficacy 
and toxicities of both radiotherapy and ICI; thus, the 
safety and efficacy of chemoradiotherapy combined with 
ICI will also need to be studied systematically. Indeed, 
numerous studies examining different combinations 
of radiotherapy, immune- 
checkpoint inhibitors, and 
chemotherapy are currently ongoing and will likely pro-
vide an invaluable source of information on both efficacy 
and safety (Table 3). The increasing use of ICI in patients 
with nonmetastatic cancers153 potentially means an 
increase in the number of situations in which definitive 
doses of radiotherapy are given with ICI and/or chemo-
therapy in close temporal succession. An increase in 
the risk of clinically relevant pneumonitis was not seen 
in the PACIFIC trial when consolidation durvalumab 
was added to definitive chemoradiation in patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC, although the toxicity pro-
files of such combined- 
modality approaches are likely to 
be both regimen- 
specific and organ- 
specific. As more 
information accumulates, the parameters enabling the

 safe delivery of combined- 
modality therapy will become 
better defined.
One of the fundamental principles of radiation oncol-
ogy entails ensuring that the prescribed dose is delivered 
to the entirety of the target tumour. However, in situa-
tions wherein the primary purpose of radiotherapy is 
to synergize with ICI and amplify the abscopal effect, 
the concept of partial tumour irradiation becomes more 
attractive, as this would enable greater sparing of non-
malignant tissue, which could then lead to an improved 
toxicity profile154. However, tumours in patients are often 
characterized by remarkable levels of intratumoural 
hetero 
geneity155–157; therefore, partial tumour irradiation 
might limit the immunogenic effects of radiotherapy.
Further investigations of the mechanisms of irAEs 
and their modulation by radiotherapy in both preclinical 
models and patients should enable the development of 
better strategies to prevent or manage toxicities without 
compromising efficacy. Moreover, a handful of genetic 
and expression- 
based biomarkers (such as PD- 
L1 (reF.148) 
or double- 
strand break repair protein MRE11 (reF.158)) 
are now available for predicting response to ICI and/or 
 
radiotherapy, although an equally important need 
remains for predictive biomarkers of treatment- 
related 
toxicities. Finally, as other immunologically targeted 
agents progress through clinical development (such 
as those targeting lymphocyte activation gene 3 pro-
tein (LAG3), T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 3 
 
(TIM3; also known as HAVCR2), or glucocorticoid- 
induced TNFR- 
related protein (GITR; also known 
as TNFRSF18))159, investigators must remain vigilant 
from the outset regarding not only the toxicity profiles 
of these agents as monotherapies but also possible tox-
icities when used in combination with other treatments, 
including radiotherapy. Optimizing the balance between 
maximizing disease control and minimizing the risk 
of morbidity remains an essential aspect of the care of 
patients with cancer.
