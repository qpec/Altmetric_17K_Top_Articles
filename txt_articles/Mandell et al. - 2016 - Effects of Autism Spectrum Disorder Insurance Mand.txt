 Effects of Autism Spectrum Disorder Insurance Mandates on the Treated
Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder
Abstract
Key Findings: State mandates requiring commercial health plans to cover services for children with autism
spectrum disorder increased the number of children diagnosed with the disorder. However, diagnosis rates
remain much lower than community estimates, suggesting that many commercially insured children with
ASD remain undiagnosed or are insured through public plans.

KEY FINDINGS: State mandates requiring commercial health plans to cover services for children with autism spectrum 
disorder increased the number of children diagnosed with the disorder. However, diagnosis rates remain much lower than 
community estimates, suggesting that many commercially insured children with ASD remain undiagnosed or are insured 
through public plans. 
L DI  RESEA RCH  BRIEF
implement a mandate in 2001, followed by three states in 2008 
(Illinois, South Carolina, and Texas), before the start of the 
study. During the study period, mandates were implemented 
by six states in 2009 (Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), four states in 2010 
(Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, and New Jersey), eight 
states in 2011 (Arkansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maine, 
Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Vermont), and 
seven states in 2012 (California, Delaware, Michigan, New 
York, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia). All state 
mandates applied to fully insured firms with more than 50 
employees; 22 of the 29 state mandates also applied to fully 
insured firms with 50 or fewer employees. By the end of 
the study period, 18 of the 29 mandates covered individuals 
from birth through 18 years or older.
Of the more than one million children in the claims data 
sample, the authors identified 154,089 children diagnosed 
with ASD. Controlling for time trends and demographic 
factors, the study found that implementation of a mandate 
was associated with an increase of 12.7% in the treated 
prevalence of eligible children with ASD over the study 
period, with the effects building over time — 10.4% in the 
first year of the mandate, 17.1% in the second year, and 
18.0% in the third and later years. The adjusted prevalence 
rate was 1.8 per 1,000 children in states with ASD insurance 
mandates and 1.6 per 1,000 children in states without such 
a mandate.
THE QUESTION
Responding to the growing prevalence of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) among children, and insurer reluctance to 
pay for expensive treatments, 44 states now have mandates 
requiring commercial plans to cover behavioral services for 
children with ASD. These mandates apply to state-regulated 
plans but do not apply to large, self-insured employer group 
plans, which are federally-regulated. The state mandates 
vary in terms of the age ranges they cover and the kinds of 
plans to which they apply. 
Insurers have opposed the mandates, which they claimed 
would dramatically increase the number of children diagnosed 
with ASD and drastically increase health spending. ASD is 
thought to be underdiagnosed with its treated prevalence – 
the number of individuals diagnosed with ASD in the health 
care system – far below the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s estimated community prevalence of 15 per 
1,000 children. But little is known about the actual effects of 
these mandates. David Mandell and colleagues used claims 
data from three large national insurers to analyze the effects 
of state mandates on the rate at which commercially insured 
children are diagnosed with ASD.
THE FINDINGS
Twenty-nine states had ASD insurance mandates during 
the study period, 2008-2013. Indiana was the first state to 
 groups of children who would and would not be affected by 
the laws based on the source of their health insurance and their 
age. They compared four groups of children: those in states 
with active ASD insurance mandates, who were subject to 
the mandate; those in states with an active mandate who were 
not subject to the mandate; those in states without a mandate 
who would have been subject to the mandate if one were 
active; and those in states without a mandate who would not 
have been subject to the mandate if one were active. The use 
of comparison groups of children in states without mandates 
accounted for secular trends in treated prevalence unrelated 
to state ASD mandate laws. In addition, the authors looked at 
whether the effect of the mandates changed over time, based on 
how many years a law had been in place.

David S. Mandell, ScD is Professor of Mental 
Health Services Research in Psychiatry at 
Penn, where he directs the Center for Mental 
Health Policy and Services Research. He is also 
Associate Director of the Center for Autism 
Research at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The goal 
of his research is to improve the quality of care that individuals 
with autism receive in their communities. He examines, at the 
state and national level, the effects of different strategies to 
organize, finance and deliver services on service use patterns 
and outcomes. He also conducts experimental studies to 
determine the best ways to successfully implement efficacious 
practices in community settings. Dr. Mandell holds a bachelor 
of arts in psychology from Columbia University and a doctorate 
of science from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and 
Public Health.
Since 1967, the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (LDI) 
has been the leading university institute dedicated to data-driven, 
policy-focused research that improves our nation’s health and health 
care. Originally founded to bridge the gap between scholars in 
business (Wharton) and medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, 
LDI now connects all of Penn’s schools and the Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia through its more than 200 Senior Fellows.

L DI  RES EARCH  BRIEF
THE IMPLICATIONS
These findings indicate that the mandates are having their 
intended effects, and that those effects build over time. But 
even three years or more after implementation, the treated 
prevalence of ASD was much lower than community 
prevalence estimates. This finding may allay concerns that 
mandates will substantially increase insurance costs, but 
it suggests that many commercially insured children with 
ASD remain undiagnosed or are being treated only through 
publicly funded systems. 
It is clear that the mandates have not had the full effect 
that advocates desired. The authors note that the shortfall 
might be due to vague and difficult regulatory processes that 
providers must follow, low reimbursements for assessment 
and treatment, and a shortage of qualified clinicians to meet 
the growing demand for ASD-related care. The results 
suggest the need for additional strategies to enforce the 
mandates and address regulatory and health system-related 
barriers that inhibit the timely and appropriate identification 
of children with ASD.
THE STUDY
The authors used combined claims data (assembled by 
the Health Care Cost Institute) from three large, national 
health insurance companies: United Healthcare, Aetna and 
Humana. They identified 154,089 children (birth through 21 
years) diagnosed with ASD during the five-year study period 
from January 2008 through December 2012. To identify 
whether a child resided in a state with an implemented 
ASD mandate law, they compiled detailed information 
from Autism Speaks about state mandates, and verified the 
information by reviewing the original mandate laws.
They compared the treated prevalence of ASD within states 
before and after mandate implementation, and between
