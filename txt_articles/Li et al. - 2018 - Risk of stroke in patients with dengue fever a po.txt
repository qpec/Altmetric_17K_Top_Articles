engue is a globally important mosquito-borne viral infec-
tion, with about 4 billion people at risk and 100 million 
symptomatic cases annually.1 In 1997, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) classified symptomatic dengue as dengue fever 
and dengue hemorrhagic fever, with the latter having 4 grades of 
severity, where grades III and IV were considered to represent den-
gue shock syndrome.2 Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more severe 
form of dengue fever, with evident plasma leakage leading to spon-
taneous bleeding, organ failure or hypovolemic shock. In 2009, the 
WHO published a new classification for dengue, adding central ner-
vous system (CNS) involvement as a criterion for severe dengue.3 
Complications of CNS involvement in severe dengue include dengue 
encephalopathy or  encephalitis, post-dengue immune-mediated 
syndromes and cerebrovascular complications.4 The mediators 
released during dengue infection, such as cytokines, chemokines 
and complement, have vasoactive or procoagulant effects leading 
to thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and 
vasculitis, which may result in stroke.4 It is challenging to treat 
stroke in patients with dengue because of the difficulty of adminis-
tering thrombolytic agents to patients with a bleeding tendency. 
Knowing the incidence of and risk factors for stroke in patients with 
dengue would be helpful. However, only a few cases of dengue-
related hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke have been reported.5–9 The 
risk of stroke in patients with dengue remains unclear.
In Taiwan, patients with dengue are under surveillance by the 
Centers for Disease Control, R.O.C. (Taiwan) (known as the Taiwan 
CDC), through a routine laboratory-based screening and diagnosis 
system.10 All hospital-diagnosed cases of dengue must be reported 
to the Taiwan CDC for confirmation and subsequent surveillance. 
We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from 
the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), 
to investigate the risk of stroke in patients with dengue, and com-
pared this risk with the risk in a matched population of patients 
without dengue. We also performed subgroup analyses to exam-
ine the risk differences.
Methods
Data source
For this retrospective cohort study, we retrieved data concerning 
patients with dengue from the NHIRD, which enrolled about 
26 million residents in Taiwan between 1996 and 2013, covering 
more than 99% of the population of Taiwan. The database con-
tained detailed health care information for each enrollee, with 
encryption to protect personal privacy. Disease identification in 
the NHIRD follows the International Classification of Diseases, 
9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Previous studies 
have validated the accuracy of disease diagnosis in the NHIRD,

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Stroke is a severe neuro-
logic complication of dengue fever, 
described in only a few case reports. The 
incidence and risk factors for stroke in 
patients with dengue remain unclear. 
We conducted a population-based retro-
spective cohort study to investigate the 
risk of stroke in patients with dengue.
METHODS: Using data from the Taiwan 
National Health Insurance Research 
Database, we included a total of 13 787 
patients with dengue newly diagnosed 
between 2000 and 2012. The control 
cohort consisted of patients who did 
not have dengue, matched 1:1 by demo-
graphic characteristics and stroke-
related comorbidities. We calculated the 
cumulative incidences and hazard ratios 
(HRs) of stroke in both cohorts using 
Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox propor-
tional hazards regression.
RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of 
stroke was 5.33 per 1000 person-years in 
the dengue cohort and 3.72 per 1000 
person-years in the control cohort, with 
an adjusted HR of 1.16 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.01–1.32). The risk of 
stroke among patients with dengue was 
highest in the first 2 months after diag-
nosis (25.53 per 1000 person-years, 
adjusted HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.48–4.18).
INTERPRETATION: Dengue fever was 
associated with an increased risk of 
stroke in the first few months after diag-
nosis. The effect of dengue on stroke 
may be acute rather than chronic.

including diagnosis of ischemic stroke, showing high sensitivity 
(94.5%–97.3%) and high positive predictive value (88.4%–
97.8%).11,12 The Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan 
routinely reviews medical charts and claims to ensure the valid-
ity and accuracy of data coding in the NHIRD. 
Study population and outcome
The study population comprised 2 cohorts: the dengue and 
control cohorts. The dengue cohort consisted of all cases of 
dengue newly diagnosed in hospital between 2000 and 2012, 
specifically dengue fever (ICD-9-CM code 061) and dengue hem-
orrhagic fever (ICD-9-CM code 065.4). To avoid surveillance bias 
related to hospital admission, the control cohort consisted of 
hospital inpatients without a diagnosis of dengue. For each 
patient, the index date was defined as the date of first diagnosis 
of dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever (dengue cohort) 
or the admission date (control cohort). We defined patients 
with separate diagnosis dates during the follow-up period as 
having repeat dengue infections. 
The main study outcome was stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 430–
437), as documented in hospital records. We also assessed 
hemorrhagic stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 430–432) and ischemic 
stroke (ICD-9-CM codes 433–434) in our stratified analysis. We 
excluded patients with stroke or late effects of stroke (ICD-9-CM 
codes 430–438) occurring before the index date and those with 
missing information during follow-up. To control confounding 
related to other recent infections,13,14 we also excluded patients 
with any bacterial, viral or other infection within 2 months 
before the index date. 
We followed all participants from the index date to the first of 
date of outcome, date of death or end of 2013. We used a 
propensity-score matching method to match each patient with 
dengue with 1 control patient on the following characteristics: 
sex, age, year of index date and covariables listed in Table 1. 
The diagnosis of dengue was confirmed by laboratory test-
ing, according to any of the criteria of the Taiwan CDC: positive 
result on testing for dengue virus genome by real-time poly-
merase chain reaction; detection of dengue virus nonstructural 
protein 1 (NS1); positive seroconversion or a fourfold or greater 
increase in dengue-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immuno-
globulin G (IgG) antibodies from acute and convalescent paired 
serum samples; high-titre dengue-specific IgM/IgG antibody in 
acute serum samples; or isolation of dengue virus.10 The case 
definition for dengue hemorrhagic fever was proven dengue 
according to criteria of the WHO: signs of hemorrhagic tendency, 
thrombocytopenia (≤ 100 × 109/L) and evidence of plasma leak-
age (≥ 20% increase in hematocrit, clinical fluid accumulation or 
hypoproteinemia).2
Assessment of covariables
We adjusted the statistical model for comorbidities associated 
with stroke, including atrial fibrillation or flutter, cancer, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal failure, dia-
betes mellitus, dyslipidemia, heart failure, hypertension and 
ischemic heart disease.15,16 As a measure of the severity of stroke 
and underlying diseases, we assessed the total admission days 
for each participant.17,18 Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170994/-/DC1) lists the detailed 
ICD-9-CM codes for covariables in this study. We also used hospi-
talization records to identify comorbidities, using validated 
algorithms.19
Statistical analysis
We tested the differences in baseline characteristics between 
the 2 cohorts by χ2 and 2-sample Student t tests. We used a

multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, with adjustment 
for sex, age, covariables and the competing risk of death, to 
calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for stroke. We performed stratified subgroup 
analyses with both single-variable and multivariable Cox pro-
portional hazard models. We also conducted sensitivity analy-
ses with alternative controls matched by propensity score. We 
used the Kaplan–Meier method to compare the cumulative 
incidences of stroke between the 2 cohorts with the log-rank 
test. We verified the assumption of proportional hazards with 
the graphical plotting method. We tested the seasonality of 
stroke in this study with the χ2 goodness-of-fit test. 
We performed all statistical analyses with SAS statistical 
software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), with significance set at 
α = 0.05.
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
China Medical University Hospital (CMUH104-REC2–115-CR2), 
which waived the requirement for informed consent because 
data in the NHIRD are de-identified.
Results
After matching, 13 787 patients were included in each of the den-
gue and control cohorts (Figure 1). The 2 cohorts had nearly 
equal proportions of females and males (Table 1), although the 
slightly greater proportion of males in the control cohort was sta-
tistically significant. No other baseline characteristics were sig-
nificantly different. Most patients were between 31 and 60 years 
of age. The mean follow-up period was 7.58 and 7.89 years in the 
dengue and control groups, respectively. The top 5 reasons for 
admission for the control group were digestive disorders (e.g., 
peptic ulcer, diarrhea, hemorrhoids), cardiopulmonary disorders 
(e.g., hypertension, arrhythmia, ischemic heart), metabolic disor-
ders (e.g., diabetes, dyslipidemia), trauma and genitourinary dis-
orders (e.g., urolithiasis, chronic renal failure). 
The overall incidence rate of stroke was higher in the dengue 
cohort than in the control cohort (5.33 v. 3.72 per 1000 person-
years), with adjusted HR of 1.16 (95% CI 1.01–1.32) (Table 2). 
Females in the dengue cohort and patients without comorbidi-
ties in the dengue cohort had higher risk ratios for stroke than 
those in the control cohort (for females, adjusted HR 1.32, 95% CI

1.07–1.62; for those with no comorbidities, adjusted HR 1.31, 
95% CI 1.10–1.56). The proportion of patients with stroke who 
were admitted to the intensive care unit did not differ signifi-
cantly between the dengue and control cohorts (28/557 [5.0%] v. 
24/405 [5.9%], p = 0.5).
Time trends for risk of stroke
The incidence rate of stroke in the dengue cohort showed a time-
dependent trend during the follow-up period (Table 3). The risk of 
stroke in the dengue cohort, relative to the control cohort, was 
highest in the first 2 months (25.53 per 1000 person-years; 
adjusted HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.48–4.18) and then declined as the 
 
follow-up period increased. The risk of hemorrhagic and ischemic 
strokes showed a similar trend: highest in the first 2 months (for 
hemorrhagic stroke, adjusted HR 8.72, 95% CI 1.10–68.9; for isch-
emic stroke, adjusted HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.35–6.26). The difference in 
cumulative incidence of stroke between the 2 cohorts appeared 
early in the follow-up period (Appendix 2, Part 1, available at

was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The result of seasonality 
testing showed no significant seasonal effect (p = 0.5).
Risk factors for stroke
Appendix 2, Part 2 shows that patients with dengue hemorrhagic 
fever had the highest incidence rate of stroke (7.92 per 1000 person-
years), with an adjusted HR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.10–1.77), followed by 
patients with repeat dengue infection (6.85 per 1000 person-years; 
adjusted HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80–1.77) and patients with dengue fever 
(4.96 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00–1.31).
In the multivariable analysis of risk factors for stroke (Appendix 
2, Part 3), dengue was an independent risk factor for stroke 
(adjusted HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03–1.34). Diabetes was the highest risk 
factor for stroke (adjusted HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.66–2.43), followed by 
dyslipidemia (adjusted HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15–1.92), male sex 
(adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.29–1.67), hypertension (adjusted HR 
1.45, 95% CI 1.20–1.76) and age (adjusted HR 1.07 per year, 95% CI 
1.06–1.07). The sensitivity analyses with alternative controls 
matched by propensity score had results similar to those of the 
main analyses (Appendix 2, Parts 4 and 5).
Interpretation
This study showed that patients with dengue had an increased 
risk of stroke, and this risk was time-dependent, as high as 2.49 
times relative to control patients in the first 2 months. Patients 
with dengue who were male, who were older than 60 years or 
who had comorbidities had a higher incidence of stroke. The 
increased risk ratio for stroke in patients with dengue was 
greater for females and for those without comorbidity. It may be 
that male sex and comorbidities (including diabetes, dyslipid-
emia and hypertension) are stronger risk factors for stroke than 
dengue, and thus may mask the effects of dengue. 
We found that patients with dengue had a higher risk of both 
hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Compared with previous studies 
reporting more hemorrhagic strokes than ischemic strokes among 
patients with dengue,5–9 we observed more ischemic strokes. This 
difference may be related to universal screening for and surveil-
lance of dengue, and to high medical accessibility in Taiwan, which 
could improve the early detection of ischemic stroke among 
patients with dengue. It is uncertain whether reported dengue-
related hemorrhagic strokes were due to direct hemorrhage or to 
hemorrhagic conversion from ischemic stroke. Carod-Artal and 
associates4 also assumed that dengue-related ischemic strokes 
might be underestimated. In our study, patients with dengue hem-
orrhagic fever had a higher risk of stroke than patients with dengue 
fever, which indicates that the pathogenesis of dengue hemor-
rhagic fever may play a role in the occurrence of stroke. 
The mechanisms of dengue-related stroke are under investi-
gation. Multiple pathways have been proposed, with the major 
focus on endothelial dysfunction leading to plasma leakage.20,21 
Dengue virus could infect immune cells, inducing complex cas-
cades of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines 
and complement. The interaction of these mediators with endo-
thelial cells increases endothelial permeability and reduces the 
integrity of the endothelial barrier.20 Moreover, cross-reaction of 
anti-NS1 antibodies and direct viral infection of endothelial cells 
and platelets contribute to hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and 
plasma leakage.22,23 These immune-mediated mechanisms of 
dengue hemorrhagic fever in peripheral blood have also been 
found in the brain, where they cause breakdown of the blood–
brain barrier, leukocyte infiltration and local inflammation, fol-
lowed by vasoconstriction, thromboembolism, cerebral edema, 
ischemia and hemorrhage.4,21,24 A few case reports have shown 
atrial fibrillation as a complication of severe dengue, which may 
predispose these patients to stroke.25,26 
The time trends for dengue-related stroke in this study suggest 
that the effects of dengue on stroke may be acute rather than 
chronic. Previous studies found that the inflammatory mediators 
and antigen–antibody complex caused by dengue were tran-
sient.20,21 Furthermore, reported cases of dengue-related stroke 
have ranged from 2 to 22 days after onset of fever.5–9
Limitations
This study had some limitations. In Taiwan, cases of dengue are 
clustered seasonally.27 However, we found no significant season-
ality leading to bias for the stroke cases in our study. This finding 
corresponds to that of a prior study indicating that there is no 
seasonality to ischemic stroke in Taiwan.28 To ensure sufficient 
sample size and case ascertainment for patients with dengue, we 
used hospital records for the whole population of Taiwan; how-
ever, these records lack details about disease severity and medi-
cations. Therefore, we adjusted the data for total admission days, 
a measure that is highly correlated with disease severity.17,18 Total 
admission days and the proportion of patients admitted to the 
intensive care unit were comparable between the 2 study groups. 
To address potential confounding related to medications, we per-
formed a subgroup analysis of patients without comorbidities, 
who would be less likely to receive medications such as anti-
thrombotic or antihypertensive agents for stroke prevention; the 
results were consistent with the main analysis, with a stronger 
effect. Thus, disease severity and medications are unlikely to have 
biased our conclusions. Information about smoking, diet, body 
mass index, daily activity and ethnicity is not recorded in the 
NHIRD, so we could not adjust for these confounding variables. 
We used COPD as a surrogate in covariable adjustment. The 
NHIRD does not record laboratory data, so we were unable to per-
form further analysis on the effects of different dengue serotypes 
or the patients’ bleeding profiles or inflammatory markers. Given 
the inherent limitations of administrative data, systematic bias, 
such as coding errors, was inevitable. 
Conclusion
In this population-based study, the presence of dengue was 
associated with an increased risk of stroke. The effect of dengue 
on stroke may be acute rather than chronic. Clinicians in dengue-
endemic areas should be aware of this association, especially for 
patients with dengue who have neurologic deficits or for patients 
with stroke who have unexplained fever. Our findings may help 
with clinical risk evaluation and may serve as a basis for further 
investigation of the pathogenesis of dengue-related stroke.
