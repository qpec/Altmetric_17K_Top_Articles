Neuropathologic comorbidity and
cognitive impairment in the Nun and
Honolulu-Asia Aging Studies
ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine frequencies and relationships of 5 common neuropathologic abnormalities
identified at autopsy with late-life cognitive impairment and dementia in 2 different autopsy
panels.
Methods: The Nun Study (NS) and the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS) are population-based
investigations of brain aging that included repeated cognitive assessments and comprehensive
brain autopsies. The neuropathologic abnormalities assessed were Alzheimer disease (AD) neuro-
pathologic changes, neocortical Lewy bodies (LBs), hippocampal sclerosis, microinfarcts, and low
brain weight. Associations with screening tests for cognitive impairment were examined.
Results: Neuropathologic abnormalities occurred at levels ranging from 9.7% to 43%, and were
independently associated with cognitive impairment in both studies. Neocortical LBs and AD
changes were more frequent among the predominantly Caucasian NS women, while microinfarcts
were more common in the Japanese American HAAS men. Comorbidity was usual and very
strongly associated with cognitive impairment. Apparent cognitive resilience (no cognitive impair-
ment despite Braak stage V) was strongly associated with minimal or no comorbid abnormalities,
with fewer neocortical AD lesions, and weakly with longer interval between final testing and
autopsy.
Conclusions: Total burden of comorbid neuropathologic abnormalities, rather than any single lesion
type, was the most relevant determinant of cognitive impairment in both cohorts, often despite clin-
ical diagnosis of only AD. These findings emphasize challenges to dementia pathogenesis and inter-
vention research and to accurate diagnoses during life. Neurology® 2016;86:1000–1008

A 1997 Nun Study (NS) report demonstrated a powerful effect on cognitive function of comor-
bid brain infarcts and Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes, reporting an odds ratio
(OR) of 20.7 for dementia in participants with both high levels of AD neuropathologic changes
and cerebral infarcts.1 A 2002 report of 285 autopsied participants in the Honolulu-Asia Aging
Study (HAAS) provided a comprehensive description of 4 major neuropathologic abnormalities,
each robustly associated with late-life cognitive impairment: AD neuropathologic changes,
neocortical Lewy bodies (LBs), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and microinfarcts.2 Subsequent
HAAS analyses demonstrated that generalized brain atrophy may occur independently, as a
fifth common abnormality associated with cognitive impairment.3,4 Extensive analyses using
autopsy and clinical data have further documented both the multiplicity of neuropathologic

 abnormalities associated with late-life demen-
tia and the complex relationships between
them.5–12 Indeed, the high frequency of neu-
ropathologic comorbidity in older persons
with dementia has become widely appreciated
around the globe.13–21 In 2013, the first 22
brain autopsies from the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were re-
ported.22 All had been diagnosed during life
with AD dementia or AD-type mild cognitive
impairment. Of these, all but 4 had comorbid
abnormalities that might have contributed to
cognitive impairment. In 2015, it was shown
that the presence of multiple pathologic diag-
noses occurred more frequently in those with
dementia
compared
with
those
without
dementia in 183 participants of the 901
Study.23
Despite support for the significance of co-
morbid
neuropathologic
abnormalities
in
dementia in older adults, a large-scale compre-
hensive examination of their frequencies and
overall neurocognitive effects has not yet been
reported. Here we address this gap by parallel
analyses in 2 distinct population-based brain
autopsy panels, the predominantly Caucasian
NS women and the Japanese American HAAS
men.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The NS and HAAS are population-based
studies of health and functioning in late life.1,2,4 Some data used
for this report were included in previous publications.5,6,14,24,25
Histories, cohorts, and operations are described in e-Methods
on the Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org. The NS was
reviewed and approved by Universities of Kentucky and
Minnesota institutional review boards (IRBs). Participating
School Sisters of Notre Dame had agreed to autopsy prior to
death, with final authorizations provided by the Provincial
Leader;
an
autopsy
was
completed
for
.90%
of
NS
participants. The HAAS was reviewed and approved by the
Kuakini Hospital
IRB.
A
consent
form
was
signed
by
participants at every cycle (12 from 1965 to 2012), including
consent for use of information and materials for research
purposes by researchers and their colleagues, including NIH-
associated, with no ending of this permission. HAAS autopsy
acquisition procedure required notification of a participant’s
death by family member, hospital, medical examiner’s office, or
other source, with permission for autopsy and research use of
information provided by next of kin. Autopsies were completed
for 25% of HAAS participants, as previously reported.4
Cognitive function. NS primary cognitive testing was done
annually with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alz-
heimer’s Disease neuropsychological battery, which includes
the
Mini-Mental
State
Examination
(MMSE).26,27
HAAS
participants were screened at each examination with the
Cognitive Abilities and Screening Instrument (CASI).28 For NS
participants, we considered no or mild cognitive impairment for a
final MMSE score of 22 or greater, moderate cognitive
impairment as 17–21, and severe cognitive impairment as ,17.
For HAAS participants, we considered no or mild cognitive
impairment for a final CASI score of 74 or greater, moderate
cognitive
impairment
as
60–73.9,
and
severe
cognitive
impairment as ,60. The endpoint was a 3-level definition of
cognitive impairment (no or mild, moderate, or severe)
represented as 0, 1, or 11, respectively. Analyses comparing
cognitive impairment in a merged NS/HAAS dataset employed a
HAAS MMSE score calculated from MMSE items included in
the CASI (MMSEc) for that specific purpose28 (see e-Methods,
figure e-1, and tables e-1 through e-4).
Neuropathologic evaluations. Frequencies and correlates of
individual neuropathologic abnormalities were examined at 3 lev-
els of severity for each. We have shown previously that relative
risk for dementia from standardized AD neuropathologic change,
cerebral microinfarcts, and cortical LBs are similar, supporting
analogous contributions of these disease processes to dementia
in community settings14,29; similar analyses support analogous
contributions from HS and low brain weight.4,30 Thus, index
values of 1, 0.4, or 0 were assigned for severe, moderate, or neg-
ligible, respectively, based on prior analyses relating lesion meas-
ures to cognitive decline and dementia.2,4,31 Choosing 0.4 as the
intermediate level allowed us to distinguish the influence of cases
with a single severe lesion type (comorbid index 1.0) from those
with 2 or 3 moderate lesions (comorbid indices 0.8 and 1.2,
respectively).
Severe AD pathology (ADindex 5 1.0) was defined as Braak
stage V or VI, moderate (ADindex 5 0.4) as Braak stage IV, and
negligible (ADindex 5 0) as Braak stage ,IV.32 Severe LB
pathology (LBindex 5 1.0) was based on a McKeith score of 7
or higher (corresponding to a total unilateral frontal, parietal, and
temporal cortex count ,50),33 moderate (LBindex 5 0.4) on a
McKeith score of 2–6 (typically with LBs in the insula, anterior
cingulate, or amygdala, with fewer than 50 counted in frontal,
parietal, and temporal neocortex sections), and negligible
(LBindex 5 0) on no LBs observed or LBs limited to the pig-
mented brainstem nuclei. Severe HS (HSindex 5 0) was based on
bilateral occurrence, moderate (HSindex 5 0.4) on unilateral
occurrence, and negligible (HSindex 5 0) on evidence of the
abnormality.6,34
Severe microinfarcts (MINFindex
5
1.0)
required more than 3 microinfarcts counted on available neocor-
tical and striatal sections, moderate (MINFindex 5 0.4) required
2 or 3 microinfarcts, and negligible (MINFindex 5 0) meant one
or none were found. Severe low brain weight was defined as
,1,030 g for NS and ,1,135 g for HAAS, moderate was
1,030–1,099 g for NS and 1,135–1,199 g for HAAS, and neg-
ligibly low was defined as at least 1,100 g for NS and 1,200 g for
HAAS. The brain weight cutpoints corresponded to the ;25th
and ;50th percentiles for each cohort. A summary comorbid
index was computed by adding the 5 individual severity indices.
Possible values were 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.4,
2.6, 2.8, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 4.0, 4.4, and 5.0.
Statistical analysis. Analyses utilized SAS version 9.3 statistical
package and were independently validated using R statistical pro-
gramming language. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used
to model the relationship between cognitive status prior to death
and autopsy brain lesion scores. ORs of cognitive impairment
(0, 1, or 11) were assessed as functions of lesion distribution
using the cumulative logit model. This method provides inter-
cepts, p values, and single ORs for the independent variables,

 summarizing their associations with the endpoint across 3 levels
of cognitive test performance (see http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/
sas/dae/ologit.htm and http://support.sas.com/kb/24/315.html).
Analogous linear regression using MMSE as the continuous
dependent variable was fully confirmatory.
Another ordinal logistic regression model was reported esti-
mating proportional ORs for 5 levels of coprevalent lesion
index score as independent predictor variables modeling
dichotomized comorbidity index categories of 0 (reference),
0.4–0.8, 1–1.8, 2–2.4, and 2.6–4.4. Proportional odds as-
sumptions were not violated based on the proportional odds
score test (all p values . 0.05). Spearman correlation coeffi-
cients were used to assess the association of neuropathologic
lesion severity scores with each other and with last MMSE or
CASI score.
RESULTS Study participants. Descriptions of autop-
sied NS women and HAAS men are shown in table
1. In addition to obvious sex, ethnicity, and cultural
differences, years of schooling completed by NS
women was greater than among HAAS men (p ,
0.0001). Frequency distributions of final test scores
in the 2 cohorts (evident in table 1 and figure e-1)
demonstrate higher cognitive test scores in the
Sisters, especially in the no or mild range. Interval
elapsed between final cognitive testing and death
was substantially shorter for NS women, reflecting
their annual examinations and prearranged autop-
sies. Age at death was slightly older in the NS
(p , 0.0001). Severe cognitive impairment (assessed
by MMSE or MMSEc) was not significantly
different.
Prevalence and allied cognitive impairment for participant
brains stratified by 5 neuropathologic abnormalities
considered individually. As shown in table 2, prevalence
of severe AD changes (index 1.0) was slightly higher
among NS women (p 5 0.04), controlling for APOE
e4 positivity and age, while HAAS men had a substan-
tially higher prevalence of microinfarcts (p , 0.0001),
controlling for age at death. Neocortical LB severity
was greater in the NS (p , 0.0001). The proportions
with moderate or severe cognitive impairment gener-
ally increased with neuropathologic severities in both
cohorts.
Associations with cognitive impairment for 5 neuro-
pathologic abnormalities considered together in a single
logistic model. Table 3 shows parallel logistic regres-
sion modeling in the 2 cohorts, examining strengths
of association with cognitive impairment for the 5
lesion types considered simultaneously, each thereby
assessed while controlling for the others. This ensures
a relatively unbiased assessment of the unique
(unshared) contribution of each type of abnormality
to the endpoint, with proportional attribution to each
when one or more occur in the same brain. In general,
the results demonstrate independent influences of the
5 neuropathologic abnormalities, and greater effect of
greater severity.
ORs from logistic models are multiplicative,
meaning that the presence of multiple lesion types
substantially increases risk. While sample sizes pre-
clude a definitive assessment of the multiplicative
proportional odds assumption, stepwise regression
using the larger HAAS sample failed to implicate
nonmultiplicative effects, except for risk in the pres-
ence of both AD neuropathologic changes and mi-
croinfarcts, where a supramultiplicative effect was
suggested (p , 0.05), indicating even greater risk
than predicted when a combination of neuropath-
ologic abnormalities was observed. The irregular
associational patterns apparent for HS reflect insta-
bility attributable to the lower frequency of this
lesion type, and possibly to unilateral vs bilateral
differences.
We carried out separate linear regression analyses
at 5 Braak stage levels (,III, III, IV, V, VI) in the
merged NS/HAAS dataset using the MMSE (or
MMSEc) as the dependent variable (table e-2). Sig-
nificant associations with neocortical neurofibrillary
tangles (NFTs) and a weaker association with neocor-
tical neuritic plaque counts were limited to Braak V
and VI subsets. Very strong associations with non-
AD coprevalent neuropathologic abnormalities were
evident at all Braak levels. Cohort membership had
no apparent relationship with impairment in any of
the subsets once these other independent variables
were considered.

 In both cohorts, we observed nearly all possible
combinations of the 5 neuropathologic abnormali-
ties at frequencies approximating those expected
by chance, given their mutual independence (corre-
lation matrices in table e-5). Examples of comorbid
lesion heterogeneity are described and enumerated
in tables e-4 and e-6, with special consideration of
single abnormalities and comorbid admixtures that
included AD abnormalities. Successively lower final
MMSE
scores
were
observed
with
increasing
comorbidity, with or without contribution by AD
lesions.
Associations among the neuropathologic abnormalities.
Spearman correlation matrices (table e-5) demon-
strated that the 5 neuropathologic abnormalities were
largely independent in their occurrence in both co-
horts. Five substantial exceptions were evident: (1)
HSindex was associated with ADindex in both co-
horts. (2) ADindex was associated with lower brain
weight in the NS but not HAAS. (3) ADindex was
associated with LBindex in the NS but not HAAS.
(4) MINFindex was associated with low brain weight
in the HAAS but not NS. (5) HSindex was associated
with low brain weight in the HAAS but not NS.
Associations of cognitive impairment with comorbid
neuropathologic abnormalities. A comorbidity index
was computed by summing the 5 individual indices.
Figure 1 shows the percentage of participants with
moderate or severe cognitive impairment at each
observed level of the comorbidity index. The shaded
components of the bars indicate the percentage with
moderate (gray) or severe (black) cognitive impair-
ment. This illustrates an increase in cognitive impair-
ment with increasing lesion comorbidity in both
cohorts. Severe cognitive impairment was observed
in 33% of NS women and 35% of HAAS men with
a single, severe lesion type (comorbidity index 5 1).
In both autopsy panels, the proportion of participants
who had severe cognitive impairment at final testing
approached or reached 100% at comorbidity index
values between 2 and 3.

 The full comorbidity index (20 levels) was collapsed to
5 levels for these models. A dramatic association of
increasing cognitive impairment with increasing lesion
comorbidity is apparent. The very high ORs observed
with high comorbidity indices correspond to expect-
ations based on the multiplicative model apparent in
table 3.
Relationship of interval between testing and death with
apparent cognitive resilience. Substantial levels of AD
neuropathologic abnormalities are sometimes found
in participants whose cognitive function had been nor-
mal. This sort of clinical-pathologic disconcordance
has been labeled cognitive resilience. A prolonged
interval between cognitive assessments and autopsy
could certainly obscure cognitive decline, generating
apparent cognitive resilience, as could variables such
as the higher education levels found in NS participants.
We examined the frequency and predictors of
apparent cognitive resilience in parallel analyses in
the NS and HAAS, choosing cases where Braak stage
V was assigned in order to focus on the occurrence of
severe AD pathology that was nonetheless frequently
accompanied by no or mild cognitive impairment.
Apparent cognitive resilience in our analysis was
defined as no or mild cognitive impairment recog-
nized at final testing in an individual assigned Braak
stage V at autopsy.
A total of 44 NS participants received Braak stage
V. Average interval between final contact and death
was 1.05 years (SD 0.54, range 0.38–2.2) in the 17
(39%) with apparent cognitive resilience and 0.77
years (SD 0.77, range 0.03–1.9) in the 27 who had
been
cognitively
impaired.
Multivariate
logistic
regression analyses identified no significant associa-
tion of apparent cognitive resilience with the interval,
but marginal or statistically significant associations
with younger age (p 5 0.05), with lesser average neo-
cortical neuritic plaque counts (p 5 0.06), and with
few or no comorbid neuropathologic abnormalities
(p , 0.01).
A total of 121 HAAS participants were assigned
Braak stage V. Average interval between final contact
and death varied widely, with 38 autopsies within the
first year, 32 within the second, 14 within the third,
16 within the fourth, and 21, 4 or more years after
final cognitive testing. Levels of apparent cognitive
resilience in each of these years were 26%, 31%,
21%, 37%, and 52%, respectively. These percentages
indicate a dramatic increase in apparent cognitive
resilience after an interval of 3 years. Having few or
no comorbid non-AD lesions was strongly associated
with apparent cognitive resilience among participants
autopsied within 3 years of final testing (p 5 0.003).
No associations of apparent cognitive resilience were
observed with APOE e4 positivity, APOE e2 positiv-
ity, neocortical NFT counts, or neocortical neuritic
plaque counts.
DISCUSSION Our observations highlight the signif-
icance of comorbid neuropathologic abnormalities.
We observed substantial differences in strength
of
association
with
cognitive
impairment
for
the
common
dementia-related
neuropathologic
abnormalities considered individually (as shown in
tables 2 and 3) as compared with a much higher
likelihood of impairment when multiple types of
lesion occur in the same individual (as shown in
table
4).
Our
results
are
best
interpreted
as
reflecting a summation of geometrically measured
influences of independent abnormalities in the same
individual. For example, if a brain shows 2 lesion

The dependent variable is a 3-level variable for cognitive impairment based on final Mini-
Mental State Examination (NS) or Cognitive Abilities and Screening Instrument (HAAS)
score and representing no or mild (0), moderate (1), or severe (11) cognitive impairment.
Results were generated by ordinal logistic modeling with single ORs representing associa-
tions across all levels of impairment. Interactions between Alzheimer disease neuropatho-
logic changes and vascular abnormalities, LBs, or HS, and between low brain weight and any
of the other 4 lesions, were assessed; none reached statistical significance.

 types (i.e., 2 distinct disease processes), each of which
triples the likelihood of severe cognitive impairment,
one would expect a 9-fold increase in severe cognitive
impairment, compared with brains having negligible
levels of both. While not of great importance for most
younger persons, high levels of comorbidity may be
fundamental to late-life frailty and to aging itself.35
Although
the
frequencies
and
distributions
of
comorbidity
patterns
in
both

panels
approximate what would be expected by chance
given their individual prevalence levels and mutual
independence, higher comorbidity indices were far
more
common
in
participants
who
had
been
impaired.
Moreover,
the
effect
of
the
total
comorbidity burden was unrelated to the types of
lesion involved, including those of AD. Although
AD lesions were more common than the other
abnormalities
taken
individually,
most
of
the
impaired
participants
had
lesion
mixtures
that
included few or no AD abnormalities (shown in
table e-4).
Such
comorbidity
might
confound

research and the assembling of representative or
homogeneous cohorts, as needed for meaningful clin-
ical trials. For example, even though HAAS clinical
diagnoses of pure AD were reached with rigorous

Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria
(not shown), more than 75% had a low Braak stage
(,IV) or substantial levels of neocortical Lewy bod-
ies, microinfarcts, or HS. Interestingly, 75% is near
that recently reported for autopsied ADNI partici-
pants diagnosed with AD during life.22
The prevalence of Braak stage V or VI and associ-
ated cognitive impairment (shown in tables 2 and 3)
were both somewhat lower in HAAS participants.
Subsequent analyses suggested that this might be at
least partially attributable to the Braak stage failing to
fully represent the contributions of neocortical NFT
and neuritic amyloid plaque counts, which were pre-
sent in slightly higher levels in the somewhat older
NS participants (shown in table e-3).
Apparent cognitive resilience (no or mild cogni-
tive impairment despite Braak stage V) was strongly
associated with minimal or no comorbid abnormal-
ities and fewer neocortical AD lesions, and weakly
with longer interval between final testing and
autopsy. This sort of cognition-neuropathologic
discordance could be due to the development of
impairment during a protracted interval between
final testing and death. Evidence for this idea was
observed in HAAS when death occurred 4 or more
years after final testing, but was not observed in NS
analyses with shorter intervals. Further analyses
suggested that younger age and absence of comor-
bid lesions may contribute to apparent cognitive
resilience.
Weaknesses of our study include the range of in-
tervals between final cognitive assessment and death.
This interval was relatively short among NS partici-
pants, but longer in HAAS. In addition, we focused
only on final MMSE or CASI score without consid-
ering more extensive cognitive assessments, and with-
out considering prior scores or decline trajectory. Any
of these could influence recognized associations with
comorbidity patterns and neuropathology–cognition
relationships, as previously shown.11,12 Neither cohort
was fully representative of the US population, and
neither incorporated information from regular medi-
cal care. NS participants had a high average education
level, which could affect MMSE scores and thus our
definition of cognitive impairment. However, despite
differences in sex, ethnicity, and life experiences in
these 2 distinct cohorts, the similarities observed in
cognitive decline and brain abnormalities support the
generalizability of our findings.
