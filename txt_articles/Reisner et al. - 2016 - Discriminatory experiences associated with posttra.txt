Abstract
Discrimination has been shown to disproportionately burden transgender people; however, there 
has been a lack of clinical attention to the mental health sequelae of discrimination, including 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Additionally, few studies contextualize 
discrimination alongside other traumatic stressors in predicting PTSD symptomatology. The 
current study sought to fill these gaps. A community-based sample of 412 transgender adults 
(mean age 33, SD=13; 63% female-to-male spectrum; 19% people of color; 88% sampled online) 
completed a cross-sectional self-report survey of everyday discrimination experiences and PTSD 
symptoms. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between self-reported 
everyday discrimination experiences, number of attributed domains of discrimination, and PTSD 
symptoms, adjusting for prior trauma, sociodemographics, and psychosocial co-morbidity. The 
mean number of discrimination attributions endorsed was 4.8 (SD=2.4) and the five most 
frequently reported reasons for discrimination were: gender identity and/or expression (83%), 
masculine and feminine appearance (79%), sexual orientation (68%), sex (57%), and age (44%). 
Higher everyday discrimination scores (β=0.25; 95% CL=0.21–0.30) and greater number of 
attributed reasons for discrimination experiences (β=0.05; 95% CL=0.01–0.10) were 
independently associated with PTSD symptoms, even after adjusting for prior trauma experiences. 
Everyday discrimination experiences from multiple sources necessitate clinical consideration in 
treatment for PTSD symptoms in transgender people.

Transgender people, who have a gender identity that differs from their assigned sex at birth, 
experience high levels of prejudice, discrimination, and violence (Bockting, Miner, Romine, 
Hamilton, & Coleman, 2013; Grant, 2011; Lombardi, Wilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 2002; 
Mizock & Lewis, 2008; Shipherd, Maguen, Skidmore, & Abramovitz, 2011). A national 
study of more than 6,000 U.S. transgender respondents found that 63% reported an 
emotionally- or life-impairing experience of discrimination (Grant, 2011). Discrimination 
toward transgender people occurs across settings (e.g., employment, healthcare) and can be 
both chronic (e.g., interpersonal rejection) and acute (e.g., victimization) (Lombardi, 2009; 
Mizock & Lewis, 2008; Mizock & Mueser, 2014). Physical violence and sexual assault due 
to transgender identity are also highly prevalent across the life course (Clements-Nolle, 
Marx, & Katz, 2006; Grant, 2011; Stotzer, 2009). Consistent with minority stress theory 
(Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Meyer, 2003b), both violent and non-violent forms of 
discrimination are associated with adverse mental health outcomes in transgender people, 
including depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and substance abuse (Grant, 2011; 
Lombardi, et al., 2002).
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a stress-sensitive disorder associated with significant 
morbidity and impairment (Kessler, 2000), represents one of the most common mental 
health conditions to arise from direct or vicarious exposure to life-threatening events, serious 
injury, or sexual assault (APA, 2013). PTSD is characterized by four key symptoms: (1) 
persistent intrusive thoughts or re-experiencing of the event; (2) avoidance of stimuli 
associated with the event; (3) negative cognitions and mood such as emotional numbing and 
detachment from others; and (4) changes in arousal or reactivity such as hypervigilance, 
irritability, exaggerated startle response, or self-destructive reckless behavior (APA, 2013). 
While PTSD affects an estimated 6.8% of the U.S. general adult population (Kessler et al., 
2005), prevalence estimates in transgender samples range from 18 to 61% (Rowe, Santos, 
McFarland, & Wilson, 2015; Shipherd, et al., 2011; Valera, Sawyer, & Schiraldi, 2001; 
Wharton, 2007) and greater severity and frequency of emotional numbing, behavioral 
avoidance, and physiological arousal relative to non-transgender people have been reported 
(Wilson, 2013).
Despite the high prevalence of discrimination and PTSD in transgender people, the 
relationship between these phenomena remains understudied. A possible explanation for the 
dearth of research in this area is that exposure to non-violent forms of discrimination may 
not meet DSM criteria for a traumatic event (e.g., Criterion A). However, like acute 
traumatic stress, chronic and persistent threats to one’s identity in the form of everyday 
discrimination threaten a person’s core human needs for trust, understanding, control and 
belonging, with harmful mental health effects (Swim & Thomas, 2006). Further, trauma and 
discrimination, whether acute or chronic, produce similar stress responses, including 
avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic or discriminatory event (Bockting, et al., 
2013; Carter & Forsyth, 2010; Meyer, 2003b; Pascoe & Richman, 2009) and hypervigilance

 (e.g., anticipatory stress) about the possibility of future trauma or discrimination (Bockting, 
et al., 2013; Carter & Forsyth, 2010; Meyer, 2013; Pachankis, Goldfried, & Ramrattan, 
2008), as well as similar physiological responses in reaction to acute laboratory-based 
stressors (Hatzenbuehler & McLaughlin, 2014). Despite evidence that traumatic stress 
exposure and stigma-related stress operate through similar minority stress processes (Meyer, 
2003b), no studies have explored the relationship between discrimination and PTSD 
symptoms in transgender people, a highly stigmatized and underserved group.
In addition to known traumatic stressors such as childhood physical and/or sexual abuse and 
intimate partner violence, which increase probability of PTSD symptoms (Brewin, Andrews, 
& Valentine, 2000; Golding, 1999), a potential source of additional traumatic stress 
responses for transgender people is exposure to acts of discrimination based on gender 
identity or gender presentation. In addition, qualitative studies have illustrated that 
transgender individuals experience discrimination and oppression based on their gender 
identity and intersecting stigmatized identities (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, social class, and 
citizenship status) (Daley, Solomon, Newman, & Mishna, 2008; de Vries, 2014; Gamarel, 
Walker, Rivera, & Golub, 2014; Sevelius, 2013).
While research indicates that individuals with multiple identities often incorporate these 
identities into a single unified sense of self (McAdams, 1997; Meyer, 2010; Singer, 2004), 
multiple identities can provoke different forms of discrimination in diverse contexts. Indeed, 
multiple minority statuses can lead to greater discrimination exposure and result in greater 
erosion of core needs, as well as hypervigilance, avoidance, and physiological stress 
responses (e.g. Pascoe & Richman, 2009). For example, a study of 873 Latino and Black 
adults in New York City found that participants who experienced multiple domains of 
discrimination related to age, race, gender, weight, income, religion, mental or physical 
illness, immigration status, or sexual orientation, had a greater probability of reporting poor 
mental health than those who experienced no discrimination or discrimination in only one 
domain (Stuber, Galea, Ahern, Blaney, & Fuller, 2003). Similarly, a national study of 1,052 
youth found that multiply disadvantaged youth faced greater exposure to multiple forms of 
discrimination than their more advantaged counterparts, and experiencing numerous forms 
of discrimination was more strongly associated with adverse mental and physical health 
outcomes than experiencing only one form of disadvantage (Grollman, 2012). Given that 
many transgender people may possess multiple stigmatized identities or characteristics (e.g., 
minority race/ethnicity, older age, low SES) and report discrimination and distress 
(Bockting, et al., 2013; Daley, et al., 2008; de Vries, 2014; Gamarel, Walker, et al., 2014; 
Golub & Gamarel, 2013; Reisner, Bailey, & Sevelius, 2014; Sevelius, 2013; Witten, 2009), 
the additive stress associated with experiencing discrimination based on multiple minority 
stigmas represents an important area for research.
Appearance-related stigma represents a possible mechanism through which transgender 
people experience discrimination. Appearance-related stigma refers to the extent to which 
one’s appearance produces a negative reaction in others (Jones, Farina, Hastorf, & French, 
1984). Transgender individuals who do not conform to the socially sanctioned expression of 
their assigned sex at birth often experience mistreatment by others who view their self-
expression as non-normative (Bockting, et al., 2013). Conversely, transgender individuals

 with high visual conformity are said to have “passing privilege” in that their stigma (i.e., 
being transgender) is concealable (Jones, et al., 1984) and they are therefore able to hide 
their transgender status and avoid mistreatment (Sevelius, 2013; Xavier, 1999). Social (i.e., 
living full-time in one’s gender) and medical gender affirmation (i.e., hormones/surgery to 
masculinize/feminize) processes may impact the extent to which a transgender person 
appears more or less visually gender nonconforming, in turn impacting exposure to 
experiences of discrimination; however, the relationship between gender affirmation 
processes and experiences of discrimination are understudied.
Despite accumulating evidence that transgender people evince high prevalence of 
discrimination and PTSD symptoms, critical questions remain unanswered as to whether 
experiencing discrimination, as well as discrimination based on multiple stigmatized 
identities, is associated with PTSD symptoms. The purpose of this study was to: (1) examine 
discrimination experiences in a sample of transgender adults and explore reasons attributed 
to discrimination; (2) explore whether endorsing a higher number of attributed reasons for 
discrimination is associated with more PTSD symptoms; (3) identify whether gender 
affirmation processes are associated with discrimination experiences, including whether 
higher visible gender nonconformity is a risk factor and whether social transition or medical 
gender affirmation are protective factors for PTSD symptoms; and (4) evaluate whether 
discrimination experiences and the number of attributed domains are independently 
associated with elevated PTSD symptoms, after adjustment for some known traumatic 
stressors (e.g., childhood abuse and intimate partner violence).
Method
Participants and Procedures
A community-based sample of 452 transgender and gender nonconforming Massachusetts 
residents, ages 18 to 75 years, were purposively sampled from August-December 2013 for 
Project VOICE (Voicing Our Individual and Community Experiences), a study designed to 
examine the association between social stress and health. Participants were recruited via 
transgender-specific online and in-person venues. The majority (88%) were sampled online 
(via transgender electronic listservs, emails, web postings at local community-based 
websites, and social networking sites); 12% were sampled in-person (completed the survey 
via electronic tablets provided by the research team onsite at transgender community events, 
local social programming, and other gatherings). Eligible respondents were ages 18 years or 
older, self-identified as transgender or gender nonconforming, lived in Massachusetts for at 
least 3 months in the last year, and had the ability to read/write in either English or Spanish. 
Participants completed a one-time survey assessing demographics, experiences of 
discrimination and victimization, and health. Participants provided informed consent before 
beginning the survey. Using community-based participatory research principles (Leung, Yen, 
& Minkler, 2004), between March–July 2013 a team of community-based advocates, 
transgender leaders, researchers, and LGBT policy experts, working with gender minority 
people in the Commonwealth, together created the survey instrument and data collection 
plan. Whenever possible, validated questions or survey items adapted from prior transgender 
health research were utilized to ensure comparability of findings, including those from such

 sources as the U.S. National Transgender Discrimination Survey (Reisner, Conron, Scout, et 
al., 2014) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (CDC, 2012). The 
survey was designed for a 5th grade reading level. Participants could opt to be entered into a 
community raffle for two tablet computers. We followed best practices for Internet research 
with transgender people, including initial usability and pilot testing, quality management 
processes to ensure unduplicated responses and valid study respondents (Miner, Bockting, 
Romine, & Raman, 2011) to ensure the integrity and validity of online data collected 
(Reisner et al., 2015). Two versions of the Project VOICE survey were fielded. The short 
version did not ask participants about discrimination experiences; thus, only participants 
who completed the long survey were included in the analytic sample (n=412). The survey 
was translated and back translated into Spanish, with input from transgender community 
members to ensure cultural relevance and appropriate translation. Four respondents 
completed surveys in Spanish. All study activities were IRB-approved.
Measures
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms—PTSD symptoms were assessed 
with a 4-item scale designed for primary care settings (Ouimette, Wade, Prins, & Schohn, 
2008; Prins et al., 2003) recommended by the U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs (U.S. 
Department of Veteran’s Affairs, 2014). Participants were asked: “In your life, have you ever 
had any experience that was so frightening, horrible, or upsetting that, in the past month you: 
(1) Have had nightmares about it or thought about it when you did not want to? (2) Tried 
hard not to think about it or went out of your way to avoid situations that reminded you of it? 
(3) Were constantly on guard, watchful, or easily startled? (4) Felt numb or detached from 
others, activities, or your surroundings?” Participants responded to each item using binary 
(yes/no) responses. The PC-PTSD has a test-retest Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.83 
(p<0.001), correlates highly with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (Blake et al., 
1995) 0.83 (p<0.001), and has an overall diagnostic accuracy of 85% (Prins, et al., 2003; 
Prins et al., 2004). The scale has also demonstrated good internal consistency in non-
transgender samples (Cronbach’s alpha ranges from 0.79–0.93) (Maguen et al., 2010; 
Mason, Mennis, & Schmidt, 2011; Sayer et al., 2011). This study represent the first time this 
measure has been used in a sample of transgender individuals. A factor analysis supported a 
single factor solution in the current study data (Eigenvalue=2.9; proportion of variance 
explained (PVE)=71.9%). Items were summed and scores ranged from 0–4; higher scores 
reflected more traumatic stress symptoms (α=0.87 in the current study).
Discrimination Experiences—Participants completed the Everyday Discrimination 
Scale, which consists of 11 items assessing the frequency of participants’ experiences of 
everyday discrimination in the past 12 months on a Likert scale ranging from 0=“never” to 
4=“very often.” Sample items: “You have been treated with less courtesy than other people;” 
“People have acted as if they think you are not smart” (Krieger, Smith, Naishadham, 
Hartman, & Barbeau, 2005; Williams, Yan, Jackson, & Anderson, 1997). The Everyday 
Discrimination Scale has demonstrated good reliability and validity (Taylor, Kamarck, & 
Shiffman, 2004; Williams et al., 2012; Williams, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2003). In sample of 
LGBT participants, Cronbach’s alpha for the discrimination scale was 0.94, and 
discrimination scores were correlated positively with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and

 substance use (Gamarel, Reisner, Laurenceau, Nemoto, & Operario, 2014; Gamarel, 
Reisner, Parsons, & Golub, 2012; Gordon & Meyer, 2008; S. L. Reisner, White, Bradford, & 
Mimiaga, 2014). A factor analysis confirmed a single factor solution in the current dataset 
(Eigenvalue=6.9; PVE=62.9%). Items were summed and scores ranged from 0–44, with 
higher scores indicating higher levels of everyday discrimination experiences (α=0.94 in 
current dataset).
Reasons Attributed to Discrimination—Fourteen items assessed participants’ 
attributed reasons for everyday discrimination using binary (yes/no) responses. Domains 
included those from prior research (Gordon & Meyer, 2008; Williams, et al., 1997) and 
theoretically relevant to this study: age, sex, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual 
orientation, disability, education or income level, weight, gender expression, masculine/
feminine appearance, other aspect of appearance, and other reason. The number of attributed 
domains was summed; scores ranged from 0–14 with higher scores indicating higher 
number of domains of discrimination endorsed.
Other forms of trauma—Participants completed brief measures of childhood abuse and 
intimate partner violence used in prior research (Reisner, Falb, Wagenen, Grasso, & 
Bradford, 2013). Childhood abuse was queried by asking: “Were you ever physically or 
sexually abused as a child under age 15 years-old?” Participants who indicated “yes” were 
compared to those who indicated “no.” Similarly, intimate partner violence was assessed 
with the item: “Have you ever been slapped, punched, kicked, beaten up, or otherwise 
physically or sexually hurt by your spouse (or former spouse), a boyfriend/girlfriend, or 
some other intimate partner?” These items are similar to other screening instruments 
commonly used to assess childhood abuse and IPV in clinical settings (Basile, Hertz, & 
Back, 2007; Hulme, 2004; McFarlane, Parker, Soeken, & Bullock, 1992). Previous use of 
the scale with LGBT populations have found associations with adverse mental health 
outcomes (S.L. Reisner, et al., 2013).
Sociodemographics—Age in years was assessed continuously. Gender was assessed 
using a two-step method (S.L. Reisner, Conron, Tardiff, et al., 2014) asking: (1) assigned sex 
at birth (female, male) and (2) current gender identity (man, woman, female-to-male (FTM)/
trans man, male-to-female (MTF)/trans woman, genderqueer, gender variant, gender 
nonconforming, other). The two items were cross-tabulated to categorize participants as 
being on the female-to-male (FTM) trans masculine or male-to-female (MTF) trans feminine 
spectrum according to their natal sex. Participants assigned female at birth with a current 
nonbinary gender identity were categorized as FTM trans masculine; those assigned male at 
birth with a current nonbinary gender identity were characterized as MTF trans feminine. An 
indicator of non-binary gender was created to compare respondents with non-binary gender 
identities (gender variant, genderqueer, androgynous, gender nonconforming) to those with 
binary gender identities (man, woman, FTM, MTF). We note that intersex is not an assigned 
sex at birth; all infants, including those who are intersex, are assigned either a male or 
female sex at birth on their birth certificate. Social gender transition was assessed by asking 
participants if they lived full-time in their felt gender identity (yes/no). Medical gender 
affirmation was operationalized as being on cross-sex hormone therapy and/or having had

 gender-related reassignment surgery (yes/no). High visual gender nonconformity was coded 
as those who “most of the time” or “always” endorsed the statement: “People can tell I’m 
transgender even if I don’t tell them” and were compared to those who endorsed “never,” 
“occasionally,” or “sometimes.” Race/ethnicity captured whether participants were white 
(non-Hispanic), Black (non-Hispanic), Latino/Hispanic, Other race/ethnicity, and 
Multiracial. Participants were categorized as people of color (POC) or non-Hispanic white. 
Perceived income ranged from 0=“no income” to 3=“high income/upper class.” Educational 
attainment was queried and ranged from 1=“high school or less” to 4=“graduate school.” 
Unstable housing was operationalized as “rarely,” “sometimes,” or “often” having trouble 
“finding a safe place to hang out or sleep (housing)” in the past 12 months and compared to 
stable housing (i.e., “never” having such trouble). Sexual orientation was assessed by asking 
respondents how they identify with response options as “heterosexual/straight,” “lesbian/
gay,” “bisexual,” “queer,” or “another sexual orientation.” Sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, queer, another sexual orientation) respondents were compared to non-sexual 
minority (i.e., heterosexual, straight) respondents. Survey mode (online or in-person) was 
included as a covariate.
Depressive symptoms—Participants completed the 10-item Center of Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) (Radloff, 1977) to assess past-week depressive 
symptoms. In the current dataset, Cronbach’s α=0.88; a two factor solution was supported 
(cumulative PVE=60.7%) for negative affect (factor 1, Eigenvalue=4.9) and positive affect 
(factor 2, Eigenvalue=1.1), consistent with previous validation studies (Bradley, Bagnell, & 
Brannen, 2010; Zhang et al., 2012). Scores were summed such that higher scores indicated 
higher depressive symptoms. A score of 10 or more was operationalized to indicate a 
positive screen for clinically significant depression as recommended in prior research 
(Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, & Patrick, 1994). The CES-D-10 has been shown to correlate 
highly with the 20-item CES-D (Carpenter et al., 1998), which is sensitive in detecting 
clinical diagnoses of major depressive disorder. Furthermore, Cronbach’s alpha for the CES-
D scale was 0.88 in a sample of transgender adults (Reisner, et al., 2014).
Substance use—Participants were asked if they had used marijuana, cocaine, crack, club 
drug, methamphetamine, heroin, poppers, hallucinogens, downers, painkillers, or any other 
drug in the past 12-months (Yes/No). Past-12 month polydrug drug use was assessed by 
summing the number of drugs participants reported in the last 12 months. Participants using 
two or more drugs were compared to those reporting none or one drug.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in SAS v9.4.1. Distributions of individual items were 
assessed, including missingness. Because missingness violated the missing completely at 
random assumption required for valid statistical inferences using listwise deletion (Allison, 
2003), data were multiply imputed. A fully conditional specification imputation method was 
used shown to perform well in many different scenarios of missingness (Lee & Carlin, 2010; 
van Buuren, 2007; van Buuren, Brand, Groothuis-Oudshoorn, & Rubin, 2006). All 
subsequent analyses were conducted using the imputed data.

 Univariate statistics were used to summarize the distribution of variables (mean, standard 
deviation [SD], frequencies, proportion). Two-sided tests were conducted with statistical 
significance at alpha=0.05. Tests for normality were conducted to ensure statistical 
assumptions for linear regression models were tenable. Analyses then examined whether any 
sociodemographic, depressive symptoms or substance use factors were associated with 
everyday experiences of discrimination to identify those groups who reported higher 
discrimination experiences. A linear multivariable regression model was fit (Model 1), 
regressing everyday discrimination scores on: number of reasons attributed to discrimination 
experiences (continuous), other traumatic experiences (binary) [childhood abuse, intimate 
partner violence], and sociodemographics [age, income, education (each continuous); FTM 
spectrum, non-binary gender identity, live full-time, medical gender affirmation, high visual 
gender nonconformity, POC, unstably housed, sexual minority, online survey mode, past-
week depression, polydrug use (each binary)]. Next, analyses examined whether everyday 
experiences of discrimination were statistically associated with PTSD symptom scores 
(Model 2), adjusting for all variables described in Model 1. Multicollinearity diagnostics 
were computed for all regression models using variance inflation factor (VIF) values. All 
VIF values were less than 10, indicating no detection of multicollinearity (Jou, Huang, & 
Cho, 2014).
Age, everyday discrimination experiences scale scores, number of reasons attributed to 
discrimination, and PTSD symptoms were transformed to z-scores (mean=0, SD=1) to 
facilitate interpretation. The regression of a standardized variable (e.g., PTSD symptoms) on 
a standardized predictor (e.g., everyday discrimination experiences) generates standardized 
slopes that range from −1.0 and 1.0 (beta weights). For a binary predictor (e.g., childhood 
abuse yes/no), the standardized slope represents the difference between the means of the two 
groups on the outcome. Because the outcome variable is standardized (z-scored), the mean 
differences are in SD. The slope (beta) or difference between the means equals Cohen’s d 
(effect size estimates). A Cohen’s d of 0.20 (i.e., a fifth of a standard deviation) is a small 
effect, 0.50 (i.e., half a SD) a medium effect, and 0.80 a large effect (Cohen, 1988). Beta 
coefficients can therefore be interpreted in terms of SD unit changes in the statistical 
predictor relative to the outcome.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 presents characteristics of study sample. Participants had a mean age of 32.7 
(SD=12.8); 62.6% were FTM spectrum; 59.7% identified their gender as binary; 19.2% 
were POC (2.9% Black, 9.0% Latino/Hispanic, 2.9% Other race, 4.4% Multiracial). There 
was high prevalence of childhood abuse age <15 years (46.6%), intimate partner violence 
(33.3%), depression (26.5%), polydrug use (18.5%), and unstable housing (25.5%). PTSD 
symptom scores ranged from 0 to 4 (M=1.95, SD=1.71). Overall, 44.4% of the sample met 
criteria for probable PTSD (PTSD symptom score 3+) (Prins, et al., 2003). The mean 
everyday discrimination score was 19.9 (SD=9.6). The mean number of discrimination 
attributions was 4.8 (SD=2.4). The five most frequently reported reasons attributed to 
discrimination were: gender identity and/or expression (83.2%), how masculine/feminine

 you appear (78.6%), sexual orientation (68.0%), sex (assigned sex at birth) (56.8%), and age 
(43.5%) (Table 2). Linear models adjusted for survey mode (online vs in-person) are 
presented in Table 3 showing the statistically significant associations of PTSD symptoms, 
everyday discrimination experiences, and number of attributed domains of discrimination.
Everyday Discrimination Experiences (Table 4)
As shown in Model 1, FTM spectrum, POC, high visual gender nonconformity, greater 
number of reasons attributed to discrimination, childhood abuse age <15 years, past-week 
depression, and unstable housing were each independently and significantly associated with 
increased everyday discrimination scores. In this same model, sexual minority status, higher 
income, non-binary gender, and online sampling were each protective and associated with 
lower everyday discrimination scores.
PTSD Symptoms (Table 4)
In Model 2, higher everyday discrimination scores, greater number of attributed reasons for 
discrimination, childhood abuse age <15 years, intimate partner violence, social gender 
transition (living full-time in one’s identified gender–distinct from medical gender 
affirmation), high visual gender nonconformity, unstable housing, past-week depression, and 
past-12 month polydrug use were each independently and significantly associated with 
higher PTSD scores. On the contrary, younger age, FTM spectrum gender, medical gender 
affirmation, and online sampling were each independently and significantly associated with 
lower PTSD scores.
Discussion
In this community-based sample of transgender adults, associations were found between 
discrimination experiences and PTSD symptoms. The present findings are consistent with a 
burgeoning body of evidence documenting elevated risk for mental health problems among 
individuals who experience discrimination (Diaz, Ayala, Bein, Henne, & Marin, 2001; 
Landrine & Klonoff, 1996; Williams, et al., 2003), including transgender people (Shipherd, 
et al., 2011). Notably, the prevalence of PTSD symptoms reported here is much higher than 
national studies of the general population (Kessler, et al., 2005).
Many participants experienced known sources of trauma including childhood abuse and 
intimate partner violence, but the association between discrimination experiences and PTSD 
symptoms existed after statistically adjusting for these. Further, the magnitude of the 
association between discrimination and PTSD symptoms (β=0.25) was comparable to the 
magnitude of association between childhood abuse and PTSD symptoms (β=0.29), and 
exceeded the magnitude of association between intimate partner violence and PTSD 
symptoms (β=0.18). In other words, discrimination experiences were associated with PTSD 
symptoms regardless of reporting of other known traumatic experiences. These findings 
point to the importance of identifying mechanisms that explain associations between 
discrimination and PTSD symptoms, including both interpersonal and intrapersonal 
pathways (Hatzenbuehler, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Dovidio, 2009). For example, prior evidence 
suggests that emotion dysregulation (i.e., difficulty monitoring, evaluating, and modifying

 emotional reactions) mediates associations between daily experiences of discrimination and 
subsequent daily depressive symptoms (Hatzenbuehler, et al., 2009) and explains evaluated 
PTSD symptoms in several samples (Bowleg et al., 2014).
In addition, a greater number of domains attributed to discrimination was independently 
associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms in the present study, suggesting that co-
occurrence of stigmatized minority statuses may be associated with greater exposure to 
discrimination, as well as more PTSD symptoms. Findings are consistent with the view that 
an individual’s health cannot be fully understood by examining isolated systems of social 
oppression (Crenshaw, 1991). Individuals hold multiple co-existing identities, typically 
experienced as a unified self (Crenshaw, 1991; Hembree et al., 2009); however possessing 
multiple stigmatized identities might increase the chances of experiencing discrimination 
toward any one of those identities (Stuber et al., 2003). Thus, individuals who experience 
multiple forms of discrimination may be at high risk of poor mental health as a result of their 
disproportionate exposure to social oppressions, which can diminish coping resources and 
may exacerbate PTSD symptoms (Cole, 2009; Mizock & Mueser, 2014). These results are 
particularly important in light of research that suggests coping with cumulative stressors is 
associated with wear and tear on biological systems, termed “allostatic load” (Geronimus, 
1992; McEwen & Stellar, 1993). These findings highlight the importance of examining 
multiple forms of discrimination, rather than a singular stressor, in the mental health of 
transgender people.
Gender affirmation—an interpersonal process through which a person’s gender identity is 
socially recognized—has been theorized as a key determinant of health for transgender 
people of color (Sevelius, 2013). This study found that gender affirmation processes are 
important to consider in understanding PTSD symptoms in transgender people more 
broadly. Consistent with prior research (Bockting, et al., 2013; Grant, 2011), visibly gender 
nonconforming participants in the present study had significantly higher discrimination 
scores. No similar differences in discrimination were found for either social transition (i.e., 
living full-time) or medical gender affirmation (i.e., hormones and/or surgery). However, 
high visual gender nonconformity and social transition were each associated with increased 
PTSD symptoms. Medical gender affirmation was significantly protective and associated 
with significantly decreased PTSD symptoms, which is consistent with prior research 
showing that medical gender affirmation is associated with positive mental health outcomes 
in transgender people (Colizzi, Costa, & Todarello, 2014; Gómez-Gil et al., 2012; Keo-
Meier et al., 2014; E. C. Wilson, Chen, Arayasirikul, Wenzel, & Raymond, 2015).
Of note, other known social determinants of health were also associated with PTSD 
symptoms in this sample, including younger age (Chiu, deRoon-Cassini, & Brasel, 2011). 
An interesting gender difference emerged: MTFs had significantly higher PTSD scores than 
FTMs. This difference is consistent with U.S. general population data showing 
approximately two-fold increased risk for PTSD in females than males (e.g., Tolin & Foa, 
2006); however, conflation of sex and gender in much epidemiologic research (Krieger, 
2003) makes the sex- and gender-linked pathways shaping differences in psychiatric 
conditions difficult to interpret (Tolin & Foa, 2006). Unstable housing was associated with 
elevated PTSD symptoms, supporting low socioeconomic status as a risk factor (Bender, 
Reisner et al.

 Ferguson, Thompson, Komlo, & Pollio, 2010). Additionally, childhood abuse, intimate 
partner violence, depression, and polydrug use statistically predicted PTSD symptoms in this 
sample, supporting known PTSD-specific psychosocial risk factors in the U.S. general 
population for transgender people (Balan et al., 2013; O’Donnell, Creamer, & Pattison, 
2014; Ullman, Relyea, Peter-Hagene, & Vasquez, 2013).
Several limitations must be noted. As a cross-sectional study, findings demonstrate 
associations only; causality cannot be inferred. The presence of “Criterion A” or the 
“stressor criterion” (Breslau & Kessler, 2001) was not necessary for inclusion in this study, 
nor a prerequisite for assessment of PTSD symptoms. Given that 90% or more of the general 
population will experience a traumatic event in their lifetime (Breslau & Kessler, 2001; 
Breslau et al., 1998), assessment of traumatic exposure was excluded from the screening 
items (Prins, et al., 2003). The brief screening assessment for PTSD symptoms used in this 
study was designed for primary care settings, not for research purposes. Discrimination and 
PTSD symptoms were both self-reported subjective measures. Future research utilizing 
objective measures (e.g., clinician-assessed PTSD diagnosis) is needed to circumvent the 
possibility that self-reported discrimination experiences are confounded with mental health 
status (Meyer, 2003a). In addition, future mixed-methods research to explore the attributed 
reasons (e.g., sex, gender, race) for discrimination would make a valuable contribution. For 
example, the most frequent reason attributed to discrimination experiences was gender 
identity and/or expression; however, more than half of the sample reported experiencing 
discrimination due to sex. A more in-depth understanding of transgender experiences and 
perceptions regarding sex- and gender-based discrimination is warranted. There is 
substantial heterogeneity of trauma responses (Bonanno & Mancini, 2012), which the 
current study was not designed to assess. Future studies would benefit from considering 
transgender identity formation alongside gender affirmation (Devor, 2004). Children or 
adolescents may be abused because of discrimination related to their gender nonconforming 
presentation (Grossman & Howell, 2005); similarly, intimate partner violence may occur 
due to discrimination related to a partner’s transgender status (Ard & Makadon, 2011; 
Brennan et al., 2012; Stotzer, 2009). Thus, childhood abuse and intimate partner violence 
can be driven by discrimination and may therefore not be necessarily distinct from it. 
Although the items for childhood abuse and intimate partner violence have been used in 
prior research (Reisner, et al., 2013), their brief single-item nature could be improved in 
future research by utilizing screeners with established psychometric properties.
Despite the limitations, our findings have implications for treatment interventions. (Maguen, 
Shipherd, & Harris, 2005). Considering everyday experiences of multiple forms of 
discrimination in PTSD treatment represents a critical aspect of clinical care for traumatized 
transgender people. Integrating evidenced-based treatments for PTSD, such as cognitive 
behavioral interventions (Forneris et al., 2013; Kar, 2011; Maguen, et al., 2005; Resick, 
Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002), with gender minority stress models (Hendricks & 
Testa, 2012) will ensure cultural responsiveness of interventions to meet the unique needs of 
transgender communities. Coping resources can act as a buffer against discrimination 
(Thoits, 1991); thus, skills-focused coping may represent an important component of clinical 
intervention. Given that only a minority of individuals who experience traumatic stressors 
develop PTSD symptomatology (Yehuda & McFarlane, 1995) and that the majority of

 transgender individuals demonstrate resilience in a context of pervasive societal oppressions 
(Mizock & Lewis, 2008), uncovering the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying 
vulnerability to and protection against PTSD represents a key future research direction with 
this population. Given that online respondents had statistically significantly lower 
discrimination and PTSD symptom scores relative to those completing the survey in-person, 
community efforts that engage transgender people “face-to-face” represent an important way 
of transgender people at-risk social stress and PTSD symptomatology.
