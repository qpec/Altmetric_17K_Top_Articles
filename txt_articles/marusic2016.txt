Background
Improper practices and unprofessional conduct in clinical research have been shown to waste a significant portion of healthcare funds
and harm public health.
Objectives
Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of educational or policy interventions in research integrity or responsible conduct of
research on the behaviour and attitudes of researchers in health and other research areas.
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS and CINAHL health research bibliographical databases, as well as the Academic
Search Complete, AGRICOLA, GeoRef, PsycINFO, ERIC, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. We performed the last search
on 15 April 2015 and the search was limited to articles published between 1990 and 2014, inclusive. We also searched conference
proceedings and abstracts from research integrity conferences and specialized websites. We handsearched 14 journals that regularly
publish research integrity research.
Selection criteria
We included studies that measured the effects of one or more interventions, i.e. any direct or indirect procedure that may have an
impact on research integrity and responsible conduct of research in its broadest sense, where participants were any stakeholders in
research and publication processes, from students to policy makers. We included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials,
such as controlled before-and-after studies, with comparisons of outcomes in the intervention versus non-intervention group or before
versus after the intervention. Studies without a control group were not included in the review.

 Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. To assess the risk of bias in non-randomized studies, we used
a modified Cochrane tool, in which we used four out of six original domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome
reporting, other sources of bias) and two additional domains (comparability of groups and confounding factors). We categorized our
primary outcome into the following levels: 1) organizational change attributable to intervention, 2) behavioural change, 3) acquisition
of knowledge/skills and 4) modification of attitudes/perceptions. The secondary outcome was participants’ reaction to the intervention.
Main results
Thirty-one studies involving 9571 participants, described in 33 articles, met the inclusion criteria. All were published in English. Fifteen
studies were randomized controlled trials, nine were controlled before-and-after studies, four were non-equivalent controlled studies
with a historical control, one was a non-equivalent controlled study with a post-test only and two were non-equivalent controlled
studies with pre- and post-test findings for the intervention group and post-test for the control group. Twenty-one studies assessed
the effects of interventions related to plagiarism and 10 studies assessed interventions in research integrity/ethics. Participants included
undergraduates, postgraduates and academics from a range of research disciplines and countries, and the studies assessed different types
of outcomes.
We judged most of the included randomized controlled trials to have a high risk of bias in at least one of the assessed domains, and in
the case of non-randomized trials there were no attempts to alleviate the potential biases inherent in the non-randomized designs.
We identified a range of interventions aimed at reducing research misconduct. Most interventions involved some kind of training,
but methods and content varied greatly and included face-to-face and online lectures, interactive online modules, discussion groups,
homework and practical exercises. Most studies did not use standardized or validated outcome measures and it was impossible to
synthesize findings from studies with such diverse interventions, outcomes and participants. Overall, there is very low quality evidence
that various methods of training in research integrity had some effects on participants’ attitudes to ethical issues but minimal (or short-
lived) effects on their knowledge. Training about plagiarism and paraphrasing had varying effects on participants’ attitudes towards
plagiarism and their confidence in avoiding it, but training that included practical exercises appeared to be more effective. Training on
plagiarism had inconsistent effects on participants’ knowledge about and ability to recognize plagiarism. Active training, particularly if
it involved practical exercises or use of text-matching software, generally decreased the occurrence of plagiarism although results were
not consistent. The design of a journal’s author contribution form affected the truthfulness of information supplied about individuals’
contributions and the proportion of listed contributors who met authorship criteria. We identified no studies testing interventions for
outcomes at the organizational level. The numbers of events and the magnitude of intervention effects were generally small, so the
evidence is likely to be imprecise. No adverse effects were reported.
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence base relating to interventions to improve research integrity is incomplete and the studies that have been done are
heterogeneous, inappropriate for meta-analyses and their applicability to other settings and population is uncertain. Many studies had
a high risk of bias because of the choice of study design and interventions were often inadequately reported. Even when randomized
designs were used, findings were difficult to generalize. Due to the very low quality of evidence, the effects of training in responsible
conduct of research on reducing research misconduct are uncertain. Low quality evidence indicates that training about plagiarism,
especially if it involves practical exercises and use of text-matching software, may reduce the occurrence of plagiarism.

Preventing misconduct and promoting integrity in research and publication
Doctors and patients need to be able to trust reports of medical research because these are used to help them make decisions about
treatments. It is therefore important to prevent false or misleading research. Problems with research include various types of misconduct
such as altering results (falsification), making up results (fabrication) or copying other people’s work (plagiarism). Good systems that
produce reliable research are said to show ’research integrity’. We studied activities, such as training, designed to reduce research
misconduct and encourage integrity. The effects of some of these activities on researchers’ attitudes, knowledge and behaviour have
been studied and we brought together the evidence from these studies.
Some studies showed positive effects on researchers’ attitudes to plagiarism. Practical training, such as using computer programs that
can detect plagiarism, or writing exercises, sometimes decreased plagiarism by students but not all studies showed positive effects. We

 did not find any studies on fabrication or falsification. Two studies showed that the way in which journals ask authors for details about
who did each part of a study can affect their responses.
Many of the studies included in this review had problems such as small sample sizes or had used methods that might produce biased
results. The training methods tested in the studies (which included online courses, lectures and discussion groups) were often not clearly
described. Most studies tested effects over short time periods. Many studies involved university students rather than active researchers.
In summary, the available evidence is of very low quality, so the effect of any intervention for preventing misconduct and promoting
integrity in research and publication is uncertain. However, practical training about how to avoid plagiarism may be effective in reducing
plagiarism by students, although we do not know whether it has long-term effects.

Description of the problem or issue
The two World Conferences on Research Integrity and the Singa-
pore Statement on Research Integrity, Resnik 2011, called for the
development of more comprehensive standards, codes and policies
to promote research integrity both locally and on a global basis.
However, there is little systematic evidence to guide the develop-
ment and implementation of these standards. This systematic re-
view assesses the existing evidence and identifies research questions
that need to be addressed.
Description of the methods being investigated
Research integrity and responsible conduct of research emerged as
a research topic in the 1990s after public reports of scientific fraud
and the response by national policy makers to deal with the prob-
lem (Steneck 2006). Together with the growing understanding of
research behaviour, there is also a growth of empirical informa-
tion about interventions by institutions, funders, regulators, jour-
nal editors and other stakeholders to improve responsible conduct
of research and foster research integrity. A systematic review and
meta-analysis of the prevalence of fabrication, falsification or ma-
nipulation of research findings showed that an average of 1.97%
(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 4.45) of scientists admitted
such practices and that 9.54% (95% CI 5.15 to 13.94) admit-
ted other questionable research practices (Fanelli 2009). Another
meta-analysis on authorship in research publications also demon-
strated a high prevalence of reported problems with authorship
(pooled weighted average of 29% (95% CI 24 to 35) of authors
reporting their own or others’ experience of abuse of authorship)
(Marusic 2011).
There is a growing body of evidence on attitudes and practices of
researchers relating to the responsible conduct of research, serious
forms of misconduct (i.e. fabrication, falsification and plagiarism
or ’FFP’) and so-called ’questionable research practices’ (Steneck
2006). It is generally recognised that these behaviours form a con-
tinuum from outright misconduct at one end to ideal practices
at the other, but that the boundaries between acceptable, careless,
questionable and fraudulent behaviour are not universally defined.
How these methods might work
Interventions to foster responsible conduct of research or deter
misconduct have been tested in a number of research settings and
across research disciplines, although predominantly in medicine.
Since some forms of misconduct and questionable research prac-
tices are assumed to result from ignorance rather than a deliber-
ate intention to deceive, it is widely assumed that training will
reduce such behaviours (Anderson 2007; Funk 2007; Hren 2007;
Plemmons 2006). Other interventions are based on the concept of
screening acting as a deterrent, for example text-matching software
may be used to screen material for plagiarism and it is believed
that this will deter authors from these practices (Bili -Zulle 2008).
Since misconduct involves breaches in ethics, other interventions
focus on establishing or reinforcing an ethical culture, for example
by the use of honour codes (Boyd 2004).
Why it is important to do this review
Improper practices and unprofessional conduct in clinical research
have been shown to waste a significant portion of healthcare funds
and adversely impact public health (Angel 2004). A synthesis of
evidence for effective ways to promote responsible conduct of re-
search and deter poor research practices should therefore have an
important impact on the quality of research output. Understand-
ing which techniques are effective will help institutions focus on
these activities and also avoid interventions that may be counter-
productive.

Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication (Review)

 If published, fraudulent medical research can harm patients di-
rectly or indirectly. For example, a clinical trial that used a new
method of predicting response to chemotherapy had to be stopped
when the research on which the method was based was shown to
be fraudulent. The paper was subsequently retracted but probably
led to some cancer patients receiving suboptimal therapies (Reich
2011).
Although it is difficult to estimate the impact of misconduct out-
side of health research (Steneck 2006), a recent case study of the
cost of research misconduct estimated the direct cost of an actual
investigation to be USD 525,000 and indirect costs to be USD
1.3 million (Michalek 2010).
O B J E C T I V E S
Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of educational or
policy interventions in research integrity or responsible conduct
of research on the behaviour and attitudes of researchers in health
and other research areas.
Since serious research and publication misconduct are relatively
rare, and interventions may be designed to have long-term effects,
the effects of interventions on the frequency of misconduct are
hard to measure. Therefore we also considered surrogate endpoints
such as researcher attitudes.
In this review, we particularly focused on interventions aimed at
fostering research integrity, which views research behaviour from
the perspective of professional standards (Steneck 2006). We also
explored interventions to prevent unacceptable or fraudulent re-
search and publication practices.
As there is significant variability in defining how researchers should
behave when performing and communicating research (Steneck
2006), for the purpose of this review we used the following defi-
nitions:
• Responsible conduct of research was defined as “conducting
research in ways that fulfil the professional responsibilities of
researchers, as defined by their professional organizations, the
institutions for which they work and, when relevant, the
government and public” (Steneck 2006).
• Research integrity was defined as “the quality of possessing
and steadfastly adhering to high moral principles and
professional standards, as outlined by professional organizations,
research institutions and, when relevant, the government and
public” (Steneck 2006). Research integrity was differentiated
from academic integrity, which is broader than research integrity
and is defined as commitment to “six fundamental values:
honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage”
(ICAI 2013); lack of academic integrity also includes engaging in
plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, cheating or facilitating
academic dishonesty (ICAI 2013). We included a study dealing
with academic integrity in this review when it addressed
plagiarism, because writing is an important component of
authorship in research (ICMJE 2014).
• Research ethics was defined as “moral problems associated
with or that arise in the course of pursuing research” (Steneck
2006). Studies dealing with research ethics, regardless of how
they were defined in the study, were included in the systematic
review. We did not include studies dealing with professional
ethics, which was defined as ethics related to professional work.
While professional work generally includes research activities
(Cogan 1953), we included studies which dealt with professional
ethics only if research was explicitly specified as a study topic.
• Research misconduct included all misbehaviours in
research, from fabrication, falsification and plagiarism (FFP) as
defined by the US Office of Research integrity to a more
inclusive list of misbehaviours as defined by research integrity
bodies in Scandinavian countries (Steneck 2006).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Studies of educational or policy interventions are usually con-
ducted in natural settings where a true randomized controlled de-
sign may not always be feasible. This is probably even truer for
the topic of research integrity, which has only relatively recently
become the focus of scientific investigations. For these reasons,
we planned to include in our review not only randomized con-
trolled trials, but also non-randomized controlled trials, such as
controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series and re-
gression discontinuity designs. We excluded observational (survey)
data when there was no clear intervention or manipulation. We
also excluded study designs without a comparison group. For con-
trolled before-and-after studies we included studies that had be-
fore-and-after measurements for the intervention group and only
one measurement for the control group. We examined quasi-ex-
perimental designs closely for threats to validity.
We included studies irrespective of publication status and lan-
guage.
Types of data
We included studies that measured the effects of one or more inter-
ventions, such as teaching, training, mentoring, use of checklists,
screening and policy, on research integrity or responsible conduct
of research in its broadest sense, including ’questionable research

 practices’ and publication misconduct. We considered interven-
tions in any type of researcher or student, at any period of their
research career, in all fields of research, including sciences, social
sciences and humanities. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of
reporting guidelines for improving the presentation of research
data, as this is not directly related to research integrity, but rather
to the quality of reporting, and has been covered by other system-
atic reviews (e.g. Plint 2006; Turner 2012).
Types of participants
The participants included any stakeholders in the research and
publication process, such as: 1) students, who may or may not
have an interest in becoming researchers, if they received an inter-
vention related to research integrity; 2) health workers involved in
research; 3) researchers working at institutions or commercial re-
search establishments; 4) authors, peer reviewers and/or editors of
scholarly journals; 5) professional and/or research organizations;
and 6) policy makers.
Types of interventions
Eligible interventions included any direct or indirect procedure
that may have an impact on research integrity, from direct educa-
tional interventions, such as a formal course or training required
by institutions or authorities (such as training required by Insti-
tutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees), to indirect interven-
tions, such as policy change (e.g. introduction of statements on
conflict of interest or authorship contribution declarations in jour-
nals).
Types of methods
We included the studies with comparisons of outcomes in inter-
vention versus non-intervention groups or before versus after the
intervention. We assessed the groups for baseline comparability,
such as age, gender, educational/professional level and other rele-
vant variables. We included studies that we judged to have reason-
able baseline comparability and to be similar in important demo-
graphic characteristics that might reasonably be thought to influ-
ence response to the intervention or otherwise affect outcomes.
Types of outcome measures
The basis for our classification of outcomes was the four-level
typology first described by Kirkpatrick (Kirkpatrick 1967) and
modified by Barr et al (Barr 2000):
• Level 1 outcomes refer to learners’ reaction to the
intervention, including participants’ views of their learning
experience and satisfaction with the programme.
• Level 2a outcomes refer to modification of attitudes and/or
perceptions regarding responsible conduct of research.
• Level 2b outcomes refer to acquisition of knowledge and/or
skills related to responsible conduct of research.
• Level 3 outcomes refer to behavioural change transferred
from the learning environment to the workplace prompted by
modifications in attitudes or perceptions, or the application of
newly acquired knowledge/skills in practice. We further divided
this level into:
• 3a - behavioural intentions; and
• 3b - actual change in research or publication practices, or
both.
• Level 4 outcomes refer to organizational changes
attributable to the intervention.
We included outcomes at the individual level (e.g. individual be-
haviour change) and as aggregated units of analysis (e.g. frequency
of retracted articles).
There was no outcome measure or set of outcome measures that
we could consider ’standard’ for the purposes of this review as we
expected a wide range of different outcomes to be found in in-
cluded studies. Our intention was to classify them in a theoretically
grounded way, so that we could meaningfully present the study
results if meta-analysis was not appropriate due to the high hetero-
geneity of the studies. Kirkpatrick’s four-level model (Kirkpatrick
1967) is a standard approach in educational research (Barr 2000).
As we assessed interventions aimed at reducing/preventing mis-
conduct, we considered actual change in behaviour, either on the
individual level (3rd level in Kirkpatrick’s model) or at the orga-
nizational level (4th level) as a hierarchically higher (or ’better’,
more desirable) outcome than participants’ satisfaction with an
intervention (1st level). As 1st level outcomes are the easiest to
assess, they are commonly used in educational research. However,
they are the least informative and relevant, so we categorized them
as secondary outcomes.
The inclusion of studies addressing perceptions and attitudes in
the systematic review was based on Ajzen’s theory of planned be-
haviour, in which the main predictors of behavioural intentions
are attitudes towards the behaviour, subjective norms and per-
ceived behavioural control (Ajzen 2005; Armitage 2001). Harms
outcomes or potentially adverse effects were not expected and we
did not assess them in this review.

Search methods for identification of studies
As the concepts of research integrity and responsible conduct of
research emerged in the scientific community only after the es-
tablishment and active work of the Office for Research Integrity
(ORI) in the USA in 1989 (Steneck 2006) and in Denmark in
1992 (Nylenna 1999), we limited our search to 1990 to December
2014.
Electronic searches
We searched the following bibliographic databases:
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL, December 2014) via OvidSP;
• MEDLINE via OvidSP (1946 to December 2014);
• LILACS via BIREME (to December 2014);
• CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1981 to December 2014).
We also searched the following specialized or general electronic
databases:
• Academic Search Complete - multi-disciplinary full-text
and bibliographical database from the EBSCO Publishing
platform (1887 to December 2014).
• AGRICOLA, multidisciplinary database from the US
National Agricultural Library, available via the OvidSP platform
(1970 to December 2014).
• GeoRef - database from the American Geosciences
Institute, available via the EBSCO Publishing platform (1933 to
December 2014).
• PsycINFO - database from the American Psychological
Association, available via the OvidSP platform (1806 to
December 2014).
• ERIC - database of education literature, via OvidSP
platform (1965 to December 2014).
• SCOPUS - citation database from Elsevier.
• Web of Science (WoS): SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI
- citation database from Thomson Reuters.
We did not separately search the EMBASE bibliographic database
because SCOPUS includes EMBASE data (Burnham 2006).
For the identification of studies to be included or considered
for this review, we developed separate search strategies for each
database searched. These were based on the search strategy devel-
oped for MEDLINE but revised appropriately for each database
to take account of differences in the controlled vocabulary and
syntax rules.
The subject search used a combination of controlled vocabulary,
if appropriate, and free-text terms based on the search strategy for
searching MEDLINE. The initial search strategy for MEDLINE,
as presented in the protocol, was partly changed and further de-
veloped. The search strategies we used for each database are re-
ported in Appendix 1. We performed all searches in January 2013
and updated them in April 2015, searching for articles published
between 1990 and 2014, inclusive. There were no language re-
strictions.
Searching other resources
We searched conference proceedings and abstracts in the following
resources:
• Research presented at the Office of Research Integrity (ORI)
Research Integrity Conferences (https://ori.hhs.gov/conference).
• Peer Review Congresses (http://
www.peerreviewcongress.org/previous.html).
• Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research
Conferences (http://www.primr.org/conferences/).
• Research Ethics site (http://researchethics.ca/).
We also searched a book on promoting research integrity by edu-
cation (Institute of Medicine 2002) and publications from ORI-
funded research, listed at: http://ori.dhhs.gov/research/extra/
rri_publications.shtml.
Finally, we handsearched the electronic tables of contents of the
following journals that regularly publish on research integrity top-
ics:
• Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics
(available online from volume 1 in 2006).
• Science and Engineering Ethics (available online from
volume 1 in 1995).
• Accountability in Research (available online from volume 1
in 1989).
• Ethics and Behavior (available online from volume 1 in
1991).
• Journal of Higher Education (last available volume: 2002).

 We also searched the references of all studies analysed in full text,
as well as retrieved review articles, using both ’forward’ (through
citation databases such as Web of Science) and ’backward’ (exam-
ining reference lists) citation searching (Horsley 2011).
Data collection and analysis
Following the execution of the search strategies, we collated the
identified records (titles and available abstracts) in an EndNote
database for de-duplication (Thomson Reuters 2011). We created
the final unique record set and full text of potentially eligible stud-
ies as a separate EndNote file, from which we carried out screening
of records and extraction of data from included articles.
Selection of studies
We expected a large volume of records from the initial database
search because of the broad and general nature of many search
terms. For this reason, we first conducted an initial screening of
the titles only, including the screening of the abstract when the
title was uninformative. In the next step, we screened the abstracts
(and full text when needed, particularly in publications outside
of biomedicine and health, which often had brief abstracts). After
exclusions at these two steps, we reviewed all remaining potentially
eligible articles in full text for eligibility, using a priori defined eli-
gibility criteria. Two review authors (AM and EW) independently
performed each step. Disagreements between review authors at the
stage of full-text analysis were resolved by consensus or by a third
member of the team (HRR).
Data extraction and management
Two members of the review team (AM and EW) independently
extracted the data on study characteristics and outcome data. Dis-
agreements were resolved by consensus or by consultation with the
third team member (HRR). The review authors were not blinded
to the authors, interventions or results obtained in the included
studies.
We extracted and entered the following data in a customized col-
lection form:
• Study design (e.g. randomized controlled trial, controlled
before-and-after, etc.), date and length of follow-up.
• Participants: a) sample size and b) inclusion and exclusion
criteria, demographic characteristics of participants: age, sex,
country of origin, ethnicity, gender, field of research, academic
level or research experience.
• Setting: type of institution or broader setting where the
intervention(s) took place.
• Interventions: details of the type and duration of
intervention and comparisons.
• Outcomes: detailed description of the outcomes of interest,
including the method and timing of measurement.
• Source of funding.
We extracted results for pre-specified types of outcomes of interest.
We extracted the raw data available in the study, such as means
and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number
of events and participants for dichotomous outcomes. As meta-
analysis of retrieved studies was not possible, we did not attempt
to obtain original data if they were not adequately presented in
the retrieved publication.
For studies that presented results in graphs (Brown 2001; Landau
2002), we generated numerical values using digitizing software
(Huwaldt 2014). For one study (Brown 2001), which presented
dataforindividual scalesbutperformedstatistical analysisforcom-
posite scores, we averaged mean scores and standard deviations for
composite scores using appropriate formula (Headrick 2010).
We designed the data extraction form for this review based on
forms available from other Cochrane Review Groups, and piloted
it before use. When several articles reported different outcomes
of the same study, we considered them a single entry in the data
extraction form.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
For randomized controlled trials, we assessed the risk of bias us-
ing Cochrane’s ’Risk of bias’ tool, which addresses the following
domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding (separately for researcher-assessed and self reported out-
comes), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting
and other sources of bias.
For the assessment of non-randomized studies, we used a mod-
ified Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool, in which we used four out of
six original domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selec-
tive outcome reporting, other sources of bias) and two additional
domains (comparability of groups and confounding factors) to as-
sess the risk of bias in the included non-randomized studies. For
the additional two domains we used the following questions for
assessment: “Were the study groups comparable at baseline?” and
“Were potential confounding factors adequately addressed?”. As
recommended in Chapter 13 of the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), we collected fac-
tual information on the confounders considered in the included
studies and reported them in a table. We did not assess the risk
of bias on the domains of sequence generation and concealment
of allocation sequence, as a high risk on these domains is inherent
in the design of non-randomized studies and therefore expectable
by default. We participated in the pilot study for a Cochrane Risk
Of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomized Studies of Inter-
ventions - ACROBAT-NRSI tool (Sterne 2014), but found that
it was not fully suitable because the published articles on studies
included in the review did not report many of the items needed
for the NRSI tool.
For all study designs, we assessed compliance with intervention
and possible contamination (spillover effect) between the groups
7

 under the domain of other sources of bias. We recorded each piece
of information extracted for the ’Risk of bias’ tool together with the
precise source of this information. We first tested data collection
forms and assessments of the risk of bias on a pilot sample of
articles. Two assessors (AM and DS) independently carried out
the assessment of risk of bias. The assessors were not blinded to
the names of the authors, institutions, journal or results of a study.
We tabulated risk of bias for each included study, along with a
judgement of low, high or unclear risk of bias, as described in
Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Measures of the effect of the methods
In the meta-analyses planned in the protocol for this systematic re-
view, we hadintendedtouse standardizedmeandifferences(SMD)
with 95% confidence intervals. However, we decided that meta-
analysis would not be appropriate because of the heterogeneity of
the included studies.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was generally the individual study participant.
Where the unit of assignment to an intervention was not the indi-
vidual, but some larger entity (e.g. a department or an institution),
the unit of analysis was the larger entity.
Dealing with missing data
In the protocol, we planned to address the problem of missing
data required for data synthesis or ’Risk of bias’ assessment by
contacting the authors to request the data (Young 2011). How-
ever, because most of the studies with missing information were
published a long time ago, often did not show an e-mail address
for the corresponding author and were published in fields outside
biomedicine and health, we did not systematically contact study
authors. In a single case where we contacted two authors of a study,
we did not get a response.
Data synthesis
There were significant differences in the study designs and out-
comes among included studies, therefore it was not possible to
carry out a meta-analysis. The results are presented descriptively
for individual studies, grouped according to four-level typology
for educational outcomes (Barr 2000). This did not lend itself to
building a ’Summary of findings’ table. In ’Additional tables’, we
noted whether there was a significant effect or not for each out-
come. We are aware that “vote counting” is not recommended in
data analysis, but the tables make the findings more understand-
able within the context of our qualitative synthesis.
Quality of the evidence
We followed the GRADE approach in the assessment of the qual-
ity of evidence (Grade Working Group 2004). We considered lim-
itations of included studies (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence,
inconsistency (heterogeneity), imprecision of effect estimates and
potential publication bias. We considered randomized controlled
trials to start from ’high quality’ and observational studies from
’low quality’. As we did not pool the data and the outcomes in the
included studies were very diverse, we could only make a general
statement on the quality of the evidence as a whole, taking into
account the different GRADE domains. Also, we commented on
possible factors affecting the quality of the evidence.

Description of studies
See: Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of
excluded studies. We ordered the included studies so that random-
ized studies are presented first, followed by other types of study
designs.
Results of the search
We identified 20,888 unique published records, of which we ex-
cluded 20,658 after title screening and a further 188 after abstract/
full-text screening. This left 42 potentially eligible publications for
detailed independent eligibility assessment (Figure 1).

 Included studies
Thirty-one studies involving 9571 participants, described in 33
articles, met the inclusion criteria. All were published in English.
Fifteen studies reported the dates of the study, which ranged from
2001 to 2009 (Arnott 2008; Ballard 2013; Belter 2009; Bili -
Zulle 2008; Brown 2001; Dee 2012; Estow 2011; Ivaniš 2008;
Kose 2011; Marshall 2011; Maruši
2006; Moniz 2008; Risquez
2011; Roberts 2007; Rolfe 2011).
Randomized studies
Fifteen studies were randomized controlled trials, involving
5275 participants (Aggarwal 2011; Ballard 2013; Brown 2001;
Compton 2008; Dee 2012; Ivaniš 2008; Landau 2002; Maruši
2006; Moniz 2008; Newton 2014; Risquez 2011; Roberts 2007;
Rose 1998; Schuetze 2004; Youmans 2011). One of these was pre-
sented in two published articles (Roberts 2007). Six had two in-
tervention arms (Aggarwal 2011; Dee 2012; Ivaniš 2008; Newton
2014; Rose 1998; Schuetze 2004); four had three arms (Brown
2001; Maruši
2006; Moniz 2008; Roberts 2007), and four had
four arms (Ballard 2013; Compton 2008; Landau 2002; Youmans
2011). All randomized controlled trials, except one (Aggarwal
2011), had only post-test evaluation without baseline measure-
ment. The trials took place mostly in the USA (nine studies:
Ballard 2013; Compton 2008; Dee 2012; Landau 2002; Moniz
2008; Roberts 2007; Rose 1998; Schuetze 2004; Youmans 2011),
one each in Australia (Newton 2014), India (Aggarwal 2011),
Ireland (Risquez 2011), and the UK (Brown 2001), and two
were performed in an international general medical journal pub-
lished in Croatia (Ivaniš 2008; Maruši
2006). Participants in-
cluded undergraduate students from different disciplines, such
as psychology, humanities, communication and entrepreneurship
(10 studies: Ballard 2013; Brown 2001; Compton 2008; Dee
2012; Landau 2002; Moniz 2008; Newton 2014; Risquez 2011;
Schuetze 2004; Youmans 2011), medical students (one study;
Roberts 2007), graduate students in graduate students in physical,
biological, engineering and social science fields (Rose 1998), and
scientists/journal authors (three studies: Aggarwal 2011; Ivaniš
2008; Maruši
2006). The sample size ranged from 58 to 1462
participants (median 211, interquartile range (IQR) 91 to 398).
Funding was reported for five out of the 15 randomized controlled
trials; of the 10 studies without stated funding, one reported that
the course was developed by a spin-off company. Interventions
were related to plagiarism, research ethics courses and journal au-
thorship.
In studies related to plagiarism, the comparisons included in-
oculation of educational statements about plagiarism in teach-
ing material versus no intervention (Brown 2001), use of Tur-
nitin in preventing plagiarism (Ballard 2013; Newton 2014), fear-
based, guilt-based and reason-based messages versus no inter-
vention (Compton 2008), online tutorial on understanding and
avoiding plagiarism versus no intervention (Dee 2012), plagiarism
detection exercise with feedback, examples or their combination
versus no intervention (Landau 2002), direct lecture or student-
centred, practical instruction on plagiarism versus standard teach-
ing (Moniz 2008), in-class tutorial on plagiarism prevention versus
no instruction (Risquez 2011), composite intervention of instruc-
tion and homework on plagiarism versus standard teaching on ci-
tations and referencing (Schuetze 2004), and brief paraphrasing
instruction versus no intervention (Youmans 2011). The studies
assessed a variety of outcomes (median of 2 per study, IQR 1 to
3).
Studies on plagiarism mostly investigated the effects of interven-
tion on students’ knowledge and attitudes toward plagiarism and
its prevalence and prevention, as well as the extent of plagia-
rism in submitted student works (Ballard 2013; Brown 2001;
Compton 2008; Dee 2012; Landau 2002; Moniz 2008; Newton
2014; Risquez 2011; Schuetze 2004; Youmans 2011).
Two studies investigated the effects of research ethics courses, one
comparing an online versus on-site course and assessing the knowl-
edge at the end of the course and three months after the course
(Aggarwal 2011), and the other comparing criteria-oriented and
participant-oriented teaching on evaluating the ethical soundness
of research on humans versus no ethics instruction, assessing med-
ical student’s rating of the significance of ethical problems and
their attitudes towards ethical conduct of clinical research (Roberts
2007). One study investigated the impact of authorship policies
on students’ judgements of authorship in graduate student-pro-
fessor collaboration (Rose 1998). Finally, two studies in the same
general medical journal investigated satisfaction of authorship cri-
teria from the International Committee of Medical Journal Ed-
itors (ICMJE) in different situations of authorship declaration:
one study compared a categorical or instructional declaration form
versus an open-ended form for authorship declaration (Maruši
2006), and the other compared a binary (yes/no) to an ordinal rat-
ing scale of authorship contributions (Ivaniš 2008). In both stud-
ies the reporting outcome was the number of authors satisfying
ICMJE authorship criteria.
Non-randomized studies
Sixteen studies had other study design types: nine were controlled
before-and-afterstudiesinvolving2293participants (Arnott 2008;
Chertok 2014; Clarkeburn 2002; Estow 2011; Fisher 1997; Hull
1994; May 2013; Strohmetz 1992; Walker 2008), four were non-
equivalent controlled studies with a historical control involving
1897 participants (Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Marshall 2011;
10
Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication (Review)

 Rolfe 2011), one was a non-equivalent controlled study with a
post-test only (Chao 2009) (116 participants) and two were non-
equivalent controlled with pre- and post-test for the intervention
group and post-test for the control group, involving 108 partici-
pants (Barry 2006; Kose 2011).
One study was presented in two published articles (Bili -Zulle
2008). The non-randomized studies took place mostly in the USA
(11 studies: Arnott 2008; Barry 2006; Belter 2009; Chao 2009;
Chertok 2014; Estow 2011; Fisher 1997; Hull 1994; May 2013;
Strohmetz 1992; Walker 2008), two were performed in the UK
(Clarkeburn 2002; Marshall 2011; Rolfe 2011), and one each
in Croatia (Bili -Zulle 2008) and Turkey (Kose 2011). Partici-
pants were mostly undergraduate students, predominantly from
psychology (11 studies: Aggarwal 2011; Barry 2006; Belter 2009;
Chao 2009; Clarkeburn 2002; Estow 2011; Fisher 1997; Kose
2011; Rolfe 2011; Strohmetz 1992; Walker 2008); one study in-
volved medical students (Bili -Zulle 2008), one study involved
health students (Chertok 2014), three involved postgraduate stu-
dents, including masters degree students (Hull 1994; Marshall
2011; Rose 1998), and one had a mixture of undergraduate and
postgraduate students (May 2013). The sample size ranged from
36 to 1085 participants (median 146, IQR 65 to 385.5). Fund-
ing was reported by six out of 16 studies. Interventions included
prevention of plagiarism (10 studies) and research ethics training
(six studies).
Plagiarism comparisons included different forms of paraphrasing
exercises versus standard instruction on plagiarism (Barry 2006;
Chao 2009; Chertok 2014; Kose 2011; Marshall 2011; Rolfe
2011; Walker 2008), as well as instructions on plagiarism and its
prevention versus no intervention (Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008;
Estow 2011). Research ethics training comparisons included dia-
logue-based computer tutoring systems versus standard teaching
(Arnott 2008), ethics discussion embedded into science courses
versus no intervention (Clarkeburn 2002), or embedded ethics
training or stand-alone ethics training versus no ethics instruction
(May 2013), ethics-enhanced discussions versus standard ethic
course (Fisher 1997), research ethics course versus no intervention
(Hull 1994), and role-playing in research ethics training versus no
intervention (Strohmetz 1992).
The studies assessed different outcomes (median of 1 per study,
95% CI 1 to 2.5). In studies on plagiarism, the outcomes were
mostly some form of estimation of plagiarism in submitted student
work (Barry 2006; Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Chao 2009;
Kose 2011; Marshall 2011; Rolfe 2011; Walker 2008), or students’
knowledge about and perceptions of plagiarism (Barry 2006;
Chertok 2014; Estow 2011). Interventions in research ethics train-
ing assessed knowledge (Aggarwal 2011; Fisher 1997; May 2013),
moral reasoning or socio-moral reflection (Clarkeburn 2002; Hull
1994; May 2013), ethical sensitivity (Clarkeburn 2002; Fisher
1997), or assessment of research study utility or cost in relation to
ethics (Strohmetz 1992).
Five out of 31 studies also assessed satisfaction with or experience
of the intervention (Aggarwal 2011; Dee 2012; Kose 2011; Moniz
2008; Rolfe 2011).
Excluded studies
We excluded studies described in 13 articles: eight did not have
an adequate control group (Ali 2014; Bagdasarov 2013; Harkrider
2012; Kligyte 2008; McDonalds 2010; Mumford 2008; Powell
2007; Vallero 2007), two were on professional or academic ethics
(excluding plagiarism) and not research ethics/integrity (Goldie
2001; Gurung 2012; May 2014), and two did not include testing
before the intervention (Hren 2007; Pollock 1995).

 Allocation
A. Randomized studies
Random sequence generation
Only three included randomized studies had a properly conducted
and described random sequence generation procedure (Aggarwal
2011; Ivaniš 2008; Maruši
2006). Most other studies failed to
describe the procedure and just mentioned that participants were
randomly assigned (Ballard 2013; Compton 2008; Landau 2002;
Moniz 2008; Newton 2014; Roberts 2007; Rose 1998; Schuetze
2004; Youmans 2011). One studydescribedthe procedure asblock
randomization with pairing on baseline traits, which we judged
to be of insufficient clarity (Dee 2012). Another study distributed
the intervention and control booklets from a “randomized pile”,
without explaining how the pile was randomized (Brown 2001).
In one study, some intervention groups were assigned randomly
and some non-randomly, resulting in a high risk of bias in this
domain (Risquez 2011).
Allocation concealment
No study described an attempt to conceal the allocation sequence.
In one case, the selection of participants inferred that the allocation
sequence would not be known to the researchers (Youmans 2011).
In two randomized controlled trials, authors of this review who
had participated in the included study confirmed that there was no
allocation concealment, so we rated the risk of bias for these studies
as high (Ivaniš 2008; Maruši
2006). For another study, it was
clearfromthe reportthatnoallocationconcealmentwasattempted
(Schuetze 2004). Although the risk of bias in this domain for all
other studies had to be marked as unclear due to lack of detail
provided in the reports, it seems likely that the actual risk of bias
in this domain was high for all studies.
Blinding
A. Randomized studies
Researchers or outcome assessors were described as being blinded
in four randomized controlled trials (Brown 2001; Landau 2002;
Schuetze 2004; Youmans 2011), and participants were blinded in
seven studies (Ballard 2013; Brown 2001; Dee 2012; Ivaniš 2008;
Maruši
2006; Rose 1998; Schuetze 2004). Some studies either
explicitly stated that there was no blinding of researchers (Dee
2012; Maruši
2006) or participants (Youmans 2011), or it was
clear from the report that there was no blinding of researchers
(Aggarwal 2011; Ivaniš 2008) or study participants (Aggarwal
2011). The rest of the studies were reported in insufficient de-
tail to discern whether the researchers (Rose 1998), participants
(Landau 2002), or both researchers and participants (Compton
2008; Moniz 2008; Newton 2014; Risquez 2011; Roberts 2007),
were blinded.
B. Non-randomized studies
In all but one included non-randomized study there was no active
attempt by the researchers to blind the participants or outcome
assessors, so risk of bias in this domain had to be judged as high.
Participants were reportedly blind to the research hypothesis in
only one study, but there was no description of how blinding was
achieved, so we judged the risk of bias for this study to be unclear
(May 2013). However, in many cases the study design was such
that participants were probably not aware that there was another
intervention or control group or even that they were participating
in a study, so the effect of non-blinding was probably marginal.
Incomplete outcome data
A. Randomized studies
In most of the randomized controlled trials the attrition was
small and we judged the risk of bias due to incomplete outcome
data to be low (Aggarwal 2011; Brown 2001; Dee 2012; Ivaniš
2008; Maruši
2006; Moniz 2008; Newton 2014; Risquez 2011;
Roberts 2007; Youmans 2011). The low attrition rate could in
many cases be ascribed to the study design, such as when interven-
tions were associated with mandatory courses that students had
to complete in order to earn their grades. Data on the number of
participants were reported insufficiently or inconsistently in four
studies (Ballard 2013; Compton 2008; Landau 2002; Schuetze
2004), so the risk of bias in this domain had to be judged as un-
clear. In one study the response rate was low, with a high risk of
bias due to incomplete outcome data (Rose 1998).
B. Non-randomized studies - incomplete outcome data
In six non-randomized studies the attrition was non-existent or
very small (Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Chao 2009; Chertok
2014; Rolfe 2011; Walker 2008). In another five studies the risk of
bias due to incomplete outcome data was unclear, as the attrition
was not clearly reported (Hull 1994; Kose 2011; Marshall 2011;
Strohmetz 1992), or there were some unexplained imbalances in
attrition rates between the study arms (Arnott 2008). A high risk of
bias due to a considerable attrition rate was present in five studies
16
Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication (Review)

 (Barry 2006; Clarkeburn 2002; Estow 2011; Fisher 1997; May
2013), although in one study there was an attempt to analyse and
explain such high attrition rates (May 2013).
Selective reporting
A. Randomized studies
All outcomeswere adequatelyreportedinmostof the includedran-
domized controlled trials (Aggarwal 2011; Ballard 2013; Brown
2001; Compton 2008; Ivaniš 2008; Maruši 2006; Roberts 2007;
Rose 1998; Schuetze 2004). In one study only results of statistical
analyses were reported, without absolute numbers (Dee 2012). We
judged five studies to have a high risk of bias due to selective out-
come reporting, as one or more outcomes of interest were reported
incompletely and could not be entered in a meta-analysis. In one
of those studies, means were presented without standard devia-
tions, non-significant results were not reported, and the results for
one of the outcomes was presented only for all participants and
not for each studied group (Landau 2002). One study failed to
report the numerical results altogether (Moniz 2008), and in an-
other means were reported without standard deviations (Risquez
2011). Two studies did not report the number of participants per
group (Newton 2014; Youmans 2011), and one of them did not
report non-significant outcomes (Newton 2014).
B. Non-randomized studies
In 10 included non-randomized studies all outcomes were ad-
equately reported (Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Chao 2009;
Chertok 2014; Estow 2011; Fisher 1997; Marshall 2011; May
2013; Rolfe 2011; Walker 2008). In six studies, we judged the
risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting to be high. Three
of these studies only reported results of statistical analyses with-
out providing scores by study group (Arnott 2008; Barry 2006;
Strohmetz 1992), one reported only means without standard de-
viations (Hull 1994), one did not fully report all of the outcomes
(Clarkeburn 2002), and one reported results only as percentages
and provided ranges without medians (Kose 2011).
Other potential sources of bias
A. Randomized studies
We identified no further source of bias in seven randomized con-
trolled trials (Compton 2008; Dee 2012; Ivaniš 2008; Landau
2002; Maruši
2006; Roberts 2007; Rose 1998; Youmans 2011).
The outcome measurement instrument had not been validated (or
was only partially validated) in six studies (Aggarwal 2011; Brown
2001; Moniz 2008; Newton 2014; Risquez 2011; Schuetze 2004).
Course attendance rate was not reported in two studies (Aggarwal
2011; Ballard 2013), and there was a risk of contamination be-
tween the intervention and control groups in two studies (Ballard
2013; Schuetze 2004). In two studies there was an unclear or ques-
tionable baseline comparability between the study arms due to the
units of randomization (Moniz 2008), or inadequate randomiza-
tion procedure (Risquez 2011). We judged the risk of bias to be
unclear for all studies in regard to other possible sources of bias.
B. Non-randomized studies
Comparability of groups
Comparability of groups was unclear in 13 out of 16 non-ran-
domized studies (Arnott 2008; Barry 2006; Chao 2009; Chertok
2014; Estow 2011; Fisher1997; Hull1994; Kose2011; May2013;
Rolfe 2011; Strohmetz 1992; Walker 2008). There was either no
comparison of demographic characteristics between the groups, or
the number of compared characteristics was very limited. Often
the participants were recruited from different study programmes,
years or even universities. In some cases these differences were such
that we judged the risk of bias due to questionable comparability
of groups to be high (Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Clarkeburn
2002; Marshall 2011). Risk of bias under this domain was con-
siderable for all the included non-randomized studies, as baseline
differences between the study groups were likely even among the
studies whose risk of bias had to be judged as unclear due to in-
sufficient information provided in the report.
Confounding factors
All but one of the non-randomized studies failed to adequately
control for confounding factors and we judged them to have a
high risk of bias under this domain. A single study reported ba-
sic demographic characteristics of participants and used them in
a regression analysis (May 2013). Although some other studies
collected and reported basic demographic characteristics, none of
them actually used the data to control for confounding factors.
Other sources of bias
While for a single study we could not identify other sources of
bias (Chertok 2014), most of the non-randomized studies had
a high risk of bias related to other reasons, such as unvalidated
outcome measurement instrument (Arnott 2008; Barry 2006;
Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Chao 2009; Kose 2011; Rolfe
2011; Strohmetz 1992), poor or unknown attendance rate (Arnott
2008; Barry 2006; Clarkeburn 2002; Kose 2011; Marshall 2011;
May 2013), interventions provided by different instructors or in
different settings (Arnott 2008; Belter 2009; Chao 2009; Marshall
2011; May 2013; Strohmetz 1992), potentially biased selection
of participants in study arms (Arnott 2008; May 2013), failure
to conduct both pre-test and post-test of all the participants (
17
Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication (Review)

 Barry 2006; Belter 2009; Bili -Zulle 2008; Kose 2011; Rolfe
2011; Walker 2008), possible contamination between the groups
(Kose 2011), and the use of a historical control (Bili -Zulle 2008;
Marshall 2011).
In three studies there were no other possible sources of bias except
unvalidated outcome measurement instruments and/or unknown
attendance rate (Estow 2011; Fisher 1997; Hull 1994). For those
studies, we rated the risk of bias under this domain as unclear,
rather than high.
Effect of methods
We assessed the effects of interventions for research integrity using
outcome classification levels according to the Kirkpatrick/Barr ty-
pology (Barr 2000; Kirkpatrick 1967).
Primary outcomes
1. Organizational change attributable to the intervention
No studies tested interventions directed to organizational changes
for preventing or fostering research integrity.
2. Behavioural change
One randomized controlled trial evaluated participants’ intentions
for a behavioural change (level 3a outcome) regarding research
ethics (Rose 1998), showing that male graduate students who were
aware of authorship policy when deciding on a case of author-
ship problems in student-faculty collaboration were more likely
to report the professor who took first authorship on a student dis-
sertation than students who were not informed about the policy.
Female students aware of the policy were less likely to report such
a case than those who were not aware of the policy. The awareness
of policies had no effect on students’ estimates of effectiveness or
consequences of such actions.
Sixteen studies evaluated 21 different outcomes of actual be-
havioural change (level 3b outcome), related to research ethics/in-
tegrity interventions (in two studies) or plagiarism (in 14 studies).
The results of the studies are summarized in Table 1.
a) Research ethics/integrity
Two randomized controlled trials in a single general medical jour-
nal evaluated whether changes in the authorship declaration form
could influence authorship qualifications according to the stan-
dard definition of authorship in biomedicine from the Interna-
tional Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Fewer
authors completing the instructional declaration form (which
instructed the respondents about the number of contributions
needed to satisfy ICMJE authorship criteria) failed to satisfy
ICMJE criteria in comparison to authors who either answered an
open-endedquestionabouttheircontributionsorhadto pickfrom
a list of predefined categories of contributions (Maruši
2006).
When authors chose their contributions from a list of contribution
categories, more of them satisfied the ICMJE authorship criteria
when they could indicate the extent of their contribution than
when they had to provide a binary (yes-no) response (Ivaniš 2008).
b) Plagiarism prevention
In a randomized controlled trial undergraduate students who re-
ceived instruction about plagiarism definition and examples of a
plagiarized text used fewer overlapping words and two-word or
three-word strings in their assignments than students receiving
feedback about why the text overlap was considered plagiarism or
both the example and the feedback (Landau 2002). In another
randomized controlled trial, a one-hour in-class tutorial to under-
graduate students on plagiarism prevention was not effective in
comparison to no intervention in decreasing reported engagement
in plagiarism (Risquez 2011). In another randomized controlled
trial, undergraduate students who had to do a homework assign-
ment of recognizing plagiarism after receiving a 30-minute presen-
tation and handouts with plagiarism definition and citation guide-
lines had fewer citation problems in their term papers than stu-
dents without the homework assignment (Schuetze 2004). In the
Newton 2014 randomized controlled trial, a short training session
on paraphrasing, patch-writing and plagiarism increased the per-
formance of students in assignment writing, as measured by refer-
encing source material, avoiding patch-writing and avoiding pla-
giarism in comparison to no intervention. In the Ballard 2013 ran-
domized controlled trial, an interactive academic integrity module
addressing plagiarism and paraphrasing, with or without examples
from Turnitin text-matching software, was not successful in de-
creasing similarity index in course assignments by undergraduate
students in comparison to no intervention. In the Youmans 2011
randomized controlled trial, warning about the use of Turnitin did
not have an effect on plagiarism level in undergraduate students’
writing assignments, regardless of whether they were instructed to
cite sources or if citing was not mandatory.
In a controlled before-and-after study (Estow 2011), undergrad-
uate students from a methods and statistics course with embed-
ded plagiarism themes and assignments did not fare better than
students from the control course in the quality of paraphrasing in
their written assignments. In the Walker 2008 study, paraphrasing
training to avoid plagiarism decreased the extent of plagiarism in
the students’ written course assignments compared to no training.
Two studies used a modification of the controlled before-and-af-
ter study design, with the control group of undergraduate stu-
dents receiving post-intervention testing only. In the Chao 2009
study, compared to the no intervention group that was tasked with
writing a report and warned about plagiarism, active training in
preventing plagiarism involving extensive discussion and student
practice work was more effective than active training involving in-
18

 structions and examples in decreasing the proportion of students
who had some extent of plagiarized course assignments. However,
none of the interventions was effective in decreasing the mean pro-
portion of plagiarized text in the assignments. In the Kose 2011
study, undergraduate students using Turnitin plagiarism detection
software in writing their course works had a lower level of plagia-
rism in submitted essays than students without experience with
Turnitin.
Four studies used a historical control in their before-and-after
study design. Undergraduate students who completed an online
academic integrity module during a course had fewer instances of
plagiarism in their course papers than students attending a regular
course (Belter 2009). Undergraduate students who were warned
during the course that their essays would be examined for plagia-
rism and that plagiarism would be penalized had less plagiarized
text in their essays than students who either received no warning
or received an explanation about plagiarism and how to avoid it
(Bili -Zulle 2008). Similarly, warning about the use of Turnitin
for checking students’ assignments and additional interactive sem-
inars on plagiarism decreased the number of plagiarism occur-
rences and the amount of plagiarized text (Marshall 2011). Finally,
use of Turnitin feedback to help students revise their course essays
before final submission did not decrease the number the number
of students who plagiarized compared to the student group with-
out intervention. The number of submissions with plagiarism due
to poor paraphrasing decreased, but not due to other causes (Rolfe
2011). Actually, plagiarism due to failure to acknowledge sources,
measured as the lack of citations in the text, increased in the in-
tervention group.
3. Acquisition of knowledge and/or skills related to
responsible conduct of research
Ten studies evaluated 12 different outcomes at this level, related
to research ethics training (in three studies) or plagiarism (in six
studies). The results of individual studies are summarized in Table
2 and Table 3, respectively.
a) Research ethics/integrity
In a randomized controlled trial (Aggarwal 2011), onsite and on-
line courses for researchers in research ethics increased knowledge
immediately after the course, but with no difference in the median
knowledge gain from the baseline to three months.
Two studies used a controlled before-and-after design to measure
knowledge gain in research ethics/integrity. Undergraduate stu-
dents receiving a dialogue-based computer tutoring system on re-
search methodology, including research ethics, had greater knowl-
edge gainthanstudentsreceivingstandardteaching (Arnott 2008).
In the Fisher 1997 study, students attending courses with em-
bedded research ethics modules had better knowledge of research
ethics procedures and ability to weigh scientific responsibility and
participant rights and welfare compared to standard ethics instruc-
tion.
b) Plagiarism prevention
Two randomized controlled trials failed to show positive effects of
training undergraduate students in plagiarism prevention. There
was no difference between direct instruction and student-centred
teaching in improving student’s functional understanding of pla-
giarism (Moniz 2008). Students who received a combination of
lectures, handoutsonplagiarismdefinitionandcitationguidelines,
and a homework assignment to practise recognizing plagiarism,
had similar scores on the knowledge test and understanding of the
importance of proper citation in writing assignments to students
without such training (Schuetze 2004).
In the Landau 2002 randomized controlled trial, when undergrad-
uate students received instruction about plagiarism definition and
examples of a plagiarized text, feedback about why the text overlap
was considered plagiarism or both the example and the feedback,
they had better knowledge about plagiarism, measured as Plagia-
rism Knowledge Survey (PKS) score, than students receiving no
intervention.
In the Newton 2014 randomized controlled trial, short training
session on paraphrasing, patch-writing and plagiarism increased
referencing knowledge of undergraduate students in comparison
to no intervention.
In a controlled before-and-after study (Estow 2011), undergradu-
ate students from a methods and statistics course with embedded
plagiarism themes and assignments were better than students from
the non-intervention course in identifying plagiarism in test exam-
ples. They also listed a similar number of strategies to avoid plagia-
rism while students from the control group listed fewer strategies
after the course.
Practice of paraphrasing and source citation over six weeks of a
course increased a composite score in a plagiarism definition test
in undergraduate students compared to students from the control
group, who were tested only after the course (Barry 2006).
The Chertok 2014 study used a controlled before-and-after de-
sign to demonstrate that a course on academic integrity using a
combination of in-person and Internet-based lectures, discussion
and participation did not increase knowledge about plagiarism.
4. Modification of attitudes and/or perceptions
Thirteen studies evaluated 34 different outcomes at this level, re-
lated to either research ethics training (in six studies) or plagiarism
prevention (in seven studies).
a) Research ethics/integrity
Two randomized and four controlled before-and-after studies ex-
plored effects of interventions for fostering research ethics. The
results are summarized in Table 4.
19
Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 In a randomized controlled trial (Roberts 2007), medical students
whoreceivedcriteria-oriented(analytic-focused)instructionabout
ethically important considerations in human clinical research as-
signed greater significance to ethical problems presented in 10 vi-
gnettes than students receiving participant-oriented (empathy-fo-
cused) instruction or no instructions. In contrast, participants who
received empathy-focused instruction but not those with analytic-
focused instruction expressed stronger agreement with statements
regarding research participant decision-making than the control
group. They also had more positive attitudes toward towards the
decisional capacity of seriously ill people as research participants:
students in the participant-oriented (empathy) intervention con-
sidered that research participants with serious illness would be
much less accepting of surrogate decision-making by research doc-
tors than by family members, which was not the case for the cri-
teria-oriented intervention group or the control group; they also
considered that people with serious illness were much less accept-
ing of surrogate decision-making by research doctors than by fam-
ily members. The interventions had no effect on research partici-
pants’ attitudes concerning research participants’ vulnerability and
acceptance of surrogate decision-makers, as well as ethically rele-
vant attitudes related to clinical research, and the importance of
the ethical duties of investigators.
A randomizedcontrolledtrial of the effectof authorshippolicieson
students’ judgement of authorship abuse in student-faculty collab-
oration, demonstrated different effects of policies on perceptions
of male and female students (Rose 1998). Whereas the presence
of an authorship policy did not affect male students’ perception
of the ethicality of assigning first authorship, female students had
less positive attitudes to first authorship for a professor when they
were aware of the professional policy, which favours student first
authorship in collaborations leading to a dissertation. The policy
had no effect on students’ attitudes about the ethicality of profes-
sors to submitting a manuscript to a journal without discussing
authorship with the student.
In a controlled before-and-after study (Clarkeburn 2002), under-
graduate students receiving two-hour, face-to-face ethics and re-
search integrity discussion within a science course increased in
ethical sensitivity compared to the control group, which did not
receive the intervention, but not in moral reasoning skills as mea-
sured by the Defining Issues Test (DIT) or meta-ethical under-
standing.
In the Hull 1994 study, a stand-alone course on research ethics,
which combined lecture and discussion group formats, increased
socio-moral reasoning of graduate students compared with stu-
dents who did not attend the course. In the May 2013 study, un-
dergraduate students receiving either stand-alone or course-em-
bedded ethics modules showed enhanced perspective-taking com-
pared to students receiving no intervention, as well as moral ef-
ficiency and moral courage, but there was no change in moral
reasoning (as tested by the DIT) or moral meaningfulness. In the
Strohmetz 1992 study, use of a role-play exercise in teaching stu-
dents about the ethical complexity of research in comparison to a
standard research ethics course increased students’ perceptions of
the ethical utility and decreased their perceptions on the ethical
cost of problematic research studies.
b) Plagiarism prevention
Six studies used a randomized design and one used a controlled
before-and-after design to test interventions to change perceptions
of plagiarism. The results are summarized in Table 5.
In the Brown 2001 randomized controlled trial, students who re-
ceived a detailed educational description of plagiarism and how
it can be avoided scored higher on the ratings for severity of be-
haviour in examples of plagiarized text (verbatim copying or un-
acknowledged close paraphrasing) compared with students who
received a simpler warning statement on plagiarism or no infor-
mation when they were asked about a) their own views, b) per-
ceived staff view and c) perceived frequency of behaviour among
colleagues. Neither intervention influenced participants’ percep-
tion of the necessity for citing sources when writing or their per-
ception of the likelihood that colleagues would cite a source when
writing and assignment.
In the Schuetze 2004 randomized controlled trial, undergradu-
ate students who had to do a homework assignment of recogniz-
ing plagiarism after receiving a 30-minute presentation and hand-
outs with plagiarism definition and citation guidelines had better
perception of their own understanding of plagiarism and greater
confidence in their ability to avoid plagiarism in future compared
with the control group, which received the instruction but had no
homework.
In a cluster-randomized controlled trial (Dee 2012), use of an on-
line tutorial on understanding and avoiding plagiarism changed
students’ perception that they had good understanding of plagia-
rism in academic writing but not the perception of their actual
behaviour of avoiding plagiarism or their confidence in knowl-
edge of how to avoid it, or whether the instructor would notice or
address plagiarism in writing assignments.
The Compton 2008 randomized controlled trial used a two-stage
intervention to test the effect of messages about plagiarism (con-
trol, fear-based, guilt-based and cognitive-based experimental con-
ditions) and plagiarism justification on the attitudes of undergrad-
uate students. There was no significant effect of the experimental
condition on the attitudes towards plagiarism or its justification.
The Newton 2014 randomized controlled trial demonstrated that
a short training session on paraphrasing, patch-writing and plagia-
rism increased the confidence of undergraduate students in note-
taking from sources and in their referencing but not in paraphras-
ing source material in course assignments in comparison to no
intervention.
The Risquez 2011 randomized controlled trial showed that an on-
line, computer-based, one-hour tutorial on plagiarism prevention
completed individually as a part of a course was not successful in
20

 changing the attitudes of undergraduate students towards plagia-
rism. The intervention increased their perception of the serious-
ness of breaching academic guidelines, either as their own view
or as their assessment of lecturers’ view but not their expectations
from students in intervention examples.
The Chertok 2014 study used a controlled before-and-after design
to demonstrate that a course on academic integrity using a com-
bination of in-person and Internet-based lectures, discussion and
participation did not improve attitudes about academic integrity,
including plagiarism.
Secondary outcome
1. Participants’ reaction to the intervention
The results of seven studies that evaluated participants’ reaction
to interventions are summarized in Table 6.
a) Research ethics/integrity
In a randomized controlled trial (Aggarwal 2011), participants
were more satisfied with an on-site compared to an online course
in research ethics, particularly because of the value of group discus-
sions and the value of the course for work in biomedical research.
They also reported that the speed of covering the course material
in the online research ethics course was too fast.
In the Fisher 1997 study, students and staff favourably responded
to research ethics modules embedded within a standard course and
considered that teaching and testing materials were appropriate.
Students agreed that the ethics topics discussed in the modules
increased their interest in research ethics, and staff agreed that
ethics modules complemented and enhanced the curriculum.
b) Plagiarism prevention
In a randomized controlled trial of a web-based tutorial for re-
ducing plagiarism (Dee 2012), the intervention had no effect
on whether students liked the class, found it academically diffi-
cult or stressful, or procrastinated on writing assignments for the
course. In another randomized study comparing different instruc-
tions about plagiarism (Moniz 2008), students were most satis-
fied with student-centred instruction involving group and role-
playing, compared with lecture- and practice-based direct instruc-
tion or standard teaching, when assessing the interactivity of the
course, seatwork exercises and group work.
In two studies of using Turnitin software to reduce plagiarism in
student course work, participants’ satisfaction was high. In the
Kose 2011 study, 81% of the students using the software reported
that the software was easy to use and all thought that it was very
useful for checking their course essays, and in the Rolfe 2011, all
students reported positive experience in the formative feedback
they received from Turnitin during drafting and final submission
of their course essays. In the Walker 2008 study, students who
had paraphrasing practice to avoid plagiarism reported that the
training was useful and helpful.

Summary of main results
Our systematic review identified a range of interventions aimed at
reducing research misconduct. Most interventions involved some
kind of training, but methods and content varied greatly. The
training included face-to-face and online lectures, interactive on-
line modules, discussion groups, homework and practical exer-
cises. The success of the interventions was assessed on participants’
attitudes, knowledge and behaviour. Most studies did not use stan-
dardized or validated outcome measures, although a few used the
Plagiarism Knowledge Survey (Roig 1997). Participants included
undergraduates, postgraduates and academics from a range of re-
search disciplines and countries. It is therefore difficult to synthe-
size findings from studies with such diverse interventions, out-
comes and participants.
Briefly, and at the risk of oversimplifying these complex findings:
• various methods of training in research integrity had some
effects on participants’ attitudes to ethical issues (two studies
showed positive effects, four showed inconsistent effects) but
minimal (or short-lived) effects on their knowledge (three
studies);
• training about plagiarism and paraphrasing had varying
effects on participants’ attitudes towards plagiarism and their
confidence in avoiding it. Training that included practical
exercises appeared to be more effective (two positive studies, two
with mixed effects, two with no effect);
• training on plagiarism had inconsistent effects on
participants’ knowledge about, and ability to recognize,
plagiarism (four positive studies, three negative); active training,
particularly if it involved practical exercises or use of text-
matching software, generally decreased the occurrence of
plagiarism although results were not consistent (nine positive
studies, four negative studies, one with mixed effects);
• the design of a journal’s author contribution form affected
the truthfulness of information supplied about individuals’
contributions and the proportion of listed contributors who met
authorship criteria (two studies).
No studies assessed interventions designed to reduce other types
of misconduct such as data fabrication or falsification. Our search
did not include studies specifically dealing with training of re-
search ethics committees, where the need for systematic training
has recently been identified (Mhaskar 2015).

Interventions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and publication (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Many of the interventions assessed in the studies were complex,
such as lecture programmes, workshops or online training. In most
cases these interventions were inadequately described, so it would
be impossible to repeat the experiments or implement the inter-
vention that had been tested. It seems reasonable to assume that
many factors can influence the effectiveness of training, such as
the skills of the trainer, the quality and relevance of the material,
and the training medium (online or face-to-face) and environment
(group size, timing of sessions). The ’dose’ of the training (length of
sessions, number of sessions) may also influence effectiveness. Fur-
thermore, external factors may influence attitudes and behaviour
(e.g. a well-publicized or local misconduct case may raise aware-
ness of the penalties for misconduct), making historical controls
difficult to interpret. Not only do these factors make it difficult to
combine or compare findings between studies, they also decrease
the applicability of the evidence.
It was not possible to estimate the completeness of reporting or the
incidence of publication bias since educational studies are rarely
registered.
We cannot tell if the findings are applicable outside the popula-
tions included in the studies, which were mainly undergraduate
students. Factors affecting the behaviour and attitudes of other
populations, such as more experienced researchers, may be differ-
ent.
Quality of the evidence
We found the quality of includes studies to be highly variable.
Methods and participants were often poorly described. Some stud-
ies used randomized designs with reasonable, contemporaneous
controls. Many studies used weaker methods such as controlled
before-and-after designs. Few studies on attitude or knowledge
usedstandardizedorvalidatedoutcome measures, making findings
difficult to interpret or compare. Studies on plagiarism tended to
use more robust designs and employed more objective outcomes
such as the percentage of plagiarized text in an assignment.
Most included studies were short-term, measuring effects directly
after training. One study showed an effect immediately after train-
ing but this had disappeared three months later. It is uncertain
whether training of undergraduates or junior researchers will have
lasting effects.
Overall, the quality of evidence for the effectiveness of interven-
tions to prevent misconduct and promote integrity in research and
publication was very low. Our downgrading of the quality of evi-
dence, according to the GRADE approach, is due to high risk of
bias, indirectness and imprecision of the evidence.
We judged most of the included randomized controlled trials to
be at a high risk of bias in at least one of the assessed domains.
In the case of the non-randomized trials, there were no attempts
to alleviate the potential biases inherent in the non-randomized
design.
The heterogeneity in the results of the studies (’inconsistency’ in
GRADE) was considerable, with large variation in the direction
and magnitude of effects. However, much of this heterogeneity
can be explained by differences in the interventions and outcomes.
The available evidence is indirect, as the majority of studies in-
cluded only students (mostly undergraduate), while only a few
studies had experienced researchers as participants. Also, most of
the studies assessed surrogate outcomes (such as reaction to in-
tervention, change in attitudes and knowledge) rather than out-
comes relevant for practice (actual behavioural change), which
were mostly limited to plagiarism in students’ writing tasks.
The number of participants in the included studies was generally
small, and because the heterogeneity was too large to allow pooling
of results, we were unable to reduce this imprecision through meta-
analysis.
We did not attempt a formal analysis of publication bias or other
biases related to study size by assessing the asymmetry of a funnel
plot. However, selective publication of positive findings related to
commercial interests is not likely in this area of research.
It is important to keep in mind that research integrity and research
misconduct are terms that are relatively new in the field of pro-
fessional ethics (Komic 2015), and that there is little agreement
on the goals and content of training for responsible conduct of
research (RCR) (Kalichman 2014). Also, research misconduct is
difficult to detect and measuring subtle changes in behaviour re-
lated to responsible conduct of research usually relies on surrogate
or self reported outcomes, or both (Fanelli 2009; Marusic 2011).
This is the reason why it is difficult to design interventions to
prevent research misconduct and foster research integrity.
Potential biases in the review process
Our initial literature search was designed to be broad and inclu-
sive, since few specific keywords are available for studies of the
type we were seeking. It therefore resulted in a large number of
titles to check (more than 20,000). Although two review authors
checked these titles, it is possible that some eligible studies were
missed, although such omissions are unlikely to have led to any
systematic bias in the review. Also, we did not plan or conduct a
systematic search of grey literature (such as unpublished reports,
dissertations or theses). Due to the range of study designs and de-
ficient reporting in the publications, eligibility of the studies was
discussed extensively usually among three or four of the review
authors, including an expert methodologist, to ensure that only
study designs specified in the protocol (Marusic 2013) were in-
cluded in the review.
Some of the included studies were co-authored by the authors of
this review, which may have introduced bias in the review process.
To avoid this, the assessment of eligibility, data extraction and
’Risk of bias’ assessment for those studies was done independently

Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Antes et al published a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of ethics
instruction in sciences, in which they included 20 studies of dif-
ferent study designs (Antes 2009). Out of those, we included one
study in this systematic review (Clarkeburn 2002), and excluded
two studies after full-text assessment for eligibility (Kligyte 2008;
Mumford 2008). We excluded other studies from this systematic
review during abstract/full-text screening (Figure 1) because they
did not fit the inclusion criteria, or were published before 1990.
The scope of the Antes 2009 meta-analysis was to analyse training
and instruction in ethics in sciences (also including professional
ethics). They performed a meta-analysis based on expert reviewer
opinion of the outcome of the studies, rather than by combining
the actual outcomes. They concluded that the overall effectiveness
of ethics instruction was modest, but that programmes were more
likely to be effective if they were conducted as separate rather than
embedded activities in already existing courses, or if they were in-
teractive and based on real world examples.

Implication for methodological research
One of the major difficulties in attempting to synthesize the find-
ings from this review is the lack of standardized and validated
outcome measures, especially those assessing attitudes towards re-
search integrity and misconduct. The Plagiarism Knowledge Sur-
vey is a rare example of a validated tool to assess an outcome rele-
vant for research integrity (Roig 1997). However, it assesses only
one aspect of research misconduct, namely plagiarism, and it is
still not widely used among researchers. Development of other val-
idated tools, especially to assess practice-relevant outcomes such as
behavioural change, would greatly contribute to the advancement
of knowledge in the field of research integrity.
Another problem in interpreting the findings of studies in this
area is our lack of knowledge of the prevalence of various forms of
research andacademicmisconduct.We excludedstudiesof student
cheating (e.g. in exams) from this review but these show varying
rates across disciplines and countries. While we included studies
on undergraduate plagiarism, as we considered them relevant to
other types of plagiarism (e.g. in scholarly journals), few studies
interpreted their findings in the context of an overall or expected
rate of plagiarism. One further difficulty is that definitions of
plagiarism vary and, while text-matching software is an invaluable
screening tool, institutions generally recognize that output from
such tools must be interpreted carefully using expert judgement.
Studies on the prevalence of various types of misconduct have
generally relied on surveys of self reported misconduct (Fanelli
2009; Marusic 2011), which are likely to be prone to serious biases.
In most countries, institutions and funders rarely or never report
on the number of cases of suspected misconduct that have been
investigated or upheld, so it is impossible to make an accurate
estimate of the ’usual’ number of cases per thousand researchers
per year. Greater transparency would facilitate the interpretation
of studies designed to measure the effectiveness of interventions
to reduce misconduct. However, given that serious misconduct
appears to be rare (so far as we can tell), it is likely that only
large, robust studies over a reasonable time would be sensitive
to changes in prevalence. For example, a systematic follow-up of
researchers undergoing federally required training in responsible
conduct of research in the USA may provide better evidence for the
effectiveness of training on research integrity and establish possible
causative relationships.

Methods
Non-equivalent control group study design, with control group tested only after intervention
Data
Participants: 68 freshman-level (1st-year) psychology students enrolled into introductory lifespan
development course
Comparisons
Intervention (n = 35): over 6 weeks, students completed a series of weekly assignments in which
they paraphrased quotes from important psychology publications. Each assignment consisted of one
paragraph-long quote, containing approximately 100 to 125 words. Students paraphrased each quote
in 2 different ways (to practice paraphrasing techniques) and provided a citation after each (to reinforce
the notion of correct citation style); students then provided the reference for the source in APA style
Control (n = 33): no intervention during a 6-week course
Outcomes
Score on plagiarism definition test (total 6 points): (a) Recognition of plagiarism as a form of academic
dishonesty (including “cheating” or “stealing”), 1 point; (b) understanding that it is important to give
credit to the author/source, 1 point; (c) knowing that plagiarism is when you claim someone else’s
work as your own, 1 point; with (d) “work” described as someone else’s words, 1 point; (e) someone
else’s ideas, 1 point; and/or (f) someone else wrote the paper (internet, friend, etc.), 1 point

Methods
Non-equivalent control group study design with a historical control
Data
Participants: 266 undergraduate students in the first author’s abnormal psychology courses in spring
2004 and 2005 semesters and fall 2005 and 2006 semesters. The Spring 2004 class served as the
control group, and the remaining classes served as the experimental group
Comparisons
Intervention (n = 66): research integrity module within the course - an online self instructional module
made up of 4 sections: (a) Plagiarism Defined and Strategies to Avoid It, (b) Cheating Defined and
Strategies to Avoid It, (c) Penalties for Academic Misconduct, and (d) Academic Integrity Evaluation.
Examples of paraphrasing, 11-question quiz that had to be retaken until all correct answers
Control (n = 200): no module during the same course
Outcomes
Number of plagiarized course paper assignments, as measured by a combined use of commercial
plagiarism detection service (Turnitin) and a Google Internet search of passages of having been
plagiarized: “We only considered a paper to have been plagiarized if it included one or more passages
that was word-for-word the same as another source without appropriate citation and quotation marks.

Intervention 1 (n = 51): educational statement on plagiarism - the passage (270 words)
was designed to educate the student about the problem of plagiarism and how it can be
avoided. The passage gave an extensive description and an example of the correct way to
cite material. The tone of the passage was serious, referring to “scholarship” and “etiquette”
Intervention 2 (n = 54): warning statement on plagiarism - the passage (137 words) con-
tained a more limited definition of plagiarism, and there was no description of the correct
way to cite material. The warning went on to refer to the frequency of plagiarism as being

Methods
Non-equivalent control group study design, with testing only after intervention
Data
Participants: 116 undergraduate business students enrolled in online or on-site courses
Comparisons
Intervention 1 (n = 42): the instructional treatment for students included: 1) receiving instruction
during the class and using reference and citation resources available at the Purdue University Online
Writing Lab Website, 2) instructed to read the academic integrity policy in the University Code of
Student Conduct Handbook as a homework assignment, and given a 10-question true-false quiz in
the reading assignment, 3) brief discussion led by an instructor on what constitutes plagiarism, how
to avoid it and proper steps for paraphrasing which included examples of properly and improperly
paraphrased paragraphs, 4) originality report of an anonymous previous student’s written submission
shown and discussed during class as a negative example. Students were not required to purchase the
APA Publication Manual for their course work
Intervention 2 (n = 41): the instructional treatment for students included: 1) review of the academic
integrity policy in the University Code of Student Conduct Handbook and a quiz based on the
policy; 2) extended in-class discussion on what constitutes plagiarism, how to avoid it, and proper
paraphrasing techniques with examples; and 3) practice exercise in which students paraphrased 2
paragraphs. The exercise was graded by the instructor and returned to the students along with detailed
feedback. Further, to orient students to the power of Turnitin plagiarism detection software, an
originalityreportof ananonymous previous student’swrittensubmission wasalso shownand discussed
during class
Control (n = 33): minimal instruction about avoiding plagiarism. The extent of the instruction
consisted of an assignment to read the Code of Student Conduct for the university as it applied to
plagiarism and cheating and to send an e-mail to the instructor identifying several types of plagiaristic
behaviour identified in the Code of Student Conduct. This assignment came at the beginning of
the course. Several weeks before a writing assignment (“the capstone report”) was due, students were
reminded not to plagiarize. Students had to purchase the APA Publication Manual and read assigned
sections
Outcomes
1. Number of students whose report (“capstone writing assignment”) contained plagiarized text
2. Percentage of the text plagiarized

Compton 2008
Methods
Randomized controlled trial with 4 arms testing different inoculation messages against pla-
giarism. During Phase 1, participants completed questionnaires that gathered demographic
information and assessed initial attitudes towards plagiarism. During Phase 2, occurring
approximately 2 weeks after Phase 1, participants were presented with the inoculation treat-
ment message and then completed scales designed to assess attitudes towards plagiarism.
Participants in the control condition only completed the scales. Finally, during Phase 3,
occurring approximately 2 weeks after Phase 2, all participants received an attack message,
which attempted to justify plagiarism using either affective or rational justification. All
participants then completed scales assessing attitudes towards plagiarism (in phase 2) and
attitude toward position in attack message (in phase 3)
Data
Participants: 225 students from communication courses at a Midwestern university in the
USA. Eligibility criteria: 1) at least 18 years of age, 2) signed informed consent
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment conditions and the 2 attack
message conditions
Comparisons
Intervention 1 (n = 64): fear-based inoculation treatment message: focused on the likelihood
that students who plagiarize would be caught
Intervention 2 (n = 66): guilt-based inoculation treatment message: used an anticipated
guilt strategy, describing students’ feelings of guilt after cheating and the hurt plagiarism
causes professors
Intervention 3 (n = 57): rational inoculation treatment message: used evidence and rational
arguments and avoided affect-laden language
Control (n = 59): no intervention
Outcomes
1. Attitudes towards plagiarism, assessed by the following measures (7 point Likert scale,
from 0 = negative to 6 = positive):
a) Threat generated by inoculation messages (realization that one may encounter a message
designed to change existing attitude)
b) Attitude towards plagiarism
c) Importance or salience of the topic of plagiarism (involvement in the issue)
d) How often plagiarism is discussed (accessibility of the issue)
e) Vested interest in plagiarism (stake in the issue, thinking of the issue, being affected by
the issue in present or future, personal ability to handle issue)
2. Attitudes towards justification of plagiarism (attack messages in phase 3), assessed by the
following measures (7-point Likert scale, from 0 = more resistance to 6 = less resistance

Methods
Non-equivalent control group study design, with control group tested only after intervention
Data
Participants: 40 undergraduate university engineering students enrolled in academic writing course
Comparisons
Intervention (n = 17): use of Turnitin in practising avoiding plagiarism in academic writing - no prior
Turnitin experience, informed about the program, the originality reports and about how it works in
detecting plagiarism in several lectures with PowerPoint assisted presentations; a folder “Self-Study”
was created in one of these presentations and the students were informed that they could check their
work’s originality by submitting it to this folder and revise it if necessary before the final submission
for grading; students also practised using Turnitin by submitting their essays
Control (n = 29): no intervention - no prior Turnitin experience, no information about using the
program; not informed that their essays would be checked for originality using Turnitin
Outcomes
Per cent plagiarized text in submitted course assignments
Secondary outcome: views about experience of using Turnitin (only students in the intervention
group)

Landau 2002
Methods
Randomized controlled trial with 4 arms to assess whether teaching students about plagia-
rism by providing them with examples or providing them with feedback on a plagiarism
detection exercise would increase their ability to identify plagiarism and avoid it when
paraphrasing
Data
Participants: 94 undergraduate students attending freshman-level research course
Comparisons
Intervention 1 (n = not stated): feedback only - comparison of 2 texts to determine if
plagiarized; for the first example, participants were informed via a PowerPoint presentation
whether the passage had been plagiarized, and were then given a rationale for each answer
(e.g. the passage was plagiarized because the words were not altered sufficiently)
Intervention 2 (n = not stated): examples only - comparison of 2 texts to determine if
plagiarized; for the first example, participants were presented a brief definition of plagiarism
and 3 plagiarized examples (PowerPoint presentation about excerpts from a case in which
one romance novelist stole several short passages from another writer)
Intervention 3 (n = not stated): feedback/examples - comparison of 2 texts to determine if
plagiarized; participants received both the feedback and the examples
Control (n = not stated): no intervention - comparison of 2 texts to determine if plagiarized;
no feedback of examples

Intervention 2 (n = 515): training in avoiding plagiarism involving 1) a new 40-minute interactive
plagiarism seminar was delivered during teaching time allocated to one of the compulsory MPH
modules; 2) in the seminar, following a brief talk about plagiarism and Turnitin software, students
were provided with an anonymised copy of a detailed Turnitin report from a previous student who
had been penalized for plagiarism; students discussed the case in small groups and decided whether
plagiarism had taken place; what (if any) action should be taken; what action should be taken if a
similar Turnitin report was subsequently received for the same student, and how a student could avoid
plagiarism; after feedback and discussion students were informed about the outcome of the case; 3)

ratory on academic writing and referencing, and submitted their final essays to Turnitin
Outcomes
1. Number of students who plagiarized course work. Plagiarism was identified as: 1) 4 lines (or
more) of word-for-word copying; (2) 4 lines (or more) of poor paraphrasing; 3) lack of a citation
accompanying the evidence; 4) lack of a full reference relating to the evidence; 5) any combination
of the above. Plagiarism was also defined by a cut-off point of a 30% similarity score
2. Number submissions with plagiarism by grammatical error
3. Number submissions with grammatical error plus failure to acknowledge source
4. Failure to acknowledge sources
Secondary outcome: students’ and staff’s perceptions of using Turnitin (assessed only in the interven-

homework assignment which consisted of one page of text from an introduction section in
a published manuscript by the author, with all citations removed. The paraphrased material
could be easily identified in the chosen section. Other paraphrased sections were somewhat
harder to identify but provided good examples for class discussion. Students indicated each
sentence they believed should have a citation using consecutive numbers placed at the end
of the appropriate sentence. The assignment and grading criteria were explained during
approximately 5 minutes of class. Students completed 2 such graded homework assignments
over the course of the semester. After the first assignment, students received feedback for
missing and unnecessary citations
Control (n = 40): no intervention. The students received the 30-minute presentation and
handout on APA style in-text citations and referencing. There was no homework exercise
Outcomes
1. Mean score of citation problems in students’ term papers (on a scale from 1 - consistent
failure to cite properly throughout the paper to 5 - no apparent failures to cite)
2. Mean score of “Understanding of plagiarism” scale (on a scale from 1 - considerably
worse than at the beginning of the course to 5 - considerably improved)
3. Mean score on “Confidence in ability to avoid plagiarism” scale (on a scale from 1 -

Methods
Controlled before-and-after study
Data
Participants: 122 junior and senior college psychology majors attending an undergraduate research
methods course
Comparisons
Intervention (n = not stated): role-playing instruction in research ethics - 1) a lecture on research
ethics based on the ethical principles of the American Psychological Association (1981), 2) discussion,
which include a consideration of why proposed research must be evaluated in terms of the ethical
costs and benefits of doing the study as well as the costs and benefits of not doing the study. Students

were then given a homework assignment to find a recently published study that they consider to be
unethical. They were told to read the study carefully and to be prepared to presented it during the
next class. During the next class, students present their studies in a discussion led by the instructor.
Afterwards, they were asked to rate the cost and utility (benefit) of each study. Students were then
asked to role-play as “devil’s advocate” and defend the scientific value of their “unethical” study before
the rest of the class. Following this role-play, each student re-rated the cost and utility of the studies.
Finally, the re-evaluations were discussed to uncover how and why cost and utility ratings may have
changed as a result of the students advocating studies that they originally viewed as unethical
Control (n = not stated): no intervention
Outcomes
1. Change in utility rating for presented cases on a scale ranging from no cost or utility (0) to highest
cost or utility (100) after discussion of the case with the class as a peer-review board for students’
decision, in comparison to the students’ initial rating

Methods
Controlled before-and-after study
Data
Participants: 36 undergraduate students enrolled in 2 sections of methods in psychology course
Comparisons
Intervention (n = 19): paraphrasing training, consisting of: 1) a brief review of the University’s Aca-
demic Integrity Policy and a discussion of the rules for proper citation, 2) introduction of definitions
of plagiarism or patch-writing, 3) students’ paraphrasing notes for their first course assignment and
discussion about those, 3) practical work with paraphrasing notes for assignments during the courses,
4) guidelines for paraphrasing for final assignment during the semester
Control (n = 17): no intervention. The instructor for the control group presented a brief lecture on
plagiarism and paraphrasing at the beginning of the semester. Similar to the training group, students
in the control completed original research projects and wrote APA style empirical papers with similar
requirements for the number of articles included in the literature review. Students in the control group,
however, neither participated in an interactive session on plagiarism nor generated paraphrasing notes
Outcomes
Plagiarism in students exercise, measured by: a) mean number of copied word strings in a student
paper as a measure of plagiarism, b) mean number of word substitutions in a student paper as a
measure of plagiarism, c) mean number of word deletions in a student paper as a measure of plagiarism
Secondary outcome: usefulness of the course
Sources of funding
Not stated
Setting
Described as “a New England university” (USA). Study dates not reported
Notes
The assessments occurred in the middle of the semester and for the final course assignment. Final
assessment also included 3 additional measures of plagiarism: 1) word additions, 2) word reversals
and 3) average plagiarism score (average of all 5 measures added); plus the mean number of words of
students’ final course assignments

Appendix 1. Appendix 1: search strategies
The searches were based on the strategy developed in MEDLINE and adapted as appropriate to the specifications of each database and
website. The strategy was deliberately designed to capture a broad range of references and the ’explode’ feature was used wherever this
was applicable to the database. There were no language restrictions.
All information sources were searched most recently in April 2015 for publications from January 1990 to December 2014.

This review will be used by some of the authors as part of other research projects. AM reports that she was a co-author on two studies
included in the review. EW does not report conflict of Interest. HRR is one of the authors of the Comprehensive Meta Analysis (CMA)
software. AU does not report conflict of interest. DS reports that he was a co-author on one of the studies included in the review.
Measures were taken within the review team to prevent biased handling of their own studies by the review authors.

There were no major changes in relation to the published protocol (Marusic 2013), except that quantitative synthesis was not possible
due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes. The protocol planned for the inclusion of controlled before-and-after studies,
where we included not only the studies with before-and-after measurement for the control and intervention groups but also the studies
that had before-and-after measurement for the intervention group and a single (’postintervention’) measurement for the control group.
This was addressed as issue of concern in our ’Risk of bias’ assessment. We excluded controlled studies that reported outcomes measured
only after the intervention, without ’before-intervention’ measurement in the intervention groups.
There were also some changes in the search strategy, which we adapted to better capture the topic of the search and decrease the number
of retrieved but irrelevant items.
