SUMMARY
The high-mannose patch on HIV Env is a preferred
target for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs),
but to date, no vaccination regimen has elicited
bnAbs against this region. Here, we present the
development of a bnAb lineage targeting the high-
mannose patch in an HIV-1 subtype-C-infected
donor from sub-Saharan Africa. The Abs first ac-
quired autologous neutralization, then gradually
matured to achieve breadth. One Ab neutralized
>47% of HIV-1 strains with only �11% somatic hy-
permutation and no insertions or deletions. By
sequencing autologous env, we determined key res-
idues that triggered the lineage and participated in
Ab-Env coevolution. Next-generation sequencing of
the Ab repertoire showed an early expansive diversi-
fication of the lineage followed by independent matu-
ration of individual limbs, several of them developing
notable breadth and potency. Overall, the findings
are encouraging from a vaccine standpoint and sug-
gest immunization strategies mimicking the evolu-
tion of the entire high-mannose patch and promoting
maturation of multiple diverse Ab pathways.
INTRODUCTION
The isolation of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to
HIV-1 has driven efforts to design immunogens and improve
vaccination protocols to induce similar antibody (Ab) responses
and protect against HIV infection (reviewed in Burton et al.,
2012). These bnAbs target multiple regions on the viral spike
that are relatively conserved in either sequence or character
despite the tremendous global diversity of the HIV-1 Env protein.
These regions include the CD4 binding site, the high-mannose
patch centered on the glycan at N332 at the base of variable
loop 3 (V3), a quaternary epitope in variable loops 1 and 2 (V1-
V2) at the Env apex, the membrane-proximal external region of
gp41 (reviewed in Kwong and Mascola, 2012), and several epi-
topes recently identified at the gp120-gp41 interface (Blattner
et al., 2014; Falkowska et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014; Scharf
et al., 2014). The N332 supersite is commonly targeted by Abs
from HIV-infected individuals (Walker et al., 2010; Landais
et al., 2016), highlighting it as a favored region by the immune
system and therefore potentially amenable to vaccination to
elicit bnAbs. Abs targeting this region, including PGT121 and
PGT128, are among the most potent bnAbs isolated to date
(Walker et al., 2011), and passive administration of bnAbs target-
ing this region has been shown to prevent infection (Moldt et al.,
2012) and strongly impact ongoing infection in a non-human pri-
mate model (Barouch et al., 2013). The N332-supersite-targeting
bnAbs exhibit differential glycan usage for binding to this region
given that they approach Env from various angles (Kong et al.,
2013; Sok et al., 2014a), unlike the CD4 binding site, which has
a more restricted angle of approach (Scheid et al., 2011; Wu
et al., 2011). Together, these features make the N332 glycan re-
gion an attractive target for HIV vaccine design.
Although the natural development of bnAbs in humans pro-
vides strong proof of concept that they could be elicited, no vac-
cine has been able to induce such Abs. The major barriers
appear to be related to one or more unusual features found in

 all bnAbs isolated to date. High levels of somatic hypermutation
(SHM), as well as insertions and deletions (indels) to the germline
(GL) immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, suggest that an elaborate matu-
ration process might be required for development of these
bnAbs (Klein et al., 2013). Some have exceptionally long
CDRH3 regions, which might result from rare recombination
events (Briney et al., 2012). Furthermore, polyreactivity and au-
toreactivity have been reported for some bnAbs (Haynes et al.,
2005; Liu et al., 2015), possibly due to relaxed B cell tolerance
checkpoints in HIV-infected donors (Haynes et al., 2012). To
what extent these features are required for the acquisition of
neutralization breadth and potency of bnAbs remains poorly un-
derstood, yet such an understanding is critical for the design of
vaccine strategies aiming to elicit such Abs.
Studying natural Ab responses in HIV-infected individuals dur-
ing the course of infection and learning how B cells naturally
engage and mature in response to constantly evolving viral epi-
topes might inform vaccine design strategies. The evolution of
bnAb lineages in longitudinal samples targeting the CD4 binding
site (Liao et al., 2013b) and the V2 apex region (Doria-Rose et al.,
2014) has been described. Key changes in the autologous virus
at specific times during Ab development appear to be critical for
driving the acquisition of neutralization breadth and potency. It
has been previously reported that development of broad serum
neutralization targeting the N332 glycan might be triggered in
some donors by the shift of a glycan from the N334 to N332
position (Moore et al., 2012). However, isolation and character-
ization of the maturation of Abs targeting the N332 supersite in
longitudinal samples from an HIV-infected individual has not
yet been described.
Here, we describe the development of a bnAb lineage that tar-
gets the N332 glycan supersite in a donor from sub-Saharan Af-
rica. We isolated a lineage of Abs from multiple time points dur-
ing the maturation from non-broadly neutralizing Abs to bnAbs
through interactions with the autologous virus as it mutates to
escape recognition. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the
Ab repertoire revealed an early diversification of the lineage fol-
lowed by parallel maturation of various Ab limbs, several of
which led to neutralization breadth. In contrast to all Abs to the
N332 region previously isolated, these new Abs were capable
of significant breadth despite relatively low levels of SHM and
no indels, suggesting that extraordinary features are not an ab-
solute requirement for bnAbs.
RESULTS
A Broad Neutralizing Response Targeting the N332
Supersite Was First Detected at 33 Months Post-
Infection in Donor PC76
We characterized the breadth and potency of the serum neutral-
izing activity in 439 of a total of 613 IAVI (International Aids Vac-
cine Initiative) Protocol C participants (Landais et al., 2016).
Development of neutralizing activity in donor PC76 was exam-
ined with serum samples from 5 to 38 months post-infection
(mpi) tested against a cross-subtype panel of 37 viruses.
Neutralization of heterologous viruses was observed starting at
5 mpi and reached a peak of 68% of viruses neutralized by 33
mpi (Figures 1A and S1A). Serum neutralizing activity was
N332 dependent for most of the viruses tested (Figure S1B)
and throughout this time course (Figure 1B), confirming that
N332-dependent Ab responses were predominantly responsible
for the broad neutralizing activity developing in this donor.
Next, serum from 33 mpi was adsorbed on wild-type (WT) re-
combinant gp120 (rgp120) and rgp120 with a point mutation
eliminating the glycan at position N332 (N332A) (Figures 1C
and S1C). Serum depleted of Abs that bound WT rgp120
lost neutralizing activity, whereas N332A-rgp120 adsorbed
serum was comparable to the negative control BSA adsorbed
serum. This result confirmed that neutralizing Abs present in

Figure 1. Development of N332-Glycan-Specific Neutralizing Serum
Response in Donor PC76
(A) Neutralization assays were performed with serum isolated from donor
PC76 at various times post-infection, and multiple HIV-1 pseudoviruses were
used. Neutralization inhibitory dilution 50 (ID50) values calculated as 1/(serum
dilution at 50% inhibition of infection). Samples for which 50% neutralization
was not reached at a dilution of 1/50, were determined as having no neutral-
ization. The percent of viruses neutralized and ID50 geometric mean values are
shown for each subtype and overall values at the bottom.
(B) Neutralization assays were performed at the time points indicated;
92BR020 WT or N332A pseudovirus with PC76 donor serum was used.
(C) Serum from donor PC76 at 33 mpi was depleted of Abs binding to the
proteins listed on the x axis. This depleted serum was used in neutralization
assays with the eight pseudoviruses listed. Experiments were performed in
duplicate, and the means were used to calculate ID50 values.

 the serum exhibited differential binding to WT and N332A rgp120
proteins.
A Lineage of N332-Glycan-Targeting Abs
On the basis of the above results, we designed a strategy
to isolate B cells expressing B cell receptors specific to the
N332 glycan from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
samples of donor PC76 (Figure S2). To exclude strain-specific
or non-specific binding, WT rgp120 probes from virus strains
92BR020 (subtype B) and IAVIC22 (subtype C), which both
depleted neutralizing Abs from the PC76 serum (Figures 1C
and S1C), were used to identify B cells binding to both proteins.
The 92BR020 N332A rgp120 probe was used to isolate cells
that bound only when the N332 glycan was present. Single live
N332-specific IgG+ B cells identified as described in Figure S2
were sorted into plates for single-cell PCR amplification and
sequencing.
A lineage of 12 somatically related monoclonal Abs (mAbs)
from a total of five time points from 16 to 38 mpi was identified
from donor PC76. Selected features of PCDN (Protocol C, lab
code DN) mAbs are summarized in Figure 2A. This Ab lineage
used the IGHV4-34*01 heavy chain (HC) variable gene segment
(V-gene) and IGHJ5*01 joining gene segment (J-gene). The di-
versity gene segment (D-gene) usage could not be reliably deter-
mined. The isolated mAbs had CDRH3 lengths of 22 amino acids
(aa). The HCs of the mAbs showed �4%–5% nucleotide (nt) mu-
tation from the GL (�8% aa) at 16 mpi and matured to �16% nt
mutation (�26% aa) for a mAb isolated at 38 mpi. Light chains
(LCs) used genes IGKV3-20*01 and IGKJ1*01 and ranged from
�5%–11% nt mutation. Phylogenetic analysis of the mAb HC
and LC sequences (Figure 2B) and aa sequence alignments (Fig-
ure S3) showed the sequences maturing correspondingly over
time. In contrast to all previously isolated bnAbs that target the
high-mannose patch, no indels were introduced into either the
HC or LC sequences during affinity maturation.
The PCDN Ab Lineage Matures toward Heterologous
Neutralization and is Dependent on Specific Glycans
The PCDN mAbs were characterized for binding to rgp120s of
various isolates and different subtypes. All mAbs exhibited pref-
erential binding to WT rgp120 and reduced affinity for N332A
rgp120, as measured by ELISA (Figure 3A). The Abs were then
tested for neutralization of a cross-subtype panel of 37 pseudo-
viruses (Figures 3B and S4A). As anticipated, Abs isolated at the
earliest time point, PCDN-16A and 16B, had limited neutraliza-
tion breadth, 5% and 11% of viruses, respectively. However,
consistent with the kinetics of the development of serum neutral-
ization (Figure 1A), Abs isolated at 33 and 38 mpi neutralized
65%–70% of HIV-1 strains.
We tested the three most mature Abs, PCDN-33A and PCDN-
38A and 38B, on a 110-virus panel for a better representation of
globally circulating HIV-1 strains. Potency and breadth were
reduced overall, primarily due to the different composition of
the large panel (Figures 3C and S4B), which is more diverse
and includes a greater number of subtype AE recombinants.
The majority of subtype AE viruses (91%) have an N334-glycan
site instead of N332 (Sok et al., 2014a); <10% were neutralized
by PCDN mAbs. PCDN Abs failed to neutralize all viruses that
lacked the N332 glycan site, and viruses with a Tyr at position
330, instead of the more common His, were also not neutralized,
pointing to N332 and H330 as critical residues for neutralization
by these mAbs.
Specific glycan types are essential for binding of Abs targeting
the N332 glycan region, and promiscuity in glycan usage has
been observed for some bnAbs (Mouquet et al., 2012; Sok
et al., 2014a). PCDN-33A and PCDN-38A and 38B were tested
against pseudoviruses produced in cells treated with glycosi-
dase inhibitors, kifunensine or swainsonine, or prepared in
UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:a-3-D-mannoside b1/2-N-ace-
tylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI)-deficient HEK293S cells to
determine their dependency on certain glycan types. Although
all three Abs were sensitive to kifunensine, neutralization by
PCDN-38A and PCDN-38B was more severely affected than
that by PCDN-33A (Figure 3D). Neutralization was lost for most
HEK293S-produced viruses for all three Abs. Swainsonine treat-
ments mostly had no effect, except on neutralization of a few vi-
ruses by PCDN-38A and PCDN-38B (Figure 3D). Swainsonine
does not affect hybrid glycans but blocks processing to complex
glycans, and GnTI deficiency leads to loss of both hybrid and
complex glycans (Doores and Burton, 2010). Therefore, in
most cases, PCDN mAbs seem to require hybrid glycans for
neutralization. The direct binding of PCDN mAbs to glycans
was also tested with a glycan array. Of the tested glycans, all
PCDN mAbs bound only to Man9GlcNAc2 and no other detect-
able binding was observed (Figure 3E), whereas PGT128 bound
to Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8 as previously reported (Walker et al.,

 2011). No binding to hybrid glycans was observed, suggesting
that although they are required for neutralization, the affinity of
the Abs for hybrid glycans is not high enough to detect their bind-
ing to the array. Thus, both high-mannose and hybrid glycans
appear to be important for binding of the PCDN mAbs.
To map the residues involved in recognition of Env, Ala substi-
tution mutants of JR-CSF Env were made and neutralization was
assessed with the three most mature PCDN Abs because only
these were capable of neutralizing JR-CSF. Mutations to the po-
tential N-glycosylation sites (PNGSs) of N332 and N301 glycans

3. Binding
and
Neutralization
of
PCDN mAbs
(A) PCDN Abs were tested by ELISA for binding to
rgp120, and EC50 values (mg/mL) are listed. If 50%
binding was not reached at 100 mg/mL of Ab, the
Abs were considered non-binding (>100).
(B) A heterologous panel of 37 pseudoviruses was
tested for neutralization by PCDN mAbs. The
percent neutralization and geometric mean of IC50
values (mg/mL) are shown for each HIV-1 virus
subtype; overall values are at the bottom. All
samples for which 50% neutralization was not
reached at 100 mg/mL were determined as having
no neutralization. The geometric mean was calcu-
lated only with viruses that were neutralized.
(C) A heterologous virus panel of 110 pseudovi-
ruses was tested for neutralization by the 3 most
mature mAbs and the percentage of viruses
neutralized is shown for each subtype of HIV-1 vi-
rus; overall values are listed at the bottom of the
table.
(D) Neutralization assays were performed with
PCDN Abs and the indicated pseudoviruses pro-
duced in HEK293T cells in the presence of kifu-
nensine or swainsonine or in HEK293S cells.
Neutralization IC50 values were calculated and
presented as a fold increase relative to neutraliza-
tion of WT pseudoviruses produced in untreated
cells.
(E) Glycan array binding by PCDN mAbs and
PGT128 for Man9GlcNAc2 and Man8. ELISA and
neutralization experiments were performed in trip-
licate, and the means were used to calculate EC50
and IC50 values. Glycan array was performed in
duplicate, and values are from a representative
experiment.
completely abolished neutralization (Fig-
ure S4C). N156A, S158A, and F159A also
led to loss of neutralization, suggesting
that the N156 glycan is involved in Ab
binding. In contrast, little to no sensitivity
to mutations at the N295 PNGS was
observed for JR-CSF. Similar glycan-site
dependencies were observed for other
heterologous viruses (Figure S4D). Muta-
tions to Y177 and L179 in V2, as well as
a number of residues in V3, also had
moderate effects, including those of the
324GDIR327 motif, which has been re-
ported to make extensive contacts with
PGT124 and PGT128 (Garces et al.,
2014), and nearby residues. Mutating I307 had a strong impact
in particular on PCDN-38A and PCDN-38B; this residue has
been suggested to be part of a conserved hydrophobic core
structure with I309 and F317 (Jiang et al., 2010). The Ala scan re-
sults show that mutation of these residues can affect the ability of
PCDN Abs to recognize Env.
Some HIV bnAbs have been shown to exhibit polyreactivity
and/or autoreactivity, and it has been proposed that this unusual
feature contributes to the development of broadly neutralizing
activity (Haynes et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2015). We sought to
1218
Immunity 44, 1215–1226, May 17, 2016
 determine whether the PCDN Abs exhibited auto- or polyreactiv-
ity as measured by ELISA against a panel of antigens previously
described (Wardemann et al., 2003). Histones were bound by a
few of the mAbs (22A and 27C), but the 33 mpi and later Abs
did not show any detectable polyreactivity (Figure S4E). We
also measured binding to HEp-2 cells, and PCDN-27D was the
only one that showed detectable fluorescent signals (Figure S4F).
Overall, the PCDN mAbs demonstrated weak to no auto- or pol-
yreactivity, with the exceptions described.
Autologous Virus and the bnAb Lineage Co-evolved
within Donor PC76
Changes in Env sequence can provide information as to how the
virus adapted to the immune response after infection and might
have driven the maturation of a bnAb lineage. A total of 76 autol-
ogous env genes were cloned and sequenced from PC76
plasma at multiple time points. A phylogenetic analysis of the vi-
rus full-length env sequences shows their course of evolution
(Figure S5A).
Viruses pseudotyped with the autologous env were tested for
neutralization by the 12 mAbs (Figure 4A). The viruses from 5 mpi
were not neutralized by any of the earliest mAbs (from months 16
and 22), which neutralized only viruses from 10 mpi. The month-
16 viruses were no longer neutralized by these Abs, demon-
strating viral escape. This suggests that the lineage was trig-
gered by viruses emerging between months 5 and 10. When
the 5 mpi virus was tested for neutralization by serum, all but
the 5 mpi serum were able to neutralize the virus, supporting
this time frame (Figure S5B). All Abs isolated past 33 mpi dis-
played both strong autologous breadth and potency, neutral-
izing almost all of the viruses tested up to month 22. The first
mAb that showed autologous breadth but weak potency was
isolated at 27 mpi (PCDN-27B). Interestingly, these Abs were
able to neutralize the 5 mpi viruses, in contrast to the earliest
Abs. However, from 27 mpi on, most of the viruses fully escaped
all PCDN mAbs.
When the Env aa changes were examined, seven out of nine
clones from 10 mpi simultaneously mutated E328 to a Lys while
deleting a glycan site at N335 by mutating T337 to an Ala (Fig-
ure 4B). The N335 PNGS is present in <1% of virus strains on
the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, making this PNGS a
unique feature of the PC76 autologous virus. In contrast to
N334, N335 could potentially be glycosylated together with
N332. This E328K mutation was then further mutated to an Ala
in all of the viruses isolated from 16 mpi and later. The N335
PNGS was initially reverted back in most clones at 16 and 19
mpi and then removed again in 26 of 28 virus clones from 22
mpi and later. All of the viruses from 27 mpi and later that were
not neutralized by any of the PCDN Abs had removed the
N332 PNGS (N332K or S334N), which was likely the final route
of escape.
To test whether these residues indeed had a role, mutagenesis
of the autologous virus from 5, 10, and 19 mpi was performed
(Figure 5A). When the 5 mpi virus was mutated to have both
E328K and N335A mutations, some early Abs were now able
to neutralize the virus. When the mutations were introduced indi-
vidually, this increased sensitivity was not observed, suggesting
the combination of mutations contributed to the recognition of
the virus by the early PCDN lineage Abs. If the 10 mpi virus
was either reverted to the 5 mpi form, K328E, or mutated to
the later form, K328A, neutralization by all the early Abs was
knocked out, demonstrating escape, whereas PCDN-27B and
later Abs were still able to neutralize these viruses. However,
when the 19 mpi virus was reverted to A328K with the N335
glycan, neutralization was not restored. Reversal of an escape
mutation is more difficult because there might be additional mu-
tations involved that are not in the vicinity of the epitope and
harder to pinpoint. However, when the N332 PNGS was
removed from the 19 mpi virus, neutralization by all the PCDN
Abs was completely lost, which was also the case for N332
PNGS mutations of earlier viruses. Once the N332 PNGS was
eliminated, the virus completely escaped neutralization by the
PCDN Ab lineage, consistent with all the heterologous virus
neutralization results (Figure S4B).
The 10 mpi virus was neutralized by most of the PCDN Abs, al-
lowing for mutagenesis studies to map the change in contact
residues over time. Mutations to PNGSs showed that N295,
N301, and N332 were critical (Figure 5B). Loss of glycosylation
sites at N301 and N332 knocked out neutralization for all the
Abs, although N295 PNGS mutation did not greatly affect
PCDN-27B and late Abs. Loss of the N137 glycan site in the 10
mpi virus potentiated all the Abs except those that didn’t
neutralize this virus to start with. An Ala scan of the N332-prox-
imal V3 region was also performed. Mutations to residues D322
to K328 knocked out or weakened neutralization by the majority

 of the early Abs, with the exception of I323A and I326A, which
had little to no effect. The 33 mpi and later Abs were largely un-
affected by these mutations. The H330A mutation knocked out
PCDN-27B neutralization and reduced the potency of later
Abs. Similarly to the results from the 110-virus panel and JR-
CSF alanine scan (Figures S4B and S4C), this suggests that
the later Abs matured to become less dependent on residues
in the GDIR motif but still rely on N332 and N301 glycans and
H330 to interact with Env.
NGS of the PCDN Ab Lineage
To examine the longitudinal maturation of the PCDN Ab line-
age, we performed NGS of Ab HCs by using RNA isolated
from approximately 106 PBMCs from time points 5–66 mpi.
Experimental details can be found in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures and Figure S6A. Raw Ab sequences were
corrected with molecular barcodes and GL gene assignments
were made with AbStar (data not shown). Ab lineages were as-
signed with Clonify (Briney et al., 2016), and the PCDN lineage
was identified by a homology search with the panel of PCDN
mAbs.
Although lineage members were identified at all time points
between 16 and 44 mpi, there was a pronounced peak at 22
mpi, immediately prior to the development of neutralization
breadth and potency (Figure 6A). The subsequent drop might
be due to the virus escaping neutralization by this lineage around
27 mpi (Figure 4A). To verify that this frequency peak was not an
artifact of sequencing or pre-sequencing amplification, we
amplified and sequenced additional longitudinal samples by us-
ing different sample preparation methods (50 rapid amplification

the
same frequency pattern in each case
(Figure S6B).
NGS identified a PCDN lineage seq-
uence with high homology to the GL V-
and J-genes, bearing a single aa differ-
ence in the J-gene. This least mutated
sequence was selected as the unmutated
common ancestor (UCA) for HC (Figure S3). A UCA IgG was ex-
pressed by pairing the HC with an inferred LC that was reverted
directly to GL. The UCA IgG had only minimal binding to some
heterologous rgp120 proteins and no binding to the autologous
rgp120s tested by ELISA (Figures S6C and S6D). In addition, no
neutralization was observed for the UCA for any of the viruses of
the 37-virus panel or any autologous viruses tested (data not
shown).
Phylogenetic analysis of the PCDN lineage (Figure 6B) re-
vealed multiple large limbs that diverged early in the lineage
lifespan, almost as soon as the lineage was initiated, and inde-
pendently matured in parallel. A genetic divide was observed
in the lineage phylogeny, beyond the peak of frequency
described above, where most branches did not develop
beyond 27 mpi and seemingly reached a dead end. This sug-
gests the occurrence of a virus-induced lineage-sieving event
near 27 mpi due to viral escape and a need for early intra-line-
age diversification to achieve lineage longevity. Interestingly,
more than one of the limbs led to Abs capable of heterologous
neutralization, including the ones leading to the broad and
potent Abs, PCDN-33A and PCDN-38A and 38B. In addition,
sequencing identified another long-lived lineage branch that
might have developed breadth and from which we were un-
able to isolate Abs by B cell sorting. Therefore, within this sin-
gle donor, multiple developmental pathways led to Abs that
acquired breadth. Together, early diversification and parallel
maturation appear to be central to the development of a broad
Ab response.
When analyzing the lineage phylogeny, we noticed a sub-
stantial discrepancy between the phylogenetic evolution of
1220
Immunity 44, 1215–1226, May 17, 2016
 the lineage and the divergence from GL over time. Although
GL divergence (GD), measured as the percent nucleotide
change from UCA, appeared to plateau at 33 mpi (top panel,
Figure 6C), the tree-adjusted evolutionary distance (ED) from
UCA continued to increase after 33 mpi (middle panel, Fig-
ure 6C). To quantify this discrepancy, we calculated the ratio
between the GD rate of mutation and tree-adjusted ED rate
of increase (bottom panel, Figure 6C). Until 33 mpi, the
GD:ED ratio remained relatively constant at approximately
0.01, suggesting that GD roughly approximated total ED. After
33 mpi, however, there was a sharp increase in the ED:GD ra-
tio, which indicated that GD was underestimating total ED.
Because both were calculated at the nucleotide level, this
result suggests repeated somatic mutations at the same posi-
tion; re-mutating a previously mutated site would increase ED
but would not change GD. Presumably, the number of activa-
tion-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) hotspot sequences,
WRCY (Martin et al., 2002), should decrease with continued
SHM. When we assessed the number of AID hotspots for
the PCDN lineage over time, we observed a steady decrease
that was not seen for a random sample of Ab sequences (Fig-
ure S6E). Therefore, as an Ab lineage matures, SHM appears
to continue to occur at previously mutated sites despite the
loss of hotspot motifs, suggesting a strong selection pressure
for these positions.

Crystal Structures of PCDN Fabs
The structural evolution of the PCDN line-
age Abs could provide explanation of how
they mature to gain breadth or potency.
PCDN-27A and PCDN-27B are situated on the same branch of
Ab maturation (Figure 6B), yet 27A has limited heterologous
neutralization in comparison to 27B (Figure 3B).
To understand this functional leap, we determined the crys-
tal structures of PCDN-27A and PCDN-27B Fabs (Figure 7A).
Both Fabs have a protruding ‘‘dagger’’-like shape with the
CDRH3 ‘‘blade’’ rising �16 A
˚ above the other CDR loops (Fig-
ure 7A). The extended CDRH3 will most likely penetrate the
glycan shield and establish contacts with the underlying pro-
tein motif. The aromatic residues positioned on both sides of
the CDRH3 loop (Figure S7A), Y103, Y106, and W107, could
be interacting with the Env 324GDIR327 residues or the carbo-
hydrates at the high-mannose patch through stacking interac-
tions similar to PGT124 (Garces et al., 2014). The variable HC
and LC regions of both PCDN-27A and PCDN-27B Abs align
well with a Ca RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) of 0.49 A
˚
(Figure 7A). However, the tip of the CDRH3 in PCDN-27B ap-
pears to be tilted �10 A
˚ in comparison to PCDN-27A. Before
relating this difference to functionality, we investigated the
crystal packing of both Fabs. When the structure of PCDN-
27A is superimposed on that of PCDN-27B within the crystal
lattice, the CDRH3 loop of 27A would clash with the constant
region of a symmetry-related molecule of 27B (Figure S7B).
Thus, the slight variation in the CDRH3 loops between the
two Fabs is probably due to crystal packing and is likely not
Immunity 44, 1215–1226, May 17, 2016
1221
 the cause of the observed greater breadth and potency of
PCDN-27B.
According to the sequence alignments for PCDN-27A and
PCDN-27B (Figure S3), there were no differences between the
two in CDRH1 or CDRH3, whereas the FRH3s were distinct.
Although this sequence variability was not translated into struc-
tural variation, the electrostatic surface indicated a shift from res-
idues with negative charges in PCDN-27A to positive charges in
PCDN-27B (Figure 7B). This suggests that FRH3 might be impor-
tant for neutralization of both autologous and heterologous vi-
ruses. In addition, we noticed two PNGSs in FRH1 (N26) and
FRH3 (N68) of PCDN-27B. Density was observed in the crystal
structure at N26, confirming the presence of an N-linked glycan,
but not at N68, due to either disorder or to non-use of the PNGS
(Figure S7C). However, from the position of the N26 glycan in the
Fab structure, it seems unlikely that this glycan would contribute
to the greater breadth of PCDN-27B than PCDN-27A.
We compared the structural features of PCDN-27A against the
other N332-targeting bnAbs for which crystal structures have
been solved (Garces et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2013; Pejchal
et al., 2011). The Ca RMSD was lowest for PGT135, showing
overall the greatest structural similarity (Figure S7D). However,
the CDRH3 of PCDN-27A (22 aa) is longer than that of PGT135
(18 aa), and PCDN-27A does not have any insertions, unlike
PGT135, which has a 5 aa insertion in CDRH1.
DISCUSSION
The description herein of the developmental pathway of a broad
neutralizing response to the N332 glycan supersite on HIV-1
Env is encouraging from a vaccine design standpoint. Although
other high-mannose-patch-targeting bnAbs may be superior in
both breadth and potency in comparison to the PCDN Abs,
Abs of this lineage notably did not have any indels and, in the
case of PCDN-33A, achieved close to 50% breadth (>85%
and 60% for subtypes B and A, respectively) with �11% overall
SHM, a level that is achievable through vaccination (Liao et al.,
2013a; Pappas et al., 2014; Wrammert et al., 2008). The PCDN
mAbs therefore represent a finding that provides optimism for
attempts to induce bnAbs to the high-mannose patch through
vaccination.

Auto-
or
polyreactivity
has
been
observed to be relatively more prevalent
in HIV bnAbs (Liu et al., 2015) and has
been suggested to be a hurdle for bnAb
development. Although the PCDN Abs overall exhibited very
low levels of auto- or polyreactivity, the GL VH gene of the
PCDN lineage, IGHV4-34*01, is known to have autoreactive
properties due to a hydrophobic motif (Ala-Val-Tyr; AVY) in
FRH1 (Pascual et al., 1991; Pascual et al., 1992). The corre-
sponding B cells are mostly suppressed or anergic (Pugh-Ber-
nard et al., 2001), but in some circumstances might develop,
as in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, who have
compromised B cell tolerance checkpoints (Cappione et al.,
2005), or in healthy donors upon repetitive exposure to antigens
(Sabouri et al., 2014). In HIV-infected donors, a higher preva-
lence of VH4-34 Abs has been reported, possibly due to a break-
down of tolerance, which correlates with broadly neutralizing
serum activity (Kobie et al., 2012). Interestingly, some Abs of
the lineage acquired a PNGS in FRH1 (most likely glycosylated,
given that corresponding density was observed in the crystal
structure) immediately downstream of the AVY motif, reminis-
cent of changes diminishing self-reactivity described by Sabouri
et al. (2014). Furthermore, some of the PCDN Abs lost the
CDRH2 PNGS at position 52, characteristic of the VH4-34 GL
VH; glycosylation at this site has been speculated to decrease
binding to foreign antigens. Together, the data suggest that as
PCDN Abs mature, they mutate away from the features
described to prevent the development of VH4-34 Abs. Further
studies will need to determine whether and how the autoreactiv-
ity properties of VH4-34 played a role in the elicitation of the
PCDN lineage and whether this might be a potential limitation
to triggering this Ab lineage through vaccination.
Study of the autologous virus neutralization revealed that it
was not an early virus but a virus emerging between 5 and
10 mpi that triggered the PCDN lineage, in part as a conse-
quence of a E328K charge change and the removal of a PNGS
at 335 that increased the sensitivity to early Abs. The N335
PNGS is rarely observed in global HIV strains, and it is not known
whether N335 is indeed glycosylated or what specific type of
glycosylation it might acquire. The E328K and T337A changes
might have been selected through pressure from another earlier
autologous non-broad Ab lineage—given that there was no evi-
dence of breadth from serum neutralization at this stage— that
targeted the same region as the PCDN lineage and possibly
acted as a helper lineage (Gao et al., 2014). A further mutation
1222
Immunity 44, 1215–1226, May 17, 2016
 at 328 led to escape from early and intermediate Abs and might
have played a role in driving selection of the most mature broad
Abs. A loss of the N332 PNGS past 27 mpi led to escape from all
the PCDN Abs, suggesting the termination of antigenic stimula-
tion at this point. However, PCDN-related Ab sequences were
observed by NGS to mature up to 44 mpi, suggesting either
the persistence of some viral antigenic stimulation or the
existence of a delay between Ab-mediated pressure and the
appearance of memory B cells in the peripheral blood, as seen
in previous bnAb lineage studies (Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Liao
et al., 2013b; Wu et al., 2015).
Mapping of the PCDN mAbs on the 10 mpi autologous virus
revealed a divide between early and late Abs. Many of the V3
residues upstream of N332, including previously reported
G324, D325, and R327, severely affected neutralization of
the early Abs. However, even some early Abs, such as
PCDN-16B, were able to tolerate these mutations, showing
that diversity in the mode of recognition of the base of the
V3 loop started early. These V3 mutations, however, did not
severely affect the 33 mpi and later Abs, other than the
H330A mutation. H330 has been reported to be part of the epi-
topes for PGT135 (Kong et al., 2013) and PGT122 (Pancera
et al., 2014), so it is conceivable that it could also affect the
PCDN mAbs. The H330 residue also might have a role in posi-
tioning the N332 glycan in the correct orientation with its large
aromatic ring as opposed to actually interacting with the mAbs
for recognition. Overall, the results confirm that the V3 base is
a protein anchor point recognized through various modes by
Abs targeting the N332 supersite. The most mature and broad
Abs are able to tolerate mutations in the protein anchor region,
possibly due to recognition of the backbone, as seen in
PGT128. However, because the V3 base is highly conserved
(GDIR motif found in >78% viruses), backbone recognition
should not presumably provide an advantage over side-chain
recognition in terms of breadth. The evolution in the mode of
recognition of the V3 base by the PCDN lineage might thus
be a by-product of affinity improvement toward the N332
glycan and nearby protein anchors. This evolution might be al-
lowing the most mature Abs to accommodate the diversity
surrounding the conserved V3 base, coincidently granting het-
erologous neutralizing activity.
Glycans have a large role in determining PCDN mAb recogni-
tion of Env. Glycan array results suggested that high-mannose
glycans are important for PCDN Ab binding. Although no affinity
for processed glycans was detected on the array (data not
shown), neutralization by the PCDN lineage appears to depend
on the presence of hybrid glycans. Hybrid or complex glycans
are mostly found at position N301 in the glycan patch of the
Env, whereas high-mannose glycans are mostly found at N295
and N332 (Pritchard et al., 2015). Accordingly, mutation of the
N301 PNGS in the autologous or heterologous viruses invariably
led to greatly reduced neutralization. It is likely that binding to
hybrid or complex glycans alone on an array does not provide
enough affinity for detection. Differences between the mature
Abs were noticeable given that PCDN-33A was not as depen-
dent on hybrid or complex glycans as PCDN-38A and PCDN-
38B were. Whereas N301 and N332 PNGSs were crucial for
binding of all the PCDN Abs, the N295 PNGS was required for
neutralization by all the Abs up to 27 mpi except for PCDN-
27B. Tolerating the absence of the N295 glycan accompanies
and might contribute to breadth. Similarly to the PGT121 family,
neutralization by the PCDN Abs improved when the N137 PNGS
was removed, suggesting a shielding effect by this glycan. The
sensitivity to loss of the N156 glycan points to a possible interac-
tion with this glycan as well. This is not surprising, given that
proximity to this glycan has been seen for PGT122, which might
be recognizing Env in a similar fashion to the PCDN Abs (Pancera
et al., 2014).
According to the crystal structures of the PCDN Fabs, these
Abs have more similarities with PGT135 than with PGT128 and
PGT124. PGT135 recognizes different glycans at the high-
mannose patch, interacting with glycans at N386 and N392.
However, none of the PCDN mAbs are affected by the loss of
PNGSs at N386 or N392, and the glycan dependency of these
Abs appears more similar to that of the PGT121 and PGT128
families. The two Fab structures that we have determined,
PCDN-27A and PCDN-27B, are on the same branch of the line-
age in the affinity maturation process and are structurally very
similar. It is intriguing that, given the limited number of aa
changes, PCDN-27B is fairly broad compared to PCDN-27A,
which exhibits no heterologous neutralization. Changes in elec-
trostatic charge between the Fabs might help provide an expla-
nation, although this might apply to just this single branch and
might not be relevant to all Abs of the lineage that develop
breadth.
The NGS results for the PCDN Ab lineage illustrate an Ab
response that finds multiple approaches to attack an ever-
changing target. The first PCDN-related sequences were
observed at 16 mpi, although autologous virus escape suggests
the lineage was triggered earlier, presumably between 5 and 10
mpi. This again shows a delay, although shorter than the time lag
following complete lineage escape described above, between
apparent Ab pressure on the virus and presence of the corre-
sponding memory B cells in the peripheral blood. The phyloge-
netic tree of the PCDN-related sequences showed a burst of
diversification at 16–22 mpi shortly after the lineage was elicited,
Then, from 27 mpi and beyond, there seemed to be a focusing of
maturation on a limited number of branches, with recurring
replacement of residues at a limited number of sites within the
Ab sequence, suggesting a fine-tuning of Abs for greater affinity
after the initial diversification. Several branches continued to
progress in evolutionary distance, but the majority were stunted
and did not progress beyond 27 mpi, leading to apparent dead
ends, as seen in previous bnAb lineage studies (Bhiman et al.,
2015; Pappas et al., 2014). Of the branches that continued to
evolve, two were able to develop Abs that had breadth and po-
tency comparable to other previously described bnAbs, and two
other branches led to Abs with moderate breadth. There was an
additional branch with mature, potentially neutralizing Abs that
were not isolated and hence not characterized. Therefore, in
this donor, it was remarkable that several Ab branches diverged
very early and evolved in parallel toward breadth and potency.
This demonstrates that within a single donor and a single Ab line-
age, several pathways can evolve for selection of bnAbs against
the high-mannose patch and therefore enable multiple ap-
proaches for targeting this region. Development of other bnAb
lineages reported also suggests an early diversification, but
one followed by a more restricted B cell selection (Doria-Rose
Immunity 44, 1215–1226, May 17, 2016
1223
 et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2013b). This might be related to the mul-
tiple modes of Ab recognition of the N332 region, in contrast to
the CD4 binding site and the V1-V2 apex.
Our results support the idea that the N332 glycan region might
be a favorable vaccine target. Contrary to other bnAbs targeting
this site (Mouquet et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2011), the PCDN Abs
attained broad neutralization at relatively low levels of SHM and
without indels in either HCs or LCs. The multi-limb lineage devel-
opment that leads to varied solutions to breadth suggests that
rational vaccine design aiming at eliciting bnAbs targeting the
N332 region, as with serial lineage-based immunogens, might
be most efficient if not restricted to a precise narrow path of
development. Immunization strategies would most likely benefit
by promoting simultaneous maturation of multiple pathways
through the use of immunogens that mimic the evolution of the
entire N332 supersite rather than focusing on the precise epitope
of a particular bnAb.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Specimens
Serum and PBMC samples were obtained from donor PC76, enrolled in the
IAVI Protocol C longitudinal HIV-1 infection cohort. IAVI Protocol C enrolled
613 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa who were rapidly screened for HIV
Abs after recent exposure to HIV-1. Samples were collected with written
informed consent, and clinical protocols were approved by the appropriate
ethics and research committees.
Neutralization Assays
Neutralization assays were performed by incubating Abs or sera with HIV-
1 pseudoviruses that are capable of one round of infection to TZM-BL
cells (Walker et al., 2009). Serum depletion was performed with Tosylacti-
vated Dynabeads (Life Technologies) conjugated with BSA or with WT and
N332A 92BR020 rgp120 proteins. Serum samples were depleted of Abs
binding to these proteins through multiple rounds of immunoprecipitation
(Li et al., 2009) as confirmed by ELISA, prior to use in neutralization
assays.
Single Memory B Cell Sorting and Ab Isolation
Single antigen- and epitope-specific memory B cells were sorted into wells of
96-well PCR plates, RT-PCR was performed with multiplex PCR methods
and primers, then products were sequenced and cloned into HC or LC con-
stant-region-encoding vectors (Sok et al., 2014b; Tiller et al., 2008; Wu et al.,
2010).
IgG Ab and Fab Fragment Production
Full-length or truncated Fab HC constructs and LC expression plasmids were
transfected into HEK293F cells with the FreeStyle 293 Expression System (Life
Technologies) to produce Abs and Fab fragments and were purified as
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Glycan Array Preparation and Ab Hybridization
40 glycans were printed by a robotic pin (SMP3; TeleChem International) and
0.6 nL of 100 mM concentration of amine-functionalized glycans in printing
buffer ([pH 8.5] 300 mM phosphate buffer, 0.05% Tween-20) from a 384-well
plate was deposited onto NHS-coated glass slides that were then blocked
and washed before being incubated with Abs (10 mg in 50 ml PBS) pre-com-
plexed with secondary Ab. The slides were washed and scanned on an Array-
Worx microarray reader. Images were analyzed with Genepix Pro 6.0 (Molec-
ular Devices Corporation).
Ab NGS and Computational Analysis
RNA was prepared either from 1 3 107 whole PBMCs or IgG+ memory B cells
separated from PBMCs (Switched memory B cell isolation kit; Miltenyi Bio-
tec). RNA was subjected to RT-PCR with barcoding primers that contain
unique Ab identifiers, and Illumina sequencing adapters and sample-specific
indexes were added during a second round of PCR; primer sequences can
be found in Table S1. Samples were quantified with fluorometry (Qubit; Life
Technologies) and pooled at approximately equimolar concentrations, and
the sample pool was requantified to be loaded onto an Illumina MiSeq.
Paired-end MiSeq reads were merged with PANDAseq (Masella et al.,
2012). GL assignment, junction identification, and other basic Ab information
was determined with AbStar, an antibody analysis package that uses
BLASTn and Smith-Waterman alignment to calculate the most likely GL
genes, identify the junctional region, and annotate SHM-induced substitu-
tions and indels (B.B., unpublished data). Sequences were assigned to clonal
lineages with Clonify, a software package specifically developed for Ab line-
age assignment (Briney et al., 2016). We constructed the phylogenetic trees
with FastTree by using maximum likelihood.
Crystal Diffraction Data Collection and Computational Analysis
Data were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)
12-2 beamline. The best dataset for the PCDN-27A crystal was collected at
2.7 A
˚ resolution, and the diffraction data were processed with HKL-2000
(Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) to an overall Rsym of 0.12% and complete-
ness of 93.9% (Table S2) in space group P21 with unit cell parameters
a = 41.8 A
˚ , b = 120.4 A
˚ , c = 111.1 A
˚ , and b = 96.4�. Data were collected
from a PCDN-27B crystal to 2.9 A
˚ resolution and processed with HKL-
2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) to an overall Rsym of 0.28% and
completeness of 99.5% in space group P6122 with unit cell parameters
a = b = 89.3 A
˚ , c = 211.1 A
˚ . The PCDN-27A Fab structure was solved by
molecular replacement with Phaser and a complementarity determining re-
gion (CDR)-loop-deleted X5 Fab structure (PDB: 1RRH) was used as the
initial model, whereas the PCDN-27B Fab structure was solved with the
family-related PCDN-27A Fab structure. Model building was carried out
as previously described (Garces et al., 2014). Final Rcryst and Rfree values
for PCDN-27A and PCDN-27B Fabs structure are 21.3% and 24.7%, and
23.3% and 29.7%, respectively.
Detailed additional experimental procedures can be found in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
