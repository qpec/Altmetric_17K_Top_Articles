Almost all animals, regardless of the anatomy of the eyes, require some level
of gaze stabilization in order to see the world clearly and without blur.
For the mantis shrimp, achieving gaze stabilization is unusually challenging
as their eyes have an unprecedented scope for movement in all three
rotational degrees of freedom: yaw, pitch and torsion. We demonstrate
that the species Odontodactylus scyllarus performs stereotypical gaze stabiliz-
ation in the yaw degree of rotational freedom, which is accompanied
by simultaneous changes in the pitch and torsion rotation of the eye. Surpris-
ingly, yaw gaze stabilization performance is unaffected by both the torsional
pose and the rate of torsional rotation of the eye. Further to this, we show, for
the first time, a lack of a torsional gaze stabilization response in the stoma-
topod visual system. In the light of these findings, we suggest that the neural
wide-field motion detection network in the stomatopod visual system may
follow a radially symmetric organization to compensate for the potentially
disorientating effects of torsional eye movements, a system likely to be
unique to stomatopods.
1. Introduction
Moving animals are confronted with a visual trade-off: their eyes are more effi-
cient at detecting salient features of a scene and local motion cues when they are
fixed relative to the outside world and yet, for many tasks, having movable eyes
provides an adaptive advantage. Overcoming this problem is a visual challenge
that has resulted in the evolution of systems that steady the retinal projection
of the external visual scene for periods of time. This is achieved with eye
movements that counter movements of the visual field.
If an animal’s eyes were to stay immobile as its head or body moves, the direc-
tion of visual gaze would become displaced and the retinal image would be
distorted and degraded due to motion blur. Motion blur occurs mainly due to
the relatively slow response time of photoreceptors (typically greater than
20 ms in vertebrates and approx. 12–24 ms in invertebrates [1–3]). It is more dif-
ficult to detect an object, either stationary or in motion, relative to its background
in a blurred image than in a spatio-temporally stabilized one [2,4]. Additionally,
motion blur disrupts an animal’s ability to infer information from optic flow or
motion parallax [2,4]. Furthermore, without adequate visual compensation for
rotational and translational movements of the body, an animal’s egocentric coor-
dinate system can become misaligned with real-world coordinates, so body
posture and equilibrium may become compromised [4]. To counteract these
degrading visual effects, animals make compensatory movements with their
eyes, head or body depending on their individual anatomy to reduce movement
of the retinal image [2]. This is known as gaze stabilization, and is common to both
vertebrates and arthropods.
The main mechanisms known to control gaze stabilization are the vestibular–
ocular reflex (VOR), the optokinetic response (OKR) and the optomotor response

 (OMR). The VOR involves slow counter rotation of the eyes
that compensates for head motion and is triggered by signals
from sense organs in the vestibular system such as the semicir-
cular canal organs (e.g. humans [5–7], monkeys [8,9] and
rabbits [10,11]), ampullae (e.g. fish [12,13]) or hair cells in
statocysts (e.g. crabs [14] and lobsters [15]). The OKR, on the
other hand, is mediated only by vision. It consists of a repetitive
series of eye movements with a slow and a fast phase, known as
the optokinetic nystagmus [1,2,16–19]. In the OKR, the eye
typically performs a slow rotation in the same direction
as the movement of the visual scene followed, at intervals, by
a rapid counter rotation, which ‘flicks’ the eye back to the
approximate starting position [1,16,18]. The slow phase of
optokinetic nystagmus largely ‘fixes’ an image on the retina
and is seen in animals both with and without a fovea or
acute zone. The OMR is similar to the OKR, but involves
movement of the entire body not just the eyes [16].
Gaze stabilization is thought to be important for an animal
to be able to perceive motion accurately. There is an abundance
of motion-sensitive interneurons in the arthropod central ner-
vous system [20–23]. Most of these are directionally specific
to some degree and while some wide-field neurons are directly
involved in the gaze stabilization response, other neurons with
a smaller receptive field require stabilization for optimal per-
formance [24–26]. An example of such neurons can be found
in the lobula of male fleshflies (Sarcophaga bullata). These retino-
topic directionally sensitive neurons have a small receptive
field and are linked to flight motor neurons, indicating that
they may play a role in the tracking of females during sustained
aerial pursuit [24]. Some directionally insensitive neurons
associated with optic flow have been identified in the lobular
plate of crustaceans and insects, responding to both vertical
and horizontal motion [20,27,28].
While most animals endeavour to restrict the movement of
their eyes for all the reasons stated previously, stomatopod
crustaceans (mantis shrimp) have unusually mobile eyes.
Their compound eyes are of the apposition type, and while
their eye anatomy shares many similarities with that of many
other crustaceans, they show a uniquely regionalized structure.
Each eye has three sections: the dorsal and ventral hemi-
spheres, and a midband typically consisting of two or six
ommatidial rows (depending on the species) bisecting the eye
and anatomically separating the hemispheres [29–35]. Various
adaptations to the basic crustacean photoreceptor anatomy,
particular to each section of the eye, have enabled stomatopods
to evolve regional specializations for 12-channel colour vision,
as well as for both linear and circular polarization vision
[30,31,36–40]. Stomatopod eyes also exhibit an unusually
large angular range of movement in which their eyestalks
move in all three degrees of rotational freedom (figure 1a),
exceeding 908 in pitch (up-down movements), yaw (side-to-
side) and torsion (rotation about the visual axis) [41,42].
Additionally, the eyes show a high degree of independence,
though this depends on the visual task [43].
Despite their unique eye design, stomatopods perform
stereotypical eye movements including optokinesis [18,44],
tracking [45] and object-of-interest acquisition through saccades
[46]. More unusual are the scanning motions of the eyes
directed approximately perpendicular to the midband [44].
Because the midband consists of up to six ommatidial rows
and the direction of view of ommatidia in the hemispheres is
skewed, the field of view of the stomatopod eye is much
reduced compared with that of many crustaceans with
superficially similar apposition compound eyes. For example,
the midband ommatidia typically only view a narrow 108
strip of space [31,47–49]. Consequently, scans made perpen-
dicular to the midband will obtain sequential spectral and
polarization information across a greater portion of the visual
scene, rather than just a narrow strip; much like push-broom
sensors used for remote sensing [50]. Despite this need for scan-
ning, stomatopods show stereotypical gaze-stabilizing eye
movements, performing yaw or pitch optokinesis in response
to a horizontally or vertically displaced field of view, res-
pectively, to stabilize the retinal image [18,43,44]. By contrast,
the role of torsional eye rotation for gaze stabilization in
stomatopods is much less clear [42,43].
Torsional rotation, in which the eye rotates about the long
axis of the eyestalk, is an unusual movement in an animal
with frontally placed eyes. Stomatopods have previously been
shown to use torsional rotations to enhance their polarization
vision [42]. However, the greater than 908 range of torsional
rotation far exceeds the range needed for dynamic polariza-
tion vision (22.58), suggesting that these eye rotations have
additional functions. In this work, we investigate the role of
torsional eye movements during gaze stabilization in the stoma-
topod Odontodactylus scyllarus and ask three questions: do the
eyes rotate torsionally during optokinetic responses to a hori-
zontally displaced field of view? Do torsional rotations affect
the yaw gaze stabilization performance? Is there evidence for
gaze stabilization in the torsional degree of freedom?
2. Material and methods
Full details of materials and methods are presented in the elec-
tronic supplementary material, S1. Yaw optokinesis was elicited
by the horizontal motion of a black and white grating on
the inner face of a rotating drum (figure 1b–d), following the
method of Daly et al. [43]. A torsionally rotating field of view
was created by turning the drum on its side such that its axis of
rotation was horizontal (figure 1e–g). The closed end of the
drum, which the animals were facing, was covered by a radial pat-
tern of stripes so as to extend the torsionally rotating field of view
frontally (figure 1g). The three-dimensional rotation of the eyes
was recorded using two video camcorders (Panasonic HC-X900,
Osaka, Japan) calibrated to form a stereoscopic pair and tracked
in each frame (50 fps) using MATLAB (2015b, Mathworks, Massa-
chusetts, USA) using the method previously described by Daly
et al. [42]. The performance of an eye when stabilizing its gaze
was quantified using the relative velocity ratio (SY and ST in the
yaw and torsion degrees of rotation, respectively, previously
termed ‘gain’ [18]), which is the ratio between the angular velocity
of the drum and the angular velocity of the eye in a particular plane
of rotation. The angular velocity of the eyes is derived from the
differential of the pose in each video frame, rather than manually
selecting regions of the responses in order to ensure equal numbers
of measurements from each eye and each individual was included
in the analyses.
(a) Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted in R v.3.0.25 [51]. The mean
and standard deviation are quoted for normal distributions, and
the median and 95% confidence interval (CI) for non-normal
distributions of independent data. Gaze stabilization performance
was analysed using a generalized linear mixed-effects model
(GLMM) (R package lme4, [52]). Correlation between the three
degrees of rotational freedom and between torsional rotation
and yaw gaze stabilization performance was investigated using

 cross-correlation on the differential of the data series with respect
to time in order to satisfy the stationarity assumption (i.e. that
there is no overall trend in the data, such that the mean and var-
iance do not change over time) [53] and to avoid the potential
influence of high-frequency noise on the correlation calculation.
Both the maximum cross-correlation coefficient between combi-
nations of eye movements and the associated time lags were
determined separately for the left and right eyes of each individual
and were statistically analysed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test
to ascertain whether there was evidence of significant correlations.
An additional Wilcoxon analysis was performed to determine
whether the torsional pose of the eye, horizontal or vertical, had
a significant effect on the median yaw gaze stabilization perform-
ance. Statistical analysis of the effect of the drum velocity on the
torsional velocity of the eye also used a GLMM.
3. Results
(a) Yaw optokinesis
Seventeen individual O. scyllarus performed stereotypical
yaw optokinesis with slow tracking and fast reset profiles
(figure 2a–c, red line) with variable kinetics (electronic sup-
plementary material, S2), which would serve to partially
stabilize their gaze to a horizontal displacement of their field
of view during the tracking phase. There was no significant
difference in the yaw gaze stabilization performance (SY in
the direction of drum rotation throughout the duration of the
trial) between the left and right eyes (left: SY ¼ 0.74+0.01
(median+95% CI), right: SY ¼ 0.74+0.01 (median+95%
CI), GLMM, n ¼ 17, X2 ¼ 0.19, p ¼ 0.665). Nor did the direction
of rotation have a significant effect on yaw gaze stabilization
performance (clockwise: SY ¼ 0.74+0.01 (median+95% CI),
anticlockwise: SY ¼ 0.73+0.01 (median+95% CI), GLMM,
n ¼ 17, X2 ¼ 2.61, p ¼ 0.106; figure 2d). Across the whole
distribution of SY, taking the velocity of counter rotations and
tracking rotations into account, the median of the relative vel-
ocity ratios is significantly greater than 0 (SY ¼ 0.60+0.01
(median+95% CI), Wilcoxon sign-ranked test, n ¼ 17, V ¼
153, p , 0.001), indicating that the eye movements made by
the stomatopods are mostly for gaze stabilization.
Despite the drum movement creating a field of view
moving only in the horizontal plane, stereotypical OKR yaw
rotations were accompanied by both torsion and pitch. The
median torsional pose relative to the horizontal was 67.34+
0.128 (median+95% CI, n ¼ 17) and the median pitch pose
relative to the horizontal was 16.64+0.088 (median+95%
CI, n ¼ 17). The profile of pitch and torsion rotations during
yaw optokinesis are highly variable, sometimes showing
apparently correlated rotation (figure 2a), while other times
showing highly uncorrelated rotation (figure 2b,c). However,
overall the median maximum cross-correlation coefficient
was not significantly different from 0 for yaw and torsion
rotation, yaw and pitch rotations or pitch and torsion rotation
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n ¼ 17, V ¼ 117, p . 0.05, full stat-
istics in electronic supplementary material, S3; figure 2e). These
findings demonstrate that stomatopods are able to indepen-
dently rotate their eyes in the three degrees of rotational
freedom, but that these rotations can become coupled in
some instances, such as the yaw and torsion rotation during
optokinesis shown in figure 2a,b. The reason for this occasional
coupling is, as yet, unclear.
Yaw gaze stabilization performance (SY) was unaffected by
the torsional pose (uT) of the eye. There was no strong overall
correlation between SY and uT: the correlation coefficients
between these variables for the left eye are not significantly
different from 0 (left: 20.02+0.08 (median+95% CI),
Wilcoxon
signed-rank
test,
n ¼ 17,
V ¼ 59,
p ¼ 0.407;
figure 2f ) and, while the right eye correlation was significantly
different from 0, the correlation coefficient indicates an extre-
mely weak correlation (right: 0.03+0.28 s (median+95% CI),
Wilcoxon
signed-rank
test,
n ¼ 17,
V ¼ 122,
p ¼ 0.031;
figure 2g). Further to this, the torsional pose of the eye,
when divided into the categories ‘horizontal’ (08 � uT � 258)
or ‘vertical’ (658 � uT � 908), had no significant effect on the
median value of SY when the eye was oriented in either angu-
lar category (left horizontal: 0.65 +0.05 (median +95% CI);
left
vertical:
0.75 +0.02
(median +95%
CI),
Wilcoxon
signed-rank test, n ¼ 17, V ¼ 70, p ¼ 0.600; right horizontal:
0.72+ 0.06 (median +95% CI); right vertical: 0.87 +0.02
(median +95% CI), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n ¼ 17, V ¼
73, p ¼ 0.890; figure 2g). Similarly, there is no correlation
between yaw gaze stabilization performance and the velocity
of torsional rotations, with the maximum cross-correlation
coefficients being not significantly different from 0 (left eye:
0.04+ 0.13 (median +95% CI), Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
n ¼ 17, V ¼ 113, p ¼ 0.084; right eye: 0.04+ 0.21 (median+
95% CI), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n ¼ 17, V ¼ 56, p ¼
0.332; figure 2g).
(b) Torsional optokinesis
The torsional rotation of the drum elicited torsional rotation of
the eyes, as well as yaw and pitch rotations (figure 3a). How-
ever, there was no evidence for torsional gaze stabilization as
the angular torsional velocity of the eye poorly matched the
angular torsional velocity of the drum at all three speed set-
tings (slow, medium and fast, indicated by the dotted lines,
figure 3a–c). Nor did the torsional rotation of the eye fit the
bi-phasic slow/fast profile typical of optokinetic nystagmus
OKR, as was observed for yaw optokinesis (figure 2a–c).
Nevertheless, the torsional angular velocity of the drum
rotation did have a significant effect on the torsional angular
velocity of the eye when it was rotating in the same direction
as the drum (GLMM, n ¼ 6, X2 ¼ 41.31, p , 0.001; figure 3d),
the eyes rotating faster in torsion at higher drum speeds. It is
not clear what is causing this effect and, at this stage, we
cannot eliminate the possibility that the response is to a non-
visual stimulus, such as noise or vibrations from the drive
motor, that increased at the higher speeds.
Unlike the relative velocity ratios in the yaw degree of
rotational freedom, which showed a skewed distribution
(figure 2d), the distributions of the average torsional rela-
tive velocity ratios at each of the three speed settings follow
approximately normal distributions (figure 3e–g). As stated
previously, only torsional data in which the eye was facing for-
wards (uY , 308) are included in the statistical analysis. Despite
the significant effect of drum angular velocity on eye angular
velocity, the average torsional relative velocity ratio (ST) in the
direction of the drum for each speed setting was greater
than 1 (slow: ST ¼ 3.09+4.26, medium: ST ¼ 2.04+1.98, fast:
ST ¼ 1.23+1.07 (mean+s.d., n ¼ 6), figure 3h), indicating
that the eyes generally rotated faster than the drum. Neither
the eye, left or right (GLMM, n ¼ 6, X2 ¼ 2.68, p ¼ 0.102), nor
the direction of drum rotation, clockwise or anticlockwise
(GLMM, n ¼ 6, X2 ¼ 0.43, p ¼ 0.513), had a significant effect
on the torsional relative velocity ratio. Across the whole

While eye velocity approachesthe drum velocity (ST � 1), gaze-stabilizing eye movements are expected to be slightly slower (ST) than the drum movements due to the finite
response time of the neural feedback loop.

the torsional relative velocity ratios are not significantly differ-
ent from 0 (slow: S0

In other words, the eyes spend approximately as much time
torsionally rotating counter to the drum direction (dark
green region in figure 3e–g) as they do rotating in the same
direction (light green region in figure 3e–g). This is in contrast
to the eye movements in response to the yaw rotation of the
drum, in which the eyes spend more time rotating in the
same direction as the drum in order to stabilize their gaze as
much as possible.
4. Discussion
When presented with a horizontally displaced field of view
comprising black and white vertical stripes on a surrounding
drum, O. scyllarus performed stereotypical yaw optokinesis
in order to stabilize their gaze. The left and right eyes per-
formed gaze stabilization equally and with no significant
preference for clockwise or anticlockwise movement of the
striped drum. This rotation in the yaw degree of freedom
was accompanied by both pitch and torsion rotation of the
eyes, despite the motion of the drum being purely in the hori-
zontal (yaw) plane. Moreover, the yaw gaze stabilization
performance was not significantly correlated with the eye’s tor-
sional or pitch pose, nor the rate of torsional rotation. A similar
result was found in another stomatopod species, Pseudosquilla
ciliata [18], suggesting that the consistency in yaw gaze stabiliz-
ation performance as the eye rotates torsionally is likely to be a
fundamental facet of stomatopod vision.
The ability of stomatopods to show optokinetic stabiliz-
ation in yaw, while their eyes simultaneously rotate in pitch
or torsion, indicates that the neuronal network for detecting
wide-field motion in the stomatopod eye must be more com-
plex than a simple system of a Reichardt-like motion detector
and a comparison between horizontal or vertical pairs of
photoreceptors [54–56]. As previously mentioned, the gaze
stabilization
response
of
many
insects
originates
with
directionally selective wide-field neurons that have a specific
orientation in the eye relative to real-world coordinates
(e.g. [24,25]). Gaze-stabilizing mechanisms in stomatopods,
with their torsionally rotating eyes, would likely require a
different architecture that is optimized to a shifting coordinate
system. For stomatopods, the apparent direction of motion of a
stimulus will depend on the eye’s torsional pose. For instance,
the direction of a horizontally moving stimulus progressing at
a constant angular velocity will appear to change sinusoidally
as the eye rotates torsionally (figure 4). Nevertheless, as we
have shown, the yaw gaze stabilization performance of a sto-
matopod eye appears to be independent of both its torsional
pose and its rate of torsional rotation. Such a finding suggests
that the stomatopod’s wide-field motion detection network
may be radially symmetrical, which would be novel in any
visual system.
Further to this, O. scyllarus did not show any evidence of
torsional gaze stabilization in response to a torsionally rotating
field of view. This is in contrast to many flying insects, such as
honeybees [57], wasps [58] and blowflies [59], which exhibit
compensatory torsional rotation of the head in order to stabil-
ize their gaze relative to torsional rotation of the visual scene. In
insects with halteres, such as dipteran flies, compensatory tor-
sional rotation of the head can be induced either by the visual
or haltere systems, while in the hymenopteran insects lacking
the mechanosensory information from halteres, torsional
head rotations have been shown to be governed purely by
the visual system [57–59]. Three-dimensional gaze stabiliz-
ation is particularly important during flight control as it
reduces motion blur and prevents image rotation from degrad-
ing optic flow information; translational optic flow being an
important visual cue during flight, assisting in flight control,
determining self-motion, navigation and landing [57,60,61].
Like many other crustaceans, O. scyllarus are benthic,
spending the vast majority of their time in contact with the
ocean floor or with the walls of their home burrows. Conse-
quently, torsional stability may not be as critical as it would
be to a flying insect, at least while the stomatopod is stationary.
Several species of benthic crabs have been shown to perform
torsional rotation of their eyes in response to vestibular or
visual stimuli [62–64]. It is likely that these compensatory

Figure 4. (a) The motion of a stimulus moving in the horizontal direction (red arrow) in the real-world coordinate system (indicated by the axes) across a sto-
matopod’s eye depends on its torsional pose. (b) In its reference frame, rather than an eye torsionally rotating, it remains motionless with the midband fixed in the
horizontal position, while the world rotates torsionally about the eye, as shown by the orientation of the real-world coordinate axes. In the eye’s reference frame, the
apparent direction of motion of the stimulus moving horizontally in the real world depends on its torsional pose. Despite the ubiquitous torsional rotations observed
during yaw tracking causing a dynamic apparent direction of motion, stomatopods are able to accurately track the actual motion of a horizontally displaced field of
view, showing normal optokinetic nystagmus in the yaw rotation, despite simultaneous (but uncorrelated) pitch and torsion rotations. (Online version in colour.)

 eye movements, which have a limited rotational range (less
than 158), act to keep the gaze of the crab stable and level rela-
tive to a local horizon during locomotion over a rough terrain
[62,63]. However, two substantial differences in the visual sys-
tems of stomatopods and crabs limit the comparison between
the two animals; stomatopods fixate objects and perform
visual scans, while crabs do neither [42,44,46,65].
Although we found no evidence for torsional gaze stabiliz-
ation in stationary O. scyllarus when viewing a torsionally
rotating visual scene, it is possible that their repertoire of eye
movements may change when they undergo locomotion,
either walking or swimming, due to different neural control
requirements. Locomotion will induce optic flow in the stoma-
topod’s visual system and, although little is known about their
way, they may process and use such information, it is likely
to be as useful to stomatopods as to other invertebrates. In
addition, while stationary, torsional eye rotations are likely to
play a functional role in enhancing certain facets of stomatopod
vision: for instance, both O. scyllarus and G. smithii employ tor-
sional rotations in order to dynamically enhance their linear
polarization vision [42]. It has also been hypothesized that tor-
sional rotations may be instrumental in optimally positioning
the eyes during scans that are undertaken during the visual
inspection of objects [47].
5. Conclusion
Although stomatopods display the stereotypical features of
optokinetic nystagmus in ocular yaw rotations in response to
the horizontal displacement of their visual field, the neural
basis of this gaze stabilization system is potentially more com-
plex than that of other crustaceans due to their ability to
perform torsional rotations through at least 908 while simul-
taneously yaw-tracking. Although it is far easier to detect
motion in a scene when an eye is stable, the stomatopod’s
visual system appears to be able to detect and follow transla-
tional motion even during torsional rotation. Our findings
could be explained by the presence of an unusual radial
array of motion detectors in stomatopod visual systems. Such
an array has never been described, and it would have to be
able to compensate for wide-field translational motion and
be unaffected by torsional self-motion of the eyes, at least
when the animal is stationary. Such a radial array would
allow the stomatopods to detect, and therefore track, the
motion of a stimulus in any direction equally across the eye
rather than along set directions. A full understanding of this
system has biomimetic potential, as a system of motion detec-
tion that is insensitive to the negative effects of torsional
rotation would have many applications in the realm of machine
vision, especially on mobile platforms.
