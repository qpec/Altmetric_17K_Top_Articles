Abstract
Objective—Many reasons inform women’s reproductive decision-making. This paper aims to 
present the reasons women give for obtaining induced abortions in 14 countries.
Study design—We examined nationally representative data from 14 countries collected in 
official statistics, population-based surveys, and facility-based surveys of abortion patients. In each 
country, we calculated the percentage distribution of women who have abortions by main reason 
given for the abortion. We examined these reasons across countries and within countries by 
women’s sociodemographic characteristics (age, marital status, educational attainment, and 
residence). Where data are available, we also studied the multiple reasons women give for having 
an abortion.
Results—In most countries, the most frequently cited reasons for having an abortion were 
socioeconomic concerns or limiting childbearing. With some exceptions, little variation existed in 
the reasons given by women’s sociodemographic characteristics. Data from three countries where 
multiple reasons could be reported in the survey showed that women often have more than one 
reason for having an abortion.
Conclusion—This study shows that women have abortions for a variety of reasons, and provides 
a broad picture of the circumstances that inform women’s decisions to have abortions.
Implications—Future research should examine in greater depth the personal, social, economic, 
and health factors that inform a woman’s decision to have an abortion as these reasons may shed 
light on the potential consequences that unintended births can have on women’s lives.

1. Introduction
A growing body of research has examined the reasons women seek an abortion. Many of 
these studies are based on convenience samples of women from specific subgroups (i.e. 
ever-married or students) or women seeking abortions or postabortion care at certain health 
facilities [1–8]. Thus, findings may not represent all women seeking abortions and may

 instead reflect women who have access to or require facility-based care. Other studies have 
examined why women obtain abortions during a particular trimester of pregnancy [9,10]. 
Women who have abortions after the first trimester, however, may be motivated by different 
reasons from those seeking first-trimester abortions.
The most recent review of women’s reasons for obtaining abortions focused on developed 
countries [8]. Although a prior review included developed and developing countries, that 
study was conducted almost 20 years ago, and the reasons why women have abortions may 
have changed [7,8]. This paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by using more recent 
data to categorize women’s reasons for having abortions. Knowledge of these reasons will 
provide a broad picture of the circumstances surrounding women’s abortion decision-
making and demonstrate some of the potential consequences unintended births can have on 
women’s lives.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Data sources
We identified data from 14 countries across three types of data sources (Table A.1): official 
statistics,1 population-based surveys of reproductive-age women (15–49 years) and facility-
based data collected from abortion patients. These countries represent diverse contexts that 
could inform reasons reported for having an abortion. For each country, we present 
information on geographic region, income classification, abortion law restrictiveness, total 
fertility rate, and modern contraceptive prevalence (Table 1).
For 11 countries, we had population-based data collected by the Demographic and Health 
Surveys (DHS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), standardized surveys designed to 
collect comparable data across countries. Both are interviewer-administered and conducted 
in-person. Women who reported an abortion in the 5-year period before the survey were 
included in analyses; if more than one abortion was reported, only information about the 
most recent abortion was included. The primary reason for having an abortion was captured 
using the following close-ended question: “What was the main reason you decided to have 
this abortion?”2 In Turkey, open-ended responses were collected.
One source of US data was from women obtaining abortions at 11 large providers in 2004 
using a self-administered survey [12]. The first question, used to determine the main reason 
for having an abortion, stated: “Please describe briefly why you are choosing to have an 
abortion now. If you have more than one reason, please list them all, starting with the most 
important one first.” Subsequent close-ended questions, related to specific reasons, were 
used to code women’s multiple reasons for having an abortion.3
1Belgium is the only country for which we had data from official statistics [11].
2There was slight variation in the survey question and response codes used across countries.
3One of these questions, for example, asked: “Is one reason you are having an abortion because…you can’t afford a baby now; having 
a baby would dramatically change your life in ways you are not ready for; you don’t want to be a single mother or because of 
problems with your relationship with your husband or partner; of some physical problem or problem with your health; of possible 
problems affecting the health of the fetus; or other reasons?”

 We extracted data from two peer-reviewed articles that included data about reasons from 
self-administered surveys conducted in abortion facilities in Sweden and the US [13,14]. 
The Swedish data were collected from abortion-seeking patients in 13 urban and rural clinics 
across the middle one-third of the country. Multiple responses were allowed, but the main 
reason for having an abortion was not collected. The US data were collected between 2008 
and 2010 from abortion patients at 30 facilities in 21 states across all regions. These data are 
included alongside the 2004 US data to provide a more recent snapshot of women’s multiple 
reasons for seeking an abortion. The US and Swedish data sources are not nationally 
representative.
2.2. Categories of reasons
Each data source categorized reasons for having an abortion. Although the same categories 
did not exist across all countries, reasons were similarly enough worded to construct 
overarching categories. In some cases, we collapsed two or more similar categories into a 
single category. For analyses of the main reason given, we created seven categories: wants to 
postpone/space childbearing4, wants no (more) children, socioeconomic concerns, partner-
related, too young or parents/others object, risk to maternal health and risk to fetal health. 
All other reasons were included in the ‘other’ category. The specific reasons comprising 
each category are listed by country in Table A.2.
We were unable to create overarching categories of reasons from the peer-reviewed articles. 
Combining categories would overestimate the percentage of women reporting a singular 
reason because some women reported more than one reason.
2.3. Measures
For 13 countries, we calculated the percentage distribution of main reasons given for 
obtaining an abortion.5 For countries with subgroups of women that had data about reasons 
for at least 100 women, we presented these data according to women’s age at abortion,6 
marital status, educational attainment, and residence. Lastly, we extracted or calculated the 
percentage of women citing each reason in the US and Sweden.
2.4. Analyses
We conducted original data analyses using Stata version 14 and applied survey-specific 
sample weights where appropriate. For countries without publically available data, we 
extracted the relevant information from published articles and reports [13–17].
4We combined postponing and spacing childbearing into a single category because most countries listed only one of the two reasons 
as possible response options. See Table A.2 for more details.
5Analyses revealed that very few unmarried women reported an abortion in the Asian countries in our study. Thus, the reasons given 
for having an abortion predominantly reflect those of married women.
6Georgia lacks data on age at abortion; thus, we used age at the time of the survey.

 3. Results
3.1. Main reasons for abortion
In six of the 13 countries for which we had data on the main reason, the most commonly 
reported reason for having an abortion was socioeconomic concerns, cited by a plurality of 
women (ranging from 27% to 40%) (Table 3). In five countries, limiting childbearing was 
the most frequently reported reason, ranging from 20% in Nepal to 64% in Azerbaijan. In 
Belgium, the most frequently cited reasons were partner-related (23%) and socioeconomic 
concerns (23%), and in Kyrgyz Republic, risk to maternal health was commonly reported 
(44%).
3.2. Main reasons for abortion by women’s sociodemographic characteristics
We examined the three most frequently cited main reasons cited for having an abortion 
according to women’s sociodemographic characteristics (Figs. 1–4). In all countries, except 
Nepal, we observed minimal variation by age at abortion (Fig. 1). While similar proportions 
of Nepalese women cited socioeconomic concerns, younger women frequently reported 
wanting to postpone/space children and partner-related concerns, and older women 
commonly reported limiting childbearing and other reasons.
In three of the four countries with data on reasons for abortion by marital status, some 
variation exists in the most frequently cited main reasons (Fig. 2). Across all three African 
countries, married women were more likely to cite postponing/spacing children while 
unmarried women were more likely to report being too young or family objections (Fig. 2).
The distribution of the most frequently cited main reasons by educational attainment is 
similar within countries, except in Nepal and Ghana (Fig. 3). In Nepal, less educated women 
cited partner-related concerns and more educated women reported postponing/spacing 
childbearing. In Ghana, less educated women cited partner concerns as a key reason whereas 
more educated women reported being too young or family objections.
Overall, the most frequently cited main reasons for having an abortion did not vary by 
residence except in Armenia, Nepal and Kyrgyz Republic (Fig. 4). In Armenia, risk to 
maternal health and postponing/spacing childbearing were commonly reported in urban and 
rural areas, respectively, and in Nepal, socioeconomic concerns and other reasons were more 
frequently cited in urban and rural areas, respectively. Urban women in Kyrgyz Republic 
more commonly reported partner-related concerns while rural women reported limiting 
childbearing.
3.3. Multiple reasons for abortion
We examined multiple reasons reported by women seeking abortions in Sweden and the US 
(Table 3). In the Swedish study, women reported seeking abortions because of a desire to 
postpone childbearing (60%), partner-related concerns (32%), and not being financially 
prepared (32%).
In the 2004 US data, 89% of women reported more than one reason for having an abortion; 
slightly more than half reported at least four reasons. The most frequently cited reasons were

 lack of financial preparedness (56%), partner-related (55%), and interference with future 
opportunities (54%). These results were comparable with the findings on women’s main 
reason for having an abortion using data in the same survey (Table 2), in that lack of 
financial preparedness was also frequently cited as a main reason. While partner-related 
concerns and interference with future opportunities were frequently reported when multiple 
reasons were allowed, they were less likely to be cited as the primary reason. The recent US 
data from 2008–2010, presented in Table 3, show that the top three motivations for seeking 
an abortion were not being financially prepared (40%), not the right time for a baby (36%), 
and partner-related concerns (31%).
4. Discussion
This study highlights the many personal, social, economic and health factors that inform a 
woman’s decision to have an abortion. Socioeconomic concerns or limiting childbearing 
were the most frequently cited reasons in most of the countries in our study. Few 
generalizations can be made about these reasons by women’s sociodemographic 
characteristics, partly because only a handful of countries had sufficient data to examine 
patterns. Our study echoes prior findings that information on only the main reason may not 
fully demonstrate the circumstances that surround women’s abortion decision-making [12–
14].
In many of the countries where socioeconomic concerns or limiting childbearing were most 
frequently cited, a substantial proportion of abortions occurred among young, unmarried 
women [18,19]. These women may obtain abortions because they lack the financial means to 
raise a child or feel that having a child would interfere with future opportunities. In the 
remaining countries, socioeconomic concerns was still ranked highly as a reason for 
abortion, emphasizing the widespread influence of financial circumstances in women’s 
reproductive decision-making. In the five countries where limiting childbearing was most 
frequently cited, prior findings suggest that women begin childbearing early and reach their 
desired family size at relatively young ages [17,20,21]. As a result, women may spend more 
years trying to avoid pregnancy while still fecund, and be at higher risk for unintended 
pregnancies.
Only three of the included data sources collected information on multiple reasons. Findings 
from the US, where data existed on both primary and multiple reasons, suggest that many 
factors influence a woman’s decision to have an abortion and collecting data on only one 
reason may overlook the web of circumstances that contribute to the decision-making 
process. For example, when asked for their main reason, women may choose to focus on 
either the distal (financial concerns) or proximal (delay childbearing) drivers for obtaining 
their abortion. Focusing solely on women’s primary reason could result in misleading or 
simplistic conclusions about their abortion decision-making. Future surveys should ask 
women to report all or a certain number of reasons (in rank order) or incorporate qualitative 
approaches to help illuminate women’s underlying reasons for having an abortion.
This study contains several limitations. In 11 of the 14 countries, the timeframe for abortions 
was 5 years prior to the survey, while marital status, educational attainment, and residence

 were measured at the time of the survey. Thus, women’s characteristics at the time of their 
abortion may differ from those at the time of the survey; this likely affects younger women 
disproportionately. Moreover, recall bias may affect women’s responses, especially for those 
who obtained an abortion further in the past. Future research should consider using panel 
data to overcome this limitation.
Differential underreporting of abortions in population- based surveys, especially where 
abortion is highly restricted [22], may bias findings of women’s reasons for obtaining 
abortions. Women who report their abortion might have different reasons for seeking one, 
compared to those who do not report them. The fact that very few unmarried women 
reported abortions in Asia suggests that differential underreporting was present in this 
region.
Our study analyzes data from an array of survey instruments with varying data collection 
procedures and interviewers, which may have affected the quality of responses. Furthermore, 
population-level data were collected using face-to-face interviews, which could have 
prompted socially desirable responses to abortion-related questions. Circumstances 
surrounding the interview, such as how the questions were asked, respondent’s comfort level 
with the interviewer, and location of the interview, as well as the woman’s stage of life (e.g., 
marital status) could affect responses to these questions. Additionally, the social 
acceptability of particular reasons may vary across countries, influencing which reasons 
women are more and less likely to report.
Lastly, our study is a descriptive comparison of the reasons why women have abortions. The 
categories of reasons are necessarily simplified at two levels — country questionnaire and 
analysis. Rather than fully reflect the reasons why women have abortions, our findings may 
reflect the structured response categories listed in the questionnaires and our classification of 
these categories.
Despite these limitations, the evidence suggests that women have abortions for a variety of 
reasons, and these appear to vary across countries and, sometimes, within countries by 
women’s sociodemographic characteristics. Cross-country differences may be indicative of 
varied cultural contexts; access to quality and affordable health care; desired number, timing 
and spacing of births and levels of social stigma and support for childbearing. These findings 
provide a broad picture of the circumstances that may influence women’s decisions to have 
an abortion and the potential consequences of unwanted childbearing.

aCategories based on the World Bank’s classification of income groups (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups): low-income countries 
have a gross national income (GNI) per capita less than $1025; lower-middle income countries have GNI per capita between $1026 and $4035; upper-middle income countries have GNI per capita between 
$4036 and $12,475; and high-income countries are those with a GNI per capita of $12,476 or more. Classifications based on GNI per capita from the year of data collection.
bClassifications reflect country abortion laws at the time of data collection. These categories are, from most to least restrictive: to save the woman’s life or prohibited altogether; to preserve health; 
socioeconomic grounds; and without restriction as to reason. Data are from the Center for Reproductive Rights, “The World’s Abortion Laws”: http://worldabortionlaws.com/map/.
cTFR at the time of data collection. Estimates are from the World Bank: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN.
