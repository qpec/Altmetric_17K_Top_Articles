Background: Acute polyradiculoneuritis (APN) is an immune-mediated peripheral nerve disorder in dogs that shares
many similarities with Guillain-Barr�
e syndrome (GBS) in humans, in which the bacterial pathogen Campylobacter spp. now is
considered to be a major triggering agent. Little information is available concerning the relationship between APN and
Campylobacter spp. in dogs.
Hypothesis/Objectives: To estimate the association between Campylobacter spp. infection and APN. Associations with
additional potential risk factors also were investigated, particularly consumption of raw chicken.
Animals: Twenty-seven client-owned dogs suffering from suspected APN and 47 healthy dogs, client-owned or owned by
staff members.
Methods: Case-control study with incidence density-based sampling. Fecal samples were collected from each enrolled ani-
mal to perform direct culture, DNA extraction, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Campylobacter spp. In
some cases, species identification was performed by sequence analysis of the amplicon. Data were obtained from the medical
records and owner questionnaires in both groups.
Results: In cases in which the fecal sample was collected within 7 days from onset of clinical signs, APN cases were 9.4
times more likely to be positive for Campylobacter spp compared to control dogs (P < 0.001). In addition, a significant asso-
ciation was detected between dogs affected by APN and the consumption of raw chicken (96% of APN cases; 26% of control
dogs). The most common Campylobacter spp. identified was Campylobacter upsaliensis.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Raw chicken consumption is a risk factor in dogs for the development of APN,
which potentially is mediated by infection with Campylobacter spp.
Key words: Acute polyradiculoneuritis; Campylobacter; Dogs; Raw chicken.
A
cute or idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis (APN) is
the most frequently identified acute generalized
peripheral neuropathy in dogs worldwide and is charac-
terized by acute onset of lower motor neuron (LMN)
signs.1 The initial clinical signs typically develop in the
pelvic limbs with a rapid ascending progression to
involve the thoracic limbs, causing a flaccid LMN tetra-
paresis or tetraplegia. It is an immune-mediated disor-
der
affecting
the
ventral
spinal
nerve
roots
more
severely, with minimal dorsal nerve root involvement.1–6
Cranial nerve involvement occurs in 80% of affected
patients. The most commonly affected cranial nerve is
the vagal nerve, causing dysphonia.7
Acute polyradiculoneuritis in dogs has been proposed
as a canine model of Guillain-Barr�
e syndrome (GBS) in
humans.1–7 This consideration initially was based on
clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological similari-
ties. The histopathological changes described in dogs
with APN are similar to those of patients suffering from
the demyelinating form of GBS (acute inflammatory
demyelinating
polyradiculoneuropathy
or
AIDP).
Recently, the presence of anti-GM2 ganglioside anti-
bodies (Abs) in dogs affected by APN has been demon-
strated, reinforcing the hypothesis that APN is the
canine counterpart of GBS.7
Acute polyradiculoneuritis was first described in North
America in dogs used to hunt racoons and may have
occurred as a result of contact with racoon saliva, hence
the original term “coonhound paralysis”.8 Since then, this
disease has been identified in many other countries with

 no natural racoon population.3 Other suspected risk fac-
tors include recent vaccination and upper respiratory and
gastrointestinal infections.1–4 In GBS, infection by the
bacterial pathogen Campylobacter now is considered a
major triggering agent, with up to 40% of GBS patients
reported as having Campylobacter jejuni infection 1–
2 weeks before the onset of GBS.9,10 Other infectious
agents have been found to be associated with GBS includ-
ing Haemophilus influenza,11 Mycoplasma pneumoniae,12
cytomegalovirus,13,14
Epstein-Barr
virus,14
Borrelia
burgdorferi,15 and, most recently, Zika virus.16 Cases of
GBS after rabies and swine influenza vaccines also have
been reported.17–19 To our knowledge, no dog in Australia
has been reported to be infected by any of these agents.
Most Campylobacter cases in humans are considered
to be associated with consumption of raw or under-
cooked poultry. Consumption of contaminated water
and
unpasteurized
milk
also
play
important
roles.
Chickens are a natural reservoir of Campylobacter,
where the bacteria colonize the mucosal layer of the
gastrointestinal tract and can be transferred between
chickens by the fecal-oral route.10,20 We have observed
that it is common practice for Australian dog owners to
feed their dogs raw chicken as part of their daily diet or
simply as a treat. Thus, we are under the impression
that the prevalence of raw chicken consumption is very
high in the population of APN dogs that they have
diagnosed or treated and that the incidence of APN is
possibly higher in Australia than in other countries.
We undertook a case-control study primarily to
investigate the association between Campylobacter infec-
tion in dogs and APN to determine whether Campy-
lobacter could be a trigger for APN. Another aim of
our study was to identify potential risk factors associ-
ated with APN, including consumption of raw chicken
meat and recent Campylobacter infection.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Data Collection
This case-control study was conducted at the University of Mel-
bourne Veterinary Teaching Hospital (U-Vet hospital) between
March 2015 and February 2017. Cases originated from 2 contigu-
ous Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales). Data on
potential explanatory variables and clinical specimens were col-
lected from dogs affected by APN (cases) and were compared to a
group of healthy dogs (controls). Dogs from both groups were
recruited over the duration of the study period in an incidence
density-based sampling strategy (ie, as each case was recruited, 2
controls were recruited) with very coarse frequency matching by
dog size (so that this variable could still later be analyzed for asso-
ciations with case-control status). Considering that the prevalence
of C. jejuni in clinically normal dogs appears to be higher in dogs
<6 months of age, we included only dogs >1 year of age in both
groups.20,21
Acute polyradiculoneuritis is diagnosed based on characteristic
clinical signs and clinical course, supportive diagnostic tests, and
by exclusion of other causes of generalized weakness. Inclusion cri-
teria for the APN group were acute onset of ascending LMN signs
≤3 weeks before presentation and no evidence of possible exposure
to botulism neurotoxin. In addition, hematology and biochemistry
(including creatine kinase [CK] activity and serum potassium
concentration, n = 23), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (n = 7),
indirect fluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) for Toxoplasma gondii
(n = 4) and Neospora caninum (n = 8), serum total thyroxine (T4)
concentration (n = 11), acetylcholine receptor antibodies (n = 12),
and electrodiagnostic examination (n = 9) also were considered
and performed when available. However, these tests were not a
requirement to be included in the disease group.
The control group included dogs defined as healthy based on
history and physical examination. The animals were either client-
owned or pets owned by staff members. Dogs were excluded
from the study if they were receiving any medication at the time
of enrollment or up to 1 month before the study, with the excep-
tion
of
vaccinations
and
prophylactic
antiparasitic
therapy.
Informed consent was obtained from all owners before study
enrollment, and the project was approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the University of Melbourne, Australia (AEC
number 1513717).
Demographic, environmental and dog lifestyle factors were
investigated as potential risk factors. Data were obtained from the
medical records, and owner questionnaires were undertaken in
both groups. These questionnaires were available in every case to
collect data relative to the dog’s environment and way of living
for epidemiological analysis. A section in the questionnaire to col-
lect details regarding the natural course of the disease also was
available for the APN group (Data S1 and S2).
Sample Collection and Laboratory Methods
Paired fecal samples, swabs, or both were collected from each
enrolled animal to perform initial direct culture within 24 hours.
All cultures were performed under microaerophilic conditions
using the CampyGen 3.5 system.a One fecal sample or swab was
plated directly on a selective medium, Campylobacter charcoal-
cased selective (CSM) agar. The additional fecal sample or swab
was inoculated into Bolton broth for selective enrichment and
incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. A second CSM agar plate then
was inoculated with a loopful of the Bolton broth. The CSM
plates were incubated at 37°C and were examined for growth after
24 and 48 hours. Suspect colonies were purified on sheep blood
agar (SBA), and subcultures were identified at the genus level by
growth characteristics and microscopy. The remainder of the Bol-
ton broth and fecal samples were stored at �20°C. Genomic DNA
extraction was performed directly from the fecal sample or swab,
from Bolton broth enrichment cultures, and from purified bacterial
isolates using a silica-based column method.22 Purified genomic
DNA preparations were stored at �20°C. Campylobacter identifi-
cation was performed using molecular identification methods. All
suspect Campylobacter bacterial isolates, Bolton broth, and fecal
DNA extracts were screened for the presence of Campylobacter
spp, 16S DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which was
performed on approximately 100 ng of genomic DNA as previ-
ously described.23 We considered Campylobacter-positive samples
to be those positive on culture, PCR, or both. The cadF gene also
was detected by PCR as described previously.24 Campylobacter
that were cadF positive were differentiated as C. jejuni or Campy-
lobacter coli. However those isolates, together with all of the other
Campylobacter isolates, also were identified by 16S ribosomal
DNA sequencing. The 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR using
Bioline MyTaq mixb and 20 lM of each of the primers 27F
(AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG)
and
1492R
(TACGGYT
ACCTTGTTACGACTT)25 and approximately 50 ng of genomic
DNA. The reaction was subjected to 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec-
onds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 90 seconds with a final
extension of 5 minutes at 72°C. Sanger sequencing of the gene was
performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility on a puri-
fied PCR product capturing approximately 1,100 bp including the
hypervariable
V3
region
using
primers
341F

and

(AAACTCAAAGGAATTGA

with the curated databases of EzBiocloud27 and the Ribosomal
Database Project,28 and sequence-based identification was con-
firmed with sequence similarity cutoff values set at 97 and 99% for
genus and species level, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Frequency cross-tabulations were prepared of APN cases and
controls by each of the putative risk factors. Odds ratios (OR),
95% confidence intervals (CI), and P-values were first estimated
using univariable exact logistic regression. This approach is well
suited to modeling binary outcome variables for small sample
size datasets, when some of the cells formed by the outcome and
categorical predictor variable(s) have no observations or both
situations.29 Exact logistic regression provides ORs, the desired
measure of association for a case-control study. To further inves-
tigate the effect of sampling delays, the association between
Campylobacter spp. positivity, and APN status, the case defini-
tion was restricted to include only cases for which sampling
occurred within 10, 7, and 4 days, respectively, of clinical onset
of APN (represented by the variables, Campylobacter spp. posi-
tive <10, <7, and <4 days, respectively). Variables with <10%
missing data and associated with the outcome in univariable
analysis at P < 0.25 were considered for multivariable analyses.
A putative causal diagram was developed a priori in Dagitty30
to guide multivariable analysis, considering that several of the
exposure variables, if causal, could be acting through the same
pathway (such as raw meat consumption, raw chicken consump-
tion, and Campylobacter spp. positivity). Modeling proceeded
using a manual backward stepwise approach, considering the
minimum adjustment set for the stated hypothesis of most inter-
est (testing the association between positivity to Campylobacter
spp. and APN case status), and continued until only variables
statistically significant at P < 0.05 were retained in the final
model. Given the small sample size, no interaction terms were
tested.
Results
The APN group included 27 dogs, with 19 females
(15/19 neutered) and 8 males (5/8 neutered). Mean age
at the time of study enrollment was 7.4 years (standard
deviation [SD], 3.6), and median weight was 8.5 kg
(range, 3.8–25 kg). Cases occurred evenly throughout
the year, and breed distribution was as follows: Maltese
(7), Poodle (6), Jack Russell Terrier, and Griffon Brux-
ellois (2 each) and Fox Terrier, Silky Terrier, Labrador
Retriever, Cocker Spaniel, Golden Retriever, Border
Collie, Beagle, Pomeranian, German Shepherd, and
Miniature
Schnauzer
(1
each).
The

47
healthy
dogs,
with
31
females
(28/31

6.7 years (SD, 3.2) and median weight was 14 kg
(range, 3.0–46 kg). The breed distribution was as fol-
lows: Maltese mixed, Poodle mixed, and Jack Russell
Terrier (5 each); Border Collie and German Shepherd
(3 each); Chihuahua (2); crossbreed (7); and Silky
Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Pomeranian, Miniature
Schnauzer, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Greyhound,
Cairn Terrier, Dalmatian, Australian Kelpie, Australian
Koolie, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, German
Shorthaired
Pointer,
Staffordshire
Bull
Terrier,
German Spitz, Border Terrier, Blue Heeler, and Mastiff
(1 each).
Fecal samples were positive for Campylobacter spp. in
13 of 27 of the APN cases compared with 11 of 47
cases in the control group. Of the positive cases in the
APN group, 2 were positive by PCR only and the
remainder tested positive by both methods (PCR and
culture). None of the APN cases was positive by culture
only. In the control group, 3 dogs had positive Campy-
lobacter culture, 6 had positive PCR, and the remaining
cases had both positive culture and PCR. Within the
APN group, median time from onset of clinical signs to
fecal sample collection was 4.5 days (range, 1–11 days)
in the Campylobacter-positive cases and 11 days (range,
2–20 days) for the negative ones. Most fecal samples
from positive APN cases (12/13) were collected within a
week of onset of clinical signs. One positive dog pre-
sented 11 days after onset of clinical signs, according to
the history provided by the owner. Overall, APN cases
had 3 times the odds of having had a recent laboratory-
confirmed episode of campylobacteriosis compared to
control dogs. As the case definition was tightened, the
strength of the association between detection of campy-
lobacteriosis and APN increased markedly and was sig-
nificant
when
only
cases
with
diagnostic
delays
<10 days were considered (see Table 1). With a case
definition that included only of cases with diagnostic
delays of <7 days, APN cases had 9.4 times higher odds
of a recent laboratory-confirmed episode of campy-
lobacteriosis compared to control dogs (P < 0.001).
Sequencing was available in 10 of 13 Campylobacter-
positive cases in the APN group, showing that 60% of
the samples were classified as Campylobacter upsaliensis
and 40% as C. jejuni. In the control group, DNA
sequencing was available from 5 of 11 of the Campy-
lobacter-positive cases showing that 80% were classified
as C. upsaliensis and 20% as C. jejuni. No C. coli was
isolated from any dog in our study.
Univariable exact logistic regression results including
OR, and their CI and P-values, for each of the explana-
tory variables considered for associations with case-con-
trol status are presented in Table 1. Age, weight, and sex
were not statistically significant (P = 0.37, P = 0.089,
P = 0.90, respectively). Interestingly, in the univariable
analysis, breed size was found to be significantly associ-
ated with APN case status (P = 0.024), with the most pro-
nounced effect being an association with small breeds.
Questionnaires from owners were returned for 24 of
27 of APN cases and for 47 of 47 of the control group
cases. However, based on their history in the clinical
database, details relative to the diet were available for
all APN cases. Twenty-six (96.3%) of the APN cases
were fed raw chicken, mainly chicken necks and wings.
Owners of APN cases had 70.7 times higher odds of
reporting that their dogs consumed raw chicken than
owners of control dogs (P < 0.001). The only APN case
that was not fed raw chicken had daily contact with live
chickens. Among the Campylobacter-positive dogs with
APN, all had raw chicken in their diet (13/13). No asso-
ciation between other risks factors and the disease was
found apart from raw poultry in the diet. Among the
354
Martinez-Anton et al
 variables statistically associated with case-control status
at P < 0.25, “Raw meat in diet,” “Raw chicken in diet,”
and “Campylobacter spp. positivity” all were considered
highly likely to be acting through the same causal path-
way (see Fig S1 for putative causal diagrams used to
guide multivariable model development). Given our pri-
mary interest in estimating the association between
Campylobacter spp. positivity and APN case status,
“Raw meat in diet,” “Raw chicken in diet,” and “Breed
size” dichotomized to represent “Small breed” dogs
were excluded from multivariable modeling on the basis
that they were not in the minimum adjustment set and
that, if included, they would lead to underestimation of
the total effect of Campylobacter spp. positivity. For
completeness, further multivariable models are included
in the supplementary materials: a model of APN case-
control status including “Raw chicken in diet” and

unadjusted and with adjustment for case-control status
(considered as estimators of the association between
these 2 explanatory variables in the study and source
populations, respectively), and a model of APN case-
control status including “Small breed” and Campy-
lobacter spp. positivity (Table S3).
In our study, 19 of 27 of the APN cases presented
with ascending flaccid tetraparesis. Descending tetra-
paresis was observed in 4 cases, and the remaining 4
cases had all limbs affected at the same time. None of
the dogs presented with tetraplegia, paraplegia, or both,
although the most were nonambulatory. Only 3 of 27
dogs remained ambulatory over the course of the dis-
ease. Dysphonia was reported in 18 of 19 of the dogs
and was not documented by owners in the remaining 8
cases. Hyperesthesia was noted in 6 of 27 dogs. Neck
ventroflexion was present in 20 of 27 dogs. Respiratory
involvement was recorded in 4 of 27 of the dogs, with
signs including increased respiratory rate and effort,
and paradoxical breathing. Decreased palpebral and
gag reflexes both were recorded in only 1 dog. This dog
had regurgitation, and thoracic radiographs were unre-
markable. Four dogs had experienced diarrhea before
the onset of clinical signs. One dog had a history of
coughing, and 2 had a history of vomiting before pre-
sentation. Two dogs were lost to follow-up. Nineteen
(70%) of the dogs recovered from the disease; 11 of 19
recovered completely whereas 8 of 19 recovered up to
80–90% of their normal function as reported by their
owners. Six dogs were euthanized, 1 because of deterio-
ration of clinical signs, and 4 based on the owner’s deci-
sion despite static clinical signs. One dog experienced
relapse of clinical signs. In this dog, relapse occurred
after 21 days and the owner elected euthanasia at this
stage (Table 2). This dog was positive for C. upsaliensis.
The median time to ambulation (>3 steps without sup-
port) from onset of the clinical signs was 50.7 days (range,
10–110 days). The median time to reach a plateau (best
clinical improvement) was 95.3 days (range, 13–300 days).
A thorough and in some cases repeated tick search
was performed and found to be negative in all of the
APN dogs. Complete hematology and biochemistry
tests were performed in 23 of 27 dogs and included
serum CK activity, which was mildly increased in 5 of
23 dogs (range, 508–1,980 U/L; reference range, 50–
400 U/L) and serum potassium concentration, which
was within the reference range in all of them (23/23).
Serum total T4 concentration was measured in 11 of 27
dogs and was decreased in 2 dogs (6 and 16 nM; refer-
ence range, 18–40 nM). Acetylcholine receptor antibody
was measured in 12 of 27 cases and was negative in all
instances. T. gondii IFAT was performed in 4 of 27 and
N. caninum IFAT was performed in 8 of 27 cases, and
results were negative in all instances. Antiraccoon saliva
antibody was not measured because raccoons are not
found in Australia. In the APN group, 7 dogs had
lumbar CSF analysis performed. Of these, 3 had albu-
minocytologic dissociation (protein concentration ran-
ged from 0.82 to 1.48 g/L; reference range, <0.5 g/L).
Two had normal CSF analysis, and the remaining 2
showed increased CSF proteins concentration (1.38
and 1.39 g/L) and nucleated cell count (ncc; 9 and
240 ncc/lL, respectively; reference range, <6 ncc/lL).
Detailed findings are presented in Table 3. Electromyog-
raphy (EMG) was performed in 9 of 27 dogs and was
abnormal in all of them, suggesting both demyelinating
and axonal neuropathy. Fibrillation potentials and posi-
tive sharp waves were present in all instances (9/9), as
noted on the clinical reports. Complete electrophysiologi-
cal reports were available for 5 of 9 dogs (Table S4).
Discussion
We
investigated
a
potential
association
between
Campylobacter infection and APN in dogs. Other
potential risk factors also were investigated, and a sig-
nificant association was detected between dogs affected
by APN and the consumption of raw chicken (with
owners of 96% of APN cases reporting raw chicken
consumption, compared to 26% of owners of control
dogs). Thus, raw chicken in the diet is highly likely to
increase the risk of developing APN in dogs in Aus-
tralia. In addition, 48% of the dogs with APN were
positive for Campylobacter infection compared with
23% in the control group. When a stringent case defi-
nition was applied (considering only cases in which the
fecal sample was collected within 7 days from onset of
the clinical signs), APN cases were 9.4 times more
likely to have had a recent laboratory-confirmed epi-
sode of campylobacteriosis compared to control dogs
(P < 0.001).

 Acute polyradiculoneuritis is an immune-mediated
polyneuropathy
affecting
peripheral
nerve
myelin,
axons, or both. The disease is characterized by acute
symmetrical ascending motor weakness and hyporeflexia
or areflexia.1–6 The most common presenting clinical
signs in our study were ascending flaccid tetraparesis
(70%), head and neck weakness (74%), and dysphonia
(95%). Six dogs (22%) had a history of gastrointestinal
signs before the onset of neurological signs. Cytology of
lumbar CSF showed albuminocytologic dissociation in
43% of the cases (3/7) and EMG identified spontaneous
activity in all cases, when performed. These findings are
consistent with those of other reports.7
Previous studies have shown that exposure to racoons
was the most common risk factor for dogs to develop
APN in North America.5,6,8 However, it is unclear what
triggers the immune response in dogs with no history of
exposure to racoon saliva. Association with protozoal
infections previously has been suspected.1 In a retro-
spective study investigating potential infectious origins,
it was suggested that infection with T. gondii may trig-
ger
APN
in
dogs,31
as
previously
reported
in
humans.32,33 However, in a more recent study, only 1 of
14 APN dogs was positive for T. gondii Abs.7 In our
study, APN cases tested for N. caninum and T. gondii
all were found to be negative. Moreover, CK activity
was within normal limits in most dogs (18/23). The
other 5 dogs had mildly increased CK activity, which
was interpreted to be a consequence of prolonged
recumbency rather than neuro-myopathy. Studies in
people have recognized the development of GBS after
vaccinations against several pathogens within 6 weeks
of receiving the injection.17–19 Recent vaccination also
has been reported as a potential cause of APN in a
dog.34 Only 1 of our APN cases had a history of vacci-
nation within 6 weeks of hospital presentation. Overall,
previous vaccination was not found to be a significant
risk factor of APN in our study.
Acute polyradiculoneuritis has been proposed to be
the canine equivalent of GBS in humans.1–7 Both
diseases
share
similarities
including
clinical
signs
(acute onset of ascending LMN signs), pathological
changes (demyelination of the ventral nerve roots), and,
more recently, the presence of serum antiganglioside
antibodies.7 The most frequently identified infectious
agent associated with subsequent development of the
GBS in humans is C. jejuni.10 Indeed, C. jejuni has been
isolated in 30% of GBS cases in humans.35 Molecular
mimicry and a cross-reactive immune response play cru-
cial roles in the pathogenesis of GBS. It seems that the
lipopolysaccharides from the bacteria contain a gan-
glioside-like epitope that resembles elements of periph-
eral nerve gangliosides.36,37 The relationship between
Campylobacter infection and APN in dogs is unknown.
In a retrospective study,30 C. jejuni was detected by
serology (ELISA) in 4 of 44 of the dogs with APN and
in 6 of 44 of the control dogs. In contrast, 13 of 27
(48%) of our APN cases were positive for Campylobac-
ter infection, based on a combination of fecal culture
and PCR from fecal samples. In human medicine,
culture is considered the standard for detection of
C. jejuni.10 However, fecal culture may be negative even
if Campylobacter exists in the feces because only a small
number of bacteria are present a few weeks after
infection.35 The isolation rate of Campylobacter from
fecal culture of human patients with GBS ranges from 8
to 50% whereas the detection rate by PCR has been
reported to be significantly higher in 1 study.35,38,39
These results are similar to those of our study where
isolation rate of Campylobacter spp. from fecal culture
in the APN dogs was 41% (11/27). PCR helped detect
an additional 2 cases that initially were negative on cul-
ture. Serology is more sensitive but less specific than
culture-based methods.10,40 In human medicine, serol-
ogy for C. jejuni uses ELISA with a crude antigenic
extract prepared from geographically prevalent C. jejuni
strains. Because the antigen is crude, and most often a
single serum sample is studied, the specificity of the test
remains questionable.40 In infected people, C. jejuni has
a
short
median
excretion
period
of
approximately
16 days. This finding is similar to that described in
dogs.41 In addition, the variable lag time between acute
C. jejuni infection and development of GBS is 1–
3 weeks in humans. Finally, the number of organisms
in the fecal sample, if present, is presumed to be lower
when GBS develops as compared to the acute phase of
C. jejuni infection.39 Interestingly, among the dogs with
APN, the majority of Campylobacter-positive samples
(92%) were collected and analyzed within 1 week (me-
dian, 4.5 days) of the onset of clinical signs whereas for
Campylobacter-negative samples, the median time from
the onset of clinical signs to fecal sample collection was
longer (11 days). To account for the likely short shed-
ding period combined with delayed onset of clinical
signs, we applied a more restrictive case definition,
including only APN cases that were sampled within 10,
7, and 4 days after the onset of clinical signs. We then

Campylobacter in Acute Polyradiculoneuritis

 found highly significant associations between presence
of Campylobacter in feces and development of APN
(P < 0.001), specifically that the dogs with APN were
9.4 times more likely to be positive for Campylobacter
infection
than
control
dogs
when
sampled
within
10 days of the onset of clinical signs. Therefore, the
negative results in our APN group may have been
caused by a delay in performing fecal diagnostic tests.
However, other possible causes for the 14 negative cases
also could be considered, including recent vaccination
(1/14) and other unknown infectious agents. Some of
these dogs tested seronegative for N. caninum (6/14)
and T. gondii (3/14).
Little literature is available about the prevalence of
Campylobacter spp. among healthy dogs in Australia. In 1
study from South Australia, a prevalence of 40% percent
was observed in healthy dogs (nondiarrheic) although in
this study most of the dogs (88%) were unowned strays.42
Therefore, this study supports previous work suggesting
that animals from shelters or commercially kennelled ani-
mals have a higher exposure rate to Campylobacter spp.
than do domestic dogs.41 To our knowledge, our study is
the first to report the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in
healthy domestic dogs in Australia and in dogs suffering
from APN. Across the groups, C. upsaliensis was the most
common species isolated in our study, in 10 of 15 (67%)
cases where sequencing was available, followed by C. jejuni
which was isolated in 5 of 15 cases (see Table 1). The
prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in healthy dogs was 23%
(80% C. upsaliensis) which is similar to previous studies
available from other countries where prevalence ranged
from 17 to 59%, with C. upsaliensis being the most com-
mon isolate. C. jejuni accounted for the remainder.43–45
The prevalence of C. jejuni seems to be lower in general in
healthy dogs, from 1 to 40% depending on geographical
location.42,44 Most of the studies discussing the link
between Campylobacter spp. in humans and GBS are based
on C. jejuni, and therefore, the role of C. upsaliensis
requires further investigation. To our knowledge, 3 cases
of GBS related to C. upsaliensis infection have been
reported in humans.46–48 Hence, C. upsaliensis appears to
be a potential trigger for APN in dogs and GBS in people,
although the question remains whether C. upsaliensis
induces the disease by eliciting an antibody response
against an antigen, similar to the mechanism involving
C. jejuni. The risk of developing GBS after C. jejuni infec-
tion in people is low (0.1%), suggesting that genetic factors
may be involved in triggering the disease.10 Whether preex-
isting antibodies play a role in developing the disease also
is unknown. The short duration of C. jejuni shedding in
dogs suggests that it infects dogs transiently rather than
being a commensal organism.41 In our APN group, the
presence of C. jejuni was higher than in the control group
(40 versus 20%). Although this finding was not significant,
C. jejuni was 2.5 times more likely to be present among the
APN cases than in the control group. The short C. jejuni
shedding time then would explain why we were only able
to isolate C. upsaliensis in some of the APN cases.
In our study, consumption of raw chicken meat was
strongly associated with the occurrence of APN. Poul-
try is the most common source of C. jejuni infection in
industrialized countries and, in retail surveys, C. jejuni
is isolated relatively commonly from commercial poul-
try products.49 Therefore, contact with or consumption
of raw or undercooked poultry products is an impor-
tant source of exposure to Campylobacter strains associ-
ated with neurological diseases.50,51 Results from a
study in New Zealand52 showed that food safety mea-
sures to decrease contamination of fresh poultry meat
with Campylobacter spp. not only decreased incidence
of campylobacteriosis but also were associated with
decreased incidence of GBS. Transmission of Campy-
lobacter may be prevented by improving sanitation,
well-cooked poultry products and public health warn-
ings about the hazards of raw chicken consumption.
The presence of C. upsaliensis in commercial poultry
has been reported to range from 1 to 9.7%,53,54 suggest-
ing that chickens may be a source of emerging Campy-
lobacter species.
A significant association was found between small
breeds and APN. Based on our clinical experience,
small dogs are more likely to be fed raw chicken
because of the presence of small bones in the chicken
which are easily eaten by these dogs rather than larger
meat bones that may be fed to medium and large breed
dogs. The association between breed size and APN may
be explained by the hypothesis that small dogs are fed
chicken necks and wings more frequently than are lar-
ger breed dogs. Genetic factors, as suggested in humans
with GBS, also may be a factor in any breed differences
in the incidence of APN.
Isolation of Campylobacter from fecal samples is
challenging because of the organism’s fragility and short
shedding period after infection. Ideally, all samples in
our study would have been collected within 10 days
after onset of clinical signs to confirm whether the delay
in sampling is a factor in negative results in some dogs.
Analysis of the raw chicken given to the APN dogs also
would have been helpful, but such samples were not
available from the owners.
Our study clearly demonstrates that consumption of
raw chicken is a risk factor for dogs in the development
of APN, and we suspect that Campylobacter infection is
most likely to be an immunologic trigger as described
in humans with GBS.
