Abstract 
35 
 
36 
Individuals are thought to have their own distinctive body odour which reportedly plays an 
37 
important role in mate choice. In the present study we investigated individual differences in 
38 
body odours of women and examined whether some women generally smell more attractive 
39 
than others or whether odour preferences are a matter of individual taste. We then explored 
40 
whether levels of reproductive hormones explain women’s body odour attractiveness, to test 
41 
the idea that body odour attractiveness may act as a chemosensory marker of reproductive 
42 
fitness. Fifty-seven men rated body odours of 28 healthy, naturally cycling women of 
43 
reproductive age. We collected all odours at peak fertility to control for menstrual cycle 
44 
effects on body odour attractiveness. Women’s salivary estradiol, progesterone, testosterone 
45 
and cortisol levels were assessed at the time of odour collection to test whether hormone 
46 
levels explain body odour attractiveness. We found that the men highly agreed on how 
47 
attractive they found women’s body odours. Interestingly, women’s body odour attractiveness 
48 
was predicted by their estradiol and progesterone levels: The higher a woman’s levels of 
49 
estradiol and the lower her levels of progesterone, the more attractive her body odour was 
50 
rated. In showing that women’s body odour attractiveness is explained by levels of female 
51 
reproductive hormones, but not by levels of cortisol or testosterone, we provide evidence that 
52 
body odour acts as a valid cue to potential fertility.

1. Introduction 
58 
Olfaction allegedly plays an important role in mate choice of both human and non-human 
59 
species [cf.,  1, 2, 3]. It is widely thought that every individual has her own unique body 
60 
odour, much like a fingerprint [4]. Here we collected women’s body odours to examine 
61 
whether some women generally smell more attractive than others or whether odour 
62 
attractiveness lies “in the nose of the smeller”. And if some women generally smell more 
63 
attractive than others, can a woman’s body odour attractiveness be explained by her 
64 
individual levels of reproductive hormones (e.g., estradiol and progesterone)? 
65 
Studies on physical attractiveness of women’s faces and bodies have found that men 
66 
show remarkable agreement on who is seen as attractive and who not [e.g., 5, 6]. An 
67 
evolutionary approach to female attractiveness proposes that men should generally prefer 
68 
women who signal high reproductive health and fertility [e.g., 7, 8, 9]. In women, 
69 
reproductive health can be indexed by levels of reproductive hormones: Elevated levels of 
70 
female reproductive hormones increase the likelihood of conception [e.g., 10, 11]. Female 
71 
reproductive hormones, in particular estradiol and progesterone, have been shown to be 
72 
positively related to women’s facial and body attractiveness. For example, higher levels of 
73 
estradiol and progesterone lead to larger breasts and curvier waists, resulting in the hourglass 
74 
figure that is typically preferred by men [12, 13; but see 14, 15]. Similarly, faces of women 
75 
with higher estradiol levels are judged as being more attractive than faces of women with low 
76 
estradiol levels [e.g., 16; but see 15, 17].  
77 
The present study investigates for the first time whether the same is true for women’s 
78 
body odours. Given that attractiveness is thought to signal various desirable qualities of a 
79 
potential partner (e.g., health, reproductive success) and assuming that body odours play an 
80 
important role in human mate choice [e.g., 2], it is likely that body odour attractiveness acts as 
81 
a chemosensory signal of reproductive fitness. We hence expect individual levels in 
82 
 4 
 
reproductive hormones (e.g., estradiol and progesterone) to be related to women’s body odour 
83 
attractiveness. 
84 
Although no study has yet directly tested whether reproductive hormones are related to 
85 
body odour attractiveness in women, there is some indirect evidence for a link between 
86 
hormones and odour attractiveness. For example, in naturally cycling women body odour 
87 
varies significantly across the menstrual cycle. An increasing number of studies report that 
88 
women's body odour is rated as more attractive if gathered during the late follicular phase 
89 
(near ovulation) compared to odour that was collected in other cycle phases [18-21]. The late 
90 
follicular phase coincides with high estradiol and low progesterone levels. While within-
91 
woman variation in hormone levels may explain within-woman variance in body odour 
92 
attractiveness, no study has yet directly investigated whether individual hormone levels are 
93 
associated with between-women variation in body odour attractiveness. 
94 
The main source of human body odour are the apocrine sweat glands [cf. 22]. An 
95 
individual’s characteristic body odour results from various bacteria operating upon the 
96 
viscous secretions of these glands, producing a complex mixture of volatile organic 
97 
compounds [23-27]. Other candidates that contribute to body odour are odorous steroids and 
98 
unsaturated fatty acids, such as 3M2H [e.g., 28]. Given that odorous steroids are related to 
99 
reproductive hormones it is conceivable that levels of endogenous reproductive hormones are 
100 
related to body odour.  Men and women differ substantially in the structure and flora of the 
101 
axillary scent glands [29-31] and in the odorous steroids contained in their sweat [32, 33]. 
102 
These sex differences and the fact that they become active after puberty suggest that they play 
103 
a role in sexual communication [34].  
104 
A further factor reported to influence body odour and body odour preferences are the 
105 
genes at the major histocompatibility complex [MHC, or human leukocyte antigen system, 
106 
HLA, in humans, see 35 for a review]. Some studies have suggested that men prefer body 
107 
odours of HLA-dissimilar or HLA-heterozygous women [e.g., 36]. Studies looking at HLA-
108 
 5 
 
mediated odour preferences imply that, rather than showing universal preferences for certain 
109 
body odours, men have individual preferences for women’s body odours, depending on the 
110 
woman’s and their own genetic make-up.  
111 
The present study sets out to investigate whether men agree when judging the 
112 
attractiveness of women’s body odours and if so, whether this can be explained by women’s 
113 
individual levels of reproductive hormones (estradiol, and progesterone). Because women’s 
114 
body odour has been reported to vary across the menstrual cycle [e.g., 18, 19], we controlled 
115 
for cycle effects of body odour by collecting women’s body odours during the late follicular 
116 
phase (LH-peak). Hence, we not only controlled for menstrual cycle phase, but in fact also 
117 
targeted odour collection to take place at peak fertility which, from a biological perspective, is 
118 
the most relevant period of the menstrual cycle, since only then women can conceive. To 
119 
control for HLA-associated odour preferences, we typed raters and donors at five HLA loci 
120 
and calculated the HLA similarity between each rater and donor. We also calculated a 
121 
measure of donor heterozygosity by adding up for each donor the number of alleles that were 
122 
heterozygous. We collected axillary odour samples using cotton pads.   
123 
We first calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify the inter-rater 
124 
reliability. We then used multilevel linear regressions to test whether women’s estradiol and 
125 
progesterone levels predict the attractiveness of their body odour. Our analyses also 
126 
considered potential effects of testosterone and HLA on body odour preferences. Levels of the 
127 
stress hormone cortisol were also included, since stress and anxiety are known to have an 
128 
impact on body odour [e.g., 37, 38]. The advantage of using multilevel regressions is that we 
129 
can enter participants as level-2 variable with hormone levels and ratings nested within 
130 
participants, enabling us to analyse the data without aggregating scores. Paralleling studies on 
131 
facial and body attractiveness, we expect women’s estradiol and progesterone levels to be 
132 
positively associated with women’s body odour attractiveness, since lifetime estradiol and 
133 
progesterone are positively related to a woman’s reproductive potential [e.g., 10, 12].

2. Methods 
136 
(a) Participants 
137 
Forty-two women (odour donors, mean age = 20.8, SD = 6.6) and 57 men (odour raters, 
138 
mean age = 23, SD = 2.8) initially took part in this study. All participants reported being 
139 
Caucasian and of European descent (at least back to their grandparents) and being 
140 
heterosexual. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the 
141 
Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent to take part in this 
142 
study and were treated in accordance with the ethical protocol approved by the Faculty of 
143 
Human Sciences of the University of Bern and by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of 
144 
Bern. Odour donors received 140 CHF and odour raters received 45 CHF as compensation. 
145 
 
146 
(b) Odour collection procedure 
147 
Odour donors (all female) were initially screened in a telephone interview for the 
148 
required inclusion criteria: (a) aged between 17 and 40 years, (b) medication-free (including 
149 
hormonal contraception for at least 3 previous months), (c) regular menstrual cycle (average 
150 
length of between 25 and 35 days), (d) not pregnant or breastfeeding and (e) non-smoker. In 
151 
the same telephone interview we also collected demographic information and information 
152 
about their menstrual cycle (regularity, length and onset of last menstrual bleeding). 
153 
Using OvaCUE© fertility monitors, we predicted high fertility days during which odour 
154 
collection was to take place (see electronic supplementary material, ESM1, Section A). One 
155 
day before the date of predicted peak fertility, participants started collecting body odour using 
156 
cotton axillary pads.  
157 
The odour donors were requested to follow a strict schedule of dietary and behavioural 
158 
restrictions while collecting their body odour (see electronic supplementary material, ESM1 
159 
Section B, for details). On the evenings of the sampling, before applying the cotton axillary 
160 
 7 
 
pads to their left and right armpits, odour donors were instructed to take a shower with the 
161 
non-perfumed soap supplied in the material package. Then donors fixed cotton pads (Ebelin 
162 
cosmetic pads, DM-drogerie markt, www.dm-drogeriemarkt.de) to both armpits using 3M 
163 
Micropore surgical tape. Donors collected body odour on three consecutive nights. To 
164 
determine time of highest fertility, participants completed a series of urine tests measuring the 
165 
luteinizing hormone (LH) using one-step urine ovulation tests with a reported LH sensitivity 
166 
of 10mlU/ml (David One Step Ovulation Tests, Runbio Biotech, China, http://www.runbio-
167 
bio.com). Women were instructed to perform urine tests twice a day (morning and evening) 
168 
starting one day before the date of predicted peak fertility. After a positive test result, 
169 
participants continued performing the tests until the results became negative for two 
170 
subsequent days. Participants photographed each test using their smart phones and sent the 
171 
picture to the study manager, who verified whether the test was positive or not. 
172 
In the evenings before body odour collection, each donor collected a saliva sample from 
173 
which steroid hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol) were 
174 
determined. Participants were instructed to refrain from eating and to abstain from caffeine 
175 
for at least 30 minutes prior to saliva collection. Participants were asked to rinse their mouth 
176 
with fresh water and to wait approximately 5 min before providing saliva. Samples were 
177 
collected by passive drool using a commercially available sampling device (SaliCaps, IBL, 
178 
International, Hamburg, Germany). The saliva samples were stored at -28°C and were later 
179 
analyzed by an independent laboratory (Dresden Lab Service GmbH, Dresden, Germany) 
180 
using liquid chromatography with coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-
181 
MS/MS has become the method of choice for steroid analysis because of its high sensitivity, 
182 
better reproducibility, greater specificity, and ability to analyse multiple steroids 
183 
simultaneously. 
184 
 8 
 
After odour collection, the pads were stored in separate sealable plastic bags and were 
185 
frozen at -30°C until use. Previous studies have shown that freezing has no significant effect 
186 
on attractiveness ratings [39]. 
187 
When returning their body odour samples to the lab, donors were asked a series of 
188 
questions in a structured face-to-face interview, adapted from Gildersleeve and colleagues 
189 
[40]. In this interview, we assessed how long the women had worn their axillary pads and 
190 
whether they had complied with the dietary and behavioural restrictions (see electronic 
191 
supplementary material, ESM1, Section C, for details).  
192 
(c) Donor dropouts 
193 
Only pads from the night closest to the LH peak were included in the study. Of the 42 
194 
women, nine did not show an LH peak during odour collection and five had violated the 
195 
dietary and behavioural restrictions, resulting in a total of 28 donors who provided pads for 
196 
the present study (age range: 18 - 36 years; mean = 26.9; SD= 3.6). We note that this range 
197 
was rather skewed; there was only one woman who was 36, all the rest were between 18 and 
198 
28 years of age. Excluding the 36 year old woman from the analyses did not change the 
199 
results (see electronic supplementary material, ESM3). 
200 
(d) Odour rating procedure 
201 
Every rater rated the body odours of all 28 women that were available for this study. 
202 
Ratings took place on four afternoons. Each rater appeared on two of these afternoons, 
203 
separated by one week. On each afternoon, raters evaluated the odours of 14 women. Half of 
204 
the participants rated left-arm pads, the other half rated right-arm pads. Left and right arm 
205 
pads were rated on separate afternoons. Each pad was hence defrosted only once for this study 
206 
and was destroyed and disposed of after use. The pads were thawed three hours before the 
207 
respective rating session started and were placed in separate 500ml opaque glass jars [cf. 41, 
208 
42, 43]. Three research assistants smelled the pads and confirmed that none was contaminated 
209 
with extraneous odours (e.g., perfume, smoke). 
210 
 9 
 
To assess the odour preferences we closely followed the procedures reported in [41, 42]. 
211 
To prepare for the rating session, odour raters (all male) were asked not to eat and to refrain 
212 
from drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages for 1 h prior to testing, as these activities are 
213 
known to affect smelling ability. After giving informed consent, the participants underwent 
214 
two practice trials. Participants were asked to smell and rate the body odours of two women 
215 
who were not included in the experiment proper. After the practice trials a male experimenter 
216 
gave them a tube (SaliCaps, IBL, International, Hamburg, Germany) to collect their saliva 
217 
sample from which we assessed testosterone levels. The saliva samples were stored at -28°C 
218 
and were later analyzed together with the donors’ saliva samples by an independent laboratory 
219 
(Dresden Lab Service GmbH, Dresden, Germany) using LC-MS/MS.  
220 
In each session, odour raters rated the body odours of 14 different women. The jars 
221 
containing the pads of these women were placed in separate visually shielded booths. Order 
222 
of pads was randomized for each rater. Odour raters were asked to rate the women’s body 
223 
odour samples on a visual analogue scale (0-100) for attractiveness. If a rater found any of the 
224 
samples too weak to assess, he was asked to select “I cannot smell the sample” instead of 
225 
using the rating scales; these samples were not included in further analysis. Sniffing time was 
226 
not restricted (see electronic supplementary material, ESM2, for details).  
227 
At the very end of the second session, participants were given 12 Sniffin' Sticks 
228 
(Screening 12 Test, Burghart Messtechnik GmbH, www.burghart-mt.de), to evaluate their 
229 
general smelling abilities.  
230 
All data collection was conducted using Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com), running on 
231 
individual portable tablet computers. 
232 
 
233 
(e) Rater dropouts 
234 
One rater did not return for the second test session, and another scored low on the 
235 
Sniffin’ Sticks (score of 3 out of 12). These two raters were excluded from further analyses. 
236 
 10 
 
The final sample hence consisted of 55 raters ranging in age between 20 and 37 years (mean = 
237 
23; SD = 2.9).  Of these, four did not provide blood samples for HLA analyses. 
238 
(f) HLA typing procedure 
239 
All participants (28 women, 57 men) were invited to the laboratory for venous blood 
240 
sampling. Before blood sampling, participants read the study information and gave written 
241 
informed consent. The participants’ blood samples (10 ml) were genotyped for HLA-class I 
242 
(HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1) using LinkSēq™ test 
243 
kits (Linkage BiosystemsTM). These test kits are based on real-time polymerase chain reaction 
244 
(PCR) using allele-specific exponential amplification (sequence-specific primers). The 
245 
resulting amplimers were subjected at end-point to a melting curve analysis to identify 
246 
specific DNA based on melting temperature using SYBR® Green. Attribution of HLA-
247 
genotypes was done using SureTyper™ software. Ambiguities were resolved using 
248 
alternative typing methods via routine HLA-typing. 
249 
  
250 
3. Statistical analysis 
251 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 24.0 and level of significance was set at 
252 
p < .05. We first calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify how much 
253 
the raters agree on the attractiveness of women’s odours. We then ran multilevel linear 
254 
regressions with attractiveness ratings as dependent variables. The first model included 
255 
estradiol and progesterone levels as Level-1 predictors of body odour judgements. Raters 
256 
were entered at Level 2. We then repeated the analysis after adding the estradiol x 
257 
progesterone interaction as additional Level 1 predictor. In a second model, we included 
258 
testosterone and cortisol together with estradiol and progesterone levels at Level 1. In a third 
259 
model, we included rater testosterone levels together with donor estradiol and progesterone at 
260 
Level 1 to examine whether testosterone influences body odour perception. This analysis was 
261 
 11 
 
repeated after adding the donor estradiol x rater testosterone and donor progesterone x rater 
262 
testosterone interactions as additional Level 1 predictor. In a final model, we controlled for 
263 
the influence of HLA similarity between raters and donors. To do so, we calculated an HLA-
264 
Similarity-Index for each rater-donor pair.  We also calculated a continuous measure of HLA-
265 
heterozygosity by adding up for each donor the number of alleles that were heterozygous. 
266 
These HLA indices were then entered as covariates, together with donor estradiol and 
267 
progesterone levels. 
268 
The reported estimates in the multilevel models are unstandardised regression 
269 
coefficients. Because examination of hormonal data revealed that the distributions were 
270 
skewed, we log transformed the hormone values to achieve normal distributions. We report 
271 
analyses performed with log-transformed data, but whether we used raw or normalised data 
272 
did not change the results. 
273 
4. Results 
274 
A total of 1540 (28 x 55) ratings were completed. Of these, 101 (6.5 %) were rated as not 
275 
perceivable. We note that the non-perceivable trials were not always from the same pad (i.e., 
276 
woman). In other words, there was no pad that was not perceivable in all cases: the non-
277 
perceivable pads did not come from specific women, but were randomly distributed over 
278 
different donors. Ratings of left and right pads correlated with R = .668, p < .001, and there 
279 
was no significant difference between the attractiveness of left and right pads (p = .886), 
280 
therefore they were pooled for all subsequent analyses.  
281 
Hormone data: For donors, estradiol levels ranged from 3.2 pg/ml to 15.6 pg/ml (mean = 
282 
7.1, SD = 3.1), progesterone levels ranged from 2.5 pg/ml to 87.7 pg/ml (mean = 21.3, SD = 
283 
22.0), testosterone levels ranged from 3.2 pg/ml to 15.8 pg/ml (mean = 7.7, SD = 3.5), and 
284 
cortisol levels from 0.3 nmol/L to 10.6 nmol/L (mean = 2.1, SD = 2.3). For raters, we 
285 
 12 
 
measured only testosterone levels, ranging from 37.15 pg/ml to 118.3 pg/ml (mean = 70.02, 
286 
SD = 19.18). 
287 
Interrater-reliability: Intraclass correlation was high (ICC = .983), indicating excellent 
288 
reliability. This suggests that raters agreed highly on which odours they found more and 
289 
which ones they found less attractive.  
290 
Body odour attractiveness: The model including donor estradiol and progesterone levels 
291 
as covariates revealed that a woman’s estradiol and progesterone levels both significantly 
292 
predicted her body odour attractiveness. For estradiol, the relationship was positive 
293 
(Unstandardised Regression Coefficient (Estimate) = 9.62; standard error (SE) = 3.225; 
294 
95%CI [3.29, 15.95]; t = 2.982, df = 1376.042; p = .003) and for progesterone the relationship 
295 
was negative (Estimate = -10.83; SE = 1.295; 95%CI [-13.371, -8.290]; t = -8.362; df = 
296 
1378.216; p < .001). The estradiol x progesterone interaction did not reach statistical 
297 
significance (Estimate = 10.52; SE = 6.809; 95%CI [-2.832, 23.880]; t = 1.546; df = 
298 
1375.512; p = .122). Figure 1 depicts the positive relationship between estradiol and body 
299 
odour attractiveness ratings (left panel) and the negative relationship between progesterone 
300 
and attractiveness ratings (right panel). 
301

302 
When additionally entering donor testosterone and cortisol levels into the model, the 
303 
effects for estradiol (Estimate = 11.73; SE = 3.536; 95%CI [4.794, 18.667]; t = 3.318; df = 
304 
1374.949; p = .001) and progesterone (Estimate = -10.28; SE = 1.357; 95%CI [-12.938, -
305 
7.614]; t = -7.573; df = 1375.700; p < .001) remained significant, the effects of testosterone 
306 
(Estimate = -.265; SE = 3.210; 95%CI [-6.562, 6.032]; t = -.083; df = 1374.558; p = .934) and 
307 
cortisol (Estimate = -2.040; SE=1.656; 95%CI [-5.288, 1.209]; t = -1.232; df = 1376.047; p = 
308 
.218) were not significant.  
309 
The third model, where we tested for influences of men’s testosterone levels on their 
310 
ratings of women’s body odour attractiveness, we again found effects of donor estradiol 
311 
 13 
 
(Estimate = 9.590; SE = 3.228; 95%CI [3.258, 15.921]; t = 2.971; df = 1374.445; p = .003) 
312 
and progesterone (Estimate = -10.829; SE = 1.296; 95% CI [-13.371, -8.286]; t = -8.356; df = 
313 
1376.452; p < .001) but no effect of rater testosterone (Estimate = 4.272; SE = 5.025; 95%CI 
314 
[-5.637, 14.180]; t = .850; df = 1199.656; p = .396). Also, neither the rater testosterone x 
315 
donor estradiol interaction (Estimate = -21.425; SE = 21.531; 95%CI [-63.663, 20.812]; t = --
316 
.995; df = 1388.165; p = .320) nor the rater testosterone x donor progesterone interaction  
317 
(Estimate = -12.056; SE = 8.361; 95%CI [-28.458, 4.347]; t = -1.442; df = 1376.426; p = 
318 
.150) were significant. 
319 
The final model, where we additionally included HLA-similarity between donor and rater 
320 
and donor HLA-heterozygosity as covariates, again showed significant effects of estradiol 
321 
(Estimate = 8.634; SE = 3.421; 95%CI [1.921, 15.347]; t = 2.523; df = 1273.149; p = .012) 
322 
and progesterone (Estimate = -11.027; SE = 1.347; 95%CI [-13.669, -8.385]; t = -8.189; df = 
323 
1275.034; p < .001), but no effect of HLA similarity (Estimate = .34; SE = 0.351; 95%CI [-
324 
.344, 1.034]; t = .983; df = 1323.910; p = .326) or HLA heterozygosity (Estimate = 64.65; SE 
325 
= .434; 95%CI [-1.494, .209]; t = 1.480; df = 1275.174; p = .139).

5. Discussion 
328 
We tested whether women’s individual levels of reproductive hormones (e.g., estradiol 
329 
and progesterone) are associated with how attractive they smell and to what extent men agree 
330 
when judging the attractiveness of different women’s body odours. We found that men highly 
331 
agreed on which odours they found attractive and which ones they liked less. Most 
332 
interestingly, we found that women’s levels of endogenous estradiol and progesterone 
333 
predicted their body odour attractiveness. Specifically, women’s body odours were rated as 
334 
being more attractive the higher their estradiol levels and the lower their progesterone levels 
335 
were. Cortisol and testosterone levels were not associated with how attractive women’s body 
336 
odours were rated.  
337 
 14 
 
From an evolutionary point of view female attractiveness is thought to provide cues to 
338 
various desirable qualities that males may seek for in mates. Having high estradiol levels is 
339 
one of the desirable traits that men may seek in a woman, since estradiol is positively related 
340 
to a woman’s reproductive potential [e.g., 10]. Hence, selection on preferences for cues 
341 
potentially signalling high estradiol levels is likely to be strong, because they provide 
342 
information about a woman’s future, or potential, fertility [11, 44]. The present study provides 
343 
evidence that estradiol is positively related to women’s body odour attractiveness, suggesting 
344 
that body odour acts as a reliable cue to potential fertility. 
345 
Interestingly, we found a negative relation between women’s progesterone levels and their 
346 
body odour attractiveness. This may seem surprising because lifetime progesterone levels are 
347 
thought to be positively related to a woman’s reproductive potential [e.g., 10, 12]. We note 
348 
however that we collected all body odours at peak fertility, when women naturally smell their 
349 
best [cf., 18, 19, 21, 40]. At peak fertility, women typically have high estradiol and low 
350 
progesterone levels, and the estradiol-to-progesterone ratio is highly correlated with women’s 
351 
fertility across the menstrual cycle [45, 46]. Even though all the odour samples in the present 
352 
study came from currently fertile women, raters chose those odours to be most attractive that 
353 
came from women who were most fertile at that moment (i.e., who had highest estradiol 
354 
levels and lowest progesterone levels). This supports the notion that body odour is a cue to 
355 
fertility: the higher a woman’s fertility, the more attractive her body odour was to men. 
356 
The biochemical mechanism underlying the relationship between sex steroids and 
357 
women’s body odour is not clear. One possibility is that sex hormones act indirectly on body 
358 
odour via body temperature regulation. It has been shown that the control of skin blood flow 
359 
and sweating are modified by estradiol and progesterone, whereby estradiol promotes heat 
360 
dissipation (i.e., augmented cutaneous vasodilation and higher propensity of sweating, [47]) 
361 
and progesterone is reported to promote heat conservation [for reviews see 48, 49]. Increased 
362 
skin blood flow and sweating may lead to the excretion of certain odorous volatiles which on 
363 
 15 
 
their part might function as a cue to higher estradiol levels. A more direct explanation for the 
364 
effect of hormones on body odour might be that the axillary region secrets odorous 
365 
compounds resembling estradiol and progesterone. Transferred to our findings, this means 
366 
that an attractive body odour is a particularly female odour. Alternatively, estradiol and 
367 
progesterone may act directly on the volatile compounds or on the bacteria operating upon the 
368 
viscous secretions of various sweat glands. These hypotheses, while speculative in nature, 
369 
may help explain the interrelation between levels of female sex steroids and body odour 
370 
attractiveness, but will have to be specifically tested in future studies. 
371 
Because some studies have found that body odour preferences are mediated by the human 
372 
leukocyte antigen, [HLA, see 35 for a review] we controlled for HLA-mediated effects of 
373 
body odour preferences by including HLA-similarity between donor and rater at five HLA 
374 
loci and donor HLA-heterozygosity as covariates. Neither of these genetic measures predicted 
375 
woman’s body odour attractiveness. These results add to the growing body of literature that 
376 
questions HLA-mediated odour preferences in men [e.g., 42, 50, 51; for a meta-analysis, see 
377 
52]. 
378 
Together our findings suggest that some women generally smell nicer than others and 
379 
that the attractiveness of women’s body odour is influenced by their estradiol and 
380 
progesterone levels rather than by individual preferences of the rater or by human leucocyte 
381 
antigens (HLA). Chemical communication of sex and reproductive stage are ubiquitous in the 
382 
animal kingdom, facilitating sexual selection that arises through competition over mates [53]. 
383 
Our results provide strong evidence that humans also use chemical signals to communicate 
384 
their reproductive potential. Since estradiol and progesterone levels can be seen as indices of 
385 
reproductive health and fertility, we propose that body odours serve as reliable cues to 
386 
women’s reproductive fitness.
