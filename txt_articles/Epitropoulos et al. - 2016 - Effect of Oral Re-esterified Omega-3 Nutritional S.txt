Purpose: To assess the effect of oral re-esterified omega-3 fatty
acids on tear osmolarity, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tear
break-up time (TBUT), Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI),
fluorescein corneal staining, Schirmer score, meibomian gland
dysfunction (MGD) stage and omega-3 index in subjects with dry
eyes and confirmed MGD.
Methods: This was a multicenter, prospective, interventional,
placebo-controlled, double-masked study. Subjects were randomized
to receive 4 softgels containing a total of 1680 mg of eicosapentae-
noic acid/560 mg of docosahexaenoic acid or a control of 3136 mg
of linoleic acid, daily for 12 weeks. Subjects were measured at
baseline, week 6, and week 12 for tear osmolarity, TBUT, OSDI,
fluorescein corneal staining, and Schirmer test with anesthesia.
MMP-9 testing and omega-3 index were done at baseline and at
12 weeks.
Results: One hundred five subjects completed the study. They were
randomized to omega-3 (n = 54) and control group (n = 51).
Statistically significant reduction in tear osmolarity was observed in
the omega-3 group versus control group at week 6 (216.8 6 2.6 vs.
29.0 6 2.7 mOsm/L, P = 0.042) and week 12 (219.4 6 2.7 vs.
28.3 6 2.8 mOsm/L, P = 0.004). At 12 weeks, a statistically
significant increase in omega-3 index levels (P , 0.001) and TBUT
(3.5 6 0.5 s vs. 1.2 6 0.5 s, P = 0.002) was also observed. Omega-3
group experienced a significant reduction in MMP-9 positivity
versus control group (67.9% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.024) and OSDI
scores decreased significantly in omega-3 (217.0 6 2.6) versus
control group (25.0 6 2.7, P = 0.002).
Conclusions: Oral consumption of re-esterified omega-3 fatty acids
is associated with statistically significant improvement in tear osmolar-
ity, omega-3 index levels, TBUT, MMP-9, and OSDI symptom scores.

D
ry eye disease (DED) is a common, yet complex,
multifactorial progressive condition that can lead to
visual loss, damage to the ocular surface, discomfort, and
overall reduction in quality of life.1,2 Meibomian gland
dysfunction (MGD) results in inadequate and dysfunctional
lipid production, which leads to evaporative DED.3 MGD
has, also, recently been shown to be a sign of hypercholes-
terolemia.4,5 Because MGD is associated with altered lipid
composition, dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty
acids has been recommended in both the International Dry
Eye Workshop and International Workshop on Meibomian
Gland Dysfunction as primary therapy.2,3 With increased tear
film evaporation, tear film osmolarity is elevated and results
in ocular surface damage: epithelial cell desiccation, loss in
glycocalyx,6 inflammation, and cell apoptosis.7 Essential fatty
acids, including the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), perform
numerous roles in the human body and are considered
essential nutrients.8–10 They are important in the treatment
and prevention of DED.11–13
The rationale for treatment with oral omega-3 supple-
mentation in the management of meibomian gland disease may
be
explained
by
2
different
mechanisms
of
action.
The breakdown of omega-3 fatty acids results in anti-
inflammatory molecules that suppress the inflammatory path-
ways that are found in meibomian gland disease. In addition,
the unstable tear film associated with meibomian gland disease
results in evaporative dry eye. The oral supplementation of
omega-3 fatty acids changes the fatty acid composition of the
meibomian gland secretions resulting in a secretion that
contains increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids, which are
in a liquid state at body temperature preventing the blockage of

 the meibomian gland ducts and meibum stagnation. The
increased quality of the meibomian gland secretions reduces
tear film evaporation and the symptoms of DED.14
Several studies have previously shown the effectiveness
of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on DED. A large
retrospective study of 32,470 women showed that women
who consumed 5 to 6 servings of tuna fish per week (high in
omega-3) had a 66% reduction in DED compared with women
who consumed 2 or fewer servings a week.13 A randomized
clinical trial investigated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on
meibomian gland secretions and found an improvement in
Schirmer scores and fluorophotometry.15 Three studies have
previously shown symptomatic improvement in meibomian
gland disease with oral omega-3 supplementation.16–18
Substantial differences exist in the omega-3 prepara-
tions that are commercially available. Fish contains mercury
and carcinogens, making it risky to consume sufficient
omega-3 fatty acids by simply ingesting this food group. As
an important safety precaution, almost all commercial fish oils
employ a process of adding alcohol to detoxify these
compounds. However, this addition of alcohol induces
a chemical change in the natural triglycerides found in fish
oil and converts the triglyceride to an ethyl ester compound.
Our bodies have difficulties processing and absorbing the
ethyl ester compound, which is not found in nature.19
Re-esterification is a process that removes the artifi-
cially induced alcohol in chemically modified ethyl ester fish
oil to create a more natural form of omega-3 fatty acids that
is not only better tolerated with less gastrointestinal side
effects but also better absorbed than omega-3 fatty acids in
the ethyl ester form.20 The great majority of commercially
available omega-3 fatty acids are in the ethyl ester form,
whereas a limited number of omega-3 fish oils are converted
back to the more bioavailable triglyceride form. In this
study, we evaluated the efficacy of a re-esterified omega-3
fatty acid in its natural triglyceride form (PRN Dry Eye
Omega Benefits softgels; PRN Physician Recommended
Nutraceuticals; Plymouth Meeting, PA). This study was
designed to determine the effect of re-esterified omega-3
nutritional supplement versus placebo control over 12 weeks
on the tear film, ocular surface, patient symptoms, and
omega-3 blood levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a multicenter, prospective, interventional,
placebo-controlled, double-masked study. Subjects over 18
years of age were included in the study if they had
a previously confirmed diagnosis of DED. Subjects with
MGD stage 1 or 2, as defined by the Meibomian Gland
Workshop,3 were included. Subjects with more advanced
MGD and significant dropout of their meibomian glands
(stage 3) would not be expected to respond to the study
protocol and were therefore excluded from the study. The
second requirement was a tear osmolarity of 312 mOsm/L or
greater, in at least one eye using the TearLab Osmolarity
System (TearLab, San Diego, CA) on 2 separate visits
scheduled 1 week apart. Subjects were excluded from the
study if: they were using topical cyclosporine 0.05%, topical
corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glau-
coma medications, or oral omega-3 fatty acids within 3 weeks
of screening and anytime during their participation in the
study. Subjects were instructed to discontinue contact lenses
within 12 hours of any study visit. Subjects who underwent
LASIK or PRK surgery within 1 year of screening visit or
who were currently using a systemic medication that might
affect the ocular surface also were also excluded. Computer
use and artificial tears were allowed during the study. This
study was performed in compliance with the ethical principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and
was
approved by Western
Institutional
Review
Board
(Puyallup, WA).
Subjects were randomly assigned using a random
number-generated sequence to ingest 4 softgels daily with
meals containing a total of either 1680 mg of EPA/560 mg of
DHA re-esterified omega-3 group or 3136 mg linoleic acid
safflower oil as the control group for 12 weeks. Both active
and control softgels seemed identical and were supplied in
identical containers for masking purposes. Subjects were
instructed to follow their usual diet and to record daily study
softgel ingestion in a diary. Subjects were provided a daily
reminder by text/email/voicemail to take the study supple-
ments to encourage compliance. A window period of 67 days
was allowed for follow-up visits at week 6 and week 12. At
the end of the week 12/exit visit, the softgel containers and
subject logs were collected and remaining softgels counted as
a measure of compliance to treatment.
Tear osmolarity was measured on a 50-nL sample
collected from the inferior lateral meniscus at baseline and 6
and 12 weeks after treatment before any ocular examination
using the TearLab Osmolarity System. Tear osmolarity was
tested in both eyes, and the higher value from the 2 eyes
was recorded for analysis. In all cases, tear osmolarity was

 performed before any examination of the patient or the
application of eye drops. Subjects were instructed not to use
any artificial tears for at least 2 hours before testing. They
were also instructed to continue any over-the-counter habitual
artificial tears at the same frequency and were instructed not
to change the brand of drops being used. At baseline, 6 and 12
weeks posttreatment, slit-lamp examination included TBUT
after instillation of sodium fluorescein solution, MGD
assessment of the lid margin on a scale of 0 to 3 (0: normal;
1: mild stenosis +/or mild telangiectasia; 2: moderate stenosis
+/or telangiectasia involving less than half of lid margin no
notching; 3: Absolute stenosis +/or telangiectasia involving
more than half lid margin +/or notching). Corneal staining
was evaluated with fluorescein using Oxford staining scale
0 to5 (0: no staining, 5: severe staining). Symptoms were
assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)
questionnaire, and Schirmer test with anesthesia was per-
formed at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks posttreatment. Matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level was assessed using the
InflammaDry test (Rapid Pathogen Screening Inc, Sarasota,
FL) at baseline and at week 12. Omega index blood samples
were collected for omega-3 fatty acid profiling at baseline and
week 12.
All categorical variables were summarized by treatment
group with the frequency and percentage of subjects in each
category and the continuous variables summarized descrip-
tively with the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation,
and minimum, maximum, and median values. Repeated
measures analysis of variance model was used to compare
the treatment differences for tear osmolarity, omega index
variables, TBUT, OSDI, corneal staining, and MGD. The x2
test was used to assess the treatment differences for MMP-9-
positive enzyme biomarker categorical variable. All statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC).
P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 122 subjects were screened eligible for the
study. Seventeen subjects dropped out over the course of 12
weeks, 7 in the omega-3 group and 10 in the control group.
The mean age of 105 subjects who completed the study was
56.8 6 17.0 years. Of these, 54 (51%) (mean age: 57.0 6
16.8 yrs) were randomized to the omega-3 group and 51
(49%) (mean age: 56.5 6 17.3 yrs) to the control group. The
majority of subjects were female (n = 75) (71.4%) and the
remaining baseline characteristics were similar among groups
(Table 1).
The primary objective was to determine the effect of
re-esterified omega-3 fatty acids on tear osmolarity. Tear
osmolarity was similar at baseline in both omega-3 (326.2 6
15.8 mOsm/L) and control groups (326.0 6 15.4 mOsm/L,

 Table 2). At the 6-week follow-up, a significant reduction
from baseline was measured in tear film osmolarity in the
omega-3 group (216.8 6 2.6 mOsm/L) versus control group
(29.0 6 2.7 mOsm/L, P = 0.042), which further decreased
from baseline at 12 weeks in the omega-3 group (219.4 6
2.7 mOsm/L) versus control group (28.3 6 2.8 mOsm/L, P =
0.004) (Table 3, Fig. 1).
Secondary objectives assessed the effect of re-esterified
omega-3s on omega-3 index scores, TBUT, MMP-9, symp-
tom scores, corneal staining, Schirmer scores with anesthesia,
and MGD stage. At baseline, omega-3 index score was
slightly better in the control group versus the omega-3 group.
At the 12-week follow-up visit, there was a statistically
significant change (P , 0.001) in omega-3 index score in the
omega-3 group increasing by 3.0 from 4.2 6 1.0 to 7.2 6 2.7
at week 12; no significant change was measured in omega-3
index score in the control group from baseline (4.9 6 1.4 to
5.1 6 1.7) at week 12 (Tables 2 and 3).
TBUT showed a significant improvement during the
12 weeks in the omega-3 group. At 6 weeks, there was
a trend toward TBUT improvement in the omega-3 group,
which was not statistically significant (P = 0.126), but
the difference between the groups was significant at the
12-week visit (P = 0.002, Table 3 and Fig. 2). TBUT
increased from 4.8 6 3.0 seconds to 8.3 6 4.8 seconds,
a change from baseline of 3.5 6 0.5 seconds in the omega-3
group versus 4.6 6 2.0 seconds to 5.8 6 3.1 seconds,
a change from baseline of 1.2 6 0.5 seconds in the control
group (P = 0.002, Tables 2 and 3).
MMP-9 testing showed that the number of subjects with
positive MMP-9 in the omega-3 group decreased from 28
positive subjects to 9 subjects (67.9%) over 12 weeks
compared with a decrease from 20 subjects to 13 subjects
(35.0%) in the control group (P = 0.024) (Table 4). There was
no significant difference in the number of subjects testing
MMP-9 negative between the 2 groups.
Both groups had similar OSDI symptom scores at
baseline (Table 2 and Fig. 3). At 12 weeks, OSDI symptom
scores in the omega-3 group dropped from 32.4 6 19.2 to
15.5 6 11.0 versus 27.1 6 22.9 to 22.0 6 19.3 in the control
group (P = 0.002, Table 2 and 3). Both groups showed
a decrease in symptoms at 6 weeks, but this change between
the 2 groups was not significant (P = 0.285) at 6 weeks. The
mean corneal fluorescein staining grade (measured by Oxford
staining scale) at baseline was 1.2 6 1.2 for the omega-3
group versus 1.6 6 1.0 for the control group. Eighty-six of
105 subjects who completed the study had a staining grade
#2 at baseline. At 6 weeks follow-up, it decreased to 0.7 6
0.8 in the omega-3 group versus 1.1 6 1.0 in the placebo
group. It further decreased at week 12 to 0.6 6 0.7 in the
omega-3 group versus 1.0 6 1.0 in the placebo group (Table
2). No significant difference was measured in the change from
baseline for Schirmer score (P = 0.263 at week 6, P = 0.780 at
wk 12; omega-3 vs. control group) or MGD stage (P = 0.757

DISCUSSION
Oral supplementation with re-esterified omega-3 fatty
acids improved both signs and symptoms of dry eyes over
a 12-week period in this clinical trial. These results add to the
growing volume of data demonstrating a correlation between
omega-3 levels and dry eyes. One of the first studies to
demonstrate the importance of omega-3 fatty acid ingestion
on DED was the Harvard Women’s Study, which showed
a dose-dependent incidence of protection from dry eyes
associated with fish consumption.13 Several other studies
have shown an improvement in DED and a reduction in
inflammation with omega-3 fatty acid consumption.11,12,21
Rosenberg and Asbell analyzed published literature on DED
and omega-3 fatty acids and noted that a relationship between
dry eye and omega-3 fatty acids exists; however, strong
conclusions could not be made because of the limitations in
research reported.22
Tear Osmolarity
Tear osmolarity has been reported to be a global,
objective marker in both aqueous and evaporative DED and
may be the most sensitive diagnostic tool for evaluating DED.
Further, tear osmolarity has been shown to be significantly
correlated to the severity of DED and can effectively track
therapeutic response. A stable and normal osmolar tear film is
critical to preventing epithelial stress and ocular surface
damage.23–29 In the current study, no difference in tear
osmolarity was measured between the 2 groups at baseline.
The omega-3 treatment group had a significant decrease in
tear film hyperosmolarity at 6 weeks (P = 0.042) relative to
the control group. This decrease in tear hyperosmolarity was
greater at 12 weeks (P = 0.004) in the omega-3 group. The
significant reduction in osmolarity at 6 weeks preceded
improvement in ocular symptoms. In this study, there was
a nonsignificant improvement in tear osmolarity in the control
group. This improvement, although not nearly as large as the
improvement in the omega-3 group, may be because of the
safflower control group, which is an omega-6 form of
triglyceride, rich in linoleic and gamma-linolenic fatty acids.
Previous studies have shown that omega-6 supplementation
does improve dry eye signs and symptoms.30,31
Omega-3 Index
The omega-3 index measures the omega-3 level in the
plasma and was very similar in both groups at the beginning
of the study. The present study demonstrated a statistically
significant increase in omega-3 index levels in subjects taking
re-esterified omega-3 supplementation.
Tear Break-Up Time
There was a significant improvement in the TBUT
scores in the omega-3 group at 12 weeks compared with
control. This improvement suggests that dietary supplemen-
tation with a re-esterified formulation of omega-3 fatty acids
improves the inherent stability of the tear film. It is likely that
dietary supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids modifies the
composition of the meibomian gland secretions, improving
the quality of the meibum. We did not evaluate the character-
istics of the meibum in the present trial.
The reduction in tear osmolarity and improved TBUT
over the 12-week study period may have other benefits we did
not measure. An improved tear film quality and stability may
result in less visual fluctuation. Epitropoulos et al demon-
strated that hyperosmolar eyes have inconsistent keratometry
readings that can adversely impact intraocular lens selection
in cataract patients.32 Other studies have reported increased

 variability in higher order aberrations and light scattering in
DED compared with normal eyes.33–37
Matrix Metalloproteinase-9
The omega-3 group showed a significant reduction in
subjects testing positive for MMP-9 bioenzyme in the tear
film. MMP-9 is a proteolytic enzyme produced by stressed
epithelial cells on the ocular surface in DED.38 This enzyme is
elevated in mild, moderate, and severe cases of DED.39 The
omega-3 group experienced a 67.9% reduction in MMP-9
positivity in a 12-week period, whereas the control group
only experienced a decrease of 35.0% in the same time
period. This supports the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids
decrease the hyperosmotic stress on the ocular surface
epithelium
and
directly
reduce
inflammation
on
the
ocular surface.
Ocular Surface Disease Index
The improvement in the objective signs of DED
correlate with the symptoms evaluated on OSDI. The study
results show improvement in OSDI symptom scores by 17.0
6 2.6 points in the omega-3 group at 12 weeks compared
with the control group (P = 0.002), which is consistent with
other studies.14,17,19,40 The improved tear film quality and
decrease in inflammation could explain the improvement in
OSDI symptom scores in the treatment group. The improve-
ment in symptomatology was not significant at 6 weeks but
did become statistically significant at 12 weeks. The delay in
improvement in symptoms is expected, as symptoms take
longer to resolve than signs.
Corneal Staining, Schirmer Score, MGD Stage
Corneal staining decreased in both groups, but was not
statistically significant between the 2 groups. This could be
because of a staining grade of ,1.6 at baseline in each group
(Table 2) and 81.9% (86/105) of subjects having a staining
grade #2. This finding on corneal staining is consistent with
Schargus et al,41 who concluded that corneal staining is likely
a late-stage sign that is rarely overexpressed in mild to
moderate dry eye subjects. Although our findings showed no
effect on tear volume after dietary supplementation as
measured by Schirmer test with anesthesia and are consistent
with one study, others found slight improvements in Schirmer
scores but no symptomatic improvement.42–44 This reconfirms
the notion that the Schirmer test is highly variable and may
limit its role in DED evaluation.45 In the FDA trial of
cyclosporine for the treatment of DED, there was, however,
a significant improvement noted in Schirmer scores at
6 months.46 Our study showed no significant change in
MGD assessment; however, as shown in Table 2, there was
a trend toward more improvement. We believe that visual
changes in the meibomian glands may require longer follow-
up to see the effect on MGD staging.
In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrated
a significant improvement in dry eye signs and symptoms
from baseline with the oral ingestion of re-esterified omega-3
supplements for 12 weeks compared with those taking
a control. The improvement of many of the signs was seen
as early as 6 weeks, suggesting a rapid response to nutritional
therapy. The increased bioavailability of the triglyceride form
of omega-3 nutritional supplementation has been well
established. However, the use of a re-esterified omega-3 fatty
acid was not compared with the ethyl ester form of omega-3
fatty acids so the advantage of the increased bioavailability of
the re-esterified omega-3 form was not assessed. The
improvement in signs and symptoms for dry eyes as seen in
this study support the recommendation that dietary supple-
mentation of re-esterified omega-3 fatty acids should be
included as a primary therapy for dry eyes.
