systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of chronic
inflammatory conditions

Inflammatory cytokines are commonly elevated in acute depression and are associated with resistance to monoaminergic
treatment. To examine the potential role of cytokines in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression, we carried out a systematic
review and meta-analysis of antidepressant activity of anti-cytokine treatment using clinical trials of chronic inflammatory
conditions where depressive symptoms were measured as a secondary outcome. Systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE,
PsycINFO and Cochrane databases, search of reference lists and conference abstracts, followed by study selection process yielded
20 clinical trials. Random effect meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2370 participants showed a
significant antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine treatment compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.40,
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.22–0.59). Anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs were most commonly studied (five RCTs); SMD = 0.33
(95% CI; 0.06–0.60). Separate meta-analyses of two RCTs of adjunctive treatment with anti-cytokine therapy and eight non-
randomised and/or non-placebo studies yielded similar small-to-medium effect estimates favouring anti-cytokine therapy;
SMD = 0.19 (95% CI, 0.00–0.37) and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.34–0.67), respectively. Adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and tocilizumab all
showed statistically significant improvements in depressive symptoms. Meta-regression exploring predictors of response found that
the antidepressant effect was associated with baseline symptom severity (P = 0.018) but not with improvement in primary physical
illness, sex, age or study duration. The findings indicate a potentially causal role for cytokines in depression and that cytokine
modulators may be novel drugs for depression in chronically inflamed subjects. The field now requires RCTs of cytokine modulators
using depression as the primary outcome in subjects with high inflammation who are free of other physical illnesses.

INTRODUCTION
The association between the immune system and the brain may
offer new mechanistic understanding and insights for novel
therapies
for
depression.
Cytokine-mediated
communication
between the immune system and the brain has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of depression.1–3 Major depression is common
(one in four) after interferon treatment, a potent inducer of
cytokines, in patients affected by hepatitis C virus.4 Experimental
immuno-activation in healthy volunteers leads to depressive
symptoms and reduced cognitive performance.5,6 Meta-analyses
of cross-sectional studies confirm elevated levels of circulating
inflammatory cytokines in depressed patients,7–10 and long-
itudinal studies have demonstrated that elevated serum cytokine
levels precede, so potentially cause depressive symptoms.11,12 A
dose–response relationship between serum concentration of
interleukin 6 (IL-6) in childhood at 9 years and subsequent
depressive symptoms in early-adulthood at 18 years has been
reported in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
birth cohort.11 A longitudinal association between circulating
inflammatory markers and subsequent depressive symptoms has
also been reported from the Whitehall II cohort.12 Furthermore,
activation of the inflammatory system is thought to underlie
antidepressant resistance highlighting an involvement in treat-
ment response.13,14 Therefore, whether targeting inflammation,
particularly inflammatory cytokines, could provide therapeutic
benefit for patients with depression is a key question.
A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs)15 of non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), given as sole treat-
ment or as adjunct to antidepressants, indicates that they may be
more effective than placebo in treating depression (Cohen’s
d = 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08–0.45),16 although there
are limitations of individual studies included such as attrition.
Although these results point to an inflammatory component to
depression,
further
examination
of
the
evidence
regarding
cytokine-modulating drugs may help to elucidate the relevance
of inflammation for pathogenesis and treatment of depression
specifically. NSAIDs are broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents
that also act on other targets, such as glucocorticoid receptors.17
These
receptors
are,
themselves,
relevant
for
depression
pathophysiology,18 so the extent to which the antidepressant
effect of NSAIDs is due solely to anti-inflammatory action is
unclear.
Some
NSAIDs
such
as
cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitors
increase risk of cardiovascular disease,19 a known comorbidity
for depression, so their use in depression may be problematic.
Besides, many trials of anti-inflammatory drugs for depression are

 based on people with chronic physical illness16 but it is unclear
whether the improvement in depression is due to the improve-
ment in physical illness.
Cytokine modulators, which include monoclonal antibodies and
cytokine inhibitors, constitute a more pure anti-inflammatory class
because they target-specific cytokine pathways. Recently, a proof-
of-concept RCT of infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-α) specific monoclonal antibody, has reported improvements
in patients with treatment-resistant depression characterised by
high inflammation at baseline.20 Supported by a large number of
RCTs, cytokine modulators are well established treatments for
chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis21
and psoriasis.22 Many of these clinical trials have also reported on
secondary psychosocial outcome measures including depressive
symptoms, which could be utilised to address important questions
regarding potential usefulness of anti-cytokine treatment for
depression. In addition to quantifying the antidepressant effect of
anti-cytokine treatment, examination of the relationship between
the improvement in depressive symptoms and that in physical
symptoms could elucidate the role of inflammation in depression
specifically. Previous RCTs indicate baseline severity of depression
moderates the antidepressant effects of monoaminergic drugs23
and psychotherapy;24 it not clear whether this is also the case for
anti-cytokine treatment.
We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary
data from clinical trials of anti-cytokine treatment in chronic
inflammatory conditions to address the following key outstanding
questions: (1) does blocking-specific inflammatory cytokine path-
ways lead to improvement in depressive symptoms; (2) what is the
relationship between the antidepressant effect and the improve-
ment in physical illness; (3) is the antidepressant effect related to
baseline severity of depressive symptoms; (4) is there any sex or
age difference of the antidepressant effect. Answers to these
questions would provide important clues on whether inflamma-
tory cytokines have a causal role in depression, and whether
cytokine modulators may be useful for treating depression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy and study selection
A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane
databases was carried out for all clinical trials of cytokine modulators
involving human subjects published in the English language until 5th April
2016, where depression or depressive symptoms were reported as an
outcome. The search terms included indexing terms as well as wildcards to
maximise
return:
‘(monoclonal
antibod*
OR
cytokine
inhibitor
OR
tocilizumab OR infliximab OR adalimumab OR ustekinumab OR etanercept
OR dupilumab) AND (depression OR depressive symptom)’. We also
searched reference lists of retrieved articles and conference abstracts, and
wrote to key authors in the field for unpublished data.
Clinical trials of specific cytokine inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies
against
specific
inflammatory
cytokines
that
measured
depressive
symptoms using a recognised tool were included. In order to obtain a
comprehensive overview of the literature, we included all clinical trial
designs, that is, RCTs, double-blind or open-label, as well as non-
randomised studies (analysed separately). Studies that examined cytokine
modulators as an adjunct to interferon therapy, used monoclonal
antibodies as a method for detecting leukocyte subtypes, or examined
monoclonal antibodies against targets other than an inflammatory
cytokine (for example, vascular growth factor, adhesion molecule) were
excluded.25 The literature search and study selection were carried out by
NK and GMK; any differences were resolved by discussion.
Data extraction and statistical analysis
Data were extracted from published articles or obtained by directly
contacting the authors if relevant data were not reported. When authors
could not be reached but data were available in the paper in graph format
(two RCTs),26,27 values were extracted using software that has been shown
to be a reliable method of data extraction for meta-analyses.28 RCTs were
quality
assessed
using
the
CONSORT
criteria;29
scores
reflect
the
percentage of CONSORT items the study adhered to. We aligned
depression scales so higher scores reflect higher symptom severity by
multiplying scores from reversed scales by -1. For studies that included
multiple intervention arms based on different dosages of the same drug,
we pooled means and s.d.s of these groups to calculate a single outcome
measure. Here, the pooled s.d. (sdpooled) equalled the square root of
(sd1^2 × (n1 − 1)+sd2^2 × (n2 − 1))/((n1 − 1)+(n2 − 1)). Effect sizes were calcu-
lated as standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes
according to the formula (x
¯1 − x
¯2)/sdpooled. For binary outcomes odds ratios
were
created
according
to
the
formula
(Outcome1Group1 × Outco-
me2Group2)/(Outcome2Group1 × Outcome1Group2). Then odds ratios were
transformed to SMD by dividing the natural logarithm of the odds ratios by
1.81.30
Based on study methodology, three types of studies were combined
separately using random effect meta-analysis: RCTs of anti-cytokine drug
vs placebo; RCTs of adjunctive treatment with anti-cytokine therapy (anti-
cytokine drug plus active treatment vs active treatment); and other trials
(non-randomised and/or non-placebo studies). For RCTs effect estimates
were calculated as SMD using depression severity scores in treatment and
placebo groups at the end of trial. SMD is an appropriate measure of effect
estimate when studies assess the same variable (for example, depressive
symptoms) but measure it in a variety of ways.31 In addition, we calculated
SMD using change in depression severity score from baseline to end of trial
in each group to examine the robustness of original results (sensitivity
analysis). Sensitivity analyses were also carried out after excluding specific
RCTs from meta-analysis. For other trials, SMD was calculated as difference
in depression severity score from baseline to end of trial, as no control
group was present. All studies were weighted using an inverse-variance
method so studies with larger samples were given higher weight. When
possible, pooled effect estimates were calculated for specific drugs.
Heterogeneity between studies was investigated by calculating the
Cochrane’s heterogeneity statistic Q and the I2 statistic that represents
the fraction of variation between studies attributable to heterogeneity.32
Publication bias was assessed for each group of studies by visual
inspection of funnel plots including Egger’s test,33 and the trim and fill
method.34 We analysed the RCTs of adjunctive treatment with anti-
cytokine therapy separately because these studies compared combination
of anti-cytokine drug and a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug
(DMARD) with DMARD alone. One RCT35 administered adalimumab to all
participants for 4 weeks before randomising them to placebo or
adalimumab for subsequent 52 weeks, so we also included data from
the first 4 weeks in the meta-analysis of ‘other trials’. Data from two
studies36,37 that randomised individuals to different dosage regimens of
the same drug but lacked a placebo group, and a non-randomised study38
were also included in this category.
All secondary analyses were based on placebo-controlled RCTs only as
they represent the highest quality of scientific evidence of efficacy. Meta-
regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the
effect estimates for depression and (1) the effect estimates for primary
physical outcome; (2) baseline severity of depressive symptoms; (3) sex
(percentage of male participants in each sample); and (4) mean age of
sample. We quantified baseline depression symptom severity in a
standardised manner rather than simply using mean scores because the
studies used different scales to measure depression. We identified general
population distributions for each scale39–43 that were used to calculate
effect sizes (SMD) of baseline symptom severity for the sample compared
with the general population. All analyses were performed in R using the
metaphor package for meta-analysis and meta-regression;44 analysis codes
are available on request.
RESULTS
The literature search retrieved 350 potentially relevant articles of
which 20 studies were finally included in the review (see Figure 1
for a PRISMA diagram of literature search). Of the included studies,
seven were RCTs of anti-cytokine drug vs placebo, three were RCTs
of adjunctive treatment with anti-cytokine therapy, and 10 were
other study designs such as non-randomised and/or non-placebo
studies (Table 1).

 anti-cytokine drugs and 1061 subjects treated with placebo,
showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms with
anti-cytokine treatment compared to placebo; SMD = 0.40 (95% CI,
0.22–0.59) (Figure 2a). There was evidence of significant hetero-
geneity among studies (Po0.001; I2 = 73%). Anti-TNF drugs were
most commonly studied (five RCTs),20,26,27,35,46 which as a group
showed significant antidepressant effect; SMD = 0.33; 95% CI,
0.06–0.60 (Figure 3). There was also evidence of significant
heterogeneity among these studies (P = 0.02; I2 = 75%). Regarding
specific drugs, based on two trials each, the effect estimate for
adalimumab35,46 (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.05–0.72) and that for
etanercept26,27 (SMD = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.07–0.83) were similar
(Figure 2a). There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity
between the adalimumab trials (P = 0.134; I2 = 55%) but there was
evidence of heterogeneity among the etanercept trials (P = 0.05,
I2 = 73%).
Sensitivity analysis of seven RCTs,20,26,27,35,45–47 of anti-cytokine
drugs vs placebo based on change in depression severity scores
from baseline to end of trial yielded very similar results to that of
the original analysis; SMD = 0.37 (95% CI; 0.18–0.57) (see online
Supplementary Figure 1). However, evidence for heterogeneity
remained (Po0.001; I2 = 76%).
Meta-analysis of RCTs of adjunctive treatment with anti-cytokine
therapy
Of three trials48–50 that used anti-cytokine drugs as adjunctive
treatment,
two
provided
enough
data
for
meta-analysis
(Figure 2b).49,50 Both of these studies compared combination of
etanercept and a DMARD (n = 544) with DMARD alone (n = 405).
Meta-analysis showed a small effect of etanercept plus DMARD on
depressive symptoms compared with DMARD alone (SMD = 0.19;
95% CI, 0.00–0.37). There was no evidence of heterogeneity
between studies (P = 0.158; I2 = 49%).
Meta-analysis of other trials
Out of 10 non-randomised and/or non-placebo studies,36–38,51–57
eight provided enough data for meta-analysis involving 1744
patients with data at baseline and follow-up (Figure 2c).35,36,38,51–55
Meta-analysis of these studies suggested significant improvement
in depressive symptoms following anti-cytokine treatment (SMD=
0.51; 95% CI, 0.34–0.67). There was evidence of significant
heterogeneity among these studies (Po0.001; I2 = 73%). Anti-TNF
drugs were most commonly studied (six studies), which as a group
showed significant antidepressant effect (SMD= 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39–
0.77) (see online Supplementary Figure 2). However, there was
evidence
for
significant
heterogeneity
among
these
studies
(P = 0.002; I2 = 67%). Regarding specific drugs, adalimumab, inflix-
imab and tocilizumab all showed statistically significant improve-
ments in depressive symptoms. Meta-analytic effect estimates for
adalimumab: SMD = 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47–0.87); infliximab: SMD= 0.66
(95% CI, 0.14–1.18); and tocilizumab: SMD = 0.31 (95% CI, 0.20–0.42).
There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity in any of these
meta-analyses (all P40.05).
Association with improvement in physical illness
Meta-regression of six RCTs26,27,35,45–47 found no evidence for an
association between improvement in depressive symptoms and
that in primary physical illness outcome measure at the end of trial
(slope = 0.37; SE = 0.28; P = 0.182) (Figure 4). The study by Raison

 depression was the primary outcome so no physical illness was
studied.
Association with depression symptom severity at baseline
Meta-regression of seven RCTs20,26,27,35,45–47 showed an associa-
tion between antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine treatment and
baseline severity of depressive symptoms (slope = − 0.12; SE = 0.05;
P = 0.018). However, the association became non-significant after
excluding the RCT by Raison et al.20 (slope = − 0.05; SE = 0.12;
P = 0.662). We explored the association by excluding the RCT by
Raison et al.20 because baseline depression severity was much
higher in this study (SMD of baseline depression 6.36) compared
with the other RCTs (0.08–1.91).
Association with sex and age
There was no strong evidence for a sex difference in the
antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine treatment as the association
between improvements in depressive symptoms and the percentage
of male subjects in the sample, based on meta-regression of seven
RCTs,20,26,27,35,45–47 did not reach significance (slope =1.29; SE=0.66;
P=0.051). Re-analysis after excluding the study by Raison et al.,20 an
outlier in which only 33% of subjects were male, attenuated the
association further (slope=0.66; SE =0.71; P= 0.355). Similarly, there
was no association between SMD for depressive symptoms and
mean age of sample (slope =0.008; SE=0.028; P=0.788).
Association with study duration
Duration of follow-up in the RCTs of anti-cytokine drug vs placebo
was similar (12–16 weeks) except the study by Loftus et al.
(Table 1). Meta-regression of seven RCTs20,26,27,35,45–47 showed no
association between the antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine
treatment and study duration (slope = − 0.004; SE = 0.007; P = 0.52).
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analysis of RCTs20,35,45–47 excluding two studies by
Tyring et al.26,27 from which data were extracted using software
did not change results substantially; SMD = 0.37 (95% CI; 0.11–0.63)
(see online Supplementary Figure 3). However, evidence for
significant heterogeneity remained (P = 0.003; I2 = 79%). Unlike the
other RCTs, the trial by Raison et al.20 was based on cases of
treatment-resistant depression without any significant physical
comorbidity. Meta-analysis of RCTs26,27,35,45–47 excluding this trial
yielded a slightly larger effect estimate; SMD = 0.46 (95% CI; 0.30–
0.61) (see online Supplementary Figure 4). However, there was
evidence
for
significant
heterogeneity
among
these studies
(P = 0.016; I2 = 61%). The RCT by Loftus et al.35 was an outlier in
terms of follow-up length (see Table 1). Meta-analysis excluding this
RCT20,26,27,45–47 did not alter results greatly; SMD= 0.43 (95% CI;
0.21–0.65) (see online Supplementary Figure 5). However, evidence
for significant heterogeneity remained (P = 0.002; I2 = 76%).
Assessment of publication bias
Visual inspection of funnel plot of effect estimates from seven RCTs
suggested that there was no evidence of publication bias (see
online Supplementary Figure 6), which was in line with a non-
significant Egger’s test for funnel plot asymmetry (P40.05).
Similarly, trim and fill analyses did not show any evidence of
funnel plot asymmetry for RCTs. There were too few studies to allow
assessment of publication bias among RCTs of adjunctive treatment
with anti-cytokine therapy. For the other trials (non-randomised,
non-placebo) Egger’s test for funnel plot asymmetry (P40.05) and
visual inspection of the funnel plot did not suggest any evidence for
publication bias (see online Supplementary Figure 7). However, the
trim and fill method indicated presence of funnel plot asymmetry,
and that additional four studies would be needed to reach
symmetry leading to slight attenuation of effect size (trim and fill
SMD= 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18–0.55). It is known that the trim and fill
method
can
underestimate
effect
estimates
when
there
is
significant heterogeneity among studies;58 indeed, after restricting
the analysis to anti-TNF studies heterogeneity decreased and there
was no longer any evidence of funnel plot asymmetry (P = 0.50).

 that anti-cytokine treatment improves depressive symptoms.
We observed significant results favouring cytokine modulators over
respective control groups with effect estimates of 0.40 for RCTs of
anti-cytokine treatment vs placebo, 0.19 for RCTs of adjunctive
treatment with anti-cytokine therapy, and 0.51 for other (non-
randomised and/or non-placebo) studies. Regarding predictors of
response, additional analyses based on RCTs indicated that the
antidepressant effect was associated with severity of depressive
symptoms at baseline, but not with improvement in physical illness
(primary outcome under investigation in all but one RCT), sex and
age of participants, or study duration. Sensitivity analyses using a
different method to calculate SMD or exclusion of specific RCTs did
not alter results substantially suggesting that the findings are
robust. The results provide important clues regarding the role of
inflammatory cytokines in depression and the potential for cytokine
modulators as treatments for depression. Anti-cytokine drugs seem
to offer treatment effects in the range of small-to-moderate effect
sizes, which is comparable to estimates observed for common
antidepressants.23 The results are in line with a previous meta-
analysis of NSAIDs, which included three RCTs of cytokine
inhibitors.16 The results are also consistent with a recent meta-
analysis of anti-TNF treatment in people with chronic physical
illness that reported improvements in depression and anxiety
symptoms.59 However, based on a meta-analysis of seven RCTs the
current study provides a robust, statistically significant effect
estimate favouring anti-cytokine treatment for depression. In
addition to the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trials (gold standard), we have examined RCTs of adjunctive
treatment with anti-cytokine therapy, and non-randomised studies
offering a comprehensive update of the literature.
Studies included in this review except one by Raison et al.20
report continuous measures of depression, that is, symptom
severity scores, not a categorical diagnosis of depression. To
calculate effect size we have used depression severity scores for
treatment and placebo groups at the end of trial for all RCTs
including one by Raison et al. We also used change in depression
scores from baseline to end of trial. The lack of an association
between the improvement in depressive symptoms and that in
primary physical illness points to a causal role for inflammatory
cytokines in depression, suggesting that the mood improvement
is not simply an artefact of feeling physically better after anti-
cytokine treatment. Examination of the time course of effect in
individual studies may provide some clues regarding the under-
lying mechanism of antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine treat-
ment. The RCT by Tyring et al.27 reported scores for fatigue and
depression
during
the
course
of
12-week
treatment
with
etanercept vs placebo for psoriasis. Compared with placebo,
etanercept led to improvements in fatigue by 2 weeks into the
study and in depressive symptoms by week 4. In this study
improvement in depressive symptoms was associated with
improvement in fatigue but not (strongly) with improvement in
psoriasis, which is in line with our meta-regression finding.
Neurovegetative symptoms such as fatigue, which develop rapidly
following immune activation in humans are attributed to actions
of inflammatory cytokines on the brain.60,61 Therefore, it is
possible that the antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine treatment
is mediated by improvements in cytokine-induced neurovegeta-
tive symptoms. This hypothesis needs testing in future studies.
In future, RCTs of anti-cytokine treatment using depression as
the primary outcome in subjects with high inflammation who are
free of other physical illnesses are needed. Although further
studies are currently underway (for example, NCT02363738 and
NCT02473289), results from the RCT by Raison et al.20 included in
this meta-analysis showed beneficial effects of infliximab for
treatment-resistant depression cases only in those with elevated
serum CRP levels at baseline. Treatment-resistant depression cases
with elevated inflammatory marker levels may be ideal candidates
for RCTs of cytokine modulators for a number of reasons. About a
third of all depressed patients are antidepressant resistant62 and
about a third of all depressed patients have elevated serum CRP
(43 mg l − 1).63 This may not be a coincidence. Indeed, activation
of the inflammatory system as reflected by elevated serum
inflammatory marker concentrations predicts poor antidepressant
response,13,14 and treatment-resistant patients continue to show
elevated
cytokine
levels.64,65
Inflammation
and
consequent
activation of the tryptophan-metabolising enzyme indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase is thought to underlie persistent symptoms
despite antidepressant therapy in depressed patients who are
‘inflamed’.66 Inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ, TNF-α
and IL-6 can induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.67,68 In mice,
blocking TNF-α with etanercept67 or IL-6 with a monoclonal
antibody69
have
been
reported
to
prevent
depression-like
behaviour following exposures to an inflammatory stimulus or
stress. Therefore, cytokine-modulating therapy is likely to be
beneficial for a subset of depressed patients, specifically those
with evidence of inflammation.

 Regarding specific types of studies, meta-analysis of two RCTs of
anti-cytokine drugs as adjuncts to DMARD treatment showed a
smaller effect size than that of the placebo-controlled randomised
trials, which might be due to potential antidepressant effects of
drugs used as comparison treatment. On the other hand, the
pooled effect size for the non-randomised and/or non-placebo
studies was larger than that for RCTs probably because of the lack
of a comparison group to account for placebo effect. The
association between baseline severity of depressive symptoms
and response to anti-cytokine treatment was markedly reduced
after excluding an outlier although an association between initial
severity and antidepressant response is well known.23 This is
possibly because depression severity was relatively low in all of
the RCTs except the one by Raison et al.,20 which included cases of
treatment-resistant depression. It is well known that baseline
symptom severity is positively correlated with antidepressant
treatment effect, so demonstration of a beneficial effect of anti-
cytokine treatment in samples with relatively low depression
scores indicates strong antidepressant properties of these drugs.
There was no evidence for an association between antidepressant
effect of cytokine modulators and sex or age of participants.
Similar to depression, autoimmune chronic inflammatory condi-
tions such as rheumatoid arthritis are more common in women
than men (3:1),70 but sex does not influence response to anti-TNF
therapy in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis,71 which
is in line with our findings. A possible explanation for the lack of
an association with age could be limited variability in age among
the included studies (o10 years).
Strengths of the systematic review presented here include a
relatively large number of studies including RCTs, which were
quality assessed. The literature search was comprehensive, as
supported by a lack of evidence for publication bias for most
analyses. Inclusion of different trial methodologies allowed meta-
analyses of two types of RCTs and non-randomised studies. The
focus on a specific type of anti-inflammatory drug (that is,
cytokine modulators) helped to demonstrate the relevance of
inflammation, particularly inflammatory cytokines, for the patho-
genesis and treatment of depression. A potential limitation is the
use of data extracted from published graphs due to lack of
response from authors of two studies.26,27 However, the software
used to extract data has been reported to be a reliable method for
data extraction for meta-analysis,28 so any variation from original
data would be too small to have any meaningful impact on the
pooled effect estimate. Because a physical illness was the primary
outcome in all but one studies included in this review, we were
not able to comment on potential side-effects of cytokine-
modulating
treatment
in
depressed
individuals
specifically.
Administration of monoclonal antibodies carries the risk of
immune reactions such as acute anaphylaxis as well as various
target-specific adverse effects including increased risk of infec-
tions, cancer and autoimmune disease.72 Infliximab and placebo
groups in the study by Raison et al.20 were similar in terms of
adverse events (except increased urinary leukocyte esterase in the
placebo group) and no serious side-effects were observed in
either group. Nevertheless, further studies regarding safety and
tolerability of cytokine modulators in depressed individuals are
needed. There was evidence for significant heterogeneity in the
meta-analysis of RCTs and that of other trials. Heterogeneity is
likely to be driven by heterogeneity of effect size because all
studies included in these analyses except one showed effect in the
same direction, that is, anti-cytokine treatment improves depres-
sive symptoms (see Figures 2a and c). Heterogeneity was reduced
when studies were grouped by specific monoclonal antibodies.
For example, there was no evidence of heterogeneity among
studies of adalimumab, infliximab and tocilizumab. However,
sensitivity analyses after excluding specific RCTs did not reduce
heterogeneity significantly.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provides
an up-to-date summary of the existing literature on antidepres-
sant effect of anti-cytokine treatment. The findings show robust
improvements in depressive symptoms after anti-cytokine therapy
(monoclonal antibody or cytokine inhibitor) with a small-to-
moderate size effect. These results suggest inflammatory cyto-
kines may have a key role in the pathogenesis of depression and
that anti-cytokine drugs may be effective for some patients with
depression, particularly treatment-resistant cases characterised by
increased inflammation. The field now needs RCTs of anti-cytokine
treatment using such patients, which would pave the way for
novel, effective and personalised treatment for depression and
could reduce the burden presented by such a serious and
multifactorial illness.
