Investigating the associations between
productive housework activities, sleep
hours and self-reported health among
elderly men and women in western
industrialised countries

Abstract
Background: After retirement, elderly men and women allocate more time to housework activities, compared to
working-age adults. Nonetheless, sleep constitutes the lengthiest time use activity among the elderly, but there has
not been any study on the associations between time spent on housework activities, sleep duration and self-
reported health among the older population. This study not only examined individual associations between self-
reported health and both housework activities and sleep duration, but it also explored self-reported health by the
interaction effect between housework activities and sleep duration separately for men and women.
Methods: Pooled data from the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) on 15,333 men and 20,907 women from
Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US were analysed. Multiple binary logistic regression
models were used to examine the associations between three broad categories of housework activities ((1) cooking,
cleaning and shopping, (2) gardening and maintenance; (3) childcare) and health. We further investigated the
extent to which total housework hours and sleep duration were associated with self-reported health for men and
women separately.
Results: We found a positive association between time devoted to housework activities, total housework and health
status among elderly men and women. Compared to those who spent 1 to 3 h on total productive housework, elderly
people who spent >3 to 6 h/day had higher odds of reporting good health (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.14–1.37 among men
and OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.01–1.20 among women). Both short (<7 h) and long (>8 h) sleep duration were negatively
associated with health for both genders. However, the interactive associations between total productive housework,
sleep duration, and self-reported health varied among men and women. Among women, long hours of housework
combined with either short or long sleep was negatively associated with health.
Conclusions: Although time allocation to housework activities may be beneficial to the health among both genders,
elderly women have higher odds of reporting poor health when more time is devoted total housework combined
with either short or long sleep duration.

 Background
Due to the increase in life expectancy among older
adults, time spent in retirement has increased remark-
ably [1]. In fact, the retirement of an individual affects
the distribution of allocated time to the various task of
life. A plethora of literature has examined how elderly
men and women spend their time after retirement. Most
of the related literature that examined post-retirement
time use showed that elderly men and women are more
involved in social roles and activities such as voluntary
work [2–4], leisure activities [5, 6], grandparenting [7, 8]
and household activities [6, 9], than their younger coun-
terparts [9–11].
Household activities are part of the daily lives of older
people. These activities have become their main “pro-
ductive work” after retirement [12]. Using longitudinal
data, Szinovacz [13] found that retirees devoted more
time to housework activities than their working spouses.
However, evidence suggests that gender inequality in the
division of household labor largely persists in high-
income societies even after retirement [13, 14]. Most
studies confirm that elderly women spend more time on
housework activities than men [14–16], although time
allocated to housework activities among men has in-
creased over recent years [15]. Again, women typically
perform routine, repetitive tasks such washing clothes,
cooking and cleaning house [17, 18], while men are re-
sponsible for occasional tasks such as household repair
works, vehicle maintenance and yard work [17, 18]. It
has been suggested that this inequitable division of
housework is one of the factors that contribute to the
observed adverse health differences among men and
women including psychological distress [19] and depres-
sive symptoms [20]. These adverse health outcomes are
stronger for women than men in their prime working
age [21]. Thus, gendered work-life imbalance could be a
contributing factor for health inequalities, where women
are more likely than men to report poorer health [19].
Although the gendered distribution of housework seems
to be correlated with low psychological well-being and
poor health among women, there is some evidence that
suggests housework may have a positive impact on phys-
ical health among elderly men and women [14, 22].
Nonetheless, an important aspect of daily time use ac-
tivities among older men and women is sleep. Sleep is
one of the most important determinants of health [23].
Thus, the duration and quality of sleep have significant
health consequences for children, adults and the elderly.
Among the elderly, sleep constitutes the lengthiest daily
activity [24]. This is expected because the increasing
prevalence of health conditions at older age restricts
time allocation for other daily activities [6]. Time de-
voted to sleep is therefore crucial because it has been
shown to be correlated with health among older adults.
Among adults, short sleep has been found to be associ-
ated with some adverse health outcomes including car-
diovascular disease and obesity [25]. Conversely, long
sleep duration has been linked with increased risk of
mortality and morbidity [23].
Time resources are limited within 24 h or 1440 min in
a day. Therefore, within this period, time devoted to a
particular activity influences time allocation to other
daily activities. For example, more time allocation to
housework may decrease the amount of time devoted to
sleep or other time use activities such as leisure.
To our knowledge, only one study has examined the
effect of various housework activities on health among
older adults [26]. Moreover, the gender-specific inter-
active effects of time spent on housework and sleep dur-
ation on self-reported health have yet to be investigated
among the elderly. Accordingly, this study seeks to ex-
plore the relationship between housework activities, total
housework and sleep on self-reported health among the
elderly in high-income countries. The following two
questions will be addressed:
1) How does time spent on housework activities impact
the health among the elderly? To what extent do
these effects vary by gender?
2) To what extent is the association between housework
activities and health moderated by sleep hours among
men and women?
Methods
Data
Data came from the Multinational Time Use Study
(MTUS, version W53), a cross-national harmonized and
comparative time-use database. The Centre for Time
Use Research at the University of Oxford organized and
collated this data, which was a collection of national
randomly-sampled time-use surveys conducted by institu-
tions in 25 countries [27]. This data set contains informa-
tion on time allocation to various daily tasks, as well as
socio-economic and demographic background information
of the respective diarist. Diaries were self-administered,
followed by a personal visit in most countries. In the inter-
views, individual participants reported the total time spent
per day on 41 activities in 5, 10 or 15-min intervals [27],
during a randomly assigned day in a week in Spain, Italy,
Germany France and the US or two days (weekday and
weekend) in the UK. In the Netherlands, individuals report
their activities throughout the 24 h of the day for seven
consecutive days. We excluded individuals whose diaries
did not sum up to 1440 min (24 h) of activities during the
day. Only primary or “main” activities were included in this
analysis. Information on secondary activities (activities
done while multitasking) were not captured. After consid-
ering the minimum retirement age in most EU countries.,

 we limited our sample to individuals who were 65 years
and above. For the selection of countries, we selected
countries that incorporate health and wellbeing measures
into their diary collections. The countries used for the final
analysis after these exclusions were the United Kingdom
(survey year: 2000; response rate: 45%), the United States
(survey year: 2003, response rate: 57%), Spain (survey year:
2002; response rate: 64%), Italy (survey year: 2002; response
rate: 92%), Germany (survey year: 2001; response rate:
96%), France (survey year: 1998, response rate: 88%) and
the Netherlands (survey year: 2000; response rate: 25%).
Independent variables
Time spent on housework activities and sleep were the
two independent variables used for this study. Sleep time
and time allocated to housework activities were directly
estimated from the data. Because it is not easy to iden-
tify productive household activities in time use research,
we used the “third party” criterion to identify and select
these activities. This approach is widely used in the lit-
erature in defining productive household activities [28].
By this criterion, “if an activity is of such a character that
might be delegated to a paid worker, then that activity shall
be deemed productive” [29]. In other words, this comprises
housework that people can pay others to perform for them.
Hence, activities such as cooking, gardening, washing,
maintenance, laundry, grocery shopping and childcare
were considered as productive housework activities. In this
current study, we focused on three broad categories of
housework activities, in line with Wen et al. [26]:
� cooking, cleaning and shopping
� gardening and maintenance
� childcare
Each category of time use activity was measured in mi-
nutes per day. Total housework hours were measured in
hours per day. Sleep hours or duration was defined as
the total amount of time devoted to sleep. This encom-
passes all forms of sleep (including daytime sleep and
naps). Sleep hours were classified into three categories,
i.e., <7 h (short sleep duration), 7–8 h (optimal sleep
duration), and >8 h (long sleep duration), based on exist-
ing cut-offs in epidemiologic studies [30].
Dependent variable
The dependent variable was self-reported health. In the
time-use survey, the question posed to the diarist was
“How is your health in general; would you say that it
is …?” response options: zero (poor) to three (very
good). We categorized the responses into poor (poor
or fair) and good (good or very good) [14]. Self-
reported health has been shown to be a reliable and
accurate measure of current health status [31, 32].
Covariates
Covariates included in the analyses were age, education
(less than secondary education, completed secondary
education and above secondary education), housing ten-
ure (owner-occupier, renting), employment status (not
working for pay, currently in paid employment), house-
hold size (1, 2, 3+) and car ownership (no car, one car
and two or more cars).
Statistical analysis
The first part of the analysis was primarily descriptive,
where information on distributional characteristics of all
variables including the mean time allocated to the vari-
ous productive housework activities was provided. In the
second part of the analysis, we applied binary logistic re-
gression to model the association between self-reported
health and each of the three broad housework categor-
ies, total housework and sleep hours. The multivariate
regression models included other time use activities
(paid work, active leisure, passive leisure and personal ac-
tivities, see Additional file 1: Table S2). In the third part,
we examined the combined association of total productive
housework hours and sleep duration (short sleep duration,
optimal sleep duration and long sleep duration) on self-
reported health. Here, we investigated twelve combinations
as follows: four groups of total productive housework
hours (housework <1 h/day, housework 1 to 3 h/day,
housework >3 to 6 h/day, housework >6 h/day) × three
groups of sleep hours (sleep <7 h/day, sleep >7 to 8 h/day,
sleep >8 h/day). The >7 to 8 h/day sleep duration and 1 to
3 h/day time spent on productive housework categories
were chosen as the reference. The analyses were done sep-
arately for men and women. All statistical analyses were
performed in STATA version 14 [33].
Results
Descriptive statistics
The descriptive statistics for respondents stratified by
gender are shown in Table 1.
Women in the study were slightly older than men.
The mean age of women was 73.2 years and for men
72.4 years. Men had higher educational attainment than
women. About 20.3% of elderly men and 13.3% of
women reported having a tertiary education. Elderly
men were more likely to own a house than women
(77.5% vs 73.2%). Regarding employment status, about
9.0% of older men were in paid employment, compared
to 4.7% of women. The average number of people in the
household was similar for both men and women (ap-
proximately 2 members).
Gender differences were also found in time allocation to
productive housework activities. Older men and women
both allocated more time to cleaning and cooking
than to occasional task such as gardening and maintenance.

 However, men spent remarkably fewer hours on cleaning,
cooking and shopping than women (88.7 min/day vs
217.9 min/day). On the other hand, women devoted fewer
hours on gardening and maintenance than men (38.5 min/
day vs 68.6 min/day). Regarding the time allocation to total
housework, women devoted most hours to these activities
(4.7 h per day) compared to men (3.1 h per day). A cross-
country comparison in Additional file 2: Table S1 revealed
that the most time spent on total housework among elderly
women was found in Italy (5.2 h per day) and Germany
(5.1 h per day), while the lowest value was observed in the
US (4.0 h per day). In contrast, elderly men in Italy devoted
the least time to total housework activities (2.7 h per day),
while the most time spent on these activities was found in
Germany (4.2 h per day).
Time allocated to sleep hours was similar in both gen-
ders. Elderly men and women slept for approximately
9 h per day (including daytime sleep and naps).
Again, we observed that there were no differences in
time devoted to sleep hours among men and women
within-countries, but there were cross-national variations
(Additional file 2: Table S1). For instance, elderly men and
women in Spain and France devoted the most time to
sleep hours (approximately 10 h per day), while the
average time spent on these activities in the other
countries was 1 h less.
Logistic regression
The results of the adjusted OR and 95% CI for the asso-
ciation between the three broad productive housework
activities, total housework, sleep hours and the outcome
self-reported health are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Among men and women, we found a positive associ-
ation between housework activities and self-reported
health. However, there were differences in the magnitude
of the associations. Time devoted to both routine and
repetitive housework activities was significantly associ-
ated with good health. We observed that elderly people
who spent more than 120 min/day on cleaning, cooking
and shopping activities had higher odds of reporting

 good health (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.43–1.74 among men
and OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.30–1.68 among women) com-
pared to those who devoted no time to these activities.
Gardening and maintenance activities were associated
with higher odds for good health. Older people who spent
more than 120 min/day on these activities were more
likely to report good health (OR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.64–
1.98 among men and OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.41–1.73
among women) compared to those who did not allocate
any time to these activities. The odds of reporting
good health were significantly higher (OR = 1.81; 95%
CI = 1.03–3.20 among men and OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.63–
3.72 among women) for elderly people who spent more
than 120 min/day on childcare activities compared to
those who devoted no time to childcare.
Furthermore, Table 3 shows that total productive
housework activities and sleep duration were also related
to health in both genders. In the model, we found a sta-
tistically significant association between good health and
time devoted to housework. Elderly people who spent
more than 6 h on housework activities had higher odds
of reporting good health (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.65–2.11
among men and OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.24–1.53 among
women) compared to those who spent 1 to 3 h on these
activities. The odds of reporting good health status were
lower among older people who devoted less than 7 h
(OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.71–0.97 among men and OR =
0.84; 95% CI = 0.73–0.95 among women) and more than
8 h (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.71–0.85 among men and OR =
0.75; 95% CI = 0.69–0.81 among women) compared to
those who reported a sleep duration between 7 to 8 h.
Interactions
Table 4 and Fig. 1a and b shows the combined associa-
tions of total housework hours and sleep duration on
self-reported health by gender.
Among both genders, any combination of sleep duration
not equal to 7–8 h and less than one hour spent on total
housework was significantly associated with poorer health.
On the other hand, the odds of reporting good health
were significantly higher among older men who devoted
more than 6 h/day of housework with any sleep hours cat-
egory as compared to the reference group. Conversely, the
odds of reporting good health were significantly lower
among elderly women with any combination of sleep
hours category with more hours of housework as com-
pared to the reference group defined as above.
Discussion
This study explored the individual association between
housework activities, sleep duration and self-reported
health, and additionally examined the combined associa-
tions of total housework and sleep duration on self-
reported health among elderly men and women in selected

 high-income countries. As far as we know, this is the first
study to analyze these interactive associations among eld-
erly men and women in six European countries and the US
using time use data. On the descriptive level, our study
showed that elderly women allocate more time to routine
and repetitive housework such as cleaning and cooking,
whereas elderly men tend to devote more time to occa-
sional tasks such as gardening and maintenance. Interest-
ingly, both routine and occasional housework activities
were positively associated with health among elderly men
and women, but the magnitude of the association varied.
Regarding time spent on total housework activities, there
were gender and cross-country differences. Women spent
more time than men in housework activities, consistent
with previous literature [11, 12]. However, we observed a
cross-country variation in time devoted to these activities.
The result as shown in Additional file 2: Table S1 revealed
that elderly women in the southern European countries
and Germany allocated most time to total housework
activities. In contrast, men’s total housework activities
were about 2 h per day less than that of women in
the southern European countries. Meanwhile, the difference

 in housework among older men and women was approxi-
mately 1 h per day in Germany. Gender differences in the
allocation of time especially for housework may to some ex-
tent be explained by cultural and social norms [34]. These
norms may shape total work distribution and time use pat-
terns of the various task of life among men and women.
For instance, in the southern European countries where
gender roles are still shaped in a more traditional way [34],
women devote a significant amount of time to housework
activities while the amount of time devoted to other time
use activities may be reduced.
Housework activities, sleep hours and health
Although gender inequality in time allocation to house-
work activities exists [15, 16], we found that time devoted
to the three broad categories of housework activities were
positively associated with health among elderly women
and men. Our findings of the association between routine
housework activities (cleaning, cooking and shopping) and
health contrast with a recent study conducted in China.
Wen et al. [26] found no significant association of cook-
ing, cleaning and grocery shopping and health among
older men, but washing clothes and house cleaning were
negatively associated with health among women. Mean-
while, our results corroborate a longitudinal study of 2761
older Americans aged 65 years [35]. Glass et al. [35] found
productive housework activities such as cooking, shopping
and gardening to be associated with lower risk of mortal-
ity. To these effects, we note that the three broad categor-
ies of housework activities involve some form of physical
activities which may be beneficial to health among older
adults [36]. Gardening and maintenance activities may
increase fitness level and muscle strength because they re-
quire some form of physical exertion such as carrying
equipment for repair works, lawn mowing, shoveling, dig-
ging holes and carrying soil. Previous studies have also
stressed the health benefits of gardening for older adults;
such benefits include physical health, psychological health,
cognitive ability, and low risk of depression [37, 38]. Park
et al. [39] recently reported that gardening has a positive
effect on the blood lipid profiles, blood pressure and level
of inflammatory markers in blood.
We also found a positive association between childcare
and health status among older people. Although the
amount of time devoted to childcare activities among
the elderly is very small compared to young adults [6],
caregiving support, especially caring for grandchildren,
has been linked with good psychosocial health [40, 41].
Ku et al. [41] found that grandparenting was positively
associated with good self-reported health and lower risk
of depression. However, in some instances, more time
devoted to childcare among older adults may have a
negative impact on their physical or mental health [42],
especially among custodial grandparents [43, 44].
Regarding time devoted to total housework hours, the
result showed a positive association with health status
among both genders. The few studies that examined the
effects of total time spent on housework and health
among elderly men have given inconsistent results [26, 35,
45, 46]. Lawlor et al. [46] reported that heavy housework
was not associated with reduced likelihood of being over-
weight among British women aged 60 to 79 years.
Among the working population, unequal division of
household labor has been linked with adverse health
outcomes especially among women [19, 21]. One main
hypothesis that has been advanced to explain these
gender-specific inequalities in health is the “double bur-
den” of work hypothesis. It has been postulated that the
combination of paid market work and domestic work
may be more stressful for women than men [47], which
may affect women’s health negatively [19, 48]. Research
findings [6, 34] indicate that the patterns and distribu-
tion of time use vary largely among the elderly and the
working population. Therefore, the elderly may not have
the same time constraints of combining both paid work
and household activities like the working-age adults. In
this case, the “double burden” of work hypothesis might
lose its premise in explaining the effect of total house-
work on health among elderly men and women. In our
view, housework activities by the older population can
be perceived as domestic leisure activities [12] and forms
of domestic physical activities [38] rather than “work
overload”, given a changed time availability after retire-
ment. Hence, there is overall evidence for a positive as-
sociation between housework activities and health status
among elderly men and women.
Regarding sleep duration and self-reported health, we
found a U-shaped association where both short (<7 h) and
long (>8 h) sleep duration were negatively associated with
self-reported health for both genders, consistent with prior
findings [49–52]. The magnitude of the association was
greater for long in comparison with short sleep duration.
No significant difference in sleep duration was found be-
tween men and women within-countries, but there were
cross-national variations (Additional file 2: Table S1). Cur-
rently, it is unclear whether older men or older women ac-
tually sleep longer on average [53–55]. Nevertheless, both
elderly men and women allocate more time to sleep than
any other time use activity [6, 24]. This time use pattern is
expected among older individuals due to the increasing in-
cidence of adverse health conditions [6]. Conversely, both
short and long sleep duration have been found to be asso-
ciated with adverse health outcomes including diabetes
mellitus [55, 56] obesity [57, 58], osteoporosis [59] and
hypertension [60]. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that
both short and long sleep duration are associated with
increased mortality rates [23, 61]. Considering gender, a
cohort study by Ikehara et al. [62] showed a U-shaped
Adjei and Brand BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:110 
Page 7 of 10
 association between sleep duration and all-cause mortality
for both men and women. Even though our data does not
permit examining the association with mortality, previous
studies have consistently shown a strong relationship be-
tween self-reported health and mortality [63, 64].
While the assessment of gender differences in housework
and sleep duration with health status was informative, our
study further examined the combined associations, as they
provide information about a potentially important inter-
active gender effect. The results showed that the interactive
associations between housework, sleep duration and self-
reported health vary by gender. Among men, the combin-
ation of longest housework hours with either short or long
sleep duration yielded a strong positive association with
self-reported health. On the contrary, a combination of
longest housework hours with either short or long sleep
duration yielded a negative association on self-reported
health among women. The result suggests that regardless
of sleep duration, less housework was associated with poor
health status among both genders.
There is no prior evidence of the combined association
of sleep duration and time devoted to housework on
health status. Nonetheless, Kiosses and Alexopoulos [65]
found that older adults who report higher levels of de-
pression devote less time to housework and other instru-
mental activities of daily living (IADL) such as shopping
and meal preparation. This negative association can be
explained by little or no physical or mental energy asso-
ciated with less housework, as physical inactivity has
been found to play a significant role in the development
of chronic diseases [66]. As discussed above, short and
long sleep durations have also been linked to poor health
[55, 56], therefore our findings of the combined effects
may be attributed to the negative correlations between
less housework, poor sleep and health. Regarding long
housework hours and sleep duration, we observed a dif-
ferent pattern among both genders (Fig. 1a and b). For
men, long hours of housework was associated with good
health status regardless of sleep duration, whereas these
very long hours of housework combined with either
short or long sleep was negatively associated with health
among women. In fact, these patterns suggest that long
housework hours is less sensitive to elderly men’s health
[67] since the impact of long housework and health sta-
tus appeared to be least influenced by sleep duration.
Limitations and strengths
Our study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional
design of the study prevents conclusions about causality
because the association between sleep duration, house-
work hours and self-reported health may be reciprocal.
Second, this study relied on subjective measures to as-
sess duration of sleep, housework and health. However,
time use estimates of daily activities have been found to
be more accurate and reliable in time use surveys than
survey estimates [68, 69]. Notwithstanding, we acknow-
ledge that sleep disturbance [70], may impinge on sleep
quality and duration [71], but sleep quality cannot be
assessed with time use surveys [24]. Thus, future research
should explore objective and sophisticated time use data
collection technologies such as smart-phone apps and
actigraphy. Third, due to data availability and constrains,
we used diary data of time use surveys that have been col-
lected at different points in time with different modes of
data collection in the chosen countries, but evaluation
studies suggest that these differences do not affect the
comparability of the data [11]. Despite these limitations,
this current study provides an initial overview of house-
work activities, sleep duration and their correlations with
self-reported health of the population aged 65+ years
using a large-scale, homogeneous and comparative set of
time use data in Europe as well as the US.
Conclusions
We provide the first evidence of the associations be-
tween housework activities, sleep duration and self-
reported health among older individuals in selected
high-income countries. Our findings suggest that house-
work activities remain strongly gendered even after re-
tirement. Our findings further suggest that even though
time allocation to housework activities may be beneficial
to the health among elderly men and women, women
have higher odds of reporting poor health when more
time is devoted total housework combined with either
short or long sleep duration.
