Numerous clinical conditions can lead to organ fibrosis and functional failure. There is a great need for
therapies that could effectively target pathophysiological pathways involved in fibrosis. GPR40 and
GPR84 are G proteinecoupled receptors with free fatty acid ligands and are associated with metabolic
and inflammatory disorders. Although GPR40 and GPR84 are involved in diverse physiological processes,
no evidence has demonstrated the relevance of GPR40 and GPR84 in fibrosis pathways. Using PBI-4050
(3-pentylbenzeneacetic acid sodium salt), a synthetic analog of a medium-chain fatty acid that displays
agonist and antagonist ligand affinity toward GPR40 and GPR84, respectively, we uncovered an anti-
fibrotic pathway involving these receptors. In experiments using Gpr40- and Gpr84-knockout mice in
models of kidney fibrosis (unilateral ureteral obstruction, long-term post-acute ischemic injury, and
adenine-induced chronic kidney disease), we found that GPR40 is protective and GPR84 is deleterious in
these diseases. Moreover, through binding to GPR40 and GPR84, PBI-4050 significantly attenuated
fibrosis in many injury contexts, as evidenced by the antifibrotic activity observed in kidney, liver,
heart, lung, pancreas, and skin fibrosis models. Therefore, GPR40 and GPR84 may represent promising
molecular targets in fibrosis pathways. We conclude that PBI-4050 is a first-in-class compound that
may be effective for managing inflammatory and fibrosis-related diseases. (Am J Pathol 2018, 188:

Fibrosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of
extracellular matrix in damaged or inflamed tissues, and it is
the common pathological outcome of many inflammatory
and metabolic diseases. Numerous clinical conditions can
lead to organ fibrosis and functional failure; in many disor-
ders, acute or persistent inflammation is crucial to trigger the
fibrotic response. The production of various profibrotic cy-
tokines and growth factors by innate inflammatory cells re-
sults in the recruitment and activation of extracellular
matrixeproducing myofibroblasts.1 There is currently a
great need for therapies that could effectively target patho-
physiological pathways involved in fibrosis.

 many
diseases,
playing
protective
or
harmful
roles
depending on the context. Besides their effects on intra-
cellular metabolism and nuclear receptors, studies in the
past 15 years have shown that FFAs can activate several
cell surface G proteinecoupled receptors, including FFA
receptor 1 (GPR40) and GPR84. GPR40 and GPR84 show
distinct characteristics in both fatty acid binding and bio-
logical effects. GPR40 is activated by both medium-chain
FFAs (eg, decanoic acid) and long-chain FFAs (eg, lino-
leic acid)2,3 and is coupled to Gq or Gi/o proteins.3 GPR84
is responsive to medium-chain FFAs only and activates
almost exclusively pertussis toxinesensitive Gi/o signaling
pathways.4 In addition, GPR40 and GPR84 exhibit distinct
tissue distribution profiles. GPR40 is abundantly expressed
in pancreatic b cells, where it enhances glucose-mediated
insulin secretion.3 Accordingly, several GPR40 agonists
have advanced to clinical trials for type 2 diabetes.5
However, the actions of GPR40 may not be limited to
insulin secretion. GPR40 is also expressed in enter-
oendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract and may
mediate release of glucagon-like peptide-1 and cholecys-
tokinin secretion.6,7 In addition, GPR40 is expressed in
murine skin and may serve to limit and attenuate inflam-
mation.8 Recent studies have also involved GPR40 in
regulation of pain perception9 and sensing taste of fatty
acids.10 Finally, GPR40 has been shown to be expressed in
the rat kidney11 and in a subset of murine kidney tubules,
including the cortical collecting duct.12 Moreover, in
human renal proximal tubule epithelial HK-2 cells, acti-
vation of GPR40 with the synthetic agonist GW9508
reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis.11
Studies of human and mouse GPR84, as ascertained by
mRNA levels in various tissues, have determined that
GPR84 is highly expressed on bone marrow cells, splenic T
and B cells,13 and circulating granulocytes/monocytes/
macrophages.4 In the latter cells, mRNA expression of
GPR84 is up-regulated only under inflammatory conditions.
GPR84 is also expressed in brain, heart, muscle, colon,
thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, intestine, placenta, lung, and
leukocytes.4,14 GPR84 may be a mediator of the relationship
between obesity and diabetes. Indeed, as adipocytes release
fatty acids in the presence of macrophages, increased
GPR84 expression and stimulation prevent the release of
regulating hormones/adiponectin.15 GPR84 is expressed in
the gastric corpus mucosa, and this receptor can be an
important luminal sensor of food intake; it is most likely
expressed on enteroendocrine cells, where it stimulates the
release of peptide hormones, including incretins glucagon-
like peptides 1 and 2.16,17
Although both receptors have been associated with
metabolic regulation and inflammation, they have not been
previously linked to organ fibrosis. In this study, we
demonstrate that PBI-4050, a synthetic ligand of GPR40
and GPR84, acts on cells involved in the fibrotic pathway:
macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. Moreover,
PBI-4050 reduces fibrosis in animal models of kidney, lung,
heart, liver, pancreas, and skin fibrosis. We also demonstrate
that both receptors are modulated in models of fibrotic
diseases and show that mice with a deletion in Gpr40 have
increased renal interstitial fibrosis in response to ischemia,
unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and adenine-induced
nephropathy models, whereas Gpr84 knockout mice have
reduced kidney fibrosis in a model of adenine-induced
nephropathy.
Materials and Methods
Compound
PBI-4050, a first-in-class compound synthesized by Prom-
etic BioSciences Inc. (Laval, QC, Canada) from a family of
low-molecular-weight orally active new molecular entities,
is an analog of medium-chain fatty acids. This lead drug
candidate was prepared in five steps using modified Sono-
gashira coupling, as follows: 3-bromophenylacetic acid was
converted to the corresponding ester and then reacted with
palladium catalyst under Sonogashira condition to give the
pentyne derivative. This compound was reduced over
palladium, hydrolyzed to the acid, and treated with a base to
yield the expected product PBI-4050.
Cell Culture and Transfections
Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) from adult
donors (Clonetics, East Rutherford, NJ) were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
HK-2 human epithelial proximal tubule cells (HK-2; ATCC,
Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Ea-
gle’s medium/F12 medium with 10% FBS. NHDF and HK-
2 cells were starved overnight in medium with 0.5%
(NHDF) or 0.2% (HK-2) FBS and treated with or without
recombinant human transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1
(10
ng/mL;
R&D
Systems,
Minneapolis,
MN)
and
PBI-4050 for 24 hours. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were
isolated
as
previously
described.18
Briefly,
6-
to
8-weekeold BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 1 mL of 3% Brewer thioglycollate medium. After 4
days, mice were euthanized and peritoneal exudate cells
were recovered in 10 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline.
The cells were centrifuged, resuspended in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium/F12 medium þ 10% FBS, and
seeded in a cell culture plate. Macrophages were allowed to
adhere for 2 hours in a cell incubator, after which non-
adherent B and T cells were removed by gently washing
three times with warm phosphate-buffered saline. Mouse
peritoneal macrophages were pretreated for 30 minutes with
PBI-4050 or vehicle before activation. Classically activated
(M1) macrophages were obtained by priming with recom-
binant mouse interferon-g (10 ng/mL; Fisher Scientific,
Ottawa, ON, Canada) for 18 hours and adding lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) 055:B5 (50 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Oak-
ville, ON, Canada) for an additional 6 hours, whereas

 alternatively activated (M2) macrophages were generated by
treating with recombinant mouse IL-4 (10 ng/mL; R&D
Systems) for 24 hours. Human podocytes were obtained as
previously described.19 Briefly, conditionally immortalized
podocytes were allowed to proliferate at 33�C in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum,
1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 U/mL of interferon-g
(permissive conditions). Cells were passaged, counted, and
seeded in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2%
newborn calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at a
density of 1 � 105 cells per 10-cm dish and were ther-
moshifted to 37�C to allow for terminal differentiation 10 to
14 days later. After overnight serum starvation (0.1%
newborn calf serum), podocytes were treated for 24 hours
with 50 ng/mL LPS or 10 ng/mL TGF-b1, with or without a
30-minute
preincubation

plemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% FBS (Wisent),
and 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich). Tran-

were obtained from the cDNA Resource Center (http://

C-terminus of GPR40. Rluc821 gBlocks fragment was
inserted with linkers in the coding sequence of Gai2, Gaq,
and
Ga13,
as

previously.22
All

BRET Measurement
Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in
96-well white clear bottom Costar microplates (Fisher Sci-
entific) coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and left
in culture for 24 hours. Cells were washed once with
Tyrode’s buffer (140 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 2.7
mmol/L KCl, 0.49 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.37 mmol/L NaH2PO4,
5.6 mmol/L glucose, 12 mmol/L NaHCO3, and 25 mmol/L
HEPES, pH 7.5) and the Rluc8 substrate coelenterazine
400A (Prolume, Lakeside, AZ) added at a final concentra-
tion of 5 mmol/L in Tyrode’s buffer. Ligands were incubated
with cells at room temperature for 8 minutes (G protein) or
15 minutes (b-arrestin) before reading bioluminescence
resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal. BRET readings
were collected using an Infinite M1000 microplate reader
(Tecan, Morrisville, NC). BRET2 readings between Rluc8
and GFP10 were collected by sequential integration of the
signals detected in the 370 to 450 nm (Rluc8) and 510 to
540 nm (GFP10) windows. The BRET signal was calculated
as the ratio of light emitted by acceptor (GFP10) over the
light emitted by donor (Rluc8). The values were corrected to
net BRET by subtracting the background BRET signal
obtained in cells transfected with Rluc8 constructs alone.
For the b-arrestin assays, ligand-promoted net BRET values
were calculated by subtracting vehicle-induced net BRET
from ligand-induced net BRET. For the G protein activation
biosensor assays, ligand-promoted net BRET values were
calculated by first subtracting vehicle-induced net BRET
from ligand-induced net BRET (DBRET), and then sub-
tracting the DBRET values obtained in cells cotransfected
with pcDNA3 from the DBRET values obtained in cells
cotransfected with GPR40 or GPR84 receptors.
Western Blot Analysis
HEK293-GPR40,
HEK293-GPR84,
and
untransfected
HEK293 cells were treated with ligands for 7 minutes. Lysed
cell extracts were separated by standard SDS-PAGE tech-
niques and immunoblotted with antiephosphorylated extra-
cellular signaleregulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Chemiluminescence
was revealed with a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad,
Mississauga, ON, Canada), and densitometric analyses of
Western blot were performed using ImageLab version 5.2.1
(Bio-Rad). Phospho-ERK1/2 signal was normalized on total
protein lane (MemCode protein stain kit; Fisher Scientific).
qPCR
RNA was extracted from cultured cells and homogenized
tissue using the Qiagen RNEasy minikit or TRIzol reagent
(Fisher Scientific) and treated with TURBO-DNA free
DNase
(Fisher
Scientific),
as
per
manufacturer’s
in-
structions. Extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using
GoScript Reverse Transcriptase or the High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Fisher Scientific) with 500 to
1000 ng starting material per reaction. Real-time quantita-
tive PCR was performed on an AB-7900HT real-time cycler
using TaqMan gene expression assays (Fisher Scientific), or
for podocytes using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection
System with SYBR Advantage qPCR Premix (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA). qPCR data were analyzed using the
DDCt method, using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase as normalization control.
In Situ Hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed to localize GPR40

Hayward,
CA).
Briefly,
paraffin-embedded kidney sections were cut at 4 mm, air
dried overnight, baked at 60�C for 1 hour, dewaxed, and air
dried before pretreatments. Standard pretreatment protocol
was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-
scope probes for GPR40 (Mm-Ffar1-O1; catalog number
464311) and GPR84 (Mm-Gpr84-O1-C2; catalog number
447031) were used. Detection of probe binding was
performed using the RNAscope Detection Kit based on
horseradish peroxidaseebased Green and alkaline phos-
phatase (diaminobenzidine)ebased Fast Red chromogens
for GPR40 and GPR84, respectively.
Microdissected Mouse Tubule Preparations
Three-montheold wild-type (WT; healthy) C57BL/6 mice
were anesthetized under isoflurane, and the left kidney was
quickly removed and placed in ice-cold sterile phosphate-
buffered saline (pH 7.4). Three or four coronal slices (1 to 2
mm thick) were placed into chilled (4�C) dissection medium
(105 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L NaHCO3, 10 mmol/L
C2H3NaO2, 2.3 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1.8
mmol/L CaCl2,1 mmol/L MgSO4, 8.3 mmol/L glucose, and
5 mmol/L alanine; osmolality, 300 mOsm/kg H2O) for

microdissection
with
forceps.
Microdissected
proximal tubules, thick ascending limb, and cortical col-
lecting duct slices (1.0 to 2.2 mm thick) were transferred to
RNAqueous-Micro Total RNA Isolation solution or stored
at �80�C until required. RNA from microdissected kidney
tubular segments was isolated using the Ambion RNAqu-
eous microkit (Fisher Scientific).
Gpr40 and Gpr84 KO Mice
The Gpr40-targeted knockout (KO) mice (a gift from Dr.
Stephen Wank, NIH, Bethesda, MD) used in the UUO and
ischemia-reperfusion models were developed, as previously
described,7 by replacing the Gpr40 coding region (except for
the first 51 nucleotides) with a DNA fragment that included a
hemagglutinin antigen, enhanced GFP, and neomycin genes.
Gpr40�/� and Gpr84�/� mice used in the adenine-induced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) model were generated by Del-
tagen (San Mateo, CA) by replacing 152 (Gpr40) or 257
(Gpr84) bp of genomic DNA within the receptor coding region
with a mutant Neo (Gpr40) or Lac0-SA-IRES-lacZ-WT Neo/
Kan (Gpr84) cassette. The KO mice were backcrossed for at
least five generations against a C57BL/6N genetic back-
ground, and WT littermates onthe same backgroundwere used
as controls in the experiments.
Adenine-Induced CKD Mouse Model
The impact of both PBI-4050 treatment and GPR40 or
GPR84
receptor
deletion
on
the
progression
of
tubulointerstitial injury was determined using the previously
described23 adenine-induced mouse model of CKD. WT
C57BL/6 (Charles River, Saint-Constant, QC, Canada),
Gpr40�/�, or Gpr84�/� mice were fed either a standard
rodent chow (Teklad 2018) or a diet supplemented with
0.25% adenine (Envigo, Madison, WI) for 4 weeks ad
libitum. After 1 week of adenine administration, mice were
given either vehicle (water) or PBI-4050 (200 mg/kg per
day) by gastric gavage for 3 weeks. In separate studies,
Gpr40�/� or Gpr84�/� mice or WT littermates were sub-
jected to 4 weeks of standard or adenine-supplemented diet,
as described earlier in this section. Kidney sections were
stained with Masson’s trichrome for histologic evaluation of
tubulointerstitial fibrosis and cystic lesions scores.
5/6-Nx Rat Model of CKD
Six-weekeold Sprague-Dawley male rats were subjected to
5/6 nephrectomy (5/6-Nx) or sham operations. Under
ketamine anesthesia (60 to 100 mg/kg, i.p.), two-thirds of
the left kidney was removed on day 0, followed by the right
total nephrectomy on day 7. Sham-operated rats underwent
exposition of the kidneys and removal of the perirenal fat
and were used as controls. Animals that underwent the sham
operation were treated with vehicle (water) and used as
controls. On day 21, rats were allocated on the basis of
glomerular filtration rate results. 5/6-Nx animals were
divided into two groups (n Z 8). One group received
vehicle, and the other group was treated with once-daily oral
administration of PBI-4050 (200 mg/kg), by gavage. Ani-
mals were treated from day 21 to 189 and sacrificed on day
190. Animals that died before day 190 were not used in the
results analysis. Tissue sections of the kidney were prepared
and stained with Masson’s trichrome for the evaluation of
glomerular and tubular lesions and collagen deposition.
Serum and urinary (24-hour) creatinine were measured to
determine creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate),
and serum blood pressure was determined by tail-cuff
method.
Doxorubicin Mouse Model of Nephropathy
Nephrotoxicity was induced by i.v. injection of doxorubicin
(doxorubicin; Novopharm, Mirabel, QC, Canada; 10 mg/kg)
on day 0 in BALB/c male mice (6 to 10 weeks of age).
Vehicle (water) or PBI-4050 (200 mg/kg per day) was
administered from day �3 to �1 and day 1 to day 10
(histology) or 13 (qPCR), and mice were sacrificed on the
following day. Kidneys were prepared for histologic
assessment of glomerular and tubular lesions with hema-
toxylin and eosin staining.
Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Model
Male 8-weekeold WT and Gpr40�/� mice on a mixed
C56BL/6/129 background were used. The mice were
Role of GPR40 and GPR84 in Fibrosis

1135
 subjected to contralateral nephrectomy, followed by 29
minutes of unilateral clamping of the renal pedicle to reduce
variability of results. These animals were sacrificed after 3
weeks, and kidney sections were stained with picrosirius red
for histologic quantification of fibrosis.
UUO Fibrotic Model
Male 8-weekeold WT and Gpr40�/� mice on a mixed
C56BL/6/129 background were used for these studies. The
mice were subjected to the left ureter ligation for 4 days and
then sacrificed for analysis. Kidney sections were stained
with picrosirius red for histologic quantification of fibrosis.
Carbon TetrachlorideeInduced Liver Fibrosis
Liver fibrosis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by i.p.
administration of 2 mL/kg of CCl4 (10% in olive oil, twice a
week for 58 days, time that corresponds to the fibrotic
phase). Mice were treated with vehicle (water) or PBI-4050
at 200 mg/kg from day 1 to day 58 and euthanized at day
59. Liver was prepared for histologic assessment of fibrosis
with Masson’s trichrome staining.
Suprarenal Abdominal Aorta Constriction Model
Suprarenal abdominal aorta constriction was performed on
adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (9 to 11 weeks old; Charles
River), using a 21-gauge needle, as previously described.24
Suprarenal abdominal aorta constriction leads to concentric
hypertrophy and the secondary development of interstitial
fibrosis.24 Sham and suprarenal aorta constricted rats were
randomly allocated and treated with vehicle (water) or
PBI-4050 (200 mg/kg per day, oral gavage) from day 14 to
day 28. On day 28, heart was excised and processed for
histologic assessment of interstitial fibrosis with Masson’s
trichrome staining, as previously described.24
Bleomycin-Induced Mouse Model of Pulmonary Fibrosis
Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (0.025 U per mouse;
Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was performed in C57BL/6
10-weekeold female mice (Charles River). Mice were
allocated according to their bleomycin-induced body weight
loss on day 7, and animals were treated with PBI-4050 (200
mg/kg per day) or vehicle (water) from day 7 to day 20 via
gastric gavage. On day 21, lungs were prepared for histo-
logic assessment of lesions (disrupted lung architecture,
thickness of alveolar wall, and fibrosis) with Masson’s
trichrome staining.
Fibrillin 1eMutant Mouse Model of Systemic
Scleroderma
B6.Cg-Fbn1Tsk/J breeders were purchased from The Jack-
son Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Both male and female
heterozygotes were treated with vehicle (water) or PBI-4050
at 5 weeks of age (200 mg/kg per day, oral administration).
The mice were sacrificed at 15 weeks of age (10 weeks of
treatment). Before euthanasia, the back hair was shaved and
a square or a rectangle on the back was marked, then the
marked skin was removed, weighed, and stained with
picrosirius red.
db/db eNOS�/� Mouse Model of Diabetic Kidney
Disease
db/db eNOS�/� male mice (16 weeks old; n Z 21) were
randomized into two groups. Both groups were treated
starting at 16 weeks of age and continuing until 30 weeks of
age. One group was treated with PBI-4050 (100 mg/kg per
day), and one group received vehicle (water). Mice were
euthanized at 30 weeks of age, when pancreatic fibrosis is
well established. Tissue sections of the pancreas were pre-
pared for histologic assessment (picrosirius red staining).
Histologic Image Analysis
Renal and pulmonary injury was assessed in a blinded
manner by a trained pathologist (A.G.). On the basis of the
distinctive density and color of staining in digital images,
the area of collagen in the tissue was quantified using
Image-Pro Premier 9.1 for Masson’s trichrome and with the
BIOQUANT true-color Windows system (R & M Bio-
metrics, Nashville, TN) for picrosirius red. Sections from at
least four regions of each organ were analyzed, and the
average was used as data from one animal sample.
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as means � SEM for each treatment
compared with control. For each independent experiment
treatment, values were expressed as a percentage or fold
difference of controls, and statistical analysis was then
performed on the data from different experiments. Statistical
analysis was performed using either one-way analysis of
variance with Tukey’s or Dunnett’s post test for multiple
comparisons or t-test (two tailed) when comparing two
groups (P < 0.05 was taken as significant). Nonlinear fit
analysis was used for dose-response curves. All data were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7 for Windows
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA).
Study Approval
All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the
animal care and use committee of the National Institute of
Scientific Research, INRS-Institut-Armand-Frappier Center
(Laval, QC, Canada), Vanderbilt University (Nashville,
TN), Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Ottawa, ON,
Canada), or Montreal Heart Institute (Montreal, QC,
Canada).

recruitment
to
GFP10-tagged GPR40 in living HEK293 cells was, there-
fore, used to assess GPR40 activation. PBI-4050 and
sodium decanoate both concentration-dependently promoted
b-arrestin 2 recruitment to GPR40 (pEC50: 2.98 � 0.12 and
3.56 � 0.08 mol/L, respectively) (Figure 1B). GPR40 has
been described as coupling mainly to the Ga protein subunit
of the Gq family,2,30 and partially to Gi.30e32 Hence, a
previously described22,33 BRET biosensor was used to
directly monitor GPR40-mediated activation of Ga in
living HEK293 cells. The Ga biosensor consists of an
Rluc8-tagged Gaq or Gai2 subunit, a GFP10-tagged Gg1
subunit, and an untagged Gb1. Agonist stimulation and
receptor activation trigger a physical separation between the
Rluc8-Ga donor and the GFP10-Gg1 acceptor, resulting in a
decrease in BRET signal, whose amplitude is correlated to
ligand efficacy.33 Treatment with increasing concentrations
of either PBI-4050 or sodium decanoate resulted in a BRET
signal decrease for both biosensors, indicative of Gaq
(pEC50: 3.54 � 0.16 and 3.99 � 0.43 mol/L, respectively)
(Figure 1C) and Gai (pEC50: 4.53 � 0.18 and 4.79 � 0.25
mol/L, respectively) (Figure 1D) activation. It was also
verified if PBI-4050 could trigger GPR40-mediated activa-
tion of G13 or Gs; both PBI-4050 and sodium decanoate had
no effect on the BRET signal of Ga13 activation biosensor
(Supplemental Figure S1A), nor did they induce cAMP
production
(Gas
pathway)
in
CHO-K1-GPR40
cells
(Supplemental Figure S1B). GPR40 activation can also
result in ERK1/2 phosphorylation.34,35 Stimulation of
HEK293-GPR40 cells with PBI-4050 increased ERK1/2
phosphorylation, but to a lesser extent than sodium dec-
anoate at equivalent concentrations (Figure 1E). This
increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was specific to GPR40
activation, because it was absent in untransfected HEK293
cells (Figure 1F).
PBI-4050 Inhibits GPR84 Signaling
GPR84 has been reported to couple primarily to the
pertussis toxinesensitive Gai/o family of G proteins,4,36
which decrease intracellular cAMP levels. HEK293 cells
cotransfected with GPR84 and the Gai activation BRET
biosensor were used to monitor the effect of PBI-4050 on

 this signaling pathway. Stimulation of HEK293 cells with
increasing concentrations of sodium decanoate or the
GPR84 agonist embelin26 resulted in a concentration-
dependent BRET signal decrease, indicative of Gi activa-
tion (Figure 2A) (pEC50 � SEM sodium decanoate:
4.83 � 0.17 mol/L; embelin: 5.01 � 0.09 mol/L). The so-
dium decanoateeinduced Gi activation was blocked in cells
pretreated with pertussis toxin and was absent in cells in
which empty vector was cotransfected in place of GPR84
(Figure 2B), demonstrating that the measured BRET
decrease specifically reflected GPR84-mediated activation
of Gai2. PBI-4050 treatment did not induce Gai activation
(Figure 2, A and B); however, cotreatment of sodium
decanoateestimulated cells with increasing concentrations
of PBI-4050 led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of
Gai activation (pIC50 � SEM: 3.40 � 0.06 mol/L)
(Figure 2C). A similar inhibition of Gai activation by PBI-
4050 was also observed in cells stimulated with embelin
(pIC50 � SEM: 3.68 � 0.28 mol/L) (Figure 2D). Although
GPR84 has not been reported to couple to other families of
Ga, it was verified if PBI-4050, sodium decanoate, or
embelin could activate these signaling pathways. The three
tested compounds neither had any effect on the BRET signal
of Gaq (Supplemental Figure S2A) or Ga13 (Supplemental
Figure S2B) activation biosensors in GPR84-transfected
cells, nor did they induce cAMP production in CHO-
K1-GPR84 cells (Gas pathway) (Supplemental Figure S2C).
GPR84 has been shown to activate the ERK1/2 pathway.36
Indeed, stimulation of HEK293-GPR84 cells with sodium
decanoate or embelin led to ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 2E). In contrast, treatment with PBI-4050 decreased
the basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation level. In accordance with
results obtained with the Gai activation biosensor, cotreat-
ment of cells with PBI-4050 together with either sodium
decanoate or embelin resulted in a significant reduction of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by these agonists, further
confirming that PBI-4050 can inhibit GPR84-mediated
signal transduction. In contrast, in untransfected HEK293
cells, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not induced by GPR84
agonist sodium decanoate or embelin (Figure 1F). However,
a slight reduction of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation was
observed after PBI-4050 treatment in these cells.

 both receptors and the effect of PBI-4050 was evaluated
using cells stimulated under inflammatory (LPS) or fibrotic
(TGF-b) conditions. In NHDFs expressing only GPR84,
GPR84 mRNA levels increased significantly under fibrotic
conditions (Figure 3A). Moreover, stimulation of NHDFs
with TGF-b led to a strong increase in the expression of
a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA; myofibroblast marker) as
well as profibrotic (connective tissue growth factor) and
fibrotic (collagen I) markers, which were all significantly
and concentration-dependently reduced by PBI-4050 treat-
ment. In human epithelial proximal tubule cells (HK-2)
expressing only GPR40, GPR40 mRNA levels were

 down-regulated (3.6-fold) under fibrotic conditions; in
these
cells,
PBI-4050
also
significantly
inhibited the
TGF-beinduced overexpression of collagen I (Figure 3B).
In addition, peritoneal mouse macrophages showed both
GPR40 and GPR84 expression. Activation of these macro-
phages to a classic, or M1 phenotype, with interferon-g and
LPS led to a robust increase (254-fold) of GPR84 expres-
sion and a significant reduction of GPR40 expression
(2.5-fold).
This
strong
up-regulation
of
GPR84
was
accompanied by a significant increase in the expression of
the proinflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1, IL-6, and IL-12(p40), all of which were down-
regulated in the presence of PBI-4050 (Figure 3C). Inter-
estingly, both receptor expression levels were not modulated
by activation of macrophages to an alternative, or M2
phenotype, with IL-4; however, mRNA expression of
resistin-like molecule (RELM)a (Retnla), a macrophage
alternative activation marker that has also been shown to
promote the differentiation and survival of myofibroblasts,37
was increased (124-fold) by IL-4 stimulation, and signifi-
cantly down-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner
with PBI-4050 (Figure 3D). Finally, our results confirmed
that LPS and TGF-b induced GPR84 expression in cultured
human podocytes (Figure 3E), a critical cell type in main-
taining the kidney’s glomerular filtration barrier integrity.
LPS stimulation in podocytes was accompanied with an
increase in IL6 and IL8 mRNA expression and profibrotic
and inflammatory biomarkers, which were down-regulated
by treatment with PBI-4050.
Expression of GPR40 and GPR84 in Kidney Fibrosis
To elucidate further the involvement of both GPR40 and
GPR84 receptors in the fibrotic process, several renal
disease models associated with glomerular and/or tubu-
lointerstitial fibrosis were studied. Interestingly, although
the expression profile of GPR40 and GPR84 has not been
completely described in the kidney, GPR40 is expressed in
epithelial cells of the proximal tubule11,12 and the cortical
collecting duct in microdissected mouse tubule prepara-
tions (Figure 4A), whereas it is not detected in other
segments, including the thick ascending limb. Our results
have also confirmed GPR40 and GPR84 expression in
various kidney disease models. Indeed, GPR84 mRNA
levels increased in 5/6-Nx remnant kidney (Figure 4B),
doxorubicin-induced
nephropathy
(Figure
4C),
and

basal GPR40 expression is relatively unaltered in healthy
kidneys and in several CKD models, it was up-regulated in
models involving direct renal epithelial cell injury [ie,
doxorubicin (Figure 4E) and adenine injury models
(Figure 4F)]. Furthermore, in situ hybridization showed
low-level renal expression of GPR40 and GPR84 in

PBI-4050 Reduces Kidney Fibrosis and Lesions in Renal
Disease Rodent Models
The effect of PBI-4050 on kidney fibrosis and lesions in the
aforementioned renal disease models was next studied. In the
5/6-Nx CKD/chronic renal failure model, 5/6-Nx rats showed
severe histologic renal lesions (interstitial fibrosis and
inflammation,
tubular
dilation,
and
glomerulosclerosis),
which were reduced by PBI-4050 treatment (Figure 5, A

 5/6-Nx animals compared with vehicle control. Furthermore,
doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity, a mouse model of acute
kidney injury, resulted in glomerulosclerosis, intratubular
casts, and tubular dilation, which were collectively reduced
by PBI-4050 (Figure 5, C and D). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis
and cystic lesions were also reduced by PBI-4050 in the
adenine-induced mouse model of CKD (Figure 5, E and F).
In summary, and in accordance with GPR40 and GPR84
receptor expression data, treatment with PBI-4050 reduced
fibrosis and kidney lesions in 5/6 nephrectomy, doxorubicin-
induced nephropathy, and adenine-associated nephropathy
models.
A Protective Role for GPR40 and a Deleterious Role for
GPR84 in Renal Fibrosis
To elucidate the role of GPR40 in renal fibrosis, UUO,
long-term post-acute ischemic injury, and adenine-induced
nephropathy models were used in WT and Gpr40�/�
mice. Fibrosis in these models was quantitated using
picrosirius red (UUO, ischemic injury) or Masson’s tri-
chrome (adenine) histochemistry. Histologic examination
of the kidneys revealed that Gpr40�/� mice displayed
increased fibrosis after injury in all three models. Indeed,
4 days after ureteral ligation, Gpr40�/� mice showed a

 2.8-fold increase in interstitial fibrosis compared with WT
mice, for which only moderate collagen deposition was
observed (Figure 6, A and B). Likewise, a 4.2-fold in-
crease of fibrosis in Gpr40�/� mice was observed as a
long-term
(21-day)
response
to
severe
acute
renal
ischemic injury (Figure 6, C and D). Finally, adenine-
induced nephropathy also resulted in increased fibrosis
(but
unchanged
cystic
lesions)
in
Gpr40�/�
mice
compared with WT mice (Figure 6, E and F). Collec-
tively, these studies are indicative of a protective role in
renal fibrosis for GPR40.
To validate the role of GPR84 in fibrosis, the adenine-
induced CKD mouse model was used. Histologic exam-
ination of the kidneys revealed that Gpr84�/� mice
showed significantly reduced (by half) adenine-induced
interstitial
fibrosis
and
cyst
formation
(Figure
7),
uncovering
a
detrimental
role
of
GPR84
in
renal
nephropathy.
To further establish the link between the antifibrotic
effects of PBI-4050 and the role of GPR40 and GPR84 in
fibrosis, adenine-fed Gpr40�/� and Gpr84�/� mice were
treated with PBI-4050 or vehicle. Treatment of Gpr40�/�
mice with PBI-4050 resulted in only a slight decrease (13%)
of fibrosis compared with vehicle, whereas in Gpr84�/�
mice PBI-4050 significantly reduced fibrosis (by 36%)
(Figure 8). Interestingly, the combined reduction of fibrosis
induced by PBI-4050 in both knockouts was equivalent to
the 50% reduction of fibrosis induced by PBI-4050 in the
WT adenine-fed mice (Figure 5F). In contrast, cystic lesions
were not affected by PBI-4050 treatment in the Gpr84�/�
mice, but trended to be lower in the Gpr40�/� mice
compared with vehicle. These results suggest an effect of
PBI-4050 treatment predominantly via GPR40 for tubu-
lointerstitial fibrosis reduction and mostly through GPR84
for decreased cystic lesions in the adenine-induced CKD
model.
Effect of PBI-4050 on Multiple Organ Tissue Fibrosis
To evaluate the capacity of PBI-4050 to attenuate tissue
fibrosis in other organs, multiple animal models were used.
PBI-4050 significantly reduced liver fibrosis induced by
carbon
tetrachloride
hepatotoxicity
(31%
reduction)
(Figure 9, A and B). In addition, the level of aspartate
aminotransferase (a marker of liver damage) was increased
by carbon tetrachloride and significantly reduced by PBI-
4050 (results not shown; B.G., unpublished data). PBI-
4050 treatment also resulted in reduced interstitial fibrosis
in the rat heart after suprarenal aorta constriction (almost
complete abrogation of fibrosis) (Figure 9, C and D),
bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (47% reduction of
histologic lesions) (Figure 9, E and F), skin fibrosis in the
fibrillin 1emutant mouse model of systemic scleroderma
(reduction of skin weight by 40%) (Figure 9, G and H), and
pancreas fibrosis that develops in the db/db eNOS�/� type II
diabetic nephropathy mouse model (no fibrosis detected in
PBI-4050etreated mice) (Figure 9, I and J).
Discussion
The data presented herein clearly demonstrate the contri-
bution of two fatty acid receptors, GPR40 and GPR84, in
the regulation of cells involved in fibrosis. Although GPR40
is minimally detectable in immune cells, with the exception
of monocytes,2 GPR84 is abundantly found in bone
marrow, T cells, B cells, granulocytes, microglia, neutro-
phils, and monocytes/macrophages,38e40 and has been
shown to work as a proinflammatory mediator.27 Herein, we
report that GPR40 is also expressed in human and mouse
epithelial cells (proximal tubule and cortical collecting
duct), and GPR84 is expressed in human fibroblasts/myo-
fibroblasts and human podocytes. To date, there have only
been limited reports indicating that GPR40 is expressed and
modulated in kidney,11,12 and to our knowledge, there is no
report that GPR84 is modulated in kidney diseases. Our data
confirm the overexpression of GPR40 and GPR84 in
different chronic and acute kidney injury models. Interest-
ingly, although GPR84 is weakly expressed under normal
conditions in renal tissue, the data indicate that it is over-
expressed in various kidney disease models, whereas
GPR40 is overexpressed after epithelial injury. Also,
LPS-treated
podocytes
and
macrophages,
as
well
as
TGF-betreated fibroblasts and podocytes, show significant
GPR84 up-regulation.
Our data suggest that through the binding to GPR40
and/or GPR84, PBI-4050 reduces fibrosis via the regula-
tion
of
macrophages,
fibroblasts/myofibroblasts,
and
epithelial cells. PBI-4050 inhibits activation of fibroblasts
to profibrotic myofibroblasts, as demonstrated by abroga-
tion of a-SMA expression in fibroblasts, and subsequent

 accumulation of extracellular matrix protein deposition
and fibrosis. Furthermore, PBI-4050 reduced macrophage
activation and the expression of proinflammatory markers
(monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-8, and IL-6) and
profibrotic markers (connective tissue growth factor and
IL-6). PBI-4050 treatment decreases F4/80 immunostain-
ing (marker of macrophages) in the kidneys and pancreas
islets of db/db eNOS�/� mice (M.-Z.Z. and R.C.H., un-
published data). Therefore, the protective actions of
PBI-4050 via GPR40 and GPR84 may reside in modu-
lating such infiltrating cells, and in reducing proliferation/
activation of myofibroblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition in the injured tissue. Ma et al11 have shown
that pretreatment of human renal proximal tubule epithelial
(HK-2) cells with the GPR40 agonist GW9508 attenuated
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, an effect that could also
contribute to the protective action of PBI-4050 in our renal
injury models.
PBI-4050 is an agonist of GPR40 and acts as an
antagonist or inverse agonist of GPR84. It cannot be
excluded that other targets besides GPR40 and GPR84
could be implicated in the mechanism of action of PBI-
4050 and could be explored in future studies. However,
the present study, and in particular the receptor KO
models, strongly supports GPR40 and GPR84 as major
mediators in pathologic fibrotic pathways and as the tar-
gets of the antifibrotic effects of PBI-4050. Our data show
that PBI-4050 significantly attenuated fibrosis in a variety
of injury contexts, as evidenced with the antifibrotic ac-
tivity observed in kidney, liver, lung, heart, pancreas, and
skin fibrosis models. Given our findings with both Gpr40
and Gpr84 KO mice, both receptors appear to be involved
in the fibrotic pathways. Considering their expression
along
the
nephron,
within
the
glomerulus,
and
in
numerous bone marrowederived cell types, it is likely that
GPR40 and GPR84 modulate profibrotic, inflammatory,
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes. There-
fore, GPR40 may partially protect against development of
fibrosis, whereas GPR84 may induce the promotion and
stimulation of fibrosis, as observed with the significant
increase in fibrosis in Gpr40�/� mice and reduction of
fibrosis in Gpr84�/� mice. The dual modulator PBI-4050
reinforces the involvement of both GPR40 and GPR84
in multiple models of fibrosis. In the context of the
adenine-induced CKD model, treatment of Gpr40 and
Gpr84 KO mice with PBI-4050 suggests its antifibrosis
effects to be mainly mediated by GPR40 activation,
whereas inhibition of GPR84 mostly accounts for reduc-
tion of cystic lesions. The relative role of each receptor
may vary depending on the type of insult, pathology, and
organ. Future work will aim to elucidate the precise
intracellular signaling pathways used by both GPR40 and
GPR84 to regulate fibrotic events in the pathogenesis of
disease.
The inhibition of fibrotic and inflammatory markers by
PBI-4050, found in human proximal tubule epithelial cells,
podocytes, and primary fibroblasts (Figure 3), suggests that
the attenuation of fibrosis that we have shown in various
rodent fibrosis models could translate to human disease.
Moreover, significant clinical activity observed in recent
phase 2 clinical trials in type 2 diabetes subjects with
metabolic syndrome41 and in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
patients42 confirm translation of pharmacologic activity of
PBI-4050 in humans. Of interest, PBI-4050 was well
tolerated and demonstrated a good safety profile in these
two early-phase clinical trials.
Taken together, our data show the involvement and
validation at a mechanistic level of GPR40 and GPR84 as
bona fide modulators of fibrotic disease progression. This
suggests that drugs, such as PBI-4050, acting on these
therapeutic targets may delay and/or prevent fibrotic dis-
eases progression and organ failure in human. Its unique
novel mechanism of action and effectiveness in various
preclinical models support the development of PBI-4050 for
the treatment of fibrosis-inducing conditions.
