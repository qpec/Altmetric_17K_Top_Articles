Highlights 
 
• Some people claim to hear what they see: a visually-evoked auditory 
response (V-EAR); 
• We assess the prevalence and perceptual reality of V-EAR for the first time; 
• 22% of subjects confirmed they heard faint sounds accompanying silent 
visual flashes; 
• V-EAR is perceptually real enough to interfere with detection of real sounds; 
• V-EAR may be a normally-occurring precursor to visual-to-auditory 
synaesthesia.

Abstract 
In some people, visual stimulation evokes auditory sensations. How prevalent and 
how perceptually real is this? 22% responded 'Yes' when asked whether they heard 
faint sounds accompanying flash stimuli, and showed significantly better ability to 
discriminate visual ‘Morse-code’ sequences. This benefit might arise from an ability 
to recode visual signals as sounds, thus taking advantage of superior temporal 
acuity of audition. In support of this, those who showed better visual relative to 
auditory sequence discrimination also had poorer auditory detection in the presence 
of uninformative visual flashes, though this was independent of awareness of 
visually-evoked sounds. Thus a visually-evoked auditory representation may occur 
subliminally and disrupt detection of real auditory signals. The frequent natural 
correlation between visual and auditory stimuli might explain the surprising 
prevalence of this phenomenon. Overall, our results suggest that learned 
correspondences between strongly correlated modalities may provide a precursor for 
some synaesthetic abilities.

1. Introduction 
In synaesthesia an inducing stimulus consistently and involuntarily evokes a 
consciously experienced concurrent sensation in a different sensory dimension or 
modality. Though there are many variants of synaesthesia, one feature they have in 
common is that they are rare: the most frequent types (e.g. grapheme and colour, or 
sound and shape) are found in only about 2-4% of the population (Simner et al., 
2006; Ward, 2013). The low prevalence of cases is consistent with suggestions that 
synaesthesia represents an aberrant genotype (Brang, Williams, & Ramachandran, 
2012; Tomson et al., 2011), which may result in unusual patterns of neural cross-
wiring or cross-activation between adjacent cortical regions (Ramachandran & 
Hubbard, 2001; Rouw & Scholte, 2007). However, many researchers have argued 
that some forms of synaesthesia might be grounded on normal mechanisms involved 
in forming and reinforcing associations between different modalities and sensory 
dimensions (Brang, Williams, & Ramachandran, 2012; Cohen, 2013; Cohen Kadosh, 
Henik, Catena, Walsh, & Fuentes, 2009; Cytowic, 2003; Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 
2001; Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001; Ward, Huckstep, & Tsakanikos, 2006). On 
this latter view, the rarity of synaesthesia might be explained by the observation that 
the kinds of exotic associations that typify synaesthesia are very rarely found in 
nature. For example, grapheme-colour synaesthesia might be rare because 
consistent correspondences between letters and colours are themselves rare and 
thus do not typically reinforce strong associations, even though repeated exposure to 
consistent letter-colour pairings (found in fridge-magnets, educational materials, or 
experimental stimuli) might shape and reinforce grapheme-colour associations in 
individuals who are susceptible to them (Bor, Rothen, Schwartzman, Clayton, & 
Seth, 2014; Witthoft, Winawer, & Eagleman, 2015). 
Such reasoning leads to the hypothesis that we might find synaesthetic associations 
more frequently when they occur between stimulus dimensions that are naturally 
correlated, so that their associations are regularly and consistently reinforced. For 
example, visual events naturally correlate very frequently with sounds, whenever two 
objects collide or a person speaks and their lips move. An opportunity to test this 
association frequency hypothesis is presented by a past report that transient visual 
stimulation such as flashes or moving dots can induce conscious concurrent auditory 
 5 
sensations in some individuals (Saenz & Koch, 2008). Saenz & Koch (2008) devised 
an elegant objective test of this phenomenon, where participants had to compare two 
paired 'Morse code' type sequences, presented both either as sounds or flashes. A 
small sample of participants self-identified as ‘hearing-motion’ synaesthetes showed 
relatively high performance for both auditory and visual stimuli, while control 
participants found the task significantly harder in the visual modality. This superior 
visual performance in synaesthetes was explained on the assumption that they were 
benefiting from additional temporal information provided by recoding the visual 
stimulation into the auditory modality (Glenberg, Mann, Altman, Forman, & Procise, 
1989; Guttman, Gilroy, & Blake, 2006). Apart from other rare reports of individuals 
who hear distinct musical sounds associated with visual colours (Baron-Cohen, Burt, 
Smith-Laittan, Harrison, & Bolton, 1996; Goller, Otten, & Ward, 2009) there has been 
no other published research on this visual-to-auditory direction of association to our 
knowledge. Two unresolved questions are raised, which we consider here: how 
prevalent is this phenomenon, and is it perceptually real? 
Prevalence cannot be assessed from Saenz & Koch’s (2008) original study, as the 
few participants who were identified as synaesthetes were not randomly sampled but 
self-selected. Our first goal was therefore to make a tentative estimate of the 
prevalence of visually-evoked auditory sensations in a random sample, using a 
combination of subjective questioning and objective tests based on Saenz & Koch’s 
(2008) paradigm. Our association frequency hypothesis predicts relatively high 
frequency of reports of visually-evoked sensations, in neurotypical individuals, along 
with task performance resembling that of Saenz & Koch’s synaesthetes. 
Though intended as an objective diagnostic of ‘hearing-motion’ synaesthesia, Saenz 
& Koch’s (2008) sequence discrimination paradigm only provides an indirect test of 
the effects of visually-evoked auditory sensations on the visual modality, rather than 
on hearing. Our second goal was therefore to probe the effects of visual stimulation 
on actual auditory signal detection, and measure the correlation of such effects with 
performance on Saenz & Koch’s sequence discrimination paradigm. We measured 
sensitivity for detecting a white-noise burst, in the presence of an irrelevant and 
temporally non-predictive visual event (a high-contrast drifting radial grating), 
 6 
compared to no visual stimulus (following Lovelace, Stein, & Wallace, 2003). We 
predicted that participants who benefitted from auditory-recoding of visual stimuli in 
the sequence discrimination task might be affected more by irrelevant flashes in the 
auditory signal detection task, because they would be experiencing concurrent 
visually-evoked auditory sensations. We also measured and controlled for individual 
biases in the dominance of the auditory modality relative to visual (Colavita, 1974; 
Koppen, Levitan, & Spence, 2009), in case this influenced our other objective 
measures.

2. Methods 
2.1. Participants 
A total of 40 naïve participants with normal hearing (by self-report) took part in the 
research and were paid for their participation. Two participants who did not have 
time to complete the debriefing questions were excluded from analysis, and a further 
participant was excluded because of chance performance in both auditory and visual 
sequence discrimination tasks. The final sample had 24 females, aged 19-36 (mean 
24.24, standard deviation 4.68). One participant had an absolute auditory threshold 
of more than 3 standard deviations higher than the sample mean, but was included 
as performance on the main tasks was in the normal range and exclusion made no 
difference to the pattern of results. A subsample of 24 participants (18 female, mean 
age 23.8, SD 4.27) also performed an additional ‘Colavita’ test (see below). All 
participants had normal or corrected vision and reported normal hearing. All 
procedures were carried out with informed consent and were approved by the local 
Psychology ethics committee. 
2.2. Apparatus and stimuli 
The experimental procedure was conducted using an Apple Mac Mini connected to a 
17” Sony HMD-A420 cathode ray tube (CRT) display. Auditory stimuli were 
presented through two Labtec PC speakers both positioned next to each other 
directly in front of and below the centre of the monitor. Video mode was 800x600 
pixels with a 120 Hz refresh rate and viewing distance was approximately 57cm 
(controlled using a chin rest). A small white fixation point marked the centre of the 
display. Subject responses were collected using the arrow keys on a standard 
computer keyboard. Experimental procedures and stimuli were programmed using 
Psychtoolbox for Matlab. 
Stimuli for each main task closely followed the methods described in the originating 
studies (Lovelace et al., 2003; Saenz & Koch, 2008). For the Sequence 
Discrimination task (Figure 1a), visual stimuli consisted of white circular discs of 
luminance 81cdm-2, presented centrally on a black background. Disk diameter was 3 
degrees of visual angle. Auditory stimuli were sine wave tones of maximum 91dBA 
 8 
sound pressure level, frequency 360Hz. ‘Short’ and ‘Long’ events were presented for 
periods of either 75ms or 300ms respectively, during which stimulation amplitude 
immediately decayed linearly from maximum to zero amplitude. 
For the Auditory Detection task (Figure 1b), auditory stimuli were white noise bursts 
of 300ms duration with amplitude modulated by a Tukey window with 150ms rise and 
fall time. This was presented on a continuous white noise background of 45dBA 
sound pressure level. The visual stimulus was a grey-level radial grating, of 
maximum luminance 72cdm-2, diameter 4deg, and frequency of four cycles per 
revolution, with the grating phase incremented at two cycles per second giving the 
appearance of a rotating windmill. This animated stimulus was chosen with the aim 
of amplifying any auditory sensations induced by visual motion. Interval marker digits 
and response prompts were displayed in white 18pt Helvetica. In the visual 
dominance task (Figure 1c), visual stimuli were circular white discs of luminance 
48cdm-2 and diameter 4.5deg, presented centrally on a black background. Auditory 
stimuli were white noise bursts of 60dBA sound pressure level. All stimuli were 
presented for 50ms. 
2.3. Design 
In the sequence discrimination task the independent variable was the modality of the 
stimuli (either visual or auditory) and the dependent variable was same/different 
discrimination accuracy. In the auditory detection task the independent variable was 
also the modality of the stimuli (either auditory or audiovisual) and the dependent 
variable was auditory target detection accuracy. Results from each paradigm were 
coded as the proportion of correct detects or correct ‘different’ responses, versus 
false alarms or incorrect ‘different' matches, for the purpose of analysis based on 
signal detection theory (Green & Swets, 1966), which allows perceptual detection or 
discriminability of signals to be measured independently of any cognitive or 
attentional factors which might bias the decision criteria. The order of these two 
tasks was counterbalanced between subjects. We also included a measure of visual 
dominance over audition (Colavita, 1974; Koppen et al., 2009), with three randomly 
interleaved conditions: auditory only, visual only and audiovisual; the dependent 
measure was the accuracy for identifying the modality of the stimulus.

2.4. Procedure 
In the Sequence Discrimination task, the procedure closely followed Saenz & Koch 
(2008). On each trial two successive rhythmic sequences of stimuli were presented. 
In half of the trials the events were all visual, and in the other half all auditory. The 
modality of each trial was randomized between trials. Within each sequence, 
constituent stimuli (events) could be either short (75ms) or long (300ms) with a total 
of eight events per sequence. Sequences were randomly generated and consisted of 
a minimum of four and a maximum of five transitions (i.e. a short event followed by a 
long event, or a long event followed by a short). There was an inter-event interval of 
100ms, and an interval of 500ms between the first and second sequence. On half of 
the trials, the two sequences were identical, and on the other half they differed. In 
‘different’ trials, the first two events and the last event were always identical between 
pairs, while the order of the remaining events was randomly permuted. Immediately 
following the second sequence, participants were required to indicate whether they 
thought the two sequences were same or different by pressing either the left or right 
arrow key on a PC keyboard, respectively. No error feedback was given. The 
response initiated the next trial. After the final trial in each block of 20 trials, 
participants could take a break and the next block would begin when they pressed 
the spacebar. There was a total of 100 trials per session. 
Before beginning the Auditory Detection task, we used a two-alternative forced 
choice staircase procedure to find auditory detection thresholds in the absence of 
any visual stimuli. Participants were required to detect a white noise burst in the 
presence of on-going background white noise. Each block began with a central 
fixation dot, which was followed after a keypress by a central digit “1” for 500ms, 
followed by a blank stimulation interval of 500ms. This was immediately followed by 
a “2” for another 500ms, then another blank stimulation interval. This was terminated 
by a visual prompt to make a response. The target stimulus was a 300ms burst of 
white noise, which could be presented, after a delay of 150ms, in either one of the 
two stimulation intervals. This procedure ensured that there was no visual stimulation 
present during the auditory stimulation, while providing clear visual temporal markers 
bracketing each stimulation interval (similar to Lovelace et al, 2003). The participant 
had to indicate whether the target was in either the first or second interval, using left 
 10 
or right arrow keys respectively. Participants heard a single click if their response 
was correct, and two clicks if incorrect. On each trial, target intensity was chosen 
depending on responses to the previous trials, using the Quest algorithm (Watson & 
Pelli, 1983). Each block contained 40 trials, and there were 6 blocks in total. After 
each block the algorithm calculated the auditory thresholds, which were then 
averaged to achieve a final threshold estimate. This was used to set the amplitude of 
the target for the main auditory detection task, which then remained fixed.  
The main auditory detection task consisted of single-interval trials in which a target 
was either present or absent. Participants had to indicate whether the target was 
present or absent, using left or right arrow keys respectively, and received error 
feedback. The target timing and stimulus characteristics were the same as described 
before. Prior to each trial a central fixation dot was presented for 500ms, which then 
disappeared at the onset of the 500ms stimulation interval. The end of the stimulus 
interval was marked by the appearance of a response prompt, instructing 
participants to press the left or right arrow to indicate whether they thought the target 
was present or absent, respectively. On half of the trials the interval contained no 
visual stimuli (auditory-only trial), while the other half contained a white rotating radial 
grating which was presented throughout the 500ms interval (audiovisual trials). 
Because it filled the entire stimulation interval, the visual stimulus provided no more 
temporally predictive information than the fixation offsets and onsets that already 
flanked the stimulation interval. Participants were told that the visual stimulus could 
be ignored because it provided no information. Auditory and audiovisual trials were 
blocked and the order of blocks was randomly permuted for each participant. Each 
block contained 40 trials and there were 6 blocks in total (three for each condition). 
After participants had completed both tasks they were asked a short series of 
questions: 
• What strategy were you using when you saw flashes in the visual 
sequencing experiment? 
• Were you aware of using the flashes as if they were sounds, e.g. “flash, 
flash-flash” = “beep, beep-beep” 
• Did you actually hear faint sounds when you saw flashes? 
 11 
• In everyday life, are you ever aware of hearing sounds when you see 
flashing lights or movement, e.g. shop displays, car indicators, or people 
walking? 
• Do you ever experience colours associated with letters, or with music, or 
tastes or smells associated with sounds? 
• Have you ever been diagnosed as a synaesthete or do you suspect you 
might be one? 
In a later session we administered the test of sensory dominance (Colavita, 1974) to 
24 of our original participants who were still available. We presented participants with 
10 blocks of 100 randomised trials, where 20% of trials were bimodal and the 
remaining 80% were divided equally between unimodal visual and auditory trials. 
Each block consisted of a stream of stimuli, each presented for 50ms interspersed 
by random intervals between 1300 and 1700ms. Participants were required to 
respond as quickly as possible with the left arrow key for auditory trials, the right 
arrow key for visual trials and both keys simultaneously for bimodal trials.

3. Results 
3.1. Subjective results 
Subjective data were collected by asking a series of questions at the end of the 
experimental tasks. When initially asked to talk about strategies used in the 
sequence discrimination task, without prompting 22 out of 37 participants (59%) 
reported deliberately converting visual sequences to internal sounds (i.e. they 
‘mentally replayed’ them as auditory sequences), while 17 (46%) said they tried 
counting and remembering the temporal positions of long vs. short flashes. Some 
reported attempting both strategies. When asked ‘In the sequence discrimination 
task were you aware of using the flashes as if they were sounds’, 27 answered ‘yes’ 
(73%, Table 1). When then asked ‘In the sequence discrimination task did you 
actually hear faint sounds when you saw flashes?’, eight participants answered ‘yes’ 
(22%). Responses were conservatively interpreted, so if participants were unsure 
about whether or not they heard any auditory sensation on seeing the flashes, this 
was coded as a negative response. We then asked whether they were ‘ever aware 
of hearing sounds when you see flashing lights or movement, e.g. shop displays, car 
indicators, or people walking?’, to which four answered in the affirmative, though only 
one of these had answered ‘yes’ to the previous question. None said they had been 
previously diagnosed as synaesthetes, though three did report that they sometimes 
experienced pairings between different senses. 
3.2. Objective group statistics 
Performance was on average significantly higher for auditory versus visual sequence 
discrimination [mean d’ (and standard error): Visual 1.74 (0.13); Auditory 3.14 (0.20); 
t(36) = 7.87, p<0.00001, Cohen's D = 1.36], and likewise for both of the subgroups 
defined by responses to the question ‘Did you actually hear faint sounds when you 
saw flashes?’ [No-Hear: t(28) = 6.83, p<0.00001, Cohen's D = 1.3; Yes-Hear: t(7) = 
4.01, p<0.005, Cohen's D = 1.5]. Participants were also significantly less cautious 
about making ‘different’ responses to visual sequences (Mean criterion 1.67, SE 
0.078) compared to auditory (Mean 2.25, SE .12) [t(36) = 5.62, p<0.00001, Cohen's 
D = 0.96]. 
 13 
For between group comparisons we analysed sequence discrimination in a mixed 
ANOVA, with auditory/visual task and Yes/No-Hear groups as the two factors, after 
first confirming that there were no significant violations of homogeneity of variances 
[Levene’s F(1,35)=0.76, p=0.39]. As found in Saenz & Koch (2008), performance 
was significantly better in the auditory modality [Visual Mean d’ (SE): 1.74 (3.14); 
Auditory: 3.14 (1.22); F(1,35)=41.8, p<.00001], however performance overall was 
significantly better for participants who answered ‘Yes’ to the question [Yes-Hear 
Mean d' (SE): 3.02 (0.29); No-Hear: 2.27 (0.15); F(1,35)=5.17, p=.029] (Figure 2a). 
The interaction was not significant [F(1,35)=.90, ns]. Bonferroni-corrected 
comparisons showed that only the visual task benefited significantly in participants 
confirming awareness of auditory sensations compared to those who did not [Visual: 
t(35)=2.43, p=0.02; Auditory t(35)=1.64, p=0.11] (see bar chart of means in Figure 
2a). Because of possible concerns about unequal sample sizes, we performed an 
alternative bootstrapping analysis in which we compared performance in the eight 
‘Yes’ participants with 1000 samples of eight participants randomly selected with 
replacement from the ‘No’ group. This showed a similar pattern, where only 
performance in the visual ‘Yes’ group condition was outside the 95% confidence 
interval of the bootstrapped ‘No’ distribution [visual z=2.79, p=0.005; auditory z=1.92, 
p=0.055]. Comparison of visual-minus-auditory performance across groups 
(equivalent to the interaction term in the above ANOVA) was however still not 
significant using this method. An ANOVA analysis for the question of whether 
participants were ‘aware of using the flashes as if they were sounds’ showed no 
significant main effect of group [F(1,35)=.48, ns]. There was a significant interaction 
with task modality [F(1,35)=5.96, p=.02], where those who answered ‘Yes’ had 
higher auditory d’s than the others [Yes-Use Mean d’ (SE): 3.32 (0.23); No-Use: 2.63 
(0.38)], however post-hoc comparisons showed no significant differences. 
For the Auditory Detection task, there were also wide individual differences in 
auditory detection d’, and in the effects of the additional visual stimulation (Figure 
2c). There were no significant differences in d’ or criterion between Auditory or 
Audiovisual conditions overall nor for each participant group, nor in the difference in 
performance between conditions. 
 14 
3.3. Correlation between tasks  
According to Saenz and Koch (2008), their ‘hearing-motion’ synaesthetes differed 
less across modalities in their sequence discrimination ability compared to control 
subjects, as if they were using similar resources to perform the task in different 
modalities. We hypothesised that participants showing this pattern of behaviour 
would have lower auditory detection sensitivity in the presence of visual stimulation, 
compared to without. To assess this, we first subtracted the auditory d’ from the 
visual d’ for sequence discrimination (SEQd’V-A). Higher values (less negative) 
indicate more similar performance for both modalities. Our second measure of the 
visual influence on auditory detection was computed by subtracting d’ in the auditory-
only condition from d’ in the audiovisual condition (DETd’AV-A). Negative values would 
be consistent with an effect of visual stimulation interfering with auditory detection. 
There was a significant negative correlation between scores on these two measures 
[Pearson’s r(35) = -0.43, p<0.0037]: the closer visual sequence discriminability was 
to auditory, the more visual stimulation impaired auditory detection, or the less it 
benefited (Figure 2d). This result is consistent with the notion that internal auditory 
noise evoked by the visual stimulus can actually interfere with an externally-
originating signal. We also found a significant positive correlation between DETd’AV-A 
and auditory sequence discrimination [r(35)=0.40, p=0.01], but not visual sequence 
discrimination [r(35)=0.03, p=0.85; all three above analyses used Bonferonni-
adjusted alpha]. There was no significant correlation of sequence discrimination with 
the absolute threshold for auditory signal detection measured prior to the main task, 
that could account for individual differences in performance. Visual stimulation may 
thus interfere with auditory detection more in individuals whose auditory modality is 
less adept at sequence discrimination. A similar analysis using criterion scores 
instead of d’ for the detection task revealed no significant correlations with the 
sequence discrimination conditions. 
The above negative correlation between d’ difference scores (Figure 2b) might arise 
if each task’s absolute d’ measurements were actually positively correlated, but each 
subject to ceiling versus floor effects respectively. However there was no significant 
positive correlation between absolute measures (averaged across visual and 
auditory conditions for each task) [r(35)=-0.18, p< 0.29].  
 15 
3.4. Sensory Dominance Task 
One explanation for the negative correlation above could be that people who are 
naturally biased to attend more to visual events can benefit when such events are 
relevant (resulting in better visual sequence discrimination) but are more distracted 
when they are irrelevant (resulting in poorer auditory detection in the context of 
visual stimulation). To assess this, we subsequently obtained a measure of visual 
dominance over audition following Colavita (1974) from 24 of our original 
participants, including 6 who had answered ‘Yes’ to the question about hearing the 
flashes. This subsample had similar descriptive statistics and showed a very similar 
pattern of significant and non-significant results as reported above. We successfully 
replicated the ‘Colavita Effect’, finding that when participants were presented with an 
audiovisual stimulus, they tended on average to erroneously report seeing only a 
visual stimulus about twice as frequently than reporting only an auditory stimulus 
[Visual error rate: M=10.8%, SE=1.9; Auditory: Mean 5.1%, SE .11; t(23)=3.46, p 
=.002, Cohen's D = 0.75]. Such visual bias did not correlate significantly with our 
difference measures of detection or sequence discrimination [DETd’AV-A: r(22)=-0.34, 
p=0.10; SEQd’V-A: r(22)=0.05, p=0.81]. In a multiple regression analysis, we further 
confirmed that the critical relationship (i.e. shown in Figure 2d) between sequence 
discrimination and auditory signal detection (SEQd’V-A vs. DETd’AV-A) was still reliable 
in this sub-sample after controlling for sensory dominance [t(21) = 2.46, p= .022, R2= 
.31], which itself was not significantly predictive [t(21) = 1.78, p= .091].

4. Discussion 
The present combination of subjective and objective results provides the first 
estimate of the prevalence of visual-induced auditory sensations, and a test of the 
perceptual reality of such sensations. 22% of our normal participants reported 
hearing sounds accompanying visual flashes. These participants performed 
significantly better in a visual sequence discrimination task, supporting previous 
suggestions that the ability to recode visual events as sounds may influence visual 
discrimination of rhythmic sequences (Guttman et al., 2006; Saenz & Koch, 2008). 
Furthermore, our study is the first to suggest that such auditory-recoding of visual 
events not only indirectly affects visual performance but directly affect auditory signal 
detection. This kind of visually-evoked auditory response (V-EAR) is thus apparently 
not only quite common but it can impact on detection of real sounds. 
In Saenz & Koch’s (2008) study, ‘hearing-motion’ synaesthetes who reported 
routinely hearing visually-evoked sounds were almost as good at discriminating 
visual flash sequences as they were discriminating auditory tone sequences, while in 
non-synaesthetes sequence discrimination was significantly poorer for flashes than 
for tones. It was inferred from this that the synaesthetes were uniquely able to 
recode the flashes as sounds and thus benefit from the better auditory temporal 
acuity of the auditory modality (Glenberg et al., 1989; Guttman et al., 2006). 
However, this ability to recode flashes into the auditory modality might not be 
restricted to synaesthetes. Testing normal participants, Guttman et al (2006) found 
that visual sequence discrimination was disrupted more by irrelevant auditory 
rhythms than by irrelevant visual rhythms, suggesting that the visual sequences were 
being processed using the same auditory resources as the auditory distractors. 
Indeed, Guttman et al (2006) informally reported that they themselves experienced 
“a natural tendency to hear the temporal sequencing of these [visual] changes” (p.2). 
However the above studies only obtained an indirect measure of the effects of such 
auditory recoding on visual performance. We hypothesised that if there is such a 
natural tendency for visual flashes to evoke an auditory response, then these should 
impact on the detection of real sounds. Our results confirmed this: participants who 
showed similar visual and auditory sequence discriminability that resembled Saenz & 
Koch’s synaesthetes tended to have poorer auditory detection sensitivity when 
 17 
accompanied by irrelevant visual flashes. This association was found despite the 
difference between task and stimuli, which were chosen to closely replicate the 
methods of the originating studies.  
The influence of the visual modality on audition is presumably involuntary rather than 
a result of a deliberate strategy, as it did not benefit detection performance. It might 
occur due to masking of the auditory signal by increased internal noise, though this 
does not easily explain why auditory detection benefited from visual stimulation in 
some participants. Alternatively poorer sensitivity might reflect an attempt in some 
participants to actively discount internally-originating sensations from externally-
originating signals (Sinke et al., 2014), while others integrate or ignore them; 
conversely it has been proposed that people with poorer audiovisual integration may 
develop compensatory synaesthetic tendencies (Sinke et al., 2014). Interestingly, we 
found that greater visual interference in the auditory detection task was significantly 
associated with poorer auditory sequence discrimination. This supports the idea that 
an ability to recode visual information as sounds might compensate for a poorer 
ability to discriminate pure auditory sequences. This interpretation has some 
neurophysiological support from evidence of increased visual evoked potentials in 
temporal auditory areas in hearing-impaired subjects (Campbell & Sharma, 2014). 
In addition to the association with objective auditory detection performance, our 
subjective data supports the assumption that performance on the sequence 
discrimination task reflects an ability to recode flashes as sounds. On debriefing, 
22% of participants answered ‘Yes’ to the surprise question of whether they had 
been aware of faint sounds accompanying the flashes in the sequence discrimination 
task. In agreement with Saenz & Koch (2008), these ‘Yes-Hear’ participants 
performed significantly better on the visual sequence discrimination tasks compared 
to those who did not report such sounds. Given that our participants reported no 
established history of synaesthesia, the proportion of ‘Yes-Hear’ participants is 
surprisingly high. This proportion might have been inflated if participants had 
answered that they actually ‘heard’ flashes when instead they had just experienced a 
vivid form of imagery. However only ‘Yes-Hear’ responses to this question predicted 
significantly better performance on the visual sequence discrimination task relative to 
 18 
‘No-Hear’ responders, while the many more participants who admitted using a 
strategy of actively imagining the flashes as sounds did not perform significantly 
differently to others on the visual measure. This suggests that the phenomenon of 
interest is not merely based on imagery, but on auditory sensations.  
Though the subjective data predict some aspects of objective performance, the 
objective signs of visually-evoked auditory sensations could also occur 
independently of awareness. For example, some ‘No-Hear’ participants showed high 
visual sequence discriminability; furthermore, the effect of flashes on auditory 
detection was also not dependent on reporting awareness of hearing flashes. Two 
methodological differences from the original study might account for the 
predominance of such patterns here. Firstly, we sampled randomly while the original 
study presumably contrasted self-selected participants who did versus did not report 
synaesthesia for hearing visual events. It is therefore possible that Saenz & Koch’s 
control group might have underrepresented any normally-occurring tendencies to 
hear flashes. Conversely, our variant of their paradigm, with slightly longer events 
and shorter retention delays between the two comparison intervals, may have been 
more sensitive to latent tendencies found in normal participants. A similar 
dissociation between subjective and objective measures has been found in studies 
that have attempted to induce synaesthesia-like associations by training and have 
found robust objective effects on information processing but weak evidence of 
subjective concurrents (reviewed in Deroy & Spence, 2013). In the present case, 
reporting a subjective experience may depend on first explicitly noticing the auditory 
sensations, which might be easily ignored due to the highly predictable natural 
association of auditory and visual events (see below).  
Given this apparent partial dissociation of subjective and objective measures, it 
might be wondered whether the objective correspondence between sequence 
discrimination performance and auditory detection is related to other factors jointly 
affecting both tasks that are not directly associated with the subjective effects of 
auditory sensations evoked by visual events. In particular, a bias towards processing 
stimuli in the visual modality might have benefitted visual sequence discrimination 
relative to auditory, while causing visual stimuli to distract more from auditory signal 
 19 
detection. However, our measure of the Colavita effect (Colavita, 1974; Koppen et 
al., 2009) helps to discount this possibility. Though we successfully replicated the 
Colavita effect, this did not predict performance in either task, thus there is no 
evidence that the present results can be accounted for by general differences in bias 
towards the visual modality. 
The above indications of prevalence are consistent with our original hypothesis that 
some forms of synaesthesia might occur more frequently if the inducing and 
concurrent sensations are more frequently associated in nature. This might be 
expected on the basis of evidence that some synaesthetic associations can be 
reinforced by exposure to consistent sensory pairings (Bor et al., 2014; Witthoft et 
al., 2015). While artificial correspondences such as consistent grapheme/colour 
associations are extremely rare in nature, visual and auditory events are highly 
predictive of each other in nature: whenever we see two objects colliding, or a 
person’s lips moving to speak, this is usually accompanied by a sudden onset of 
sound. Consequently, if an individual has any predisposition towards synaesthetic 
perceptions, they should be more likely to have formed audiovisual associations than 
other less frequently occurring kinds. 
The very predictability of visual-to-auditory correspondences might also 
counterintuitively explain why there have been so few reports of visually-evoked 
auditory concurrents (Baron-Cohen et al., 1996; Goller et al., 2009; Saenz & Koch, 
2008). When a faint auditory sensation accompanies a visual event we might easily 
ignore it because it would not seem surprising or unusual. We might even assume it 
was real, and think we are actually hearing the footfalls of somebody walking ahead 
of us. In contrast, experiencing a visually-evoked taste instead would be more 
surprising and thus harder to discount or ignore. Similar reasoning might explain why 
rare shape-taste correspondences are classified as synaesthetic, but not taste-smell 
associations (e.g. the ‘sweet’ smell of chocolate (Stevenson & Tomiczek, 2007; van 
Campen, 2008) which naturally belong together and are thus highly predictable. This 
perspective of ignored or discounted concurrents predicts that awareness of visually-
evoked sounds might be promoted in some individuals if attention is drawn to them 
under verifiably silent conditions. There have been cases where individuals have 
 20 
become aware of latent synaesthesias in adulthood through introspective attention 
(Tyler, 2005). In tentative support of this, some of our lab assistants and author (CF) 
informally reported that they started to hear flash-evoked sounds after repeated 
exposure to the visual sequence discrimination paradigm. 
In terms of brain mechanisms, it is currently debated to what extent synaesthesias 
reflect genotypically unusual cross-wiring between sensory areas (Brang et al., 2012; 
Tomson et al., 2011), versus physiological disinhibition of normally-occurring 
connections (Cohen Kadosh et al., 2009; Cohen Kadosh & Walsh, 2006; 
Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001; Neufeld et al., 2012). This debate might be 
informed by whether the behavioural measures have a discontinuous or continuous 
distribution (Cohen Kadosh, 2013; Deroy & Spence, 2015; Martino & Marks, 2001; 
Simner, 2012). Although we did not test participants with a history of synaesthesia, 
we can distinguish a subgroup that reports visually-evoked sounds; however such 
subjective awareness seems to be the only dichotomous variable, for even though 
on average ‘Yes-Hear’ participants were significantly better at visual discrimination, 
the distribution of our objective measures appears smooth rather than discontinuous. 
This apparent behavioural continuity seems more likely to reflect normal 
mechanisms linking auditory and visual neural representations, either directly or via 
subcortical or multimodal areas (Ward et al., 2006), rather than unusual patterns of 
neural cross-wiring present only in a few individuals. Indeed, neurons responding to 
visual stimulation have been found in auditory cortex which may receive stimulation 
from higher areas or from subcortical regions via interconnections found in normal 
anatomy (Ghazanfar & Schroeder, 2006; Schroeder & Foxe, 2005). Such 
connections may function to improve spatial localisation of sound or amplify the 
auditory response to visually identifiable sources (Schroeder & Foxe, 2005). Given 
this normal connectivity, the additional emergence of a conscious visually-evoked 
auditory concurrent might thus be more readily explained by individual physiological 
variations, which might influence whether existing connections, or their interactions 
with higher areas, are inhibited or unmasked (Cohen Kadosh et al., 2009; Cohen 
Kadosh & Walsh, 2006; Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001; Neufeld et al., 2012), to 
greater or lesser degree. 
 21 
This study has provided the first evidence that a surprisingly high proportion of 
randomly-sampled neurotypical individuals can sometimes report auditory 
sensations evoked by visual flashes. These internal sounds seem to be perceptually 
real enough to interfere with the detection of externally-generated sounds, as well as 
benefiting visual sequence discrimination, even if they not always subjectively 
reportable. The greater prevalence of this phenomenon compared to canonical 
synaesthesias might derive from the strength of statistical correspondence between 
visual events and the sounds they cause. The continuous distribution of performance 
across individuals on our objective measures, and the partial independence of these 
from subjective measures seems consistent with the role of normal rather than 
abnormal neural connections between visual and auditory representations, the 
disinhibition of which may occasionally result in emergence of conscious visually-
evoked auditory concurrents.
