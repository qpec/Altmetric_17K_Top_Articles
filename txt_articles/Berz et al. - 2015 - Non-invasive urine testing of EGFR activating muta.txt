Non-invasive urine testing of EGFR 
activating mutation and T790M resistance 
mutation in non-small cell lung cancer
David Berz1*, Victoria M. Raymond2, Jordan H. Garst2 and Mark G. Erlander2
Abstract 
Background: The increasing understanding of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biology over the last two decades 
has led to the identification of multiple molecular targets. This led to the development of multiple targeted therapies 
in the primary and secondary resistance setting and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene remains the 
most frequently observed molecular target in NSCLC. Tissue biopsies remain the standard for the identification of 
such EGFR mutations. Obtaining serial tissue biopsies, especially in the secondary resistance setting is associated with 
multiple medical and logistical challenges. Utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments for molecular analysis 
can overcome these challenges and aid in therapeutic decision-making.
Case presentation: Here we present a present a 72-year-old Korean woman with metastatic, EGFR L858R mutated 
bronchogenic adenocarcinoma. She developed skeletal progression on treatment with first and second generation 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Repeated biopsies failed to provide informative molecular test results. A novel urine 
ctDNA assay was utilized and confirmed T790M positive status. The patient was started on a third generation TKI, 
which led to a measurable clinical response.
Conclusions: Utilization of urine liquid biopsies for EGFR diagnostics are feasible and provided critical clinical infor-
mation in this patient’s case. Urine liquid biopsy represents a viable alternative to tissue biopsy, particularly in the 
secondary resistance setting, when tissue is not available for molecular testing.

Background
Advances in targeted drug development, focused on 
somatic mutations have significantly changed the thera-
peutic landscape of lung cancer. In non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), constitutively activating EGFR (epider-
mal growth factor receptor) mutations occur in about 
11–16 % of patients from the United States and Europe 
 
[1–3]. In patients of Asian descent, the mutation fre-
quency is higher, an estimated 61.1 % in females and 44.0 % 
in males [4]. The identification of patients with activat-
ing EGFR mutations is clinically meaningful as treatment 
naïve patients are exquisitely sensitive to small molecule 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Initial response rates to 
first and second generation TKIs are in excess of 50 % [5]. 
Unfortunately, responses are generally of limited duration 
with a progression free survival of 10–11 months [6–9]. 
Several acquired TKI resistance mechanisms have been 
described, with more than half of the patients developing 
an EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation [10].
Third generation EGFR TKIs are uniquely designed for 
use in patients whose tumors harbor the T790M resist-
ance mutation [11, 12]. Clinical trials have demonstrated 
excellent response rates to these drugs [13, 14], leading 
to Food and Drug Administration approval of osimer-
tinib for use in this patient population. However, clini-
cal uptake of these targeted therapeutics is hindered by

challenges in obtaining tissue for molecular analysis 
in the secondary resistance setting. These challenges 
include lesion inaccessibility, patient performance status, 
and procedure coordination [15]. Tumor heterogeneity, 
sample purity, and pre-fixation/fixation artifacts further 
complicate the interpretation of genomic results [16, 17].
This calls for novel, alternative molecular methods for 
assessment of the EGFR mutation status in the secondary 
resistance setting.
Here we present a case of a 72-year-old female of 
Korean descent, who developed clinical resistance to first 
and second line EGFR TKIs. Circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) isolated from urine was evaluated for the pres-
ence of EGFR mutations.
Case presentation
In September 2013, a 72-year-old never smoking female 
of Korean descent presented with progressive shortness 
of breath. Chest X-ray and positron emission tomogra-
phy–computed tomography (PET-CT) were notable for a 
2.0 cm dominant left lower lung lobe lesion with multi-
level mediastinal disease and widespread involvement of 
the axial skeleton (Fig. 1a).
CT guided needle biopsy demonstrated a well-differ-
entiated bronchogenic adenocarcinoma (CK7 positive, 
CK20 negative, TTF-1 positive). Tissue analysis was per-
formed and was positive for the EGFR L858R activating 
mutation in exon 21 while ALK was wild type. She was 
diagnosed with stage IV, T1a, N2, M1b bronchogenic 
adenocarcinoma.
Given the presence of a somatic EGFR activating muta-
tion, the patient started single agent erlotinib as first line 
therapy, which was well tolerated. Partial response was 
confirmed in December 2013 when PET-CT revealed a 
decrease in both size and fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity 
of the dominant left lower lobe lung lesion, as well as the 
mediastinal and skeletal metastases. Lesions remained 
stable by PET-CT in March 2014.
A May 2014 PET-CT noted continued decrease in size 
and metabolic activity of the left lower lung lobe lesion, 
but a new skeletal lesion was identified at T12 (Fig. 1b). 
The option of re-biopsy was discussed, specifically to 
identify emergence of acquired resistance mechanisms 
for consideration of alternative therapies, but the patient 
declined and opted to continue with erlotinib therapy. 
When follow up PET-CT in August 2014 showed further

skeletal lesions. b May 2014 PET-CT demonstrating new hypermetabolic lesion at T12. c January 2015 attempted CT guided biopsy of T12 lesion.

skeletal progression, especially at T12, she agreed to 
a core needle biopsy of the skeletal lesion (Fig. 1c). The 
sample was submitted for massively parallel sequencing, 
but was insufficient for comprehensive genomic evalua-
tion. Given that molecular testing did not reveal a mech-
anism of somatic resistance, the patient continued on 
erlotinib therapy.
In September 2014, the patient developed subtle dis-
comfort over her spine without neurologic dysfunction. 
Treatment discussions included radiation therapy and 
second-generation TKI therapy. She opted for the latter 
and treatment with afatinib was initiated. This treatment 
improved her back pain, but her course was complicated 
by a hospital admission for grade 4 diarrhea. A PET-CT 
in November 2014 demonstrated further progression at 
T12 and a repeat biopsy of the T12 lesion was performed 
in January 2015. EGFR allelotyping was attempted, 
but results were again inconclusive due to insufficient 
amount of extracted tumor DNA.
In February 2015, her EGFR somatic resistance sta-
tus remained unknown and she started carboplatin and 
paclitaxel chemotherapy subsequently transitioning to 
carboplatin and pemetrexed. Increasing asthenia, nau-
sea and vomiting, and two admissions for neutropenic 
sepsis within 4 weeks led to discontinuation of cytotoxic 
therapy.
The option of treatment with third generation TKI ther-
apy was discussed, but tissue biopsy was thus far unin-
formative in determining emergence of the EGFR T790M 
resistance mutation. Liquid biopsy ctDNA analysis was 
considered as an alternative assessment of resistance. 
Urine ctDNA analysis was performed and confirmed the 
L858R activating mutation at 397 copies [per 100,000 
genome equivalents (GEq)]. The analysis was also positive 
for EGFR T790M (217 copies per 100,000 GEq) (Fig. 2). 
With identification of the resistance mutation, nearly 
10 months after initial clinical suspicion of acquired resist-
ance, patient became eligible for and initiated on a third 
generation TKI inhibitor, osimertinib. She showed good 
symptomatic and radiographic response (Figs. 1d, 3).
Conclusions
Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed 
for sophisticated analysis of the tumor genomic land-
scape [18]. The identification of specific somatic driver 
mutations influences therapeutic decision making, per-
mitting a personalized approach to oncology care. Tumor 
tissue has long been considered the best source of mate-
rial for molecular analysis. However, the serial tissue 
biopsies needed to obtain the most up to date tumor 
molecular signatures are often difficult to obtain and can 
be associated with significant morbidity, thus hinder-
ing the potential impact of these targeted therapeutics. 
A 2014 study found 19.3 % of patients who undergo a 
lung biopsy experience an adverse event [19]. It is esti-
mated that approximately 25 % of patients who undergo 
tissue biopsy for genomic evaluation fail to get informa-
tive test results due to poor DNA quantity, quality or 
inadequate tissue sample obtained [20]. Issues such as 
intra and inter tumor heterogeneity further complicate

the interpretation of molecular results from tissue diag-
nosis. Additionally, in patients in whom tissue and DNA 
quality and quantity are sufficient, turn-around time for 
results can be lengthy, often 30 or more days, impacting 
the potential of these targeted therapies [20].
The presented case highlights a common clinical scenario 
when multiple tissue biopsies were completed and failed 
to obtain critical clinical information, delaying the time to 
clinically impactful information by more than 10 months. 
Systemic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has recently 
emerged as a clinically viable alternative to a tissue biopsy 
[21]. In patients with cancer, plasma ctDNA contains 
genomic mutations that are concordant with the primary 
tumor and ctDNA has greater representation of muta-
tion burden than single tissue biopsies [22–26]. Systemic 
ctDNA fragments are able to negotiate the glomerular fil-
ter and can reliably be detected in urine [27]. Recent pub-
lications have demonstrated concordance between urine 
ctDNA and tissue biopsy, and urine ctDNA and plasma 
ctDNA making urine ctDNA a viable alternative to tissue 
biopsy and plasma [27–29]. Reckamp et al. [30] published 
an interim data set of 63 patients with metastatic NSCLC, 
progressing on first or second line TKI therapy, eligible 
for a third generation TKI (rociletinib). Tissue, plasma, 
and urine samples were collected from patients in order 
to determine EGFR T790M status. The sensitivity of urine 
and plasma versus tissue in detecting T790M was 93 % 
(13/14) and 93 % (38/41) respectively. Additionally, the liq-
uid biopsy samples provided information on mutational 
status in patients who had tissue samples inadequate for 
mutational analysis, and those thought to be negative by 
tissue analysis. The expanded dataset of 213 patients with 
matched tissue and urine was presented by Wakelee et al. 
[31] at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology and 
demonstrated an 81.1 % sensitivity for urine versus tissue. 
Furthermore, the response rate to the third generation TKI 
was similar across all three sample types tested.
Urine ctDNA analysis provides the advantage of being 
a completely noninvasive sample type, eliminating other 
clinical and logistical challenges related to acquisition of 
blood from patients with cancer, such as difficulties with 
phlebotomy due to fragile, small or difficult to locate veins. 
Additionally, because urine is a readily available sample 
type, acquisition does not necessitate the procedure coor-
dination or time in a phlebotomy lab for a tissue biopsy or 
blood sample respectively. In Reckamp et al. [30] and the 
expanded dataset presented by Wakelee et al. [31] the urine 
sample was collected at a time of day based on patient con-
venience. Kinetic urine studies are in progress to determine 
the best time of day at which to collect the urine sample.
The urine and plasma assays have a lower limit of 
detection of one mutant copy per 18,181 GEq for EGFR 
exon 19 deletions and L858R and two copies per 18,181 
GEq for T790M [30]. Quantitation of the baseline urine 
ctDNA mutation burden could enable longitudinal moni-
toring of mutation load for assessing response to treat-
ment [23, 32–34]. Reckamp et al. [30] published data 
demonstrating dynamic changes in EGFR T790M muta-
tion load within 21 days in patients with metastatic 
NSCLC starting on a third generation TKI (rociletinib).

In a pilot study, Hussain et al. [35] demonstrated that 
monitoring for early emergence of T790M in patients 
with EGFR positive NSCLC identified the mutation up 
to 3 months prior to radiographic progression. Ongoing 
work will demonstrate the ability of ctDNA quantitation 
to be used to detect resistance mechanisms in advance of 
imaging and as an early response biomarker.
This case demonstrates the clinical utility of urine 
ctDNA analysis. Targeted urinary EGFR mutation analy-
sis provided a safer and less invasive source of molecu-
lar information, eliminating tissue biopsy related patient 
morbidity. EGFR T790M identification was instrumental 
in the optimal choice of therapy. Utilizing this technol-
ogy earlier in treatment would have provided critical 
information in a more timely fashion and could have 
eliminated the need for multiple uninformative tis-
sue biopsies. Urinary ctDNA analysis allows for a more 
comprehensive analysis of the tumor mutation burden as 
compared to tissue biopsy and should be considered in 
treatment decision-making.
