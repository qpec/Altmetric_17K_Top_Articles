Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is associated with a poor clinical outcome as a result of the few treatment options 
and poor therapeutic response. Here, we report that elevated expression of urine diphosphate–galactose ceramide 
galactosyltransferase (UGT8) specifically occurs in BLBC and predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. UGT8 
expression is transcriptionally up-regulated by Sox10, triggering the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway; increased sulfatide 
activates integrin αVβ5-mediated signaling that contributes to BLBC progression. UGT8 expression promotes, whereas UGT8 
knockdown suppresses tumorigenicity and metastasis. Importantly, we identify that zoledronic acid (ZA), a marketed drug 
for treating osteoporosis and bone metastasis, is a direct inhibitor of UGT8, which blocks the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway. 
Significantly, a clinically achievable dosage of ZA exhibits apparent inhibitory effect on migration, invasion, and lung 
metastasis of BLBC cells. Together, our study suggests that UGT8 is a potential prognostic indicator and druggable target of 
BLBC and that pharmacologic inhibition of UGT8 by ZA offers a promising opportunity for treating this challenging disease.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of four 
major molecular subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, 
HER2/ERBB2, and basal-like (Vargo-Gogola and Rosen, 2007). 
Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an especially aggressive sub-
type that typically afflicts younger and premenopausal women 
and possesses the worst prognosis of any breast cancer subtypes 
(Kreike et al., 2007; Rakha et al., 2008). BLBC tends to be nega-
tive for the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone 
receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; 
i.e., triple-negative), a situation that lacks effective targeted ther-
apies, such as endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies (Fadare and 
Tavassoli, 2008; Korsching et al., 2008; Rakha et al., 2008). <30% 
patients with metastatic BLBC have a 5-yr survival rate despite 
adjuvant chemotherapy that remains the mainstay of BLBC treat-
ment (Dent et al., 2007). The highly aggressive nature and the 
absence of effective therapeutics make it a high priority to eluci-
date its determinants of aggressiveness and identify its potential 
therapeutic targets.
Metabolic alterations contribute to rewire metabolic and 
oncogenic signaling pathways to meet the demands of cancer 
cell survival and metastasis (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). 
Sulfatide is a sphingolipid commonly found on the surface of 
most of eukaryotic cells (Xiao et al., 2013). Besides its structural 
role for the cell membrane, sulfatide is also involved in cell adhe-
sion and aggregation, protein trafficking, axon–myelin interac-
tions, learning and memory, modulation of sodium and potas-
sium channels, and neural plasticity (Xiao et al., 2013). Abnormal 
metabolism of sulfatide is correlated with development of many 
diseases, including metachromatic leukodystrophy, diabetes, 
autoimmune diseases, and cancers (Takahashi and Suzuki, 
2012). Sulfatide biosynthesis is associated with a simple two-
step pathway and two enzymes. UGT8 is the first key enzyme 
that catalyzes the transfer of galactose to ceramide for the syn-
thesis of galactosylceramide (GalCer; Bosio et al., 1996a), which 
GalCer sulfotransferase (GAL3ST1), the second enzyme in this 
pathway, converts into sulfatide by sulfonation reaction (Honke 
et al., 2001). There is growing evidence for the involvement of 
sulfatide in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apop-
tosis, and senescence of cancer cells (Takahashi and Suzuki, 
2012; Xiao et al., 2013). High expression of sulfatide is observed 
in several human cancer tissues, including the colon, kidney, 
lung, liver, and ovary (Takahashi and Suzuki, 2012; Xiao et al.,

2013). Significantly elevated expression of sulfatide in ovarian 
carcinomas and colorectal carcinomas predicts poor prognosis 
(Morichika et al., 1996; Makhlouf et al., 2004), suggesting a crit-
ical role for sulfatide in cancer progression. Thus, a better under-
standing of the biological functions and mechanisms of the sul-
fatide biosynthetic pathway will improve our ability to define its 
contribution to tumor progression and treatment options.
In this study, we report that UGT8 expression is dramatically 
up-regulated in BLBC and predicts poor prognosis in breast can-
cer patients. UGT8 expression provides tumorigenic and met-
astatic advantages in BLBC through activating sulfatide–αVβ5 
axis. Our study provides an understanding of how UGT8 contrib-
utes to BLBC aggressiveness, suggesting a potential prognostic 
indicator and druggable target of BLBC.
Results
UGT8 expression is up-regulated in BLBC subtype
We recently reported two metabolic enzymes, aldo-keto reduc-
tase 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) and fructose-1, 6-biphosphatase 
(FBP1), that were tightly associated with BLBC aggressiveness 
(Dong et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2017). To further acquire other clini-
cally relevant metabolic determinants required for BLBC, we sys-
tematically analyzed multiple publicly available gene expression 
datasets (NKI295, MET 
ABR 
IC, GSE25066, The Cancer Genome 
Atlas [TCGA], GSE1456, GSE7390, GSE2034, and GSE22358), 
which contain >5,000 breast cancer patients (van de Vijver et al., 
2002; Pawitan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005; Desmedt et al., 2007; 
Hatzis et al., 2011; Curtis et al., 2012; Glück et al., 2012). In addi-
tion to some previously identified genes, such as lactate dehydro-
genase B (LDHB), AKR1B1, and FBP1, we noticed that UGT8 mRNA 
expression that involved in controlling the sulfatide biosynthetic 
pathway was remarkably up-regulated in BLBC (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 
S1 A). In line with this observation, UGT8 protein expression also 
was significantly elevated in BLBC by proteogenomic analysis of 
TCGA dataset that contains 105 breast tumor samples (Fig. 1 B; 
Mertins et al., 2016). To confirm this observation, we examined 
the UGT8 level in fresh frozen breast tumor tissues. Consistently, 
the expressions of UGT8 and its downstream metabolite sulfatide 
were up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that 
is mostly also BLBC and were dramatically down-regulated in 
luminal subtype of breast cancers (Fig. 1 C). To further explore 
the association of UGT8 with basal subtype, we also analyzed 
UGT8 expression in four gene expression datasets (GSE12777, 
GSE10890, E-TABM-157, and E-MTAB-181), which contain 51, 52, 
51, and 56 breast cancer cell lines, respectively (Neve et al., 2006; 
Hoeflich et al., 2009; Heiser et al., 2012). Consistently, UGT8 
expression was significantly high in BLBC cell lines (Fig. 1 D). We 
confirmed this observation by either semiquantitative RT-PCR 
or quantitative RT-PCR in a panel of breast cancer cell lines that 
contained five luminal and five basal subtype cell lines, showing 
that UGT8 mRNA expression was much higher in BLBC cells than 
in luminal cells (Fig. 1, E and F). We further tested UGT8 protein 
expression in these cell lines. Strikingly, elevated UGT8 protein 
level was observed in BLBC cell lines (Fig. 1 G). Consistently, UGT8 
activity was much higher in BLBC cells than in luminal cells (Fig. 
S1 B), supporting that UGT8 activity positively correlates with its 
expression. Together, our data suggest that UGT8 overexpression 
is primarily restricted to BLBC.
UGT8 positively correlates with Sox10 and is a direct 
target of Sox10
Given the intimate link between UGT8 and BLBC, we next deter-
mined how UGT8 was up-regulated in BLBC. Coexpression 
analysis of UGT8 with other genes in two large gene expression 
datasets (GSE25066 and TCGA) showed that UGT8 expression 
positively correlated with Sox10 expression (Fig. 2 A). We also 
analyzed Sox10 expression in different subtypes of breast cancer, 
showing that similar to UGT8, Sox10 was dramatically up-regu-
lated in BLBC in multiple gene expression datasets (Fig. 2 B and 
Fig. S2 A). To investigate the causal relationship between UGT8 
and Sox10, we expressed Sox10 in SUM159 and MDA-MB436 
cells. Strikingly, Sox10 up-regulated UGT8 expression in mRNA 
and protein levels in all these cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). Next, 
SUM149 and HCC1428 cells with endogenous Sox10 expression 
were transfected with empty vector or shSox10 vector, show-
ing that knockdown of Sox10 expression down-regulated UGT8 
expression (Fig. S2 B). These results indicate that Sox10, as a 
transcriptional activator, may induce UGT8 expression through 
transcriptional regulation.
Having identified their tight association and immediate 
induction of UGT8 expression by Sox10, we next determined 
whether UGT8 expression was regulated directly by Sox10. We 
noticed that UGT8 promoter contained 10 putative consensus 
Sox10-binding motifs (A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G from −2,211 bp 
to transcription start site (TSS; Fig. S2 C). To investigate which 
motifs are critical for Sox10-mediated gene transcription, we 
cloned the human UGT8 promoter and created several deletion 
mutants of promoter-luciferase constructs based on the location 
of these motifs, including wtU, wtU1 and wtU2 (Fig. S2 C). By 
expressing the wtU in HeLa, SUM159, and MDA-MB436 cells, an 
approximately 3- to 15-fold increase in UGT8 promoter luciferase 
activity was observed in cells undergoing Sox10 overexpression 
(Fig. 2 F). The wtU1 without the region between −2,211 and −1,507 
bp partially lost the reporter activity (wtU1 vs. wtU), whereas 
wtU2 without the region between −2,211 and −1,050 bp did not 
further reduce the reporter activity to respond to Sox10 expres-
sion (wtU2 vs. wtU1), indicating that the regions between −2,211 
and −1,507 bp and between −1,050 bp and −274 bp are important 
for Sox10-mediated UGT8 activation (Fig. S2 C). To further eval-
uate the binding motifs inside the UGT8 promoter, several con-
structs with point mutants were generated in the UGT8-binding 
motifs (mutU1, mutU2, and mutU3; Fig. 2 E). Either the mutU1 or 
the mutU2 significantly reduced, whereas the mutU3 containing 
all mutations of both mutU1and mutU2 almost completely lost, 
the reporter activity induced by Sox10 (Fig. 2 G), suggesting that 
Sox10 activates the UGT8 promoter in a Sox10 motif–dependent 
fashion and that the motifs in the regions between −2,211 and 
−1,507 bp and between −1,050 bp and −274 bp are required for 
Sox10-mediated transcriptional activation. To further investi-
gate whether Sox10 directly bound to the UTG8 promoter, we 
performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in 
MDA-MB231 and HCC1428 cells with endogenous Sox10 expres-
sion. A dramatic enrichment of Sox10 in the UGT8 promoter was

observed in these cells (Fig. 2 H). These data suggest that UGT8 
is a direct target of Sox10.
UTG8 expression activates the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway 
and enhances breast cancer cell migration and invasion
To investigate the molecular function and mechanism of UGT8, we 
generated stable transfectants with empty vector or knockdown of 
UTG8 expression in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells and also cre-
ated stable clones with empty vector or UGT8 expression in BT549 
and HCC1937 cells (Fig. 3 B). We first examined the production of 
GalCer and sulfatide, two downstream metabolites of UGT8 in the 
sulfatide biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting data 
showed that knockdown of UGT8 expression caused a remarkable 
decrease, whereas exogenous UGT8 expression resulted in a dra-
matic increase in both GalCer and sulfatide levels (Fig. 3 C). Similar 
results were obtained in these cells by immunostaining-confocal 
analysis (Fig. 3 D and Fig. S3 A). These data suggest that UGT8 is 
required for increased GalCer and sulfatide production in breast 
cancer cells. To further understand the metabolic consequence 
of UGT8 expression, we examined the effect of UGT8 expression 
and both metabolites on breast cancer cell migration and invasion. 
Either UGT8 expression or sulfatide, but not GalCer, markedly 
induced the migration and invasion of BT549 cells in vitro (Fig. 3, E 
and F). Consistently, knockdown of UGT8 expression dramatically 
repressed the migration and invasion of MDA-MB231 and SUM159 
cells in vitro, whereas sulfatide, but not GalCer, significantly 
restored the decreased migration and invasion of MDA-MB231 and 
SUM159 cells with stable knockdown of UGT8 expression (Fig. 3, 
G and H; and Fig. S3, B and C). These data indicate an important 
role of sulfatide in UGT8-mediated acquisition of migratory and 
invasive ability in breast cancer cells.
Zoledronic acid (ZA) is a direct inhibitor of UGT8 and 
suppresses the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway and  
breast cancer cell migration and invasion
It has been speculated that ZA might be a potential inhibitor 
of UGT8 through computational modeling (Pannuzzo et al., 
2016); however, until now this possibility has not been verified

by further experiments. To further determine the relationship 
between ZA and UGT8, we first examined the effect of ZA 
on two downstream metabolites of UGT8 in the sulfatide 
biosynthetic pathway. Immunostaining-confocal analysis 
showed that ZA dramatically decreased the expression GalCer 
and sulfatide in endogenously UGT8-expressing MDA-MB231 
and SUM159 cells and ectopically UGT8-expressing HCC1937 
cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we examined whether ZA could 
directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of UGT8. An in vitro 
galactosidation assay showed that UGT8 efficiently induced 
urine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose consumption and UDP 
production, whereas ZA strongly blocked this process, 
indicating that ZA functions as a direct inhibitor of UGT8 
(Fig. 4 C). To further confirm the inhibitory effect of ZA on 
UGT8, we tested the effect of different concentrations of ZA 
on GalCer and sulfatide production in breast cancer cells 
by immunoblotting. We found that ZA efficiently blocked 
the expression of GalCer and sulfatide in a concentration 
dependent manner in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells 
(Fig. 4 D). These data demonstrate a potent inhibitory efficacy 
of ZA against GalCer and sulfatide production in breast cancer 
cells. We then evaluated the effect of ZA on breast cancer 
cell migration and invasion. As anticipated, ZA remarkably 
inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB231 and 
SUM159 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, 
E and F). These data indicate that ZA inhibits migratory and

UGT8 activates αVβ5 signaling via up-regulating sulfatide
To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying UGT8-me-
diated metabolic changes in BLBC, we performed expression 
profiling analysis of MDA-MB231 cells undergoing knockdown 
of UGT8 expression or ZA treatment. We first compared genes 
that were transcriptionally down-regulated in MDA-MB231 
cells undergoing knockdown of UGT8 expression (GSE112900) 
to that in MDA-MB231 cells treated with ZA studied previously 
(GSE33552; Vintonenko et al., 2012). KEGG pathway analysis of 
down-regulated genes showed that 7 of the top 10 most signifi-
cant KEGG pathway terms were completely consistent between 
UGT8 knockdown and ZA treatment (Fig. 5 A), indicating that 
UGT8 knockdown and ZA may share similar mechanisms to 
mediate metabolic and functional alterations.
After KEGG pathway analysis, we noticed that the most sig-
nificant pathway was related to the ECM-receptor interaction 
(Fig. 5 A). Among the genes of this pathway, ITG 
AV was noted to 
encode integrin α chain V, which is involved in multiple signaling 
pathways by combining different integrin β chains (Desgrosellier 
and Cheresh, 2010). Up-regulation of ITG 
AV is correlated with an 
aggressive phenotype in a variety of cancers (Desgrosellier and 
Cheresh, 2010). It has been reported that sulfatide up-regulates 
ITG 
AV expression (Wu et al., 2013). Consistently, UGT8 knock-
down or ZA treatment caused a remarkable decrease, whereas 
UGT8 expression led to an obvious increase of ITG 
AV expression 
in mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5, B–E). Intriguingly, sulfatide 
but not GalCer significantly elevated the expression of ITG 
AV

mRNA and protein (Fig. 5 F), further supporting that UGT8 acts 
mainly via sulfatide-mediated cellular program.
Integrins αVβ3 and αVβ5 are important malignant driv-
ers that are the most thoroughly studied in the αV subfamily 
(Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010). To understand the association 
of UGT8 with αVβ3 and αVβ5, we determined the effect of UGT8 
on αVβ3 and αVβ5 clustering. Our results showed that knock-
down of UGT8 expression or ZA treatment resulted in a signifi-
cant decrease (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas UGT8 expression led to 
a dramatic increase in αVβ5 clustering by immunostaining-con-
focal analysis (Fig. 6 C). Similar results were obtained by flow 
cytometry analysis (Fig. 6, D–F). Unexpectedly, knockdown of 
UGT8 expression or UGT8 expression only caused a slight change 
of αVβ3 clustering (Fig. S3, D and E), indicating that UGT8 func-
tions mainly via αVβ5-mediated signaling. The αVβ3 and αVβ5 
enhances cell survival through multiple mechanisms, includ-
ing p53 inactivation, increased BCL2 expression, and activation 
of TGF-β signaling, NFκB, or PI3K pathway (Desgrosellier and 
Cheresh, 2010). Given the tight association of TGF-β signaling 
and NFκB pathways with BLBC aggressiveness (Desgrosellier 
and Cheresh, 2010; Dong et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2017), we chose 
them as examples to characterize the regulatory mechanism of 
UGT8 in BLBC. As expected, knockdown of UGT8 expression 
or ZA treatment caused a dramatic decrease of Smad4, Smad5, 
p-Smad1/5/8, and ID4 levels (Fig. 6 G), and also led to a remark-
able reduction of RelA levels in both nucleus and cytoplasm 
(Fig. 6 H), supporting the involvement of UGT8 in TGF-β signal-
ing and NFκB pathway.
UGT8 promotes tumorigenicity of breast cancer
Having identified the critical association of UGT8-mediated met-
abolic alteration with oncogenic signaling in BLBC, we sought 
to evaluate the functional role of UGT8 in vitro and in vivo. We 
first tested the in vitro tumorigenicity using soft agar assay. 
Knockdown of UGT8 expression caused a remarkable decrease 
of colony-formation in MDA-MB231, SUM159, MDA-MB435, 
and MDA-MB436 cells (Fig. 7 A), whereas ectopic expression of 
UGT8 led to a significant increase of colonies in BT549, HCC1937, 
Figure 4. ZA is a direct inhibitor of UGT8 and inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion. (A and B) Expression of GalCer and sulfatide was mea-
sured by immunofluorescent staining in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells treated with or without ZA (20 µM; A), HCC1937 cells with empty vector, or stable UGT8

and BT20 cells (Fig. 7 B). We then examined the tumorigenicity 
in vivo by tumor xenograft experiments in which female SCID 
mice were injected with MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells with 
stable empty vector or knockdown of UGT8 expression. As 
shown in Fig. 7 (C and D), MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells with 
stable knockdown of UGT8 expression resulted in significantly 
decreased tumor growth compared with their corresponding 
vector control cells. To investigate the clinical implications of 
UGT8 expression for breast cancer progression, we extended 
our observations to clinicopathologically relevant parameters. 
We first assessed the UGT8 expression and its association with 
tumor size of breast cancer patients in NKI295 dataset. We segre-
gated patients into two groups according to primary tumor size, 
showing that high UGT8 expression was associated with a larger 
tumor size of breast cancer patients (Fig. 7 E). We then evalu-
ated the correlation between UGT8 expression and histological 
grades of the tumors in NKI295, GSE25066, and GSE1456 datasets 
in which tumors had been scored for tumor grade. Patients were 
separated into three groups according to histological grades of 
tumors. Our results showed that UGT8 expression was present 
predominantly in Grade 3 tumors, but less commonly in Grade 
1 and Grade 2 tumors (Fig. 7 F). These data suggest that UGT8 
functions as a critical mediator of BLBC aggressiveness.
Inhibition of UGT8 by shRNA or ZA suppresses metastasis 
of breast cancer
Because UGT8-mediated signaling was associated with cell 
migration and invasion, we reasoned that UGT8 might be crit-
ical for breast cancer metastasis in vivo. To test this notion, we 
assessed whether inhibition of UGT8 affected tumor metasta-
sis in a xenograft metastasis model in which MDA-MB231 cells 
were injected via tail vein to generate pulmonary metastases. 
Remarkably, knockdown of UGT8 expression or ZA treatment 
suppressed lung metastasis in vivo (Fig. 8, A and B; and Fig. S4 A).

We also examined the expressions of sulfatide and UGT8 in met-
astatic nodules from two group mice in Fig. S4 A. As expected, 
knockdown of UGT8 expression significantly caused a decrease 
in sulfatide expression (Fig. S4 B). These data suggest that UGT8 
is critical for metastasis of BLBC cells and that pharmacologic 
inhibition of UGT8 may prevent metastasis of BLBC cells in vivo.
Given the critical function of UGT8 expression in breast 
cancer, we then evaluated whether UGT8 expression was cor-
related with patient survival in NKI295 dataset (van de Vijver 
et al., 2002). Patients were ranked based on UGT8 expression, 
and the top quartile and the other three quartiles were compared. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high UGT8 expres-
sion had shorter overall survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), 
and distant metastasis-free survival (Fig. 8, C–E). To extend 
this observation, we used an aggregate breast cancer dataset 
with 1,754 breast cancer samples to determine its clinical rele-
vance (Györffy et al., 2010). Survival analysis demonstrated that 
tumors with an elevated UGT8 expression exhibited shorter RFS 
(Fig. 8 F). Similar result was observed by analyzing BLBC patient 
samples of this dataset (Fig. 8 G). These data support the critical 
roles of UGT8 in breast cancer aggressiveness.
Discussion
In this study, we report that inhibition of UGT8 suppresses the 
tumorigenic and metastatic capacity of BLBC cells by attenuat-
ing sulfatide–αVβ5 axis. Our study reveals several mechanis-
tic and therapeutic insights into the crucial roles of UGT8 in 
BLBC progression.
UGT8 represents a potential prognostic indicator for 
breast cancer patients and is a major downstream target 
of Sox10 in BLBC
Our results showed that UGT8 expression increased tumorige-
nicity, whereas knockdown of UGT8 expression in BLBC cells 
suppressed tumorigenicity and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

Given the tight association of UGT8 with the aggressive proper-
ties of breast cancer, it may be beneficial to evaluate the possi-
bility of UGT8 as a prognostic indicator for the assessment of the 
prognosis and the design of treatment of breast cancer patients. 
We analyzed several factors that indicate patients who are at risk 
of tumor progression, including (1) breast cancer subtypes: UGT8 
overexpression occurs specifically in BLBC; (2) tumor grade: a 
significantly higher UGT8 expression is associated with higher 
tumor grade; (3) tumor size: UGT8 overexpression is correlated 
with larger tumor size; (4) survival rate: UGT8 overexpression 
has poor survival. These results strongly suggest the potential 
use of UGT8 in prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients.
Analysis of copy number alterations across cancer genomes 
reveals that less than 0.5% of primary tumors have UGT8 
amplifications in TCGA dataset that contain 1,098 breast cancer 
patients (unpublished data), indicating the involvement of 
other genetic or epigenetic mediators in UGT8 overexpression 
in BLBC. Sox10, a transcriptional activator that in humans is 
encoded by the Sox10 gene, is also highly expressed in BLBC 
(Dravis et al., 2015). This protein as a nucleocytoplasmic 
shuttle protein is important for neural crest and peripheral 
nervous system development and tumor progression (Sarkar 
and Hochedlinger, 2013; Dravis et al., 2015). Sox10 has been 
identified to regulate several genes that are involved in the 
process of myelination, and Sox10-deficient mice exhibit defects 
in several neural crest-derived cell types as well as a failure of 
oligodendroglia to terminally differentiate and produce myelin 
(Stolt et al., 2002). Consistently, UGT8-mediated synthesis of 
GalCer and sulfatide is involved in myelin sheath development 
and function (Bosio et al., 1998), suggesting a possible link 
between Sox10 and UGT8. Indeed, our data identified Sox10 as 
a transcription inducer of UGT8 and demonstrated a positive 
correlation between the expression of Sox10 and UGT8 in two 
large breast cancer gene expression datasets, revealing that 
Sox10 is a direct transcriptional activator responsible for high 
UGT8 expression in BLBC.

UGT8 facilitates BLBC aggressiveness by activating 
sulfatide-αVβ5 axis
UGT8 is an endoplasmic reticulum–localized enzyme responsi-
ble for synthesis of GalCer from ceramide (Bosio et al., 1996c). 
Ceramide, as a substrate of UGT8, is intimately involved in the 
regulation of cancer cell growth, differentiation, senescence, 
and apoptosis (Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014). Because ceramide 
can be formed from multiple metabolic pathways, it is diffi-
cult to change its expression levels just by changing one single 
enzyme (Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014). We thus investigated two 
downstream metabolites, GalCer and sulfatide. Consistent with 
previous studies that mice lacking either UGT8 or GAL3ST1 gene 
caused an absence of sulfatide (Bosio et al., 1996b; Honke et al., 
2002), our data showed that knockdown of UGT8 expression led 
to a dramatic decrease of both GalCer and sulfatide. However, 
only sulfatide, but not GalCer, enhanced the migratory and inva-
sive ability of tumor cells, indicating the critical role of sulfatide 
in UGT8-mediated cellular program. Aberrant expression of 
sulfatide is associated with a variety of cancers (Takahashi and 
Suzuki, 2012; Xiao et al., 2013); thus, elucidating the biological 
functions of sulfatide will reveal mechanisms underlying the 
development of these diseases. Emerging evidence has demon-
strated that sulfatide induces ITG 
AV expression by enhancing its 
promoter activity (Wu et al., 2013). Our data showed that sul-
fatide, but not GalCer, promoted ITG 
AV expression and induced 
integrin αVβ5 formation. Elevated expression of integrin αVβ5 
is associated with tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor 
migration, and metastasis (Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010). 
Thus, sulfatide functions as a key signaling molecule to allow 
crosstalk between metabolic and oncogenic pathways.
Pathological examination shows that malignant cells have 
often detached from the tumor mass at the periphery of or at the 
invading front of tumor. Interestingly, integrin αVβ5 expres-
sion often confines to invasion front in many cancers (Hood 
and Cheresh, 2002). It is well documented that integrin αVβ5 
can regulate the TGF-β and NFκB pathways that are required for 
BLBC progression and metastasis (Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 
2010; Dong et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2017). Consistently, our study

tified by measuring photon flux (mean of six animals + SEM; left). Three representative mice from each group were shown (middle). Lung metastatic nodules

revealed that knockdown of UGT8 expression significantly sup-
pressed TGF-β and NFκB pathways in BLBC cells, supporting the 
crucial roles of UGT8-sulfatide–αVβ5 axis in BLBC.
Together, UGT8 expression is transcriptionally up-regulated 
by Sox10 in BLBC cells, resulting in activation of the sulfatide 
biosynthetic pathway; increased sulfatide induces integrin αVβ5 
formation, triggering TGF-β and NFκB pathways that associate 
with BLBC aggressiveness. These findings provide a link between 
UGT8-mediated metabolic flux and oncogenic signaling path-
ways, which contributes to BLBC progression (Fig. 6 I).
UGT8 is a potential druggable target for treating BLBC
Treatment of BLBC represents an unmet medical need. Despite 
extensive study, few effective drug targets have been identified 
for BLBC. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify therapeutic 
targets for this subtype of breast cancer. Given the critical 
role of UGT8 in controlling the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway 
and BLBC progression, UGT8 overexpression represents an 
oncogenic event that associated with BLBC aggressiveness; 
thus, blocking of UGT8 by small molecules or antibodies may 
provide an attractive new approach for the clinical treatment 
of BLBC. ZA is a marketed drug that has been licensed for the 
treatment of osteoporosis or bone metastasis (Zekri et al., 2014). 
Accumulating evidence indicates that ZA induces apoptosis of 
cancer cells and suppresses migratory and invasive ability of 
cancer cells (Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010). Recent clinical 
trial data showed that adjuvant use of ZA could significantly 
improve disease-free survival and reduce the risk of locoregional 
and distant recurrence in postmenopausal breast cancer patients 
with low levels of circulating female hormones (Coleman et 
al., 2011, 2014). However, the exact mechanism underlying the 
anticancer property of ZA remains unknown. Here, we identified 
that ZA is a direct inhibitor of UGT8, which can efficiently inhibit 
the enzymatic activity of UGT8 and block sulfatide production. 
Our detailed microarray analysis demonstrates that both ZA 
treatment and knockdown of UGT8 expression have highly 
similar gene expression profiles, providing strong support 
for the notion that ZA is an inhibitor of UGT8. This finding is 
especially significant because ZA may become a potentially 
valuable target drug to suppress BLBC progression. Indeed, ZA 
remarkably suppressed cancer cell migration and invasion in 
vitro, inhibited lung metastasis of BLBC cells in mice models, 
exhibiting apparent efficacy against BLBC.
Unexpectedly, ZA did not result in an apparent effect on 
tumor growth in our xenograft experiments (unpublished data), 
which is different from the UGT8 knockdown that caused dra-
matically reduced tumor growth in vivo. There are two possible 
reasons for this discrepancy. First, after injection of a single dose 
of ZA, its circulating plasma levels are short lasting (Brown et 
al., 2007). Such dosage may not suppress tumor growth, but is 
enough to inhibit tumor metastasis. Indeed, our results showed 
that ZA at relatively low concentration displayed significant 
inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Second, ZA inhibits 
the enzymatic activity of UGT8, but doesn’t affect the expression 
of UGT8. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that UGT8 has 
other functions besides its enzymatic activity. Further study is 
required to unveil this question.
Drug repositioning has been used as an efficient strategy to 
identify and develop new uses for existing drugs because marketed 
drugs have established safety profiles and pharmacokinetic data 
(Mizushima, 2011). ZA is generally safe and well-tolerated in clin-
ical trials at a dose of 4 mg every 3–4 wk or 1 yr for the treatment of 
osteoporosis or bone complications of cancer (Brown et al., 2007; 
Coleman et al., 2011, 2014). Because it can be rapidly cleared to the 
bones or kidneys within hours of intravenous treatment (Chen et 
al., 2002), repeated pulses of ZA may be required for the main-
tenance of plasma ZA concentration when the efficacy of ZA on 
tumor growth and lung metastasis is evaluated in mice model. 
Here, the mice were injected subcutaneously with ZA at a dose of 
0.0186 mg/kg/d for a consecutive 28 d, and the cumulative dosage 
of ZA in mice is approximately equivalent to a single dose of 4 mg 
in humans, according to the conversion of animal doses to human 
equivalent doses based on body surface area. Significantly, this 
clinically achievable dosage of ZA remarkably suppressed lung 
metastasis of BLBC cells, displaying potent inhibitory effect and 
indicating that the optimal dose and frequency of ZA should be 
considered in future clinical trials. More than 40 clinical trials 
have been performed to investigate the potential anticancer activ-
ity of ZA (Coleman et al., 2011, 2014; Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ 
Collaborative Group, 2015); however, few clinical trials mainly 
focus on TNBC or BLBC. Recently, two retrospective studies from 
randomized trials of ZA plus chemotherapy versus chemother-
apy alone demonstrated that a trend favoring ZA treatment was 
observed in TNBC that is mostly also BLBC despite relatively small 
sample size of TNBC patients in both studies (including 34 and 
103 cases, respectively; Hasegawa et al., 2015; Kroep et al., 2016). 
Our study and these retrospective findings strongly support the 
translational value of ZA as a direct inhibitor of UGT8, and TNBC 
or BLBC might be the most promising subtype to be effectively 
treated with additional ZA. Together, the adoption of ZA is wor-
thy of further exploration because in contrast to commonly used 
chemotherapy and adjuvant therapies; it has relatively lower tox-
icity and may be more acceptable for cancer treatment. Our study 
provides a proof of principle that UGT8 is a potentially valuable 
therapeutic target against BLBC and that pharmacological inhibi-
tion of UGT8 by ZA offers a promising opportunity for the clinical 
treatment of this challenging disease.

Cell culture
MDA-MB231, SUM159, MDA-MB435, and MDA-MB436 cells 
were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. 
HCC1937 and BT549 cells were grown in RPMI1640 plus 10% 
FBS. BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 
10% FBS and insulin (5 µg/ml). For establishing stable transfec-
tants with UGT8 expression, BLBC cells were transfected with 
pLVX-UGT8; stable clones were selected with puromycin (300 
ng/ml) for 4 wk.
Immunostaining
Experiments were performed as described previously (Dong et 
al., 2013). Cells were grown on chamber slides, fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde, and incubated with primary antibodies. Sec-
ondary antibodies used were Texas red–conjugated goat anti–
mouse or FITC-conjugated goat anti–rabbit (Molecular Probe).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specific quan-
titative RT-PCR experiments were performed using SYBR 
green Power Master Mix following manufacturer’s protocol 
(Applied Biosystems).
Luciferase reporter assay
Experiments were performed as described previously (Lin et al., 
2010; Dong et al., 2012). All experiments were performed three 
times in triplicate.

described recently (Dong et al., 2012).
Lipid extraction
Lipids from 100 mg of cells were extracted in 2 ml of chloroform, 
4 ml of methanol, and 1.6 ml of water. The extraction was set in 
a constant temperature shaker (40°C) overnight. After the cell 
residues were separated by centrifugation, the solvents were 
evaporated using a stream of nitrogen. The pooled extracts then 
were resolved in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1; vol/vol). 
Phospholipids were decomposed by mild alkaline hydrolysis for 
2 h at 40°C using 200 µl of 1 M KOH. After cooling, the samples 
were neutralized using glacial acidic acid. Changing the solvent 
ratio to methanol/chloroform/water (2:2:1.8; vol/vol/vol) caused 
a phase separation, with chloroform in the lower phase. After the 
chloroform phase was evaporated, the residue was solubilized in 
chloroform/methanol (1:1; vol/vol), and then was submitted for 
immunoblotting analysis.
Immunoblotting of tumor samples
The tumor samples were collected from resected breast tumors 
from patients with informed consent. The experiments were 
performed according to the approved guidelines established by 
the institutional review board at the Zhejiang University (Hang-
zhou, China). The sample was homogenized using 20 strokes 
of a Dounce homogenizer in 1 ml of homogenizing buffer. After 
centrifugation, the pellet was collected. For the detection of pro-
teins, the resuspended pellet in Laemmli buffer was boiled and 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred onto 
PVDF membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the detection 
of sulfatide and GalCer, the extracted lipids from the pellet were 
spotted onto PVDF membranes. Immunoreactive blots were visu-
alized by chemiluminescence.
Flow cytometry
Cells were washed twice and suspended with 1 ml PBS and then 
incubated with 5 µl LM609-αVβ3 antibody or P1F6-αVβ5 anti-
body at 4°C for 30 min. After two washes with PBS, the cells were 
collected by centrifugation (350 RCF, 5 min) and incubated with 
1 ml Alexa Fluor 488 anti–mouse IgG mAb at 4°C for 30 min in 
the dark. After two washes with PBS, the stained cells were sus-
pended in 500 ml PBS, and detected by Cytomic FC 500MCL.
Enzyme assays
In vitro activity assay of UGT8 was performed in a final volume 
of 120 µl with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM calcium chloride, 10 mM 
manganese chloride, lysate from MDA-MB231 cells, 0.6 mM 
aglycone substrate, and 1.2 mM UDP sugar. The reactions were 
performed with the addition of cell lysates at 37°C for 1 h and 
then were terminated with the addition of 200 µl ethanol. 
After filtering, supernatants were subjected to HPLC system, 
consisting of C18 reversed-phase column (5 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm) 
and a UV detector. The chromatography was performed with 
10.5% acetonitrile and 89.5% 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer 
containing 10 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide as ion pair 
reagent. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the UV detection was 
operated at 260 nm.
Colony formation assay
Colony formation assay was performed using double-layer soft 
agar in 24-well plates with a top layer of 0.35% agar and a bottom 
layer of 0.7% agar. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates in desired 
medium and cultured at 37°C for 15–20 d, and the colonies were 
stained and counted.
Migration and invasion assays
Migration and invasion assays were performed as described 
previously (Lin et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2012). All experiments 
were performed at least twice in triplicate. Statistical analysis 
was performed using the Student’s t test; a p-value of <0.05 was 
considered significant.
Tumorigenesis assay and lung metastasis model
Animal experiments were performed according to procedures 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at 
the Zhejiang University. To examine the effect of UGT8 on tum-
origenesis, female SCID mice (5–8 wk old) were injected with 106 
exogenous UGT8 knockdown cells on the left flank and vector 
control cells on the right flank. For evaluation of the drug, mice

were injected with MDA-MB231 cells (106 cells/mouse) on the 
left flank of every mouse; ZA (0.0186 mg/kg/d) was adminis-
tered subcutaneously and sterile PBS was used as vehicle control. 
Tumor formation was monitored every 2 to 4 d for 30 d. Tumors 
size and weight were measured. To test the effect of UGT8 on 
tumor metastasis, SCID mice were injected with MDA-MB231 
cells (106 cells/mouse) with stable empty vector or knockdown 
of UGT8 expression via tail vein (six mice/group). To evaluate 
the drug efficacy, mice were injected with MDA-MB231 cells 
(106 cells/mouse) via tail vein (six mice/group), and received ZA 
(0.0186 mg/kg/day) or sterile PBS as vehicle control subcutane-
ously. After 4 wk, lung metastasis was analyzed by an IVIS-100 
imagining system (Xenogen). After mice were sacrificed, lung 
metastatic nodules were detected in paraffin-embedded sections 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Data were analyzed using 
the Student’s t test; a p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD or SEM as indicated. Com-
parisons were made by the two-tailed Student’s t test or one-way 
ANO 
VA. Correlations between UGT8 and Sox10 were analyzed 
by Pearson’s correlation method and Spearman’s rank correlation 
test. Survival curves were performed using the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and differences were analyzed by the log-rank test. In all
