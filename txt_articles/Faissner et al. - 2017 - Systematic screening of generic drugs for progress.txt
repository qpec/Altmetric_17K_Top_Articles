The treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is unsatisfactory. One reason is that the
drivers of disease, which include iron-mediated neurotoxicity, lymphocyte activity, and oxi-
dative stress, are not simultaneously targeted. Here we present a systematic screen to
identify generic, orally available medications that target features of progressive MS. Of 249
medications that cross the blood–brain barrier, 35 prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity in
culture. Of these, several antipsychotics and antidepressants strongly reduce T-cell pro-
liferation and oxidative stress. We focus on the antidepressant clomipramine and found that
it additionally inhibits B-lymphocyte activity. In mice with experimental autoimmune ence-
phalomyelitis, a model of MS, clomipramine ameliorates clinical signs of acute and chronic
phases. Histologically, clomipramine reduces inflammation and microglial activation, and
preserves axonal integrity. In summary, we present a systematic approach to identify generic
medications for progressive multiple sclerosis with the potential to advance rapidly into
clinical trials, and we highlight clomipramine for further development.

 M
ultiple sclerosis is a multifactorial inflammatory con-
dition of the CNS leading to damage of the myelin
sheath and axons/neurons followed by neurological
symptoms1. Approximately 85% of multiple sclerosis patients
present with a relapsing-remitting phenotype and the majority of
these evolve to a secondary-progressive disease course after 15–20
years. 10–15% of the patients experience a primary progressive
disease course with slow and continuous deterioration without
definable relapses.
While there have been tremendous successes in the develop-
ment of medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
during the last decade, nearly all studies conducted in progressive
multiple sclerosis have failed such as the recently published
INFORMS study on the sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor fin-
golimod2. However, the results of two Phase 3 trials of ocrelizu-
mab in primary progressive3 and siponimod in secondary
progressive multiple sclerosis4 were announced recently to have
met their primary outcomes. Orcelizumab has since been
approved for use in primary progressive MS.
The reasons for the general lack of medications in progressive
multiple sclerosis are manifold. One explanation is that the
underlying pathology of progressive multiple sclerosis has pro-
found differences to the relapsing-remitting form5. Examples
include the more pronounced neurodegenerative aspects of the
progressive disease in conjunction with significant mitochondrial
damage6,7, iron accumulation which contributes to the elevated
oxidative stress from several sources8,9, and the more common
representation of B-cell follicular structures underneath the
meninges in progressive cases10,11. Moreover, the blood–brain
barrier in progressive multiple sclerosis appears to be repaired
compared to the breach in relapsing-remitting disease5, so med-
ications will require the capacity to enter the CNS.
Another pathologic feature seen in all types of multiple sclerosis
but appears exacerbated in progressive cases is intense focal
microglia activation5,12,13. We previously conducted a systematic
screen on microglia inhibition using the drug library of the NINDS
Custom collection II (US Drug Collection); the majority of com-
pounds in this library are generic medications. Out of 1040 com-
pounds, 123 reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
production by activated microglia by over 50%14. Based on this
research, we expanded our screen to investigate other features
relevant to progressive multiple sclerosis, including the potential of
generic compounds to affect iron-mediated neurotoxicity, main-
tain mitochondria integrity, and scavenge free radicals. We sought
also to shortlist a compound for further activity against T-
lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, given that the adaptive immune
response continues to be active within the CNS compartment in
progressive multiple sclerosis15, and we sought to interrogate
whether the compound affects experimental autoimmune ence-
phalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Out of 249 investigated
medications, 35 prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture.
Out of these, several reduced the proliferation of T-lymphocytes
and had antioxidative potential. The tricyclic antidepressant clo-
mipramine also affected B-lymphocyte proliferation, reduced
clinical signs in acute EAE concomitant with improved histology,
and improved the chronic phase in two EAE models.
Results
Generics protect against iron and rotenone neurotoxicity. Of
the 1040 compounds available in the NINDS Custom Collection
II, we first conducted a search of available information to exclude
those that were either experimental, agricultural, not available as
oral drug, not listed at Health Canada, steroid hormones or
veterinary medications. Moreover, we omitted those that were not
known to cross the blood–brain barrier. We note that while we
selected drugs that are orally available, for ease of use, this does
not imply that injectable medications would not be effective
medications in progressive multiple sclerosis, as illustrated by
ocrelizumab recently3. Out of the original list, 791 compounds
were thus excluded and 249 were selected for further testing. The
detailed information of each of the 249 compounds is provided in
Supplementary Dataset 1.
The 249 compounds were first tested against iron toxicity to
human neurons in culture. Neurons were pre-incubated with
each compound for 1 h followed by application of FeSO4. Ferrous
iron (25 and 50 μM) is very toxic to neurons, with >80% loss of
microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2)-labeled neurons by
24 h in most experiments compared to the control condition
(Supplementary Figs. 1–7, Supplementary Data set 2). An
example of iron toxicity and a drug screen is shown in Fig. 1.
Of all drugs tested, 35 compounds showed statistically significant
protection from FeSO4-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. 2a). Of these,
antipsychotics, such as clozapine or periciazine, and tricyclic
antidepressants, such as clomipramine or desipramine, exhibited
strong protection, as shown after normalization across at least
2–4 experiments (n of four wells of cells per experiment per test
condition) to the number of neurons of the respective control
conditions (Fig. 2a). For example, while the average loss of
neurons over 24 h in response to FeSO4 was 85.5% (i.e., 14.5% of
surviving neurons compared to 100% of controls), clomipramine
at 10 μM completely prevented neuronal loss (107.3% of
controls). Other categories of medications with neuroprotective
actions
against
iron
included
antihypertensives
and
some
antibiotics. We note that minocycline, an antibiotic that reduces
the conversion of a first demyelinating event to clinically definite
multiple sclerosis in a Phase 3 clinical trial, was not included in
the 1040 compounds; in a separate study, we find minocycline to
completely prevent iron neurotoxicity as well16.
Live-cell imaging over 12 h supported the neuroprotective
effects of drugs. We selected indapamide and desipramine for live
imaging studies. Figure 2b and Supplementary Video 1 show that
while the number of neurons with intracellular propidium iodide
(PI), a dye that leaks across a compromised plasma membrane, in
response to FeSO4 exposure increases progressively over 12 h, this
was significantly attenuated by indapamide and desipramine.
The 35 hits were further narrowed concerning their ability to
cross the blood–brain barrier according to drugbank.ca, their side
effect profile and tolerability. Although antipsychotics are not well
tolerated they were further included in the screening due to their
good blood–brain barrier penetrance. Out of these, a group of 23
compounds was chosen for their ability to prevent mitochondrial
damage using rotenone, which inhibits the electron transfer from
complex I of the respiratory chain to ubiquinone. Rotenone
induced strong neurotoxicity to neurons (Fig. 3). The tricyclic
antidepressant trimipramine, the antipsychotics clozapine and
periciazine, promethazine and the antihypertensives labetalol,
methyldopa
and
indapamide
reduced
neurotoxicity,
while
clomipramine trended toward a protective activity (Fig. 3a).
The effect size of rescue by medications was, however, small. Of
note, rotenone induced marked morphological neuronal changes
with retraction of neurites (Fig. 3c).
Hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of medications. The
biochemical
cell-free
hydroxyl
radical
antioxidant
capacity
(HORAC) assay investigates the prevention of hydroxyl radical-
mediated oxidation of fluorescein in comparison to the strong
antioxidant gallic acid. The generation of hydroxyl radicals by a
cobalt-driven Fenton-like reaction oxidizes fluorescein with pro-
gressive loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant
reduces the loss of fluorescence over time. As noted in Fig. 4a,

 gallic acid reduced the loss of fluorescence (upward shift) com-
pared to a blank Fenton-driven reaction that is without anti-
oxidant, while indapamide has an even higher activity.
We compared the area under the curve of test compounds to
that elicited by gallic acid to obtain the gallic acid equivalent
(GAE). A GAE of 1 represents hydroxyl radical scavenging
capacity similar to that of gallic acid, while a compound without
antioxidant activity would produce a GAE close to 0. Some of the
compounds tested exhibited stronger antioxidative properties
than gallic acid with HORAC-GAEs >1 (Fig. 4c). These included
indapamide (mean HORAC-GAE 4.1; p < 0.05; one-way ANOVA
with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis vs.
gallic acid), mitoxantrone (5.6; p < 0.001), chlorpromazine (5.9; p
< 0.001), clozapine (4.6; p < 0.05), and trimipramine (4.2; p <
0.05). Although not statistically significant compared to gallic
acid, clomipramine had a HORAC-GAE of 2.1. Regarding the
comparison to the blank condition (i.e., no antioxidant present),
there was a significant upward shift by clomipramine of the slope
over 60 min (p < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's
multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis) (Fig. 4b). Thus,
although clomipramine lacked significance against the strong
antioxidative
gallic
acid,
the
compound
exhibited
strong
antioxidative effects against the blank situation (in the absence
of any antioxidant). Interestingly, the tricyclic antidepressant
desipramine had strong oxidative effects (HORAC-GAE −5.00; p
< 0.0001).
Proliferation of T-lymphocytes is reduced by antidepressants.
We tested the capacity of compounds to affect T-cell proliferation
(Fig. 5). Splenocytes activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 to trigger
the proliferation of T-cells had reduced incorporation of 3[H]-
thymidine upon treatment with dipyridamole (mean reduction
89.3%; p < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple
comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated
splenocytes), cefaclor (23%; p < 0.01), labetalol (26.8%, p < 0.0001
for this and subsequent compounds listed here), mefloquine
(62.3%), mitoxantrone (99.7%), trimeprazine (43.3%), chlorpro-
mazine (99.4%), periciazine (28%), promethazine (74.6%), clo-
mipramine (68.2%), desipramine (92.2%), imipramine (66.4%),
trimipramine (54%), and doxepin (85.3%, all p < 0.0001). Of note,
methyldopa and memantine increased proliferation (methyldopa
41.4%, p < 0.0001; memantine 17.5%, p < 0.05). Mitoxantrone
and chlorpromazine, however, had toxic effects (data not shown).

 As indapamide did not reduce T-cell proliferation, we did not
pursue it further in the T-cell prominent disease, EAE.
Focus on clomipramine in vitro and in acute and chronic EAE.
We selected clomipramine for further study as it is a well-
tolerated antidepressant and crosses the blood–brain barrier very
well (drugbank.ca). Moreover, in our assays, clomipramine
showed
strong
effects
against
iron-mediated
neurotoxicity
(mean % anti-MAP-2-positive cells normalized to control of
107.3%, representing complete protection against iron toxicity)
(Fig. 2), had antioxidative properties (HORAC-GAE 2.1 where
the effect of the antioxidant gallic acid is normalized at 1) (Fig. 4),
and reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation (by 68.2%) (Fig. 5). We
began with a concentration response with the intent of investi-
gating lower concentrations since plasma concentration in human
of clomipramine as an antidepressant average 122 ng/ml (387
nM)17, but can peak to more than 600 nM in some individuals18.
Figure 6a shows that clomipramine had a progressive significant
increase in neuroprotection against iron toxicity from 100 nM.
The effect was mediated in part by chelation with iron, as washing
away clomipramine from neurons led to cell death, while pre-
incubation with iron before application to neurons totally pre-
served neuronal viability (Fig. 6b). We were able to observe the
protection by clomipramine in a live-cell imaging study, in which
the increasing number of PI-positive neurons over time in
response to iron was attenuated by clomipramine (Fig. 6c, Sup-
plementary Video 2).
T-lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in a concentration-
dependent manner by clomipramine but significant reduction
occurred only from 5 µM (p < 0.01; one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis
compared to activated T-lymphocytes) (Fig. 6d). This was
reflected by a cell cycle arrest with more cells in G1 (p < 0.05)
and less in the S-phase (p < 0.05) from 2 µM (Fig. 6e, f).
Due to the growing knowledge about the importance of B-cell
follicular structures for progressive multiple sclerosis19,20, we
sought to evaluate the effect of clomipramine on B-cell activation.

Fig. 2 Summary of compounds that attenuate iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Shown are all 35 generic drugs that prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity (a).
The number of neurons in each well of a given experiment was normalized to the number of neurons of the respective untreated control condition (100%).
The corresponding FeSO4-treated condition (red) was also normalized to the respective control. Some of the major drug classes are depicted in the figure.
Shown are the mean ± SEM of 2–4 independent experiments, performed in quadruplicates (thus, 8–16 wells per treatment across experiments are depicted
in the figure). b shows the results from live-cell imaging of neurons (see examples in Supplementary Video 1), challenged with FeSO4 in a concentration of
50 µM. Upon pre-treatment with indapamide or desipramine 1 h before the addition of iron, the number of propidium iodide-positive cells was significantly
reduced after 7.5 h and even below the level of the untreated control condition after 12 h, suggesting a strong neuroprotective effect. Live-cell imaging was
performed over 12 h, where images were taken every 30 min. The time-point from which significant changes from FeSO4 were observed for each group is
marked with a symbol (# control; + DMSO; * indapamide; ~ desipramine). Shown are means ± SEM of n = 3 wells per condition. Results were analyzed with

 were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomi-
pramine from 2 µM.
We then investigated clomipramine in acute EAE. Therapy
with clomipramine from day 5 after induction of MOG-EAE
delayed onset of clinical signs by 2 days with a significantly better
early disease course between days 11 and 18 (Fig. 7a), which was
reflected in an overall lower burden of disability (Fig. 7b).
However, eventually, clomipramine-treated animals succumbed
to EAE and increased disability (Fig. 7a).
We then sought to investigate whether initiation of treatment
from the day of MOG-induction could improve the outcome of
EAE. Remarkably, early treatment initiation completely sup-
pressed the manifestation of clinical signs (Fig. 8a). While most
animals in the vehicle group had a high disease burden, as shown
by the sum of scores for each individual animal (Fig. 8b) and
weight loss (Fig. 8c), this was profoundly ameliorated in treated
mice over the course of study. PCR analyses of the spinal cord
revealed that the significant elevation in vehicle-EAE mice of
transcripts encoding Ifng, Tnfa, Il-17, and Ccl2 were abrogated in
clomipramine-EAE mice (Fig. 8d).
Investigation of serum levels of clomipramine and its active
metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (DMCL), in mice sacrificed 1 h
after the last of 16 daily clomipramine injections showed mean
concentrations of 751 and 101 nM, respectively (Fig. 8e). Incredibly,
the corresponding mean spinal cord levels were 28 and 1.5 μM; a
similar high brain to plasma ratio of clomipramine was reported by
Marty et al.21 in mice injected with a single 8 mg/kg clomipramine
IP. There was a strong correlation of serum and spinal cord levels for
both clomipramine and DMCL across mice (Fig. 8f).
Histological analysis of the
spinal cord
showed profound
parenchymal
inflammation
in
vehicle-treated
animals
with
a
histological score of 4.3, whereas clomipramine-treated animals only
had few inflammatory cells in the meninges (score 1.7; p < 0.001; non-
parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. 9a, b, g) that were
inadequate to produce clinical manifestations as noted in Fig. 8a.
Infiltration in vehicle-treated animals was accompanied by massive
microglial activation, whereas clomipramine treatment prevented
microglial activation, as assessed by Iba1 staining (p < 0.01) (Fig. 9c, d,
h). Furthermore, clomipramine-treated animals had significantly less
axonal damage (p < 0.01) (Fig. 9e, f, i). Infiltration and microglial
activation correlated with axonal injury (Spearman r = 0.7599, p <
0.01; Spearman r = 0.774, p < 0.01, respectively; non-parametric two-
tailed Spearman correlation with 95% confidence interval) (Fig. 9j, k).
We next set out to investigate the effect of clomipramine in chronic
EAE. We first evaluated clomipramine initiated only after the first
relapse when mice were in remission (day 31). In our hands, using the
more sensitive 15-point EAE scoring system (rather than the
conventional 5-point scale), MOG-EAE mice can be documented to
undergo a second relapse after a remission period. Clomipramine did
not affect the severity of the second relapse when initiated in mice at
remission (Fig. 10a), likely because substantial neural injury had
already occurred from a prolonged EAE course.
In another experiment, we treated MOG-immunized C57BL/6
mice from the first onset of clinical signs (day 13, Fig. 10b).
Treatment with clomipramine attenuated the marked rise in
clinical disability and had a significant positive effect during days
14–20 (p = 0.0175; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney
test). During remission, likely because the severity of disability
was low, the vehicle and clomipramine-treated groups did not
differ. Disease was then followed by a second increase in clinical
scores in vehicle-treated mice, which was prevented by clomi-
pramine (days 42–50; p = 0.0007).

of the test compound over 60 min in comparison to 12.5 µM gallic acid and blank. Shown are data of n = 3–4 independent experiments ±SEM, with each
experiment performed in triplicates (c). The antipsychotics showed strong antioxidative effects, as demonstrated with HORAC GAEs of >3. Data points >1

 Another model of chronic EAE, thought to model secondary
progressive multiple sclerosis22,23, is immunization with spinal
cord homogenate (SCH) in the Biozzi ABH mouse. Clomipra-
mine treatment was started at the onset of clinical signs where it
reduced clinical severity throughout the period of treatment (p =
0.0062) (Fig. 10c).
In summary, clomipramine reduced clinical severity in acute
and chronic EAE in two different mouse models. Figure 10d
schematizes that the initiation of clomipramine treatment from
onset of clinical signs of EAE attenuates the clinical disability
observed during relapses or in chronic disease.

Fig. 6 Clomipramine reduces iron neurotoxicity and proliferation of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Clomipramine attenuated iron-mediated
neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner from 100 nM (p < 0.05) (a). Washing away clomipramine led to cell death by iron, but this effect could
be prevented after pre-incubation of clomipramine with iron, suggesting a physical reaction between clomipramine and iron (b). Live-cell imaging studies
show that the increasing accumulation of PI-positive neurons exposed to iron over time was prevented by clomipramine (c). Clomipramine furthermore
reduced the proliferation of T-lymphocytes (d), reflected by a reduction of cells in S-phase and an increase in the G1-phase of the cell cycle (e, f).
Proliferation of activated B-cells was reduced by clomipramine from 2 µM (g), correspondent with reduced TNF-α release (h). Data are shown as
quadruplicate replicate wells of an individual experiment that was conducted twice (a, d, e, f), once (b) or three times (g, h); c represents triplicate wells of
one experiment. Results are mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to the FeSO4 or

 explanation is the lack of directed actions of medications against
features that drive the pathophysiology of progressive multiple
sclerosis, and the lack of consideration of penetration of agents
into the CNS. The latter is important as the blood–brain barrier
appears relatively intact in progressive compared to the relapsing-
remitting form5, and pathogenic processes ongoing within the
CNS may not be amendable to periphery-acting medications. To
circumvent these challenges, we have employed bioassay screens
that model aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we
have opted to test generic medications that have data of good
access into the CNS.
One pathogenic hallmark important for the progression of
multiple sclerosis is iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Iron accumu-
lates in the CNS age dependently and iron deposition con-
comitant with T-cell infiltration and the expression of inducible
nitric oxide synthase in microglia in the deep gray matter cor-
relates with progression and is associated with neurodegenera-
tion24. The deposition of iron amplifies inflammation and
exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative stress,
eventually leading to neurodegeneration25. Targeting iron is thus
considered a promising therapeutic approach in progressive
multiple sclerosis. Based on a screen of potential microglial
inhibitors performed by our group14, we investigated the poten-
tial of promising generic compounds to prevent iron-mediated
neurotoxicity. Out of 249 compounds screened, 35 medications
which prevented against iron-mediated neurotoxicity were in the
drug classes of antidepressants (n = 5), antibiotics (n = 4), anti-
psychotics (n = 3), antimalarials (n = 2), and others. Some of the
drugs had consistent outstanding neuroprotective effects, and
these included antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants. The
high number of antipsychotics and antidepressants as positive
hits in the screening was striking. In addition to the rescue effect
against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, several drugs showed pro-
mising results in other modes of toxicity; these were desipramine,
clozapine, indapamide, and labetalol which were active against
damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Data were cor-
roborated by the investigation of antioxidative potential and the
influence on splenocyte proliferation. Clomipramine showed
outstanding effects in several in vitro settings such as against
iron-mediated neurotoxicity, hydroxyl scavenging capacity, and
inhibition of T-cell and B-cell proliferation; in mice, clomipra-
mine treatment suppressed occurrence of disease in EAE com-
pletely, concomitant with reduced transcripts of chemotactic and
inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, reduced inflammation,
microglial activation, and preservation of axons. Moreover, clo-
mipramine ameliorated clinical signs in chronic EAE in two
different EAE models, C57BL/6 and Biozzi ABH mice.
The work presented here constitutes a systematic approach to
identify generic compounds that could be useful for the treatment
of progressive multiple sclerosis. First, we focused on ameliorat-
ing major hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis such as
iron-mediated neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune cell
proliferation. Second, we chose generic drugs which are available
as oral formulations. The drugs have a well-known safety profile,
as there exists long-lasting experience in research and clinical use.
Third, safety studies in patients with multiple sclerosis for these
generic compounds will have to be conducted but they do not
have to be exhaustive; thus, their translation into phase II and III
clinical trials can be expedited.
The screening approach herein has limitations, which should be
addressed. First, the screening was limited to a circumscribed
number of generic medications contained within the NINDS
library; it was fortunate that we found several hits to pursue. A
second limitation is that due to the high number of compounds
tested, only one concentration (10 µM) was investigated for the
majority of compounds. This may lead to misses, as higher or lower
concentrations of a particular drug may have to be administered in
humans to reach effectiveness. A third limitation is the lack of a
well-accepted animal model of progressive multiple sclerosis to test
the promising drugs identified from the tissue culture studies. We
utilized the acute EAE model as proof of concept for a drug’s
effectiveness in vivo followed by investigation in chronic EAE in
C57BL/6 mice and Biozzi ABH EAE. While treatment from
remission after the first relapse might not have been successful due
to marked damage induced during the early phase of EAE, positive
effects with early treatment during chronic disease in two models
support potential effectiveness in human. Another limitation was
the statistical analysis of the chronic experiments. Due to sponta-
neous remission of vehicle-treated animals, statistical significance
would have been masked had the whole experiment been analyzed
as a group, since vehicle-treated animals along with clomipramine-
treated mice remitted to a very low disease score between days 25
and 42 (Fig. 10b). Hence, for statistical analyses, we focused on the
differences of the acute and chronic relapse phases outside of the
period of remission (Fig. 10b), as this would be more meaningful
for a drug’s utility in MS.

 As no models of EAE are strongly suited for all aspects of
progressive multiple sclerosis, we hope that the results of the
current study will lead to a clinical trial in the ultimate test
subjects: patients with progressive multiple sclerosis.
Another limitation of the screening approach was the sequence
of the tests employed, beginning with amelioration of iron-
induced neurotoxicity to effects on T-cells. This sequence is not a
reflection of which pathophysiology is most important for pro-
gressive multiple sclerosis, but simply because the protection of
neurons against death in culture was an easily observed (through
microscopy of living neurons) and therefore obvious outcome.

 Fig. 8 Early clomipramine treatment suppressed EAE disease activity. Female C57BL/6 mice (age 8–10 weeks) were treated with clomipramine IP
(25 mg/kg) or PBS (vehicle) from the day of induction of MOG-EAE (day 0). From day 11 the clinical course differed significantly (p < 0.05); while vehicle-
treated mice accumulated progressive disability, clomipramine-treated mice remained unaffected even up to the termination of the experiment when
vehicle-treated mice were at peak clinical severity (paralysis or paresis of tail and hind limb functions and paresis of forelimbs) (a). The overall burden of
disease per mouse was plotted in b, while the relative weight of mice, reflecting general health, is shown in c. In the lumbar cord at animal sacrifice (day
15), there was a significant upregulation in vehicle-EAE mice of transcripts encoding Ifng, Tnfa, Il-17, and Ccl2 compared to naïve mice, whereas
clomipramine-treated mice did not show these elevations (d). Levels of clomipramine and the active metabolite desmethylclomipramine in serum and
spinal cord at sacrifice (e) are consistent to concentrations reached in humans. There was a strong correlation of serum levels of clomipramine and
desmethylclomipramine with spinal cord levels (f). Data in d are RT-PCR results, with values normalized to Gapdh as housekeeping gene and expressed in
relation to levels in naïve mice. n = 8 vehicle and n = 7 clomipramine EAE mice. Data are depicted as mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-

Fig. 9 Reduced inflammation and axonal damage upon clomipramine treatment. Vehicle-treated animals had marked parenchymal inflammation, indicated
by an arrow (a), whereas clomipramine-treated animals only had low meningeal inflammation (b). This was reflected in better histological scores (g)
evaluated by a previously described method54 (a, b: Hematoxylin/eosin and luxol fast blue, HE and LFB). Vehicle-treated animals had pronounced
microglial activation (Iba1 stain, c), which was accompanied by axonal damage with formation of axonal bulbs (indicated by an arrow, Bielschowsky
stain, e). Clomipramine treatment reduced microglial activation concomitant with preserved axonal integrity (d, f). This was reflected in a blinded rank

 candidates might have emerged. Nonetheless, through the
sequence that we employed, a testable medication in patients with
multiple
sclerosis,
clomipramine,
has
emerged.
Moreover,
although a larger library could have been used, the NINDS col-
lection was the largest grouping of generic medications available
at the time of our study. We reiterate our focus on generics as
their potential to advance faster into clinical studies is much
higher, given that there would be knowledge of their spectrum of
side effects in human use.
Some of the compounds that prevented iron-mediated neuro-
toxicity in our screen have been described previously to have
neuroprotective properties and will be highlighted here, as they
may be of interest not only to progressive multiple sclerosis but
also other CNS disorders with neurodegenerative features. Strong
neuroprotective effects were induced by tricyclic antidepressants.
The antidepressant desipramine has been used in a Huntington's
disease model where it inhibited glutamate-induced mitochon-
drial permeability at the concentration of 2 µM and led to reduced
apoptosis of primary murine neurons26,27. Furthermore, desi-
pramine induces the antioxidative enzyme heme-oxygenase 1 in
Mes23.5 dopaminergic cells and increases Nrf2 accumulation in
the nucleus, thus preventing neuronal cell death mediated by
rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine28. We could not confirm the
inhibition of rotenone-mediated cell death in our study of pri-
mary human neurons and we did not choose to pursue desipra-
mine further as it promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals in
the HORAC assay. In murine EAE, desipramine reduces CCL5 in
cortical
homogenates
and
positively
affects
anxiety-related
behavior but not clinical signs29. Of interest, efficacy of desipra-
mine in depression in multiple sclerosis has been shown in a
Cochrane analysis and was associated with fewer adverse effects
than paroxetine30.
Besides desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants had strong
effects
against
splenocyte
proliferation.
Imipramine,
which
showed
good
neuroprotective
properties,
enhances
PEP-1-
catalase in astrocytes, leading to neuroprotection in the hippo-
campal CA1 region in an ischemia model31. Additionally, it
prevents apoptosis of neural stem cells by lipopolysaccharide,
mediated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and mitogen-
activated protein kinase pathway32. Another novel compound
recently developed, quinpramine, which is a fusion of imipramine
and the antimalarial quinacrine, decreased the number of

Fig. 10 Clomipramine improves the chronic phase of EAE. a Female C57BL/6 (age 8–10 weeks) MOG-immunized mice were treated with clomipramine IP
(25 mg/kg) or PBS (vehicle) from remission after the first relapse, and this did not affect disease score between the groups (n = 10 vehicle, n = 10
clomipramine). b In a second experiment, MOG-immunized C57BL/6 mice were treated from onset of clinical signs. Here, clomipramine reduced the
clinical severity of the first relapse (day 14–20, p = 0.0175, two-tailed Mann–Whitney t-test) and of the second relapse at the late chronic phase (day
42–50, p = 0.0007, two-tailed Mann–Whitney t-test) (n = 5 vehicle, n = 6 clomipramine). Note that an initial two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-
comparisons test of the experiment from day 13–50 was not statistically significant, since vehicle-treated mice spontaneously remitted to a very low
disease score between days 25 and 42, so that differences with the treatment group could not be detected. Hence, we analyzed differences of the acute
and chronic relapse phases outside of the period of remission, using Mann–Whitney t-test. c Using Biozzi ABH mice, treatment from onset of clinical
disability showed a positive effect on the chronic phase (p = 0.0062, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) (n = 5 vehicle, n = 5 clomipramine). When a two-way
ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-comparisons test was used, the results were not significant since the individual variability of mice in either group in any given
day was very high for this model in our hands. d A summary of the effect of clomipramine when treatment is initiated at the onset of clinical signs

 inflammatory CNS lesions, antigen-specific T-cell proliferation
and pro-inflammatory cytokines in EAE33.
Due to structural similarities between clomipramine, imipra-
mine, and trimipramine it may be speculated that these compounds
may be relevant for trials in progressive multiple sclerosis. Fur-
thermore, we showed previously that doxepin reduces microglial
activation to 46% without inducing toxicity; clomipramine, how-
ever, did not have microglia inhibitory activity14. In the synopsis of
effects contributing to progressive multiple sclerosis, tricyclic
antidepressants are interesting for further development and might
even be suitable as combination therapy with other compounds
targeting features of progressive multiple sclerosis.
Some antipsychotics also displayed strong protection against
iron and oxidative stress. Clozapine has been described to reduce
microglial activation through inhibition of phagocytic oxidase-
generated reactive oxygen species production, mediating neuro-
protection34. The strong antioxidative properties of clozapine in
the HORAC assay support these results. Due to the side effect
profile with enhanced risk of agranulocytosis, we refrained from
usage in EAE; nevertheless, in multiple sclerosis patients with
psychiatric comorbidities and eligible for antipsychotic treatment,
it may be reasonable to use clozapine.
With regard to liothyronine, atenolol or carvedilol that pre-
vented iron-mediated neurotoxicity beyond levels of controls,
these do not penetrate the CNS (probability of 68% for all three,
drugbank.ca) as well as clomipramine (97.9% chance for entering
the CNS according to drugbank.ca). Thus, we did not explore
their utility in EAE.
Mitoxantrone is used in some countries as a treatment for pro-
gressive multiple sclerosis, but has so far not yet been described as
being neuroprotective. Although the blood–brain barrier perme-
ability probability is poor (0.7979), it may be postulated that the
effect in progressive multiple sclerosis, in addition to its toxic effects
on T-lymphocytes, is induced by its capacity to limit iron-mediated
neurotoxicity. Indapamide exhibited strong neuroprotective effects
against iron toxicity in culture, which has not yet been described
previously. More interestingly, indapamide also overcomes mito-
chondrial damage. As indapamide has no effect on T-lymphocyte
proliferation, the drug may not overcome acute-EAE, but may be
interesting in longer-term multiple sclerosis models such as the
Biozzi ABH mouse model, which shows immune cell-independent
neurodegeneration35 and a chronic disease course22.
We opted to test clomipramine in the acute-EAE model due to its
strong effects on immune cells, its antioxidative properties and its
prevention against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Clomipramine is a
tricyclic antidepressant which is used to treat depression, obsessive
compulsive disorder and panic disorders, usually in a dosage of
100–150 mg/d, sometimes up to 300 mg/d. It inhibits serotonin and
norepinephrine
uptake.
Clomipramine
reduces
the
seizure
threshold and overdose can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, hypo-
tension, and coma (drugbank.ca). Usually, clomipramine is well
tolerated, but side effects include among others increase in weight,
sexual dysfunctions, sedation, hypotension and anticholinergic
effects such as dry mouth, sweating, obstipation, blurred vision,
and micturition disorder (according to the manufacturer leaflet).
Clomipramine crosses readily into the CNS with a probability to
cross the blood–brain barrier of 0.979 according to predicted
ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity)
features (drugbank.ca). Clomipramine reduces the production of
nitric oxide and TNF-α in microglia and astrocytes36; the authors
reported neuroprotective properties in a co-culture model of
neuroblastoma cells and microglia. Clomipramine increases the
uptake of cortisol in primary rat neurons37 and promotes the
release of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in glioblastoma
cells, suggesting a protective effect on neurons38. The drug has been
also studied in experimental autoimmune neuritis, where it
decreases the number of IFN-γ secreting Th1 cells and ameliorated
the clinical course39.
Clomipramine has been used previously in mice in different
dosages to study conditions such as antinociception (0.5 mg/kg)40,
Chagas disease (7.5 mg/kg)41, and neurotransmitter and histone
deacetylase expression (50 mg/kg)42. In humans taking clomi-
pramine as an antidepressant, mean serum levels after a mean
daily intake of 127 ± 91 mg/d have been reported to be 122 ng/ml
(387 nM, considering a molecular weight of 314.9)17. Of note,
clomipramine levels after oral intake in humans have a wide
range, leading to plasma concentrations of more than 600 nM in
some individuals18, which is in the range of neuroprotection
against iron in our in vitro experiments. The injection of 20 mg/
kg IP in CD1 mice leads to peak plasma concentrations of 438 ng/
ml (1.4 μM) with a half-life of 165 min21 and in our experiments
animals (sacrificed 1 h after the last injection) had mean serum
clomipramine concentrations of 236.5 ng/ml (751 nM). These
plasma levels are close to the ones measured in humans (average
of 387 nM, and up to 600 nM18), especially keeping in mind that
plasma levels drop faster in mice due to the relatively bigger liver:
body mass and that the half-life of clomipramine in humans is
between 17.7 and 84 h43 compared to about 2.5 h in mice. We
found that clomipramine levels in the spinal cord of the EAE-
afflicted mice averaged an incredibly high 28 µM; levels achieved
in the brains of humans are not known. Thus, the dosage of 25
mg/kg clomipramine tested in our EAE study reflects standard
doses used in humans in that both attain similar plasma levels.
In summary, we discovered several generic compounds in this
systematic screening approach that exhibit neuroprotective
properties against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Additionally,
some of those compounds prevent mitochondrial damage to
neurons, inhibit immune cell proliferation, and show anti-
oxidative capacities. They may thus be interesting for further
development in progressive multiple sclerosis, and other neuro-
degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's
and Parkinson's disease. Tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics,
and indapamide may be useful for further development in pro-
gressive multiple sclerosis due to their manifold properties. Clo-
mipramine showed particular promise due to its capacity to
reduce iron-mediated neurotoxicity and T-cell and B-cell pro-
liferation, its antioxidative effect, and its complete suppression of
disease in acute-EAE and positive effects in chronic EAE. As these
features are relevant in progressive multiple sclerosis, we propose
clomipramine for a trial in the unmet need of progressive mul-
tiple sclerosis.
Methods
Cell culture and treatment of human neurons. Human neurons were isolated
from brain tissues of therapeutically aborted 15–20-week-old fetuses, in accordance
with ethics approval of the University of Calgary ethics committee, after written
informed consent of the pregnant donors. Neurons were isolated as follows in
brief44: brain specimens were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove
blood, followed by removal of meninges. Tissue was mechanically dissected, fol-
lowed by digestion in DNase (6–8 ml of 1 mg/ml; Roche), 4 ml 2.5% trypsin and 40
ml PBS (37 °C, 25 min). Thereafter, the digestion was stopped by addition of 4 ml
fetal calf serum. The solution was filtered through a 132 µm filter and centrifuged
(three times, 1200 rpm, 10 min). Cells were cultured in feeding medium of minimal
essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 µM sodium
pyruvate, 10 µM glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.1% dextrose, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (all culture supplements from Invitrogen, Burlington,
Canada). The initial isolates of mixed CNS cell types were plated in poly-L-
ornithine-coated (10 µg/ml) T75 flasks and cultured for at least two cycles44 in
medium containing 25 µM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada)
to inhibit astrocyte proliferation and to deplete this major contaminating cell type.
For experiments, the neuron-enriched cultures were re-trypsinized and cells were
plated in poly-L-ornithine pre-coated 96-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/
well in 100 µl of the complete medium supplemented with cytosine arabinoside.
Medium was changed to AIM V® Serum Free Medium (Invitrogen) after 24 h.
After a period of 1 h, respective drugs were added in a concentration of 10 µM,
followed by application of FeSO4 or rotenone after 1 h. All conditions were

 performed in quadruplicates. A day later cells were fixed using 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde and stored in PBS at 4 °C.
We note that in tissue culture, the toxicity of iron to neurons begins
immediately. Thus, it has been our experience that pretreatment with test
protective agents is necessary. With the continuous insult that occurs in multiple
sclerosis, a pretreatment paradigm with test compounds against iron neurotoxicity
in our experiments can be justified as that simulates the protection against the next
injury in the disease.
Drugs tested were contained within the 1040-compound NINDS Custom
Collection II, which was purchased from Microsource Discovery (Gaylordsville,
CT, USA) and used as previously described14. Briefly, there were 80 compounds
located in specific wells on each plate (e.g., B07). 3B07 would thus refer to position
B07 of plate 3. Each compound was supplied at a concentration of 10 mM dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
The iron stock solution was prepared using 27.8 mg iron(II) sulfate
heptahydrate (FeSO4) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada), 10 μl of 17.8 M sulfuric
acid, and 10 ml deionized distilled water. After filtering with a 0.2 µm filter, FeSO4
was added to cells in a final concentration of 25–50 µM in a volume of 50 µl
medium to the cells. Rotenone was dissolved in DMSO and used in a final
concentration of 10 µM.
HORAC assay. Selected compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity
were analyzed for their antioxidative properties using the HORAC assay, in
accordance with the procedure outlined in Číž et al45. In this assay, hydroxyl
radicals generated by a Co(II)-mediated Fenton-like reaction oxidize fluorescein
causing loss of fluorescence46. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of
fluorescence and this can be monitored every 5 min over a period of 60 min with a
Spectra Max Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and
the software SoftMax Pro version 5. For monitoring fluorescence, we used an
excitation wavelength of λ = 485 nm and an emission wavelength of λ = 520 nm.
Proliferation of T-lymphocytes. A previously published protocol was used for
isolating and activating T-cells47. Spleens from female C57BL/6 mice were har-
vested and after mechanical dissociation the cell suspension was passed through a
70 µm cell strainer and separated by Ficoll gradient (1800 RPM, 30 min). Sple-
nocytes were plated (2.5 × 105 cells in 100 µl/well) in anti-CD3 antibody-coated 96-
well plates (1000 ng ml−1 plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1000 ng ml−1 anti-CD28
suspended in media) to activate T-cells. Directly before plating, wells were treated
with respective drugs in a final concentration of 10 µM. Cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM
L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 0.05 mM 2-
mercaptoethanol (all supplements were from Invitrogen). After 48 h, 3H-thymidine
was added in a concentration of 1 µCi per well, and cells were harvested after 24 h
on filter mats. Mats were then evaluated for radioactivity (counts per minute, cpm)
using a liquid scintillation counter.
Activity on B-lymphocytes. Venous blood from healthy volunteers was obtained
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll gradient
centrifugation (1800 RPM, 30 min). From PBMCs, B-cells were isolated by positive
selection with CD19-directed microbeads (Stemcell Technologies). Purity was
assessed by FACS after staining for CD19 (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were
plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in X-VIVO™ medium (Lonza)
supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% Glutamax and treated with
drugs for 1 h. Cells were then activated with 10 µg/ml IgM BCR cross-linking
antibody (XAb) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1 µg/ml anti-CD40L and IL-4 20 ng/
ml for 24 h as described previously48. Conditioned media were harvested after 24 h
for ELISA. Medium as well as respective drugs were re-added followed by appli-
cation of 3H-thymidine in a concentration of 1 µCi per well to investigate pro-
liferation. After 24 h, cells were harvested on filter mats and after drying cpm were
measured using a liquid scintillation counter.
Flow cytometry. Two days after activation and drug treatment splenocytes were
harvested, washed with PBS followed by resuspension in PBS with 2% FBS. Cell
cycle analysis was performed taking advantage of PI staining using an established
protocol49. Cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in PI/Triton X-100
staining solution (10 ml 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS with 2 mg DNAse-free
RNAse A and 0.4 ml of 500 µg/ml PI), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min.
Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur™ with the software CellQuest™
(BD Biosciences). Cell cycle analysis was conducted using the software ModFit LT,
version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.). Cells were identified by gating into the
lymphocyte population, followed by single cell gating to exclude doublets and
aggregates. This was followed by identification of the G0/G1 population and
processing with the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.)
to calculate the percentage of cells in different cell cycles.
Immunocytochemistry and microscopy. Staining was performed at room tem-
perature. A blocking buffer was first introduced for 1 h followed by incubation with
primary antibody overnight in 4 °C. Neurons were stained using mouse anti-MAP-
2 antibody, clone HM-2 (dilution 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number M4403,
species mouse). Primary antibody was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 or 546-
conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (dilution 1:250, Invitrogen, Bur-
lington, Canada). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst S769121 (nuclear yellow).
Cells were stored in 4 °C in the dark before imaging.
Images were taken using the automated ImageXpress® imaging system
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) through a 10× objective microscope lens,
displaying 4 or 9 sites per well. Images were analyzed with the software
MetaXpress® (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the algorithm
“multiwavelength cell scoring”50. Cells were defined according to fluorescence
intensity and size at different wavelengths. Data from all sites per well were
averaged to one data point.
Live-cell imaging. Neurons were prepared as described above. Directly after the
addition of FeSO4 to healthy neurons, the live cell-permeant Hoechst 33342 (1:2
diluted in AIM-V medium, nuclear blue; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island,
NY, USA) and the live cell-impermeable PI (1:20 diluted in AIM-V medium) were
added in a volume of 20 µl (Sigma-Aldrich). In compromised cells, PI could now
diffuse across the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging was performed using the
automated ImageXpress® imaging system under controlled environmental condi-
tions (37 °C and 5% CO2). Images were taken from nine sites per well at baseline
and then every 30 min for 12 h. After export with MetaXpress®, videos were edited
with ImageJ (NIH) in a uniform manner. Nuclei were pseudo colored in cyan, PI-
positive cells in red.
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. EAE was induced in 8–10-week-
old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Montreal, Canada). Mice were injected
with 50 µg of MOG35–55 (synthesized by the Peptide Facility of the University of
Calgary) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented
with 10 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis subcutaneously on both hind flanks on
day 0. In addition, pertussis toxin (300 ng/200 µl; List Biological Laboratories,
Hornby, Canada) was injected intraperitoneal (IP) on days 0 and 2. Animals were
treated with clomipramine (25 mg/kg; 100 µl of 5 mg/ml solution) by IP injection
from day 0 or day 5 (Figs. 7, 8), from day 30 at remission (Fig. 10a), or from 13 at
onset of clinical signs (Fig. 10b). The solution of clomipramine was prepared daily
in PBS.
The Biozzi ABH mouse model22 was used as a model of progression. EAE was
induced in Biozzi ABH mice aged 8–10 weeks by the subcutaneous application of
150 µl emulsion in both sides of the hind flanks22. The emulsion was prepared as
follows: Stock A consisted of 4 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant mixed with 16
mg M. tuberculosis and 2 mg M. butyricum. 1 ml of stock A was mixed with 11.5
ml incomplete Freund's adjuvant to become stock B. Stock B was mixed in equal
volume with SCH in PBS before injection. SCH was used in a concentration of 6.6
mg/ml emulsion each for 2 injections (days 0 and 7).
The number of animals was chosen according to experience with previous
experiments (Fig. 7: 8/8 (vehicle/clomipramine); Fig. 8: 8/7; Fig. 10a 10/10; b 5/6; c 5/
5), and animals were randomized after induction of EAE. Animals were handled
according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care and the guidelines of the animal
facility of the University of Calgary. All animal experiments received ethics approval
(AC12–0181) from the University of Calgary’s Animal Ethics Committee. Mice were
scored daily using a 15-point scoring system, the investigator was not blinded51.
Histological analyses. 1 h after the last administration of clomipramine animals
were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, blood was taken by an intracardiac
puncture for serum, and animals were then subjected to PBS-perfusion. Spinal
cords and cerebella were removed. The thoracic cords were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin, followed by embedding in paraffin. Cervical and lumbar cords were snap
frozen. Tissue was further processed as previously described52. Briefly, the thoracic
spinal cord was cut longitudinally from the ventral to the dorsal side with sections
of 6 µm thickness. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Iba1 (dilution
1:250; Wako, catalog number 019-18741, species rabbit) to visualize microglia and
Bielschowsky’s silver stain to visualize axons. Sections for Iba1 and Bielschowsky's
silver stain were blinded, before images depicting area of maximal microglial
activation or axonal damage were chosen for blinded rank order analysis by a
second investigator.
PCR. Lumbar spinal cords were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored in −80 °C. Samples were homogenized in 1 ml Trizol followed by the
addition of 200 µl chloroform. The suspension was shaken, centrifuged (11,500
RPM for 15 min at 4 °C) and the RNA-containing upper phase was transferred into
a new tube and precipitated with equal amounts of 70% ethanol. RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction
(Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). cDNA preparation was performed using the RT2 First Strand kit
(Qiagen) with 1 µg of RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time
PCR was performed using the QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems by Life
Technologies) with FAST SYBR Green and primers for Gapdh (Qiagen) as
housekeeping gene, Ifn-γ (Qiagen, QT01038821), Tnfa (Qiagen, QT00104006), Il-
17 (SABiosciences, PPM03023A-200), and Ccl2 (Qiagen, QT00167832). Relative

 expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method with Gapdh as housekeeping
gene. Data were normalized to gene expression in naïve mice.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The assay is a modifica-
tion of the LC-MS assay of Shinokuzack et al53. For preparation of samples, 100 μl of
ice cold methanol were added to 100 μl of serum in each sample after addition of the
internal standard maprotiline. The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min
followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 4 min. An equal amount of distilled water
was added to each supernatant. Spinal cord samples were each homogenized in 10
volumes of ice-cold 80% methanol. 20 μl of o-phosphoric acid were added to all
samples after addition of internal standard (maprotiline). The tubes were vortexed
and left on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 4 min and an
equal volume of distilled water was added to each supernatant.
An HLB Prime μelution plate was employed for sample cleanup for both
serum and spinal cord samples. After running the supernatants described above
through the wells, all wells were washed with 5% methanol in water and allowed
to dry completely before elution with 100 μl 0.05% formic acid in methanol:
acetonitrile (1:1). The eluents were transferred to low volume μl glass inserts
(Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and 10 µl from each eluent were injected into the
LC-MS system.
Analyses were conducted with a ZQ Mass detector - 2695 Separations module
from Waters. The control of instrument, and the acquisition and processing of
results were enabled by Mass Lynx 4.0 software. HPLC runs were processed by a
3 μm, 3.0 × 100 mm Atlantis dC18 column with similar material for the guard
column. The mobile phases A and B were 0.05% formic acid constituted in water
and acetonitrile respectively. The procedure started with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min
comprising of 80% of A and 20% of B. This was elevated in 15 min to 80% B and
then restituted to starting conditions. The sample cooler and column heater were
maintained at 4 and 30 °C, respectively. The optimized positive electrospray
parameters had specifications of 1.2V Rf lens voltage; 3.77 kV capillary voltage;
110 °C source; 300 °C desolvation temperature; 80 L/h cone gas flow (nitrogen) and
300 L/h of desolvation nitrogen gas flow. Cone voltage was varied for each
compound: clomipramine 25 V; N-desmethylclomipramine 22 V; and maprotiline
25 V. The m/z ratios for clomipramine, N-desmethylclomipramine, and
maprotiline (internal standard) were 315, 301, and 278, respectively.
Calibration curves consisting of varying amounts of authentic clomipramine
and N-desmethylclomipramine and the same fixed amount of maprotiline as added
to the samples being analyzed were run in parallel through the procedure described
above and the ratios of clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine to
maprotiline were used to determine the amount of drug and metabolite in the
serum and spinal cord samples.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the Graphpad Prism
software version 7 (La Jolla, CA, USA). For cell culture experiments, one-way ANOVA
with different post hoc analyses was applied, as stated in the respective figure legends.
EAE scores were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison
as post hoc analysis or non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Sum of scores
and rank order analysis were analyzed with the non-parametric two-tailed
Mann–Whitney test. Animal weight and drug levels were analyzed with an unpaired
two-tailed t-test. Correlations of drug levels were calculated using a linear regression
model. Correlations of rank order analyses were performed using non-parametric two-
tailed Spearman correlation. Statistical significance was considered as p < 0.05 (*), p <
0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***), and p < 0.0001 (****). All experiments were performed in
quadruplicates, if not otherwise specified.
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors upon reasonable
request.
