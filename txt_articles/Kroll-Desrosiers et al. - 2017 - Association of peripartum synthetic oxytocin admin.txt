Abstract
Background—Due to its potent effects on social behavior, including maternal behavior, oxytocin 
has been identified as a potential mediator of postpartum depression and anxiety. The objective of 
this study was to examine the relationship between peripartum synthetic oxytocin administration 
and the development of depressive and anxiety disorders within the first year postpartum. We 
hypothesized that women exposed to peripartum synthetic oxytocin would have a reduced risk of 
postpartum depressive and anxiety disorders compared with those without any exposure.

 Methods—Population-based data available through the Massachusetts Integrated Clinical 
Academic Research Database (MiCARD) was used to retrospectively (2005–2014) examine this 
relationship and calculate the relative risk of peripartum synthetic oxytocin for the development of 
postpartum depressive and anxiety disorders in exposed (n=9,684) compared to unexposed 
(n=37,048) deliveries.
Results—Among deliveries to women with a history of prepregnancy depressive or anxiety 
disorder, exposure to peripartum oxytocin increased the risk of postpartum depressive or anxiety 
disorder by 36% (RR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.20–1.55). In deliveries to women with no history of 
prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder, exposure to peripartum oxytocin increased the risk of 
postpartum depressive or anxiety disorder by 32% compared to those not exposed (RR: 1.32; 95% 
CI: 1.23–1.42).
Conclusions—Contrary to our hypothesis, results indicate that women with peripartum 
exposure to synthetic oxytocin had a higher relative risk of receiving a documented depressive or 
anxiety disorder diagnosis or antidepressant/anxiolytic prescription within the first year 
postpartum than women without synthetic oxytocin exposure.
INTRODUCTION
Postpartum depressive and anxiety disorders are diagnosed in up to 12.9% and 20.4% of 
women, respectively (Austin et al., 2010; Gaynes et al., 2005; Reck et al., 2008; Vesga-
Lopez et al., 2008), and adversely affect mothers and their offspring (Earls, 2010; Goodman, 
2007). Postpartum depression has an effect on maternal functioning and can be fatal; 
maternal suicide accounts for up to 20% of deaths in depressed postpartum women (Lindahl, 
Pearson, & Colpe, 2005). For offspring, maternal postpartum depression is associated with 
difficult infant and childhood temperament (Britton, 2011; Feldman et al., 2009), attachment 
insecurity (Forman et al., 2007), developmental delays (Deave, Heron, Evans, & Emond, 
2008), changes in cognitive development (Azak, 2012; Murray & Cooper, 1997; Sohr-
Preston & Scaramella, 2006), and difficulties with social interaction (Downey & Coyne, 
1990). Postpartum anxiety is associated with infant irritability, poor infant sleep, and 
breastfeeding difficulty (Jover et al., 2014).
Despite negative impacts on both mother and child, the pathophysiology of postpartum 
depressive and anxiety disorders is poorly understood, with relatively few animal models 
(Perani & Slattery, 2014). Due to its role in the modulation of social behavior, especially 
affiliative bonding, oxytocin has been identified as a potential mediator of postpartum 
depression and anxiety (Sohye Kim et al., 2014)(Kim et al., 2014). Animal studies document 
a relationship between oxytocin and expressions of normal maternal behavior (Finkenwirth, 
Martins, Deschner, & Burkart, 2016; Nephew, 2012; Rilling & Young, 2014), as well as with 
animal models of postpartum psychiatric disorders (Babb, Carini, Spears, & Nephew, 2014; 
Murgatroyd & Nephew, 2013; Perani & Slattery, 2014) and the effects of labor induction on 
offspring neural development (Hashemi et al., 2013). This preclinical literature suggests that 
the use of synthetic oxytocin in the peripartum period may have long-term effects on mood 
in both mothers and their offspring and led to the recent introduction of oxytocin 
manipulations as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of postpartum psychiatric 
disorders (Aleeca F. Bell, Erickson, & Carter, 2014; Kim et al., 2013; Strathearn, 2011).

 In humans, maternal plasma levels of oxytocin are associated with maternal gaze, 
vocalizations, and affectionate contact (Feldman, Weller, Zagoory-Sharon, & Levine, 2007), 
as well as maternal representations of attachment (Aleeca F. Bell, et al., 2014; Levine, 
Zagoory-Sharon, Feldman, & Weller, 2007). Two clinical studies have found that low 
antepartum blood oxytocin levels are correlated with postpartum depression (Skrundz, 
Bolten, Nast, Hellhammer, & Meinlschmidt, 2011; A. M. Stuebe, Grewen, & Meltzer-Brody, 
2013), and related work reports an association between prepartum depression and low 
oxytocin (L. Garfield et al., 2015).(Garfield et al., 2014). Genetic analyses indicate that 
postpartum depression may be mediated by epigenetic variation in oxytocin receptor 
expression (A. F. Bell et al., 2015), and a similar relationship is observed in non-maternal 
depressed women (Reiner et al., 2015). Failed lactation (A.M. Stuebe, Grewen, Pedersen, 
Propper, & Meltzer-Brody, 2011) and symptoms of depression are associated with 
differences in oxytocin activity (A. M. Stuebe, et al., 2013), and it has been postulated that 
endogenous oxytocin may protect against the adverse depressive effects of psychosocial 
stress on mothers (Zelkowitz et al.). A recent review underscores the importance of 
reproductive and perinatal stage in associations between oxytocin and depression (Suena H 
Massey, Backes, & Schuette, 2016). Despite these clinical observations and interest in 
oxytocin as a treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety, there has been little 
investigation of the potential effects of clinical peripartum manipulation through the use of 
synthetic oxytocin.
Synthetic oxytocin has been used since the 1950’s (Fields, Greene, & Franklin, 1959), and 
current indications for use include labor induction or augmentation and prevention or 
treatment of postpartum hemorrhage (“ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 107: Induction of 
labor,” ACOG 2009). Between 1990 and 2012, rates of labor induction increased from 9.5 to 
23.3% (Osterman & Martin, 2014), with rates as high as 42% in some populations (Laughon 
et al., 2012). Rates of labor augmentation are estimated at 57% (Declercq, Sakala, Corry, & 
Applebaum, 2007). However, recent recommendations, including those from the World 
Health Organization, indicate the use synthetic oxytocin as the first line agent in the active 
management of the third stage of labor for hemorrhage prevention (Westhoff, Cotter, & 
Tolosa, 2013; WHO, 2012), and it is conceivable that most or all women giving birth will 
soon have some synthetic oxytocin exposure.
The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between peripartum synthetic 
oxytocin administration and the development of depressive and anxiety disorders within the 
first year postpartum. We hypothesized that women exposed to peripartum synthetic 
oxytocin would have a reduced risk of postpartum depressive and anxiety disorders 
compared with those without exposure. To retrospectively examine this relationship, we 
utilized population-based data available through the Massachusetts Integrated Clinical 
Academic Research Database (MiCARD) which included data from peripartum patients 
who received intravenous synthetic oxytocin between 2005 and 2014 at University of 
Massachusetts Memorial Health Care (UMMHC).

 METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
This was an analysis of data from a clinical data repository of patients who delivered a 
single live born infant at UMMHC between January 2, 2005 and April 4, 2014. Protected 
health information (PHI) was accessed using individual medical record numbers provided by 
the MiCARD query tool, the UMMHC implementation of the Informatics for Integrating 
Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) platform for clinical research (Murphy et al., 2010). Through 
MiCARD, variables of interest were extracted from databases including Allscripts™, 
Soarian® Clinical Electronic Medical Records, Meditech, Payer, and IDX schedule data; all 
centralized electronic medical record software solutions used by UMMHC facilities. 
Additional data was obtained from Quantitative Sentinel (QS, General Electric Centricity 
Perinatal), a software product utilized for both outpatient and inpatient perinatal care.
Study Sample
Participants were identified at the delivery level, where each delivery was considered a 
separate unit in our analysis. Deliveries were selected based on the following inclusion 
criteria: live born singleton deliveries, coded with any of the eligible delivery codes (Table 
1), to females between the ages of 15–50. Multiple gestation deliveries (i.e., twins, triplets, 
or higher order multiples) were excluded from the study. Deliveries were identified using 
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases 9th 
Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. We considered the first delivery to each woman in our 
dataset as her “index delivery.” Depression and anxiety data included any diagnosis 
information and/or documentation of clinically relevant antidepressant or anxiolytic 
medication prescription (Table 1). The University of Massachusetts Medical School 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study.
Indication of exposure to synthetic oxytocin was for any peripartum clinical indication 
within two weeks of delivery date, including but not limited to contraction stress tests, labor 
augmentation or induction by oxytocin when natural labor had or had not begun, and 
postpartum hemorrhage prevention and treatment. Delivery data was present in the databases 
as early as 1995; however, the availability of oxytocin exposure information began in 2005, 
thus dictating our use of the 2005–2014 timeframe. Controls included deliveries without 
record of exposure to synthetic oxytocin, while cases were defined as deliveries with 
exposure to synthetic oxytocin treatment.
Initially, data were set up longitudinally where each delivery could exist across many records 
due to multiple diagnosis codes assigned to any one delivery. We removed any delivery 
records that had the same patient ID, event date, delivery code, and treatment (+/− synthetic 
oxytocin). This excluded 17,584 delivery records. CPT and ICD-9 delivery codes are 
conventionally used to designate deliveries that occur after 20 weeks gestational age, as 
deliveries occurring prior to 20 weeks gestation are considered abortions, whether 
spontaneous, elective, therapeutic, or otherwise. As a pregnancy due date is based on 40 
weeks gestation but some can extend post-dates with the vast majority being delivered by 42 
weeks gestation, we considered a ‘birth interval’ to minimally be 22 weeks (154 days)

 between delivery dates for each unique ID. Any delivery codes that existed within 154 days 
of each other for the same woman were considered part of the same delivery. After applying 
this birth interval filter, we excluded an additional 43,254 delivery records, likely part of the 
same delivery or hospital stay with delivery codes recorded on multiple/subsequent days. 
Finally, we excluded any records not meeting our eligibility criteria that were not flagged 
upon initial data query. This removed 532 deliveries where the maternal age at delivery was 
less than 15 and 861 deliveries where the maternal age at delivery was greater than 50.
Our final analytic sample included 46,732 unique deliveries (from 35,978 women); 37,048 
deliveries without peripartum synthetic oxytocin exposure and 9,684 deliveries with 
peripartum synthetic oxytocin exposure (Figure 1). The delivery and psychiatric datasets 
were merged using an individual patient identifier available across datasets.
Quantitative Variables
We classified depressive or anxiety disorders, defined as record of diagnosis and/or receipt 
of antidepressant or anxiolytic medication prescription, into three timeframes: prepregnancy: 
diagnoses/prescriptions greater than one year prior to the index delivery (diagnosis/
prescription prior to (delivery date – 365 days)); pregnancy: diagnosis/prescription during 
pregnancy, or occurring between 40 weeks prior to delivery date (delivery date – 280 days) 
and delivery date; and postpartum: diagnosis/prescription one year following delivery 
(delivery date + 365 days) or 280 days between multiple deliveries (delivery date + 280 
days). We retained any depressive or anxiety diagnosis or receipt of psychotropic medication 
prescription with a service date falling within any of these windows.
Psychiatric diagnosis ICD-9 codes were grouped into categories for analysis: 1) Adjustment 
disorder (various types) (309, 309.1, 309.24, 309.28, 309.89, 309.9); 2) Depressive disorder 
- Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) (311); 3) Major depressive disorder (MDD), various types 
(296.2, 296.21, 296.22, 296.23, 296.24, 296.25, 296.26, 296.3, 296.31, 296.32, 296.33, 
296.34, 296.35, 296.36); 4) Episodic mood disorder (296.99); 5) Anxiety states (300.09); 6) 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (300.02); 7) Anxiety Disorder – Not Otherwise 
Specified (NOS) (300.00); 8) Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (309.81); and 9) Panic 
Disorder, with or without agoraphobia (300.01). Codes for adjustment disorders were 
included in the analysis due to variations in coding practices (Fiest et al., 2014). We 
examined the frequency of depressive or anxiety disorders in each of our three timeframes.
Additionally, we created a flag to distinguish caesarean and vaginal deliveries in the 24,099 
delivery records coded with at least one CPT code. Caesarean deliveries were indicated with 
CPT codes 59510, 59514, 59515, 59618, 59620, and 59622; vaginal deliveries with CPT 
codes 59400, 59409, 59410 59610, 59612, and 59614.
Finally, we included the following covariates to examine descriptively, for our total sample 
as well as by oxytocin exposure group: maternal age, marital status (single, married, 
divorced/separated, and widowed), and race and ethnicity, all recorded at the time of data 
pull (October 2015), with the exception of maternal age which was recorded at the time of 
the event. We also included year of delivery grouped into five-year intervals as an additional 
covariate.

 Statistical Analysis
As our primary interest was to examine the association between oxytocin exposure and 
postpartum depressive or anxiety disorder, we calculated the relative risk and 95% 
confidence interval of postpartum depressive or anxiety disorder by oxytocin exposure, 
using the postpartum timeframe. To confirm that we only identified new cases of a 
depressive or anxiety disorder following delivery, we split our sample by the presence or 
absence of a history of prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder and ran two separate 
relative risk calculations: 1) the relative risk in index deliveries (as available in the database) 
to women with a history of a prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder; and 2) the relative 
risk for any delivery to women without a history of a prepregnancy depressive or anxiety 
disorder. We then compared relative risk by mode of delivery (vaginal and cesarean).
Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our initial 
findings. We replicated our analysis on our total sample in two subsets: first, by selecting a 
random delivery from each woman in our sample; and next, by repeating our analysis on all 
index deliveries (as available in the database), regardless of prepregnancy depressive or 
anxiety disorder history. We also repeated our analyses to examine the effect of depression 
or anxiety disorders diagnosed during pregnancy. Finally, we varied the 40-week definitions 
for our pregnancy and postpartum timeframes to 37 and 42 weeks (259 and 294 days, 
respectively). This was done to account for the vast majority of range of deliveries given our 
inability to determine gestational age at delivery.
All analyses were conducted in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Descriptive Data
The average onset of postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients who received 
a diagnosis or prescription was 112.52 days (+/− standard deviation 111.35). The median 
amount of time between delivery and diagnosis/prescription receipt was 71 days, suggesting 
that 50% of our patients received their diagnosis/prescription within just over 2 months 
following delivery. Descriptive data can be found in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Main Results
Results from the risk comparison models showed that relative risks (RR) and their associated 
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were higher in women with peripartum exposure to 
synthetic oxytocin across all subgroups. In index deliveries to women with a history of 
prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder (or documentation of antidepressant or 
anxiolytic prescription), exposure to peripartum oxytocin increased the risk of postpartum 
depressive or anxiety disorder by 36% (RR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.20–1.55) (Table 3). In 
deliveries to women with no history of prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder, 
exposure to peripartum oxytocin increased the risk of postpartum depressive or anxiety 
disorder by 32% compared to those not exposed to peripartum oxytocin (RR: 1.32; 95% CI: 
1.23–1.42) (Table 4).

 In index deliveries to women with a history of prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder, 
the relative risk of postpartum depressive or anxiety disorder was higher in women who 
received peripartum synthetic oxytocin compared to those who did not for both vaginal (RR: 
1.45; 95% CI: 1.22–1.72) and cesarean (RR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.00–1.91) deliveries. In 
deliveries to women with no history of prepregnancy depressive or anxiety disorder, 
exposure to synthetic oxytocin increased the relative risk of postpartum depressive or 
anxiety disorder by 19% in vaginal deliveries and 25% in cesarean deliveries compared to 
those not exposed (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.07–1.32 and RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.05–1.49, 
respectively. Data not shown.)
Sensitivity Analyses
When selecting a random delivery from each woman, regardless of prepregnancy depressive 
or anxiety disorder history, the relative risk of postpartum depressive or anxiety disorder was 
35% higher in women who received peripartum synthetic oxytocin compared to those who 
did not (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.26–1.44).
When calculating relative risks in all index deliveries, relative risks remained similar, with a 
39% increased risk of postpartum depressive or anxiety disorder in deliveries to women with 
exposure to peripartum synthetic oxytocin compared to deliveries to women with no 
exposure to peripartum synthetic oxytocin (RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.30–1.49).
Additionally, we examined the relative risks for only patients with an onset of depressive or 
anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, to determine if they would be more likely to have a 
postpartum episode regardless of synthetic oxytocin administration. Controlling for 
depressive or anxiety diagnoses during pregnancy resulted in a relative risk of 0.90 (0.77–
1.05), suggesting no increased risk in the postpartum. Removing these deliveries from the 
main analysis resulted in a relative risk of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.32–1.51), confirming that 
episodes during pregnancy did not influence our findings.
Lastly, examining the full term delivery spectrum of 37–42 weeks did not change the results 
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Contrary to our hypothesis, our results indicate that women with peripartum exposure to 
synthetic oxytocin had a higher relative risk of receiving a documented depressive or anxiety 
disorder diagnosis or antidepressant/anxiolytic prescription within the first year postpartum 
than women without synthetic oxytocin exposure. This increased risk was still present when 
the analyses were restricted to index deliveries or a single random delivery in women who 
had multiple deliveries, and the risks were higher regardless of delivery mode.
The literature on the role of endogenous oxytocin concentrations and synthetic oxytocin 
administration in the peripartum period on postpartum mood is scarce, and data are 
conflicting. Several studies have examined the relationship between maternal plasma 
oxytocin and depressive symptomology (Cox et al., 2015; Garfield et al., 2015; Massey et 
al., 2016) found that low oxytocin during pregnancy is associated with increased depressive

 symptoms and thus suggest that administering exogenous oxytocin, such as the synthetic 
oxytocin Pitocin, may alleviate or prevent negative postpartum mood. Another study found 
lower oxytocin levels during breastfeeding at 8 weeks postpartum in women with depressive 
symptoms compared to asymptomatic women (Cox, et al., 2015). However, one study found 
that higher oxytocin in the third trimester predicted higher depressive symptom severity at 6 
weeks postpartum, but only in women with a prior history of depression; plasma oxytocin 
was unrelated to symptom severity in women without a history of depression (Suena H. 
Massey, et al., 2016). And finally, a very recent longitudinal study of women whose plasma 
oxytocin was measured twice during pregnancy and at 3 different times postpartum, found 
that rather than absolute plasma oxytocin levels, the timing of fluctuations in oxytocin levels 
from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum differed significantly in women with postpartum 
depressive symptoms compared to those without (Jobst et al., 2016).
Even fewer studies have addressed the effects of administration of oxytocin on postpartum 
mood. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) which investigated the effect of timing of 
intravenous administration of oxytocin in primiparous laboring women with dysfunctional 
labor indicated that women who received oxytocin earlier in their labor had a non-
significant, but higher rate of major depression, although median depression scores did not 
differ between groups (Hinshaw, Simpson, Cummings, Hildreth, & Thornton, 2008). 
Another RCT administered intranasal synthetic oxytocin in a placebo-controlled, double-
blind, within-subjects design to a cohort of mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression 
(Mah, Van Ijzendoorn, Smith, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2013), and treatment resulted in 
lower reported mood. Our data support the idea that synthetic oxytocin administration 
during labor has a negative impact on postpartum mood. It is important to note that the effect 
of synthetic oxytocin administration on endogenous oxytocin levels is unclear, and nothing 
about endogenous oxytocin levels can be inferred from our dataset and the aforementioned 
RCTs. For example, it is possible that low endogenous oxytocin is associated with both the 
need for synthetic oxytocin administration during labor and higher postpartum depressive 
symptomatology. One recent study, however, found that the dose of synthetic oxytocin given 
during the labor and delivery (as determined retroactively from hospital charts) was 
positively correlated with both endogenous levels of oxytocin and depressive symptoms at 2 
months postpartum (Gu et al., 2016), similar to the results from intravenous dosing. The 
current data suggest that peripartum synthetic oxytocin administration may have more 
prolonged negative effects on mood than demonstrated in the aforementioned studies, where 
depression symptoms following treatment were only measured at a single time point soon 
after administration.
Strengths of the present investigation include a reasonable sample size and a diverse 
population. Inclusion of both diagnostic and medication prescription codes acknowledges 
the importance of assessing both diagnoses and symptoms, in line with Research Domain 
Criteria (RDoC) initiative (Insel et al., 2010). The sensitivity analyses also indicate that this 
association is found across different parous states and within the full term delivery spectrum. 
As an initial investigation of associations between peripartum synthetic oxytocin and 
maternal mood and anxiety, it provides a theoretical and methodological framework for both 
expanded and more specific studies of this relationship. For example, similar medical 
databases searches that include Medicaid patients and/or more detailed data on Pitocin

 exposures would be beneficial, as well as longitudinal studies which assess oxytocin levels 
and mood at multiple peripartum time points. The use of the i2b2 informatics platform 
makes this especially relevant to the dozens of institutions that have access to this resource, 
increasing the potential for future multi-site investigations. This broad examination of 
maternal depression and anxiety during the first year postpartum extends beyond the 
previous investigations that only focused on the early postnatal period, including a more 
expansive assessment of risk that reflects growing concerns about the prevalence and 
adverse effects of postpartum depression throughout the first year and beyond (ACOG, 
2015).
A few limitations of the study affect the interpretation of the results and potential 
applicability of the findings. The effects of Pitocin on oxytocin levels could not be assessed. 
Given that these are administrative/population health data, it is not possible to determine 
whether the relationship between peripartum synthetic oxytocin administration and 
postpartum depressive and anxiety disorders is causal. True prevalence of postpartum 
depressive and anxiety disorders is likely underestimated due to known under-diagnosis and 
thus under-documentation in the medical record (Evins, Theofrastous, & Galvin, 2000; 
Halbreich & Karkun, 2006). In our dataset, we did not have access to data on patients served 
by Medicaid due to how Medicaid data is stored in Massachusetts; outside of MiCARD. 
This represents a high-risk population our health system serves. In addition, given the broad 
range of synthetic oxytocin exposures included, it is possible that risks were higher for more 
substantial exposures during labor induction and augmentation. Taken together, the under-
diagnosis, omission of Medicaid data, and range of synthetic oxytocin exposures make it 
likely that the calculated risk ratios are conservative. The data set was also missing delivery 
mode data for a considerable percentage of deliveries and information on potential 
confounding variables (such as familial history of postpartum depressive or anxiety 
disorders, maternal body weight and body mass index, maternal illnesses associated with 
depression such as gestational diabetes, Pitocin dosages and indication, labor/delivery and/or 
breastfeeding complications, etc.) that limited more detailed investigation of the findings and 
statistical adjustment.
There has been a great deal of debate recently on the significance of oxytocin in psychiatry 
research in animals and humans, including valuable commentary on evolutionary and 
theoretical social perspectives and potential implications for disorders ranging from autism 
to schizophrenia (Shamay-Tsoory & Young, 2016). Unfortunately, there is little discussion 
or even appreciation for the fact that 22% of births are induced (with 4 million births in the 
U.S. in 2014 (Hamilton, Martin, Osterman, C., & Matthews, 2014)) and that synthetic 
oxytocin is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States (ACoPB, 2009) while 
little research has been done to examine the potential effects on postpartum maternal mood 
or anxiety. Given the paucity of data on this topic, prior literature along with the current 
study underscore the need for more research on the interaction between synthetic oxytocin 
and maternal mood in a clinical context where its use is very common and expected to 
increase given recommendations for all women to receive it for postpartum hemorrhage 
prevention (WHO, 2012). The potent behavioral effects of oxytocin in basic and clinical 
studies justify increased study of the potential effects of peripartum manipulation of this
