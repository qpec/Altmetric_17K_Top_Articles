Reports on bacteria detected in maternal fluids during pregnancy are typically associated with
adverse consequences, and whether the female reproductive tract harbours distinct microbial
communities beyond the vagina has been a matter of debate. Here we systematically sample
the microbiota within the female reproductive tract in 110 women of reproductive age, and
examine the nature of colonisation by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and cultivation.
We find distinct microbial communities in cervical canal, uterus, fallopian tubes and perito-
neal fluid, differing from that of the vagina. The results reflect a microbiota continuum along
the female reproductive tract, indicative of a non-sterile environment. We also identify
microbial taxa and potential functions that correlate with the menstrual cycle or are over-
represented in subjects with adenomyosis or infertility due to endometriosis. The study
provides insight into the nature of the vagino-uterine microbiome, and suggests that sur-
veying the vaginal or cervical microbiota might be useful for detection of common diseases in
the upper reproductive tract.

 I
n marsupials and placental mammals, the female reproductive
tract has developed unique structures such as the vagina and
the uterus. During the reproductive cycle, mature oocytes from
the ovaries enter the peritoneal cavity to be captured by fimbriae
of the fallopian tubes. The oocytes are fertilised in the fallopian
tubes, and the zygotes develop and translocate to the uterus for
implantation. While the vagina is home for trillions of bacteria,
the uterus and the fallopian tubes are generally believed to be
sterile, which would require the cervix to be a perfect barrier.
Mucins in the cervix, however, are known to change conforma-
tion, leading to aggregations dependent on pH variations during
the menstrual cycle1. Such changes may in theory allow passage
of bacteria during certain conditions.
Lactobacilli are known as the keystone species of the vaginal
microbiota
in
reproductive-age
women2.
Indeed,
culture-
independent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing studies from
the United States have identified 5 community types of vaginal
microbiota, 3 or 4 of which contain >90% Lactobacillus3–5. The
lactic acid produced by the vaginal microbiota helps maintain a
low pH of 3.5–4.5, a major factor in limiting the growth of
potentially harmful bacteria. Alterations in the vaginal microbiota
play a role in common conditions such as bacterial vaginosis,
sexually transmitted diseases, urinary infections and preterm
birth2, 6, 7.
In contrast, the upper reproductive tract remains largely
unexplored.
Bacteria
have
mostly
been
studied
in
small
sample sizes in the context of infection, especially in relation to
preterm birth6. Although controversial, the placenta has recently
been reported to harbour a microbiota8. It is as yet not clear
what type of bacteria, if any, may exist in the upper reproductive
tract of the vast majority of women who are not in periods
of infection or pregnancy. Furthermore, it is not known if an
upper reproductive tract microbiota could play a role in uterine-
related
diseases
such
as
hysteromyoma,
adenomyosis
and
endometriosis.
Here, we systematically sampled the microbiota at six sites
within the female reproductive tract, from a large cohort of
Chinese women of reproductive age. Bacteria were identified by
using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, real-time qPCR, as
well as conventional bacterial culturing. The results indicate a
continuity of the vagino-uterine microbiome, with a distinct
trend within the same individual. Potential bacterial markers for
adenomyosis and endometriosis were also identified.
Results
Microbiota composition at six sites within the female repro-
ductive tract. To explore the microbiota beyond the vagina, we
collected samples from six locations (CL, lower third of vagina;
CU, posterior fornix; CV, cervical mucus drawn from the cervical
canal; ET, endometrium; FLL and FRL, left and right fallopian
tubes; PF, peritoneal fluid from the pouch of Douglas) throughout
the female reproductive tract from an initial study cohort of 95
Chinese women submitted to surgery for conditions not known
to involve infections (Fig. 1). These conditions included hyster-
omyoma
(also
known
as
uterine
fibroids),
adenomyosis,
endometriosis and salpingemphraxis, which are to our knowledge
the best proxies for the upper reproductive tract in healthy young
women (Supplementary Data 1). Samples from the vagina and the
cervical mucus (CL, CU, CV) were taken upon visit to the clinic
(without any prior disturbance). Samples from the peritoneal and
uterine sites (PF, FL, ET) were taken during laparoscopy or
laparotomy from minimally invasive surgery cuts to avoid pos-
sible contamination from the vaginal microbiota if the samples
were to go through the cervical os (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1).
The samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing, quality-controlled and clustered into operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) (Supplementary Data 2, 3).
The lower (CL, CU, CV) and upper (ET, FL, PF) reproductive
tract samples separated when subjected to principal coordinate
analyses (PCoA) based on weighted and unweighted UniFrac
distances (Fig. 1a, b). The FLL and FRL showed essentially the
same microbiota (Fig. 1a, b), and were therefore clustered into a
common FL category for further analysis (except for calculation
of intra-individual and inter-individual differences, referred to
later).
Consistent with previous reports3–5, the CL as well as the CU
were dominated by the Lactobacillus genus (Fig. 1c), and
exhibited a low α-diversity (Supplementary Fig. 2a). At the
species level, the CL and CU samples contained L. crispatus,
L. iners and other Lactobacillus spp. (Supplementary Fig. 2b),
similar to previous reports from the US3–5. Notably, CV samples
generally contained a lower proportion of Lactobacillus than the
vaginal samples (Fig. 1c), and varied among the sampled
individuals
(Supplementary
Fig.
3a).
In
the
ET
samples,
Lactobacillus
no
longer
dominated,
and
bacteria
such
as
Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Vagococcus and Sphingobium con-
stituted a notable fraction of the microbiota (Fig. 1c, Supple-
mentary Fig. 3b). The proportion of these bacteria further
increased at the openings of the FL, leaving a median relative
abundance of 1.69% for Lactobacillus (Fig. 1c, Supplementary
Fig. 3d). The PF samples generally lacked the presence of
Lactobacillus, but otherwise harboured a microbiota as diverse
but not completely the same as the FL samples (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Fig. 3c).
At the phylum level, the Firmicutes-dominated lower repro-
ductive tract microbiota contrasted the large proportions of
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the upper
reproductive tract (Supplementary Fig. 3e).
As
noted
above,
we
took
samples
from
the
uterine
and peritoneal sites without going through the cervical os
to address a major concern in the field that transcervical
samples might be contaminated by the vaginal microbiota.
We nonetheless tested the specificity of sampling route by
collection of ET samples via the uterus as well as through the
cervical os, and of CV from the cervical os as well as from the
uterine end. The distribution of bacteria in the samples taken
through the cervical os showed high similarity to that in samples
taken by opening the uterus during surgery (Supplementary
Fig. 4a, b), suggesting that both the uterine and cervical
microbiota could be readily accessed and analysed in women
not undergoing surgery.
Estimation of bacterial biomass in the female reproductive
tract. In order to provide some absolute measure of the micro-
biota beyond the vagina, we developed a species-specific real-time
qPCR approach, focusing on the dominant vaginal bacteria
Lactobacilli. The abundances of L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri
and L. jensenii monotonously decreased from CL, CU, CV, to ET
and PF (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d), consistent with genus level
data from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Fig. 1). The
concordance between qPCR and amplicon sequencing results
were further confirmed by Spearman’s correlation, which showed
a correlation coefficient of 0.72 for L. crispatus and 0.56 for
L. iners, the two dominant Lactobacilli species (Supplementary
Fig. 2b).
The total bacterial biomass within each site was then calculated
based on the copy number from qPCR, divided by the
corresponding relative abundance in the sample according to
16S rRNA gene sequencing. This calculation revealed that, while
the vaginal sites contained about four orders of magnitude more

 bacteria (1010–1011), the PF samples contained similar bacterial
biomass as the ET samples (Supplementary Fig. 5e), which are
orders of magnitude above potential background noise9. The
negative controls (sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sterile
saline and ultrapure water) showed much higher cycle threshold
(Ct
values)
than
the
low
biomass
ET
and
PF
samples
(Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1), signifying that
much less bacterial DNA was detected in non-bio control
samples. It is thus important to bear in mind that the higher
bacterial diversity in the upper reproductive tract corresponds to
a lower bacterial biomass than the much better established
vaginal microbiota (Fig. 1c).
Cultivation of live bacteria from the upper reproductive tract.
Another important question is whether live bacteria rather than
debris makes up the bacterial DNA signal in the upper repro-
ductive tract samples. Hence, in a validation study we performed
16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing along with culturing of live
bacteria from an additional cohort of 15 women.
Of the 21 diluent negative controls, 19 had lower DNA
concentrations and library concentrations (close to zero) than
their respective tissue samples (Supplementary Data 4), again
confirming that there was little DNA in the non-bio control
samples. In PCoA, microbial profiles differed between the low
biomass upper reproductive tract samples and diluent controls

 (Supplementary Fig. 6, sterile saline for the peritoneal samples
and PBS for the remaining samples).
The same samples extracted at different times, diluted or
undiluted
before
amplification,
or
sequenced
in
different
runs showed high reproducibility, indicating that random
contamination had no major impact on bacterial community
structure detected in the upper reproductive tract (Supplementary
Table 2, Supplementary Data 5).
We further attempted to culture and isolate live bacteria from
the freshly collected samples. PF samples were plated on peptone
yeast extract-glucose (PYG) agar with 5% horse blood and
incubated aerobically or anaerobically. Positive bacterial cultures
were obtained from 5 out of 15 subjects, resulting in 8 different
isolates belonging to 7 genera such as Lactobacillus, Staphylo-
coccus and Actinomyces (Supplementary Table 3). These genera
were also detected in our 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing
data, and supported by previous cultivation of vaginal or amniotic
samples10–16 (Supplementary Table 3). Reassuringly, no bacteria
were isolated from the diluent-negative controls (including swabs
from sterilised skin samples from the patients and the gloves used
by doctors). Thus, live bacteria do exist in the upper reproductive
tract, of which we succeeded in isolation of some using
conventional culturing methods.
Signature species for each site of the reproductive tract. To get
more insight into the ecology of the vagino-uterine communities,
we defined signature OTUs for each body site considering both
the occurrence and abundance of the given OTUs (P < 0.05 in
multi-level pattern analysis, and indicator value index (IndVal)
>0.5, Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 6). L. iners and L. crispatus were
identified as signature species of the vaginal sites (CL and CU).
No signature OTUs with IndVal >0.5 was identified for CV or
ET, suggesting that they are bacterial transition zones between the
vagina and the upper anatomical sites. The FL had a number of
signature OTUs including Pseudomonas, Erysipelothrix and
Facklamia (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 6). The PF featured
many signature OTUs, including Pseudomonas, Morganella,
Sphingobium
and
Vagococcus,
all
of
which
increased
monotonously from the CU and the CV to the ET and PF
(Supplementary Data 6). In support of the existence of these
taxa in the upper reproductive tract, they have been reported in
previous studies of the vaginal microbiota in humans or
animals17–21. Overall, we observed the female reproductive tract
as a habitat for facultative anaerobes or aerobes; the upper sites
contained a variety of bacteria that grow in mildly alkaline
conditions, contrasting the Lactobacillus-dominated low pH
environment of the vagina.
Intra-individual and inter-individual similarity in the vagino-
uterine microbiota. To examine the microbiota relationship
at the six sites of the reproductive tract, we computed the
intra-individual and inter-individual distances between samples
from each individual. Weighted intra-individual UniFrac distance
relative to CL samples gradually increased from CU and CV to
ET and PF (Fig. 3a), consistent with the anatomical contingency
of these sites (Fig. 1). The same was also true in reverse order, i.e.
weighted intra-individual UniFrac distance relative to PF gradu-
ally increased from ET, CV, to CU and CL (Fig. 3b). Samples
from the same individual were highly correlated, and the
Sorenson indices between body sites were consistent with their
anatomical contingency (Fig. 3c). The intra-individual correlation
was notable even between the less invasive sampling site of CV
and the less reachable PF (median of Sorenson index = 0.255,
Fig. 3c), hinting at the possibility of minimally invasive surveys of
the uterine and peritoneal microbiota by cervical mucus sampling
in the general population.
Of note, the clear distinction between the upper and lower
reproductive tract, intersecting at CV and ET, remained intact
even when performing an inter-individual comparison (Fig. 3d)
(although the level of the inter-individual indices diminished
from that of the intra-individual (Fig. 3c)), hence underscoring
both anatomical as well as individual-specific features of the
vagino-uterine microbiota.
Site-specific community types in the vagino-uterine micro-
biota. To further understand the relationship between commu-
nities at each site, we examined community types in all samples
using the Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) model5. Of the
five community types detected by DMM (Supplementary Fig. 7),
Type 1 and 5 were dominated by the Lactobacillus genus, which
was present in notable amounts also in Type 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 4a, b,
Supplementary Data 7). Type 4, which contained a higher pro-
portion of Prevotella and might correspond to the more diverse
vaginal microbiota type reported previously3–5, was detected in
some of the CV and ET samples but was not found in the FL and
PF samples of this cohort (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 7). The
major type in PF, Type 2 was also present in CV, while Type 3

 was present at all sites, yet dominating in the FL samples (Fig. 4,
Supplementary Fig. 7).
When we examined transitions between community types at
neighbouring sites, most subjects with Type 1 in the vagina (l CL)
remained Type 1 at the CU, and changed to Type 5 either at CV
or at ET, and then turned to Type 2 in PF (Fig. 4c). By contrast,
subjects with Type 3 or 4 at the vaginal sites rarely became Type 5
at the uterine sites, while some Type 4 subjects were found to
switch to Type 3 in the upper part (Fig. 4b, Supplementary
Fig. 7c). These findings corroborated our aforementioned results
that there is an intra-individual continuum of the microbiota
from the vagina to the peritoneal fluid that gradually changes
according to the habitat.
Lifestyle and clinical factors associated with microbiota chan-
ges. The vaginal microbiota has previously been reported to vary
between ethnic groups (in the US) and the menstrual cycle3, 4.
With our comprehensive collection of metadata (Supplementary
Data 1), we examined whether various clinical and lifestyle factors
were associated with changes in the vagino-uterine microbiota in
women of reproductive age. Factors such as age of initial sexual
intercourse, duration of menstrual period, and gravida and para
appeared associated with microbiota composition at one or
more sites, but failed to reach statistical significance after con-
trolling for multiple testing (permutational multivariate analysis
of variance (PERMANOVA), P < 0.05 but q > 0.05, Supplemen-
tary Data 8 and 9). Having given birth (multipara versus nulli-
para) was associated with microbiota composition in CV and PF
(q < 0.05, Supplementary Data 9). Herbal medication was asso-
ciated with microbiota composition in the CV only (q < 0.05,
Supplementary Data 9). Age, hysteromyoma, adenomyosis and
endometrosis were also associated with microbiota composition
in the PF (q < 0.05, Supplementary Data 8, 9). Therefore, varia-
tions in the composition of the vagino-uterine microbiota are
associated with a number of natural and diseased physiological
conditions important for women’s health.
Identification of diseases based on the vagino-uterine micro-
biota. We further examined whether variations in the vagino-
uterine microbiota composition were associated with different
physiological conditions and diseases of the reproductive tract.
In relation to hysteromyoma (benign tumours in the uterus),
Lactobacillus sp. were found to be more abundant in the vaginal
and cervical samples of individuals with no hysteromyoma, while
L. iners was more abundant in the CV of individuals with
hysteromyoma
(Supplementary
Fig.
8).
Among
the
hysteromyoma-enriched OTUs, one OTU in the CU and 11
OTUs in the PF were also identified to be influenced by the stage
in the menstrual cycle (Spearman’s correlation coefficient >0.3 or
<−0.3, q < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 8); however, none of these
OTUs showed a correlation with age. Overall, the results were
consistent with hysteromyoma being associated with a minimally
altered vagino-uterine microbiota.
Subjects with adenomyosis (abnormal presence of endometrial
tissue within the myometrium) showed depletion or enrichment
of many bacteria throughout the reproductive tract, some
of which overlapped with bacteria associated with anaemia
(Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10), which was consistent with
clinical links between the two conditions (P = 0.001062 between
the two conditions in our cohort, Fisher’s exact test). Further-
more, cross-validated random forest models distinguished sub-
jects with adenomyosis from those without according to OTUs

 from any of the sites (Supplementary Fig. 11, Supplementary
Data 10).
The microbiota-based models also allowed us to distinguish
subjects without and with infertility attributed to endometriosis, a
condition where endometrial cells present abnormal growth
outside the uterus, and a major cause of infertility (Fig. 5,
Supplementary Data 11). Altogether, these results suggest that the
composition of the vagino-uterine microbiota potentially could be
used to detect a number of ailments common to reproductive age
women.
Functional inferences of the reproductive tract microbiota. To
estimate the functional capacities of the vagino-uterine micro-
biota, we predicted KOs (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) Orthology groups) from the 16S rRNA gene
data.
In the case of adenomyosis, the analyses revealed that
adenomyosis affected functions throughout the vagino-uterine
microbiota (Supplementary Fig. 12). The microbiota in subjects
with adenomyosis were especially enriched in pathways involved
in flagella assembly and biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids,
while
the
microbiota
in
subjects
without
adenomyosis
were
enriched
in
phosphotransferase
system
and
fatty
acid biosynthesis. These results suggest that functionally, the
microbiota is also a continuum in the reproductive tract, and
could be perturbed at multiple sites in a disease.
Menstrual cycle relates to the vagino-uterine microbiota and its
function. Differences in the vagino-uterine microbiota were also
identified between phases of the menstrual cycle, as was apparent
from
cross-validated
random-forest
models
that
classified
samples into different phases of the cycle (Supplementary
Fig. 13). OTUs that led to optimal classification included L. iners,
and Lactobacillus sp. from vaginal sites, Sphingobium sp.,
Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas sp. from the ET or PF,
which were differentially enriched during the proliferative and
secretory phases (Supplementary Fig. 13c). Notably, P. acnes was
more abundant in the secretory phase in the ET (Supplementary
Fig. 13l), and has previously been identified in the placenta
and cultured from follicular fluid8,
22–24. Functionally, the
proliferative phase appeared associated with increased bacterial
proliferation in the vagina and ET compared to the secretory
phase, seen as higher abundance of pathways for pyrimidine and
purine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and pepti-
doglycan biosynthesis (Fig. 6). The secretory phase, on the other
hand, showed higher abundance of pathways for porphyrin
metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, degradation of
benzoate, nitrotoluene and biosynthesis of siderophore (Fig. 6).
These results indicate that the vagino-uterine microbiota prob-
ably varies according to the menstrual cycle.
Discussion
Herein we demonstrate the existence of distinct bacterial
communities throughout the female reproductive tract forming a
continuum of microbiotas changing from the vagina to the

OTUs increases (a, CL; b, CU; c, CV; d, ET; e, PF). The model was trained
using relative abundance of the OTUs (present in at least 10% of the
samples) in the samples (n = 16 without endometriosis (fertile), 32 with
endometriosis (infertile)). Subjects with endometriosis who had given birth,
and infertile subjects due to reasons other than endometriosis, e.g.
salpingemphraxis, were not analysed (Supplementary Data 1). The red

 ovaries, which challenge the traditional view of human foetal
development being a sterile event8, 25–27. Indeed, vertical trans-
mission of the mothers’ microbiota before birth could be the
norm throughout the animal kingdom, as previously alluded to
by
others28.
Demonstrating
a
microbiota
in
traditionally
unchartered territories remains a challenging task, and as
illustrated here, the combination of high-throughput sequencing,
quantitative PCR, culturing of live bacteria and other techniques
would make a stronger case. Endosymbiotic, instead of free-living
bacteria, is also an intriguing possibility.
As it is not possible to directly sample the upper reproductive
tract (without going through the cervical os. and especially for FL,
PF) of fully healthy women, we have included a handful of fertile
and infertile conditions that are not known to involve infection.
The relevance of the vagino-uterine microbiota to female
fecundity would require further analyses in large cohorts and in
model systems. Although differing by disease cohorts and meth-
odology, our sequencing-based analyses nevertheless showed some
similarity to an early study on chronic endometritis29 (Supple-
mentary Table 4) and a recent study on endometrial cancer30
(Supplementary Table 5). Notably, the latter study also pointed to
the exciting possibility of idendifying endometrial cancer through
sampling the vaginal microbiota30. How disturbances to the
vagino-uterine microbiota might eventually lead to benign or
malignant conditions threatening the health of pre-menopausal
and post-menopausal women is a major open question.

 Of relevance for clinical practice was the finding of intra-
individual correlations between microbiota of the PF and that of
CV, as this indicates that (minimally invasive) sampling of cer-
vical mucosa could be used to survey the status of the uterus and
peritoneal cavity in the general population. This is of relevance in
relation to the demonstrated associations between the uterine
microbiota and diseases such as adenomyosis and endometrosis.
We also showed that microbiota at the upper reproductive tract
can be available through laparoscopy with minimal artificial
effects and contaminations, laying the basis for the usage of this
sampling route in subsequent studies.
We find that both the upper and the lower reproductive tract
are home for facultative anaerobes and aerobes, in contrast to the
situation in bacterial vaginosis (and more recently also reported
in endometrial cancer30, Supplementary Table 5), represented by
overgrowth with obligate anaerobes, being linked to adverse
outcomes such as pre-term birth and sexually transmitted dis-
eases2, 6, 7. Clothing, sedentary lifestyle, contraception and
delayed pregnancies common in modern life may modulate the
vagino-uterine microbiota. While vaginal Lactobacillus species are
known to inhibit other bacteria by maintaining a high con-
centration of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide production, a
healthy uterine microbiota likely also depends on the nutrients
and hormones available to the uterus, as well as the microbiota in
the vagina and the peritoneal cavity1, 31. In this regard, it was
striking to identify associations between inferred microbial
function and uterine-related diseases as well as to the menstrual
cycle, which would require validations in larger and prospective
cohorts32.
Methods
Study cohort and sample collection. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital and BGI-Shenzhen. As an
initial cohort, 95 reproductive age women operated for conditions not known to
involve infection (hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, endometriosis, salpingemphraxis)
were included in the study by Peking University Shenzhen Hospital between
December 2013 and July 2014 (Supplementary Data 1). Subjects with vaginal
inflammation, severe pelvic adhesion, any acute inflammation, cancer, endocrine or
autoimmune disorders were excluded. The subjects had no recorded recent use of
hormones, antibiotics and vaginal medications, no cervical treatment within a
week, no douching within 5 days and no sexual activity within 48 h. None of the
subjects were pregnant, lactating or in menses at the time of sampling. Informed
consent were obtained from all participants.
Samples from the lower reproductive tract (CL, CU, CV) were taken on the day
of the clinical visit with no prior perturbation. Samples from the upper
reproductive tract (ET, FL, PF) were taken during operation (on average 2.81 days
later, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1). Laparoscopy was used except
for subjects with adenomyosis who need laparotomy. Care was taken to avoid
contamination by blood. PF was sampled at the Pouch of Douglas after sterile
saline was injected into peritoneal cavity, and then the FL and ET were sampled
upon opening.
Nylon flocked swabs (Chenyang Global Group, CY-93050 and CY-98000) were
used for all samples except PF. The swab heads were then placed in sterile PBS and
flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, stored at −80 °C and transported on dry ice to
BGI-Shenzhen.
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. DNA extraction was
performed as described33. Sample was treated with Lysozyme, proteinase K and
SDS, then purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol, precipitated by glycogen,
sodium acetate and cold isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in
1 × TE buffer. The V4–V5 region of the 16S rRNA genes was amplified by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) with a universal forward primer and a unique bar-
coded fusion reverse primer (V4-515F: 5ʹ-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3ʹ and
V5-907R: 5ʹ- CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-3ʹ, where M indicates A or C and
R indicates purine).
PCR was performed using the following conditions: 3 min denaturation at
94 °C; 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 50 °C for 60 s,
elongation at 72 °C for 90 s; and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplicons
were purified using the AMPure beads (Axygen). Barcoded libraries were generated
by emulsion PCR, and sequenced in a V5 to V4 reverse direction on a 318 chip
using the 400 bp sequencing kit of the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine
(PGM) system according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Processing of 16S sequencing data. The raw data from the PGM system were
exported and pre-processed by using Mothur (V1.33.3)34. The criteria for high-
quality reads included: (1) longer than 200 bp; (2) less than two mismatches with
the degenerate PCR primers; (3) average quality score <25. OTUs based on the 16S
rRNA gene sequences were generated with the identity cutoff of 97% using
QIIME’s UCLUST program35. The seed sequences of each OTU were chosen for
taxonomic classification against the Greengene reference sequences (gg_13_8_otus)
by the UCLUST taxonomy assigner. The α-diversities and β-diversities, Unifrac
analyses were also calculated in QIIME with taxonomic abundance profiles at the
OTU or genus level.
For OTU #1 from our samples (an abundant OTU from the vagina), the seed
sequence showed over 97% identity with the V4V5 region of both the Lactobacillus
kitasatonis and Lactobacillus crispatus 16S rRNA genes. To resolve this ambiguity,
full-length 16S rRNA gene and a 289 bp fragment of the conserved single-copy
gene encoding phenylalanine-tRNA ligase beta subunit (PF03147) were cloned
from a sample containing 99% OTU #1 (C056CU), and Sanger sequencing
(Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer) confirmed both genes to be from
L. crispatus ST1 (NCBI gene ID: 9107847 and 9107287, respectively).
Identification of signature OTUs. Signature OTUs were identified according to
their IndVal values, which consider both the occurrence and abundance of a
taxon27, 36:
IndValp ¼ ap
a ´ np
Np
where ap is the sum of the abundances of species within the samples from body site
p, np is the number of occurrences of the species within the samples from site p, a is
the sum of the abundances of species from all body sites, Np is the number of
samples from site p.
Statistical tests on the IndVal values were performed as described previously,
through permutation of the relative abundance of each genus or OTU across
communities, using the multipatt function of the R package 'indicspeces'27.
Concordance of the microbiota between samples. We used the Sorenson index
(Sørensen–Dice index) to measure the similarity between microbiota at different
body sites of the same individual, based on the presence and absence of OTUs. The
index was calculated as:
QS ¼
2C
A þ B ¼ 2 A \ B
j
j
A
j j þ B
j j
where A and B are the number of OTUs in two samples A and B, respectively, and
C is the number of OTUs shared by the two samples; QS is the quotient of
similarity, which ranges from 0 to 1.
Community types of the vagino-uterine microbiota. Relative abundances of
genera in all 476 samples were used to determine the optimal number of clusters
according to DMM5. Transitions between community types were assessed statis-
tically from community type assignments for all subjects together, as well as for
those who had fallopian tube samples.
PERMANOVA on the influence of phenotypes. We applied PERMANOVA on
the relative abundances of OTUs or metabolites in the samples to assess impact
from each of the factors listed37, 38. We used Bray–Curtis or UniFrac distance and
9999 permutations in R (3.0.0, vegan package38, 39).
Random-forest classification. In order to construct a model that could distin-
guish samples of different menstrual phases for each body site, the relative abun-
dances of OTUs (found in at least 10% of the samples) in the samples were fitted
against the samples’ actual days in the menstrual cycle using default parameters in
the randomForest package in R (3.1.2 RC) except that 1000 trees were used, as in
previous reports on the gut microbiota age of infants27, 40. Ten-fold cross-valida-
tion was performed five times. The cross-validation error curves from the five trials
were averaged, and the minimum error in the averaged curve plus the standard
deviation at that point were used as the cutoff for acceptable error. From the sets of
OTUs with a classification error less than the cutoff, the set with the smallest
number of OTUs was chosen as the optimal set38, 41.
Random-forest classification of samples according to non-continuous
phenotypes was performed in the same manner.
MetaScope in the Progenesis QI software was used to search for compound
identifications not only based on neutral mass, isotope distribution and retention
time, but also based on collisional cross-sectional area and MS/MS fragmentation
data in the HMDB database.
Functional inference of 16S data. PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of
communities by reconstruction of unobserved states) was used to infer KOs from
OTU data as previously described42. The relative abundance of KEGG pathways

 and modules was summed from the relative abundance of KOs belonging to these
pathways and modules.
Differentially enriched KEGG pathways or modules were identified according to
their reporter score27, 38, 43, from the Z-scores of individual KEGG orthology
groups. A reporter score of Z = 1.96 was used as a detection threshold for pathways
or modules that were significantly over-represented in one group relative to the
other, corresponding to 95% confidence.
Real-time quantitative PCR. Four major vaginal Lactobacillus species including
L. crispatus, L.iners, L jensenii and L. gasseri were quantified by real-time qPCR
modified from a previously described regimen44. After DNA quantification was
conducted for each sample using Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies), 1.6 μl
DNA solution was used as the template for real-time PCR. Standard curves were
generated using serial tenfold dilutions of plasmids. The range of amplification
efficiency for the qPCR was from 90 to 110%, and linearity values were all ≥0.99.
Real-time qPCR was conducted using SYBR Premix Ex Taq GC (TAKARA) using
the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Life Technologies). Each reaction inclu-
ded a standard curve, and each sample was run in triplicate and contained 10 μl
SYBR Premix Ex Taq GC, 1.6 μl of DNA template along with 0.2 μM primers in a
final reaction volume of 20 μl. Sterile PBS and sterile physiological saline were used
as diluent negative controls, which were subject to sample processing, DNA
extraction and real-time qPCR in parallel with samples according to our standard
protocol, in order to determine the source of contamination. In addition, non-
template control, which was ultrapure water, was also included when performing
real-time qPCR. Total DNA amount for each sample was calculated by multiplying
the concentration of DNA by the total volume of extracted DNA.
Validation cohort used for control of contamination and bacterial culturing.
We used an independent validation cohort comprised of additional 15 reproductive
age women included between May 2016 and June 2016 (Supplementary Data 1).
The hospital and conditions for surgery were the same as those in study cohort.
Informed consent were also obtained from all participants.
Samples from the upper reproductive tract (ET, FL, PF) were collected during
operation. For each operation, sterile PBS, sterile physiological saline, dry sterile
swabs rubbed on patient's preoperative skin area, dry sterile swabs rubbed on
surgeon's gloved fingers were sampled as diluent negative controls. The swab heads
were then placed in sterile PBS (Supplementary Fig. 1).
PF samples and diluent negative controls from the additional 15 women were
collected for cultivation experiment. All the samples were kept under anaerobic
conditions, and processed in the laboratory within 6 h of sample collection to
maximise recovery of bacterial viability. In total, 100 μl of peritoneal fluid
specimens and 100 μl of each diluent negative controls were plated on PYG agar
(DSMZ 104 medium) with 5% horse blood and incubated aerobically or
anaerobically at 37 °C for up to 72 h. Reducing agents such as resazurin and
cysteine-HCl were not added to cultures incubated anaerobically. Bacterial isolates
from the plates were selected based on morphologic characteristics. DNA from
single colonies was extracted using the Bacterial DNA Kit (OMEGA) and then
amplified using the universal primers 27F/1492R45. The amplicons were purified
using the Magbind PCR Purification Kit (GeneOn BioTeach) and then sent for
Sanger sequencing. The sequences were analysed using the GenBank 16S rRNA
sequences database using the BLAST algorithm, and sequences with more than
97% similarity were considered to be of the same species.
Data availability. Sequence reads for the 544 samples have been deposited in the
European Nucleotide Archive under study numbers PRJEB16013 and PRJEB21098.
