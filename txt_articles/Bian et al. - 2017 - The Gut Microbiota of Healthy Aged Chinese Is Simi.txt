ABSTRACT
The microbiota of the aged is variously described as being more or less
diverse than that of younger cohorts, but the comparison groups used and the defi-
nitions of the aged population differ between experiments. The differences are often
described by null hypothesis statistical tests, which are notoriously irreproducible
when dealing with large multivariate samples. We collected and examined the gut
microbiota of a cross-sectional cohort of more than 1,000 very healthy Chinese indi-
viduals who spanned ages from 3 to over 100 years. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene
sequencing results used a compositional data analysis paradigm coupled with mea-
sures of effect size, where ordination, differential abundance, and correlation can
be explored and analyzed in a unified and reproducible framework. Our analysis
showed several surprising results compared to other cohorts. First, the overall micro-
biota composition of the healthy aged group was similar to that of people decades
younger. Second, the major differences between groups in the gut microbiota pro-
files were found before age 20. Third, the gut microbiota differed little between in-
dividuals from the ages of 30 to �100. Fourth, the gut microbiota of males ap-
peared to be more variable than that of females. Taken together, the present
findings suggest that the microbiota of the healthy aged in this cross-sectional study
differ little from that of the healthy young in the same population, although the mi-
nor variations that do exist depend upon the comparison cohort.
IMPORTANCE We report the large-scale use of compositional data analysis to estab-
lish a baseline microbiota composition in an extremely healthy cohort of the Chi-
nese population. This baseline will serve for comparison for future cohorts with
chronic or acute disease. In addition to the expected difference in the microbiota of
children and adults, we found that the microbiota of the elderly in this population
was similar in almost all respects to that of healthy people in the same population
who are scores of years younger. We speculate that this similarity is a consequence
of an active healthy lifestyle and diet, although cause and effect cannot be ascribed
in this (or any other) cross-sectional design. One surprising result was that the gut
microbiota of persons in their 20s was distinct from those of other age cohorts, and

obel Laureate Elie Metchnikoff is credited not only with providing insight into
phagocytosis, but also with linking gut microbes and intake of fermented food to
health and longevity (1). The search for healthy aging has been resurrected by the
ability to identify a plethora of microbes at various body sites, particularly the gut, and
to show that they influence and are influenced by health there and at distant sites (2,
3). This has led to investigations into the development of the gut microbiota through-
out life, with some studies reporting a gradual change over time (4) based upon
relatively small sample sizes (5–7). In a study of 728 female twins, 637 operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) were associated with frailty, including Eubacterium dolichum
and Eggerthella lenta, with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii less abundant (8). Since frailty is
strongly associated with increasing risk of earlier mortality (9), it is important to
characterize the gut microbiota along the continuum of age. The recent consensus is
that, in aggregate, the diversity of the gut microbiota declines with age (10), although
whether this is associated with healthy aging is controversial and the delineation of
what is normal in different cohorts are still not clear. Thus, continued study of the gut
microbiota in large and distinct cohorts is needed to identify and separate potential
microbial biomarkers for age and frailty.
A study of 314 healthy Chinese subjects showed that ethnicity and lifestyle could be
discriminated at the bacterial species level (11). The latter study led us to hypothesize
that the gut microbiota is imprinted in early life and associated with longevity. We
gained access to a large number of fecal samples from a variety of communities across
the age continuum in China and used a compositionally coherent approach to examine
the variance of the OTUs across all samples with age as a continuous variable for
exploratory data analysis and compositional association and as a discrete variable for
differential abundance analysis.
Our results show that the microbial composition of the healthy aged population is
remarkably similar to that of younger adult cohorts and that the major differences
between cohorts in microbial composition occur prior to age 30 years. While our
cross-sectional cohort precludes the assignment of cause and effect, our results suggest
that diet and lifestyle choices consistent with healthy aging even into the 10th decade
of life include a healthy and diverse microbiota.
RESULTS
The primary cohort of samples was collected from extremely healthy volunteers in
three cities from Jiangsu Province in China. These cities, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and
Nantong, were located west of Shanghai on the Yangtze River. Table 1 contains the
detailed geographic locations, age and sex distributions, and number of samples
included in each group. Subjects under the age of 30 were included if their parents and
grandparents lived to at least 80 years of age without major health problems that
required surgery or long-term medication. Subjects aged 30 years old or older were
included if the subject self-reported as being in extremely good health at the time of
collection (see Materials and Methods). A secondary cohort was collected from young
people undergoing military and police training in Lanzhou, a city in the north-central
part of China. All metadata, tables of derived data, and code required to reconstitute all
figures and analyses are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare
.4535660. The first analysis was performed on the data set with 883 samples collected
from the general population. This data set included 577 operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) that occurred at an abundance of greater than 0.1% in any sample and that
occurred in at least 20% of the samples.

FIG 1 Compositional PCA plot of samples (A) and OTU loadings (B) for the initial data set. Only OTUs that had an absolute effect size difference between any
two groups of �1 (24) or were compositionally associated with a � value of �0.65 (22) (Materials and Methods) are included in these plots. In panel A, each
point is a sample and the distance between points is proportional to the multivariate difference between samples. Samples are colored by their age group
membership, and the data ellipses encompass 75% of the points in a group (75% confidence interval [CI]). Panel B shows the loadings for panel A in the same
coordinate space, which represent the contributions of the OTUs to the separation of the samples. In this plot, each point is an OTU (colored by its assigned
taxonomic genus) and the distance and direction from the origin to the point representing an OTU is proportional to the standard deviation of that OTU in
the data set. The distance between one OTU and another is inversely proportional to their compositional association: points that are close together may have
concordant relative abundances across all samples. In comparing the two plots, we see, for example, that the 19- to 24-year-old age group (lower right quadrant
in panel A) has a higher relative representation of Bacteroides (lower right quadrant in panel B). The ability to directly interpret the plot is limited by the
proportion of variance explained (37.4% on the first component and 9.2% on the second component).

 of Fig. S1. While there is significant overlap in the location of the samples from each
group, the most extreme groups were the youngest (ages 3 to 6 and 8 to 12 years), the
oldest (age �94 years), and, surprisingly, the 19- to 24-year-old group. The loading plot
in Fig. 1B shows the OTUs responsible for the difference in location of the samples.
The finding that the 19- to 24-year-old group was divergent from the general
population was reexamined by rerunning the analysis with the inclusion of a second
cohort of 212 samples collected from military and police training groups (here the
“young soldier”group): the entire data set in this case included 1,095 samples and 562
OTUs when filtered as for the general population cohort. The young soldier group
included people who originated from various regions of China, were largely male, and
again were between the ages of 19 to 24, inclusive. As shown in Fig. S2A in the
supplemental material, the young soldier group clustered entirely and tightly within
the extreme end of the 19- to 24-year-old group. An unsupervised clustering of the
entire data set supported the general conclusion that the 19- to 24-year-old and young
soldier groups and the �94-year-old and the 3- to 6-year-old groups were the most
distinctive (Fig. S2B). The tight clustering of the young soldiers within the 19- to
24-year-old group was likely because the young solider group members were selected
to be very healthy and very active, and all were housed together in two distinct
common environments.
The young soldier group comprises people from a military training center in
Lanzhou and from a separate police training facility in Lanzhou. The different groups
were enrolled in distinct training regimens and did not mess together. Inclusion of only
the 108 OTUs with the greatest effect or that were compositionally associated in this
entire data set provided a similar ordination (Fig. S2C and D) to that seen when the
young soldier group was excluded (Fig. 1A).
All pairwise group comparisons were distinct when examined by permutational
multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA [P � 0.001]) using the Aitchison distance
(15). Examination of the PERMANOVA results showed that the 19- to 24-year-old and
young soldier groups were more similar to each other than to any other group and that
the group differences were otherwise small. Thus, the low P values likely reflect the
large number of samples and not necessarily a large difference between all groups (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material). Furthermore, we observed that the young
soldier group had the smallest within-group dispersion and the �94-year-old group the
greatest (Table S1).
The exploratory data analysis shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 revealed several interesting
patterns in the microbiota composition for this large age-segregated data set. First,
OTUs assigned to the Bifidobacterium genus appeared to be relatively enriched in the
youngest groups and relatively depleted in the oldest groups. Conversely, OTUs
assigned to the genera Dorea, Clostridium insertae sedis (IS) and sensu strictu 1 (SS1),
Marvinbryantia, and, to a lesser extent, members of the Prevotella genus appeared to be
relatively enriched in the samples collected from older subjects.
The age gradients and segregation of the 19- to 24-year-old and young soldier
groups were very robust to data manipulations (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental
material). In particular, the same separation between groups was observed when rare
OTUs were excluded (minimum relative abundance in any sample of 1%) or common
OTUs were excluded (maximum relative abundance in any sample of 2%). We thus
concluded that the structure of the data was a function of the entire microbial
ecosystem and was not driven by either rare or abundant taxa. This is in contrast to
other studies where the separation of particular groups was driven by only a few
relatively abundant taxa (16, 17).
Examination of confounding factors suggested that the age groups were distinct
from each other and that subsetting the age groups by metadata failed to reveal any
substantial variance within groups that could be attributed to the metadata (see Fig. S4
in the supplemental material). We conclude that no other metadata better explained
the data.
However, while the overall pattern of group separation was similar, the percentage

 of variance explained was different for the ordination when only the 562 male-derived
samples or the 533 female-derived samples were examined. Including samples from
females only, principal component 1 (PC1) explained 11.3% of the variance, while PC1
explained 19.4% in the male-only samples. The percentages of variance explained on
the second PCA axis were essentially the same at 7.4% and 6.4%.
The data were next examined by plotting age as a continuous variable versus
Shannon’
s diversity, and the results are shown in the � diversity panel in Fig. 2. The
range of values is rather narrow but exhibited a modest peak diversity near age 10 and
a slight minimum near age 20. The pattern of Shannon’
s diversity is not an artifact of
read depth since examination of samples from all ages with a narrow read depth band
exhibited the same pattern, and � diversity and read depth were not found to be
correlated (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material).
Identification of correlated features in compositional data is notoriously difficult
(18–22), and in particular Pearson’
s or Spearman’
s correlations give many false-positive
associations (18). Thus, we used an expected value of � metric (22) to identify clusters
of coassociated OTUs in the data set. This strength of association approach identifies
OTUs where both the direction and magnitude of variance are similar in the multidi-
mensional data set. In a multivariate compositional sense, the metric is measuring both
the slope of the correlation of the centered log ratio (clr)-transformed values and the
correlation itself. A slope of 1 and a correlation of 1 are preferred (18, 22, 23). The �
metric coupled with a Bayesian estimation of OTU relative abundance (22, 24) has the
advantage of being agnostic to the level of sparsity in the data, unlike other recent
approaches that depend on this sparsity (19, 20).
Panels A to G in Fig. 2 show the relative abundance of OTUs assigned to one of 9
genera (plus unknown genera) that had an expected � value of �0.65, and where the
FIG 2 Exploration of the data set with age as a continuous variable. The � diversity panel plots Shannon’
s diversity (shdiv) across the age range (x axis). Each
point is an individual sample, and the black line is the Loess line of best fit. Panels A through G represent clusters of concordant OTUs with an expected � value
cutoff of �0.65; this metric provides a measure of the constancy of the ratio between OTUs and is a replacement for correlation (18, 22, 23). Each line in a cluster
plot is the Loess line of best fit for the clr relative abundance (rAB on the y axis) of an individual OTU across age (x axis). A 0 value indicates that the relative
abundance of an OTU is equal to the mean log2 relative abundance of all OTUs, while a positive or negative value indicates relative abundances greater or less
than the mean log2 relative abundance, respectively. OTU lines of best fit are colored according to the genus that the OTU is classified into according to the
key. Note that most of the clusters contain OTUs related by the same genus (A, C, D, F, and G). The lines of best fit suggest approximately equal ratios between
the cluster members across the age range; however, this must be investigated further (22, 23), as shown in the last panel. For demonstration, the relative
abundances between one pair of concordant OTUs from cluster C is plotted in the bottom right panel (OTU 6 versus OTU 3340). These two OTUs are the two
relatively most abundant OTUs in cluster C (top two lines), and they have an expected � value of 0.8. The slope of association shown in the red line is 0.82.
The blue line shows the ideal slope of 1 (22, 23). The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.83. Table S2 contains the slope and correlation information for all
pairwise correlated OTUs.

 cluster size was larger than 2, plotted against age as a continuous variable. For
reference, the last panel in Fig. 2 shows the correlation and slope of one pair of OTUs.
The correlation and slope for all pairs of OTUs identified are given in Table S2 in the
supplemental material.
This approach identified seven distinct clusters, and most clusters contained OTUs
classified into the same genus. It is likely that the most strongly associated groups
include predominantly members of the same genus because different members of the
same genus have similar growth requirements, limitations, and interactions.
Clusters F and G were relatively constant across all samples and were composed of
OTUs identified as being members of the Faecalibacterium genus, suggesting that they
are members of the core microbiota in this population. This result contrasts with the
findings of Biagi et al. (25), who observed that the OTUs assigned to the genus
Faecalibacterium as a whole were relatively less abundant in centenarians than in
younger persons.
Clusters A to E showed a large change in relative abundance in the 19- to 24-year-
old group compared to all other age groups. In particular the relative abundance of
OTUs assigned to the genera Prevotella and Bacteroides (clusters A and D) were greatest
in the 19- to 24-year-old group, and OTUs classified in both these genera were relatively
rarer in people younger than 20. Members of the Bacteroides and of the Bifidobacterium
genera were, in general, relatively least abundant in the samples from the oldest
subjects. The Prevotella spp. in cluster A tended to remain relatively constant after age
30, but decreased somewhat in the oldest subjects.
Clusters B, C, and E showed a local minimum in relative abundance near age 20.
Clusters B and E exhibited an otherwise somewhat constant relative abundance, likely
reflecting a set of taxa that are part of the core microbiota displaced by the OTUs
assigned to the Prevotella and Bacteroides genera in the 19- to 24-year-old and young
soldier groups. In contrast, the members of cluster C, composed entirely of OTUs
assigned to the Bifidobacterium genus, were relatively less abundant in the 19- to
24-year-old groups than in the age groups that immediately surround the 19- to
24-year-old and young soldier groups. Members of cluster C exhibited a continuous
reduction in relative abundance from age 30 onwards compared to the relative
abundance in the younger subjects.
Examining the Shannon’
s diversity plot, the local minimum in � diversity near age
20 may be caused by members of the Prevotella and Bacteroides genera achieving
relative dominance in this age group, thus displacing (or appearing to displace) the
remainder of the members of the ecosystem and reducing the overall diversity of the
system.
Figure 3 shows the standardized effect size differences calculated by the ALDEx2 R
package (see Materials and Methods) between each successive group with the OTUs
binned by genus. It is striking that the majority of the OTUs in the majority of genera
exhibit strikingly concordant differences in relative abundance, even if those differ-
ences do not reach an effect size greater than 1. This amplifies the results shown in
Fig. 1 and 2, where only a subset of OTUs were displayed. A multitude of small
genus-wide differences in relative abundance will have cumulatively large effects on
the composition of the microbiota. To our knowledge, no other study has examined the
association between OTU-level changes and genus- or other taxonomic-level changes
in such a granular manner.
Not surprisingly, the association between OTU-level and taxonomic rank-level
changes becomes less obvious with higher taxonomic rank, although large-scale trends
can still be observed (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). At the phylum level,
OTUs classified in the Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were relatively similar across all
age groups. In contrast, the bulk of the Firmicutes exhibited large-scale difference,
being relatively less abundant in the 19- to 24-year-old and 60- to 79-year-old groups,
although there were many OTUs that exhibited trends away from the majority. More
clearly, individual OTUs in the Actinobacteria and the Bacteriodetes phyla tended to
have altered relative abundances that were more closely allied with the difference

 observed for all the OTUs in the phylum. Thus, alterations in the relative abundance of
particular members of the Actinobacteria or Firmicutes phylum appeared to be com-
pensated for by differences in relative abundances of OTUs in the Bacteriodetes or
Firmicutes phylum or both phyla.
Second, we found that entire genera, and other taxonomic levels, are relatively
increased or decreased in different age groups, indicating that the behavior observed
for a small number of OTUs in Fig. 2, is often genus-wide. For example, OTUs in the
genus Blautia displayed little difference in the 3- to 14-year-old age range, but are
relatively depleted in the 19- to 24-year-old group, become relatively more abundant
in subjects older than 30, and then become relatively depleted again in subjects older
than age 60. A similar pattern is observed for Bifidobacterium, except that the earliest
evidence of relative depletion occurs in the transition from primary to middle school (8-
to 12-year-olds versus 13- to 14-year-olds). In contrast, the bulk of the OTUs in the
genera Prevotella and Bacteroides become relatively more abundant in all successive
age groups until age 20, then relatively rarer in the 30- to 50-year-old group, relatively
more abundant in the 60- to 79-year-old group, and relatively rarer again in those �94
years old.
DISCUSSION
The present study identified a distinct gut microbiota in a 19- to 24-year-old cohort
from the general population that has not been observed in large-scale analyses of other
populations (25–27) and may be unique to this healthy cohort in China. This observa-
tion may result from an altered diet, altered energy requirements, or an unknown
cohort effect, although if the latter, it must have occurred countrywide as the same
effect was observed in a population of university age students from Jiangsu Province
and from police and military recruits originating from all provinces in China.
There are three possibilities that can explain the data in this cross-sectional study.
First, it is tempting to speculate that the patterns of occurrence can be interpreted as
FIG 3
Differential relative abundance of major taxa for successive pairwise comparisons. All possible comparisons of
cohorts revealed 102 OTUs that were reproducibly different between at least one pair of cohorts. These were grouped into
26 classified genera and one set containing all unclassified OTUs. The plots show all OTUs in these 26 genera for pairwise
comparisons between each successive age group pair: 3 to 6 versus 8 to 12, 8 to 12 versus 13 to 14, 13 to 14 versus 19
to 24, 19 to 24 versus 30 to 50, 30 to 50 versus 60 to 79, and 60 to 79 versus �94. Each comparison plot shows a point
for each OTU binned by genus with the log2 standardized difference, the “effect”measure determined by ALDEx2 (24, 39),
between the two groups on the x axis. Points are colored as red or blue if they have an effect size of �1 for the comparison.
An effect size greater than 1 indicates that the OTU will be reliably found to have a greater difference between groups than
dispersion within either group (24). Equivalent plots for comparisons at different taxonomic levels are shown in Fig. S6.

 a trajectory that is established early on and reversed or disrupted in the 19- to
24-year-old cohort. Second, it is possible that the patterns observed represent a cohort
effect, whereby each age group exhibits a pattern set up from a shared diet or
environment. Third, it is possible that the differences between age groups can be
accounted for by a survivor bias. This final explanation may be particularly important in
the oldest age groups, which differed little from younger subjects. A lifelong longitu-
dinal study would be required to distinguish between these three conjectures.
While the vast majority of samples were collected in Jiangsu Province, we believe
that many of the observations will translate to other parts of China, in particular those
regions with similar demographics, history, and cuisine. This is illustrated by the striking
similarity between the 19- to 24-year-old group collected largely from Jiangsu Province
and the young soldier cohort that was collected from two distinct groups of subjects
of diverse origins in China. Importantly, the samples from the young soldier cohort were
collected in a different way than for the remainder of the samples, yet the 19- to 24-year-old
college students and young soldier samples cluster together on PCA plots, by unsupervised
clustering, and had a small variance in the PERMANOVA analysis. Thus, given that the data
from the 19- to 24-year-old group from Jiangsu Province are potentially generalizable to
other people of similar ages from across China, it is possible that the data for other age
groups may be similarly generalizable, at least in broad outline.
These data were analyzed using a compositionally coherent approach which exam-
ined the variance of the OTUs across all samples with age as a continuous variable for
exploratory data analysis and for compositional association and as a discrete variable
for differential abundance analysis. This unified approach gave consistent results across
all three methods, which is in contrast to more standard approaches such as weighted
Unifrac or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, where the ordination or clustering is driven by the
most abundant taxa, but the most differentially abundant taxa are often those that are
rarest in the data set (17). We noted that an exploration of the data by nonmetric
multidimensional scaling ordination identified the component 1 but not the compo-
nent 2 separation, suggesting that the separation of the 19- to 24-year-old subjects was
the most robust signal and that the compositional approach is more sensitive than a
popular nonparametric ordination approach (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material).
The diversity of gut microbial ecosystems across the healthy life span is somewhat
controversial, with some reporting a decline in diversity with age in the elderly, especially
the frail elderly (8, 10, 27), and others reporting that diversity either does not change or
increases in the healthy elderly (8, 41). Our analysis, with a very large cohort containing all
age groups from 3 to �100, where the participants are all either very healthy or from a
family with a very healthy family history, suggests that the answer depends on which group
with which the healthy elderly are compared: diversity increases dramatically relative to
healthy 20-year-olds, but declines relative to those in aged 13 to 14, and appears to increase
slightly compared to those between 30 and 79 years old. In addition, the �94-year-old
group had a larger � diversity than did younger groups; thus, the small sample size of
healthy aged people could result in spurious observations. Nevertheless, despite the
relatively constant microbial composition in all age groups, there are reproducible differ-
ences in the microbiota composition between the age groups.
The largest differences in OTU abundance were found between groups early in life
and around age 20, as well as in the extremely healthy elderly. There are large
differences in relative abundance of the OTUs of many genera between subjects aged
19 to 24 and younger subjects. If we take the view that this is a cohort effect, we could
conclude that members of multiple genera form a minimum or maximum relative
abundance near age 20 (Fig. 3). This suggests that a change in lifestyle (e.g., leaving
home for university or jobs) or physiology (e.g., levels of sex steroid hormones) in the
postteen years is an important determinant of the observed gut microbiota. Indeed, the
observed difference in microbiota in the 19- to 24-year-old groups does seem contem-
poraneous with the rapid rise in plasma levels of sex steroid hormones in males and
females experienced at this stage in life, with testosterone in males and estradiol in
females peaking around this age (28). These were not investigated in this cohort, but

 in animal models, the ability of microbes to regulate hormones and for them to change
microbial diversity has been demonstrated (29). These differences were found to be
more profound in extremely healthy and vigorously active young soldier cohort. Thus,
we cannot rule out that either a difference in caloric intake or some other environ-
mental or countrywide historical factor is the cause of the difference between the 19-
to 24-year-old subjects and the others.
Enterotypes proposed by Arumugam (16) were not identified in this data set: in fact,
the relative abundances of members of the Prevotella and Bacteroides genera are largely
concordant across the age range. This is not surprising given that the occurrence of
enterotypes relies on the dominance of one or more taxa in the data set (17). The
compositional analysis that does not rely on abundance coupled with the relatively
large number of samples and of taxa and the richness of the Chinese diet may account
for the lack of enterotypes.
The OTUs in several genera were relatively constant across all age ranges, with
members of the Faecalibacterium genus being most constant and some members of
the Blautia, Clostridium I, Anaerostipes, Dorea, and Turcibacter genera being more
variable (Fig. 2). These may form a core microbiota for this cohort and perhaps for
residents of China in general, as future studies will determine.
The microbiota composition of the centenarian cohort was remarkably similar to
those of all members of the cohort over the age of 30, bar a few small changes, in the
30- to 50-year-old cohort that were carried through to elder years. This may reflect a
selection bias in our sample cohort for the very healthy elderly. Nevertheless, it is
interesting that the very healthy �94-year-old cohort has been able to maintain a
microbiota similar to that of healthy younger people—perhaps by staying in one place
and consuming the same type of food. However, other host and environmental factors
were not investigated.
Several methodological limitations of the study must be acknowledged. First, only
limited participant metadata were collected. Second, we did not conduct negative-
control DNA extractions or amplifications, although it is unusual for fecal samples to be
of low biomass. Third, block randomization of samples was not conducted: although
samples from every age group were in each processed batch, they were not random-
ized or blocked. Finally, the set of participants was self-selected and all personal
information was self-reported.
Conclusions. The results suggest that if you live to be 100 and in perfect health in
China, your microbiota will likely appear to be relatively similar to that from a person
in their mid-30s. Whether this is cause or effect is unknown, but it suggests that
resetting an elderly microbiota to that of a 30-year-old might help promote health, if
the microbiota is outside the norm. This study showed the practicality and power of a
compositional data analysis paradigm, where ordination, differential abundance, and
correlation can be analyzed in a unified and robust framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enrollment and exclusion criteria for the study. Volunteers were asked to fill out a self-reporting
health information questionnaire that included information on the inclusion and exclusion criteria
described below. The age and detailed geographic locations of all persons who contributed samples are
included in Table 1. These were divided into eight groups by age and are referred to by their age range
in years (Table 1): kindergarten students, 3 to 6; primary school students, 8 to 12; middle school students,
13 to 14; college students, 19 to 24; soldiers and police recruits, 19 to 24; middle-aged, 30 to 50; elderly,
60 to 79; and centenarians, at least 94.
Only subjects who self-reported as having a personal and family history of extreme health (based on the
self-reported questionnaires) were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were nonsmoker, teetotaler, mood
was stable (self-assessed/reported), absence of any diseases, no prescription medication and antibiotics for
the past 3 months (including birth control pills), no personal and family disease history (such as cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, metabolic, neurological/mental and respiratory diseases, as well as cancers), and parents and
grandparents are all alive or passed away after 80 years of age. This last criterion was not applied to subjects
recruited older than 31 years of age. These stringent criteria excluded between 97% and 99% of potential
volunteers depending on age. The volunteers in the young soldier category were chosen with all the criteria
listed above and the following two additions: first, they had passed the standard military entrance medical
examination, and second, their grandparents lived to be at least 85 years.

 Description of informed consent and ability to use data for publication. Before sampling, all
volunteers were informed about the purpose of this study and signed an informed consent form, which
included provision of data acquired by examination of the samples they provided. The study was
approved by the University of Jiangsu Affiliated Hospital Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research
(Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, China).
Collection methods for each cohort. Whole fecal samples were collected without preservatives
following a standard operating procedure (SOP) described below. A sampling package was sent to
subjects who met the inclusion criteria, and a collecting site was established nearby, with an icebox that
was checked hourly. All samples were transferred to Tianyi Health Sciences Institute (Zhenjiang) Co., Ltd.,
in the icebox within �3 h of collection, mixed, aliquoted, and stored at �80°
C. We used the same SOP
with minor variations for the young soldier and �94-year-old groups. For the young soldiers’samples,
each subject collected a fecal sample following the instructions provided and immediately placed the
sample outdoors where the temperature was lower than 0°
C. Samples were aliquoted and frozen at
8 a.m. the morning after collection. For the subjects in the �94-year-old group, the sampling package
was taken to their home and retrieved within 2 h of collection, and the samples were then aliquoted at
WenCi Hospital. Samples were frozen at �80°
C after aliquoting.
DNA isolation methods. DNA was extracted from all samples using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit
(Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc.) following the manufacturer’
s protocol, with modifications as outlined in the
Earth Microbiome Project (version 4_13). DNA was quantified using a PicoGreen double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) reagent kit (Invitrogen; Paisley, United Kingdom) with a Molecular Devices SpectraMax micro-
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). DNA samples were stored at �20°
C until further
processing.
The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using in-line barcodes coupled
with the Earth Microbiome V4 primer sequences 515f and 806r (30), with a 4-nucleotide (nt) random
sequence pad between the Illumina adapter and barcode sequence. The inline-used barcodes were
CCAAGGTT, AAGGTTCC, GGTTCCAA, TTCCAAGG, CCTTGGAA, TTGGAACC, GGAACCTT, AACCTTGG, CTAC
TACC, GATGATGG, TCGTCGTT, AGCAGCAA, CTACCCTA, GATGGGAT, CGTTTCGT, GCAAAGCA, TTAACCGG,
and AACCGGTT. This strategy permits combinatorial barcodes to be used to uniquely identify each
sample in each run (30). A standard cycling procedure was used (2 min at 95°
C, followed by 25 cycles of
1 min at 95°
C, 1 min at 55°
C, and 1 min 72°
C, with a final 5 min at 72°
C and hold at 4°
C) using primers
515F (5-barcode-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3=) and 806R (5=-barcode-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3=).
Amplicons were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen; Düsseldorf, Ger-
many) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions and quantified using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent kit
(Invitrogen; Paisley, United Kingdom). Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts, and the
amplicon size was determined by an Agilent 2200 bioanalyzer.
DNA sequencing methods. The pooled product was paired-end sequenced with a 600 cycle kit on
the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) according to standard protocols.
Postsequencing processing. A brief description of the pipeline has been published previously (31),
with the SOP and all software required available at http://github.com/ggloor/miseq_bin. Sequences were
processed using a standardized pipeline (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). Reads were
overlapped using PandaSeq v2.5 (32), and any reads that contained ambiguous positions (an N in either
strand) were removed. Reads in each run were demultiplexed and assigned a name that uniquely
reflected the sample identifier and barcode. Demultiplexed reads from all samples were pooled into one
file and collapsed into individual sequence units (ISUs). Note that the ISU clustering step is extremely
memory intensive and was conducted on a server with 256 Gb RAM. ISUs were ordered by abundance
and were used for open reference OTU picking by USEARCH with a de novo chimera filtering step (33,
34). The OTUs occurring in each sample were tabulated, with singleton OTUs and those rarer than 0.1%
in any sample excluded, resulting in an initial data set containing 1,514 OTUs apportioned across 1,095
samples. This table is contained on the FigShare site as tab-separated plain text in SupplementaryCount-
Table.txt and forms the basis of the analyses described below.
Methods of analysis. The data from high-throughput sequencing are relative abundance data and
thus contain only information regarding the relationships or ratios between taxa (13–15, 18). Thus, we
adopted a compositional data (CoDa) analysis approach (35) that examines the ratios between OTUs. The
full workflow is contained on the FigShare site, but in brief, we did the following. For exploratory analysis,
zero count OTUs were replaced by an imputed value using the count zero multiplicative method from
the zCompositions R package (36). The centered log ratio (clr) transform was applied to the zero replaced
data set, and the data were subsequently used as input for a singular value decomposition (SVD). This
approach returns data where the samples are separated by the variance in the OTUs rather than by
differences in abundant OTUs (14, 15). Initial exploration of the data was conducted by using PCA plots
to explore the SVD output (12).
When conducting quantitative analyses, we used the clr-transformed posterior distribution of the
data generated by 128 Monte Carlo replicates drawn from a Dirichlet distribution (13, 24, 37). All analyses
report the expected value of the test statistic (22). Differential abundance tests were conducted with the
ALDEx2 v1.6.0 Bioconductor package (24, 37), and we report those taxa that have an expected effect size
difference of �1, since effect size measures are more reproducible than are P values (38). Correlation
analyses were done using a symmetric modification of the � metric (22), which measures the variance in
the ratios between OTUs. OTUs with a low ratio variance are said to be compositionally associated. The
� metric (23) was calculated as an expected value across clr-transformed Monte Carlo Dirichlet replicates
(22, 24) generated by the aldex.clr function, and values of �0.65 were taken as indicating association
between pairs of OTUs.
