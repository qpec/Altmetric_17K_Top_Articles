Abstract
Background
Plant-based diets have been recommended to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
However, not all plant foods are necessarily beneficial. We examined the association of an
overall plant-based diet and hypothesized healthful and unhealthful versions of a plant-
based diet with T2D incidence in three prospective cohort studies in the US.
Methods and Findings
We included 69,949 women from the Nurses’ Health Study (1984–2012), 90,239 women
from the Nurses’ Health Study 2 (1991–2011), and 40,539 men from the Health Profession-
als Follow-Up Study (1986–2010), free of chronic diseases at baseline. Dietary data were
collected every 2–4 y using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Using these
data, we created an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), where plant foods received posi-
tive scores, while animal foods (animal fats, dairy, eggs, fish/seafood, poultry/red meat, mis-
cellaneous animal-based foods) received reverse scores. We also created a healthful plant-
based diet index (hPDI), where healthy plant foods (whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
legumes, vegetable oils, tea/coffee) received positive scores, while less healthy plant foods
(fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, sweets/desserts) and animal
foods received reverse scores. Lastly, we created an unhealthful plant-based diet index

 (uPDI) by assigning positive scores to less healthy plant foods and reverse scores to
healthy plant foods and animal foods.
We documented 16,162 incident T2D cases during 4,102,369 person-years of follow-up.
In pooled multivariable-adjusted analysis, both PDI and hPDI were inversely associated
with T2D (PDI: hazard ratio [HR] for extreme deciles 0.51, 95% CI 0.47–0.55, p trend <
0.001; hPDI: HR for extreme deciles 0.55, 95% CI 0.51–0.59, p trend < 0.001). The associa-
tion of T2D with PDI was considerably attenuated when we additionally adjusted for body
mass index (BMI) categories (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87, p trend < 0.001), while that with
hPDI remained largely unchanged (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.61–0.72, p trend < 0.001). uPDI was
positively associated with T2D even after BMI adjustment (HR for extreme deciles 1.16,
95% CI 1.08–1.25, p trend < 0.001). Limitations of the study include self-reported diet
assessment, with the possibility of measurement error, and the potential for residual or
unmeasured confounding given the observational nature of the study design.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that plant-based diets, especially when rich in high-quality plant foods,
are associated with substantially lower risk of developing T2D. This supports current recom-
mendations to shift to diets rich in healthy plant foods, with lower intake of less healthy plant
and animal foods.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Plant-based diets, mainly defined as “vegetarian” diets, have been associated with
improved health outcomes, including reduced risk of diabetes.
• However, vegetarian diets can include less healthy plant foods, such as sweetened foods
and beverages, which are detrimental for health. Also, as it would be difficult for many
individuals to completely give up some or all animal foods to become vegetarian, it is
important to understand how gradually increasing plant foods, while decreasing animal
foods, affects diabetes risk.
• Thus, in this study, we aimed to understand how gradations of adherence to different
types of plant-based diets (healthful and unhealthful) are associated with diabetes risk.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We analyzed data from three studies that followed more than 200,000 male and female
health professionals across the US for more than 20 y, regularly collecting information
on their diet, lifestyle, medical history, and new disease diagnoses.
• We found that having a diet that emphasized plant foods and was low in animal foods
was associated with a reduction of about 20% in the risk of diabetes.

 • Consumption of a plant-based diet that emphasized specifically healthy plant foods was
associated with a larger decrease (34%) in diabetes risk, while consumption of a plant-based
diet high in less healthy plant foods was associated with a 16% increased diabetes risk.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Increasing intake of healthy plant foods while moderately reducing intake of some ani-
mal foods, especially red and processed meats, may be beneficial for diabetes prevention.
• These findings support the newly released 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Introduction
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs
in the US [1]. Several plant foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, are associated
with a lower risk of T2D [2–4], while certain animal foods, such as red and processed meats,
are positively associated with T2D risk [5]. Additionally, the recently released 2015 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee report recommends shifting away from intake of certain ani-
mal foods and moving towards a plant-rich diet [6]. Thus, we evaluated the hypothesis that a
plant-based diet is protective against T2D.
Prior studies on plant-based diets and T2D [7–9] have defined plant-based diets as “vegetar-
ian” diets, categorizing study populations dichotomously into participants who do or do not
consume some or all animal foods. An important question from clinical and public health
standpoints, however, is whether gradually moving towards a plant-rich diet by progressively
decreasing animal food intake lowers T2D risk. If so, public health recommendations could
suggest incremental dietary changes. Existing studies of vegetarian diets and T2D are also lim-
ited by a lack of differentiation among plant foods with divergent effects on T2D, because less
nutrient-dense plant foods, such as refined grains, potatoes, and sugar-sweetened beverages,
are associated with higher T2D risk [10–12].
We thus conceptualized a graded dietary pattern that positively weighs plant foods and nega-
tively weighs animal foods, similar to the approach used by Martínez-González et al. [13]. We
examined the association of this overall plant-based diet and, a priori, healthful and unhealthful
versions of a plant-based diet with T2D incidence in three large prospective cohort studies in the
US. We hypothesized that these plant-based diets would be inversely associated with T2D risk.
Methods
Study protocols for all cohorts were approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham
and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; completion of the
self-administered questionnaire was considered to imply informed consent.
Study Population
The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) started in 1976 with 121,701 female nurses (aged 30–55 y)
[14], the Nurses’ Health Study 2 (NHS2) started in 1989 with 116,430 female nurses (aged 25–

 42 y) [15], and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) started in 1986 with 51,529
male health professionals (aged 40–75 y) [16]; all three studies recruited participants from
across the US. In all three studies, follow-up questionnaires collect information on lifestyle and
medical history biennially, with a response rate of ~90% per cycle. In the current analysis, the
1984, 1991, and 1986 cycles were the baselines for NHS, NHS2, and HPFS, respectively,
because these are the cycles in which data on most covariates of interest were first comprehen-
sively measured. Participants with diabetes, cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), cardio-
vascular disease (CVD), reported energy intake levels outside predefined limits (<600 or
>3,500 kcal/d for women and <800 or >4,200 kcal/d for men), or incomplete dietary data at
baseline were excluded. The final analysis included 69,949 women in NHS, 90,239 women in
NHS2, and 40,539 men in HPFS at baseline.
Dietary Assessment
Dietary data were collected every 2–4 y using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.
Participants were asked how often they consumed a defined portion of ~130 food items over
the previous year. Response categories ranged from “never or less than once/month” to “�6
times/day.” The reliability and validity of the questionnaires have been described previously
[17–20].
Plant-Based Diet Indices
We created an overall plant-based diet index (PDI), a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI),
and an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). The procedure we used to create these indi-
ces is similar to the one used by Martínez-González et al. [13]; their “provegetarian food pat-
tern” is similar in composition to our PDI. Frequencies of consumption of each food were
converted into servings consumed per day. Then the number of servings of foods that belonged
to each of 18 food groups were added up. The 18 food groups were created on the basis of
nutrient and culinary similarities, within larger categories of animal foods and healthy and less
healthy plant foods. We distinguished between healthy and less healthy plant foods using exist-
ing knowledge of associations of the foods with T2D, other outcomes (CVD, certain cancers),
and intermediate conditions (obesity, hypertension, lipids, inflammation). Plant foods not
clearly associated in one direction with several health outcomes, specifically alcoholic bever-
ages, were not included in the indices. We also excluded margarine from the indices, as its fatty
acid composition has changed over time from high trans fat to high unsaturated fat. We con-
trolled for alcoholic beverages and margarine consumption in the analysis.
Healthy plant food groups included whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, vegetable
oils, and tea/coffee, whereas less healthy plant food groups included fruit juices, sugar-sweet-
ened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, and sweets/desserts. Animal food groups included ani-
mal fats, dairy, eggs, fish/seafood, meat (poultry and red meat), and miscellaneous animal-
based foods.
S1 Table details examples of foods constituting the food groups. The 18 food groups were
divided into quintiles of consumption, and each quintile was assigned a score between 1 and 5.
For PDI, participants received a score of 5 for each plant food group for which they were above
the highest quintile of consumption, a score of 4 for each plant food group for which they were
above the second highest quintile but below the highest quintile, and so on, with a score of 1
for consumption below the lowest quintile (positive scores). On the other hand, participants
received a score of 1 for each animal food group for which they were above the highest quintile
of consumption, a score of 2 for each animal food group for which they were between the high-
est and second highest quintiles, and so on, with a score of 5 for consumption below the lowest

 quintile (reverse scores). For hPDI, positive scores were given to healthy plant food groups,
and reverse scores to less healthy plant food groups and animal food groups. Finally, for uPDI,
positive scores were given to less healthy plant food groups, and reverse scores to healthy plant
food groups and animal food groups. The 18 food group scores for an individual were summed
to obtain the indices, with a theoretical range of 18 (lowest possible score) to 90 (highest possi-
ble score). The observed ranges at baseline were 24–85 (PDI), 28–86 (hPDI), and 27–90
(uPDI) across the cohorts. The indices were analyzed as deciles, with energy intake adjusted at
the analysis stage.
Ascertainment of Type 2 Diabetes
Participants who self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes were sent a supplementary ques-
tionnaire with established validity to confirm diagnosis [21,22]. Only confirmed cases that met
�1 of the following criteria were included (as per the National Diabetes Data Group) [23]: (a)
�1 classic symptoms plus fasting blood glucose � 140 mg/dl (>=7.8 mmol/l) or random blood
glucose � 200 mg/dl (�11.1 mmol/l); (b) no symptoms, but raised blood glucose levels (i.e.,
fasting blood glucose � 140 mg/dl or random blood glucose � 200 mg/dl or 2-h blood glucose
after oral glucose tolerance testing � 200 mg/dl) on two different occasions; (c) treatment with
hypoglycemic drugs. The threshold for fasting plasma glucose was changed to �126 mg/dl (7.0
mmol/l) starting in 1998 [24]. HbA1c � 6.5% was further added to the diagnosis criteria start-
ing in 2010 [25].
Assessment of Covariates
We collected height at baseline and updated information on weight, physical activity, smoking
status, multivitamin use, ethnicity, family history of T2D, hypertension, and hypercholesterol-
emia through biennial questionnaires. In NHS and NHS2, we also assessed information on
menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, and oral contraceptive use.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated person-time for each participant from questionnaire return date until T2D diag-
nosis, death, censoring, or end of follow-up (30 June 2012 in NHS, 30 June 2011 in NHS2, and
1 January 2010 in HPFS). For the primary analysis, we categorized the indices into deciles, so
as to not make assumptions about linearity and to limit the influence of outlying observations.
We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the associations between deciles of
each index and T2D incidence. Age (years) was used as the timescale, with stratification by cal-
endar time (2-y intervals). We adjusted for smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity,
family history of diabetes, multivitamin use, margarine intake, energy intake, baseline hyper-
tension and hypercholesterolemia, body mass index (BMI) categories, menopausal status and
postmenopausal hormone use (women), and oral contraceptive use (NHS2). Continuous
covariates were included in the model as categories for the reasons cited above for categorizing
the indices.
All dietary variables were cumulatively updated, i.e., were averaged, over the entire follow-
up duration to better capture long-term diet. Updating was stopped when major outcomes
(CVD or cancer) developed, as diagnosis with these conditions could change an individual’s
diet. Values of non-dietary covariates were updated every 2 y to account for changes in these
variables over time. In order to examine potential nonlinear associations, we created continu-
ous variables of the indices by assigning the median value to each decile and conducting tests
for linear trend, examined associations per 10-unit increase in the indices, and used restricted
cubic splines. We tested for effect modification by age, physical activity, family history of

 diabetes, and BMI, by including cross-product terms. The analysis was carried out separately
for each cohort, and the cohort-specific HRs were combined using a fixed-effects model; the
Cochrane Q statistic [26], the I2 statistic [27], and the between-study coefficient of variation
[28,29] were used to assess heterogeneity among the cohorts. All statistical tests were two-sided
(α = 0.05). All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 for UNIX (SAS Institute).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The distribution of age-adjusted baseline characteristics according to the PDI and hPDI are
shown in Tables S2 and 1, respectively. Participants with higher scores on PDI or hPDI were
older, more active, leaner, and less likely to smoke than participants with lower scores. They
also consumed a lower percentage of calories from saturated and monounsaturated fats, a
higher percentage of calories from polyunsaturated fats and carbohydrates, and higher levels of
fiber and folate.
Plant-Based Diet Indices and Type 2 Diabetes Incidence
During 4,102,369 person-years of follow-up, we documented 16,162 T2D cases. PDI was
inversely associated with T2D incidence in all three cohorts after adjusting for potential con-
founders (Table 2). Adjustment for BMI attenuated the relationship, but associations remained
significant (pooled hazard ratio [HR] for extreme deciles 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87; HR per
10-unit increase 0.88, 95% CI 0.86–0.91, p trend < 0.001).
After multivariable adjustment, a strong inverse association was observed between hPDI
and T2D (Table 3), which was only modestly attenuated after BMI adjustment (pooled HR for
extreme deciles 0.66, 95% CI 0.61–0.72; HR per 10-unit increase 0.83, 95% CI 0.80–0.85, p
trend < 0.001). There was significant heterogeneity in the pooled estimates controlled for BMI
due to greater attenuation in NHS2. In contrast, uPDI was positively associated with T2D
(pooled HR for extreme deciles 1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.25, p trend < 0.001) (Fig 1).
Sensitivity Analyses
Our findings remained robust in several sensitivity analyses. In restricted cubic spline analysis,
we did not find evidence for a nonlinear association of either PDI or hPDI with T2D incidence.
Thus, both indices had significant linear associations with T2D incidence, with a stronger
dose-response relationship for hPDI (S1 Fig). Similar inverse associations were observed in
strata defined by physical activity and family history of diabetes (Fig 2). The inverse association
of PDI with T2D incidence was stronger in non-obese than in obese participants (p
interaction < 0.001), and the inverse associations of both PDI and hPDI were stronger in older
participants (p interaction = 0.02) (S3 Table). The associations of both PDI and hPDI with
T2D were virtually unchanged upon further adjustment for ethnicity, marital status, recent
physical exam, diet beverage intake, and indicators of socioeconomic status (S4 Table). Results
were also similar when the analysis was restricted to participants with fasting plasma glucose
screening in the previous 2 y (PDI: HR for extreme deciles 0.78, 95% CI 0.71–0.85, p
trend < 0.001; hPDI: HR for extreme deciles 0.65, 95% CI 0.59–0.71, p trend < 0.001). Contin-
uously updating PDI and hPDI throughout follow-up did not change results (S5 Table). When
we used baseline intakes of PDI and hPDI, associations were modestly attenuated but remained
significant (PDI: HR for extreme deciles 0.86, 95% CI 0.80–0.93, p trend < 0.001; hPDI: HR for
extreme deciles 0.70, 95% CI 0.64–0.75, p trend < 0.001). Associations were also modestly
attenuated when we used the most recent scores prior to diagnosis of T2D (PDI: HR for

 extreme deciles 0.84, 95% CI 0.78–0.91, p trend < 0.001; hPDI: HR for extreme deciles 0.74,
95% CI 0.69–0.80, p trend < 0.001). Stratified analysis showed no significant effect modifica-
tion by ethnicity for the diet indices (p interaction was 0.92 for PDI, 0.14 for hPDI, and 0.94 for
uPDI; S2 Fig).
To examine the individual contributions of healthy plant foods, less healthy plant foods,
and animal foods to T2D risk, we included variables for all three food types simultaneously in
the fully adjusted model; this allowed for mutual adjustment of the food types for one another,
and hence an evaluation of their independent associations with T2D incidence. Healthy plant
foods were inversely associated with T2D, while animal foods were positively associated, and
less healthy plant foods were not associated, with risk (S3 Fig).
To examine the effect of consuming a healthful plant-based diet that is also high in intake of
some animal foods known to be associated with reduced risk of several health outcomes (e.g.,
fish and yogurt [30–33]), we created two variations of hPDI. When we modified hPDI to score
fish/seafood intake positively, the pooled HRs were slightly attenuated (HR for extreme deciles
0.73, 95% CI 0.68–0.79; HR per 10-unit increase 0.87, 95% CI 0.85–0.89, p trend < 0.001).
Results for a modified hPDI with yogurt scored positively were not substantially different (HR
for extreme deciles 0.65, 95% CI 0.60–0.71; HR per 10-unit increase 0.83, 95% CI 0.81–0.85, p
trend < 0.001).
Previous analyses in these cohorts have found other dietary patterns such as the Mediterra-
nean diet, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (aHEI), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension (DASH) to be inversely associated with T2D [34–36]. Thus, in order to examine the
independent associations of PDI and hPDI with T2D incidence, we individually controlled for
these patterns (S6 and S7 Tables). Pooled HRs for both PDI and hPDI remained largely
unchanged when the Mediterranean diet was controlled for, and were only slightly attenuated
with aHEI or DASH in the same model.
Discussion
We found significant linear inverse associations of plant-based diets, especially a healthier ver-
sion (captured by hPDI), with T2D incidence in three prospective cohorts in the US. In con-
trast, a less healthy version of a plant-based diet (captured by uPDI) was associated with

 increased T2D risk. These associations were independent of BMI and other diabetes risk
factors.
There are several mechanisms through which a healthful plant-based diet could lower the
risk of T2D [37,38]. Such a diet would be rich in dietary fiber, antioxidants, unsaturated fatty
acids, and micronutrients such as magnesium, and low in saturated fat. Randomized clinical
trials have shown beneficial effects of diets high in viscous and soluble fiber on improving post-
prandial glucose as well as long-term glucose metabolism [39]. In addition, several prospective
studies have shown dietary fiber to be associated with reduced levels of inflammatory markers
[40,41]. Animal studies and epidemiologic studies among humans have shown antioxidants
such as polyphenols to have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, probably through
reduced oxidative stress and improved endothelial function [42]. High unsaturated fatty acid
and low saturated fat contents in diets have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory proper-
ties [43], while specific micronutrients such as magnesium are known to play a key role in glu-
cose metabolism [44]. Thus, a healthful plant-based diet could enhance glycemic control,
improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease chronic inflammation, thereby reducing T2D risk. In
addition, the high fiber and low calorie contents of many plant foods could further reduce T2D
risk by promoting weight loss/maintenance [37,38]. Another less well understood mechanism
could be through the gut microbiome. A healthful plant-based diet could promote a gut micro-
bial environment that facilitates the metabolism of fiber and polyphenols and discourages the
metabolism of bile acids, choline and L-carnitine, and amino acids, further reducing T2D risk
[45]. An unhealthful plant-based diet, on the other hand, would have high glycemic index and
load, reduced fiber, lower micronutrient content, and higher calorie content, which could
adversely affect the above-mentioned pathways, resulting in increased T2D risk [2,10,12]. Such
a diet would also have a high level of added sugar, which has been shown to be strongly associ-
ated with increased weight gain and T2D risk [12,46]. Given that BMI represents a pathway
through which plant-based diets may affect T2D risk, controlling for it would have resulted in
an underestimation of these diets’ true effects. Results from the final model controlling for BMI
characterize plant-based diet associations that are independent of their potential beneficial
effects on body weight. The association of PDI with decreased T2D incidence was also signifi-
cantly stronger for non-obese individuals than for obese individuals, which could represent a
true biological interaction of PDI with BMI (e.g., due to differential mediation by BMI in obese
and non-obese individuals) or could be a methodological artifact (e.g., as a result of differential
confounding or measurement error in the two strata).
Only a few prospective studies have examined the association of plant-based diets with
T2D. The Adventist Health Studies found significantly higher T2D mortality (odds ratio 1.9,
95% CI 1.2–3.1) and incidence (odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.80) among non-vegetarians
than vegetarians [7,8]. They also found consumption of vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian, and semi-
vegetarian diets to be associated with lower T2D risk relative to non-vegetarian diets [9]. All of
these studies were carried out among Seventh-day Adventists, a religious group that encour-
ages a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. Because the prevalence of vegetarianism is low in the US (~3%
[47]), it is difficult to study the relationship between vegetarianism and health outcomes in the
general US population. Defining a plant-based diet in terms of a continuous gradation of
adherence to a diet high in plant and low in animal foods has allowed us to study the associa-
tion of plant-based diets with T2D in more than 200,000 participants, utilizing detailed dietary
data collected at multiple time points over more than two decades.
Our study highlights the varying risk profiles associated with different versions of plant-
based diets, emphasizing the importance of considering the quality of plant foods consumed.
Participants in the highest decile of uPDI consumed half the amount of healthy plant foods
and almost double the amount of less healthy plant foods consumed by participants in the

 highest decile of hPDI. The healthier version of a plant-based diet proposed in this study may
inform future public health recommendations regarding plant-based diets. We also found that
even a modest lowering in animal food consumption was associated with substantially lower
T2D incidence. For instance, in the highest decile of hPDI, participants consumed ~4 servings/
day of animal foods, relative to 5–6 servings/day in the lowest decile. This has important public
health implications, as plant-based diets need not completely exclude animal foods. Numerous
studies have previously documented null or inverse associations of several animal foods (e.g.,
low-fat dairy, lean poultry, and fish and seafood) with T2D and other diseases, and consistent
positive associations of certain animal foods (e.g., red and processed meats) with such diseases.
Additionally, in our analysis the association of hPDI with T2D changed only slightly upon pos-
itively scoring fish and yogurt intake. Thus, the gradual reduction in animal food intake sug-
gested here can be achieved largely through reducing intake of low-quality animal foods.
Our findings provide support for the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee conclu-
sion that diets rich in healthy plant foods and lower in certain animal foods such as red and
processed meats are beneficial for the prevention of chronic diseases [6]. Another rationale for
shifting towards a plant-based diet is to improve food sustainability because food systems that
rely heavily on animal foods require more natural resources than those more reliant on plant
foods [48]. Thus, dietary guidelines that recommend a healthful plant-based diet would be
compatible with the health of humans as well as our ecosystem. The hPDI was only moderately
correlated with other commonly considered dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet,

 aHEI, and DASH, reflecting that this is a novel diet index that captures unique aspects of a
healthful plant-based diet. This, coupled with the strong inverse association of the hPDI with
T2D independent of these other dietary patterns, highlights the importance of focusing on a
healthful plant-based diet for a potentially environmentally sustainable approach to T2D
prevention.
Our study has several limitations. Because diet was self-reported, measurement errors are
inevitable. However, the use of cumulative measures of diet over time not only reduces these
errors but also represents long-term dietary habits [18]. We also made assumptions about the
healthfulness of different plant foods, which, although based on prior evidence, has an element
of subjectivity, and hence our findings need to be replicated in future studies. While we con-
trolled for several potential confounders, given the observational nature of these studies, resid-
ual or unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. However, several randomized controlled

 trials have found vegetarian diets to positively impact intermediate endpoints, such as body
weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, and insulin sensitivity, in those who were free of T2D [49–
51] and in patients with the disease [52–56]. The socioeconomic homogeneity of the study
population also enhances internal validity due to implicit control of confounders. Given that
we found similar associations between the plant-based diet indices and T2D among different
ethnic groups, it is likely that these findings are generalizable to diverse racial/ethnic groups.
Nevertheless, these studies were carried out among health professionals in the US, and hence it
would be important to replicate these findings in other populations representing diverse coun-
tries and occupational groups before translating these findings to other populations.
Conclusions
We found an inverse association between an overall plant-based diet and T2D incidence in
three prospective cohorts. This inverse association was stronger for an index that captured a
healthier version of the plant-based diet, but the association with T2D was positive for an
index that captured an unhealthful version of a plant-based diet. Our study supports current
recommendations to shift to diets rich in healthy plant foods, with lower intake of less healthy
plant and animal foods.
