Abstract
Importance—Readmission rates declined after announcement of the Hospital Readmission 
Reduction Program (HRRP), which penalizes hospitals for excess readmissions for acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), and pneumonia.
Objective—To compare trends in readmission rates for target and non-target conditions, stratified 
by hospital penalty status.

 Design, Setting, Participants—Retrospective cohort study of 48,137,102 hospitalizations of 
20,351,161 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries over 64 years discharged between January 1, 
2008 and June 30, 2015 from 3,497 hospitals. Difference interrupted time series models were used 
to compare trends in readmission rates by condition and penalty status.
Exposure—Hospital penalty status or target condition under the HRRP.
Outcome—30-day risk adjusted, all-cause unplanned readmission rates for target and non-target 
conditions.
Results—In January 2008, the mean readmission rates for AMI, HF, pneumonia and non-target 
conditions were 21.9%, 27.5%, 20.1%, and 18.4% respectively at hospitals later subject to 
financial penalties (n=2,189) and 18.7%, 24.2%, 17.4%, and 15.7% at hospitals not subject to 
penalties (n=1,283). Between January 2008 and March 2010, prior to HRRP announcement, 
readmission rates were stable across hospitals (except AMI at non-penalty hospitals). Following 
announcement of HRRP (March 2010), readmission rates for both target and non-target conditions 
declined significantly faster for patients at hospitals later subject to financial penalties compared 
with those at non-penalized hospitals (AMI, additional decrease of −1.24 (95% CI, −1.84, −0.65) 
percentage points per year relative to non-penalty discharges; HF, −1.25 (−1.64, −0.65); 
pneumonia, −1.37 (−0.95, −1.80); non-target, −0.27 (−0.38, −0.17); p<0.001 for all). For penalty 
hospitals, readmission rates for target conditions declined significantly faster compared with non-
target conditions (AMI: additional decline of −0.49 (−0.81, −0.16) percentage points per year 
relative to non-target conditions, p=0.004; HF: −0.90 (−1.18, −0.62), p<0.001; pneumonia: −0.57 
(−0.92,−0.23), p<0.001). By contrast, among non-penalty hospitals, readmissions for target 
conditions declined similarly or more slowly compared with non-target conditions (AMI: 
additional increase of 0.48 (0.01, 0.95) percentage points per year, p=0.05; HF: 0.08 (−0.30, 0.46), 
p=0.67; pneumonia: 0.53 (0.13, 0.93), p=0.01). After HRRP implementation in October 2012, the 
rate of change for readmission rates plateaued (p<0.05 for all except pneumonia at non-penalty 
hospitals) with the greatest relative change observed among hospitals subject to financial penalty.
Conclusions—Patients at hospitals subject to penalties had greater reductions in readmission 
rates compared with those at non-penalized hospitals. Changes were greater for target conditions 
at penalized hospitals, but not at non-penalized hospitals.
Background
The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) was enacted under Section 3025 of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010 and imposed financial 
penalties beginning in October 2012 for hospitals with higher than expected readmissions 
for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (HF), and pneumonia among 
their fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries.1 Since the program’s inception, thousands of 
hospitals have been subjected to penalties now totaling nearly a billion dollars.2,3
A recent examination of trends in readmission rates demonstrated that across all hospitals, 
readmission rates significantly declined for target conditions (AMI, HF, pneumonia) and 
non-target conditions, with a greater decline for the former, following announcement of the 
HRRP.4 It is not known whether trends in readmission rates overall, as well as specifically 
for target and non-target conditions, differed based upon whether a hospital was subject to

 penalties under the HRRP. Such information could offer insights into the mechanisms of the 
effect of HRRP on hospital performance. For example, reductions in readmission that are 
limited to hospitals later subject to financial penalty and/or that are larger in magnitude for 
target as compared with non-target conditions would suggest either that hospitals responded 
to anticipated or actual penalties, or that penalized hospitals with higher baseline 
readmission rates were more able to achieve reductions. By contrast, more widespread 
changes would suggest that all hospitals responded to the threat of potential penalties, or 
were equally able to reduce readmissions. Similarly, comparable reductions in readmission 
rates among target and non-target conditions would suggest hospitals implemented broad, 
system-wide interventions to reduce readmissions, whereas selective reductions in 
readmissions for target conditions would suggest hospitals implemented narrower, 
condition-specific strategies.
Accordingly, we sought to compare trends in readmission rates for target and non-target 
conditions among patients hospitalized at hospitals that were and were not penalized under 
the HRRP.
Methods
Study Cohort
We used Medicare fee for service (FFS) claims data for January 1, 2008 through June 30, 
2015 to identify hospital admissions. Study cohorts were defined consistent with CMS 
methods for public reporting as well as HRRP, the details of which have been published 
previously.5–7 Briefly, for condition specific measures, we used International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify discharges 
of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with a principal discharge diagnosis of 
acute AMI, HF, and pneumonia. To define a cohort for non-target conditions, we used 
methodology for the hospital-wide readmission measure, which has also been described 
previously.8,9 This measure excludes admissions for medical treatment of cancer and uses 
ICD-9 codes to assign remaining hospitalizations to one of 5 cohorts – medicine, surgery/
gynecology, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology. For this study, we removed 
hospitalizations for AMI, HF, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
and hip or knee arthroplasty surgery from the non-target condition cohort. We excluded 
COPD and hip or knee arthroplasty surgery patients as these conditions were added to the 
HRRP program during the study period. We also excluded patients discharged from 
hospitals that were not eligible for HRRP (psychiatric, rehabilitation, long term care, 
children’s, cancer and critical access hospitals, as well as all hospitals in Maryland). Patients 
who died during the hospitalization or did not have at least 30 days of post-discharge 
enrollment in Medicare FFS were excluded as were patients who left the hospital against 
medical advice or were enrolled in hospice at the time of admission or at any time in the 
previous 12 months.
Hospital Penalty Status
We obtained data on which hospitals were subject to penalties at the time HRRP was 
implemented in October 2012 from the CMS website.10 Hospitals were first privately

 provided, by CMS, their readmission rates along with national rates for heart failure in 
August 2008 (calendar year 2006 data), then in April 2009 privately received readmission 
rates for AMI, HF, and pneumonia (July 2005–June 2008 data), prior to public reporting in 
July 2009. In April 2010, shortly after the HRRP was announced, hospitals received similar 
reports for July 2006 to June 2009, which included the first penalty year (initial penalty 
based upon performance in July 2008 to June 2011). By this time, two of the three years 
used to determine HRRP penalties had already passed (eTable 1 in the Supplement). 
Therefore, prior to the actual implementation of HRRP in October, 2012, poor performing 
hospitals were likely aware of their risk for impending financial penalties.
Outcome
The outcome was discharge-level 30-day risk-adjusted all-cause unplanned readmission. For 
all calculations of readmission, we used a CMS algorithm to exclude planned readmissions 
for procedures or diagnoses that are typically elective or scheduled such as maintenance 
chemotherapy and organ transplant.11,12 If a patient experienced multiple readmissions 
within the post-discharge period of the index hospitalization, only the first readmission was 
counted.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of hospitals that were and were not subject to penalties under the HRRP were 
obtained from the American Hospital Association annual survey (2013) and were compared 
using Chi-square testing. To examine time trends we calculated a single risk-adjusted 
monthly readmission rate for each cohort: AMI, HF, pneumonia and non-target conditions, 
stratifying by discharge from a hospital that received a penalty in fiscal year 2013 or not. We 
used a single rate for each month to avoid the challenges of estimating and modelling 
hospital level rates for monthly denominators that were often very low. We estimated the 
monthly rates for each cohort using a linear probability model, with readmission as 
dependent variable, all risk factors from the corresponding publicly-reported measure as 
independent variables, and an indicator for each calendar month. All independent variables 
except month were centered on their overall mean for the cohort, and the intercept was 
suppressed to allow all monthly indicators to remain in the model. The coefficients for each 
month were then used as the estimated adjusted monthly rate for that cohort.
To determine the effect of the HRRP on readmission rates we estimated a set of interrupted 
time series models using the adjusted monthly rate as the dependent variable. Interrupted 
time series models can incorporate both overall and trend effects of one or more events, or 
interruptions, in a long-term trend.13,14 Each model included a monthly time trend variable, 
indicators for the post-announcement and post-implementation periods, as well as terms for 
the interaction of announcement and implementation dates with the overall monthly trend 
during the period after that date. In this approach the overall trend in readmission rate 
(“time”) is deconstructed into three components – the slope in readmission rates in the pre-
HRRP period (Jan 2008 through March 2010); the change in slope in the post-HRRP 
announcement but pre-HRRP implementation period relative to the pre-HRRP period (April 
2010 through September 2012); andthe additional change in slope in the post HRRP 
implementation period (October 2012 through June 2015), relative to the announcement

 period. In addition, the coefficient of the time period indicators represents any overall effect 
independent of changes in the slopes.
We first examined the effect of the HRRP announcement and implementation on trends in 
readmission rates by constructing eight interrupted time series models: two each for AMI, 
HF, pneumonia and non-target conditions, stratifying discharges based upon whether they 
were or were not from hospitals subjected to financial penalties. To determine whether there 
was a differential effect on discharges from penalty vs. non-penalty hospitals, we then 
estimated analogous models using as dependent variable the difference in monthly rates for 
each condition between penalty and non-penalty hospitals (“difference models”). To assess 
whether there was a differential change in target versus non-target conditions, we estimated 
another set of difference models using as dependent variable the difference in monthly rates 
between each target condition and all non-target conditions.
For non-differenced interrupted time series models we used linear regression models with 
autoregressive error terms. We first estimated a series of models with no independent 
variables and a range of autoregressive terms to identify the best error structure and then 
used that structure in the final models. For the differenced outcome interrupted time series 
models we identified no autoregressive term and used ordinary linear regression. All 
analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.3.0 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC) 
and Stata version 14.1 (Stata Corp, College Station TX). All tests for statistical significance 
were 2-tailed and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. The Yale University Human 
Investigation Committee accepted a waiver of consent and approved this analysis.
Results
The study cohort consisted of 48,137,102 hospitalizations and 7,964,608 readmissions 
among 20,351,161 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged between January 1, 
2008 and June 30, 2015 from 3,497 hospitals. Characteristics of hospitals that were and were 
not subject to penalties under the HRRP are shown in eTable 2. As compared with non-
penalty hospitals (n=1283, 37%), penalty hospitals (n=2214, 63%) were larger, more likely 
to be teaching hospitals and had higher proportions of Medicaid patients. The annual 
number of hospital discharges and readmissions for each target condition and for non-target 
conditions, stratified by hospital penalty status, is shown in Table 1. The volume of 
hospitalizations for target conditions and non-target conditions declined gradually over the 
course of the study period for both penalized and non-penalized hospitals.
Effect of the HRRP on readmission rates, stratified by hospital penalty status
Monthly, risk-adjusted all-cause readmission rates for the three target conditions and the 
non-target conditions for patients discharged from hospitals that were and that were not 
subject to the HRRP penalty are shown in the Figure (Panels A–D) and Table 2. In January 
2008, the mean readmission rates for AMI, HF, pneumonia and non-target conditions were 
21.9%, 27.5%, 20.1%, and 18.4% respectively at hospitals later subject to financial penalties 
under HRRP and 18.7%, 24.2%, 17.4%, and 15.7% at hospitals not subject to HRRP 
penalties. Between January 2008 and March 2010, prior to HRRP announcement, 
readmission rates were stable for target and non-target conditions regardless of penalty

 status except for AMI, for which readmission rates were declining at 0.78 percentage points 
per year (95% CI, −1.18, −0.38) among hospitals that were not later subject to penalties. 
After announcement of HRRP, trends in readmission rates differed significantly based upon 
hospital penalty status. Specifically, readmission rates declined by 1.30 percentage points 
per year (95 % CI, −1.88, −0.72) for AMI compared with the pre-announcement period, by 
1.72 percentage points per year (95% CI, −2.36, −1.08) for heart failure, and by 1.36 
percentage points per year (95% CI, −2.09, −0.63) for pneumonia among patients discharged 
from hospitals later subject to penalties (p<0.001 for all). In contrast, hospitals not subject to 
penalties saw no significant change in readmission rates for any of the three target 
conditions after HRRP announcement (AMI: −0.08 percentage points per year (SE 0.29); 
HF: −0.45 (95% CI, −1.10, 0.20), pneumonia: −0.03 (95% CI, −1.15, 1.10); p=NS for all).
For non-target conditions, we observed more modest but statistically significant declines in 
readmission rates after announcement of HRRP regardless of whether or not the patient was 
discharged from a hospital that was penalized (penalty: −0.81 percentage points per year 
(95% CI, −1.23, −0.39); non-penalty: −0.54 (95% CI, −0.85, −0.23); p<0.001). After HRRP 
implementation in October 2012, the rate of change for readmission rates plateaued relative 
to the change observed after announcement but prior to implementation, for both target and 
non-target conditions among both penalty and non-penalty discharges (p<0.05 for all except 
pneumonia at non-penalty hospitals), with the greatest relative change observed among 
hospitals subject to financial penalty. As a result, readmission rates for target and non-target 
conditions have not significantly changed since October 2012 across hospitals regardless of 
penalty status.
The results of the difference interrupted time series models, which determine the difference 
between readmission rates for penalty versus non-penalty hospitals, stratified by condition, 
are shown in Table 3. Prior to the announcement of the HRRP, readmission rates for patients 
at hospitals later subject to a penalty were declining less rapidly than those for patients at 
hospitals not later subject to financial penalties (AMI, increase of 0.72 percentage points per 
year for penalty hospital discharges vs non-penalty hospital discharges (95% CI, 0.26, 1.19); 
HF 0.35 (95% CI, 0.04, 0.65); pneumonia, 0.48 (95% CI, 0.15, 0.81); p<0.05 for all). 
However, between April 2010 and October 2012, after the announcement but prior to the 
actual implementation of the HRRP, readmission rates began to improve significantly faster 
for patients at hospitals later subject to financial penalties (AMI, decrease of −1.24 
percentage points per year for penalty hospital discharges vs non-penalty hospital discharges 
(95% CI, −1.84, −0.65); HF, −1.25 (95% CI, −1.64, −0.86); pneumonia, −1.37 (−1.80, 
−0.95); p<0.001 for all).
For non-target conditions, penalty and non-penalty hospitals were improving at similar rates 
prior to HRRP announcement (difference of −0.01 percentage points per year (95% CI, 
−0.09, 0.07), p=0.83). Upon announcement of the HRRP but prior to its implementation, 
readmission rates began to converge but more modestly than observed for target conditions 
(relative decrease of −0.27 (95% CI, −0.38, −0.17) percentage points per year for penalty 
hospital discharges vs non-penalty hospital discharges, p<0.001).

 Comparison of the effect of the HRRP on target and non-target conditions, stratified by 
hospital penalty status
The results of the difference interrupted time series models, which determine the difference 
for target versus non-target conditions, stratified by hospital penalty status, are shown in 
Table 4. At hospitals that were subject to financial penalties under HRRP, in the period after 
announcement of the HRRP, the reductions in readmissions for AMI, HF, and pneumonia 
were significantly greater than the reductions observed for non-target conditions (AMI: 
relative decline of −0.49 percentage points per year (95% CI, −0.81, −0.16), p=0.004; HF: 
−0.90 (95% CI, −1.18, −0.62), p<0.001; pneumonia: −0.57 (−0.92, −0.23), p<0.001). In 
contrast, at hospitals that were not subject to financial penalties under HRRP, there was no 
differential improvement in readmission rates for target conditions. Reductions in 
readmissions were either comparable for the target and non-target conditions or greater for 
the non-target conditions (AMI: relative increase of 0.48 percentage points per year (95% 
CI, 0.01, 0.95), p=0.05; HF: 0.08 (95% CI, −0.30, 0.46), p=0.67; pneumonia: 0.53 (95% CI, 
0.13, 0.93), p=0.01).
Discussion
Our longitudinal examination of trends in readmission rates among Medicare beneficiaries 
demonstrates that the significant reductions in readmission observed after announcement of 
financial penalties under the HRRP program occurred primarily at hospitals that were 
subject to financial penalties. Still further, readmission rates for target conditions declined 
significantly more than rates for non-target conditions at hospitals later subject to HRRP 
penalties, which suggests that these hospitals specifically focused efforts to improve 
readmission outcomes for patients admitted for these target conditions. In contrast, at 
hospitals not subject to financial penalties, readmission rates for non-target conditions had 
declines comparable with those for target conditions, which suggests that broader, system-
wide readmission reduction strategies were more likely to have been employed as opposed 
to strategies focusing solely on the target conditions. Finally, across all hospitals, 
readmission rates for target and non-target conditions have not significantly changed since 
October 2012. These findings have important implications for future policy programs aimed 
at reducing readmissions and provide insight into the effect of external incentives.
This analysis helps elucidate the mechanism by which financial penalties in the HRRP were 
effective. Hospital readmission performance for AMI, HF, and pneumonia for 2005–2008 
was privately reported to hospitals beginning in April 2009 and publicly displayed on 
Hospital Compare beginning in July 2009. Yet, readmission rates were stable between 
January 2008 and March 2010, suggesting minimal effect of public reporting alone. Other 
studies have found similar results.15 Moreover, announcement of the HRRP in April 2010 
was associated with a significant decrease in readmissions, particularly for target conditions 
and primarily among patients discharged from hospitals that had the highest readmission 
rates initially and were thus later subject to penalties. Specifically, it appears that the 
announcement of the policy was associated with improvement because it was coupled with 
the knowledge that the hospital was likely to face a financial penalty. Low-performing 
hospitals appear to have proactively responded to the threat of penalties, likely because they

 were aware of their performance; higher performing hospitals did not respond in the same 
way, suggesting that they felt less urgency to specifically improve for the target conditions. 
These results are consistent with a recent survey of hospital leaders, which reported that 
66% felt that the HRRP had a major impact on system efforts to reduce readmission rates.16 
Policymakers considering payment penalty programs should thus consider whether the 
results on which they are based are available – ideally in advance of implementation – to the 
relevant stakeholders. Finally, the fact that the rate of change for 30-day readmission rates 
have plateaued for all conditions since October 2012 raises a number of important 
considerations. This may reflect that after initially realizing reductions in readmissions with 
modest investment and interventions, additional reductions in readmissions may be less 
feasible or may require larger scale investment with smaller marginal benefit. Still further, 
hospitals may have assessed the competing financial impact of readmissions on revenue and 
the potential penalty under the HRRP and determined that the net effect of additional 
reductions in readmission was not fiscally advantageous. The question of whether additional 
reductions in readmission rates can be realized and if so, what policy and payment levers 
will be most effective in doing so remains an important priority for further study.
A recent study demonstrated that in the period after the HRRP, readmission rates for both 
target and non-target conditions declined significantly, with larger reductions among the 
former, and that readmission rates did not appear to decline as a consequence of increased 
use of observation services.17 The current analysis extends this work in a number of ways. 
First, it incorporates each hospital’s penalty status and suggests important differences in the 
association of the HRRP with trends in readmission rates based upon whether a hospital was 
or was not subject to a financial penalty. An overall analysis without regard to penalty status 
masks the heterogeneity we report and the policy implications that follow. In addition, the 
present analysis used the publicly reported hospital wide readmission measure cohort as the 
comparator population (non-target conditions) and excluded patients with the target 
conditions as well as admissions for COPD and hip-knee replacement surgery as these 
conditions are now included in HRRP.
There are several limitations to this analysis. First, while the interrupted time series is a 
valid, quasi-experimental approach to evaluating changes over time, it by design attributes 
observed changes to a single factor (the HRRP in this instance). Reducing readmissions had 
been an important priority for several years prior to HRRP and there were several national 
quality improvement programs focusing on readmission reduction over the time period of 
this study. For instance, the CMS Partnership for Patient’s Hospital Engagement Networks 
(starting April 2011) and the CMS Community-based Care Transitions Program (starting 
February 2012), may have also contributed to the temporal trends.18–20 Nonetheless, those 
national quality improvement programs were unlikely to have been very effective so early 
after initiation, and even if they contributed, uptake was likely influenced by knowledge of 
the impending HRRP penalties. Moreover, most hospitals in the nation participated in 
Hospital Engagement Networks, yet we observed effects only among penalty hospitals. 
Second, the disproportionate improvement among patients discharged from penalty hospitals 
may be a result of “regression to the mean,” in which random variation causing outlier 
performance is reduced in subsequent periods. If regression to the mean were a substantial 
influence, however, one would have expected similar regression to the mean among high

 performing outliers – that is, a worsening of readmission rates among non-penalty hospitals. 
This effect was not present, reducing the likelihood that regression to the mean explains the 
results. Third, the precise mechanism for the observed differential improvements is 
unknown: hospitals with high readmission rates that were responding to the HRRP may have 
found it easier to reduce readmissions, invested more resources, prioritized readmission 
reduction interventions to a greater degree, or a combination thereof. Fourth, hospitals were 
stratified based on penalty status at the time of HRRP implementation in FY2013 even 
though Medicare reassessed hospitals’ penalty status each fiscal year. However, 84.3% of 
hospitals retained the same penalty status in both years and hospitals that changed status 
were subject to much smaller average penalties that those that did not.10,21 As additional 
longitudinal data become available, analyses of the effects of changing financial penalties 
over time to further define the association of the HRRP on readmission rates should be 
undertaken. Fifth, observation stays were not included in this analysis. However, prior 
work17 has suggested that reductions in readmission were not realized by increasing use of 
observation stays and therefore it is unlikely that this would have meaningfully affected our 
study results. Sixth, to the approach does not account for differential coding practices across 
hospitals or changes in documentation over time which could have affected our results. 
Seventh, whether the observed reductions in readmissions have been associated with 
changes in other quality measures, particularly 30-day risk standardized mortality measures, 
remains an important question that warrants additional study.
Conclusions
In summary, hospitals subject to penalties under HRRP had greater reductions in 
readmission rates as compared with non-penalized hospitals. Changes were greater for target 
condition, as compared with non-target conditions, at the penalized hospitals, but not at non-
penalized hospitals.

 Key Points
Question
Was the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) associated with different 
changes in readmission rates for targeted and non-targeted conditions among penalized 
and non-penalized hospitals?
Findings
In this longitudinal cohort study of 48,137,102 hospitalizations among 20,351,161 
Medicare fee-for-service patients across 3497 hospitals, announcement of the HRRP was 
associated with significant reductions in readmissions at hospitals later subject to 
penalties, with significantly larger reductions for target conditions. Hospitals not subject 
to financial penalties experienced comparable reductions in readmissions for target and 
non-target conditions. Readmission rates plateaued across all hospitals after 
implementation of the HRRP.
Meaning
Hospitals subject to penalties under HRRP had greater reductions in readmission rates 
compared with non-penalized hospitals. Changes were greater for target vs non-target 
conditions at the penalized hospitals, but not at non-penalized hospitals.

Risk adjusted readmission rates stratified by hospital penalty status for acute myocardial 
infarction (A), heart failure (B), pneumonia (C), and non-target condition (D) cohorts from 
January 2008 to June 2015. The vertical lines represent announcement of the Hospital 
Readmission Reduction Program (March 2010) and its subsequent implementation (October 
2012). Readmission rates are risk-adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity and principal diagnosis 
(for non-target condition group).
