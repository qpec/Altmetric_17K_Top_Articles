Study of monogenic forms of obesity has demonstrated the 
pivotal role of the central leptin–melanocortin pathway in 
controlling energy balance, appetite and body weight1. The 
majority of loss-of-function mutations (mostly recessive or 
co-dominant) have been identified in genes that are directly 
involved in leptin–melanocortin signaling. These genes, how-
ever, only explain obesity in < 
5% of cases, predominantly 
from outbred populations2. We previously showed that, in a 
consanguineous population in Pakistan, recessive mutations 
in known obesity-related genes explain ~30% of cases with 
severe obesity3–5. These data suggested that new monogenic 
forms of obesity could also be identified in this population. 
Here we identify and functionally characterize homozygous 
mutations in the ADCY3 gene encoding adenylate cyclase 3 in 
children with severe obesity from consanguineous Pakistani 
families, as well as compound heterozygous mutations in a 
severely obese child of European-American descent. These 
findings highlight ADCY3 as an important mediator of energy 
homeostasis and an attractive pharmacological target in the 
treatment of obesity.
Obesity, with its complications, has emerged as a major contribu-
tor to the global health burden and has assumed the status of a pan-
demic6. At least 2.8 million people die each year as a consequence 
of being overweight or obese7. Although obesity is one of the most 
heritable diseases8, the genetic etiology of a large proportion of obe-
sity cases remains elusive.
Here we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis 
in 138 probands who presented with severe, early-onset obesity 
(body mass index (BMI) s.d. score (SDS) ≥3) and their available 
family members (n = 117) from consanguineous families from 
the Punjab province of Pakistan. These 138 probands were part 
of a larger cohort of 195 probands, 57 of whom were previously 
found to carry mutations in known obesity-related genes and were 
excluded from the present investigation (published3–5 and unpub-
lished data; Fig. 1a). Through successive filtration steps (Fig. 1a), we 
identified four severely obese children from three unrelated families 
(Fig. 1b, families (F) 1–3) who had new or extremely rare homozy-
gous mutations in ADCY3. The three potentially causative muta-
tions included a frameshift mutation, c.3315del (NM_004036.4), 
which encodes p.Ile1106Serfs*3 (NP_004027.2) (hereafter referred 
to as ADCY3Mut-I); a splice-site mutation, c.2578–1 G> 
A (hereafter 
referred to as ADCY3Mut-II); and a nonsynonymous missense muta-
tion, c.191 A> 
T, which encodes p.Asn64Ile (hereafter referred to 
as ADCY3Mut-III) (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Both the 
ADCY3Mut-I and ADCY3Mut-II variants were new and not present in 
the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) dataset, dbSNP or 
the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) database. The splice-site vari-
ant ADCY3Mut-II was predicted to abolish the splice acceptor site 
(Supplementary Note). ADCY3Mut-III (rs541941351) is documented 
in the ExAC database with a global frequency of 3 × 10−4. All of the 
parents were heterozygous carriers of the respective ADCY3 muta-
tions (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). ADCY3 was found within 
a large (30- to 68-Mb) region of homozygosity that was shared by 
affected subjects (data not shown). Notably, our filtration process 
did not report recessive variants in any other gene that putatively 
causes monogenic obesity (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 2–4).
In a separate and independent investigation, WES analysis 
identified a compound heterozygous ADCY3 mutation in a child 
with severe obesity who was from a nonconsanguineous family of 
European-American heritage (Fig. 1b, F-4). This compound hetero-
zygous mutation included a frameshift mutation, c.1268del (which 
encodes p.Gly423Alafs*19; hereafter referred to as ADCY3Mut-IVa) 
and one that resulted in an amino acid deletion, c.3354_3356del 
(which encodes p.Phe1118del; hereafter referred to as ADCY3Mut-IVb)

(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). The ADCY3Mut-IVa variant was 
new, whereas the ADCY3Mut-IVb (rs750852737) variant has been doc-
umented in the ExAC dataset with a global frequency of 4 × 10−5. 
ADCY3Mut-IVa and ADCY3Mut-IVb were paternally and maternally 
inherited, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). All of the observed 
mutated sites in ADCY3 are highly conserved across various spe-
cies, suggesting that these sites have evolutionary significance 
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
ADCY3 is a member of a family of ten related cyclases that cata-
lyze the synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP, of which nine are 
anchored to the plasma membrane. We first assessed the dynamic 
and structural consequences of the mutations on ATP binding. 
Homology modeling followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simu-
lations was performed to investigate conformational changes in 
terms of the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) param-
eter (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Note). Structural analysis was 
possible for only the ADCY3Mut-I and ADCY3Mut-II proteins, for 
which the crystal structures of the relevant ADCY3 domains were 
available. The structures of the mutant proteins showed destabiliza-
tion of the backbone atoms, which resulted in partial unfolding of 
the catalytic domains. These changes in the mutant proteins dis-
placed ATP from its binding site, whereas the wild-type (WT) pro-
tein remained stable for the entire simulation period. The residual 
flexibility profile for each of the two proteins indicated more fluc-
tuations (r.m.s. fluctuation; RMSF) in the mutant proteins than in 
WT ADCY3, thus predicting the inability of the mutant protein to 
bind ATP. We therefore hypothesized that these mutations would 
result in destabilization of the ADCY3 catalytic domains, leading to 
a loss of protein function.
To further test this hypothesis, we transiently overexpressed 
recombinant Myc-tagged WT ADCY3 (Myc-hADCY3WT) or each of 
the four mutant proteins (Myc-ADCY3Mut-I, Myc-ADCY3Mut-II, Myc-
ADCY3Mut-III and Myc-ADCY3Mut-IVb) in baby hamster kidney (BHK) 
cells. The expression and cellular localization of the Myc-tagged 
WT and mutant ADCY3 proteins were equivalent, as monitored by 
protein blotting and immunofluorescence analyses (Supplementary 
Figs. 3 and 4). Also, transient expression of either Myc-hADCY3WT 
or each of the mutant variants did not significantly alter basal cAMP 
levels as compared to those in cells transfected with the control plas-
mid (Fig. 2d). Stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by treatment 
of the cells with forskolin and concomitant inhibition of endog-
enous phosphodiesterases by treatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-
xanthine (IBMX) led to a significantly greater increase in cAMP 
levels in cells that overexpressed either Myc-hADCY3WT or Myc-
ADCY3Mut-III (~50-fold relative to nontreated cells) versus those that 
expressed the control plasmid, Myc-ADCY3Mut-I, Myc-ADCY3Mut-II 
or Myc-ADCY3Mut-IVb (~25-fold increase relative to untreated cells) 
(Fig. 2d). These data provide support for the idea that catalytic 
activity is affected in ADCY3Mut-I, ADCY3Mut-II and ADCY3Mut-IVb 
but not in ADCY3Mut-III. Similar results were found by using lucif-
erase assays—the stimulatory effect of ADCY3Mut-I, ADCY3Mut-II and 
ADCY3Mut-IVb on the activity of a cAMP-responsive element reporter 
construct (CRE-Luc) in response to IBMX and forskolin treatment 
was lower (9-fold, 7-fold and 9-fold increase, respectively) than 
that for hADCY3WT (13-fold increase) and ADCY3Mut-III (11-fold 
increase) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Characterization of the protein 
encoded by a nonsynonymous (p.Ser107Pro) and common SNP 
variant (rs11676272) in identical assays showed catalytic activity 
comparable to that of hADCY3WT (Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, 
evaluation of ADCY3 mRNA levels in the white blood cells of the 
members of family 1 (F-1; for whom mRNA was available) showed 
that these were similar in the affected child carrying a homozygous

ADCY3Mut-I mutation and her unaffected heterozygous sibling 
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
Taken together, these data imply that ADCY3Mut-I, ADCY3Mut-II 
and ADCY3Mut-IVb are loss-of-function variants that dramatically 
and directly affect the catalytic activity of the encoded protein 
and, thereby, cAMP production. ADCY3Mut-III, which failed to alter 
ADCY3 catalytic activity, encodes a small polar amino acid residue 
(replacing a large hydrophobic residue) in the globular cytosolic 
N-terminal domain that likely restricts the protein conformation. 
This suggests that ADCY3Mut-III might lead to impaired ADCY3 
function and thereby promote obesity in the affected patient via 
impaired G-protein-coupled receptor interactions. However, the 
possibility remains that there is another obesity-associated muta-
tion in this proband that was missed by our very stringent gene-
screening strategy. Overall, our genetic and functional data support 
the identification of a novel form of monogenic obesity associated 
with mutations in ADCY3.
Consistent with our observations of subjects with ADCY3 muta-
tions (Fig. 1 and Table 1), Adcy3−/− mice are hyperphagic and obese9. 
Hyperphagia in the probands was first reported between 0.5 and 2.0 
years of age. Family members who were WT or heterozygous for 
ADCY3 presented normal body weight, except for the parents of 
proband 2 (P2), who reportedly were accustomed to fat- and carbo-
hydrate-enriched food (Supplementary Table 1). Notably, the three 
probands P1, P3 and P4 were anosmatic when clinically tested, an 
observation that is in agreement with findings in Adcy3−/− mice10. 
Sense of smell was, however, only slightly abnormal in P2 and 
his affected cousin. Two affected patients (P1 and P3) had slight-
to-moderate intellectual disability despite normal body growth, 
whereas probands P2 and P4 did not have any intellectual dis-
abilities. No dysmorphic features were observed. The only affected 
female (P1), the oldest of the four probands, experienced menarche 
at 14 years of age but had no subsequent menstrual cycles. In this 
subject, excessive adiposity was accompanied by hyperlipidemia 
and insulin resistance (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). 
These observations are also consistent with those of Adcy3−/− mice, 
which exhibit an age-related increase in adiposity9.
ADCY3 is expressed in the hypothalamus, and selective ablation 
of Adcy3 in the mouse hypothalamus results in a significant increase 
in body fat mass11. Conversely, mice with a gain-of-function muta-
tion in Adcy3 have less fat than WT mice and are resistant to obe-
sity when fed a high-fat diet12. ADCY3 is known to mediate the 
action of hormones involved in energy, lipid and glucose control13. 
Anorexigenic gut peptides, such as GLP1, that utilize G-protein-
coupled receptors for signaling act centrally to control appetite by 
upregulating ADCY3-mediated cAMP production14. Moreover, the 
antidiabetic drug liraglutide (a GLP1 agonist) enhances expression 
of Adcy3 at the mRNA and protein levels15, resulting in a weight-
reducing effect through its direct effect on the hypothalamus16. 
This suggests that pathogenic mutations in ADCY3 result in inter-
ference of several anorexigenic signaling cascades. Furthermore, 
ADCY3–cAMP signaling is also known to regulate the proliferation

and differentiation of adipocytes and intracellular processes related 
to adipogenesis and lipolysis17. Adcy3 haploinsufficient (Adcy3+/–) 
mice exhibit increased adipogenesis and adiposity without hyper-
phagia18. Therefore, potent peripheral ADCY3–cAMP-driven regu-
lation of adiposity and body weight may also exist in humans, and 
pharmacological compounds that affect ADCY3 activity may elicit 
beneficial effects in obese individuals.
Our genetic and functional human data strongly suggest that 
recessive pathogenic mutations in ADCY3 cause monogenic severe 
obesity. Of note, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have 
demonstrated a consistent association between frequent variants 
in ADCY3 and both BMI and fat mass19–24, which is reminiscent 
of MC4R and PCSK1, for which both frequent and rare DNA vari-
ants have also been linked to common and monogenic obesity, 
respectively21. Apart from its association with obesity-related traits, 
ADCY3 has been implicated through GWAS in other disorders 
including ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s 
disease25. Furthermore, increased methylation of sites in ADCY3 
and its promoter region has been associated with increased BMI26,27. 
ADCY3-associated obesity, therefore, recapitulates both the genetic 
and epigenetic mechanisms that have previously been shown for 
POMC26. Identification of novel forms of monogenic obesity in 
consanguineous families makes it important to screen inbred pop-
ulations in the quest to identify novel pathways and physiological 
mechanisms leading to obesity that could remain unexposed in 
nonconsanguineous populations.

Methods
Study subjects. The 138 probands included in this study were part of a larger 
cohort of 195 subjects with severe obesity (BMI SDS >3). The subjects were 
recruited from public hospitals in the central province of Punjab, Pakistan, and 
written consent was obtained from the patients or parents. The study protocol was 
approved by the ethics and/or research committees of Children’s Hospital and the 
University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan. Consent to publish photos was obtained 
in all cases. Probands and/or their parents were interviewed to obtain family 
and medical history, and family pedigrees spanning at least three generations 
were constructed. At initial presentation, the recruitment of the proband and of 
accompanying parents, if available, was made on a strictly voluntarily basis. In case 
a homozygous variant suspected of its association with obesity was identified, other 
members of the affected family were invited to participate in the study, subject to 
their availability. Clinical cases of syndromic obesity were excluded from the study. 
Anthropomorphic measurements and physical examination were carried out, and 
blood samples were obtained in each case for subsequent DNA extraction and 
biochemical analyses. The single case of a child of European–American ancestry 
included in the present study was referred to the outpatient clinic in Maastricht 
University Medical Center to establish the genetic cause of obesity. After receiving 
genetic counseling the parents provided written consent to participate in the study.
Smell test. Smell testing of probands from Pakistan and their family members was 
performed at the ‘Ear, nose and throat’ (ENT) unit of Children’s Hospital Lahore. 
Preceding the test for a possible loss of ability to smell, the subject was thoroughly 
examined for upper respiratory infections, rhinitis and chronic sinusitis or for the 
presence of nasal masses such as polyps. A semiquantitative test was administered 
to assess smell function based on the patient’s response to three different sniff 
odorants, each at four serial dilutions, presented in a random sequence. The 
subjects were blindfolded before testing. The test was scored (0–12) on the subject’s 
correct responses. The individual scores reflected the extent of loss of olfactory 
function (normosmia: 10–12; mild to moderate microsmia: 5–9; acute microsmia: 
3–4; anosmia: 0–2). No adjustments were made for age or sex. The European–
American proband with the compound heterozygous mutation was not tested for 
smell but was reported to have no sense of smell.
Preliminary genetic screening. All probands (except the European–American 
case) were primarily screened for pathogenic mutations in the coding exons of 
LEP and MC4R by conventional sequencing. A further 27 genes that were known 
to be associated with nonsyndromic and syndromic obesity were analyzed using 
a one-step PCR-based microdroplet enrichment step (RainDance Technologies) 
followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), as previously described3 (Fig. 1a). 
Additionally, genome-wide genotyping was performed to find structural variants 
in obesity-associated genes. These screening procedures identified 57 probands 
with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in known obesity-associated genes 
(published3–5 and unpublished data).
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and data analysis. Genomic DNA samples from 
the remaining 138 probands and their available family members were processed 
using the Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon Kit (version V5 + UTRs; Agilent 
Technologies) or the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ MedExome Target Enrichment 
Kit (Roche NimbleGen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The first group 
of 96 samples processed through the Agilent protocol were sequenced using 
an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina) with 100-bp paired-end reads, 
whereas the second group of 159 samples was processed using the NimbleGen 
protocol and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina) with 
150-bp paired-end reads. The demultiplexing of sequence data was performed 
with bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software (Illumina). Subsequently, sequence reads 
from FASTQ files were mapped to the human genome (hg19/GRC37) using 
the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner, and a local realignment was processed using the 
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). Variant calling was performed using GATK 
HaplotypeCaller. Only genotypes with a sequencing depth of > 
8× were selected 
for further analyses. The variant annotation was performed using the Ensembl Perl 
API and other Perl scripts to include data from the dbSNP and dbNSFP databases. 
All DNA samples were sequenced with an average read depth of > 
80× .
For the child of European–American descent, WES analysis was performed 
in the index patient and both parents (trio approach). Exome capture was carried 
out using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Enrichment Kit (Agilent 
Technologies). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq platform (BGI, 
Copenhagen, Denmark), and the data were analyzed with BWA (read alignment) 
and GATK (variant calling) software packages using default parameters.
Variant prioritization and candidate gene discovery. Autosomal recessive 
homozygosity for disease-associated mutation(s) was expected in all probands 
with consanguineous parentage. To identify candidate genes and/or mutations 
associated with obesity, variations in each family were filtered individually to detect 
potentially causative homozygous mutations in affected individuals. In the initial 
filtration step, all heterozygous variants present in obese individuals were removed. 
Because the likelihood of any novel causative or deleterious variant annotated in 
publicly available databases is low, variants with an allele frequency of  > 
0.01% 
in the 1000 Genomes Project database, the Exome Variant Server (EVS) and the 
Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database were excluded. Finally, any 
homozygous variants in family members exhibiting a normal body weight (BMI < 
28) 
 
were excluded from further analysis. PolyPhen and MutationTaster in silico 
mutation-prediction software were used to predict pathogenicity. Variants that 
were synonymous were also removed from further analyses. Potentially deleterious 
mutations that were present in runs of homozygosity (ROH) were given priority for 
further analysis. Using this approach (Fig. 1a), an average of ~16,000 high-quality 
variants were initially identified per individual from paired-end reads, which 
was reduced to 10–15 variants after filtering (Supplementary Tables 2–4). Genes 
identified in ≥ 
2 families were considered candidates for obesity. Following these 
sequential steps, we identified ADCY3 as a valid candidate gene for obesity.
As a first step, the European–American proband was screened against a 
diagnostic Kallmann syndrome/hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (KS/HH) gene 
panel that included 26 genes associated with KS/HH. No potentially pathogenic ‘de 
novo’
, homozygous, compound heterozygous or X-linked variants were detected in 
the coding or splice-site regions of these 26 genes through filtering steps using ESP 
dbSNP and in-house databases, and dbSNP at a frequency level of < 
1%. Because 
of the negative results obtained with the KS/HH panel, we continued by using a 
stringent filtering regimen for the rest of the variants. This involved filtering for  
< 
5% in dbSNP, < 
1% in the in-house database and > 
3.5% in phyloP for variants 
located in coding regions and splice sites. The filtration step reduced the number 
of variants to 109. One synonymous variant in ACAD10 was identified based on 
the GATK score. By filtering for de novo, homozygous or compound heterozygous 
variants, only three variants were identified (Supplementary Table 7). Of these 
variants, compound heterozygous variants of ADCY3 were of most interest, as 
these corroborated well with the patient’s phenotype.
Mutations identified in ADCY3. The mutations identified in consanguineous 
families included a homozygous frameshift mutation c.3315del; p.Ile1106Serfs*3 
(ADCY3Mut-I). This mutation in the last exon (coding exon 21) of the ADCY3 gene 
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1) results in a truncated protein by introducing a 
stop codon after two aberrant amino acids. The second variant, c.2578-1 G> 
A  
(ADCY3Mut-II) was identified as a splice-site mutation. Here, the nucleotide 
substitution abolished the essential splice acceptor site at intron 15 as predicted 
by the Human Splicing Finder (Supplementary Note). As a result of exon 
skipping, the mutated protein consists of only 1,091 amino acids instead of the 
usual 1,144 amino acids. The third homozygous variant, c.191 A> T; p.Asn64Ile 
(ADCY3Mut-III) was a missense mutation. The fourth mutation that was identified 
in a nonconsanguineous European–American family is a compound heterozygous 
mutation c.1268del; p.Gly423Alafs*19 (ADCY3Mut-IVa) and c.3354_3356del; 
p.Phe1118del (ADCY3Mut-IVb).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and mutational analysis. 
Mutations identified in ADCY3 gene through WES analysis were confirmed in the 
probands and their family members by standard PCR and Sanger sequencing using 
a 3730 DNA analyzer (Life Technologies). Sequence traces were analyzed using the 
Mutation Surveyor software package (SoftGenetics). The PCR primer sequences 
and thermocycler conditions are available in Supplementary Table 8.
ADCY3 expression analysis. Blood (2 ml) was drawn in PAXgene Blood RNA 
tubes, and RNA was extracted using the PAXgene RNA Blood kit (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ADCY3 gene expression was analyzed 
for P1 (ADCY3Mut-I homozygote) and a family member (ADCY3Mut-I heterozygote) 
by qRT–PCR. Briefly, 300–500 ng of total RNA was converted to cDNA using the 
High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Life Technologies) in a final reaction of 20 µ 
l.  
Gene expression was performed by TaqMan assay (Life Technologies) using 
the following primers: hADCY3 FAM (Hs01086502_m1) and internal control 
housekeeping gene B2M VIC (Hs00984230_m1). All qPCR reactions were set up in 
triplicate in a 384-well plate (Life Technologies). Each well contained 1 μ 
l of cDNA 
(diluted 1:3) and 9 μ 
l of the reaction mix, i.e., 5 μ 
l of TaqMan Gene Expression Mix 
(cat no. 4370048, Life Technologies), 0.5 μ 
l of target and control probes and 3 μ 
l  
of nuclease-free water to make a total reaction volume of 10 μ 
l. The qPCR was 
performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). The 
2–ΔΔCT method was used to quantify the level of ADCY3 in both samples against a 
standard control.
Whole-genome genotyping. Genome-wide high-density genotyping was 
performed by using the HumanOmni 2.5 S BeadChip KIT (Illumina) containing  
> 
2.5 × 106 variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 2.5%, according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. A genotyping project was created in GenomeStudio 
using the standard cluster file, and the genotypes were assigned to each SNP based 
on the fluorescence intensity data. A reproducibility and heritability report was 
generated to ensure that the parent-to-child heritability frequency (P-C heritability 
freq) was ≥ 
0.99. Finally, the cluster file was exported, and reports were generated 
for subsequent calling of ROH.
Detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH). ROH were detected using the plink 
open-source whole-genome association analysis toolset to identify an autozygous

region in the affected inbred individuals. The genotyping data were subjected 
to quality control to remove individuals missing > 
5% genotype data, excluding 
SNPs with a MAF ≤ 
0.05, markers that failed to comply with a Hardy–Weinberg 
threshold of 0.001, and individuals and/or markers on the basis of the Mendelian 
error rate (ME).
Biochemical determinations. Serum hormone concentrations were measured in 
duplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially 
available kits (insulin and cortisol, Monobind; leptin, Organium Laboratories), 
using an EIA analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Samples were analyzed according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The inter-assay and intra-assay variations 
were < 
10%. All other biochemical analytes (blood glucose, serum triglycerides, 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C; 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D, creatinine 
and blood urea nitrogen) were determined by chemiluminescence assays 
(CHEMIFLEX). Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were used to measure 
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
Molecular modeling. Stepwise molecular modeling was performed to determine 
the structural consequences of the mutations identified in ADCY3. Briefly, 
homology modeling of hADCY3WT or the ADCY3 mutants was coupled with 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for model refinement. Molecular docking 
of a magnesium–ATP molecule on the catalytic site followed by a long-run MD 
simulation of the docked complex was carried out to assess the stability of the 
backbone of the mutant ADCY3 molecules (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). In this 
study, ADCY3Mut-I (p.Ile1106Serfs*3; the encoded protein has a shorter sequence of 
1,108 amino acids, instead of 1,144, after translation of two aberrant amino acids, 
serine and leucine) and ADCY3Mut-II (c.2578-1 G> 
A; the encoded protein has a 
sequence of 1,091 amino acids instead of 1,144) were used for homology modeling 
with hADCY3WT. In the case of compound heterozygous mutant, ADCY3Mut-IVa and 
ADCY3Mut-IVb (p.Gly423fs*19 and p.Phe1118del. respectively), the first mutation 
occurs in the C1 catalytic domain and causes the translation of 18 aberrant amino 
acids followed by a premature stop codon. Consequently, native folding of this 
protein is predicted to fail due to a marked truncation of the catalytic domain, and 
the protein is likely to assume an unpredictable conformation that may lead to a 
loss of function. PDB IDs 1CS4 for C1 domain and 1AZS to model C2 domain 
were used.Modeling of the truncated domain conformation was not possible 
due to a lack of known structural information in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). 
Further analysis of the hADCY3WT structure showed that the amino acids lacking 
in p.Gly423fs*19 are normally involved in the interaction with Mg–ATP, the C2 
catalytic domain and Gαs, and correct conformation of this region of the protein is 
necessary for normal function. Homology models of hADCY3WT and the mutants 
were refined by MD simulations to further elucidate molecular docking with 
Mg–ATP. AutoDock Vina28 was used to study the predicted docked conformations 
of ADCY3 with ATP and the binding affinity of Mg–ATP at the catalytic interface 
in hADCY3WT and the mutant ADCY3 proteins. Assessment of ATP–Mg docking 
at the interface of both ADCY3 catalytic domains, where cAMP is catalyzed in 
response to G protein signaling, was performed as described (Supplementary 
Note). To further investigate the stability of docked complexes, a production-
simulations run of 200 ns at 300 K and 1 bar pressure in explicit solvation 
model (with TIP3P water module) was performed in each case after a stepwise 
minimization and equilibration. The AMBER 16 simulation package was used 
throughout for all simulations (see Supplementary Note for detailed protocol).
Generation of constructs expressing wild-type or mutant ADCY3. Full-
length ADCY3 was amplified from a human ADCY3 cDNA clone (NM_004036, 
cat. no. RC220272; Origene, Maryland, USA) using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA 
Polymerase (New England BioLabs, Massachusetts, USA). The forward and reverse 
primers, showing restriction sites for AscI and NotI, respectively, are given in 
Supplementary Table 9. The resulting 3.4-kb PCR fragment was verified by gel 
electrophoresis, digested with AscI and NotI, and column-purified. The AscI–
NotI fragment with the ADCY3 gene was then cloned into the polylinker of the 
pCMV6-AN-Myc mammalian expression vector, which contains an N-terminal 
Myc tag (Origene, cat. no. PS100012). The ligated plasmid was transformed in 
DH5α 
 competent cells (Invitrogen, California, USA), which were then plated onto 
ampicillin-containing (50 µ 
g/ml) LB agar (Sigma) medium, and individual colonies 
were analyzed after 24 h of growth at 37 °C. The resulting wild-type plasmid 
(Myc-hADCY3WT) was verified by sequencing. Each of the four ADCY3 mutations 
(ADCY3Mut-I, ADCY3Mut-II, ADCY3Mut-III and ADCY3Mut-IVb) was introduced into the 
Myc-hADCY3WT plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis using the Q5 Site-Direct 
Mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs). Primers for mutagenesis were designed 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and the sequences (5′ 
 to 3′ 
)  
are given in Supplementary Table 10. The amplified products were transformed 
into DH5α cells as described above, and the plasmid sequences were again verified 
by sequencing before functional analyses. pcDNA3 without any inserted DNA 
sequence was used as the control plasmid in cell-based assays.
Cell culture and transient transfection. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  
cells (ATCC) were maintained in a volume ratio of 1:1 Dulbecco’s modified  
Eagle’s medium with nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells  
(ATCC) were maintained in BHK medium (DMEM, 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 
2 mM glutamine) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were 
passaged by trypsinization every 3 d. A total of 3,000 BHK cells/well were seeded 
in 24-well plates (Nalge Nunc International) with or without 18-mm-in-diameter 
glass cover slips and cultured in BHK medium. After 72 h, cells were transfected 
with 500 ng of the indicated plasmids using 0.5 µ 
l jetPEI (Polyplus, Illkirchen, 
France) in 1.1 ml BHK medium. After 72 h, the wells were washed with PBS  
before further analysis.
Protein blotting. For protein blotting, cells were detached in PBS containing 
10 mM EDTA at 37 °C and concentrated by centrifugation, and the pellets were 
resuspended in Laemmli’s sample buffer followed by brief sonication. Samples 
were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), and subsequent immunoblotting 
was performed using rabbit anti-Myc antibodies (1:3,000; Sigma, C3956) or 
anti-ADCY3 (raised against the extracellular domain; 1:1,000; Alomone Labs, 
Jerusalem, Israel) as previously described29. Secondary antibodies (horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP)-coupled donkey anti-rabbit; GE Healthcare) were used at a 
1:3,000 dilution, and binding was detected by ECL (GE Healthcare). Proteins were 
detected by Ponceau’s stain, and all blots were imaged using FLUORCHEM 8000 
(Alpha Innochem).
Immunocytochemistry. Cells grown on coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed  
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 2% saponin and incubated 
with antibodies, as previously described29. The antibodies, rabbit anti-Myc  
(1:300; Sigma, C3956) and anti-ADCY3 (Alomone Labs), were used at a dilution of 
1:100. The secondary antibodies were used at a 1:3,000 dilution (Cy3 donkey anti-
rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Confocal analysis was performed as previously 
described29 using a Zeiss LSM 510 meta-confocal microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, 
Germany) with an ApoPLAN 63× objective lens.
cAMP assay. Levels of cAMP production were determined at 37 °C in BHK cells 
that had been transfected with pcDNA3 or with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged 
hADCY3WT or the mutants. Cells were washed in Krebs–Ringer buffer (KRB) 
(135 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 
10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, 0.1% BSA; pH 7.4) and subsequently 
incubated for 30 min in KRB in the presence or absence of 2 µ 
M forskolin and 
0.1 mM IBMX30. Following incubation, KRB was aspirated, and the cells were 
solubilized with a solution of 0.1 M HCl and 1% Triton X-100 (300 µ 
l/well) at 
37 °C for 30 min. The cell solution was centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 
the supernatants were either stored at –80 °C or assayed directly using the Cyclic 
AMP Direct EIA Kit (Arbor Assays). Total protein content of the supernatants was 
determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Luciferase activity. CHO cells (1 × 105) were plated in 96-well dishes and 
transiently transfected with 1 µ 
g of plasmid, which included 400 ng of CreLuc 
reporter31 with 50 ng pCMV-betaGal (for normalization) plus 100 ng of the ADCY3 
expression plasmids or the empty vector, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent 
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection (44 h) the 
cells were incubated with fresh medium supplemented with 2% FCS and 100 µ 
M 
IBMX plus 1 µ 
M forskolin or DMSO (vehicle) for 4 h. The cells were then washed 
with PBS and lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). O-nitrophenyl-β 
-d-
galactopyranoside (ONPG) was used as the substrate for β 
-galactosidase activity, 
and the colored reaction product was measured with a microplate reader at an 
absorbance wavelength of 450 nm. Luciferase activities were measured with 25 µ 
l of the protein extract by using the Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activity was calculated as 
relative luminescence units (RLUs) normalized against β 
-galactosidase activity.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using OriginPro 8.5.0. 
Significance of differences was calculated by performing unpaired one-way 
ANOVA and a Bonferroni post hoc test. The number of times an experiment was 
performed and the number of replicates in each case are provided in figure legends 
(Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 3b, 6 and 7). Actual P values (considered up to 
three decimal places) are given in the relevant figure legends. Wherever necessary, 
single data points of independent experiments are also represented.

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
The probands with severe early onset obesity were recruited on presentation at 
the paediatric units of hospitals situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The 
objective was to identify cases of monogenic obesity.  The family members when 
available, were also recruited in the study.  The nature of study did not allow 
sample size calculatation, a priori.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
Obese subjects with clinical syndromic obesity were not recruited.  
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
All experimental observations/findings were successfully replicated rand the 
results reliably reproduced.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
Grouping of samples/patients was not applicable to this study.
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Not blinded
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the 
Methods section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same 
sample was measured repeatedly
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
The test results (e.g. P values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
A clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars
See the web collection on statistics for biologists for further resources and guidance.

�   Software
Policy information about availability of computer code
7. Software
Describe the software used to analyze the data in this 
study. 
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner ; GATK; MutationTaster; Polyphen-2;; bcl2fastq2 
Conversion Software (Illumina); Mutation Surveyor package (SoftGenetics),  
AMBER 16 simulation package and PLINK version 1.7. 
For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the paper but not yet described in the published literature, software must be made 
available to editors and reviewers upon request. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Nature Methods guidance for 
providing algorithms and software for publication provides further information on this topic.
�   Materials and reagents
Policy information about availability of materials
8.   Materials availability
Indicate whether there are restrictions on availability of 
unique materials or if these materials are only available 
for distribution by a for-profit company.
Not applicable
9.   Antibodies
Describe the antibodies used and how they were validated 
for use in the system under study (i.e. assay and species).
For Immunofluorescence  and Western blotting: Rabbit anti-Myc (Sigma) and 
Rabbit anti-ADCY3 (Alomone). Immunoassay of hormones was performed using 
commercially available ELISA kits
10. Eukaryotic cell lines
a.  State the source of each eukaryotic cell line used.
The CHO and BHK cells were obtained from ATCC
b.  Describe the method of cell line authentication used.
No authentication used
c.  Report whether the cell lines were tested for 
mycoplasma contamination.
No
d.  If any of the cell lines used are listed in the database 
of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by 
ICLAC, provide a scientific rationale for their use.
No
�    Animals and human research participants
Policy information about studies involving animals; when reporting animal research, follow the ARRIVE guidelines
11. Description of research animals
Provide details on animals and/or animal-derived 
materials used in the study.
Not applicable
Policy information about studies involving human research participants
12. Description of human research participants
Describe the covariate-relevant population 
characteristics of the human research participants.
The study is based on WES analysis in 138 probands with early onset severe non 
syndromic obesity with a BMI SDS of >3.0, that were found negative for mutations 
in known obesity associated genes. Family members subject to their availability, 
were also recruited (n= 117 ).   The probands were recruited on presentation at the 
paediatric units of hospitals situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan.  Written 
consent was obtained in all cases.
