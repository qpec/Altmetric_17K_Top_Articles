IMPORTANCE Long-term multivitamin use had no effect on risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in the Physicians’Health Study II. Baseline nutritional status may have modified the
lack of effect.
OBJECTIVE To investigate effect modification by various baseline dietary factors on CVD risk
in the Physicians’Health Study II.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Physicians’Health Study II was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing multivitamin use (multivitamin [Centrum Silver]
or placebo daily) among US male physicians. The Physicians’Health Study II included 14 641
male physicians 50 years or older, 13 316 of whom (91.0%) completed a baseline 116-item
semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and were included in the analyses. This study
examined effect modification by baseline intake of key foods, individual nutrients, dietary
patterns (Alternate Healthy Eating Index and Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score), and
dietary supplement use. The study began in 1997, with continued treatment and follow-up
through June 1, 2011.
INTERVENTIONS Multivitamin or placebo daily.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major cardiovascular events, including nonfatal myocardial
infarction, nonfatal stroke, and CVD mortality. Secondary outcomes included myocardial
infarction, total stroke, CVD mortality, and total mortality individually.
RESULTS In total, 13 316 male physicians (mean [SD] age at randomization, 64.0 [9.0] years in
those receiving the active multivitamin and 64.0 [9.1] years in those receiving the placebo)
were observed for a mean (SD) follow-up of 11.4 (2.3) years. There was no consistent evidence
of effect modification by various foods, nutrients, dietary patterns, or baseline supplement
use on the effect of multivitamin use on CVD end points. Statistically significant interaction
effects were observed between multivitamin use and vitamin B6 intake on myocardial
infarction, between multivitamin use and vitamin D intake on CVD mortality, and between
multivitamin use and vitamin B12 intake on CVD mortality and total mortality. However, there
were inconsistent patterns in hazard ratios across tertiles of each dietary factor that are likely
explained by multiple testing.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results suggest that baseline nutritional status does not
influence the effect of randomized long-term multivitamin use on major CVD events. Future
studies are needed to investigate the role of baseline nutritional biomarkers on the effect of
multivitamin use on CVD and other outcomes.

ultivitamin dietary supplements usually contain
most of the essential vitamins and minerals in
amounts that tend to mirror those optimally ob-
tained through diet, and their use aims to prevent nutritional
deficiencies or insufficiencies. More than 50% of older US
adults take a multivitamin supplement,1 often with the in-
tent to improve or maintain health.2 However, the evidence
of health benefits from multivitamin use remains scarce, with
the US Preventive Services Task Force concluding that there
isinsufficientevidencetorecommendfororagainstuseofmul-
tivitamins to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).3
Observational prospective and case-control cohort stud-
ies have reported mixed results on multivitamin use and risk
of CVD,4-10 likely reflecting diversity in study populations,
outcomes, types of multivitamins used, and residual con-
founding because multivitamin users tend to have particular
lifestyle and dietary patterns.11-15 Randomized clinical trials
are the optimal study design to eliminate confounding and
determine causality. The Physicians’Health Study II (PHS II),
the only completed randomized clinical trial to date testing
the effect of a common broad-spectrum, low-dose multivita-
min on CVD, included 14 641 male physicians 50 years or
older and previously reported no overall effect of multivita-
min use on major CVD events during a median of 11.2 years
of follow-up,16 but it significantly reduced the incidence of
total cancer17 and cataract.18 In addition, baseline age
appeared to modify the effect of multivitamin use on CVD
where men 70 years or older had a nonsignificant lower risk
of major CVD events. However, little is known about the role
of multivitamins in CVD prevention among individuals with
increased nutrient requirements.
Therefore, we investigated whether baseline nutritional
status may explain the lack of an overall effect of multivita-
minuseonCVDinthePHSII.Wesoughttounderstandwhether
baseline intake of key foods, nutrients, dietary patterns, and
dietary supplements modified the long-term effect of multi-
vitamin use on major CVD and mortality in the PHS II.
Methods
Study Population
The PHS II has been described previously.16,19,20 In brief, the
PHS II was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial evaluating the effects of the follow-
ing supplements in the prevention of cancer, CVD, eye dis-
ease,andcognitivedecline:amultivitamin(multivitamin[Cen-
trumSilver]orplacebodaily)(eTableinSupplement1),vitamin
E (400 IU of synthetic alpha-tocopherol or placebo on alter-
nate days), vitamin C (500 mg of synthetic ascorbic acid or pla-
cebo daily), and beta-carotene (50 mg of beta-carotene or
placebo on alternate days).
ThePHSIIrecruitmentwasdonein2phases.Phase1began
in July 1997, when 18 763 men from the PHS I without a history
ofcirrhosisoractiveliverdisease,nottakinganticoagulantagents,
and not having serious illnesses that may hinder participation
were invited to participate. Men also had to be willing to forgo
useofmultivitaminsorindividualsupplementscontainingmore
than100%oftherecommendeddietaryallowanceofvitaminE,
vitamin C, beta-carotene, and vitamin A. Men with a history of
myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or cancer remained eligible.
Phase2beganinJuly1999,when254597additionalUSmalephy-
sicians 50 years or older using the same eligibility criteria as for
thePHSIparticipantswereinvitedtoparticipate.Intotal,14 641
men50yearsorolder(including7641participantsfromthePHS
I and 7000 new participants) were randomized into the PHS II.
Before randomization, 754 men (5.1%) had a history of MI or
stroke.Fortheanalysesherein,weincluded13 316men(91.0%)

Key Points
Question Does baseline nutritional status explain the lack of an
effect of multivitamin use on risk of cardiovascular disease in the
Physicians’Health Study II?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 13 316 male physicians
observed for a mean (SD) follow-up of 11.4 (2.3) years, there was
no consistent evidence of effect modification by various foods,
nutrients, dietary patterns, or baseline supplement use on the
effect of multivitamin use on cardiovascular disease end points.
Meaning Long-term multivitamin use does not prevent major
cardiovascular disease events in men, regardless of baseline
nutritional status.

 Nine possible responses, ranging from “never or less than once
per month” to “6+ times per day,” were recorded. We calcu-
lated the mean daily intake (servings per day) of total fruits and
vegetables,wholegrains,nuts,dairyproducts,andredandpro-
cessed meats. The reproducibility and validity of intake of in-
dividual food items has been reported to be reasonable, with
correlations ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 for fruits and vegetables,
0.6 to 0.7 for whole grains, 0.4 to 0.9 for dairy products, 0.2
to 0.6 for red meat, and 0.5 for fish.21
Nutrient Intake and Supplement Use
Intakes of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin C, vitamin
D, calcium, and magnesium (not taking into account contri-
butions from randomization treatments) were calculated by
multiplyingtheintakefrequencybythenutrientcontentofthe
specified portion size.22 All nutrients were energy adjusted
using the residual method.23 Prerandomization use of multi-
vitamins and other vitamin and mineral supplements was also
assessed and has been validated in women from the Nurse’
s
Health Study24 and in men from the Health Professionals Fol-
low-up Study.25
Dietary Patterns
TheAlternateHealthyEatingIndex(AHEI)26isbasedon11com-
ponents, with a score between 0 and 10 given proportionally
tointakesofthefollowing:vegetables,fruits,wholegrains,nuts
and legumes, long-chain omega-3 fats (docosahexaenoic acid
and eicosapentaenoic acid), polyunsaturated fatty acids, mod-
erate alcohol consumption, sugar-sweetened drinks and fruit
juices, red and processed meat, trans-fat, and sodium. The
AHEI ranges from 0 to 110, with a higher score representing a
healthier diet. The Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED) Score
is based on 9 components, with 1 point given if intake is above
the median PHS II intake for vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts,
whole-grain cereals, fish, and the ratio of monounsaturated
fattyacidstosaturatedfattyacids.Forredandprocessedmeats,
1 point was given if intake was below the median; for alcohol
intake, 1 point was given if intake ranged from 10 to 15 g/d.
A higher score represents better adherence to the aMED, rang-
ing from 0 and 9.
CVD End Points and Follow-up
Major cardiovascular events (including nonfatal MI, nonfatal
stroke, and CVD mortality) represented a prespecified co-
primary end point for the PHS II trial, along with total cancer.
Secondary end points included total MI and total stroke; we
alsoconsideredischemicstroke,cardiovasculardeath,andtotal
mortality for these analyses. An end points committee of phy-
sicians masked to randomized multivitamin treatment assign-
ment confirmed self-reported end points based on relevant
medical records. An MI was confirmed according to the World
Health Organization criteria, electrocardiogram criteria, or ab-
normal concentrations of cardiac enzymes.27 Stroke was de-
fined as a typical neurological deficit, sudden or rapid in on-
set,andlastingmorethan24hours.Strokeswerealsoclassified
according to major subtype (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or un-
known), with excellent interobserver agreement (Cohen
κ = 0.96).28 Deaths were identified through reports from fam-
ily members, postal authorities, and the National Death In-
dex. Follow-up rate of morbidity was 98.2% and follow-up rate
of mortality was 99.9%.
Statistical Analysis
Primary analyses were based on the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to
calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of CVD, which were
stratified on the presence of CVD at randomization and ad-
justed for age (in years), PHS cohort (original PHS I partici-
pant or new PHS II participant), and randomized vitamin E, vi-
tamin C, and beta-carotene assignments.
To investigate effect modification of randomized multi-
vitamin treatment on CVD events by baseline nutritional sta-
tus, we computed HRs of CVD for multivitamin use stratified
by tertiles of intake for food groups, individual nutrients, and
dietary patterns, including the AHEI and aMED Score. We also
investigated effect modification by baseline dietary patterns
by restricting our analyses to men 70 years or older and to men
compliant with the multivitamin intervention, defined as tak-
ing at least two-thirds of the study pills.
A global test for interaction between randomized multi-
vitamintreatmentandeachbaselinenutritionalfactorwasper-
formed by computing a Wald statistic. All statistical analyses

Results
Baseline Nutritional Characteristics
In total, 13 316 male physicians were observed for a mean (SD)
follow-up of 11.4 (2.3) years. In Table 1, baseline nutritional fac-
tors are summarized according to randomized multivitamin
treatment assignment, and there were no significant differ-
ences in intakes observed comparing the placebo group vs the
active multivitamin group. Adherence to active multivitamin
and its respective placebo was 76.8% and 77.1% at 4 years
(P = .71), 72.3% and 70.7% at 8 years (P = .15), and 67.5% and
67.1% at the end of follow-up (P = .70).
Main PHS II Trial Findings
In previously published main PHS II trial analyses, randomiza-
tion to daily multivitamin use had no effect on the primary end
pointofmajorcardiovascularevents(HR,1.01;95%CI,0.91-1.10)
andthesecondaryendpointsoftotalMI(HR,0.93;95%CI,0.80-
1.09)andtotalstroke(HR,1.06;95%CI,0.91-1.23).16Furthermore,
multivitamin use was not statistically significantly associated
with total mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-1.02) or CVD mor-
tality (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.09).
Effect Modification by Baseline Food Intake
In Table 2, we summarize results for the effect of multivita-
min use on major CVD end points and total mortality strati-
fiedbybaselineintakeofrepresentativefoodgroups.Therewas
no evidence of any statistically significant interaction be-
tween multivitamin use and any of the food groups on risk of
CVD mortality and total mortality.

 Effect Modification by Baseline Nutrient Intake
In Table 3, we summarize results of the effect of multivita-
min use on CVD and mortality by baseline nutrient intake, with
no consistent patterns by either specific nutrient. Most inter-
actionstestedrevealednoeffectmeasuremodificationbybase-
line nutrient intake, with a few potential exceptions that are
more likely explained by chance and multiple testing. There
were statistically significant interaction effects between mul-
tivitamin use and vitamin B12 intake on CVD mortality (P = .04
for interaction) and total mortality (P = .04 for interaction), but
with inconsistent patterns in HRs across tertiles of vitamin B12
intake. We also found a statistically significant interaction ef-
fect between multivitamin use and vitamin B6 intake on risk
of MI (P = .01 for interaction). Finally, there was a statistically
significant interaction between multivitamin use and vita-
min D intake on CVD mortality (P = .03 for interaction).
Effect Modification by Baseline Dietary Patterns
In Table 4, we summarize results for effect modification by
baselinedietarypatternsasrepresentedbytheAHEIandaMED
Score. We found no evidence that the effect of multivitamin
use was modified by either dietary pattern (P > .05 for inter-
action for all). Men in the highest tertile of the aMED Score
(score of 5-9) randomized to receive the active multivitamin
had a nonsignificant reduction in MI.
We further investigated whether dietary patterns modi-
fied the effect of multivitamin use among 3583 men 70 years
or older. In these analyses, men receiving the active multivi-
taminhadastatisticallysignificantreductioninMIiftheywere
in the second tertile of the AHEI (HR for active multivitamin
vs placebo, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.32-0.82 or in the highest tertile of
the aMED Score (HR for active multivitamin vs placebo, 0.55;
95% CI, 0.37-0.81).
We performed sensitivity analyses restricted to men who
were adherent to the active multivitamin or placebo, defined
as taking at least two-thirds of the study pills. We found no evi-
dence that our results were affected by compliance with the
multivitamin intervention.
Effect Modification by Baseline Dietary Supplement Use
We also investigated whether the effect of multivitamin use
and risk of major CVD and total mortality was modified by pre-
randomization use of multivitamins, vitamin E supplements,
and total number of dietary supplements taken. We found no
evidence of effect modification.

ThePHSIIincludedphysicianparticipants,whohadonaverage

eralizabilityoftheseresultstopopulationswithdifferentdietary
patterns is subject to caution.
Given the persistent and common use of multivitamins in
older US adults,1 it is important to understand the long-term
effects of multivitamin use and how they may be influenced
by baseline nutritional status. Whereas individual and lim-
ited combinations of vitamins and minerals were previously
tested at much higher amounts than can be achieved through
diet alone,29 a multivitamin more closely approximates nu-
tritionalintakethatmaybeachievedviaawell-balanced,heart-
healthy diet.
Men who have lower dietary vitamin and mineral intake
may be expected to benefit more from taking a multivitamin
compared with men who already have sufficient micronutri-
ent intake. This practice would most likely extend to averting
nutritional insufficiency or deficiency, but it has been un-
clear whether improvements in nutritional status extend to re-
ductions in CVD and other major morbidity. Our results sug-
gest that multivitamin use among men with lower intake of
major dietary factors did not lower risk of CVD or total mor-
tality.However,thePHSIIincludedmalephysicians,whowere

 required ranges or extremes of dietary intake to sufficiently
distinguish whether particular subgroups of men may ben-
efit more or less from multivitamin use based on baseline nu-
tritional status. Optimally, the evaluation of nutritional bio-
markers would provide a more objective assessment of
nutritional status and complement our findings.
Another consideration is multivitamin use in older men,
in whom pathophysiological changes may affect nutrient ab-
sorption and subsequent nutritional status, altering vitamin
and mineral requirements.31 Diet alone may not be enough to
meet these changes in nutritional requirements. For ex-
ample, vitamin B12 deficiency is highly prevalent among adults
65 years or older because of poor diet and diminished absorp-
tion associated with age.32 However, in our analyses, men 70
years or older who were in the highest tertiles of the AHEI and
more adherent to the aMED had reductions in MI with multi-
vitamin use.
To date, the PHS II remains the only completed, long-
term randomized clinical trial that has tested a commonly
used multivitamin supplement with amounts of all essential
vitamins and minerals to help meet recommended daily
intakes or dietary allowances. Moreover, to our knowledge,
this trial is the first study that has investigated whether
baseline nutritional status modifies the effect of multivita-
min use on risk of CVD. Previous clinical trials that investi-
gated the modifying role of baseline nutritional status on
CVD risk were limited to individual or selected combinations
of vitamins and minerals at much higher amounts than were
found in the multivitamin tested in the PHS II. Furthermore,
most of these trials were conducted among higher-risk
populations, making comparisons across studies difficult.
The Women’
s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular
Study33 tested a combination of folic acid (2.5 mg/d), vita-
min B6 (50 mg/d), and vitamin B12 (1 mg/d) among female
health professionals at higher risk of CVD, with no evidence
of effect modification by baseline folate intake or multivita-
min use. In contrast, the China Stroke Primary Prevention
Trial34 tested a folic acid supplement (0.8 mg/d) among
hypertensive women and men and reported stronger reduc-
tions in stroke among participants with the lowest baseline
folate blood concentrations (<5.6 ng/mL) (to convert folate
level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.266).
Only a few prospective cohort studies have examined if
an association between multivitamin use and CVD risk is
modified by baseline dietary intake. In the Women’
s Health
Study,35 the association between multivitamin use and risk
of CVD was modified by age and fruit and vegetable intake,
with women who were older or who had low fruit and veg-
etable intake having a lower risk. Moreover, a prospective
cohort study36 of Swedish men demonstrated that dietary
supplement use was associated with lower CVD mortality
only among men with an inadequate diet. These results
highlight the importance of additional research on the role
of baseline nutritional status when investigating the use
of multivitamins (and other dietary supplements) in CVD
prevention.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. The PHS II was a large-scale,
long-term randomized clinical trial that tested a commonly
used multivitamin, with high compliance and long follow-
up. Randomization of multivitamin use eliminates any
potential confounding by overall healthy behavioral factors,
which typically limits findings from observational studies.
Moreover, we had data on a wide range of dietary factors to
comprehensively investigate the potential modifying role of
baseline nutritional status. However, several important limi-
tations should be considered. Dietary intake was self-
reported via an FFQ; therefore, measurement error may
have influenced our results. Dietary status was only assessed

 at baseline; different effects may have been observed if
changes in diet had been taken into account. The multivita-
min formulation used has changed incrementally over the
years; for example, vitamin D content is higher in current
formulations than in that tested throughout the PHS II trial
period. However, the formulations are similar overall, and
any small differences are unlikely to affect the generalizabil-
ity of our findings to a high extent. Concomitant medication
use for treating CVD risk factors, such as hypercholesterol-
emia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, may also have
influenced our results. However, because of randomization,
these factors were evenly distributed across multivitamin
treatment arms, and there was no evidence of effect modifi-
cation by these factors at baseline.16 Moreover, because we
performed multiple tests across numerous dietary factors,
we cannot exclude the possibility that some statistically sig-
nificant effects were false-positive results.

Inconclusive Supplement Benefit,
but Undisputed Advantages of Healthy Foods
Linda Van Horn, PhD, RD
Few questions are more complicated for nutritionists and
health care professionals than “Should I take a vitamin-
mineral supplement?” Despite decades of evidence contrib-
uted by numerous well-conducted, carefully controlled stud-
iesamongdifferentage,sex,andracial/ethnicgroups,themost
accurate answer seems to be
“Maybe or maybe not.” Ac-
cording to the Office of Di-
etary Supplements,1 most
Americans, especially those 70 years and older, take at least 1
dietary supplement a day. For the past several years, Ameri-
cans have spent more than $30 billion each year to do so,1 but
data regarding overall benefit remain inconclusive. One of the
reasons for this gap pertains to sheer volume. There are more
than 75 000 dietary supplements now on the market.1 Be-
yond traditional vitamins and minerals, this total includes
herbs and botanicals, fish oils, probiotics, fiber, glucosamine,
flavanols, and countless other ingredients that may or may not
be accurately regulated. With all these options, it is increas-
inglydifficulttocometoanevidence-basedconclusiononben-
efit or at least achieve conviction that supplement use poses
no harm. Instead, the equally equivocal answer to this fol-
low-up question is “It depends.”
Recently, a large systematic review and meta-analysis in-
volving 49 primary prevention trials and 287 304 individuals
reported “insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary
supplementsintheprimarypreventionofcause-specificdeath,
incidence of cardiovascular disease, and incidence of
cancer.”2(p27) The same conclusion was reached earlier by the
US Preventive Services Task Force, citing the absence of suf-
ficient data to recommend or not the use of multivitamins for
prevention of cardiovascular disease.3
A major contributor to the growing database regarding
these questions is the Physicians’Health Study II,4 which in
2012 reported a lack of long-term benefit from multivitamin
intakeoranassociatedriskofcardiovasculardisease.Inastudy
published in this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Rautiainen et al5
sought to determine whether effect modification due to di-
etary quality of baseline intake, assessed using the Alternate
Healthy Eating Index and the Alternate Mediterranean Diet
Score, may have contributed to these results. The Alternate
Healthy Eating Index is calculated based on intake of 11 com-
ponents, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and
legumes, long-chain β-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid and
eicosapentaenoic acid), polyunsaturated fatty acids, moder-
ate alcohol intake, sugar-sweetened beverages, red and pro-
cessed meat, trans-fatty acids, and sodium, as derived from a
validated food frequency questionnaire.6 The Alternate Medi-
terranean Diet Score is based on 9 similar components but in-
cludes the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated
fatty acids and adds a point for fish intake above and red meat
intake below the median intake and alcohol intake between
10 to 15 g/d.5 Based on physician-adjudicated outcomes,
Rautiainen et al5 found no statistically significant evidence of
