Abstract
The heart exhibits the highest basal oxygen (O2) consumption per tissue mass of any
organ in the body and is uniquely dependent on aerobic metabolism to sustain contractile
function. During acute hypoxic states, the body responds with a compensatory increase in
cardiac output that further increases myocardial O2 demand, predisposing the heart to
ischemic stress and myocardial dysfunction. Here, we test the utility of a novel engineered
protein derived from the heme-based nitric oxide (NO)/oxygen (H-NOX) family of bacterial
proteins as an O2 delivery biotherapeutic (Omniox-cardiovascular [OMX-CV]) for the hyp-
oxic myocardium. Because of their unique binding characteristics, H-NOX–based variants
effectively deliver O2 to hypoxic tissues, but not those at physiologic O2 tension. Addition-
ally, H-NOX–based variants exhibit tunable binding that is specific for O2 with subphysiolo-
gic reactivity towards NO, circumventing a significant toxicity exhibited by hemoglobin
(Hb)-based O2 carriers (HBOCs). Juvenile lambs were sedated, mechanically ventilated,
and instrumented to measure cardiovascular parameters. Biventricular admittance cathe-
ters were inserted to perform pressure-volume (PV) analyses. Systemic hypoxia was
induced by ventilation with 10% O2. Following 15 minutes of hypoxia, the lambs were
treated with OMX-CV (200 mg/kg IV) or vehicle. Acute hypoxia induced significant
increases in heart rate (HR), pulmonary blood flow (PBF), and pulmonary vascular resis-
tance (PVR) (p < 0.05). At 1 hour, vehicle-treated lambs exhibited severe hypoxia and a
significant decrease in biventricular contractile function. However, in OMX-CV–treated
animals, myocardial oxygenation was improved without negatively impacting systemic or
PVR, and both right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) contractile function were main-
tained at pre-hypoxic baseline levels. These data suggest that OMX-CV is a promising

Author summary
While hemoglobin is the primary oxygen delivery molecule used to maintain tissue oxy-
genation in metazoans, many organisms have other heme-containing proteins that can
bind oxygen and other diatomic gases. Here, we tested whether a member of the H-NOX
family of heme-containing proteins found in the thermostable bacterium Thermoanaero-
bacter tengcongensis can be engineered to deliver oxygen to severely hypoxic tissues in
large mammals. This class of molecules has the advantage of high oxygen affinity and min-
imal nitric oxide reactivity. We demonstrate that these molecules can effectively deliver
oxygen to a lamb heart with induced severe hypoxia, without overexposing the animal to
oxygen or triggering systemic vascular reactivity. These molecules thus represent a novel
class of oxygen delivery biotherapeutics to specifically target hypoxic tissue beds without
the toxicity concerns of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. As tissue hypoxia is a central
feature of many disease processes, this therapeutic approach may have broad clinical
applicability.
Introduction
Inadequate oxygen (O2) delivery relative to metabolic demand leads to progressive bioener-
getic collapse and cellular dysfunction. When systemic, this defines the clinical entity of shock,
a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both adults and children [1,2,3,4]. Rather than a
specific disease state, shock is a shared pathologic end point arising from disorders such as
respiratory failure, hemorrhage, or sepsis that ultimately impair cardiovascular function. For
this reason, maintaining a balance between myocardial O2 supply and demand underlies a cen-
tral therapeutic framework of critical care medicine.
Of all organs, the heart is metabolically unique both in regard to its energetic demands as
well as its O2 utilization and extraction characteristics. Given its primary physiologic function
as a continuous generator of mechanical force, the heart requires an extraordinary supply of
biochemical energy and exhibits a far greater rate of ATP turnover than any other organ [5].
Furthermore, the heart is exquisitely dependent on aerobic metabolism to meet these high
bioenergetic needs, without the ability to derive any meaningful contribution from anaerobic
pathways such as glycolysis [6]. This is reflected in the large myocardial volume devoted to
mitochondria and the heart’s status as the highest O2 consumer per gram tissue mass of any
organ [5,6]. Importantly, its high O2 extraction ratio results in lower venous O2 contents than
other tissues, with a significant fraction of cardiomyocytes being exposed to physiologically
hypoxic environments at baseline [7,8]. When myocardial O2 supply becomes limited in the
face of increased demand, dramatic increases in coronary blood flow as well as cardiomyocyte
O2 extraction attempt to compensate [7,8,9]. When inadequate, biochemical signs of a switch
to anaerobic metabolism are accompanied by an immediate impairment of contractile func-
tion [10]. O2 consumption is thus vital to provide the biochemical energy required to maintain
cardiac mechanical function.
In this study, we describe, for the first time, the use of a novel O2 delivery biotherapeutic to
alleviate hypoxia-induced tissue dysfunction in the heart. Derived from the heme-based nitric

 increased risk of myocardial infarction and death [14,15,16], the protein component of
OMX-CV is uniquely tuned to bind molecular O2 in a way that reduces NO reactivity 50-fold
compared with Hb [13], alleviating the potential risk of vasoconstriction.
Additionally, relative to Hb, the protein component of OMX-CV binds to O2 with a very
high affinity, exhibiting a dissociation constant (KD) of about 2.4 μM [13]. Fig 1B shows a sche-
matic comparing the O2 affinities of wild-type Tt H-NOX and OMX-CV with that of Hb, and
illustrates how OMX-CV can effectively deliver O2 only to tissues that are significantly hypoxic
while bypassing those at physiologic O2 tensions. Following O2 delivery within the hypoxic
capillary environment, the unbound OMX-CV molecules enter the systemic venous and pul-
monary vascular beds. In this manner, OMX-CV circulates and can be predicted to sustain an
ongoing, targeted O2 delivery to the most hypoxic organs and tissues without unnecessary and
potentially harmful [18] oxygenation of tissues at physiologic O2 tensions.
We hypothesized that in the setting of severe myocardial hypoxia, OMX-CV administration
would increase O2 delivery to the heart and improve cardiac mechanical function. In order to
test this hypothesis, we utilized a juvenile lamb model of severe acute alveolar hypoxia. The
lamb is a robust large animal model that has been extensively utilized because of its close
approximation of human cardiovascular function [19]. Here, we present data regarding the
safety and efficacy of OMX-CV administration in the setting of systemic hypoxia supporting
the use of OMX-CV as a promising novel O2 delivery biotherapeutic.
Results
Acute alveolar hypoxia induces a dramatic physiologic response
Previous studies have described the acute cardiovascular response to progressive alveolar hyp-
oxia in large animal models [20,21]. Here, we established a model of acute alveolar hypoxia in
juvenile lambs triggered via inhalation of a gas mixture containing 10% O2 (Fig 2A). Physio-
logic data were compared at pre-hypoxic baseline and at 15 minutes of hypoxia (prior to
experimental intervention) for all animals included in the analysis (n = 13) As expected, we
witnessed a precipitous fall in arterial O2 tension (PaO2) with the onset of alveolar hypoxia
that was then sustained for the duration of the study (Fig 2B). Fig 2C–2F demonstrate the dra-
matic changes in physiologic parameters that accompany this severe hypoxemia at the 15-min-
ute time point. The animals all exhibit acute increases in heart rate (HR), systemic blood
pressure (systolic and mean), pulmonary blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), and
left and right atrial pressures. As expected [22], there is a significant increase in pulmonary
vascular resistance (PVR) attributable to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, there
is not a significant alteration in either systemic diastolic blood pressure or systemic vascular
resistance (SVR). Additionally, there is an overall increase in cardiac output of approximately
15% (Fig 2G). Although this just fails to reach statistical significance when evaluated at the
15-minute time point (p = .063), there is a significant increase in cardiac output amongst all
animals (but no between-group difference) when evaluated over the duration of the hypoxic
exposure (Fig 3). Table 1 provides additional cardiovascular physiologic parameters compar-
ing OMX-CV and vehicle groups at their respective hypoxic baselines (before drug) and study
conclusion (60 minutes).
OMX-CV administration does not cause systemic or pulmonary
vasoconstriction

the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), we evaluated the physiologic impact of

 OMX-CV administration on systemic and pulmonary vascular reactivity. Importantly, the
total amount of OMX-CV administered relative to circulating Hb is quite low. In an average
10-kg lamb with a serum Hb concentration of 10 g/dL and a circulating blood volume of 70
mL/kg, Hb O2 carrying capacity is approximately 4.8 mM. For these experiments, we provided
approximately 54 mL total of OMX-CV infusion, representing an infused OMX-CV O2-bind-
ing capacity of approximately 0.1 mM, or 2% that of circulating Hb. As noted in Table 1, this
does not result in appreciable differences in circulating PaO2 values but is readily available for
oxygenating severely hypoxic tissues. Given the substantial physiologic changes induced by the
hypoxic stimulus, we specifically evaluated effects on SVR and PVR in the setting of systemic
hypoxia prior to and immediately following drug or vehicle administration (n = 7 control and
n = 6 OMX-CV). As seen in Fig 4, we observed no significant increase in either the indexed
PVR (Fig 4A) or indexed SVR (Fig 4B) with administration of OMX-CV when compared with
vehicle control under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, there was no difference in the absolute
value or percent change between the OMX-CV–treated and vehicle-treated groups. While
hypoxia clearly results in a pre-constricted pulmonary vasculature, this occurs through a NO-
independent mechanism, and PVR would be expected to remain quite sensitive to abrupt
changes in NO signaling [23,24]. Additionally, SVR is also increased during hypoxia, as evi-
denced by increased mean systemic pressure, and was similarly unaffected by OMX-CV
administration (Fig 4B), affirming a lack of direct vasoreactivity.

 OMX-CV decreases myocardial hypoxia
To directly assess the effect of OMX-CV on myocardial tissue oxygenation, following the final
assessment of physiologic parameters, pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe, 85 mg/kg), a well-estab-
lished marker of tissue hypoxia [25], was administered intravenously to a subset of animals
(n = 3 per treatment group). Thirty minutes after administration of pimonidazole, the animals
were humanely killed and tissues collected for processing and measurement of pimonidazole
adduct levels in the ventricular myocardium. Pimonidazole freely diffuses into cells and is
competitively metabolized via oxidative or reductive chemical reactions, depending on the
tissue O2 content. In severely hypoxic environments (below 10 mm Hg), reductive metabolism
is favored and in its reduced state, pimonidazole forms covalent adducts with sulfhydryl
groups of proteins and glutathione, leading to accumulation of pimonidazole adducts
inside the cell [25]. Pimonidazole adducts can be recognized using pimonidazole-targeted
primary antibodies and quantified using standard ELISA and immunofluorescent (IF) meth-
ods. As seen in Fig 5A & 5B, the OMX-CV–treated animals exhibited a significant reduction
in myocardial hypoxia compared with controls, as evidenced by lower levels of bound

 pimonidazole observed via IF microscopy and quantified by ELISA. To verify that the
improved myocardial tissue oxygenation in the OMX-CV group was mediated by transcapil-
lary O2 diffusion, rather than vascular extravasation, IF microcopy was performed with anti-
bodies directed against OMX-CV. As seen in Fig 5C, OMX-CV localized within the capillary
vascular spaces throughout the heart and not the extracellular spaces surrounding the cardio-
myocytes. Thus, at tested doses, a high-affinity O2 delivery biotherapeutic can relieve tissue
hypoxia in the heart.
OMX-CV preserves myocardial contractility during systemic hypoxia
To determine whether this improvement in myocardial O2 delivery translates into a physio-
logic benefit, we utilized cardiac pressure volume loop analysis to evaluate contractile function
of the bilateral ventricles. As noted previously by other groups, evaluation of cardiac function
in intact animal studies is often obscured by compensatory physiologic alterations to ventricu-
lar loading conditions and sympathetic tone [10,21]. Indeed, we observed in our own data that
from the onset of hypoxia, both the OMX-CV and control groups exhibited similar elevations
in cardiac output (about 15%) above the normoxic baseline, and that this was sustained
throughout our study (Fig 3). This suggests a full mobilization of compensatory mechanisms
that may account for the lack of a significant difference in cardiac output between the
OMX-CV and control groups at early time points. Initially advanced by Suga and Sagawa in
the 1970s [26], evaluation of two-dimensional ventricular pressure-volume (PV) loops with a
focus on the end systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) is now the widely adopted
standard used to assess the load-independent contractile state of the ventricles [27]. This
method has previously been used to validate the hypoxic depression of myocardial contractile
function in dogs and shown to correlate closely with myocardial O2 deficiency and the onset of
anaerobic metabolism [8,10].

 In order to delineate the ESPVR, a family of loops was generated (as seen in Fig 6A & 6B)
through transient preload suppression induced by graduated occlusion of the inferior vena
cava (IVC). The slope of the tangent connecting the end systolic points of these loops gives
the most precise representation of intrinsic contractility of the ventricle. As seen in Fig 6A,
which shows a representative set of loops and their ESPVR from the LV of a control animal,
the decline in slope from baseline (black) to hypoxia (green) demonstrates a decrease in
contractility. In contrast, the LV loops of an OMX-CV–treated animal (Fig 6B) exhibit an
increasing slope, indicating an improvement in contractile function. By normalizing the
slope of the ESPVR at 60 minutes to the baseline for each animal (n = 7 control and n = 6
OMX-CV), we observed that OMX-CV–treated animals maintained an average contractility
up to 2-fold above their own baseline under hypoxic conditions (Fig 6C), while RV (Fig 6C)
and LV (Fig 6D) contractility were both reduced in vehicle controls. These data indicate that
OMX-CV treatment was able to reverse the effects of myocardial hypoxia and preserve car-
diac contractility.
We finally explored the role of sympathetic activation in the cardiovascular response to
acute alveolar hypoxia by measuring plasma levels of the sympathetic hormones epinephrine
and norepinephrine at baseline and after 60 minutes of hypoxia. Released by the adrenal
medulla in response to increased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, these hor-
mones exhibit potent cardiovascular effects mediated through binding of alpha- and beta-
adrenergic receptors in the heart and vasculature. Similar to what has been described [21], we

 noted a significant increase in the levels of these catecholamines under hypoxic stress, marking
an activated sympathetic response. Interestingly, we found a significant difference in the levels
of epinephrine and norepinephrine between the OMX-CV– and vehicle-treated animals (n = 7
control and n = 6 OMX-CV), with hypoxia inducing an approximately 3-fold higher increase
in both hormones in the vehicle group compared with OMX-CV (Fig 6E and 6F). Thus,
increased adrenergic signaling was not responsible for the improved myocardial contractility
of OMX-CV–treated animals compared with the control group, although the improved perfor-
mance in the presence of the lower induction of catecholamines suggests a greater capacity of
the OMX-CV–treated myocardium to respond to adrenergic signaling under hypoxic stress.
We therefore conclude that while cardiac output can be maintained during severe acute alveo-
lar hypoxia through diverse adaptive mechanisms, OMX-CV directly improves the intrinsic
contractile function of the heart by virtue of its ability to increase myocardial O2 content.
Discussion
Here, we have provided preclinical data highlighting the therapeutic efficacy of the OMX-CV
biotherapeutic in relieving hypoxic myocardial dysfunction in a large animal model. H-NOX–
based variants are ideally suited for O2 delivery to hypoxic tissues, such as the myocardium,
because of their O2 affinity as well as pharmacokinetic and safety profiles [13]. OMX-CV’s O2
affinity aligns extremely well with the unique O2 demands and microenvironments encoun-
tered within the stressed heart, its half-life enables long-term efficacy following single intrave-
nous infusion, and its O2 specificity minimizes the vasoactive side effects encountered with
HBOCs.
The cardiovascular system responds to acute hypoxia by attempting to augment and
enhance systemic O2 delivery. Cardiac output increases with accompanying elevations in both
HR and contractile state, which further escalate myocardial O2 demand. In response to the
high and variable demand for O2 during states of acute stress, as well as the tight interrelation-
ship between myocardial function and O2 supply, the heart has evolved robust adaptive mech-
anisms to augment myocardial O2 delivery and extraction [28]. For example, during exercise-
induced elevations in cardiac output, O2 utilization may increase by greater than 5-fold, sup-
ported by substantial increases in coronary blood flow, capillary recruitment, and increased
O2 extraction [7]. Even under unstressed conditions, the heart exhibits a high O2 extraction
ratio with a correspondingly low venous saturation. When demand increases, the heart has a
unique capacity to increase extraction to a greater extent than other tissues [8].
Cain and colleagues initially demonstrated that global hypoxic hypoxia and anemic hypoxia
induced global anaerobic metabolism at greatly differing values of mixed venous partial pres-
sure of oxygen (PO2) [9]. These differences in tissue responses to the same level of hypoxia in
the blood implied that simple diffusion forces are not the limiting factor to tissue O2 extrac-
tion, and Schumacker and colleagues subsequently confirmed that a constant critical O2
extraction ratio exists in dogs [29]. Although the exact mechanisms underlying these differ-
ences are unclear, the physiologic consequence is that most tissues will start to experience O2
deficiency despite a relatively high average O2 saturation of the blood exiting their capillaries.
In contrast to the other tissues and organs, the myocardium can achieve a substantially higher
O2 extraction ratio, only exhibiting signs of anaerobic metabolism at a critically low coronary
norepinephrine levels (expressed as fold change relative to physiologic baseline) at 1 hour of hypoxic ventilation in vehicle- and OMX-CV–
treated animals. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean; “�” denotes a significant difference between groups with p < 0.05.

 venous saturation [8]. This markedly hypoxic venous and end capillary blood reflects a corre-
spondingly hypoxic tissue bed, creating the ideal cellular microenvironment to facilitate O2
dissociation and delivery by OMX-CV. Consistent with this prediction, we have shown here
that in the stressed, hypoxic lamb heart, myocardial oxygenation and contractile function can
be preserved with the administration of OMX-CV. This is particularly remarkable given that
the total amount of OMX-CV used in our studies equates to only approximately 2% of the
total O2 carrying capacity of the circulating Hb. Importantly, the small amount of OMX-CV
administered relative to total circulating Hb serves to limit any potential negative impact on
total O2 bioavailability.
Furthermore, the high O2 affinity of OMX-CV precludes O2 delivery under non-hypoxic
conditions. This is in marked contrast to the less avid delivery profile of Hb and most HBOCs,
which have been shown to contribute to pathologic hyperoxygenation of tissue and circulatory
microenvironments [30]. This excessive O2 release has been shown to cause oxidative stress to
the tissues through the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to induce detri-
mental microvascular shunting mechanisms that may inappropriately impair tissue perfusion.
Delivery of excess O2 in the setting of shock is a frequent contributor to microcirculatory shunt-
ing with significant clinical consequences [31]. While vascular indices can frequently be nor-
malized within the macrocirculation in the setting of shock, tissue perfusion can nevertheless
be compromised because of shunting at the microcirculatory level. Importantly, in adult
patients with severe sepsis and traumatic hemorrhagic shock, for example, the loss of coherence
between the resuscitated macrocirculation and the microcirculation is one of the most sensitive
and specific hemodynamic indicators associated with increased multi-organ failure and mortal-
ity [32,33,34,35]. Similarly, in critically ill children with sepsis, a persistently altered microcircu-
lation has been associated with increased mortality [36]. OMX-CV allows a more targeted
delivery of O2 to only the most hypoxic tissue beds and may help alleviate the underappreciated
but significant morbidities associated with excessive tissue oxygenation in this setting.
Interestingly, we noted in our study that OMX-CV administration was associated with a
smaller increase in circulating catecholamine levels in the setting of systemic hypoxia. While it
is unclear what exactly underlies this difference in catecholamine production and release, it
does suggest potential implications related to cardiac function. Hypoxia is a well-established
stimulus for catecholamine secretion both in vitro and in vivo [37,38,39], and adrenergic
responses to hypoxic stress are important for the maintenance of cardiorespiratory homeosta-
sis [40,41]. In the perinatal period, catecholamine production by adrenomedullary chromaffin
cells is directly stimulated by cellular hypoxia [42,43]. However, as mammals age, this primary
cellular response to O2 is blunted and cholinergic innervation becomes the predominant regu-
latory mechanism [44]. The sympathetic response to hypoxia therefore matures to reflect the
integrated input from peripheral and central chemoreceptors. In our juvenile lamb model of
systemic hypoxia, OMX-CV administration appears to blunt hypoxia-driven catecholamine
production. It is not clear if this reflects augmented O2 delivery to chemoreceptors or the chro-
maffin cells themselves, or perhaps represents some secondary mechanism related to more
favorable hemodynamics associated with improved myocardial oxygenation. Importantly, in
the control animals, diminished cardiac contractility is observed despite dramatically elevated
levels of circulating catecholamines, while the OMX-CV–treated animals exhibit preserved
contractility despite smaller increases in catecholamine levels. Epinephrine and norepineph-
rine are potent inotropes, vital to the regulation of cardiac contractility and hemodynamic
function in response to physiologic stress. Here, we show that OMX-CV supports preservation
of the cardiac response to these key regulators, which are important not only as endogenous
hormones but also as exogenous agents heavily utilized for cardiovascular support in critical
care medicine.

 With respect to its safety profile, OMX-CV exhibits significant advantages over previously
developed HBOCs [45]. As the protein responsible for storage and transport of O2 in red
blood cells (RBCs) [46], Hb has been the precursor for the synthesis and formulation of
HBOCs previously developed as RBC substitutes [47,48,49,50]. The first HBOC to be devel-
oped in this capacity consisted of partially purified “stroma-free” Hb [51]. However, transfu-
sion of acellular Hb led to several major side effects [52,53,54,55,56]. Extracellular tetrameric
Hb readily dissociates into two pairs of dimers [53,54], which are extremely prone to oxidation
[56] and enhanced renal excretion [53,57]. Hb oxidation to methemoglobin (metHb) pro-
motes unfolding of the globin chains and releases cytotoxic heme into the circulation, leading
to kidney tubule damage and eventual renal failure [53,54]. Furthermore, metHb can no lon-
ger carry O2 and can also contribute to the generation of harmful ROS [52,55]. Additionally,
extracellular Hb can trigger vasoconstriction and systemic hypertension by various mecha-
nisms [30,58,59]. Foremost amongst these is the indiscriminate scavenging of NO, an impor-
tant intrinsic vasodilator that is locally produced by endothelial cells to relax vascular smooth
muscle [58,60]. Also, potentially important is the hyperoxygenation of local vasculature that
can elicit inappropriate vasoconstriction within the microcirculation, compared to more tem-
pered O2 delivery into the vessel lumen from physiologic RBC-encapsulated Hb [30,45]. Over-
all, the presence of extracellular Hb in the circulation may lead to direct tissue toxicity via
heme release and ROS generation, while simultaneously impairing blood flow because of path-
ologic alterations in vasomotor tone. With its unique structure and O2-binding characteristics,
OMX-CV averts the potential for many of these deleterious side effects. In this study, we have
shown a lack of direct vasoreactivity in both the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds, pro-
viding strong evidence for selective O2 delivery in severely hypoxic microenvironments and
lack of vasoactivity.
In summary, we present preclinical data from a large animal model highlighting the thera-
peutic efficacy of a novel O2 delivery biotherapeutic agent, OMX-CV, in relieving hypoxic
myocardial dysfunction. OMX-CV is ideally suited for myocardial O2 delivery because of its
unique O2-binding characteristics and safety profile. Its high O2 affinity complements the
unique O2 demands and microenvironments encountered within the stressed heart, while its
low reactivity with NO minimizes the vasoactive side effects encountered with HBOCs. Addi-
tionally, while exogenous O2 administration can increase systemic arterial O2 content, it can
also result in microvascular shunting mechanisms that limit deep tissue oxygenation [61,62].
OMX-CV therefore has the potential to improve oxygenation in a wide range of tissues and
clinical scenarios in which O2 delivery may be compromised.

Surgeries
In this study, 13 juvenile lambs (4–6 weeks of age) were anesthetized with fentanyl, ketamine,
and diazepam and paralyzed with vecuronium to facilitate intubation and mechanical ventila-
tion. Ongoing sedation and neuromuscular blockade were administered as a continuous infu-
sion of ketamine, fentanyl, diazepam, and vecuronium. The sedative mixture was titrated to
maintain age-appropriate HR. Femoral venous and arterial access were obtained via cutdown
of the hind limbs, and arterial pressure was continuously transduced and recorded. The ani-
mals were ventilated with 21% FiO2 initially, with a positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm

 H2O, tidal volumes of 10 mL/kg, and respiratory rate titrated to maintain pCO2 of 35–45 milli-
meters mercury (mmHg) by arterial blood gas measurements. Thoracotomy was performed
and Sorenson Neonatal Transducers (Abbott Critical Care Systems, N. Chicago, IL) were
introduced into the left and right atria and main pulmonary artery (MPA) to continually trans-
duce and record pressures. An ultrasonic flow probe (Transonics Sytems, Ithaca, NY) was
placed on the left pulmonary artery (LPA) to continuously monitor and record blood flow.
Admittance PV catheters (Transonics Systems, Ithaca, NY) were introduced into the RV and
LV via ventriculostomy to perform ventricular pressure volume analysis. These catheters con-
sist of a solid-state sensor that directly measures pressure with high precision and excitation
and recording electrodes that measure volume based on electrical admittance. Alternating cur-
rent applied to the excitation electrodes generates an electrical field within the ventricle and
the recording electrodes measure voltage changes, allowing calculation of resistance and con-
ductance. With input of a measured blood resistivity and baseline stroke volume (as assessed
by total cardiac output estimate from LPA flow/HR), time varying conductance can be used to
solve for ventricular blood volume in real time [63]. Animals with Hb levels of less than 7.5 g/
dL following surgical instrumentation were transfused with fresh whole maternal blood in
increments of 5 mL/kg to achieve this minimum threshold.
Following instrumentation, the animals were allowed to recover to steady state until they
required no further adjustment to sedatives and exhibited stable hemodynamic parameters.
This time was designated as the normoxic baseline and blood gas analysis was performed.
Baseline ventricular ESPVR was assessed by transient IVC occlusion. Following baseline
assessment, the animals were subjected to sustained alveolar hypoxia by ventilation with an
admixture of atmospheric gas and nitrogen to achieve a FiO2 of 10%. Arterial blood gas analy-
sis was performed every 15 minutes with blood withdrawn from the femoral artery and ana-
lyzed using a Radiometer ABL5 pH/blood gas analyzer (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Ventilatory rate was adjusted to maintain PCO2 35–45 mmHg and metabolic acidosis was cor-
rected with NaHCO3 boluses to maintain pH >7.30.
Animal care and use
All protocols and procedures for this work were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco. Animals’ vital signs, includ-
ing core temperature, were monitored throughout the study, and they were given intravenous
fluids and prophylactic antibiotics per protocol. At the end of each protocol, all lambs were
euthanized with a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital followed by bilateral thoracotomy,
as described in the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
OMX-CV production
The engineered Tt H-NOX protein described in this study was produced by QuikChange Site-
Directed Mutagenesis (Agilent), subcloned into an expression plasmid, transformed into
Escherichia coli, and expressed essentially as described [11]. Cells were harvested by hollow-
fiber tangential-flow filtration and processed immediately. The His-tagged Tt H-NOX protein
was purified from cell lysate using Ni-affinity chromatography and further polished by passage
over an anion-exchange column to remove remaining host cell DNA, host cell proteins, and
endotoxins. The purified protein was formulated to produce OMX-CV, and frozen at −80 ˚C
until use. Protein concentrations were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry as
described [11]. Prior to use in animal studies, OMX-CV was subjected to purity testing by
SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and SEC-HPLC (Agilent) and safety testing by kinetic chromogenic

 LAL test for endotoxin (Charles River Laboratories). For use in animal studies, proteins lots
were required to be greater than 95% pure and have endotoxin levels less than 0.1 EU/mg.
OMX-CV administration
After 15 minutes of alveolar hypoxia, the animals received either 200 mg/kg of OMX-CV
(about 4 mL/kg by volume) as a bolus over 10 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 70
mg/kg/hour (OMX-CV group n = 6), or an equivalent volume of the OMX-CV vehicle solu-
tion administered in the same manner (control group n = 7). At 60 minutes of alveolar hyp-
oxia, repeat evaluation of the ESPVR was assessed by IVC occlusion.
Physiologic monitoring
Physiologic data were continuously recorded and analyzed using the Ponemah Physiology
Platform (Data Sciences International, New Brighton, MN) with Acquisition Interface, ACQ-
7700 (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN). For calculation of total cardiac output, LPA
blood flow was assumed to represent 45% of total output, as previously established in juvenile
lambs by Rudolph. This was indexed to animal size by dividing by the animal’s body weight in
kilograms. PVR was calculated as the difference of mean pulmonary arterial pressure and left
atrial pressure divided by the indexed cardiac output. SVR was calculated as the difference
of mean systemic arterial pressure and right atrial pressure divided by the indexed cardiac out-
put. Pressure volume loop recording and analysis were performed using Labscribe software
(iWorx, Dover, NH).
Epinephrine and norepinephrine ELISA
At baseline and again at 60 minutes of hypoxia, plasma and serum samples were collected
from all animals (n = 7 control and n = 6 OMX-CV) for additional analysis, including mea-
surement of circulating catecholamines. Determination of epinephrine and norepinephrine
levels in plasma was performed using a colorimetric ELISA kit (ABNOVA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Pimonidazole ELISA
In a subset of animals (n = 3 control and n = 3 OMX-CV), following the final physiologic
assessment, pimonidazole (85 mg/kg) was administered intravenously over 10–15 minutes, as
tolerated. Thirty minutes following the pimonidazole infusion, the animals were euthanized
for tissue collection. Myocardial tissues were snap-frozen and proteins were then extracted
and processed for competitive pimonidazole ELISA, as described [64]. Standard curves for the
pimonidazole ELISA were fit using a five-parameter logistic equation and used to determine
IC50 values. Values were normalized to the protein concentration in each sample and then
expressed relative to the vehicle control.
Immunohistochemistry of pimonidazole and OMX-CV
Myocardial tissues were frozen in OCT and processed for cryosectioning, followed by immu-
nohistochemical analysis. Sections were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 minutes at −20 ˚C,
then blocked and permeabilized with 5% BSA, 5% goat serum, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1–2
hours at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with anti-pimonidazole (Hypoxyp-
robe, 1:100), anti-OMX-CV (1:200, Mouse monoclonal) antibodies overnight at 4 ˚C, followed
by anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1,000, Jackson Immunoresearch Labora-
tories, West Grove, PA) for 2 hours at room temperature. The sections were mounted in

an HD AxioImager Zeiss microscope equipped with a CCD digital camera.
Statistical analysis
Comparison of physiologic data comparing pre-hypoxic baseline to the first hypoxic physio-
logic time point was performed using a paired Student t test. Evaluation of cardiac output over
the duration of the study between groups was performed using two-way ANOVA analysis.
Evaluation of PVR and SVR before and after treatment between groups was performed using
two-way ANOVA analysis. Pimonidazole levels were compared between groups using an
unpaired Student t test. For ESPVR data, the slope of the ESPVR at 60 minutes of hypoxia for
each ventricle of each animal was normalized to its own baseline ESPVR. These normalized
values were then compared between groups using an unpaired Student t test. Epinephrine
and norepinephrine levels at 60 minutes of hypoxia were compared between groups using
unpaired Student t test. For all statistical tests performed, p � 0.05 was considered to be signifi-
cant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.04 for Macintosh, Graph-
Pad Software, La Jolla, CA.
