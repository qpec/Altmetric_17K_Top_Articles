Pediatric tuberculosis detection using trained African giant
pouched rats
Georgies F Mgode1, Christophe L Cox2, Stephen Mwimanzi2 and Christiaan Mulder2
BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in children is a
challenge with up to 94% of children with TB treated
empirically in TB high-burden countries. Therefore, new
diagnostic tests are needed for TB diagnosis. We determined
the performance of trained rats in the diagnosis of pediatric TB
and whether they can improve detection rate compared to
the standard of care.
METHODS: Presumptive TB patients in 24 TB clinics in
Tanzania were tested. Samples indicated as TB-positive by rats
underwent confirmation by concentrated smear microscopy.
TB yield of bacteriologically confirmed pediatric TB patients
(≤5 years) was compared with yield of standard of care.
RESULTS: Sputum samples from 55,148 presumptive TB
patients were tested. Nine hundred eighty-two (1.8%) were
the children between 1 and 5 years. Clinics detected 34
bacteriologically positive children, whereas rats detected
additional 23
children
yielding
57 bacteriologically TB-
positive children. Rats increased pediatric TB detection by
67.6%. Among 1–14-year-old children, clinics detected 331
bacteriologically positive TB whereas rats found the additional
208 children with TB that were missed by clinics. Relative
increase in TB case detection by rats decreased with the
increase in age (Po0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Trained rats increase pediatric TB detection
significantly and could help address the pediatric TB diagnosis
challenges. Further determination of accuracy of rats involving
other sample types is still needed.
T
uberculosis (TB) is a deadly disease, which killed 1.3
million people worldwide in 2016, of whom 130,000 were
children (1). Sub Saharan Africa and South East Asia are
among the regions with the highest burden of TB (2). A large
proportion of TB patients remain undetected in most high-
burden areas due to the poor sensitivity of smear microscopy
widely used in these areas. In many low-income countries, the
diagnosis of pediatric TB is solely based on clinical evidence
and smear microscopy (3,4). Pediatric TB is difficult to
diagnose due to paucibacillary that complicates mycobacter-
iological confirmation by smear microscopy and culture
which yields o15% and between 30 and 40% sensitivities,
respectively. The sensitivity of adult sputum culture is 80%
(4). In addition, for children it is challenging to produce a
sufficient volume of good-quality sputum needed for smear
microscopy. As a result, many children with TB are not
bacteriologically confirmed or not even diagnosed, which has
major implications for their treatment success rate (5). In
northern Tanzania it was found that pediatric TB contributed
to 13% of the total TB burden and 75% of these had
pulmonary TB, of which only 5.8% of all TB patients were
bacteriologically confirmed (5). Nearly all of the children with
TB were thus treated empirically (5).
There is a need for new diagnostic tests to enhance TB
detection in children especially in low and middle-income
countries. Trained TB detection rats have been in use in
Tanzania and Mozambique as an enhanced case-finding tool
under research, after smear microscopy, whereby they have
increased TB case detection by over 40% (6,7). In recent years
the percent increase in TB detection due to the trained rats
has slightly dropped from 40 to 35–37% annually, probably
reflecting the improved quality of smear microscopy in the
collaborating DOTS centers. The current study on pediatric
TB diagnosis by trained rats is unique as is specifically
focusing on TB in children, whereas previous reports (6,7)
focused on adult TB.
Detection rats target a specific combination of volatile
organic compounds produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(8). They distinguish M. tuberculosis cultures from cultures of
other microorganisms, and can also distinguish clinical
sputum containing M. tuberculosis from the sputum contain-
ing other pathogens (9–11). The objectives of this study were
to determine the ability of trained rats to detect pediatric TB,
and whether rats could enhance the detection of pediatric TB
over standard of care.
Methods
Setting
The study was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Coast region, and
Morogoro, Tanzania from January 2011 to June 2015. Over 90% of
the participants were from Dar es Salaam city with a population of
nearly 5 million people (12).

 Study Population and Sampling
Presumptive TB patients who presented themselves in 24 directly
observed treatments, short-course (DOTS) clinics in Dar es Salaam,
Coast, and Morogoro region, Tanzania, were prospectively sampled
for this study between 2011 and 2015. Sample collectors reaching
collaborating DOTS centers across the city by using motorbikes
collected all sputum samples daily and securely transported to the
central TB detection rats’ laboratory for evaluation. The rationale for
this sampling was to determine the ability of rats to detect pediatric TB
within a programmatic setting. During this period the non-profit
organization partnered with Sokoine University of Agriculture known
as Anti-Persoonsmijnen Ontmijnende Product Ontwikkeling or “Anti-
Personnel Landmines Detection Product Development” in English
(APOPO) started working with a civil society organization in tracing
back the additional patients found by rats to start the treatment.
Presumptive TB patients were informed that their sputum samples
would also be tested for TB by rats following the testing by microscopy
in DOTS centers, whereby sputum smears are stained by Ziehl Neelsen
(ZN) or auramine stain and are examined under bright field and
fluorescent microscopy (FM), respectively. From January 2011 to June
2015, a total of 4,793 TB patients missed by DOTS centers were
detected by rats and confirmed by concentrated smear microscopy
(approved ZN or FM), whereby 2,289 were called back and started the
treatment under the National tuberculosis and Leprosy Program.
Patient tracking improved from 0.3% (1/386) found in 2011 to 56%
(1020/1807) in 2013 and to 70% (444/633) found from January to June
2015, a period for current study. A steady increase in patients starting
treatment after being diagnosed by TB detection rats and confirmation
by microscopy continued being realized from 2015 onward and is
attributed to the strengthened patient tracking and increasing
acceptance of the research in use intervention. A nucleic acid
amplification test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA and
resistance to rifampicin (RIF) known as Xpert MTB/RIF was also
available at some clinics for testing single specimens hence samples
from those participants were not available for rat evaluation except
when such children provided another sample. The bacteriological
confirmation was thus through smear microscopy that according to
the World Health Organization (13) defines a bacteriologically
confirmed TB case as an individual from whom a biological specimen
is positive by smear microscopy, culture or Xpert MTB/RIF (13).
TB Testing by Rats
Sputum samples already examined for TB through smear microscopy
in the clinics were securely transported to APOPO’s TB laboratory at
Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, for rat evaluation.
Detailed rat training and rat evaluation procedures have been
previously described (14). In brief, samples were first heat inactivated
at 100 oC for 30 min to kill microorganisms and render them safe for
subsequent handling and evaluations. Samples were randomly
arranged in containment bars and presented to trained rats. Animals
were rewarded upon correct identification of known TB-positive
control sputum samples. All other rat-indicated samples were pre-
concentrated by adding 4% sodium hydroxide and centrifuging to
obtain sediment for concentrated smear microscopy that is more
sensitive than direct smear (15). Results of TB patients found by rats
and confirmed by light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy
(LED-FM) (16) were submitted to the respective DOTS center and
also to the healthcare workers for tracking the respective patients to
start TB treatment. Contact details including telephone numbers of
presumptive TB patients were collected by community healthcare
workers working with a civil society organization called “Mapam-
bano ya Ukimwi na Kifua Kikuu Temeke” (MUKIKUTE) for
subsequent tracking of the additional TB patients detected by rats
missed in hospitals.
Use of Animals
The use of the African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei,
formally C. gambianus) was approved by the Sokoine University of
Agriculture, and we obtained Animal Welfare Assurance from the
Department of Health and Human Service, National Institute of
Health (NIH). Animals were treated humanely and received good
care, including shelter, food, water, veterinary care, wooden toys, and
a running wheel for physical exercise.
Data Analysis
We compared the TB yield by rats vs. smear microscopy (standard
care) in children, adolescents, and adults. To compare the TB
detection rate in children vs. the adolescents and adults, data were
stratified by age group: children from 1 up to 5 years old; children 6–
10 years old; adolescents 11–18 years old; and adults above 18 years of
age. The detection rate was also evaluated in the total pediatric group
consisting of children of 1–14 years old. The differences in proportions
of case detection between the age groups were assessed by Pearson χ2.
Associations were considered statistically significant when P-values
were ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using MedCalc
(17,18).
Ethical Considerations
The Medical Research Coordinating Committee of the National
Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) granted permit for TB
screening in humans using trained rats (Permit no. NIMR/HQ/R.8c/
Vol.II/495). Up to 70% of the additional TB patients detected by rats
and confirmed by concentrated smear microscopy were traced back
and received TB treatment in the respective health centers under the
National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program. The ethical committee
waived the need for informed consent for this operational research
study undertaking second-line TB testing after DOTS centers routine
TB diagnostic care.
RESULTS
A total of 55,148 presumptive TB patients were tested, out of
which 982 (1.8%) were children aged 1–5 years with sex ratio
(male:female 1:1). There were 2,121 (3.8%) 6–10-year-old
children (sex ratio 1:0.9), whereas 4,960 (9.0%) participants
were 11–18-year old (sex ratio 1:1). Participants older than 18
years were 47,085 (85.4%, sex ratio 1:0.7) (Table 1). DOTS
centers detected 34 bacteriologically confirmed patients aged
1–5 years, whereas detection rats detected additional 23
bacteriologically confirmed TB-positive children (13), yielding

 a total of 57 bacteriologically confirmed children in this age
group. Rats therefore increased pediatric TB case detection by
67.6% (23/34 children with TB). DOTS centers detected 94
children aged 6–10 years, and rats detected an additional 35
patients, yielding 129 bacteriologically confirmed patients and
increasing case detection in this age group by 37.2%. In
adolescents, DOTS centers detected 775 patients, and rats
detected additional 177 patients, yielding a total of 952
bacteriologically confirmed patients. Rats increased case
detection of adolescents by 22.8% (177/775 patients). For a
typical pediatric group (1–14 years) with a sex ratio of 1:0.997
(male:female), DOTS centers detected 331, and rats found
additional 208 TB-positive children increasing case detection
by 62.8%. In adults, DOTS centers detected 7,448, and rats
found additional 2,510 patients increasing case detection by
33.7% (Table 1). The increase in pediatric TB case detection
rate (67.6%) was statistically significantly higher than the
increase found in age groups older than 5 years (Po0.0001,
95% CI 26.1–33.4, χ2 = 239.44, and DF = 1).
The TB yield by detection rats was higher in children and
decreased with increase in age, whereby it reached a plateau in
adulthood. The highest increase in case detection through
detection rats was found in children under the age of 5
(Figure 1).
Bacterial Levels and Detection Rates
The quantity of TB bacilli in sputum (smear grade) was low
(scanty) at a younger age where rats found more additional
TB patients than in adults with a large number of bacteria in
sputum samples (1+, 2+, and 3+), which were highly detected
by TB clinics (Table 2).
The number of bacteria in sputum samples determined by
smear grading was lower in children and increased with the
increase in age (Table 2). The additional TB yield by rats was
higher in sputum with scanty bacilli than in sputum with
more bacilli (1+, 2+, and 3+) (Figure 2).
Over the 5-year period, the detection rats detected more TB
patients in children aged 1–5 years, yielding a prevalence of
5.8% compared with 3.5% by TB clinics (Figure 3). This
difference in TB yield by rats and TB clinics was statistically
significant (P = 0.0155, χ2 = 5.855, and DF = 1).

 children aged 1–14 years than in adults, indicating that
trained rats can help address the difficulties of detecting
pediatric TB associated with sputum quality and bacilli load
that can be below the detection limits of conventional smear
microscopy. The observation that rats produced higher
additional yield in samples with scanty bacilli than in samples
with more bacilli suggests that despite quality and quantity,
sputum from children with TB contains an adequate amount
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific volatile-odor com-
pounds (8–10), enabling rat detection.
Although the proportion of smear-positive TB was higher
among adults than in children, the percentage of additional TB
case detection by rats dropped from 67.6 to 33.7% in adults.
This suggests improved sample quality and quantity in adults
and higher bacterial load, which improved smear-microscopy
results. Nevertheless, still more than a quarter of the adults with
smear-positive TB were missed by the DOTS clinics. Previous
studies have shown that the TB case detection rate increases by
over 40% in the general population when trained rats are used
as an enhanced case-finding tool (6,7). In the present study,
rats increased case detection by 33.7% in adults that is slightly
lower than 40% reported previously. The higher proportion of
case detection (67%) in children suggests that TB yield by rats
is a function of the study-population age group in which
conventional microscopy do not perform well.
This research intervention involving TB testing by trained
rats and community-based patient tracking of new TB
patients missed by hospitals enables treatment initiation up
to 70% that is a significant proportion, given that these
additional patients were considered TB negative in hospitals,
and hence majority were initially left untreated.
The limitation of this study includes the absence of Xpert
MTB/RIF or culture as a reference standard for comparing the
yield of DOTS microscopy and detection rats technology. These
need to be considered in further investigation on the potential of
detection rats in enhancing TB diagnosis in children.
In conclusion, the detection rats show high potential for
enhanced case finding among pediatric presumptive TB
patients. This could be a major step forward in TB control.
Further investigation is needed with more sensitive diagnostic
tools to determine the actual ability and limitations of detection
rats in the diagnosis of pediatric TB. Such studies should also
consider investigating the ability of trained rats to detect TB in
other samples than sputum, such as urine, gastric lavage, and
nasopharyngeal aspiration. Urine could provide noninvasive
sampling, whereas gastric and nasopharyngeal aspiration is
widely used when children cannot produce sputum samples.
