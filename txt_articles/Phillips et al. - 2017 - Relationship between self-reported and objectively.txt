Abstract
Purpose—Many breast cancer survivors report cancer and cancer treatment-associated cognitive 
change. However, very little is known about the relationship between physical activity and 
subjective memory impairment (SMI) in this population. The purpose of this study is to examine 
the relationship between physical activity and SMI and longitudinally test a model examining the 
role of self-efficacy, fatigue and distress as potential mediators.
Methods—Post-treatment breast cancer survivors (N=1477) completed measures of physical 
activity, self-efficacy, distress (depression, concerns about recurrence, perceived stress, anxiety), 
fatigue and SMI at baseline and 6-month follow-up. A subsample (n= 362) was randomly selected 
to wear an accelerometer. It was hypothesized that physical activity indirectly influences SMI via 
exercise self-efficacy, distress and fatigue. Relationships were examined using panel analysis 
within a covariance modeling framework.
Results—The hypothesized model provided a good fit in the full sample (χ2= 1462.5, df = 469, 
p = < 0.001; CFI= 0.96; SRMR= 0.04) and the accelerometer subsample (χ2 = 961.8, df = 535, p 
= <0.001, CFI = 0.94, SRMR= 0.05) indicating increased physical activity is indirectly associated 
with reduction in SMI across time, via increased exercise self-efficacy and reduced distress and 
fatigue.
Conclusions—Higher levels of physical activity, lower levels of fatigue and distress and higher 
exercise self-efficacy may play an important role in understanding SMI in breast cancer survivors 
across time. Future research is warranted to replicate and explore these relationships further.

 BACKGROUND
Increasing evidence indicates that breast cancer survivors may report higher levels of 
subjective cognitive impairment than healthy age-matched controls [1, 2] and that these 
discrepancies may persist after treatment cessation [3]. Subjective memory impairment 
(SMI) is one of the most commonly reported cognitive problems with wide variation in 
estimates of its prevalence ranging from 14% to 95%, depending on measurement method 
used [4]. SMI refers to perceived memory difficulties experienced in daily life and 
satisfaction with memory functioning [4, 5]. Higher levels of subjective cognitive 
impairment have been independently associated with increased difficulties with activities of 
daily living, working life, and quality of life in breast cancer survivors [6]. Despite the high 
frequency of SMI, the data examining SMI in relation to objective neuropsychological 
assessments of memory impairment and neuroimaging is mixed with some studies observing 
no associations and others observing associations [4, 5]. However, SMI has been strongly 
and consistently associated with depression, anxiety and fatigue [5]. Thus, it has been 
suggested that SMI and other forms of subjective cognitive impairment may be indicative of 
emotional distress [4]. Because the number of longer-term breast cancer survivors continues 
to increase and such a large proportion of these women report SMI, it is important to explore 
potential modifiable psychological and behavioral factors so SMI can be appropriately 
identified, treated and prevented [3, 7].
Cancer is a complex disease that results in many physical, psychological, and emotional side 
effects that can persist well beyond active treatment. As a result, cancer survivors often 
change the way in which they allocate their cognitive resources and effort in order to cope 
with the disease and its side effects [7]. While there have been several studies exploring the 
relationship between SMI and anxiety, depression and fatigue in breast cancer survivors, 
fewer studies have examined whether other cognitive processes/perceptions (e.g. beliefs, 
perceptions) or behavioral factors (e.g. diet, medication adherence, physical activity) are 
related to SMI. Two factors that may be of particular interest are self-efficacy and physical 
activity.
Lower self-efficacy of various types (i.e. interpersonal and instrumental) has been associated 
with poorer performance on memory tasks in the general population and has been shown to 
be predictive of cognitive change in older adults [8, 9]. Lower symptom management self-
efficacy has been associated with elevated psychological distress [10] while lower exercise 
self-efficacy has been associated with increased depression and fatigue [11] and poorer 
quality of life [12] in breast cancer survivors. In addition, symptom management self-
efficacy has been shown to mediate the relationship between SMI and depression, anxiety 
and quality of life in hematological cancer survivors [10]. Changes in resource allocation 
necessary to cope with breast cancer, may negatively impact women’s self-efficacy for 
regulating and coping with their emotions, thoughts and behaviors which, in turn, may result 
in perceptions of constrained and impaired memory functioning [7, 13].
In contrast, increased physical activity has been consistently and positively associated with 
the maintenance and improvement of objectively-measured cognitive functioning, 
particularly executive functioning and memory [14]. Moreover, higher physical activity [15]

 and fitness [16] have been associated with lower SMI in the general population and older 
adults. Emerging cross-sectional evidence indicates increased moderate to vigorous intensity 
physical activity and aerobic fitness may also be related to improved cognitive functioning 
among cancer survivors [17–19]. Physical activity is also consistently, positively associated 
with improved psychosocial outcomes and quality of life among breast cancer survivors 
[20]. While physical activity is reciprocally related to exercise self-efficacy (i.e. greater 
physical activity is associated with greater self-efficacy and vice versa) [21], increasing 
evidence indicates the relationship between physical activity and psychosocial outcomes (i.e. 
fatigue, quality of life) may be mediated by exercise self-efficacy in breast cancer survivors 
[11,12]. As such, the relationship between physical activity and SMI may also be mediated 
by exercise self-efficacy, alone, and the pathways between physical activity, self-efficacy and 
other psychosocial factors.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between physical activity, 
psychological factors (i.e. stress, depression, anxiety and fear of cancer recurrence), exercise 
self-efficacy and SMI in a sample of breast cancer survivors at baseline and among potential 
changes in these variables over the 6 month study period when controlling for baseline 
associations and stability in measures across time. We hypothesized changes in physical 
activity participation over the 6-month period would be indirectly associated with changes in 
SMI via changes in exercise self-efficacy which would, in turn, directly, and indirectly 
influence changes in SMI, via changes in distress and fatigue (see Figure 1). Specifically: a) 
increases in physical activity would be directly associated with increases in exercise self-
efficacy; b) increases in exercise self-efficacy would, in turn, be associated with reduced 
distress and fatigue; c) reduced distress would be associated with reductions in fatigue and 
SMI and d) reduced fatigue would be associated with reduced SMI. This model may provide 
a better understanding of the potential relationships among PA, psychosocial factors and 
SMI and inform future investigations and interventions in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS
Participants
This study consists of a subsample of women recruited to participate in a larger study. 
Women were included in the present study if they were aged 18 years and older, had been 
diagnosed with breast cancer, were English-speaking, had access to a computer, and had 
completed active treatment (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation).
Measures
Demographics—Self-reported marital status, age, race, ethnicity, occupation, income, and 
education were collected.
Health and cancer history—Participants’ were asked to indicate (yes or no) whether or 
not they have been diagnosed with a list of 18 different comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, obesity, 
hypertension). All items with a positive response were summed to obtain total number of 
comorbidities. Women also self-reported information regarding their breast cancer (i.e. stage

 of disease, time since diagnosis in months, treatment regime) and menopausal status at 
diagnosis. Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI).
Subjective Memory Impairment—The Frequency of Forgetting Questionnaire [22] was 
used to assess the frequency with which participants had forgotten things (e.g. names, where 
they have put things, directions) on a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (always) to 7 (never). 
There are 4 subscales: general memory rating (1 item); general frequency of forgetting (4 
items), frequency of forgetting when reading (2 items) and remembering past events (2 
items). Items from each subscale were summed to obtain subscale scores and all items were 
summed to obtain a total score. Lower scores reflect a greater frequency of forgetting. Scale 
reliability was excellent at baseline and follow-up (α= 0.89 for both).
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [23]—This scale assesses the frequency of 
depressive states (7 items) and anxiety (7 items) over the past week on a 4-point Likert scale 
from 0 (not at all) to 3 (most of the time). Individual items for each subscale were summed 
to achieve total scores ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores are indicative of greater 
symptomology. The reliability of both subscales was adequate at baseline (α= 0.82; α= 
0.83) and follow-up (α= 0.82; α= 0.84) for the depression and anxiety subscale, 
respectively.
Perceived Stress Scale [24]—This 10-item scale was used to measure participants’ 
perception of stress during the last month on a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). 
Positively stated items are reverse scored and al items were summed to obtain a total stress 
score ranging from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of greater perceived stress. The 
reliability was excellent and baseline and follow-up (α= 0.90 at both).
Concerns About Recurrence Scale [25]—The 4-item overall fear of recurrence 
subscale was used to assess women’s concerns about breast cancer recurrence. Scores are 
given on a 6-point Likert scale that can range from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very). Total scores 
were obtained by summing items and dividing by 4 to obtain values between 1 and 6 with 
higher scores reflecting more concerns about breast cancer recurrence. Reliability was 
acceptable at baseline and follow-up (α= 0.97 for both).
Fatigue Symptom Inventory [26]—This scale was used to assess the severity (4 items), 
frequency (2 items), and perceived interference (7 items) of fatigue. Items from each scale 
were summed to obtain subscales, and higher scores are reflective of greater fatigue. The 
reliability was acceptable at baseline (α= 0.89; α= 0.94; α= 0.77) and 6 months (α= 0.91; 
α= 0.95; α= 0.81) for the severity, interference, and duration subscales, respectively.
Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire [27]—This questionnaire assessed 
participants’ frequency of strenuous (e.g., jogging), moderate (e.g., fast walking), and mild 
(e.g., easy walking) exercise over the past seven days and the average amount of time they 
participated in these activities. Activity frequencies were multiplied by 9, 5, and 3 metabolic 
equivalents, respectively, and summed to create a total leisure time activity score.

 Actigraph accelerometer (model GT1M, Health One Technology, Fort Walton 
Beach, FL)—The Actigraph, a valid and reliable objective physical activity measure [28], 
was used to measure physical activity in a random subsample of the study population. These 
women were instructed to wear the monitor for seven consecutive days on the non-dominant 
hip during all waking hours, except for when bathing or swimming. Activity data was 
collected in one-minute intervals (epochs). A valid day of accelerometer wear was defined as 
wearing the monitor for 10 hours with no more than 60 minutes of consecutive zero-values. 
Each minute of wear time was classified according to intensity (counts/min) using 
commonly accepted activity count cut-points [29] as follows: sedentary (<100), light (100–
2019), and moderate to vigorous (≥ 2020). The number of minutes with intensity counts 
≥100 was taken as an estimate of total time spent active for a given day and were divided by 
number of days of wear time to reach the average daily minutes of physical activity. Only 
data for individuals with a minimum of 3 valid days of wear time at both time points were 
included in analyses. All values were adjusted for wear time to control for potential 
difference between individuals.
Exercise Self-efficacy—The 6-item Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale [30] was used to assess 
participants’ beliefs in their ability to exercise five times per week, at a moderate intensity, 
for ≥30 minutes per session at two week increments over the next 12 weeks. The 15-item 
Barriers Self-Efficacy Scale [30] assessed participants’ perceived capabilities to exercise 
three times per week for 40 minutes over the next two months in the face of barriers to 
participation. Items from each scale are scored on a 100-point percentage scale with 10-
point increments, ranging from 0% (not at all confident) to 100% (highly confident). For 
each measure, total scores were calculated using the average confidence rating. The 
reliability was excellent at baseline (α= 0.99; α= 0.96) and follow-up (α= 0.99; α= 0.96) for 
exercise self-efficacy and barriers self-efficacy, respectively.
Recruitment and Randomization
All study procedures and recruitment methods were approved by the university institutional 
review board are detailed in prior studies from this sample [11, 12]. Briefly, participants 
were recruited via an e-blast sent to the Army of Women,© a nationwide database to connect 
women interested in breast cancer-related research with researchers, University e-mail, 
fliers, print media, and on-line community groups and postings. Of those women who 
expressed initial interest (N = 2,546), 1631 qualified for participation and completed 
informed consent (N = 1,631). A sub-group of individuals (n=500) were completely 
randomly assigned using a pre-populated computer algorithm to wear an accelerometer for 7 
days at baseline and 6 months. At 6-month follow-up, 1527 women completed all survey 
data and 370 had valid accelerometer data at both time points. For the purposes of this study 
we only included women who were post-treatment (n=1,477 for analyses using self-report 
and n=362 for analyses using accelerometer data).
Data Collection
Women randomized to the survey only group were sent an individualized secure link to the 
study questionnaires. Women randomized to wear the accelerometer were sent a link to the 
study questionnaires on the day their study packet containing an accelerometer, related study

 materials and a self-addressed stamped envelope was mailed. All participants were 
instructed to return study materials within two weeks of receipt. Reminder e-mails for 
surveys were sent on a bi-weekly basis until questionnaires were complete or participants 
had been contacted three times, whichever came first. Women were reminded to return 
accelerometers until they were received by study investigators. Identical procedures were 
followed for both groups at 6 months.
Data Analysis
Independent sample t-tests were conducted to examine changes among model variables 
across the 6 month study period. To examine the hypothesized relationships, panel analyses 
within a covariance framework were conducted in Mplus V6.0 [30]. Panel models are 
ideally suited to the analysis of hypothesized, theoretically-based relationships. This 
approach allowed for the examination of the hypothesized relationships at baseline and those 
same relationships among changes in the constructs at 6 months controlling for all other 
variables in the model. We conducted two separate panel analyses. The first tested the 
hypothesized model in all study participants using self-reported physical activity data 
whereas the second tested the hypothesized model in the accelerometer subgroup only. Age, 
education, income, body mass index, number of comorbidities, time since diagnosis, disease 
stage, menopausal status at diagnosis, adjuvant treatment type received (chemotherapy 
and/or radiation therapy), and current receipt of hormone therapy were controlled for in each 
of the analyses.
The robust full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimator was used in the present 
study [32] as a result of preliminary analyses indicating missing data were missing at 
random (MAR). A total of 1,203 women (81.4%) had at least some data at 6 month follow-
up. The extent of missing data ranged from 2.4% (Frequency of Forgetting remembering 
past events subscale) to 9.5% (physical activity) at baseline. Missing data at 6-months 
ranged from 18.7% (Frequency of Forgetting general memory rating and frequency of 
forgetting subscale) to 24.1% (anxiety), and was largely the result of loss to follow-up or not 
completing the full questionnaire battery.
Based on prior research examining the constructs included in our model, the following 
hypothesized relationships were tested (see Figure 1): (a) a direct path from physical activity 
to exercise self-efficacy; (b) a direct path from exercise self-efficacy to distress; (c) a direct 
path from exercise self-efficacy to fatigue and (d) a direct path from distress to fatigue and 
(e) distress to SMI and from fatigue to SMI. Exercise self-efficacy, fatigue and distress were 
measured as latent constructs. Self-efficacy used the total scores from the Barrier Self-
efficacy Scale and the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale as indicators. The indicators of fatigue 
consisted of the three Fatigue Symptom Inventory subscales (interference, duration, and 
severity) and the indicators of distress were the total scores from the Concerns About 
Recurrence Scale and Perceived Stress Scale and the depression and anxiety subscale score 
from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. SMI was modeled as a latent construct 
using the 4 subscales of the Frequency of Forgetting Scale. For the accelerometer 
subsample, physical activity was modeled as a latent construct with the GLTEQ total score 
and average accelerometer counts as indicators. Stability coefficients were calculated to

 reflect correlations between the same variables across time while controlling for the 
influence of all other variables in the model [33]. In addition, the modification indices were 
examined for other potential relationships among model constructs and potential reciprocal 
relationships.
The chi-square statistic assessed absolute fit of the model to the data. The standardized root 
means residual (SRMR) and Comparative Fit Index46 (CFI) were also used to determine the 
fit of the model. SRMR values approximating 0.08 or less demonstrate close fit of the model 
while CFI values of .90 and ≥0.95 indicate minimally acceptable and good fit value and 
values, respectively [34].
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
We recruited a nationwide sample of breast cancer survivors (M age= 56.3, SD = 9.3) as 
participants for this study. Demographic and disease characteristics of the sample are 
presented in Table 1. The majority of the women were white (96.9%) and non-Hispanic/
Latino (98.6%). Two-thirds of the sample (67.3%) had at least a college degree, and 86.4% 
of the sample had an annual household income greater than or equal to $40,000. The average 
time since diagnosis was 86.8 (+ 70.4) months and the majority of women were diagnosed 
with ductal carcinoma in situ (19.2%) or early stage disease (67.0% stage I or stage II). The 
majority of women had received chemotherapy (59.4%) and 43.3% were currently taking 
some form of hormonal therapy. Finally, 71.9% of the sample reported at least one chronic 
health condition. Details on specific conditions reported is previously published.
Model Results
Table 2 contains the means, standard deviations, and t-values for each of the factors in the 
physical activity and SMI model. Briefly, over the six month study period, women 
experienced a significant (p < 0.05) decline in exercise self-efficacy, fatigue severity, fatigue 
interference, and objective and self-reported physical activity. Fatigue duration and 
frequency of forgetting when reading significantly increased while barriers self-efficacy, all 
other frequency of forgetting subscales and depression did not change over the 6-month 
study period.
Full sample—The proposed model provided a good fit to the data (χ2= 1030.82, df = 320, 
p = < 0.001; CFI= 0.96; SRMR= 0.04). Overall, the stability coefficients were acceptable 
and ranged from 0.45 (fatigue) to 0.82 (distress). This model is shown in Figure 2a. Bi-
directional correlations and stability coefficients are omitted from the figure for clarity.
At baseline, breast cancer survivors who participated in more physical activity had 
significantly (p < 0.05) higher exercise self-efficacy (β = 0.53). In turn, more efficacious 
breast cancer survivors had significantly lower levels of fatigue (β = −0.12) and distress (β 
= −0.32). Survivors who reported higher levels of distress also reported higher levels of 
fatigue (β = 0.63). Finally, higher levels of distress (β = −0.31) and fatigue (β = −0.18) were 
associated with lower Frequency of Forgetting scores which is indicative of greater SMI. 
Additionally, the indirect paths from physical activity to SMI via exercise self-efficacy and

 distress, exercise self-efficacy and fatigue and exercise self-efficacy, distress and fatigue 
were all significant.
At 6-month follow-up, increases in physical activity were significantly associated with 
increases in exercise self-efficacy (β = 0.27). In turn, women who reported increases in 
exercise self-efficacy, reported decreased levels of distress (β = −0.08) and fatigue (β = 
−0.12). Increased levels of distress were associated with increased fatigue levels (β = 0.39). 
Finally, higher levels of distress (β =−0.19) and fatigue (β =−0.10) were associated with 
greater SMI. There were statistically significant indirect paths between residual changes in 
physical activity and residual changes in SMI via residual changes in exercise self-efficacy 
and distress, exercise self-efficacy and fatigue and exercise self-efficacy, distress and fatigue. 
The magnitude of associations among model constructs was moderate to high [35] (β range: 
−0.12 to 0.53) at baseline for all pathways examined. At follow-up, the magnitude of model 
relationships declined slightly, but the majority were still moderate (β-range: −0.08 to 0.27). 
This was expected as this model accounts for baseline relationships and stability of measures 
across time.
Accelerometer Subgroup—The proposed model was an adequate fit to the data (χ2 = 
514.68, df = 320 p = <0.001, CFI = 0.96, SRMR= 0.04). Results from this model are shown 
in Figure 2b and are almost identical to those from the whole sample.
Relationship between Model Variables and Demographic and Disease Characteristics
At baseline, in the full sample, older age was significantly associated with less distress (β= 
−0.29) and increased exercise self-efficacy (β= 0.10). Additionally, women who reported 
more comorbidities reported higher levels of fatigue (β= 0.12) and distress (β= 0.27) and 
lower exercise self-efficacy (β= −0.12) and self-reported physical activity (β= −0.09). 
Higher BMI was associated with higher fatigue (β= 0.07) and lower exercise self-efficacy 
(β= −0.12), self-reported physical activity (β= −0.20) and SMI (β= 0.07). Higher income 
was associated with higher self-efficacy (β= 0.07). Higher education was associated with 
lower SMI (β= 0.10) and greater self-reported physical activity (β= 0.11). Additionally, 
longer time since diagnosis was significantly associated with lower fatigue (β= −0.08) and 
distress (β= −0.08). Finally, receipt of chemotherapy was associated with lower SMI (β= 
0.12). At follow-up, higher education was associated with increased fatigue (β= 0.04) and 
more advanced disease and increased number of comorbidities were associated with lower 
self-reported physical activity (β= −0.07 and −0.05, respectively). Finally, higher BMI was 
associated with lower SMI (β= 0.05).
In the accelerometer subsample, younger age (β= −0.26), higher education (β= 0.13), less 
advanced disease stage (β= −0.14), longer time since diagnosis (β= 0.14), fewer 
comorbidities (β= −0.12) and lower BMI (β= −0.14) were all associated with increased 
accelerometer-assessed physical activity at baseline. No demographic or disease factors were 
significantly related to accelerometer-assessed activity at follow-up.

 CONCLUSIONS
Although physical activity has consistently been shown to be associated with improved 
objective and self-reported cognitive functioning in the general population and aging adults, 
few studies have examined these relationships in cancer survivors. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between physical activity, 
psychosocial factors, exercise self-efficacy, and SMI in any cancer survivor group. As 
hypothesized, the influence of physical activity on SMI was indirect rather than direct, 
operating through exercise self-efficacy, distress and fatigue. The hypothesized relationships 
among changes in these constructs over a 6 month period were supported when controlling 
for baseline relationships and covariates. Further, the model held in the subsample with 
objectively measured physical activity.
Our findings regarding an inverse relationships between SMI and psychosocial factors are 
consistent with other studies in cancer survivors that have demonstrated an inverse negative 
relationship between cognitive functioning and anxiety [36], depression [37] and fatigue 
[38]. The observed indirect associations between higher physical activity and higher self-
efficacy and lower SMI represent novel findings in breast cancer survivors. These results are 
consistent with findings from the general population [16] and hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant survivors [10] that demonstrate an inverse association between self-efficacy and 
SMI and physical activity and SMI [15]. The present study provides initial evidence to 
indicate that, in addition to psychosocial well-being, exercise self-efficacy and physical 
activity may be related to SMI in breast cancer survivors.
The indirect relationships between increased physical activity participation, higher exercise 
self-efficacy, better psychosocial well-being and higher SMI in this study, provide 
preliminary evidence to indicate physical activity may be a potentially effective intervention 
for reducing SMI in breast cancer survivors. Additional, potential mechanisms underlying 
the relationship between physical activity and SMI and other measures of cognitive 
functioning include improved cardiorespiratory fitness, increased neurogenesis and changes 
in neurochemicals (e.g. BDNF, IGF; [14]). Future research is warranted to understand these 
relationships and potential mechanisms further.
Self-efficacy may exert its influence on distress, fatigue and SMI via its impact on both 
psychological and biological processes. Cancer is a complex disease that results in many 
physical, psychological, and emotional side effects that can persist well beyond active 
treatment. Changes in cognitive resource allocation needed to manage these symptoms may 
result in lower self-efficacy and compromised executive functioning and increased 
perceptions of impaired memory functioning [7]. Alternatively, low self-efficacy and high 
levels of anxiety, depression and stress may be indicative of negative affectivity bias which 
may lead those experiencing these symptoms to be more aware of memory impairment or 
interpret lapses in memory more negatively [39]. Negative affectivity may also increase the 
likelihood of a breast cancer survivor identifying as “sick” which may set in motion a self-
perpetuating process whereby “sickness behavior” is increased and symptom self-
management, cognitively challenging tasks and healthy behaviors are decreased [39]. In 
turn, this may lead to decreased self-efficacy for symptom management, cognitive tasks and

 health behaviors which may result in further increases in psychosocial problems, cognitive 
dysfunction and unhealthy behaviors [40]. In experimental studies where self-efficacy is 
manipulated via false feedback, individuals who receive feedback designed to elevate self-
efficacy report more positive well-being and reduced levels of psychological distress, fatigue 
and state anxiety during a single bout of activity [41]. Thus, prolonged physical activity 
participation may influence distress, fatigue and SMI through a sustained, additive effect on 
exercise self-efficacy. Finally, increased exercise self-efficacy may impact distress, fatigue 
and SMI via its effect on breast cancer survivors’ feelings of controllability and the influence 
of controllability on stress and biomarkers associated with depression and fatigue [42].
While the findings from this study are promising, there are several limitations. First, the 
study population is relatively homogeneous. Most of the women are white and highly 
educated with high annual household incomes. Thus, findings from this study may not be 
generalizable to all breast cancer survivors. Second, this study adopted a longitudinal 
observational design that spanned only a period of 6 months. While there were statistically 
significant declines in group-level mean physical activity during the study period, there were 
no statistically significant changes in group-level mean values for the Frequency of 
Forgetting Scale for the total score or most subscales. However, the levels of SMI reported in 
this sample were similar to levels reported in healthy women who were, on average, 10 years 
older than our sample [43], indicating breast survivors may be experiencing higher levels of 
SMI at younger ages. These data suggest that while a period of 6 months may be adequate to 
observe natural changes in physical activity as a result of potential changes in motivation, 
health status, climate, etc., this may not be a sufficient period of time to observe changes in 
SMI. Future longitudinal studies should explore these relationships with longer follow-up 
periods and at various time points during survivorship (i.e. pre-, during, and post-treatment). 
Additionally, randomized controlled exercise trials are necessary to determine whether 
model relationships hold as a result of intervention. Finally, we only had measures of self-
efficacy specific to exercise. Future studies should include additional measures of self-
efficacy (e.g. coping, efficacy to self-manage symptoms) to determine whether these 
relationships differ based on types of measures used.
Because SMI may be influenced by numerous factors, future research should more 
comprehensively examine the relationship among physical activity, psychosocial, self-
regulatory and physiological parameters to better understand the mechanisms underlying 
these relationships and to ascertain modifiable intervention targets. Findings from this 
research could also be used to identify specific subgroups of breast cancer survivors who 
may be at high risk for SMI so they can receive early intervention to prevent or alleviate 
these problems and reduce potential negative side effects. While data from this study 
indicate that increased physical activity may be beneficial for improving self-efficacy and 
psychosocial well-being and reducing SMI in breast cancer survivors using both self-report 
and objective measures of activity, future research should explore whether there is an 
optimal time (pre-, during post-treatment) to intervene or optimal dosage (type and intensity) 
of activity necessary to elicit or maximize these benefits. Further, the less robust relationship 
between physical activity and self-efficacy observed in the accelerometer subsample likely 
reflects the lower bias associated with objective measures, indicating accelerometers should 
be incorporated in future studies when possible. Finally, future research should explore these

 relationships using objective measures of cognitive functioning to develop a better 
understanding of the role of physical activity in both objective and subjective cognitive 
functioning.
In summary, this study represents an important first step in exploring the relationship 
between SMI and physical activity, self-efficacy, and psychosocial factors in a relatively 
large sample of post-treatment breast cancer survivors using both self-report and objective 
measures of activity. These findings provide initial support for a psychosocial model of 
physical activity and SMI grounded in social-cognitive theory and provide preliminary 
evidence to support an important, modifiable pathway between physical activity and SMI. 
Thus, it may be particularly important for future physical activity interventions and 
programs directed at reducing SMI to be designed specifically to target sources of efficacy 
information. Future studies should seek to replicate, expand and refine this model to improve 
our understanding of the potential relationship between physical activity and SMI in order to 
help reduce SMI and enhance breast cancer survivors’ overall health and well-being.
