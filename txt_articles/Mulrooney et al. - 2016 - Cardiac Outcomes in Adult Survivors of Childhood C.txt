Abstract
Background—Studies of cardiac disease among adult survivors of childhood cancer have 
generally relied upon self-reported or registry-based data.
Objective—Systematically assess cardiac outcomes among childhood cancer survivors
Design—Cross-sectional
Setting—St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
Patients—1,853 adult survivors of childhood cancer, ≥18 years old, and ≥10 years from 
treatment with cardiotoxic therapy for childhood cancer.
Measurements—History/physical examination, fasting metabolic and lipid panels, 
echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (ECG), 6-minute walk test (6MWT) all collected at baseline 
evaluation.
Results—Half (52.3%) of the survivors were male, median age 8.0 years (range: 0-24) at cancer 
diagnosis, 31.0 years (18-60) at evaluation. Cardiomyopathy was present in 7.4% (newly 
identified at the time of evaluation in 4.7%), coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3.8% (newly 
identified in 2.2%), valvular regurgitation/stenosis in 28.0% (newly identified in 24.8%), and 
conduction/rhythm abnormalities in 4.6% (newly identified in 1.4%). Nearly all (99.7%) were 
asymptomatic. The prevalences of cardiac conditions increased with age at evaluation, ranging 
from 3-24% among those 30-39 years to 10-37% among those ≥40 years. On multivariable 
analysis, anthracycline exposure ≥250 mg/m2 increased the odds of cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 
[OR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.9) compared to anthracycline unexposed survivors. Radiation to the heart 
increased the odds of cardiomyopathy (OR 1.9 95% CI 1.1-3.7) compared to radiation unexposed 
survivors. Radiation >1500 cGy with any anthracycline exposure conferred the greatest odds for 
valve findings.
Limitations—61% participation rate of survivors exposed to cardiotoxic therapies, which were 
limited to anthracyclines and cardiac-directed radiation. A comparison group and longitudinal 
assessments are not available.
Conclusions—Cardiovascular screening identified considerable subclinical disease among adult 
survivors of childhood cancer.
Funding—Cancer Center Support Grant (CA21765), U01 CA195547 1, American Lebanese 
Syrian Associated Charities
Introduction
Improvements in cancer therapies have led to an increasing number of survivors living many 
years following successful treatment. With overall 5-year survival rates in pediatric 
oncology exceeding 80%(1), the number of adult survivors of childhood or adolescent 
cancer, currently estimated to be 388,500 in the United States, is projected to surpass

 500,000 by 2020.(2, 3) This success is tempered by recognition of adverse late effects of 
cancer therapy and elevated mortality years following treatment. An 8-fold increased risk of 
death has been reported among 5-year childhood cancer survivors compared to the age- and 
sex- matched general population.(4) Historically, the leading cause of death has been cancer 
recurrence. However, death from late-effects has become the leading cause of mortality 30 
years from diagnosis, frequently attributed to premature cardiovascular disease.(5)
Given the rarity of childhood cancer and the challenges of following patients across the life 
spectrum, most studies have relied upon self-reported outcomes(6), registry(7) or death 
certificate data(8) to estimate the prevalence and incidence of adverse outcomes. Few have 
directly assessed survivors or performed detailed clinical evaluations.(9, 10) The aim of this 
study was to report clinically-evaluated cardiac outcomes among adults previously exposed 
to cardiotoxic therapies for the treatment of childhood cancer.
Methods
Participants
Cases for this analysis were participants who completed a baseline evaluation in the St. Jude 
Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE), an ongoing study designed to facilitate longitudinal evaluation of 
health outcomes among adults previously treated for a pediatric malignancy. The study 
design and details have been previously published.(11) To be enrolled in the cohort 
participants must have been diagnosed and treated for a childhood cancer at St. Jude 
Children's Research Hospital, currently be ≥18 years old, and have survived ≥10 years from 
diagnosis. This cross-sectional analysis includes data collected during the baseline 
evaluation. Participants (recruited from 44 states and 28 countries) must have been treated 
with cardiotoxic therapy (anthracycline chemotherapy and/or cardiac-directed radiation 
therapy) and completed the initial on-campus SJLIFE comprehensive risk-based health 
evaluation as of April 30, 2013.
Survivors completed a detailed health questionnaire and underwent medical evaluation 
according to the Children's Oncology Group's Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for 
Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers.(12) Assessments included: 
a history and physical examination, fasting laboratory battery (blood counts, metabolic 
panel, insulin level, glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid panel), echocardiogram, and 
electrocardiogram (ECG). Two-dimensional (2D) Doppler ultrasound echocardiography was 
performed using a VIVID-7 machine (GE Medical Systems) (n=1834) or an iE33 (Phillips 
Healthcare) (n=19) using Harmonic Imaging per American Society of Echocardiography 
guidelines with 3D imaging for left ventricular volumes.(13) All images were centrally 
reviewed by the echocardiography laboratory in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine 
at the Cleveland Clinic. A total of 1,586 (86%) participants had an evaluable 
echocardiogram sufficient for adequate determination of ejection fraction and 1,742 (94%) 
sufficient for evaluation of cardiac valves. Twelve-lead ECG (GE MAC 1200 machine) was 
obtained and centrally reviewed and coded per the Minnesota classification system by the 
Epidemiological Cardiology Research Center at Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-
Salem, NC (1,798 participants completed an ECG).

 Medical record abstraction was performed to capture cumulative anthracycline exposure in 
milligrams per body surface area in meters squared (mg/m2), mean cardiac radiation dose, 
and medical events during and after therapy. Anthracycline doses were converted to 
doxorubicin isotoxic equivalents by summing doxorubicin, daunorubicin (x0.83), epirubicin 
(x0.67), idarubicin (x5), and mitoxantrone (x4) doses.(14) Mean radiation dose to the heart 
in centigray (cGy) was estimated using previously established methods by the radiation 
physicists at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.(15) Radiation treatment details 
included energy source, tumor dose, and field locations. Scatter dose to the heart was 
estimated for each case, regardless of radiation site and target volume. The SJLIFE protocol 
and study documents were approved by the Institutional Review Board, and survivors 
provided informed consent prior to participation.
Outcomes
Outcomes analyzed included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), valve 
function, and conduction/rhythm defects. Medical records were obtained to validate 
established cardiac outcomes reported prior to the SJLIFE assessment. Cardiomyopathy was 
defined as a systolic ejection fraction <50% on echocardiogram. Coronary artery disease 
was defined as a history of myocardial infarction, evidence of wall motion defect on 
echocardiogram, and/or ischemia on ECG. Valves were assessed for function (regurgitation 
or stenosis) and structure (thickening and/or calcification) identified by echocardiogram. 
Only functional valve findings (graded as mild, moderate, or severe) were used in the 
analysis.(16, 17) Conduction/rhythm disorders included major conduction abnormalities or 
arrhythmias (Appendix Table 1) as assessed by the Minnesota ECG Code.(18)
Covariates
Physical activity was assessed by asking participants if they participated in “usual weekly 
vigorous activities for at least 10 minutes at a time such as: running, aerobics, wheelchair 
basketball, heavy yard work, or anything else that caused large increases in breathing or 
heart rate; or moderate activities for at least 10 minutes such as: brisk walking, bicycling, 
gardening, manual operation of a wheelchair, or anything else that caused small increases in 
breathing or heart rate” (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_09_10/paq_f.pdf). 
The frequency of exercise sessions per week was multiplied by the duration of each session 
and weighted by the standardized classification of the energy expenditure in metabolic 
equivalents expressed as metabolic equivalent minutes/week (inactive ≤450). Physical 
fitness was assessed by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT)(19) and considered abnormal if the 
participant walked <490 meters.(20) Risky drinking was defined as alcohol consumption of 
≥5 drinks on one occasion or ≥15 drinks per week for men, and ≥4 drinks on one occasion or 
≥8 drinks per week for women (http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm#heavyDrinking). 
Survivors who reported smoking within the last month were classified as current smokers, 
and those who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, but not within the last month, 
were considered past smokers. Dyslipidemia was defined as low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol ≥160 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl (men) or <50 mg/dl 
(women), triglycerides >150 mg/dl, or on treatment for a lipid abnormality. Diabetes was 
defined as a fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin ≥6.5%, or on an 
oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin for diabetes. Duplicate blood pressure readings were

 obtained in a seated position with both feet on the floor following a 5 minute rest with the 
lowest used for analysis. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥140 
mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or being on an anti-hypertensive agent.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic, treatment, and cardiovascular risk 
factors (i.e. body mass index (BMI) at SJLIFE assessment, smoking, drinking, physical 
activity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia). Chi-square tests were used to compare 
demographic and treatment characteristics between study participants and non-participants. 
Frequencies of cardiac conditions reported before or diagnosed during the on-campus 
evaluations were ascertained and prevalence by age at detection reported. Multivariable 
logistic models were used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and cardiac 
conditions detected during the on-campus evaluations, excluding participants with cardiac 
outcomes detected prior to SJLIFE participation. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Covariates were selected due to their known and 
previously reported associations with cardiac outcomes in the general population and among 
adult survivors of childhood cancer. Proportions of participants with poor physical fitness 
(6MWT <490 meters) were calculated and associations with cardiac conditions evaluated by 
multivariable logistic regression with age, sex, and height as covariates. To account for any 
missing cardiac outcomes, radiation dose (N=26), and 30 missing 6MWT (not due to a 
musculoskeletal cause), we used multiple imputation (SAS proc MI and proc 
MIANALYZE). Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used for partial 
imputation of non-monotone missing records.(21) Monotone missing data were imputed 
using logistic regression. Pooled estimates of 20 multiply imputed datasets of the 
multivariable analyses for each outcome are reported as OR with 95% CI. SAS version 9.3 
(Cary, NC) was used for all analyses. All statistical inference was based on two-sided tests.

The funding sources had no role in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study or the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
Results
Among 3,054 participants exposed to cardiotoxic therapies, 1,853 (61%) returned to St. Jude 
Children's Research Hospital for a risk-based medical evaluation. Reasons for non-
participation are shown in Appendix Figure 1. Compared to non-participants, participating 
survivors were more likely to be female, white, and have a history of leukemia. 
Additionally, participants were on average 8 months older and received on average less (9 
mg/m2) total anthracycline exposure (Table 1). Just over half (52.3%) of participants were 
male with a median age at diagnosis of 8.0 years (range: 0-24) and 31.0 years (18-60) at 
time of study. Median time from diagnosis was 22.6 years (10-48); nearly two-thirds were 
more than 20 years from exposure. The majority of survivors had been treated for leukemia 
or lymphoma (67.2%). Other diagnostic categories included: sarcoma (14%), Wilms tumor 
(7.2%), neuroblastoma (4.5%), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (4.3%), and a variety 
of other tumors (2.8%).

 Cardiotoxic exposures included anthracycline and radiation therapy. Over 82% were 
exposed to anthracyclines, with 20.8% receiving cumulative doses in excess of 250 mg/m2. 
Less than half received radiation to the heart, but 22.2% had a cardiac dose >1500 cGy. 
(Appendix Table 2) Cardiovascular risk factors present at the time of SJLIFE assessment 
included being overweight or obese (61.3%), smoking (23.7% current, 11.7% past), physical 
inactivity (49.6%), hypertension (23.3%), diabetes (6.8%), and dyslipidemia (61.9%).
The prevalence of each outcome and the result of cardiovascular screening is shown in 
Table 2. Cardiomyopathy was identified in 7.4% of the population with more than half being 
detected during the SJLIFE assessment. Screening identified 4.7% with previously 
undiagnosed cardiomyopathy. Similarly, 3.8% and 4.6% of the population was found to 
have evidence of CAD or a conduction/rhythm disorder; 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, 
newly identified by screening. Functional valve findings were frequent (28.0%) with most 
being identified during the SJLIFE assessment (24.8%). The prevalence and severity of 
regurgitation and stenosis in each valve is shown in Table 3. The majority were mild, with 
most being regurgitation of the tricuspid or pulmonary valves. Moderate or severe mitral 
regurgitation or stenosis was identified in 26 (1.5%) and 2 (0.1%) survivors, respectively. 
Sixty-four survivors (3.7%) had aortic regurgitation (16 were moderate, 3 severe) and 31 
(1.8%) had aortic stenosis (4 moderate, 9 severe). Mitral valve thickening or annular 
calcifications were identified in 351 (20.2%) and 177 (10.2%), respectively, and 414 
(23.8%) had aortic valve thickening and 107 (6.1%) aortic calcifications. One hundred sixty 
survivors (9.2%) had more than one valve involved.
The prevalence of each outcome increased with increasing age at evaluation and ranged 
from 10-37% among those more than 40 years old (Table 4). Nearly 5% of participants <30 
years old had evidence of cardiomyopathy. However, most of the outcomes were identified 
in participants 30 years or older, with the exception of valvular regurgitation and/or stenosis, 
which was identified in over a quarter of survivors between 18-29 years.
Table 5 shows the associations between sex, age at diagnosis, age at evaluation, treatment 
factors, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors for cardiomyopathy and valvular disease. 
The odds of cardiomyopathy were significantly associated with male sex, anthracycline 
doses ≥250 mg/m2, cardiac radiation exposure in excess of 1500cGy, and hypertension. 
Younger age at diagnosis and higher radiation doses were associated with increased odds of 
functional valve findings. Associations between radiation and valvular disease varied 
according to the anthracycline exposure (interaction p<0.001), with the highest odds being 
among those exposed to the highest doses of radiation and any anthracycline exposure. A 
reduction in the odds ratio for valve disease was noted among obese survivors and those 
with dyslipidemia. There were not enough CAD and conduction/rhythm abnormalities to 
support a fully adjusted multivariable model, yet it appeared these outcomes were more 
common with older age (≥40 years) and among those with cardiac radiation doses >1500 
cGy. (Appendix Table 3).
Although most findings were asymptomatic (4 survivors reported intermittent chest pain; 1 
palpitations) and only identified on screening, physical performance was significantly

 impaired. Survivors with cardiomyopathy and CAD had approximately twice the odds of 
having an abnormal 6MWT compared to those without these cardiac effects. (Table 6)
Discussion
Cardiovascular disease and cancer, the leading causes of death among U.S. adults, have both 
been the target of therapeutic advances and survival gains over the last five decades. 
However, among adults previously treated for a pediatric malignancy, cardiovascular 
disease can present at an earlier age with substantial morbidity for which screening methods, 
modalities, and frequencies remain unclear.(6) Systematically screening the largest 
prospective cohort of adults previously treated for a childhood cancer, we identified 
subclinical cardiovascular disease among individuals generally too young for typical 
cardiovascular risk-stratification. While most cardiovascular disease was asymptomatic, 
significant associations with limited physical performance were identified.
Studies of cardiotoxicity following cancer therapy have largely focused on cardiomyopathy 
while only a few have included a broader range of outcomes, such as CAD, valvular disease, 
and conduction/ rhythm abnormalities.(6, 22-26) Frequencies of these findings have varied 
widely due to differing screening methods, diagnostic groups studied, outcome definitions, 
and study methodologies. In a systematic review, Kremer et al. reported subclinical 
cardiomyopathy ranging from 0-57%.(27) However, many of the studies focused on a 
particular diagnosis and a variety of definitions for cardiomyopathy. Among studies that 
evaluated a cross-section of childhood cancer diagnoses and more closely defined 
cardiomyopathy, the prevalence was narrower, between 5-20%.
Systematic screening identified a substantial number of survivors with asymptomatic 
cardiomyopathy at high risk for progression to symptomatic heart failure. At a median age 
of 31 years, we identified 7.5% of survivors with evidence of decreased systolic function; an 
estimate expected in a much older population. In a randomly selected healthy population, 
Redfield and colleagues found an EF ≤50% in 3% of those 45-54 years old and 4.8% and 
7.1% among those 55-64 and 65-74 years, respectively.(28) The risk of progression to heart 
failure among persons with untreated systolic dysfunction is significant (29) and has been 
reported to be as high as 9% per year with a 3-year mortality of 16%.(30) In fact, according 
to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association classification 
system, these cancer survivors have already progressed from stage A (high risk for 
developing congestive heart failure) to stage B (asymptomatic) heart failure.(31)
The prevalence of CAD, valve findings, and conduction/rhythm defects has been less 
frequently described and commonly only within smaller disease-focused studies. Coronary 
artery disease, typically associated with cardiac directed radiation, has mostly been studied 
among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma or breast cancer.(32, 33) However, the Childhood 
Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) reported myocardial infarction in 0.7% of 14,358 childhood 
cancer survivors at a median age of 27 years.(6) In the SJLIFE cohort the prevalence of 
ischemic disease was higher (3.8%), likely due to the inclusion of subclinical findings, but 
also potentially influenced by the slightly older age of the cohort and longer follow-up time. 
Studies among Hodgkin lymphoma survivors have suggested a high fatality rate for

 radiation-induced CAD and a higher risk for patients treated under age 21 years.(34) CAD in 
this population is often proximal in the coronary tree, resulting in considerable myocardial 
loss following infarction. In fact, using CT angiography screening in a pilot study of 
Hodgkin lymphoma survivors from the SJLIFE cohort, we found obstructive and non-
obstructive coronary disease, with 67% of the lesions located in the proximal coronary 
circulation.(35)
Valvular disease has also been mostly studied among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, due 
to the common use of mediastinal radiation therapy to treat this disease.(36) Based upon 
self-report, the prevalence of valve abnormalities in the CCSS cohort was 1.6% across a 
variety of diagnostic groups and was associated with radiation and anthracycline exposure 
(≥250 mg/m2).(6) The prevalence of valve findings was much higher as a result of 
systematic screening. In our initial report (26), we identified an abnormality in 29% of the 
SJLIFE cohort and 56.7% of those treated with radiation to the heart. In a recent study, van 
der Pal and colleagues(37) identified mild, moderate, and severe valve abnormalities in 169 
of 545 (31%) childhood cancer survivors. In our analysis, 28% had a functional valve 
finding. Six survivors had a bicuspid aortic valve and none a known history of rheumatic 
fever. In a population-based study, Nkomo et al. estimated the prevalence of mild or greater 
left-sided valve disease in the general population to be 0.3% (0.2-0.3%) among 18-44 year 
olds and 11.7 % (11.0-12.5%) among those ≥75 years.(38) Notably, the risk of death among 
those with valve disease was 1.36 (95% CI 1.15-1.62) compared to those without. While 
most of the findings in our study were right-sided, 13.7% had a left-sided lesion (8.2% 
mitral, 5.5% aortic).
Like the CCSS, we also identified an association between valvular disease and anthracycline 
exposure. It is not entirely clear why anthracycline therapy might be associated with 
valvular disease but could result from anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy with 
secondary annular dilatation leading to valvular incompetence or toxicity to the valvular 
endothelium. An inverse relationship was noted with BMI. However, this association has 
been described in the general population(39, 40) and may be due to reduced image quality in 
obese patients or hemodynamic changes related to body habitus. Follow-up and focused 
study of valvular disease in this population is warranted.
Conduction and rhythm abnormalities following cancer therapy can be of varied clinical 
significance and more difficult to characterize. Reports have frequently focused on 
particular diagnostic groups and been associated with radiation and/or anthracycline 
exposures.(7, 32, 41) Myocardial fibrosis can induce an arrhythmogenic focus or interrupt 
the normal electrical impulse. ECG abnormalities were identified in 4.6% of our cohort and 
significantly associated with radiation exposure. This prevalence is lower than our previous 
report that also included non-cardiotoxic therapies(26), suggesting that these disorders may 
occur more frequently than expected but may not be exclusively associated with particular 
cardiotoxic exposures. The estimated prevalence of a conduction/rhythm disorder beyond 
age 40 years was 10.3% in this study, higher than that reported in the CCSS.(42) The CCSS 
did not have the benefit of validated ECG screening of all survivors, thus could not report on 
subclinical abnormalities and may be an underestimate. CCSS also reported only Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3-5 abnormalities, thus, the lower

 prevalence might suggest that severe rhythm and conduction defects wane with time from 
diagnosis. A dedicated investigation and classification of ECG findings in cancer survivors 
following cardiotoxic and non-cardiotoxic therapies is needed.
Given the lack of randomized controlled trials to test screening practices, the current 
guidelines for the care of childhood cancer survivors were developed by incorporating best 
available evidence and expert clinical consensus. Only a few studies have investigated the 
effectiveness of adherence to these screening guidelines. In a clinic-based study of 370 
childhood cancer survivors, median age at evaluation 23.9 years (5.3-57.2), Landier et al. 
classified screening practices, based upon the prevalence of late effects observed in the 
literature, as high (≥10%), intermediate (1 to <10%), and negligible (<1%) yield. 
Cardiomyopathy screening was determined to be of intermediate yield (6%) while yield of 
cardiac conduction screening was low (0.08%). Ischemic disease and cardiac valves were 
not evaluated. Two recent analyses assessed cost-effectiveness of echocardiographic 
screening of survivors for cardiomyopathy. Both concluded that the current guideline 
suggestions of imaging every 1-5 years is cost effective, though these benefits might be 
retained even if imaging was performed less frequently and/or with other modalities, such as 
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.(43, 44) Our study provides important additional 
clinical parameters not available in these studies that relied upon self-reported cardiac 
outcomes. Future longitudinal studies, as can be conducted in the SJLIFE cohort, are needed 
to better clarify the progression of cardiomyopathy, the effects of treatment, and the 
implications for clinical practice guidelines related to cardiovascular health surveillance as 
this population ages. Furthermore, our study assessed additional cardiac outcomes and, to 
date, cost effectiveness studies have not been performed for those. The proportion of 
individuals with newly identified cardiac disease in our study was higher for all outcomes 
assessed than previously reported, albeit lowest for conduction/rhythm disorders.
A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. Given the 61% 
participation, selection bias could potentially influence our findings. However, significant 
differences between participants and the SJLIFE source population have not been identified.
(45) An on-campus evaluation was required, thus excluding survivors who may not have 
been able to travel due to commitments, illness, or death, potentially affecting our estimates 
of disease. Additionally, medical records were not routinely obtained for individuals who 
did not report a cardiac event, thus, potentially biasing our estimates. Comparisons were not 
made to a non-cancer control population and, while survivors will be invited to return for a 
repeat evaluation, longitudinal assessments are currently lacking. Only survivors with a 
history of cardiotoxic therapies were studied, limiting the ability to generalize these findings 
and potentially missing cardiac disease in survivors with other exposure histories. Finally, 
among those who did participate, 267 echocardiograms were missing (101 participants 
failed to complete scheduled cardiac evaluations and 166 for technical reasons – suboptimal 
recording, poor electrical transmission, etc.). All reasons were reviewed and treated as

We identified considerable cardiovascular disease in this large cohort of adults cured of
