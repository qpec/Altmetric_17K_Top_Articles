Abstract
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients may have trauma-induced brain lesions detect-
able using CT scans. However, most patients will be CT-negative. There is thus a need for
an additional tool to detect patients at risk. Single blood biomarkers, such as S100B and
GFAP, have been widely studied in mTBI patients, but to date, none seems to perform well
enough. In many different diseases, combining several biomarkers into panels has become
increasingly interesting for diagnoses and to enhance classification performance. The pres-
ent study evaluated 13 proteins individually—H-FABP, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, VCAM,
ICAM, SAA, CRP, GSTP, NKDA, PRDX1, DJ-1 and IL-10—for their capacity to differentiate
between patients with and without a brain lesion according to CT results. The best perform-
ing proteins were then compared and combined with the S100B and GFAP proteins into a
CT-scan triage panel. Patients diagnosed with mTBI, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of
15 and one additional clinical symptom were enrolled at three different European sites. A
blood sample was collected at hospital admission, and a CT scan was performed. Patients
were divided into two two-centre cohorts and further dichotomised into CT-positive and CT-
negative groups for statistical analysis. Single markers and panels were evaluated using
Cohort 1. Four proteins—H-FABP, IL-10, S100B and GFAP—showed significantly higher
levels in CT-positive patients. The best-performing biomarker was H-FABP, with a specific-
ity of 32% (95% CI 23–40) and sensitivity reaching 100%. The best-performing two-marker

 panel for Cohort 1, subsequently validated in Cohort 2, was a combination of H-FABP and
GFAP, enhancing specificity to 46% (95% CI 36–55). When adding IL-10 to this panel, spec-
ificity reached 52% (95% CI 43–61) with 100% sensitivity. These results showed that pro-
teins combined into panels could be used to efficiently classify CT-positive and CT-negative
mTBI patients.
Introduction
Biomarkers have been intensively studied for their potential as diagnostic tools in cases of
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI): to allow accurate diagnosis, improve patient management
speeds and reduce medical costs.[1, 2] mTBI is diagnosed from its clinical symptoms and a
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score between 13 and 15.[3] Determining whether patients have
a trauma-induced brain lesion requires a head CT scan.[4, 5] However, CT scans are widely
overused, as only 10% of mTBI patients who undergo one will be diagnosed with a brain
lesion.[6, 7] In an attempt to reduce the high numbers of CT scans performed, several proteins
have been investigated as potential triage markers. These include S100 calcium binding protein
B (S100B) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) both astrocyte damage markers, heart fatty
acid binding protein (H-FABP) an intracellular vascular and brain fatty-acid transporter and
interleukin 10 (IL-10) an anti-inflammatory protein. [8–21] The wide range of biomarker
types investigated so far can be explained by the complex pathophysiological nature of TBI.[1]
The mechanical forces of a trauma can lead to cell damage due to the shearing, tearing and
stretching of neurons, axons, glial and blood vessels, and this damage will further induce bio-
chemical alterations such as excitotoxicity, necrosis and apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflam-
mation.[4, 22] Similar pathophysiological alterations can also be observed in other acute brain
injury disorders, such as stroke.[22] A wide range of proteins, of different origins and from dif-
ferent pathways, have been studied as biomarkers for stroke diagnostics and prognostics.[23]
However, despite the similarities between these conditions, the performances of several of
these biomarkers have never been studied in relation to mTBI.
Regardless of the condition, single markers have been shown to lack the specificity and
sensitivity necessary for their use as diagnostic tools in clinical settings.[4, 24] Indeed, to be a
useful biomarker, the sensitivity needs to be very high in order to safely discharge patients
without performing a CT scan. [7, 10] Furthermore, high specificity would reduce the harmful
radiation exposure and it has been shown that a 10% CT scan reduction could save $20 million
annually.[7, 18] Despite this, most mTBI biomarker research has been performed with single
biomarkers. Combining different markers into a panel has been suggested in order to increase
diagnostic performance.[1, 24] Panels have previously been shown to significantly increase
diagnostic performance in several different diseases, e.g. sleeping sickness, aneurysmal sub-
arachnoid haemorrhage and lung cancer, and in differentiating between mTBI patients and
controls.[25–31] Furthermore, it has been suggested that combinations of different clinical
parameters, such as age and even biomarker types, e.g. inflammation proteins and brain dam-
age proteins, can improve classification.[24, 31]
We hypothesized that previously discovered stroke biomarkers could, due to the similarity
in pathophysiology, be used as biomarkers also in mTBI patients. A total of 13 proteins—
H-FABP, the matrix metalloproteinases 1, 3 and 9 (MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 respectively),
the vascular and intravascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM and ICAM respectively), IL-
10, the inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), the

 oxidative stress proteins glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP), nucleoside diphosphate kinase A
(NKDA) and peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and the parkinson disease protein 7 (PARK7/DJ-1)—
were chosen.[10, 16, 23, 32–37] These proteins were investigated for their individual perfor-
mances as CT-scan triage biomarkers in mTBI patients with a GCS score of 15 and at least one
clinical symptom. The best-performing proteins were then compared with the two most stud-
ied mTBI biomarkers: S100B and GFAP. Furthermore, we hypothesized that proteins com-
bined into panels could increase the capacity to predict CT scan results.
Materials and methods
Study population
Patients were recruited from three different European sites: Geneva, Seville and Barcelona.
The study was approved by the local ethics committees: Geneva’s Human Research Ethics
Committee (CER: 12–194 / NAC 12–074); Barcelona’s Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron
Ethics Committee (PR_AG_195–2012); and Seville’s Virgen del Rocı
´o University Hospital
Institutional Review Board (2012PI/120). Prior to inclusion, written informed consent was
obtained from each patient or their legal representatives. Detailed inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria have been specified elsewhere.[10] For inclusion, patients were diagnosed with mTBI and
had a GCS score of 15 and at least one additional clinical symptom (vomiting or nausea, loss of
consciousness, amnesia, an equilibrium disorder or a headache) and age above 14 years old.
Each patient had a blood sample taken at hospital admission � 6 h post trauma and a CT scan
was performed within 24h post trauma. Exclusion criteria were no CT scan, no clinical symp-
toms, GCS score below 15, pregnancy and no signed informed consent form.
Analysis of proteins
Heparin plasma samples, collected in Geneva, and serum samples, collected in Seville and Bar-
celona, were centrifuged and stored at -80˚C. The NDKA protein was analysed using a cus-
tom-made ELISA previously described in detail elsewhere.[35] The remaining proteins were
quantified using commercial immunoassay kits (S1 Table) according to their manufacturers’
recommendations.
Statistical analysis
Due to the study population’s heterogeneity, both in terms of the samples (plasma/serum) and
assays used, biomarker results were normalised using their medians as correction factors. The
study population was divided into two larger two-centre cohorts. Cohort 1 was used for dis-
covery and verification; Cohort 2 was used for validation. Within each cohort, patients were
dichotomised into CT-negative and CT-positive groups for statistical analyses. Non-paramet-
ric tests were used hence all proteins were non-parametrically distributed, as indicated by the
Kolomogorov-Smirnov test (p < 0.05). The non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used
to establish differences between the groups, and Fisher’s exact test and the Chi-squared test
were used for statistical analyses of the clinical data. Statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS
software, version 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The performances of individual proteins
were tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using TIBCO Spotfire S+1
version 8.2 software (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Panel development
Panel experiments were performed using the Panelomix toolbox, which uses the iterative com-
bination of biomarkers and thresholds (ICBT) method.[38] In brief, Panelomix selects cut-offs

 for each biomarker or clinical parameter to create the optimal panel performance. The panels’
maximum size was set to four parameters. The panel’s performance was investigated when
sensitivity reached 100%.
Results
Single-marker performances
Cohort 1 included 132 patients, of whom 21 were CT-positive (16%). The two most common
findings detected using CT scan were subarachnoid haemorrhage (43%) and skull fracture
(38%) (Table 1). Most patients were male, had loss of consciousness or amnesia as clinical
symptoms and had an isolated brain trauma (Table 2). Falls and traffic accidents were the

 most common mechanisms of injury in both CT-positive and CT-negative patients. The only
significantly different clinical factor was age, with CT-positive patients being older than CT-
negative patients (p < 0.01).
Thirteen proteins—H-FABP, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, VCAM, ICAM, IL-10, SAA, CRP,
GSTP, NKDA, PRDX1 and DJ-1—were evaluated individually for their CT-scan result predic-
tion capacity. Analyses were performed on the first 62 patients recruited in the 132 mTBI
patients of Cohort 1, of whom were 48 CT-negative and 14 CT-positive. Among the 13 bio-
markers, only the H-FABP and IL-10 proteins were found at significantly higher levels in CT-
positive patients than in CT-negative patients (p < 0.05) (Table 3). Each protein’s individual
performance was established at 100% sensitivity, and specificity reached 33% for H-FABP and
27% for IL-10.
The best performing proteins—H-FABP and IL-10—were further compared to both S100B
and GFAP for their individual capacities to predict CT scan results across all the mTBI patients
in Cohort 1. All four proteins were found at significantly higher levels in CT-positive patients
than in CT-negative patients (p < 0.05). The S100B, IL-10 and GFAP proteins reached speci-
ficities of 11%, 22% and 31%, respectively, when sensitivity was at 100%. The best performing
protein was H-FABP; it reached 32% specificity and 100% sensitivity (Fig 1).

 Combination of markers in panels
In an attempt to increase specificity, these four proteins were further analysed when combined
in panels. All two-protein panels, except for one, showed increased specificity over the best-
performing single molecule’s performance: H-FABP’s, at 32%. The best performing panel
using two biomarkers was the combination of H-FABP and GFAP, which reached 46% speci-
ficity (Table 4 and Fig 2).
Several studies have highlighted age as a risk factor for brain lesions and, as stated above,
age was significantly different and therefore included to the combinations as an additional
parameter.[39, 40] The panel combination of a single protein and age only increased specificity
by a maximum of 3% over H-FABP alone (S2 Table). An increase in specificity was observed
when panel size was expanded. Indeed, when combining three proteins, H-FABP + GFAP
+ IL-10, specificity reached 52%, which was 6% better than the best two-parameter panel. The
best-performing panel included all four proteins, reaching a specificity of 56% at a sensitivity
of 100% (Table 4 and S2 Table).
Fig 1. The proteins performances at classifying mTBI CT-positive and CT-negative patients. Performance was
investigated at 100% sensitivity, and the specificity (dots) reached 31.5% for H-FABP (95% CI 23.4–39.6; cut-off: 1.99

mL) and 30.6% for GFAP (95% CI 22.5–39.6; cut-off: 97.31 pg/mL).

 Panel validation
Independent Cohort 2 was used for panel validation on 109 patients, of whom 17 (16%) were
CT-positive. The cohort had similar clinical data to Cohort 1, however, age was not signifi-
cantly different between CT-positive and CT-negative patients (S3 Table). At the single-
molecule performance level, when sensitivity was 100%, H-FABP remained the single best-per-
forming protein (S4 Table).
The best-performing panels found using Cohort 1, were validated using Cohort 2. The
three panels had a variation in specificity of < 4% between the two cohorts. The panel includ-
ing all four proteins only increased specificity by 2% in comparison to the best three-parameter
panel: H-FABP + GFAP + IL-10. (Table 4 and S5 Table). The most stable combination was
H-FABP and GFAP, with only 1% difference in specificity between the cohorts, ranging from
45%–46%, which was 14% higher than the performance observed with a single best molecule:
H-FABP (Fig 2).
Discussion
The present multicentre study evaluated 13 biomarkers, all previously investigated in stroke
patients, for their capacity to correctly classify CT-positive and CT-negative mTBI patients
with a GCS score of 15 and at least one clinical symptom. Among the 13 biomarkers, the
H-FABP and IL-10 proteins were the best-performing single markers, and these were then fur-
ther compared and combined with the well-studied S100B and GFAP markers. H-FABP was
the best-performing single marker, but when combined with GFAP, overall performance
increased from 32% to 46% specificity, with sensitivity at 100%.
The four proteins—S100B, GFAP, H-FABP and IL-10—have all previously been identified
for their potential to differentiate CT-positive and CT-negative mTBI patients, confirming the
results found here.[10, 16, 19, 41] The proteins have been shown to be released from or leak
out of different types of injured cells. Indeed, S100B and GFAP leak from injured astrocytes,
H-FABP leaks from endothelial cells and neuron cell bodies, whereas Il-10 is expressed by
monocytes and macrophages.[8, 11–14, 42, 43] The difficulty, for all biomarker research for
brain injuries, is to know if the measured proteins really originate from the brain injury. The
four proteins measured here have also been shown to be expressed in cells outside CNS or to
be increased after orthopaedic trauma.[2, 44–46] Previously, H-FABP performance has been
shown higher in isolated mTBI patients compared to those suffering from multiple traumas.
[10] This suggests that at least a part of the H-FABP measured originate from the CNS. Fur-
thermore, elevated levels of H-FABP in blood samples after a stroke have been shown to

 originate from the CNS.[47] The possiblity to measure the presence of brain derived H-FABP
in the blood may be, as suggested for S100B and GFAP, due to blood brain barrier damage or
through the glymphatic system.[2]
Independent of origin, single biomarkers have been indicated to not display sufficient per-
formance to be turned into diagnostic tests.[17] Combinations of markers, i.e. panels, have
been shown to increase diagnostic performance when combining proteins of diverse origins
and different pathways.[24] Diagnostic combinations created using GFAP, H-FABP, S100B
and IL-10 resulted in an efficient panel constituted of H-FABP and GFAP and reaching 46%
specificity and 100% sensitivity. The panel result was confirmed using a second, independent,
two-centre cohort. It is interesting to note that even though the individual performance of the
biomarkers varied in each cohort, the panel was found to be stable across both cohorts and it
increased specificity by 14% compared to the best single biomarker.
Combinations of biomarkers as a CT-scan triage tool have previously been shown to result

CRP and creatine kinase B type (CKBB) held an excellent AUC of 96%. However, in contrary
Fig 2. The best two-biomarker panel, combining H-FABP and GFAP, at correctly classifying mTBI CT-positive
and CT-negative patients compared to the individual best-performing protein: H-FABP. Performance was
investigated at 100% sensitivity, and the panel’s specificity reached 46% (dot, cut-off: 2 parameters, black), compared to
the best-performing single marker, H-FABP, which reached 32% specificity (triangle, cut-off: 1.99 ng/mL, grey).

 to the results shown here, the combination was presented as a model performed using a likeli-
hood ratio approach.[48] This approach highly complicated to be implemented in a clinical
setting. This strategy gives an overall probability of the combination performance without cut-
off values for each marker that indicate which patients have to be considered as CT-positive.
The panels obtained using PanelomiX have all individual cut-offs for each marker and also a
panel cut-off indicating how many of the markers need to be classified as positive in order for
the panel to be classified as positive. The use of this tool greatly increases the potential clinical
application and feasibility. It would be very interesting to investigate the combination model
proposed by Sharma et al. using the PanelomiX tool in order to compare both approaches.
The number of parameters included in a panel may vary from two to dozens. However, the
test’s cost-effectiveness must be maintained and over-fitting should be avoided. Our panel
composed of H-FABP and GFAP reached a specificity of 45%–46% with a sensitivity of 100%.
Adding a third protein was shown here to be even more efficient to avoid CT-scans. However,
the costs of measuring all the possible parameters may exceed the costs of using a CT scan to
diagnose patients with a significant brain lesion. Other large multicentre studies will be needed
to reduce the risk of overfitting and to investigate the panel’s cost-effectiveness.
Another interesting field, requiring exploration, would be the use of the panel in a point-of-
care testing (POCT) kit. POCT can greatly reduce time spent analysing and deciding, and it
can also be used closer to the patients, e.g. at local medical practices.[49] Several companies are
currently developing these kinds of tools. The panel, and potentially its corresponding POCT,
could also be interesting tools for outcome measurements. Indeed, both H-FABP and GFAP
have been shown to be predictive biomarkers for poor outcome in severe TBI patients.[37, 50]
It would, therefore, be interesting to evaluate their individual and combined prediction capaci-
ties of poor outcome in mTBI patients.
The present study had certain limitations. Patients originated from three different Euro-
pean sites and only mTBI patients with a GCS score of 15, plus one additional clinical symp-
tom, were included. These strict inclusion criteria reduced the number of CT-negative
patients, as patients with a GCS score of 15 but no symptoms were excluded from the study.
Furthermore, different samples were collected (plasma or serum), and different kits were used
to measure the proteins, depending on the cohort. These differences meant that a clear cut-off
level for each protein could not be precisely set up, and this would need additional investiga-
tion. However, the study’s results were highly reproducible from cohort to cohort, suggesting
an extremely low over-fitting bias.
Conclusion
This multicentre study showed that combining the measurement of the H-FABP and GFAP
proteins into a single panel test could be used to efficiently classify CT-positive and CT-nega-
tive patients. The panel significantly outperformed H-FABP alone, the best-performing indi-
vidual molecule, by reaching 46% specificity and 100% sensitivity. By adding IL-10 to the
panel, overall performance reached 52% specificity at 100% sensitivity.
