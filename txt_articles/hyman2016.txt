IMPORTANCE Facial fractures after motor vehicle collisions are a significant source of facial
trauma in patients seen at trauma centers. With recent changes in use of seat belts and
advances in airbag technology, new patterns in the incidence of facial fractures after motor
vehicle collisions have yet to be quantified.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of facial fractures and assess the influence of
protective device use in motor vehicle collisions in patients treated at trauma centers in the
United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using a data set from the National Trauma Data Bank,
we retrospectively assessed facial fractures in motor vehicle collisions occurring from 2007
through 2012, reported by level I, II, III, and IV trauma centers. Data analysis was performed
from March 13 to September 22, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We characterized the data set by subsite of facial injury
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes including mandible,
midface, and nasal fractures. We assessed the influence of variables such as age, sex,
race/ethnicity, crash occupant (driver or passenger), use of protective device, and presence
or suspicion of alcohol use.
RESULTS A total of 518 106 patients required assessment at a trauma center after a motor
vehicle collision, with 56 422 (10.9%) experiencing at least 1 facial fracture. Nasal fracture was
the most common facial fracture (5.6%), followed by midface (3.8%), other (3.2%), orbital
(2.6%), mandible (2.2%), and panfacial fractures (0.8%). Of the subset sustaining at least 1
facial fracture, 5.8% had airbag protection only, 26.9% used a seat belt only, and 9.3% used
both protective devices, while 57.6% used no protective device. Compared with no
protective device, the use of an airbag alone significantly reduced the likelihood of facial
fracture after a motor vehicle collision (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.86); use of a seat
belt alone had a greater effect (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.56-0.58) and use of both devices
provided the greatest odds reduction (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.45-0.48). Younger age,
male sex, and alcohol use significantly increased the likelihood of facial fracture.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For patients who presented to US trauma centers after motor
vehicle collisions between 2007 and 2012, airbags, seat belts, and the combination of the 2
devices incrementally reduced the likelihood of facial fractures.

M
otor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are a significant cause
of morbidity and mortality in the US population. Ac-
cording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration,2.31millionpeoplewereinjuredand32 719people
killed in MVCs in 2013.1 Motor vehicle collisions represent a
significant source of facial fractures treated at US trauma
centers.2,3
Airbags and seat belts are designed to decrease morbidity
and mortality in MVCs. In the United States, seat belts have
been required in vehicles for almost 50 years. Owing to more
stringent seat belt laws during the past decade, rates of seat
beltuseintheUnitedStatesincreasedfrom71%in2000to87%
in 2013.4 Although General Motors implemented airbags in the
1970s, driver-side airbags were not required in passenger cars
until 1989; dual front airbags became a requirement for cars
and small trucks in 1998.5 Since its widespread introduction,
airbag technology has continued to improve, and US law re-
quired certified advanced airbags by the production of 2007
model-yearvehicles.6Theseairbagsmeasurecrashseverityand
identify occupant seat belt status, weight, and proximity to the
airbag. Over time, older vehicles without airbags or with out-
dated airbag technology are replaced on the road with newer
vehicleswithdualfrontairbags,certifiedadvancedairbags,and
side airbags.
With regard to facial fractures in MVCs, the effect of seat
belts and airbags continues to be an area where researchers’
understanding is evolving. Studies from the 1980s through
2005 demonstrated that seat belts alone and the combina-
tion of airbags and seat belts significantly reduce the likeli-
hood of facial fractures in MVCs, although there is little evi-
dence supporting that airbags alone provide significant
protection when no seat belt is worn.5,7-11 Stacey et al12 used
the National Trauma Database (now National Trauma Data
Bank[NTDB]),toshowtheincidenceoffacialfracturesandlac-
erations in MVCs from 2000 to 2004 and the protective ef-
fects of safety device use. They found that the lack of a safety
devicewasassociatedwithanincreasedincidenceoffacialfrac-
ture in MVCs (odds ratio [OR], 2.26; 95% CI, 2.18-2.35). Since
that study, the NTDB underwent a major update in 2006 to im-
prove data quality, which provided standard definitions and
criteria for the submission of trauma data.13
Owing to the changing national pattern of seat belt use and
continued advancement of airbag technology in newer ve-
hicles, as well as the replacement of older vehicles on the road,
we expect a decreasing trend of facial fractures in MVCs and
improved protective role of protective devices. The objec-
tives of this study were to use the NTDB to evaluate the inci-
dence of facial fractures in MVCs from 2007 to 2012 and as-
sess the influence of seat belt and airbags in patients treated
at trauma centers in the United States.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed using data from the
NTDB from 2007 to 2012. The NTDB is a trauma registry con-
taining detailed trauma data submitted from more than 800
registered level I, II, III, or IV US trauma centers.14 The NTDB
is a not a population-based data set but rather is dependent
on voluntary data submissions from US trauma hospitals. Pa-
tients not admitted to the hospital, including those with mi-
nor injuries or who died before arrival, are not included in the
data set. However, patients who present to the emergency de-
partment and are subsequently discharged are included in the
data set. The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and
Public Health did not require institutional review board ap-
proval or written patient consent for analysis of this deiden-
tified database.
The database was queried for individuals 18 years or older
involved in an MVC. Next, these individuals were screened for
facial fractures according to the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes representing fractures
ofthemandible(codes802.20-802.39),maxillaormalar(codes
802.4-802.5), orbital floor (codes 802.6-802.7), nasal bones
(codes 802.0-802.1), or fracture of other facial bone (codes
802.8-802.9). Patients with multiple ICD-9 codes represent-
ingmultiplefractureswereincludedineachcategoryforanaly-
sis. We defined a panfacial fracture as any patient with both a
mandible fracture and midface fracture, where a midface frac-
ture includes a malar or maxillary fracture, orbital floor frac-
ture,orboth.OwingtothelimitationsoftheICD-9system,frac-
tures of the upper one-third of the facial skeleton as well as
the skull base could not be categorized separately, and may be
included with fracture of other facial bone (codes 802.8-
802.9) or with other nonspecific trauma codes. Facial lacera-
tion ICD-9 codes were not included.
Patient demographics and characteristics analyzed were
age, sex, race/ethnicity, crash occupant (driver or passenger),
use of protective device, and presence or suspicion of alcohol
use. Protective device use was categorized as no device, air-
bagalone,seatbeltalone,andbothdevices.Race/ethnicitywas
categorized as white, Native American, Hispanic, black, Asian,
or other.
Finally, all patients with facial fracture after MVC were
stratified by overall injury severity. We used the Injury Sever-
ity Score (ISS), a standardized system for trauma patients with
multipleinjurieswithscoresassignedfor6bodyregions(head,
face, chest, abdomen, extremities [including pelvis], and ex-
ternal), to analyze if the effects of protective devices were sig-
nificant in both minor and major traumatic injuries.15
Key Points
Question What is the current incidence of facial fractures after
motor vehicle collisions in patients treated at US trauma centers
and what is the influence of protective devices?
Findings From 2007 to 2012, the incidence of at least 1 facial
fracture was 10.9%; use of airbags, seat belts, and the combination
of the 2 devices incrementally reduced the likelihood of a facial
fracture.
Meaning Approximately 11% of patients who present to a US
trauma center after a motor vehicle collision have at least 1 facial
fracture; airbags and seat belts are significantly protective against
such fractures.

Data analysis was performed from March 13 to Septem-
ber 22, 2015. We examined differences in characteristics be-
tween patients who did or did not sustain a facial fracture af-
ter an MVC using t tests and χ2 tests. The overall incidence of
different types of facial fractures and use of protective de-
vices across the study period were tabulated.
To evaluate the effects of the different variables on the 3
events (any facial fracture, panfacial fracture, and nasal frac-
ture), we used a multivariable logistic regression analysis using
PROC LOGISTIC in SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). The ORs
and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated. P < .05 was con-
sidered significant. Patients were stratified for ISS less than 9,
between 9 and less than 16, between 16 and less than 25, and
25 or more, and ORs for any facial fracture were recalculated
within each ISS subset.
Results
In the NTDB data set from 2007 to 2012, a total of 518 106 in-
dividuals were involved in an MVC and required assessment
at a level I-IV trauma center. Of those individuals, 56 422 sus-
tained a facial fracture (10.9%). Nasal fracture was the most
common facial fracture (5.6%), followed by midface (3.8%),
other (3.2%), orbital (2.6%), mandible (2.2%), and panfacial
fractures (0.8%).
Of the patients who presented after MVCs, 5.1% had air-
bag deployment only, 36.3% used a seat belt without airbag de-
ployment, and 15.5% used both, while 42.6% used no device
and it was not known what device 0.5% used. Of the subset
sustaining a facial fracture, 5.8% had airbag deployment only,
26.9% used a seat belt only, and 9.3% used both, while 57.6%
used no device and it was not known what device 0.4%
used. For those with panfacial trauma, 4.8% had airbag de-
ploymentonly,22.9%usedaseatbeltonly,and6.8%usedboth,
while 64.9% used no device and it was not known what de-
vice 0.6% used. The frequency of no protective device use was
higher in both the panfacial fracture cohort and the any facial
fracture cohort compared with the entire cohort of individu-
als involved in MVCs.
Demographics of the cohorts with and without facial
fracture showed statistical differences in regards to age, sex,
race/ethnicity, use of protective devices, and use of alcohol
(Table 1). Those with facial fracture were younger than those
without facial fracture (mean [SD] age, 37.5 [27.0] vs 41.2
[18.8] years; P < .001) and more likely to be male (68.3% vs
57.2%; P < .001) and use alcohol (31.8% vs 20.4%; P < .001).
Those with facial fracture and those without were drivers of
the collisions in nearly equal amounts (75.9% vs 75.8%,
respectively; P = .49). Individuals with facial fracture were
more likely to have not used a protective device (57.6% vs
40.7%; P < .001), and the combination of seat belts with air-
bags was significantly less frequent among those with facial
fracture (9.3% vs 16.3%; P < .001).

of protective devices was analyzed with multivariable logistic
regression to determine the likelihood of facial fractures in in-
dividuals experiencing MVCs. Individuals for whom the type
ofprotectivedeviceusedwasunknownwereexcludedfromfur-
ther analysis. For any facial fracture, when adjusted for other
variables, male sex (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.36-1.42; P < .05) and al-
cohol use (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.43-1.49; P < .05) were associated
with increased likelihood of facial fracture (Table 2). Use of air-

facial fractures, similar statistically significant findings were
observed, but with a greater magnitude of odds reduction, by
airbags alone (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.72; P < .05), seat belts
alone (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.44-0.51; P < .05), and the combina-
tion (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.30-0.39; P < .05).
The same trends were observed in patients with nasal frac-
tures (Table 2). The odds reduction seen with airbags alone
(OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98; P < .05) was smaller than that
observed for patients with any facial fracture or with panfa-
cial fracture, but showed a similar pattern of reduced likeli-
hood with seat belt alone (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.61-0.64; P < .05)

ger seat occupancy significantly decreased the likelihood of

Patients with facial fracture after an MVC were stratified in
the NTDB from minor to major injuries by ISS. The mean (SD)
ISSforpatientswithfacialfractureafteranMVCwas28.8(18.2),
where 0 is no injury and 75 is a fatal injury. A total of 14.9% of

tients with facial fracture, multivariable analysis was per-
formed independently for each severity level of total body in-
jury, confirming the trends identified in facial fractures after
MVCs. Male sex and alcohol use were associated with in-
creased likelihood of facial fracture, while older age and use of

tive devices on facial fractures in individuals presenting to US
trauma centers after MVCs. We hypothesized that with re-
cent changes in seat belt legislation and airbag design, the in-
cidence of use of airbags alone, use of seat belts alone, and use
of the 2 devices together has changed.
In this study cohort, the patients with facial fracture
were significantly more likely to be younger, male, not using
protective devices, and under the influence of alcohol. The
findings reflect MVCs with injuries significant enough to war-
rant evaluation at a level I to IV trauma center, in the most
recent era.
The incidence of facial fracture after MVCs from 2007 to
2012 is 10.9%, which reflects the proportion of facial frac-
tures that may be encountered in patients involved in an MVC
who then present to a US level I to IV trauma center. Although
this incidence of facial fractures is substantially higher than
the 5.6% reported by Stacey et al12 using NTDB data from 2000
to 2004, their analysis excluded nasal fractures. If we ex-
clude nasal fractures in our study, the incidence of nonnasal
facial fractures is 5.3%, which closely approximates that found
by Stacey et al.
Use of protective devices was less common among pa-
tients with facial fracture. Compared with all individuals in
MVCs who presented to trauma centers and with the cohort
without facial fractures, those with any facial fracture had a
higher incidence of no use protective devices (42.6%, 40.7%,
and57.6%,respectively).Althoughuseofairbagalonewassimi-
lar among the 3 cohorts (5.1%, 5.0%, and 5.8%, respectively),
patients with any facial fracture showed less use of seat belts
(36.3%,37.4%,and26.9%,respectively)andlessfrequentcom-
bined use of both devices (15.5%, 16.3%, and 9.3%, respec-
tively). This trend was more pronounced among patients with
panfacial fractures. This pattern in use of protective devices
is comparable with that in the study by Stacey et al,12 in which
the facial fracture cohort had a higher incidence of no re-
straint use compared with all individuals in MVCs (59% vs
45%), a lower incidence of use of a seat belt only (31% vs 41%),
seat belt plus airbag (6% vs 10%), and an equal incidence of
use of airbag only (4% vs 4%).
The use of airbag alone significantly reduced the likeli-
hood of sustaining any facial fracture by 18% compared with
using no protective device, use of a seat belt alone decreased
the likelihood by 43%, and the combination of seat belt and
airbag decreased the likelihood by 53% (P < .05). Although the
protectivebenefitofseatbeltaloneandthecombinationofseat
belt and airbag have been well described in the literature, to
our knowledge, the protective benefit of airbags alone in pre-
venting facial fractures has been found to be statistically sig-
nificant only once in a study by Cormier and Duma,16 who used
National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data
System data from 1993 to 2007 to demonstrate that airbags
alone were significantly protective.
Improvements in airbag technology may explain the pro-
tective benefit of airbags alone. Other studies have examined
the use of airbags between 1991 and 2005. First-generation
front airbags were designed for an impact of any speed up to

30 miles per hour into a fixed rigid barrier perpendicular to the
line of travel of the vehicle with adult men in the 50th per-
centile for size who were both using a seat belt and not using
a seat belt. It was not until the mid-1990s to late 1990s, owing
toconcernaboutairbag-relateddeathsfrominflationforce,that
legislationwasrelaxedwiththeintroductionofdepoweredair-
bags in 1998.17 Finally, owing to a legislative push in 2000 for
more sophisticated front airbags by 2007, new certified ad-
vanced airbags began to appear and became a requirement by
2007. Certified advanced airbags carefully tailor deployment
according to sensors that account for severity of impact, use
of seat belt, and size of the occupant of the seat.6 As our data
set examined trends in facial fractures from 2007 to 2012, it
is possible that the implementation of certified advanced air-
bags, as well as the scrapping of cars with older airbag sys-
tems accounts for the protective effect of airbags alone and
when used in combination with seat belts.
The most common fracture after an MVC was the nasal
bone, followed by midface fractures. Nasal bone fractures are
consistently the most common facial fracture seen after MVCs
in the literature.9,18 Restraint devices and, to a greater extent,
airbags were far less protective regarding the diagnosis of
nasal bone fracture after MVC compared with general facial
fracture.Anairbagalonedecreasedthelikelihoodofnasalfrac-
tures by only 7%. The nasal bone is the most projected por-
tion of the face and it has been demonstrated that far less force
is required to fracture the nasal bones compared with the sur-
rounding facial bones.19 In frontal collisions, without the de-
crease in forward velocity provided by seat belts, the impact
with the airbag may still produce enough force to cause a na-
sal fracture. However, airbags alone were still significantly pro-
tective against nasal fractures compared with no safety de-
vice. Passenger seat occupancy was protective against nasal
fracturescomparedwithdriverseatoccupancy,apatternfound
only with nasal fractures. The steering wheel is a recognized
source of facial fractures, even when accounting for use of pro-
tective devices, compared with the A-pillar (which holds either
side of the windshield in place) or dashboard.18 It is likely that
driver impact with the steering wheel and the lower force
neededtocauseanasalfractureaccountsforthispattern.How-
ever, there was still an odds reduction with all protective de-
vices, even in the driver seat.
Afteraccountingforuseofprotectivedevices,youngerage,
male sex, and alcohol use independently increased the likeli-
hood of facial fracture. These factors also increase the overall
incidence of MVCs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration found recognition error from inattention and dis-
traction, decision error such as driving too fast for condi-
tions,andperformanceerrorsuchasovercompensationorpoor
directional control as factors that influence the likelihood of
anMVC.20Sucherrorshavebeenshownmorelikelytobemade
by younger, inexperienced, inebriated, and male drivers.21 The
NTDB data do not indicate speed or type of collision, factors
that may increase the incidence of MVCs in younger, male, or
inebriated drivers.
Analysis of ISS was performed to serve as a proxy mea-
sure of accident severity. Higher ISS representing major inju-
ries likely represent more severe collisions. Injury severity
scores were widely distributed across the facial fracture co-
hort, suggesting a range of accident severity. Across the range
of accident severities, all combinations of protective devices
significantly decreased the likelihood of facial fractures. This
finding suggests that airbags, seat belts, and the combination
of the 2 devices decrease the likelihood of facial fracture for
both minor accidents and major collisions.
A strength of this study is the representative sample size.
TheNTDBisthelargesttraumadatabaseandincludesdatafrom
levelItoIVtraumacentersacrosstheUnitedStates.Thus,com-
pared with regional or state trauma databases that may be in-
fluenced by local prehospital care systems, state seat belt
laws,andvariationofageofvehicles,theNTDBresultsaremore
generalizableacrosstheUnitedStates.AlthoughtheNTDBdata
does not provide crash details seen in other smaller data-
bases, it does provide the largest sample size.
There are limitations to the NTDB, such as yearly changes
in participating institutions. The number of reporting institu-
tions varies by year, making year-to-year comparisons impre-
cise and methodologically challenged. Despite the possibil-
ity of sampling error, there was an increased incidence in seat
belt use (alone or combined), airbag use (alone or combined),
and both in individuals who presented after MVC during the
study years (Figure). This finding is striking because the fre-
quency of facial fracture in the cohort shows a slight decrease
from 10.7% to 10.5% during the same years. These data do not
necessarily reflect generalizable results and may be owing to
sampling or reporting differences in each reporting year. Fur-
ther investigation is necessary to determine the significance
of increasing seat belt use and airbag use within the NTDB data
while facial fracture incidence remained stable or decreased
slightly during the same period.
Another limitation is the constrained crash variables in-
cluded in the NTDB. Factors such as speed or type of collision,
consistentreportingofsideairbagdeployment,andvehicletype
are not included in the registry. Despite these limitations, the

The trend demonstrates increased use of protective devices during 2007-2012
with stable to slightly decreased incidence of facial fractures. These data do not
necessarily reflect generalizable results and may be owing to sampling or
reporting differences in each reporting year.

incidence of facial fractures in MVCs and trends identified can
be considered strongly applicable to a patient who presents to
any US trauma center after experiencing an MVC.
Conclusions
The incidence of facial fracture from MVCs in individuals who
present to trauma centers in the United States was 10.9%, with
nasal fractures being the most common fracture type, fol-
lowed by midface fractures. Airbags, seat belts, and the com-
bination of the 2 devices incrementally reduce the likelihood
of facial fracture compared with no protective device. This
trend may be owing to recent advances in airbag technology
during the last 10 to 15 years. Younger age, male sex, and the
use of alcohol also increase the likelihood of facial fracture in
MVCs. Not only has airbag deployment increased in patients
who present to trauma centers after MVCs but airbags also ap-
pear to provide significant protection against facial fractures
when deployed without seat belts.
