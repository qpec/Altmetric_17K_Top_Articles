Abstract Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a
syndrome of cyclic vomiting associated with cannabis
use. Our objective is to summarize the available evidence
on CHS diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. We
performed a systematic review using MEDLINE, Ovid
MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Library from January 2000 through September 24, 2015.
Articles eligible for inclusion were evaluated using the
Grading and Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Data
were abstracted from the articles and case reports and
were combined in a cumulative synthesis. The frequency
of identified diagnostic characteristics was calculated
from the cumulative synthesis and evidence for patho-
physiologic hypothesis as well as treatment options were
evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The systematic
search returned 2178 articles. After duplicates were
removed, 1253 abstracts were reviewed and 183 were in-
cluded. Fourteen diagnostic characteristics were identi-
fied, and the frequency of major characteristics was as
follows: history of regular cannabis for any duration of
time (100%), cyclic nausea and vomiting (100%), resolu-
tion of symptoms after stopping cannabis (96.8%), com-
pulsive hot baths with symptom relief (92.3%), male pre-
dominance (72.9%), abdominal pain (85.1%), and at least
weekly cannabis use (97.4%). The pathophysiology of
CHS remains unclear with a dearth of research dedicated
to investigating its underlying mechanism. Supportive
care with intravenous fluids, dopamine antagonists, topi-
cal capsaicin cream, and avoidance of narcotic medica-
tions has shown some benefit in the acute setting.
Cannabis cessation appears to be the best treatment.

Introduction
The United Nations reported that 277 million people world-
wide have used cannabis—roughly 4.9% of the total popula-
tion [1]. In 2014, 22.2 million Americans aged 12 or older
(8.4% of the population) were current cannabis users [2].
Cannabis policy in the USA is undergoing a transformation;
following the 2016 elections, 26 states and Washington D.C.
currently have laws legalizing cannabis in some form, and

 three other states are soon to adopt legislation. Seven states
and Washington D.C. now allow some form of recreational
use [3] . Cannabis has been approved for treatment of a range
of medical conditions including nausea and vomiting due to
chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic pain, spasticity due to
multiple sclerosis, depression, and many more [4] depending
upon state laws. Adverse effects from cannabis, from both
recreational and medical use, have been reported for decades,
though reports have increased with increased cannabis access
[5]. Among the more common adverse effects is the cannabi-
noid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), first reported in 2004 [6].
CHS is a syndrome of cyclic vomiting in the setting of chron-
ic, high-dose cannabis use that is frequently associated with
compulsive hot baths/showers, used in attempt to control
symptoms.
Patients with CHS present frequently to various health care
settings with intractable nausea and vomiting. These patients
often undergo expensive medical testing, may require hospital
admission for symptom management, and often experience sig-
nificant delays in diagnosis [7]. CHS is under-recognized due to
a combination of factors including the paradoxical use for treat-
ment of nausea and vomiting, the stigma associated with can-
nabis use, and the illegal status of cannabis in many regions
leading to under-reporting of use. The frequency of emergency
department visits and high rates of hospital admission for CHS
exemplify the difficulty in symptom management. The lack of
knowledge and treatment recommendations regarding CHS
compounds this issue. Subsequently, CHS is a costly illness
to manage. In an observational study of CHS patients followed
over 2 years, the median charge for ED visits and hospital
admissions was $95,023 (IQR = $62,420–$268,110) [7].
Cannabis has presumably been used by humans for
thousands of years, [8] yet CHS is only now being recog-
nized. CHS has been reported numerous times in [9–11]
large case series, small case series, and more than 80
individual case reports [6, 8, 11–82]. There are many sug-
gested pathophysiologic mechanisms of CHS, though ev-
idence for each is minimal (see Table 3). It is not clear
why cannabis appears to suppress emesis under certain
circumstances and induces it in others. It is also unknown
why only some individuals develop CHS when the use of
cannabis is so widespread.
Given the relatively new recognition of CHS as a clinical
syndrome, diagnosis and treatment practices vary widely.
Many authors have proposed diagnostic criteria (see
Table 7), but it is unclear if these criteria consistently capture
patients with the diagnosis. Additionally, criteria vary signif-
icantly, which may contribute to diagnostic uncertainty among
providers. Therefore, our objectives are to summarize and
evaluate the available scientific evidence on CHS diagnosis,
pathophysiology, and treatment utilizing systematic literature
review methodology.
Materials and Methods
Search Strategy
The systematic review was performed utilizing the PRISMA
guidelines [83]. Relevant publications were identified by
searching the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed,
Ovid MEDLINE (1946-current), Ovid MEDLINE In-Process
& Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Ovid MEDLINE Daily),
Embase (via Embase.com), Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Library (via Wiley Online Library). Publication date was
limited from January 2000 through articles indexed in the
databases as of September 24, 2015. English language limits
were applied, and human and animal studies were included.
Multiple subject headings (including Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms in MEDLINE and Emtree terms in
Embase) and text words were used to identify each concept
(cannabinoids and hyperemesis) and develop the search strat-
egies (see Appendix for a list of all database search strategies).
Additional records were identified through the following
sources: ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses
(which includes COS Conference Papers Index; ProQuest
Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland; ProQuest
Dissertations & Theses A&I), and conference proceedings
and meeting abstracts available online since 2000 from
North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology, American
Academy of Clinical Toxicology, American College of
Medical Toxicology, and Society for Academic Emergency
Medicine. The references of included studies were cross-ref-
erenced, and additional studies not identified by the initial
search strategy were added. The references of included studies
were cross-referenced, and additional studies not identified by
the initial search strategy were added.
Study Selection
Two reviewers (CS and AM) independently reviewed all titles
generated by the search to identify potentially relevant articles.
Duplicates were removed. Articles that were clearly not rele-
vant based on title and abstract were excluded. The full text of
all relevant articles were obtained and reviewed. The articles
were then segregated into diagnosis, pathophysiology, or
treatment categories. The articles were eligible for inclusion
under the category of Bdiagnosis^ if they (1) directly studied
the criteria used to diagnose CHS from a population or case-
based perspective or (2) presented a specific set of diagnostic
criteria to define CHS as part of a larger research question or
(3) presented a case or cases of CHS and explained the diag-
nostic criteria used to identify these patients. Articles eligible
for inclusion under the category of Bpathophysiology^ were
those that (1) used animal, human, or in vitro models to ex-
plore the pathophysiology of CHS or cyclic vomiting or (2)
animal or human studies that investigated the role of the
72
J. Med. Toxicol. (2017) 13:71–87
 endocannabinoid system in vomiting. Articles eligible for in-
clusion under the category of Btreatment^ were those that (1)
presented results of treatment outcomes using specific inter-
ventions, both behavioral and pharmacologic, to manage CHS
or (2) used animal studies to evaluate treatments for CHS or
cyclic vomiting. When the two reviewers disagreed on article
eligibility, a consensus was reached through discussion.
Data Collection
The reviewers assigned each included article to nonexclusive
groups of diagnosis, pathophysiology, or treatment. Relevant
study characteristics were abstracted including study design
and primary findings.
The following data, when available, were extracted from
each case report or case series: sample size, gender, age at
presentation, age of first cannabis use, age at CHS symptom
onset, duration and frequency of cannabis use, presence of
cyclic vomiting, presence of abdominal pain, weight loss,
presence of compulsive hot baths/showers, response to trial
of abstinence, time to improvement of symptoms with absti-
nence, and amount of weight loss, if present.
Reviewers identified hypotheses to explain the pathophys-
iology of CHS. For each mechanism proposed, reviewers ex-
plored the supportive evidence and the study design.
Similarly, reviewers identified treatment modalities pro-
posed for CHS. For each treatment modality, reviewers ex-
plored the evidence and the study design.
Assessment of Study Quality
The strength and quality of each study were evaluated
using the GRADE working group metrics [83]. Grading
and Recommendations Assessment, Development, and
Evaluation (GRADE) defines high-quality studies as ran-
domized trials or double-upgraded observational studies.
Moderate-quality studies are defined as downgraded ran-
domized trials or upgraded observational studies. Low-
quality studies are defined as double-downgraded ran-
domized trials or observational studies. Very low-quality
studies are defined as triple-downgraded randomized trials
or downgraded observational studies or case series/case
reports.
The quality of evidence for each main outcome of this
systematic review was evaluated using the GRADE working
group metrics [83]. High-quality outcomes are defined as
those for which further research is very unlikely to change
our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate-quality out-
comes are defined as those for which further research is likely
to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate
of effect and may change the estimate. Low-quality outcomes
are those for which further research is very likely to have an
important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect
and is likely to change the estimate. Very low-quality out-
comes are those for which any estimate of effect is very
uncertain.
Data Analysis
Data were extracted from individual case reports and summa-
rized as a single large cohort (individual case report synthesis).
Next, after exclusion of duplicate cases, the individual case
reports were combined with data from the case series and
summarized as a single larger cohort (cumulative synthesis).
Median values (plus interquartile range) were calculated for
age at diagnosis, cannabis use age of onset, and age at symp-
tom onset. The duration of cannabis use prior to symptom
onset was categorized as either less than or equal to 1, 2 to
5, 6 to 10, and greater than 11 years. The amount of cannabis
consumed was categorized as either less than daily, daily,
weekly, less than weekly, or dose not specified. Cannabis
use reported as Bheavy^ was interpreted to mean Bdaily.^
Cannabis use reported as Bfrequent^ was interpreted to mean
Bweekly.^ The presence of cyclic vomiting, abdominal pain,
relief with compulsive hot baths/showers, relief with absti-
nence, and ongoing symptoms with ongoing cannabis use
was determined from each article and summarized as percent-
ages of the total number of patients where the specific symp-
tom category was documented.
The frequency of each individual proposed diagnostic char-
acteristic was calculated by dividing the total number of CHS
patients manifesting that characteristic (from the cumulative
synthesis) by the total number of patients for which that diag-
nostic characteristic was reported.
Results
The systematic search returned 2154 articles. Twenty-four ad-
ditional articles were identified through the bibliographies of
articles returned in the primary search. After removal of du-
plicates, 1253 abstracts were independently screened by re-
viewers, of which 170 satisfied criteria for inclusion. The low
quality of the articles precluded meta-analysis.
There was a significant overlap in the sorting of articles
into the categories of diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treat-
ment. Thus, some articles were classified in more than one
category. We identified 116 articles related to diagnosis, 61
to pathophysiology, and 13 to treatment. There were 24 ani-
mal studies related to pathophysiology [84–107]. No animal
studies were identified that addressed diagnosis or treatment.
There were 88 case reports and 8 case series of four or more
patients. Of the 88 case reports, 8 were excluded secondary to
inability to access the original text, the report being published
in a non-English language or if the case did not ultimately
yield a clinical diagnosis of CHS as reported by the authors

 [108–118]. Our search did not yield any randomized trials
assessing the diagnosis, pathophysiology, or treatment of
CHS. Given that evidence statements are based primarily on
case reports and case series, the vast majority of evidence is
considered limited. Therefore, limited evidence ratings should
not be misconstrued as negative clinical findings but, rather,
that there are no higher-level studies to qualify the statement
as higher-level evidence. The primary findings for each cate-
gory are summarized in the following sections.
Diagnosis of CHS
Seven unique diagnostic frameworks were identified [6, 9, 30,
51, 119–121]. There was a significant overlap among major
diagnostic characteristics between the authors. The major di-
agnostic characteristics and frequency of each are as follows:
history of regular cannabis use for over 1 year (74.8%), severe
nausea and vomiting (100%), vomiting that recurs in a cyclic
pattern over months (100%), resolution of symptoms after
stopping cannabis (96.8%), compulsive hot baths/showers
with symptom relief (92.3%), male predominance (72.9%),
abdominal pain (85.1%), at least weekly cannabis use
(97.4%), history of daily cannabis use (76.6%), and age less
than 50 at time of evaluation (100%) (see Table 2). The fol-
lowing symptoms were inconsistently captured, and thus, their
frequency could not be determined: reliable return of symp-
toms within weeks of resuming use, normal bowel habits,
negative medical workup, and weight loss >5 kg (see table 2).
Cumulative Synthesis
The cumulative synthesis represents data from the individual
case report synthesis as well as the case series, excluding
duplicate cases (Table 1) [6, 8, 11–82]. In the cumulative
synthesis, 211 individual patients are represented. Secondary
to heterogeneity across studies and incomplete reporting, not
all diagnostic characteristics were reported for each patient.
There were 154 males (72.9%) and 57 females (27.1%). The
median age at diagnosis was 28 years (IQR = 22–34)
(n = 111). The median age of onset of cannabis use was 16
(IQR = 14–18) (n = 84). The median age at symptom onset
was 24 (IQR = 19–29) (n = 101). In all cases, the use of
cannabis predated the onset of CHS symptoms. The duration
of cannabis use prior to onset of symptoms for the 179 patients
in which it was captured was as follows: 45 patients (25.1%)
used it for ≤1 year, 65 patients (36.3%) used it for 2–5 years,
30 patients (16.8%) used it for 6–10 years, and 39 patients
(21.8%) it used for ≥11 years. The frequency of cannabis use
was reported in 211 patients as follows: 50 (23.7%) used
greater than daily, 101 (47.9%) used daily, 41 (19.4%) used
weekly, 5 (2.4%) used less than once per week, and in 14
(6.6%), the quantity was not specified (see Fig. 1). Cyclic
nausea and vomiting was reported in 100% of patients.
Abdominal pain was reported in 85.1% of cases. Relief of
symptoms with compulsive hot baths/showers was reported
in 92.3% of cases (n = 170).
The cumulative synthesis identified two potentially novel
diagnostic characteristics for CHS. The median age of onset of
cannabis use was 16 (IQR = 14–18) (age of onset reported in
84/211 cases), suggesting that many patients who develop
CHS begin their cannabis use early in life. Additionally, the
median age of symptom onset was found to be 24 (IQR = 19–
29) (age of symptom onset reported in 101/211 cases).
Underreporting of this clinical characteristic limits its gener-
alizability and should be considered as supporting the diagno-
sis if present, although should not preclude the diagnosis.
The synthesis also highlights the difficulty of diagnosis, as
the mean delay of symptom onset to diagnosis of CHS was
4.1 years (SD = 4.6).
Our results suggest that the following individual diagnostic
characteristics have the highest sensitivity for identifying pa-
tients with CHS: at least weekly cannabis use for greater than
50 (23.7%)

pattern over months and that is usually accompanied by ab-
dominal pain, resolution of symptoms after stopping cannabis,
and compulsive hot baths/showers with symptom relief
(Table 2).
Pathophysiology of CHS
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the patho-
physiology of CHS (Table 3); however, the GRADE quality
of evidence to support any of the proposed mechanisms was
very low. Some data suggest that CHS is caused by dysregu-
lation of the endocannabinoid system, a group of endogenous
cannabinoid receptors (CB-1 and CB-2) located in the brain,
gastrointestinal tract, peripheral nervous system, and immune
system of mammals [122]. The endocannabinoid system is
thought to play a role in gastrointestinal motility [123, 124]
appetite [125], nausea/vomiting [126], inflammation [127],
mood [128], sleep [129], pain [130], and more. There was
very limited evidence that the emetogenic and anti-emetic
effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its analogs
are mediated through CB-1 receptors (CB1r) and thus underlie
the syndrome of CHS, though this mechanism is the most
parsimonious and is supported by both animal and in vitro
studies [88, 106]. We found very limited evidence to support
the theory that a genetic variation in metabolic enzymes ac-
counts for the appearance of CHS symptomatology; however,
this theory is attractive in that it may explain why some, but
not all, chronic cannabis users develop CHS [131]. There is
also some evidence to suggest that cannabinoids interact
directly with CB-1 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and
alter gastrointestinal motility [16, 92, 95, 132–134]. Animal
studies lend some credibility to this theory; however, results
are not consistently reproducible in human studies.
Additionally, many inferential hypotheses were identified that
attribute different aspects of CHS to a myriad of dysregulatory
issues at CB-1 receptors throughout the body (brain, gastroin-
testinal tract, and vasculature) [97, 98, 102, 105, 133,
135–137]. The experimental evidence behind these inferences
illustrates the complexity of the pathophysiology of CHS and
raises many additional questions. Other hypotheses were iden-
tified, but the data to support them were so limited as to not
warrant discussion in this review [57, 84–87, 89, 91, 99–105,
107, 122, 126, 138–165].
The pathophysiology of CHS is unclear secondary to a
dearth of research dedicated to explicitly investigating its un-
derlying mechanism. Nevertheless, some limited evidence
suggests a dynamic interplay between cannabinoid metabo-
lism and complex pharmacodynamics at the CB-1 receptor.
Limited evidence also suggests that an individual’s genetics,
as well as variability in the cannabinoid components of indi-
vidual plants [131], may play a role in the manifestation of
CHS.
Treatment of CHS
The only definitive treatment identified for CHS was absti-
nence (low GRADE quality of evidence). Several studies
demonstrated this effect. Wallace et al. reported that among
25 patients with CHS who abstained, 24 had complete

 symptom resolution [10]. Similarly, Allen et al., Simonetto
et al., Patterson et al., and Soriano-Co et al. reported symptom
resolution in seven out of seven [6], six out of six [9], four out
of four [11], and four out of five [12] patients, respectively.
The cumulative synthesis (see Table 1) demonstrated that
among 64 patients with documented cannabis cessation, 62
(96.8%) had complete resolution of symptoms. The two pa-
tients who reported no resolution of symptoms did not have
urine testing performed to confirm abstinence [8, 56]. Among
21 patients who did not abstain, all had ongoing symptoms.
There has been limited research into the supportive and
symptomatic care of CHS patients. Secondary to intractable
vomiting and high-temperature baths/showers, patients may
present with moderate to severe dehydration and acute renal
failure requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation [20, 30, 38,
166]. In regard to symptomatic care, there is very limited
evidence to support the use of dopamine antagonists [40,
167]. For example, Hickey et al. reported complete resolution
of emesis 1 h after administration of 5 mg haloperidol to a
CHS patient with intractable vomiting [40]. Δ9-THC has
been shown to increase dopamine synthesis, turnover, efflux,
and dopamine cell firing [103], which may explain clinical
improvement with haloperidol treatment. There is also some
limited evidence to support the use of capsaicin cream to treat
the symptoms of CHS. In a case series of five patients,
LaPoint et al. reported complete resolution of nausea and eme-
sis in all patients after application of topical capsaicin cream to
the abdomen [168]. Similar positive responses are document-
ed elsewhere [169]. The authors suggest that capsaicin may
exert its effects via the TRVP-1 receptor, capsaicin’s only
known receptor, which is known to interact with the
endocannabinoid system [169]. Some authors recommend
the avoidance of narcotic pain medication in the treatment of
CHS as opioid analgesic use is associated with bowel dys-
function and could theoretically worsen CHS symptoms and
additionally create opioid dependence [170] (see Table 5 for a
summary of treatments and associated data to support each
modality).
Cannabis cessation appears to be the best treatment.
Supportive care in the form of intravenous hydration and
anti-emetics may be necessary secondary to profound dehy-
dration and acute renal failure. Very limited evidence suggests
that dopamine antagonist medications and the application of
capsaicin cream to the abdomen may be helpful strategies to
manage acute symptoms. Though there is not any direct evi-
dence, avoidance of narcotic pain medication may be useful
due to the possibility of worsening symptoms and creating
dependence.
Limitations
This study is limited by the heterogeneity of the case series
and case reports and the lack of controlled studies examining
this syndrome. While case reports and case series demonstrate
a consistent syndrome characterized by heavy cannabis use
and relief of symptoms with hot showers, there is inherent
publication bias; clinicians are more likely to report cases
consistent with the initially reported index case. The internal

The emetogenic and anti-emetic effects of Δ9-THC and its analogs are mediated through CB-1

 validity of our findings is limited by the possibility of missing
articles from our search strategy. We limited the search to
English-language articles, so any relevant articles published
in foreign languages were not included, and articles not
indexed in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, or the
Cochrane Library would be missed. Second, due to lack of
diagnostic criteria, there was significant heterogeneity in the
reporting of patient characteristics for the case series and case
reports, resulting in limited data for several of the diagnostic
characteristics analyzed. Therefore, the presented diagnostic
frequency is reflective only of reported criteria and low fre-
quency may simply be a reflection of failure to report the item.
Therefore, the proposed criteria need validation in a prospec-
tive cohort. Third, reporting of cannabis use patterns was sub-
jective with variable metrics (cones, bongs, joints, cigarettes,
grams/day etc.) resulting in possible lack of accuracy for this
statistic. Fourth, there was limited reporting of effective treat-
ment modalities for CHS, and publication bias favors
reporting of successful treatments rather than ineffective ther-
apies. For instance, one Colorado cannabis prescriber anec-
dotally reports two cases in which patients developed symp-
toms consistent with CHS after the patients switched to a
different cannabis product. Their symptoms subsequently re-
solved when they switched back to their original brand. This
information is not published but raises questions regarding the
role of an unidentified molecule, whether cannabinoid or non-
cannabinoid (e.g., a pesticide) may precipitate of the syn-
drome. In practice, clinicians may have evolved treatment
algorithms for managing CHS patients, but our search did
not identify any studies reporting this.
Discussion
There is a large body of literature describing the diagnosis,
pathophysiology, and treatment of CHS. However, most of the
evidence is considered low quality because it is in the form of
case reports and case series. When these reports are combined,
a larger and more robust set of diagnostic characteristics, eval-
uation of pathophysiology, and determination of effective
treatments can be generated. Based on our knowledge of
211 unique CHS patients, the following characteristics are
associated with the syndrome: (1) severe cyclic vomiting that
is usually accompanied with abdominal pain, (2) symptom
onset preceded by at least weekly cannabis use, (3) temporary
relief of symptoms with compulsive hot baths/showers, (4)
resolution of symptoms with cessation of cannabis use, (5)
onset of cannabis use in the teenage years, and (6) symptom
onset in the third decade of life. While not all these criteria
must be met to make the diagnosis, of 133 cases for which raw
data were available, 85 met at least four criteria (75.2%) and
104 (92%) met at least three criteria. Secondary to incomplete
and inconsistent reporting of the proposed diagnostic
characteristics in the case report literature, the aforementioned
data may be an underestimate of the actual occurrence of these
symptoms in CHS patients.
CHS shares many clinical similarities with cyclic vomiting
syndrome (CVS), a functional gastrointestinal disorder. A di-
agnostic dilemma arises when CVS patients concurrently use
cannabis, as it can be difficult to discern if the true underlying
disorder is CHS or CVS that is being symptomatically man-
aged with cannabis. Several studies were identified in our
search that attempted to isolate and diagnose CHS patients
among cohorts of CVS patients and deserve special mention
[171–173]. The Rome criteria were developed by an interna-
tional committee of experts in order to delineate and standard-
ize the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorders [174].
The Rome III diagnostic criteria for CVS are as follows: ste-
reotypical episodes of acute onset of vomiting lasting less than
1 week, three or more discrete episodes in the prior year, and
absence of nausea and vomiting between episodes in the ab-
sence of organic disease. Kim et al. demonstrated a near dou-
bling of the prevalence of CVS following legalization of can-
nabis in Colorado (prevalence ratio 1.92, 95% confidence in-
terval [CI] = 1.33 to 2.79), and these patients were more likely
to have cannabis use documented (OR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.44–
9.00) [5]. Additionally, five observational studies were iden-
tified which reported a significant prevalence of cannabis use
and compulsive hot baths/showers among CVS patients (see
Table 4) [175–179]. For example, Venkatesan et al. found that
among 437 CVS patients, 81% were cannabis users and 67%
reported using hot showers for symptom relief [179]. Bathing
behavior was associated with cannabis use (OR 2.54, 95%
CI = 1.2–4.3, P = 0.0006). Additionally, Fajardo et al. found
that among 48 CVS patients, 22% of cases and 12% of con-
trols were active or previous cannabis users (OR = 2.1, 95%
CI = 0.7–6.1) [175]. Cannabis use, when present, preceded
symptom onset in CVS patients. These studies suggest that
there is a cohort of CHS patients who may be misdiagnosed
with CVS. In situations where the diagnosis is in question,
cannabis use that precedes the onset of the vomiting syndrome
as well as compulsive hot baths/showers should alert the cli-
nician to consider recommending a trial of cannabis
abstinence.
CHS shares many clinical features with other CVSs. We
identified four case reports of patients initially diagnosed as
hyperemesis gravidarium but were ultimately diagnosed as
CHS, with a history of chronic cannabis use, compulsive hot
baths/showers, and a history of cyclic vomiting predating the
pregnancy [18, 64, 180, 181]. These studies exemplify the
diagnostic difficulty in the identification of CHS and suggest
that CHS may be more common than is reported.
The pathophysiologic processes underlying CHS are un-
clear at this time. Many hypotheses exist, yet there is very
limited evidence to support any one unifying mechanism.
The best evidence suggests a dynamic interplay between
78
J. Med. Toxicol. (2017) 13:71–87
 cannabinoid metabolism and complex pharmacodynamics at
the CB-1 receptor. In addition, our study identified three
unique cases of CHS caused by synthetic cannabinoids [23,
41, 182]. These agents are potent agonists of the cannabinoid
CB1 receptors, similar to THC, suggesting that agonism at the
CB1 receptor may be responsible for CHS. Supportive care
with IV fluids and anti-emetics is the mainstay of treatment in
the acute phase of illness. There is very limited evidence to
suggest that agents such as dopamine antagonists and capsa-
icin cream and avoidance of opiate pain medications may be
of benefit. While many providers utilize these agents in prac-
tice and find them effective, prospective case-control studies
are needed before recommendations can be made based upon
effectiveness. The authors of this study acknowledge the po-
tential difficulties of such studies, owing to the fact that CHS
is a heterogeneous clinical entity, and thus, selecting a com-
parable group of patients may prove difficult. Additionally,
agents such as topical capsaicin cream are not commonly
stocked in hospitals and emergency departments but could
be made available in the outpatient setting. There is moderate
evidence to support that the definitive treatment for CHS is
cannabis cessation. In this study, 96.8% of patients who
ceased cannabis use experienced complete resolution of
symptoms.
This systematic review is the first and most comprehensive
characterization of the CHS literature. We believe that these
evidence-based recommendations will improve diagnosis,
highlight the limitations of pathophysiology understanding,
and provide guidelines for treatment of this difficult condition.
Our proposed diagnostic characteristics are listed in Table 6
with corresponding GRADE quality recommendations.
A careful social history is needed in all cyclic vomiting
patients. Cannabis has various therapeutic properties includ-
ing anti-emesis, appetite stimulation, and analgesia [4]. These
properties have led to cannabis use in patients with cachexia
associated with AIDS, chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, chronic pain, and CVSs
[4]. Cyclic vomiting patients and those using cannabis for its
myriad of health benefits may perceive that cannabis is help-
ing their condition instead of exacerbating it. This systematic
review suggests that there may be a demographic of cyclic
vomiting patients who have been mislabeled. This may also
be true for hyperemesis gravidarum and gastroparesis patients.
Simonetto et al. reported that among 61 CHS patients who
underwent gastric emptying studies, 18 (30%) demonstrated
delayed emptying [9]. Since cannabis use has been shown to
delay gastric emptying [92, 132], this finding should not pre-
clude the diagnosis of CHS. When diagnosis is in doubt, a trial
of cannabis cessation may support the diagnosis [183].
It is difficult to quantify the precise amount of cannabis
consumed by patients who manifest CHS. Reporting is often
subjective and qualitative, and there is no metric for how
much physiologically active compounds are contained in
one joint, cone, bong, etc. In addition, higher THC content
through selective breeding of plants and more selective use of
female buds that contain more concentrated THC levels may
cause CHS to appear in patients who report lower amounts of
cannabis use [170].

 Initial reports describe an average of 7.1 emergency depart-
ment visits, 3.1 hospitalizations, and 5.0 clinic visits prior to
diagnosis [12], but as the syndrome is recognized more and
cannabis availability increases, more rapid diagnosis is likely.
Exclusion of a major medical etiology is mandatory prior to
the consideration of CHS. Other medical conditions that may
present similarly to CHS include, but are not limited to, bowel
perforation, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and ruptured aortic an-
eurysm [184]. Martinez et al. suggest that a minimum workup
should include basic laboratories, abdominal ultrasound (US)
and/or computerized tomography (CT) scan, and
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with initial admission.
However, the literature suggests that patients often undergo
multiple CT scans, EGDs, and even exploratory surgeries pri-
or to diagnosis. In one multicenter cohort study, the mean
numbers of abdominal CT studies and abdominal/pelvic US
and abdominal radiographs were 5.3 ± 4.1, 3.8 ± 3.6, and
5.5 ± 6, respectively [7]. For one participating ED with seven
patients enrolled in the study, the median charge for ED visits
and hospital admissions over the course of a patient’s illness
was $95,023 (range $62,420 to 268,110).
We would suggest a pragmatic approach to diagnosis that
starts with a complete history of cannabis use including age of
initial onset, amount used per week, and behavioral factors
associated with symptom relief (such as hot showers).
Following this, underlying medical etiology of the symptoms
should be ruled out using laboratory evaluation and imaging.
However, this workup should only be performed initially and
repeated only if there is a change in the patient’s clinical status
that suggests a new emergent condition. Greater education is
needed among clinicians in order to limit repeated
Bexclusionary^ workups and iatrogenesis. In addition, as the

 trend toward cannabis legalization spreads, states need to cre-
ate public health messages to warn cannabis users of the pos-
sibility of developing this syndrome.
Cessation of cannabis appears to be the best treatment for
CHS. Our review revealed that CHS patients may often have
poor follow-up. Follow-up was documented in only 85 of 211
patients (40.2%). Multidisciplinary care may be necessary for
management and diagnosis. Patients may deny cannabis use
as a cause of their symptoms and fail to follow-up or seek
medical care at other facilities resulting in repeated testing
and resource utilization [8]. Therefore, substance abuse ex-
perts should be involved when the diagnosis is made.
Further targeted basic science research is needed to eluci-
date the pathophysiology underlying CHS. Strong prospective
epidemiologic studies are needed to determine the prevalence
of the disorder and the rate of disease development among
cannabis users. In addition, randomized studies are needed
to establish effective treatments to terminate acute exacerba-
tions. As demonstrated by Kim et al., with liberalization of
cannabis laws, growing prevalence of CHS is likely. In addi-
tion, results from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH) indicate that 7.4% of adolescents aged 12–
17 were current users [2]. Our results show the average age of
cannabis use onset among CHS patients to be 16 (IQR = 14–
18). Given a large, young aged demographic of chronic can-
nabis users, a prospective, case-control study would increase
our understanding as to who is at risk for the development of
CHS.
Conclusion
CHS is characterized by severe cyclic vomiting, usually ac-
companied by abdominal pain associated with early age of
cannabis use with symptoms that most commonly develop
in the third decade of life. Symptom onset is preceded by daily
to weekly cannabis use. Patients usually report temporary re-
lief of symptoms with compulsive hot baths/showers and ex-
perience resolution of symptoms with cessation of cannabis
use. The pathophysiology underlying CHS is unclear.
Cannabis cessation appears to be the best treatment.
