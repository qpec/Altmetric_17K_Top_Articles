Minerals in Pregnancy and 
Lactation: A Review Article
IntRoductIon
Minerals play different roles in the body among which, participation 
in the construction of the body and regulation of its function 
especially in bone construction, transport of oxygen, regulation 
of blood sugar, as a cofactor for the enzyme activity, regulation of 
chemical reactions, protection of cells from oxidative damage and 
regulation of immune system function [1]. Minerals constitute about 
4% to 5% of body weight out of which, 50% is calcium and 25% is 
phosphorus [2].
During pregnancy, increased physiological changes to support body 
metabolism in the mother and growing foetus lead to an increased 
need for micronutrients [1, 2]. Therefore, it is of great importance to 
ensure whether women receive sufficient macro- and micronutrients 
prior to and during pregnancy [2, 3]. Micronutrient deficiency both 
during fertilization and pregnancy leads to some increased risks 
which include anaemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-
eclampsia, foetal growth restriction, increased labor complications, 
and maternal and foetal mortality [2-4].
The mother's nutritional status affects embryonic genome expression 
and is associated with development of diseases in later life stages 
such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and conditions such as 
hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes [4]. 
Given the importance of mineral micronutrients in pregnancy and 
lactation, in this review, the role of minerals in pregnancy and lactation 
and their rate of consumption, as well as complications induced by 
their deficiency or excess use, are investigated. To this end, each of 
minerals is separately described and the recommended daily intake 
as well as maximum allowable daily intake of minerals for adults and 
pregnant and lactating women is presented in [Table/Fig-1,2].
Electrolytes
The amount of daily salt intake recommended for the average 
person is 3-5 grams, reaching 7-8 grams during pregnancy 
[Table/Fig-1] [1,5]. Daily salt intake by pregnant women is usually 
higher than this value [1,3,5,6]. However, except in cardiovascular 
diseases, daily salt intake should not be less than 7-8 grams since 
it may cause the risk of ion balance severe disruption [3,6]. Under 
normal circumstances, there is no need to reduce salt intake during 
pregnancy, even in pre-eclampsia [7]. 
A study indicated that manipulating sodium intake does not affect 
the frequency of pre-eclampsia [7]. In addition, a recent study also 
demonstrates the dietary implications of attempting to restrict 
sodium. Dietary histories of 68 women assigned to either a low-
sodium or normal-sodium diet indicated that sodium restriction 
was associated with a reduced intake of protein, calcium and 
energy. Sodium restriction or supplementation has no place in the 
management of pre-eclampsia [7]. 
Another reason is that loss of high levels of sodium may result in 
the risk of exacerbation of hypertension by reducing blood volume, 
which in turn results in increased renin secretion and hypertension. 
Therefore, it is better to increase potassium intake parallel to 
reducing sodium intake and avoid consumption of coffee, alcohol 
and saturated fats. Potassium-rich foods include meat, fruits, grains 
(especially rice), vegetables, fresh and dried fruits and drinks [5]. 
Potassium consumption during pregnancy is necessary to keep 
blood pressure levels and also, to reduce complications of excess 
sodium intake on blood pressure [2,5,8]. 
Chloride is the main anion in extracellular fluids and plays an 
important role in nervous system development during pregnancy 
[5]. 
calcium
Calcium plays different roles during foetus development among 
which, participation in different tissues construction and cell 
signaling [3, 9-11]. Food sources of calcium include milk, cheese, 
yogurt, tofu, legumes, green leafy vegetables and fish with edible 
bones, e.g., sardines. Calcium uptake varies at different stages of 
life and increases when the need for calcium increases, such as 
during pregnancy and lactation [Table/Fig-1] [9]. Adequate vitamin D 
is also important in calcium uptake during pregnancy [3,8].
There are many controversies about the amount of calcium uptake 
in pregnancy [6]. Some studies have suggested that increased 
calcium uptake during pregnancy is required in order to preserve 
maternal calcium balance and bone density, and its amount must 
increase from 1000 mg/day to 1300 mg/day [2,6,8,12]. However, 
most sources have expressed that calcium uptake does not 
need increase due to hormonal changes in pregnancy and thus, 
consuming 1000 and 1300 mg/day of calcium is sufficient for 
pregnant women older than 19 years and for teenage pregnancy 
[Table/Fig-1,2] [4,8,13].
While maternal calcium uptake increases across the intestine, the 
net effect of these hypercalcaemia-driven changes is foetal skeletal

ABStRAct
Micronutrients (include vitamins and minerals) are essential for normal function, growth and development. Minerals have important 
effects on the health of the mother and foetus. But biological mechanisms of minerals are not completely understood. Micronutrient 
deficiency during pregnancy can lead to anaemia, hypertension, obstetric complications and even maternal death and in foetus lead 
to a fail in growth and development. Mineral deficiency during pregnancy, particularly exist in developing countries. During pregnancy 
due to the increased demands caused by physiological changes, deficiency is exaggerated and as a result its complications occur. 
Thus, ensuring to receive enough macronutrients and micronutrients before and during pregnancy, is important. Nevertheless, 
there are controversies regarding administrating supplements. There are not enough studies about some of the minerals and the 
challenges  remain. Regarding the importance of minerals in pregnancy and lactation, in this  review we will analyze the role of them 
in pregnancy and lactation.

time, excessive blood loss during childbirth, slow cervical dilation 
and increased pulmonary oedema [18]. 
Iron
Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common nutritional deficiency 
worldwide, affecting maternal and child health [22]. The overall iron 
needed during pregnancy significantly increases from 15-18 mg/
day throughout non-pregnancy to 27 mg/day during pregnancy 
period [Table/Fig-1,2]. However, there are lower intakes for most 
women in diets [23].
Despite the iron absorption increase throughout the pregnancy, 
the blood is diluted due to blood volume increase (50%) [22,24]. 
Iron status of women at the time of conception is of concern for 
a healthy pregnancy, preventing postpartum and breast-feeding 
anaemia up to six months after delivery [24,25]. The newborns also 
store about 270 mg of iron in their body, which is totally obtained 
from their mothers [22,24,25]. Iron deficiency is related to some 
maternal and foetal pregnancy disorders, including pre-eclampsia, 
preterm labour and premature rupture of membranes [25]. Maternal 
iron deficiency anaemia is associated with the behavioral and 
neural development of changes in white matter myelination, striatal 
monoamine metabolism and hippocampal function [22,26,27]. As a 
result, adequate intake of iron is essential for the normal growth and 
development of foetus [26].
Iron supplements are routinely used during pregnancy; however, the 
potentially harmful effects of iron intake in women with sufficient 
iron status are raising debates [26]. The iron supplement dose is a 
critical issue associated with its potential side effects [25,27]. Due to 
the production of reactive active oxygen species by iron, the excess 
iron results in cell and tissue damages and is toxic [22,26,27]. 
In an observational study, it was reported that the prevalence of 
gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome 
in mid-pregnancy is more than twice among iron supplement 
intake groups; thus, the excess iron should not be recommended 
[22,26,27]. It seems that selective prevention for iron deficiency 
anaemia is the most effective and appropriate method. The 
recommended intake of iron during lactation period is 9-10 mg/day, 
which is significantly lower than the pregnancy period (27 mg/day) 
[23]. Iron is present at low concentrations in breast milk; however, 
the iron concentration of breast milk is not influenced by maternal 
iron status changes, such as supplement intakes [23].
copper
Copper is biologically involved in building connective tissues, iron 
metabolism, production of melatonin, heart function, immune 
system function and development of the central nervous system [4, 
18]. Copper is a vital cofactor of antioxidant enzymes [18]. These 
enzymes are expressed in mother and foetus tissues and play an 
important role in removing pregnancy oxidative stress. Without this 
protective mechanism, oxidative stress may lead to poor pregnancy 
outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, foetal growth restriction, and 
abortion [14,18].
Recent studies have approved the effective role of copper in neuro-
behavioral and neuro-cognitive development during the last two-
third period of pregnancy [13]. The balance between copper and 
iron is also important to ensure proper brain development [4,6]. 
Copper deficiency in the human diet affects the foetus development 
[13]. Copper deficiency is teratogenic in animals [13]. Copper 
deficiency is rare, observed in premature babies and in patients who 
are receiving parenteral nutrition without copper [13]. In addition to 
iron deficiency, copper deficiency anaemia may lead to skeletal 
disorders, growth disorders, heart muscle degeneration, nervous 
system degeneration, changes in hair colour and structure, reduced 
immune response and increased incidence of infection [9]. 
Because copper deficiency has not been noticed in human 
mineralization [14]. During pregnancy, approximately 30 grams of 
calcium is deposited in the foetal skeleton, while the rest of calcium 
is stored in the maternal skeleton, probably due to calcium demands 
during lactation [2,13,14]. On an average, in the last trimester of 
pregnancy, 300 mg of calcium is daily transmitted to the foetus [6, 
14].
Hypocalcemia affects membrane permeability and smooth muscle 
contraction strength and thus, it can affect blood pressure and the 
onset of preterm uterine contractions [2,14]. The use of calcium 
supplementation in women with low calcium uptake reduces the 
risk of hypertension and pre-eclampsia [12,14,15]. 
However, improved maternal calcium status does not have a long-
term positive impact on infant and maternal bone mass, the risk 
of stillbirth, infant mortality before hospital discharge, and maternal 
mortality and preterm birth [15,16]. Calcium supplementation is not 
routinely recommended during pregnancy, and is only prescribed 
by a doctor in women who refrain from dairy consumption or have 
deficient vitamin D levels [12,14,16]. 
Dietary calcium recommendations in lactating women are the same 
as other women [6,16]. Calcium content of the mother's breast 
milk is not correlated with maternal calcium uptake, and it contains 
sufficient calcium due to maternal physiological changes such as 
bone transient analysis [2,16]. Increased calcium uptake does not 
prevent maternal bone demineralization [2,6,16].
Phosphorus
There are a variety of phosphorus containing foods such as grains, 
meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, milk products, nuts and beans [8, 
14,17]. The deficiency of this mineral, although rare, but if occur 
may have symptoms such as anaemia, myasthenia, bone pain, 
rickets, Genu varum, anorexia, vertigo, confusion and possibly 
can cause death [14,17]. High levels of phosphorus are caused by 
excessive use of phosphorus containing food additives and threaten 
bone health [9, 17]. The recommended amount of phosphorus 
uptake in pregnancy is similar to non-pregnant women [Table/Fig-1] 
[6,8,9,17].
Magnesium
Magnesium is there in a variety of foods such as meat, grains, 
bread, beans and vegetables and thus, is rarely deficient; 
however, hypomagnesemia may occur in people with alcoholism, 
malnutrition or intestinal and kidney diseases [5,18]. Symptoms of 
hypomagnesemia include nausea, myasthenia and muscle cramps, 
irritability, mental disorder, blood pressure and heart rate changes 
[5,18]. 
Magnesium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, 
and through affecting calcium channels in arterial muscle, causes 
relaxation of muscles within the vessel walls and thus, vasodilatation 
and decreased vascular resistance as well as decreased vasospasm 
and blood pressure which are beneficial during pregnancy [5, 9, 19]. 
Hypomagnesemia leads to hypertension, preeclampsia and preterm 
birth in pregnancy [19]. Therefore, use of magnesium sulfate is 
common for pre-eclampsia treatment and preventive treatment 
against preterm delivery [19]. 
Several studies on pregnancy dietary have shown that magnesium 
intake is often less than the recommended amount [Table/Fig-1] [19 
21]. In various studies, magnesium supplementation has shown to 
reduce preterm births, number of cases of maternal hospitalization, 
pre-delivery bleeding and low birth weight newborns [14,20]. Ninety 
percent of magnesium is excreted by the kidneys and as a result, 
magnesium toxicity is rare when using oral supplements [Table/Fig-
1,2] [18,19]. However, intramuscular or intravenous administration 
should be done with care and renal function must be ensured to 
prevent an increase in serum magnesium [5,12,14]. Complications 
of maternal magnesium toxicity include death, increased bleeding

pregnancy, its supplement is not of essence [Table/Fig-1,2] [9]. 
Copper toxicity from food is rare [9]. Studies have shown that there 
is relationship between high levels of copper and preterm birth and 
low birth weight and serum concentration of zinc and copper in 
preterm infants' plasma is significantly higher compared to term 
infants' [9]. Further prospective studies should be designed to well 
investigate the benefits.
Zinc
Zinc regulates function of nearly 100 different enzymes, DNA and 
RNA synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, acid–base homeostasis, 
folate absorption, vitamin A and vitamin D activating, and maintaining 
cell membrane stability [9]. 
The richest sources of zinc are shellfish, meat, eggs, grains, 
peanuts, dairy products, whole grains, and dark green and dark 
yellow vegetables [9]. Because grain has low zinc concentration, 
zinc deficiencies in populations that have grain protein-based diets 
have been reported [5,9,18]. 
Severe zinc deficiency symptoms are, poor growth and development, 
exanthem, impaired reproduction and reduced immune function [9]. 
Periods of rapid growth such as infancy, puberty and late pregnancy 
are more vulnerable to zinc deficiency [28].
Zinc plays an important role in pregnancy and lactation, including 
foetal development and milk secretion. Depending on the 
bioavailability of zinc in diets, 2-4 mg of excessive zinc is required 
during pregnancy to meet the physiological needs [Table/Fig-1,2] 
[28]. It is estimated that mothers' required zinc at the third trimester 
of pregnancy doubles compared to non-pregnant women [2,5,29]. 
As a result of blood dilution and increased transfers to the developing 
foetus, the maternal serum zinc concentration decreases [2,29]. 
Severe zinc deficiency is associated with long-term labour, 
teratogenicity 
and 
foetal 
or 
embryonic 
mortality 
[29,30]. 
Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic 
disorder affecting the zinc metabolism and inhibits the absorption of 
zinc [29,30]. Pregnancy in individuals suffering from this disorder is 
accompanied 
with 
abortion, 
anencephaly, 
achondroplastic 
dwarfism, 
and infants with low birth weight; however, normal pregnancy 
outcomes will be observed if they receive high doses of oral zinc 
and the normal serum zinc concentration is maintained throughout 
pregnancy [29,30]. Inspite of these findings, no strong evidence 
has been found to recommend zinc supplements during normal 
pregnancy [29,30]. Studies indicated that zinc supplement with 
increasing the pregnancy duration reduces preterm deliveries and 
increases average birth weight [29,30]. The zinc supplement during 
pregnancy is also associated with reduced incidence of pregnancy- 
induced hypertension and increased head circumference in infants 
[30,31]. 
Selenium
Selenium plays an antioxidant role in cell functions, restoring and 
maintaining muscles, fertility and cancer prevention [5, 9]. It also 
fights against infection and regulates the growth and development 
[5,9]. The main sources of selenium in diets are as follows: seafood, 
poultry, eggs, kidney, liver and plant foods (including cereals, 
nuts, garlic, and radish) [5,13,24]. The body absorbs 55%-70% of 
selenium from foods [3,14].
Selenium deficiency is uncommon [9]. Selenium deficiency is related 
with recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia and intrauterine 
growth restriction [31]. In low-weight newborns umbilical cord 
serum selenium concentration is lower than that in newborns with 
normal weight [24]. Cord serum selenium concentration is directly 
correlated with the infant head circumference [2,24]. 
The breast milk selenium represents the amount of maternal 
selenium intake [9]. Additionally, the recommended selenium level

for lactating women is slightly higher than that for other women [2, 
13]. Dose required for toxicity has not yet been specified [Table/Fig-
1,2] [9]. Symptoms of selenium toxicity include brittle hair and nails, 
hair and nail loss and gastrointestinal disorders [9].
Manganese
Food sources of manganese include whole grains, legumes, nuts, 
tea, wheat, rice, spinach, pineapple and soy beans [Table/Fig-1,2] 
[9,20]. In adults, approximately 1%-5% of consumed manganese is 
absorbed and the intake rate is significantly higher in women than 
in men [20]. Manganese is a key component of enzymes involved 
in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and cholesterol, 
formation of cartilage, synthesis of urea and protection of cells 
against oxidative damage and also, plays a role in activating other 
enzymes [12]. 
Naturally occurring manganese deficiency has never been reported 
in humans [8]. Manganese toxicity causes nerve damage [9]. 
Manganism is caused more by industrial exposure than by food 
consumption [9]. Manganese plays an important role in the process 
of pregnancy and normal foetal development [13]. Serum levels of 
manganese increases throughout pregnancy [32]. Few studies have 
been conducted on manganese, and no information on manganese 
supplements in human pregnancy has been published so far. 
Assessment of blood manganese concentration in women has 
shown that in women with intrauterine growth restriction infants 
have lower serum levels of manganese than those with normal 
pregnancy and therefore, manganese may play an important role in 
foetal growth and development [32]. 
Iodine
Among the key priorities for the World Health Organization is 
to ensure optimal iodine nutrition in women of reproductive age, 
especially for communities in iodine deficient regions [33].
Iodine uptake by the thyroid gland increases during pregnancy 
[33]. Sufficient iodine intake is necessary to support the mother 
and foetus [33]. The need for iodine increases to more than 45% 
in pregnancy, reaching from 150 to 220 micrograms/day [Table/
Fig-1,2] [23,33]. The World Health Organization recommended daily 
iodine intake during pregnancy and lactation is 200-250 mg [34]. 
Sufficient amount of iodine is essential for the production of thyroid 
hormones in the mother's body, and also normal development of 
foetal brain [33,34]. It has been shown that even mild maternal 
iodine deficiency may have adverse effects on foetal cognitive 
development [33]. Maternal iodine deficiency is associated with 
an increased incidence of miscarriage, stillbirth, and abnormalities 
[33]. Currently, iodine deficiency is regarded as the most common 
cause of preventable brain damage worldwide [35,36]. Therefore, 
adequate iodine intake throughout pregnancy is very important 
[35]. Iodine deficiency-induced disorders can be prevented using 
supplements prior to or during the first three months of pregnancy 
[35,36]. Studies on iodine supplements during pregnancy have 
shown its positive impact on maternal and neonatal outcome 
such as significant reduction in the rate of prematurity and stillbirth 
[35,36]. American Thyroid Association has recommended daily use 
of 150 mg of iodine in pregnant women [37].
Moreover, the need for iodine increases during lactation [37]. 
Accordingly, lactating women are reported to need 290 micrograms 
of iodine per day [Table/Fig-2] [35,37]. Lactating women with 
iodine deficiency may not be able to provide their babies (who are 
vulnerable to the effects of iodine deficiency) with enough iodine 
[35,37]. 
chromium
Chromium is required for normal functioning of the insulin hormone 
[9,38]. Chromium deficiency affects the body's ability to regulate 
blood glucose and causes symptoms such as diabetes, including 
high blood sugar and increased levels of insulin [38,39]. Chromium 
food sources include liver, nuts, and whole grains [38,39]. Chromium 
deficiency has been reported in patients receiving chromium-free 
parenteral nutrition and malnourished children [9,38,39]. 
However, no study has reported toxicity of orally-administered 
chromium, although chromium supplementation at high doses by 
athletes and weightlifters leads to some complications, especially 
skin lesions [Table/Fig-1,2] [14,38,39]. Two observational studies 
have shown that serum chromium level in pregnant women is not 
associated with gestational diabetes [39]. An eight-week clinical 
trial on 24 women with gestational diabetes showed that taking 
chromium supplements reduces fasting blood glucose levels 
and insulin [35]. However, more research, especially randomized 
controlled trials, are required to determine whether taking chromium 
supplements can be a tool in the treatment of gestational diabetes. 
Fluoride
Fluoride obviously plays a role in increasing tooth resistance to 
caries and maintaining bone structure [5,14]. During odontogenesis, 
fluoride is incorporated in the enamel crystal and makes teeth more 
resistant to caries [9]. Fluoride can be also found in bones and is 
important for bone health [9]. Natural sources of fluoride in the diet 
include tea and marine fish, especially fish with edible bones [9, 
14].
Fluoride crosses the placenta and is incorporated in deciduous 
teeth [14]. Data of double-blind prospective interventional studies 
have not shown any association between low levels of caries and 
prenatal fluoride exposure, that is why fluoride supplementation is 
not recommended during pregnancy [14]. Excess fluoride intake 
during pregnancy is not associated with increased susceptibility to 
fluorosis [14]. Adequate fluoride intake in pregnancy is necessary to 
increase tooth resistance and maintain bone health in the mother 
and also, to help proper foetal bone development [Table/Fig-1,2] 
[5,14].
Molybdenum
Molybdenum is required for the activation of enzymes involved in 
the metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids and nitrogen-
containing compounds contained in DNA and RNA, production of 
uric acid and detoxification [24]. Molybdenum plays a role in the 
synthesis of red blood cell [24]. Food sources of molybdenum 
include milk, meat, bread, grains and legumes [Table/Fig-1,2] [21]. 
Molybdenum deficiency, although rare, has been reported in patients 
receiving pure parenteral nutrition without molybdenum for a long 
time [21]. Any probable complications resulting from molybdenum 
deficiency and toxicity are yet to be discovered [21,24]. Molybdenum 
deficiency symptoms include mental changes and sulphur and 
purine metabolism disorders [21,24].  
Boron
Boron requirement for humans has not been proven, but its 
necessity is widely accepted for plants and animals [21]. Boron 
is obtained from sources such as sodium borate and rapidly and 
almost completely (90%) absorbed [13, 21]. All plant foods and 
their byproducts, such as seeds, nuts, vegetables and fruits contain 
boron [13, 21]. Boron affects the activity of many enzymes and is 
important in metabolism of nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, 
and vitamin D [21]. The recommended daily intake of boron has not 
been suggested, but its maximum daily intake in adults older than 
19 years along with pregnant and lactating women is 20 mg [Table/
Fig-1,2] [21].
dIScuSSIon
During pregnancy, increased metabolic needs lead to increased need

enhance foetal development outcomes [14]. Micronutrients play 
various important roles in pregnancy, and lack of each one causes 
irreversible complications in both the mother and foetus [14]. Some 
of these complications include anaemia, aggravate malnutrition, 
hypertension, pre-eclampsia, labour complications and even 
maternal death, miscarriage, preterm delivery, and foetal growth 
restriction, and even diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [1,14]. 
During pregnancy, most women usually have undesirable nutrition 
[14]. According to unwanted pregnancies, awareness-raising 
attempts in the area of healthy diets and lifestyles should be made 
both prior to and during pregnancy [14,40].
Given the importance of micronutrients, especially minerals during 
pregnancy, numerous studies have been carried out to investigate 
their deficiency complications and also their supplementation; 
however, contradictions are seen in the results [24,25]. Moreover, 
further investigation is required regarding elements such as 
manganese and boron, as comprehensive studies have not 
yet conducted on their effects during pregnancy. Due to the 
effect of minerals in major complications such as pre-eclampsia, 
gestational diabetes, preterm or low birth weight, greater number of 
interventional, prospective and observational studies is required.
concluSIon
Proper use of minerals during pregnancy and lactation can reduce 
maternal and fetal complications.
