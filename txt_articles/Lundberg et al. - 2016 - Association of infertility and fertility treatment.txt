Abstract
Background: Ovarian stimulation drugs, in particular hormonal agents used for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS)
required to perform in vitro fertilization, increase estrogen and progesterone levels and have therefore been
suspected to influence breast cancer risk. This study aims to investigate whether infertility and hormonal fertility
treatment influences mammographic density, a strong hormone-responsive risk factor for breast cancer.
Methods: Cross-sectional study including 43,313 women recruited to the Karolinska Mammography Project
between 2010 and 2013. Among women who reported having had infertility, 1576 had gone through COS, 1429
had had hormonal stimulation without COS and 5958 had not received any hormonal fertility treatment. Percent
and absolute mammographic densities were obtained using the volumetric method Volpara™. Associations with
mammographic density were assessed using multivariable generalized linear models, estimating mean differences
(MD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI).
Results: After multivariable adjustment, women with a history of infertility had 1.53 cm3 higher absolute dense
volume compared to non-infertile women (95 % CI: 0.70 to 2.35). Among infertile women, only those who had
gone through COS treatment had a higher absolute dense volume than those who had not received any hormone
treatment (adjusted MD 3.22, 95 % CI: 1.10 to 5.33). No clear associations were observed between infertility, fertility
treatment and percent volumetric density.
Conclusions: Overall, women reporting infertility had more dense tissue in the breast. The higher absolute dense
volume in women treated with COS may indicate a treatment effect, although part of the association might also be
due to the underlying infertility. Continued monitoring of cancer risk in infertile women, especially those who
undergo COS, is warranted.

 Background
Infertility in couples has an estimated prevalence of 12
to 28 % [1]. Hormonal therapies are commonly used for
treating a variety of infertility types [2]. For treatments
of infertility aiming at inducing ovulation, clomiphene
citrate or low-dose gonadotropins are usually given. For
treatments involving in vitro fertilization (IVF) and
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), high doses of
gonadotropins are required to stimulate multiple follicle
recruitment (controlled ovarian stimulation, COS). Since
all these treatments increase estrogen and progesterone
levels, they have been suspected to influence breast can-
cer risk [3, 4]. So far, most studies and meta-analyses
have found no clear association between ovarian stimu-
lation and breast cancer risk [5–8]. However, many stud-
ies suffer from methodological limitations, including
limited control for confounding factors, lack of an ap-
propriate reference group, and short follow-up with
small numbers of breast cancer cases among women
using hormonal fertility treatment [5].
Mammographic density refers to the amount of radio-
logically dense fibroglandular tissue in the breast and is
a major risk factor for breast cancer [9]. Women with
extremely dense breasts have a four- to sixfold higher
risk of developing breast cancer compared to women
having fatty or non-dense breasts [10]. Mammographic
density also shares many risk factors with breast cancer
and is therefore seen as an intermediate in breast cancer
etiology [11]. Like breast cancer, mammographic density
is a hormone-responsive trait as it increases during hor-
mone replacement therapy [12, 13], while it decreases
with tamoxifen treatment [14, 15]. Since most women
who have gone through fertility treatments are still
below the age at which breast cancer is usually diag-
nosed, mammographic density is a useful marker to in-
vestigate the effect of hormonal fertility treatment on
potential breast cancer risk.
Few studies have evaluated the effect of hormone
stimulation for fertility treatments on mammographic
density. A mammographic screening study showed no
overall association between fertility drug use and mam-
mographic density, although mammographic density ap-
peared to be lower in women shortly after treatment
initiation [16]. Apart from hormonal fertility treatment,
the underlying infertility may also contribute to breast
cancer risk. A recent study on women with primary in-
fertility showed that ovulatory etiology of infertility was
associated with a higher mammographic density, sug-
gesting that these women may represent a group at high
risk of breast cancer [17].
In the present study, we aim to investigate the associa-
tions between infertility, hormonal fertility treatments
and mammographic density in a large screening-based
cohort of Swedish women.
Methods
Study population
The KArolinska MAmmography project for risk predic-
tion of breast cancer (KARMA) is a screening-based
cohort study of women attending one of four mammog-
raphy units in the national mammography screening
program in Sweden between 2010 and 2013. In Sweden,
women aged 40 to 74 years are offered mammography
screening at an interval of 18 to 24 months. Each
KARMA participant responded to a comprehensive
web-based questionnaire covering information on age,
education, anthropometry, reproductive health, lifestyle
factors, medication, comorbidities and heredity. Raw and
processed full-field digital mammograms were routinely
collected at the screening visit and stored for further
image processing. The KARMA cohort is also linked to
the Prescribed Drug Register.
For the present study, we selected all women aged 40
to 69 years who had full-field digital mammograms
stored at baseline (n = 57,481). Women with a previous
malignant cancer (n = 5132) and women who reported
breast surgery prior to mammography (n = 4364) were
excluded. Women with missing information on fertility
(n = 471), mammographic density (n = 82), parity (n = 206)
and other covariate data (n = 3953) were also excluded,
leaving a study population of 43,313 women for the
analyses.
Mammographic density measures
Mammographic density was measured from full-field
digital mammograms collected at study entry using the
fully automated system Volpara™ [18]. In brief, the algo-
rithm computes the thickness of dense tissue at each in-
dividual pixel using the X-ray attenuation of an entirely
fatty region as an internal reference. The absolute dense
volume (cm3) is measured by integrating the dense
thickness at each pixel over the whole mammogram,
and the total breast volume (cm3) is derived by multiply-
ing the breast area by the recorded breast thickness with
an appropriate correction for the breast edge. The per-
cent dense volume (%) is obtained from the ratio of
these two measures and the absolute non-dense volume
(cm3) by subtracting the absolute dense volume from
the total breast volume. Volpara™ has been validated
against breast magnetic resonance imaging data and we
have previously shown that both percent and absolute
dense volume area associated with established density
determinants and breast cancer risk [19]. For analyses,
we used the mean mammographic density from the left
and right breast of the mediolateral oblique view.
Exposure information
Information on infertility and fertility treatment was col-
lected from the questionnaire administered at study
Lundberg et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2016) 18:36 
Page 2 of 9
 entry. The participants who had ever tried to become
pregnant for one year or more without success were de-
fined as infertile, corresponding to the World Health
Organization definition of infertility [20]. Women report-
ing a history of fertility problems were also asked if they
had ever received fertility treatment and if so, which of the
following: hormonal treatment only, sperm insemination,
IVF/ICSI, IVF with egg donation, surgical treatment, and
other treatment. Based on their answers, infertile women
were further categorized into three exposure groups of
hormonal fertility treatment; ever had COS for IVF or
ICSI treatment (high-dose gonadotropin stimulation for
multiple follicle recruitment and superovulation), ever had
other hormonal treatment for ovulation induction (ovula-
tion induction with clomiphene citrate or low-dose go-
nadotropins but no COS aimed at IVF/ICSI), and never
had any hormonal treatment. The latter category included
women who had not received any fertility treatment as
well as women who had undergone a surgical treatment
of infertility or insemination without ovulation induction.
In Sweden, fertility treatments are provided within the
tax-funded healthcare system, under the guidelines of the
Swedish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Special
Interest Working Group on Fertility [21]. The treatments
are individualized according to the infertility causes identi-
fied. For anovulatory infertility up to six treatment cycles
using clomiphene citrate are usually prescribed as first-
line treatment. If unsuccessful, low-dose gonadotropin
stimulation treatments are initiated and thereafter IVF/
ICSI. Intrauterine insemination alone or in combination
with ovulation induction is indicated in cases of mild male
factor or unexplained infertility. The Swedish tax-funded
healthcare service covers up to six insemination treat-
ments or up to three IVF/ICSI cycles. In general, if a
couple does not achieve a pregnancy after three or four in-
semination treatments, the next step is using IVF/ICSI. If
severe male factor, tubal factor, or other causes such as
endometriosis are diagnosed, the appropriate first-line
treatment is by using IVF/ICSI.
Covariates
Information on the following covariates was retrieved
from the questionnaire: age, height, weight, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, family
history of breast cancer, age at menarche, menstruation
status, current use of hormone replacement therapy
(HRT), and parity. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated from self-reported weight and height as kg/m2.
Alcohol consumption was based on survey responses
covering the frequency and amount of different alcoholic
beverages consumed during the months before study
entry, and calculated as mean intake in grams per day.
Women who reported no drinking or drinking less than
once per month were defined as non-drinkers. Family
history of breast cancer was assessed for first-degree rel-
atives (mother, full sisters, and daughters). HRT use was
identified using the questionnaire and data from the Pre-
scribed Drug Register. Women were defined as current
HRT users if they reported using systemic HRT at study
entry or, when questionnaire data was missing or incom-
plete, if they had any dispensation of systemic HRT
within 100 days prior to mammography screening.
Menopausal status was defined according to menstru-
ation status, previous oophorectomy, and age. Women
were considered postmenopausal if they reported not
menstruating during the past year, had a history of oo-
phorectomy, or were above the age of 55.
Statistical analyses
We first compared mammographic density levels between
fertile and infertile women overall. Next, we assessed asso-
ciations between hormonal fertility treatments and mam-
mographic density. For this, we used infertile women who
had not received any hormonal fertility drugs as a refer-
ence, in order to prevent confounding by infertility per se.
All associations were analyzed using generalized linear
models (GLM) with a normal error distribution and a log
link, to account for the skewed outcome distributions. We
further applied robust standard errors using a sandwich
estimator to account for additional under- or overdisper-
sion and relax the assumption of log-normality. The
GLMs yielded an intercept (β0) equal to the log mean
density in the overall reference group and beta coefficients
(βi) equal to the log mean ratios between exposed and un-
exposed groups. These were transformed to mean differ-
ences (MD) on the absolute scale:
MD ¼ eβ0 � eβi−1
�
�
The delta method was used to calculate variances and
95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the MD. Separate ana-
lyses were performed for absolute dense volume, abso-
lute non-dense volume and percent dense volume. The
mean differences are measured in cm3 for the absolute
dense volumes, and percentage points (pp) for percent
dense volume. All models were adjusted for age (5-year
categories from 40 to 69 years). The fully adjusted
models also included potential confounders categorized
according to Table 1.
The following sensitivity analyses were performed: first,
we adjusted all models for age in finer intervals (1-year
categories), to evaluate if there may be residual confound-
ing by age in the main models. Second, we examined if
the associations were modified by age, by estimating sep-
arate effects of the hormonal fertility treatments in ages
40–49 and ages 50–69. The effect modification was tested
using the likelihood ratio test comparing models with and
without interaction terms. Likewise, we tested for effect

the analyses excluding women who reported insemination,
surgical or other non-hormonal fertility treatment (n =
493) from the group of infertile women having no hor-
monal treatment, keeping only women with untreated
infertility in this group. Finally, we checked whether asso-
ciations were different after excluding current users of
hormone replacement therapy (n = 1899).
The significance level was 5 %, and all tests were two-
sided.
SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary,

statistical analyses.
Ethics, consent and permissions
The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board at
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (ethical ap-
proval number 2010/958-31/1, amendment 2014/11-32).
All participants provided written informed consent.
Results
Characteristics of the study participants are summarized
in Table 1, according to history of infertility and fertility
treatments. Among all women, 8963 (20.7 %) reported a
history of fertility problems. Of these, 1576 had gone
through COS for IVF or ICSI, 1429 had had hormonal
stimulation without COS and 5948 had received no hor-
monal fertility treatment. Infertile women with no hor-
mone treatment, as well as those who had hormonal
treatment without COS, had higher absolute dense and
non-dense volume compared to non-infertile women,
while percent dense volume was similar in these three
groups. Women who had gone through COS treatments
had higher absolute dense volume and lower non-dense
volume, and thereby also a higher percent dense volume
compared to the other groups. These women were younger
and, consequently, more likely to be premenopausal com-
pared to other infertile women as well as to women with-
out fertility problems. They were also more likely to have a
higher education level and a lower BMI. Infertile women
who reported no hormonal treatment were older than
women who reported fertility treatment. Nulliparity was
more common in women who reported a history of infertil-
ity, with 31.3 % childless women in the COS-treated group.
The results of the models comparing women with and
without a history of infertility are presented in Table 2.
Figure 1 shows the results where infertile women were
categorized by fertility treatment, and infertile women
with no hormone treatment were the reference group.
Absolute dense volume
Overall, women with a history of infertility had 3.12 cm3
higher absolute dense volume (95 % CI: 2.22 to 4.02),
compared to women without infertility (Table 2). After
adjusting, the difference was 1.53 cm3 (95 % CI: 0.70 to
2.35). BMI and parity accounted for most of this attenu-
ation. Compared to infertile women who had not had
hormone treatment (Fig. 1), women treated with COS
had on average 4.62 cm3 higher dense volume (95 % CI:
2.24 to 7.00). In the fully adjusted model, the difference
was smaller (MD 3.22, 95 % CI: 1.10 to 5.33). We found
no significant difference in dense volume between infer-
tile women who had received hormonal treatment and
those who had not (MD −0.94, 95 % CI: −2.77 to 0.89).
Absolute non-dense volume
In the age-adjusted analysis, the absolute non-dense vol-
ume was 13.8 cm3 higher among infertile women than

 women without fertility problems (95 % CI: 4.9 to 22.8).
In the fully adjusted model, infertile women still had a
7.6 cm3 higher absolute non-dense volume than women
without fertility problems (95 % CI: 1.8 to 13.4). The at-
tenuation was mainly driven by parity. When comparing
to infertile women with no hormone treatment we found
no significant differences, although non-dense volume
seemed to be slightly larger in women with hormonal
fertility treatment (MD 14.1, 95 % CI: −0.2 to 28.3).
Percent dense volume
Percent dense volume was marginally higher among in-
fertile women compared to women with no infertility
(MD 0.19, 95 % CI: 0.04 to 0.35). After adjusting for pos-
sible confounders, the difference was no longer signifi-
cant (MD 0.09, 95 % CI: −0.06 to 0.23). The attenuation
was mainly due to adjusting for parity. Women who had
gone through COS had higher percent dense volume
than infertile women with no hormone treatment (MD
0.85, 95 % CI: 0.49 to 1.22), but this difference did not
remain significant in the fully adjusted model (MD 0.19,
95 % CI: −0.14 to 0.52). No associations were observed
with hormonal treatment other than COS in either age-
or multivariable-adjusted analyses.
Sensitivity analyses
In analyses stratified by age (Table 3), the association be-
tween COS and absolute dense volume seemed to be lar-
ger among 50–69-year-old women (MD 4.96, 95 % CI:
0.96 to 8.96) compared to women aged 40–49 years
(MD 2.57, 95 % CI: −0.12 to 5.25). However, the likeli-
hood ratio test for effect modification by age was not
statistically significant (p = 0.107). Looking at percent
dense volume on the other hand, a significant difference
between the age groups was observed (p = 0.021). Com-
pared to infertile women with no hormone treatment,
percent dense volume was somewhat lower among
women without infertility in the older, but not the youn-
ger age group. Due to the different age distributions of
the exposure groups, adjustment for age was done with

 finer intervals (1-year categories), with similar results as
in the main models (Additional file 1). The results from
the effect modification models for parity are presented
in Additional file 2. There was an indication that the
association between absolute dense volume and COS
treatment was stronger among nulliparous women (MD
7.33; 95 % CI: 3.29 to 11.38) than parous women (MD
2.21; 95 % CI: −0.02 to 4.44), with the p value for effect
modification being close to significance (p = 0.073). The
association with non-dense volume was modified by par-
ity (p < 0.001), as a positive association between hormo-
nal treatment other than COS was found in parous
women only (MD 21.2, 95 % CI: 6.7 to 35.7) and not
among nulliparous women (MD −24.7, 95 % CI: −61.8
to 12.4). Parity did not modify the associations with per-
cent dense volume (p = 0.280). Excluding women with
insemination, surgical or other fertility treatment from
the group of infertile women with no hormone treat-
ment gave similar results as in the whole study popula-
tion (Additional file 3), as did excluding women who
reported current use of hormone replacement therapy
(Additional file 4).
Discussion
Women with a history of infertility had higher absolute
dense and non-dense volume compared to non-infertile
women. Among infertile women, those who had gone
through COS treatment had higher absolute dense vol-
ume than those who had not received any hormone
treatment. Hormonal treatment for ovulation induction
without COS did not seem to be associated with either
absolute or percent density, while non-dense volume
was higher in this group.
Both absolute and percent dense volumes are associated
with breast cancer risk [19]. The fibroglandular tissue in
the breast, represented by the absolute dense volume, is
considered the target tissue for tumor development [22],
while percent dense volume incorporates additional infor-
mation on the non-dense or fatty component of the
breast. Percent dense volume is largely dependent on the
absolute non-dense volume [23], explaining why observed
differences in absolute dense volume do not necessarily
translate to differences in percent dense volume [24–26].
In our study, infertile women had a higher absolute dense
volume than women with no infertility. When comparing
different hormonal fertility treatments, only the associ-
ation between COS and absolute dense volume was sig-
nificant compared to infertile women with no hormone
treatment. In a study of breast cancer risk in relation to
mammographic density among KARMA participants, ab-
solute dense volume was associated with a higher risk of
breast cancer [19]. In terms of effect size, the observed
difference in absolute dense volume among women with
COS (3 cm3) is comparable to the effect size previously

 reported for
vigorous physical activity [23]. Within
KARMA, this difference in absolute dense volume has
also been linked to an approximately 2.5 % increase in
relative breast cancer incidence [23].
To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the
impact of infertility and different hormonal fertility treat-
ments on mammographic density, including COS. Obser-
vational data from Meggiorini et al. also pointed to high
mammographic density levels among infertile women at-
tending an IVF program [17]. This study, however, lacked
a proper reference group and as such no strong conclu-
sions could be drawn regarding the impact of female infer-
tility. Another study by Sprague et al. found no difference
in mammographic density between fertility drug users and
non-users [16]. This study is not directly comparable to
ours, due to the different density measure used and the
lack of a reference group of infertile women. Moreover,
this study did not address the impact of COS.
We found no association between hormonal fertility
treatments other than COS and either absolute or per-
cent dense volume, which is consistent with the results
of Sprague et al. [16]. We did, however, observe a weak
association between hormonal treatments other than
COS and the non-dense volume, or amount of fatty tis-
sue in the breast. This association was most evident in
parous women, which is most likely explained by un-
measured differences between women with successful
hormonal fertility treatments and women with fertility
problems who eventually had a spontaneous pregnancy.
The findings of our study indicate that COS used for
IVF/ICSI might have an effect on the breast tissue. Since
the high doses of gonadotropins used in COS increase
estrogen and progesterone levels to supra-physiological
levels, it is possible that they have an indirect effect on
the amount of dense tissue in the breast [3]. To our
knowledge, there are no studies of long-term effects of
COS on mammographic density. Our study lacked infor-
mation on the timing of treatment, meaning we could
not investigate if the higher density was limited to women
who had recently received treatment. Nevertheless, in the
analysis stratified by age, we found some indication of a
stronger association
in
older
compared
to
younger
women, although the test for effect modification was not
statistically significant. Although these results need to be
interpreted with caution, they may indicate a potential
long-term effect of COS on the breast tissue. While meta-
analyses point to a null effect of IVF on breast cancer risk
[5], more recent data seem to indicate a potential increase
in breast cancer risk, which becomes more evident with
increasing follow-up time [27]. Alternatively, the observed
difference by age could also be explained by long-term ef-
fects of the underlying infertility, since infertility diagnosis
may differ between infertile women who have gone
through COS and those who have not.
A limitation of our study was the lack of information
on the timing and number of treatment cycles each
woman had gone through. We were also unable to dif-
ferentiate between hormonal treatments with clomi-
phene citrate and low-dose gonadotropins. Assuming
these treatments have different effects on the breast tis-
sue, the estimates for hormonal treatment will be a mix-
ture of these effects. Another possible limitation is the
cross-sectional design, where mammographic density
and history of infertility was assessed at the same visit.
Since we relied on self-reports of infertility and fertility
treatment there might be a risk of misclassification.
However, the reporting of fertility problems is not likely
to depend on the mammographic density and any poten-
tial misclassification should therefore be non-differential.
Further, as infertility rarely requires in-patient care, we
were unable to capture specific diagnoses of infertility
through national registers. Hence, the group reporting a
history of infertility will also include some non-infertile
women who had an infertile partner. This would lead to
an attenuation of the overall association between infertil-
ity and mammographic breast density. The infertility
type could also influence what treatment the couples
undergo, indicating that any association between treat-
ment type and breast density could be due to the under-
lying infertility rather than the treatment per se.
The strengths of this study include the large, population-
based design and the extensive background information
collected on all study participants. Through the question-
naire we were able to identify women who had gone
through fertility treatment but remained nulliparous, infor-
mation that has been available in a national health quality
register only for the last 8 years. We were also able to con-
trol for several important confounders. The quantitative
volumetric method used for measuring mammographic
density is fully automated and eliminates the issue of user
variability in semi-automated methods.
Conclusions
In this population-based sample of women attending
mammographic screening, we found that women with a
history of infertility had higher absolute dense volume
than other women. Among the infertile women, those
who had gone through COS had the highest absolute
dense volume. This may indicate a potential adverse effect
of COS, but could also be due to the underlying infertility.
Whether this difference in density may affect their poten-
tial breast cancer risk is unknown. Hence, continued mon-
itoring of women undergoing COS is warranted.
