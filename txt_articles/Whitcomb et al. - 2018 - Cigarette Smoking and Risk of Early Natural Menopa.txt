Menopause before 45 years of age affects roughly 5%–10% of women and is associated with a higher risk of
adverse health conditions. Although smoking may increase the risk of early menopause, evidence is inconsistent, and
data regarding smoking amount, duration, cessation, associated risks, and patterns over time are scant. We analyzed
data of 116,429 nurses from the Nurses’ Health Study II from 1989 through 2011 and used Cox proportional hazards
models to estimate hazard ratios adjusted for confounders. Compared with never-smokers, current smokers (hazard
ratio (HR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71, 2.11) and former smokers (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.21)
showed an increased risk of early menopause. Increased risks were observed among women who reported current
smoking for 11–15 pack-years (HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.36, 2.18), 16–20 pack-years (HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.14),
and more than 20 pack-years (HR = 2.42, 95% CI: 2.11, 2.77). Elevated risk was observed in former smokers who re-
ported 11–15 pack-years (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.55), 16–20 pack-years (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.79), or
more than 20 pack-years (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.93). Women who smoked 10 or fewer cigarettes/day but quit by
age 25 had comparable risk to never-smokers (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.17). A dose-response relationship between
smoking and early natural menopause risk, as well as reduced risk among quitters, may provide insights into the mech-
anisms of cigarette smoking in reproductive health.

Early menopause, described as cessation of ovarian func-
tion, before the age of 45 affects roughly 5%–10% of women
in Western populations (1, 2). Research suggests that women
who experience early menopause are at increased risk for pre-
mature mortality, cognitive decline, osteoporosis, cardiovascu-
lar disease, and other adverse health outcomes (3–6). Women
commonly experience declining fertility during the 10 years
leading up to natural menopause. For women with early meno-
pause, this may have substantial consequences for family planning,
particularly with the increasing tendency to delay childbearing into
the later reproductive years (1, 7). Genetic factors do not fully
account for the timing of menopause, and emerging research
suggests that modifiable factors may play an important role in
ovarian aging (8–15).
Lifestyle factors such as smoking have been observed to be
related to timing of menopause. Cigarette smoking may impact
ovarian aging and follicle reserve by influencing gonadotropins
and sex steroids and may also have toxic effects on ovarian germ
cells (16). Current smoking is associated with earlier age at meno-
pause in several populations (10, 11, 15–22). Epidemiologic stud-
ies of smoking and early menopause generally suggest increased
risk (23–26), though not uniformly (27–29), and largely rely
upon retrospective smoking reports (30, 31). Moreover, less is
known regarding the relationship of the duration, amount, and
history of smoking with the risk of early natural menopause; addi-
tional studies have been suggested to fill this gap (29, 31).
In the present study, we describe the analysis of the relation
between cigarette smoking and risk of early natural menopause
in women from the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII). The large
cohort size and extensive longitudinal data collection allow for
a robust evaluation of the associations of cigarette smoking sta-
tus, duration, amount, and history with risk of early natural

 menopause. We hypothesized that there is a dose-dependent
relation of both duration and amount smoked with risk of early
natural menopause, as well as a lower risk among former smo-
kers compared with current smokers.
METHODS
The NHSII is a prospective study of 116,429 female US
registered nurses who were 25–42 years old in 1989 when
they responded to a mailed baseline questionnaire. Informa-
tion regarding lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions has
been collected through biennial mailed questionnaires. The
cumulative follow-up rate over time has been at least 89%.
For the current analysis, exclusion criteria included not being
premenopausal at baseline (n = 7,874), prior hysterectomy or
oophorectomy at baseline (n = 184), cancer at baseline (n =
693), missing data on smoking or covariates (n = 127), or not
participating beyond 1989 (n = 1,295), which resulted in a
final sample of 106,256 women (Figure 1). The study protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Brigham
and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and the Har-
vard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Outcome assessment
Biennial questionnaires included questions regarding whether
the menstrual periods of participants had ceased permanently.
Among those who reported that their menstrual periods had
ceased, participants were asked to indicate the age at cessation
and whether cessation occurred naturally or was related to sur-
gery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Information regarding use
of replacement sex hormones was collected as well. We iden-
tified cases of early menopause as women who reported natu-
ral menopause before the age of 45 years. For a small number
of women who reported being postmenopausal on 1 question-
naire and subsequently reported being premenopausal, age at
menopause was that after which periods had been absent for
12 months or more and continued to be absent for 3 or more
consecutive questionnaires. Premature menopause was defined
as natural menopause before the age of 40 years.
Cigarette smoking
Cigarette smoking was assessed at baseline in 1989 and con-
tinued through 2013. The baseline questionnaire included ques-
tions about the age at which women started smoking, as well as
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day at <15, 15–19,
20–24, 25–29, and 30–35 years of age. Women who reported
lifetime smoking of 20 or more packs of cigarettes were asked
about their current smoking status and if they had quit smoking
within the past year. Current and former smokers reported the
average number of cigarettes smoked per day (1–4, 5–14,
15–24, 25–34, 35–44, or ≥45). Subsequent biennial question-
naires included questions regarding current smoking status,
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day, and the age at
which those who stopped smoking quit. Updated smoking status
was used to calculate duration of smoking; information regard-
ing duration and average cigarettes smoked per day was used to
calculate pack-years of smoking to date.
Covariates
Baseline questionnaires in 1989 collected data on information
such as current age, height, weight, ethnicity, and age at menar-
che. Throughout follow-up, information was collected to update
factors such as weight, parity, oral contraceptive use, breastfeed-
ing, and hormone therapy use. Baseline height and updated
weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) as weight
(kg)/height (m)2 for each questionnaire cycle. Physical activity,
which was assessed in 1991, 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2009, was
defined as the average time spent weekly performing specific
activities (e.g., walking, running, and biking) and was used to
calculate metabolic equivalent task-hours per week (32).
Semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires were com-
pleted every 4 years starting in 1991. These questionnaires as-
sessed intake of 131 foods, beverages, and supplements (33–35)
and asked participants to estimate how often they consumed spe-
cific substances on average over the preceding year. They have
been previously assessed for validity (35). Frequency of con-
sumption was reported as one of the following: less than 1 serving/
month; 1–3 servings/month; 1 serving/week; 2–4 servings/week;
5–6 servings/week; 1 serving/day; 2–3 servings/day; 4–5 servings/
day; or 6 or more servings/day. Average use and dosage of multi-
vitamins and supplements were assessed every 2 years, and were
used to estimate the intake of each nutrient from supplement
sources. Nutrient intake was adjusted for total energy using the
residual method (36).
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were evaluated according to baseline
smoking status. Categorical variables were compared by χ2
tests and age-adjusted means were compared using generalized
linear models. These comparisons were used to evaluate rela-
tions of a priori identified potential confounding factors with
smoking to aid in model specification for multivariable models.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard
ratios for early menopause related to cigarette smoking. Assessed

 smoking behaviors included smoking status (current, past,
never), a composite variable that combined smoking status and
duration of smoking (never, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and >20
years), and a composite variable that combined smoking status
and amount of smoking (never, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and
>20 pack-years). For categorical smoking variables, tests for
trend were performed by specifying smoking category as a con-
tinuous variable. Accrual of follow-up (in months) began on the
date of return of the 1989 questionnaire and continued until
report of age 45 years, menopause, or the end of follow-up in
June 2011, whichever occurred first. Hysterectomy, oophorec-
tomy and other medical causes of menopause before menopause
were considered censoring events. Analyses were stratified on
the basis of age and questionnaire cycle. Age-adjusted models
were run and potential confounding addressed using multivari-
able models that were adjusted for a priori potential confounders
that were observed to be related to smoking status. Risk of men-
opause before 40 years of age was assessed similarly. In sensi-
tivity analyses, models that excluded women who reported
autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus,
rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis were run. Addition-
ally, models that stratified by BMI were run to assess homoge-
neity of the association across BMI categories.
We assessed patterns of smoking between the early teens
and 35 years of age and their relation with early natural meno-
pause. Latent class analysis was performed using SAS PROC
TRAJ (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and exam-
ined self-reported age-specific average daily cigarettes among
those that reported current or former smoking. Models were
run that varied the number of latent classes; on the basis of
model fit, 4 classes were specified. Never smokers were as-
signed to an additional class in which the average number of
daily cigarettes was fixed at zero. Relations between smoking
patterns and incident early menopause were evaluated by Cox
proportional hazards models, both unadjusted and with adjust-
ment for previously noted covariates. To further evaluate the
relation of timing of smoking with incident early menopause,
risk was compared between women by age at quitting within
strata of pack-years of smoking, with never smokers as the ref-
erence group. Analysis was conducted with SAS, version 9.3
or version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics are shown for 69,881 (65.8%)
women who reported never smoking, 22,619 (21.3%) who re-
ported past smoking, and 13,756 (12.9%) who reported current
smoking (Table 1). Mean age at baseline was lower for never
smokers (33.7 years) than past smokers (35.0 years) and cur-
rent smokers (34.4 years). Given the large sample size, statisti-
cally significant differences among groups were observed for
most factors, though differences tended to be small in magni-
tude. For example, age-adjusted mean age at menarche varied
between groups (P < 0.0001), though by less than 0.01 years.
Small to moderate differences were observed for physical
activity, parity, and race. Those who reported never having
smoked had lower daily alcohol consumption (2.2 g/day) then
former smokers (4.0 g/day) and current smokers (5.0 g/day).
Current smokers had lower parity and shorter durations of
breastfeeding, even when restricted to only parous women
(data not shown). Vegetable protein consumption, vitamin D
and calcium (total, dietary, dairy, and supplemental) were also
lowest in those who reported current smoking status.
Results of Cox proportional hazards models, including a
total of 2,754 incident early natural menopause cases that were
observed during 1,453,023 person-years of follow-up, are
shown in Table 2. Similar to models that were adjusted only
for age, in multivariable models that were adjusted for possible
confounders, current smoking was associated with a nearly
2-fold increase in risk compared with never smokers (hazard
ratio (HR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71, 2.11)
and past smoking status was associated with a smaller increase
in risk (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.21). Former smokers who
reported having smoked for more than 15 years were observed
to have increased risk of early menopause (HR = 1.31, 95%
CI: 1.14, 1.50). Among current smokers, the risk for those who
reported more than 15 years of smoking was substantially
higher than that of past and never smokers (HR = 1.97, 95%
CI: 1.77, 2.20). Increased risk was associated with increasing
cumulative pack-years of smoking among both past and cur-
rent smokers (P tor trend < 0.0001 for both). Among past smo-
kers, the risk for those with 10 or fewer pack-years of smoking
were comparable to that of never smokers, whereas increased
risks were observed for past smokers with 11–15 pack-years
(HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.55), 16–20 pack-years (HR =
1.42, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.79), and 20 or more pack-years (HR =
1.54, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.93). Among current smokers, increasing
risk was observed for women who smoked at least 6–10 pack-
years (HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.90) and the risk for women
who smoked at least 20 pack-years was more than twice that of
never smokers (HR = 2.42, 95% CI: 2.11, 2.77). In analyses
that excluded women with autoimmune conditions such as sys-
temic lupus erythematosus (n = 960), rheumatoid arthritis (n =
4,479), and multiple sclerosis (n = 1,308), estimates were nearly
identical to those of the main analysis (results not shown).
Results of latent class analysis and the related assessment of
smoking pattern and risk of early natural menopause are shown
in Figure 1 and Table 3. Using retrospectively-reported aver-
age smoking (cigarettes/day), 5 groups were identified. Addi-
tionally, 4 patterns of smoking between women under 15 years
and 35 years of age were determined from latent class models
in addition to never smokers, the largest of the groups (Fig-
ure 1). On the basis of smoking patterns, the 4 groups of smo-
kers can be described as 1) light smokers who quit by 35 years
of age, 2) women who reported heavier smoking through
30 years of age and quit by age 35 years, 3) women who smoked
between 5–14 and 15–24 cigarettes per day from age 20 years
through 35 years, and 4) women who smoked between 15–24
and 25–34 cigarettes per day through age 35 years.
In models that evaluated the risk of early menopause related
to smoking pattern, the highest risks were observed among
women who continued smoking through age 35 years, for both
moderate smokers (HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.47, 1.84) and those
in the group with the highest smoking amount (HR = 1.80,
95% CI: 1.56, 2.08). Women who quit by age 25 years and
whose peak average cigarettes smoked was less than a pack
per day had no increase in risk of early menopause (HR =
1.03, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.17). In contrast, women who quit by age
35 years and had smoked more heavily had a moderate and

 statistically significant increased risk of early natural meno-
pause (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.53).
Results of models that compared never smokers with past
and current smokers by age at quitting within strata of total
pack-years are shown in Table 4. Among past smokers who
smoked 5–10 pack-years, risk was comparable to never smo-
kers, whereas increased risk was observed among women who
reported currently smoking 5–10 pack-years (HR = 1.45, 95%
CI: 1.09, 1.94). Among women who smoked 11–15 pack-
years and quit, significantly increased risk was observed only
among women who had not quit before age 40 years (HR =
2.12, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.63). Lower risk related to earlier ages of
quitting was observed for those who quit before age 40 years
(P for trend < 0.001), but individual estimates were not statisti-
cally significant. Among women who quit smoking after
16–20 pack-years, risks were comparable across ages at quit-
ting and was higher compared with never smokers.
Results of models of premature menopause among the 300
women who experienced natural menopause before age 40
years followed a similar pattern to those of early menopause,
though estimates were generally attenuated, with small case
numbers in categories of amount and duration (results not
shown). Compared with never smokers, current smoking status
was associated with a 50% increased risk of premature meno-
pause in adjusted models (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.06). In
contrast, risk of premature menopause among former smokers
was not meaningfully different from that of never smokers
(HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.40).

Smoking has long been considered to be related to earlier
age at menopause, but uncertainty about causal links with the

 risk of early menopause has persisted because of a relative lack
of information regarding duration and amount of smoking, as
well as past smoking habits. To our knowledge, this is the larg-
est study of cigarette smoking and early natural menopause to
date. We considered data from up to 20 years of follow-up
from 106,256 NHSII participants who were premenopausal at
baseline, among whom 2,754 experienced early natural meno-
pause during follow-up. We observed a nearly 2-fold increased
risk associated with current smoking status compared with
women who reported never having smoked. We observed a
dose-response increasing risk related to current smoking amount
and duration, with the highest risks observed among current hea-
vy smokers. A smaller increased risk was observed among for-
mer heavy smokers. Among women who reported past light
smoking, no increased risk was observed. In addition, we
observed increased risk of natural menopause occurring before
age 40 years among current smokers.
Our observation of increased risk of early menopause related
to current smoking status is consistent with the majority of prior
studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that have evalu-
ated this relation. A meta-analysis from 2012 that included 11
studies with a total of approximately 50,000 women suggested a
43% increased risk of menopause before age 50 years when
comparing current smokers to nonsmokers (30). A systematic
review of smoking and age at menopause that included 93 stud-
ies reported an earlier age at menopause among current smokers
compared with nonsmokers, though no estimate was presented
and no information was provided on risk of early menopause
(29). The authors noted that insufficient data regarding the
impact of the quantity of cigarettes smoked and historical smok-
ing habits prevented conclusions regarding how these aspects of
smoking are related to menopausal timing. In addition, most
prior studies have been cross-sectional; a need for large prospec-
tive studies of the relation between smoking and age at meno-
pause has been described (29, 31).
In a recent prospective study, smoking and early natural men-
opause was evaluated among 7,223 participants of the Mater-
University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort. Smoking

 was assessed at baseline, 7 years, 14 years, and study completion
at 21 years among 3,545 women who completed follow-up,
among whom early natural menopause was experienced by 144
women (37). Women who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per
day at baseline, those who reported smoking 20 or more ciga-
rettes per day at the 14-year follow-up, and those who reported
being current smokers at the end of the 21 year observation
period for the study had an approximately 50% higher risk of
early menopause than women who never smoked. A smaller
increase in risk was observed in those who smoked less than 20
cigarettes per day and no increased risk was observed for former
smokers. The authors concluded that risk rises with increasing
quantity, but returns to that of nonsmokers among women who
quit, contrary to our findings in the present study.
Despite consistent risk estimates for current versus never
smoking, the role of amount, duration, and history of smoking
has been unclear (29, 31). Prior studies of risk in former smo-
kers are limited and results have been inconsistent. Some have
observed elevated risk among former smokers (20, 38–40).
Others have found no association (13, 19, 41–47), and some
have suggested that neither past smoking habits nor duration
are related to risk (43, 47). We observed dose-response relations
between smoking and risk of early menopause, with the most
elevated risks among current smokers with more than 20 pack-
years of smoking. We observed no increased risk among past
smokers with the lowest smoking quantity and duration; how-
ever, risk was elevated among former smokers who smoked
more than 10 pack-years. Further, women who quit smoking in
their 30s had lower risk of developing early menopause than
women who quit in their early 40s. Our results suggest that risk
does not return to that of never smokers for women who quit,
but is most pronounced among women who continue smoking
late into their reproductive years. Our analysis included more
than 20,000 former smokers. Because of its sample size, the
NHSII provides a unique opportunity for assessment risk among
of women who quit smoking.
Multiple mechanisms by which cigarette smoking may influ-
ence timing of menopause have been proposed, including acute
effects on levels of gonadotropin and sex steroids, as well as direct
toxic effects on ovarian follicles (16). Components of cigarette
smoke including nicotine and polycyclic hydrocarbons block aro-
matase conversion of androgens into estrogens in animal models
(48), which may lower blood levels of estrogen (49) and peak lu-
teinizing hormone (48). This effect may be exacerbated by the ef-
fects of smoke on cytochrome P-450 steroid metabolism as well
(50). Our observation of increased risk of early menopause among
former smokers and a dose response related to quantity and
duration of past cigarette smoking is consistent with a direct
effect of smoking on follicle loss. Compared with nonsmokers,
smokers have been observed to have lower levels of anti-Müller-
ian hormone (51), a glycoprotein produced by small antral and
pre-antral follicles (52). This evidence provides further support
for direct effects of smoking on ovarian germ cells. Our observa-
tion of the increased risk of menopause before age 40 years asso-
ciated with current smoking suggests a similar role of smoking.
Despite uncertainty regarding the relation between the etiolo-
gies of premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause,
studies of genetic influences suggest these overlap (53, 54).
The NHSII is a prospective study with 20 years of follow-
up. Many prior analyses of the relation of smoking with timing
of menopause have been restricted to cross-sectional studies
and/or only retrospectively-reported smoking. In contrast, our
analysis included longitudinally reported cigarette smoking ha-
bits throughout follow-up. In addition, the large sample size
and extensive covariate assessment in the NHSII help to
address possible confounding and/or effect modification. Re-
sults of analyses restricted to women with normal BMI were
similar to results in the full cohort, and effect estimates were
highly consistent across all 4 BMI categories (data not shown).
Censoring due to hysterectomy (n = 4,004) and oophorectomy
(n = 3,689) was unassociated with baseline smoking status,
and mitigates the potential for bias related to competing events.
Nevertheless, some limitations are of note. We utilized self-
reported menopausal age and smoking status, as laboratory mea-
sures were not feasible in a study of this size. A study of 6,591
women in the comparable Nurses’ Health Study suggests that
self-reported menopausal status is reproducible and valid. Among
women who were premenopausal in 1976 and who reported hav-
ing natural menopause on the 1978 questionnaire, 82% reported
their age at menopause to within 1 year on the following 2 ques-
tionnaires (55). Given the prospective study design, misclassifica-
tion of menopausal age is expected to be nondifferential by
smoking status. This would likely bias estimates towards the null;
however, to the extent that accuracy of report of menopausal may
be related to smoking, bias otherwise is possible.
Self-reported smoking has been shown to be largely accu-
rate in various study populations (56–58). Further, use of pro-
spective assessment of smoking habits is likely to minimize
reporting errors, and, as with menopausal timing, misclassifica-
tion most likely represents a bias toward the null. However, for
women who quit smoking before 1989, smoking information
was collected retrospectively, though before menopause. Base-
line smoking prevalence in the NHSII was slightly lower than
among women aged 25–44 years in the general US population
(59). Additionally, the NHSII has minimal variability in race
or ethnicity and income. Generalizability of our findings de-
pends in part on the mechanism of smoking being conserved
across subgroups.
This large prospective analysis provides support for a dose-
response relation between cigarette smoking and risk of early
menopause, primarily among current smokers but also among
pastsmokers.Ascigarette smokingiswell-establishedtoadversely
impact risk of many disease and health outcomes, our findings
do not suggest change to current public health policy. The
observation of minimal to no increased risk of early natural
menopause among women who quit early in their reproductive
lifespan compared with never smokers adds to the body of evi-
dence that support the benefits of quitting smoking. Further,
these findings may help to resolve uncertainty regarding rela-
tions of risk of early menopause with smoking amount and
among former smokers, and provide further insights into
the mechanisms of cigarette smoke on reproductive health.
