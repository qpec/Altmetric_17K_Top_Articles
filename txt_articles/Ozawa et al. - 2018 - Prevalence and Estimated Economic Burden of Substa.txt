Abstract
IMPORTANCE Substandard and falsified medicines burden health systems by diverting resources to
ineffective or harmful therapies, causing medical complications and prolonging illnesses. However,
the prevalence and economic impact of poor-quality medicines is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence and
estimated economic burden of substandard and falsified essential medicines in low- and middle-
income countries.
DATA SOURCES Five databases (PubMed, EconLit, Global Health, Embase, and Scopus) were
searched from inception until November 3, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION Publications were assessed to determine whether they examined medicine
quality and the prevalence and/or economic burden of substandard and falsified medicines in low-
and middle-income countries. Studies with a sample size of 50 or more were included in the meta-
analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The study is registered in PROSPERO and reported via the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines.
Study quality was assessed using an adapted Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines scoring
metric. Multiple reviewers conducted the data extraction and quality assessment independently.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence and/or estimated economic impact of substandard
and falsified medicines.
RESULTS Two hundred sixty-five studies that estimated the prevalence of poor-quality essential
medicines in low- and middle-income countries were identified. Among 96 studies that tested 50
samples or more (67 839 total drug samples), overall prevalence of poor-quality medicines was
13.6% (95% CI, 11.0%-16.3%), with regional prevalence of 18.7% in Africa (95% CI, 12.9%-24.5%) and
13.7% in Asia (95% CI, 8.2%-19.1%). Of studies included in the meta-analysis, 19.1% (95% CI, 15.0%-
23.3%) of antimalarials and 12.4% (95% CI, 7.1%-17.7%) of antibiotics were substandard or falsified.
Eight approximations of the economic impact, focused primarily on market size, with poor or
undisclosed methods in estimation were identified, ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Poor-quality essential medicines are a substantial and
understudied problem. Methodological standards for prevalence and rigorous economic studies
estimating the burden beyond market size are needed to accurately assess the scope of the issue and

Key Points
Question What are the prevalence and
estimated economic burden of
substandard and falsified medicines in
low- and middle-income countries?
Findings In this systematic review of
265 studies comprising 400 647 drug
samples and meta-analysis of 96 studies
comprising 67 839 drug samples, the
prevalence of substandard and falsified
medicines in low- and middle-income
countries was 13.6% overall (19.1% for
antimalarials and 12.4% for antibiotics).
Data on the estimated economic impact
were limited primarily to market size
and ranged widely from $10 billion to
$200 billion.
Meaning Substandard and falsified
medicines are a substantial health and
economic problem; a concerted global
effort is needed to secure the global
supply chain, increase quality control
capacity, and improve surveillance to
better assess the problem and identify
solutions.

Introduction
Increasing access to essential medicines is integral to the effort to reduce global morbidity and
mortality.1 While access and health outcomes have generally improved in recent decades, these
efforts face a serious obstacle from the threat of substandard and falsified (SF) medicines.2-4 Poor-
quality medicines increase risks of morbidity and mortality by prolonging illnesses and heighten the
risk of treatment failure, poisoning, and adverse drug interactions.5,6 Circulation of SF medicines
with little clinical effectiveness also places entire communities at risk of drug resistance, posing a
threat to global treatment effectiveness, as well as undermining people’
s overall trust in the health
system and its legitimate health care professionals.5-9 Over time, diminished trust in licensed health
care professionals may further encourage informal care-seeking and self-medication.10 Poor health
outcomes can also erode trust in the manufacturers of genuine pharmaceutical products, which are
often challenging to distinguish from SF ones without the use of verification technologies.11
The risks posed by these medicines extend beyond health outcomes.6 Poor-quality medicines
cause increased costs for patients and the health system.5,6 Some of these costs, such as resources
wasted on ineffective therapies and treating additional complications, are borne primarily by
consumers and health facilities.5,6 Others, such as decreased economic productivity resulting from
prolonged illness, reduced sales and tax revenue, and costs of anticounterfeiting initiatives, are
borne by governments, companies, the pharmaceutical industry, donors, and society as a whole.5,6,12
Furthermore, SF medicines purchased through the use of personal savings, sale of assets, or
borrowing can lead people into poverty.5
Substandard and falsified medicines are a complex but critical global health issue.3,5,6,9 The
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 10.5% of medicines worldwide are substandard or
falsified.5 Furthermore, most of the burden falls on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
because of poor pharmaceutical governance, weak technical capacity, and poor supply-chain
management.6,13 Until recently, the efforts to combat SF medicines have been fragmented because
of the complexity of the issue and intellectual property rights disputes.14 In 2017, in an effort to draw
the issue away from intellectual property rights and reframe it solely as a public health issue, the
World Health Assembly officially adopted the term substandard and falsified to replace the previous
term, substandard/spurious/falsely labeled/falsified/counterfeit (SSFFC).15 Substandard medicines
are officially defined as “
authorized medical products that fail to meet either their quality standards
or specification, or both”and may result through poor manufacturing, shipping or storage conditions,
or when the drug is sold beyond the expiration date.14 Falsified medicines are defined as “medical
products that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source.”
14
This issue not only has significant health and economic consequences, but directly threatens
global health security and efforts to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.8, to
achieve universal access to safe and effective essential medicines.1,5 Despite this, the full extent of
the problem is unclear.5,6 Furthermore, research efforts to examine the issue have often faced poor
methodological quality and exhibited high amounts of variability.16 To address these issues, we
systematically reviewed and analyzed the existing evidence to assess the prevalence and estimated
economic burden of SF essential medicines across LMICs.

 Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, 5 databases were searched: PubMed, EconLit, Global
Health, Embase, and Scopus. A research librarian was consulted to aid in the creation of 2 separate
searches and ensure all relevant studies were identified. The first search used terms related to
“
substandard and falsified medicines”(incorporating SSFFC terms) and the second, “
quality of
medicine.”Both searches were run with terms associated with “low- and middle-income countries.”
Additional articles were incorporated through systematic searches of the WHO Essential Medicines
and Health Products Information Portal,17 the United States Pharmacopeial Convention Medicines
Quality Database,18 publications in the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network database,19 and
references of included articles and pertinent literature reviews.3,5,20-29 The comprehensive search
strategy and terminology as well as a list of additional sources searched are presented in eAppendix 1
in the Supplement. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered in the PROSPERO
database and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Institutional review board approval was not required
as this study did not involve human subjects research.
The primary eligibility criteria for this systematic review were that the article examined the
quality of essential medicines, the prevalence of SF medicines, and/or the economic impact of SF
medicines. Economic impact is defined broadly as any economic estimate associated with the
manufacture, trade, sale, or consumption of SF medicines. Peer-reviewed articles in English, Chinese,
French, Portuguese, Spanish, or German published before November 3, 2017, were included in the
review. All study locations not in LMICs, as classified as the World Bank at the time of review, were
excluded. Abstract-only publications, correspondence without data, studies of medicines that are
not classified as essential medicines by the WHO,30 case reports, and publications that did not
include sample sizes of tested medicines were also excluded.
All unique articles were independently assessed by 3 of us (D.G.H., S.B., and D.R.E.) based on
title and abstract. Those marked for inclusion, or whose title and abstract were not sufficient to
determine inclusion, were then reviewed using the full text. Any discrepancies between reviewers
were resolved by a third party (S.O.). Full-text records were sought and obtained through the library
systems of 3 major US research universities. Selected articles were then categorized into 1 or both
of 2 groups: (1) primary prevalence studies and/or (2) articles containing an estimate of
economic impact.
Four of us (D.G.H., S.B., S.K.L., and D.R.E.) independently conducted the data extraction with
oversight by a third party (S.O.). Data describing prevalence, type of medicines, country setting, and
sample size were extracted from all included primary prevalence studies. Studies were grouped
according to the following categories: type of medicines tested, sample size, continent, and year of
publication.
Studies including an estimate of economic impact were compiled separately and data were
extracted on estimate source, period of analysis, geographic scope, target medicine, and estimated
economic impact. Citation mining was conducted to determine the root sources of the cited
statistics. For every estimate of economic impact, we noted the root source, type of literature, and
methods used, or recorded that the root source was untraceable if it could not be traced back.
The meta-analysis of the prevalence of SF medicines focused on studies that tested 50 samples
or more and adequately reported sampling and testing methods to ensure the rigor of prevalence
estimates. Studies that did not report primary data, included previously reported data, or included
data from regulatory laboratories that only tested suspected medicines were excluded from the
meta-analysis. Where available, uncertainty ranges or minimum to maximum prevalence were noted
alongside summary statistics. Mean prevalence across studies—weighted by sample size and
Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines (MEDQUARG) score16 using a random-effects
model—was determined overall and by world region. Mean weighted prevalence was also assessed
across subcategorizations of 8 study characteristics: sample size, publication year, sampling method,

 purchasing method, chemical analysis, chemical testing method, conflict of interest, and
MEDQUARG score. The prevalence for each subcategorization was compared with the overall
prevalence with a 1-sample t test and with the subgroup gold standard by an unequal variances t test.
Overall uncertainty ranges were estimated using a 95% confidence interval based on the calculated
standard deviation.
Additional data were extracted for these studies in the meta-analysis, including methods of
sampling, purchasing, and pharmaceutical quality analysis. Sampling methods were categorized as
random, convenience, survey-based, or not specified; purchasing method was categorized by use of
mystery clients, using overt methods, or not specified; and pharmaceutical quality analysis was
categorized by the specific chemical analyses. Additionally, each study was assessed to determine
whether it (1) examined the actual presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), (2) assessed
the quantity or percentage of the APIs, and/or (3) looked for other ingredients (excipients and other
analytes). Use of Raman spectrometry, any mention of impurities, or highlighting unknown peaks in
chromatographs were counted as searching for other ingredients.
To assess the quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis, studies were independently
examined by 2 of us (D.R.E. and S.K.L.) according to MEDQUARG.16 Each study was assigned a
12-point MEDQUARG score adapted by Almuzaini and colleagues20 with scores of 6 or greater being
considered acceptable quality. The interrater reliability was assessed between the 2 reviewers and,
where possible, the original Almuzaini scores using the Spearman ρ. Additional information about the
MEDQUARG scoring metric, this study’
s reported MEDQUARG scores (eTable 1 in the Supplement),
and results of the interrater reliability assessments are presented in eAppendix 2 in the Supplement.
Additionally, studies included in the meta-analysis were analyzed for potential conflict of interest by
examining the articles’author statements, funding source, and/or institutional affiliations for a direct
partisan or industry relationship. Studies with a description of funding source with no apparent
partisan or industry affiliation were considered free of potential conflict of interest. Other studies
that did not include a funding source and had no discernable industry author affiliations were
categorized as unclear.
Study heterogeneity was evaluated using a random-effects model and reported using the
Cochran Q and I2. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot analysis (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement) with a regression test for funnel plot asymmetry. Baujaut and influence plot analyses
(eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement) were conducted to examine which articles contributed the
most heterogeneity. A mixed-effects model was used to test for potential modifiers. The results of
these analyses are included in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement. All analyses were made using R
statistical software version 3.3.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing).31
Results
Systematic Review
Our searches yielded a total of 4284 citations, of which 3164 were unique and screened based on
title and abstract. The full text was assessed for 754 articles. We identified 265 primary data
collection studies that sought to determine the prevalence of SF essential medicines in LMICs
(Figure 1). Studies not included in the meta-analysis are shown in eReferences 1 in the Supplement.
Globally, data on SF medicines in LMICs came primarily from articles focused on Africa (133
studies [50.2%]) and Asia (90 studies [34.0%]). Eight studies (3.0%) covered countries in South
America, while 3 studies (1.1%) tested samples from each of Europe, North America, and Oceania.
Twenty-five studies (9.4%) tested samples from multiple continents. More than half of the 265
prevalence studies (157 [59.2%]) were published in this decade (2010-present) with 63 (23.8%)
published in the last 3 years (2015-2017). Antimalarials (117 studies [44.2%]) and antibiotics (104
studies [39.2%]) were the most commonly examined medicines, including 35 studies (13.2%) that
investigated both. The total number of samples tested was 400 647, with a median (interquartile

 CI, 11.0%-16.3%). Regional prevalence estimates ranged from 18.7% in Africa (95% CI, 12.9%-24.5%)
to 13.7% in Asia (95% CI, 8.2%-19.1%) and 14.4% (95% CI, 0%-33.2%) for other single-region studies.
Studies that tested samples across multiple continents observed a lower average prevalence, with a
pooled prevalence of 11.6% (95% CI, 5.8%-17.5%). The average prevalence of SF medicines was 19.1%
(95% CI, 15.0%-23.3%) for antimalarials and 12.4% (95% CI, 7.1%-17.7%) for antibiotics. Table 1
presents the data extracted from these studies grouped by medication class. A map of the calculated
national prevalence of SF medicines is presented in Figure 3 (eFigures 4-7 in the Supplement present
the reported prevalence of SF medicines by each study in the meta-analysis grouped by region).
Table 2 presents the summary statistics and weighted prevalence of the subcategorizations of
8 study characteristics in the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis of the association between the mean
SF prevalence of each subcategorization and the overall prevalence (13.6%) found studies with
smaller sample sizes to report significantly higher mean prevalence (sample size 50-99: mean
prevalence, 34.4%; P = .001 and sample size 100-249: mean prevalence, 31%; P < .001). Conversely,
the prevalence of studies that used convenience sampling (7.1%; P = .001) or survey sampling (2.3%;
P = .009) and those that analyzed samples with the Global Pharma Health Fund’
s Minilab, a mobile
minilaboratory suitcase, were found to be significantly lower (7.7%; P < .001) than the overall
prevalence of 13.6%.
To further examine the association between methodological quality of the studies and the
reported SF prevalence, we statistically compared the mean prevalence of SF medicines for each of
the 8 subcategorizations with the gold standard for each study characteristic. Small sample sizes and
less rigorous sampling methods resulted in significant differences from the categorical gold standard
of larger sample sizes (7.0%) and randomized sampling (17.4%). The mean prevalence of studies with
potential conflict of interest (9.3%) was also significantly lower than both the overall prevalence
(13.6%; P = .01) and studies without discernable conflict of interest (14.2%; P = .03). Interestingly,
the mean SF prevalence of studies with adequate reporting quality (MEDQUARG score �6; 15.9%)
was 5% higher than studies with a lower quality score (10.9%) but not significantly so (P = .07).
A random-effects model was used to examine studies for heterogeneity and publication bias.
Studies in the meta-analysis indicate large amounts of heterogeneity (I2 = 99.9%), and the
regression test for funnel plot asymmetry indicates publication bias (P < .001). A mixed-effects
model was used to test for 8 different potential modifiers where sample size was found to be the only
significant modifier (P = .04) (eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).
Economic Evidence and Estimated Impact
Our search for economic impact estimates yielded 65 unique records with each citing 1 or more of 17
different estimates of the economic effect of SF medicines. Three of these estimates were found to
be citation errors, 4 did not estimate total economic impact or market size, and the root sources of 2
were untraceable, resulting in 8 economic estimates.
eTable 3 in the Supplement presents the original sources of the 8 economic estimates, primarily
of market size, ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion annually (median, $31.25 billion). Of the 8
estimates traced back to their origin,5,128-134 many were old and based on crude calculations by
authors without methodological disclosure. Four estimates came from reports from international or
intergovernmental organizations but 3 did not note how the estimates were derived. Three
estimates were introduced as a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation in a peer-reviewed journal
and 2 sources were potentially partisan involving a moderator’
s guide from a think tank and
a book.129,134
Discussion
Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that 13.6% of essential medicines
tested in LMICs failed quality analysis. The highest prevalence of poor-quality medicines was
observed in Africa, where 18.7% of samples were substandard or falsified. Deficiencies in quality

needed to understand the quality profile of other essential medicines.
These findings are similar to the estimated prevalence from a 2017 report by the WHO5 and
consistent with ranges reported in other reviews.3,20-29 All studies within these reviews that met our
inclusion criteria were included in our review; the slight variance between our results and those of

 previous analyses is likely due to these reviews including studies with small sample sizes as well as
the sheer amount of study heterogeneity.
This review identified a significant amount of study heterogeneity and potential issues of
quality of the prevalence data reported in publications. This is a significant issue as poor-quality
prevalence data affect analyses of the health and economic effects of SF medicines as well as crucial
policy and regulatory efforts to address the issue.6 Unfortunately, controversy over the role of
industry in defining the problem of SF medicines has slowed global efforts to address this issue in
recent decades.6,14 The International Medical Products Anti-counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT),
established by the WHO in 2006, disbanded over perceived industry connections, and intellectual
property concerns waylaid the agreement on the definition of SF medical products.135 Concerns that
anticounterfeiting efforts could adversely affect the legitimate generic drug industry—essential for
access to medicines in LMICs—have been central to the debate.136 This dispute has distracted from
the public health and socioeconomic consequences as well as efforts to accurately assess the scope
of the issue. As a result, efforts have been disjointed, and numerous studies with small sample sizes
that do not use rigorous randomization, collection, and analysis methods have been conducted.
This review also identifies a significant gap in the literature on the economic burden of SF
medicines due to the poor-quality of reported economic estimates and limited focus, primarily on
market size. Robust economic analysis capturing the broader economic burden of SF medicines, such
as additional costs of treatment and productivity losses, is critical to understanding the extent of the
problem, raising awareness, developing intervention strategies, and fostering change. Future
economic research is important to inform efforts to combat the falsification of medications and
should be conducted following rigorous economic methods.137,138
As demonstrated in the results of our prevalence subgroup analysis, use of less rigorous
research, analysis, and reporting methods is detrimental to efforts to assess the scope of the issue
because of the number of biases they introduce.5,16,139 Studies aiming to support policy development
should therefore follow rigorous standards of sampling, analysis, reporting, and disclosure. While
metrics such as MEDQUARG exist to guide in the reporting of studies of the prevalence of SF
medicines, greater effort and emphasis need to be placed on researching and standardizing
international sampling, collection, and analysis protocols.5,16,139 Improving quality control and
laboratory capacity in LMICs is also crucial as the GPHF-Minilab that is used in these settings in lieu of
full pharmacopeial analysis has poor sensitivity to detect substandard medicines.11,67,123,140
Furthermore, to ensure that these efforts bear fruit, greater transparency is needed in the disclosure

 of industry-related potential conflicts of interest. This heterogeneity in findings serves to caution
against extrapolating SF prevalences to other regions and across medicine categories.
Countries with weak pharmaceutical governance and poor pharmacovigilance are at the
greatest risk from SF medications.6,141,142 Weak regulatory capacity to license manufacturers, ensure
good manufacturing practices, and perform quality control encourages the illicit manufacture and
distribution of SF medications.142 Poor supply chain management and surveillance not only open the
door to allow SF medicines to permeate the supply chain, but also cause stock-outs that drive
patients to purchase medicines from unregulated markets.142 Therefore, efforts to improve supply-
chain management, surveillance, and regulatory capacity in LMICs are essential to reduce the threat
of SF medicines. The successes of the Promoting the Quality of Medicines and the WHO prequalified
drug programs demonstrate that these efforts can reduce the prevalence of SF medicines.137
While the effects of SF medications disproportionately rest on LMICs, SF medicines originate
from and are reported in every country worldwide.6,142 The global nature of the medicine supply
chain implies that weaknesses in any country in the supply chain affect all the countries
downstream.142-144 This threatens global health security by increasing transmission, morbidity,
mortality, and antimicrobial resistance, highlighting the need for a unified global effort to address the
issue.142-144 In 2013, the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System was launched to gather
data, improve reporting, and strengthen regulatory capacity globally.6 While this is an important first
step, additional efforts to implement laws on drug quality and improve data sharing among
stakeholders are essential to complement research and technical initiatives.144 Nayyar et al145 have
called for an international convention on SF medicines, similar to the 1929 treaty that internationally
criminalized counterfeit banknotes or the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.146,147 Such a
convention could (1) accurately define SF medicines, (2) require signatory countries to enact national
laws (and consequent prosecution penalties) criminalizing intentional manufacture, trafficking, or
selling of SF medicines, (3) provide a legal and institutional framework on convergent medicine
regulation, and (4) provide LMICs with financial and technical assistance to effectively join local and
regional SF medicine regulatory networks. Without such concerted global effort, the global supply
chain, and thereby every country within it, remains vulnerable to SF medicines.
Limitations
Systematic reviews are inherently limited by their search strategies, databases searched, and the
inclusion and exclusion criteria selected.148 To address this limitation, we ran 2 searches, performed
a systematic reference review, and examined other pertinent database sources. Furthermore, as with
all meta-analyses, ours is limited by the quality of the included studies and any biases they may
contain.148 As demonstrated by the high amount of heterogeneity, the summary statistics reported
in this study reflect a wide range of studies and methods, and as a result are subject to various
limitations. For studies involving multiple medicines and countries, only the total sample size was
included in the prevalence calculations. It is therefore possible that the regional variation observed is
explained by differences in sample size by medicine, or that the variation by medicines is explained
by the geographic distribution of samples. Differences in study quality, sampling, or purchasing and
collection method across regions and medicine categories may have also introduced bias. To control
for these potential sources of bias, we selected studies that tested 50 or more samples and removed
studies with very poor sampling methods or no description of study methods. To further ensure the
rigor of our reported prevalence estimates, each study prevalence was weighted by sample size and a
metric that assessed the quality of the reported studies. Quality analyses indicate that there is
significant publication bias as well as a moderating effect of sample size, even after controlling for it,
which demonstrates the significance of rigorous sampling methods. Finally, reported economic
impact estimates are limited by the poor quality and large heterogeneity of available data. Despite
these limitations, we believe we appropriately controlled for bias to the best of our ability and have
identified and synthesized articles in a systematic and methodical manner.

 Conclusions
Our findings suggest that SF essential medicines are a substantial and understudied problem in
LMICs with high estimated economic impact. Reducing their prevalence is imperative to the Global
Health Security Agenda, reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and global
efforts to curb antimicrobial resistance.1,149 Although the literature on prevalence continues to grow,
methodological standards are needed to improve generalizability and facilitate comparison across
studies. Precise, independent estimates are also needed to describe the health and economic effects
of poor-quality medicines to build the evidence base for successful policy interventions to curb SF
medicines in LMICs. Efforts to strengthen supply-chain management, surveillance, and regulatory
capacity are essential to effectively control SF medicines. Globalization necessitates global
coordination across national, regional, and sectoral stakeholders to improve the regulation,
standardization, and surveillance of the quality of medicines worldwide.
