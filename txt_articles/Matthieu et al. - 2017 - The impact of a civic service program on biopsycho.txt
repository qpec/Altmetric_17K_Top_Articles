Abstract
Volunteering as a health promotion intervention, improves physical health, mental health, and 
social outcomes particularly in older adults, yet limited research exists for veterans. We conducted 
a preliminary study to explore whether volunteering impacts a variety of biopsychosocial 
outcomes, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, among 
returning military veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. A survey enrolling a prospective cohort of 
United States (U.S.) veterans who served in the military after 11 September 2001 and who 
participated in a national civic service program was conducted. A total of 346 veterans completed 
standardized health, mental health, and psychosocial self-report measures before and after the 
program. Statistically significant differences were detected in overall health rating, level of 
emotional difficulty, PTSD and depression symptoms, purpose in life, self-efficacy, social 
isolation, and the perceived availability of social support at program completion. Screening 
positive for probable PTSD predicted improved perceived self-efficacy while probable depression 
predicted a decrease in loneliness, an increase in purpose in life, and an increase in perceived 
social support, at program completion. Volunteering was associated with significant improvements 
in health, mental health and social outcomes in returning veterans.

 1. Introduction
Among American military veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi 
Freedom (OIF), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common 
diagnoses (Vaughan, et al., 2014). PTSD and depression are associated with increases in 
unhealthy behaviors (Tanielian, et al., 2008), medical services use (Schnurr and Jankowski, 
1999), and negative impacts on family and social functioning (Cohen et al., 2010; Tanielian 
et al., 2008). In addition to health concerns, veterans reintegrating into civilian life following 
deployment, disability, or completion of military service, potentially face numerous hurdles. 
These hurdles include personal, professional, and financial challenges such as changes in 
family roles, rebuilding social networks, and unemployment, which may exacerbate 
symptoms. Unfortunately, many veterans with mental health symptoms do not seek 
treatment. In a national survey of OEF/OIF veterans, almost half of those with a positive 
PTSD or depression screen reported no mental health care use within the prior year 
(Tanielian et al., 2008). Research on health care barriers and preferences of OEF/OIF 
veterans with PTSD shows that negative treatment beliefs and stigma remain barriers to care. 
Alternatively, these same veterans express a desire for community services that are 
integrated, person-centered, and holistic (Crawford et al., 2015). These findings highlight 
that this generation of veterans may be interested in promoting health in new ways, more so 
than by engaging in traditional mental health care, to overcome challenges.
Volunteering has produced positive outcomes in civilians’ mortality rates, mental health, and 
social outcomes (Jenkinson et al., 2013). In one study, 40% of American adults who 
volunteered in the past year showed improvements in well-being: happiness, life satisfaction, 
self-esteem, mastery, health, and depression (Thoits and Hewitt, 2001). In older adult 
studies, volunteers significantly reduced their depression and mortality rates (Lum and 
Lightfoot, 2005; Musick, et al., 1999; Musick and Wilson, 2003) with concomitant increases 
in wellbeing with increased volunteering (Morrow-Howell, et al., 2003). Given these 
findings (Coorperation for National and Commmunity Service [CNCS], 2007), it could be 
posited that individuals who are leaving the military due to disability or retirement, might 
also benefit. However, there is currently no research on the effects of volunteering as a 
health promotion intervention among veterans. To our knowledge, this is the first national 
study of formal volunteering among U.S. military veterans who previously served in Iraq 
and Afghanistan and who participated in a formal civic service program after completing 
their career in the military service.
1.2. Study aims
We undertook a preliminary study to explore the biopsychosocial outcomes of participation 
in a national civic service program on OEF/OIF veterans. Using the stress-diathesis model to 
guide our selection of measures (Zubin and Spring, 1977), biopsychosocial outcomes were 
defined as physical, mental, and psychosocial functioning. Civic service was defined as 
participation in a formal, structured, and stipended volunteer program (McBride and 
Sherraden, 2007). Based on the results of previous literature, we hypothesized that civic 
service would (1) increase self-reports of purpose in life, self-efficacy, and social support, 
and (2) decrease reports of social isolation and loneliness, emotional health difficulties, and

 depressive symptoms among participants. However, given the complex psychosocial and 
health issues facing returning veterans and that PTSD and depression are characterized by 
avoidance and dysphoria, we proposed that civic service would not impact reports of overall 
health, physical health difficulties, or PTSD symptoms. With regard to the complexity of 
health issues and PTSD, we note that returning veterans have varying degrees of co-
occurring conditions, polytrauma, and chronic illnesses that may require ongoing surgery, 
rehabilitation, and therapy to resolve. Consequently, we proposed that overall health, 
physical health difficulties, and PTSD might remain unchanged without specifically targeted 
health and mental health interventions. However, with depression, the behavioral activation 
of going to volunteer each week with specific tasks and a purpose to contribute to the 
organization might naturally alleviate some of the dysphoric symptoms. Finally, we explored 
whether experiencing symptoms of PTSD and depression would impact the ability of 
participants to benefit from civic service in terms of purpose in life, self-efficacy, social 
support, and social isolation and loneliness. Due to the dearth of literature on the effects of 
these diagnoses on civic service, no a priori hypotheses were developed.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and intervention
Using an observational cohort design, we evaluated the impact of a civic service program 
administered by The Mission Continues, a national nonprofit organization in the U.S. The 
health promotion intervention evaluated in this study, the Fellowship Program, involved 
adults who previously served in the U.S. military after September 11, 2001 (subsequently 
referred to as post-9/11/01-era veterans) who volunteered for 20 hours per week for 26 
weeks at a local nonprofit organization in their hometown. Civic service is a rather unusual 
volunteering experience which McBride and Sherraden (2007) defined as a specific type of 
formal volunteering with an organization that typically provides an orientation, a stipend to 
offset living expenses, and a well-defined role and duration for the volunteering time. This is 
differentiated from less structured and occasional volunteering such as helping out at church 
or collecting food, thereby inferring greater intensity, duration, frequency, and accountability 
in the particular volunteer role and achievement of specific civic service related goals for the 
individual volunteer and the organization.
A detailed description of the measures, orientation and curriculum is found elsewhere 
(Matthieu, 2016; Matthieu, Lawrence, Gould, Scheinberg, in press), therefore a brief 
overview is provided here. The Fellowship Program begins with veterans completing 
leadership, networking, goal-setting, and autobiographical writing exercises (i.e., describe 
existing military service skills and apply to future service, education, or employment goals) 
for professional development during orientation. Following this orientation, a goal-setting 
curriculum is completed throughout the duration of the fellowship with peer mentorship 
from a member of The Mission Continues staff which coincides with the veterans’ civic 
service at a non-profit organization. Ethical approval was obtained from Saint Louis 
University’s Institutional Review Board.

 2.2. Participants and procedures
Agency staff recruited prospective participants for the civic service program in person, over 
the phone, and via the internet. Staff also collected eligibility information from prospective 
participants using intake forms. In order to be considered for the program, veterans must 
have served for a minimum of two years in the US military after September 11, 2001, 
although exceptions were made for veterans who served less than two years due to a medical 
discharge. Veterans are also expected to have an honorable discharge and a clean criminal 
record. However, the agency recognized that struggling with the transition to civilian life can 
coincide with substance abuse or becoming involved with the criminal justice system, and 
veterans with criminal records or other discharge status were considered on a case-by-case 
basis. Admitted veterans were asked to complete web-based surveys (i.e., within one week 
of program start and at the completion of the program). Data were collected by the agency 
and de-identified to the researchers.
Measures, described below, were not collected on those individuals who declined to 
participate, were not admitted to the program due to military service completion before 
September 11, 2001, had a criminal record or dishonorable discharge, and/or chose not to 
complete the program. The study sample was comprised of Fellowship Program completers 
between February 2011 and March 2014 who provided both surveys, before and after 
completion of the program (N = 346).
2.3. Measures
All measures were administered before and after the civic service program with the 
exception of demographics and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), which were obtained only at 
the start of the program. Two single categorical items were included to assess history of TBI 
and mental health treatment exposure: “Have you ever been diagnosed with or treated for a 
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)?” (yes/no) and “Are you currently seeking professional help 
for emotional problems (such as feeling depressed or anxious?” (yes/no).
2.3.1 Health—Perceived overall health was assessed using a standard military service 
personnel screening tool, the Post Deployment Health Re-Assessment (PDHRA) 
(Department of Defense, 2008): “Overall, how would you rate your health during the past 
month?” Responses were scored 1 = Excellent, 2 = Very Good, 3 = Good, 4 = Fair, and 5 = 
Poor. Perceived physical and emotional health difficulties were also assessed with the 
PDHRA (Department of Defense, 2008), “During the past month, how difficult have 
physical health problems (illness and injury) made it for you to do your work or other 
regular daily activities?” and “During the past month, how difficult have emotional problems 
(feeling depressed or anxious) made it for you to do your work, take care of things at home, 
or get along with other people?” Responses were scored 1 = Not difficult at all, 2 = 
Somewhat difficult, 3 = Very difficult, and 4 = Extremely difficult.
2.3.2 Mental Health—The Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD) (Prins et al., 2003) is a 
4-item screening measure assessing the presence of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 
IV-TR ([APA], 2000) PTSD symptoms in the past month: re-experiencing, avoidance, 
numbness, and arousal. The PC-PTSD is a validated psychometric screening measure with a

 diagnostic accuracy or efficiency score of 85%, analogous to that of longer PTSD measures 
(Brewin, 2005; Prins et al., 2003). Respondents indicated ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each item; total 
scores ranged from 0 to 4. A cut-off score of ≥ 2 designated PTSD symptoms of clinical 
significance (α = 0.88).
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) 
(Kroenke, et al., 2003), a 2-item screener composed of items one and two from the PHQ-9, a 
validated, shorter version of the full-length PHQ (Kroenke, et al., 2001; Kroenke et al., 
2003). The PHQ-2 asks about the frequency of anhedonia and depressed mood (Kroenke et 
al., 2003). Responses were scored 0 = Not at all, 1 = Few or several days, 2 = More than half 
the days, and 3 = Nearly every day; total scores ranged from 0 to 6. A cut-off score of ≥3 
indicates clinically significant depressive symptoms (α = 0.89).
2.3.3 Psychosocial—This domain consisted of four standardized and self-report 
measures. Purpose in Life (PIL), a 14-item subscale of the Scales of Psychological 
Wellbeing (Ryff and Keyes, 1995) assessed direction, meaning, and purpose in life. 
Responses were scored from 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree; summed scores 
ranged from 14 to 84. Higher scores indicated strong life goals or aims, while lower scores 
indicated an absence of a sense of direction, life purpose and meaning. (α = 0.86).
Self-efficacy was measured using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) (Schwarzer and 
Jerusalem, 1995), a 10-item scale that assessed self-efficacy related to minor daily stressors 
and major life events. Responses were scored 1 = Not at all true, 2 = Hardly true, 3 = 
Moderately true, and 4 = Exactly true; summed scores ranged from 10 to 40. Higher scores 
indicated stronger perceived self-efficacy (α = 0.93).
The UCLA Loneliness Scale, Version 3 (Russell, 1996), consisted of 20 items and assessed 
social isolation and loneliness. Responses were scored 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = 
Sometimes, and 4 = Always; summed scores ranged from 20 to 80. High scores indicated a 
higher degree of loneliness (α = 0.94).
Perceived availability of social support was assessed with the Interpersonal Support 
Evaluation List - short form (ISEL) (Cohen, et al., 1985), a 12-item scale. Responses were 
scored 1 = Definitely false, 2 = Probably false, 3 = Probably true, and 4 = Definitely true; 
summed scores ranged from 12 to 48. Higher scores indicated a higher degree of social 
support (α = 0.93).
2.4. Statistical analysis
PTSD and depression scores were treated as continuous data to calculate mean screening 
scores and for nonparametric testing. Categorical variables of ‘probable PTSD’ and 
‘probable depression’ were created using the established screening cut-off scores for 
frequencies and regression analyses (Kroenke et al., 2003; Prins et al., 2003).
Our first set of hypotheses examined the change in multiple psychosocial and health 
outcomes, before and after the program completion. Because data were not normally 
distributed, bivariate analyses of the two time-points (i.e., before and after program

 completion) were conducted with nonparametric tests. McNemar tests (continuity corrected) 
analyzed single-item measures and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests analyzed multi-item 
measures, with asymptotic significance reported. Means, standard deviations, and change 
scores were computed. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated using means from the 
change scores and pooled standard deviations. Multivariate analyses were conducted using 
change scores (continuous) as dependent variables due to our interest in the ability of 
preexisting mental health symptoms to predict change in the outcome measures.
Our final hypotheses examined whether experiencing symptoms of PTSD and depression 
would impact the ability of participants with these conditions to benefit from civic service. 
We performed four multiple linear regression analyses to model the relationship between the 
two binary independent variables, probable PTSD (yes/no) and probable depression (yes/
no), and the change scores for the four psychosocial dependent variables. In addition, the 
covariate of “seeking professional treatment” was included in the four regression models due 
to the possibility that mental health treatment outside of program participation could 
influence psychosocial outcomes. Note that the proportion of veterans seeking professional 
treatment for emotional problems before the program, 56.97% (184/323), had not changed 
significantly by the end of the program 56.04% (189/323; p = 0.80). Less than 7% of 
responses were missing in a given analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 22 
(IBM Corporation, 2013).
3. Results
Table 1 shows that the sample was predominantly male, under 40 years of age, married and 
slightly more than half identified as Caucasian. At the time of this study between February 
2011 and March 2014, approximately 88% of the sample reported that they served on an 
overseas deployment for which they received hazardous duty pay and the mean time from 
their last deployment was 5.88 years (SD=2.49). Half of the sample screened positive for 
probable PTSD (50.6%) and over a fifth (23.5%) for probable depression. Almost half 
(43.5%) of the sample reported receiving treatment for a mental health condition and almost 
20% reported a history of diagnosis or treatment for a TBI.
3.1. Impact of civic service on biopsychosocial outcomes
Table 2 shows the results of the McNemar tests to examine whether perceived health and 
mental health outcomes had significantly changed at program completion. We hypothesized 
that there would be no change in reports of overall health and physical health difficulties. 
The hypothesis that there would be no change in reports of level of daily interference due to 
physical health problems was supported; there was no significant change. We hypothesized 
that there would be no change in reporting of overall health; this hypothesis was rejected. 
The proportion of participants reporting good/excellent health increased from an initial value 
of 0.76 to 0.82 at program completion, a statistically significant difference, χ2(1) = 6.15, p = 
0.01.
We hypothesized that respondents would report decreased levels of difficulties in performing 
in everyday activities due to emotional health problems, following program completion. Our 
hypothesis was supported; the proportion of respondents who reported no/some emotional

 difficulty in everyday activities significantly increased from an initial value of 0.79 to 0.88 at 
program completion, χ2(1) = 10.45, p = 0.001.
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to examine the significance of median change 
scores on two mental health and four psychosocial health measures assessed before and after 
program completion (Table 2). We hypothesized that there would be no change in PTSD 
symptom scores across time; this hypothesis was rejected. The median change for PTSD 
symptom scores significantly decreased (d = 0.21). This was echoed in the decrease in 
individuals screening positive for probable PTSD, which fell from 50.6% (171/338) at the 
start of the program to 43.1% (144/334) at program completion (see Table 2 for more 
detailed statistics).
Depression symptom screening scores improved significantly (i.e. a significant decrease in 
scores) as hypothesized, and showed the greatest effect size out of the mental health 
outcomes (d = 0.23); the rate of participants screening positive fell from 23.5% (80/341) 
before the program to 15.0% (50/333) after program completion (see Table 2 for detailed 
statistics).
Our hypothesis that participants would improve on all psychosocial outcomes was 
supported. All four measures were marked by statistically significant improvements. Small 
effects were seen for ratings of belief that life holds purpose and meaning (d = -0.01) as well 
as perceived self-efficacy (d = -0.19). The greatest effects within the psychosocial domain 
occurred for perceived social isolation and loneliness which decreased (d = 0.27) and 
perceived availability of social support which increased (d = -0.25) at the end of the civic 
service program.
3.2. Influence of probable PTSD and depression on psychosocial outcomes
Multiple regression analyses tested whether screening positive for probable PTSD or 
depression before the intervention could predict changes in the four psychosocial outcome 
measures by the end of the program. The covariate of whether or not participants (reported 
before beginning the program) seeking professional experience for emotional problems was 
also included in these models due to the possible influence mental health treatment could 
have on improvement in psychosocial outcome variables. For these analyses, we calculated 
change scores by subtracting the score at the end of the program from the scores at the 
beginning of the program. If the score increased, then the resulting change value was 
negative, and therefore, the beta coefficients were negative. For example, an initial score of 
45 increased to 60; 60-45 = -15, so the negative beta coefficient is reflective of an increase 
over time.
In the psychosocial domain, probable depression significantly (p < 0.05) predicted changes 
in three outcome measures, specifically the belief that life holds purpose and meaning, 
loneliness, and social support by the end of the program. With regard to probable PTSD, it 
significantly (p < 0.05) predicted changes in one of the four outcome measures, namely, self-
efficacy by the end of the program. Regression coefficients and standard errors are listed in 
Table 3. When PTSD screening score and seeking professional experience variables were 
held constant in models for each of the four psychosocial outcome variables, screening

 positive for probable depression predicted a significant increase in the belief that life holds 
purpose and meaning (F (3, 318) = 6.72, adj. R2 =0.05), a significant decrease in loneliness, 
(F (3, 320) = 5.00, adj. R2 =0.04) and a significant increase in social support (F (3, 321) = 
6.04, adj. R2 =0.05) from program beginning to end. When depression score and seeking 
professional experience variables were held constant, a positive PTSD screen predicted an 
improvement in self-efficacy over time, (F (3,318) = 2.82, adj. R2 =0.02).
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this was the first investigation of the biopsychosocial impact of a civic 
service program on a large sample of community-dwelling returned U.S. military veterans. 
Overall, self-report measures across nine constructs within health, mental health, and 
psychosocial domains indicated that participating in this formal civic service program 
significantly improved veterans’ health and well-being upon completion of the program. The 
greatest impact within the mental health domain was a decrease in depressive symptoms 
upon program completion. Previous studies reported that volunteering decreased depression 
in civilian adults and elders (Lum and Lightfoot, 2005; Musick et al., 1999; Musick and 
Wilson, 2003; Thoits and Hewitt, 2001); our results suggest that the effects of civic service 
on reduction of depressive symptoms may extend to U.S. military veterans who served in the 
post-9/11/01-era.
To our knowledge, the effects of civic service on PTSD symptoms have not been previously 
studied. Contrary to our hypotheses, our results indicated OEF/OIF veterans who 
participated in civic service experienced decreased PTSD symptom severity. While clearly 
not a mental health intervention of the magnitude of evidence-based PTSD treatments, nor 
based on clinical assessment that maps on to the current psychiatric diagnostic criteria, these 
results suggest that civic service may be beneficial for OEF/OIF veterans with both PTSD 
and/or depressive symptoms.
All four psychosocial outcome measures showed statistically significant improvements at 
program completion. This has several connotations for psychological and physical well-
being among veterans. Feelings of loneliness, if untreated, are associated with increased 
mortality rates, lower cognitive functioning, less emotional wellbeing, and negative social 
behavioral outcomes (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010). Social support contributes to 
psychological and physical well-being with stress buffering effects that moderate the 
negative life-stress-health relationship (Cohen et al., 1985). In this study, OEF/OIF veterans 
reported a significant decrease in loneliness and an increase in social support which may aid 
reintegration into civilian life.
The psychosocial construct of a belief that life holds purpose and meaning also yielded 
statistically significant improvements. Consistent with the literature that showed a negative 
correlation between purpose in life and depression screening score (Ryff and Keyes, 1995), a 
positive depression score in our sample predicted a significant improvement in purpose in 
life, which strengthens our findings. Interestingly, the initial self-efficacy scores for 
participants in the present study were above the norm for those reported elsewhere for 
students, adults, and elders (Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995) indicating higher starting levels 
Matthieu et al.

 of self-efficacy in the sample, perhaps resulting from the training and challenges of military 
service. However, it also may be self-selection, in that veterans who agree to participate in 
this volunteer program may have higher levels of self-efficacy (or they would not agree to 
join).
Despite the initially high scores on this construct, self-efficacy increased for all participants 
after engaging in civic service, especially for those who started the program with PTSD 
screening scores suggestive of probable PTSD. Notably, self-efficacy has been identified as a 
focal mediator and independent contributor to recovery from a wide range of traumas, 
including military combat, leading to the recognition of the importance of one's belief in 
their ability to govern their posttraumatic condition to some degree and the impelling and 
protective qualities that belief affords (Benight and Bandura, 2004). The results here suggest 
that civic service strengthened these beliefs in the veteran participants in this study.
Interestingly, however, improvement in self-efficacy was not associated with high depression 
scores at the start of the program. Given that self-efficacy is an internal state suggesting core 
resources and strengths, it is possible that this measure was theoretically independent of the 
impact of depression. Due to the heightened prevalence of probable PTSD, and depression in 
this OEF/OIF veteran sample (Fulton et al., 2015; Ramchand et al., 2015), we hypothesized 
that these conditions may hinder veterans’ capacity to benefit from civic service. Findings 
reveal that all veterans in the civic service program experienced improvements in health, 
mental health, and social functioning. Importantly, even after controlling for current 
treatment, veterans with positive depression screens when entering the program benefited the 
most with significant improvements in purpose in life, enhanced social support, and 
decreased feelings of loneliness. Those screening positive for probable PTSD, again, after 
controlling for current treatment showed significant improvements in self-efficacy at 
program completion.
4.1. Limitations
This exploratory study provided a preliminary evaluation of the relationship between civic 
service and health, mental health, and social outcomes using valid and reliable psychometric 
instruments chosen according to the stress-diathesis model. However, several limitations 
remain. First, there is selection bias; the findings pertain only to those veterans who 
participated in, and completed, this program. Data were unavailable on those who did not 
participate or complete the program.
This was an observational, cohort study and not a randomized controlled trial. As such, 
changes observed at the completion of the civic service program could be attributed to other 
variables including time since deployment, resilience, and receipt of mental health treatment. 
Similarly, the impact of individual components of the program could not be assessed. For 
example, there were writing and goal setting assignments as part of the civic service 
curriculum. Various forms of narrative writing that specifically focus on a traumatic event 
have demonstrated efficacy in decreasing PTSD symptoms (see Sloan, Sawyer, Lowmaster, 
Wernick, and Marx, 2015) as well as other negative outcomes. However, it should be noted 
that the focus of the curriculum is on translating military skills to future goal setting as a 
civilian and not structured writing therapy, narrative exposure therapy, or expressive writing 
Matthieu et al.

 specifically focused on potentially traumatic events the individual may have experienced 
during military service.
Finally, we did not use gold-standard clinical diagnostic interviews but rather utilized single 
items, self-report screening measures, and screening cut off scores for mental and physical 
health outcomes. Other studies of OEF/OIF samples have demonstrated the persistence of 
mental health symptoms following deployment (Bliese et al., 2007; Milliken et al., 2007; 
Polusny et al., 2011; Sayer et al., 2010; Sundin et al., 2010)); the significant improvements 
reported here, even after controlling for current treatment, support our assertion that 
engagement in the civic service program contributed to reduction of these symptoms.
Despite these limitations, this exploratory study provides important initial data regarding 
veterans’ health using an observational cohort design. Detailed clinical assessments of 
mental health symptoms in future studies may reveal whether the health promotion impact 
of volunteering among veterans served as behavioral activation or if the increases in social 
support, purpose in life, or decreased loneliness buffered the negative impact of the 
depression symptoms.
4.2. Conclusions
Health promotion interventions for veterans are critically needed. Formal volunteering via a 
veteran-specific civic service program showed significant improvements in a range of 
biopsychosocial outcomes in returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, after controlling 
for current treatment, among those reporting PTSD and depressive symptomatology. Such 
programs may be of great benefit for the reintegration, health, and well-being of this 
population.
