Abstract 
Objective: To provide an update to “Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic 
Shock: 2012”.
Design: A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was con‑
vened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending 
the conference). A formal conflict‑of‑interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced 
throughout. A stand‑alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and 
electronic‑based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the 
development.
Methods: The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and 
ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as 
needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best avail‑
able evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommenda‑
tions as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

INTRODUCTION
Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by 
a dysregulated host response to infection [1–3]. Sepsis 
and septic shock are major healthcare problems, affect-
ing millions of people around the world each year, and 
killing as many as one in four (and often more) [4–6]. 
Similar to polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, or 
stroke, early identification and appropriate manage-
ment in the initial hours after sepsis develops improves 
outcomes.
The 
recommendations 
in 
this 
document 
are 
intended to provide guidance for the clinician caring 
for adult patients with sepsis or septic shock. Recom-
mendations from these guidelines cannot replace the 
clinician’s decision-making capability when presented 
with a patient’s unique set of clinical variables. These 
guidelines are appropriate for the sepsis patient in a 
hospital setting. These guidelines are intended to be 
best practice (the committee considers this a goal for 
clinical practice) and not created to represent standard 
of care.
METHODOLOGY
Below is a summary of the important methodologic con-
siderations for developing these guidelines.
Definitions
As these guidelines were being developed, new defini-
tions for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) were pub-
lished. Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ 
dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to 
infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with circula-
tory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction associated with 
a higher risk of mortality [3]. The Sepsis-3 definition 
also proposed clinical criteria to operationalize the new 
definitions; however, in the studies used to establish the 
evidence for these guidelines, patient populations were 
primarily characterized by the previous definition of sep-
sis, severe sepsis, and septic shock stated in the 1991 and 
2001 consensus documents [7].
History of the guidelines
These clinical practice guidelines are a revision of the 
2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the 
management of severe sepsis and septic shock [8, 9]. The 
initial SSC guidelines were first published in 2004 [10], 
and revised in 2008 [11, 12] and 2012 [8, 9]. The current 
iteration is based on updated literature searches incor-
porated into the evolving manuscript through July 2016. 
A summary of the 2016 guidelines appears in “Appendix 
1”
. A comparison of recommendations from 2012 to 2016 
appears in “Appendix 2”
. Unlike previous editions, the 
SSC pediatric guidelines will appear in a separate docu-
ment, also to be published by the Society of Critical Care 
Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive 
Care Medicine (ESICM).
Sponsorship
Funding for the development of these guidelines was 
provided by SCCM and ESICM. In addition, sponsor-
ing organizations provided support for their members’ 
involvement.
Selection and organization of committee members
The selection of committee members was based on 
expertise in specific aspects of sepsis. Co-chairs were 
appointed by the SCCM and ESICM governing bodies. 
Each sponsoring organization appointed a representative 
who had sepsis expertise. Additional committee mem-
bers were appointed by the co-chairs and the SSC Guide-
lines Committee Oversight Group to balance continuity 
and provide new perspectives with the previous commit-
tees’ membership as well as to address content needs. A 
patient representative was appointed by the co-chairs. 
Methodologic expertise was provided by the GRADE 
Methodology Group.
Question development
The scope of this guideline focused on early manage-
ment of patients with sepsis or septic shock. The guide-
line panel was divided into five sections (hemodynamics, 
Results: The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of 
patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 
18 were best‑practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.
Conclusions: Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong 
recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have rela‑
tively weak support, evidence‑based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock 
are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventila-
tion). The group designations were the internal work 
structure of the guidelines committee. Topic selection 
was the responsibility of the co-chairs and group heads, 
with input from the guideline panel in each group. Pri-
oritization of the topics was completed by discussion 
through e-mails, teleconferences, and face-to-face meet-
ings. All guideline questions were structured in PICO 
format, which described the population, intervention, 
control, and outcomes.
Questions from the last version of the SSC guidelines 
were reviewed; those that were considered important 
and clinically relevant were retained. Questions that were 
considered less important or of low priority to clinicians 
were omitted, and new questions that were considered 
high priority were added. The decision regarding ques-
tion inclusion was reached by discussion and consensus 
among the guideline panel leaders with input from panel 
members and the methodology team in each group.
GRADE methodology was applied in selecting only 
outcomes that were considered critical from a patient’s 
perspective [13]. All PICO questions with supporting evi-
dence are presented in Supplemental Digital Content 1 
(ESM 1).
Search strategy
With the assistance of professional librarians, an inde-
pendent literature search was performed for each defined 
question. The panel members worked with group heads, 
methodologists, and librarians to identify pertinent 
search terms that included, at a minimum, sepsis, severe 
sepsis, septic shock, sepsis syndrome, and critical illness, 
combined with appropriate key words specific to the 
question posed.
For questions addressed in the 2012 SSC guidelines, 
the search strategy was updated from the date of the 
last literature search. For each of the new questions, an 
electronic search was conducted of a minimum of two 
major databases (e.g., Cochrane Registry, MEDLINE, or 
EMBASE) to identify relevant systematic reviews and 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
Grading of recommendations
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation (GRADE) system principles guided 
assessment of quality of evidence from high to very low 
and were used to determine the strength of recommen-
dations (Tables 1, 2) [14]. The GRADE methodology is 
based on assessment of evidence according to six catego-
ries: (1) risk of bias, (2) inconsistency, (3) indirectness, (4) 
imprecision, (5) publication bias, and (6) other criteria, 
followed by assessment of the balance between ben-
efit and harm, patients’ values and preferences, cost and 
resources, and feasibility and acceptability of the inter-
vention. The final recommendations formulated by the 
guideline panel are based on the assessment of these fac-
tors. The GRADE assessment of the quality of evidence is 
presented in Table 1.
RCTs begin as high-quality evidence that could be 
downgraded due to limitations in any of the aforemen-
tioned categories. While observational (nonrandomized) 
studies begin as low-quality evidence, the quality level 
could be upgraded on the basis of a large magnitude of 
effect or other factors. The GRADE methodology clas-
sifies recommendations as strong or weak. The factors 
influencing this determination are presented in Table 2. 
The guideline committee assessed whether the desir-
able effects of adherence would outweigh the undesirable 
effects, and the strength of a recommendation reflects the 
group’s degree of confidence in that balance assessment. 
Thus, a strong recommendation in favor of an interven-
tion reflects the panel’s opinion that the desirable effects 
of adherence to a recommendation will clearly outweigh 
the undesirable effects. A weak recommendation in favor 
of an intervention indicates the judgment that the desir-
able effects of adherence to a recommendation prob-
ably will outweigh the undesirable effects, but the panel 
is not confident about these trade-offs—either because 
some of the evidence is low quality (and thus uncertainty 
remains regarding the benefits and risks) or the benefits 
and downsides are closely balanced. A strong recommen-
dation is worded as “we recommend” and a weak recom-
mendation as “we suggest”
. An alphanumeric scheme was 
used in previous editions of the SSC guidelines. Table 3 
provides a comparison to the current grading system.
The implications of calling a recommendation strong 
are that most patients would accept that intervention 
and that most clinicians should use it in most situations. 
Circumstances may exist in which a strong recommenda-
tion cannot or should not be followed for an individual 
because of that patient’s preferences or clinical charac-
teristics that make the recommendation less applicable. 
These are described in Table 4. A strong recommenda-
tion does not imply standard of care.
A number of best practice statements (BPSs) appear 
throughout the document; these statements represent 
ungraded strong recommendations and are used under 
strict criteria. A BPS would be appropriate, for example, 
when the benefit or harm is unequivocal, but the evidence 
is hard to summarize or assess using GRADE method-
ology. The criteria suggested by the GRADE Working 
Group in Table 5 were applied in issuing BPSs [15].
 307
Voting process
Following formulation of statements through discussion 
in each group and deliberation among all panel members 
during face-to-face meetings at which the groups pre-
sented their draft statements, all panel members received 
links to polls created using SurveyMonkey, Inc. (Palo 
Alto, CA) to indicate agreement or disagreement with 
the statement, or abstention. Acceptance of a statement 
required votes from 75% of the panel members with an 
80% agreement threshold. Voters could provide feed-
back for consideration in revising statements that did not 
receive consensus in up to three rounds of voting.
Conflict‑of‑interest policy
No industry input into guidelines development occurred, 
and no industry representatives were present at any of 
the meetings. No member of the guidelines committee 
received honoraria for any role in the guidelines process.
The process relied solely on personal disclosure, and no 
attempt was made by the group to seek additional confir-
mation. The co-chairs, COI chair, and group heads adju-
dicated this to the best of their abilities.
On initial review, 31 financial COI disclosures and five 
nonfinancial disclosures were submitted by committee 
members; others reported no COI. Panelists could have

both financial and nonfinancial COI. Declared COI dis-
closures from 11 members were determined by the COI 
subcommittee to be not relevant to the guidelines con-
tent process. Fifteen who were determined to have COI 
(financial and nonfinancial) were adjudicated by a man-
agement plan that required adherence to SSC COI policy 
limiting discussion or voting at any committee meetings 
during which content germane to their COI was dis-
cussed. Five were judged as having conflicts that were 
managed through reassignment to another group as well 
as the described restrictions on voting on recommen-
dations in areas of potential COI. One individual was 
asked to step down from the committee. All panelists 
with COI were required to work within their group with 
full disclosure when a topic for which they had relevant 
COI was discussed, and they were not allowed to serve 
as group head. At the time of final approval of the docu-
ment, an update of the COI statement was required. No 
additional COI issues were reported that required further 
adjudication.

For pa�ents
Most individuals in this 
situa�on would want the 
recommended course of 
ac�on, and only a small 
propor�on would not.
The majority of individuals in 
this situa�on would want the 
suggested course of ac�on, 
but many would not.
For clinicians
Most individuals should 
receive the recommended 
course of ac�on. Adherence to 
this recommenda�on 
according to the guideline 
could be used as a quality 
criterion or performance 
indicator. Formal decision aids 
are not likely to be needed to 
help individuals make 
decisions consistent with their 
values and preferences.
Different choices are likely to 
be appropriate for different 
pa�ents, and therapy should 
be tailored to the individual 
pa�ent’s circumstances. These 
circumstances may include the 
pa�ent’s or family’s values and 
preferences.
For policy makers
The recommenda�on can be 
adapted as policy in most 
situa�ons, including for use as 
performance indicators.
Policy-making will require 
substan�al debates and 
involvement of many 
stakeholders. Policies are also 
more likely to vary between 
regions. Performance 
indicators would have to focus 
on the fact that adequate 
delibera�on about the 
management op�ons has 
taken place.

A summary of all statements determined by the 
guidelines panel appears in “Appendix 1”
. All evidence 
summaries and evidence profiles that informed the rec-
ommendations and statements appear in ESM 2. Links to 
specific tables and figures appear within the relevant text.
A. INITIAL RESUSCITATION
1. Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, 
and we recommend that treatment and resuscita-
tion begin immediately (BPS).
2. We recommend that, in the resuscitation from 
sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, at least 30 mL/kg 
of IV crystalloid fluid be given within the first 3 h 
(strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3. We recommend that, following initial fluid resus-
citation, additional fluids be guided by frequent 
reassessment of hemodynamic status (BPS).
 
Remarks Reassessment should include a thorough 
clinical examination and evaluation of available phys-
iologic variables (heart rate, blood pressure, arterial 
oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, 
urine output, and others, as available) as well as other 
noninvasive or invasive monitoring, as available.
4. We recommend further hemodynamic assess-
ment (such as assessing cardiac function) to 
determine the type of shock if the clinical exami-
nation does not lead to a clear diagnosis (BPS).
5. We suggest that dynamic over static variables be 
used to predict fluid responsiveness, where avail-
able (weak recommendation, low quality of evi-
dence).
6. We recommend an initial target mean arterial 
pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg in patients with 
septic shock requiring vasopressors (strong rec-
ommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
7. We suggest guiding resuscitation to normalize 
lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels as 
a marker of tissue hypoperfusion (weak recom-
mendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale Early effective fluid resuscitation is cru-
cial for stabilization of sepsis-induced tissue hypoper-
fusion or septic shock. Sepsis-induced hypoperfusion 
may be manifested by acute organ dysfunction and/
or ± decreased blood pressure and increased serum 
lactate. Previous iterations of these guidelines have 
recommended a protocolized quantitative resuscita-
tion, otherwise known as early goal-directed therapy 
(EGDT), which was based on the protocol published by 
Rivers [16]. This recommendation described the use of 
a series of “goals” that included central venous pressure 
(CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (Scvo2). This 
approach has now been challenged following the failure 
to show a mortality reduction in three subsequent large 
multicenter RCTs [17–19]. No harm was associated with 
the interventional strategies; thus, the use of the previous 
targets is still safe and may be considered. Of note, the 
more recent trials included less severely ill patients (lower 
baseline lactate levels, Scvo2 at or above the target value 
on admission, and lower mortality in the control group). 
Although this protocol cannot now be recommended 
from its evidence base, bedside clinicians still need guid-
ance as to how to approach this group of patients who 
have significant mortality and morbidity. We recom-
mend, therefore, that these patients be viewed as having 
a medical emergency that necessitates urgent assessment 
and treatment. As part of this, we recommend that initial

fluid resuscitation begin with 30 mL/kg of crystalloid 
within the first 3 h. This fixed volume of fluid enables 
clinicians to initiate resuscitation while obtaining more 
specific information about the patient and while await-
ing more precise measurements of hemodynamic status. 
Although little literature includes controlled data to sup-
port this volume of fluid, recent interventional studies 
have described this as usual practice in the early stages 
of resuscitation, and observational evidence supports the 
practice [20, 21]. The average volume of fluid pre-rand-
omization given in the PROCESS and ARISE trials was 
approximately 30 mL/kg, and approximately 2 L in the 
PROMISE trial [17–19]. Many patients will require more 
fluid than this, and for this group we advocate that fur-
ther fluid be given in accordance with functional hemo-
dynamic measurements.
One of the most important principles to understand in 
the management of these complex patients is the need 
for a detailed initial assessment and ongoing reevalua-
tion of the response to treatment. This evaluation should 
start with a thorough clinical examination and evalua-
tion of available physiologic variables that can describe 
the patient’s clinical state (heart rate, blood pressure, 
arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, 
urine output, and others as available). Echocardiography 
in recent years has become available to many bedside 
clinicians and enables a more detailed assessment of the 
causes of the hemodynamic issues [22].
The use of CVP alone to guide fluid resuscitation can 
no longer be justified [22] because the ability to predict 
a response to a fluid challenge when the CVP is within a 
relatively normal range (8–12 mm Hg) is limited [23]. The 
same holds true for other static measurements of right 
or left heart pressures or volumes. Dynamic measures of 
assessing whether a patient requires additional fluid have 
been proposed in an effort to improve fluid management 
and have demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy at pre-
dicting those patients who are likely to respond to a fluid 
challenge by increasing stroke volume. These techniques 
encompass passive leg raises, fluid challenges against 
stroke volume measurements, or the variations in systolic 
pressure, pulse pressure, or stroke volume to changes in 
intrathoracic pressure induced by mechanical ventilation 
[24]. Our review of five studies of the use of pulse pres-
sure variation to predict fluid responsiveness in patients 
with sepsis or septic shock demonstrated a sensitivity of 
0.72 (95% CI 0.61–0.81) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 
0.83–0.95); the quality of evidence was low due to impre-
cision and risk of bias (ESM 3) [24]. A recent multicenter 
study demonstrated limited use of cardiac function moni-
tors during fluid administration in the ICUs. Even though 
data on the use of these monitors in the emergency 
department are lacking, the availability of the devices and 
applicability of the parameters to all situations may influ-
ence the routine use of dynamic indices [22, 25].
MAP is the driving pressure of tissue perfusion. While 
perfusion of critical organs such as the brain or kidney may 
be protected from systemic hypotension by autoregulation 
of regional perfusion, below a threshold MAP, tissue per-
fusion becomes linearly dependent on arterial pressure. In 
a single-center trial [26], dose titration of norepinephrine 
from 65 to 75 and 85 mm Hg raised cardiac index (from 
4.7 ± 0.5 to 5.5 ± 0.6 L/min/m2) but did not change urinary 
flow, arterial lactate levels, oxygen delivery and consump-
tion, gastric mucosal Pco2, RBC velocity, or skin capillary 
flow. Another single-center [27] trial compared, in norep-
inephrine-treated septic shock, dose titration to maintain 
MAP at 65 mm Hg versus achieving 85 mm Hg. In this 
trial, targeting high MAP increased cardiac index from 
4.8 (3.8–6.0) to 5.8 (4.3–6.9) L/min/m2 but did not change 
renal function, arterial lactate levels, or oxygen consump-
tion. A third single-center trial [28] found improved micro-
circulation, as assessed by sublingual vessel density and the 
ascending slope of thenar oxygen saturation after an occlu-
sion test, by titrating norepinephrine to a MAP of 85 mm 
Hg compared to 65 mm Hg. Only one multicenter trial that 
compared norepinephrine dose titration to achieve a MAP 
of 65 mm Hg versus 85 mm Hg had mortality as a primary 
outcome [29]. There was no significant difference in mor-
tality at 28 days (36.6% in the high-target group and 34.0% 
in the low-target group) or 90 days (43.8% in the high-tar-
get group and 42.3% in the low-target group). Targeting a 
MAP of 85 mm Hg resulted in a significantly higher risk 
of arrhythmias, but the subgroup of patients with previ-
ously diagnosed chronic hypertension had a reduced need 
for renal replacement therapy (RRT) at this higher MAP. A 
recent pilot trial of 118 septic shock patients [30] suggested 
that, in the subgroup of patients older than 75 years, mor-
tality was reduced when targeting a MAP of 60–65 versus 
75–80 mm Hg. The quality of evidence was moderate (ESM 
4) due to imprecise estimates (wide confidence intervals). 
As a result, the desirable consequences of targeting MAP 
of 65 mm Hg (lower risk of atrial fibrillation, lower doses 
of vasopressors, and similar mortality) led to a strong rec-
ommendation favoring an initial MAP target of 65 mm Hg 
over higher MAP targets. When a better understanding of 
any patient’s condition is obtained, this target should be 
individualized to the pertaining circumstances.
Serum lactate is not a direct measure of tissue perfu-
sion [31]. Increases in the serum lactate level may repre-
sent tissue hypoxia, accelerated aerobic glycolysis driven 
by excess beta-adrenergic stimulation, or other causes 
(e.g., liver failure). Regardless of the source, increased 
lactate levels are associated with worse outcomes [32]. 
Because lactate is a standard laboratory test with pre-
scribed techniques for its measurement, it may serve as 
 312
a more objective surrogate for tissue perfusion as com-
pared with physical examination or urine output. Five 
randomized controlled trials (647 patients) have evalu-
ated lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with septic 
shock [33–37]. A significant reduction in mortality was 
seen in lactate-guided resuscitation compared to resusci-
tation without lactate monitoring (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.53–
0.84; low quality). There was no evidence for difference 
in ICU length of stay (LOS) (mean difference −1.51 days; 
95% CI −3.65 to 0.62; low quality). Two other meta-anal-
yses of the 647 patients who were enrolled in these trials 
demonstrate moderate evidence for reduction in mor-
tality when an early lactate clearance strategy was used, 
compared with either usual care (nonspecified) or with a 
Scvo2 normalization strategy [38, 39].
B. SCREENING FOR SEPSIS AND PERFORMANCE 
IMPROVEMENT
1. We recommend that hospitals and hospital sys-
tems have a performance improvement program 
for sepsis, including sepsis screening for acutely 
ill, high-risk patients (BPS).
Rationale Performance improvement efforts for sep-
sis are associated with improved patient outcomes [40]. 
Sepsis performance improvement programs should opti-
mally have multiprofessional representation (physicians, 
nurses, affiliate providers, pharmacists, respiratory thera-
pists, dietitians, administrators) with stakeholders from 
all key disciplines represented in their development and 
implementation. Successful programs should include pro-
tocol development and implementation, targeted metrics 
to be evaluated, data collection, and ongoing feedback 
to facilitate continuous performance improvement [41]. 
In addition to traditional continuing education efforts 
to introduce guidelines into clinical practice, knowledge 
translation efforts can be valuable in promoting the use of 
high-quality evidence in changing behavior [42].
Sepsis performance improvement programs can be 
aimed at earlier recognition of sepsis via a formal screen-
ing effort and improved management of patients once 
they are identified as being septic. Because lack of recog-
nition prevents timely therapy, sepsis screening is associ-
ated with earlier treatment [43, 44].
Notably, sepsis screening has been associated with 
decreased mortality in several studies [20, 45]. The imple-
mentation of a core set of recommendations (bundle) has 
been a cornerstone of sepsis performance improvement 
programs aimed at improving management [46]. Note 
that the SSC bundles have been developed separately from 
the guidelines in conjunction with an educational and 
improvement partnership with the Institute for Healthcare 
Improvement [46]. The SSC bundles that are based on 
previous guidelines have been adopted by the U.S.-based 
National Quality Forum and have also been adapted by 
the U.S. healthcare system’s regulatory agencies for pub-
lic reporting. To align with emerging evidence and U.S. 
national efforts, the SSC bundles were revised in 2015.
While specifics vary widely among different programs, a 
common theme is the drive toward improvement in com-
pliance with sepsis bundles and practice guidelines such 
as SSC [8]. A meta-analysis of 50 observational studies 
demonstrated that performance improvement programs 
were associated with a significant increase in compliance 
with the SSC bundles and a reduction in mortality (OR 
0.66; 95% CI 0.61–0.72) [47]. The largest study to date 
examined the relationship between compliance with the 
SSC bundles (based on the 2004 guidelines) and mortal-
ity. A total of 29,470 patients in 218 hospitals in the United 
States, Europe, and South America were examined over 
a 7.5-year period [21]. Lower mortality was observed in 
hospitals with higher compliance. Overall hospital mor-
tality decreased 0.7% for every 3 months a hospital par-
ticipated in the SSC, associated with a 4% decreased LOS 
for every 10% improvement in compliance with bundles. 
This benefit has also been shown across a wide geographic 
spectrum. A study of 1794 patients from 62 countries with 
severe sepsis (now termed “sepsis” after the Sepsis-3 defi-
nition [1] or septic shock demonstrated a 36–40% reduc-
tion of the odds of dying in the hospital with compliance 
with either the 3- or 6-h SSC bundles [48]. This recom-
mendation met the prespecified criteria for a BPS. The 
specifics of performance improvement methods varied 
markedly between studies; thus, no single approach to per-
formance improvement could be recommended (ESM 5).
C. DIAGNOSIS
1. We recommend that appropriate routine micro-
biologic cultures (including blood) be obtained 
before starting antimicrobial therapy in patients 
with suspected sepsis or septic shock if doing so 
results in no substantial delay in the start of anti-
microbials (BPS).
Remarks Appropriate routine microbiologic cultures 
always include at least two sets of blood cultures 
(aerobic and anaerobic).
Rationale Sterilization of cultures can occur within 
minutes to hours after the first dose of an appropriate 
antimicrobial [49, 50]. Obtaining cultures prior to the 
administration of antimicrobials significantly increases 
the yield of cultures, making identification of a pathogen 
more likely. Isolation of an infecting organism(s) allows 
for de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy first at the 
 313
point of identification and then again when susceptibili-
ties are obtained. De-escalation of antimicrobial therapy 
is a mainstay of antibiotic stewardship programs and is 
associated with less resistant microorganisms, fewer side 
effects, and lower costs [51]. Several retrospective stud-
ies have suggested that obtaining cultures prior to anti-
microbial therapy is associated with improved outcome 
[52, 53]. Similarly, de-escalation has also been associated 
with improved survival in several observational studies 
[54, 55]. The desire to obtain cultures prior to initiating 
antimicrobial therapy must be balanced against the mor-
tality risk of delaying a key therapy in critically ill patients 
with suspected sepsis or septic shock who are at signifi-
cant risk of death [56, 57].
We recommend that blood cultures be obtained prior to 
initiating antimicrobial therapy if cultures can be obtained 
in a timely manner. However, the risk/benefit ratio favors 
rapid administration of antimicrobials if it is not logisti-
cally possible to obtain cultures promptly. Therefore, in 
patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock, appropri-
ate routine microbiologic cultures should be obtained 
before initiation of antimicrobial therapy from all sites 
considered to be potential sources of infection if it results 
in no substantial delay in the start of antimicrobials. This 
may include blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, wounds, 
respiratory secretions, and other body fluids, but does not 
normally include samples that require an invasive proce-
dure such as bronchoscopy or open surgery. The decision 
regarding which sites to culture requires careful consid-
eration from the treatment team. “Pan culture” of all sites 
that could potentially be cultured should be discouraged 
(unless the source of sepsis is not clinically apparent), 
because this practice can lead to inappropriate antimi-
crobial use [58]. If history or clinical examination clearly 
indicates a specific anatomic site of infection, cultures of 
other sites (apart from blood) are generally unnecessary. 
We suggest 45 min as an example of what may be consid-
ered to be no substantial delay in the initiation of antimi-
crobial therapy while cultures are being obtained.
Two or more sets (aerobic and anaerobic) of blood cul-
tures are recommended before initiation of any new anti-
microbial in all patients with suspected sepsis [59]. All 
necessary blood cultures may be drawn together on the 
same occasion. Blood culture yield has not been shown 
to be improved with sequential draws or timing to tem-
perature spikes [60, 61]. Details on appropriate methods 
to draw and transport blood culture samples are enumer-
ated in other guidelines [61, 62].
In potentially septic patients with an intravascular 
catheter (in place >48 h) in whom a site of infection is not 
clinically apparent or a suspicion of intravascular cathe-
ter-associated infection exists, at least one blood culture 
set should be obtained from the catheter (along with 
simultaneous peripheral blood cultures). This is done 
to assist in the diagnosis of a potential catheter-related 
bloodstream infection. Data are inconsistent regarding 
the utility of differential time to blood culture positivity 
(i.e., equivalent volume blood culture from the vascular 
access device positive more than 2 h before the periph-
eral blood culture) in suggesting that the vascular access 
device is the source of the infection [63–65].
It is important to note that drawing blood cultures from 
an intravascular catheter in case of possible infection of 
the device does not eliminate the option of removing the 
catheter (particular nontunneled catheters) immediately 
afterward.
In patients without a suspicion of catheter-associated 
infection and in whom another clinical infection site is 
suspected, at least one blood culture (of the two or more 
that are required) should be obtained peripherally. How-
ever, no recommendation can be made as to where addi-
tional blood cultures should be drawn. Options include: 
(a) all cultures drawn peripherally via venipuncture, 
(b) cultures drawn through each separate intravascu-
lar device but not through multiple lumens of the same 
intravascular catheter, or (c) cultures drawn through 
multiple lumens in an intravascular device [66–70].
In the near future, molecular diagnostic methods may offer 
the potential to diagnose infections more quickly and more 
accurately than current techniques. However, varying tech-
nologies have been described, clinical experience remains 
limited, and additional validation is needed before recom-
mending these methods as an adjunct to or replacement for 
standard blood culture techniques [71–73]. In addition, sus-
ceptibility testing is likely to require isolation and direct test-
ing of viable pathogens for the foreseeable future.
D. ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY
1. We recommend that administration of IV antimi-
crobials be initiated as soon as possible after rec-
ognition and within 1 h for both sepsis and septic 
shock (strong recommendation, moderate quality 
of evidence; grade applies to both conditions).
Rationale The rapidity of administration is central to 
the beneficial effect of appropriate antimicrobials. In the 
presence of sepsis or septic shock, each hour delay in 
administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated 
with a measurable increase in mortality [57, 74]. Further, 
several studies show an adverse effect on secondary end 
points (e.g., LOS [75], acute kidney injury [76], acute lung 
injury [77], and organ injury assessed by Sepsis-Related 
Organ Assessment score [78] with increasing delays. 
Despite a meta-analysis of mostly poor-quality studies 
that failed to demonstrate a benefit of rapid antimicrobial 
 314
therapy, the largest and highest-quality studies support 
giving appropriate antimicrobials as soon as possible in 
patients with sepsis with or without septic shock [57, 74, 
79–81]. The majority of studies within the meta-analy-
sis were of low quality due to a number of deficiencies, 
including small study size, using an initial index time 
of an arbitrary time point such as emergency depart-
ment arrival, and indexing of outcome to delay in time 
to the first antimicrobial (regardless of activity against 
the putative pathogen) [82, 83]. Other negative studies 
not included in this meta-analysis are compromised by 
equating bacteremia with sepsis (as currently defined to 
include organ failure) and septic shock [84–87]. Many of 
these studies are also compromised by indexing delays 
to easily accessible but nonphysiologic variables such as 
time of initial blood culture draw (an event likely to be 
highly variable in timing occurrence).
While available data suggest that the earliest possible 
administration of appropriate IV antimicrobials follow-
ing recognition of sepsis or septic shock yields optimal 
outcomes, 1 h is recommended as a reasonable minimal 
target. The feasibility of achieving this target consistently, 
however, has not been adequately assessed. Practical 
considerations, for example, challenges with clinicians’ 
early identification of patients or operational complexi-
ties in the drug delivery chain, represent poorly studied 
variables that may affect achieving this goal. A number 
of patient and organizational factors appear to influence 
antimicrobial delays [88].
Accelerating appropriate antimicrobial delivery insti-
tutionally starts with an assessment of causes of delays 
[89]. These can include an unacceptably high frequency 
of failure to recognize the potential existence of sepsis or 
septic shock and of inappropriate empiric antimicrobial 
initiation (e.g., as a consequence of lack of appreciation of 
the potential for microbial resistance or recent previous 
antimicrobial use in a given patient). In addition, unrec-
ognized or underappreciated administrative or logistic 
factors (often easily remedied) may be found. Possible 
solutions to delays in antimicrobial initiation include 
use of “stat” orders or including a minimal time element 
in antimicrobial orders, addressing delays in obtaining 
blood and site cultures pending antimicrobial adminis-
tration, and sequencing antimicrobial delivery optimally 
or using simultaneous delivery of key antimicrobials, as 
well as improving supply chain deficiencies. Improving 
communication among medical, pharmacy, and nursing 
staff can also be highly beneficial.
Most issues can be addressed by quality improvement 
initiatives, including defined order sets. If antimicrobial 
agents cannot be mixed and delivered promptly from the 
pharmacy, establishing a supply of premixed drugs for 
urgent situations is an appropriate strategy for ensuring 
prompt administration. Many antimicrobials will not 
remain stable if premixed in a solution. This issue must 
be taken into consideration in institutions that rely on 
premixed solutions for rapid antimicrobial availability. In 
choosing the antimicrobial regimen, clinicians should be 
aware that some antimicrobial agents (notably β-lactams) 
have the advantage of being able to be safely adminis-
tered as a bolus or rapid infusion, while others require a 
lengthy infusion. If vascular access is limited and many 
different agents must be infused, drugs that can be 
administered as a bolus or rapid infusion may offer an 
advantage for rapid achievement of therapeutic levels for 
the initial dose.
While establishing vascular access and initiating 
aggressive fluid resuscitation are very important when 
managing patients with sepsis or septic shock, prompt 
IV infusion of antimicrobial agents is also a priority. This 
may require additional vascular access ports. Intraosse-
ous access, which can be quickly and reliably established 
(even in adults), can be used to rapidly administer the 
initial doses of any antimicrobial [90, 91]. In addition, 
intramuscular preparations are approved and available 
for several first-line β-lactams, including imipenem/
cilastatin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ertapenem. Sev-
eral additional first-line β-lactams can also be effectively 
administered intramuscularly in emergency situations if 
vascular and intraosseous access is unavailable, although 
regulatory approval for intramuscular administration for 
these drugs is lacking [92–94]. Intramuscular absorption 
and distribution of some of these agents in severe ill-
ness has not been studied; intramuscular administration 
should be considered only if timely establishment of vas-
cular access is not possible.
2. We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy 
with one or more antimicrobials for patients pre-
senting with sepsis or septic shock to cover all 
likely pathogens (including bacterial and poten-
tially fungal or viral coverage) (strong recom-
mendation, moderate quality of evidence).
3. We recommend that empiric antimicrobial ther-
apy be narrowed once pathogen identification 
and sensitivities are established and/or adequate 
clinical improvement is noted (BPS).
Rationale The initiation of appropriate antimicrobial 
therapy (i.e., with activity against the causative patho-
gen or pathogens) is one of the most important facets of 
effective management of life-threatening infections caus-
ing sepsis and septic shock. Failure to initiate appropriate 
empiric therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock 
is associated with a substantial increase in morbidity 
and mortality [79, 95–97]. In addition, the probability 
 315
of progression from gram-negative bacteremic infection 
to septic shock is increased [98]. Accordingly, the initial 
selection of antimicrobial therapy must be broad enough 
to cover all likely pathogens. The choice of empiric anti-
microbial therapy depends on complex issues related to 
the patient’s history, clinical status, and local epidemio-
logic factors. Key patient factors include the nature of the 
clinical syndrome/site of infection, concomitant underly-
ing diseases, chronic organ failures, medications, indwell-
ing devices, the presence of immunosuppression or other 
form of immunocompromise, recent known infection or 
colonization with specific pathogens, and the receipt of 
antimicrobials within the previous three months. In addi-
tion, the patient’s location at the time of infection acqui-
sition (i.e., community, chronic care institution, acute 
care hospital), local pathogen prevalence, and the suscep-
tibility patterns of those common local pathogens in both 
the community and hospital must be factored into the 
choice of therapy. Potential drug intolerances and toxicity 
must also be considered.
The most common pathogens that cause septic shock 
are gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive, and mixed 
bacterial microorganisms. Invasive candidiasis, toxic 
shock syndromes, and an array of uncommon pathogens 
should be considered in selected patients. Certain spe-
cific conditions put patients at risk for atypical or resist-
ant pathogens. For example, neutropenic patients are at 
risk for an especially wide range of potential pathogens, 
including resistant gram-negative bacilli and Candida 
species. Patients with nosocomial acquisition of infec-
tion are prone to sepsis with methicillin-resistant Staph-
ylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant 
Enterococci.
Historically, critically ill patients with overwhelming 
infection have not been considered a unique subgroup 
comparable to neutropenic patients for purposes of 
selection of antimicrobial therapy. Nonetheless, critically 
ill patients with severe and septic shock are, like neutro-
penic patients, characterized by distinct differences from 
the typical infected patient that impact on the optimal 
antimicrobial management strategy. Primary among 
these differences are a predisposition to infection with 
resistant organisms and a marked increase in frequency 
of death and other adverse outcomes if there is a failure 
of rapid initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy.
Selection of an optimal empiric antimicrobial regimen 
in sepsis and septic shock is one of the central deter-
minants of outcome. Survival may decrease as much as 
fivefold for septic shock treated with an empiric regimen 
that fails to cover the offending pathogen [95]. Because 
of the high mortality associated with inappropriate ini-
tial therapy, empiric regimens should err on the side 
of over-inclusiveness. However, the choice of empiric 
antimicrobial regimens in patients with sepsis and sep-
tic shock is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple 
table. Several factors must be assessed and used in deter-
mining the appropriate antimicrobial regimen at each 
medical center and for each patient. These include:
(a) The anatomic site of infection with respect to the 
typical pathogen profile and to the properties of indi-
vidual antimicrobials to penetrate that site.
(b) 
Prevalent pathogens within the community, hospital, 
and even hospital ward.
(c) The resistance patterns of those prevalent pathogens.
(d) 
The presence of specific immune defects such as 
neutropenia, splenectomy, poorly controlled HIV 
infection and acquired or congenital defects of 
immunoglobulin, complement or leukocyte function 
or production.
(e) Age and patient comorbidities including chronic ill-
ness (e.g., diabetes) and chronic organ dysfunction 
(e.g., liver or renal failure), the presence of invasive 
devices (e.g., central venous lines or urinary catheter) 
that compromise the defense to infection.
In addition, the clinician must assess risk factors for 
infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens including 
prolonged hospital/chronic facility stay, recent antimi-
crobial use, prior hospitalization, and prior colonization 
or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. The 
occurrence of more severe illness (e.g., septic shock) may 
be intrinsically associated with a higher probability of 
resistant isolates due to selection in failure to respond to 
earlier antimicrobials.
Given the range of variables that must be assessed, the 
recommendation of any specific regimen for sepsis and 
septic shock is not possible. The reader is directed to 
guidelines that provide potential regimens based on ana-
tomic site of infection or specific immune defects [67, 
99–109].
However, general suggestions can be provided. Since 
the vast majority of patients with severe sepsis and septic 
shock have one or more forms of immunocompromise, 
the initial empiric regimen should be broad enough to 
cover most pathogens isolated in healthcare-associated 
infections. Most often, a broad-spectrum carbapenem 
(e.g., meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin or doripenem) 
or extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor com-
bination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam or ticarcillin/
clavulanate) is used. However, several third- or higher-
generation cephalosporins can also be used, especially 
as part of a multidrug regimen. Of course, the specific 
regimen can and should be modified by the anatomic site 
of infection if it is apparent and by knowledge of local 
microbiologic flora.
 316
Multidrug therapy is often required to ensure a suf-
ficiently broad spectrum of empiric coverage initially. 
Clinicians should be cognizant of the risk of resistance 
to broad-spectrum β-lactams and carbapenems among 
gram-negative bacilli in some communities and health-
care settings. The addition of a supplemental gram-neg-
ative agent to the empiric regimen is recommended for 
critically ill septic patients at high risk of infection with 
such multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas, 
Acinetobacter, etc.) to increase the probability of at least 
one active agent being administered [110]. Similarly, 
in situations of a more-than-trivial risk for other resistant 
or atypical pathogens, the addition of a pathogen-specific 
agent to broaden coverage is warranted. Vancomycin, 
teicoplanin, or another anti-MRSA agent can be used 
when risk factors for MRSA exist. A significant risk of 
infection with Legionella species mandates the addition 
of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone.
Clinicians should also consider whether Candida spe-
cies are likely pathogens when choosing initial therapy. 
Risk factors for invasive Candida infections include 
immunocompromised 
status 
(neutropenia, 
chemo-
therapy, transplant, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver 
failure, chronic renal failure), prolonged invasive vas-
cular devices (hemodialysis catheters, central venous 
catheters), total parenteral nutrition, necrotizing pan-
creatitis, recent major surgery (particularly abdominal), 
prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, 
prolonged hospital/ICU admission, recent fungal infec-
tion, and multisite colonization [111, 112]. If the risk of 
Candida sepsis is sufficient to justify empiric antifun-
gal therapy, the selection of the specific agent should 
be tailored to the severity of illness, the local pattern 
of the most prevalent Candida species, and any recent 
exposure to antifungal drugs. Empiric use of an echino-
candin (anidulafungin, micafungin, or caspofungin) is 
preferred in most patients with severe illness, especially 
in those patients with septic shock, who have recently 
been treated with other antifungal agents, or if Candida 
glabrata or Candida krusei infection is suspected from 
earlier culture data [100, 105]. Triazoles are acceptable 
in hemodynamically stable, less ill patients who have not 
had previous triazole exposure and are not known to be 
colonized with azole-resistant species. Liposomal formu-
lations of amphotericin B are a reasonable alternative to 
echinocandins in patients with echinocandin intolerance 
or toxicity [100, 105]. Knowledge of local resistance pat-
terns to antifungal agents should guide drug selection 
until fungal susceptibility test results, if available, are 
received. Rapid diagnostic testing using β-d-glucan or 
rapid polymerase chain reaction assays to minimize inap-
propriate anti-Candida therapy may have an evolving 
supportive role. However, the negative predictive value 
of such tests is not high enough to justify dependence on 
these tests for primary decision-making.
Superior empiric coverage can be obtained using local 
and unit-specific antibiograms [113, 114] or an infectious 
diseases consultation [115–117]. Where uncertainty 
regarding appropriate patient-specific antimicrobial ther-
apy exists, infectious diseases consultation is warranted. 
Early involvement of infectious diseases specialists can 
improve outcome in some circumstances (e.g., S. aureus 
bacteremia) [113–115].
Although restriction of antimicrobials is an impor-
tant strategy to reduce both the development of patho-
gen resistance and cost, it is not an appropriate strategy 
in the initial therapy for this patient population. Patients 
with sepsis or septic shock generally warrant empiric 
broad-spectrum therapy until the causative organism 
and its antimicrobial susceptibilities are defined. At that 
point, the spectrum of coverage should be narrowed 
by eliminating unneeded antimicrobials and replacing 
broad-spectrum agents with more specific agents [118]. 
However, if relevant cultures are negative, empiric nar-
rowing of coverage based on a good clinical response 
is appropriate. Collaboration with antimicrobial stew-
ardship programs is encouraged to ensure appropriate 
choices and rapid availability of effective antimicrobials 
for treating septic patients.
In situations in which a pathogen is identified, de-
escalation to the narrowest effective agent should be 
implemented for most serious infections. However, approx-
imately one-third of patients with sepsis do not have a 
causative pathogen identified [95, 119]. In some cases, this 
may be because guidelines do not recommend obtaining 
cultures (e.g., community-acquired abdominal sepsis with 
bowel perforation) [108]. In others, cultures may have fol-
lowed antimicrobial therapy. Further, almost half of patients 
with suspected sepsis in one study have been adjudicated in 
post hoc analysis to lack infection or represent only “pos-
sible” sepsis [120]. Given the adverse societal and individ-
ual risks to continued unnecessary antimicrobial therapy, 
we recommend thoughtful de-escalation of antimicrobials 
based on adequate clinical improvement even if cultures 
are negative. When infection is found not to be present, 
antimicrobial therapy should be stopped promptly to mini-
mize the likelihood that the patient will become infected 
with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen or develop a 
drug-related adverse effect. Thus, the decisions to continue, 
narrow, or stop antimicrobial therapy must be made on the 
basis of clinician judgment and clinical information.
4. We recommend against sustained systemic antimi-
crobial prophylaxis in patients with severe inflam-
matory states of noninfectious origin (e.g., severe 
pancreatitis, burn injury) (BPS).
 317
Rationale A systemic inflammatory response without 
infection does not mandate antimicrobial therapy. Exam-
ples of conditions that may exhibit acute inflammatory 
signs without infection include severe pancreatitis and 
extensive burn injury. Sustained systemic antimicrobial 
therapy in the absence of suspected infection should be 
avoided in these situations to minimize the likelihood 
that the patient will become infected with an antimicro-
bial-resistant pathogen or will develop a drug-related 
adverse effect.
Although the prophylactic use of systemic antimicro-
bials for severe necrotizing pancreatitis has been rec-
ommended in the past, recent guidelines have favored 
avoidance of this approach [121].
The current position is supported by meta-analyses that 
demonstrate no clinical advantage of prophylactic antibi-
otics that would outweigh their long-term adverse effects 
[122]. Similarly, prolonged systemic antimicrobial proph-
ylaxis has been used in the past for patients with severe 
burns. However, recent meta-analyses suggest questiona-
ble clinical benefit with this approach [123, 124]. Current 
guidelines for burn management do not support sus-
tained antimicrobial prophylaxis [101]. Summarizing the 
evidence is challenging due to the diversity of the popu-
lation. The quality of evidence was low for mortality in 
pancreatitis [122] and low for burns; therefore, we believe 
this recommendation is better addressed as a BPS, in 
which the alternative of administering antibiotics without 
indicators of infection is implausible [122–124]. Despite 
our recommendation against sustained systemic antimi-
crobial prophylaxis generally, brief antibiotic prophylaxis 
for specific invasive procedures may be appropriate. In 
addition, if there is a strong suspicion of concurrent sep-
sis or septic shock in patients with a severe inflammatory 
state of noninfectious origin (despite overlapping clinical 
presentations), antimicrobial therapy is indicated.
5. We recommend that dosing strategies of antimi-
crobials be optimized based on accepted phar-
macokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles and 
specific drug properties in patients with sepsis or 
septic shock (BPS).
Rationale Early optimization of antimicrobial phar-
macokinetics can improve the outcome of patients with 
severe infection. Several considerations should be made 
when determining optimal dosing for critically ill patients 
with sepsis and septic shock. These patients have distinct 
differences from the typical infected patient that affect 
the optimal antimicrobial management strategy. These 
differences include an increased frequency of hepatic 
and renal dysfunction, a high prevalence of unrecognized 
immune dysfunction, and a predisposition to infection 
with resistant organisms. Perhaps most importantly 
with respect to initial empiric antimicrobial dosing is an 
increased volume of distribution for most antimicrobials, 
in part due to the rapid expansion of extracellular volume 
as a consequence of aggressive fluid resuscitation. This 
results in an unexpectedly high frequency of suboptimal 
drug levels with a variety of antimicrobials in patients 
with sepsis and septic shock [125–128]. Early attention 
to appropriate antimicrobial dosing is central to improv-
ing outcome given the marked increase in mortality and 
other adverse outcomes if there is a failure of rapid initia-
tion of effective therapy. Antimicrobial therapy in these 
patients should always be initiated with a full, high end-
loading dose of each agent used.
Different antimicrobials have different required plasma 
targets for optimal outcomes. Failure to achieve peak 
plasma targets on initial dosing has been associated with 
clinical failure with aminoglycosides [129]. Similarly, 
inadequate early vancomycin trough plasma concen-
trations (in relation to pathogen minimum inhibitory 
concentration [MIC]) have been associated with clini-
cal failure for serious MRSA infections [130] (including 
nosocomial pneumonia [131] and septic shock [132].
The clinical success rate for treatment of serious infec-
tions correlates with higher peak blood levels (in rela-
tion to pathogen MIC) of fluoroquinolones (nosocomial 
pneumonia and other serious infections) [133–135] and 
aminoglycosides (gram-negative bacteremia, nosoco-
mial pneumonia, and other serious infections) [129, 136]. 
For β-lactams, superior clinical and microbiologic cures 
appear to be associated with a longer duration of plasma 
concentration above the pathogen MIC, particularly in 
critically ill patients [137–140].
The optimal dosing strategy for aminoglycosides and 
fluoroquinolones involves optimizing peak drug plasma 
concentrations. For aminoglycosides, this can most eas-
ily be attained with once daily dosing (5–7 mg/kg daily 
gentamicin equivalent). Once-daily dosing yields at least 
comparable clinical efficacy with possibly decreased renal 
toxicity compared to multiple daily dosing regimens 
[141, 142]. Once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is used 
for patients with preserved renal function. Patients with 
chronically mildly impaired renal function should still 
receive a once-daily-equivalent dose but would normally 
have an extended period (up to 3 days) before the next 
dose. This dosing regimen should not be used in patients 
with severe renal function in whom the aminoglycoside 
is not expected to clear within several days. Therapeutic 
drug monitoring of aminoglycosides in this context is 
primarily meant to ensure that trough concentrations are 
sufficiently low to minimize the potential for renal toxic-
ity. For fluoroquinolones, an approach that optimizes the 
dose within a nontoxic range (e.g., ciprofloxacin, 600 mg 
 318
every 12 h, or levofloxacin, 750 mg every 24 h, assum-
ing preserved renal function) should provide the high-
est probability of a favorable microbiologic and clinical 
response [127, 143, 144].
Vancomycin is another antibiotic whose efficacy is 
at least partially concentration-dependent. Dosing to 
a trough target of 15–20 mg/L is recommended by sev-
eral authorities to maximize the probability of achieving 
appropriate pharmacodynamic targets, improve tissue 
penetration, and optimize clinical outcomes [145–147]. 
Pre-dose monitoring of trough concentrations is recom-
mended. For sepsis and septic shock, an IV loading dose 
of 25–30 mg/kg (based on actual body weight) is sug-
gested to rapidly achieve the target trough drug concen-
tration. A loading dose of 1 g of vancomycin will fail to 
achieve early therapeutic levels for a significant subset of 
patients. In fact, loading doses of antimicrobials with low 
volumes of distribution (teicoplanin, vancomycin, colis-
tin) are warranted in critically ill patients to more rapidly 
achieve therapeutic drug levels due to their expanded 
extracellular volume related to volume expansion follow-
ing fluid resuscitation [148–152].
Loading doses are also recommended for β-lactams 
administered as continuous or extended infusions to 
accelerate accumulation of drug to therapeutic levels 
[153]. Notably, the required loading dose of any antimi-
crobial is not affected by alterations of renal function, 
although this may affect frequency of administration 
and/or total daily dose.
For β-lactams, the key pharmacodynamics correlate to 
microbiologic and clinical response is the time that the 
plasma concentration of the drug is above the pathogen 
MIC relative to the dosing interval (T > MIC). A mini-
mum T > MIC of 60% is generally sufficient to allow a 
good clinical response in mild to moderate illness. How-
ever, optimal response in severe infections, including 
sepsis, may be achieved with a T > MIC of 100% [139]. 
The simplest way to increase T > MIC is to use increased 
frequency of dosing (given an identical total daily dose). 
For example, piperacillin/tazobactam can be dosed at 
either 4.5 g every 8 h or 3.375 g every 6 h for serious 
infections; all things being equal, the latter would achieve 
a higher T > MIC. We suggested earlier that initial doses 
of β-lactams can be given as a bolus or rapid infusion to 
rapidly achieve therapeutic blood levels. However, fol-
lowing the initial dose, an extended infusion of drug over 
several hours (which increases T > MIC) rather than the 
standard 30 min has been recommended by some author-
ities [154, 155]. In addition, some meta-analyses suggest 
that extended/continuous infusion of β-lactams may be 
more effective than intermittent rapid infusion, particu-
larly for relatively resistant organisms and in critically ill 
patients with sepsis [140, 156–158]. A recent individual 
patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled tri-
als comparing continuous versus intermittent infusion of 
β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with severe 
sepsis demonstrated an independent protective effect of 
continuous therapy after adjustment for other correlates 
of outcome [140].
While the weight of evidence supports pharmacoki-
netically optimized antimicrobial dosing strategies in 
critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, this 
is difficult to achieve on an individual level without a 
broader range of rapid therapeutic drug monitoring 
options than currently available (i.e., vancomycin, teico-
planin and aminoglycosides). The target group of criti-
cally ill, septic patients exhibit a variety of physiologic 
perturbations that dramatically alter antimicrobial phar-
macokinetics. These include unstable hemodynamics, 
increased cardiac output, increased extracellular volume 
(markedly increasing volume of distribution), variable 
kidney and hepatic perfusion (affecting drug clearance) 
and altered drug binding due to reduced serum albumin 
[159]. In addition, augmented renal clearance is a recently 
described phenomenon that may lead to decreased serum 
antimicrobial levels in the early phase of sepsis [160–
162]. These factors make individual assessment of opti-
mal drug dosing difficult in critically ill patients. Based 
on studies with therapeutic drug monitoring, under-dos-
ing (particularly in the early phase of treatment) is com-
mon in critically ill, septic patients, but drug toxicity such 
as central nervous system irritation with β-lactams and 
renal injury with colistin is also seen [163–166]. These 
problems mandate efforts to expand access to therapeutic 
drug monitoring for multiple antimicrobials for critically 
ill patients with sepsis.
6. We suggest empiric combination therapy (using 
at least two antibiotics of different antimicro-
bial classes) aimed at the most likely bacterial 
pathogen(s) for the initial management of septic 
shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evi-
dence).
Remarks Readers should review Table 6 for defini-
tions of empiric, targeted/definitive, broad-spectrum, 
combination, and multidrug therapy before reading 
this section.
7. We suggest that combination therapy not be rou-
tinely used for ongoing treatment of most other 
serious infections, including bacteremia and sep-
sis without shock (weak recommendation, low 
quality of evidence).

Remarks This does not preclude the use of multidrug 
therapy to broaden antimicrobial activity.

the routine treatment of neutropenic sepsis/bac-
teremia (strong recommendation, moderate qual-
ity of evidence).
Remarks This does not preclude the use of multidrug 
therapy to broaden antimicrobial activity.

shock, we recommend de-escalation with discon-
tinuation of combination therapy within the first 
few days in response to clinical improvement and/
Table 6 Important terminology for antimicrobial recommendations
Empiric therapy
Ini�al therapy started in the absence of defini�ve 
microbiologic pathogen iden�fica�on. Empiric therapy may 
be mono-, combina�on, or broad-spectrum, and/or 
mul�drug in nature.
Targeted/defini�ve therapy
Therapy targeted to a specific pathogen (usually a�er 
microbiologic iden�fica�on). Targeted/defini�ve therapy 
may be mono- or combina�on, but is not intended to be 
broad-spectrum. 
Broad-spectrum therapy
The use of one or more an�microbial agents with the 
specific intent of broadening the range of poten�al 
pathogens covered, usually during empiric therapy (e.g., 
piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and anidulafungin; 
each is used to cover a different group of pathogens). 
Broad-spectrum therapy is typically empiric since the usual 
purpose is to ensure an�microbial coverage with at least 
one drug when there is uncertainty about the possible 
pathogen. On occasion, broad-spectrum therapy may be 
con�nued into the targeted/defini�ve therapy phase if 
mul�ple pathogens are isolated.
Mul�drug therapy
Therapy with mul�ple an�microbials to deliver broad-
spectrum therapy (i.e., to broaden coverage) for empiric 
therapy (i.e., where pathogen is unknown) or to poten�ally 
accelerate pathogen clearance (combina�on therapy) with 
respect to a specific pathogen(s) where the pathogen(s) is 
known or suspected (i.e., for both targeted or empiric 
therapy). This term therefore includes combina�on therapy.
Combina�on therapy
The use of mul�ple an�bio�cs (usually of different 
mechanis�c classes) with the specific intent of covering the 
known or suspected pathogen(s) with more than one 
an�bio�c (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam and an 
aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone for gram-nega�ve
pathogens) to accelerate pathogen clearance rather than to 
broaden an�microbial coverage. Other proposed 
applica�ons of combina�on therapy include inhibi�on of 
bacterial toxin produc�on (e.g., clindamycin with β-lactams 
for streptococcal toxic shock) or poten�al immune 
modulatory effects (macrolides with a β-lactam for 
pneumococcal pneumonia).
 320
or evidence of infection resolution. This applies to 
both targeted (for culture-positive infections) and 
empiric (for culture-negative infections) combina-
tion therapy (BPS).
Rationale In light of the increasing frequency of path-
ogen resistance to antimicrobial agents in many parts of 
the world, the initial use of multidrug therapy is often 
required to ensure an appropriately broad-spectrum 
range of coverage for initial empiric treatment. The use of 
multidrug therapy for this purpose in severe infections is 
well understood.
The phrase “combination therapy” in the context of this 
guideline connotes the use of two different classes of anti-
biotics (usually a β-lactam with a fluoroquinolone, ami-
noglycoside, or macrolide) for a single putative pathogen 
expected to be sensitive to both, particularly for purposes 
of accelerating pathogen clearance. The term is not used 
where the purpose of a multidrug strategy is to strictly 
broaden the range of antimicrobial activity (e.g., vanco-
mycin added to ceftazidime, metronidazole added to an 
aminoglycoside or an echinocandin added to a β-lactam).
A propensity-matched analysis and a meta-analysis/
meta-regression analysis have demonstrated that com-
bination therapy produces higher survival in severely ill 
septic patients with a high risk of death, particularly in 
those with septic shock [167, 168]. A meta-regression 
study [167] suggested benefit with combination therapy 
in patients with a mortality risk greater than 25%. Sev-
eral observational studies have similarly shown a survival 
benefit in very ill patients [169–172]. However, the afore-
mentioned meta-regression analysis also suggested the 
possibility of increased mortality risk with combination 
therapy in low-risk (<15% mortality risk) patients with-
out septic shock [167]. One controlled trial suggested 
that, when using a carbapenem as empiric therapy in a 
population at low risk for infection with resistant micro-
organisms, the addition of a fluoroquinolone does not 
improve patients’ outcomes [173]. A close examination 
of the results, however, demonstrates findings consistent 
with the previously mentioned meta-regression (trend 
to benefit in septic shock with an absence of benefit in 
sepsis without shock). Despite the overall favorable evi-
dence for combination therapy in septic shock, direct 
evidence from adequately powered RCTs is not avail-
able to validate this approach definitively. Nonetheless, 
in clinical scenarios of severe clinical illness (particularly 
septic shock), several days of combination therapy is 
biologically plausible and is likely to be clinically useful 
[152, 167, 168] even if evidence has not definitively dem-
onstrated improved clinical outcome in bacteremia and 
sepsis without shock [174, 175]. Thus, we issue a weak 
recommendation based on low quality of evidence.
A number of other recent observational studies and 
some small, prospective trials also support initial com-
bination therapy for selected patients with specific 
pathogens (e.g., severe pneumococcal infection, multid-
rug-resistant gram-negative pathogens) [172, 176–182]. 
Unfortunately, in most cases and pending the develop-
ment of rapid bedside pathogen detection techniques, 
the offending pathogen is not known at the time of pres-
entation. Therefore, specifying combination therapy to 
specific identified pathogens is useful only if more pro-
longed targeted combination therapy is contemplated. In 
addition, with respect to multidrug-resistant pathogens, 
both individual studies and meta-analyses yield variable 
results depending on the pathogen and the clinical sce-
nario [179–184]. Infectious diseases consultation may be 
advisable if multidrug-resistant pathogens are suspected. 
One area of broad consensus on the use of a specific form 
of combination therapy is for streptococcal toxic shock 
syndrome, for which animal models and uncontrolled, 
clinical experience demonstrate a survival advantage with 
penicillin and clindamycin, the latter as a transcriptional 
inhibitor to pyrogenic exotoxin superantigens [109, 185, 
186].
Despite evidence suggesting benefit of combination 
therapy in septic shock, this approach has not been 
shown to be effective for ongoing treatment of most 
other serious infections, including bacteremia and sepsis 
without shock [168, 174, 175]. The term “ongoing treat-
ment” includes extended empiric therapy for culture-
negative infections and extended definitive/targeted 
therapy where a pathogen is identified. In the case of 
neutropenia in the absence of septic shock, studies using 
modern broad-spectrum antibiotics consistently suggest 
that, while multidrug therapy to broaden pathogen cov-
erage (e.g., to include Candida species) may be useful, 
combination therapy using a β-lactam and an aminogly-
coside for purposes of accelerating pathogen clearance is 
not beneficial for less severely ill “low-risk” patients [187]. 
Combination therapy of this sort for even “high-risk” 
neutropenic patients (inclusive of hemodynamic insta-
bility and organ failure) with sepsis is inconsistently sup-
ported by several international expert groups [106, 188]. 
This position against combination therapy for a single 
pathogen in any form of neutropenic infection emphati-
cally does not preclude the use of multidrug therapy for 
the purpose of broadening the spectrum of antimicrobial 
treatment.
High-quality data on clinically driven de-escalation of 
antimicrobial therapy for severe infections are limited 
[189]. Early de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy in the 
context of combination therapy as described here has 
not been studied. However, observational studies have 
shown that early de-escalation of multidrug therapy is 
 321
associated with equivalent or superior clinical outcomes 
in sepsis and septic shock [54, 190–192]; despite this, at 
least one study has indicated an increased frequency of 
superinfection and longer ICU stay [192].
In addition to institutional benefit with respect to lim-
iting a driver of antimicrobial resistance, early de-esca-
lation can also benefit the individual patient [193–195]. 
Although the data are not entirely consistent, on bal-
ance, an approach that emphasizes early de-escalation is 
favored when using combination therapy.
While substantial consensus on the need for early de-
escalation of combination therapy exists, agreement is 
lacking on precise criteria for triggering de-escalation. 
Among approaches used by panel members are de-esca-
lation based on: (a) clinical progress (shock resolution, 
decrease in vasopressor requirement, etc.), (b) infection 
resolution as indicated by biomarkers (especially pro-
calcitonin), and (c) a relatively fixed duration of combi-
nation therapy. This lack of consensus on de-escalation 
criteria for combination therapy reflects the lack of solid 
data addressing this issue (notwithstanding procalcitonin 
data relating to general de-escalation).
10. We suggest that an antimicrobial treatment dura-
tion of 7–10 days is adequate for most serious 
infections associated with sepsis and septic shock 
(weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
11. We suggest that longer courses are appropri-
ate in patients who have a slow clinical response, 
undrainable foci of infection, bacteremia with 
S. aureus, some fungal and viral infections, or 
immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia 
(weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
12. We suggest that shorter courses are appropriate in 
some patients, particularly those with rapid clini-
cal resolution following effective source control of 
intra-abdominal or urinary sepsis and those with 
anatomically uncomplicated pyelonephritis (weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
13. We recommend daily assessment for de-escala-
tion of antimicrobial therapy in patients with sep-
sis and septic shock (BPS).
Rationale Unnecessarily prolonged administration of 
antimicrobials is detrimental to society and to the indi-
vidual patient. For society, excessive antimicrobial use 
drives antimicrobial resistance development and dis-
semination [196]. For individual patients, prolonged 
antibiotic therapy is associated with specific illnesses 
such as Clostridium difficile colitis [195] and, more 
broadly, an increased mortality risk [54]. The basis of the 
increased mortality with unnecessarily prolonged and 
broad antimicrobial therapy has not been convincingly 
demonstrated, although cumulative antimicrobial toxic-
ity; the occurrence of antimicrobial-associated secondary 
infections (e.g., C. difficile colitis); and selection of, and 
superinfection with, multidrug-resistant pathogens are 
all potential contributors.
Although patient factors will influence the length of 
antibiotic therapy, a treatment duration of 7–10 days (in 
the absence of source control issues) is generally ade-
quate for most serious infections [103, 197–199]. Cur-
rent guidelines recommend a 7-day course of therapy for 
nosocomial pneumonia [both hospital-acquired and ven-
tilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)] [103]. Recent data 
suggest that some serious infections may be treated with 
shorter courses especially if there is a need for and suc-
cessful provision of source control [200, 201].
Subgroup analysis of the most critically ill subjects 
[Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) II score greater than either 15 or 20] in the 
short course of antimicrobials in the intra-abdominal 
sepsis study of Sawyer et al. demonstrated no difference 
in outcome based on the duration of therapy (as with 
the overall group) [200, 202]. A treatment duration of 
3–5 days or fewer was as effective as a duration of up to 
10 days. Similarly, studies have shown that a treatment 
duration of <7 days is as effective as longer durations in 
the management of acute pyelonephritis with or with-
out bacteremia [201], uncomplicated cellulitis [203], and 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [204]. Some conditions 
are generally thought to require more prolonged antimi-
crobial therapy. These include situations in which there 
is a slow clinical response, undrainable foci of infection, 
bacteremia with S. aureus (particularly MRSA) [67, 104], 
candidemia/invasive candidiasis [105] and other fungal 
infections, some viral infections (e.g., herpes, cytomeg-
alovirus), and immunologic deficiencies, including neu-
tropenia [188].
Assessment of the required duration of therapy in criti-
cally ill patients should include host factors, particularly 
immune status. For example, patients with neutropenic 
infection and sepsis usually require therapy for at least 
the duration of their neutropenia. The nature of the 
infecting pathogen also plays a role. In particular, uncom-
plicated S. aureus bacteremia requires at least 14 days 
of therapy, while complicated bacteremia requires treat-
ment as an endovascular infection with 6 weeks of ther-
apy. Uncomplicated bacteremia has been defined as: (1) 
exclusion of endocarditis, (2) no implanted prostheses, 
3) negative results of follow-up blood cultures drawn 
2–4 days after the initial set, (4) defervescence within 
72 h after the initiation of effective antibiotic therapy, and 
(5) no evidence of metastatic infection [104].
Patients with candidemia (whether or not catheter-
associated) and deep Candida infections, whether or not 
 322
associated with sepsis, require more prolonged therapy 
[105, 205]. Highly resistant gram-negative pathogens 
with marginal sensitivity to utilized antimicrobials may 
be slow to clear and represent another example. The 
nature and site of infection may also affect duration of 
therapy. Larger abscesses and osteomyelitis have limited 
drug penetration and require longer therapy. Although it 
is well known that endocarditis requires prolonged anti-
microbial therapy, severe disease more typically presents 
as cardiac failure/cardiogenic shock and emboli rather 
than as sepsis or septic shock [206, 207]. A variety of 
other factors may play a role in determining the optimal 
duration of therapy, particularly in critically ill infected 
patients. If the clinician is uncertain, infectious diseases 
consultation should be sought.
Few of the studies noted focused on patients with sep-
tic shock, sepsis with organ failure, or even critical illness. 
To an extent, standard recommendations on duration of 
therapy in this document depend on inferences from less 
ill cohorts. Therefore, decisions to narrow or stop antimi-
crobial therapy must ultimately be made on the basis of 
sound clinical judgment.
There are many reasons for unnecessarily prolonged 
antimicrobial therapy. For complicated, critically ill 
patients admitted with serious infections, noninfectious 
concurrent illness and medical interventions may pro-
duce signs and symptoms consistent with active infec-
tion (even following control of infection). For example, 
pulmonary infiltrates and shortness of breath may be 
caused by pulmonary edema in addition to pneumonia; 
an elevated white cell count may occur as a consequence 
of corticosteroid administration or physiologic stress; 
fever may be associated with certain drugs, including 
β-lactams and phenytoin. In addition, there is a natural 
tendency to want to continue a therapy that is often seen 
as benign long enough to be confident of cure. However, 
as discussed, antimicrobials are not an entirely benign 
therapy. In low-risk patients, the adverse effects can out-
weigh any benefit.
Given the potential harm associated with unnecessar-
ily prolonged antimicrobial therapy, daily assessment for 
de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is recommended 
in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Studies have 
shown that daily prompting on the question of antimi-
crobial de-escalation is effective and may be associated 
with improved mortality rates [55, 208].
14. We suggest that measurement of procalcitonin 
levels can be used to support shortening the dura-
tion of antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients 
(weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
15. We suggest that procalcitonin levels can be used 
to support the discontinuation of empiric anti-
biotics in patients who initially appeared to have 
sepsis, but subsequently have limited clinical evi-
dence of infection (weak recommendation, low 
quality of evidence).
Rationale During the past decade, the role of bio-
markers to assist in the diagnosis and management of 
infections has been extensively explored. The use of 
galactomannan and β-d-glucan to assist in the assess-
ment of invasive aspergillus (and a broad range of fungal 
pathogens) has become well accepted [209, 210].
Similarly, measurement of serum procalcitonin is com-
monly used in many parts of the world to assist in the 
diagnosis of acute infection and to help define the dura-
tion of antimicrobial therapy. Various procalcitonin-based 
algorithms have been used to direct de-escalation of anti-
microbial therapy in severe infections and sepsis [211–
216]. However, it is not clear that any particular algorithm 
provides a clinical advantage over another. A large body of 
literature suggests that use of such algorithms can speed 
safe antimicrobial de-escalation compared to standard 
clinical approaches with reduced antimicrobial consump-
tion without an adverse effect on mortality. Recently, a 
large randomized trial on procalcitonin use in critically ill 
patients with presumed bacterial infection demonstrated 
evidence of a reduction in duration of treatment and daily 
defined doses of antimicrobials [217]. However, given 
the design of the study, the reduction could have been 
related to a prompting effect as seen in other studies [55, 
218]. In addition, the procalcitonin group showed a sig-
nificant reduction in mortality. This finding is congruent 
with studies demonstrating an association between early 
antimicrobial de-escalation and survival in observational 
studies of sepsis and septic shock [54, 55].
This benefit is uncertain, though, because another 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies of de-
escalation failed to demonstrate a similar survival advan-
tage [219]. Meta-analyses also suggest that procalcitonin 
can also be used to assist in differentiating infectious 
and noninfectious conditions at presentation [211, 214, 
216]. The strongest evidence appears to relate to bacterial 
pneumonia versus noninfectious pulmonary pathology 
[216, 220], where meta-analysis suggests that procalci-
tonin may assist in predicting the presence of bacteremia, 
particularly in ICU patients [221].
No evidence to date demonstrates that the use of pro-
calcitonin reduces the risk of antibiotic-related diarrhea 
from C. difficile. However, the occurrence of C. diffi-
cile colitis is known to be associated with cumulative 
 323
antibiotic exposure in individual patients [195], so such a 
benefit is likely. In addition, although prevalence of anti-
microbial resistance has not been shown to be reduced 
by the use of procalcitonin, the emergence of antimicro-
bial resistance is known to be associated with total anti-
microbial consumption in large regions [196].
It is important to note that procalcitonin and all other 
biomarkers can provide only supportive and supplemen-
tal data to clinical assessment. Decisions on initiating, 
altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should 
never be made solely on the basis of changes in any bio-
marker, including procalcitonin.
E. SOURCE CONTROL
1. We recommend that a specific anatomic diagno-
sis of infection requiring emergent source con-
trol be identified or excluded as rapidly as pos-
sible in patients with sepsis or septic shock, and 
that any required source control intervention be 
implemented as soon as medically and logisti-
cally practical after the diagnosis is made (BPS).
2. We recommend prompt removal of intravascular 
access devices that are a possible source of sep-
sis or septic shock after other vascular access has 
been established (BPS).
Rationale The principles of source control in the man-
agement of sepsis and septic shock include rapid diagno-
sis of the specific site of infection and determination of 
whether that infection site is amenable to source control 
measures (specifically the drainage of an abscess, debride-
ment of infected necrotic tissue, removal of a potentially 
infected device, and definitive control of a source of ongo-
ing microbial contamination) [222]. Foci of infection 
readily amenable to source control include intra-abdomi-
nal abscesses, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic bowel 
or volvulus, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis asso-
ciated with obstruction or abscess, necrotizing soft tissue 
infection, other deep space infection (e.g., empyema or 
septic arthritis), and implanted device infections.
Infectious foci suspected to cause septic shock should 
be controlled as soon as possible following successful 
initial resuscitation [223, 224]. A target of no more than 
6–12 h after diagnosis appears to be sufficient for most 
cases [223–229]. Observational studies generally show 
reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to show 
benefit with even earlier source control implementation 
may be a consequence of the limited number of patients 
in these studies. Therefore, any required source control 
intervention in sepsis and septic shock should ideally be 
implemented as soon as medically and logistically practi-
cal after the diagnosis is made.
Clinical experience suggests that, without adequate 
source control, some more severe presentations will not 
stabilize or improve despite rapid resuscitation and pro-
vision of appropriate antimicrobials. In view of this fact, 
prolonged efforts at medical stabilization prior to source 
control for severely ill patients, particularly those with 
septic shock, are generally not warranted [108].
The selection of optimal source control methods must 
weigh the benefits and risks of the specific intervention, 
risks of transfer for the procedure, potential delays associ-
ated with a specific procedure, and the probability of the 
procedure’s success. Source control interventions may 
cause further complications, such as bleeding, fistulas, 
or inadvertent organ injury. In general, the least invasive 
effective option for source control should be pursued. 
Open surgical intervention should be considered when 
other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot 
be provided in a timely fashion. Surgical exploration may 
also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists 
despite radiologic evaluation or when the probability of 
success with a percutaneous procedure is uncertain and 
the mortality risk as a consequence of a failed procedure 
causing delays is high. Specific clinical situations require 
consideration of available choices, the patient’s prefer-
ences, and the clinician’s expertise. Logistic factors unique 
to each institution, such as surgical or interventional staff 
availability, may also play a role in the decision.
Intravascular devices such as central venous catheters 
can be the source of sepsis or septic shock. An intravas-
cular device suspected to be a source of sepsis should gen-
erally be removed promptly after establishing another site 
for vascular access. In the absence of both septic shock and 
fungemia, some implanted, tunneled catheter infections 
may be able to be treated effectively with prolonged anti-
microbial therapy if removal of the catheter is not practical 
[67]. However, catheter removal (with antimicrobial ther-
apy) is definitive and is preferred where possible.
F. FLUID THERAPY
1. We recommend that a fluid challenge technique 
be applied where fluid administration is contin-
ued as long as hemodynamic factors continue to 
improve (BPS).
2. We recommend crystalloids as the fluid of choice 
for initial resuscitation and subsequent intravas-
cular volume replacement in patients with sepsis 
and septic shock (strong recommendation, mod-
erate quality of evidence).
3. We suggest using either balanced crystalloids or 
saline for fluid resuscitation of patients with sep-
sis or septic shock (weak recommendation, low 
quality of evidence).
 324
4. We suggest using albumin in addition to crys-
talloids for initial resuscitation and subsequent 
intravascular volume replacement in patients 
with sepsis and septic shock when patients 
require substantial amounts of crystalloids (weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
5. We recommend against using hydroxyethyl 
starches (HESs) for intravascular volume replace-
ment in patients with sepsis or septic shock 
(strong recommendation, high quality of evi-
dence).
6. We suggest using crystalloids over gelatins when 
resuscitating patients with sepsis or septic shock 
(weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale The use of IV fluids in the resuscitation of 
patients is a cornerstone of modern therapy. Despite this, 
there is little available evidence from RCTs to support 
its practice; this is an area in which research is urgently 
needed. One trial of children (mostly with malaria) in 
Africa, in a setting where escalation to mechanical ven-
tilation and other organ support was limited, questioned 
this practice [230]. We believe that the extrapolation of 
these data to patients in better-resourced settings is not 
valid and thus recommend that clinicians restore euv-
olemia with IV fluids, more urgently initially, and then 
more cautiously as the patient stabilizes. There is some 
evidence that a sustained positive fluid balance during 
ICU stay is harmful [231–235]. We do not recommend, 
therefore, that fluid be given beyond initial resuscitation 
without some estimate of the likelihood that the patient 
will respond positively.
The absence of any clear benefit following the adminis-
tration of colloid compared to crystalloid solutions in the 
combined subgroups of sepsis, in conjunction with the 
expense of albumin, supports a strong recommendation 
for the use of crystalloid solutions in the initial resuscita-
tion of patients with sepsis and septic shock.
We were unable to recommend one crystalloid solution 
over another because no direct comparisons have been 
made between isotonic saline and balanced salt solu-
tions in patients with sepsis. One before-after study in all 
ICU patients suggested increased rates of acute kidney 
injury and RRT in patients managed with a chloride-lib-
eral strategy compared to a chloride-restrictive strategy 
[236]. There is indirect low-quality evidence from a net-
work meta-analysis suggesting improved outcome with 
balanced salt solutions as compared to saline in patients 
with sepsis [237] (ESM 6). In addition, the neutral result 
of the SPLIT cluster RCT in ICU patients (mainly surgi-
cal patients) in four New Zealand ICUs lowered our con-
fidence in recommending one solution over the other 
[238].
No cost-effectiveness studies compare balanced and 
unbalanced crystalloid solutions. Therefore, we consid-
ered the desirable and undesirable consequences to be 
comparable for both solutions, and issued a weak recom-
mendation to use either solution. Hyperchloremia should 
be avoided, however, and thus close scrutiny of serum 
chloride levels is advised, whichever fluid solutions are 
used.
The SAFE study indicated that albumin administra-
tion was safe and equally effective as 0.9% saline in 
ICU patients requiring fluid administration [239]. A 
meta-analysis aggregated data from 17 randomized tri-
als (n = 1977) of albumin versus other fluid solutions 
in patients with sepsis or septic shock [240]; 279 deaths 
occurred among 961 albumin-treated patients (29%) ver-
sus 343 deaths among 1016 patients (34%) treated with 
other fluids, favoring albumin (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67–
1.00). When albumin-treated patients were compared 
with those receiving crystalloids (seven trials, n = 144), 
the odds ratio of dying was significantly reduced for albu-
min-treated patients (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.62–0.99).
Since the 2012 SSC guideline publication, six system-
atic reviews/meta-analyses [237, 241–245] were pub-
lished assessing the use of albumin solutions in the 
management of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Each 
meta-analysis included different populations (adult/child, 
septic/nonseptic, and acute resuscitation/maintenance), 
different comparators and different duration of exposure 
to the intervention (hours, days), which made combining 
data challenging (ESM 7).
Xu et al. [242] evaluated albumin compared to crys-
talloid as a resuscitation fluid. Five studies, encompass-
ing 3658 sepsis and 2180 septic shock patients, were 
included. Albumin use resulted in reduced septic shock 
90-day mortality (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67–0.97) and 
trended toward reduced 90-day mortality in sepsis (OR 
0.88; 95% CI 0.76–1.01; p = 0.08). Jiang et al. [245] evalu-
ated albumin in a mixed population of sepsis severity 
including adults and children. Three septic shock stud-
ies, encompassing 1931 patients, were included. Albu-
min use resulted in decreased mortality (OR 0.89; 95% CI 
0.80–0.99) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). A mortality 
reduction trend was reported for albumin administration 
compared to crystalloids when given less than 6 h from 
identification (11 studies; n = 5515; OR 0.94; 95% CI 
0.86–1.03).
Patel et al. [244] evaluated mixed populations, includ-
ing resuscitation and maintenance. Additionally, a series 
of studies excluded from other meta-analyses due to 
accuracy concerns was included in this evaluation [246–
248]. When comparing crystalloid and albumin, the 
authors report a combined mortality benefit of albumin 
as compared to crystalloid (seven studies, n = 3878; OR 
 325
0.93; 95% CI 0.86–1.00), but it was not consistent across 
individual severity subgroups. Use of albumin in septic 
shock trended toward mortality benefit (four studies; 
n = 1949; OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.82–1.01; p = 0.06), and 
the use of albumin in sepsis was not significant (four 
studies; n = 1929; OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83–1.10). Evalua-
tion of treatment within 24 h also trended toward mor-
tality benefit (four studies; n = 3832; RR 0.93; 95% CI 
0.86–1.01). Rochwerg 2014 et al. [237] evaluated resus-
citative fluid use in a network meta-analysis of 14 trials, 
encompassing 18,916 patients. When comparing albu-
min to crystalloid, there was no significant reduction 
in mortality with moderate quality of evidence in both 
the four- and six-node analyses (four-node: OR 0.83; 
credible interval [CrI] 0.65–1.04; six-node OR 0.82; CrI 
0.65–1.04).
The ALBIOS trial [249] showed no mortality benefit of 
albumin in combination with crystalloids compared to 
crystalloids alone in patients with sepsis or septic shock 
(RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85–1.05); a subgroup analysis sug-
gested that the albumin group was associated with lower 
90-day mortality in patients with septic shock (RR 0.87; 
95% CI 0.77–0.99). Fluid administration continued for 
28 days or until discharge and was not targeted for acute 
resuscitation. In addition, the amount of 20% albumin was 
guided by serum albumin level with the ultimate goal of 
achieving levels >30 g/L. These results are limited by sig-
nificant indirectness and imprecision, resulting in low 
quality of evidence.
HESs are colloids for which there are safety concerns 
in patients with sepsis. A meta-analysis of nine trials 
(3456 patients) comparing 6% HES 130/0.38–0.45 solu-
tions to crystalloids or albumin in patients with sepsis 
showed no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.04; 
95% CI 0.89–1.22) [250]. However, when low risk of 
bias trials were analyzed separately, HES use resulted in 
higher risk of death compared to other fluids (RR 1.11; 
95% CI 1.01–1.22; high-quality evidence), which trans-
lates to 34 more deaths per 1000 patients. Furthermore, 
HES use led to a higher risk of RRT (RR 1.36; 95% CI 
1.08–1.72; high-quality evidence) [250]. A subsequent 
network meta-analysis focused on acute resuscitation of 
patients with sepsis or septic shock and found that HES 
resulted in higher risk of death (10 RCTs; OR 1.13; CrI, 
0.99–1.30; high-quality evidence) and need for RRT (7 
RCTs; OR 1.39; CrI, 1.17–1.66; high-quality evidence) 
compared to crystalloids. When comparing albumin to 
HES, albumin resulted in lower risk of death (OR 0.73; 
CrI, 0.56–0.93; moderate-quality evidence) and a trend 
toward less need for RRT (OR 0.74; CrI, 0.53–1.04; low-
quality evidence) [237]. Overall, the undesirable con-
sequences of using HES (increased risk of death and 
need for RRT) along with moderate to high quality of 
available evidence resulted in a strong recommendation 
against the use of HES in resuscitation of patients with 
sepsis or septic shock.
Gelatin is another synthetic colloid that can be used for 
fluid resuscitation; however, high-quality studies compar-
ing gelatins to other fluids in patients with sepsis or septic 
shock are lacking. Trials conducted in critically ill patients 
were summarized in a recent meta-analysis [251]. Gelatin 
use in critically ill adult patients did not increase mor-
tality (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.85–1.43; low-quality evidence) 
or acute kidney injury (RR 1.35; 95% CI 0.58–3.14; very 
low-quality evidence) compared to albumin or crystalloid. 
These results are limited by indirectness, since the studies 
did not focus on critically ill patients. The aforementioned 
network meta-analysis by Rochwerg et al. did not identify 
any RCTs comparing gelatins to crystalloids or albumin; 
therefore, the generated estimates were imprecise and 
were based on indirect comparisons [237]. Given the low 
quality of the available data and the cost associated with 
gelatin use, we issued a weak recommendation favoring 
the use of crystalloids over gelatins.
G. VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS
1. We recommend norepinephrine as the first-
choice vasopressor (strong recommendation, 
moderate quality of evidence).
2. We suggest adding either vasopressin (up to 
0.03 U/min) (weak recommendation, moderate 
quality of evidence) or epinephrine (weak rec-
ommendation, low quality of evidence) to nor-
epinephrine with the intent of raising MAP to 
target, or adding vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) 
(weak recommendation, moderate quality of evi-
dence) to decrease norepinephrine dosage.
3. We suggest using dopamine as an alternative 
vasopressor agent to norepinephrine only in 
highly selected patients (e.g., patients with low 
risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative 
bradycardia) (weak recommendation, low quality 
of evidence).
4. We recommend against using low-dose dopa-
mine for renal protection (strong recommenda-
tion, high quality of evidence).
5. We suggest using dobutamine in patients who 
show evidence of persistent hypoperfusion 
despite adequate fluid loading and the use of 
vasopressor agents (weak recommendation, low 
quality of evidence).
Remarks If initiated, vasopressor dosing should be 
titrated to an end point reflecting perfusion, and the 
agent reduced or discontinued in the face of worsen-
ing hypotension or arrhythmias.
 326
Rationale The physiologic effects of vasopressors and 
combined inotrope/vasopressor selection in septic shock 
are outlined in an extensive number of literature reviews 
[252–261]. Norepinephrine increases MAP due to its 
vasoconstrictive effects, with little change in heart rate 
and less increase in stroke volume compared with dopa-
mine. Dopamine increases MAP and cardiac output, pri-
marily due to an increase in stroke volume and heart rate. 
Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine and may 
be more effective at reversing hypotension in patients 
with septic shock. Dopamine may be particularly useful 
in patients with compromised systolic function but causes 
more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than 
norepinephrine [262]. It may also influence the endocrine 
response via the hypothalamic pituitary axis and may 
have immunosuppressive effects [263]. However, a recent 
systematic review and meta-analysis that included 11 
randomized trials (n = 1710) comparing norepinephrine 
to dopamine does not support the routine use of dopa-
mine in the management of septic shock [264]. Indeed, 
norepinephrine use resulted in lower mortality (RR 0.89; 
95% CI 0.81–0.98, high-quality evidence) and lower risk 
of arrhythmias (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.40–0.58; high-quality 
evidence) compared with dopamine (ESM 8).
Human and animal studies suggest that the infusion of 
epinephrine may have deleterious effects on the splanch-
nic circulation and produces hyperlactatemia. However, 
clinical trials do not demonstrate worsening of clinical 
outcomes. One RCT comparing norepinephrine to epi-
nephrine demonstrated no difference in mortality but an 
increase in adverse drug-related events with epinephrine 
[265]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of four randomized tri-
als (n = 540) comparing norepinephrine to epinephrine 
found no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.96; CI 
0.77–1.21; low-quality evidence) (ESM 9) [264]. Epineph-
rine may increase aerobic lactate production via stimu-
lation of skeletal muscle β2-adrenergic receptors and 
thus may preclude the use of lactate clearance to guide 
resuscitation.
Vasopressin levels in septic shock have been reported 
to be lower than anticipated for a shock state [266]. Low 
doses of vasopressin may be effective in raising blood 
pressure in patients refractory to other vasopressors and 
may have other potential physiologic benefits [266–271]. 
Terlipressin has similar effects, but is long-acting [272]. 
Studies show that vasopressin concentrations are elevated 
in early septic shock, but decrease to normal range in the 
majority of patients between 24 and 48 h as shock contin-
ues [273]. This finding has been called relative vasopres-
sin deficiency because, in the presence of hypotension, 
vasopressin would be expected to be elevated. The sig-
nificance of this finding is unknown. The VASST trial, an 
RCT comparing norepinephrine alone to norepinephrine 
plus vasopressin at 0.03 U/min, showed no difference in 
outcome in the intent-to-treat population [274]. An a 
priori defined subgroup analysis demonstrated improved 
survival among patients receiving <15 μg/min norepi-
nephrine at randomization with the addition of vasopres-
sin; however, the pretrial rationale for this stratification 
was based on exploring potential benefit in the popula-
tion requiring ≥15 μg/min norepinephrine. Higher doses 
of vasopressin have been associated with cardiac, digi-
tal, and splanchnic ischemia and should be reserved for 
situations in which alternative vasopressors have failed 
[275]. In the VANISH trial, 409 patients with septic shock 
were randomized in a factorial (2 × 2) design to receive 
vasopressin with placebo or hydrocortisone, or norepi-
nephrine with placebo or hydrocortisone. There was no 
significant difference in kidney failure-free days or death; 
however, the vasopressin group had less use of RRT 
[276]. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to include 
the results of the VANISH trial. Data from nine trials 
(n = 1324 patients with septic shock), comparing norepi-
nephrine with vasopressin (or terlipressin) demonstrated 
no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.89; 95% CI 
0.79–1.00; moderate-quality evidence) (ESM 10) [268, 
271, 272, 277–279]. Results were similar after exclud-
ing trials that used a combination of norepinephrine and 
vasopressin in the intervention arm (RR 0.89; 95% CI 
0.77–1.02). Large studies comparing vasopressin to other 
vasopressors in septic shock are lacking; most of the data 
regarding vasopressin support a sparing effect on norepi-
nephrine dose, and there is uncertainty about the effect 
of vasopressin on mortality. Norepinephrine, therefore, 
remains the first-choice vasopressor to treat patients with 
septic shock. We do not recommend the use of vasopres-
sin as a first-line vasopressor for the support of MAP and 
would advocate caution when using it in patients who are 
not euvolemic or at doses higher than 0.03 U/min.
Phenylephrine is a pure α-adrenergic agonist. Clini-
cal trial data in sepsis are limited. Phenylephrine has the 
potential to produce splanchnic vasoconstriction [280]. 
A network meta-analysis resulted in imprecise esti-
mates (wide confidence intervals) when phenylephrine 
was compared to other vasopressors [281]. Therefore, 
the impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain, and phe-
nylephrine use should be limited until more research is 
available.
A large randomized trial and meta-analysis compar-
ing low-dose dopamine to placebo found no difference in 
need for RRT, urine output, time to renal recovery, sur-
vival, ICU stay, hospital stay, or arrhythmias [282, 283]. 
Thus, the available data do not support administration of 
low doses of dopamine solely to maintain renal function.
Myocardial dysfunction consequent to infection occurs 
in a subset of patients with septic shock, but cardiac 
 327
output is usually preserved by ventricular dilation, tach-
ycardia, and reduced vascular resistance [284]. Some 
portion of these patients may have diminished cardiac 
reserve, and may not be able to achieve a cardiac out-
put adequate to support oxygen delivery. Recognition of 
such reduced cardiac reserve can be challenging; imag-
ing studies that show decreased ejection fraction may not 
necessarily indicate inadequate cardiac output. Concomi-
tant measurement of cardiac output along with a meas-
ure of the adequacy of perfusion is preferable.
Routinely increasing cardiac output to predeter-
mined “supranormal” levels in all patients clearly does 
not improve outcomes, as shown by two large prospec-
tive clinical trials of critically ill ICU patients with sepsis 
treated with dobutamine [285–287].
Some patients, however, may have improved tissue per-
fusion with inotropic therapy aimed at increasing oxygen 
delivery. In this situation, dobutamine is the first-choice 
inotrope for patients with measured or suspected low 
cardiac output in the presence of adequate left ventric-
ular filling pressure (or clinical assessment of adequate 
fluid resuscitation) and adequate MAP. Monitoring the 
response of indices of perfusion to measured increases 
in cardiac output is the best way to target such a therapy 
[287].
The data supporting dobutamine are primarily physio-
logic, with improved hemodynamics and some improve-
ment in indices of perfusion, which may include clinical 
improvement, decreasing lactate levels, and improve-
ment in Scvo2. No randomized controlled trials have 
compared the effects of dobutamine versus placebo on 
clinical outcomes. Mortality in patients randomized to 
dobutamine added to norepinephrine was no different 
compared to epinephrine [287], although the trial may 
have been underpowered. Dobutamine was used as the 
first-line inotrope as part of standard care in clinical trials 
of EGDT [16, 19, 288, 289], and adverse effects on mor-
tality were not detected with its use.
Although there are only a few studies, alternative ino-
tropic agents might be used to increase cardiac out-
put in specific situations. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
increase intracellular cyclic AMP and thus have ino-
tropic effects independent of β-adrenergic receptors. 
The phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone was shown to 
increase cardiac output in one small randomized trial of 
12 pediatric patients, but the trial was underpowered for 
assessment of outcomes [290]. Levosimendan increases 
cardiac myocyte calcium responsiveness and also opens 
ATP-dependent potassium channels, giving the drug 
both inotropic and vasodilatory properties. Given the 
potential role for abnormal calcium handling in sepsis-
induced myocardial depression, the use of levosimendan 
has been proposed in septic shock as well. In a trial of 35 
patients with septic shock and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) randomized to levosimendan or pla-
cebo, levosimendan improved right ventricular perfor-
mance and mixed venous oxygen saturation compared 
to placebo [291]. Trials comparing levosimendan with 
dobutamine are limited but show no clear advantage for 
levosimendan [292]. Levosimendan is more expensive 
than dobutamine and is not available in many parts of 
the world. Six small RCTs (116 patients in total) com-
pared levosimendan to dobutamine; pooled estimates 
showed no significant effect on mortality (RR 0.83; 95% 
CI 0.66–1.05; low quality) (ESM 11). Given the low-qual-
ity evidence available and the higher cost associated with 
levosimendan, dobutamine remains the preferred choice 
in this population. An RCT enrolled 516 patients with 
septic shock who were randomized to receive either levo-
simendan or placebo; there was no difference in mortal-
ity. However, levosimendan led to significantly higher risk 
of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia than placebo (abso-
lute difference, 2.7%; 95% CI 0.1–5.3%) [293]. The results 
of this trial question the systematic use of this agent in 
patients with septic shock. Of note, cardiac function was 
not evaluated in that trial, and inotropic stimulation may 
be of benefit in patients with a low cardiac output due to 
impaired cardiac function.
6. We suggest that all patients requiring vasopres-
sors have an arterial catheter placed as soon as 
practical if resources are available (weak recom-
mendation, very low quality of evidence).
Rationale In shock states, estimation of blood pres-
sure using a cuff, especially an automated measurement 
system, may be inaccurate. Use of an arterial cannula 
provides a more accurate and reproducible measure-
ment of arterial pressure [287, 294] and also allows beat-
to-beat analysis so that decisions regarding therapy can 
be based on immediate and reproducible blood pressure 
information [295]. Insertion of radial arterial catheters is 
generally safe; a systematic review of observational stud-
ies showed an incidence of limb ischemia and bleeding 
to be less than 1%, with the most common complication 
being localized hematoma (14%) [296]. Complication 
rates may be lower if an ultrasound-guided technique is 
used [297]. A recent systematic review showed higher 
risk of infections when femoral arterial catheters were 
used compared to radial artery catheters (RR 1.93; 95% 
CI 1.32–2.84), and the overall pooled incidence of blood-
stream infection was 3.4 per 1000 catheters [298]. Large 
randomized trials that compare arterial blood pressure 
monitoring versus noninvasive methods are lacking.
In view of the low complication rate and likely bet-
ter estimation of blood pressure but potentially limited 
 328
resources in some countries, and the lack of high qual-
ity studies, the benefits of arterial catheters probably 
outweigh the risks. Therefore, we issued a weak recom-
mendation in favor of arterial catheter placement. Arte-
rial catheters should be removed as soon as continuous 
hemodynamic monitoring is not required to minimize 
the risk of complications.
H. CORTICOSTEROIDS
1. We suggest against using IV hydrocortisone 
to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid 
resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able 
to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not 
achievable, we suggest IV hydrocortisone at a 
dose of 200 mg per day (weak recommendation, 
low quality of evidence).
Rationale The response of septic shock patients to 
fluid and vasopressor therapy seems to be an important 
factor in selection of patients for optional hydrocorti-
sone therapy. One French multicenter RCT of patients 
in vasopressor-unresponsive septic shock (systolic blood 
pressure <90 mm Hg despite fluid resuscitation and vaso-
pressors for more than 1 h) showed significant shock 
reversal and reduction of mortality rate in patients with 
relative adrenal insufficiency [defined as a maximal post-
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cortisol increase 
≤9 μg/dL] [299]. Two smaller RCTs also showed signifi-
cant effects on shock reversal with steroid therapy [300, 
301]. In contrast, a large, European multicenter trial 
(CORTICUS) that enrolled patients with systolic blood 
pressure of <90 mm Hg despite adequate fluid replace-
ment or need for vasopressors had a lower risk of death 
than the French trial and failed to show a mortality ben-
efit with steroid therapy [302]. There was no difference in 
mortality in groups stratified by ACTH response.
Several systematic reviews have examined the use of low-
dose hydrocortisone in septic shock with contradictory 
results. Annane et al. [299] analyzed the results of 12 stud-
ies and calculated a significant reduction in 28-day mortality 
with prolonged low-dose steroid treatment in adult septic 
shock patients (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.97; p = 0.02). In par-
allel, Sligl et al. [303] used a similar technique, but identified 
only eight studies for their meta-analysis, six of which had a 
high-level RCT design with low risk of bias. In contrast to 
the aforementioned review, this analysis revealed no statis-
tically significant difference in mortality (RR 1.00; 95% CI 
0.84–1.18). Both reviews, however, confirmed the improved 
shock reversal by using low-dose hydrocortisone. More 
recently, Annane et al. included 33 eligible trials (n = 4268) 
in a new systematic review [304]. Of these 33 trials, 23 
were at low risk of selection bias; 22 were at low risk of 
performance and detection bias; 27 were at low risk of attri-
tion bias; and 14 were at low risk of selective reporting. Cor-
ticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality (27 trials; n = 3176; 
RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76–1.00). Treatment with a long course 
of low-dose corticosteroids significantly reduced 28-day 
mortality (22 trials; RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78–0.97). Corticos-
teroids also reduced ICU mortality (13 trials; RR 0.82; 95% 
CI 0.68–1.00) and in hospital mortality (17 trials; RR 0.85; 
95% CI 0.73–0.98). Corticosteroids increased the propor-
tion of shock reversal by day 7 (12 trials; RR 1.31; 95% CI 
1.14–1.51) and by day 28 (seven trials; n = 1013; RR 1.11; 
95% CI 1.02–1.21). Finally, an additional systematic review 
by Volbeda et al. including a total of 35 trials randomizing 
4682 patients has been published (all but two trials had high 
risk of bias) [305]. Conversely, in this review, no statisti-
cally significant effect on mortality was found for any dose 
of steroids versus placebo or for no intervention at maximal 
follow-up. The two trials with low risk of bias also showed 
no statistically significant difference (random-effects model 
RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.06–2.42). Similar results were obtained in 
subgroups of trials stratified according to hydrocortisone (or 
equivalent) at high (>500 mg) or low (≤500 mg) doses [RR 
0.87; trial sequential analysis (TSA)-adjusted CI; 0.38–1.99; 
and RR 0.90; TSA-adjusted CI 0.49–1.67, respectively]. No 
statistically significant effects on serious adverse events 
other than mortality were reported (RR 1.02; TSA-adjusted 
CI 0.7–1.48). In the absence of convincing evidence of ben-
efit, we issue a weak recommendation against the use of cor-
ticosteroids to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid 
resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore 
hemodynamic stability.
In one study, the observation of a potential interac-
tion between steroid use and ACTH test was not sta-
tistically significant [306]. Furthermore, no evidence of 
this distinction was observed between responders and 
nonresponders in a recent multicenter trial [302]. Ran-
dom cortisol levels may still be useful for absolute adre-
nal insufficiency; however, for septic shock patients who 
have relative adrenal insufficiency (no adequate stress 
response), random cortisol levels have not been demon-
strated to be useful. Cortisol immunoassays may over- 
or underestimate the actual cortisol level, affecting the 
assignment of patients to responders or nonresponders 
[307]. Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is 
now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction 
for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic–pitui-
tary–adrenal axis [308, 309]. Moreover, a subanalysis of 
the CORTICUS trial revealed that the use of etomidate 
before application of low-dose steroids was associated 
with an increased 28-day mortality rate [302].
There has been no comparative study between a fixed-
duration and clinically guided regimen or between taper-
ing and abrupt cessation of steroids. Three RCTs used a 
 329
fixed-duration protocol for treatment [300, 302, 306], 
and therapy was decreased after shock resolution in two 
RCTs [301, 310]. In four studies, steroids were tapered 
over several days [300–302, 310] and steroids were with-
drawn abruptly in two RCTs [306, 311]. One crossover 
study showed hemodynamic and immunologic rebound 
effects after abrupt cessation of corticosteroids [312]. 
Further, one study revealed no difference in outcome of 
septic shock patients if low-dose hydrocortisone is used 
for 3 or 7 days; hence, we suggest tapering steroids when 
vasopressors are no longer needed [313].
Steroids may be indicated when there is a history of 
steroid therapy or adrenal dysfunction, but whether 
low-dose steroids have a preventive potency in reducing 
the incidence of sepsis and septic shock in critically ill 
patients cannot be answered. A recent large multicenter 
RCT demonstrated no reduction in the development of 
septic shock in septic patients treated with hydrocorti-
sone versus placebo [314]; steroids should not be used in 
septic patients to prevent septic shock. Additional studies 
are underway that may provide additional information to 
inform clinical practice.
Several randomized trials on the use of low-dose 
hydrocortisone in septic shock patients revealed a signifi-
cant increase of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia [306] 
as side effects. A small prospective study demonstrated 
that repetitive bolus application of hydrocortisone leads 
to a significant increase in blood glucose; this peak effect 
was not detectable during continuous infusion. Further, 
considerable inter-individual variability was seen in this 
blood glucose peak after the hydrocortisone bolus [315]. 
Although an association of hyperglycemia and hyper-
natremia with patient outcome measures could not be 
shown, good practice includes strategies for avoidance 
and/or detection of these side effects.
I. BLOOD PRODUCTS
1. We recommend that RBC transfusion occur only 
when hemoglobin concentration decreases to 
<7.0 g/dL in adults in the absence of extenuat-
ing circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, 
severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage (strong 
recommendation, high quality of evidence).
Rationale Two clinical trials in septic patients evalu-
ated specific blood transfusion thresholds. The Transfu-
sion Requirements In Septic Shock (TRISS) trial addressed 
a transfusion threshold of 7 versus 9 g/dL in septic shock 
patients after admission to the ICU [316]. Results showed 
similar 90-day mortality, ischemic events, and use of life 
support in the two treatment groups with fewer transfu-
sions in the lower-threshold group. The hemoglobin targets 
in two of the three treatment arms in the Protocol-Based 
Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial were a sub-
part of a more comprehensive sepsis management strategy 
[18]. The EGDT group received transfusion at a hemato-
crit <30% (hemoglobin 10 g/dL) when the Scvo2 was <70% 
after initial resuscitation interventions compared to the 
protocol-based standard care group that received blood 
transfusion only when the hemoglobin was <7.5 g/dL. 
No significant differences were found between the two 
groups for 60-day in-hospital mortality or 90-day mortal-
ity. Although the ProCESS trial is a less direct assessment 
of blood transfusion therapy, it does provide important 
information in regard to transfusion in the acute resuscita-
tive phase of sepsis. We judge the evidence to be high cer-
tainty that there is little difference in mortality, and, if there 
is, that it would favor lower hemoglobin thresholds.
2. We recommend against the use of erythropoietin 
for treatment of anemia associated with sepsis 
(strong recommendation, moderate quality of evi-
dence).
Rationale No specific information regarding eryth-
ropoietin use in septic patients is available, and clini-
cal trials of erythropoietin administration in critically 
ill patients show a small decrease in red cell transfusion 
requirement with no effect on mortality [317, 318]. The 
effect of erythropoietin in sepsis and septic shock would 
not be expected to be more beneficial than in other criti-
cal conditions. Erythropoietin administration may be 
associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic 
events in the critically ill. Patients with sepsis and septic 
shock may have coexisting conditions that meet indica-
tions for the use of erythropoietin or similar agents.
3. We suggest against the use of fresh frozen plasma 
to correct clotting abnormalities in the absence 
of bleeding or planned invasive procedures (weak 
recommendation, very low quality of evidence).
Rationale No RCTs exist related to prophylactic fresh 
frozen plasma transfusion in septic or critically ill patients 
with coagulation abnormalities. Current recommendations 
are based primarily on expert opinion that fresh frozen 
plasma be transfused when there is a documented defi-
ciency of coagulation factors (increased prothrombin time, 
international normalized ratio, or partial thromboplastin 
time) and the presence of active bleeding or before surgi-
cal or invasive procedures [319]. In addition, transfusion of 
fresh frozen plasma usually fails to correct the prothrombin 
time in nonbleeding patients with mild abnormalities. No 
studies suggest that correction of more severe coagulation 
abnormalities benefits patients who are not bleeding.
 330
4. We suggest prophylactic platelet transfusion 
when counts are <10,000/mm3 (10 × 109/L) in the 
absence of apparent bleeding and when counts are 
<20,000/mm3 (20 × 109/L) if the patient has a sig-
nificant risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts 
[≥50,000/mm3 (50 × 109/L)] are advised for active 
bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures (weak 
recommendation, very low quality of evidence).
Rationale No RCTs of prophylactic platelet transfu-
sion in septic or critically ill patients exist. Current rec-
ommendations and guidelines for platelet transfusion are 
based on clinical trials of prophylactic platelet transfu-
sion in patients with therapy-induced thrombocytopenia 
(usually leukemia and stem cell transplant) [320–327]. 
Thrombocytopenia in sepsis is likely due to a different 
pathophysiology of impaired platelet production and 
increased platelet consumption. Factors that may increase 
the bleeding risk and indicate the need for a higher plate-
let count are frequently present in patients with sepsis.
J. IMMUNOGLOBULINS
1. We suggest against the use of IV immunoglobu-
lins in patients with sepsis or septic shock (weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale There were no new studies informing this 
guideline recommendation. One larger multicenter RCT 
(n = 624) [328] in adult patients found no benefit for 
IV immunoglobulin (IVIg). The most recent Cochrane 
meta-analysis [329] differentiates between standard poly-
clonal IV immunoglobulins (IVIgG) and immunoglobulin 
M-enriched polyclonal Ig (IVIgGM). In ten studies with 
IVIgG (1430 patients), mortality between 28 and 180 days 
was 29.6% in the IVIgG group and 36.5% in the placebo-
group (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70–0.93), and for the seven 
studies with IVIgGM (528 patients), mortality between 28 
and 60 days was 24.7% in the IVIgGM group and 37.5% in 
the placebo-group (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51–0.85). The cer-
tainty of the studies was rated as low for the IVIgG trials, 
based on risk of bias and heterogeneity, and as moderate 
for the IVIgGM trials, based on risk of bias. Comparable 
results were found in other meta-analyses [330]. However, 
after excluding low-quality trials, the recent Cochrane 
analysis [329] revealed no survival benefit.
These findings are in accordance with those of two older 
meta-analyses [331, 332] from other Cochrane authors. 
One systematic review [332] included a total of 21 trials 
and showed a reduction in death with immunoglobu-
lin treatment (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.68–0.88); however, the 
results of only high-quality trials (total of 763 patients) 
did not show a statistically significant difference (RR 1.02; 
95% CI 0.84–1.24). Similarly, Laupland et al. [331] found 
a significant reduction in mortality with the use of IVIg 
treatment (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53–0.83; p < 0.005). When 
only high-quality studies were pooled, the results were no 
longer statistically significant (OR 0.96); OR for mortality 
was 0.96 (95% CI 0.71–1.3; p = 0.78). Two meta-analyses 
that used less strict criteria to identify sources of bias or 
did not state their criteria for the assessment of study 
quality found significant improvement in patient mortal-
ity with IVIg treatment [333–335]. Finally, there are no 
cutoffs for plasma IgG levels in septic patients, for which 
substitution with IVIgG improves outcome data [334].
Most IVIg studies are small, and some have a high risk of 
bias; the only large study (n = 624) showed no effect [328]. 
Subgroup effects between IgM-enriched and non-enriched 
formulations reveal significant heterogeneity. Indirectness 
and publication bias were considered, but not invoked in 
grading this recommendation. The low certainty of evi-
dence led to the grading as a weak recommendation. The 
statistical information that comes from the high-quality 
trials does not support a beneficial effect of polyclonal 
IVIg. We encourage conduct of large multicenter studies 
to further evaluate the effectiveness of other IV polyclonal 
immunoglobulin preparations in patients with sepsis.
K. BLOOD PURIFICATION
1. We make no recommendation regarding the use 
of blood purification techniques.
Rationale Blood purification includes various tech-
niques, such as high-volume hemofiltration and hemoad-
sorption (or hemoperfusion), where sorbents, removing 
either endotoxin or cytokines, are placed in contact with 
blood; plasma exchange or plasma filtration, through 
which plasma is separated from whole blood, removed, 
and replaced with normal saline, albumin, or fresh frozen 
plasma; and the hybrid system: coupled plasma filtration 
adsorption (CPFA), which combines plasma filtration and 
adsorption by a resin cartridge that removes cytokines.
When these modalities of blood purification are con-
sidered versus conventional treatment, the available trials 
are, overall, small, unblinded, and with high risk of bias. 
Patient selection was unclear and differed with the various 
techniques. Hemoadsorption is the technique most largely 
investigated, in particular with polymyxin B-immobilized 
polystyrene-derived fibers to remove endotoxin from the 
blood. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a favorable 
effect on overall mortality with this technique [336]. The 
composite effect, however, depends on a series of studies 
performed in a single country (Japan), predominantly by 
one group of investigators. A recent large RCT performed 
on patients with peritonitis related to organ perforation 
 331
within 12 h after emergency surgery found no benefit 
of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on mortality and organ 
failure, as compared to standard treatment [337]. Illness 
severity of the study patients, however, was low overall, 
which makes these findings questionable. A multicenter 
blinded RCT is ongoing, which should provide stronger 
evidence regarding this technique [338].
Few RCTs evaluated plasma filtration, alone or com-
bined with adsorption for cytokine removal (CPFA). A 
recent RCT comparing CPFA with standard treatment 
was stopped for futility [339]. About half of the patients 
randomized to CPFA were undertreated, primarily 
because of clotting of the circuit, which raises doubts 
about CPFA feasibility.
In consideration of all these limitations, our con-
fidence in the evidence is very low either in favor of or 
against blood purification techniques; therefore, we 
do not provide a recommendation. Further research is 
needed to clarify the clinical benefit of blood purification 
techniques.
L. ANTICOAGULANTS
1. We recommend against the use of antithrom-
bin for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock 
(strong recommendation, moderate quality of 
evidence).
Rationale Antithrombin is the most abundant antico-
agulant circulating in plasma. The decrease of its plasma 
activity at onset of sepsis correlates with disseminated intra-
vascular coagulation (DIC) and lethal outcome. However, a 
phase III clinical trial of high-dose antithrombin for adults 
with sepsis and septic shock as well as systematic reviews of 
antithrombin for critically ill patients did not demonstrate 
any beneficial effect on overall mortality. Antithrombin was 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding [340, 341]. 
Although post hoc subgroup analyses of patients with sep-
sis associated with DIC showed better survival in patients 
receiving antithrombin, this agent cannot be recommended 
until further clinical trials are performed.
2. We make no recommendation regarding the use 
of thrombomodulin or heparin for the treatment 
of sepsis or septic shock.
Rationale Most RCTs of recombinant soluble throm-
bomodulin have been targeted for sepsis associated 
with DIC, and a systematic review suggested a beneficial 
effect on survival without an increase of bleeding risk 
[342, 343]. A phase III RCT is ongoing for sepsis associ-
ated with DIC. The guideline panel has elected to make 
no recommendation pending these new results. Two 
systematic reviews showed a potential survival benefit 
of heparin in patients with sepsis without an increase in 
major bleeding [344]. However, overall impact remains 
uncertain, and heparin cannot be recommended until 
further RCTs are performed.
Recombinant activated protein C, which was originally 
recommended in the 2004 and 2008 SSC guidelines, was 
not shown to be effective for adult patients with septic 
shock by the PROWESS-SHOCK trial, and was with-
drawn from the market [345].
M. MECHANICAL VENTILATION
1. We recommend using a target tidal volume of 
6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) compared 
with 12 mL/kg in adult patients with sepsis-
induced ARDS (strong recommendation, high 
quality of evidence).
2. We recommend using an upper limit goal for pla-
teau pressures of 30 cmH2O over higher plateau 
pressures in adult patients with sepsis-induced 
severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate 
quality of evidence).
Rationale This recommendation is unchanged from 
the previous guidelines. Of note, the studies that guide 
the recommendations in this section enrolled patients 
using criteria from the American–European Consen-
sus Criteria Definition for Acute Lung Injury and ARDS 
[346]. For the current document, we used the 2012 Berlin 
definition and the terms mild, moderate, and severe ARDS 
(Pao2/Fio2 ≤300, ≤200, and ≤100 mm Hg, respectively) 
[347]. Several multicenter randomized trials have been 
performed in patients with established ARDS to evaluate 
the effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through mod-
eration of tidal volume [348–351]. These studies showed 
differing results, which may have been caused by differ-
ences in airway pressures in the treatment and control 
groups [347, 351, 353]. Several meta-analyses suggest 
decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and vol-
ume-limited strategy for established ARDS [353, 354].
The largest trial of a volume- and pressure-limited 
strategy showed 9% absolute decrease in mortality in 
ARDS patients ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg 
compared with 12 mL/kg PBW, and aiming for plateau 
pressure ≤30 cmH2O [350]. The use of lung-protective 
strategies for patients with ARDS is supported by clini-
cal trials and has been widely accepted; however, the pre-
cise tidal volume for an individual ARDS patient requires 
adjustment for factors such as the plateau pressure, the 
selected positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), thora-
coabdominal compliance, and the patient’s breathing 
effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high 
 332
minute ventilation, or short stature may require addi-
tional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians 
believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes 
>6 mL/kg PBW as long as plateau pressure can be main-
tained ≤30 cmH2O [355, 356]. The validity of this ceiling 
value will depend on the patient’s effort, because those 
who are actively breathing generate higher transpulmo-
nary pressures for a given plateau pressure than patients 
who are passively inflated. Conversely, patients with 
very stiff chest/abdominal walls and high pleural pres-
sures may tolerate plateau pressures >30 cmH2O because 
transpulmonary pressures will be lower. A retrospective 
study suggested that tidal volumes should be lowered 
even with plateau pressures ≤30 cmH2O [357] because 
lower plateau pressures were associated with reduced 
hospital mortality [358]. A recent patient-level media-
tion analysis suggested that a tidal volume that results 
in a driving pressure (plateau pressure minus set PEEP) 
below 12–15 cmH2O may be advantageous in patients 
without spontaneous breathing efforts [359]. Prospective 
validation of tidal volume titration by driving pressure is 
needed before this approach can be recommended.
High tidal volumes coupled with high plateau pressures 
should be avoided in ARDS. Clinicians should use as a start-
ing point the objective of reducing tidal volume over 1–2 h 
from its initial value toward the goal of a “low” tidal volume 
(≈6 mL/kg PBW) achieved in conjunction with an end-
inspiratory plateau pressure ≤30 cmH2O. If plateau pres-
sure remains >30 cmH2O after reduction of tidal volume to 
6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may be further reduced to as 
low as 4 mL/kg PBW. Respiratory rate should be increased 
to a maximum of 35 breaths/min during tidal volume reduc-
tion to maintain minute ventilation. Volume- and pressure-
limited ventilation may lead to hypercapnia even with these 
maximum tolerated set respiratory rates; this appears to be 
tolerated and safe in the absence of contraindications (e.g., 
high intracranial pressure, sickle cell crisis).
No single mode of ventilation (pressure control, vol-
ume control) has consistently been shown to be advan-
tageous when compared with any other that respects the 
same principles of lung protection.
3. We suggest using higher PEEP over lower PEEP 
in adult patients with sepsis-induced moderate to 
severe ARDS (weak recommendation, moderate 
quality of evidence).
Rationale Raising PEEP in ARDS may open lung units 
to participate in gas exchange. This may increase Pao2 
when PEEP is applied through either an endotracheal 
tube or a face mask [360–362]. In animal experiments, 
avoidance of end-expiratory alveolar collapse helps mini-
mize ventilator-induced lung injury when relatively high 
plateau pressures are in use. Three large multicenter tri-
als and a pilot trial using higher versus lower levels of 
PEEP in conjunction with low tidal volumes did not 
show benefit or harm [363–366]. A patient-level meta-
analysis showed no benefit in all patients with ARDS; 
however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (Pao2/
Fio2 ≤200 mm Hg) had decreased mortality with the 
use of higher PEEP, whereas those with mild ARDS did 
not [367]. A patient-level analysis of two of the rand-
omized PEEP trials suggested a survival benefit if Pao2/
Fio2 increased with higher PEEP and harm if Pao2/Fio2 
fell [368]. A small randomized trial suggested that adjust-
ing PEEP to obtain a positive transpulmonary pressure as 
estimated by esophageal manometry improved outcomes; 
a confirmatory trial is underway [369]. An analysis of 
nearly all the randomized trials of lung-protective ventila-
tion suggested a benefit of higher PEEP if driving pressure 
fell with increased PEEP, presumably indicating increased 
lung compliance from opening of lung units [359].
While moderate-quality evidence suggests that higher 
PEEP improves outcomes in moderate to severe ARDS, 
the optimal method for selecting a higher PEEP level is 
unclear. One option is to titrate PEEP according to bed-
side measurements of thoracopulmonary compliance 
with the objective of obtaining the best compliance or 
lowest driving pressure, reflecting a favorable balance 
of lung recruitment and overdistension [370]. The sec-
ond option is to titrate PEEP upward on a tidal volume 
of 6 mL/kg PBW until the plateau airway pressure is 
28 cmH2O [365]. A third option is to use a PEEP/Fio2 
titration table that titrates PEEP based on the combina-
tion of Fio2 and PEEP required to maintain adequate 
oxygenation [350, 363–365, 368]. A PEEP >5 cmH2O is 
usually required to avoid lung collapse [371].
4. We suggest using recruitment maneuvers in adult 
patients with sepsis-induced, severe ARDS (weak 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale Many strategies exist for treating refractory 
hypoxemia in patients with severe ARDS [372]. Tem-
porarily raising transpulmonary pressure may facilitate 
opening atelectatic alveoli to permit gas exchange [371], 
but could also overdistend aerated lung units, leading to 
ventilator-induced lung injury and transient hypoten-
sion. The application of sustained continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) appears to improve survival (RR 
0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95) and reduce the occurrence of 
severe hypoxia requiring rescue therapy (RR 0.76; 95% CI 
0.41–1.40) in patients with ARDS. Although the effects 
of recruitment maneuvers improve oxygenation ini-
tially, the effects can be transient [373]. Selected patients 
with severe hypoxemia may benefit from recruitment 
 333
maneuvers in conjunction with higher levels of PEEP, 
but little evidence supports the routine use in all ARDS 
patients [373]. Any patient receiving this therapy should 
be monitored closely and recruitment maneuvers discon-
tinued if deterioration in clinical variables is observed.
5. We recommend using prone over supine position 
in adult patients with sepsis-induced ARDS and 
a Pao2/Fio2 ratio <150 (strong recommendation, 
moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale In patients with ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 ratio 
<150, the use of prone compared with supine position 
within the first 36 h of intubation, when performed for 
>16 h a day, showed improved survival [374]. Meta-anal-
ysis including this study demonstrated reduced mortal-
ity in patients treated with prone compared with supine 
position (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71–1.01) as well as improved 
oxygenation as measured by change in Pao2/Fio2 ratio 
(median 24.03 higher, 95% CI 13.3–34.7 higher) [375]. 
Most patients respond to the prone position with 
improved oxygenation and may also have improved lung 
compliance [374, 376–379]. While prone position may be 
associated with potentially life-threatening complications 
including accidental removal of the endotracheal tube, 
this was not evident in pooled analysis (RR 1.09; 95% CI 
0.85–1.39). However, prone position was associated with 
an increase in pressure sores (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.05–1.79) 
[375], and some patients have contraindications to the 
prone position [374].
In patients with refractory hypoxia, alternative strate-
gies, including airway pressure release ventilation and 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be con-
sidered as rescue therapies in experienced centers [372, 
380–383].
6. We recommend against using high-frequency 
oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in adult patients 
with sepsis-induced ARDS (strong recommenda-
tion, moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale HFOV has theoretical advantages that make 
it an attractive ventilator mode for patients with ARDS. 
Two large RCTs evaluating routine HFOV in moderate-
severe ARDS have been recently published [384, 385]. 
One trial was stopped early because the mortality was 
higher in patients randomized to HFOV [384]. Including 
these recent studies, a total of five RCTs (1580 patients) 
have examined the role of HFOV in ARDS. Pooled analy-
sis demonstrates no effect on mortality (RR 1.04; 95% 
CI 0.83–1.31) and an increased duration of mechani-
cal ventilation (MD, 1.1 days higher; 95% CI 0.03–2.16) 
in patients randomized to HFOV. An increase in baro-
trauma was seen in patients receiving HFOV (RR 1.19; 
95% CI 0.83–1.72); however, this was based on very low-
quality evidence.
The role of HFOV as a rescue technique for refractory 
ARDS remains unclear; however, we recommend against 
its early use in moderate-severe ARDS given the lack of 
demonstrated benefit and a potential signal for harm.
7. We make no recommendation regarding the use 
of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for patients with 
sepsis-induced ARDS.
Rationale NIV may have theoretical benefits in 
patients with sepsis-induced respiratory failure, such 
as better communication abilities, reduced need for 
sedation, and avoidance of intubation. However, NIV 
may preclude the use of low tidal volume ventilation or 
achieving adequate levels of PEEP, two ventilation strat-
egies that have shown benefit even in mild-moderate 
ARDS [365, 386]. Also, in contrast to indications such 
as cardiogenic pulmonary edema or chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease exacerbation where NIV use is brief, 
ARDS often takes days or weeks to improve, and pro-
longed NIV use may lead to complications such as facial 
skin breakdown, inadequate nutritional intake, and fail-
ure to rest respiratory muscles.
A few small RCTs have shown benefit with NIV for 
early or mild ARDS or de novo hypoxic respiratory fail-
ure; however, these were in highly selected patient popu-
lations [387, 388]. More recently, a larger RCT in patients 
with hypoxemic respiratory failure compared NIV to 
traditional oxygen therapy or high-flow nasal cannula 
[389]. This study demonstrated improved 90-day survival 
with high-flow oxygen compared with standard therapy 
or NIV; however, the NIV technique was not standard-
ized and the experience of the centers varied. Although 
high-flow oxygen has not been addressed here, it is pos-
sible that this technique may play a more prominent role 
in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS 
moving forward.
Given the uncertainty regarding whether clinicians can 
identify ARDS patients in whom NIV might be benefi-
cial, we have not made a recommendation for or against 
this intervention. If NIV is used for patients with ARDS, 
we suggest close monitoring of tidal volumes.
8. We suggest using neuromuscular blocking agents 
(NMBAs) for ≤48 h in adult patients with sepsis-
induced ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 ratio <150 mm Hg 
(weak recommendation, moderate quality of evi-
dence).
 334
Rationale The most common indication for NMBA 
use in the ICU is to facilitate mechanical ventilation 
[390]. When appropriately used, these agents may 
improve chest wall compliance, prevent respiratory dys-
synchrony, and reduce peak airway pressures [391]. Mus-
cle paralysis may also reduce oxygen consumption by 
decreasing the work of breathing and respiratory muscle 
blood flow [392]. However, a placebo-controlled RCT 
in patients with severe sepsis demonstrated that oxy-
gen delivery, oxygen consumption, and gastric intramu-
cosal pH were not improved during deep neuromuscular 
blockade [393].
An RCT of continuous infusions of cisatracurium in 
patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 <150 mm 
Hg showed improved adjusted survival rates and more 
organ failure-free days without an increased risk in 
ICU-acquired weakness compared with placebo-treated 
patients [394]. The investigators used a high fixed dose of 
cisatracurium without train-of-four monitoring; half of 
the patients in the placebo group received at least a sin-
gle NMBA dose. Of note, groups in both the intervention 
and control groups were ventilated with volume-cycled 
and pressure-limited mechanical ventilation. Although 
many of the patients in this trial appeared to meet sep-
sis criteria, it is not clear whether similar results would 
occur in sepsis patients or in patients ventilated with 
alternate modes. Pooled analysis including three trials 
that examined the role of NMBAs in ARDS, including the 
one above, showed improved survival (RR 0.72; 95% CI 
0.58–0.91) and a decreased frequency of barotrauma (RR 
0.43; 95% CI 0.20–0.90) in those receiving NMBAs [395].
An association between NMBA use and myopathies 
and neuropathies has been suggested by case studies 
and prospective observational studies in the critical care 
population [391, 396–399], but the mechanisms by which 
NMBAs produce or contribute to myopathies and neu-
ropathies in these patients are unknown. Pooled analysis 
of the RCT data did not show an increase in neuromus-
cular weakness in those who received NMBAs (RR 1.08; 
95% CI 0.83–1.41); however, this was based on very low 
quality of evidence [395]. Given the uncertainty that 
still exists pertaining to these important outcomes and 
the balance between benefits and potential harms, the 
panel decided that a weak recommendation was most 
suitable. If NMBAs are used, clinicians must ensure ade-
quate patient sedation and analgesia [400, 401]; recently 
updated clinical practice guidelines are available for spe-
cific guidance [402].
9. We recommend a conservative fluid strategy for 
patients with established sepsis-induced ARDS 
who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion 
(strong recommendation, moderate quality of evi-
dence).
Rationale Mechanisms for the development of pul-
monary edema in patients with ARDS include increased 
capillary permeability, increased hydrostatic pressure, 
and decreased oncotic pressure [403]. Small prospec-
tive studies in patients with critical illness and ARDS 
have suggested that low weight gain is associated with 
improved oxygenation [404] and fewer days of mechani-
cal ventilation [405, 406]. A fluid-conservative strategy 
to minimize fluid infusion and weight gain in patients 
with ARDS, based on either a CVP or a pulmonary 
artery (PA) catheter (PA wedge pressure) measure-
ment, along with clinical variables to guide treatment, 
led to fewer days of mechanical ventilation and reduced 
ICU LOS without altering the incidence of renal failure 
or mortality rates [407]. This strategy was only used in 
patients with established ARDS, some of whom had 
shock during their ICU stay, and active attempts to 
reduce fluid volume were conducted only outside peri-
ods of shock.
10. We recommend against the use of β-2 agonists 
for the treatment of patients with sepsis-induced 
ARDS without bronchospasm (strong recom-
mendation, moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale Patients with sepsis-induced ARDS often 
develop increased vascular permeability; preclinical data 
suggest that β-adrenergic agonists may hasten resorption 
of alveolar edema [408]. Three RCTs (646 patients) evalu-
ated β-agonists in patients with ARDS [408–410]. In two 
of these trials, salbutamol (15 μg/kg of ideal body weight) 
delivered intravenously [408, 409] was compared with 
placebo, while the third trial compared inhaled albuterol 
versus placebo [410]. Group allocation was blinded in all 
three trials, and two trials were stopped early for futil-
ity or harm [409–411]. More than half of the patients 
enrolled in all three trials had pulmonary or non-pulmo-
nary sepsis as the cause of ARDS.
Pooled analysis suggests β-agonists may reduce survival 
to hospital discharge in ARDS patients (RR 1.22; 95% CI 
0.95–1.56) while significantly decreasing the number of 
ventilator-free days (MD, −2.19; 95% CI −3.68 to −0.71) 
[412]. β-Agonist use also led to more arrhythmias (RR 
1.97; 95% CI 0.70–5.54) and more tachycardia (RR 3.95; 
95% CI 1.41–11.06).
β-2 agonists may have specific indications in the criti-
cally ill, such as the treatment of bronchospasm and 
hyperkalemia. In the absence of these conditions, we 
recommend against the use of β-agonists, either in IV or 
 335
aerosolized form, for the treatment of patients with sep-
sis-induced ARDS.
11. We recommend against the routine use of the PA 
catheter for patients with sepsis-induced ARDS 
(strong recommendation, high quality of evi-
dence).
Rationale This recommendation is unchanged from 
the previous guidelines. Although insertion of a PA cath-
eter may provide useful information regarding volume 
status and cardiac function, these benefits may be con-
founded by differences in interpretation of the results 
[413, 414], poor correlation of PA occlusion pressures 
with clinical response [415], and lack of a PA cathe-
ter-based strategy demonstrated to improve patient 
outcomes [416]. Pooled analysis of two multicenter rand-
omized trials, one with 676 patients with shock or ARDS 
[417] and another with 1000 patients with ARDS [418], 
failed to show any benefit associated with PA catheter 
use on mortality (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.96–1.09) or ICU 
LOS (mean difference 0.15 days longer; 95% CI 0.74 days 
fewer—1.03 days longer) [407, 419–421] This lack of 
demonstrated benefit must be considered in the context 
of the increased resources required. Notwithstanding, 
selected sepsis patients may be candidates for PA catheter 
insertion if management decisions depend on informa-
tion solely obtainable from PA catheter measurements.
12. We suggest using lower tidal volumes over higher 
tidal volumes in adult patients with sepsis-
induced respiratory failure without ARDS (weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale Low tidal volume ventilation (4–6 mL/kg) 
has been shown to be beneficial in patients with estab-
lished ARDS [422] by limiting ventilator-induced lung 
injury. However, the effect of volume- and pressure-lim-
ited ventilation is less clear in patients with sepsis who 
do not have ARDS. Meta-analysis demonstrates the ben-
efits of low tidal volume ventilation in patients without 
ARDS, including a decrease in the duration of mechani-
cal ventilation (MD, 0.64 days fewer; 95% CI 0.49–0.79) 
and the decreased development of ARDS (RR 0.30; 95% 
CI 0.16–0.57) with no impact on mortality (RR 0.95; 95% 
CI 0.64–1.41). Importantly, the certainty in this data is 
limited by indirectness because the included studies var-
ied significantly in terms of populations enrolled, mostly 
examining perioperative patients and very few focusing 
on ICU patients. The use of low tidal volumes in patients 
who undergo abdominal surgery, which may include sep-
sis patients, has been shown to decrease the incidence of 
respiratory failure, shorten LOS, and result in fewer post-
operative episodes of sepsis [423]. Subgroup analysis of 
only the studies that enrolled critically ill patients [424] 
suggests similar benefits of low tidal volume ventilation 
on duration of mechanical ventilation and development 
of ARDS, but is further limited by imprecision given the 
small number of studies included. Despite these method-
ologic concerns, the benefits of low tidal volume ventila-
tion in patients without ARDS are thought to outweigh 
any potential harm. Planned RCTs may inform future 
practice.
13. We recommend that mechanically ventilated sep-
sis patients be maintained with the head of the 
bed elevated between 30° and 45° to limit aspira-
tion risk and to prevent the development of VAP 
(strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale The semi-recumbent position has been 
demonstrated to decrease the incidence of VAP [425]. 
Enteral feeding increased the risk of developing VAP; 
50% of the patients who were fed enterally in the supine 
position developed VAP, compared with 9% of those fed 
in the semi-recumbent position [425]. However, the bed 
position was monitored only once a day, and patients 
who did not achieve the desired bed elevation were not 
included in the analysis [425]. One study did not show a 
difference in incidence of VAP between patients main-
tained in supine and semi-recumbent positions [426]; 
patients assigned to the semi-recumbent group did not 
consistently achieve the desired head-of-bed eleva-
tion, and the head-of-bed elevation in the supine group 
approached that of the semi-recumbent group by day 7 
[426]. When necessary, patients may be laid flat when 
indicated for procedures, hemodynamic measurements, 
and during episodes of hypotension. Patients should not 
be fed enterally while supine. There were no new pub-
lished studies since the last guidelines that would inform 
a change in the strength of the recommendation for the 
current iteration. The evidence profile for this recom-
mendation demonstrated low quality of evidence. The 
lack of new evidence, along with the low harms of head-
of-bed and high feasibility of implementation given the 
frequency of the practice resulted in the strong recom-
mendation. There is a small subgroup of patients, such as 
trauma patients with a spine injury, for whom this rec-
ommendation would not apply.
14. We recommend using spontaneous breathing tri-
als in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis 
who are ready for weaning (strong recommenda-
tion, high quality of evidence).
 336
Rationale Spontaneous breathing trial options include 
a low level of pressure support, CPAP (≈5 cmH2O), or use 
of a T-piece. A recently published clinical practice guide-
line suggests the use of inspiratory pressure augmentation 
rather than T-piece or CPAP for an initial spontaneous 
breathing trial for acutely hospitalized adults on mechani-
cal ventilation for more than 24 h [427]. Daily spontane-
ous breathing trials in appropriately selected patients 
reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and wean-
ing duration both in individual trials as well as with 
pooled analysis of the individual trials [428–430]. These 
breathing trials should be conducted in conjunction with 
a spontaneous awakening trial [431]. Successful comple-
tion of spontaneous breathing trials leads to a high like-
lihood of successful early discontinuation of mechanical 
ventilation with minimal demonstrated harm.
15. We recommend using a weaning protocol in 
mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis-
induced respiratory failure who can tolerate 
weaning 
(strong 
recommendation, 
moderate 
quality of evidence).
Rationale Protocols allow for standardization of clini-
cal pathways to facilitate desired treatment [432]. These 
protocols may include both spontaneous breathing trials, 
gradual reduction of support, and computer-generated 
weaning. Pooled analysis demonstrates that patients 
treated with protocolized weaning compared with usual 
care experienced shorter weaning duration (–39 h; 95% 
CI −67 h to −11 h), and shorter ICU LOS (–9 h; 95% CI 
−15 to −2). There was no difference between groups in 
ICU mortality (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.58–1.48) or need for 
reintubation (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.44–1.23) [428].
N. SEDATION AND ANALGESIA
1. We recommend that continuous or intermittent 
sedation be minimized in mechanically venti-
lated sepsis patients, targeting specific titration 
end points (BPS).
Rationale Limiting the use of sedation in critically ill 
ventilated patients reduces the duration of mechanical 
ventilation and ICU and hospital LOS, and allows ear-
lier mobilization [433, 434]. While these data arise from 
studies performed in a wide range of critically ill patients, 
there is little reason to believe that septic patients will not 
derive the same benefits from sedation minimization.
Several strategies have been shown to reduce sedative 
use and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Nurse-
directed protocols that incorporate a sedation scale 
likely result in improved outcomes; however, the benefit 
depends on the existing local culture and practice [435, 
436]. Another option for systematically limiting the use of 
sedation is the administration of intermittent rather than 
continuous sedation [437, 438]. Daily sedation interrup-
tion (DSI) was associated with improved outcomes in a 
single-center randomized trial compared with usual care 
[430]; however, in a multicenter RCT there was no advan-
tage to DSI when patients were managed with a sedation 
protocol, and nurses perceived a higher workload [439]. 
A recent Cochrane meta-analysis did not find strong evi-
dence that DSI alters the duration of mechanical ventila-
tion, mortality, ICU or hospital LOS, adverse event rates, 
or drug consumption for critically ill adults receiving 
mechanical ventilation compared to sedation strategies 
that do not include DSI; however, interpretation of the 
results is limited by imprecision and clinical heterogeneity 
[440]. Another strategy is the primary use of opioids alone 
and avoidance of sedatives, which was shown to be feasi-
ble in the majority of ventilated patients in a single-center 
trial, and was associated with more rapid liberation from 
mechanical ventilation [441]. Finally, the use of short-
acting drugs such as propofol and dexmedetomidine may 
result in better outcomes than the use of benzodiazepines 
[442–444]. Recent pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines 
provide additional detail on implementation of sedation 
management, including nonpharmacologic approaches 
for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium [445].
Regardless of approach, a large body of indirect evidence 
is available demonstrating the benefit of limiting sedation 
in those requiring mechanical ventilation and without 
contraindication. As such, this should be best practice for 
any critically ill patient, including those with sepsis.
O. GLUCOSE CONTROL
1. We recommend a protocolized approach to blood 
glucose management in ICU patients with sepsis, 
commencing insulin dosing when two consecu-
tive blood glucose levels are >180 mg/dL. This 
approach should target an upper blood glucose 
level ≤180 mg/dL rather than an upper target 
blood glucose level ≤110 mg/dL (strong recom-
mendation, high quality of evidence).
2. We recommend that blood glucose values be 
monitored every 1–2 h until glucose values and 
insulin infusion rates are stable, then every 4 h 
thereafter in patients receiving insulin infusions 
(BPS).
3. We recommend that glucose levels obtained with 
point-of-care testing of capillary blood be inter-
preted with caution because such measurements 
may not accurately estimate arterial blood or 
plasma glucose values (BPS).
 337
4. We suggest the use of arterial blood rather than 
capillary blood for point-of-care testing using 
glucose meters if patients have arterial catheters 
(weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale A large single-center RCT in 2001 dem-
onstrated a reduction in ICU mortality with intensive 
IV insulin (Leuven protocol) targeting blood glucose to 
80–110 mg/dL [446]. A second randomized trial of inten-
sive insulin therapy using the Leuven protocol enrolled 
medical ICU patients with an anticipated ICU LOS of 
more than three days in three medical ICUs; overall mor-
tality was not reduced [447].
Since these studies [446, 447] appeared, several RCTs 
[448–455] and meta-analyses [456–462] of intensive 
insulin therapy have been performed. The RCTs studied 
mixed populations of surgical and medical ICU patients 
and found that intensive insulin therapy did not signifi-
cantly decrease mortality, whereas the NICE-SUGAR 
trial demonstrated an increased mortality [451]. All stud-
ies reported a much higher incidence of severe hypo-
glycemia (glucose ≤40 mg/dL) (6–29%) with intensive 
insulin therapy. Several meta-analyses confirmed that 
intensive insulin therapy was not associated with a mor-
tality benefit in surgical, medical, or mixed ICU patients. 
The meta-analysis by Song et al. [462] evaluated only 
septic patients and found that intensive insulin therapy 
did not change 28- or 90-day mortality, but was associ-
ated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. The trig-
ger to start an insulin protocol for blood glucose levels 
>180 mg/dL with an upper target blood glucose level 
<180 mg/dL derives from the NICE-SUGAR trial, which 
used these values for initiating and stopping therapy. The 
NICE-SUGAR trial is the largest, most compelling study 
to date on glucose control in ICU patients given its inclu-
sion of multiple ICUs and hospitals and a general patient 
population. Several medical organizations, including 
the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, 
American Diabetes Association, American Heart Asso-
ciation, American College of Physicians, and Society 
of Critical Care Medicine, have published consensus 
statements for glycemic control of hospitalized patients 
[463, 465]. These statements usually targeted glucose 
levels between 140 and 180 mg/dL. Because there is no 
evidence that targets between 140 and 180 mg/dL are 
different from targets of 110–140 mg/dL, the present 
recommendations use an upper target blood glucose 
≤180 mg/dL without a lower target other than hypogly-
cemia. Stricter ranges, such as 110–140 mg/dL, may be 
appropriate for selected patients if this can be achieved 
without significant hypoglycemia [463, 465]. Treatment 
should avoid hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL), hypoglyce-
mia, and wide swings in glucose levels that have been 
associated with higher mortality [466–471]. The continu-
ation of insulin infusions, especially with the cessation of 
nutrition, has been identified as a risk factor for hypo-
glycemia [454]. Balanced nutrition may be associated 
with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia [472]. Hyperglyce-
mia and glucose variability seem to be unassociated with 
increased mortality rates in diabetic patients compared 
to nondiabetic patients [473–475]. Patients with diabe-
tes and chronic hyperglycemia, end-stage renal failure, or 
medical versus surgical ICU patients may require higher 
blood glucose ranges [476, 477].
Several factors may affect the accuracy and reproduc-
ibility of point-of-care testing of blood capillary blood 
glucose, including the type and model of the device used, 
user expertise, and patient factors, including hemato-
crit (false elevation with anemia), Pao2, and drugs [478]. 
Plasma glucose values by capillary point-of-care test-
ing have been found to be potentially inaccurate, with 
frequent false elevations [479–481] over the range of 
glucose levels, but especially in the hypoglycemic and 
hyperglycemic ranges [482] and in shock patients (receiv-
ing vasopressors) [478, 480]. A review of studies found 
the accuracy of glucose measurements by arterial blood 
gas analyzers and glucose meters by using arterial blood 
significantly higher than measurements with glucose 
meters using capillary blood [480].
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated that 
“critically ill patients should not be tested with a glucose 
meter because results may be inaccurate,
” and Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services have plans to enforce 
the prohibition of off-label use of point-of-care capillary 
blood glucose monitor testing in critically ill patients 
[483]. Several medical experts have stated the need for 
a moratorium on this plan [484]. Despite the attempt to 
protect patients from harm because of inaccurate capil-
lary blood testing, a prohibition might cause more harm 
because a central laboratory test may take significantly 
longer to provide results than point-of-care glucometer 
testing.
A review of 12 published insulin infusion protocols 
for critically ill patients showed wide variability in dose 
recommendations and variable glucose control [485]. 
This lack of consensus about optimal dosing of IV insu-
lin may reflect variability in patient factors (severity of 
illness, surgical versus medical settings), or practice pat-
terns (e.g., approaches to feeding, IV dextrose) in the 
environments in which these protocols were developed 
and tested. Alternatively, some protocols may be more 
effective than others, a conclusion supported by the wide 
variability in hypoglycemia rates reported with protocols. 
Thus, the use of established insulin protocols is impor-
tant not only for clinical care, but also for the conduct of 
clinical trials to avoid hypoglycemia, adverse events, and 
 338
premature termination of trials before the efficacy sig-
nal, if any, can be determined. Several studies have sug-
gested that computer-based algorithms result in tighter 
glycemic control with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia 
[486, 487]. Computerized decision support systems and 
fully automated closed-loop systems for glucose control 
are feasible, but not yet standard care. Further study of 
validated, safe, and effective protocols and closed-loop 
systems for controlling blood glucose concentrations and 
variability in the sepsis population is needed.
P. RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
1. We suggest that either continuous RRT (CRRT) 
or intermittent RRT be used in patients with sep-
sis and acute kidney injury (weak recommenda-
tion, moderate quality of evidence).
2. We suggest using CRRT to facilitate management 
of fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable 
septic patients (weak recommendation, very low 
quality of evidence).
3. We suggest against the use of RRT in patients 
with sepsis and acute kidney injury for increase 
in creatinine or oliguria without other definitive 
indications for dialysis (weak recommendation, 
low quality of evidence).
Rationale Although numerous nonrandomized stud-
ies have reported a nonsignificant trend toward improved 
survival using continuous methods [488–494], two 
meta-analyses [495, 496] reported the absence of signifi-
cant differences in hospital mortality between patients 
who receive CRRT and intermittent RRT. This absence 
of apparent benefit of one modality over the other per-
sists even when the analysis is restricted to RCTs [496]. 
To date, five prospective RCTs have been published 
[497–501]; four found no significant difference in mor-
tality [497, 498, 500, 501], whereas one found signifi-
cantly higher mortality in the continuous treatment 
group [499]; but imbalanced randomization had led to 
a higher baseline severity of illness in this group. When 
a multivariable model was used to adjust for severity of 
illness, no difference in mortality was apparent between 
the groups. Most studies comparing modes of RRT in the 
critically ill have included a small number of outcomes 
and had a high risk of bias (e.g., randomization failure, 
modifications of therapeutic protocol during the study 
period, combination of different types of CRRT, small 
number of heterogeneous groups of enrollees). The most 
recent and largest RCT [501] enrolled 360 patients and 
found no significant difference in survival between the 
continuous and intermittent groups. We judged the over-
all certainty of the evidence to be moderate and not in 
support of continuous therapies in sepsis independent of 
renal replacement needs.
For this revision of the guidelines, no additional RCTs 
evaluating the hemodynamic tolerance of continuous 
versus intermittent RRT were identified. Accordingly, the 
limited and inconsistent evidence persists. Two prospec-
tive trials [497, 502] have reported a better hemodynamic 
tolerance with continuous treatment, with no improve-
ment in regional perfusion [502] and no survival benefit 
[497]. Four other studies did not find any significant dif-
ference in MAP or drop in systolic pressure between the 
two methods [498, 500, 501, 503]. Two studies reported 
a significant improvement in goal achievement with 
continuous methods [497, 499] regarding fluid balance 
management.
Two additional RCTs reporting the effect of dose of 
CRRT on outcomes in patients with acute renal fail-
ure were identified in the current literature review [504, 
505]. Both studies enrolled patients with sepsis and acute 
kidney injury and did not demonstrate any difference 
in mortality associated with a higher dose of RRT. Two 
large, multicenter, randomized trials comparing the dose 
of renal replacement (Acute Renal Failure Trial Network 
in the United States and RENAL Study in Australia and 
New Zealand) also failed to show benefit of more aggres-
sive renal replacement dosing [506, 507]. A meta-anal-
ysis of the sepsis patients included in all relevant RCTs 
(n = 1505) did not demonstrate any significant relation-
ship between dose and mortality; the point estimate, 
however, favors CRRT doses >30 mL/kg/h. Because of 
risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, confidence in 
the estimate is very low; further research is indicated. A 
typical dose for CRRT would be 20–25 mL/kg/h of efflu-
ent generation.
One small trial from 2002 [504] evaluated early ver-
sus “late” or “delayed” initiation of RRT; it included only 
four patients with sepsis and did not show any benefit 
of early CRRT. Since then, two relevant RCTs [508, 509] 
were published in 2016. Results suggest the possibil-
ity of either benefit [509] or harm [508] for mortality, 
increased use of dialysis, and increased central line 
infections with early RRT. Enrollment criteria and tim-
ing of initiation of RRT differed in the two trials. Results 
were judged to be of low certainty based on indirectness 
(many nonseptic patients) and imprecision for mortal-
ity. The possibility of harm (e.g., central line infections) 
pushes the balance of risk and benefit against early ini-
tiation of RRT. Meanwhile, the undesirable effects and 
costs appear to outweigh the desirable consequences; 
therefore, we suggest not using RRT in patients with 
sepsis and acute kidney injury for increase in creati-
nine or oliguria without other definitive indications for 
dialysis.
 339
Q. BICARBONATE THERAPY
1. We suggest against the use of sodium bicarbo-
nate therapy to improve hemodynamics or to 
reduce vasopressor requirements in patients 
with hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia with 
pH ≥ 7.15 (weak recommendation, moderate 
quality of evidence).
Rationale Although sodium bicarbonate therapy may 
be useful in limiting tidal volume in ARDS in some situ-
ations of permissive hypercapnia, no evidence supports 
the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in the treatment 
of hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia associated 
with sepsis. Two blinded, crossover RCTs that compared 
equimolar saline and sodium bicarbonate in patients with 
lactic acidosis failed to reveal any difference in hemody-
namic variables or vasopressor requirements [510, 511]. 
The number of patients with <7.15 pH in these stud-
ies was small, and we downgraded the certainty of evi-
dence for serious imprecision; further, patients did not 
have exclusively septic shock, but also had other diseases, 
such as mesenteric ischemia. Bicarbonate administration 
has been associated with sodium and fluid overload, an 
increase in lactate and Paco2, and a decrease in serum 
ionized calcium, but the directness of these variables 
to outcome is uncertain. The effect of sodium bicarbo-
nate administration on hemodynamics and vasopressor 
requirements at lower pH, as well as the effect on clinical 
outcomes at any pH level, is unknown. No studies have 
examined the effect of bicarbonate administration on 
outcomes. This recommendation is unchanged from the 
2012 guidelines.
R. VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISMPROPHYLAXIS
1. We 
recommend 
pharmacologic 
prophylaxis 
[unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molec-
ular-weight heparin (LMWH)] against venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) in the absence of con-
traindications to the use of these agents (strong 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
2. We recommend LMWH rather than UFH for 
VTE prophylaxis in the absence of contraindica-
tions to the use of LMWH (strong recommenda-
tion, moderate quality of evidence).
3. We suggest combination pharmacologic VTE 
prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis, when-
ever possible (weak recommendation, low quality 
of evidence).
4. We suggest mechanical VTE prophylaxis when 
pharmacologic VTE is contraindicated (weak 
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale ICU patients are at risk for deep vein throm-
bosis (DVT) as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). The 
incidence of DVT acquired in the ICU may be as high 
as 10% [512]; the incidence of acquired PE may be 2–4% 
[513, 514]. Patients with sepsis and septic shock are likely 
at increased risk for this complication. Vasopressor use, 
which is frequent in these patients, has been found to be 
an independent risk factor for ICU-acquired DVT.
A meta-analysis of pharmacologic prophylaxis with UFH 
or LMWH in critically ill patients showed significant reduc-
tions in both DVT and PE, with no significant increase in 
bleeding complications. Mortality was lower in the patients 
receiving prophylaxis, although this did not reach statistical 
significance [514]. All studies included in the meta-analy-
sis were cited in the 2012 guideline, which recommended 
pharmacologic prophylaxis. No additional prospective ran-
domized controlled trials related to this topic have been 
identified since the meta-analysis and the previous guide-
line were published (ESM 12). Data in support of phar-
macologic prophylaxis are considered somewhat indirect. 
Except for a large prospective randomized controlled trial 
comparing VTE in septic patients treated with drotrecogin 
alfa who were randomized to receive placebo versus UFH 
versus LWMH [515], all studies have been in an undiffer-
entiated population of critically ill patients. Overall, we 
made a strong recommendation in favor of pharmacologic 
prophylaxis against VTE in critically ill patients based on 
the overall efficacy of this intervention, although the evi-
dence was downgraded to moderate because of indirect-
ness of the populations studied.
A number of studies have also compared use of LMWH 
to UFH for prevention of VTE prophylaxis in critically ill 
patients. Four trials were included in the meta-analysis of 
Alhazzani et al. [514]. We did not identify any new trials 
since then. In this meta-analysis, the overall rate of DVT 
was lower in patients receiving LWMH compared to 
UFH, and overall mortality was reduced by 7%; however, 
these differences did not reach statistical significance. 
In those trials evaluating PE, the rates were significantly 
lower in patients receiving LWMH. As with all studies 
of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, only one trial [515] 
was restricted to septic patients, and that trial utilized 
drotrecogin alfa in all patients. An additional meta-anal-
ysis found that LWMH was more effective than UFH in 
reducing the incidence of DVT and PE in critically ill 
patients [516]. However, the authors of this meta-analysis 
included studies of critically ill trauma patients.
All studies of LMWH have compared these agents 
against UFH administered twice daily. No high-quality 
studies in critically ill patients have directly compared 
LWMH against UFH administered thrice daily. An indi-
rect comparison meta-analysis published in 2011 failed 
to identify a significant difference in efficacy between 
 340
twice-daily and thrice-daily heparin in medical patients 
[517]. However, another review and meta-analysis (also 
using indirect comparison) suggested greater efficacy but 
higher rates of bleeding with thrice-daily UFH [518].
A Cochrane review demonstrated a substantial decrease 
in the incidence of HIT in postoperative patients receiving 
LMWH compared to UFH [519], although the studies were 
not specific to either septic or critically ill patients. Finally, 
a cost-effectiveness analysis based on one trial of LMWH 
versus UFH [520] suggested that use of LMWH resulted 
in an overall decrease in costs of care, despite the higher 
acquisition cost of the pharmaceutical agent [521]. Overall, 
the desirable consequences (i.e., reduction in PE, HIT, cost 
savings, and ease of administration) of using LMWH clearly 
outweigh the undesirable consequences; therefore, we made 
a strong recommendation in favor of LMWH instead of 
UFH, whenever feasible. However, the evidence for this was 
considered only of moderate quality because of indirect-
ness, both with respect to the populations studied and also 
because LMWH has only been systematically compared to 
UFH administered twice daily, and not thrice daily.
Precautions are generally suggested regarding use of 
LMWH in patients with renal dysfunction. In a prelimi-
nary trial, no accumulation of anti-Xa levels was dem-
onstrated with dalteparin in patients with a calculated 
creatinine clearance <30 mL/min [522]. Thus, these 
patients were included in the PROTECT study [520]. In 
the actual trial, 118 patients with renal failure were ana-
lyzed, 60 of whom were randomized to dalteparin and 58 
to UFH. There was no evidence of untoward reactions in 
patients receiving dalteparin compared to UFH. How-
ever, dalteparin was not more efficacious than UFH in this 
small number of patients. These investigators speculated 
that other types of LMWH might be safe to use in patients 
with renal failure, but acknowledged no other high-qual-
ity data to support this theory. Thus, use of LMWH in 
septic patients with renal dysfunction might be an option, 
but data in support of that remain quite limited.
Combined pharmacologic prophylaxis and mechani-
cal prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression 
(IPC) and/or graduated compression stockings (GCS) is 
a potential option in critically ill patients with sepsis and 
septic shock. No high-quality studies of this approach 
in septic patients, or even critically ill patients in gen-
eral, exist; however, further research is ongoing [523]. A 
Cochrane review [524] of 11 studies in surgical patients 
suggested that combined prophylaxis was more effective 
than either modality used alone. However, the quality of 
evidence was low due to indirectness of population and 
imprecision of estimates. Therefore, we can make only a 
weak recommendation for combined modality therapy for 
VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients with sepsis or sep-
tic shock. Recent American College of Chest Physicians 
guidelines made no recommendation regarding the use of 
combined modality in critically ill patients, but do suggest 
use of combined mechanical and pharmacologic prophy-
laxis in high-risk surgical patients [525, 526].
A significant number of septic patients may have rela-
tive contraindications to the use of pharmacologic proph-
ylaxis. These patients may be candidates for mechanical 
prophylaxis using IPC and/or GCS. However, relatively 
little data exist regarding this approach in critically ill 
patients. Two meta-analyses have been published com-
paring use of mechanical prophylaxis with no prophylaxis 
in combined patient groups, primarily those undergoing 
orthopedic surgery [527, 528]. The former meta-analysis 
focused on use of GCS and the latter on use of IPC. In 
these analyses, both modalities appeared more effective 
than no mechanical prophylaxis, but variable numbers 
of patients received pharmacologic prophylaxis in both 
arms, making this evidence indirect. A cohort study 
of 798 patients using propensity scores for risk adjust-
ment concluded that IPC was the only effective means 
for mechanical VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients; 
however, there was heavy use of pharmacologic prophy-
laxis in all groups [529]. Overall, based on these data, 
we made a weak recommendation for using mechanical 
prophylaxis in critically ill septic patients with contrain-
dications to use of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Very lim-
ited evidence indicates that IPC may be more effective 
than GCS alone in critically ill patients, making it the 
preferred modality for mechanical prophylaxis.
S. STRESS ULCER PROPHYLAXIS
1. We recommend that stress ulcer prophylaxis be 
given to patients with sepsis or septic shock who 
have risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed-
ing (strong recommendation, low quality of evi-
dence).
2. We suggest using either proton pump inhibi-
tors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor antagonists 
(H2RAs) when stress ulcer prophylaxis is indi-
cated (weak recommendation, low quality of evi-
dence).
3. We recommend against stress ulcer prophylaxis 
in patients without risk factors for GI bleeding 
(BPS).
Rationale Stress ulcers develop in the GI tract of criti-
cally ill patients and can be associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality [530]. The exact mechanism is 
not completely understood, but is believed to be related 
to disruption of protective mechanisms against gastric 
acid, gastric mucosal hypoperfusion, increased acid pro-
duction, and oxidative injury to the digestive track [531].

The strongest clinical predictors of GI bleeding risk in 
critically ill patients are mechanical ventilation for >48 h 
and coagulopathy [532]. A recent international cohort 
study showed that preexisting liver disease, need for RRT, 
and higher organ failure scores were independent predic-
tors of GI bleeding risk [533]. A multicenter prospective 
cohort study found the incidence of clinically important 
GI bleeding to be 2.6% (95% CI 1.6–3.6%) in critically 
ill patients [533]; however, other observational studies 
showed lower rates of GI bleeding [534–537].
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 RCTs 
examined the efficacy and safety of stress ulcer prophylaxis 
[538]. Moderate quality of evidence showed that prophylaxis 
with either H2RAs or PPIs reduced the risk of GI bleeding 
compared to no prophylaxis (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.28–0.68; 
low quality of evidence showed a nonsignificant increase in 
pneumonia risk (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.86–1.78) [538]. Recently, 
a large, retrospective cohort study examined the effect of 
stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients with sepsis and found no 
significant difference in the risk of C difficile infection com-
pared to no prophylaxis [539] (ESM 13). The choice of pro-
phylactic agent should depend on patients’ characteristics, 
patients’ values and preferences, and the local incidence of 
C. difficile infections and pneumonia.
Although published RCTs did not exclusively include 
septic patients, risk factors for GI bleeding are frequently 
present in patients with sepsis and septic shock [532]; 
therefore, using the results to inform our recommenda-
tions is acceptable. Based on the available evidence, the 
desirable consequences of stress ulcer prophylaxis out-
weigh the undesirable consequences; therefore, we made 
a strong recommendation in favor of using stress ulcer 
prophylaxis in patients with risk factors. Patients without 
risk factors are unlikely to develop clinically important 
GI bleeding during their ICU stay [532]; therefore, stress 
ulcer prophylaxis should only be used when risk factors 
are present, and patients should be periodically evaluated 
for the continued need for prophylaxis.
While there is variation in practice worldwide, several 
surveys showed that PPIs are the most frequently used 
agents in North America, Australia, and Europe, followed 
by H2RAs [540–544]. A recent meta-analysis including 
19 RCTs (n = 2177) showed that PPIs were more effec-
tive than H2RAs in preventing clinically important GI 
bleeding (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21–0.71; p = 0.002; moder-
ate quality), but led to a nonsignificant increase in pneu-
monia risk (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.88–1.56; p = 0.28; low 
quality) [544] prior meta-analyses reached a similar con-
clusion [545, 546]. None of the RCTs reported the risk of 
C. difficile infection; nonetheless, a large retrospective 
cohort study demonstrated a small increase in the risk of 
C. difficile infection with PPIs compared to H2RAs (2.2 
vs. 3.8%; p < 0.001; very low-quality evidence). Studies 
reporting patients’ values and preferences concerning the 
efficacy and safety of these agents are essentially lacking. 
Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analyses reached differ-
ent conclusions [547, 548].
Consequently, the benefit of preventing GI bleeding 
(moderate-quality evidence) must be weighed against the 
potential increase in infectious complications (very low- 
to low-quality evidence). The choice of prophylactic agent 
will largely depend on individual patients’ characteristics; 
patients’ values; and the local prevalence of GI bleed-
ing, pneumonia, and C. difficile infection. Because of the 
uncertainties, we did not recommend one agent over the 
other. Ongoing trials aim to investigate the benefit and 
harm of withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis (clinicaltri-
als.gov registration NCT02290327, NCT02467621). The 
results of these trials will inform future recommendations.
T. NUTRITION
1. We recommend against the administration of 
early parenteral nutrition alone or parenteral 
nutrition in combination with enteral feedings 
(but rather initiate early enteral nutrition) in 
critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock 
who can be fed enterally (strong recommenda-
tion, moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale Parenteral nutrition delivery can secure 
the intended amount of calories. This may represent an 
advantage over enteral nutrition, especially when patients 
may be underfed due to GI intolerance, which may be 
pertinent over the first days of care in the ICU. However, 
parenteral delivery is more invasive and has been asso-
ciated with complications, including an increased risk of 
infections. Further, purported physiologic benefits are 
associated with enteral feeding, which make this strategy 
the mainstay of care [549]. To address the question of the 
superiority of parenteral nutrition for patients with sepsis 
and septic shock, we evaluated the evidence for patients 
who could be fed enterally early versus those for whom 
early enteral feeding was not feasible.
Our first systematic review examined the impact of an 
early parenteral feeding strategy alone or in combination 
with enteral feeding versus enteral feeding alone on mor-
tality in patients who could be fed enterally. We identified 
a total of 10 trials with 2888 patients that were conducted 
in heterogeneous critically ill and surgical patients, 
trauma and traumatic brain injury, and those with severe 
acute pancreatitis [550–559]. No evidence showed that 
early parenteral nutrition reduced mortality (RR 0.97; 
95% CI 0.87–1.08; n = 2745) or infection risk (RR 1.52; 
95% CI 0.88–2.62; n = 2526), but ICU LOS was increased 
(MD, 0.90; 95% CI 0.38–1.42; n = 46). The quality of the 
 342
evidence was graded as moderate to very low. In the larg-
est randomized trial that addressed this study question 
(CALORIES, n = 2400), there were fewer episodes of 
hypoglycemia and vomiting in the early parenteral group, 
but no differences in death between the study groups 
[553, 560]. Due to the lack of mortality benefit, the added 
cost of parenteral nutrition in absence of clinical benefit 
[550, 551, 555, 560], and the potential physiologic ben-
efits of enteral feeding [549, 561, 562], we recommend 
early enteral nutrition as the preferred route of adminis-
tration in patients with sepsis or septic shock who can be 
fed enterally.
2. We recommend against the administration of par-
enteral nutrition alone or in combination with 
enteral feeds (but rather to initiate IV glucose and 
advance enteral feeds as tolerated) over the first 
7 days in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic 
shock for whom early enteral feeding is not feasi-
ble (strong recommendation, moderate quality of 
evidence).
Rationale In some patients with sepsis or septic shock, 
feeding enterally early may not be feasible because of con-
traindications related to surgery or feeding intolerance. 
These patients represent another subgroup of critically 
ill patients for whom the clinician may question whether 
to start parenteral nutrition early with or without some 
enteral feeding to meet nutritional goals, versus trophic/
hypocaloric enteral feeding alone, or nothing except the 
addition of IV glucose/dextrose for the provision of some 
calories. To address this question, we conducted a system-
atic review, which included a total of four trials and 6087 
patients [563–566]. Two of the included trials accounted 
for 98.5% of the patients included in the review and, of 
these trials, more than 65% of the patients were surgical 
critically ill patients [564, 567]. Seven (20%) of the patients 
from these two trials were considered septic and patients 
with malnourishment were either excluded or repre-
sented a very small fraction (n = 46, 3.3%) of the included 
patients. In three of the included trials, parenteral nutri-
tion was initiated if enteral feeding was not tolerated after 
the first 7 days of care [564, 566, 567]. Our review found 
that early parenteral nutrition with or without supple-
mentation of enteral nutrition was not associated with 
reduced mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.79–1.16; n = 6087; 
moderate-quality evidence), but was associated with 
increased risk of infection (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02–1.24; 3 
trials; n = 6054; moderate-quality evidence) (ESM 14). 
Length of ventilation outcomes were reported divergently 
in the two large trials, with one suggesting an increase 
[567] and the other a decrease [564] in ventilation time 
associated with early parenteral nutrition. One trial also 
reported less muscle wasting and fat loss in the early par-
enteral nutrition group according to a Subjective Global 
Assessment Score [564]. In summary, due to the lack of 
mortality benefit, the increased risk of infection, and the 
extra cost for parenteral nutrition in the absence of clini-
cal benefit [568], current evidence does not support the 
initiation of early parenteral nutrition over the first 7 days 
of care for patients with contraindications or intolerance 
to enteral nutrition. Specific patient groups may benefit 
more or incur more harm with early initiation of par-
enteral nutrition in this context. We encourage future 
research according to individual patient level meta-anal-
yses to characterize these subgroups and plan for future 
randomized trials. It is important to note that patients 
who were malnourished were either excluded or rarely 
represented in the included trials from our systematic 
review. Since so few malnourished patients were enrolled, 
evidence to guide practice is lacking. Malnourished 
patients may represent a subgroup of critically ill patients 
for whom the clinician may consider initiating parenteral 
nutrition early when enteral feeding is not feasible.
3. We suggest the early initiation of enteral feeding 
rather than a complete fast or only IV glucose in 
critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock 
who can be fed enterally (weak recommendation, 
low quality of evidence).
4. We suggest either early trophic/hypocaloric or 
early full enteral feeding in critically ill patients 
with sepsis or septic shock; if trophic/hypocaloric 
feeding is the initial strategy, then feeds should 
be advanced according to patient tolerance (weak 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale The early administration of enteral nutri-
tion in patients with sepsis and septic shock has potential 
physiologic advantages related to the maintenance of gut 
integrity and prevention of intestinal permeability, damp-
ening of the inflammatory response, and modulation of 
metabolic responses that may reduce insulin resistance 
[561, 562]. To examine evidence for this nutrition strat-
egy, we asked if early full feeding (started within the 
first 48 h and feeding goals to be met within 72 h of ICU 
admission or injury) as compared to a delayed strategy 
(feeds delayed for at least 48 h) improved the outcome 
of our critically ill patients. In our systematic review, we 
identified a total of 11 trials in heterogeneous critically ill 
patient populations (n = 412 patients) [569–579]. Only 
one trial was specifically conducted in patients with sep-
sis (n = 43 patients) [577]. The risk of death was not sig-
nificantly different between the groups (RR 0.75; 95% CI 
0.43–1.31; n = 188 patients), and infections were not sig-
nificantly reduced (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.34–12.07; n = 122 
 343
patients). Other recent systematic reviews in the criti-
cally ill focused specifically on trauma (three trials, 126 
patients) or more heterogeneous critically ill populations 
(6 trials, n = 234 patients) and found that early enteral 
feeding reduced death and pneumonia [580, 581]. How-
ever, in contrast to our systematic review, these latter 
reviews did not include studies in which enteral feeding 
in the intervention arm was both early and full and where 
the control arm feeding strategy was delayed for at least 
the first 48 h. We also examined whether the provision 
of an early trophic/hypocaloric feeding strategy (defined 
by enteral feeding started within the first 48 h and up to 
70% of target caloric goals for at least 48 h) was superior 
to a delayed enteral feeding strategy. In the two trials that 
fit these criteria, there were no statistical differences in 
death (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.35–1.29; n = 229; low-qual-
ity evidence) or infection (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.61–1.37; 
n = 229; very low-quality evidence) between the groups 
[582, 583]. Since the present evidence does not suggest 
harm with early versus delayed institution of enteral 
feeding, and there is possible benefit from physiologic 
evidence suggesting reduced gut permeability, inflam-
mation, and infection risk, the committee issued a weak 
recommendation to start feeding early in patients with 
sepsis and septic shock.
Some evidence suggests that intentional early under-
feeding as compared to early full feeding of critically ill 
patients may lead to immune hyporesponsiveness and 
an increase in infectious complications [549]. Further, 
because critical illness is associated with loss of skeletal 
mass, it is possible that not administering adequate pro-
tein may lead to challenges weaning from the ventilator 
and more general weakness. However, a biological ration-
ale for a trophic/hypocaloric or hypocaloric feeding strat-
egy exists, at least as the initial approach to feeding the 
critically ill as compared to a fully fed strategy. Limiting 
caloric intake stimulates autophagy, which is considered 
a defense mechanism against intracellular organisms and 
therefore raises the possibility that this approach could 
reduce infection risk [584, 585].
We defined feeds as trophic/hypocaloric if goal feeds 
were 70% or less of standard caloric targets for at least 
a 48-hour period before they were titrated toward goal. 
Our systematic review identified seven randomized tri-
als and 2665 patients studied [584, 586–591]. Patient 
populations 
included 
heterogeneous 
critically 
ill 
patients and those with acute lung injury and/or ARDS. 
Patients who were malnourished were excluded from 
four of the trials [588–591] and the average body mass 
index in the remaining three trials ranged from 28 to 30 
[584, 586, 587]. Targets for trophic/hypocaloric feed-
ing groups ranged from 10 to 20 kcal/h to up to 70% of 
target goal. Study intervention periods ranged from 6 
to 14 days (or until ICU discharge). In three of the tri-
als, protein (0.8–1.5 g/kg/days) was administered to 
the trophic/hypocaloric group to meet protein require-
ments [584, 586, 587]. Overall, there were no differences 
in mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82–1.10; n = 2665; high-
quality evidence), infections (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83–
1.12; n = 2667; moderate-quality evidence), or ICU 
LOS (MD, –0.27 days; 95% CI –1.40 to 0.86, n = 2567; 
moderate-quality evidence between the study groups) 
(ESM 15). One trial that instituted hypocaloric feeding 
(goal 40–60% target feeds for up to 14 days) reported 
a subgroup of 292 patients with sepsis; there were also 
no detectable differences in death at 90 days between 
the study groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.71–1.27; p = 0.82 
for interaction) [584]. A recently published systematic 
review of normocaloric versus hypocaloric feeding also 
found no differences in hospital mortality, infections, 
ICU LOS, or ventilator-free days between the study 
groups [585]. Some evidence also suggests a lack of 
adverse consequences even with longer-term outcomes. 
A trophic/hypocaloric feeding trial of 525 patients, 
which instituted the most significant restrictions in 
enteral feeding (20% of caloric goal) for up to 6 days, 
found no differences in muscle strength, muscle mass, 
and 6-min walk test at 6 months or 1 year, although 
patients in the trophic/hypocaloric feeding group were 
more likely to be admitted to a rehabilitation facility 
during the first 12 months of follow-up [592]. The cur-
rent evidence base would suggest that a trophic/hypoca-
loric or early full enteral feeding strategy is appropriate. 
However, for patients with sepsis or septic shock who 
are not tolerating enteral feeds, trophic/hypocaloric 
feeding may be preferred, with feeds titrated over time 
according to patient tolerance. There is insufficient 
evidence to confirm that a trophic/hypocaloric feed-
ing strategy is effective and safe in patients who are 
malnourished (body mass index <18.5) because these 
patients were either excluded or rarely represented in 
the clinical trials from our systematic review. Until fur-
ther clinical evidence is generated for this subpopula-
tion, the clinician may consider titrating enteral feeds 
more aggressively in accordance with patient tolerance 
while monitoring for re-feeding syndrome. Current evi-
dence did not specifically address patients with high 
vasopressor requirements, and the decision about with-
holding the feeds should be individualized.
5. We recommend against the use of omega-3 fatty 
acids as an immune supplement in critically ill 
patients with sepsis or septic shock (strong rec-
ommendation, low quality of evidence).
 344
Rationale Use of omega-3 fatty acids in the con-
text of clinical trials in the critically ill has been a sub-
ject of interest during the past several years because of 
the immunomodulatory potential [593]. However, sys-
tematic reviews of parenteral or enteral omega-3 sup-
plementation in critically ill and ARDS patients have not 
confirmed their therapeutic benefit [594, 595]. Further, a 
recent randomized trial of 272 patients with acute lung 
injury found excess harm related to mortality as well as 
fewer ventilator- and ICU-free days in the omega-3 arm 
as compared to the control arm [596]. A limitation of 
this trial as well as several other omega-3 trials is that the 
intervention arm also contained vitamins and trace min-
eral supplementation, making omega-3 fatty acids alone 
difficult to isolate as the cause for harm or benefit. For 
these reasons, we conducted a systematic review of clini-
cal trials in the critically ill that administered omega-3 
alone in the intervention arm. In a total of 16 trials 
(n = 1216 patients), there were no significant reduc-
tions in death (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.71–1.03; low quality 
evidence); however, ICU LOS was significantly reduced 
in the omega-3 group (MD, –3.84 days; 95% CI –5.57 to 
–2.12, very low-quality evidence). The overall quality of 
the evidence was graded as low. Due to the uncertainty 
of benefit, the potential for harm, and the excess cost 
and varied availability of omega-3 fatty acids, we make a 
strong recommendation against the use of omega-3 fatty 
acids for patients with sepsis and septic shock outside the 
conduct of RCTs.
6. We suggest against routinely monitoring gastric 
residual volumes (GRVs) in critically ill patients 
with sepsis or septic shock (weak recommenda-
tion, low quality of evidence). However, we sug-
gest measurement of gastric residuals in patients 
with feeding intolerance or who are considered to 
be at high risk of aspiration (weak recommenda-
tion, very low quality of evidence).
Remarks This recommendation refers to nonsurgical 
critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock.
Rationale Critically ill patients are at significant risk 
for GI dysmotility, which may then predispose them to 
regurgitation or vomiting, aspiration, and the develop-
ment of aspiration pneumonia. The rationale for meas-
urement of GRVs is to reduce the risk for aspiration 
pneumonia by either ceasing or modifying the enteral 
feeding strategy based on the detection of excess gas-
tric residuals. The inherent controversy is that observa-
tional and interventional studies have not consistently 
confirmed a relationship between the measurement of 
GRVs (with thresholds ranging from 200 mL to no moni-
toring of GRVs) and outcomes of vomiting, aspiration, 
or pneumonia [597–603]. In our systematic review, we 
identified one multicenter non-inferiority trial of 452 
critically ill patients who were randomized to not moni-
toring GRVs versus monitoring GRVs at 6-h intervals 
[602]. Intolerance to feeds was defined as vomiting in 
the intervention group versus a GRV of >250 mL, vomit-
ing, or both in the control group. Although vomiting was 
more frequent (39.6 versus 27%; median difference, 12.6; 
95% CI 5.4–19.9) in the group in which GRVs were not 
monitored, a strategy of not monitoring GRVs was found 
to be non-inferior compared to monitoring at 6-h inter-
vals with regard to the primary outcome of VAP (16.7 
versus 15.8% respectively; difference, 0.9%; 95% CI −4.8 
to 6.7%). No detectable differences in death were shown 
between the study groups at 28 and 90 days. Patients who 
had surgery up to one month prior to study eligibility 
were not included in this study, so these results should 
not be applied to surgical critically ill patients. How-
ever, the results of this trial question the need to meas-
ure GRVs as a method to reduce aspiration pneumonia 
in all critically ill patients. Due to the absence of harm 
and the potential reduction in nursing resources needed 
to monitor patients, we suggest against routine monitor-
ing of GRVs in all patients with sepsis unless the patient 
has demonstrated feeding intolerance (e.g., vomiting, 
reflux of feeds into the oral cavity) or for patients who 
are considered to be at high risk for aspiration (e.g., sur-
gery, hemodynamic instability). We recommend the gen-
eration of further evidence through the conduct of future 
randomized controlled trials targeted to higher-risk 
patient groups such as the surgical population or those 
in shock to determine the threshold and frequency with 
which GRVs should be monitored.
7. We suggest the use of prokinetic agents in criti-
cally ill patients with sepsis or septic shock and 
feeding intolerance (weak recommendation, low 
quality of evidence).
Rationale Feeding intolerance is defined as vomiting, 
aspiration of gastric contents, or high GRVs. For multi-
ple reasons, feeding intolerance commonly develops in 
critically ill patients. Patients with preexisting gastro-
paresis or diabetes or those who are receiving sedatives 
and vasopressors are at risk. Prokinetic agents, includ-
ing metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin, 
are frequently used in the ICU. Each of these agents has 
different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic prop-
erties; however, these agents may be associated with pro-
longation of QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias. A 
large case–control study in non-ICU patients showed a 
threefold increase in risk of sudden cardiac death with 
domperidone use at doses >30 mg/day [604]. Another 
 345
retrospective cohort study showed that outpatient use of 
erythromycin is associated with a twofold increase in the 
risk of sudden cardiac death, especially if concomitantly 
used with other CYP3A inhibitors [605]. The impact on 
ventricular arrhythmias in ICU patients is less clear.
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 
13 RCTs enrolling 1341 critically ill patients showed that 
prokinetic agent use was associated with lower risk of 
feeding intolerance (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55–0.97; mod-
erate-quality evidence). This was equivalent to an abso-
lute risk reduction of 17%. The use of prokinetic agents 
did not significantly increase mortality (RR 0.97; 95% 
CI 0.81–1.1; low-quality evidence); however, the inci-
dence of fatal or nonfatal cardiac arrhythmias was not 
consistently reported across studies. There was no sig-
nificant effect on the risk of pneumonia or vomiting. The 
majority of trials examined the effect of metoclopramide 
or erythromycin; subgroup analysis by drug class was 
underpowered to detect important subgroup differences 
[606]. We considered the desirable consequences (lower 
risk of feeding intolerance) and the low quality of evi-
dence showing no difference in mortality or pneumonia, 
and issued a weak recommendation for using proki-
netic agents (metoclopramide or erythromycin) to treat 
feeding intolerance in patients with sepsis. Future large 
comparative trials are needed to determine the relative 
efficacy and safety of different agents.
Monitoring the QT interval with serial electrocardio-
grams is required when these agents are used in the ICU, 
especially if concomitantly used with other agents that 
could prolong the QT interval [607]. The need for proki-
netic agents should be assessed daily, and they should be 
stopped when clinically not indicated.
8. We suggest placement of post-pyloric feeding 
tubes in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic 
shock with feeding intolerance or who are consid-
ered to be at high risk of aspiration (weak recom-
mendation, low quality of evidence).
Rationale Feeding intolerance is defined as vomiting, 
abdominal distention, or high GRVs that result in inter-
ruption of enteral nutrition. Critically ill patients are at 
risk of gastroparesis and feeding intolerance; evidence of 
delayed gastric emptying can be found in approximately 
50% of critically ill patients [608]. The proportion of 
patients who will progress to develop clinical symptoms 
is less clear. Feeding intolerance can result in interrup-
tion of nutritional support, vomiting, aspiration of gas-
tric contents, or pneumonia [609]. The pathophysiology 
is not completely understood and is likely to be multi-
factorial. Gastroparesis can be caused by pharmacologic 
agents that are frequently used in the ICU (e.g., sedatives, 
opioids, or NMBAs), gastric hypoperfusion in the context 
of shock, hyperglycemia, or vasopressor use [610–612].
Post-pyloric tubes have the theoretical advantage of 
improving feeding intolerance in patients with gastropa-
resis, consequently improving the delivery of nutrition 
into the gut. Post-pyloric feeding tubes, although safe, 
are not always available, and require technical skill for 
successful insertion. Gastric air insufflation and proki-
netic agents are both effective strategies to facilitate the 
insertion of post-pyloric tubes in critically ill patients 
[613]. Endoscopy and an external magnet device can also 
be used to guide post-pyloric tube insertion, but are not 
always available, are expensive, and require a higher level 
of expertise.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-anal-
ysis of randomized trials to examine the effect of 
post-pyloric (compared to gastric) feeding on patient-
important outcomes. We identified 21 eligible RCTs 
enrolling 1579 patients. Feeding via post-pyloric tube 
reduced the risk of pneumonia compared to gastric 
tube feeding (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.59–0.94; low-quality 
evidence). This translates into a 2.5% (95% CI 0.6–4.1%) 
absolute reduction in pneumonia risk. However, there 
was no significant effect on the risk of death, aspiration, 
or vomiting (ESM 16). This is consistent with the results 
of older meta-analyses [614, 615]. Although the use of 
post-pyloric tubes reduced risk of pneumonia, the qual-
ity of evidence was low, the magnitude of benefit was 
small, and there was uncertainty about the effect on 
other patient-important outcomes. Cost-effectiveness 
studies that describe the economic consequences of 
using post-pyloric feeding tubes are lacking. There-
fore, we decided that the balance between desirable 
and undesirable consequences was unclear in low-risk 
patients; however, the use of post-pyloric feeding tubes 
may be justified in patients at high risk of aspiration 
(i.e., patients with history of recurrent aspiration, severe 
gastroparesis, feeding intolerance, or refractory medical 
treatment).
9. We recommend against the use of IV selenium to 
treat sepsis and septic shock (strong recommen-
dation, moderate quality of evidence).
Rationale Selenium was administered in the hope 
that it could correct the known reduction of selenium 
concentration in sepsis patients and provide a pharma-
cologic effect through an antioxidant defense. Although 
some RCTs are available, the evidence for the use of IV 
selenium is not convincing. Two recent meta-analyses 
suggest, with weak findings, a potential benefit of sele-
nium supplementation in sepsis [616, 617]. However, a 
recent large RCT also examined the effect on mortality 
 346
rates [618]. Overall pooled odds ratio (0.94; CI 0.77–1.15) 
suggests no significant impact on mortality with sepsis. 
Also, no differences in secondary outcomes of develop-
ment of nosocomial pneumonia or ICU LOS were found. 
When updating our meta-analysis to include the results 
of this recent study, there was no difference in mortality 
between both groups (ESM 17).
10. We suggest against the use of arginine to treat 
sepsis and septic shock (weak recommendation, 
low quality of evidence).
Rationale Arginine availability is reduced in sepsis, 
which can lead to reduced nitric oxide synthesis, loss of 
microcirculatory regulation, and enhanced production 
of superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, arginine sup-
plementation could lead to unwanted vasodilation and 
hypotension [619, 620]. Human trials of l-arginine sup-
plementation have generally been small and reported 
variable effects on mortality [621–624]. The only study 
in septic patients showed improved survival, but had 
limitations in study design [623]. Other studies suggested 
no benefit or possible harm in the subgroup of septic 
patients [621, 624, 625]. Some authors found improve-
ment in secondary outcomes in septic patients, such as 
reduced infectious complications) and hospital LOS, but 
the relevance of these findings in the face of potential 
harm is unclear.
11. We recommend against the use of glutamine to 
treat sepsis and septic shock (strong recommen-
dation, moderate quality of evidence)
Rationale Glutamine levels are also reduced during 
critical illness. Exogenous supplementation can improve 
gut mucosal atrophy and permeability, possibly lead-
ing to reduced bacterial translocation. Other potential 
benefits are enhanced immune cell function, decreased 
proinflammatory cytokine production, and higher lev-
els of glutathione and antioxidative capacity [619, 620]. 
However, the clinical significance of these findings is not 
clearly established.
Although a previous meta-analysis showed mortal-
ity reduction [626], several other meta-analyses did not 
[627–630]. Four recent well-designed studies also failed 
to show a mortality benefit in the primary analyses, 
although none focused specifically on septic patients 
[631–634]. Two small studies on septic patients showed 
no benefit in mortality rates [635, 636], but showed a sig-
nificant reduction in infectious complications [636] and a 
faster recovery of organ dysfunction.
12. We make no recommendation about the use of 
carnitine for sepsis and septic shock.
Rationale Massive disruption in energy metabolism 
contributes to sepsis severity and end organ failure. 
The magnitude of the energy shift, and, possibly more 
importantly, the host’s metabolic adaptiveness to the 
shift in energy demand, likely influence patient survival. 
Carnitine, endogenously manufactured from lysine and 
methionine, is required for the transport of long-chain 
fatty acids into the mitochondria and the generation of 
energy. As such, carnitine utilization is essential for ena-
bling the switch from glucose to long-chain fatty acid 
metabolism during the sepsis energy crisis. This is the 
basis for the rationale of employing l-carnitine as a ther-
apeutic in sepsis. One small randomized trial in patients 
with sepsis reported a 28-day mortality decrease in septic 
shock patients treated with IV l-carnitine therapy within 
24 h of shock onset; however, the trial was underpowered 
to detect such a difference [637]. Larger, ongoing trials 
should provide more evidence of the usefulness of carni-
tine supplementation.
U. SETTING GOALS OF CARE
1. We recommend that goals of care and prognosis 
be discussed with patients and families (BPS).
2. We recommend that goals of care be incorpo-
rated into treatment and end-of-life care plan-
ning, utilizing palliative care principles where 
appropriate (strong recommendation, moderate 
quality of evidence).
3. We suggest that goals of care be addressed as 
early as feasible, but no later than within 72 h of 
ICU admission (weak recommendation, low qual-
ity of evidence).
Rationale Patients with sepsis and multiple organ 
system failure have a high mortality rate; some will not 
survive or will have a poor quality of life. Although the 
outcome of intensive care treatment in critically ill 
patients may be difficult to prognosticate accurately, 
establishing realistic ICU treatment goals is paramount 
[638], especially because inaccurate expectations about 
prognosis are common among surrogates [639]. Non-
beneficial ICU advanced life-prolonging treatment is 
not consistent with setting goals of care [640, 641]. Mod-
els for structuring initiatives to enhance care in the ICU 
highlight the importance of incorporating goals of care, 
along with prognosis, into treatment plans [642]. The use 
of proactive family care conferences to identify advance 
 347
directives and treatment goals within 72 h of ICU admis-
sion has been demonstrated to promote communica-
tion and understanding between the patient’s family and 
the treating team; improve family satisfaction; decrease 
stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives; 
facilitate end-of-life decision-making; and shorten ICU 
LOS for patients who die in the ICU [643, 644]. Promot-
ing shared-decision-making with patients and families 
is beneficial in ensuring appropriate care in the ICU and 
that futile care is avoided [641, 645, 646].
Palliative care is increasingly accepted as an essen-
tial component of comprehensive care for critically ill 
patients regardless of diagnosis or prognosis [642, 647]. 
Use of palliative care in the ICU enhances the ability to 
recognize pain and distress; establish the patient’s wishes, 
beliefs, and values, and their impact on decision-making; 
develop flexible communication strategies; conduct fam-
ily meetings and establish goals of care; provide family 
support during the dying process; help resolve team con-
flicts; and establish reasonable goals for life support and 
resuscitation [648].
A recent systematic review of the effect of palliative 
care interventions and advanced care planning on ICU 
utilization identified that, despite wide variation in study 
type and quality among nine randomized control trials 
and 13 nonrandomized controlled trials, patients who 
received advance care planning or palliative care inter-
ventions consistently showed a pattern toward decreased 
ICU admissions and reduced ICU LOS [649].
However, significant inter-hospital variation in ratings 
and delivery of palliative care is consistent with prior 
studies showing variation in intensity of care at the end 
of life [650]. Despite differences in geographic location, 
legal system, religion, and culture, there is worldwide 
professional consensus for key end-of-life practices in the 
ICU [651].
Promoting patient- and family-centered care in the 
ICU has emerged as a priority and includes implemen-
tation of early and repeated care conferencing to reduce 
family stress and improve consistency in communication; 
open flexible visitation; family presence during clini-
cal rounds, resuscitation, and invasive procedures; and 
attention to cultural and spiritual support [652–655].

Appendix 1
Recommendations and best practice statements
A. INITIAL RESUSCITATION
1.
Sepsis and sep�c shock are medical emergencies, and we recommend that treatment and resuscita�on begin 
immediately (BPS).
2.
We recommend that, in the resuscita�on from sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid 
be given within the first 3 hours (strong recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
3.
We recommend that, following ini�al fluid resuscita�on, addi�onal fluids be guided by frequent reassessment of 
hemodynamic status (BPS).
Remarks: Reassessment should include a thorough clinical examina�on and evalua�on of available physiologic 
variables (heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen satura�on, respiratory rate, temperature, urine output, and 
others, as available) as well as other noninvasive or invasive monitoring, as available.
4.
We recommend further hemodynamic assessment (such as assessing cardiac function) to determine the type of shock 
if the clinical examina�on does not lead to a clear diagnosis (BPS).
5.
We suggest that dynamic over sta�c variables be used to predict fluid responsiveness, where available (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
6.
We recommend an ini�al target mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg in pa�ents with sep�c shock requiring 
vasopressors (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
7.
We suggest guiding resuscita�on to normalize lactate in pa�ents with elevated lactate levels as a marker of �ssue 
hypoperfusion (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
B. SCREENING FOR SEPSIS AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
1.
We recommend that hospitals and hospital systems have a performance improvement program for sepsis, including 
sepsis screening for acutely ill, high risk pa�ents (BPS).
C. DIAGNOSIS
1.
We recommend that appropriate rou�ne microbiologic cultures (including blood) be obtained before star�ng 
an�microbial therapy in pa�ents with suspected sepsis or sep�c shock if doing so results in no substan�al delay in the 
start of an�microbials (BPS).
Remarks: Appropriate rou�ne microbiologic cultures always include at least two sets of blood cultures (aerobic and 
anaerobic).
D. ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY
1.
We recommend that administra�on of IV an�microbials should be ini�ated as soon as possible a�er recogni�on and 
within one hour for both sepsis and sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
2.
We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more an�microbials for pa�ents presen�ng with sepsis 
or sep�c shock to cover all likely pathogens (including bacterial and poten�ally fungal or viral coverage) (strong 
recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
3.
We recommend that empiric an�microbial therapy be narrowed once pathogen iden�fica�on and sensi�vi�es are 
established and/or adequate clinical improvement is noted (BPS).
4.
We recommend against sustained systemic an�microbial prophylaxis in pa�ents with severe inflammatory states of 
noninfec�ous origin (e.g., severe pancrea��s, burn injury) (BPS).
5.
We recommend that dosing strategies of an�microbials be op�mized based on accepted 
pharmacokine�c/pharmacodynamic principles and specific drug proper�es in pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock 
 350
(BPS).
6.
We suggest empiric combina�on therapy (using at least two an�bio�cs of different an�microbial classes) aimed at the 
most likely bacterial pathogen(s) for the ini�al management of sep�c shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of 
evidence).
Remarks: Readers should review Table 6 for defini�ons of empiric, targeted/defini�ve, broad-spectrum, combina�on, 
and mul�drug therapy before reading this sec�on.
7.
We suggest that combina�on therapy not be rou�nely used for ongoing treatment of most other serious infec�ons, 
including bacteremia and sepsis without shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
Remarks: This does not preclude the use of mul�drug therapy to broaden an�microbial ac�vity.
8.
We recommend against combina�on therapy for the rou�ne treatment of neutropenic sepsis/bacteremia (strong 
recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
Remarks: This does not preclude the use of mul�drug therapy to broaden an�microbial ac�vity.
9.
If combina�on therapy is used for sep�c shock, we recommend de-escala�on with discon�nua�on of combina�on 
therapy within the first few days in response to clinical improvement and/or evidence of infec�on resolu�on. This 
applies to both targeted (for culture-positive infec�ons) and empiric (for culture-nega�ve infec�ons) combina�on 
therapy (BPS).
10. We suggest that an an�microbial treatment dura�on of 7 to 10 days is adequate for most serious infec�ons 
associated with sepsis and sep�c shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
11. We suggest that longer courses are appropriate in pa�ents who have a slow clinical response, undrainable foci of 
infec�on, bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, some fungal and viral infec�ons, or immunologic deficiencies, 
including neutropenia (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
12. We suggest that shorter courses are appropriate in some pa�ents, par�cularly those with rapid clinical resolu�on 
following effec�ve source control of intra-abdominal or urinary sepsis and those with anatomically uncomplicated 
pyelonephri�s (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
13. We recommend daily assessment for de-escala�on of an�microbial therapy in pa�ents with sepsis and sep�c shock
(BPS).
14. We suggest that measurement of procalcitonin levels can be used to support shortening the dura�on of an�microbial 
therapy in sepsis pa�ents (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
15. We suggest that procalcitonin levels can be used to support the discon�nua�on of empiric an�bio�cs in pa�ents who 
ini�ally appeared to have sepsis, but subsequently have limited clinical evidence of infec�on (weak recommenda�on, 
low quality of evidence).
E. SOURCE CONTROL
1.
We recommend that a specific anatomic diagnosis of infec�on requiring emergent source control should be iden�fied 
or excluded as rapidly as possible in pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock, and that any required source control 
interven�on should be implemented as soon as medically and logis�cally prac�cal a�er the diagnosis is made (BPS).
2.
We recommend prompt removal of intravascular access devices that are a possible source of sepsis or sep�c shock 
a�er other vascular access has been established (BPS).
F. FLUID THERAPY
1.
We recommend that a fluid challenge technique be applied where fluid administra�on is con�nued as long as 
hemodynamic factors con�nue to improve (BPS).
2.
We recommend crystalloids as the fluid of choice for ini�al resuscita�on and subsequent intravascular volume 
replacement in pa�ents with sepsis and sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
 351
3.
We suggest using either balanced crystalloids or saline for fluid resuscita�on of pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock 
(weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
4.
We suggest using albumin in addi�on to crystalloids for ini�al resuscita�on and subsequent intravascular volume 
replacement in pa�ents with sepsis and sep�c shock, when pa�ents require substan�al amounts of crystalloids (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
5.
We recommend against using hydroxyethyl starches for intravascular volume replacement in pa�ents with sepsis or
sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).
6.
We suggest using crystalloids over gela�ns when resuscita�ng pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
G. VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS
1.
We recommend norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of 
evidence).
2.
We suggest adding either vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) (weak recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence) or 
epinephrine (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence) to norepinephrine with the intent of raising mean 
arterial pressure to target, or adding vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) (weak recommenda�on, moderate quality of 
evidence) to decrease norepinephrine dosage. 
3.
We suggest using dopamine as an alterna�ve vasopressor agent to norepinephrine only in highly selected pa�ents 
(e.g., pa�ents with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or rela�ve bradycardia) (weak recommenda�on, low 
quality of evidence).
4.
We recommend against using low-dose dopamine for renal protec�on (strong recommenda�on, high quality of 
evidence).
5.
We suggest using dobutamine in pa�ents who show evidence of persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid 
loading and the use of vasopressor agents (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
Remarks: If ini�ated, dosing should be �trated to an end point reflec�ng perfusion, and the agent reduced or 
discon�nued in the face of worsening hypotension or arrhythmias.
6.
We suggest that all pa�ents requiring vasopressors have an arterial catheter placed as soon as prac�cal if resources 
are available (weak recommenda�on, very low quality of evidence).
H. CORTICOSTEROIDS
1.
We suggest against using IV hydrocor�sone to treat sep�c shock pa�ents if adequate fluid resuscita�on and 
vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, we suggest IV hydrocor�sone 
at a dose of 200 mg per day (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
I. BLOOD PRODUCTS
1.
We recommend that RBC transfusion occur only when hemoglobin concentra�on decreases to < 7.0 g/dL in adults in 
the absence of extenua�ng circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage 
(strong recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).
2.
We recommend against the use of erythropoie�n for treatment of anemia associated with sepsis (strong 
recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).

 352
bleeding and when counts are < 20,000/mm3 (20 × 109/L) if the pa�ent has a significant risk of bleeding. Higher 
platelet counts (≥ 50,000/mm3 [50 x 109/L]) are advised for ac�ve bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures (weak 
recommenda�on, very low quality of evidence).

pa�ents with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (strong recommenda�on, high quality of 
evidence).
2.
We recommend using an upper limit goal for plateau pressures of 30 cm H2O over higher plateau pressures in adult 
pa�ents with sepsis-induced severe ARDS (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
3.
We suggest using higher posi�ve end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) over lower PEEP in adult pa�ents with sepsis-induced 
moderate to severe ARDS (weak recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
4.
We suggest using recruitment maneuvers in adult pa�ents with sepsis-induced, severe ARDS (weak recommenda�on, 
moderate quality of evidence).

evidence of �ssue hypoperfusion (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
10. We recommend against the use of ß-2 agonists for the treatment of pa�ents with sepsis-induced ARDS without 
bronchospasm (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
11. We recommend against the rou�ne use of the pulmonary artery catheter for pa�ents with sepsis-induced ARDS 
(strong recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).
 353
12. We suggest using lower �dal volumes over higher �dal volumes in adult pa�ents with sepsis-induced respiratory 
failure without ARDS (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
13. We recommend that mechanically ven�lated sepsis pa�ents be maintained with the head of the bed elevated 
between 30 and 45 degrees to limit aspira�on risk and to prevent the development of ven�lator-associated 
pneumonia (strong recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
14. We recommend using spontaneous breathing trials in mechanically ven�lated pa�ents with sepsis who are ready for 
weaning (strong recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).

We recommend that con�nuous or intermi�ent seda�on be minimized in mechanically ven�lated sepsis pa�ents, 
targe�ng specific �tra�on end points (BPS).
O. GLUCOSE CONTROL
1.
We recommend a protocolized approach to blood glucose management in ICU pa�ents with sepsis, commencing 
insulin dosing when two consecu�ve blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL. This approach should target an upper 
blood glucose level ≤ 180 mg/dL rather than an upper target blood glucose level ≤ 110 mg/dL (strong 
recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).
2.
We recommend that blood glucose values be monitored every 1 to 2 hours un�l glucose values and insulin infusion 
rates are stable, then every 4 hours therea�er in pa�ents receiving insulin infusions (BPS).
3.
We recommend that glucose levels obtained with point-of-care tes�ng of capillary blood be interpreted with cau�on
because such measurements may not accurately es�mate arterial blood or plasma glucose values (BPS).
4.
We suggest the use of arterial blood rather than capillary blood for point-of-care tes�ng using glucose meters if 
pa�ents have arterial catheters (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
P. RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
1.
We suggest that either con�nuous or intermi�ent renal replacement therapy (RRT) be used in pa�ents with sepsis 
and acute kidney injury (weak recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
2.
We suggest using con�nuous therapies to facilitate management of fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable sep�c 
pa�ents (weak recommenda�on, very low quality of evidence).
3.

without other defini�ve indica�ons for dialysis (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
Q. BICARBONATE THERAPY
1.

1.
We recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis (unfrac�onated heparin [UFH] or low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) 
 354
against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the absence of contraindica�ons to the use of these agents (strong 
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
2.

indicated (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
3.
We recommend against stress ulcer prophylaxis in pa�ents without risk factors for GI bleeding (BPS).
T. NUTRITION
1.
We recommend against the administra�on of early parenteral nutri�on alone or parenteral nutri�on in combina�on 
with enteral feedings (but rather ini�ate early enteral nutri�on) in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock who 
can be fed enterally (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
2.
We recommend against the administra�on of parenteral nutri�on alone or in combina�on with enteral feeds (but 
rather to ini�ate IV glucose and advance enteral feeds as tolerated) over the first 7 days in cri�cally ill pa�ents with 
sepsis or sep�c shock for whom early enteral feeding is not feasible (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of 
evidence).
3.
We suggest the early ini�a�on of enteral feeding rather than a complete fast or only IV glucose in cri�cally ill pa�ents 
with sepsis or sep�c shock who can be fed enterally (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
4.
We suggest either early trophic/hypocaloric or early full enteral feeding in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c 
shock; if trophic/hypocaloric feeding is the ini�al strategy, then feeds should be advanced according to pa�ent 
tolerance (weak recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
5.
We recommend against the use of omega-3 fa�y acids as an immune supplement in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or 
sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
6.
We suggest against rou�nely monitoring gastric residual volumes in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock 
(weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence). However, we suggest measurement of gastric residuals in pa�ents 
with feeding intolerance or who are considered to be at high risk of aspira�on (weak recommenda�on, very low 
quality of evidence).
Remarks: This recommenda�on refers to nonsurgical cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock.
7.
We suggest the use of prokine�c agents in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock and feeding intolerance 
(weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
8.
We suggest placement of post-pyloric feeding tubes in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock with feeding 
intolerance or who are considered to be at high risk of aspira�on (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
9.
We recommend against the use of IV selenium to treat sepsis and sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on, moderate 
quality of evidence).
10. We suggest against the use of arginine to treat sepsis and sep�c shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of 
evidence).
 355
11. We recommend against the use of glutamine to treat sepsis and sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on, moderate 
quality of evidence).
12. We make no recommenda�on about the use of carni�ne for sepsis and sep�c shock.
U. SETTING GOALS OF CARE
1.
We recommend that goals of care and prognosis be discussed with pa�ents and families (BPS).
2.
We recommend that goals of care be incorporated into treatment and end-of-life care planning, u�lizing pallia�ve 
care principles where appropriate (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
3.
We suggest that goals of care be addressed as early as feasible, but no later than within 72 hours of ICU admission
(weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).

least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid be given within the first 3 hours (strong 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
3.
We recommend that, following ini�al fluid resuscita�on, addi�onal fluids be

ina�on and 
evalua�on of available physiologic variables (heart rate, blood pressure, arterial 
oxygen satura�on, respiratory rate, temperature, urine output, and others
, as 
available) as well as other noninvasive or invasive monitoring,as available.

We recommend further hemodynamic assessment (such as assessing cardiac 
func�on) to determine the type of shock if the clinical examina�on does not lead 
to a clear diagnosis (BPS).

We suggest that dynamic over sta�c variables be used to predict fluid 
responsiveness, where available (weak recommenda�on, low quality of 
evidence).

with sep�c shock requiring vasopressors (strong recommenda�on, moderate 
quality of evidence).

We recommend that appropriate rou�ne microbiologic cultures (including 
blood) be obtained before star�ng an�microbial therapy in pa�ents with 
cultures (both aerobic and anaerobic bo�les) be obtained before an�microbial 
therapy with at least 1 drawn percutaneously and 1 drawn through each vascular 
access device, unless the device was recently (<48 hrs) inserted (grade 1C).
2.
Use of the 1,3-ß-D-glucan assay (grade 2B), mannan and an�
-mannan an�body 
assays (2C), if available,and invasive candidiasis in differen�al diagnosis of cause 
of infec�on.

Imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a poten�al source of infec�on 
(UG).
suspected sepsis or sep�c shock if doing so results in no substan�al delay in the

sets of blood cultures(aerobic and anaerobic).
 356
D. ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY
1.
Administra�on of effec�ve IV an�microbials within the first hour of recogni�on 
of sep�c shock (grade 1B) and severe sepsis without sep�c shock (grade 1C) as 
the goal of therapy.
2.
Ini�al empiric an�infec�ve therapy of one or more drugs that have activity 
against all likely pathogens (bacterial and/or fungal or viral) and that penetrate in 
adequate concentra�ons into �ssues presumed to be the source of sepsis (grade 
1B).
3.
An�microbial regimen should be reassessed daily for poten�al de-escala�on 
(grade 1B).
4.
Use of low procalcitonin levels or similar biomarkers to assist the clinician in the 
discon�nua�on of empiric an�bio�cs in pa�ents who ini�ally appeared sep�c, 
but have no subsequent evidence of infec�on (grade 2C).
5.
Combina�on empirical therapy for neutropenic pa�ents with severe sepsis 
(grade 2B) and for pa�ents with difficult-to-treat, mul�drug-resistant bacterial 
pathogens such as Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species (grade 2B). For 
pa�ents with severe infec�ons associated with respiratory failure and sep�c 
shock, combina�on therapy with an extended-spectrum ß-lactam and either an 
aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia 
(grade 2B). A combina�on of ß-lactam and macrolide for pa�ents with sep�c 
shock from bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae infec�ons (grade 2B).
6.
Empiric combina�on therapy should not be administered for more than 3 to 5 
days. De-escala�on to the most appropriate single therapy should be performed 
as soon as the suscep�bility profile is known (grade 2B).
7.
Dura�on of therapy typically 7 to 10 days; longer courses may be appropriate in 
pa�ents who have a slow clinical response, undrainable foci of infec�on, 
bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, some fungal and viral infec�ons, or 
immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia (grade 2C).
8.

states determined to be of noninfec�ous cause (UG).
D. ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY
1.
We recommend that administra�on of IV an�microbials be ini�ated as soon as 
possible a�er recogni�on and within one hour for both sepsis and sep�c shock 
(strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
2.
We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more 
an�microbials for pa�ents presen�ng with sepsis or sep�c shock to cover all 
likely pathogens (including bacterial and poten�ally fungal or viral coverage) 
(strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
3.
We recommend that an�microbial therapy is narrowed once pathogen 
iden�fica�on and sensi�vi�es are established and/or adequate clinical 
improvement is noted (BPS).
4.
We recommend against sustained systemic an�microbial prophylaxis in pa�ents 
with severe inflammatory states of noninfec�ous origin (e.g., severe pancrea��s, 
burn injury) (BPS).
5.
We recommend that dosing strategies of an�microbials be op�mized based on 
accepted pharmacokine�c/pharmacodynamic principles and specific drug 
proper�es in pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock (BPS).
6.
We suggest empiric combina�on therapy (using at least two an�bio�cs of 
different an�microbial classes) aimed at the most likely bacterial pathogen(s) for 
the ini�al management of sep�c shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of 
evidence).
Remarks: Readers should review Table 6 for defini�ons of empiric, 
targeted/defini�ve, broad-spectrum, combina�on, and mul�drug therapy before 
reading this sec�on.
7.
We suggest that combina�on therapy not be rou�nely used for ongoing 
treatment of most other serious infec�ons, including bacteremia and sepsis 
without shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
Remarks: This does not preclude the use of mul�drug therapy to broaden 
an�microbial ac�vity.
8.
We recommend against combina�on therapy for the rou�ne treatment of 
neutropenic sepsis/bacteremia (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of 
evidence).
Remarks: This does not preclude the use of mul�drug therapy to broaden 
an�microbial ac�vity.
9.
If combina�on therapy is used for sep�c shock, we recommend de-escala�on 
with discon�nua�on of combina�on therapy within the first few days in 
response to clinical improvement and/or evidence of infec�on resolu�on. This 
applies to both targeted (for culture-posi�ve infec�ons) and empiric (for culture-
nega�ve infec�ons) combina�on therapy (BPS).
10. We suggest that an an�microbial treatment dura�on of 7 to 10 days is adequate 
for most serious infec�ons associated with sepsis and sep�c shock (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
11. We suggest that longer courses are appropriate in pa�ents who have a slow 
clinical response, undrainable foci of infec�on, bacteremia with Staphylococcus
aureus, some fungal and viral infec�ons, or immunologic deficiencies, including 
neutropenia (Weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
12. We suggest that shorter courses are appropriate in some pa�ents, par�cularly 
those with rapid clinical resolu�on following effec�ve source control of intra-
abdominal or urinary sepsis and those with anatomically uncomplicated 
pyelonephri�s (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
13. We recommend daily assessment for de-escala�on of an�microbial therapy in 
pa�ents with sepsis and sep�c shock (BPS).
14. We suggest that measurement of procalcitonin levels can be used to support 
shortening the dura�on of an�microbial therapy in sepsis pa�ents (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
15. We suggest that procalcitonin levels can be used to support the discon�nua�on 
of empiric an�bio�cs in pa�ents who ini�ally appeared to have sepsis, but 
subsequently have limited clinical evidence of infec�on (weak recommenda�on, 
low quality of evidence).
 357
E. SOURCE CONTROL
1.
A specific anatomic diagnosis of infec�on requiring considera�on for emergent 
source control be sought and diagnosed or excluded as rapidly as possible, and 
interven�on be undertaken for source control within the first 12 hours a�er the 
diagnosis is made, if feasible (grade 1C).
2.
When infected peripancrea�c necrosis is iden�fied as a poten�al source of 
infec�on, defini�ve interven�on is best delayed un�l adequate demarca�on of 
viable and nonviable �ssues has occurred (grade 2B).
3.
When source control in a severely sep�c pa�ent is required, the effec�ve 
interven�on associated with the least physiologic insult should be used (e.g., 
percutaneous rather than surgical drainage of an abscess) (UG).
4.
If intravascular access devices are a possible source of severe sepsis or sep�c 
shock, they should be removed promptly a�er other vascular access has been 
established (UG).
E. SOURCE CONTROL
1.
We recommend that a specific anatomic diagnosis of infec�on requiring 
emergent source control should be iden�fied or excluded as rapidly as possible 
in pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock, and that any required source control 
interven�on should be implemented as soon as medically and logis�cally 
prac�cal a�er the diagnosis is made (BPS).
2.
We recommend prompt removal of intravascular access devices that are a 
possible source of sepsis or sep�c shock a�er other vascular access has been 
established (BPS).

4.
Ini�al fluid challenge in pa�ents with sepsis-induced �ssue hypoperfusion with 
suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (a 
por�on of this may be albumin equivalent). More rapid administra�on and 
greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some pa�ents (grade 1C).
5.
Fluid challenge technique be applied wherein fluid administra�on is con�nued as 
long as there is hemodynamic improvement either based on dynamic (e.g., 
change in pulse pressure, stroke volume varia�on) or sta�c (e.g., arterial 
pressure, heart rate) variables (UG).
1.
We recommend that a fluid challenge technique be applied where fluid 
administra�on is con�nued as long as hemodynamic factors con�nue to improve 
(BPS).
2.
We recommend crystalloids as the fluid of choice for ini�al resuscita�on and 
subsequent intravascular volume replacement in pa�ents with sepsis and sep�c 
shock (strong recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
3.
We suggest using either balanced crystalloids or saline for fluid resuscita�on of 
pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock (weak recommenda�on, low quality of 
evidence).
4.
We suggest using albumin in addi�on to crystalloids for ini�al resuscita�on and

shock, when pa�ents require substan�al amounts of crystalloids (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
5.
We recommend against using hydroxyethyl starches for intravascular volume 
replacement in pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock (strong recommenda�on,
high quality of evidence).

either raising MAP or decreasing norepinephrine dosage (UG).
5.
Low-dose vasopressin is not recommended as the single ini�al vasopressor for 
treatment of sepsis-induced hypotension, and vasopressin doses higher than 
0.03–0.04 units/minute should be reserved for salvage therapy (failure to 
achieve adequate MAP with other vasopressor agents) (UG).
6.
Dopamine as an alterna�ve vasopressor agent to norepinephrine only in highly 
selected pa�ents (e.g., pa�ents with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute 
or rela�ve bradycardia) (grade 2C).
7.
Phenylephrine is not recommended in the treatment of sep�c shock except in 
circumstances where (a) norepinephrine is associated with serious arrhythmias, 
(b) cardiac output is known to be high and blood pressure persistently low, or (c) 
as salvage therapy when combined inotrope/vasopressor drugs and low-dose 
vasopressin have failed to achieve MAP target (grade 1C).
8.
Low-dose dopamine should not be used for renal protec�on (grade 1A).
9.
All pa�ents requiring vasopressors have an arterial catheter placed as soon as 
prac�cal if resources are available (UG).
10. A trial of dobutamine infusion up to 20 µg/kg/min be administered or added to 
G. VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS
1.
We recommend norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor (strong 
recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence).
2.
We suggest adding either vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) (weak 
recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence) or epinephrine (weak 
recommenda�on, low quality of evidence) to norepinephrine with the intent of 
raising mean arterial pressure to target, or adding vasopressin (up to 0.03 
U/min) (weak recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence) to decrease
norepinephrine dosage.
3.
We suggest using dopamine as an alterna�ve vasopressor agent to 
norepinephrine only in highly selected pa�ents (e.g., pa�ents with low risk of 
tachyarrhythmias and absolute or rela�ve bradycardia) (weak recommenda�on,
low quality of evidence).
4.
We recommend against using low-dose dopamine for renal protec�on (strong 
recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).
5.
We suggest using dobutamine in pa�ents who show evidence of persistent 
hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid loading and the use of vasopressor agents 
(weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
Remarks: If ini�ated, dosing should be �trated to an end point reflec�ng 
perfusion, and the agent reduced or discon�nued in the face of worsening 
hypotension or arrhythmias.
6.
We suggest that all pa�ents requiring vasopressors have an arterial catheter 
placed as soon as prac�cal if resources are available (weak recommenda�on,
very low quality of evidence).
 358
vasopressor (if in use) in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunc�on as suggested

11. Not using a strategy to increase cardiac index to predetermined supranormal 
levels (grade 1B).
H. CORTICOSTEROIDS
1.
Not using IV hydrocor�sone to treat adult sep�c shock pa�ents if adequate fluid

H. CORTICOSTEROIDS
1.
We suggest against using IV hydrocor�sone to treat sep�c shock pa�ents if 
adequate fluid resuscita�on and vasopressor therapy are able to restore 
hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, we suggest IV hydrocor�sone at 
a dose of 200 mg per day (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
I. BLOOD PRODUCTS
1.
Once �ssue hypoperfusion has resolved and in the absence of extenua�ng 
circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, acute 
hemorrhage, or ischemic heart disease, we recommend that RBC transfusion 
occur only when hemoglobin concentra�on decreases to < 7.0 g/dL to target a 
hemoglobin concentra�on of 7.0–9.0 g/dL in adults (grade 1B).

the pa�ent has a significant risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts (≥
50,000/mm3 [50 × 109/L]) are advised for ac�ve bleeding, surgery, or invasive 
procedures (grade 2D).

O. GLUCOSE CONTROL
1.
A protocolized approach to blood glucose management in ICU pa�ents with 
severe sepsis commencing insulin dosing when 
consecu�ve blood glucose levels 
are > 180 mg/dL. This protocolized approach should target an upper blood 
glucose level ≤ 180 mg/dL rather than an upper target blood glucose 
level ≤ 110 
mg/dL (grade 1A).
2.
Blood glucose values be monitored every 1to 2 hours un�l glucose values and 
insulin infusion rates are stable and then every 4 h
ours therea�er (grade 1C).

-of-care tes�ng of capillary blood be 
interpreted with cau�on because such measurements may not accurately 
es�mate arterial blood or plasma glucose values (UG).
O. GLUCOSE CONTROL
1.
We recommend a protocolized approach to blood glucose management in ICU 
pa�ents with sepsis, commencing insulin dosing when 
two consecu�ve blood 
glucose levels are >180 mg/dL. This approach should target an upper blood 
glucose level ≤ 180 mg/dL rather than an upper target blood glucose 
level ≤ 110 
mg/dL (strong recommenda�on, high quality of evidence).
2.
We recommend that blood glucose values be monitored every 1 to 2hours un�l 
glucose values and insulin infusion rates are stable, then every 4 h
ours 
therea�er in pa�ents receiving insulin infusions (BPS)
.
3.
We recommend that glucose levels obtained with point
-of-care tes�ng of 
capillary blood be interpreted with caut
ion because such measurements may not 
accurately es�mate arterial blood or plasma glucose values (BPS)
.
4.
We suggest the use of arterial blood rather than capillary blood for point
-of-care 
tes�ng using glucose meters if pa�ents have arterial catheters (
weak

subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (grade 1B versus twice 
daily unfrac�onated heparin [UFH], grade 2C versus three �mes daily UFH). If 
crea�nine clearance is <30 mL/min, use dalteparin (grade 1A) or another form 
of LMWH that has a low degree of renal metabolism (grade 2C) or UFH (grade 
1A).
2.

.g., 
thrombocytopenia, severe coagulopathy, ac�ve bleeding, recent intracerebral 
hemorrhage) not receive pharmacoprophylaxis (grade 1B), but receive

complete fas�ng or provision of only 
IV glucose within the first 48 hours a�er a 
diagnosis of severe sepsisor sep�c shock (grade 2C).
2.
Avoid mandatory full caloric feeding in the 
first week but rather suggest low-
dose feeding (e.g., up to 500 calories per day), advancing only as tolerated 
(grade 2B).
3.

or parenteral nutri�on in conjunc�on with enteralfeeding in the first 7 days 
a�er a diagnosis of severe sepsisor sep�c shock (grade 2B).
4.
Use nutri�on with no specific immunomodula�ng supplementa�on rather than 
nutri�on providing specific immunomodula�ng supplementa�on in pa�ents with 
severe sepsis (grade 2C).

or sep�c shock for whom early enteral feeding is not feasible (
strong 
recommenda�on, moderate quality of evidence)

only IV glucose in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shoc
k who can be fed 
enterally (weak recommenda�on, low quality of evidence).
4.
We suggest either early trophic/hypocaloricor early full enteral feeding in

-3 fa�y acids as an immune 
supplement in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or sep�c shock (

sepsis or sep�c shock.
7.
We suggest the use of prokine�c agents in cri�cally ill pa�ents with sepsis or 
sep�c shock and feeding intolerance (
weak recommenda�on, low quality of 
evidence).
