IMPORTANCE Body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain are increasing globally. In
2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) provided specific recommendations regarding the ideal
gestational weight gain. However, the association between gestational weight gain consistent
with theIOM guidelines and pregnancy outcomes is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression
to evaluate associations between gestational weight gain above or below the IOM guidelines
(gain of 12.5-18 kg for underweight women [BMI <18.5]; 11.5-16 kg for normal-weight women
[BMI 18.5-24.9]; 7-11 kg for overweight women [BMI 25-29.9]; and 5-9 kg for obese women
[BMI �30]) and maternal and infant outcomes.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Search of EMBASE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews,
MEDLINE, and MEDLINE In-Process between January 1, 1999, and February 7, 2017, for observa-
tional studies stratified by prepregnancy BMI category and total gestational weight gain.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Odds
ratios (ORs) and absolute risk differences (ARDs) per live birth were calculated using a
random-effects model based on a subset of studies with available data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were small for gestational age (SGA),
preterm birth, and large for gestational age (LGA). Secondary outcomes were macrosomia,
cesarean delivery, and gestational diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS Of 5354 identified studies, 23 (n = 1 309 136 women) met inclusion criteria.
Gestational weight gain was below or above guidelines in 23% and 47% of pregnancies,
respectively. Gestational weight gain below the recommendations was associated with higher
risk of SGA (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.44-1.64]; ARD, 5% [95% CI, 4%-6%]) and preterm birth (OR,
1.70 [1.32-2.20]; ARD, 5% [3%-8%]) and lower risk of LGA (OR, 0.59 [0.55-0.64]; ARD, −2%
[−10% to −6%]) and macrosomia (OR, 0.60 [0.52-0.68]; ARD, −2% [−3% to −1%]); cesarean
delivery showed no significant difference (OR, 0.98 [0.96-1.02]; ARD, 0% [−2% to 1%]).
Gestational weight gain above the recommendations was associated with lower risk of SGA
(OR, 0.66 [0.63-0.69]; ARD, −3%; [−4% to −2%]) and preterm birth (OR, 0.77 [0.69-0.86];
ARD, −2% [−2% to −1%]) and higher risk of LGA (OR, 1.85 [1.76-1.95]; ARD, 4% [2%-5%]),
macrosomia (OR, 1.95 [1.79-2.11]; ARD, 6% [4%-9%]), and cesarean delivery (OR, 1.30
[1.25-1.35]; ARD, 4% [3%-6%]). Gestational diabetes mellitus could not be evaluated because
of the nature of available data.

xcessive and insufficient gestational weight gain have
been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes,
including small for gestational age (SGA), large for ges-
tational age (LGA), macrosomia, cesarean delivery, gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, postpartum
weight retention, and offspring obesity.1-4 The Institute of
Medicine (IOM; now known as the National Academy of
Medicine) recommendations regarding gestational weight
gain were developed in 1990 to guide clinical practice.5 These
aimed to reduce the incidence of low-birth-weight babies and
were based on a 1980 National Natality Survey of a largely
white population. The updated IOM guidelines in 20096
incorporated World Health Organization (WHO) categories of
maternal body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared; BMI for under-
weight, <18.5; normal weight, 18.5-24.9; overweight, 25-29.9;
and obese, ≥30)7 and recommended less gestational weight
gain for obese women (Table 1). The 2009 guidelines identi-
fied maternal and infant relationships with gestational
weight gain but were based on lower general population BMI
with limited ethnic diversity. The 2009 IOM guidelines are
endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists, although they are not universally implemented.8

The purpose of this review and meta-analysis was to com-
pare gestational weight gain with IOM guidelines from di-
verse international cohorts and to evaluate associations be-
tweengestationalweightgainaboveandbelowguidelineswith
maternal and infant outcomes.
Methods
This systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression
was prospectively registered with PROSPERO International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO iden-
tifier CRD42015023325).
Search Strategy
A systematic search string of relevant terms was developed
(eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). Searched databases in Ovid
included EMBASE, all Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews,
MEDLINE, and MEDLINE In-Process from January 1, 1999, to
January 28, 2016 (Figure 1). The search was limited to articles
from 1999 onward to represent more current populations.
The search was later updated to February 7, 2017. Of 7 newly
identified studies, 4 were included in the analyses. Three
studies were excluded because the data were not in the
required format, and there was insufficient time to obtain
data from the authors. Bibliographies of included studies
were reviewed to identify additional studies. Details of the
search strategy and data extraction are shown in eAppendix 2
in the Supplement.
Study Eligibility Criteria
ObservationalstudiespublishedinEnglishandassessingsingle-
tonpregnanciesinwomenaged18yearsorolderwereincluded.
Study sample sizes larger than 500 women were required to
identify outcomes present across the BMI categories. We pos-
tulated that small studies would have insufficient sample size
to detect outcomes within each BMI group. Studies were in-
cluded if they presented data examining women by prepreg-
nancy BMI category, stratified by the total gestational weight
gain. Studies that categorized by mean weight gain per week
wereexcluded.Onlystudiespresentingoddsratios(ORs)strati-
fiedbymaternalBMIandgestationalweightgainwereincluded.
Studies that simultaneously adjusted for categories of BMI and
gestational weight gain to estimate the independent associa-
tions of weight change with outcomes were excluded because
theaimofthisreviewwastoassesstheassociationofgestational
weight gain (specific for each BMI category) and outcomes.
Studies meeting these criteria used different BMI cat-
egories (eg, Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables, WHO classi-
fications, or Chinese classifications11 [BMI for underweight,
<18.5; normal weight, 18.5-23.9; overweight, 24-28; and obese,
≥28]) and gestational weight gain categories (eg, 1990 IOM,
2009 IOM, population-specific, or study-specific categories)
to classify participants. Additionally, some studies used a ref-
erence of normal gestational weight gain within each BMI
group, whereas others used a reference of normal-weight
women with normal weight gain.
In this review, BMI was defined by WHO categories and/or
Chinese BMI categories. Gestational weight gain was defined
by 2009 IOM criteria; thus, authors of identified studies were
contacted to reanalyze data using these categories. The ORs
were calculated using recommended gestational weight gain
within each BMI category as the reference.
Gestational weight gain was defined as the difference be-
tween the final weight and the prepregnancy weight and was
classified as below, within, or above the 2009 IOM guide-
lines.Theprepregnancyweightwaseitherself-reported(which
correlates well with measured weight12,13) or measured at first
antenatal visits. Final pregnancy weight was measured at the
Key Points
Question What is the association between gestational weight
gain above or below the Institute of Medicine guidelines and
maternal and infant outcomes?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 1 309 136
pregnancies, gestational weight gain below recommendations
(in 23% of women) was associated with higher risk of small for
gestational age (odds ratio [OR], 1.53) and preterm birth (OR, 1.70)
and lower risk of large for gestational age (OR, 0.59) and
macrosomia (OR, 0.60). Gestational weight gain above
recommendations (47%) was associated with lower risk of small
for gestational age (OR, 0.66) and preterm birth (OR, 0.77) and
higher risk of large for gestational age (OR, 1.85), macrosomia (OR,
1.95), and cesarean delivery (OR, 1.30).
Meaning Gestational weight gain below or above the Institute of
Medicine guidelines was associated with higher risk of some
adverse maternal and infant outcomes.

Primary outcomes were the following: (1) SGA, indicated

(2) preterm birth, indicated by spontaneous birth before 37
weeks’gestation;and(3)LGA,indicatedbybirthweightgreater
than the 90th percentile for gestational age. Secondary out-
comes were the following: (1) macrosomia, indicated by birth
weightgreaterthan4000g;(2)cesareandelivery;and(3)GDM.
Outcomes were selected based on the original IOM studies,6
and end points were determined on a 2-round Delphi survey
of experienced clinicians that was used to rank clinically im-
portant outcomes in a meta-analysis of lifestyle interven-
tions to reduce weight gain in pregnancy.14
Risk of Bias Appraisal
Two authors assessed risk of bias (R.F.G. and S.K.A.). Discrep-
ancies were resolved by consensus in discussion with a third
reviewer (M.M.). Methodological quality of included studies
was assessed using the Monash Centre for Health Research and
Implementation evidence synthesis appraisal assessment
tool.15,16 Individual quality items were assessed using a de-
scriptive approach including exposure and outcome mea-
sures,reportingbias,confounding,andconflictofinterest.Each
study was classified as low, medium, or high risk of bias.
Data Synthesis Strategy
Findings were synthesized by target population characteris-
tics, study type, and outcome. Outcome measures were pro-
duced for each study by calculating ORs and 95% confidence
intervals, using recommended gestational weight gain within
each BMI category as the reference. When 2 or more studies
assessed the same outcome, results were pooled using both
fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis. There were no sig-
nificant differences between fixed- and random-effects analy-
ses. Random effects are presented given heterogeneity among
studies. Extracted pooled ORs for individual outcomes were
combined to construct summary pooled ORs. Crude data were
used where possible, given variable control for confounding
factors. However, some articles presented adjusted ORs
only.17-24 Absolute risk differences (ARDs) per live birth were
calculated from event rates (available for a subset of studies)
using random-effects meta-analysis.
Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, where
I2 > 50% indicated substantial heterogeneity.25 Metaregres-
sionwasperformedtoinvestigatesourcesofheterogeneity(per-
centage of smokers during pregnancy, mean age, and percent-
age of nulliparous women). Race/ethnicity data were not
available for the metaregression. Where 5 or more studies were
available, publication bias was assessed using Egger test
plots.26,27Statisticalsignificancewasdefinedas2-sidedP < .05.
StatisticalanalysisusedStatasoftwareversion14(StataCorpLP).
A subgroup analysis was performed in specific population
groups identified a priori (studies using Chinese or Korean BMI
categories, not presented herein). Obesity subclasses were in-
cluded after reviewing studies that stratified by obesity class.
TestsfortrendbasedontheCochran-ArmitagetestinStatawere
used to assess trends in this subgroup analysis.
Results
Study Selection
Of 5874 studies identified by the initial search, 302 were se-
lected for full-text review; 261 of these were excluded, leaving
41 (Figure 1). These studies grouped women by prepregnancy
BMI category, stratified by total gestational weight gain.
One study28 did not meet inclusion criteria as published;
however, prior collaboration had made data available in the
required format. Of 41 identified studies, 18 were excluded
because data could not be obtained in the required format.
Ofthese18studies,authorsof15werecontactedandunableto
reanalyze and authors of 3 were not contacted from the
updated search because of insufficient time prior to publica-
tion (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). Overall, 23 cohort
studies17-24,28-42 were included, involving 1 309 136 women.
Of these 23 studies, 7 were included without contacting the
authors because data were in the required format. Of 16 au-
thors contacted, 13 reanalyzed data and were included; 3 pro-
vided additional information, thereby avoiding reanalysis.
Study Characteristics
Table 2 and Table 3 list characteristics of the studies
(descriptive characteristics are shown in eTable 1 in the Sup-
plement). Eighteen studies were retrospective, and 5
were prospective.20,29,32,33,42 Ten were from the United
States,18-20,23,28,31,35,38,40,41 8 were from Asia (4 from
China,21,29,32,362fromKorea,34,39and1eachfromTaiwan24and
Japan22), and 5 were from Europe (1 each from Norway,33
Belgium,30 Italy,37 Denmark,42 and Sweden17). Sample sizes
ranged from 1034 to 570 672 women.
Underweight women composed 7% (n = 94 399); normal-
weight women, 55% (n = 720 456); overweight women, 18%
(n = 235 295); and obese women, 20% (n = 258 986). Gesta-
tional weight gain was below, within, or above guidelines in
23% (n = 300 723), 30% (n = 387 409), and 47% (n = 621 004),
respectively.

Primary Outcomes
Small for Gestational Age
Eleven studies assessed SGA, defined as birth weight less than
the 10th percentile for gestational age in 5 studies.22,31,36,39,40
Four studies defined SGA by additionally accounting for
sex,24,28,33,38 1 for sex and race/ethnicity,41 and another for sex,
race, and parity.23
Across BMI categories, gestational weight gain below
guidelines was associated with higher risk for SGA than ges-
tational weight gain within guidelines (OR, 1.53
[95% CI, 1.44 to 1.64]; I2 = 82.8%; ARD, 5% [95% CI, 4% to
6%]). This association was greatest in lower prepregnancy
BMI (underweight: OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.67 to 2.14]; ARD, 8%
[95% CI, 6% to 11%]; normal weight: OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.54
to 1.71]; ARD, 5% [95% CI, 4% to 6%]; overweight: OR, 1.34
[95% CI, 1.24 to 1.44]; ARD, 3% [95% CI, 3% to 4%]; and
obese: OR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.45]; ARD, 2% [95% CI, 2%
to 3%]).
Compared with gestational weight gain within guide-
lines, gain above guidelines was associated with lower risk for
SGA (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.69]; I2 = 56%; ARD, −3% [95%
CI, −4% to −2%]). The association was similar across BMI cat-
egories (underweight: OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.72]; ARD,
−6% [95% CI, −8% to −3%]; normal weight: OR, 0.65 [95% CI,
0.62 to 0.68]; ARD, −2% [95% CI, −3% to−1%]; overweight: OR,
0.65 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.71]; ARD, −3% [95% CI, −4% to −2%];
and obese: OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.80]; ARD, −2% [95%
CI, −3% to −1%]).
Preterm Birth
Four studies assessed preterm birth (<37 weeks’gestation). Of
these, 3 did not specify whether the preterm birth was spon-
taneous or induced28,31,36 and 1 specified spontaneous and in-
duced combined.22
Compared with gestational weight gain within guide-
lines, weight gain below guidelines was associated with
higher risk for preterm birth (OR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.32 to 2.20];
I2 = 97.3%; ARD, 5% [95% CI, 3% to 8%]). This association
was greatest with lower BMI (underweight: OR, 2.41 [95%
CI, 1.01 to 5.73]; ARD, 8% [95% CI, 1% to 15%]; normal
weight: OR, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.17 to 3.29]; ARD, 6% [95% CI, 0%
to 11%]; overweight: OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.10 to 2.19]; ARD, 4%
[95% CI, −1% to 9%]; and obese: OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.03 to
1.40]; ARD, 3% [95% CI, 1% to 5%]).
Gestational weight gain above guidelines was associated
with lower risk for preterm birth (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69 to
0.86]; I2 = 78.7%; ARD, −2% [95% CI, −2% to −1%]). This as-
sociation was significant for normal-weight and overweight
women (underweight: OR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.50 to 1.28]; ARD,
−1% [95% CI, −3% to 0%]; normal weight: OR, 0.76 [95% CI,
0.59 to 0.97]; ARD, −1% [95% CI, −2% to 0%]; overweight: OR,
0.70 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.93]; ARD, −3% [95% CI, −5% to −1%];
and obese: OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.93]; ARD, −2% [95% CI,
−5% to 2%]).
Large for Gestational Age
Thirteen studies assessed LGA, defined as birth weight
greater than the 90th percentile for gestational age in 6
studies.22,31,34,36,39,40 Four defined LGA by additionally ac-
counting for infant sex,24,28,33,38 1 for sex and race/ethnicity,41
1 for sex, race, and parity,23 and 1 for sex, parity, and study
center.20

Pooled ORs are shown for the
association between gestational
weight gain below (A) and above
(B) guidelines with adverse
outcomes. Reference group is
women with recommended weight
gain in each category of body mass
index (BMI; calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters
squared). For each outcome, the
sample size represents the total
number of women in the studies that
assessed the outcome. For each BMI
category, the sample size represents
the total number of women with
gestational weight gain below or
above the guidelines. LGA indicates
large for gestational age; SGA, small
for gestational age.

with higher risk of LGA (OR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.76 to 1.95];
I2 = 74.6%; ARD, 4% [95% CI, 2% to 5%]). The association in-

Secondary Outcomes
Macrosomia
Of 11 studies assessing macrosomia, 10 defined macrosomia
as birth weight greater than 4000 g,19,22-24,28,33,36,37,39,42 and
1 defined it as birth weight greater than 4500 g.41
Gestational weight gain below guidelines was associated
withlowerriskofmacrosomia(OR,0.60[95%CI,0.52to0.68];
I2 = 66.3%; ARD, −2% [95% CI, −3% to −1%]). The association
was strongest in underweight women (underweight: OR, 0.43
[95% CI, 0.27 to 0.69]; ARD, −1% [95% CI, −3% to 0%]; nor-
mal weight: OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.68]; ARD, −2% [95%
CI, −5% to 1%]; overweight: OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.89];
ARD, −2% [95% CI, −6% to 2%]; and obese: OR, 0.70 [95% CI,
0.59 to 0.82]; ARD, −3% [−4% to −2%]).
Gestational weight gain above guidelines was associated
with higher risk of macrosomia (OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.79 to
2.11]; I2 = 58.2%; ARD, 6% [95% CI, 4% to 9%]). This associa-
tion was strongest in underweight women according to the
ORs, and all associations were significant according to the
ARDs (underweight: OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.62 to 3.29]; ARD, 3%
[95% CI, 2% to 4%]; normal weight: OR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.77 to
2.27]; ARD, 10% [95% CI, 5% to 15%]; overweight: OR, 1.90
[95% CI, 1.54 to 2.33]; ARD, 5% [95% CI, 1% to 10%]; and
obese: OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.52 to 2.22]; ARD, 6% [95% CI, 1%
to 12%]).
Cesarean Delivery
Eightstudiesassessedcesareandelivery.Sevenincludedemer-
gency and elective deliveries,22,28,29,33,36,37,39 and 1 did not
specify.24 One study28 included repeated cesarean delivery
(total cesarean deliveries), 1 included primary cesarean deliv-
ery only,24 and 6 did not distinguish these.
Gestational weight gain below guidelines was not signifi-
cantly associated with cesarean delivery (OR, 0.98 [95% CI,
0.96 to 1.02]; I2 = 62.6%; ARD, 0% [−2% to 1%]).
Gestational weight gain above guidelines was associated
with higher risk of cesarean delivery (OR, 1.30 [95 CI, 1.25 to
1.35]; I2 = 21.9%; ARD, 4% [95% CI, 3% to 6%]). The ARD was
significant for underweight women only (underweight: OR,
1.45 [95% CI, 1.22 to 1.71]; ARD, 6% [95% CI, 1% to 12%]; nor-
mal weight: OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36]; ARD, 0% [95% CI,
−4% to 3%]; overweight: OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.21 to 1.39]; ARD,
1% [0% to 3%]; and obese: OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.42]; ARD,
−2% [95% CI, −5% to 1%]).
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
Six studies assessed GDM, but they did not use consistent
definitions and had different findings for gestational weight
gain above guidelines and GDM risk. Black et al28 defined
GDM by International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy
Study Groups criteria and included only women not treated
for hyperglycemia (the center used different criteria in clini-
cal practice and excluded those treated). They found no
association between weight gain above guidelines and GDM
in the underweight, normal-weight, and obese groups but
reported lower risk in overweight women. Enomoto et al22
used International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy
Study Groups criteria, with higher risk in normal-weight
women and lower risk in overweight women. Durst et al23
used Carpenter-Coustan criteria and found no association.
Hung and Hsieh24 used Carpenter-Coustan and Interna-
tional Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups
criteria and found an association of gestational weight gain
above guidelines with lower risk of GDM in overweight and
obese women. Li et al36 included both impaired glucose tol-
erance and type 2 diabetes by WHO criteria, with weight
gain above guidelines associated with lower risk of GDM in
all groups except obese women. Shin and Song31 used self-
reported GDM and found an association of gestational
weight gain above guidelines with lower risk in all groups
except underweight women.
An intended meta-analysis of gestational weight gain and
its relationship to GDM could not be completed because of in-
consistent definitions and treatments.
Obese Subgroup Analysis Stratified by Obesity Class
Obesity classes include the following: class 1, BMI of 30 to
34.9; class 2, BMI of 35 to 39.9; and class 3, BMI of 40 or
higher. Obese studies generally included a subgroup-defined
weight loss as well as gestational weight gain below, within,

fied by BMI classes 1 through 3.17,18,30 Another study35 inves-
tigated only superobese women (BMI ≥50) and was included
in the obesity class 3 analysis. These 4 studies were included
in the subgroup analysis only (not in the overall meta-
analyses). Class 1 included 67% of women; class 2, 22%; and
class 3, 11%. Weight loss and gestational weight gain below,

25%, and 57% of pregnancies, respectively.

Pooled ORs are shown for the
association between gestational
weight loss (A), gestational weight
gain below guidelines (B), and
gestational weight gain above
guidelines (C) with adverse
outcomes. Obesity classes indicate
body mass index (BMI; calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared) as follows: class 1,
BMI of 30 to 34.9; class 2, BMI of 35
to 39.9; and class 3, BMI of 40 or
higher. Reference group is women
with recommended weight gain in
each category of BMI. For each
outcome, the sample size represents
the total number of women in the
studies that assessed the outcome.
For each obesity category, the sample
size represents the total number of
women with weight loss, gestational
weight gain below the guidelines, or
gestational weight gain above the
guidelines.

 and multiparous women (multiparous values used herein),
whereas other studies combined women with different par-
ity into 1 group.
SGA by Obesity Class
Three studies assessed SGA. One defined SGA as birth weight
less than the 10th percentile for gestational age alone,18 and 2
also used sex and parity to define SGA.17,30
Weight loss and weight gain below guidelines were asso-
ciated with higher SGA risk (weight loss: OR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.56
to 2.05]; I2 = 0%; ARD, 3% [95% CI, 1% to 5%]; weight gain be-
low guidelines: OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.41]; I2 = 20.7%; ARD,
1% [95% CI, 1% to 1%]). Gestational weight gain above guide-
lines was associated with lower SGA risk (OR, 0.62 [95% CI,
0.57 to 0.67]; I2 = 13.5%; ARD, −1% [−2% to 0%]). Weight gain
in class 1 had the strongest association with lower SGA risk
(lowest OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.72]; P for trend < .001).
LGA by Obesity Class
Three studies assessed LGA. One defined LGA as birth weight
greaterthanthe90thpercentileforgestationalagealone,18and
2 also used sex and parity to define LGA.17,30
Weight loss and gestational weight gain below guidelines
wereassociatedwithlowerLGArisk(weightloss:OR,0.58[95%
CI, 0.52 to 0.66]; I2 = 11.6%; ARD, −5% [95% CI, −7% to −3%];
weight gain below guidelines: OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84];
I2 = 0%; ARD, −2% [95% CI, −3% to −1%]). Weight loss in class
3 had the strongest association with lower LGA risk (lowest OR,
0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.67]; P for trend < .001). Weight gain
above guidelines was associated with higher LGA risk (OR, 1.79
[95% CI, 1.70 to 1.89]; I2 = 69.3%; ARD, 5% [95% CI, 5% to 6%]).
LGA was most strongly associated with class 1 obesity com-
pared with the other classes (highest OR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.75 to
2.00]; P for trend < .001).
Macrosomia by Obesity Class
Three studies assessed macrosomia, defined as birth weight
greater than 4000 g in 1 study,30 greater than 4500 g in 1
study,18 and both greater than 4000 g and greater than 4500 g
in 1 study.35 Meta-analysis used data for birth weight greater
than 4000 g.
Weight loss and gestational weight gain below guidelines
were associated with lower macrosomia risk (weight loss: OR,
0.46[95%CI,0.36to0.58];I2 = 34.0%;ARD,−5%[95%CI,−9%
to −2%]; weight gain below guidelines: OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.68
to 0.86]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −2% [95% CI, −3% to 0%]). Low weight
gain in class 3 had the strongest association with lower mac-
rosomia risk (lowest OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85]; P for
trend = .046). Gestational weight gain above guidelines was
associated with higher risk of macrosomia (OR, 1.60 [95% CI,
1.46 to 1.75]; I2 = 66.9%; ARD, 3% [95% CI, 0% to 6%]).
Cesarean Delivery by Obesity Class
Four studies assessed cesarean delivery. They included
emergency,30 emergency and elective,18,35 and undefined17 in-
dications for cesarean delivery.
Weight loss and gestational weight gain below guidelines
were associated with lower risk of cesarean delivery (weight
loss:OR,0.78[95%CI,0.72to0.85];I2 = 34.3%;ARD,−4%[95%
CI, −6% to −3%]; weight gain below guidelines: OR, 0.87 [95%
CI,0.82to0.93];I2 = 0%;ARD,−2%[95%CI,−3%to−1%]).Ges-
tational weight gain above guidelines was associated with
higher risk of cesarean delivery (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.25];
I2 = 0%; ARD, 2% [95% CI, 0% to 3%]).
Metaregression
Substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) was present for gesta-
tional weight gain below and above guidelines for SGA, pre-
term birth, LGA, and macrosomia and for gestational weight
gain above guidelines for cesarean delivery. When sufficient
data were available, metaregression analysis was performed
to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity: percentage of
smokers during pregnancy, mean age, and percentage of nul-
liparous women (eTable 5 in the Supplement). The obese sub-
groups had insufficient studies to perform metaregression.
Gestational weight gain above guidelines and LGA dem-
onstratedasourceforheterogeneity(P = .04);specifically,there
was an association between the treatment effect and the co-
variate smoking (P = .02). For gestational weight gain below
guidelines and preterm birth, mean maternal age was the only
covariate associated with outcome, where the risk for pre-
term birth varied by maternal age due to the heterogeneity in
maternal age in included studies (P = .03); however, the over-
all P value was not significant (P = .09). Heterogeneity was un-
explained for remaining outcomes.
Publication Bias
There was no evidence of publication bias for SGA, LGA, mac-
rosomia or cesarean delivery (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Assessment for publication bias was not performed for pre-
term births (<5 studies).
Risk of Bias
Participants were selected from maternity clinics or from large
data sets (Table 4). Apart from 3 studies,19,23,32 inclusion and
exclusioncriteriawereadequatelydescribed.Performancebias
(a potential difference in the care provided between BMI
groups) was difficult to assess. Very few studies provided in-
formation regarding diet and/or exercise advice given and
whether this differed between groups. Overweight and obese
women were possibly treated more intensively, which could
introduce bias.
Three studies demonstrated moderate bias risk19,21,31
and 20 demonstrated low bias risk.17,18,20,22-24,28-30,32-42
Reasons for moderate bias risk included self-reported final
weight (detection bias), self-reported outcome measures
(detection bias), failure to report all outcomes (report bias),
and insufficient adjustment for confounding variables
(confounding bias). Nineteen studies reported no conflict
of interest.

 recommendations, this could correspond to 15 000 more
preterm birth events. Weight gain above guidelines was
associated with lower risk of preterm birth. Prior reviews
have shown similar associations, but they did not stratify by
prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain.47,48 One
small systematic review in obese women did not find asso-
ciations between preterm birth and weight gain outside
guidelines.49 With larger sample sizes and stratification by
BMI and prepregnancy weight gain, the current review adds
to prior work and has greater clinical applicability. Also, as
maternal BMI increased, the association between gesta-
tional weight gain below guidelines and preterm birth risk
was weakened, consistent with an earlier review.3
Gestational weight gain below guidelines was associated
with lower risks of LGA and macrosomia. This association was
lowest in underweight women. Weight gain above guidelines
was associated with higher risks of LGA and macrosomia, with
ARDs of 4% and 6% greater risks, respectively. Underweight
status was associated with the greatest risk. This is similar to
the 2009 IOM report6 that stated, “the lower the prepreg-
nancyBMI,thestrongertheassociationbetweenincreasedges-
tational weight gain and birthweight”; it may be related to
higher absolute weight gain in underweight women.1 Animal
studies suggest that baseline maternal BMI and gestational
weight gain are associated with changes in the hormonal mi-
lieu, including insulin resistance.50 Similarly, excess weight
gain in underweight women may be associated with greater
changes in the hormonal milieu and placental function than
in normal-weight or overweight women. Weight gain above
guidelines was associated with increased risk of cesarean de-
livery across the BMI spectrum.
Similarly, within the obese subgroups, weight loss was as-
sociated with a 5% lower risk for both LGA and macrosomia
and 4% lower risk for cesarean delivery. Weight gain below
guidelines was associated with 2% lower risk across all these
outcomes. Class 3 obesity combined with weight loss was as-
sociated with the greatest LGA risk reduction. Gestational
weight gain above guidelines was associated with increased
LGA risk. Class 1 obesity was associated with the greatest risk
for LGA, which may be partly due to higher absolute weight
gain in less obese women.10 While other systematic reviews
have assessed gestational weight gain below guidelines,26 to
our knowledge, this is the first review exploring relation-
ships between weight gain above guidelines and outcomes
within obesity classes.
While GDM has adverse maternal and infant outcomes51
and is related to maternal BMI and possibly to gestational
weight gain, associations could not be assessed because of
heterogeneity of diagnosis and treatment as well as the po-
tentialeffectofGDMtreatmentongestationalweightgain.Prior
systematic reviews have not demonstrated that healthy life-
style and gestational weight gain reduced rates of GDM,14 even
in high-risk populations.52 Consistent diagnostic criteria and
reporting of gestational weight gain at GDM diagnosis are
needed to study associations between gestational weight gain
and GDM.
Lifestyle interventions in pregnancy can help women at-
tain recommended gestational weight gain.14 Optimal inter-
ventions and effects on outcomes are currently being studied
in a large-scale international individual patient data
meta-analysis.53TheWHOhasprioritizedachievementofideal
BMI prior to conception and prevention of excess gestational
weightgain.54Identificationofwomenpriortoconceptionand
implementing healthy lifestyle strategies before and during
pregnancy have yet to be integrated into routine health care,55
requiring research implementation.
Strengths of this review are the inclusion of common ma-
ternal and infant risks associated with gestational weight gain
below and above the 2009 IOM guidelines in women across
the prepregnancy BMI spectrum and across international co-
horts. Four databases were searched, a risk of bias appraisal
was performed, and reanalyses were undertaken, allowing in-
clusion of data from more than 1.3 million pregnant women
globally. Collaboration with other authors facilitated more ho-
mogeneous data, data integration, and meta-analysis.
Limitations
This study has limitations. It lacks studies from developing
countries and excluded non-English-language articles. Fif-
teen of 31 authors contacted were unable to reanalyze data,
so these studies were excluded from the meta-analysis. A
meta-analysis could not be performed for GDM because of
inconsistent primary data. Some outcomes were assessed in
only 1 study, precluding meta-analysis. Inconsistent defini-
tions of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and macrosomia
limited interpretation of findings. Study heterogeneity may
have affected reliability of results, although the metaregres-
sion did not identify characteristics responsible for this
heterogeneity. Studies published before 2009 IOM guide-
lines were included, and gestational weight gain targets
before and after these guidelines may have differed. Pre-
term birth was not adjusted for gestational age, potentially
resulting in less total gestational weight gain than would
have been otherwise attained. Spontaneous and induced
preterm birth were not clearly differentiated, and studies
did not distinguish between emergency and elective or pri-
mary and repeated cesarean deliveries. These factors may
limit interpretation and underscore the importance of
improving outcome definition reporting. Event rates were
not available for all studies, limiting interpretation of ARDs.
Findings from this review are based on observational data
and no causal links may be concluded. They may be appli-
cable on a population level, but recommendations need to
be individualized when applied clinically.
Conclusions
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 1 mil-
lion pregnant women, 47% had gestational weight gain greater
than IOM recommendations and 23% had gestational weight
gain less than IOM recommendations. Gestational weight gain
greater than or less than guideline recommendations, com-
pared with gestational weight gain within recommended lev-
els, was associated with higher risk of adverse maternal and
infant outcomes.
