ABSTRACT
Background Sexual minorities suffer worse mental health than the sexual majority but little is known about differences in mental health within
sexual minorities. We aimed to describe inequality in mental health indicators among gay and bisexual men.
Methods Using multi-channel community-based opportunistic sampling we recruited 5799 eligible men aged 16 years and over, living in
England, Scotland and Wales and who were sexually attracted to other men, to a self-completion Internet health survey. Mental health indicators
(depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), suicide attempt and self-harm) were examined for independent associations across common axes of
inequality (age, ethnicity, migrancy, education, income, cohabitation and living in London).
Results Mental ill-health was common: 21.3% were depressed and 17.1% anxious, while 3.0% had experienced attempted suicide and 6.5%
had self-harmed within the last 12 months. All four indicators were associated with younger age, lower education and lower income. Depression
was also associated with being a member of visible ethnic minorities and sexual attraction to women as well as men. Cohabiting with a male
partner and living in London were protective of mental health.
Conclusion Community interventions to increase mental health among gay and bisexual men should be designed to disproportionately benefit
younger men and those living on lower incomes.

Introduction
Mental well-being is a central component of the World Health
Organization’s definition of health and poor mental health
is a common source of human misery.1 Mental health is
a complex multi-faceted construct with affective, cognitive
and behavioural components that are both inter- and intra-
personal. Poor mental health is structurally patterned and
group membership has been shown to increase the risk of
poor mental health across a number of social axes.
In terms of sexuality, minorities are at higher risk of
poor mental health than the heterosexual majority.2,3 For
example, the 2007 UK Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey
(APMS), using a nationally representative sample of private
household residents, found much higher prevalence of
depression, anxiety and suicide attempts among the non-
heterosexual minority.4 Less data are available about mental
health differences within sexual minorities. Minorities are
routinely thought as more homogenous than they actually are
(a phenomena known as the out-group homogeneity bias5).
However, it is obvious that sexual minorities are diverse in
terms of the characteristics across which the incidence of
mental health problems are known to vary, such as gender,6
age,7 ethnicity,8 relationship status9 and financial status.10 This
paper considers whether these mental health inequalities are
replicated among sexual minority men.

 Establishing the epidemiology of mental ill-health across sexu-
ality groups is challenging predominantly due to sampling issues.
Large representative samples of sexual minorities are theoretically
possible but remain practically unfeasible. There is no sampling
frame for sexual minorities and, as they form a small proportion
of the population, even large representative general population
surveys only recruit a small absolute number of people in sexual
minorities. The majority of population health research with sexual
minorities has therefore used convenience samples, both of the
LGBT community as a whole and of its constituent parts.11
We used a large, community-recruited sample (n ¼ 5799)
of gay and bisexual men to describe variation in mental health
indicators by key demographic criteria known to influence or
mediate mental health.
Methods
Data come from the Stonewall Gay & Bisexual Men’s Health
Survey, a community recruited, anonymous, self-completed
online survey commissioned and supported by Stonewall, a UK
charity promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and (since
2014) trans men and women. Eligibility for the survey were: (i)
identifying as a man; (ii) identifying as gay or bisexual and/or
being sexually attracted to men, and/or having sex with men;
(iii) aged 16 years or over; and (iv) living in England, Wales
or Scotland. The sample was self-selected among people
exposed to recruitment activities. No external incentive was
offered. All participants completed the same set of questions.
Recruitment
In the absence of a sampling frame for gay and bisexual men we
attempted to reduce bias through snowball sampling with mul-
tiple entry points into the population, drawing upon the commu-
nications networks of Stonewall. The survey was promoted to
�500 employers who were members of Stonewall’s Diversity
Champions programme, who between them employ �5 million
people across the public, private and third sectors in England,
Scotland and Wales. Employers in turn promoted the survey to
employees through intranets, and to their own networks of
clients/customers/service-users via social media. A request to
participate in and promote the survey was sent to Stonewall
email lists of gay community leaders and professional networks.
The survey was repeatedly promoted throughout the 6-month
period via social media: Stonewall’s Facebook page (�20 000
friends) and Twitter account (�10 000 followers). The offices of
Stonewall Scotland and Stonewall Wales promoted the survey via
social media (�2000 friends/followers between them). Several
gay celebrities and businesses tweeted and posted links to their
followers. The survey was promoted to Stonewall’s education
campaign contacts (�2000 people), including contacts at
schools, universities and local authorities who in turn promoted
to their contacts, networks and mailing lists. Finally, a small
amount of paid advertising was undertaken for a period of
4 weeks on a gay community news and dating website (Gaydar.
co.uk). Surveys could be submitted between April and October
2011. The final question asked ‘Have you filled in this survey
already?’ Affirmative cases were excluded.
Measures
Demographic and lifestyle variables were coded into discrete
categories. Age was coded in four groups of approximate
equal sized (16–25; 26–35; 36–45; .45). Ethnicity was
coded as ‘white’, ‘black’, ‘Asian’ and ‘other ethnicity’. Migrant
status was coded by whether or not respondents were born
outside the UK. Education was coded in three groups:
General Certificate of Education (GCSE) or less; post-GCSE
qualifications but not degree; university degree. Personal
income was coded into five bands giving similar sized groups.
Household captured cohabitees (alone; male partner; others
but not male partner). We distinguished living in London
versus living elsewhere in Great Britain. Men who were sexually
attracted only to men were distinguished from those who were
also attracted to women (either sometimes, equally or mostly).
We included four common measures of population health
drawn from existing UK surveys. All outcomes were coded as
binary variables. Depression was measured using the PHQ-9
(Patient Health Questionnaire 9), a nine-item severity measure
scoring from 0 to 27.12 Respondents were coded as ‘not de-
pressed’ (minimal or mild depression, score 0–9) or ‘depressed’
(moderate, moderately severe or severe depression, score 10–27).
Anxiety was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7
(GAD-7), a seven-item severity measure scoring 0 to 21.13
Respondents were coded as ‘not anxious’ (no, minimal or mild
anxiety, score 0–9) or ‘anxious’ (moderate or severe anxiety,
score 9–21). Suicide attempt was measure by asking ‘In the last
year, have you made an attempt to take your life?’ with responses
‘yes’ and ‘no’. Self-harm was measured by asking ‘In the last year,
have you deliberately harmed yourself in any way but not with the
intention of killing yourself ?’ with responses ‘yes’ and ‘no’.
Model development
We first described missingness in the data, and used cross-
tabulation and logistic regression to explore unadjusted trends
between each demographic and lifestyle variable and the
outcomes. Associations were described as odds ratios, with
strength of association measured by effect size (P-value from
a likelihood ratio test).
The associations under investigation were liable to con-
founding by multiple factors. When addressing multiple con-
founders simultaneously there is a risk of over-adjustment

 when some variables sit on the causal path between other vari-
ables and the outcome.14 It is plausible that adjusting for prox-
imal factors will over fit a model for less proximal factors. In
order to select appropriate potential confounders, and to make
explicit our assumptions about the causal connections between
the demographic variables, we drew a directed acyclical graph,
or DAG15 (see Fig. 1) using DAGitty software.16
The arrows represent assumed causal links. Education and
migration status are both ‘past’ and therefore have been placed
higher in the causal pathways; ethnicity is considered condi-
tional on being in the study and therefore migrant status was
assumed to be causally upstream. All of these variables are
also thought to have a causal relationship with the outcomes,
which is not shown in the diagram. We used the DAGitty soft-
ware (http://www.dagitty.net/) to identify minimal sufficient
adjustment sets of potential confounders. These confounders
were used in logistic regression. By identifying confounders in
this way, as opposed to including potential confounders on
the basis of association with the exposure of interest and the
outcome, or simply including all other variables, we aimed to
avoid over-fitting the model with variables on the causal
pathway in the adjusted models.17 As a result, each of the
associations between the variables and the outcomes was
adjusted for by a different set of potential confounders.
Results
After ineligibility exclusions, there were 5799 valid survey sub-
missions. Of these, 383 were missing the depression measure,
243 missing anxiety, 60 missing suicide attempt and 48
missing self-harm. Age and residence were inclusion criteria
and were missing no data. Missing data for ethnicity, educa-
tion, migrant status, income, household situation and attrac-
tion to women did not exceed 1.5% and did not appear to be
differentiated by the outcome. The characteristics of the
sample, the prevalence and odds of poor mental health and
results of the logistic regression are displayed in Table 1.
The median age was 32 years and the majority (78%) were
under 45 years of age, most were of white ethnicity (94%),
and more than half had a degree-level education (58%). There
was a small proportion of migrants (14%) and a broad distri-
bution of incomes. Approximately equal numbers reported
living alone, living with a male partner, or living with others
(but not a male partner). Over a third lived in London.
Overall 21.3% were depressed and 17.1% anxious. Far fewer
had attempted suicide (3.0%) but a sizable minority (6.5%)
had self-harmed in the last year.
All four negative outcomes became less likely with increas-
ing age. The odds of men aged under 26 years suffering poor
mental health were between 2 times (depression and anxiety)
and 7 times (suicide attempt and self-harm) higher than for
men aged 45 years and over.
In the adjusted models, associations with ethnicity were ad-
justed by age, geography and migrant status; education was ad-
justed by age, ethnicity and living in London; income was
adjusted by age, ethnicity, education, migrant status and living
in London; household was adjusted by age, ethnicity, educa-
tion, migrant status and living in London; migrant status was
adjusted by age; and the associations with living in London
were adjusted for age and migrant status.

 Men with lower incomes, who were often younger, were
more likely to be depressed, anxious, attempt suicide or self-
harm. Men in the lowest income bracket had between 2 and 3
times the odds of these outcomes relative to men in the
highest bracket. Men with lower levels of education had ap-
proximately twice the odds of these outcomes relative to
those with degree-level education, and this was only moder-
ately due to corresponding lower incomes.
Both Black and Asian men had higher odds of depression,
and Black men also had higher odds of suicide attempt than
the white majority. Migrants were less likely to report suicide
attempt or self-harm.
Living with a male partner was associated with half the
odds of depression, three quarters the odds of anxiety, a third
the odds of suicide attempt and two fifths the odds of self-
harm relative to men living alone. Living with someone other
than a male partner was not associated with protective effects.
Living in London was associated with lower odds of de-
pression, suicide attempt and self-harm but this appears to be
due to differences in income.
Sexual attraction to women as well as men was associated
with higher odds of depression and of self-harm.
Discussion
Main finding of this study
We carried out a large community-based survey of depression,
anxiety, self-harm and suicide attempts among gay and bis-
exual men in England, Scotland and Wales. Mental health
problems were relatively common and we identified signifi-
cant and independent inequalities, particularly with regard to
income, age and household. In addition to an overall mental
health inequality between the sexual majority and sexual
minorities, other common inequalities persist within sexual
minorities.
What is already known on this topic
This is the first report of mental health differences within
gay and bisexual men in the UK. Other studies have
demonstrated that sexual minorities are at greater risk of
poor mental health than sexual majorities.2–4 The dominant
account for the population level association between sexual
minority status and poor health outcomes is Meyer’s minority
stress theory.18 Meyer suggests that it is the daily experience of
being oppressed that is detrimental to people’s physical and
mental well-being.
Much less is known about within group differences in
mental health among gay and bisexual men. Associations with
education, income and household have not been studied in

In the adjusted models, associations with ethnicity were adjusted by age, geography and migrant status; education was adjusted by age, ethnicity and living in London; income was adjusted by age, ethnicity, education, migrant status
and living in London; household was adjusted by age, ethnicity, education, migrant status and living in London; migrant status was adjusted by age; living in London was adjusted by age and migrant status; and being attracted to
women was adjusted by age, ethnicity, education, migrant status, living in London and income.

MENTAL HEALTH INEQUALITIES AMONG GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN

 this population.19 Meyer et al.’s 2004–05 data from LGBT
people in the USA suggested that anxiety and mood disorders
were significantly more common among White LGBT people
than Black LGBT people, and more common among older
rather than younger cohorts.20 This dual gender study was
much smaller (n ¼ 388) than the current study.
What this study adds
While gay and bisexual men in all demographic groups experi-
ence poor mental health, other group memberships influence
its likelihood and social gradients are not of equal size. In con-
trast to Meyer et al.’s study,20 our data suggest that young gay
and bisexual men are significantly greater risk of poor mental
health than older men on every indicator, with very high
levels of depression (29%), anxiety (24%), suicide attempts
(6%) and self-harm (14%). This finding is congruent with
homophobic abuse and assault being very disproportionately
experienced by the young.21 Age is fortunately the one charac-
teristic on which LGBT services have been targeted and there
is a network of social support interventions for young LGBT
people in the UK.22 Our data suggest that these services are
insufficient and that the mental health impact on LGBT
young people should be considered in national policy
decisions.
Higher education and higher income were independently
associated with lower levels of mental health problems. These
patterns reflect the importance of both literacy and material
circumstances in determining mental states.23 Conversely,
men on lower incomes were at significantly higher risk in rela-
tion to every indicator of poor mental health, independently
of age and education. To ensure this group are not failed by
policy and practice, poverty discourse must include discussion
of sexuality and LGBT movements must attend to poverty.
Living with a male partner has a large protective effect on
mental health. The same effect was not observed from living
with other people. Marriage has been shown to confer health
benefits, especially to men, through companionship and
psycho-social support that provide a buffer to emotional dis-
tress and illness.9 Our findings suggest that these benefits
extend to co-habiting male couples. The finding that men
who are attracted to women as well as men are at greater risk
of poor mental health than are men attracted only to men
reflect the same inequality found among sexual minority
women, and reinforce the need for bisexual visibility in
LGBT services.11
Three possible non-exclusive explanations for the varia-
tions in mental health among gay and bisexual men suggest
themselves. First, that homophobia is unequally experien-
ced across the population of gay and bisexual men, being
more prevalent in the lives of younger, poorer and/or less
well-educated men, and those from minority ethnic groups
(i.e. different levels of homophobic discrimination result in
mental health inequalities). Secondly, men are better able to
resist the impact of homophobia if they are relatively privi-
leged in other areas of their lives (i.e. different levels of resili-
ence to homophobia result in mental health inequalities).24
Thirdly, that whatever the levels and effects of sexual minority
stress, gay and bisexual men also experience discrimination or
marginalization other than that related to their sexuality (i.e.
different experiences of poverty, racism and other social hier-
archies result in mental health inequalities among gay and bi-
sexual men). Future research could investigate the relative
contribution of these three potential processes.
Limitations of this study
Our findings are limited through the self-selecting nature of
the sample and the imprecision involved in self-completion
of short measures of mental health states. We were unable
to measure response rate and the representativeness of the
sample is unknown. Despite controlling for confounders,
there will be residual confounding from unmeasured factors.
