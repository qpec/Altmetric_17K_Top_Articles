Childhood adversity and risk of suicide: cohort study of 548 721 
adolescents and young adults in Sweden
Charlotte Björkenstam,1,2,3 Kyriaki Kosidou,4,5 Emma Björkenstam6,7 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To examine the relation between childhood adversity, 
the role of school performance, and childhood 
psychopathology and the risk of suicide.
Design
Cohort study of register based indicators of childhood 
adversity (at ages 0-14) including death in the family 
(suicide analysed separately), parental substance 
abuse, parental psychiatric disorder, substantial 
parental criminality, parental separation/single parent 
household, receipt of public assistance, and 
residential instability.
setting
Swedish medical birth register and various Swedish 
population based registers.
PartiCiPants
548 721 individuals born 1987-91.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Estimates of suicide risk at ages 15-24 calculated as 
incidence rate ratios adjusted for time at risk and 
confounders.
results
Adjusted incidence rate ratios for the relation between 
childhood adversity and suicide during adolescence 
and young adulthood ranged from 1.6 (95% confidence 
interval 1.1 to 2.4) for residential instability to 2.9 (1.4 
to 5.9) for suicide in the family. There was a dose-
response relation between accumulating childhood 
adversity and risk: 1.1 (0.9 to 1.4) for those exposed to 
one adversity and 1.9 (1.4 to 2.5) and 2.6 (1.9 to 3.4) for 
those exposed to two and three or more adversities, 
respectively. The association with increased risk of 
suicide remained even after adjustment for school 
performance and childhood psychopathology.
COnClusiOn
Childhood adversity is a risk factor for suicide in 
adolescence and young adulthood, particularly 
accumulated adversity. These results emphasise the 
importance of understanding the social mechanisms 
of suicide and the need for effective interventions 
early in life, aiming to alleviate the risk in 
disadvantaged children.
Introduction
Despite the overall decline in suicide rates in Western 
countries during the past decades, there has not been a 
similar decline among adolescents and young adults.1 
2 
 
Suicide in young people is increasing1 
3  and is ranked as 
one of the leading causes of death in those aged 15-29.1-4 
 
Identification of the most likely risk factors for suicide 
early in life has important implications for future public 
health interventions.1 
2 
5
Established risk factors for suicide attempts and sui-
cidal ideation during adolescence and young adulthood 
include childhood adversities, such as abuse and 
neglect6 7  and growing up in a dysfunctional house-
hold.1 8  Childhood adversity is usually denoted by a 
range of indicators, such as parental separation or 
divorce, death in the family, substance abuse and crimi-
nality in the home, childhood poverty, residential insta-
bility, and parental psychopathology.9  Few previous 
studies have examined single indicators and suicide risk 
among adolescents and young adults.8 
10-12  Furthermore, 
they have used small samples, ranging from 113 to 15 117 
participants and have not focused specifically on child-
hood adversity.8 
10-12  For example, young people who die 
by suicide are more likely to come from non-intact fami-
lies (such as families where both biological parents are 
not present) although parental psychopathology is 
likely to confound this association.13  Other studies have 
found that parental psychopathology, including depres-
sion and substance abuse and antisocial behaviour, is 
associated with increased risk for suicide in adoles-
cence.11  Several studies have also found loss of a parent, 
either to death or divorce, to be a significant risk factor 
for later suicide.10 
14
Indicators of childhood adversity tend to occur in 
clusters, rather than as single events,9 
15 
16  and are often 
inter-related. It has previously been shown that clus-
tered indicators have a strong positive relation to suicide 
ideation and attempts in young adulthood.6 7 17-20  We 
recently showed that exposure to childhood adversity 
was positively associated with the risk for intentional 
self harm in young adulthood,21  and the risk increased 
stepwise by number of accumulating indicators. We also 
found that childhood psychopathology and poor school 
performance were associated with increased risks for 
self harm among individuals exposed to childhood 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Exposure to adversity in childhood increases the risk for self harm in adolescence 
and young adulthood, and the risk of self harm is particularly increased in young 
people exposed to cumulative adversities
Whether childhood adversity is associated with an increased risk for death by 
suicide is less clear
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Exposure to various common childhood adversities, such as parental psychiatric 
disorder, parental substance abuse, death in the family, and receipt of public 
assistance, is associated with a substantially increased risk of suicide in 
adolescence and young adulthood
The risk is clearly increased in young people exposed to cumulative adversities
These results emphasise the importance of understanding the social mechanisms 
of suicide and the need for effective interventions early in life aimed at alleviating 
the suicide risk in disadvantaged children

adversity, though adversity increased the risk for self 
harm independently of these factors.21
Other studies have shown that adults aged 18-69 who 
were exposed to cumulative indicators of childhood 
adversity have an increased risk for premature death in 
general.22 
23 No previous study, however, has examined 
the association between cumulative exposure to child-
hood adversity and death by suicide in adolescence and 
young adulthood.
We capitalised on Sweden’s extensive and high quality 
nationwide registers to investigate the differential associ-
ations between a set of indicators for childhood adversity 
and the risk of suicide in late adolescence and young 
adulthood up to age 24. We also examined whether the 
association between cumulative exposure to childhood 
adversity and suicide could be explained by childhood 
psychopathology. Given the fact that poor school perfor-
mance is associated with childhood  
adversity24-26  and is 
a risk indicator for suicide,27 we also investigated 
whether it could contribute to any association.
Methods
study population
The study population was defined as all individuals 
born in Sweden and recorded in the medical birth regis-
ter in 1987-91 (n=571 797). This high quality register 
includes data on all deliveries in Sweden since 1973.28 
After we excluded those who died before age 15 
(n=4457), those who emigrated before age 15 (n=18 345), 
and those who were adopted (n=274), our final cohort 
comprised 548 721 individuals.
We used the unique Swedish personal identity num-
ber29 to link information from several population based 
registers:
• The causes of death register comprises information 
on all deaths of Swedish residents since 1952 with 
causes of death coded according to ICD (international 
classification of diseases)
• The national patient register includes all individuals 
admitted to psychiatric or general hospitals, with 
complete coverage for all inpatient care since 1987 
and for specialised outpatient care since 200130
• The total enumeration income survey contains data on 
income and governmental benefits provided to all Swed-
ish residents. The total population register includes 
information on age, sex, and place of  
residency31
• The longitudinal integration database for health 
insurance and labour market studies contains data 
from the labour market and from the educational and 
social sectors
• The register of court convictions holds information 
on all court convictions in Sweden for people aged 15 
and older
• The national school register holds information on 
individual school performance (grade points by 
 
subject) for all students from the final ninth year in 
primary schools (when students are aged 15-16) since 
1988. Private schools, which comprise just a small 
proportion of all Swedish schools, have been 
included since 1993. The quality of the data in the 
school register is high.32 Missing data are mostly 
because of lack of reporting from certain private 
schools. Not being registered in the school register 
could also be an indication that the person did her/
his compulsory schooling in special education 
because of cognitive difficulties.
indicators of childhood adversity
We selected indicators of childhood adversity based on 
previous research showing them to have significant 
adverse health implications.9 33-39 We included seven 
indicators occurring between birth and age 14:
• Death in family (suicide was analysed separately): 
death of a parent or a sibling
• Parental substance abuse (severe, as we capture only 
inpatient care): at least one parent admitted to hospital 
with a main diagnosis for substance abuse (ICD-9: 
 
291-292, 303-3050, 3570, 4255, 5353, 5710, 5711-5713, 
6483, 6555, 9650, 9696-9697; ICD-10: E244, F10-F16, 
 
F18-F19, G312, G621, G721, I426, K292, K70, K852, K86, 
O354-355, P044, T40, T436, T51, Z502-503, Z714, Z721-Z722)
• Parental psychiatric disorder (severe, as we capture 
only inpatient care): admission of parent to hospital 
for psychiatric disorder (excluding disorders related 
to substance abuse) (ICD-9: 290-319; ICD-10: F00-F99)
• Parental criminality: a parent sentenced to prison, 
probation, or forensic psychiatric care
• Parental separation/single parent household: either 
having parents separated or living in a single parent 
household, or both
• Household receiving public assistance: at least one 
parent having received public assistance during at 
least one year
• Residential instability: two or more changes in place 
of residence.
By relying solely on register data, there were indicators 
of childhood adversity that we were not able to study, 
including abuse and neglect.
suicide
The study participants were prospectively followed from 
age 15 with respect to suicide. Suicide was defined by the 
presence of ICD-10 codes X60-X84 or as death with 
undetermined intent (Y10-Y34) as the underlying cause 
of death in the causes of death register. The latter 
reduces spatial and secular trends in detecting and clas-
sifying cases of suicide where intent is indeterminable.40
Covariates
Because of known associations between immigrant sta-
tus (including second generation) and mental health in 
the Swedish population,41  we included information on 
whether the parents of cohort members were born in 
Sweden or not. People from disadvantaged family back-
grounds are more likely to experience childhood adver-
sities than those born in more privileged families.42 
Thus we included parental educational attainment and 
disposable income, measured when the child was aged 
15. Parental educational attainment was classified into 
three categories: ≤9 years, 10-12 years, and ≥13 years.

Disposable income was assessed with the individual-
ised weighted average family income and categorised 
into quarters.
Childhood psychopathology was defined as any inpa-
tient and/or outpatient treatment with a psychiatric 
diagnosis (chapter F in ICD-10) before age 15, recorded 
in the national patient register.
School performance was based on the grade point 
average from the final (ninth) year of compulsory 
school. The average was based on the student’s 16 best 
subjects. The child earned 10-20 points per subject 
passed, yielding a total maximum grade point of 320 
points. Thus, the average spanned from 10 to 20 (maxi-
mum points divided by number of subjects). We catego-
rised it into quarters and added two separate groups for 
those with incomplete grades and those with missing 
grades. Missing values in the national school register 
are not random. Missing refers mainly to those who 
have graduated in another country and to those who, 
because of cognitive difficulties, did not graduate from 
compulsory school.43 Incomplete grades refer to instances 
where the students failed in one or more  
subjects.
We also included sex and year of birth in all analyses.
statistical analysis
The individuals in our cohort were followed from age 15 
(2002-06) until suicide, death from other causes, or to 
31 December 2011—that is, until age 24 at most, depend-
ing on year of birth. We used multivariate Poisson 
regression analyses by aggregating number of years at 
risk and adjusting for potential confounders using a 
stepwise approach. The final multivariate model was 
adjusted for year of birth, sex, foreign born parent, 
parental educational attainment, parental income, 
school grades, and childhood psychopathology. We 
summed the total number of childhood adversities to 
assess accumulation of indicators in separate analyses. 
Three adversities or more were categorised into one 
group (≥3). In these analyses we also used a stepwise 
approach and present the crude and the adjusted mul-
tivariate model, in which we adjusted for year of birth, 
sex, foreign born parent, parental educational attain-
ment, parental income, school grades, and childhood 
psychopathology.
Sensitivity analyses
Parental psychiatric disorder is a proxy for genetic liabil-
ity for psychiatric disorder and could increase the risk of 
other childhood adversities. Thus, in secondary analy-
ses, we excluded parental psychiatric disorder from the 
list of adversities and considered a confounder instead.
All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS v.9.4.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Table 1 shows that 42% of the participants were exposed 
to at least one indicator of childhood adversity. The 
most prevalent indicators were parental separation/sin-
gle parent household (29%) and household receiving 
public assistance (20%). Compared with children with-
out any such experience, those exposed to at least one 
childhood adversity were more likely to perform worse 
in school, experience childhood psychopathology, have 
parents with lower levels of education and income, and 
have parents who were born outside of Sweden.
Table 2 shows the number of participants who had 
experienced the seven different indicators of childhood 
adversity and combinations thereof. Of the 23 145 who had 
experienced parental criminality, 14 959 (64%) had also 
experienced parental substance abuse. Further, of the 
108 754 who had experienced receipt of public  
assistance 
62 245 (57%) had also experienced parental separation.
During follow-up, 431 individuals in the study cohort 
died by suicide (81 (18.8%) were classified as undeter-
mined intent), corresponding to an average suicide rate 
of 10.6 per 100 000 person years (95% confidence inter-
val 9.6 to 11.6) (table 3). Highest suicide rates per 100 000 
person years were found among those exposed to sui-
cide in the family (34.9, 15.1 to 68.8), parental psychiatric 
disorder (27
.8, 20.4 to 36.9), and substantial parental 
criminality (26.6, 20.0 to 34.5). Except for parental sepa-
ration/single parent household, all childhood adversity 
indicators were associated with about twice the suicide 
risk compared with those without experience of child-
hood adversity, spanning from incidence rate ratio of 1.6 
(95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.4) for residential insta-
bility to 2.9 (1.4 to 5.9) for suicide in the family.
We found a dose-response relation between number 
of childhood adversity indicators and risk for suicide. 
The incidence rate ratio was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 
0.9 to 1.4) for one adversity, 1.9 (1.4 to 2.5) for two adver-
sities, and 2.6 (1.9 to 3.4) for three or more, after adjust-
ment for important covariates including childhood 
psychopathology and school performance (table 3).
Experience of childhood psychopathology did not 
entail higher suicide risk compared with those without 
such experience (incidence rate ratio 0.8, 95% confidence 
interval 0.4 to 1.7). Poor school performance, on the other 
hand, was associated with higher suicide risk. Compared 
with those with highest grades, students with lowest 
grades had twice the suicide risk (2.0, 1.4 to 2.8), students 
with incomplete grades had over three times the risk (3.6, 
2.5 to 5.3), and finally students with missing grades had 
over four times the risk (4.5, 2.7 to 7
.3) (table 3).
Last, we performed sensitivity analyses in which we 
excluded parental psychiatric disorder from the list of 
childhood adversities and instead considered it a con-
founder. In these analyses, the association between adver-
sities and suicide remained significant (see appendix).

attempts as well as suicide, the association between 
cumulative exposure to childhood adversity and suicide 
risk has been less clear.1

44 Our study of 548 721 individu-
als confirms that exposure to childhood adversity is asso-
ciated with a substantially increased risk of suicide in 
adolescence and young adulthood and shows that the risk 
grows higher with increasing number of adversities. The 
association between adversity and suicide remained after 
adjustment for parental education and income, school 
performance, and childhood psychopathology. Exposure 
to suicide in the family, parental psychiatric disorder, and 
substantial parental criminality during childhood seem to 
entail greatest risks of later suicide. Moreover, childhood 
adversity seems to be such a strong risk factor for suicide 
in adolescence and young adulthood that it attenuated the 
effect of other known risk factors, such as poor school per-
formance and childhood psychopathology. Childhood 
adversity, especially accumulated, increased the risk of 
suicide independently of these factors in our study.
In line with previous findings,39 
45 
46  suicide in the fam-
ily, parental psychiatric disorder, and parental criminal-
ity were associated with greatest suicide risk. For 
instance a Danish case-control study of 496 young peo-
ple (aged 10-21) who died by suicide found several paren-
tal factors to be associated with an increased risk, such 
as parental suicide or early death, admission to hospital 
for a mental illness, unemployment, and low income.10
Previous studies have found a dose-response relation 
between childhood adversity and suicide attempts and 
between childhood adversity and premature death16 
22—
that is, the higher the number of indicators, the higher the 
risk. We found this to also be true for suicide  
mortality.
Experience of childhood adversity increases the risk 
for disturbed emotional and behavioural self regulation, 
which could increase the risk for an impulsive and 
destructive reaction to stress and adversities in adult-
hood.47  This could, at least partly, explain the relation 
between childhood adversity and suicide risk. Further-
more, shared environment effects such as abuse or 
transmission of psychopathology are other possible 
explanations.48  We have previously shown childhood 
adversity to be associated with an increased risk of self 
harm,21  which in turn is a strong risk factor for sui-
cide.1 
3 
49  We have also shown that young people with 
childhood adversity are more likely to have used 
 
psychiatric services50  compared with those without 
such adversity. This is probably because they have 
higher rates of psychiatric disorders.51 Young people 
exposed to childhood adversity might, nevertheless, be 
less likely to seek medical care when ill compared with 
non-exposed children, which might influence their risk 
of suicide. It is not known how childhood adversity 
might have influenced help seeking behaviour and use 
of psychiatric services among young people in our study.
Exposure to childhood adversity is possibly influ-
enced by genetic factors—for example, those related to 
family history of suicide, parental criminality, psychiat-
ric disorders, and substance abuse among parents—
which could also entail a higher likelihood for suicide 
in exposed children.52 Adjustment for parental 
 
psychiatric disorders, a proxy for children’s genetic

loading for psychiatric disorders, however, attenuated 
but did not explain the associations between childhood 
adversity and suicide. This finding is in favour of a 
social causation hypothesis for the association we 
found between childhood adversity and suicide.
Although childhood adversity was common in our 
cohort, it is important to note that most children (58%) 
did not experience any adversity, and 41% (175/431) of 
suicides during follow-up were in those with no expo-
sure to adversity. Thus, identification of risk factors for 
suicide in young people other than the adversities we 
studied remains a challenge but also an opportunity for 
suicide prevention in the younger age groups. For 
example, factors such as abuse and neglect, bullying, 
mood disorders and substance abuse, physical illness, 
lack of social support, and exposure to peers with

suicidal behaviour might be important targets for 
 
prevention53 but were not studied here.
Furthermore, we found that those with a history of expo-
sure to childhood adversity more often performed worse in 
school and also had a history of childhood psychopathol-
ogy to a greater extent. In the light of previous evidence 
that children from adverse family backgrounds tend to 
show school performance below their potential, based on 
their cognitive capacity,54  programmes aimed at boosting 
school performance and providing social support to disad-
vantaged children could prove one promising pathway for 
improved mental health and suicide prevention. Moreover, 
a chaotic household seems to increase the suicide risk 
among young people, and previous findings have identi-
fied family support as an important intervention target to 
decrease suicide risk among anxious young people.55  Fam-
ily support and involvement in intervention for those at risk 
is another potentially successful pathway.56 Lastly, the fact 
that indicators of childhood adversity often co-occur might 
have important implications for intervention. Prevention of 
single indicators among individuals exposed to several is 
unlikely to have any effects, and universal public health 
policies aiming to reduce social disadvantage and its 
impact on children lives are warranted.
Furthermore, the strong associations we found 
between single childhood adversities and suicide sug-
gest that efforts should also be made to develop selec-
tive interventions that effectively alleviate suicide risk 
in easily identifiable groups at high risk. For example, 
children exposed to family suicide constitute a rela-
tively small subgroup of all children with childhood 
adversity in our study but could be easily identified 
through school, the healthcare system, or social ser-
vices, all of which are potential arenas for evidence 
based preventive interventions.
strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths, including the large 
cohort size, the longitudinal population based design, 
and use of national registers with high completeness and 
validity. Other studies on childhood adversity and mental 
health have often been retrospective and based on self 
reported information, entailing risk for recall bias (for 
example, under-reporting of childhood  
adversity).57 
Despite these strengths, our findings should be inter-
preted in the context of the following limitations. The 
range of indicators of childhood adversity is far from 
exhaustive, and we did not assess the severity, duration, 
or sequencing of any of these indicators. Furthermore, 
several of the indicators capture only the most severe 
cases (parental substance abuse, parental psychiatric dis-
order, substantial parental criminality), which should be 
considered when interpreting the results. Moreover, we 
do not know how adversity might have influenced treat-
ment seeking in young people, which in turn might influ-
ence use of mental health services and eventually the risk 
of  
suicide. By relying solely on register data, there are 
indicators that we were not able to study, including abuse 
and neglect. Both the consistency of our results with 
other studies and the large cohort with high quality data, 
however, lends confidence to the validity of our findings.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provides clear evidence that child-
hood adversities that are common in the general population 
are associated with an increased risk for suicide in adoles-
cents and young adults. The risk is markedly increased in 
young people exposed to cumulative adversities. These 
results emphasise the importance of understanding the 
social mechanisms of mental health morbidity and suicide 
and the need for developing effective interventions, aiming 
to alleviate the risk of suicide in disadvantaged children. 
This should be done in parallel with wider societal efforts to 
reduce the size of social disadvantage.
