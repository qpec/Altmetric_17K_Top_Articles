BACKGROUND
After a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, the long-term risk of stroke 
and other vascular events is not well known. In this follow-up to a report on 1-year 
outcomes from a registry of TIA clinics in 21 countries that enrolled 4789 patients 
with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke from 2009 through 2011, we examined the 5-year 
risk of stroke and vascular events.
METHODS
We evaluated patients who had had a TIA or minor stroke within 7 days before enroll-
ment in the registry. Among 61 sites that participated in the 1-year outcome study, 
we selected 42 sites that had follow-up data on more than 50% of their enrolled 
patients at 5 years. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, acute coronary 
syndrome, or death from cardiovascular causes (whichever occurred first), with an 
emphasis on events that occurred in the second through fifth years. In calculating 
the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome and secondary outcomes (except 
death from any cause), we treated death as a competing risk.
RESULTS
A total of 3847 patients were included in the 5-year follow-up study; the median 
percentage of patients with 5-year follow-up data per center was 92.3% (interquar-
tile range, 83.4 to 97.8). The composite primary outcome occurred in 469 patients 
(estimated cumulative rate, 12.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.8 to 14.1), with 
235 events (50.1%) occurring in the second through fifth years. At 5 years, strokes 
had occurred in 345 patients (estimated cumulative rate, 9.5%; 95% CI, 8.5 to 10.5), 
with 149 of these patients (43.2%) having had a stroke during the second through 
fifth years. Rates of death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, intra-
cranial hemorrhage, and major bleeding were 10.6%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 1.5%, respec-
tively, at 5 years. In multivariable analyses, ipsilateral large-artery atherosclerosis, 
cardioembolism, and a baseline ABCD2 score for the risk of stroke (range, 0 to 7, 
with higher scores indicating greater risk) of 4 or more were each associated with 
an increased risk of subsequent stroke.
CONCLUSIONS
In a follow-up to a 1-year study involving patients who had a TIA or minor stroke, the 
rate of cardiovascular events including stroke in a selected cohort was 6.4% in the first 
year and 6.4% in the second through fifth years. (Funded by AstraZeneca and others.)

Five-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
W
ith urgent diagnosis and man-
agement of transient ischemic attack 
(TIA) and minor ischemic stroke and 
a reduction of risk factors during the past de-
cades, the risk of stroke and other vascular events 
and stroke has been reduced.1-3 In previous reports 
involving patients enrolled in stroke registries 
from specialized centers,2 the score on the ABCD2 
(age, blood pressure, clinical findings, duration of 
symptoms, and presence or absence of diabetes) 
scale (range, 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating 
a greater risk of stroke),4 the presence of a brain 
lesion on cerebral imaging, and atherosclerotic 
disease in a major vessel on the side of the affected 
cerebral hemisphere were significantly associat-
ed with the 1-year risk of another stroke.3 The risk 
of another event increased during the first 10 days, 
then was relatively stable for the remainder of the 
year.3,5-8 There are few studies of the risk of stroke 
beyond 1 year among patients who have had a 
TIA or minor stroke in the modern era of treat-
ment, particularly with the use of thrombolytic 
agents,9-11 and many studies addressing the risk of 
recurrent stroke have been from single centers.
The TIAregistry.org project was designed to 
prospectively enroll patients with a recent TIA or 
minor stroke in order to determine the short-
term (3-month and 1-year)3 and long-term (5-year) 
outcomes. Patients were recruited from 2009 
through 2011, in the era when emergency ser-
vices for TIA and minor stroke had been imple-
mented in the health care systems of many de-
veloped countries. The 1-year follow-up of these 
patients has been reported.3 We report the 5-year 
follow-up from a selected group of centers in this 
registry.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The methods of patient recruitment and evalua-
tion for the TIAregistry.org project have been de-
scribed previously.3 The protocol, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was ap-
proved by local institutional review boards. All 
the patients provided written or oral informed 
consent according to country regulation. All the 
authors vouch for the validity of the data and 
adherence to the protocol.
The study was supported by unrestricted grants 
from AstraZeneca, Sanofi, and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, none of which had any involvement in the 
design or conduct of the study, the analysis or 
interpretation of the data, or the writing of the 
manuscript. SOS–Attaque Cérébrale Association 
(a not-for-profit organization) and the Charles Foix 
Group (an academic research organization for 
clinical trials in stroke at Université Paris-Diderot, 
Sorbonne-Paris Cité) were responsible for the con-
duct of the study.
Study Sites and Population
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 
18 years of age or older and had had a TIA or 
minor stroke within the previous 7 days. All the 
patients were evaluated by stroke specialists. Eli-
gible patients had focal retinal or brain ischemia 
with resolution of symptoms or minor strokes 
and a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 
0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 no dis-
ability, and 6 death) of 0 or 1 when first evalu-
ated by stroke specialists.
Sites in the registry from 21 countries had a 
dedicated system for the care of patients with 
TIA (with care delivered by stroke specialists). 
Each site had a yearly volume of at least 100 pa-
tients with a TIA or minor stroke during the 3 years 
before the inception of the study. The sites in-
cluded emergency departments, stroke units, spe-
cialized day clinics, and outpatient clinics, all of 
which were staffed by stroke specialists and de-
signed to evaluate patients on an urgent basis. Sites 
with follow-up data on more than 50% of their 
enrolled patients at 5 years were selected for the 
analysis in this report, and all reported results 
pertain to this selected cohort. Of the original 
61 sites participating in the 1-year study, 10 had 
5-year follow-up data on 0% of patients, 4 had 
data on 1 to 10%, 1 had data on 16%, 1 had data 
on 32%, and 1 had data on 44% (2 other sites 
enrolled patients but never provided any baseline 
data or follow-up data); the patients in these sites 
are therefore not included in the current report. 
These were academic centers distributed among 
Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Data regarding the patients were collected 
prospectively with the use of a Web-based case-
report form during face-to-face interviews at the 
time of evaluation of the qualifying event (base-
line); at 1, 3, and 12 months after the initial evalu-
ation; and every 12 months thereafter for 5 years. 
If the patient could not be reached for follow-up, 
a relative or the family doctor was interviewed by 
telephone. At baseline, patients were evaluated

for clinical symptoms, medical history, and 
socioeconomic factors; a physical examination 
was performed; and investigations (including 
brain and cerebral-artery imaging and cardiac 
evaluation) were recommended. Decisions re-
garding medical treatment and endovascular 
revascularization procedures were made by the 
stroke specialist on the basis of the findings. 
Patients were evaluated at follow-up for clinical 
events, medical treatment, and cardiovascular 
risk factors.
Clinical Events and Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of death 
from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal stroke (either 
ischemic or hemorrhagic), or nonfatal acute coro-
nary syndrome (myocardial infarction with or 
without ST-segment elevation or unstable angina 
followed by urgent catheterization), whichever 
occurred first. Recurrent TIAs were not included 
in the primary outcome. Any cardiovascular event 
after the qualifying event (i.e., after the patient 
first sought medical attention), even if the event 
occurred before evaluation by a stroke specialist, 
was considered to be an outcome event. Second-
ary outcomes included individual components of 
the primary outcome, TIA recurrence, death from 
any cause, any bleeding in the brain or elsewhere 
in the body, and the modified Rankin score at 
last follow-up.
Ischemic stroke was defined as one of the fol-
lowing: a new symptomatic neurologic deteriora-
tion lasting at least 24 hours that was not at-
tributable to a nonischemic cause, or a new 
symptomatic neurologic deterioration that was 
not attributable to a nonischemic cause and was 
accompanied by neuroimaging evidence of a 
new brain infarction. Hemorrhagic stroke was 
defined as acute extravasation of blood into the 
brain parenchyma. Death from cardiovascular 
causes included fatal acute coronary syndrome, 
fatal stroke, fatal intracranial hemorrhage, fatal 
pulmonary embolism, sudden death, and unob-
served or unexpected death within 30 days. TIA 
was defined as new neurologic symptoms or 
deficit lasting less than 24 hours with no new 
infarction on neuroimaging. Bleeding was cate-
gorized as severe or life-threatening, moderate, 
or mild according to the Global Utilization of 
Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Factor for 
Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definitions.12 
Primary outcome events and all bleeding events 
were adjudicated by two of the investigators on the 
basis of clinical records.
Statistical Analysis
We initially calculated that a sample size of 5000 
would allow a 10% relative precision in the esti-
mate of the rate of the primary outcome after a 
maximum follow-up of 5 years (corresponding to 
an accrual time of 4 years and a minimal follow-
up period of 1 year), assuming an average an-
nual risk of composite events of 2.5%. Because 
we intended to follow all the patients for 5 years 
and to perform a short-term analysis at the 1-year 
follow-up, we used the Peto method for calculat-
ing the standard error of survival at the given 
time to determine that with a 25% attrition rate 
at 5 years, the relative precision of the estimates of 
the composite event rate would be 18% at 1 year 
and 9% at 5 years.
Continuous variables are expressed as means 
and standard deviations or medians and interquar-
tile ranges, and categorical variables are expressed 
as frequencies and percentages. To assess the rep-
resentativeness of the study sample from the ini-
tial sample, we described the main baseline 
characteristics of the patients who were included 
in the sample and those who were not included. 
The magnitude of the between-group differences 
was assessed by calculating the standardized dif-
ferences, and an absolute standardized difference 
of more than 0.20 was interpreted as a meaning-
ful difference. We calculated the length of follow-
up on the basis of the reverse Kaplan–Meier es-
timator13 of overall survival.
In the analysis of the cumulative incidence of 
the primary outcome and secondary outcomes 
(except death from any cause), we used the ap-
proach of Kalbfleisch and Prentice by treating 
death as a competing risk.14 The probability of the 
rate of death from any cause was estimated by the 
Kaplan–Meier method. Data for patients with no 
information at 5 years were censored at the time 
of the last available follow-up. Events that oc-
curred after the 5-year follow-up period were not 
included in this analysis. Event rates were esti-
mated among the overall study sample (main 
analysis), among patients evaluated by a stroke 
specialist within 24 hours after symptom onset 
(prespecified sensitivity analysis), and among 
patients from the 33 sites with follow-up data on

Five-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
more than 80% of their patients at 5 years (post 
hoc sensitivity analysis).
The ABCD2 score, acute infarctions on brain 
imaging, and the probable cause of the initial 
TIA or minor stroke according to the Trial of 
Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) 
classification have been shown to be associated 
with stroke recurrence. Thus, we used a Fine–
Gray model14 to assess the prognostic values of 
these factors on stroke recurrence from a 1-year 
period to a 5-year period, using a landmark analy-
sis at 1 year for these prognostic factors. The 
proportional-hazards assumption was verified 
with the use of Schoenfeld residuals. Owing to 
missing data on the ABCD2 score, acute infarc-
tion lesions, and TOAST classification, we per-
formed a multivariable analysis with multiple 
imputation of missing values by means of chained 
equations (10 imputations; see the Methods sec-
tion in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org, for further details). A sensitivity analy-
sis was performed on complete case data (Fig. S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical testing was conducted at a two-
tailed alpha level of 0.01 to account for multiple 
comparisons. Data were analyzed with the use 
of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
Baseline Data and Selection of Patients
From June 2009 through December 2011, a total 
of 61 sites in 21 countries enrolled 4789 patients 
in the TIAregistry.org project. Of the 61 sites, 42 
had follow-up data on more than 50% of their 
patients at 5 years (3847 patients), who repre-
sented 80.3% of the initial cohort (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The median percent-
age of patients with 5-year follow-up data in these 
selected centers was 92.3% (interquartile range, 
83.4 to 97.8), with a total of 3356 patients (87.2%) 
with all data available for analysis in this report.
Follow-up at 5 years was by face-to-face inter-
view in 46.2% of patients and by telephone call 
in 47.5%; the remainder of the patients had died 
or were lost to follow-up (Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Table 1, and Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, show the baseline char-
acteristics and missing data of the cohort who had 
5-year follow-up data. A comparison between the

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
the 736 patients from the initial 1-year cohort 
who were not included in the 5-year analysis is 
shown in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. Patients who were not included in the 5-year 
analysis had lower rates of hypertension, dyslip-
idemia, and current smoking status than those 
who were included, and they had lower scores 
on the modified Rankin scale (signifying less 
disability from the initial strokes), lower scores 
on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(signifying less severe initial strokes), and lower 
ABCD2 scores (signifying better predicted prog-
nosis for recurrence of stroke).
Treatment Management during Follow-up
Rates of medication use at hospital discharge 
after the first stroke and at 5 years were as fol-
lows: blood-pressure–lowering therapy, 68.7% 
and 70.5%, respectively; lipid-lowering therapy, 
70.5% and 63.9%; glucose-lowering therapy, 18.8% 
and 17.7%; antiplatelet therapy, 90.6% and 71.1%; 
and anticoagulant therapy, 16.2% and 17.0% (Ta-
ble 2). At 5 years, the mean blood pressure was 
132/77 mm Hg, and the mean level of low-den-
sity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 92 mg per 
deciliter (2.38 mmol per liter); the median LDL 
level was 86 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 
69 to 108) (2.22 mmol per liter; interquartile 
range, 1.78 to 2.79) (Figs. S2 and S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Of 835 active smokers (22.0% 
of 3801 patients) at baseline, 388 (10.2%) were 
still active smokers at 1 year and 292 (7.7%) at 
 
5 years.
Outcome Events
At the time of database closure on August 16, 
2017, the median follow-up was 5.01 years (inter-
quartile range, 4.84 to 5.26). At year 5, a primary 
outcome event had occurred in 469 patients 
(death from a cardiovascular cause in 96 patients, 
a nonfatal stroke in 297, and a nonfatal acute 
coronary syndrome in 76), corresponding to an 
estimated cumulative event rate of 12.9% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 11.8 to 14.1) (Table 3). 
A total of 235 of the events (50.1%) occurred 
during years 2 through 5. Absolute event rates

Five-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
were 6.4% in the first year and 6.4% in the sec-
ond through fifth years. Stroke occurred in 345 
patients during the 5-year period (a primary 
outcome event of fatal stroke occurred in 44), 
with 149 of these 345 patients (43.2%) having 
had a stroke during years 2 through 5. At 5 years, 
myocardial infarction had occurred in 39 patients. 
Figure 1 shows that the Kaplan–Meier estimate of 
the probability of primary outcome events con-
tinued to increase after the first year.
Death from any cause occurred in 373 patients 
(estimated rate, 10.6%), any recurrent stroke or 
TIA in 621 (16.8%), any acute coronary syndrome 
in 84 (2.4%), and any major bleeding in 53 (1.5%). 
Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 39 patients 
(1.1%), of whom 15 (38%) were receiving antico-
agulant therapy (representing 3.3% of the 461 
patients receiving anticoagulant therapy), 16 (41%) 
were receiving antiplatelet monotherapy (represent-
ing 0.9% of the 1784 patients receiving antiplate-
let monotherapy), and 5 (13%) were receiving 
dual antiplatelet therapy (representing 3.9% of 
the 127 patients receiving dual antiplatelet ther-
apy). As a post hoc measure of disability caused 
by a recurrent stroke, a combination of the pri-
mary outcome and a modified Rankin score of 
more than 1 (indicating some degree of neuro-
logic disability) occurred in 299 patients, with an 
event rate of 7.9% (95% CI, 7.1 to 8.9) (Table S4 
and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Sensitivity Analysis
In a sensitivity analysis restricted to patients en-
rolled within 24 hours after symptom onset (77.2% 
of the patients in this analysis), a primary out-
come event had occurred in 13.4% of the pa-
tients (95% CI, 12.1 to 14.7) at 5 years (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). A sensitivity 
analysis that was restricted to 33 centers (2897 
patients) with follow-up data on more than 80% 
of their patients at 5 years (median, 95.4%; 95% 
CI, 90.0 to 98.2) showed an event rate of 13.3% 
(95% CI, 12.1 to 14.6) (Table S6 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Among the potential causes 
of qualifying TIA or minor stroke that were consid-
ered in the 1-year report,3 ipsilateral large-artery 
atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, and an ABCD2 
score of 4 or more, but not the presence of a 
brain lesion on neuroimaging, were independent 
predictors of recurrent stroke during years 2 
through 5 (Fig. 2, and Fig. S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).

In the analysis of the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome and sec‑
ondary outcomes (except death from any cause), we used the approach of 
Kalbfleisch and Prentice by treating death as a competing risk.14 The rate of 
death from any cause was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method.
†  
The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, 
nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, whichever occurred 
first. Therefore, a patient could have no more than one primary outcome 
event.
‡  
Patients with multiple events during the 5‑year period may be classified as 
having different secondary outcomes. One patient could have several events: 
31 patients had both a stroke and a TIA; 4 patients had an acute coronary syn‑
drome before a recurrent stroke.
§  
Moderately severe bleeding was defined according to the Global Utilization of 
Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Factor for Occluded Coronary Arteries 
(GUSTO) definition: bleeding that requires transfusion of blood but does not 
lead to hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention.
¶  
Major bleeding was defined according to the GUSTO definition for severe 
bleeding: documented intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding that causes hemo‑
dynamic compromise requiring blood or fluid replacement, inotropic support, 
ventricular assistance devices, surgical intervention (other than vascular site 
repair), or cardiopulmonary resuscitation to maintain a sufficient cardiac 
 
output.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
ing 80% of an initial cohort previously reported 
with 1-year outcomes, there was a risk of a com-
posite outcome of stroke, acute coronary syn-
drome, or death from cardiovascular causes of 
12.9% at 5 years and a risk of stroke of 9.5%, 
approximately twice the rates of 6.2% and 5.1%, 
respectively, reported at 1 year.3 These rates were 
lower than the rates of 22% and 17%, respec-
tively, in historical cohorts before the widespread 
adoption of aggressive risk-reduction measures 
for vascular disease.5,6,15 Half the primary out-
come events in the current report occurred dur-
ing years 2 through 5, which raises the question 
of whether preventive strategies could decrease 
the risk of stroke after a TIA or a minor ischemic 
stroke beyond 1 year. To measure the effect of 
minor stroke on disability, we performed a post 
hoc analysis of the 5-year risk of the primary 
outcome and a modified Rankin score of more 
than 1 (signifying the presence of a neurologic 
deficit), and 7.9% of the patients had a deficit or 
had died. Measures such as this one that include 
the residual effect of strokes may be useful out-
comes in clinical trials. Our study did not include 
TIA as a primary outcome because of ambiguities 
in making this diagnosis at follow-up visits.
Our registry was composed primarily of pa-
tients at moderate-to-high risk for stroke, as more 
than two thirds of the cohort had an ABCD2 score 
of 4 or more at the time of their first stroke (Ta-
ble 1). Among stroke subtypes leading to enroll-
ment in the registry, ipsilateral atherosclerotic ste-
nosis, a cardiac source of embolism (mainly atrial 
fibrillation), and small-vessel disease were predic-
tors of recurrent stroke during years 2 through 5. 
These results are consistent with the finding in 
our 1-year outcome study and other reports that 
atherosclerotic stenosis ipsilateral to the original 
stroke confers the highest risk of recurrence, 
even beyond 1 year.3,15,16 An ABCD2 score of 4 or 
more at baseline was predictive of the risk of 
recurrent stroke during years 2 through 5, where-
as a baseline brain lesion on neuroimaging was 
predictive of the risk of stroke at 1 year3 but not 
during years 2 through 5 (Fig. 2).
Of 3847 patients who were evaluated for the 
5-year study, 3356 (87.2%) had complete 5-year 
follow-up data available. This follow-up rate af-
fects the confidence intervals around point esti-
mates of events and may underestimate the rates

Five-Year Risk of Stroke after TIA or Minor Stroke
of these events. Furthermore, only 10% of the data 
were audited for accuracy at all three time points 
of baseline, 1 year, and 5 years. In addition, there 
were differences in risk factors between the pa-
tients in the initial 1-year cohort and the cohort 
with 5-year outcome data. Although primary 
outcome events and major bleeding events were 
adjudicated, all the limitations named above may 
also have led to underreporting of these events. 
Taken together, and given the specialized nature 
of the sites in the registry, these patients are dif-
ferent from those in population-based studies of 
stroke but may represent patients who would be 
included in clinical trials.
In conclusion, among patients who had had a 
TIA or minor stroke, we observed a sustained risk 
of cardiovascular events over a period of 5 years, 
with half of the events occurring during years 
2 through 5. There may be potential for reducing 
recurrent strokes by ongoing secondary preven-
tion measures.

Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis.
Shown are event rates and multivariate hazard ratios for stroke recurrence according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment 
(TOAST) classification, initial findings on brain imaging, and the score on the ABCD2 (age, blood pressure, clinical findings, duration of 
symptoms, and presence or absence of diabetes) scale (range, 0 to 7, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) after 1 year 
(landmark analysis, 3501 patients) after multiple imputation for missing data. The reference subgroups for the hazard ratios are a TOAST 
classification of ischemic stroke of undetermined cause, no acute infarction on brain imaging, and an ABCD2 score of 0.3. The number 
of patients with stroke recurrence is the cumulative incidence at 5 years after inclusion (4 years after the landmark time), as estimated 
by considering death not caused by stroke as a competing risk. Event rates for stroke recurrence are for years 2 through 5.
