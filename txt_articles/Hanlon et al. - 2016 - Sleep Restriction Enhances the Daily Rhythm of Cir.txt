Study Objectives: Increasing evidence from laboratory and epidemiologic studies indicates that insufficient sleep may be a risk factor for obesity. Sleep 
curtailment results in stimulation of hunger and food intake that exceeds the energy cost of extended wakefulness, suggesting the involvement of reward 
mechanisms. The current study tested the hypothesis that sleep restriction is associated with activation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, a key 
component of hedonic pathways involved in modulating appetite and food intake.
Methods: In a randomized crossover study comparing 4 nights of normal (8.5 h) versus restricted sleep (4.5 h) in healthy young adults, we examined the 
24-h profiles of circulating concentrations of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and its structural analog 2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG). We 
concomitantly assessed hunger, appetite, and food intake under controlled conditions.
Results: A robust daily variation of 2-AG concentrations with a nadir around the middle of the sleep/overnight fast, followed by a continuous increase 
culminating in the early afternoon, was evident under both sleep conditions but sleep restriction resulted in an amplification of this rhythm with delayed and 
extended maximum values. Concentrations of 2-OG followed a similar pattern, but with a lesser amplitude. When sleep deprived, participants reported 
increases in hunger and appetite concomitant with the afternoon elevation of 2-AG concentrations, and were less able to inhibit intake of palatable snacks.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that activation of the eCB system may be involved in excessive food intake in a state of sleep debt and contribute to the 
increased risk of obesity associated with insufficient sleep.

INTRODUCTION
Rates of overweight and obesity have increased rapidly over 
the past three decades.1 Concurrently, average sleep times 
have decreased.2 Polls conducted by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Sleep Founda-
tion (NSF), as well as large-scale epidemiological studies, 
indicate that many Americans experience chronic partial 
sleep restriction because of voluntary bedtime curtailment.3 
A growing body of evidence suggests a link between insuf-
ficient sleep duration and increased risk of obesity. A meta-
analysis of cross-sectional epidemiologic studies including 
more than 600,000 adults from around the world found a 
significant pooled odds ratio for short duration of sleep and 
obesity of 1.55.4 The majority of prospective studies, whether 
in children or adults, found that short sleep predicts greater 
weight gain or the incidence of obesity, after controlling for 
multiple confounders.5–9 Experimental sleep restriction in the 
laboratory (4–6 h/night for multiple nights) has adverse effects 
on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance10–12 and increases 
hunger and food intake.13,14 Further, in a study where caloric 
intake was strictly controlled, plasma concentrations of the 
satiety hormone leptin were suppressed and concentrations of

Significance
Insufficient sleep is a putative risk factor for weight gain. Increases in hunger and food intake in sleep-deprived individuals exceed energy demands of 
extended wakefulness and therefore involve eating for pleasure rather than to fulfill a caloric need. Endocannabinoids are naturally synthesized lipids 
that bind the same receptors as the active ingredient of marijuana. Activation of these receptors promotes hedonic eating. This study shows that under 
normal sleep conditions, blood levels of the most abundant endocannabinoid increase from mid-sleep to early afternoon. After sleep restriction, this 
increase in endocannabinoid level is amplified, coinciding with greater desire for palatable food. The identification of the endocannabinoid system as a 
mediator of increased hunger following sleep curtailment may help develop novel preventive strategies.
the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin were elevated, in as-
sociation with a stimulation of hunger and appetite.15
Recent studies using whole room indirect calorimetry have 
shown that sleep restriction does increase energy need, but 
only modestly.16–18 By comparison, the increased hunger and 
appetite reported by sleep deprived subjects and their in-
creased energy intake in the presence of ad libitum feeding 
appear to exceed the energy demands of extended wakeful-
ness under sedentary conditions.13–15,18,19 These findings sug-
gest a role for alterations in hedonically driven hunger and 
appetite as a result of insufficient sleep. The endocannabi-
noid (eCB) system is involved in the control of feeding, ap-
petite, and energy homeostasis. The eCB system is composed 
of cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, the endogenous 
agonists of these receptors 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) 
and N-arachidonylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), and 
the enzymes required for the biosynthesis and degradation 
of the endogenous lipids. The appetite-enhancing effects of 
cannabinoids appear to be mediated mainly by the CB1 re-
ceptor. Production of 2-AG is more than 100-fold larger than 
that of AEA. The eCBs, measurable in plasma,20 are biosyn-
thesized de novo and bind to CB1 receptors in brain and in

peripheral organs involved in energy metabolism, including 
adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, muscle, and liver.21–24 It 
is well established that eCB-dependent CB1 receptor activa-
tion is a potent orexigenic signal; agonists of CB1 receptors 
stimulate feeding, whereas antagonists result in appetite sup-
pression.21 CB1 receptors are found in homeostatic pathways 
including hypothalamic nuclei known to modulate energy ho-
meostasis via interaction with peripheral peptides (i.e., leptin 
and ghrelin).25,26 Moreover, activation of the eCB system 
affects hedonic (motivation and reward) circuits in the me-
solimbic system, including the nucleus accumbens and ven-
tral tegmental area. Here eCBs interact with dopamine and 
opioid pathways, eliciting a preference for highly palatable 
rewarding food.27–29
There are remarkable parallels between the effects of acti-
vation of the eCB system and the effect of experimental sleep 
restriction. Just as in a state of sleep debt, higher CB1 receptor 
activity increases feeding behavior in excess of energy need, 
reduces glucose tolerance, tends to reduce leptin levels and 
to promote ghrelin release, and stimulates reward and addic-
tion. We therefore hypothesized that sleep restriction activates 
the eCB system and assessed the 24-h profile of circulating 
concentrations of the most abundant eCB, 2-AG, and of its 
structural analog 2-OG, in nonobese healthy individuals who 
participated in a randomized crossover study comparing 4 
days of bedtime restriction to 4.5 h per night to 4 d of 8.5 h 
bedtimes. We have previously reported the existence of a ro-
bust circadian rhythm in circulating eCB concentrations under 
normal sleep conditions.30
METHODS
Participants
Healthy nonobese men and women between the ages of 18 to 
30 y, with a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) less than 28 for 
men and 27 for women and self-reported habitual sleep dura-
tion of 7.5–8.5 h between the hours of 23:00 and 09:00, were 
recruited for participation in this study. Exclusion criteria in-
cluded: irregular sleep schedule, habitual daytime naps, shift 
work, travel across time zones in the past 4 weeks, chronic 
medical condition, acute illness, use of any prescription medi-
cations, use of over-the-counter medications or supplements 
known to affect sleep or glucose metabolism, smoking, mari-
juana usage, excessive alcohol (more than two drinks per day) 
or caffeine (> 300 mg per day) consumption, history of psy-
chiatric disorders, or abnormal findings on medical history, 
physical examination, or routine laboratory testing. All par-
ticipants underwent overnight laboratory polysomnography to 
exclude sleep disorders, as well as a standard 75-g oral glucose 
tolerance test and fasting blood sample collection for routine 
laboratory analyses. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was also ob-
tained. Healthy individuals who had normal glucose tolerance 
and no sleep disorders were included. Individuals were admin-
istered both the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale (CESD; cutoff of > 16 for clinical depression) and the 
Beck Inventory for Depression (cutoff greater than 10). Only 
those with both scores below the cutoff were included. Only 
nonpregnant women were studied, and data collection was 
scheduled during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. 
All research volunteers gave written informed consent and 
were paid for their participation.
Study Protocol
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of the University of Chicago. Each subject was tested under 
two sleep conditions, in randomized order, spaced by at least 
4 weeks as shown in Figure 1. All study procedures took place 
in the University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center. During 
the week preceding each sleep condition, participants were 
instructed to maintain a standardized schedule of bedtimes 
(23:00–07:30) and to not deviate from this schedule by more 
than 30 min. The sleep-wake cycles of the participants were 
continuously monitored by wrist activity (Actiwatch; Philips 
Respironics, Bend, OR) to verify adherence. One condition 
involved 4 consecutive inpatient days with 8.5 h in bed (23:00 
to 07:30, normal sleep, NS), whereas the other condition in-
volved 4 days with 4.5 h in bed (01:00 to 05:30, restricted 
sleep, RS). Each condition was preceded by one night of ac-
climation to the laboratory environment with 8.5 h in bed. 
Study participants were limited to sedentary activities during 
waking hours and were housed in a private room. No naps 
were allowed. In both conditions, irrespective of sleep/wake 
time, only dim light (ceiling lights off, shades closed) was al-
lowed in the subject’s room from wake until 10:30 and again 
from 18:00 until bedtime. Dim light was approximately 75–
100 lux, whereas ceiling lights and open shades were approxi-
mately 550–600 lux (EXTECH Light Meter, Nashua, NH). 
Compliance was monitored continuously by research staff. In 
the afternoon following the second night of each condition, 
an intravenous sterile heparin-lock catheter was inserted in 
a forearm vein. The line was kept patent with a slow drip of 
heparinized saline. Blood sampling was initiated at 21:30 at 
15- to 30-min intervals and continued for 24 h. Cortisol, leptin, 
and ghrelin were assayed on all samples, whereas eCBs were 
assayed at 60-min intervals. During bedtimes, the catheter 
was connected to plastic tubing that extended to an adjacent 
room to sample distally without disturbing the participant. 
Samples were collected at room temperature in tubes that did 
not contain inhibitors. Plasma and serum samples were frozen 
at −80°C until assay.
Controlled Caloric Intake
Caloric intake was identical under both sleep conditions and 
was strictly controlled up to the time when the participants were 
exposed to ad libitum feeding conditions on the day following 
the fourth night of each condition. Caloric content of the diet 
was calculated to meet individual participant’s caloric require-
ments for sedentary conditions.31 A registered dietitian from 
the Clinical Resource Center Metabolic Kitchen supervised 
the preparation of all meals. Participants were not allowed to 
consume any foods or beverages that were not provided by the 
metabolic kitchen. During the 24-h period of blood sampling, 
participants ate three identical carbohydrate-rich meals (20% 
fat, 68% carbohydrate, 12% protein), served at 09:00, 14:00, 
and 19:00. The participants were instructed to consume each 
meal in its entirety within 20 min.

Ad libitum Feeding
After being fasted since dinner (19:00) the previous night, in the 
afternoon following the fourth night of each sleep condition par-
ticipants were presented with an ad libitum buffet of palatable 
foods, tailored to meet the subject’s dietary preferences as deter-
mined during an interview with the dietician prior to the initia-
tion of the study. The same individually customized assortment 
of foods was given during each sleep condition. Participants were 
instructed to eat as much as they wanted over a 1-h period (from 
15:00–16:00) without distraction by staff or investigators. From 
16:00 until 19:30, a snack bar was available in the participant’s 
private room. At 19:30, a second ad libitum buffet was offered for 
dinner, and again participants were instructed to eat as much as 
they wanted over a 1-h period. Meals and snacks were served in 
excess to allow for ad libitum intake. Food was weighed before 
and after each meal and during the snacking period to determine 
actual consumption. The caloric content and macronutrient com-
position of all meals and snacks were calculated using Food Pro-
cessor SQL software (ESHA Research, Salem, OR).
Assessment of Hunger, Appetite, Vigor, and Mood
During the 24-h period of blood sampling when caloric intake 
was limited to three identical meals, the participants completed 
four validated computerized visual analog scales (0 to 10 cm32) 
to assess motivation to eat at six time points: 25 min before and 
1 h 35 min after each meal (at 08:35, 10:35, 13:35, 15:35, 18:35, 
20:35). At each time point, the participants were asked to score 
“How hungry do you feel right now?”, “How strong is your de-
sire to eat right now?”, “How much do you think you could eat 
right now?”, and “How full does your stomach feel right now?”. 
To assess appetite at each time point, participants were asked 
to mark on a 10-cm scale how much they would enjoy eating 
foods from seven different categories (with “not at all” on the 
left and “very much” on the right) without regard to caloric 
content, fat content, or a healthy diet.33 A global appetite score 
was calculated at each time point as the sum of the seven scores 
(scale: 0–70 cm). Subjective alertness was assessed using the 
Visual Analog Scale for Global Vigor and Mood,34 which com-
bines the scores on four 10-cm scales (alert, sleepy, weary, and 
effort) to obtain a Global Vigor score between 0 and 40 cm and 
the scores on four 10-cm scales (happy, sad, calm, tense) to 
obtain a Global Mood score between 0 and 40 cm. Data were 
then divided by 4 to obtain a rating between 0–10.
Sleep Recording
Sleep was recorded by polysomnography (Neurofax EEG-1100A, 
Nihon Kohden, Foothill Ranch, CA) each night. The recordings 
were visually scored in 30-sec epochs as wake, rapid eye move-
ment (REM) sleep, or nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep 
stages N1, N2, and N3 according to standardized criteria.35 The 
following summary variables were calculated: sleep period time 
(SP, i.e., time interval separating sleep onset from morning awak-
ening), total sleep time (i.e. SP − duration of intrasleep wake pe-
riods), sleep efficiency (i.e. total sleep time / time in bed * 100), 
duration of REM sleep, duration of light NREM sleep (i.e. stages 
N1+N2), and duration of deep NREM sleep (i.e., stage N3).
Assays

of the CB1 and CB2 receptors and its structural analog 
Figure 1—The protocol followed a randomized crossover design with two 5-night in-laboratory sessions spaced by at least 1 month. Each session included 
one habituation night, followed by 4 experimental nights with either 4.5 (RS1-RS4, red bars) or 8.5 (NS1-NS4, black bars) h/night in bed. Over the third 
experimental night beginning at 21:00, 24-h blood sampling was initiated to examine circulating endocannabinoid, cortisol, leptin, and ghrelin levels (dashed 
lines). Throughout the following day, identical carbohydrate-rich meals were served at 09:00, 14:00, and 19:00 (denoted by black arrows). Questionnaires 
to assess hunger, appetite, vigor, and affect were administered at 08:35, 10:35, 13:35, 15:35, 18:35, and 20:35 (denoted by v). In the afternoon following the 
fourth experimental night, participants were exposed to an ad libitum (ad lib) buffet for lunch at 15:00 and dinner at 19:30 (denoted by open arrows), with a 
snack period between the meal opportunities (graded line).

656 Serum Endocannabinoid 2-AG and Restricted Sleep—Hanlon et al.
2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG) were extracted from serum using 
Bond Elut C18 solid phase extraction columns (Varian Inc, 
Lake Forest, CA), as previously described.36 The two lipids 
were quantified in the lipid extracts by liquid chromatography-
electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS; Ag-
ilent LC-MSD 1100 series, Ramsey, MN) and quantified by 
isotope dilution as described previously.37
Serum cortisol levels were measured by an immunochemi-
luminescent assay (Immulite, Los Angeles, CA). Serum leptin 
and total ghrelin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay 
(Linco Research, St. Charles, MO).
Analysis of Individual Profiles of Serum Concentrations of 
2-AG, 2-OG, Cortisol, Leptin, and Ghrelin
Isolated 2-AG values that represented a relative change of more 
than 100% in comparison with both the preceding and fol-
lowing values and were not concomitant with a similar change 
in 2-OG level were assumed to represent assay error and were 
replaced by linear interpolation. Similar criteria were used to 
identify aberrant 2-OG values. In the current study, for both 
2-AG and 2-OG, a total of 672 values were measured. Fifteen 
values (2.2%) were interpolated for 2-AG and 14 values (2.1%) 
were interpolated for 2-OG. A total of 1,932 values were mea-
sured for each leptin, ghrelin, and cortisol. No values were 
interpolated for ghrelin or cortisol, whereas 14 (0.7%) were 
interpolated for leptin.
To quantify the 24-h profiles of serum levels of 2-AG, 2-OG, 
cortisol, and leptin, a best-fit curve was calculated for each 
individual profile using a robust locally weighted nonlinear re-
gression procedure with a window of 2 h for 2-AG and 2-OG 
and 4 h for cortisol and leptin.38 The peak and the nadir were 
defined as the maximum and minimum of the regression curve, 
respectively. The amplitude was defined as half of the differ-
ence between the peak and the nadir.
The 24-h variations of ghrelin levels were quantified as 
previously described.39 To quantify the nocturnal ghrelin el-
evation, the profiles were smoothed using a four-point moving 
average and the amplitude of the nocturnal rise was calculated 
as the difference between the nadir following the evening meal 
and the maximum level attained between 23:00 and 05:00.
Statistical Analysis
All group values are expressed as mean ± standard error of the 
mean (SEM). Mean values comparing the normal sleep and 
restricted sleep conditions were tested with a t-test. Analysis of 
variance for repeated measures was used to compare variables 
measured during normal sleep (NS) and restricted sleep (RS). 
The order of the condition (i.e., NS condition first versus RS 
condition first) was introduced as covariate in the analysis of 
hormonal responses, hunger, appetite, vigor, affect, and food 
intake under ad libitum conditions. Correlations were calcu-
lated using the Pearson coefficient.
RESULTS
The protocol is depicted in Figure 1. There are no previous re-
ports on the effect of sleep duration on endocannabinoid levels, 
and therefore, the sample size of this randomized crossover 
study could not be estimated using existing data. Instead, we 
relied on the experience accumulated in eight previous studies 
of experimental sleep restriction conducted in the controlled 
environment of the University of Chicago Clinical Resource 
Center10,11,14,40–44 that all demonstrated a robust effect of insuf-
ficient sleep on hormones and metabolism in healthy humans. 
The median sample size in these eight previous studies was 11 
and we conservatively selected a sample size of 15 participants. 
One participant dropped out after completing one arm of the 
study, due to personal reasons.
Fourteen individuals, 11 men and 3 women, with a mean age 
of 23.4 ± 0.8 y and a mean BMI of 23.9 ± 0.7 kg/m2 participated 
in this study. Six of the 14 participants were tested under the 
NS condition first, and the remaining eight participants began 
with the RS condition. When measured prior to the first ex-
perimental night of each sleep condition, body weight (NS1: 
74.7 ± 2.8 kg versus RS1: 74.6 ± 2.8 kg) and percentage body 
fat (NS1: 23.8 ± 2.0 % vs. RS1: 23.9 ± 2.2 %) were similar. 
Body weight did not change within either experimental ses-
sion, from the evening prior to the first experimental night to 
the morning following the fourth experimental night (change 
from NS1 to NS5: - 0.03 kg, P = 0.92; change from RS1 to RS5: 
−0.26 kg, P = 0.197).
Sleep Duration and Sleep Stages
As shown in Table 1, during the NS condition participants slept 
on average 453 min/night whereas during the RS condition 
they slept on average 251 min/night (P < 0.0001). As expected, 
sleep efficiency was higher when time in bed was restricted. 
The reduction in total sleep time reflected lower amounts of 
Stage N1 and N2, as well as a reduction of the time spent in 
REM sleep (Table 1). In contrast, time spent in deep NREM 
sleep (Stage N3) was nearly identical during RS as compared 
to NS.
Effect of Sleep Restriction on 24-h Profiles of 2-AG and 2-OG 
Levels
Mean 24-h serum eCB concentrations were highly stable for a 
given individual across the two experimental sessions (Supple-
mental Figure 1A and 1B), even though the sessions were sepa-
rated by at least 1 month (2-AG: r2 = 0.99, P < 0.0001 and 2-OG: 
r2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001), indicating strong within-subject repro-
ducibility of the mean circulating concentrations of the two 
lipids despite wide intersubject variability. Statistics on abso-
lute concentrations of 2-AG and 2-OG are reported in Table 1.
To illustrate the effect of sleep restriction on the wave-
shape of the 2-AG and 2-OG profiles, each individual profile 
was expressed as a percentage of its 24-h mean concentration 
under NS conditions (Figure 2A and 2B). As we have previ-
ously reported,30 under NS conditions, the 24-h profile of 2-AG 
displayed a large amplitude with peak levels in the early after-
noon, around habitual lunchtime. The profile of the structural 
analog 2-OG, which is synthesized and degraded by processes 
similar to those controlling blood levels of 2-AG45 but does not 
bind CB receptors, was roughly parallel to that of 2-AG; but 
the daytime increase in 2-OG was of shorter duration and of 
lesser magnitude.28
When sleep was restricted, the amplitude of the 24-h profile of 
2-AG was increased by an average of 33 ± 11% (P = 0.008), and

this increase in amplitude was due to an elevation of the peak by 
an average of 22 ± 7% (P = 0.006; Figure 2A). Moreover, in the 
RS condition, the acrophase (time of peak) occurred approxi-
mately 2 h later than in the NS condition and elevated concen-
trations tended to persist until the end of the study (14:00–21:00; 
P = 0.06; Table 1). In contrast, neither the nadir concentration of 
2-AG nor its timing were affected by sleep duration.
Figure 2B shows the mean 24-h profile of 2-OG, also ex-
pressed as percent of the 24-h mean of the NS profile. The ef-
fect of sleep duration was similar to that observed for 2-AG. 
The amplitude was increased by an average of 38 ± 15% in RS 
versus NS condition (P = 0.024). Similarly, the peak increased 
by 15 ± 7% (P = 0.042), and concentrations remained higher 
than after NS until the end of the study (14:00–21:00; P = 0.019), 
whereas there were no significant changes in 
the nadir 2-OG concentration or timing.
These differences in the 24-h profiles of 
2-AG and 2-OG between the two sleep condi-
tions occurred despite identical meals and ca-
loric intake, similar sedentary conditions, and 
experimental environment, as well as stable 
BMI.
24-h Profiles of Serum Leptin and Ghrelin
Similar to the profiles of 2-AG and 2-OG 
levels, the 24-h profiles of leptin and ghrelin 
were expressed as a percentage of the indi-
vidual mean concentration under NS con-
ditions (Figure 3A and 3B). Overall, mean 
leptin concentrations were not affected by 
sleep duration (NS 9.5 ± 2.4 ng/mL versus RS 
9.5 ± 2.7 ng/mL; P = 0.97) but the amplitude 
of the 24-h variation was blunted following 
RS (NS 3.7 ± 0.9 versus RS 3.3 ± 0.8 ng/mL; 
P = 0.01, Figure 3A) as has been previously 
observed in studies of sleep deprivation.40,46 
As expected,39,47 the orexigenic factor ghrelin 
displayed postprandial dips and rebounds and 
a nocturnal peak (Figure 3B). A trend toward 
higher nocturnal ghrelin levels during RS was 
apparent, but not statistically significant (am-
plitude NS 250 ± 53 pg/mL versus RS 285 ± 76 
pg/mL; P = 0.21). The nocturnal peak occurred 
earlier in the RS than in the NS condition (NS 
01:39 ± 19 min versus RS 00:27 ± 10 min; 
P = 0.002).
The ratio of the ghrelin peak to the leptin 
peak showed an increase following restricted 
sleep (P = 0.04), suggesting a shift in neuroen-
docrine signaling of energy balance consistent 
with promoting more hunger and less satiety.
24-h Profiles of Serum Cortisol (Figure 3C)
The well-documented circadian rhythm of 
plasma cortisol levels, with a nocturnal nadir 
and a morning peak, was present in both sleep 
conditions. Mean 24-h levels were similar in 
both sleep conditions. Because of the later 
bedtime in the RS condition, the inhibitory effect of sleep 
onset occurred later, resulting in a delay of the nadir by ap-
proximately 1 h (NS 01:28 ± 18 min versus RS 02:28 ± 15 min; 
P = 0.004). Conversely, because wakeup time was advanced in 
the RS condition, the morning acrophase was advanced (NS 
08:09 ± 11 min versus RS 05:56 ± 9 min; P < 0.0001). As in 
our previous studies of recurrent partial sleep deprivation,11 
late afternoon and evening cortisol levels (16:00 to 21:00) were 
increased in the RS versus NS condition (NS 5.0 ± 0.3 µg/dL 
versus RS 6.2 ± 0.4 µg/dL; P = 0.011).

fasting conditions, the ratings of hunger, desire 
to eat, quantity that could be eaten, fullness, 
and global appetite did not differ between the 
NS and RS conditions (Figure 4A–4E). For 
each scale, the remaining five ratings taken 
1 h 35 min after breakfast (10:35), 25 min 
prior to lunch (13:35), 1 h 35 min after lunch 
(15:35), 25 min prior to dinner (18:35), and 
1 h 35 min after dinner (20:35) were collapsed 
to derive one mean value for each individual 
in the NS and RS and conditions. There was 
no difference between sleep conditions for 
the mean fullness score (Figure 4D). Despite 
reporting similar feelings of fullness under 
both conditions, RS produced a significant 
increase in ratings of hunger (Figure 4A: NS 
2.9 ± 0.3 versus RS 3.8 ± 0.4, P = 0.02), de-
sire to eat (Figure 4B: NS 3.1 ± 0.01 versus 
RS 3.9 ± 0.4, P = 0.01), quantity of food that 
could be eaten (Figure 4C: NS 3.7 ± 0.1 versus 
RS 4.4 ± 0.5, P = 0.05), as well as a trend for 
an increase in global appetite (Figure 4E: NS 
24.7 ± 3.4 versus RS 29.5 ± 3.3, P = 0.07) 
when compared to the NS condition. When 
considering all individual time points, in an 
analysis of variance for repeated measures, 
the most robust contrast between the RS and 
NS conditions was for the postlunch (15:35) 
ratings for all hunger and appetite scales 
(hunger; P = 0.05, quantity; P = 0.04; strong 
desire; P = 0.05, global appetite; P = 0.05). As 
expected, ratings of vigor were significantly 
lower following RS than NS at all time points 
(Figure 4F, P < 0.01). Scores of mood were 
high and nearly identical under both condi-
tions (Figure 4G).
Ad libitum Feeding
As shown in Figure 5A, when the participants 
were presented with an ad libitum buffet 
after either 4 nights of NS or 4 nights of RS, 
there were no significant differences between 
the two conditions for total calories eaten 
during the first meal (NS: 2,141 ± 145 kcal 
versus RS: 2,019 ± 140 kcal, P = 0.24). It is 
important to note, however, that although the 
estimated mean daily caloric need for these 
participants was 2,313 kcal/day, nearly 90% of 
this caloric requirement was ingested during 
this first ad libitum meal in both sleep con-
ditions. Thus, almost all of the daily homeo-
static energy need was consumed during the 
initial meal opportunity. The macronutrient 
breakdown during this meal was also not af-
fected by sleep duration (Figure 5C, carbo-
hydrate intake: NS 996 ± 65 kcal versus RS 
932 ± 65 kcal, P = 0.25; Figure 5E, fat intake: 
NS 841 ± 76 Kcal versus RS 788 ± 75 kcal,

P = 0.31; Figure 5G, protein intake: NS 313 ± 35 kcal versus RS 
300 ± 40 kcal, P = 0.52). Thirteen of the 14 participants were 
considered for analysis of caloric intake during the snack op-
portunity because one participant was inadvertently not given 
the same food options in the two sleep conditions. Sleep re-
striction as compared to NS resulted in a trend for an increase 
in total caloric intake during the snack period (NS 612 ± 94 
kcal versus RS 993 ± 183 kcal; P = 0.085), with consumption of 
nearly twice as much fat (NS 214 ± 34 kcal versus RS 413 ± 86 
kcal; P = 0.062) and protein (NS 27 ± 4 versus RS 54 ± 12; 
P = 0.072). Carbohydrate consumption was not significantly af-
fected (NS 381 ± 72 kcal versus RS 542 ± 106 kcal; P = 0.218). 
Most interestingly, the compensatory decrease in food intake 
after consumption of the first meal (difference between calo-
ries ingested during the first ad libitum meal and calories in-
gested during the subsequent snack period, Figure 5B, 5D, 5F, 
and 5H) was lower following RS for total caloric intake (NS 
1,506 ± 180 kcal versus RS 993 ± 212 kcal; P = 0.02), for carbo-
hydrates (NS 601 ± 93 kcal versus RS 361 ± 94 kcal; P = 0.05), 
for fat (NS 623 ± 91 kcal versus RS 377 ± 119 kcal; P = 0.05), 
and to a lesser extent for protein (NS 279 ± 37 kcal versus 
RS 241 ± 44 kcal; P = 0.07). Thus, although participants ate 
a meal representing approximately 90% of their daily caloric 
need in both conditions, they were less able to compensate 
with a decrease of their subsequent consumption of snacks 
when they were in a state of sleep debt. We further examined 
Figure 4—Ratings of hunger (A), desire to eat (B), quantity of food that could be eaten (C), feeling of fullness (D), global appetite (E), vigor (F), and mood 
(G) following 3 experimental nights of either 4.5 h (red) or 8.5 h (black) in bed (n = 14). Participants were asked to score visual analog scales 25 min before 
and 1.5 h after each meal, for a total of six ratings across the day.

Figure 5—Caloric intake for each of the ad libitum (ad lib) eating opportunities in the 8.5 h in bed (black) or in the 4.5 h in bed (red) conditions. Eating 
opportunities included a 15:00 and a 19:30 meal (n = 14), and an intervening period where palatable snacks were presented (n = 13). Data shown are 
mean (± standard error of the mean). Horizontal panels present Kcal intake for each eating opportunity (left) and compensatory decrease in snack 
intake after consumption of the 15:00 meal (right) for each sleep condition (back bars: normal sleep; red bars: restricted sleep). From top to bottom: total 
caloric intake (A,B), carbohydrate intake (C,D), fat intake (E,F), and protein intake (G,H). Please note the difference in eating patterns between the two 
conditions; in the normal sleep (NS) condition there is a rebound in intake during the dinner meal, however there is no large increase in dinner intake 
following snack consumption in the RS (restricted sleep) condition. This lack of increase in dinner meal from snack intake is due to high kcal intake during 
the snack opportunity in the RS group.

the difference between calories consumed as snacks and kcal 
intake during the 19:30 meal for both sleep conditions. When 
sleep restricted, despite ingesting approximately more 50% 
kcal as snacks, the participants did not reduce significantly 
their caloric intake during the 19:30 meal (−1 ± 142 kcal, ns). 
In contrast, under normal sleep conditions, the trend for lower 
snack intake was compensated with a significant increase in 
caloric intake at dinner (+511 ± 175 kcal, P = 0.01; difference 
versus RS: P = 0.073). Thus, the temporal pattern of caloric in-
take was modified by sleep loss. Total caloric intake and intake 
from carbohydrate, fat, and protein during the evening meal 
were similar for both sleep conditions.
DISCUSSION
The current randomized crossover study of sleep restriction 
versus normal sleep examined the hypothesis that increases in 
hunger, appetite, and food intake, in a state of sleep debt, are 
associated with increased activity of the eCB system. This hy-
pothesis was suggested by recent evidence indicating that in-
creases in food intake in conditions of sleep loss clearly exceed 
the caloric need of extended wakefulness.13–19 The protocol 
was carefully designed to assess motivation to eat, activity of 
the peripheral eCB system, and subsequent ad libitum intake 
of palatable foods. For each sleep condition, caloric intake was 
rigorously controlled for 4 d, and repeated assessments of sub-
jective hunger and of the simultaneous profile of serum con-
centrations of the eCB 2-AG were obtained the day following 
the third experimental night. After the fourth night, the partici-
pants were allowed to eat ad libitum from a variety of palatable 
foods. The novel and important finding of our study is that in 
a state of sleep debt the amplitude of the robust daily rhythm 
of circulating concentrations of 2-AG, an endogenous ligand of 
the CB1 and CB2 receptors, was amplified due to higher and 
extended peak afternoon concentrations without change in the 
level or timing of the nocturnal nadir, suggesting that the early 
afternoon drive for hedonic eating may be stronger and last 
longer in a state of sleep debt. Simultaneous with the eleva-
tion of eCB levels, when the participants were sleep restricted, 
they reported higher scores of hunger, desire to eat, quantity of 
food that could be eaten, and appetite, despite reporting feeling 
as full as when they had normal sleep. These increases in pe-
ripheral eCB concentrations could be a mechanism by which 
recurrent sleep restriction results in excessive food intake, par-
ticularly in the form of snacks,13,14 despite minimal increases 
in energy need. Consistent with this hypothesis, when the par-
ticipants were faced with an ad libitum buffet in the afternoon 
following the fourth night of sleep restriction, they were less 
able to inhibit intake of highly palatable, rewarding snacks de-
spite having ingested 90% of their daily caloric need only 1 to 
2 h earlier. This diminished compensatory decrease in snack 
intake following a large meal in the restricted sleep condition 
occurred in the late afternoon, coinciding with the time of day 
when 2-AG levels were most increased relative to the normal 
sleep condition. The temporal delay of the 2-AG peak, and 
the persistence of elevated concentrations until the end of day, 
observed following RS may drive hedonic feeding behavior 
later in the day in sleep deprived individuals, with adverse 
consequences on energy homeostasis and weight regulation.48 
Indeed, recent data suggest an association among later timing 
of food intake and weight gain and obesity; animals fed a high 
fat diet at the “wrong” circadian time gain more weight than 
controls.48,49 Humans who consume more than 33% of daily en-
ergy intake in the evening were twofold more likely to be obese 
than morning eaters.50 Thus, alterations in the daily rhythm 
of 2-AG as a result of insufficient sleep may be a contributing 
factor to increases in hunger, appetite, and food intake associ-
ated with a state of sleep debt 13–15,18,19 as well as promote eve-
ning eating and its adverse metabolic consequences.
Evidence is accumulating to indicate that recurrent sleep re-
striction disrupts the neuroendocrine control of energy homeo-
stasis.39,40,46,51 Although the findings have not been consistent 
across all studies, increases in the concentrations of ghrelin, 
a hunger factor, and decreases in the levels and/or rhythm 
amplitude of the satiety hormone leptin have been observed 
in multiple studies.52–54 In the current study, despite the short 
duration and moderate severity of sleep restriction, the ratio 
of the ghrelin peak to the leptin peak showed a significant in-
crease following restricted sleep, signaling a shift in neuroen-
docrine signaling of energy balance consistent with promoting 
less satiety and more hunger. Daytime levels of ghrelin and 
leptin were not significantly affected, although a trend for 
higher postmeal ghrelin levels was apparent. The alterations 
in the 24-h profiles of 2-AG, leptin, and ghrelin observed after 
insufficient sleep in the current study are consistent with the 
hypothesis that stimulation of hedonic eating may precede ac-
tivation of pathways involved primarily in the control of ho-
meostatic feeding.
Circulating levels of cortisol were higher in the late after-
noon following RS, in congruence with previous studies.11 
This elevation of cortisol concentrations in the later part of 
the day was concomitant with the increased concentrations of 
2-AG and occurred without any change in mood scores. In ex-
ploratory analyses, the increase in late afternoon cortisol con-
centrations following RS was not correlated with the increase 
in 2-AG levels.
In the current study, concentrations of 2-OG displayed a 
profile similar to that observed for 2-AG over the 24-h period, 
although blunted in comparison, under both sleep conditions. 
Because 2-OG is a structural analog of 2-AG, and is biosynthe-
sized and degraded by the same enzymes as 2-AG,45 the simi-
larity in findings for 2-AG and 2-OG reinforces the validity of 
our assessments of the eCB system.
Our study has obvious limitations, including the small 
sample size, the short duration of sleep restriction, and the 
relatively low frequency of sampling (i.e., hourly) of eCB con-
centrations that precluded an estimation of putative pulsatile 
variations. The protocol does not address the important issue 
of whether the observed daily variation of eCB levels is partly 
or largely produced by behavioral time cues, such as the sleep-
wake cycle or the feeding schedule. Nonetheless, our findings 
are relevant to normal life conditions and are clearly signifi-
cant and consistent with the epidemiologic evidence.
A growing body of evidence suggests that insufficient sleep 
may be contributing to the increased risk and prevalence of 
obesity. Our current observations suggest that alterations in 
the eCB system may be contributing to the increased drive for

food intake observed following sleep restriction, consistent 
with recent theories suggesting that overweight or obesity are, 
in part, the consequence of dysregulation in reward pathways. 
Increased understanding of the mechanisms linking insuffi-
cient sleep and the risk of weight gain is important to design 
preventive strategies.
