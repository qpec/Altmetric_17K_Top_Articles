The transplantation of pancreatic islets, following the Edmonton
Protocol, is a promising treatment for type I diabetics. However,
the need for multiple donors to achieve insulin independence reflects
the large loss of islets that occurs when islets are infused into the
portal vein. Finding a less hostile transplantation site that is both
minimally invasive and able to support a large transplant volume is
necessary to advance this approach. Although the s.c. site satisfies
both these criteria, the site is poorly vascularized, precluding its
utility. To address this problem, we demonstrate that modular tissue
engineering results in an s.c. vascularized bed that enables the
transplantation of pancreatic islets. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic
SCID/beige mice, the injection of 750 rat islet equivalents embedded
in endothelialized collagen modules was sufficient to restore and
maintain normoglycemia for 21 days; the same number of free islets
was unable to affect glucose levels. Furthermore, using CLARITY, we
showed that embedded islets became revascularized and integrated
with the host’s vasculature, a feature not seen in other s.c. studies.
Collagen-embedded islets drove a small (albeit not significant) shift
toward a proangiogenic CD206+MHCII−(M2-like) macrophage re-
sponse, which was a feature of module-associated vascularization.
While these results open the potential for using s.c. islet delivery as
a treatment option for type I diabetes, the more immediate benefit
may be for the exploration of revascularized islet biology.

ancreatic islet transplantation is a promising treatment for
those living with type 1 diabetes (1, 2), but this therapy has
limitations (3, 4). Using current methods (portal vein infusion),
up to 60% of transplanted islets are lost within the first 3 d (5),
and thus islets from multiple donors are required to achieve
normoglycemia (6). Islet engraftment is adversely affected by the
blood-mediated inflammatory response (7) and a lack of vascu-
larity, subjecting the islets to ischemia.
The s.c. site has been considered as an alternative site for islet
transplantation because of its large (albeit not necessarily readily
accessible) size, and s.c. injection could limit procedural risk com-
pared with other sites. However, because s.c. vascularity is poor (8),
various strategies to vascularize the site are being explored (9, 10),
e.g., the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) (11). With the
perspective that the underlying problem is hypoxia, Ludwig et al.
(12) created an implantable chamber equipped with a refillable
oxygen chamber to support s.c. islet transplantation. Alternatively,
others have used a two-step protocol (13, 14) in which a cavity is
prepared in the s.c. space; islets are then added after several weeks’
delay to minimize the impact of the inflammatory response while
perhaps generating a prevascularized site.
Pancreatic islets are highly susceptible to apoptosis due to in-
sufficient oxygen and nutrient diffusion (15). After transplantation it
is critical that the pancreatic islets become rapidly revascularized
and integrated with the host’s systemic vasculature to achieve glu-
cose homeostasis (16). While revascularization has been observed in
vascularized extrahepatic sites such as the small-bowel mesentery
(10) and kidney capsule (17), revascularization and anastomosis
with the host’s vasculature have not previously been shown in the
s.c. space. Such integration is presumed to be necessary for long-
term graft survival.
Modular tissue engineering is a bottom-up approach to create
vascularized tissue implants that can be injected s.c. (18). Sub-
millimeter collagen cylinders (“modules”) are coated with endo-
thelial cells (EC) (18); the EC migrate and vascularize the s.c. site as
the modules remodel. With MSC embedded in modules as support
cells, a mature s.c. vascular bed is created within 14–21 d of trans-
plantation in both immune-suppressed Sprague–Dawley rats (19)
and immune-compromised SCID/beige (bg) mice (20).
The objective of this study was to show that pancreatic islets
embedded in endothelialized modules and injected s.c. became
revascularized and returned streptozotocin-induced diabetic SCID/
bg mice to normoglycemic levels. The protocol is illustrated in Fig.
S1. The effect of adding adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells
(adMSC) or omitting human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) was also tested. We used the CLARITY protocol (21,
22) to image the entire explant and show the anastomosis of the
pancreatic islets with the host’s systemic vasculature. In addition, we
used flow cytometry to characterize the inflammatory response,
which is a key driver of vascularization but may also limit islet
survival after transplantation.
Results
Restoration of Normoglycemia. Pancreatic islets harvested from
Wistar rats (750 islet equivalents, IEQ) embedded in HUVEC-
coated modules were sufficient to restore normoglycemia
(glucose <11.1 mM) in five of six streptozotocin-induced di-
abetic SCID/bg mice (islet modules with HUVEC, green lines in
Fig. 1 A and B). In four of these implants, normoglycemia was
obtained within 10 d after implantation (Fig. 1B). As expected, free
islets (not embedded in modules) were unable to restore
normoglycemia. Islets embedded in collagen but without EC
Significance
In this study we show that pancreatic islets embedded in modules
coated with endothelial cells and injected under the skin return
streptozotocin-induced diabetic SCID/beige mice to normoglyce-
mia. The transplanted islets became revascularized and directly
integrated with host’s vasculature, a feature not seen previously
in the subcutaneous space. These implants were also retrievable,
an important clinical consideration. The success here means that
islet transplantation can move away from inhospitable sites such
as the peritoneal cavity or the liver.

 were able to return one mouse (of five) to normoglycemic
levels at day 20, but the majority of the animals remained hyper-
glycemic (islet modules without HUVEC, purple line in Fig. 1A;
also see Fig. S2]. Animals that were transplanted with islets and
adMSC embedded in endothelialized modules (islet modules with
adMSC) received some beneficial effect of reduced blood glucose
levels in the diabetic animals (two of six animals returned to nor-
moglycemia by day 8), but this treatment was not as effective as islet
modules with HUVEC but without adMSC. Implants in mice that
had returned to normoglycemic levels were removed without the
mice being killed, and these animals reverted to diabetic pre-
transplantation levels (Fig. S3). Viable islets from the modules
explanted at day 21 stained positively for insulin (Fig. S4A), and
the islet module implants, with or without HUVEC, had the
greatest density of insulin-positive pixels within the implant area
(Fig. S4B).
Islets embedded in collagen modules (with or without HUVEC)
had i.p. glucose-tolerance test (IPGTT) response profiles compa-
rable to nondiabetic controls (Fig. 1C) as well as similar area under
the curve (AUC) (Fig. 1D) at day 14. In comparison, diabetic mice
implanted with free rat islets (no modules) were intolerant of the
glucose bolus (high AUC, red line in Fig. 1C). Islets embedded in
modules with adMSC were able to respond partially to the glucose
bolus, although some of these mice had not returned to normo-
glycemia at 120 min postinjection.
Effects on Vascularization. The CD31+ vessel density in explants
was similar among the different module groups at day 21 (Fig. 2),
even in those with islets but without adMSC; free-islet explants
could not be reliably found and analyzed. As expected, smooth
muscle actin-positive (SMA+) vasculature was present through-
out all the modular implants at day 21, suggesting that the vessels
were mature (Fig. 2A, Lower Row and Fig. S5). The module-
associated vasculature was mainly host-derived at day 21, since
there was a lack of Ulex europeus agglutinin-1–positive (UEA-1+)
vessels in the histological analysis (Fig. S6A).
While there were no observable differences in the total amount
of vessels among the different module groups at day 21 (Fig. 2B),
islet modules with HUVEC at day 7 and 14 had significantly more
CD31+ vessels than islet modules without HUVEC (P < 0.05) (Fig.
2B). In addition, there was a distinct shift in the chimeric nature of
module-associated vasculature at day 7, when 20% of vessels were
UEA-1+, to an entirely host-derived module-associated vasculature
at day 14 with few UEA-1+ vessels (Fig. S6B).
Intraislet Vasculature. In addition to counting vessels around in-
dividual modules, we also observed CD31+ cells within embedded
islets at day 21 (Fig. 3A, Middle), suggesting that islets retained
their vasculature or became revascularized. Although the number
of insulin-positive viable islets among the groups was different
(Fig. S4B), comparisons among the different modular groups
revealed no significant differences in the percentage of CD31+
pixels within the interior of the islets that were present at day 21
(Fig. S7), suggesting that the islets that were found by histology
had similar CD31+ content.
To confirm that these intraislet vessels had anastomosed with
the module-associated vasculature and were perfusable at day

HUVEC (+adMSC) (n = 6). While all free-islet recipients remained hypergly-
cemic for the entire experiment, islet modules with HUVEC were able to
lower glucose levels to normal in all but one animal. Individual glucose
values are shown in Fig. S2. Islet modules without HUVEC or with adMSC and
HUVEC had some therapeutic effect on the average glucose levels; however,
most of these animals remained hyperglycemic. The dotted line represents the
threshold for normoglycemia (11.1 mM). (B) Kaplan–Meier plot showing when

implanted with islet modules with HUVEC reversed diabetes significantly faster
than the free-islet group (P = 0.0043, log-rank, Mantel-cox test) or the group
with islet modules without HUVEC (P = 0.0196, log-rank, Mantel–Cox test).

modules with or without HUVEC. (D) AUC analysis confirmed that mice in the
free-islet group were intolerant of the glucose challenge and that there was a
significant difference between the free-islet group and both groups receiving
islets embedded in modules with (n = 6) or without (n = 5) HUVEC. There was no
significant difference among the islet module groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

day 21. CD31+ vessels (black arrows, Upper Row) were present in all groups,
including the without-HUVEC group, and many of these vessels were also
positive for SMA, suggesting that the vessels were mature. (Scale bars:

similar between the two module groups (P > 0.05). Islet modules without
HUVEC degraded over time, and not many implants could be found at day
21. n = 5 for islet modules with HUVEC and n = 2 for islet modules without

 21, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin 1 (GSL-1) conjugated to Alexa-
555 was injected via the tail vein of the animal. Whole-islet module
(+HUVEC) implants at days 7, 14, and 21 were processed using
CLARITY (21, 22) and imaged using light-sheet microscopy. Islets
were identified by their extensive vascular morphology compared
with the module-associated vasculature (Fig. 3). At day 7, the
module-associated vasculature network had begun to integrate with
the embedded islets (Fig. 3B), but the islet vasculature was not
entirely perfusable at this time point. The GSL-1 lectin was seen to
“pool,” being unable to be removed during the PBS perfusion step
(Fig. 3B and Movie S1). At days 14 and 21, these GSL-1 pools were
not seen, and intraislet vessels became perfusable (Fig. 3 C and D
and Movies S2 and S3).
Embedded islets became fully vascularized by day 21, and the
vessels were computationally mapped using IMARIS to visualize
the direct integration of the modules with the host vasculature
(Fig. 3E): intraislet vessels occupied 20 ± 3% (average of eight
islets) of the total islet volume (Fig. S8C).
Inflammatory Response. Whole implants were analyzed by flow
cytometry to assess the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages
to implants at day 7 and 14. The focus was on the effect of islets in
islet modules with or without HUVEC, but with no adMSC com-
pared with a no-islet control (HUVEC-coated modules without
islets); these groups with islets were best at regulating blood glucose.
Macrophage polarization toward a proinflammatory phenotype
(M1) or an anti-inflammatory repair phenotype (M2) was assessed
by the expression of known M1 and M2 markers (MHCII and
CD206, respectively). At day 7, a small, albeit not significant, shift
was observed toward CD206+MHCII− (M2-like) macrophage in
islet modules, with and without HUVEC, compared with no-islet
controls (Fig. 4C). This progression continued to day 14, while the
no-islet controls were shifting toward a CD206+MHCII+ double-
positive phenotype (Fig. 4E). At day 7 more neutrophils
(CD11b+Ly6G+) (Fig. 4A and Fig. S9A) were observed with islet
modules than with the no-islet control (Fig. S9A), as was a larger
(albeit not significant) proportion of CD11b+F4/80low monocytes.
The large population of neutrophils (and perhaps monocytes) ob-
served at day 7 suggested that inflammation was sustained much
longer than normally seen with modules without islets; without is-
lets, these cells were previously seen to resolve by day 3. On the
other hand, the presence of these cells may indicate the presence of
leaky blood vessels and blood pools at this time (Fig. 3B). At day 14,
neutrophil numbers decreased to expected levels, and few F4/80low
cells were observed (Fig. 4B and Fig. S9B), consistent with the
absence of blood or GSL-1 pools.
Discussion
Modular Tissue Engineering and Islet Transplantation. The streptozotocin-
induced diabetic SCID/bg model enabled us to test the hypothesis
that module-associated vascularization enables s.c. islet delivery and
the return to normoglycemia. Unlike free islets, islets embedded
within modules with HUVEC had a beneficial effect on glucose
levels when transplanted into the s.c. space of streptozotocin-
induced diabetic SCID/bg mice (green line in Fig. 1A); the majority
of the animals became normoglycemic within ∼10 d, which was
sustained for the entire observation period. By day 14, islets were
able to respond to a glucose challenge in a manner comparable to
nondiabetic mice (Fig. 1 C and D). Islets were structurally intact and
demonstrated insulin-positive staining at day 21 (Fig. S4A), sug-
gesting that modules provided a suitable environment for the sur-
vival and function of the transplanted islets. In addition, the vessels
at day 21 in the islet-treatment groups were mature (i.e., invested
with SMA+ cells) (Fig. 2A) and entirely host-derived (Fig. S6).
The s.c.-injected islet modules with HUVEC self-assembled to
form a tissue “organoid.” This construct remained intact and
retrievable (Fig. S3) due to the presence of the HUVEC, which pro-
tected the constructs from collagen degradation. This retrievability
in the event of complications is an important clinical consider-
ation for future work using alternative insulin-producing cells
such as stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells.
Simply embedding islets within collagen modules (without other
cells) offered some impact on glycemia, but these mice reverted to
hyperglycemia within the 21-d observation period (purple line in
Fig. 1A and see Fig. S2). Islet modules without HUVEC degraded
over time (histology was feasible on only two of five implants due to
the loss of module integrity), and the islets may have lost structure
(and function) due to collagen degradation (23, 24), causing the
eventual return to hyperglycemic levels. The IPGTT results were
similar at day 14 regardless of treatment group (Fig. 1C), suggesting
that there was still sufficient islet mass in the no-HUVEC group at
day 14, consistent with the nonfasting near-normal glucose levels
(Fig. S2) and reports that collagen is beneficial for maintaining
intact islet structures (23, 25). However, islets in the collagen-alone
group failed after day 14, rendering this group a less favorable

 option than islet modules with HUVEC, although better than free
islets alone.
The addition of adMSC did not have a beneficial effect on the
ability of the transplanted islets to return diabetic mice to nor-
moglycemia (Fig. 1B). Some literature supports the use of MSC
in islet transplantation protocols (26, 27), although this may
depend on MSC source (28) and dosage. There was also no
substantive need for adMSC as a vascular support cell here (in
the presence of islets), unlike previous module studies where they
were critical for promoting early HUVEC survival (20). adMSC
may not offer any vascularization advantage in the presence of
the islets, given that islets also release proangiogenic growth
factors (e.g., VEGF-A) in response to hypoxia (29). Perhaps the
adMSC were competing with the embedded islets for nutrients
and oxygen at critical early time points.
s.c. Islet Delivery. The s.c. space is being pursued as an alternative
site for the transplantation of pancreatic islets (13, 26) because it
can support a large, retrievable transplant volume. The primary
challenge of the s.c. site for the transplantation of pancreatic
islets is ensuring proper vascularization. Other groups have
attempted to use the s.c. site with different systems, but these typ-
ically need excess islets to achieve glycemic control due to poor
vascularization and a corresponding lack of direct integration with
the host (28, 30, 31). For example, Hirabaru et al. (30) used an
MSC sheet to s.c. transplant 2,000 rat islets to rectify diabetes
in SCID/bg mice for 28 d, but they were unable to achieve a
therapeutic effect with a lower dosage of islets. Similar islet
numbers (2,000–3,000) are reported by others for s.c. normo-
glycemia in xenograft models in immune-compromised mice
(13, 30, 32). The success (or lack of success) of xenogeneic islet
transplantation, largely in the kidney capsule, has been reviewed
elsewhere (33). With modules containing HUVEC, 750 IEQ was
sufficient to restore normoglycemia in this immune-compromised
xenograft model.
To improve vascularization (and reduce islet needs), some
groups have attempted to prevascularize the s.c. site in a first
step for subsequent islet transplantation in a second step (13, 14,
26, 34). These strategies were effective at prolonged glycemic
control [some >100 d (13)] with low numbers of syngeneic islets,
but it is unclear if they achieved the intended prevascularization
in all cases. For example, based on published micrographs, the
vessel density appears much less than that we typically see with
modular tissue engineering (20). In addition, these groups often
required 20–50 d after islet delivery (13, 14, 35) to see a return to
normoglycemia (compared with ∼10 d for islet modules with
HUVEC), perhaps highlighting the limited vascularization of
their prevascularized sites.

 We have yet to use autoimmune diabetes models such as the
NOD mouse or the NRG Akita mouse (36), nor have we ex-
plored transplants over longer times (e.g., 3 mo). More importantly,
these mice do not have the impaired vascularity that is associated
with human diabetes. It has been reported that 8–16 wk of hyper-
glycemia is required to observe features of diabetic neuropathy in
rodents (37), which may be indicative of when vascular pathology
also occurs. Our approach provides a platform that can be used
to understand the relationship between s.c. islet graft viability and
revascularization in this and, we expect, other animal models of
greater translational significance.
Islet Revascularization and Integration. Integration of the trans-
planted rat islets with the host’s vasculature is important for glucose-
sensing and insulin-secretion activity of the beta cells (38). Islet
modules with HUVEC provided the most consistent and robust
return to normoglycemia in our study, which we attribute to islet
revascularization and integration. At day 21, CD31+ staining
was present within structurally intact islets of our s.c. implants
(Fig. 3A), consistent with the presence of an intraislet vascu-
lature. To directly show that these intraislet vessels had anas-
tomosed with the host’s vasculature, we adapted a CLARITY
protocol (39) with animals that had been injected with GSL-
1 lectin via the tail vein (Fig. 3 B–E and Movies S1–S3). Islets
were identifiable by their distinct vasculature morphology
(clusters of small GSL-1+ vessels), which were integrated with
the host vasculature (Fig. 3 D and E). Such an integrated and
perfusable vasculature was a highlight here but was not hitherto
a feature of previous s.c. implant studies (13, 30).
CLARITY processing also showed that vessel remodeling was
complete between days 7 and 14. The vasculature was perfusable
(Fig. 3C and Movie S2) and invested with SMA+ cells (Fig. S10,
Lower Row) by day 14 with the pools of GSL-1 attributed to leaky,
immature vessels that were seen at day 7 (Fig. 3B and Movie S1) no
longer visible. The time to achieve revascularization of the
pancreatic islets (between days 7–14) is consistent with the time
to return to normoglycemia (∼10 d). The volume of intraislet
vasculature relative to total islet volume (∼20%) (Fig. S8) was
comparable to that of freshly isolated rodent islets [17% of total
islet volume (40)]. This maintenance and integration of the
intraislet vasculature has been proposed to be critical for long-
term graft survival (15) and has not been shown previously with
s.c. islet transplants.
Innate Immune Response. There were differences in CD45+ cell
numbers at day 7 in islet modules with HUVEC relative to no-
islet controls (Fig. 4A), but this difference subsided by day 14
(Fig. 4B). The presence of islets elicited more inflammatory cells
relative to the standard module implant (41). This early increase
in cell number is consistent with reports that islets will recruit
leukocytes triggered by a response similar to the instant blood-
mediated inflammatory response (42). There is evidence that
VEGF-A (29) and IL-8 (43) secreted by islets are potent drivers
not only of angiogenesis but also of the recruitment of CD45+
leukocytes in the form of neutrophils (29) and monocytes/mac-
rophages (44). Surprisingly a large population of neutrophils was
still present at day 7 in implants containing embedded islets (Fig.
4A and Fig. S9A), even though neutrophils typically decline after
the first 48 h of inflammation (45).
A fundamental dilemma in promoting vascularization of islet
transplants is that the inflammation that underlies vasculariza-
tion, as noted above, can impair islet function. Mitigating this
concern, we note that islets embedded in modules (with or
without HUVEC) had a higher fraction of M2-like macrophages
(CD206+MHCII−) at day 7 compared with the no-islet control
(Fig. 4 C and E, Upper), although the differences were not sig-
nificant. At day 14, macrophages predominately expressed the
M2-like phenotype (Fig. 4 D and E, Lower) in all groups.
Previous studies have shown a positive effect of M2-like mac-
rophages on beta cell survival (46) and proliferation (47). Per-
haps this stronger bias toward M2 macrophages was a factor in
islet survival and vessel integration. The s.c. modules may allow
the study of immune-modulatory strategies, e.g., small molecule
inhibitors (48) or cells (49), to promote graft survival or toler-
ance in immune-competent animal models.
Conclusion
The s.c. injection of rat pancreatic islets embedded in endothe-
lialized modules was able to return streptozotocin-induced di-
abetic SCID/bg mice to normoglycemia. HUVEC seeded on the
modules was important for vascularization at early time points
and for preserving the structural integrity of the modular im-
plants. Islets embedded in endothelialized modules became revas-
cularized, and whole-explant imaging showed that the intraislet
vasculature had integrated with the host’s vasculature by day 14,
a feature not shown in previous s.c. studies. In addition, em-
bedded islets experienced an inflammatory response that con-
sisted of mainly M2-like macrophages, which was considered
important for tissue remodeling and vascularization, although
the high neutrophil response at day 7 suggests that there may be
a need to modulate other aspects of early inflammation to
protect islet viability. Module-based vascularization in which
the transplanted islets become integrated with the host vascu-
lature has enabled the s.c. site to be a suitable option for islet
transplantation.
Materials and Methods
Islet Isolation. Primary rat islets were harvested from 12-wk-old Wistar rats
using a previously described protocol (50). IEQ were then calculated based on
volumetric assumptions (51). Primary rat islets were cultured in RPMI-
1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-
streptomycin (Pen/Strep) (Gibco). For the in vivo studies, eight independent islet
isolations and transplantations were performed. Each isolation generated
enough islets (2,800) for three implants, spanning multiple test groups.
Module Fabrication. Modules were fabricated as before (20). HUVEC-coated
islet modules were produced by embedding rat islets (750 IEQ) without
adMSC. In addition, HUVEC-coated modules that contained adMSC (106 cells/mL
collagen solution; Lonza) or no embedded cells were produced. For a complete
list of the different cell compositions used for the modules in this study, please
refer to Table S1.
Module Transplantation. All animal experiments and surgeries were per-
formed at the University of Toronto and were approved by the Faculty of
Medicine Animal Care Committee. SCID/bg mice (5–6 wk old; Charles River)
were made diabetic through a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/
kg) (Sigma-Aldrich) 1 wk before transplantation. Blood glucose was mea-
sured via the tail vein with a glucose meter (OneTouch UltraSmart; LifeScan),
and animals were considered diabetic when their blood glucose levels
exceeded 20 mM for two consecutive daily readings.
The modules were rinsed with PBS (Gibco) and s.c. injected into the dorsum
using an 18-G needle, as previously described (19, 20). Animals were housed
individually in sterile conditions and were provided with irradiated food and
water. Nonfasting blood glucose levels were monitored daily until the implants
were harvested at days 7, 14, or 21. An IPGTT was performed at days 7 and 14.
Mice that were hyperglycemic at day 21 (>11.1 mM) were killed, and the s.c.
implants were removed for analysis. Mice that returned to normoglycemia by
day 21 were anesthetized, the s.c. modular implant was removed, and the ani-
mals were allowed to recover. Blood glucose levels were monitored for the
following 2–3 d before the animal was killed; this enabled confirmation that the
implant was responsible for the return to normoglycemia. Explants were either
sent for histological processing or analyzed using flow cytometry (Fig. S1).
CLARITY Processing and Imaging. GSL-1 (Vector Laboratories) conjugated to
Alexa-555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was injected via the tail vein of the SCID/
bg mouse, and the whole body was perfused as previously described (39). The
clarified tissue was imaged using light-sheet microscopy (Zeiss Z1 light-sheet
microscope at the Sick Kids Imaging Facility) to generate a 1-mm3 image,
which was then digitally processed using Bitplane IMARIS (version 8.1).

 Tissue Digestion and Flow Cytometry. For flow cytometry studies, explants
were digested and stained with a panel of markers for inflammatory cells,
following previous reports (52). Results were acquired using a five-laser LSR
Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD), and data were further analyzed using
FlowJo software (v10.0.8).
