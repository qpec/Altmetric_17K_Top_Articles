A therapeutic approach

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of intracranial tumor. We have established a
lentivirus-induced mouse model of malignant gliomas, which faithfully captures the pathophysiology and molecular
signature of mesenchymal human GBM. RNA-Seq analysis of these tumors revealed high nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
activation showing enrichment of known NF-kB target genes. Inhibition of NF-kB by either depletion of IkB kinase 2
(IKK2), expression of a IkBaM super repressor, or using a NEMO (NF-kB essential modifier)–binding domain
(NBD) peptide in tumor-derived cell lines attenuated tumor proliferation and prolonged mouse survival. Timp1,
one of the NF-kB target genes significantly up-regulated in GBM, was identified to play a role in tumor prolif-
eration and growth. Inhibition of NF-kB activity or silencing of Timp1 resulted in slower tumor growth in both
mouse and human GBM models. Our results suggest that inhibition of NF-kB activity or targeting of inducible NF-kB
genes is an attractive therapeutic approach for GBM.
INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the deadliest human
cancers, with an average survival of around one year from the time
of diagnosis (1). This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance
and tumor recurrence following surgical removal. GBM is remarkably
heterogeneous and may represent several unique entities with distinct
cell types of origin and various genetic lesions, resulting in different
clinical behaviors (2, 3).
Recent advances in molecular technology, mainly high-density
microarrays and next-generation sequencing, have allowed the clas-
sification of glioblastomas into subtypes based not only on histological
level but also on gene expression signatures. Although several reports
have attempted to define the different molecular subtypes of GBM
(4–7), two subtypes, termed proneural and mesenchymal (MES),
appear robust and generally consistent among the different classifica-
tions proposed. Tumors classified into the MES subtype exhibit worse
prognosis and have been correlated with poor radiation responses,
high expression of CD44, and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation
(8). Despite the progress in genetic analysis and classification of
GBM, there remains an insufficient understanding of the underlying
mechanisms of progression and recurrence of gliomagenesis.
NF-kB comprises a family of transcription factors that can form
different heterodimers or homodimers and bind to consensus DNA
sequences at promoter regions of target genes. NF-kB is a master
regulator of cell survival, inflammation, and immunity, and is involved
in a myriad of activities related to cellular functions. NF-kB activation
pathways can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines
(tumor necrosis factor–a and interleukin-1b), pathogen-associated
molecular patterns, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, reactive ox-
ygen species, growth factors, DNA damage, and oncogenic stress (9).
In a canonical pathway, NF-kB homodimers or heterodimers
are retained in the cytoplasm through a noncovalent interaction
with an inhibitory protein, IkB. In response to an external signal,
the IkB protein is phosphorylated by the IkB kinase (IKK) complex,
ubiquitinated, and degraded, leading NF-kB proteins to the nucleus.
The IKK complex contains IKK1/IKKa, IKK2/IKKb, and the NF-kB
essential modifier (NEMO)/IKKg. Upon activation, the IKK complex
phosphorylates the IkB inhibitor, marking it for degradation by the
proteasomal degradation machinery. Once translocated to the nucleus,
NF-kB dimers can bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of
various genes involved in several aspects of cellular activities.
Although NF-kB has been shown to play a major role in cancer
development by inducing and maintaining a proinflammatory mi-
croenvironment, constitutive NF-kB activation appears to promote
tumor initiation and progression through mechanisms such as cell
proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, and repro-
gramming of metabolism (9). In GBM, constitutive activation of
NF-kB has been shown to promote growth and survival. Inhibition
of NF-kB activity by sulfasalazine induces glioma cell apoptosis
(10), and a strategy to inhibit NF-kB using a decoy oligonucleotide
resulted in a significant reduction in cell numbers (11). NF-kB ac-
tivity has been recently associated with the transition from proneural
glioma stem cell (GSC) to MES differentiation, with an associated
radioresistant phenotype. Here, MES differentiation parallels NF-kB
activation, radioresistance, and poor prognosis (8). RelB has also been
reported to be an oncogenic driver of MES glioma tumor growth and
invasion (12).
Here, we confirmed the constitutive activity of the transcription
factor NF-kB in mouse and human GBM models and found that spe-
cific inhibition of NF-kB in tumor cells by knocking down IKK2,
overexpressing the super repressor IkBaM, or using a small peptide
targeting NEMO [called NEMO-binding domain (NBD)] (13–15) de-
creased tumor cell proliferative capacity and extended mice survival.
We further identified Timp1, one of the NF-kB target genes highly
expressed in our mouse GBM tumors, to be involved in the mecha-
nisms of NF-kB–dependent tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore,
inhibition of NF-kB using NBD peptide or by knocking down Timp1
with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human GBM tumors reduced cell
proliferation and resulted in slower tumor progression.

 RESULTS
Activation of NF-kB in glioblastoma
MES GBM subtype is characterized by a high frequency of NF1
mutation/deletion, in combination with p53 mutations and loss of
heterozygosity (7). In addition, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
analysis showed specific enrichment of genes in the NF-kB pathway in
MES tumors (fig. S1) (7, 16). We modeled the MES subtype by stereo-
taxic injections of Cre-inducible oncogenic lentiviral vectors con-
taining either shNF1-shp53 or HRasV12-shp53 in the cortex of glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) Cre mice (17). Both oncogenic vectors
gave rise to tumors with similar histopathological characteristics and
molecular signatures. RNA-Seq analysis of HRasV12-shp53–induced
glioma tumors revealed a high expression of NF-kB target genes in
comparison to normal brain tissue (Fig. 1A). These results were fur-
ther validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis using six representative NF-kB target
genes in either HRasV12-shp53– or shNF1-shp53–induced glioma
tumors (Fig. 1B and fig. S2). Immunofluorescence analysis showed
the presence of Nestin, the MES marker CD44, and nuclear p65+ cells,
as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion in tumor sections (Fig. 1C).
The expression of additional MES markers (18) was validated by
qRT-PCR (fig. S3).
To further characterize the extent of constitutive NF-kB activation
in tumor cells, we examined NF-kB activity in 005 cells, a tumor-
derived mouse cell line that we previously showed to have all the
characteristics of a brain tumor–initiating stem cell (BTIC) (19). Nu-
clear extracts from 005 cells showed a high p65 translocation in

 comparison to control neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (Fig. 2A).
We also transduced 005 cells and NPCs with a kB-mCherry reporter
and found a higher expression of mCherry in 005 tumor cells (Fig. 2B
and fig. S4). In addition, we performed a qRT-PCR analysis of repre-
sentative NF-kB target genes and found a higher expression on 005
cells compared to NPCs (Fig. 2C). Finally, RNA-Seq analysis of 005
tumors revealed a high expression of NF-kB target genes in comparison
to normal brain tissue (Fig. 1A). Together, these results indicate that
our lentivirus-induced MES glioma tumors have constitutive NF-kB
activation.
Silencing IKK2 in glioma cells impairs tumor proliferation
The NF-kB pathway has been reported to play an important role in
tumor cell development, survival, invasion, and chemoresistance (8),
and IKK2 is a critical kinase in the NF-kB activation cascade. We
sought to explore the effects of IKK2 inhibition on glioma cells as a
therapeutic approach to blocking the NF-kB pathway. We transduced
005 tumor cells with a lenti-shIKK2-mCherry vector and confirmed
the knockdown of IKK2 in sorted cells by Western blot analysis and
the decreased expression of NF-kB target genes by qRT-PCR analysis
(Fig. 3, A and B). We next analyzed the proliferation capacity of IKK2
knockdown cells in comparison to parental 005 cells or 005 cells
transduced with a scrambled lenti-shRNA (shIRR), and we found
that silencing IKK2 in 005 cells impaired their proliferative capacity
(Fig. 3C). To examine the effects of IKK2 inhibition on tumor
growth, we performed in vivo experiments by transplanting 005-
shIKK2 cells and 005-shIRR control cells into the cortex of new
mice. Compared with 005-shIRR transplanted mice, 005-shIKK2
mice developed glioma tumors with a longer latency (Fig. 3D). Similar
results were obtained when the same line of experiments was conducted
in a BTIC derived from an shNF1-shp53 tumor (fig. S5). We next
decided to work with an inducible system where primary cortical
astrocytes isolated from IKK2fl/fl transgenic mice were transduced
with a lenti-HRasV12-iresCre-ErT2-shp53 construct (see the diagram
of a lentivector in Fig. 3E). Transduced astrocytes (AR53Cre-ErT2)
lose IKK2 expression in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-ohtmx;
the active metabolite of tamoxifen), as shown by Western blot analysis
and qRT-PCR analysis of NF-kB target genes (Fig. 3, F and G). In
addition, we confirmed the knockdown of IKK2 by immunofluorescence
staining of p65 and electrophoretic mobility shift assay for NF-kB
binding (fig. S6, A and B). As shown before for 005 cells, inhibition of
IKK2byaCre-inducibledeletionofIKK2inAR53Cre-ErT2cellsreduced
their proliferative capacity (Fig. 3H). Finally, orthotopic transplantation
of AR53Cre-ErT2 cells and cells transduced with the IkBaM super
repressor (nondegradable mutant form of IkBa; fig. S6) showed that
blocking NF-kB activity, either by Cre-inducible deletion of IKK2 or
by use of the IkBaM super repressor, prolongs mice survival (Fig. 3I).
NBD peptide inhibits NF-kB activation in gliomas
We have so far used a genetic approach to block NF-kB activity in
glioma cells. Next, we sought to explore the selective inhibition of
NF-kB activation by a peptide that blocks the interaction of the
regulatory protein NEMO with the IKK complex (13–15, 20–22).
Activation of NF-kB requires the activity of the IKK complex that
includes IKK1 and IKK2 and the regulatory protein NEMO (23).
Ghosh et al. (14) showed that the NBD peptide (Fig. 4A) specifically
blocked the cytokine-induced NF-kB activity and the NF-kB target
gene expression without affecting the basal NF-kB activity. Moreover
and relevant to our study, they showed that the NBD peptide can enter
the central nervous system (CNS) and inhibit NF-kB activity in vivo
(fig. S7) (14).
To test the inhibitory effects of NBD on glioma cell lines, we incu-
bated AfR53Cre-ErT2 cells with either the NBD peptide or TPCA-1 (2-
[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide),
a small-molecule inhibitor of IKK2. Analysis by qRT-PCR showed a
decreased expression of NF-kB target genes (Fig. 4B). NBDwt, but not
a mutant form of the peptide (NBDmut), reduced NF-kB activity, as
shown by decreased P-IkBa and P-p65 (Fig. 4C). Similar results were
obtained when 005 BTICs were incubated with NBDwt peptide, as
validated by qRT-PCR analysis and proliferation assay (Fig. 4, D and E).
We next examined the effects of NBD treatment using an orthotopic
model for 005 BTICs. We started treating the mice 10 days after 005

 cells were stereotaxically transplanted into the brains of the mice. Each
mouse received a daily dose (10 mg/kg) of either NBDwt or NBDmut
peptide intraperitoneally for 20 days. Compared to the nontreated or
NBDmut-treated mice, the NBDwt-treated mice developed tumors
with a much longer latency (Fig. 5A). At the end of the 20-day treat-
ment, we sacrificed two mice in the NBDwt-treated group and extracted
RNA from the small GFP+ lesion in their brain. Next, we compared the
expression of NF-kB target genes by qRT-PCR analysis with two repre-
sentative tumors from mice in the nontreated group, two tumors from
mice in the NBDmut-treated group, and two representative tumors
from mice in the NBDwt-treated group that succumbed to the disease
(end point). The results show that NBDwt was capable of inhibiting the
activity of NF-kB in the tumor during the duration of the treatment,
which was evident in the lower expression of representative NF-kB tar-
get genes (Fig. 5B). Although NBDwt-treated mice had a small tumor
lesion at an early time point (fig. S8), they eventually developed compa-
rable tumors at the end points and recovered the expression of NF-kB
target genes (Fig. 5B). Taking into account the antiproliferative effect of
NBDwt on glioma cell lines in vitro, we examined tumor sections at the
end point for the proliferation marker Ki67 and found that NBDwt-
treated mice had a low expression of Ki67 compared to the control
group (Fig. 5, C and D). These results support the idea that the major
contribution of the NF-kB pathway to our glioma model is most likely
pro-proliferation.
To further validate our results in a human setting, we examined
the constitutive NF-kB activity in patient-derived glioma cell lines.
qRT-PCR of representative NF-kB target genes confirmed NF-kB
activity (Fig. 6A) and RNA-Seq analysis of these cell lines. Next, we

 evaluated the effects of the NBD peptide on U87 cells and found that
the expression of NF-kB target genes is decreased in the presence of
NBDwt but not when the cells were incubated with NBDmut peptide
(Fig. 6B). To examine the effects of NBDwt in vivo, we transduced
U87 cells with a lentivirus expressing luciferase and injected into the
brain of NOD-SCID (nonobese diabetic–severe combined immuno-
deficient) mice (the experimental design is outlined in fig. S9A). We
initiated treatment with NBDwt peptide 10 days after U87-luc injec-
tion, and bioluminescent imaging results showed that NBDwt treat-
ment resulted in slower tumor growth and reduced tumor size (Fig.
6C). Mice in the control group succumbed to the disease after 30 days
of injection, and this time, we decided to continue the treatment with
NBDwt peptide. Almost 40 days after treatment, mice started to show
symptoms of sickness (they lost 20 to 25% of their original weight), and
we were not able to continue with the experiment. Toxicology analysis
revealed liver toxicity, as shown by an elevated serum level of the liver
enzyme L-alanine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (ALT) (fig. S9B).
Although we were not able to continue treatment beyond 40 days
owing to the toxic side effects, NBDwt treatment almost doubled
the median survival time from less than 30 days to more than 50 days
(Fig. 6D). Together, these results suggest that NBDwt peptide slows
tumor growth in both mouse and human GBM models and extends
survival.
Timp1 is one of the NF-kB target genes involved in
tumor proliferation
The pleiotropic toxicity of NF-kB inhibitors is known (24), so we next
sought to find downstream NF-kB target genes involved in NF-kB–
induced tumor proliferation as therapeutic targets. We examined the
expression levels of NF-kB target genes, and Timp1 was among the
genes significantly up-regulated in the lentivirus-induced GBM tumors
(table S1). Xia et al. (25) recently identified Timp1 as one of the
mediators for NF-kB–induced lung tumor growth. Here, we validated
the expression of Timp1 in mouse glioma tumors and mouse GBM cell
lines by qRT-PCR (Fig. 7A). In addition, when 005 and NF5310 BTICs
were treated in vitro with the NF-kB inhibitor TPCA-1, Timp1 expres-
sion levels decreased (Fig. 7B). The same results were observed when
NF-kB activity was inhibited by either deletion of IKK2 (fig. S10A)
or expression of the IkBaM super repressor in AR53Cre-ErT2 cells
(fig. S10B). As Xia et al. (25) showed previously in lung cancer, a lack
of NF-kB activation leads to a low expression of Timp1 and impaired
phosphorylation of Erk, supporting the idea that, as in lung cancer,

 NF-kB and its target Timp1 play an important role in glioma cell
proliferation (fig. S10B). Reduced levels of Timp1 were also found
in 005 tumors treated with NBDwt peptide compared to the control
group (fig. S10C).
We next investigated the role of Timp1 in human GBM by assessing
the expression of the gene in TCGA data sets. Timp1 is highly ex-
pressed in glioma tumors and is significantly up-regulated (approxi-
mately 60% of the tumors) in comparison to pooled normal controls
(fig. S11, A and B). In addition, we confirmed by qRT-PCR that our
patient-derived cell lines also express high levels of Timp1 (Fig. 7C).
To test the functional consequence of silencing Timp1, we designed an
inducible lentivirus to knock down Timp1 (miRTimp1; fig. S12, A
and B, and Fig. 7D). Silencing Timp1 in U87 cells significantly de-
creased their proliferative capacity (Fig. 7E). The addition of the matrix
metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 had no effect on the proliferative
capacity of U87 cells, suggesting that the original role of Timp1 is not re-
sponsible for its pro-proliferative activity, in agreement with what was
previously reported for the lung cancer model (25). Finally, U87-miR-
Timp1 cells were transplanted into the brain of NOD-SCID mice. Ten
days after the transplantation, one group of mice [miRTimp1(+)Dox] re-
ceived doxycycline (Dox) in their chow. The control group continued
to feed on normalchow. As shown in Fig. 7F, specific inhibition of Timp1
prolonged mice survival compared with the control groups. Depletion of
Timp1 in tumor cells resulted in slower tumor growth (fig. S13), and con-
focal analysis of tumor sections showed that U87-miRTimp1(+)Dox
expressed lower levels of Ki67 (Fig. 7G). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed
that inducible shTimp1 tumors [miRTimp1(+)Dox] had less Timp1 ex-
pression than control mice [miRTimp1(−)Dox] (fig. S14).
To further investigate the correlation between Timp1 expression
and patient survival, we looked through the REMBRANDT (REpository
for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa) data set. Glioma patients with
down-regulated expression of Timp1 have better prognosis than patients

 with up-regulation of Timp1 expression (fig. S15). Our data strongly
support the possibility of using NF-kB inhibitors or targeting NF-kB
downstream target genes (for example, Timp1) as therapeutic approaches
for the treatment of glioblastoma.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have confirmed the constitutive NF-kB activity in our MES
GBM mouse model and in patient-derived cell lines. Inhibition of
NF-kB activity has been shown to impair tumor progression (9). Several
groups have proposed the idea of targeting the NF-kB pathway as a
therapeutic approach to treating GBM. Preclinical studies using sulfa-
salazine, an anti-inflammatory drug, showed promising results (10);
however, a phase 1/2 clinical trial using this drug in advanced-grade
gliomas was terminated as a result of lack of response (26). Other
drugs that target NF-kB have been used in preclinical studies either
alone or in combination with temozolomide, with the latter being
the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic treatment for GBM (27). Ra-
diation therapy has also been extensively used for GBM treatment
in the past decades, although the mechanisms responsible for GBM
radioresistance remain unknown. Cancer stem cells, a population of
cells that sustain the growth of GBM and other types of cancer, have
been previously reported to be resistant to radiation therapy (28–30).
A recent study by Bhat et al. (8) showed the correlations among
MES differentiation and plasticity, NF-kB activation, and poor radiation
response accompanied by shorter survival. They suggested that tumor
microenvironmental factors induce a MES phenotype in GSCs, render-
ing these cells radioresistant in an NF-kB–dependent fashion, and they
proposed that NF-kB inhibition could directly affect radioresistance
and therefore constitute an attractive therapeutic approach for GBM.
Here, we primarily focused on the inhibition of NF-kB activity in
tumor cells. We observed a significant decrease in proliferative capacity
among cells lacking IKK2 or expressing the IkBaM super repressor.
This impaired proliferation was translated in vivo into slower tumor
growth. To achieve a better effect in vivo, we used the NBD peptide, a
peptide corresponding to the NEMO binding domain that specifically
inhibits the induction of NF-kB activity (15). The NBD peptide has
been used previously to inhibit inflammation in animal models such
as acute inflammation in carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema
and collagen-induced arthritis (31) or Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(13). One of our main reasons for choosing the NBD peptide to treat
GBM is the reported ability of NBD to enter into the CNS and exert an
effect on NF-kB activation in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease
(14). Indeed, our results show that NBD treatment of mice with
GBM significantly extended their survival, probably as a result of the
specific inhibition of NF-kB not only in the tumor cells but also in
the tumor microenvironment. The NBD peptide has a potential advan-
tageoverothercurrentlyavailableanti–NF-kB drugs that target the IKK
kinases. Most of the available small inhibitors of IKK kinases compete
for the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket, which is known to be
shared by many other kinases. The pleiotropic effect of anti–NF-kB
drugs cannot be ruled out, and our attempt to continuously treat glioma-
bearing mice intraperitoneally for almost 40 days resulted in toxic effects.
In the future, this toxicity effect can be reduced if the NBD peptide is
specifically targeted to the tumor. We have previously successfully admin-
istered an otherwise highly toxic antiapoptotic peptide (KLAKLAK)
coupled to tumor-homing nanoparticles (32).
In our search for an NF-kB target gene, we identified Timp1 as
being highly up-regulated in our GBM mouse model and in patient-
derived cells. Selective inhibition of Timp1 in tumor cells affected their
proliferative capacity, and silencing Timp1 in tumor cells in vivo
prolonged mice survival. These results further support our previous
findings in lung cancer, where NF-kB and Timp1 were shown to
play an important role in tumor cell proliferation and lung cancer
progression (9). As discussed previously, many pharmaceutical
companies have focused their efforts on developing small inhibitors
targeting NF-kB. However, safety concerns arise from the involvement
of NF-kB in so many biological functions (8). Identifying target genes
of NF-kB that play a role in gliomagenesis may offer an alternative
approach to targeting this pathway. We have recently identified
Spp1/OPN to be an important hub in the molecular network regulating
dedifferentiation of tumor cells. Silencing OPN specifically in tumor
cells resulted in longer survival (33). OPN has been reported to have
putative NF-kB binding sites in its promoter (34), and our results
show decreased levels of OPN when GBM-bearing mice are treated
with the NBD peptide (Fig. 5). Further experiments are required to
show the link between NF-kB activation, OPN secretion, and de-
differentiation in glioma cells.
In summary, we validated the constitutive NF-kB activity in MES
gliomas both in our GBM mouse model and in patient-derived cells.
Our results suggest that NF-kB activation has a pro-proliferative
function in GBM and that inhibition of this pathway, by inhibiting
either NF-kB activity or preferentially NF-kB–inducible genes,
presents an attractive therapeutic approach to treating GBM. Sup-
pression of NF-kB activity or target genes by drugs administered
locally following surgery will block tumor cell growth and recurrence
and will reduce toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice, lentiviral injections, and orthotopic transplants
hGFAP-Cre and NOD-SCID mice were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory. The IKK2fl/fl mouse was obtained from Pasparakis et al.
(University of Cologne) (35). All mice were maintained under pathogen-
free conditions at the Salk Institute, and all procedures performed in
this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Lentivirus [HRas-shp53 or shNF1-shp53; (17)], prepared as de-
scribed previously (36), or cells (3 × 105 cells per mouse) were stereo-
taxically injected into the brain of mice (transgenic or NOD-SCID,
respectively). The shRNA sequences used were 5′-CCACCTTATAC-
CAGCGTTATA-3′ (IKK2), 5′-ATTCCAGTCCCGTCACCTTGC-
TA-3′ (hTimp1-1), and 5′-AAAGTCAACCAGACCACCTTAT-3′
(hTimp1-2). For in vivo bioluminescent imaging, U87 cells were
engineered to express luciferase by transduction with a lenti-CMV-
luciferase vector. Tumor growth was monitored using the Xenogen
IVIS 100 Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). NBD-treated mice
were administered 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally for the indicated num-
ber of days.
RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analysis
Once mice had reached clinical end points, they were anesthetized
and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. The brain was removed
from the skull, and normal brain tissue was trimmed away from GFP+

 tumor tissue using a dissecting microscope. Tumor tissue was cut into
small pieces and stored in RNAlater (Qiagen). RNA was isolated using
the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
with the addition of deoxyribonuclease. cDNA libraries were prepared
using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina). RNA sequencing
was performed using a HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System (Illumina). Se-
quence reads were mapped to the mm9 mouse genome build. Raw
reads of each individual gene were counted and normalized to fpkm
using Cuffdiff v2.1.1. The NF-kB target gene list was obtained from
http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/NF-KB/. A heat map was drawn using heatmap.2
from the R package.
Cell culture
Primary astrocytes were obtained from GFAP-Cre mice pups 10 days
after birth and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary astrocytes
were transduced at early passage. 005 and NF5310 cells were maintained
in N2-supplemented (Invitrogen) DMEM/Ham’s F12 (Omega Scien-
tific) containing fibroblast growth factor-2 (20 ng/ml), epidermal
growth factor (20 ng/ml; Promega), and heparin (50 mg/ml; Sigma).
SK892, SK429, and SK748 patient-derived cell lines were provided
by S. Kesari (University California, San Diego) and maintained in
NeuroCult NS-A Basal Medium (StemCell Technologies) supplemented
with NeuroCult NS-A Proliferation Supplement, recombinant human
epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), recombinant human basic fibroblast
growth factor (10 ng/ml), and heparin (2 mg/ml). U87 glioma cells
were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS.
