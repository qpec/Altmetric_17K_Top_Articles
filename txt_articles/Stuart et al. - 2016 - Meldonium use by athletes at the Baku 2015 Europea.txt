ABSTRACT
Background The aim of this report was to estimate
the prevalence of meldonium use in athletes competing
in the Baku 2015 European Games to contribute to the
surveillance of substances on the 2015 World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) Monitoring Program. Meldonium
is reported to be used by athletes to potentially enhance
personal performance and shorten the recovery period
after physical activity.
Methods Three sources of data were reviewed to
determine the prevalence of meldonium use during the
Games including: (1) athlete self-reported declarations of
drug and supplement use; (2) declarations from National
Olympic Committee medical teams of the list of
medicines that they imported into Azerbaijan as part of
their stock of drugs for administration; (3) results from
the antidoping laboratories reporting the detection of
meldonium.
Results Meldonium was declared as imported into
Azerbaijan by 2 of 50 National Olympic Committee
medical teams at the Games, but athletes from 6
countries declared the use of meldonium. Only 23 of the
662 (3.5%) athletes tested from 8 to 28 June 2015
declared the personal use of meldonium, which included
13 competition winners. However, 66 of the total 762
(8.7%) athlete urine samples analysed during the Games
and during precompetition tested positive for
meldonium. Meldonium use was detected in athletes
competing in 15 of the 21 sports during the Games.
Conclusions This study highlights the widespread and
inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription
drug in a generally healthy athlete population.
Subsequent to these findings, WADA has included
meldonium as a prohibited substance on the 2016 List
of Prohibited Substances.
INTRODUCTION
The aim of this report is to identify the prevalence
of meldonium use in the 5632 athletes competing
in
the
Baku
2015
European
Games
held
in
Azerbaijan from 12 to 28 June 2015, with the
purpose of contributing to the surveillance of sub-
stances listed on the 2015 W
orld Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) Monitoring Program.
Clinical use of meldonium
Meldonium is registered and prescribed as a drug
for
human
therapeutic
use
in
Latvia,
Russia,
Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Uzbekistan, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan, and is manu-
factured under a number of brand names. These
include: Cardionate; Idrinol; Medatern; Melfor;
Midolat; Mildronate; Mildroxyn and Vazomag in
Russia; and Metamax; Methyldronat; Metonat;
Mildronate;
Trizipin;
Vazonat
and
Vazopro
in
Ukraine.1
Meldonium—chemical
name:
3-(2,2,2-
Trimethyldiazaniumyl) propanoate—is an inhibitor
of carnitine synthesis and is reported to have cardi-
oprotective and anti-ischaemic effects. It has been
used in a variety of disorders including for the
management of ischaemic heart disease and ischae-
mic cerebrovascular disturbances. T
ypical thera-
peutic oral and intravenous doses range from
500 mg to 1 g of meldonium daily. A course of
500 mg given four times daily for 7–10 days has
been reported to be used clinically in alcohol
abstinence syndrome.1
The WADA publishes the List of Prohibited
Substances and Methods at least annually. This list
includes any substance or method that has medical
or scientific evidence, whether alone or in com-
bination, to enhance performance, to represent
health risk to the athlete or to violate the spirit of
sport.2
In addition, WADA also publishes a list of sub-
stances on the WADA Monitoring Program, which
is composed of substances that are under surveil-
lance by WADA to detect possible patterns of use
or misuse in sport. The substances specifically
being monitored by WADA during 2015 were:
▸ Stimulants including: bupropion, caffeine, nico-
tine,
phenylephrine,
phenylpropanolamine,
pipradrol and synephrine;
▸ Narcotics including: hydrocodone, mitragynine,
morphine/codeine
ratio,
tapentadol
and
tramadol;
▸ Glucocorticoids;
▸ T
elmisartan;
▸ Meldonium.
WADA accredited laboratories responsible for
testing urine or blood samples from athletes are
requested to test and report on such substances
being monitored. This information is used by
WADA as evidence to inform future decisions
about whether to prohibit specific substances or
not. It should be noted that the reported presence
of a drug on the WADA Monitoring Program in an
athlete’s blood or urine sample would not result in
an antidoping rule violation by the athlete.
Meldonium
was
added
to
the
WADA
Monitoring Program in January 2015 in light of
anecdotal reports of use among the athlete popula-
tion
during
the
London
2012
Olympic
and
Paralympic Games. During London 2012, declara-
tions from each team were required for all medi-
cines being imported into the UK. Five teams
declared the importation and possession of meldo-
nium for legitimate use by their own medical teams
accompanying the athletes.

 METHODS
Three sources of data were reviewed by the EOC Medical and
Anti-Doping Commission to determine the prevalence of mel-
donium use during the Baku 2015 European Games.
Self-reported meldonium use on doping control forms
At the time of providing a urine or blood sample at a doping
control station, all athletes were asked to declare any medica-
tions or nutritional supplements taken during the previous
7 days. Athletes were also asked to sign to indicate that the
samples could be used anonymously for antidoping research
purposes.
Members of the European Olympic Committees (EOC)
Medical and Anti-Doping Commission present in Baku during
the Games undertook a review of the doping control forms and
recorded the self-reported declarations made by the athletes.
Declaration of meldonium as medical team stock
Each country’s National Olympic Committee (NOC) participat-
ing in the Games was required to submit a declaration to the
Baku 2015 Games Medical Services of all medicine supplies
being imported into Azerbaijan for use by their own medical
teams during the time of the Games. These declarations were
reviewed for self-reported meldonium stock, which the teams
were carrying for the purpose of administration to members of
their team.
Laboratory detection of meldonium in doping control
samples
T
wo WADA accredited laboratories were used to analyse urine
and blood samples during the Games. These were located in
Moscow, Russia, and in Seibersdorf, Austria. Sample testing was
split between the two laboratories, based on a preplanned agree-
ment related to specific sports.
Both
WADA
accredited
laboratories
screened
all
urine
samples specifically for the presence of meldonium. These data
were provided directly to WADA as part of the Monitoring
Program surveillance.
RESULTS
Self-declaration of meldonium
There were a total of 864 tests, which included 762 urine and
102 blood tests from 46 of the 50 participating NOCs, under-
taken by the Baku 2015 Anti-Doping Services. Of these, 662
(297 female/365 male) were undertaken from 8 to 28 June
2015, and the rest were undertaken as pregames testing in the
month prior to the Games.
Of all Baku 2015 Doping Control Forms reviewed from 8 to
28 June 2015, 525 of 662 (80%) had a self-reported declaration
by the athlete for either a medication or nutritional supplement.
A total of 23 of the 662 (3.5%) athletes tested from 8 to 28
June declared the personal use of meldonium at the time of the
Games.
There were 13 competition winners who declared taking
meldonium:
▸ Six of these athletes won either a gold medal or first place in
the competition;
▸ Five of these athletes won a silver medal or came second
place;
▸ T
wo of these athletes won a bronze medal or came third
place.
Athletes declaring meldonium use were competing in one of
the following sports: taekwondo, wrestling, diving, swimming,
road cycling, athletics (long distance running and high jump),
fencing, boxing, gymnastics, volleyball and canoe-sprint.
Laboratory detection of meldonium
A summary of findings from both, the Moscow and Seibersdorf
laboratories,
relating
to
substances
on
the
2015
WADA
Monitoring Program are provided below. Only the data for mel-
donium are discussed in this report.
Combined laboratory data
▸ Of 762 urine samples analysed, 66 cases of meldonium were
reported (8.7%).
▸ Both laboratories reported meldonium >100 ng/mL; the
Moscow laboratory provided estimated concentrations in the
range of 0.7–273 mg/mL; estimated concentrations were not
available for the Seibersdorf laboratory.
Moscow laboratory data
Four hundred and fifty urine samples were analysed and 48 mel-
donium cases reported.
Seibersdorf laboratory data
Three hundred and twelve urine samples were tested and 18
meldonium cases reported.
Comparison of self-reported versus laboratory-detected
meldonium
The table below presents the comparison of self-reported
declared use by athletes versus the laboratory detection in indi-
vidual samples by sport (table 1).
Importation of medicines by NOC teams
Of the 50 NOCs represented at the Games, the importation of
meldonium into Azerbaijan was declared to the Games Medical
Services by 2 NOCs as stock for potential issue or administra-
tion by their team doctors.
▸ One country declared: 20 ampoules of meldonium 500 mg
solution for injection
▸ One country declared: 120 tablets of meldonium 250 mg
However, athletes from six different countries declared the
use of the drug on the doping control forms. There are three
possible reasons for this:
1. The athletes had personal supplies of meldonium, which was
not required to be declared at the time of importation;
2. The NOC medical staff members were unaware that one or
more of their athletes were taking meldonium;
3. The NOC failed to declare this drug as being imported.
DISCUSSION
Estimate of prevalence of meldonium use
Meldonium use was detected across athletes competing in 15 of
the 21 (71.4%) sports staged during the Games. The sample of
662 athletes tested represented a cross-selection of athletes from
46 of the 50 (92%) NOC’s participating.
There was significant under-reporting of the use of this drug
by athletes in most sports. Only 23 (3.0%) of the 662 athletes
tested self-reported taking the drug, compared to 66 (8.7%) ath-
letes who actually tested positive for meldonium. Of the 66
(65%) athletes who tested positive for meldonium, 43 did not
declare taking the drug in the past 7 days. This clearly indicates
significantly more widespread use of this drug than was openly
declared by athletes at the Games.
Owing to the blinding of personal and demographic details
prior to sending the samples to the laboratories, it is not known

 which specific countries the athletes who tested positive for mel-
donium came from. Thus direct extrapolation of this 8.7%
prevalence to the wider European Games athlete population
may
not
necessarily
indicate
the
extent
of
use
on
a
country-by-country basis.
The availability and accessibility of the drug to athletes across
Europe is an important consideration in assessing the actual
spread of meldonium use in athletes across Europe. In addition,
the recognised medical use and prescription of meldonium in a
number of countries will also potentially impact on the number
of positive findings reported by the laboratories for athletes
from those countries.
Meldonium is reported to be registered for medical use in
seven Eastern European countries that competed at the Baku
2015
Games,
including
Latvia,
Russia,
Ukraine,
Georgia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus and Moldova. The number of athletes from
these countries represented a total of 23.2% (1306 of 5632) of
the entire athlete population competing at the Games.
The geographical commercial availability of meldonium for
medical use correlates with the countries of origin of the athletes
who self-declared its use, and also correlates with the NOC
medical teams who carried it as team stock. The self-reported
declarations of meldonium in the doping control forms suggests
that it is likely that there is higher prevalence of use in countries
where meldonium is registered and prescribed compared to
countries where meldonium is not registered for medical use.
However, it is likely that athletes and healthcare providers
from any country where the drug is not officially registered for
medical use could easily obtain the drug through medicine
importation and exportation routes, and even more easily
through online purchases. There are numerous Internet sites
advertising meldonium for postal purchase to any country
worldwide.
Not all athletes were tested during the games, and so actual
prevalence cannot be accurately determined. However, extrapo-
lation of the 8.7% prevalence of meldonium to the athletes
from the seven competing countries where meldonium is regis-
tered for medical use would equate to a total of 114 athletes.
Extrapolation to the entire general athlete population would be
490 athletes, but this is likely to be an overestimate. The esti-
mated number of athletes taking meldonium during the 2015
Games is likely to lie somewhere within this range.
The significant under-declaration of meldonium use by ath-
letes raises suspicion that many athletes did not want to let the
antidoping authorities know about their use of meldonium. The
doping control form, which the athletes completed at the time
of sample collection at the Baku Games, specifically asked the
individual athlete to ‘list all medications and nutritional supple-
ments taken during the past seven days’; all of the athletes then
signed a declaration on the form stating that the information
they have given on the document is correct.
This under-reporting is probably also confounded by the fact
that, although disclosure of this information is requested, there
are currently no penalties under the existing W
orld Anti-Doping
Code for failing to do so. These findings should prompt a
review
by antidoping
authorities to
develop
strategies
to
strengthen the accountability of athletes for declaring this infor-
mation; potentially through education or disciplinary action.
Potential to enhance performance
The evidence to
demonstrate any
performance enhancing
effects of meldonium in the athlete population is limited. There
appears to be some evidence that meldonium may benefit exer-
cise performance in rodents, but specific studies to evaluate
potential effects on performance specifically in elite athletes
have not been identified. The following studies provide some

 further understanding of the actions of the drug that could be
linked to effects on performance.
The beneficial effect of meldonium on cerebral circulation
disorders and central nervous system functions was demon-
strated in a study by Sjakste et al;3 patients became more active
with
decreased
motor
dysfunction.
Meldonium
was
also
reported to be of benefit for the improvement of reduced work
capacity and for physical and psychoemotional overexertion.3
A study by Germane4 on the effects of meldonium on the
behaviour of mice and rats describes increased mobility of the
animals, increased exploratory behaviour and enhanced toler-
ance to prolonged hypoxia after the administration of meldo-
nium.
This
study
also
showed
a
positive
effect
on
the
sympathoadrenal system in stressed animals with accumulation
of catecholamines in the brain and adrenal glands.
One large randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
by Dzerve et al5 demonstrated that meldonium (1 g/day) in com-
bination with a standard therapy was superior in improving the
exercise tolerance of patients with stable angina pectoris com-
pared to treatment with placebo in combination with a standard
therapy.
Meldonium is used medically in patients for the treatment of
myocardial ischaemia with effects reported to include improved
systolic function, inhibited hypertrophy and dilation of the myo-
cardium, improved peripheral blood circulation and increased
stress tolerance. Consequently, the use by athletes could poten-
tially result in enhanced personal performance and a shortening
of the recovery period after physical activity.
Adverse effects reported by the manufacturers of meldonium
include headache, agitation, tachycardia, allergic skin reactions
and dyspepsia. Serious adverse effects that pose a significant risk
to health or life, after taking meldonium, have not yet been
found in the scientific literature. The seemingly safe clinical
profile of this substance, coupled with the perception that it
may have some effect in enhancing recovery or performance,
are all confounding reasons why the drug may be routinely pre-
scribed in young and otherwise healthy athletes.
WADA criteria for banning substances
A substance is considered for inclusion on the Prohibited List if
WADA determines that it meets any two of the following three
criteria:
1. There is medical or other scientific evidence, pharmaco-
logical effect or experience that the substance or method,
alone or in combination with other substances or methods,
has the potential to enhance or actually enhances sport
performance;
2. There is medical or other scientific evidence, pharmaco-
logical effect or experience that the use of the substance or
method represents an actual or potential health risk to the
athlete;
3. That the use of the substance or method violates the spirit of
sport.2
Given that the clinical indications for meldonium are for car-
dioprotective and anti-ischaemic effects, this widespread preva-
lence of use in an otherwise healthy athlete population is clearly
not primarily for a therapeutic reason. Rather, the drug is evi-
dently being used with the intention to either improve recovery
or enhance performance—use of a substance with the intention
to improve performance is, by WADA’s definition, a violation of
the spirit of sport.
As shown, there is some pharmacological evidence to suggest
that this drug does improve performance, and the widespread
use in the athlete community suggests that there is some benefit
being observed that is potentially perpetuating its use among
athletes. In addition, the knowledge that 13 competition
winners at the Baku 2015 Games, known to have taken meldo-
nium at the time of competition, might also be interpreted as
indicating some efficacy of the drug to improve performance,
although this cannot be proven through the observations pre-
sented in this report. Further research to further explore the
potential for performance enhancement in athletes is warranted.
The clinical use of meldonium specifically in young athletes
has not been documented, nor is it known what dosages the ath-
letes were taking at the time of competition in Baku. This lack
of data raises concerns as to whether the use in this way repre-
sents any health risk or longer term clinical consequences in this
specific population.
CONCLUSION
The laboratory findings of 66 positive results for meldonium of
762 (8.7%) samples and the active surveillance undertaken by
the EOC Medical and Anti-Doping Commission, show the
widespread use of this drug by athletes competing at the Baku
2015 European Games. These findings highlight the excessive
and inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription drug
in a generally healthy athlete population.
Subsequent to these findings, meldonium has been included
as a prohibited substance on the 2016 WADA Prohibited List.
The report from the Baku Games would have been a contribut-
ing source of surveillance reviewed by WADA in the decision
process to determine the status of meldonium. As of 1 January
2016, a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for its use by a com-
peting athlete must be applied for by the treating doctor, outlin-
ing the justification for the clinical use for legitimate medical
treatment. This TUE must be approved by the relevant sporting
federation or national antidoping organisation prior to the
athlete competing. A TUE would not usually be granted if a
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Athletes with meldonium found in their system from 1
January 2016 will be subject to disciplinary action and
potential sanctions by national and international sporting
bodies.
▸ From 1 January 2016, a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE)
must be obtained by the prescriber for an athlete if it is to
be given for legitimate therapeutic use.
What are the findings?
▸ There is an alarmingly high prevalence of meldonium use by
athletes in sport as demonstrated by the laboratory findings
at the Baku 2015 European Games.
▸ Thirteen medallists or competition winners were taking
meldonium at the time of the Baku 2015 European Games.
▸ Meldonium use was detected in athletes competing in 15 of
the 21 sports during the Baku 2015 European Games.
▸ As of 1 January 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency has
put meldonium on the 2016 List of Prohibited Substances
and so it is now banned in sport. Meldonium was not
prohibited previously.

 permitted alternative to the substance exists and can be used
instead.
Given the widespread use of this drug in the athlete popula-
tion, a global awareness campaign for athletes and healthcare
providers highlighting that the drug is now prohibited should be
undertaken by National Anti-Doping Organisations, to promote
awareness and prevent future doping violations as a result of
meldonium. In addition, further education for athletes and their
medical support personnel about appropriate prescribing of
medical drugs only for legitimate medical care is warranted.
