Abstract 
Immunotherapy has matured into standard treatment for several cancers, but much remains to be done to extend 
the reach of its effectiveness particularly to cancers that are resistant within each indication. This review proposes 
that nutrition can affect and potentially enhance the immune response against cancer. The general mechanisms that 
link nutritional principles to immune function and may influence the effectiveness of anticancer immunotherapy 
are examined. This represents also the premise for a research project aimed at identifying the best diet for immuno-
therapy enhancement against tumours (D.I.E.T project). Particular attention is turned to the gut microbiota and the 
impact of its composition on the immune system. Also, the dietary patterns effecting immune function are discussed 
including the value of adhering to a healthy diets such as the Mediterranean, Veg, Japanese, or a Microbiota-regulat-
ing diet, the very low ketogenic diet, which have been demonstrated to lower the risk of developing several cancers 
and reduce the mortality associated with them. Finally, supplements, as omega-3 and polyphenols, are discussed as 
potential approaches that could benefit healthy dietary and lifestyle habits in the context of immunotherapy.

Immunotherapy: today’s status and future outlook
Check point inhibitor therapy has brought a paradigm 
shift in the treatment of advanced cancer by introduc-
ing immunotherapy as a recognized first and second line 
modality. The major benefit is the long-term effective-
ness, that can be observed with immunotherapy agents 
compared to other standard therapies such as chemo-
therapy or pathway inhibitors. However, only a subset of 
cancers within each indication responds to this treatment 
leaving the majority of patients unaffected by this poten-
tially curative modality [1].
We have recently shown, that human cancers evolve 
following a strict selection bottleneck according to a 
degenerate process based on genetic instability and lead-
ing to a trial and error enhancement of oncogenic pro-
cesses or through an orderly stepwise accumulation 
of relevant driver mutations. In the former case, the 
degenerate and chaotic process associated with enhanced 
immunogenicity of cancer cells, while in the latter can-
cer cells adapted to grow without being recognized by 
the host immune surveillance [2]. Immunotherapy works 
only in the context of the immunogenic disorderly can-
cers while silent tumours are resistant. Within immuno-
genic tumours, only a subset responds to immunotherapy 
and the reasons for the unpredictable outcomes remain 
unknown.
Three categories of factors may determine immune 
responsiveness in cancer: the genetic make up of the 
host, the somatic profile of cancer cells and the environ-
ment [3].
While most efforts to understand immune responsive-
ness revolve around the somatic alterations of cancer 
cells and their effect on the host cells within the cancer 
microenvironment and in the circulation, relatively little 
information is available about the role played by environ-
mental factors in modulating cancer-interactions. Here, 
we summarized how a fundamental aspect of daily life, 
dietary habits, could influence cancer growth and/or 
responsiveness to immune modulation. Clear variations

are seeing in the functions of the human immunome 
according to simple variables such as age, physiological 
or pathological status as recently discussed by Davis et al. 
[4].
Several conditions have been associated with varia-
tions in immune function. However, nutri-genomics (the 
analysis of transcriptional programs activated by nutri-
ents) has been championed by few. There are several 
ways in which nutrition can affect cancer growth through 
systemic or local effects within the tumour microenvi-
ronment (TME). Metabolic factors like the decrease of 
arginine and tryptophan level, the increased metabo-
lism of glucose with the subsequent increase of lactate 
levels, and the adenosine pathway, are all well known to 
have an impact on the immune activity inside the TME. 
It is also clear that the general metabolic status deter-
mining deviations from ideal body weight highly influ-
ences the immune status. In addition, particular dietary 
components such as vitamins may be modulated by the 
nutritional status and secondarily affect immune func-
tion. Moreover, nutrition may affect the gut microbiome, 
which in turn has drastically different effects on immune 
function according to its composition [5–7]. All these 
aspects of nutrition within the context of the immune 
biology of cancer will be discussed here.
The link between immunity and nutrition
Food represents not only a source of nutrients for body 
growth and for the maintenance of essential functions, 
but also includes dietary components that behave as anti-
gens. Especially, innate and adaptive intestinal immune 
cells scattered throughout the lamina propria or pre-
sent within secondary lymphoid organs, such as Peyer’s 
patches and colonic lymphoid follicles, can elicit a robust 
response when stimulated by food antigens. In fact, it has 
been demonstrated that food ingestion leads to a condi-
tion of post-prandial low-grade inflammation, which is 
not only regional but also systemic [8]. In healthy volun-
teers serum levels of the inflammatory cytokine, interleu-
kin (IL)-17, dramatically increases 1 h after the ingestion 
of a western-type hyper caloric breakfast [9]. This was not 
observed in a control group of individuals who ingested 
along with breakfast polyphenols containing fruit juice. 
These substances are characterized by a remarkable anti-
inflammatory activity, which accounts for the reduction 
of IL-17 serum concentration.
A trial conducted in normal weight children, who fol-
lowed a Mediterranean diet (MD) for 1 year compared 
to age matched controls, who disregarded health food 
recommendations, demonstrated different immune pro-
files [10, 11]. Quite interestingly, at the end of the trial 
in the former group, salivary levels of the anti-inflam-
matory cytokine, IL-10, increased, while levels of IL-17 
decreased. In the latter group of children, who mostly ate 
“junk food”
, a dramatic increase in IL-17 was observed at 
the expense of IL-10. In this context, IL-10 is a cytokine 
predominantly produced by FOXP3+ T regulatory 
(TREG) cells, which are induced in the intestine by sev-
eral dietary components, such as vitamins (A and D), 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3) and polyphenols.
The homeostatic equilibrium between TREG cells (IL-
10) and Th17 cells (IL-17) is broken in different clinical 
settings. Overall, obesity, a diet-related disease, repre-
sents a systemic inflammatory condition characterized 
by an excessive production of IL-17 and IL-21, which, 
in turn, are strong inducers of Th17 cells [12, 13]. The 
intense and prolonged inflammatory status in obese peo-
ple is responsible for diabetes, cardiovascular events, 
neuro-degeneration, and, in some cases, cancer.
Immunosenescence is known as the decline of the 
immune system with age accounting for increased fre-
quency of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic dis-
eases in elderly [14]. Hypo-nutrition in aging aggravates 
the already impaired immunity, since aged people are fre-
quently malnourished in relation to poor socio-economic 
conditions, mental illnesses and tooth loss [15]. Impor-
tantly, lack of proteins and oligo-elements in elderly 
determines severe immune deficit, which can be fatal. For 
instance, zinc deficit in elderly is very common, but undi-
agnosed, thus leading to T cell malfunction and increased 
frequency of respiratory infections and poor responses to 
vaccination [16]. Consequently, zinc supplementation in 
the elderly with zinc deficiency is very effective for the 
treatment of chronic diseases [17]. Among other natural 
products, evidence suggests that administration of red 
grape polyphenols to aged people restores impaired T 
cell functions, thus increasing protection against winter 
infections [18]. Moreover, prebiotics, probiotics and sym-
biotics have been shown to restore innate and adaptive 
immunity in elderly, also correcting alterations of intesti-
nal microbiota which, under normal conditions, contrib-
utes to immune homeostasis, balancing the equilibrium 
between TREG cells and Th17 cells [19]. The immu-
nomodulation exerted by natural products in elderly is 
illustrated in Table 1.
Immune cells originating from the circulation includ-
ing monocytes represent a significant component of the 
tumour microenvironment [20]. Monocytes differenti-
ate into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), whose 
density positively correlates with tumour progression 
[20]. In highly immunogenic tumours, T cytotoxic (Tc) 
cells are also present, thus leading to tumour destruction 
or at least limitation of cancer growth. However, tumour 
cells and TAMs produce suppressive cytokines [for exam-
ple, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta], 
which, in turn, dampen T cell-mediated cytotoxicity [21].

Furthermore, TAMs express PD-1 ligand, which binds to 
PD-1 inhibiting Tc cell function [22]. Importantly, TAMs 
secrete the chemokines CCL17 and CCL22, which attract 
TREG cells, and Th2 cells to tumour site, thus down-
regulating Th1 cell function [20]. It is well known that 
Th1-related cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-
gamma, allow Tc and natural killer (NK) cells to prolif-
erate, while enhancing their function, respectively. Then, 
the integrity of the Th1 function is essential for Tc and 
NK cell-mediated tumour destruction to occur.
In a recent review, Mattner and Wirtz [23] pointed out 
the ambiguous role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the 
tumour development. Th1-type ILCs (ILC1) producing 
IFN-gamma and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha 
play a predominant anti-carcinogenic activity. Th2-type 
ILCs (ILC2) are both pro-tumorigenic (inhibition of 
Th1 cells) and anti-tumorigenic (attraction of eosino-
phils which are cytotoxic to tumour cells). Also the role 
of Th17-type ILCs (ILC3) is ambiguous, since produc-
tion of IL-17 and IL-22 favour tumour growth on one 
side, while, they may also interact with tumour cells via 
natural cytotoxic receptors or by forming tertiary lym-
phoid structure that results in cancer cell elimination. It 
is worth mentioning that the IL-17/IL-22 innate axis in 
the gut can be modulated by both polyphenols and pro-
biotics, suggesting the potential of dietary manipulation 
in different clinical settings [24]. However, the exact role 
of ILCs in the context of cancer has to be better clarified.
The cellular composition of the tumour microenviron-
ment leads to a status of chronic non-resolving inflam-
mation. In fact, TAMs, as well as cancer cells, produce 
an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 
beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 via activation of the transcrip-
tion factors NF-kB and STAT 3 [25]. In addition, release 
of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) 
accounts for epigenetic modifications, arrest of DNA 
repair mechanisms and DNA mutations, which favour 
cancer proliferation [26]. Once established, chronic 
inflammation leads to fibroblast recruitment contribut-
ing to the tumour microenvironment and tissue remodel-
ling [27]. For instance, in both hepatocellular carcinoma 
and pancreatic cancer fibroblasts have been shown to 
enhance the aggressiveness and invasiveness of tumour 
cells [28, 29]. Production of TGF-beta by TAMs leads to 
accumulation of M2-type macrophages that contribute to 
fibrosis and hypoxia [30]. Moreover, macrophages pro-
duce matrix metalloproteinases, which are enzymes able 
to degrade the extracellular matrix, thus facilitating met-
astatic dissemination of cancer cells.
In general terms, TAMs exert procarcinogenic effects, 
either generating growth factors (Epidermal Growth 
Factor, Fibroblast Growth Factor and Vascular Endothe-
lial Growth Factor) [31, 32] or releasing cytokines, such 
as IL-6, which exhibit anti-apoptotic activities on can-
cer cells [33]. It is should be emphasized, however, the 
immune infiltrates within the tumour microenviron-
ment are characterized by a natural plasticity and their 
functional orientation can be reverted by variation in 
the intra-tumour homeostasis induced by various exog-
enous agents such as immunotherapy or environmentally 
related factors such as co-morbidities, diet and microbi-
ota [34, 35].
In conclusion, it is likely that an appropriate dietary 
regimen can maintain the equilibrium between the 
inflammatory pathway (triggered by Th17 cells) and 
the anti-inflammatory cascade of events mainly based 
on TREG activity. Thus, a nutritional intervention in 
patients with cancer, should take into account a possi-
ble imbalance in the ratio between Th17 and TREG cell 
function. Accordingly, dietary intake of bioactive prin-
ciples with food or via the products derived from food 
with extra health benefits in addition to basic nutritional 
value, the so called nutraceuticals, should be evaluated in 
order to enhance anti-tumour immune response.
Dietary patterns that affect immune function: 
Mediterranean diet, Veg diet, Japanese diet, 
or a Microbiota stimulating diet
It is in general appreciated that only long-term and 
consistent dietary pattern can benefit human health, or 
conversely, induce inflammation and increased oxida-
tive stress if an unhealthy diet is followed, that leads to 
chronic disease [36].
The use of specific nutraceutics, discussed in the fol-
lowing paragraphs, should be framed in the broader con-
text of the composite diet.
In this section, we will review some diet patterns that 
have been assessed for health benefits. We will give the 
historical background, and review their components.
The diet that affects our health starts from the pre-
natal stage and accompanies us, with major fluctuations, 
for the rest of our lives. Here, we will focus on diet appro-
priate to the adult stage of life.
Mediterranean diet
The description of the MD stems from the nutritionist 
Ancel Keys, who in 1945, in the wake of the US Fifth 
Army, landed in Southern Italy, where he observed one 
of the highest concentrations of centenarians in the 
world. He also noticed that cardiovascular diseases, 
widespread in the USA, were less frequent there. In par-
ticular, among the Southern Italians, the prevalence of 
“wellness” diseases such as hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus was particularly low [37, 38]. Keys, focused his 
attention on fat consumption suggesting that the main 
factor responsible for the observations was the type of

Soldati et al. J Transl Med  (2018) 16:75 
diet traditionally consumed among people facing the 
Mediterranean Sea, low in animal fat, as opposed to the 
Anglo-Saxon diet. The link between serum cholesterol 
and coronary heart disease mortality was subsequently 
demonstrated by the Seven Countries Study [39, 40]. 
Later, the concept of MD was extended to a diet rich in 
fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and olive 
oil as the main source of lipid, shared among people liv-
ing in Spain, Greece, Southern Italy and other Coun-
tries facing the Mediterranean basin [41].
A meta-analysis of twelve primary prevention studies, 
including a total of over a million and a half individuals 
followed for a period of time varying from 3 to 18 years, 
found a significant reduction in the risk of overall mor-
tality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. In 
addition, it was observed a reduced incidence and mor-
tality of cancer, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, in 
association with the adherence to a MD [42]. In 2010, 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) recognized the MD as an 
“Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity”
.
Recently, Dehghan et al. [43] published in the Pro-
spective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study 
that high carbohydrate intake is associated with an 
increased risk of overall mortality, but not with the 
risk of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular mor-
tality. The intake of any type of fat has been associated 
with a lower risk of overall mortality. In the meantime, 
the PURE group reported in another article that the 
assumption of raw fruits, legumes and vegetables, as 
source of carbohydrates, is associated with lower mor-
tality [44]. For greater clarity and in order to ensure a 
healthy diet it is important to consider the nutritional 
quality indexes, and the amount of bioactive food com-
ponents that bear a potential preventive effect on can-
cer, as those in MD [45]. The healthy MD is made of 
a proper combination of quality foods, evaluated both 
on the basis of the macro and micronutrient content, 
but also on the absence of contaminating substances 
such as pesticides, fertilizers and endocrine disrupters, 
which can alter the intestinal microbiota [10, 46, 47].
According to current understanding, the key factors 
against immune-mediated inflammatory responses, such 
as those occurring in cancer, as well as their potential 
clinical application, are on one side low cholesterol lev-
els and on the other high levels of antioxidants contained 
in fruits and vegetables and mono unsaturated fatty acid 
(MUFA) present in fish, nuts and olive oil.
Moreover, nutritional supplementation with arginine, 
omega-3 fatty acids and nucleotides results in a marked 
improvement of immune functions in cancer patients 
undergoing surgery and a reduction in infectious compli-
cations, hospital stay and co-morbidities [48].
New insights into the effects of MD on incidence and 
mortality of different types of cancer have come from a 
recent systematic review and meta-analysis that ana-
lysed 56 observational studies including 1,784,404 sub-
jects [49]. The results confirmed an inverse association 
between the adherence to MD and overall cancer-related 
mortality with risk of developing several types of cancer 
including: breast, colorectal, gastric, prostate, liver, head 
and neck, pancreatic and lung cancer.
Among components of the MD, olive oil has been the 
subject of several epidemiological studies suggesting its 
protective role in cancer. Associations between increased 
consumption of olive oil and decreased risk of devel-
oping breast [50–53] and colorectal cancer have been 
observed [54–56]. The main protective effects of olive oil 
consumption are attributable to the presence of mono-
unsatured fatty acids (MUFA) and phenolic compound, 
including simple phenols, aldehydic secoiridoids, flavo-
noids and lignans, although at present there is no scien-
tific evidence determining the role played on the immune 
system by antioxidant or MUFA components. Oleic acid 
is the prevalent fatty acid, linoleic and palmitic acids are 
also present although in minor quantity, while antioxi-
dants include, among others, phenols, lignans and flavo-
noids [57, 58]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 
13,800 cancer patients and 23,340 controls in 19 observa-
tional studies found an inverse relationship between olive 
oil consumption and the prevalence of breast of digestive 
system cancers [59]. Contradictory results were observed 
between intake of olive oil or its components and preva-
lence or mortality for prostate cancer [60–63].
Vegetarian diet
The vegetarian diet includes various dietary patterns 
that have as common basis the abstinence from the meat 
and fish. The choice of vegetarianism in ancient times 
depended mostly on religious choices and it was first dis-
cussed in the cultures of ancient Greece and India [64]. In 
Western Countries, where meat and poultry are the base 
of protein intake, it is becoming increasingly popular in 
recent times, both for ethical reasons, against intensive 
farming and the pollution caused by large animals’ flatu-
lence, and health reasons related to the carcinogenicity of 
red and processed meat [65]. From a theoretical point of 
view, a diet rich in antioxidants, fibres, monounsaturated 
and polyunsaturated fatty acids, should decrease cancer 
incidence and mortality. However, scientific evidence 
about the anti-cancer effect of vegetarianism remains 
scarce compared with the data available for MD and the 
results are complicated to explain.
A meta-analysis of nine studies conducted on 686,629 
individuals with breast (n = 3441), colorectal (n = 4062) 
or prostate (n = 1932) cancer did not find any association 
 Page 6 of 18
Soldati et al. J Transl Med  (2018) 16:75 
between vegetarian compared to a non-vegetarian diet. 
Instead, an association was found between colorectal 
cancer and a semi-vegetarian diet, defined as a low con-
sumption of meat (more than once per month but less 
than once per week) and also with a pesco-vegetarian 
diet, defined as consumption of fish more than once per 
month [66]. From these results, it appears that there is 
a high heterogeneity among dietary patterns defined as 
vegetarianism, which may confuses the analysis. Among 
them, some are considered healthy because they come 
close to the guidelines focusing on reducing non-com-
municable diseases [67–71] while others deviate from 
them. Strict vegans, who exclude from their diet all ani-
mal products, including eggs, dairy and honey, undergo 
deficiencies of vitamin B12, zinc, iron and n-3 poly unsat-
urated fatty acids (PUFA) [72], while controversial is the 
deficiency of vitamin D, which depends not only from the 
intake mainly from fish and seafood, but also from expo-
sure to sunlight and skin tone [73, 74]. In this and other 
type of vegetarianism, including raw veganism and frui-
tarianism, supplements of these elements are necessary 
to avoid serious health problems.
Despite these limitations, a systematic review and 
meta-analysis including 86 cross-sectional and ten cohort 
prospective studies about vegetarian and vegan diets, 
found a significant association with incidence of cancer 
(− 8%). However, the number of studies taken in account 
was limited: 2 cross-sectional and 3 prospective studies 
for a total of 38,053 patients. Moreover, no significant 
reduction was observed for breast, colorectal, prostate 
and lung cancer in comparison to omnivores [75]. These 
most recent results, cannot, be considered definitive, 
both for the limited number of studies and subjects, and 
because do not take into account the duration of the veg-
etarian or vegan diet, which is undoubtedly an important 
element. Moreover, also individual defined as omnivores 
include great variability in type, frequency and amount of 
meat consumed.
Japanese diet
Japanese people have the greatest life expectancy and 
their diet is considered one of the healthiest in the 
world, low in cholesterol and in caloric intake [76]. But 
the strengths of this diet may depend on other compo-
nents. Characteristic among Japanese diet is the wide 
consumption of green tea, rich in flavonoids, which are 
phytochemicals with antioxidant and anticancer proper-
ties [77]. Moreover, high consumption of vegetables, and 
among them miso soup, containing wakame (Undaria 
pinnatifida), a healthy sea vegetable, rich in fucoxanthin, 
a carotenoid has great antioxidant and anticancer activ-
ity [78]. The main source of proteins is fish, especially 
salmon and tuna fish, sources of also n-3 PUFA. These 
fatty acids seem to play a critical role in affecting the inci-
dence and growth of colorectal cancer [79], breast can-
cer treatment efficacy [80], and prevention of prostate 
cancer [81]. Another common protein source consists of 
the high intake of soybean products such as tofu. A large 
body of literature demonstrated anticancer effects of soy 
and its components: proteins, isoflavones and saponins 
in in vitro and epidemiological studies [82–85]. In con-
clusion, similar for the studies in western populations, in 
which the quality of diet is linked to a lower mortality for 
chronic diseases including cancer, adherence to Japanese 
diet is associated to similar outcomes [76].
Very low calorie and ketogenic diets
Diets restricted in calories are recognized as a sound 
therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of chronic dis-
eases, including cancer, and increase life expectancy [86]. 
Aside caloric restriction, low protein consumption can 
impair tumour genesis and inflammation [87]. The effect 
of short-term starvation is related to the decrease of 
serum levels of glucose and insulin growth factor (IGF), 
which exerts a potent tumorigenic effect on a variety of 
cancer cells by promoting proliferation and inhibiting 
apoptosis [88].
Lately, several studies have demonstrated positive ther-
apeutic effects of very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets 
(VLCKD) on different diseases [89]. Some findings sug-
gested that VLCKD could delay cancer progression due 
its composition [89, 90]. Ketogenic diets are poor in car-
bohydrates (usually less than 50 g/day) and, consequently, 
more abundant in lipids and proteins. Under this condi-
tion, the human body makes use of other mechanisms 
to generate energy, producing ketone bodies as it occurs 
in food deprivation. In the last phase of food depriva-
tion and ketogenic diets, glucose become scarce and fat-
derived ketone bodies become the most prevalent source 
of energy, promoting a decrease of reactive oxygen spe-
cies production and cell growth/proliferation [91, 92].
High glucose blood levels can increase cancer risk 
since glucose is the energy source for human cell prolif-
eration, including cancerous cells [92]. Reduced glucose 
and insulin/IGF-1 concentrations are capable to sensi-
tize tumor cells and improve resistance of normal cells 
[93]. Responsible for insulin signaling, Akt is known to 
induce resistance to apoptosis, changes in the cancer cells 
metabolism, reduction of beta-oxidation and increased 
synthesis of lipid in the cytosol [94].
Therefore, since carbohydrates are well-known to 
increase either serum glucose and insulin, a personal-
ized VLCKD, composed in its majority by fat rather than 
protein, could play an important role in the treatment of 
oncologic patients [95, 96], also increasing normal cells 
protection against chemotherapy, as already observed in

fasting cycles retarding growth of tumors and sensitizing 
a range of cancer cell types to chemotherapy [88].
Microbiota influence on diet
In the course of evolution, several microbial ecosystems 
developed and created a symbiotic mutualism between 
host and microbes [97–99].
In humans, there are almost 3 × 1013 eukaryotic cells 
and 3.9 × 1013 microorganisms [100], and the microbiota 
exhibits considerable intra- and inter-personal variations, 
colonizing different habitats as oral cavity, gut, vagina, 
respiratory tract and skin. Moreover, bacterial genes 
encompass together more than 100 times the number of 
genes in the human genome [101, 102].
An example of symbiotic proficiency is observable 
in the human lower gastrointestinal tract that contains 
approximately 1 kg of bacteria, with a total genome 
(microbiome) 100 times that of the host [103] represent-
ing the largest source of non-self-antigens for the human 
organism [104].
In recent years, it has become clear that the gut micro-
biota plays an important, if not crucial, role in human’s 
physiology and in the development of chronic diseases, 
including cancer, in particular in the colorectal carci-
noma [105], due to its ability to stimulate immunity as 
an endocrine organ, able to regulate inflammatory, meta-
bolic, and infectious diseases [101, 102, 106].
It is now clear that the influence of the microbiota on 
cancer development is dependent on the maintenance of 
chronic inflammation or upon direct effects on immune 
cells [107]. In fact, observing a diet that nurtures a 
healthy gut microbiota is critical to human healthy and 
macronutrients, fibres and some micronutrients have an 
impact on it [108].
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobac-
teria and Verrucomicrobia represent the major phyla 
harbouring our intestine. Most predominant genera are 
Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Eubacte-
rium, Ruminococcus, Peptidococcus, Peptidostreptococ-
cus and Bifidobacterium [109, 110], and it is possible to 
categorized 3 enterotypes, Bacteroides, Prevotella and 
Ruminococcus on the basis of the microbiota profile 
[111–115]. Furthermore, gut microbiota differs in males 
and females, due to the influence played by androgens 
[116].
The influence of diet on the microbiota has been exten-
sively studied, both by epidemiological and interven-
tional studies that demonstrated that a switch in diet, 
from vegetarian to carnivore, results in a change in the 
composition of the microbiome just after 24 h [117]. Fig-
ure 1 shows the impact of microbiota on the function of 
the mucosal immune system.
In general, the western diet, that is high in animal pro-
tein and saturated fatty acids and low in fibre, increases 
the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms and leads 
to a decrease of beneficial bacteria, as Bifidobacteria and 
Eubacteria [118], while potentially unhealthy bacteria, as 
Bacteroides and Clostridia, increase. High animal protein 
intake, that is often high in fat, lowers the number of Bifi-
dobacteria favoring Bacteroides and Clostridia compared 
with people who do not eat meat [119]. A high-saturated 
fatty acid diet increases anaerobic Enterotypes and Bac-
teroides [114, 119].
Symbiotic bacteria, through their metabolic func-
tion, are able to release essential nutrients, metaboliz-
ing indigestible compounds [120]. People consuming 
polyunsaturated fats possess Ruminococcus in their gut, 
whereas those consuming high carbohydrate and simple 
sugars are colonized predominantly by Bacteroides. In 
the microbiota of obese and overweight people, a reduc-
tion of Bifidobacterium was observed, with an increase 
of Firmicutes (Roseburia spp., Eubacterium rectale, and 
Ruminococcus bromii), and Proteobacteria, that metabo-
lize dietary plant polysaccharides with a consequent gain 
in energy availability [121, 122]. Conversely, vegan and 
vegetarian diets, rich in fermentable nutrients, induce a 
microbial flora rich in healthy species [123–125].
The impact of microbiota composition 
on the immune system
As reported by Stitaya Sirisinha, “our health and prob-
ably also our behaviour and mood depend not only on 
what we eat or what we do (lifestyle behaviour), but also 
on what we host” [126].
Researchers focused attention on the relationship 
between gut microbiota and brain development and func-
tion, discovering a bidirectional communication between 
them, defined a microbiota-gut-brain axis. Recent data 
highlighted the efficacy of probiotics for prevention and/
or treatment of certain eating behaviour disorders and 
anxiety [127, 128]. Moreover, microbiota diversity plays a 
crucial role in the maturation and development and func-
tions of both innate and adaptive immune system, [129, 
130]. It seems, that the human genome cannot encode all 
the information necessary to guarantee our health and 
that this deficiency is overcome by molecules secreted by 
the intestinal microbiome (the collective genomes of the 
microbiota) [129, 131].
The interaction between commensal microbes and 
immune system is bidirectional, and intestinal bacterial 
species can impact the function of one another [132] (see 
Fig. 1).
Microbiota can act on several cell types, as intraepithe-
lial lymphocytes, predominantly dominated by T cells of 
the γδ phenotype, and dendritic cells, and stimulate the 
 Page 8 of 18
Soldati et al. J Transl Med  (2018) 16:75 
gut-associated lymphoid tissues, smaller Peyer’s patches 
and mesenteric lymphonodes, isolated lymphoid folli-
cles, Toll-like receptors, expression of α- and β-defensins, 
cathericidin LL-37, and other antimicrobial proteins. The 
ultrastructure of the gut is related to microbiota, and 
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can secrete and respond 
to various cytokines and chemokines and express mol-
ecules interacting with lymphocytes [133]. On the other 
hand, IECs secrete mucins and AMPs that limit micro-
bial interaction with epithelial cells. IECs express CD1d, 
an MHC-like molecule that presents glycolipids to NK T 
cells and after the activation of STAT3 produce the anti-
inflammatory IL-10 [134].
Gram-negative 
commensal 
organism 
Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron, but not the Gram-positive microbe, 
Bifidobacterium longum, stimulates IECs to produce 
antimicrobial peptide (AMP), α- and β-defensins, C-type 
lectin (e.g., regenerating islet-derived protein, REGIIIγ), 
cathelicidins, lectins and a number of hydrolytic enzymes 
[135], and to increase the expression of matrix metal-
loproteinase (MMP) needed for cleavage of inactive 
pro-defensins to active defensins [136]. Moreover, Son-
nenburg et al. highlighted that B. longum can increase 
the diversity of polysaccharides that can be degraded by 
B. thetaiotaomicron [137]. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 
down-regulate inflammatory response because interfere 
with the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-
enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), in the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated 
receptor-γ 
(PPARγ)-dependent 
pathway [138].
Some commensal bacteria can secrete mediators that 
exert anti-inflammatory activity, as TGF-β, thymic stro-
mal lymphopoietin, IL-25, IL-33 and IL-10. They also 
endow DCs and resident macrophages (CX3CR1+) T 
cell differentiation toward regulatory TREG cells and Th2 
phenotypes.
Bacteroides fragilis produced immunosuppressive poly-
saccharide A that can also function as a TLR2 ligand, thus 
promoting TREG cell differentiation [139]. Moreover, 
TREG cell differentiation is observed after production 
of TGF-β due to signal by some species of Clostridium 
in and after the recognition of G protein-coupled recep-
tors present on T cells and IECs by the short chain fatty 
acids (e.g. butyrate, propionate and acetate) produced as 
metabolites by microbiota [140]. Tolerogenic DCs pro-
duce TGF-β and RA that stimulate the development of 
TREG cells [141].
There is a crosstalk among innate lymphoid cells (ILCs; 
ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3) located in mucosal epithelium, 
local immune cells and epithelial cells. ILC2s secrete 
Fig. 1 The role of dietary patterns on microbiota composition and immune system function. Dysbiosis induces cytokines production and 
NF-kB-mediated local inflammation, promoting tumorigenesis. In the left part of the figure are shown the main mechanisms of interaction between 
a healthy diet, a balanced gut bacterial flora and the immune system. In the right part are shown alterations of the immune system, intestinal barrier 
and pathological pathways due to an unhealthy diet and unbalanced gut microbiota

Soldati et al. J Transl Med  (2018) 16:75 
interleukin as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, and ILC3 s 
secrete predominantly IL-17 and IL-22 that activate the 
epithelial and goblet cells to secrete AMPs and mucins 
able to influence the composition of the microbiota.
Certain components of the inflammasome, such 
as Nod-like receptor pyrin domain 6, are selectively 
expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and can influence 
the composition of the intestinal microbiota by inducing 
IL-18 expression [142, 143].
As an immuno-compromised state characterized by 
pathobiont overgrowth leads to the loss of barrier integ-
rity, hyperinflammation, dysplasia, and tumorigenesis, 
it is important to develop new strategies for the treat-
ment of diseases associated with low-grade chronic 
inflammation.
Fusobacterium 
nucleatum, 
enterotoxigenic 
Bacte-
roides fragilis, and colibactin-producing Escherichia coli 
generate an inflammatory environment and promote 
tumorigenesis, such as in colorectal cancer, due to the 
development of the inflammasome and activation of the 
NF-κB pathway [144].
However, many of the anti-inflammatory food compo-
nents, as dietary fibers, omega-3 fatty acid and some vita-
mins, tryptophan and tryptophan-derived products, and 
SCFAs are able to activate the production of anti-inflam-
matory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-22) through binding to 
the arylhydrocarbon receptor and the G-protein-coupled 
receptors [145].
On the other hand, some Lactobacillus strains (L. casei, 
L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. 
bulgaricus) have inhibitory effects on pathogens, due to 
the modulatory action of TGFβ-expressing T cells, den-
dritic cells and macrophages, and production of IL-10 
[146, 147].
Moreover, Bacteroides spp., Lactococcus lactis, Bifido-
bacterium animalis subsp. Lactis exert and antinflamma-
tory activity, with the production of nitric oxide, shifting 
the Th1/Th2 balance, and preventing carcinogenesis, 
through restoration of impaired IL-12 production. They 
have also direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells [148, 
149].
Interaction between molecules or factors produced by 
the intestinal probiotics during food metabolism, such as 
short chain fatty acids, p40 molecule, bacteriocin, poly-
saccharide A, could be considered as postbiotics. Post-
biotics may be able to act directly or indirectly on the 
metabolic processes of the host, improving epithelial 
barrier function. For example, it has been demonstrated 
that lactocepin produced and secreted by L. paracasei, 
is able to inactivated CXCL-10, a lymphocyte recruit-
ing chemokine produced by epithelial cells. Lactobacil-
lus plantarum is able to increase production of mucins 
by the goblet cells. More generally, protein released by 
probiotics, as S-layer protein A and polysaccharide A are 
able to decrease inflammatory process, regulating the 
balance between pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines by 
DC and T cells [150].
Finally, understanding how to best manipulate the 
microbiome, controlling therefore the human immune 
system and its dysregulation, or controlling the effects of 
postbiotics in the symbiotic status represents an impor-
tant opportunity to develop new drugs, and combin-
ing probiotic supplements, with vaccines and cancer 
immunotherapies.
Functional supplements
Dietary natural compounds, also called phytochemicals, 
can influence cancer risk and tumour behaviour, inter-
fering in all carcinogenic steps, invasion, proangiogenic 
and the metastatic phase. Therefore, phytochemicals rep-
resent a valuable source of effective immune modulators 
for novel antitumor therapeutic strategies.
Furthermore, advances in nutrigenetics, as individual 
genetic “make-up” [151–154], and nutrigenomics [155], 
as the modulation of the whole genome expression 
induced by food, sustain the crosslink among nutrients–
genes–cancer. Moreover, dietary phytochemicals are 
recognized to activate or suppress oncogenic noncoding 
regulatory RNAs network (miRNA), or restore normal 
expression level of miRNAs with tumour suppressor role 
[156–158].
Due to the fact that inflammation contributes signifi-
cantly to the development of chronic non-communicable 
diseases (CNCD), including cancer [159, 160], it is of fun-
damental importance to select dietary phytochemicals 
that can modulate expression genes and miRNAs related 
to inflammasome pathway leading to regulate target 
immune systems in defined tumor microenvironments.
Inflammation results from an over-reacting immune 
response and is characterized by the production of dif-
ferent reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and pro-inflam-
matory mediators including lipid mediators, notably 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and cytokines like 
TNF-alpha and IL-6, which in turn aggravate inflamma-
tion and lead to excessive damage to host tissues [161, 
162]. These activate specific patterns of gene expression 
that in turn act to alter the hormetic mechanisms, i.e. 
the biphasic dose response phenomenon, characterized 
by a low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition, that 
increase cellular stress resistance. This alteration pro-
duces tissue degeneration, loss of function of one or more 
organs, activating oncogene products and/or inactivating 
tumour-suppressor proteins [161].
Several observational studies have provided scientific 
evidence that diets rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, 
whole grains, fish, low-fat dairy products, and hazelnut, 
 Page 10 of 18
Soldati et al. J Transl Med  (2018) 16:75 
reducing the oxidative processes and inflammation 
[45, 163] are associated with lower incidence of CNCD 
[164–166]. Moreover, dietary supplementation with 
antioxidants, including minerals, vitamins and phenolic 
compounds obtained from plants, exert health benefits, 
maintaining a desirable pro oxidative/anti-oxidative bal-
ance [165–168].
Omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acid, fat-soluble bioactives 
with nutraceutical property (tocopherols and phytoster-
ols), vitamins (vitamins B1, B2, B6, niacin, thiamin and 
α-tocopherol, the most active form of vitamin E), essen-
tial minerals (selenium, potassium, magnesium, phos-
phorus, manganese, iron, zinc and copper, and a low level 
of sodium), essential amino acids, antioxidant phenolics 
(caffeic acid), dietary fiber (soluble), flavonoids (as cate-
chin, epicatechin, quercetin, procyanidins, phenolic acids 
(as gallic and protocatechuic acids) can be considered 
functional foods, that exert physiological benefits beyond 
basic nutritional function [45, 46, 165, 166].
Because there is a plethora of phytochemicals that 
appear to be protective against cancer and CNCD, and, 
in the meantime, there are multiple pathways that may 
be influenced simultaneously, we have selected some 
examples of nutraceuticals that act against inflammation 
and oxidative stress.
Figure 2 shows the dietary impact on immune system.
Vitamin E, a fat-soluble physiological antioxidant 
belonging to α, β, γ, δ –tocopherol family (α T, β T, γ T, 
δ T) and α, β, γ, δ -tocotrienol (α TE, β TE, γ TE, δ TE) 
[168] are potent antioxidants with lipoperoxyl radical-
scavenging activities. Specific forms of vitamin E, such as 
γ T, δ T and tocotrienols (esp. γ TE), have anti-inflamma-
tory and antioxidant effects by inducing superoxide dis-
mutase, quinoneoxidoreductase, glutathione peroxidase 
and by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), nuclear 
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κ B), TNF-α, cytokines as interleukin (IL-1, IL-6, 
IL-8), and inducible nitric oxide synthase [169–178] (see 
Table 1).
It has been demonstrated that the hydroxytirosol 
(2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) ethanol, 3,4-DHPEA, HT) has 
positive effects on antioxidant enzymes activity, against 
oxidative stress, and DNA damage [179]. Oral adminis-
tration of gastro-resistant capsules containing 15 mg/
day of HT significantly increased antioxidant biomark-
ers, like thiols groups and total antioxidant status, while

drastically reduced nitrite and nitrate, malondialdehyde 
(MDA), and peroxidation of low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol serum concentrations. These results were 
related to the significant up-regulation of superoxide dis-
mutase-1 gene expression [180] (see Table 1).
Recently, Bhandari et al. showed that plant extract from 
Allium wallichii, rich in flavonoids, steroids, glycosides 
and terpenoids exhibits a good cytotoxicity towards Lym-
phoma, and moderate cytotoxic activity towards prostate 
cancer (PC3), cervical cancer (HeLa) and breast cancer 
(MCF-7) cell lines, and could be an important candidate 
to be used as an anticancer agent [181].
Epidemiological studies suggest that a higher flavo-
noid intake is associated with a lower cancer risk [182], 
affecting all three stages of carcinogenesis (initiation, 
promotion, and progression) by modulating the sig-
nal transduction pathways, controlling cell division and 
growth, apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and 
metastasis. Flavonoid supplementation is therefore con-
sidered a promising anticancer therapy [183].
Although food supplies with native forms of phyto-
chemicals can achieve the maximal antitumor effect, 
clinical effects of these compounds can be reached at 
high concentrations, impossible to be retrieved from nat-
ural sources. Therefore, efforts to synthesize new deriva-
tives are in progress [184].
Considering the complex, often synergistic, beneficial 
effects of mixtures of bioactive compounds present in 
a healthy diet, phytochemicals may be a novel adjuvant 
approach useful in combination with chemotherapeutics 
for overcoming drug resistance or tumour metastasis in 
therapy against cancer.
Anti‑neoplastic activities exerted by polyphenols
In the light of the aforementioned concepts, targeting of 
inflammatory cells or neutralization of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in the context of cancer may represent a plau-
sible innovative approach to retard or abrogate tumour 
growth and influence the effectiveness of anti-cancer 
immunotherapy. According to large population studies, 
there is evidence that the daily use of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin to prevent cardiovas-
cular risk, significantly diminished the risk of colorectal 
and receptor-positive breast cancer [185]. However, the 
practical limit of this study is the unease of applying this 
therapeutic approach to healthy people in the absence 
of cardiovascular risk. On the other hand, use of mono-
clonal antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(TNF-alpha and IL-6) in different cancers led to sporadic 
disease stabilization, thus suggesting the poor efficiency 
of such a therapeutic strategy [20].
With regard to nutritional interventions in cancer, 
the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of 
polyphenols have been object of intensive investigation. 
Daily ingestion of polyphenols with fruits, vegetables, 
cereals, extra virgin olive oil, wine, tea and coffee has also 
prompted further studies on their anti-cancer activity.
Oolyphenols exhibit broad structural variation in 
their backbone as well as primary and secondary struc-
tures due to differences in methylation, glycosylation and 
hydroxylation, which result in diverse biological activity 
[186].
Anti-inflammatory activities displayed by polyphe-
nols, especially flavonoids extracted from red wine 
or fermented grape marc (FGM), depend on multiple 
mechanisms.
Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally 
occurring polyphenol produced by some plants as a 
self-defence agent, acts as a phytoalexin, and it is con-
sidered to have beneficial effects also on human health. 
Resveratrol has a wide range of healing and preven-
tive properties, acting as a cardio-protective, neuro-
protective and antitumor, antioxidant agent [187]. 
Furthermore, resveratrol has been shown to induce 
anti-oxidant enzymes (e.g. glutathione peroxidase, 
heme-oxygenase, superoxide dismutase) that attenuate 
oxidative stress [188].
Resveratrol is a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 
[189], and, therefore, a potent chemo-preventive agent 
against cancer (prostate, breast, brain, endometrium, 
rectum, pancreas, skin, lung, ovary and bladder can-
cer), activating pro-apoptotic signalling molecules 
while inhibiting anti-apoptotic molecules [190].
In particular, resveratrol is able to activate sirtuins 
(SIRT), a class of proteins that possesses deacetylase or 
monoribosyltransferase activity [191]. SIRT acts by dea-
cytylating transcription factors, such as the tumour sup-
pressor p53, the Forkhead Box proteins family and the 
transcription factors NF-kB [192, 193]. Di Renzo et al. 
observed, after the intake of red wine, a higher expression 
of SIRT2, which was negatively correlated (P < 0.001) with 
the expression of CCL5 [194].
Red wine polyphenols, when incubated with healthy 
human monocytes have been shown to interfere with the 
binding of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bac-
teria to Toll-Like receptor (TLR)-4, likely acting by steri-
cal hindrance [195]. The activation of the transcription 
factor NF-kB was inhibited, thus leading to a dramatic 
decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
Moreover, resveratrol and its analogues pterostilbene 
(Pter; 
trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxy-stilbene), 
and 
piceatannol (Pic; trans-3,5,3′, 4′-tetrahydroxystilbene), 
regulate miRNAs, causing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, 
growth inhibition, inhibition of cell viability, migration, 
and invasion in various types of cancer: 71 miRNAs are 
overexpressed in lung cancer cells, 46 miRNAs target

TGFβ pathways in colon cancer cell, miR-125b-5p, miR-
200c-3p, miR-409-3p, miR-122-5p and miR-542-3p are 
involved in breast cancer cells [195, 196].
Curcumin, green tea, polyphenols [epigallo-catechin-
gallate (EPGC)], quercetin and resveratrol are the most 
effective anti-cancer compounds as they inhibit NF-kB 
activation [196]. The administration of FGM-derived 
polyphenols to mice affected by experimental coli-
tis dramatically reduced biomarkers of inflammation 
such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta [197]. Thus, one can 
hypothesize that polyphenols can impede secretion of 
cytokines usually released in the tumour microenviron-
ment. Finally, FGM-derived polyphenols activate in vitro 
peripheral healthy human Foxp3+ TREG cells inducing 
the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, 
and polarizing immune responses toward a tolerogenic 
pathway [198] (see Fig. 2).
From an immunological point of view, polyphenols 
from blueberry powder were very effective either in vitro 
or in vivo at inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation 
and metastasis, down-regulating IL-6 production [199]. 
Similarly, curcumin could inhibit the metastatic dis-
semination of breast cancer, reducing the release of 
CXCL1/2 [200]. EGCG from green tea induced apopto-
sis in gamma-irradiated breast cancer cells via inhibition 
of NF-kB [201]. Xanthohumol, a prenylated flavonoid 
extracted from hops, when inoculated to nude mice bear-
ing breast cancer xenografts, reduced macrophage infil-
trates, increased apoptosis, reduced micro-vessel number 
and down regulated NF-kB expression [202].
Regulation of ROS by polyphenols is another potential 
anti-tumour mechanism. Of note, polyphenols are able 
to scavenge not only ROS but also RNS, peroxynitrous 
acid, chlorine species and hypochlorous acid by target-
ing NF-kB and mitogen activated protein kinase-related 
pathways [203]. Experimentally, Biochanin A, an isofla-
vonoid extracted from red clover, prevents induction of 
mammary gland cancer in pre-puberal rats exposed to 
carcinogenic agents thanks to the reduction of oxida-
tive stress [204]. Resveratrol inhibits 17 beta-estradiol-
induced carcinogenesis by up-regulating the expression 
of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2, which has 
anti-oxidant effects [205]. Similarly, curcumin reduced 
proliferation of breast cancer cells via nuclear transloca-
tion of Nrf-2 [206]. EGCG at low concentrations reduced 
ROS generation in response to exposure to environmen-
tal carcinogens via up regulation of NADPH-quinone 
oxidoreductase-1, a detoxification enzyme in phase 2 
[177]. Conversely, evidence has been provided that poly-
phenols are also able to exert a pro-oxidant effect, which 
leads to anti-cancer activity. For instance, in breast cancer 
cells genistein, a soy isoflavone, generated a pro-oxidant 
effect via mobilization of copper ions with DNA damage, 
increase in ROS production and, ultimately, apoptosis 
[207]. Also, curcumin and EGCG demonstrated pro-oxi-
dant effects in breast cancer cells by increasing ROS gen-
eration [208, 209].
Apoptosis of cancer cells is vigorously induced by poly-
phenols. Quercetin has been shown to induce apoptosis 
of MCF-7 breast cancer cells binding to the Fas/CD95 
receptor via activation of caspase-6 [210]. In addition, 
quercetin inhibites MDMBA-231 breast cancer cells by 
activating caspases -3/-8/-9 [211]. Apigenin enhanced 
apoptosis pathway in SKBR3 breast cancer cells via inhi-
bition of STAT3 [212]. EGCG applied to MD-MB-231 
human breast cancer cells led to reduced cell growth and 
apoptosis related to stimulation of Bcl-2-associated X 
protein (BAX), cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 
protein (PARP) and reduction of Bcl-2 expression [213]. 
Resveratrol significantly diminished growth of estro-
gen-positive breast cancer cells inducing apoptosis via 
reduction of Bcl2/BAX ratio. Genistein induced apopto-
sis of MCF-7 cells blocking the activation of Insulin-like 
Growth Factor receptor and the phosphorylation of pro-
tein kinase B (AKT) [214, 215]. Fisetin, a flavonoid pre-
sent in fruits and vegetables induced apoptosis in MCF-7 
cells activating caspases -7/-8/-9, cleaving PARP, depo-
larizing mitochondrial membrane, increasing p53 and 
breaking the plasma membrane in the absence of changes 
in DNA or phospatidylserine [216].
Autophagy occurs in many cells of the body, even 
including immune cells and represents a mechanism of 
protection against starvation, dietary restriction oxida-
tive stress and toxicity. The autophagy process implies 
catabolic lysosomal degradation, which provides an addi-
tional source of energy for the synthesis of new proteins 
and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Autophagy 
seems to play two main roles in tumour development 
[217]. Its deficiency has been shown to promote cancer 
growth, on the one hand. On the other hand, it attenuates 
necrosis and inflammation in the context of tumour, thus 
limiting stress-related chromosomal damage. As recently 
reviewed by Jin and associates [218] autophagy activates 
innate immune receptors as well as T and B lymphocytes 
for tumour destruction.
Polyphenol-induced autophagy has been consid-
ered as a mechanism of tumour cell death. Resveratrol-
induced autophagy has been shown to be very effective 
against cancer growth. This is a type of ROS-triggered 
autophagy, which occurs via up-regulation of microtu-
bule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II [219]. Con-
versely, in human colorectal cancer genetic inhibition 
of autophagy-related proteins, such as phosphoinositide 
3-kinase, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2b and 
Beclin1 abrogated resveratrol-dependent cell death [220]. 
Quercetin has been shown to induce cytoprotective 
 Page 13 of 18
Soldati et al. J Transl Med  (2018) 16:75 
autophagy in gastric cancer cells which was mediated 
by hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha and AKT- mam-
malian target of rapamycin 1 (mTOR) pathways [221]. 
Modulation of the mTOR signalling occurs via inhibi-
tion of the phosphorylation level of the ribosomal S6 
subunit through activation of p70S6 kinase and 4e-BP1 
[222]. Genistein treatment of ovarian cancer cells led to 
autophagy via inhibition of AMP-phosphpdiesterase-4A4 
and p62/sequestome 1 aggregates activated by extracellu-
lar signal-regulated kinases and protein kinase C inhibi-
tors [223].
Curcumin treated cancer cells underwent autophago-
some formation and cell death, which was mediated by 
ROS generation [224]. Similar effects have been observed 
in ovarian cancer cells and in oral squamous cell carci-
noma where besides autophagy curcumin also induced 
apoptosis inactivating Bcl-2 protein and NF-kB in cancer 
cells [225].
Conclusions
The current review highlights the various processes in 
which nutrient intake could modulate directly or indi-
rectly the immune system and/or the growth of cancer.
Most of the discussion is based on human observation 
rather than experimental animal models, as the focus of 
this review was predominantly based on epidemiological 
grounds. But several experimental models not discussed 
here extensively substantiate the conclusions.
Yet a gap of knowledge is clear. While the potential 
mechanisms that may affect immune function and con-
sequently cancer growth and responsiveness to immuno-
therapy agents have been discovered, very little is known 
about how they may affect and modulate therapies since 
parameters linking dietary habits to clinical outcome 
during immunotherapy are not routinely included.
Here we propose that in the future, detailed informa-
tion about diet, nutritional status and gut microbiota 
should be considered in correlative studies during immu-
notherapy trials identifying parameters that may be rel-
evant to outcome by studying either systemic effects 
of diet of circulating immune cells, or those that may 
affect directly the cancer microenvironment. A project 
is on going to identify the best diets for immunotherapy 
enhancement against tumours (D.I.E.T project).
