Background. Protection against herpes zoster (HZ) induced by the live attenuated zoster vaccine Zostavax (ZVL) wanes within 
3–7 years. Revaccination may renew protection. We assessed whether (re)vaccination with the adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine can-
didate (HZ/su) induced comparable immune responses in previous ZVL recipients and ZVL-naive individuals (HZ-NonVac).
Methods. In an open-label, multicenter study, adults ≥65 years of age, vaccinated with ZVL ≥5 years previously (HZ-PreVac), 
were matched to ZVL-naive adults (HZ-NonVac). Participants received 2 doses of HZ/su 2 months apart. The primary objective 
of noninferiority of the humoral immune response 1 month post–dose 2 was considered demonstrated if the upper limit of the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of the adjusted anti–glycoprotein E geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio of HZ-NonVac over 
HZ-PreVac was <1.5. HZ/su cellular immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were also assessed.
Results. In 430 participants, humoral immune response to HZ/su was noninferior in HZ-PreVac compared with HZ-NonVac 
(adjusted GMC ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, .92–1.17]). Cellular immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety appeared to be comparable 
between groups. HZ/su was well-tolerated, with no safety concerns raised within 1 month post–dose 2.
Conclusions. HZ/su induces a strong immune response irrespective of prior vaccination with ZVL, and may be an attractive 
option to revaccinate prior ZVL recipients.

Herpes zoster (HZ) results from reactivation of latent varicella 
zoster virus (VZV) and usually presents as a vesicular derma-
tomal rash [1]. HZ can be followed by postherpetic neuralgia 
(PHN), chronic neuropathic pain that persists after resolution 
of the zoster rash [2]. A decline in VZV-specific cell-mediated 
immunity (CMI) increases the risk of HZ [3–5]. Because CMI 
naturally decreases with age [6], the risk of developing HZ, and 
the risk of PHN, increases as people get older. The incidence of 
HZ increases from <5 cases per 1000 person-years (PY) in those 
<50 years of age to 4–8 cases per 1000 PY in adults between 50 
and 59 and >10 cases per 1000 PY in adults >70 years of age [7, 8]. 
 
Half of all HZ cases occur in adults aged >60 years, and the 
lifetime risk is 50% in those surviving to 85 years of age [9]. The 
risk of developing PHN increases from 5% to 14% in HZ patients 
aged 50–59 years to >15% in those >70 years of age [10, 11].
Many HZ complications, but not PHN, can be prevented 
with antivirals if administered shortly after disease onset [1, 12]. 
Vaccination of at-risk populations is a cost-effective approach to 
prevent HZ and its complications [13]. The live attenuated zoster 
vaccine (ZVL) licensed for use in healthy adults >50 years of age 
(Zostavax, a trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corporation) 
reduces HZ incidence by 70% in people between 50 and 59 years 
of age [14]. In the United States, vaccination is currently recom-
mended to prevent HZ in people >60 years of age [9] and the effi-
cacy of ZVL in this population is lower: 51% in people >60 years 
and 38% in people >70 years of age [15]. In adults >60 years of age, 
efficacy against HZ declines to 30.6% in the sixth year [16] and to 
21.1 % between 7 and 11 years postvaccination [17]. The vaccine 
efficacy against PHN wanes from 66.5% shortly after vaccination 
[15] to 35.4% between 7 and 11 years postvaccination [17].
HZ/su is a subunit vaccine candidate that contains the recom-
binant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) [18, 19], adjuvanted with the 
proprietary AS01 Adjuvant System (GSK Vaccines) [20, 21].

HZ/su substantially boosts the immune response to gE [22–24]. 
Interestingly, the humoral immune response to the vaccine does 
not markedly differ between people aged 50–59 years and those 
>70 years of age [23], and both the humoral and cellular immune 
responses persist above baseline levels for at least 6 years postvacci-
nation [25]. HZ/su has shown an efficacy of >90% for the preven-
tion of HZ in people 50 years of age and older [26, 27]. Moreover, 
vaccine efficacy against HZ persisted for at least 4 years after vac-
cination, with 88% efficacy in the fourth year postvaccination [27].
ZVL continues to provide protection against the incidence of 
HZ through the first 5 years after vaccination [16], and revac-
cination after year 5 may therefore be beneficial [28]. A second 
vaccination with ZVL in previously vaccinated individuals 
10 years after the initial vaccination induces a VZV-specific CMI 
response higher than in age-matched controls who had never 
been vaccinated with ZVL, showing that immune responses 
can be boosted by a second dose [29]. However, given HZ/su’s 
high vaccine efficacy against HZ and PHN across all age groups, 
revaccinating older adults, who were previously vaccinated with 
ZVL, with HZ/su may be an attractive alternative to reduce the 
risk of HZ and PHN. This study therefore compared immu-
nogenicity and assessed reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su in 
adults aged ≥65 years who were vaccinated with ZVL ≥5 years 
before study start and group-matched ZVL-naive adults.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
This study is a phase 3, open-label, group-matched, multicenter 
study conducted in the United States. Adults ≥65 years of age who 
were previously vaccinated with ZVL (Zostavax) ≥5 years prior 
to study start (HZ-PreVac) and group-matched ZVL-naive adults 
(HZ-NonVac) were enrolled (for the distribution of matching cri-
teria at vaccination, see Supplementary Table 1). The active phase 
of the study started in March 2016 (first vaccination) and was 
completed in August 2016 (1 month post–dose 2). The extended 
safety follow-up is expected to be completed in August 2017.
Participants in the HZ-NonVac group were group-matched to 
those in the HZ-PreVac group according to the predefined vari-
ables age (65–69, 70–79, ≥80 years), sex, race (white, African 
American, Hispanic, and other), and medical condition. Medical 
conditions were ranked in a hierarchical order (immune-mediated 
diseases, diabetes mellitus, current depression, pulmonary disor-
ders, heart conditions, none of these medical conditions), and par-
ticipants were matched according to the highest-ranked condition.
Study participants were men or women aged ≥65 years at the 
time of the first vaccination with HZ/su. Adults eligible for inclu-
sion in the HZ-PreVac group had received ZVL at least 5 years 
prior to study start. Participants provided written informed con-
sent before study start. Adults were excluded from participation 
if they had received or were scheduled to receive a live vaccine 
within 30 days, had received any investigational or nonregistered 
drug or vaccine within 30 days, had received immunosup-
pressants or other immune-modifying drugs for >14 consec-
utive days within 180 days, or had received any long-acting 
immune-modifying drugs within 180 days before the first HZ/
su vaccination. Adults with a history of HZ, or adults scheduled 
to receive a HZ vaccine other than HZ/su, as well as adults with 
a history of any reaction or hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine 
components, were excluded from participation.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the 
institutional review boards (Chesapeake institutional review 
board [IRB], Columbia, MD; Office of Human Research IRB, 
Philadelphia, PA; Kaiser Permanente, Northern California 
IRB, Oakland, CA;  Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation 
IRB, Marshfield, WI). The study was conducted in accord-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of 
Good Clinical Practice, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.
gov (NCT02581410) and available at http://www.gsk- 
clinicalstudyregister.com (study ID: 201198).
Study Vaccines
Study participants in both groups received 2 intramuscular 
doses of HZ/su 2 months apart. Participants were vaccinated in 
the deltoid region of the nondominant arm. Each dose of HZ/
su contained 50 μg of the gE antigen and the GSK proprietary 
AS01B Adjuvant System (containing 50 μg of 3-O-desacyl-4’-
monophosphoryl lipid, 50 μg of Quillaja saponaria Molina, 
fraction 21 [QS21, Licensed by GSK from Antigenics LLC, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc], and liposome).
Study Objectives and Measures
Study Objectives
The co-primary objectives of the study were to compare the 
humoral immune responses 1 month after dose 2 of HZ/su 
between the HZ-PreVac and HZ-NonVac groups, and to evalu-
ate safety and reactogenicity up to 1 month after dose 2 of HZ/
su in both study groups. The secondary study objectives also pre-
sented in this manuscript were to assess the humoral and CMI 
responses to the HZ/su vaccine at baseline (prevaccination), and 
1 month post–dose 1 and post–dose 2 in both study groups.
Assessment of Immunogenicity
Blood samples for the immunogenicity assessments were col-
lected at baseline and at 1 month after the first and second vac-
cine doses (Figure 1). Anti-gE antibody concentrations were 
measured by anti-gE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 
assay cutoff was 97 mIU/mL. CMI responses were assessed by 
intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry, as detailed 
previously [25]. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
were stimulated in vitro with gE peptides, after which frequen-
cies of gE-specific CD4+ T cells expressing at least 2 activation 
markers (here referred to as CD42+) of the 4 markers assessed 
(interferon-γ, interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor–α, and CD40 
ligand) were determined.

Assessment of Safety
Solicited adverse events (AEs) were reported on diary cards 
provided to study participants and recorded for 7 days (days 
0–6) after each vaccination. Solicited AEs were recorded as 
local (injection site pain, redness, and swelling) or systemic 
(fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, 
and shivering). Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 30 days 
after each vaccination, and included any AE not recorded as a 
solicited AE. The intensity of all AEs was graded on a scale of 
1 to 3. A grade 3 (severe) unsolicited AE was defined as pre-
venting normal activities. Solicited AEs were defined as grade 3 
when preventing normal everyday activity (for pain, headache, 
fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, shivering), when 
presenting a surface diameter >100 mm (for redness and swell-
ing), or when presenting as a tympanic/oral/axillary tempera-
ture >39.0°C (for fever). All solicited local AEs were considered 
causally related to vaccination. The causality of all other AEs 
was assessed by the investigator.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and potential immune-medi-
ated diseases (pIMDs) were recorded for the entire duration of 
the study, but only findings from the active phase of the study 
(first vaccination visit through 30 days post–dose 2) are pre-
sented here. A full list of pIMDs is provided in Supplementary 
Table 2.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS software 
version 9.3 TS1M2 on Windows SDD 4.3.3.
Immunogenicity data were analyzed on the according to pro-
tocol cohort, which included all participants who complied with

included in the study. During the active phase of the study, participants visited the study center at specified timepoints for a blood draw to determine immune parameters 
(months 0, 1, and 3), and to receive the study vaccine (months 0 and 2). Only data collected during the active phase of the study are reported in this manuscript. The safety 
follow-up was expected to continue until August 2017. During this safety follow-up, participants are being followed for safety through monthly phone calls. A final blood draw 
is scheduled to take place at 12 months after the second dose of study vaccine. Abbreviations: HZ-NonVac, participants who never received the live attenuated zoster vaccine;

analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used on log-trans-
formed antibody concentration data and included the vac-
cine group and the group-matching categories as fixed effects. 
Adjusted means and a difference of means between both study 
groups were calculated together with 2-sided confidence inter-
vals (CIs) and back-transformed to the original units to provide 
adjusted geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and GMC 
ratio. Per protocol, noninferiority of the response was demon-
strated if the upper limit of the 2-sided CI of the adjusted GMC 
ratio of the HZ-NonVac over the HZ-PreVac group at 1 month 
post–dose 2 (active phase) was <1.5. Secondary immunoge-
nicity endpoint data, including CMI data presented here, were 
evaluated using descriptive analyses. For descriptive humoral 
immunogenicity data, the 95% CI for GMCs was obtained for 
each group separately. First, a 95% CI for the mean of log-trans-
formed concentrations was obtained, under the assumption 
that log-transformed values were normally distributed with 
unknown variance. Subsequently, the 95% CI for GMCs was cal-
culated by anti-log transformation of the previously calculated 
95% CI for the mean of log-transformed concentrations. For 
descriptive cellular immunogenicity, the frequency of gE-spe-
cific CD42+ T cells was calculated as the difference between the 
frequency of CD42+ T cells, stimulated in vitro with the gE anti-
gen and those stimulated with culture alone. Descriptive statis-
tics (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) of CD42+ T cells were tabulated 
by group at all timepoints.
Safety and reactogenicity data were evaluated using descrip-
tive analyses. Safety data were analyzed in the total vaccinated 
cohort of participants who received at least 1 dose of HZ/su.
Based on variability in the anti-gE antibody response to HZ/
su as seen in previous clinical trials, a sample size of 190 eval-
uable participants per study group would demonstrate nonin-
feriority in humoral immunogenicity with at least 99% power.
RESULTS
Participants
A total of 822 older adults were screened for participation in 
this study. Of these, 215 people not previously vaccinated were 
matched according to prespecified criteria (age, sex, geographic 
ancestry, and medical condition) to 215 people who had pre-
viously been vaccinated with ZVL (Figure 2). Of the 430 vac-
cinated participants, 425 (98.8%) completed the active phase 
of the study. Demographic characteristics were comparable for 
participants in both study groups and are presented in Table 1. 
Details of participant matching are provided in Supplementary 
Table 1.
Immunogenicity
Prior to the first vaccination, all evaluable participants in the 
HZ-PreVac group and 98% of evaluable participants in the 
HZ-NonVac group were seropositive for anti-gE antibodies 
(anti-gE concentration above the assay cutoff of 97 mIU/mL). 
Anti-gE antibody GMCs appeared similar at baseline in both 
study groups and increased markedly after both vaccine doses 
(Figure 3A and Supplementary Table 3). Anti-gE antibody 
GMCs post–dose 2 were comparable for both study groups, with 
an adjusted GMC ratio of 1.04 (Table 2). The primary immuno-
logic study objective was met, as the upper limit of the adjusted

GMC ratio of the HZ-NonVac group over the HZ-PreVac group 
was below the 1.5 cutoff (Table 2).
At baseline, the median CD42+ T-cell frequency appeared 
similar in both groups. After dose 1, median frequencies of 
gE-specific CD42+ T cells increased in both groups, and 
a more substantial overall increase was seen after dose 
2 (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 3). No difference 
in CD42+ T-cell frequency was apparent between study 
groups.
Reactogenicity and Safety
The percentage of participants reporting all-grade solicited local 
and systemic AEs, as well as grade 3 solicited AEs, was compa-
rable between study groups (Table 3). The most common local 
solicited AE reported after each HZ/su dose was pain. The most 
common systemic solicited AE reported after each dose was

fatigue (Figure 4). Solicited AEs were transient with a median 
duration of ≤3 days for local AEs and ≤2 days for systemic AEs.
Within 30 days after vaccination, 130 participants reported a 
total of 208 unsolicited AEs (HZ-PreVac: 125 AEs in 78 partici-
pants; HZ-NonVac: 83 AEs in 52 participants) (Table 3). At least 
1 grade 3 unsolicited symptom was reported by 14 participants 
in the HZ-PreVac group and 5 participants in the HZ-NonVac 
group. No evidence of clinically relevant differences in reported 
unsolicited AE was observed between study groups.
From study start until 30 days after the second vaccination, a 
total of 9 SAEs were reported in 8 study participants (HZ-PreVac: 
5 SAEs in 4 participants; HZ-NonVac: 4 SAEs in 4 participants). 
None of these SAEs were considered related to vaccination by 
the study investigators. No deaths occurred, and no HZ cases or 
pIMDs were reported during the active phase of the study.
DISCUSSION
This study showed that the humoral immune response to HZ/
su 1 month post–dose 2 was noninferior in adults >65 years of 
age who were vaccinated with the live attenuated zoster vac-
cine (Zostavax) >5 years ago compared with adults who never 
received this vaccination. Moreover, HZ/su was well-tolerated 
in both study groups, and no safety concerns were identified 
from first vaccination up to 1 month post–dose 2.
As in previous studies, HZ/su induced robust immune 
responses [22–24]. This study showed that prior vaccination

 HZ/su After Live-Attenuated Zoster Vaccine • JID 2017:216 (1 December) • 1349
with ZVL does not negatively impact the humoral immune 
responses to HZ/su. In addition, descriptive analyses did not 
reveal any apparent differences in CMI responses as assessed 
by CD42+ T-cell frequencies, and postvaccination increases in 
CD42+ T cell-frequencies were observed in both study groups. 
Altogether, these observations suggest that vaccination with 
HZ/su may provide protection and therefore may be an attrac-
tive candidate to revaccinate adults >65 years of age who were 
vaccinated with ZVL >5 years ago.
Consistent with previous findings, HZ/su recipients fre-
quently reported the occurrence of solicited local and systemic 
AEs. Reactogenicity, as observed during phase 2 and phase 3 
clinical trials with HZ/su [22–24, 26, 27, 30–32], was charac-
terized by transient injection site reactions, headache, fatigue, 
and myalgia. The findings in the study presented here show 
that reactogenicity after vaccination is not exacerbated in older 
adults who were previously vaccinated with ZVL. As such, reac-
togenicity in HZ/su recipients who previously received ZVL is 
unlikely to differ from ZVL-naive HZ/su recipients. Similarly, 
the number of SAEs reported were balanced between study 
groups, and no SAEs were considered related to vaccination by 
the study investigators. No fatal SAEs or pIMDs were reported 
in either study group from first vaccination up to 1 month 
post–dose 2.
Our findings need to be evaluated in consideration of the 
strengths and limitations of the study design. The sample size 
was calculated to demonstrate noninferiority of the humoral 
immune response with 99% power, and our matching strat-
egy aimed to ensure that the selected baseline characteristics 
are similar in both groups. Nonetheless, matching resulted in 
a study population that was fully of white heritage. In addi-
tion, as the United States was one of the few countries where 
ZVL coverage was sufficiently high, only US study centers 
participated.
In sum, we show that following vaccination with HZ/su, the 
humoral response in adults who were previously vaccinated 
with the live attenuated zoster vaccine was noninferior to that 
in adults without any previous vaccination against HZ. Robust 
cellular immune responses were observed in both groups. No 
clinically significant differences in safety and reactogenicity 
were observed between the 2 study groups. Taken together, HZ/
su was well tolerated and induced a strong immune response 
irrespective of prior vaccination with ZVL, and may therefore 
be an attractive option to revaccinate prior ZVL recipients.
