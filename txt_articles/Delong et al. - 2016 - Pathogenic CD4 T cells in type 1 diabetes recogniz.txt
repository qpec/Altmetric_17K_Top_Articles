Tcell–mediated destruction of insulin-producing b cells in the pancreas causes type 1 diabetes
(T1D). CD4 Tcell responses play a central role in b cell destruction, but the identity of the
epitopes recognized by pathogenic CD4 Tcells remains unknown. We found that diabetes-
inducing CD4 Tcell clones isolated from nonobese diabetic mice recognize epitopes formed by
covalent cross-linking of proinsulin peptides to other peptides present in b cell secretory
granules.These hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) are antigenic for CD4 Tcells and can be detected
by mass spectrometry in b cells. CD4 Tcells from the residual pancreatic islets of two organ
donors who had T1D also recognize HIPs. Autoreactive Tcells targeting hybrid peptides may
explain how immune tolerance is broken in T1D.
T
ype 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune
disease mediated by T cells responding to
self-antigens in the pancreatic b cell. Studies
in the widely used nonobese diabetic (NOD)
mouse model of T1D have shown that CD4
T cell responses to several b cell proteins, especially
(pro)insulin, likely contribute to diabetes. It is,
however, unclear how pathogenic T cells escape
thymic deletion and how (pro)insulin becomes a
target of the autoimmune T cell response. To
address these questions, we have used our panel
of NOD-derived, diabetogenic CD4 T cell clones
(including the well-known BDC-2.5 clone) (1), in
conjunction with proteomic analysis of b cell ex-
tracts, to identify T cell target antigens. Recently,
we reported two new autoantigens for CD4 T
cells in autoimmune diabetes: chromogranin A
(ChgA) (2) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)
(3). Like insulin, ChgA and IAPP are b cell pro-
hormonal secretory granule proteins. WE14, a
naturally occurring peptide cleavage product of
ChgA, was found to be antigenic in both the NOD
mouse (2) and in T1D patients (4). However, be-
cause this peptide only stimulates T cells weakly, we
hypothesized that the natural ligand for patho-
genic CD4 T cells may be a modified form of ChgA.
Posttranslationalmodificationisawell-established
property of antigens in many autoimmune diseases
(5). A notable exception is T1D in which the
investigation of modified peptides as antigenic
epitopes has only just begun (6–9). Using mass
spectrometric analysis, we verified the presence
of the peptide WE14 in chromatographic frac-
tions of mouse b cell extracts, but the peptide
distribution over individual fractions did not fol-
low the antigen distribution of the natural ligand
recognized by WE14-responsive T cell clones, in-
cluding BDC-2.5 (fig. S1A, top). Conversely, the
propeptide region (C-peptide) from mouse pro-
insulin (fig. S1A, bottom) did follow the antigen
distribution profile. Furthermore, a broad panel
of shorter C-peptide fragments could also be iden-
tified in peak antigenic fractions (fig. S1B). The
matching antigen–C-peptide distributions sug-
gested that a C-peptide fragment is a component
of the natural T cell ligand. The proposed WE14/
I-Ag7 binding register (2), in which the peptide
WE14 fills only half of the major histocompati-
bility complex (MHC) II binding groove (positions
5 to 9), leaves MHC II positions 1 to 4 unoccupied.
The C-peptide fragments could fill these unoc-
cupied positions, which would lead to increased
peptide-MHC binding affinity and provide addi-
tional residues for improved TCR recognition.
We hypothesized that C-terminal carbonyl groups
of C-peptide fragments form covalent bonds with
N-terminal amino groups of naturally occurring
peptides, such as WE14, which results in the for-
mation of hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs).
To investigate the possibility that BDC-2.5 and
additional diabetogenic T cell clones from our
panel are activated by HIPs, we used a chemical
cross-linking strategy (fig. S2) to synthesize a
HIP library for screening of our murine CD4 T
cell clones (Fig. 1A). The peptides in the library
consist of insulin sequences (left peptides) on the
N-terminal side, covalently linked to peptide se-
quences from other secretory granule proteins
(right peptides) on the C-terminal side. As left
peptides, weselectedC-terminalsequences derived
from proinsulin C-peptide and insulin B-chain
fragments that were identified through mass
spectrometry in high abundance in antigenic b
cell fractions (tables S1 and S2). As right pep-
tides, we used N-terminal sequences from the
ChgA peptide WE14 and the three natural cleav-
age products (10) of IAPP (amylin, IAPP1, and
IAPP2). As shown in Fig. 1A, the hybrid peptide
LQTLAL-WSRMD, containing the C-peptide se-
quence LQTLAL on the left and the WE14 sequence
WSRMD on the right, activates all three WE14-
reactive clones (BDC-2.5, BDC-10.1, and BDC-9.46),
each of which expresses a distinct T cell receptor
(TCR). To further test our hypothesis, we screened
the peptide library with a second subset of T cell
clones (BDC-6.9 andBDC-9.3)sharingthesame TCR.
We identified a single HIP sequence (LQTLAL-
NAARD) recognized by both BDC-6.9 and BDC-
9.3 (Fig. 1A). This peptide contains, on the left, the
same C-peptide sequence LQTLAL present in
the HIP recognized by the WE14-reactive T cell
clones and, on the right, the IAPP propeptide 2
(IAPP2) sequence NAARD. We concluded that the
endogenous ligands for the two sets of pathogenic
T cell clones are HIPs containing the C-peptide
sequence LQTLAL on the left side and the natural
cleavage products, WE14 or IAPP2, on the right side.
To confirm the antigenicity of the peptides
identified from the library, we obtained commer-
cially synthesized preparations of 2.5 and 6.9HIPs
(HIPs antigenic for BDC-2.5 and BDC-6.9) span-
ning the full-length insulin II (Ins2) C-peptide
fragment ending in LQTLAL on the N-terminal
ends and the entire WE14 or IAPP2 sequences on
the C-terminal ends (see peptide section in Mate-
rials and Methods). WE14-reactive T cell clones
such as BDC-2.5 recognize the 2.5HIP at low nano-
molar concentrations, whereas unmodified WE14
is poorly antigenic for these clones (2), which
mandates high peptide concentrations (>10 mM)
for T cell activation (Fig. 1B); hence, the HIP was
>10,000 times as potent as a stimulator for BDC-
2.5 than WE14. The T cell clones BDC-6.9 and
BDC-9.3 recognize the 6.9HIP, also at low na-
nomolar concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D). BDC-
6.9 and BDC-9.3 do not react to the unmodified
IAPP2 peptide, and none of the clones respond to
the full-length Ins2 C-peptide or the C-peptide
fragment ending with the amino acid sequence
LQTLAL. T cell reactivity with WE14 or IAPP2
was not altered if these peptides were coincubated
(without cross-linking) with the C-peptide frag-
ment ending in LQTLAL, which indicated that
the covalent attachment of the peptides is required
to obtain full T cell activation.
To validate the in vivo presence of HIPs in b
cells, we fractionated murine b cell extracts by
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chro-
matography (RP-HPLC) and performed mass spec-
trometric (MS) analyses on antigenic fractions.

 two distinct ligands (left and right peak) exist
for this T cell clone (Fig. 2A). After proteolytic
digestion and tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis of
the left antigen peak (Fig. 2A), we identified the
peptide DLQTLAL-WSRM (Fig. 2B and fig. S3).
This spectrum provides physical evidence verify-
ing the presence of the 2.5HIP in murine b cells.
We have not identified a HIP in the antigen peak
on the right, possibly because of limited instru-
mental sensitivity, poor peptide ionization, or the
presence of yet another unknown HIP sequence.
Purification of the endogenous ligand recognized
by BDC-6.9 and BDC-9.3 (fig. S4A), followed by
MS analysis, led to the identification of the cor-
responding 6.9HIP sequence DLQTLAL-NAAR
(fig. S4, B and C). Both the 2.5HIP and the 6.9HIP
contain the C-peptide fragment ending with the
amino acid sequence DLQTLAL, a naturally oc-
curring cleavage product of insulin C-peptide
formed within the secretory granules of b cells
(11). This fragment may thus provide a preferred
ligation site for the formation of HIPs, but ad-
ditional insulin ligation sites may also exist.
Identifying the autoreactive T cells involved in
the pathogenic process is a major objective for
T1D research, and achieving this goal may enable
us to monitor the disease process and devise
antigen-specific methods to prevent and/or re-
verse disease. MHC class II tetramer reagents
can be used to specifically identify pathogenic T
cells (12). To determine whether HIP-reactive T
cells could be identified in diabetic NOD mice,
we designed a peptide:MHC class II (I-Ag7) tet-
ramer containing the HIP sequence antigenic
for BDC-2.5; specificity of the 2.5HIP tetramer
was demonstrated through staining of the three
2.5HIP-reactive CD4 T cell clones (fig. S5A). To
examine the presence of HIP-reactive T cells in
NOD mice, cell suspensions from spleens, pan-
creatic lymph nodes (pLNs), and pancreata of
diabetic NOD mice were stained with the 2.5HIP
tetramer (Fig. 3 and fig. S5B). Two additional tet-
ramers, pS3 and 2.5mi, containing peptide mimo-
tope sequences recognized by BDC-2.5 (2, 13),
were used as positive controls. We found that
2.5HIP tetramer–positive cells were present in

Downloaded from 
 both the spleen and pancreas of NOD mice. In
both tissues, the 2.5HIP tetramer stained a higher
percentage of CD4 T cells compared with the
2.5mi and the pS3 tetramers, a difference that
was statistically significant in the pancreas and
that indicated that the 2.5HIP tetramer is more
efficient in the detection of 2.5HIP-reactive CD4
T cells. Our data show that most of the 2.5HIP
tetramer–positive cells in the spleen were CD44
high, which indicated that a significant propor-
tion of these cells were antigen-experienced and
further substantiated their involvement in the
pathogenic process.
To determine whether human CD4 T cells of
individuals with T1D recognize HIPs, we screened
a selection of HIPs (Fig. 4A) using CD4 T cells
isolated from the residual islets of two patients.
Corresponding human sequences of naturally
occurring peptides found in mouse b cell extracts
formed the right portion of the HIPs. The central
C-peptide amino acid sequences ELGG or ELGGG,
which form the left half of HIPs 1 to 8, satisfy
parameters for binding to DQ8 positions 1 and 4
(14). Risk of developing T1D is strongly associated
with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, and
HLA-DQ8 confers the highest risk of developing
T1D of any single HLA allele (15). For the left
sides of HIPs 9 to 16, we used the human version
(SLQPLAL) of the murine peptide sequence pres-
ent in the 2.5 and 6.9HIPs. From one organ
donor, 17 CD4 T cell lines were isolated from re-
sidual islets, expanded, and tested for reactivity
against eight of the HIPs (Fig. 4A, peptides 1 to 8)
with Priess B cells (DR4+/+,DQ8+/+) as presenters.
The CD4 line MG1 responded to the HIP formed
by fusion of proinsulin C-peptide to the pancreatic
peptide, neuropeptide Y (GQVELGGG-SSPETLI)
(Fig. 4B). Using CD4 T cell clones isolated from a
second organ donor (16), we screened all 16 HIPs
(Fig. 4A). Two clones responded to the same HIP
that was formed by the fusion of proinsulin C-
peptide to IAPP2 (GQVELGGG-NAVEVLK) (Fig. 4,
C and D). Both clones responded weakly to pro-
insulin C-peptide (proinsulin 37–54), but the HIP
was 1000 to 10,000 times as potent. Both clones
recognized HIP peptides presented by HLA-DQ8
(DQA1*03:01; DQB1*03:02) (fig. S6). Although
pathogenicity of human T cells cannot be directly
demonstrated, the presence of HIP-specific CD4
T cells within the pancreatic islets of individuals
with T1D supports the contention that these cells
play a pathogenic role in human T1D.
HIPs represent not only a novel posttranslational
modification in autoimmune disease, but they also
constitute a new family of autoantigens in T1D.
Hybridpeptidesthatformthroughproteinsplicing
have been previously noted in tumorantigen forma-
tion, a process thatoccursthroughtheproteosomal
class I pathway and yields antigens for CD8 T cells
(17–19). The formation of HIPs in the secretory
granules of b cells could be a side reaction of the
proteolytic hydrolysis of peptide bonds in the
presence of naturally occurring cleavage products
(e.g., WE14), and molecular crowding of peptides
in secretory granules may favor this reversed
proteolytic transpeptidation (20). The identifica-
tion of HIP-reactive CD4 T cells from the islets
of individuals with T1D, together with the dem-
onstration that several distinct pathogenic CD4
T cells from NOD mice target different HIPs in
b cells, strongly suggests that HIPs play a central
role in the pathogenesis of T1D. We hypothesize
that HIPs are key antigens for autoreactive T cells
and are responsible for the loss of self-tolerance in
human T1D. We would also speculate that hybrid
peptides may form in the secretory granules of
other endocrine tissues and could be a source of
self-antigens in other autoimmune disorders.

Major histocompatibility complex E (MHC-E) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed,
nonclassical MHC class Ib molecule with limited polymorphism that is primarily involved in
the regulation of natural killer (NK) cells. We found that vaccinating rhesus macaques with
rhesus cytomegalovirus vectors in which genes Rh157.5 and Rh157.4 are deleted results in
MHC-E–restricted presentation of highly varied peptide epitopes to CD8ab+ Tcells, at ~4
distinct epitopes per 100 amino acids in all tested antigens. Computational structural analysis
revealed that MHC-E provides heterogeneous chemical environments for diverse side-chain
interactions within a stable, open binding groove. Because MHC-E is up-regulated to evade NK
cell activity in cells infected with HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, and other persistent
viruses, MHC-E–restricted CD8+ Tcell responses have the potential to exploit pathogen
immune-evasion adaptations, a capability that might endow these unconventional responses
with superior efficacy.
A
daptive cellular immunity against intra-
cellular pathogens is the primary respon-
sibility of CD8+ T cells that recognize short
pathogen-derived peptide epitopes presented
by highly polymorphic major histocom-
patibility complex class Ia (MHC-Ia) molecules

allomorphs vary considerably in their peptide-
binding properties, and therefore the particular
