Chronic nicotine exposure (CNE) alters synaptic transmission in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) in a manner that enhances dopami-
nergic signaling and promotes nicotine use. The present experi-
ments identify a correlation between enhanced production of the
endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and di-
minished release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the
VTA following CNE. To study the functional role of on-demand
2-AG signaling in GABAergic synapses, we used 1,2,3-triazole urea
compounds to selectively inhibit 2-AG biosynthesis by diacylgly-
cerol lipase (DAGL). The potency and selectivity of these inhibitors
were established in rats in vitro (rat brain proteome), ex vivo
(brain slices), and in vivo (intracerebroventricular administration)
using activity-based protein profiling and targeted metabolomics
analyses. Inhibition of DAGL (2-AG biosynthesis) rescues nicotine-
induced VTA GABA signaling following CNE. Conversely, enhance-
ment of 2-AG signaling in naïve rats by inhibiting 2-AG degradation
recapitulates the loss of nicotine-induced GABA signaling evident
following CNE. DAGL inhibition reduces nicotine self-administration
without disrupting operant responding for a nondrug reinforcer or
motor activity. Collectively, these findings provide a detailed char-
acterization of selective inhibitors of rat brain DAGL and demon-
strate that excessive 2-AG signaling contributes to a loss of inhibi-
tory GABAergic constraint of VTA excitability following CNE.

ventral tegmental area
T
he mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system provides a
critical link between the brain regions that process cognitive
information and those controlling motor behavior. Precise control
of these ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections facilitates
seeking rewarding stimuli, retreating from aversive stimuli, con-
straint of motivational state, and behavioral flexibility necessary for
survival. GABAergic signaling provides robust inhibition that gates
VTA DA cell excitability (1, 2), and loss of this inhibition leads to
pathological dysregulation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry (3, 4).
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) regulate DAergic activity through
retrograde signaling from DA cell bodies onto presynaptic can-
nabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors expressed on both inhibitory and
excitatory inputs. Although both 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)
and anandamide (AEA) function as endogenous CB1 agonists in
the brain (5–7), these lipids exhibit distinct pharmacological
profiles in vivo (8, 9) and mediate differential behavioral effects
(10, 11). Endocannabinoids are produced and degraded on-
demand, and the primary enzymes responsible for eCB degra-
dation have been well-characterized using selective pharmacological
tools that inactivate monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) or fatty
acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (11–13). However, a complete
evaluation of the influence of eCB signaling in the brain has been
hampered by the lack of appropriate corresponding tools for
selectively inactivating on-demand eCB biosynthesis.
Substantial evidence implicates eCB signaling in the etiology
of nicotine addiction, and recent work demonstrates that
chronic nicotine exposure (CNE) selectively enhances nicotine-
induced increases in VTA 2-AG formation (14). The present
study investigated the possible contribution of this effect to ab-
errant VTA DA cell excitation present following CNE (15). We
find that sensitized nicotine-induced 2-AG release (14) strongly
correlates with a loss of nicotine-induced GABA release, which
may contribute to impaired inhibitory constraint of VTA DA cell
excitation following CNE. To test this hypothesis, we charac-
terized a series of selective inhibitors of 2-AG biosynthesis by
diacylglycerol lipase α and β (DAGLα and DAGLβ; hereafter
referred to as DAGL) (16–18) and 2-AG degradation by
α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) and MAGL (11, 12, 19), and
used these compounds to investigate the functional impact of
enhanced 2-AG recruitment on GABAergic signaling at VTA
synapses and nicotine self-administration.
Results
Chronic Nicotine Exposure Impairs Nicotine-Induced GABA Release in
the Rat VTA. We previously demonstrated that nicotine-induced
VTA 2-AG formation is sensitized following CNE in a manner
independent of the volitional nature of drug exposure [e.g., similar
sensitization induced by either nicotine self-administration (SA)
or response-independent administration] (Fig. 1A) (14). To de-
termine the signaling mechanisms influenced by this aberrant 2-AG
response, we screened the remaining microdialysate aliquots from
these same subjects for temporal changes in neurotransmitter
content. Of the 11 neurotransmitters quantified, only GABA
Significance
Many CNS disorders result from dysregulation of the meso-
corticolimbic dopamine projections arising from the ventral teg-
mental area. A mechanistic understanding of these dysregulations
is critical for developing treatments for these diseases. Nicotine
addiction is a global health concern, and results in part from
dysregulated mesocorticolimbic dopamine function. Here we
present evidence that nicotine-induced 2-arachidonoylglycerol
formation in the ventral tegmental area is sensitized following
chronic nicotine exposure, and that this results in the loss of
GABA-mediated constraint of mesocorticolimbic dopamine activ-
ity. Potent and selective diacylglycerol lipase inhibitors are char-
acterized and used in ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo
behavioral analyses to demonstrate that this mechanism plays a
prominent role in the dysregulation of ventral tegmental dopa-
mine neurons following nicotine exposure.

 exhibited a pattern that correlated with changes in 2-AG (Fig. 1B
and Fig. S1). Specifically, dialysate 2-AG and GABA levels (Fig.
1C) were inversely correlated and exhibited distinct nicotine-
induced responses following chronic vs. acute nicotine exposure
regardless of response contingency (14).
To determine the impact of nicotine exposure on GABA
transmission, whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings
of pharmacologically isolated GABAA receptor-mediated spon-
taneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were per-
formed in VTA DA neurons (Fig. S2 A–C). In VTA slices from
drug-naïve rats, bath application of nicotine produced a transient
increase in sIPSC frequency with no effect on sIPSC amplitude
(Fig. 1 D and E and Fig. S3A). However, in VTA slices from
CNE rats, nicotine did not alter sIPSC frequency or amplitude
(Fig. 1 D and E). There was no significant effect of prior CNE on
either baseline (Fig. S2D) or muscimol-induced (Fig. S2E)
sIPSCs, indicating no CNE-induced disruption in postsynaptic
GABAA receptor influence. Nicotine-induced increases in sIPSC
frequency were absent in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX),
confirming a reliance on action potential firing (Fig. 1F and Fig.
S3 B and C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CNE
impairs nicotine-induced increases in GABA signaling but not
baseline GABA transmission in VTA DA neurons.
CB1 Influence on VTA GABA Signaling Is Not Altered Following Chronic
Nicotine Exposure. Tests with the synthetic CB1 agonist WIN
55,212-2 (WIN) and the CB1 antagonist rimonabant (RIM) were
performed to probe for possible alterations in CB1 function
following CNE. In nicotine-naïve slices, WIN reduced sIPSC
frequency and prevented subsequent nicotine-induced increases
in sIPSC frequency (Fig. 2 A, C, and D). The WIN-induced oc-
clusion of nicotine-induced sIPSC increases likely reflects CB1-
mediated suppression of presynaptic GABA release, as sup-
ported by in vivo microdialysis data demonstrating WIN-induced
reductions in VTA GABA levels and prevention of subsequent
nicotine-induced increases in VTA GABA release (Fig. 2E).
RIM increased sIPSC frequency and also prevented subsequent
nicotine-induced increases in sIPSC frequency (Fig. 2 B–D). This
suggests a tonic CB1 influence on VTA GABA release, as sup-
ported by a robust increase in in vivo VTA microdialysate
GABA levels following RIM administration (Fig. 2F). The ro-
bust per se effects of RIM on GABAA signaling may preclude
detection of additional nicotine-induced effects. WIN and RIM
induced similar effects in VTA neurons from CNE rats (Fig. 2 C
and D) and, importantly, the effects of these CB1 receptor li-
gands on sIPSCs did not differ between nicotine-naïve and CNE
VTA neurons.
Selective Inhibitors of Rat 2-AG Metabolic Enzymes. Determination
of the 2-AG influence on nicotine-induced alterations in VTA
GABA signaling requires manipulation of 2-AG biosynthesis. To
enable this, we used an activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)
assay using the broad-spectrum and DAGL-directed probes FP-Rh
and HT-01 to evaluate the potency and selectivity of a series of
1,2,3-triazole ureas (1,2,3-TUs) for inhibiting the 2-AG bio-
synthetic enzymes DAGLα and DAGLβ (20). In the rat proteome,
the 1,2,3-TU KT172 (Fig. 3 B and F) and the structurally related
analog KT128 (Fig. 3 C and G) displayed greater inhibitory po-
tency at DAGLα than DAGLβ. Both compounds exhibited good
selectivity against other serine hydrolases including MAGL and
FAAH but showed cross-reactivity with ABHD6, as expected (20–
22). To identify appropriate negative control probes, we confirmed
that the ABHD6-selective inhibitors KT185 (Fig. 3 D and H) and
KT195 (Fig. 3 E and I) potently inactivated rat ABHD6 (20, 21)
with minimal off-target activity against other serine hydrolases in-
cluding DAGLs, with the exception of FAAH cross-reactivity by
KT195 (Fig. 3, Figs. S4 and S5, and Table S1).
In the ex vivo brain slice conditions used for electrophysio-
logical studies, KT172 inactivated DAGLα and ABHD6 with no
significant effect on other serine hydrolases, and the negative
control probe KT185 inhibited ABHD6 without disrupting
DAGL activity (Fig. 3J and Fig. S6). In this same preparation,
KT172 significantly and selectively reduced striatal slice 2-AG
content (Fig. 3K), similar to the reduction in striatal 2-AG
content evident in DAGLα-KO mice (Fig. S7A). Conversely,
KT185 significantly increased striatal slice 2-AG content (Fig.
3K), consistent with a role for ABHD6 as an alternative eCB
hydrolase in the rat brain (11). Although KT172 also inhibits
ABHD6 activity, the upstream loss of 2-AG biosynthesis by
DAGLα inhibition likely precludes 2-AG accumulation that
could result from this decrement in 2-AG hydrolysis. Indeed,
DAGLα inhibition by KT172 prevents the accumulation of tissue
2-AG content normally induced by the MAGL inhibitor KML29
(Fig. S7B), even though coincubation with these compounds

 results in the combined inhibition of ABHD6 and MAGL.
Overall, KT172-induced reductions in tissue 2-AG content likely
result from the combined reduction in 2-AG biosynthesis and
unperturbed 2-AG hydrolysis by MAGL. No treatment altered
basal AEA levels (Fig. 3K and Fig. S7C). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that KT172 and KT185 serve as paired chemical
probes for selectively modulating 2-AG metabolism in the rat brain.
DAGL Inactivation Restores Nicotine-Induced GABA Release in Rats
with a History of Nicotine Exposure. We tested whether inactiva-
tion of DAGLs could restore nicotine-elicited GABA signaling
at VTA DA synapses in slices from CNE rats. Slices were
superfused with KT172 or KT128, which had no per se effect on
baseline sIPSC characteristics (Fig. 4 A and D). However, sub-
sequent application of nicotine to drug-treated VTA slices sig-
nificantly increased sIPSC frequency in DA neurons to levels
similar to those observed in drug-naïve rats. To confirm the
DAGL specificity of this effect, we treated VTA slices from CNE
rats with the ABHD6-selective inhibitor KT185. KT185 had no
per se effect on baseline sIPSCs (Fig. 4 B and D), and did not
restore the nicotine-induced increase in GABA release. We
replicated these experiments with the DAGL inhibitors included
in the pipette internal solution to restrict delivery to the post-
synaptic cell, and showed that either KT172 or KT128 restored
nicotine-induced increases in sIPSC frequency in CNE slices to
levels similar to that observed in drug-naïve slices (Fig. 4 C and
D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that inhibiting
postsynaptic DAGL restores nicotine-induced GABA signaling
in rats with a history of nicotine exposure.
Attenuation of 2-AG Clearance Blocks Nicotine-Induced GABA Release
in Drug-Naïve Rats. We hypothesized that enhancing 2-AG sig-
naling in naïve rats would recapitulate the loss of nicotine-
induced GABA release evident following CNE. Superfusion of
naïve VTA slices with the ABHD6-selective inhibitor KT185 did
not alter baseline sIPSC frequency but blocked nicotine-induced
increases in sIPSC frequency (Fig. 4 E and G). Similarly, super-
fusion of the MAGL-selective inhibitor KML29 blocked nicotine-
induced sIPSCs without significantly modifying baseline sIPSC

 frequency (Fig. 4G). In contrast, superfusion with the DAGL in-
hibitors KT172 or KT128 did not alter GABA signaling (Fig. 4 F
and G). Together, these data demonstrate that the loss of nico-
tine-induced GABA signaling observed in the VTA of CNE rats
can be reproduced in naïve rats by inhibiting 2-AG clearance with
inhibitors of ABHD6 or MAGL.
Nicotine Self-Administration Is Reduced by DAGL Inhibition. To eval-
uate the influence of DAGL activity on nicotine SA behavior, we
established that KT172 and KT185 effectively inhibit DAGL and
ABHD6 in the rat brain following intracerebroventricular (ICV)
administration. Both DAGLα and ABHD6 activity were inhibited
following ICV administration of KT172; DAGLβ activity was also
partially inhibited in these animals (Fig. 5 A and C and Fig. S8).
Treatment with KT185 resulted in comparable ABHD6 inhibition in
the absence of reduced DAGL activity (Fig. 5 B and C). Neither drug
exhibited significant cross-reactivity against other serine hydrolases
(including MAGL and FAAH) under these conditions. Subsequent
behavioral tests revealed that nicotine self-administration was signif-
icantly reduced by KT172 but not KT185 (Fig. 5D). Neither com-
pound significantly altered operant responding for water (Fig. 5E) or
spontaneous locomotor activity (Fig. 5F), thereby discounting an in-
fluence of nonspecific behavioral disruptions and highlighting a
meaningful influence of DAGL activity on the motivation for nicotine
vs. a nondrug reinforcer.
Discussion
Through the use of selective inhibitors of DAGL, ABHD6, and
MAGL, the present findings reveal that enhanced on-demand
2-AG formation blunts the inhibitory control of nicotine-induced
VTA cell excitation following CNE (Fig. S9). Loss of this in-
hibitory feedback mechanism likely contributes to increased
VTA sensitivity to nicotine and other stimuli (23, 24), resulting in
sensitized DA release in the nucleus accumbens (15) and in-
creased motivation for nicotine intake.
Nicotine-induced increases in VTA 2-AG formation (14)
likely contribute to the well-documented CB1 receptor influence
on behavioral and physiological response to nicotine (25). In the
VTA, CB1 receptors are thought to dynamically regulate GABA
release at DAergic synapses (4), allowing the possibility that
2-AG formation dampens GABAergic constraint of DA cell
excitation. A direct test of this hypothesis requires the suppression
of 2-AG formation, although studies of this type have been limited
by a lack of selective inhibitors of 2-AG biosynthesis (26) and
suitable biochemical assays to validate inhibition of endogenous
DAGL activity. To address this, we evaluated the efficacy of
DAGL-selective 1,2,3-TU inhibitors for use in the rat brain using
a tailored ABPP assay (20, 22). We find that KT172 selectively
inhibits DAGL enzymes in the exogenous brain proteome as well
as in awake animals, and that the primary off-target of this inhibitor
(ABHD6) can be accounted for using the negative control probe
KT185. Using targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) metabolomics, we show that KT172 but not KT185 sig-
nificantly reduces brain 2-AG levels, supporting DAGLs as the
principal 2-AG biosynthetic enzymes in the rat brain. Using this
suite of chemical probes, we demonstrate that DAGL inhibition
restores nicotine-induced increases in GABA signaling in the VTA

 of CNE rats. Conversely, attenuation of 2-AG hydrolysis by either
ABHD6 or MAGL in nicotine-naïve rats recapitulates the loss of
nicotine-induced GABA signaling observed following CNE. These
latter effects are consistent with previous studies on hippocampal
GABAergic signaling using MAGL inhibitors (27) or MAGL-
knockout mice (28). Collectively, these findings support the hy-
pothesis that nicotine-induced increases in 2-AG dampen the
GABAergic constraint of DA cell excitation following CNE.
We find that the functional influence of CB1 receptors on
VTA GABA release is unaltered by CNE, and demonstrate that
CB1 receptor antagonism robustly increases VTA GABA levels
and GABAA receptor signaling. The resultant decrease in DA
cell excitability likely underlies the ability of CB1 antagonists to
block nicotine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens DA re-
lease and to suppress nicotine self-administration (25, 29–34).
Nicotine and other drugs of abuse alter synaptic transmission
in the VTA through additional mechanisms that may be facili-
tated by the loss of local inhibitory signaling. For example, nic-
otine enhances glutamatergic transmission in the VTA and
strengthens excitatory synapses onto VTA DA neurons via the
induction of long-term potentiation (35–37). A significant body of
work highlights the importance of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity
in long-term changes that result from a history of drug exposure
(37, 38), although in the context of the present studies it is notable
that the functional influence of these excitatory adaptations re-
quires a concomitant loss of inhibitory signaling (39).
In summary, on-demand 2-AG biosynthesis represents a mo-
lecular switch that regulates inhibitory signaling in the VTA.
Following CNE, enhanced 2-AG production following cholin-
ergic receptor activation imbalances this system in a manner that
facilitates DAergic cell excitability. The present results provide
novel, direct evidence that pharmacological modulation of 2-AG
biosynthesis is a viable approach for evaluating the influence of
the eCB system on substance abuse disorders.
Experimental Procedures
Animals. Studies involving male Wistar rats (300–450 g; Charles River
Laboratories) were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines and as
approved by the Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Intravenous catheterization (14), microdialysis probe
implantation (14), and intracerebroventricular administration of drugs
using homemade cannulae and infusers (40) were performed using
published methodology.
Nicotine Administration Procedures. For volitional nicotine exposure, SA rats
were trained to operantly respond for IV nicotine (75 μg/kg per infusion;
0.1 mL per infusion over 4 s) under a continuous (fixed ratio 1; FR-1)
schedule of reinforcement in daily 2-h sessions using previously published
procedures (14). Rats from the SA group were individually paired with
animals receiving noncontingent forced nicotine exposure (CNE) that
received nicotine infusions based on the partner SA rats’ patterns of in-
take during the training and collection sessions. Rats receiving acute
noncontingent forced nicotine exposure (acute) were also individually
paired with SA rats, but received saline infusions in all training sessions,
and nicotine infusions during the collection session (infusion patterns
based on partner SA rats’ volitional intake).
Neurotransmitter Measurements. Quantification of neurotransmitters in di-
alysate samples was performed by LC-MS/MS using established methodology
(41, 42). Briefly, 1 μL dialysate was added to 6.5 μL borate (100 mM),
derivatized with benzoyl chloride [2% (vol/vol), acetonitrile (ACN)], and
supplemented with an internal standard.
Gel-Based Competitive ABPP. Gel-based competitive ABPP experiments were
performed as previously described (20, 43). For experiments using the FP-
rhodamine probe, proteomes (1 mg/mL) were treated with FP-rhodamine
(1 μM) in a 50-μL total reaction volume for 30 min at 37 °C. For experi-
ments using the HT-01 probe, proteomes (2 mg/mL) were treated with HT-
01 (1 μM) in a 50-μL total reaction volume for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions
were quenched with SDS/PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated
by SDS/PAGE (10% acrylamide) and visualized using a fluorescence scan-
ner (Hitachi; FMBIO IIe).
Electrophysiological Recording. Electrophysiology procedures were as re-
cently reported (44, 45) and are described briefly. Coronal sections
(300 μm) through the midbrain were cut on a Leica VT1000S (Leica Micro-
systems) and placed in oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) artificial cerebro-
spinal fluid (aCSF) solution composed of 130 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 2 mM
CaCl2, 1.5 mM MgClSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 24 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM
glucose. Whole-cell recordings were made using glass pipettes (3–5 MΩ)
filled with an intracellular solution containing 145 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA,
5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM Na-ATP, 0.2 mM Na-GTP coupled to a
MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low-pass-filtered at 2–5
kHz, digitized (Digidata 1440A; Axon Instruments), and stored on a
computer using pCLAMP 10 software (Axon Instruments). To isolate
inhibitory currents mediated by GABAA receptors, recordings (Vhold −60
mV) were performed in the presence of dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(DNQX) (20 μM), DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP-5) (50 μM), and
CGP55845A (1 μM). Miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded in the addi-
tional presence of TTX (0.5 μM).
Statistics. For microdialysis analyses, significance was determined by
repeated measures ANOVA for effects of group, nicotine, and group x
nicotine interaction. Significance for microdialysis baseline levels and

Nicotine self-administration is reduced by DAGL inhibition. (A and
B) Gel-based ABPP using HT-01 and FP-Rh assessed the efficacy and selec-
tivity of KT172 and KT185 in vivo by ICV injection. KT172 (A) (100 μg, 4 h, n
= 4) reduces DAGLα, DAGLβ, and ABHD6 activity, whereas treatment with
KT185 (B) (100 μg, 4 h, n = 4) reduces ABHD6 activity with negligible ac-
tivity against DAGLs. (C) Representative HT-01 (Left) and FP-Rh (Right) gels
for each inhibitor. (D) Pretreatment with KT172 (100 μg, 4 h, n = 16), but
not KT185 (100 μg, 4 h, n = 10), significantly reduced nicotine self-ad-
ministration (75 μg/kg per infusion; FR-1 reinforcement schedule). (E) Pre-
treatment with either KT172 (n = 9) or KT185 (n = 9) has no effect on oral
water self-administration. (F) Pretreatment with either KT172 (n = 9) or
KT185 (n = 9) has no effect on motor activity. Data are presented as mean ±
SE. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

 area-under-the-curve (AUC) values was determined by ANOVA followed by
Dunnett’s post hoc. For the ABPP studies, a Student’s t test (unpaired, two-
tailed) was used to determine the effect of each drug. For electrophysiology
experiments, sIPSC frequency was examined for a 2-min period following
drug or nicotine application (36), and events were analyzed for independent
significance using a one-sample t test and compared using a two-tailed t test
for independent samples, a paired two-tailed t test for comparisons made
within the same recording, and a one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post
hoc analysis for comparisons made between three or more groups. All sta-
tistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18 (IBM) or Prism 5.02 (GraphPad).
Data are presented as mean ± SE. In all cases, the criterion for significance
was as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
