Intelligence and conscientiousness are key predictors of all important life outcomes, such as socioeconomic suc-
cess, marital status, health and longevity. It is unclear, however, if and to what extent lay people appreciate these
dimensions of individual differences. Here, 142 mothers of 0–12 month old infants were asked to select from each
of the Big Five personality traits the facets that they most liked their child to have. Afterwards, mothers rank-or-
dered the facets they had selected and ‘intelligence’ from most to least important for their child to have. Less than
10% of mothers rated intelligence and the conscientiousness facet as most important. By contrast, 51% rated the
extraversion facet as most important, followed by 20% of mothers who favoured the agreeableness facet. Our re-
sults suggest that mothers preferred extraversion over intelligence and conscientiousness, despite their strong,
empirically demonstrated predictive validity for important life outcomes.

1. Introduction
A wealth of research over the past century has substantiated that in-
telligence (IQ) and conscientiousness are the most important predictors
of positive life outcomes. Individuals high on these traits achieve aca-
demically (Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Laidra, Pullmann,
& Allik, 2007; Poropat, 2009; Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012;
Trapmann, Hell, Hirn, & Schuler, 2007); succeed in the work place
(Barrick & Mount, 1991; Schmidt & Hunter, 2004); are healthier (Bogg
& Roberts, 2004; Gottfredson, 2004); and live longer (Batty, Deary, &
Gottfredson, 2007; Friedman et al., 1993; Kern & Friedman, 2008;
Whalley & Deary, 2001). In addition, IQ and conscientiousness have
been associated with the duration, stability and pattern of marital
relations (Roberts & Bogg, 2004; Taylor et al., 2005; von Stumm, Batty,
& Deary, 2011).
Despite the empirically demonstrated significance of IQ and consci-
entiousness, it remains relatively unknown if – and to what extent – lay
people appreciate these dimensions of individual difference. Under-
standing the views of mothers is especially critical in this regard because
parenting informs the context in which children develop their personal-
ity (Shiner & Caspi, 2003). For example, maternal harsh and warm par-
enting
have
been
shown
to
predict
changes
in
children's
conscientiousness and emotional stability across childhood and adoles-
cence (Van den Akker, Deković, Asscher, & Prinzie, 2014). The influence
of parenting on children's personality occurs in concert with child ef-
fects on parenting, whereby parents typically model behaviours that
their children then internalise and apply to different situations. More
importantly, mothers' own values inform the goals they have in parent-
ing and socialising their child (Darling & Steinberg, 1993; Gonida &
Cortina, 2014; Luster, Rhoades, & Haas, 1989). For example, the extent
to which parents value mastery motivation – the desire to learn and
to value effort, perseverance and improvement – predicts the practices
that parents use when assisting children with their homework (Gonida
& Cortina, 2014), as well as the children's own subsequent mastery mo-
tivation (Duchesne & Ratelle, 2010; Gonida & Cortina, 2014). This find-
ing suggests that parents' values will be reflected in children's
personality trait development.
The aims of the current study were to explore (a) what traits
mothers value as being most important for their child to have; and (b)
mothers' beliefs regarding the degree of influence that they, as parents,
have on their child's character development. We focus here on mothers
as – although the role of fathers' is changing (Cabrera, Tamis-LeMonda,
Bradley, Hofferth, & Lamb, 2000) – even in two-parent families mothers
typically spend more time with their children compared to fathers
(Craig & Powell, 2012).

 that children were too young to have developed the traits of interest in
order to capture mothers' desires for their children rather than reports
of what their child is actually like. Mothers' ages ranged from 22 to
46 years (mean = 33.92; SD = 4.52), the majority lived with a partner
(N = 137) and typically had one (N = 71) or two (N = 55) children liv-
ing in the home – few mothers (N = 15) had three or more children.
The majority were full- or part-time employed (N = 89), and had
achieved an undergraduate degree or higher qualification (N = 122).
For household net income, mothers endorsed on average the category
of £30,000-£50,000 (range b£30,000 to N£70,000). Mothers were
typically born in the UK or had a UK passport (N = 125) and on
average were resident in the UK for 30.12 years (SD = 8.59 years;
range = 1–44 years).
2.2. Procedure
Mothers were recruited via web, social media and flier advertise-
ments to report their views about their child's personality as part of a
larger online survey conducted in the UK. In return for their participa-
tion, mothers were entered into a prize draw to win one of five £50
shopping vouchers.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Demographic measures
Participants indicated their age, employment status, highest educa-
tion qualification, household income, relationship status, UK residency
and the number of children that lived in the home with them.
2.3.2. International personality item pool version of NEO-PI-R facets
(Goldberg et al., 2006)
Mothers were presented with the six facets of each of the Big Five
personality traits: (1) extraversion: friendliness, gregariousness, asser-
tiveness, activity, excitement-seeking, cheerfulness; (2) conscientious-
ness: self-efficacy, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement-striving, self-
discipline, cautiousness; (3) neuroticism: anxiety, anger, depression,
self-consciousness, immoderation, vulnerability; (4) agreeableness:
trust, morality, altruism, cooperation, modesty, sympathy; (5) openness
to experience: imagination, artistic interests, emotionality, adventur-
ousness, intellect, liberalism. For each Big Five trait, mothers selected
the facet that they most liked their child to have. Following this,
mothers rank-ordered the facets they had selected – together with ‘in-
telligence’ – from ‘most’ to ‘least’ important for their child to have.
2.3.3. Beliefs about influence
Four items were adapted from DeBaryshe and Binder (1994)for the
present study to measure mothers' beliefs regarding their degree of in-
fluence on the development of their child's character. Mothers were
asked how much they agreed or disagreed with the following state-
ments: (a) ‘As a parent I play an important role in the development of
my child's character’; (b) ‘As a parent I cannot influence the kind of per-
son that my child will become’; (c) ‘My child's character and aptitude
are more defined by genes than by parents' influence or teaching’; and
(d) ‘As a parent, I have the power to encourage certain traits in my
child, as well as the power to discourage others’. Responses were
given on a 5-point scale (‘strongly disagree’ (0), ‘disagree’ (1),
‘somewhat agree’ (2), ‘agree’ (3), ‘strongly agree’ (4)). Negative items
were reversed, and responses averaged such that a higher score
reflected a mother's stronger belief in her influence on her child's
character development. One item (My child's character and aptitude
are more defined by genes than by parents' influence or teaching) was
excluded to improve internal reliability (α = 0.51; mean inter-item
correlation = 0.27).
3. Results
Fig. 1 (Panels A–E) displays the facets of the Big Five personality
traits that mothers identified as being the one they would most like
their baby to have. Mothers most commonly identified ‘cheerfulness’
and ‘friendliness’ from the extraversion facet (both identified by
37.32% of mothers); ‘achievement-striving’ (52.25%) from the conscien-
tiousness facet; ‘self-consciousness’ (42.96%) from the neuroticism
facet; ‘morality’ (40.14%) from the agreeableness facet; and ‘imagina-
tion’ (33.80%) and ‘intellect’ (33.10%) from the openness to experience
facet. A series of ANOVAs revealed no main effect of child gender on
mothers' Big Five facet selections (significance value set at 0.002 based
on the Bonferroni correction for n = 30 tests; F(1,141) N 0.02, p N
0.016 in all cases; Cohen's d = 0.02–0.40).
Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics for mothers' ratings of the
importance of the five personality facets they selected together with in-
telligence. In this sample, b10% of mothers rated intelligence and the
conscientiousness facet as most important. By contrast, 51% rated the
extraversion facet as most important, followed by 20% of mothers
who favoured the agreeableness facet (see Fig. 1; Panel F also). Paired
t-tests revealed that extraversion was rated as significantly more
important than all other traits (t(144) N −28.30, p b 0.001 in all cases).
One-way ANOVAs were conducted to test whether mothers' mean
importance ratings differed as a function of demographic characteris-
tics. Adjusting for multiple comparisons (significance value set at
0.002 based on the Bonferroni correction), there was no significant
effect of child gender, (F(1,141) N 0.53, p N 0.027 in all cases; Cohen's
d = 0.09–0.36. See also Supplementary material), household income
(F(3,138) N 0.71, p N 0.116 in all cases; η2 = 0.01–0.03), mothers' edu-
cation (F(3,138) N 0.07, p N 0.012 in all cases; η2 = 0.01–0.08) or the
number of children in the home (F(2,138) N 0.10, p N 0.072 in all
cases; η2 = 0.02–0.05). Correlation analyses were used to examine as-
sociations between mothers' ratings and their age and length of UK res-
idency. These revealed no significant correlation between mothers' age
or their residency and their mean ratings of personality characteristics
(r = −0.09–0.11 and −0.17–0.20 respectively).
Overall, mothers in this sample agreed that they have influence on
the development of their child's character (mean = 3.15, SD = 0.65,
range 1.67 to 4). Correlations between mothers' belief of their influence
and their importance ratings were, however, small and inconsistent
across traits (r = 0.02–0.18) and did not reach significance.
4. Discussion
Despite the predictive validity of IQ and conscientiousness for many
important real life outcomes, our results suggest that these were not
what mothers valued as the most important characteristics for their
children to develop. Rather, the trait that mothers in our sample most
wanted for their children was extraversion – the tendency to be social,
assertive, gregarious, active, and cheerful. The predictive validity of ex-
traversion for life outcomes, however, is much weaker than that of IQ
or conscientiousness. For example, meta-analytic correlations of aca-
demic performance with intelligence (d = 0.52) and conscientiousness
(d = 0.46) are far greater than that with extraversion (d = −0.02;
Poropat, 2009). Similarly, conscientiousness is a robust predictor of
work performance across criteria (e.g. overall work performance, super-
visory ratings of job performance, productivity, and promotions) and
work types (e.g. sales, manager, skilled and semiskilled labour), while
extraversion is inconsistently associated and only predicts some aspects
of work performance in some occupations (Barrick, Mount, & Judge,
2001). IQ, conscientiousness and extraversion differ not only in their
predictive validity for positive life outcomes, but also in their relation-
ship with negative behaviours like substance use. Whereas IQ and con-
scientiousness are associated with lower levels of substance use (Bogg &
Roberts, 2004; Turiano, Whiteman, Hampson, Roberts, & Mroczek,
2012), extraversion is related to more smoking (Munafo, Zetteler, &
263
R.M. Latham, S. von Stumm / Personality and Individual Differences 119 (2017) 262–265
 Clark, 2007), higher alcohol consumption and illegal drug use
(Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt, & Dubanoski, 2007; Turiano et al., 2012).
Moreover, interaction models have shown that individuals low on
conscientiousness and high on extraversion have the highest
probability of illegal drug use (Turiano et al., 2012).
Our finding that mothers emphasise extraversion – and, to a lesser
extent, agreeableness – over IQ and conscientiousness match findings
from an analysis of students' ratings of 300 adjectives on the degree to
which the adjectives provide information about ‘what a person is really
like’ (Willams, Munick, Saiz, & FormyDuval, 1995). Adjectives associat-
ed with extraversion and agreeableness were rated as being more infor-
mative than adjectives representing conscientiousness, openness and
neuroticism, although the reasons for this differentiation were unclear
(Willams et al., 1995).
The current study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to explore
mothers' appreciation of the relative importance of IQ and the Big Five
personality traits for their children. Although not without limitations,
our findings raise interesting questions for future research. For one, it
is possible that mothers' preference for extraversion is the result of a co-
hort effect, whereby the current zeitgeist, rather than mothers them-
selves, values and encourages extraversion. Future studies may seek to
investigate what mothers actually do to promote extraversion in their
children and explore the preferences of mothers from differing ethnici-
ties and cultures. For another, mothers and fathers may differ in the
traits they favour for their child. An evolutionary perspective suggests
that females place importance on characteristics – such as extraversion
and agreeableness – that facilitate social relationships; whereas males
may show a proclivity for traits that promote achievement and the accu-
mulation of resources, such as intelligence and conscientiousness (Buss,
2015). It would therefore be of interest for future studies to examine the
views of fathers as well as mothers. Furthermore, mothers' preferences
for traits may change over time, as their child ages and experiences

 different environments and challenges. As we currently only focused on
infants, we can only speculate if mothers' appreciation for extraversion
will eventually give way to preferences for other traits, including IQ and
conscientiousness that play more important roles once children have
started formal education.
