Dynamic polarisation of tumour cells is essential for metastasis. While the role of polarisation
during dedifferentiation and migration is well established, polarisation of metastasising
tumour cells during phases of detachment has not been investigated. Here we identify and
characterise a type of polarisation maintained by single cells in liquid phase termed single-cell
(sc) polarity and investigate its role during metastasis. We demonstrate that sc polarity is an
inherent feature of cells from different tumour entities that is observed in circulating tumour
cells in patients. Functionally, we propose that the sc pole is directly involved in early
attachment, thereby affecting adhesion, transmigration and metastasis. In vivo, the meta-
static capacity of cell lines correlates with the extent of sc polarisation. By manipulating sc
polarity regulators and by generic depolarisation, we show that sc polarity prior to migration
affects transmigration and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

etastases are the major cause of cancer-related deaths1,2.
Despite novel promising targeted cancer therapies,
patients diagnosed with systemic metastatic disease are
no longer eligible for curative treatment options in many cancer
subtypes3–5 necessitating research on additional, broadly applic-
able strategies for metastasis intervention. Metastasis is a multi-
step process comprising dedifferentiation, dissociation and local
invasion of primary tumour cells, intravasation into blood or
lymph vessels, survival and transport in circulation, arrest in
microvessels of distant organs and extravasation and metastatic
outgrowth6.
Throughout the metastatic process, solid tumour cells establish
distinct types of polarity, such as apical–basal polarity in the
tissue context of established primary or metastatic tumours or
front–back polarity during migratory phases7,8. The metastatic
cascade thus involves dynamic depolarisation and repolarisation
of metastasising cells, reflecting their high plasticity. However, the
polarisation of cells during liquid or detached phases and the
relevance of such polarisation for metastasis have remained
unclear.
Here we identify a distinct type of polarity termed single-cell
(sc) polarity that tumour cells maintain in liquid phase. Sc
polarity is defined by the intrinsic presence of an ezrin- and actin-
rich pole in absence of an extracellular stimulus in non-adhering,
non-migrating cells. We characterise sc polarity in tumour cell
lines and human tumour specimens from biopsies collected in
liquid phase and investigate the role of sc polarity in human
tumour cells, mouse models of metastasis and ex vivo. We find
that sc polarity affects attachment, adhesion, transmigration and
metastasis.
Results
Tumour cells maintain their polarity in liquid phase. To
investigate sc polarity in tumour cells in liquid phase, polarity
markers of different polar structures of single cells9–13 were
imaged in human SkMel2 melanoma cells in suspension (Fig. 1a).
Ezrin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as endogenous
ezrin, moesin, Radixin-GFP and phosphorylated ezrin/radixin/
moesin proteins accumulated at one pole of single cells in sus-
pension (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Additionally, polar
accumulation of F-actin and the plasma membrane (PM) recep-
tors CD44, β1-Integrin, melanoma cell adhesion molecule
(MCAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was
observed (Fig. 1a). The PM itself was accumulated at the pole and
enriched
with
phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2,
Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a) while the polarity regulator
Protein Kinase C ζ did not co-localize with the ezrin pole
(Fig. 1a). Interestingly, the apical marker podocalyxin was
polarised in detached cells, however, independently of the ezrin
pole, localising to a PM area located distal to the nucleus (Fig. 1a),
demonstrating that sc polarity is distinct from apical–basal
polarity. Furthermore, in suspension the ezrin pole was not
aligned with the nuclear–centrosomal axis, distinguishing it from
uropod-like structures of amoeboid migrating cells12,13 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b).
The PM is convoluted at the site of ezrin accumulation as
demonstrated by correlative light and electron microscopy
(CLEM) of SkMel2 cells expressing ezrin-GFP in suspension
(Fig. 1b). The PM folds were larger than microvilli or shedded
microvesicles and connected to the cell body, as confirmed by
serial tomography (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Movie 1). Ribosomes,
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria were identified
and visualised inside the PM folds (Fig. 1c, d). Furthermore, an
actin-rim was observed at the base of the pole structure (Fig. 1e),
corroborating the phalloidin staining (Fig. 1a). Analysis of pole
morphologies revealed two subpopulations of polarised cells, with
cap-like or spot-like, sometimes protruding poles (Supplementary
Fig. 1c, Supplementary Movies 2 and 3).
To assess the dynamics of sc polarisation, we performed
polarity assays with detached SkMel2 cells maintained in
suspension (Fig. 2a). The fraction of polarised cells, which is
defined as the percentage of cells forming an ezrin pole, decreased
with a T1/2 of 1 h. Even after 6 h of depolarisation, 39% of cells
remained polarised (Fig. 2a). When maintained in suspension on
a non-adhesive (poly-HEMA) substrate, most cells maintained
their poles over hours, while only few cells displayed dynamic
poles (Supplementary Movie 4). Polarised cells were detected
throughout a period of 10 weeks (Fig. 2b). After 4 h in
suspension, cells started to aggregate (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
The distribution of cell-cycle stages as measured by ki67-
positivity14,15 remained equal for polarised and unpolarised cells
in suspension (Fig. 2c). Polarisation was observed among
ki67high, ki67low and ki67neg cells (Fig. 2c, d), indicating that sc
polarity is not specifically associated with a certain cell-cycle
stage.
Apoptotic
cells

ezrin
distribution (Fig. 2e). Imaging of detaching SkMel2 cells showed
that the pole was frequently generated from a retracting
protrusion where ezrin accumulated and remained as a stable
spot upon cell rounding (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Movie 5), similar
to
ezrin
accumulation
in
physiological
processes
such
as
morphological
switch
to
amoeboid
shape
(Supplementary
Movie 6) or tail retraction11. In cells with more than one
retracting protrusion, multiple ezrin spots fused into one pole
(Supplementary Movie 7). A minor population of cells developed
the pole from a preformed ezrin-rich site at the flank of the cell
(Supplementary Movie 8). In dividing cells, ezrin accumulated at
the cleavage furrow10 (Fig. 2d, g) and remained polarised in
daughter cells after division (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Movie 9).
These data indicate that single tumour cells in liquid phase
maintain a polarisation of ezrin, actin and the PM that constitutes
a 'memory' of a previous polarised state, irrespective of the type of
initial polarisation event.
Sc polarity is observed in tumour cells from patients. Polar-
isation of ezrin-GFP and F-actin was also observed in detached
cells from different tumour entities, including melanoma, color-
ectal adenocarcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma and breast invasive ductal carcinoma (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Table 1), demonstrating that sc polarity con-
stitutes a general mechanism by which detached tumour cells of
different entities maintain their polarity.
To ascertain whether our observations in cell lines also hold
true for human specimens, we investigated tumour cells from
liquid-phase biopsies of cancer patients for the presence of ezrin
caps or spots (Supplementary Table 2). We observed polarisation
of ezrin and CD44 in cells from pleural effusion (PE) or ascitic
effusion (AE) of pancreatic and breast cancer patients (Fig. 3b,
Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Movie 10) showing that
sc polarity occurs in human patients. Additionally, we detected sc
polarity in single circulating tumour cells (CTCs) isolated from
peripheral blood of metastatic breast cancer patients (Fig. 3c,
Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Movie 11) and in a
cluster of CTCs from a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patient
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). Polarisation of ezrin, phalloidin, β1-
Integrin and MCAM was observed in CTCs (Supplementary
Fig. 2d–f). Malignant origin of CTCs was confirmed by single-cell
array comparative hybridization16 (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).
Ezrin polarisation was also confirmed in single, disseminated
melanoma or non-SCLC cells in lymph node specimens of
patients (Fig. 3d) and even observed in single, round melanoma

 cells within the tumour mass of established primary and
metastatic melanomas (Fig. 3e), however, at a very low frequency
(<0.1%). The fraction of polarised cells was increased (~1–20%)
in cell lines derived from these tumours (Supplementary Fig. 3d)
when cells were singularised in suspension, indicating that
detachment favours sc polarity. Altogether, our data show that
sc polarity occurs in different tumour entities in the liquid phase
and in single cells at different steps of the metastatic cascade.
Sc polarity is correlated with tumour metastasis. In order to
investigate the role of sc polarity in metastasis in vivo, an MDA-
MB-231 xenograft mouse model17 was used to isolate GFP-
labelled CTCs, assess their polarisation state and measure the
metastatic burden in the lung (Fig. 4a). The number of CTCs in
the blood showed no clear correlation with the number of tumour
cells in the lung. However, the log metastatic capacity of the
CTCs, defined as number of tumour cells in the lung normalised

 by number of CTCs in the blood of each mouse, showed clear
correlation with the fraction of polarised CTCs (Fig. 4a), indi-
cating that increased sc polarity is associated with a higher
metastatic activity of CTCs. Furthermore, sc polarity was sig-
nificantly lower in parental A375 human melanoma (Fig. 4b),
TD-2 mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Fig. 4c)18 or
B16-F0 mouse melanoma (Fig. 4d) than in more metastatic
daughter cell lines derived from A37519, TD-218 or B16-F020.
Consistently, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines
from patients with distant metastasis (M1) displayed an increased
fraction of polarised cells as compared to cell lines from patients
without distant metastasis (M0) (Fig. 4e). Moreover, melanoma
cell lines derived from metastases also showed increased sc
polarity as compared to cell lines derived from primary mela-
noma21 (Fig. 4f). Altogether, these data show a correlation
between sc polarity and the cell-intrinsic metastatic potential of
tumour cells in mouse models and human tumour cells.
The sc pole is involved in early cell attachment. To measure the
orientation of the pole during attachment, SkMel2 cells expres-
sing ezrin-GFP were seeded onto plastic or a layer of human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Cells were fixed after 5
or 30 min (Fig. 5a) and non-attached cells were removed by
gentle washing. The ezrin pole was predominantly oriented
towards the substrate (plastic or HUVEC) at 5 min suggesting an
active role of the pole in attachment. At 30 min after seeding, the
pole shifted towards the distal side (Fig. 5a, b). This change in
orientation was also confirmed in SkMel28 and A375 melanoma
cells (Fig. 5c). Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) demon-
strated close contact of the pole to the substrate at 5 min (Fig. 5d).
Attachment with the pole and reorientation was also observed by
confocal live-cell imaging (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Movies 12–14),
showing persistence of the ezrin pole throughout the process.
However, rapid reorientation of the pole towards the substrate
upon
attachment
cannot
be
excluded.

 accumulated ezrin at the distal side upon attachment (Supple-
mentary Movie 15), similar to a previously described moesin
cap9. The finding that the early orientation towards the substrate
was also observed on plastic or glass surfaces suggests that these
initial interactions between sc pole and substrate are unspecific
and not receptor-mediated.
We next investigated the polarisation of human melanoma
cells during seeding in the human liver, one of the target sites for
melanoma metastasis22, using an ex vivo liver perfusion system
(Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 7, K.Esser et al., manuscript in

 perfusion. After injection of tumour cells, the liver was perfused
for 5 min in order to remove non-attached cells before fixation.
Distribution, attachment and orientation of retained melanoma
cells were assessed by immunofluorescence and immunohisto-
chemistry (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 7). Most melanoma
cells were mechanically arrested in liver sinusoids and deformed
(Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). In addition, single, round cells
predominantly oriented with the pole towards the attachment site
were identified in larger vessels (Fig. 5f and Supplementary
Fig. 7d). Altogether, these experiments show that melanoma cells
are initially oriented with the pole towards their attachment site
in vitro as well as in the human liver ex vivo and that the pole is
in close contact with the substrate, indicating that the pole is
directly involved in early attachment.
MCAM, Merlin and MLC regulate sc polarity and transmi-
gration. To investigate the regulation of sc polarity, we first
analysed the effects of ezrin overexpression, knockdown (kd) or
mutant ezrin on sc polarity. Kd or overexpression of ezrin showed
no relevant effect on the fraction of polarised SkMel2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). The phospho-mimetic ezrin-TD and
the
non-phosphorylable
ezrin-TA
mutants
both
displayed
decreased fractions of polarised cells (Fig. 6a), indicating that
ezrin phosphorylation turnover but not ezrin expression levels
play a role in the regulation of the polar localisation of ezrin.
However, secondary effects due to overexpression of ezrin or
mutants cannot be excluded23. We therefore identified other
cellular factors that affect sc polarity and investigated their effect
on transmigration and experimental metastasis.
One of the proteins that co-localised with the ezrin pole was
MCAM (Figs. 1a and 6b), which is a melanoma progression
marker24 involved in adhesion, intracellular signaling and
regulation of the rear of migrating cells25–30. In SkMel2 cells,
overexpression of MCAM increased the fraction of polarised cells
(Fig. 6c). This effect is not limited to MCAM, as overexpression of
the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) L1-CAM or ICAM also
increased the fraction of polarised cells (Fig. 6d), although to a
lesser extent. Consistently, kd of MCAM using small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) reduced the fraction of polarised cells (Fig. 6e).
Ezrin was evenly localised and not decreased at the PM of MCAM
kd cells (Supplementary Fig. 8e). MCAM kd also reduced
adhesion of cells under flow conditions (Fig. 6f). In transwell
assays, overexpression of MCAM enhanced transmigration
through a layer of HUVEC (Fig. 6g), whereas MCAM kd reduced
transmigration (Fig. 6h). Interestingly, these effects were also
observed
without
HUVEC,
indicating
a
cell-autonomous
mechanism (Fig. 6g, h). A positive feedback mechanism between
MCAM
and
ezrin
has
been
proposed
involving
direct
MCAM–ezrin interaction26. However, deletion of the ezrin-
interaction motif KKGK in MCAM (MCAMΔKKGK)26 did not
alter the subcellular distribution of MCAM (Fig. 6b) or revert the
effect of MCAM overexpression on ezrin polarisation (Fig. 6c)
and transmigration (Fig. 6g). Moreover, ezrin overexpression did
not decisively increase the fraction of cells displaying polarised
MCAM (Fig. 6i), indicating that the regulation of sc polarity by
MCAM is independent of positive feedback or direct interactions
between MCAM and ezrin.
In vivo, overexpression of wild-type (wt) Mcam as well as
McamΔKKGK increased the number of experimental metastases
(Fig. 7a) as well as early metastatic seeding (Fig. 7b) of B16-F0
mouse melanoma cells to mouse lungs. While overexpression of
wt Mcam had no effect on tumour size, overexpression of
McamΔKKGK reduced the size of experimental metastases
(Supplementary Fig. 9c), indicating that the interaction between
Mcam and ezrin plays no role in tumour seeding but in tumour
growth. Consistently, kd of Mcam decreased experimental
metastasis (Fig. 7c) as well as early metastatic seeding (Fig. 7d)
of B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells, corroborating our in vitro
observations. The effect of Mcam kd on long-term experimental
metastasis (Fig. 7c) was more pronounced than the effect on
metastatic seeding (Fig. 7d), suggesting that MCAM also plays a
role during later steps of metastasis following metastatic seeding.
As in SkMel2 cells, polarisation and transmigration were induced
by Mcam or McamΔKKGK overexpression and reduced by
Mcam kd in the mouse cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b, e, f).
The size of tumour nodules was not affected by Mcam kd
(Supplementary Fig. 9g). Analysis of MCAM expression in
human melanoma tissue microarrays (TMAs) revealed that
MCAM
was
more
frequently
expressed
in
metastases
as
compared to primary melanomas (p = 0.0001, Fig. 7e, f and
Supplementary Table 3) in agreement with previous findings31.
Altogether, these results demonstrate that MCAM positively
regulates sc polarity, transmigration and metastasis and reveal an
additional, cell-autonomous mechanism by which overexpression
of CAMs can favour metastasis.
Merlin, the product of the tumour--suppressor gene neurofi-
bromatosis type II (NF2), is a regulator of sc polarity during cell
division10. In detached SkMel2 cells, endogenous merlin was
mostly cytoplasmic, but weak staining at the PM and pole was
also observed (Fig. 8a). In polarity assays, kd of NF2 decreased the
fraction of polarised cells (Fig. 8b). Ezrin was evenly distributed
and not decreased at the PM in NF2 kd cells (Supplementary
Fig. 11b). Consistently, NF2 kd also reduced adhesion under flow
(Fig. 8c) and transmigration of SkMel2 cells through HUVEC or
membrane (Fig. 8d). This result contrasts previous findings in cell
lines, where kd of NF2 resulted in increased transmigration32. We
therefore performed additional polarity and transmigration assays
in three different melanoma cell lines A375, SkMel28 and
WM1366 with NF2 kd (Supplementary Fig. 11c), demonstrating
that the effect of loss of merlin is cell type-dependent.
Importantly, the effect on transmigration in each of the cell lines
was correlated with the effect on sc polarity (Supplementary
Fig. 11c). B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells with kd of Nf2 displayed
significantly decreased experimental metastasis in vivo (Fig. 8e),
correlating with reduced sc polarity and transmigration (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11d, e). Nf2 kd had no effect on tumour size
(Supplementary Fig. 11f). Our data indicate that merlin, while
being a negative regulator of tumourigenesis33, can be a positive
regulator of transmigration and metastasis of tumour cells.

 Myosin light chain (MLC) was previously shown to regulate
polarisation of amoeboid migrating cells34,35. In SkMel2 cells,
phosphorylated MLC (P-MLC) strongly accumulated at the pole
(Fig. 8f), while GFP-MLC was distributed cytoplasmic, demon-
strating local activation of MLC at the pole. Overexpression of wt
MLC (Fig. 8g) or the increase of phosphorylated MLC by 50 nM
calyculin A (Fig. 8h and Supplementary Fig. 13a) enhanced sc
polarity, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative (dn)
MLC mutant (dnMLC, Fig. 8i) or the decrease of MLC activity by
blebbistatin (Fig. 8j and Supplementary Fig. 13b) reduced sc
polarity in SkMel2 cells.
We next investigated the connections between merlin, MCAM
and MLC (Fig. 8k–m). Reduction of merlin levels in SkMel2 cells
overexpressing MCAM reverted the fraction of polarised cells to
control levels (Fig. 8k), indicating that merlin is required for the
polarity-inducing effect of MCAM. Co-expression of wt MLC

Fig. 4 Sc polarity correlates with metastatic potential. a GFP+ CTCs isolated from MDA-MB-231-GFP tumour-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. 6),
quantified (as the percentage of circulating PBMCs) and analysed for sc polarity by phalloidin staining and imaging of actin polarisation. Lung tumour
burden was assessed by the number of GFP+ cells/total lung cells. Number of CTCs is plotted against number of tumour cells in the lung (left) or fraction
of polarised CTCs against logarithmised metastatic capacity (tumour cells in the lung normalised by tumour cells in the blood, middle) (Pearson’s
correlation). Lower panel: representative density plots of mice with the lowest (left) and highest (right) tumour burden in the lung, showing 8000 events
gated as intact and viable single cells by DAPI exclusion. b Fraction of polarised cells in suspension measured in parental A375P and the more metastatic
daughter cell line A375-M2 expressing ezrin-GFP (n = 6, mean ± SD, paired t-test). c Fraction of polarised cells in suspension measured in parental TD and
the more metastatic daughter cell lines P1 and P2 expressing ezrin-GFP (n = 6, mean ± SD, paired t-tests). d Fraction of polarised cells in suspension
measured in parental B16-F0 and the more metastatic daughter cell lines B16-F1, B16-F10 and B16-BL6 expressing ezrin-GFP (n = 6, mean ± SD, paired t-
tests). e Patient-derived ccRCC cell lines from M0 or M1 stage at early passages analysed in suspension for sc polarity by staining and imaging of actin
polarisation. (n = 3, mean ± SD, repeated-measures ANOVA). f Patient-derived melanoma cell lines isolated either from primary melanoma (left) or
metastases (right) analysed in suspension (spotted on a TMA) for fraction of polarised cells by staining and imaging of actin. Samples containing ≥3
polarised melanoma cells in a spot were graded as polarised (grey); samples containing 0–2 polarised melanoma cells were graded as unpolarised (white)
(n = 13 for primary melanoma, n = 27 for metastases, Fisher’s exact test)

 together with MCAM did not further increase sc polarity as
compared to MCAM expression alone, but co-expression of
dnMLC decreased the fraction of polarised cells to control levels
(Fig. 8l), showing that MLC activity is required for the polarity-
inducing effect of MCAM. Furthermore, activation of MLC by 10
nM calyculin A had no relevant effect on control cells but
reverted sc polarity in NF2 and MCAM kd cells to control levels
(Fig. 8m and Supplementary Fig. 13c). We therefore conclude
that phosphorylation of MLC is a major regulatory mechanism
for sc polarity in liquid phase.
Generic depolarisation decreases transmigration and seeding
in vivo. As additional effects of MCAM or Merlin levels on
transmigration and metastasis cannot be excluded27,32, we
investigated the effect of generic depolarisation (without genetic
or chemical manipulation) on transmigration and in vivo seeding
of melanoma cells into the lung. SkMel2 cells were depolarised by
incubation in suspension for 3 h, which reduced the fraction of
polarised cells by 30% compared to 30 min in suspension
(Fig. 9a). Depolarisation had no decisive effect on cell viability,
apoptosis or growth (Supplementary Fig. 15a–c) or on the
expression of PM receptors at the cell surface (Supplementary
Fig. 15d). Using polarised and depolarised cells from the same
preparation,
transmigration
assays
were
performed
either
through HUVEC (Fig. 9b) or through membranes (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 15f, g). Cells depolarised prior to seeding showed
strongly reduced transmigration after 4 h and slightly reduced

 transmigration after 7 h compared to polarised cells (Fig. 9b and
Supplementary Fig. 15f), demonstrating that the state of polar-
isation prior to seeding affects transmigration. The experiment
was also extended to 24 h of transmigration time to allow seeded
cells to (re-) polarise upon attachment to the substrate9
(Supplementary Movie 15). After 24 h, no clear difference
between polarised and depolarised cells was observed (Fig. 9c and
Supplementary Fig. 15g), showing that generic depolarisation
does not relevantly affect the migratory capacity of cells. We
therefore investigated whether sc polarity affects adhesion of cells

 (Fig. 9c, d). Adhesion of depolarised cells was delayed as com-
pared to polarised cells up to 60 min after seeding (Fig. 9c).
Furthermore, adhesion of single, unpolarised cells was delayed
over the same time course compared to single, polarised cells
within the same, untreated population of cells (Fig. 9d and
Supplementary Movie 16). However, after 90 min, polarised and
depolarised cells had adhered to the same extent. Under flow
conditions, the slower adhesion kinetics of depolarised cells led to
a reduced number of attached/adhered cells compared to polar-
ised cells (Fig. 9e). The transient delay in adhesion over time
(Fig. 9c, d) was consistent with the effect of generic depolarisation
on transmigration (Fig. 9b). The transient, transmigration-
reducing effect of generic depolarisation was also observed in
U87 glioblastoma36,37 (Fig. 9f, g) and semi-adherent SNU-1 sto-
mach carcinoma cells38 (Fig. 9h, i), which can both grow in
adherent as well as in suspension phase. Depolarisation had no
relevant effect on cell viability, apoptosis, growth or expression of
PM receptors at the cell surface of U87 or SNU-1 cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 17).
To investigate the effect of generic depolarisation on seeding of
cells into the mouse lung in vivo, polarised (30 min in
suspension) and depolarised (3 h in suspension) SkMel2 cells
from the same preparation expressing ezrin-GFP were injected
into the tail vein of mice and the number of GFP+ cells was
quantified in the lung after 30 min (Fig. 9j, k). Histological images
and a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction using step-cuts
from lung tissue (Supplementary Movies 17 and 18) demon-
strated that the seeding of cells was higher in the polarised
fraction than in the depolarised fraction (Fig. 9j). The amount of
GFP+ cells was quantified by three different methods (Fig. 9k and
Supplementary Fig. 18a) to correct for effects of differences in
tissue density. All three quantifications revealed a significantly
decreased number of seeded cells from the depolarised fraction as
compared to the polarised fraction (Fig. 9k and Supplementary
Fig. 18a). The same effect of generic depolarisation on seeding
into the lung was observed using U87 or SNU-1 cells (Fig. 9l, m
and Supplementary Fig. 18b, c). Altogether, these experiments
show that sc polarisation prior to attachment directly advances
adhesion, transmigration and in vivo seeding of melanoma,
glioblastoma and gastric cancer cells.
Sc polarity affects attachment, adhesion and metastatic seed-
ing. In order to investigate which steps of early metastatic seeding
are affected by sc polarity, a basic compartmental model was
generated (Fig. 10a and Supplementary Fig. 19) comprising cir-
culation, attachment, adherence and tissue residence of unmixed
populations of 100% polarised or 100% depolarised cells using
parameters for transfer rates between compartments measured
for mixed populations of polarised and depolarised cells in
Fig. 9d, e, k and Supplementary Fig. 18a.
This model was used to simulate the individual steps of early
metastatic seeding and assess the differences in attachment,
adhesion and tissue residence between polarised and depolarised
cells (Fig. 10c–e and Supplementary Fig. 19). The model predicts
an approximately 1.3-fold higher adherence rate for polarised
cells (3.95%/s) as compared to depolarised cells (3.02%/s), which
is in agreement with our experimental data on adhesion kinetics
(Fig. 9d). Furthermore, the model predicts a three-fold attach-
ment rate for polarised cells (10.74%/s) compared to depolarised
cells (3.81%/s) as suggested by our data showing attachment of
cells via the sc pole (Fig. 5). The predicted tissue residence rate of
polarised cells (0.06%/s) is also slightly enhanced as compared to
depolarised cells (0.05%/s) but considerably lower than attach-
ment and adhesion rates and therefore contributing to the
difference in tissue residence only to a minor extent. Simulation
of the full chain of events taking all compartments into account
demonstrates that a slight delay in attachment (Fig. 10c) and
adhesion (Fig. 10d) of depolarised cells results in considerably
decreased tissue residence (Fig. 10e) thus predicting a strong
effect of sc polarity on metastatic seeding as observed in our
in vivo experiments with mixed populations (Fig. 9k–l).
In summary, the model allows us to confirm our hypothesis
that sc polarity increases attachment and adhesion rates (and to a
minor extent tissue residence rate), leading to enhanced tissue
residence of polarised cells.
Discussion
We have performed a comprehensive investigation of sc polarity
in detached tumour cells and its role in metastasis. We define sc
polarity as a type of polarity that cells adopt in liquid phase
without directional stimulus in vitro and in vivo. Sc polarity is
characterized by a round morphology of cells and formation of a
pole containing ezrin, F-actin, P-MLC, PIP2, CAMs, integrins and
PM folding. Despite distinct functions, morphologies and origins,
the molecular composition of the sc pole overlaps with that of
uropod-like structures12,13, cell capping during cell division10,
adhesion9 or leucocyte capping11, invadosomes39, the immuno-
logical synapse (IS)40 or the distal pole of IS-forming cells41,
which might favour the transition between the sc pole and such
structures. While cells forming such structures are fully polarised
by cell–cell attachment, cell–matrix attachment or migration and
centrosome positioning, cells displaying sc polarity in liquid
phase
show
no

keleton that cells maintain during phases of detachment inde-
pendent of the initial polarisation type. In circulation, cells may
acquire sc polarity by further mechanisms in addition to
detachment or cell division, such as interaction with immune cells
or platelets42 or confinement34,35 by mechanical entrapment. Sc
polarity might furthermore reflect the tendency of metastasising
cells to adapt their polarity to changing environmental require-
ments during the metastatic process and thus enhance their
polarisation plasticity. Sc polarity of tumour cells was observed

 not only in cancer patients in the liquid phase (CTCs, PE and AE
cells) but also at other steps of the metastatic process and might
favour metastasis at different steps during tumour progression by
maintaining a generic type of polarity (Fig. 10f).
Our in vitro, in vivo and in silico data suggest that sc polarity
affects transmigration and metastasis by two distinct mechan-
isms, favouring early attachment by unspecific interaction with
substrate and advancing adhesion by 'pre-polarisation'. First, local
accumulation of PM rich in highly glycosylated proteins may lead
to a high tendency for unspecific interaction of the sc pole with
any substrate and thereby enhance early attachment as suggested
by the preferential orientation of the pole towards the substrate
(Fig. 5). Second, pre-polarisation of the PM and actin cytoske-
leton might advance the formation of a distal cap9 and thereby
favour adhesion. During the metastatic process in vivo, these two
effects of sc polarity could lead to increased vascular retention
and accelerated adhesion of CTCs.
The extent of sc polarity correlated with metastatic properties
of human tumour cell lines as well as CTCs in a mouse model.
Our findings agree with previous concepts43,44 suggesting that
not only quantity but rather quality of CTCs and disseminated
tumour cells influence the chance of successful metastatic colo-
nisation and that sc polarity may constitute such a metastatic
quality of CTCs. The therapeutic potential of inhibition of sc
polarity to target cancer metastasis will need to be evaluated in
clinical studies. Research into molecular determinants involved in
regulation of sc polarity will provide further insight into the
underlying cellular mechanisms.
Methods
Definition of sc polarisation. Throughout this study, a sc pole was defined as a
single, continuous PM area encompassing less than half of the circumference of the
cell image enriched in ezrin (or phalloidin) fluorescence by two-fold or higher as
compared to the remaining area of the PM.
Cell culture. Melanoma cell lines were kindly provided by Professor R. Marais
(CRUK, Manchester) and Professor C. Marshall (ICR, London) with permission
from Professor M. Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia), Caco-2 and DLD-1
by Dr. K.-P. Janssen (Klinikum rechts der Isar, Munich), MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 by Professor R. Faessler (MPI Munich), U87 (ATCC-HTB14)45 by Dr. S.
Stangl (TU Munich) and SNU-1 by Professor M. Gerhard (TU Munich). Cell
lines were not specifically authenticated. U87 and TD-2 cells were maintained
in RPMI (Gibco); all other tumour cell lines in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Gibco) with Glutamax and 10% foetal calf serum (FCS,
Gibco), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). HUVEC
were maintained in medium 199 (Sigma), with 20% FCS, 2 mM ultraglutamine
(Lonza), 25 IU/ml penicillin and 25 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 62.5 µg/ml
Heparin (Sigma) and 30 µg/ml endothelial growth factor supplement (Sigma).
SkMel2 cells stably expressing ezrin-GFP were fluorescence-activated cell sorted
(FACS) for high green fluorescence and maintained in selection medium with 1
mg/ml G418/geneticin (Sigma). B16-F0 cells stably transfected with pEpi-GFP,
pEpi-MCAM or pEpiMCAM-ΔKKGK were maintained in selection medium
containing 5 µg/ml blasticidin (Applichem). B16-F1 cells stably transduced with
short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were maintained in selection medium containing
625 ng/ml puromycin (Calbiochem). To image amoeboid morphology, cells
were grown on top of a thick layer of 1.7 mg/ml bovine collagen I (Gibco
A10644-01). Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma infection using the
PlasmoTest Kit (InvivoGen). All cells were split 1 day before use. Transfections
with plasmids and/or siRNAs were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 or
3000 (Thermo Fisher Sci.); transductions with viral particles were performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Growth and viability of polarised and
depolarised fractions of SkMel2, U87 and SNU-1 cells was assessed by (i) trypan
blue staining and counting (ViCell XR, Beckman Coulter), (ii) plating of cells
for 24 h, fixation in 4% formaldehyde, staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-pheny-
lindole (DAPI), imaging of nuclei and counting using ImageJ46, (iii) AnnexinV
staining (BD), (iv) live-dead staining using EMA (Life Technologies) and (v)
LDH assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit, LDH, Roche) and (vi) soft agar colony-
formation assay (CytoSelect 96-Well Cell Transformation Assay, Cell Biolabs,
Inc.). For aggregation assays, cells were stained with 1 µM Cell Tracker Green
CMFDA (Life Technologies) for 30 min, recovered in DMEM with 10% FCS for
24 h, detached with Versene (EDTA, Lonza) and fixed in suspension after the
indicated time. Aggregation (direct contact of 2, 3 or >3 cells) was quantified
from 20× widefield fluorescence images of fixed suspension cells. Growth of B16
cells was assessed using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (XTT, Roche). All n values
represent biological replicates.
Establishment and detachment of ccRCC cell lines. Primary clear cell renal
cancer-derived cell lines were established from tumour resection specimens of
ccRCC patients. Primary xenografts were established by implanting tumour pieces
of 1–2 mm3 into the renal capsule of NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl (NSG) mice
bred in the animal facility of the German Cancer Research Center. Primary
xenografts were resected at a volume of approximately 1 cm3, tumour pieces were
minced, dissociated by incubation with 1 μg/ml collagenase IV and DNase for 1 h
at 37 °C and filtered through a 100- and 70-µm mesh. In all, 5 × 106 cells were
seeded in T75 flasks in serum-free medium. Suspension and adherent cultures were
maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Established KIKA lines47 were authenticated
(Multiplexion) and tested for mycoplasma contaminations. After separation with
StemPro Accutase (Gibco), cells were resuspended in CO2-independent medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), incubated 1 h at 37 °
C in a tube rotator and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).
Adhesion assays. SkMel2 cells expressing ezrin-GFP were detached for 10 min
using Versene/EDTA, (Lonza) and incubated in DMEM for 30 min. Cells were
seeded onto 24-well cell culture dishes, fixed with 4% formaldehyde after 10, 30,
60 or 90 min and imaged using a 20× objective on an Olympus CKX41 with an
Olympus XM10 camera using the CellSens Standard software (Olympus). The
area per cell was measured using ImageJ46. Adhesion under flow was measured
using CellASIC ONIX microfluidic plates (EMD Millipore) using the capillary
mode according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To compare two conditions,
cells were either unstained or stained with 1 µM Cell Tracker Green CMFDA
(Life Technologies) for 30 min and recovered in DMEM with 10% FCS for 24 h. A
mix of 0.5 × 105 stained and 0.5 × 105 unstained cells were loaded in the flow
chamber for 5 min, maintained under flow in DMEM for 30 min and fixed after
30 min in 4% formaldehyde. Stained and unstained cells were quantified from
brightfield and fluorescence images. In all, 2 × 104 cells of the mix were seeded on
24-well plates and fixed after 24 h to normalise for exact cell numbers. For
adhesion of single cells, cells were seeded on chamber slides (µ-Slide 8 Well,
ibiTreat, Ibidi) and images of 30 µm stacks were recorded every minute on a Leica
TCS SP8 confocal microscope using a 10× objective and 2× zoom. Polarisation
was assessed on the first stack. The area of each cell after 0, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min
was quantified using ImageJ46 from projections of stacks. All n values represent
biological replicates.
Fig. 10 Model of the effects of sc polarity on metastatic seeding. a Scheme of the compartmental model generated from data shown in Fig. 9d, e, k and
Supplementary Fig. 18a. Transfer rates for polarised (pol) and depolarised (dep) cells defined as attachment rate (katt), adhesion rate (kadh) and tissue
residence rate (ktiss.res) are shown in Supplementary Figure 19b. b In silico simulation of the decrease of polarised and depolarised cells in the circulation
compartment showing that polarised cells leave circulation faster than depolarised cells due to increased attachment and adhesion rates. The number of
circulating cells rapidly decreases to 0 as the model does not account for recirculation due to circulatory pressure. c Simulation of attachment of polarised
and depolarised cells to substrate. The higher attachment rate of polarised cells leads to a higher peak population as compared to depolarised cells. The
rapid decrease in the number of attached cells is a result of the cells adhering and thus leaving the attachment compartment and entering the adhesion
compartment. d Simulation of adhesion of polarised and depolarised cells to substrate, showing faster adhesion of polarised cells as compared to
depolarised cells. The decrease in the number of adhered cells is a result of the cells extravasating and thus leaving the adhesion compartment and entering
the tissue residence compartment. e Simulation of tissue residence of polarised and depolarised cells, showing decreased tissue residence and thus
metastatic seeding of depolarised cells mainly due to delayed attachment and adhesion. f Model for possible roles of sc polarity during metastasis. Upon
dedifferentiation, detachment and rounding, single cells in the primary tumour form an ezrin-rich pole (i). This pre-polarisation may favour intravasation
(ii). During the liquid phase (iii) in blood, lymph or ascites fluid, tumour cells maintain their pole, which can facilitate their attachment by unspecific

 Polarity assays. SkMel2, B16 and TD-2 cells were detached using Versene/EDTA;
cells in Supplementary Table 1 were detached or singularised in suspension using
Trypsin. Resuspended cells were incubated in DMEM for 30 min, fixed in sus-
pension with 4% formaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
imaged in 96-well plates using a 10× or 20× objective on an Olympus CKX41 with
an Olympus XM10 camera using the CellSens Standard software (Olympus). B16
cells in Supplementary Fig. 9a, 9e and 11d were fixed in suspension, mounted on a
glass slide and imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 20× objective.
The fraction of cells with a polarised cap or spot per total round cells was counted
manually, blinded. For each experiment, images of at least five random areas were
acquired and at least 100 cells were analysed. All n values represent biological
replicates.
Transmigration assays. Transmigration was measured in transwell dishes
(Corning-Costar, Lowell MA, 8 µm pore size, 6.5 mm diameter). Inserts were either
used uncoated or coated with 0.1% gelatine (Sigma) for 30 min and 3.5 × 104
HUVEC (Cellworks, ZHC2301) for 3 days. For transmigration through HUVEC,
cells were stained with 1 µM (SkMel2) or 10 µM (B16) Cell Tracker Green CMFDA
(Life Technologies) for 30 min and recovered in DMEM with 10% FCS for 3 h
(SkMel2) or 12 h (B16). Cells were detached using Versene and incubated in
DMEM or HUVEC medium for 30 min. In all, 5 × 104 SkMel2 or B16 or 2 × 105
U87 cells were seeded on top of HUVEC, 106 (SkMel) or 5 × 105 (SNU-1) on the
transwell insert, incubated as indicated and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Cells on
the top of the membrane were removed, transmigrated cells were stained with
DAPI and membranes were mounted on a glass slide using Mowiol (Merck). Seven
random images were obtained of DAPI (for transmigration through membrane
only) or Cell Tracker Green (for transmigration through HUVEC) using a 10×
objective on an Olympus CKX41 with an Olympus XM10 camera using the
CellSens Standard software (Olympus). Cell numbers were quantified using Ima-
geJ46. All n values represent biological replicates performed as technical duplicates
and averaged; all experiments were normalised to an untransfected control.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Paraffin sections were stained manually
with haematoxylin and eosin or on a Bond MAX immunohistochemistry robot
(Leica) with antibodies at concentrations listed in Supplementary Table 4. For
immunohistochemical detection, the Bond MAX DAB-Kit (Bond Polymer Refine
Detection, DS9800) was used for double staining of melan A and MCAM in
combination with the Bond MAX Fast Red-Kit (Bond Polymer Refine Red
Detection, DS9390). Slides were scanned using a SCN400 slide scanner (Leica) and
analysed using the Tissue IA image analysis software (Slidepath, Leica).
Immunostaining of cells. Cells were detached using Versene/EDTA, incubated in
DMEM for 30 min, fixed in suspension in 4% formaldehyde, washed with PBS and
Tris buffer (100 mM Tris, pH = 7.4, 50 mM NaCl), permeabilised with 0.5% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 min, incubated in blocking solution (PBS, pH = 7.4, 1% BSA,
2% FCS) for 20 min, incubated with primary antibodies at concentrations listed in
Supplementary Table 4 for 12–18 h at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, incubated with
secondary antibody and phalloidin as listed under 'Antibodies and reagents' for 1 h,
washed with PBS, incubated with DAPI or ToPro3 for 5–15 min and washed 4
times with PBS. Cells were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories) and imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× oil
objective using the LAS software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Pole orientation in vitro. SkMel2, SkMel28 or A375 cells expressing ezrin-GFP
were seeded on chamber slides (µ-Slide 8-well, ibiTreat, Ibidi) uncoated or coated
with 0.1% gelatine and HUVEC grown to confluence for 3 days. Cells were fixed
with 4% formaldehyde 5, 30 or 45 min after seeding, washed with PBS and imaged.
Stacks of 25 or 50 images of random round cells with a pole were acquired on a
Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× oil objective using the LAS software
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Orientation of cells was assessed by two
independent researchers not involved in the project. All n values represent biolo-
gical replicates.
Widefield live cell imaging. SkMel2 cells stably expressing ezrin-GFP were grown
on chamber slides (µ-Slide 8-well, ibiTreat, Ibidi) to 70–80% confluence. Versene/
EDTA was added directly at the microscope and acquisition started immediately.
Fluorescence images were recorded using an Axiovert 200M and a Plan-neofluar
20×/0.5 NA objective equipped with a motorised heating stage, incubator (Zeiss
Microimaging) and an AxioCam MRm camera. Using the AxioVision Software
(Zeiss Microimaging), images were acquired every 30 s. Movies were exported and
processed using imageJ46.
Confocal live cell imaging. SkMel2 cells stably expressing ezrin-GFP were
detached using Versene/EDTA, resuspended and maintained in medium for 1 h,
seeded directly onto imaging slides (µ-Slide VI 0.4 ibiTreat, Ibidi) or imaging slides
coated with 0.1% gelatin and HUVEC grown to confluence and imaged directly
after seeding. HUVEC were stimulated with 2 ng/ml tumour necrosis factor-α
(Invitrogen) for 5 h before seeding of SkMel2. Stacks of 50 confocal images over 25
µm were recorded every minute using a 63× objective (HC PL APO CS2/1.40 oil)
on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope equipped with 405, 488, 552 and 638 nm
diode lasers and a heating chamber. Top and side views of the stacks were
reconstructed using the Leica LAS software and further processed using ImageJ46.
For temporal colour coding, the Time Series Color Coder by Kota Miura (CMCI,
EMBL Heidelberg) was used.
Interference reflection microscopy. SkMel2 cells stably expressing ezrin-GFP
were detached using Versene/EDTA, resuspended and maintained in DMEM for
1 h, seeded onto imaging slides (µ-Slide 8-well, glass bottom, Ibidi) coated with
2% BSA, fixed with 4% formaldehyde and carefully washed twice with PBS.
Interference reflection imaging48 was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
microscope. Reflection and fluorescence images were obtained using 488 nm
excitation and 480–497 nm or 503–559 nm emission wavelengths, respectively.
To produce an IRM image, the focus was adjusted near the glass surface to obtain
a zero-order interference image and the detector was adjusted for best contrast.
For the reflection image, the pinhole was opened to 4 airy units (AU). In addition
to the reflection image, a stack of 25 confocal fluorescence images was recorded in
the GFP channel with the pinhole set to 1 AU. Top and side views of the stacks
were reconstructed using the Leica LAS software and further processed using
ImageJ46.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells were detached with Versene/EDTA,
incubated for 30 min and fixed in 4% formaldehyde immediately or 2.5 h later.
Cells were washed three times with FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and
20 mM EDTA), stained with the respective antibody as listed in Supplementary
Table 4 for 30 min, washed twice with FACS buffer and, if indicated, stained
with secondary Alexa-488-labelled antibody. For live/dead staining using EMA
(Life Technologies), cells were not fixed but incubated with 2 µg/ml EMA for 20
min under light. Measurements were performed on a BD FACS Canto II with
the FACS Diva Software. Unstained cells were used as control. A single gate
(R1) was used to gate out cell debris and as stopping gate. For all measurements,
this gate covered at least 90% of total events. In all, 10,000–250,000 stopping
gate events were recorded for each measurement. Hardware settings were
maintained constant for all experiments. Analyses were performed using the
FlowJo software. Sorting of GFP-positive cells was performed on a BD FACS
Aria III.
Electron microscopy. SkMel2 cells were detached using Versene/EDTA, incubated
in DMEM for 30 min and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA, Electron Microscopy
Sciences) in 0.1 M PHEM buffer. Cells were pelleted and the subsequent EM
processing steps (OSO4, uranyl acetate (UA), dehydration, Epon embedding) were
performed on the entire pellet using a PELCO Biowave Pro microwave processor
containing ColdSpot (Ted Pella, Inc.). This instrument uses microwaves under
vacuum condition and controlled temperature. This has proven beneficial for EM
sample preparation, as it improves diffusion of the fixatives as well as the resin
during infiltration, giving better morphological results in a faster way49. In order to
achieve this, 2 min on-and-off cycles of 100 W were applied under vacuum during
glutaraldehyde and osmium steps and 1 min on-and-off cycles at 150 W for UA.
For each dehydration step, samples were subjected to 40 s incubation at 250 W.
Finally, infiltration was obtained with 3 min at 250 W for each step. For the entire
processing, the temperature was controlled and set to 21 °C. After polymerisation
of the resin at 60 °C for 48 h, blocks were sectioned with a Leica Ultracut S
microtome. Seventy or 300-nm-thick sections were collected on formvar-coated
slot grids and imaged with a Philips Biotwin CM120 (thin sections) or a FEI Tecnai
F30 (tomography) electron microscope. For EM tomography experiments, tomo-
gram reconstruction, segmentation and 3D rendering were carried out with the
IMOD software package50.
Correlative light and EM. SkMel2 cells expressing ezrin-GFP were detached
using Versene/EDTA, incubated in DMEM for 30 min, pelleted, resuspended in
20% BSA (Sigma 20 µl/10 cm dish) and cryo-immobilised using a high-pressure
freezing machine (HPM 010, BAL-TEC). Freeze-substitution with 0.1% UA in
acetone and embedding in Lowicryl resin51 was performed in an AFS2 machine
(Leica). The samples were incubated with 0.1% UA in acetone at −90 °C for 6 h.
The temperature was then raised to −45 °C (5 degrees/h) and the samples
incubated for 5 more hours. The freeze-substitution solution was then washed
out with dry acetone, before infiltration in Lowicryl HM20 resin (steps: 10%—
25%—50%—75%, 2 h each, followed by 3× rinses in 100% resin for 10 h each,
during which the temperature was slowly raised to −25 °C). Polymerization of
the resin was carried out with ultraviolet light at −25 °C. Sections (300 nm)
were cut from the polymerised resin block and picked up on carbon-coated
mesh grids. For fluorescence imaging, the grids were sandwiched with water
between two coverlips51 and imaged using an Olympus ScanR microscope and a
60× oil objective. Grids were then stained with UA and Reynolds lead citrate
and tilt series was acquired with a FEI Tecnai F30 electron microscope.
Tomograms were reconstructed using the IMOD software package50. Correla-
tion between fluorescence microscopic and EM images (single tomographic

visible in both imaging modalities.
Western blotting. Cells were detached from dishes using Versene/EDTA, incu-
bated in medium for 30 min, washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM
Tris, pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 2% Triton-X100, 1× complete pro-
tease inhibitor (Roche), 2× phosphatase inhibitor (Roche)). Protein concentrations
were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were fractionated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto poly-
vinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies are listed below and in Supplemen-
tary Table 4. Blots were developed on a ChemiDoc system (BioRad). Uncropped
blots are shown in Supplementary Figures 10, 12 and 14.
Antibodies and reagents. Primary antibodies, suppliers, catalogue numbers and
concentrations used for immunofluorescence, FACS or western blotting are shown
in Supplementary Table 4. Secondary Alexa-488 −546 or −633-labelled antibodies
(Thermo Fisher Sci.) for Immunofluorescence staining were used at a 1:500 dilu-
tion. Secondary HRP-labelled anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno Research) or anti-
rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Techn.) for western blotting were used 1:10,000.
DAPI (Life Technologies) was used at 1 µg/ml, ToPro3 (Life Technologies) at 1 µM
for 5–15 min, Vybrant DiI (Life Technologies) at 5 µl/ml for 10 min and
phalloidin-Alexa-546 or -Alexa-633 (Life Technologies) at 1:500 for 30 min.
CalyculinA (Cell Signaling Techn.) was used at 50 nM or 10 nM as indicated for 1
h. (−) Blebbistatin (Merck Millipore) was used at 2.5 µM for 24 h.
Plasmids, siRNAs and shRNAs. pEGFP-ezrin and ezrin mutants were kindly
provided by Professor Richard Lamb (University of Liverpool), mCherry-ezrin
and CFP-ezrin by Professor Christopher Marshall (ICR, London), GFP-MLC
and GFP-dnMLC by Professor Michael Olson (Beatson Institute, Glasgow),
plasmids expressing RFP-labelled PH domains by Professor Tamas Balla
(NICHD, NIH, Bethesda), PKCζ-GFP by Professor Peter Parker (CRICK
Institute, London), pEGFP-MCAM by Professor Natalie Ahn (Unversity of
Colorado Boulder), pcDNA3-mouseMCAM by Professor Judith Johnson
(University of Munich), pEPIto-deltaSMAR by Professor Manfred Ogris

Medical School, Boston), L1-CAM-Venus by Professor Dan Felsenfeldt (Mount
Sinai School of Medicine, NY) and β1-Integrin-GFP by Professor Maddy Par-
sons (King’s College London). To generate pEpi-MCAM, mouse Mcam was
amplified by PCR and inserted into the BglII/NheI sites in pEPIto-deltaSMAR
(replacing GFP). To generate mCherry-MCAM, GFP in pEGFP-MCAM was
replaced by mCherry using the BamHI/NotI sites. MCAMΔKKGK constructs
were created by one-step mutagenesis PCR52 to delete the KKGK motif in pEpi-
MCAM, pmCherry-MCAM and pEGFP-MCAM using the primers
ctatttcttctacctgccatgtg-gacgctcgggaaaacag and catggcaggtagaagaaataga-
gagcagcacccagcacag for mouse and ttcctctatctgccgtgcaggcgctcagggaagcagg and
cacggcagatagaggaaatagaggacagcgcccag for human MCAM. SiRNA pools against
human MCAM, NF2, ezrin and non-targeting control pool were on-target plus
smart pools from GE Healthcare. Lentiviral particles containing shRNAs
against mouse Nf2 (clones TRCN0000042519 and TRCN0000042520) and
mouse Mcam (clones TRCN0000113080 and TRCN0000113081) were from
Sigma (MISSION lentiviral transduction particles, SHCLNV and non-targeting
control SHC002V).
Animals. Mice were maintained under standard housing conditions and experi-
ments were performed according to the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Protection
Law and approved by the Veterinary Office of Kanton Zurich (TVA 20/2011) or
according to the German Animal Protection Law and approved by the Regier-
ungspräsidium Karlsruhe (TVA g240/11) or the Regierung Oberbayern, Bavaria,
Germany (TVA 55.2-1-54-2532-196-13).
Experimental metastasis. Female C57BL/6 mice of 8–10 weeks (Charles River
Laboratories, Germany) were intravenously injected with 1.5 × 105 B16-F1, B16-
F1-Nf2kd (M19), B16-F1 Nf2kd (M20), B16-F1 Mcamkd (M1), B16-F1 Mcamkd
(M2), B16-F1 n.t. (expressing non-targeting shRNA control), B16-F0, B16-F0 GFP,
B16-F0 Mcam or B16-F0 McamΔKKGK cells in random order. Mice were sacri-
ficed after 2 weeks. Lungs were perfused with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for
3 days, photographed and the number of metastatic foci determined blinded by
visual inspection. Numbers were normalised to the mean of the untransfected
control for each experiment. Lungs were embedded in paraffin blocks and 2 µm
sections stained for haematoxylin/eosin or ki67. No statistical methods were used
to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes were based on previous experience with
the models. All n values represent biological replicates.
Metastatic seeding to the mouse lung. Female C57BL/6 mice of 8–10 weeks
(Charles River Laboratories, Germany) were intravenously injected with 5 × 105
SkMel2 (ezrin-GFP), U87 (GFP) or SNU-1 (GFP) cells either polarised (30 min) or
depolarised (3 h after detachment) or with 1.5 × 106 B16-F1, B16-F1 Mcam kd
(M1), B16-F1 Mcam kd (M2), B16-F1 n.t. (expressing non-targeting shRNA
control), B16-F0, B16-F0 GFP, B16-F0 Mcam or B16-F0 McamΔKKGK cells in
random order. Thirty minutes after injection, mice were sacrificed, the lungs
perfused, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 3–5 days and embedded in paraffin in 2–4
pieces. Two-µm tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin/eosin and with
GFP, ki67 or gp100 antibody. All n values represent biological replicates.
Quantification of metastatic seeding to the mouse lung. Slides were scanned
using a Leica SCN400 slide scanner at 20× magnification. Analysis was performed
using Tissue IA (Slidepath, Leica). All slides within an experiment were analysed
with the same algorithm and settings. For each slide, 2–3 annotations were made to
cover most of the tissue avoiding staining artefacts and merged in the results.
For generic depolarisation experiments, 2 step cuts of 100 µm, and for MCAM
overexpression and kd experiments, 2–3 lung sections of each lung were analysed
using an algorithm for stained area with optimised colour definition files with
deconvoluted intensity threshold of 161 (generic depolarisation) or 165 (MCAM
manipulation). Tissue intensity threshold was set to 211 or 215, respectively. For
generic depolarisation experiments, the haematoxylin-positive area was measured
using a predefined deconvolution-haematoxylin colour definition file with a
deconvoluted intensity threshold of 230. All slides were analysed as GFP+ area per
total tissue area, GFP+ area per haematoxylin+ area and GFP+ cells per total
amount of cells. SkMel2 were in addition analysed by manual counting of GFP+
cells in 10 randomly chosen 40× view fields per slide. For MCAM overexpression
or kd experiments, all slides were analysed as melanoma gp100+ area per total
tissue area.
3D reconstruction of GFP+ cells seeding in the lung. 3D reconstruction of an
anatomical structure from 30 serial sections was generated using the Voloom
software (microDimensions GmbH, München, Germany). The virtual slide data
was loaded into Voloom where individual sections were automatically detected and
separated. For 3D reconstruction, consecutive sections were registered to each
other avoiding error propagation due to micro-artefacts like folding or tears. An
initial reconstruction result on low-resolution images was propagated from low- to
high-magnification levels inherently using the pyramidal structure of virtual slides.
The anatomical structure was then segmented from the volumetric histology data
using global thresholding and rendered with a green pseudo colour. The rendering
process is shown in Supplementary Movies 17 and 18.
Generation and analysis of CTCs from MDA-MB-231 xenografts. Six-week-old
NSG immunocompromised mice (Jackson Laboratories) underwent surgery under
isofluorane anestesia. A cell suspension containing 100,000 GFP-positive MDA-
MB-231 cells in 50 µl PBS was mixed with one volume of growth factor-reduced
Matrigel (Corning) and injected into the fourth right mammary fat pad. Mice were
housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated cages and
maintained according to the German federal law, authorization number G-240/11.
Mice were monitored weekly for tumour growth by palpation, and after 5 weeks,
tumours were surgically resected from mice upon anesthesia by intraperitoneal
injection of 10 ml/g of a solution of 4.5 mg/kg xylazinhydrochloride and 90 mg/kg
ketamine. Surgically resected mice were closely monitored until clear signs of pain
appeared; hence, they were then euthanized by anesthetic overdose according to
local regulations. The peripheral blood was collected by heart puncture in EDTA
tubes and mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Paque gradient. The lungs
were washed with PBS and digested enzymatically, using type IV collagenase and
dispase, and mechanically using a GentleMACS device (Miltenyi). Circulating or
disseminated cells were FACS-purified from these preparations as live intact GFP-
positive cells that were negative for a mouse lineage antibody cocktail (including
antibodies specific for mCD45, mCD31, mCD11b, Ly-6G and TER-119) using a
FACSAria Fusion (BD) cytometer. Cells were immediately fixed in a 1.6% paraf-
ormaldehyde solution upon sorting.
Patient samples. All study samples were obtained by informed consent. Human
liver samples from patients were obtained from the Department of General Sur-
gery, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich; experiments were
authorised by the ethics committee at the Technical University Munich (ethics vote
number 156/15). Analyses of human CTCs from blood and human lymph nodes
with disseminated tumour cells were carried out in accordance with the ethical
committee in Regensburg, Germany (ethics vote number 07/79). CTC analysis of
breast cancer patients was performed within DETECT studies (EUDRA-CT
number 2010-024238-46)53. PEs and ascites fluids from primary punctates from
metastatic breast cancer patients for isolation of AE and PE cells were obtained
from the University Clinic Mannheim, Department of Gynecology (Frauenklinik)
and experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Heidelberg-Mannheim (case number 2011-380N-MA). PEs from a pancreatic
carcinoma patient for isolation of PE cells were obtained from the Department of
Internal Medicine II at Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich.
Experiments were authorised by the ethics committee at the Technical University
Munich (ethics vote number 5542/12). Analyses of human melanoma tissue were
carried out in accordance with the ethical committee in canton Zurich (StV 16-
2007; amendment 2014).

 Ex vivo human liver perfusion. Fresh surgical human liver biopsy (26 g) was
perfused via portal vein branches through two G20 cannules in closed circuit at
37 °C/5% CO2 with perfusion medium (50 ml Leibovitz’s L15 medium without
phenol red (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% FCS, 1 µg/ml insulin
(Serva), 23 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50
µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 100 µg/ml Gentamycin and 4.4 µg/ml Hydro-
cortisol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min/g. In all, 106 SkMel2 cells stably expressing
ezrin-GFP were injected via the perfusion cannules at 1 ml/min/g and the liver
perfused with medium for 5 further minutes. The liver was then fixed in 4%
formaldehyde for 3 days and embedded in paraffin. Liver integrity was con-
firmed by haematoxylin/eosin staining, and sections were stained for GFP and
vimentin and imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× oil
objective using the LAS software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). To
quantify the orientation of cell polarisation, random round cells in vessels were
imaged, where not more than half of the circumference of the cell was attached
to vimentin-positive, GFP-negative cells. The orientation of cells was assessed
by two independent researchers not involved in this project. Only cells with
consistent orientation in both assessments were included in the quantification
(40 out of the 58).
Human CTCs. CTCs of breast cancer patients were enriched and detected using the
CellSearch® Epithelial Cell Test (Janssen Diagnostics, LLC). In brief, 7.5 ml of
blood was collected in CellSave tubes and CTCs captured by anti-epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM) antibody-bearing ferrofluid. CTCs were defined
by positivity for cytokeratin, negativity for the leukocyte common antigen CD45
and DAPI positivity to ensure integrity of the nucleus. After quantification, stained
cells were flushed from the cartridge and one aliquot was used to isolate single
CTCs and white blood cells by DEPArrayTM (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) for
subsequent whole-genome amplification by Ampli1TM according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol (Menarini Silicon Biosystems)54. The remaining cells were
stored in glycerol55, sedimented on adhesion slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
stained for ezrin/Alexa 488 as described above and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8
confocal microscope.
Single-cell array comparative hybridisation. Ampli1TM whole-genome ampli-
fication libraries were checked for genome integrity index and then reamplified54.
Labelling of CTC DNA and corresponding reference DNA from WGA libraries of
single leukocytes of a healthy female donor and hybridisation on SurePrint G3
Human CGH 4×180K microarray slides (Agilent Technologies, design code
022060) were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Oli-
gonucleotide Array-Based CGH for Genomic DNA Analysis, version 7.1,
December 2011)56. Slides were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner Type
C, and images were processed with Agilent Genomic Feature Extraction Software
(version 10.7) and imported and analysed with the Agilent Genomic Workbench
Software (version 6.5 lite). For defining aberrant regions, we used the ADM-2
algorithm with threshold set to 7.0 and a centralisation of 6.0. To avoid false
positive calls, the minimal number of probes in an aberrant interval was set to 50
probes and minimum log2 ratio to 0.25.
Tumour cells from PEs and AEs. Fresh pleural or peritoneal punctates were
processed immediately. The whole cellular fraction was frozen and stored or
immediately depleted from most CD45+ cells using magnetic human CD45
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec 130-045-801). Cells were stained with EpCAM-FITC
(Miltenyi Biotec) and CD45-APC (Miltenyi Biotec) in suspension or further pur-
ified by sorting of singlet-gated EpCAM+CD45−DAPI− cells on a FACSAriaTM
Fusion device (BD Biosciences) and fixed in 1.6% PFA. Cells were stained as
indicated, attached to microscopy slides and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
microscope.
Human disseminated cancer cells. Adhesion slides with preparations of human
lymph nodes from five melanoma patients and four non-SCLC patients were
prepared57. Lymph nodes were mechanically disintegrated using a Medi-
machine (Beckham Coulter) and cells were subsequently enriched using percoll
60% gradient centrifugation. A total of 2 × 106 cells (at a density of 1 × 106 cells/
ml PBS) were transferred onto adhesion slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After
1 h sedimentation, PBS was removed. Slides were air-dried overnight at room
temperature and fixed for 10 min with 4% formaldehyde prior to permeabili-
sation and staining as described above. Samples were stained for gp100 or
EpCAM, ezrin and DAPI and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope.
In two out of the three melanoma samples and in two out of the two lung cancer
samples that showed sufficiently high ezrin expression, polarisation of ezrin was
observed. Control (non-cancer) nodes were obtained from patients with chronic
venous insufficiency from whom a lymph node was removed during cross-
ectomy. For each experiment, three negative controls were stained and
analysed.
Human melanoma specimens. TMAs21 comprised 70 primary melanomas, 216
melanoma metastases and melanoma patient’s cell lines consisting of 41 cell lines
derived from primary and metastatic melanomas. Primary tumours and metastases
were mostly not related. TMA specification and construction were previously
performed21. In all, 2 µm sections from these TMAs were immunohistochemically
stained for melan-A and MCAM or fluorescently for melan-A and ezrin. Ezrin
polarisation was imaged on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× oil
objective.
Evaluation of MCAM expression. To determine the expression frequencies of
MCAM, a semi-quantitative scoring system was applied following the German
immunohistochemical scoring (GIS) system in which the final immuno-reactive
score equaled the product of the percentage of positive cells times the average
staining intensity. Percentage of positive cells was graded as follows: 0 =
negative, 1 = up to 10% positive cells, 2 = 11–50%, 3 = 51–90%, 4 = > 90%.
Staining intensity of 0 = negative, 1 = weakly positive and 2 = moderately or
strongly positive58. GIS score ≥4 was defined as high and <4 as low. All
stainings were evaluated by an experienced pathologist (D. M.-P.). MCAM
expression was compared between different patient groups using Pearson’s Chi-
squared Test. p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics of quantitative data are mean ±
standard deviation or median and other quantiles, depending on the distribu-
tion of data. Likewise, qualitative data are presented by absolute and relative
frequencies. Hypothesis testing was performed in an exploratory manner on
two-sided 5% significance levels. Group differences of normally distributed data
were assessed by t-tests. One-sample t-tests and paired-samples t-tests were
used for dependent data. Relations of the latter were assessed by the Pearson
correlation coefficient. Mann–Whitney U-tests were used to infer on group
differences of non-normally distributed data. Differences in the distribution of
qualitative data were investigated by Pearson’s Chi-squared Test. Error bars are
mean ± standard deviation. SPSS 22 software (SPSS Inc.) and GraphPad Prism
were used for statistical analysis.
Analysis of pole morphology. Sixteen-bit images of SkMel2 cells expressing
ezrin-GFP were converted to 32-bit without interpolation and the background
was subtracted. Yen thresholding was used to segment cellular regions of low
intensity and ezrin clusters of high intensity. Object-based regions were defined
and utilised to measure the area and intensity of the identified cells and ezrin
clusters.
'Aggregation score' for ezrin was defined as:
Aggregation¼ Icluster
Icell
´ Acell
Acluster
�
�
where I is the intensity and A is the area of large ezrin clusters per cell. This
agregation score is maximised when ezrin is strongly confined to a single cluster in
a cell (spot-like) and minimised when it is dispersed over the cell (cap-like). A
histogram of the aggregation scores was generated and fitted to a double modified-
Gaussian peak model (Supplementary Table 5) to disentangle the two populations
of cells. Image processing and calculation of aggregation score were performed
using a single automated Python script provided as ‘EzrinClassifier.py’.
Dependencies: tifffile, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Pillow, and scikits-image.
In silico modelling. Model set-up: An ODE-based compartmental model was
constructed using the Simbiology toolbox in MATLAB R2016a. Three independent
compartments corresponding to blood circulation, attachment/adherence substrate
for cells and tissue parenchyma were defined in the model (Fig. 10a). Each com-
partment contains populations of polarised and depolarised cells. Transfer of cells
between compartments was defined as occurring according to first-order reaction
kinetics as follows:
dðAttachedpolÞ
dt
¼ kattachment
pol
� Circulatingpol
ð1Þ
dðAttacheddepolÞ

The first-order reaction rates for each transfer were determined by linked-fitting the
appropriate steps in the model to three independent sets of experiments,

in vitro experiments of attached polarised or depolarised cells to measure the
adherence rate (Fig. 9d), fitted to Eqs. 3 and 4
ii.
in vitro experiments of mixed populations of polarised and depolarised cells
in suspension to measure their combined ‘attachment and adherence’ rates
(Fig. 9e) and fitted to Eqs. 1–4
iii.
in vivo experiments of a mixed population of polarised and depolarised cells
injected into blood circulation to measure their combined ‘attachment,
adherence and tissue residence’ (Fig. 9k and Supplementary Fig. 18a), fitted
to Eqs. 1–5
These experiments allowed us to fit all the required rate parameters and obtain
predictions for the attachment and tissue residence rates of polarised and
depolarised cells individually.
For each compartment, the polarised and depolarised cells are represented as
distinct species. The only exception is for the tissue compartment since the
experimental data do not provide information regarding the previous polarisation
status of cells that are already tissue resident.
Fitting procedures: The data from all three independent experiments
described above was pooled into a single matrix that contained the observed
circulating, adhered, attached and tissue-resident cell populations for polarised
and depolarised cells. The model fitting procedure did not contain any
information regarding the biological/technical nature of the experiment,
effectively making the result a linked fit of all three experiments. Linked fitting
constrains the parameter space to only those ranges which fit data from all three
experiments simultaneously. Fitting was performed using the ‘constrained mixed
effects non-linear least squares optimization’ (nlmm-lsqnonlin) algorithm59,
which is particularly suited for data from mixed populations, coming from
disparate experiments. Termination tolerances were set as ResidualSumofSquares
= 1.0E-8 or MaxIterations = 400. The linked-fit-derived rates were then tested
against the three experiments individually to see if they predicted the
observations to within 95% confidence bounds.
Simulations: The experimental data providing the fitted first-order rate
parameters typically consist of mixed but biased populations of polarised and
depolarised cells. Once obtained, the rate parameters can be used to simulate the
behaviour of ‘pure’ populations of polarised and depolarised cells in terms of tissue
residence. Simulations were then performed using the derived rate parameters for
an interval of 15,000 s (250 min), setting the populations of polarised or
depolarised cells to 100% and then computing the tissue residence.
The model is provided as an SBML file, datasets are provided as annotated CSV
files and the results of simulations as an OPJ file (the viewer can be obtained under
//www.originlab.com/viewer/). All data are also provided as one single SBPROJ file
that is readable in MATLAB with Simbiology toolbox.
Results and predictions: The compartmental model fitted the data to within
95% confidence limits for all parameters (Supplementary Fig. 19a). The obtained
transfer rates are provided in Supplementary Figure 19b. In agreement with
experimental indications (Fig. 5), the model predicts a three-fold higher attachment
rate of polarised cells compared to depolarised cells. Similarly, in agreement with
experiments (Fig. 9d), the adherence rate of polarised cells is approximately 1.3-
fold the adherence rate of depolarised cells. Both cell populations are predicted to
have much slower tissue invasion rates. The tissue invasion rate of polarised cells is
only slightly enhanced compared to depolarised cells. These rates were used to
simulate the entire chain of events from circulation to tissue residence for pure
unmixed populations of polarised and depolarised cells (Fig. 10b–e). Such unmixed
populations cannot be obtained experimentally, justifying the development of the
aforementioned compartmental model. The changes in the circulating, attached,
adhered and tissue-resident populations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 19c.
Direct comparisons for all rates between polarised and depolarised cells are shown
in Fig. 10b–e.
