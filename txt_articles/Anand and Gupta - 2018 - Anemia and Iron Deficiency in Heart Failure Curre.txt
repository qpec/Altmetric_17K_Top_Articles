ABSTRACT: Anemia and iron deficiency are important and common 
comorbidities that often coexist in patients with heart failure. Both 
conditions, together or independently, are associated with poor clinical 
status and worse outcomes. Whether anemia and iron deficiency are 
just markers of heart failure severity or whether they mediate heart 
failure progression and outcomes and therefore should be treated is not 
entirely clear. Treatment of anemia in patients with heart failure with 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has been evaluated intensively during 
the past several years. Unfortunately, these agents did not improve 
outcomes but were associated with a higher risk of adverse events. Iron 
deficiency in patients with heart failure can be absolute, when total 
body iron is decreased, or functional, when total body iron is normal 
or increased but is inadequate to meet the needs of target tissues 
because of sequestration in the storage pool. Whereas iron replacement 
is appropriate in patients with anemia resulting from absolute iron 
deficiency, it has been unclear whether and how absolute or functional 
iron deficiency should be treated in nonanemic patients with heart failure. 
Recently, small studies found that administration of intravenous iron in 
patients with heart failure and absolute or functional iron deficiency with 
or without anemia improves symptoms and exercise capacity, but long-
term outcomes and safety data are not yet available. In this review, we 
discuss the causes and pathogenesis of and treatment options for anemia 
and iron deficiency in patients with heart failure.

emarkable advances in our understanding of the 
pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) have led to ra-
tional therapies with considerable improvement 
in patient outcomes.1 Despite this, however, the prog-
nosis of HF remains poor.2 Anemia and iron deficiency 
(ID) are 2 important comorbidities common in patients 
with HF and are associated with poor clinical status and 
worse outcomes. If anemia and ID are indeed mediators 
of poor outcomes in patients with HF, correcting these 
comorbidities would be attractive and novel therapeu-
tic targets to improve outcomes. Although several small 
studies showed that use of erythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents (ESAs) to increase hemoglobin in patients with 
HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated 
with beneficial effects on clinical outcomes,3,4 the neu-
tral results of the large pivotal RED-HF trial (Reduction of 
Events With Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure)5 suggest 
that anemia by itself is probably not a mediator of poor 
outcomes but rather a marker of HF severity. Although 
data from recent trials suggest that treating ID itself may 
be of benefit, significant knowledge gaps exist in our un-
derstanding of when, how, and for how long anemia or 
ID should be treated in HF and the mechanisms underly-
ing the observed effects of treatment. In this review, we 
describe the magnitude of the problem of anemia and 
ID in patients with HF, discuss their impact on long-term 
outcomes, and examine whether and how they should 
be managed in light of recent clinical trial data.
PREVALENCE OF ANEMIA IN HF
The prevalence of anemia in patients with HF (defined 
as hemoglobin <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in wom-
en)6 is ≈30% in stable and ≈50% in hospitalized pa-
tients, regardless of whether patients have HFrEF or HF 
with preserved ejection fraction, compared with <10% 
in the general population (although prevalence in-
creases with age, exceeding 20% in subjects ≥85 years 
old).3,7–10 Compared with nonanemic patients with HF, 
anemic patients are older and more likely to be female 
and to have diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), se-
vere HF with worse functional status, lower exercise ca-
pacity, worse health-related quality of life (QoL), greater 
edema, lower blood pressure, greater requirement of 
diuretics, and higher neurohormonal and proinflamma-
tory cytokine activation.3,9,11–13 However, anemic sub-
jects have a better left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 
(LVEF): Hemoglobin is inversely related to LVEF,8,11,14 and 
an increase in hemoglobin over time is associated with 
a decrease, not an increase, in LVEF.11,15
CAUSES OF ANEMIA IN HF
In the general elderly population, anemia is caused by 
nutritional deficiencies (primarily iron), chronic inflam-
mation/CKD, or unexplained anemia of the elderly (a 
hypoproliferative anemia with blunted erythropoietin 
response) in approximately one third each, with prima-
ry hematologic diseases or other conditions account-
ing for smaller proportions.10 Guidance is available on 
evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly.10 
Identification of absolute ID mandates a search for its 
cause, particularly gastrointestinal blood loss from be-
nign or malignant conditions.16
The pathogenesis of anemia in HF (reviewed pre-
viously3) is multifactorial (Figure 1). ID is common in 
HF and is discussed separately. However, deficiencies 
of hematinic vitamins (B12 or folate) are infrequent. 
Erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red 
blood cells (RBCs), is produced primarily within the re-
nal cortex and outer medulla by specialized peritubular 
fibroblasts and is often abnormal in HF. Low Po2 is the 
primary stimulus for erythropoietin production. Renal 
dysfunction is common in HF, but structural renal dis-
ease, which could reduce erythropoietin production, 
is infrequent. However, an imbalance between oxygen 
supply and demand related to increased proximal tubu-
lar sodium reabsorption caused by low renal blood flow 
and glomerular filtration rate17,18 reduces renal Po2, ac-
tivates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and induces eryth-
ropoietin gene transcription. Therefore, erythropoietin 
levels are increased in proportion to HF severity but are 
lower than expected for the degree of anemia, suggest-
ing blunted erythropoietin production.12,19 However, 
the relationship between renal blood flow and eryth-
ropoietin secretion during HF is complex and not fully 
understood.20
Inflammation is an important component of HF. Tu-
mor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and several other 
proinflammatory cytokines,12,21 and C-reactive protein 
are increased in HF11 and inversely related to hemoglo-
bin level.13 Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α 
also inhibit renal erythropoietin production by activat-
ing transcription factors GATA binding protein 2 (which 
binds nucleotide consensus sequence GATA in target 
gene promoters) and nuclear factor κ light-chain en-
hancer of activated B cells and may explain the blunted 
erythropoietin response. These cytokines also inhibit 
bone marrow erythroid progenitor cell proliferation. 
However, in some patients with HF, erythropoietin levels 
are excessively elevated, and high erythropoietin levels 
are associated with worse outcomes.19
The renin-angiotensin system plays an important 
role in erythropoietin pathophysiology through multiple 
pathways. First, angiotensin II decreases Po2 by reduc-
ing renal blood flow and increasing oxygen demand 
and thereby stimulates erythropoietin production. An-
giotensin II also directly stimulates bone marrow ery-
throid progenitor cell production. Therefore, angio-
tensin-converting inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 
blockers cause a modest reduction in hemoglobin11 by

decreasing production of erythropoietin22 and erythroid 
progenitors and by preventing breakdown of the hema-
topoiesis inhibitor N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline.23 
Finally, anemia might be related to hemodilution,20 al-
though clinically euvolemic patients have normal plas-
ma volume,24 and measurement of hemoglobin reflects 
“true anemia” as assessed by RBC volume in the vast 
majority of anemic patients with HF.14
Opasich and colleagues12 identified a specific cause 
of anemia in only 43% of 148 patients with stable HF. 
ID was seen in only 5% of patients. In the remaining 
57% of patients, proinflammatory cytokine activation, 
inadequate erythropoietin production, or defective iron 
utilization was found despite adequate iron stores, in-
dicative of anemia of chronic disease (functional ID). 
Therefore, an activated proinflammatory state and ane-
mia of chronic disease25 could be the most frequent 
underlying cause of anemia in HF. Recent reports show 
that mutation (eg, clonal hematopoiesis of indetermi-
nate potential) or deficiency of genes that regulate he-
matopoiesis results in an increase in inflammatory cyto-
kines, including interleukin-1β and -6, and is associated 
with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease 
in humans and with worsening of cardiac remodeling 
in mice.26,27 Future studies may further elucidate such 
mechanistic interactions between the hematopoietic 
and cardiovascular systems.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL 
CONSEQUENCES OF ANEMIA
In patients with very severe anemia (hemoglobin, 4–6 
g/dL)28,29 and normal LV function, usually seen with 
helminthic infections in developing countries, reduced 
oxygen-carrying capacity evokes nonhemodynamic and 
hemodynamic compensatory mechanisms (reviewed 
previously3). There is an increase in RBC 2,3-diphospho-
glycerate that displaces the hemoglobin-oxygen dis-
sociation curve to the right, increasing tissue oxygen 
Figure 1. Potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of anemia in heart failure (HF).  
Multiple, interrelated mechanisms contribute in various degrees to the development of anemia in HF. Of these, functional or absolute iron deficiency, erythropoi-
etin synthesis and response, and the effects of various medications may represent the most important factors. ACE-I indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor; AcSDKP

interferon-γ; IL, interleukin; and TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.

delivery. A low number of circulating RBCs reduces sys-
temic vascular resistance28 by decreasing whole-blood 
viscosity, and low hemoglobin enhances nitric oxide–
mediated vasodilation.29,30 The resulting decrease in 
arterial blood pressure causes baroreceptor-mediated 
neurohormonal activation,28 identical to that seen in 
low-output HF.17,18 Increased sympathetic and renin-
angiotensin activity decreases renal blood flow and 
glomerular filtration rate, resulting in renal retention of 
salt and water with the expansion of extracellular and 
plasma volumes. Therefore, severe anemia itself may 
cause the syndrome of high-output HF in subjects with 
normal LV function, and correction of severe anemia 
in these patients causes a rapid and complete regres-
sion of high-output HF.28 Although these hemodynamic 
and neurohormonal responses are observed in severe 
anemia, it is unclear whether and to what extend these 
mechanisms are also operative in patients with HFrEF 
with less severe anemia. Detailed hemodynamic and 
echocardiographic studies have not been reported in 
patients with HFrEF before and after treating anemia. 
However, when hemoglobin was increased from 8.5 to 
10 to 14 g/dL with erythropoietin in patients with CKD 
and moderate anemia, cardiac output (7.0 to 6.6 to 
5.2 L/min) and LV fractional shortening (36% to 33% 
to 29%) decreased progressively, proportional to the 
increase in hemoglobin.15 Therefore, all this evidence 
implies that increasing hemoglobin in patients with 
HFrEF would increase systemic vascular resistance, raise 
the LV afterload, and cause the LVEF to decrease. This 
sequence of events could explain the observed inverse 
relationship of hemoglobin with LVEF8,9,12 and the find-
ings that an increase in hemoglobin over time is associ-
ated with a decrease in LVEF.9,13 These findings might 
also explain why correction of anemia in patients with 
HFrEF has not improved outcomes.
ASSOCIATION OF ANEMIA WITH 
OUTCOMES
Anemia is independently associated with increased 
mortality and hospitalizations in patients with both 
HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction.3,7,8,31 The 
association of hemoglobin level with mortality is not 
linear, and most of the increased risk occurs at low he-
moglobin.3,32,33 Some studies have reported a J-shaped 
relationship between hemoglobin and mortality in the 
normal population34 and patients with coronary artery 
disease,35 acute coronary syndromes,36 and HF.31,33 The 
lowest mortality risk was observed in the hemoglobin 
range of 13 to 16 g/dL, and the risk increased with he-
moglobin concentrations below or above this range. 
Thus, the concern is that excessive increases in hemo-
globin may be associated with increased mortality. In a 
meta-analysis of 33 studies involving >150 
000 patients 
with HF, anemia doubled the relative risk of death.37 A 
similar relationship was observed in patients with new-
onset anemia and in patients with a decrease in hemo-
globin over time.11 Moreover, a spontaneous increase 
in hemoglobin and the resolution of anemia over time 
were associated with a better prognosis, similar to that 
of patients without anemia.38 Anemia and CKD often 
coexist in patients with HF. Whereas anemia doubles 
the risk of death in patients with HF, the adjusted risk 
of death is further increased 1.5-fold in the presence of 
CKD.39 These findings, however, do not clarify whether 
anemia is a mediator or just a marker of HF severity.
MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH 
POOR OUTCOMES IN HF WITH 
ANEMIA
Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to poor 
outcomes in these patients. Reduced oxygen delivery 
to metabolizing tissues in anemic subjects triggers a 
host of hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and renal al-
terations,28 leading to increased myocardial workload, 
which could cause adverse LV remodeling and LV hy-
pertrophy.40,41 Moreover, patients with HF and anemia 
have several comorbidities, including CKD, cardiac ca-
chexia-associated poor nutritional status, and low albu-
min,8,11,39 all of which could worsen outcomes. Finally, 
the neurohormonal and proinflammatory cytokine acti-
vation seen in patients with HF may have diverse delete-
rious consequences.13,21,28
TREATMENT OPTIONS
Should Anemia in Patients With HF Be 
Treated?
Most of the aforementioned observational studies sug-
gest that anemia is common in patients with HF and 
is associated with poor clinical status and worse prog-
nosis. It is therefore reasonable to consider whether 
treatment of anemia might improve outcomes. Unfor-
tunately, few options are available to increase hemo-
globin.
Whereas packed RBC transfusion can be used as a 
short-term therapy, transfusions are associated with 
many risks and provide only temporary benefit. Kao 
and colleagues42 examined the large public discharge 
database on 596 456 patients admitted for HF. Anemia 
was present in 27% of patients with HF. Whereas un-
treated anemia was associated with ≈10% increased 
adjusted risk of mortality, the adjusted risk of mortal-
ity was ≈70% higher in anemic patients with HF who 
received transfusions. Although these data might raise 
serious concerns about the potentially harmful effects 
of transfusing patients with HF, there are important

limitations in the analysis of this database. For example, 
the severity of anemia and clinical reasons for which a 
transfusion was required were not available and ad-
justed for. These and other residual measured and un-
measured confounders could have affected the results 
of the multivariable analysis. Prospective randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) are required to clarify the role 
of packed RBC transfusions in patients with anemia 
and HF. Nevertheless, the TRICS III trial (Transfusion Re-
quirements in Cardiac Surgery) in moderate- to high-
risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery recently found 
that the composite primary outcome of death result-
ing from any cause, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, 
and new-onset renal failure with dialysis occurred in 
11.4% of those randomized to receive intraoperative 
or postoperative transfusions for hemoglobin <7.5 g/
dL compared with 12.5% in the more liberal strategy 
of transfusions for hemoglobin <9.5 g/dL, indicating 
that, in such patients, a restrictive transfusion strat-
egy is noninferior to a liberal strategy.43 These find-
ings suggest that packed RBC transfusion in patients 
with HF and anemia is not necessarily beneficial and 
may even be associated with worse outcomes. Rou-
tine blood transfusion in asymptomatic patients, par-
ticularly those with nonacute anemia, therefore cannot 
be recommended.6 Because the hemoglobin threshold 
for packed RBC transfusions varies between clinical 
practice guidelines (summarized by Goodnough and 
Schrier10), careful consideration of individual factors, 
including age, comorbidities, and need for surgical in-
tervention, is advisable when determining clinical indi-
cations for transfusion in patients with HF.
In the routine treatment of anemia, identification 
and correction of hematinic deficiencies (iron, B12, or fo-
late) or hypothyroidism, if present, should clearly be the 
first step. However, because many patients are thought 
to have anemia of chronic disease, stimulating erythro-
poiesis with ESAs has been investigated.
TREATMENT WITH ESAS
Between 2000 and 2010, 13 small uncontrolled or ran-
domized placebo-controlled studies tested the effects 
of increasing hemoglobin with ESAs (summarized in 
 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Most stud-
ies found symptomatic improvement with use of ESAs. 
In 2011, Kotecha and colleagues4 published a meta-
analysis based on 11 of these RCTs of 794 patients com-
paring any ESA with placebo with 2 to 12 months of 
follow-up. Nine studies were placebo controlled and 5 
were double-blind. Five studies used epoetin and 6 used 
darbepoetin. ESAs improved exercise duration by 96.8 
seconds (P=0.04) and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) 
by 69.3 m (P=0.009) compared with controls (Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Significant changes 
were also observed in peak oxygen consumption (Vo2; 
2.29 mL·kg−1·min−1; P=0.007), New York Heart As-
sociation (NYHA) class (−0.73; P<0.001), LVEF (5.8%; 
P<0.001), BNP (brain natriuretic peptide; −227 pg/mL; 
P<0.001), and QoL indicators with a mean increase in 
hemoglobin of 2 g/dL. HF-related hospitalizations were 
reduced by 44% (P=0.005) with ESA therapy, but the 
reduction in all-cause mortality (42%) was of border-
line significance (P=0.047; Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Adverse effects of ESAs were rare, 
with no significant increase in the development of hy-
pertension (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.65–2.87; P=0.41), stroke (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% 
CI, 0.52–5.62; P=0.38), MI (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.28–1.61; P=0.37), and thromboembolic events (odds 
ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.17–2.11; P=0.43). In contrast, 
use of darbepoetin in patients with moderate to severe 
HFrEF was not associated with any increase in exercise 
capacity in STAMINA-HeFT (Study of Anemia in Heart 
Failure Trial), the largest (n=319) of these small stud-
ies.44
The encouraging results of these small studies were 
not supported by the large pivotal RED-HF trial, pub-
lished in 2013.5 RED-HF was a double-blind placebo-
controlled trial that randomized 2278 patients with 
HFrEF, NYHA class II to IV HF, LVEF ≤40%, and mild to 
moderate anemia (hemoglobin, 9.0–12.0 g/dL) receiv-
ing guideline-recommended HF therapy. Patients with 
ID defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) of <15%, 
unless corrected, were ineligible. Patients with a history 
of bleeding or other correctable causes of anemia, se-
rum creatinine >3 mg/dL, or blood pressure >160/100 
mm 
Hg were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 
to receive either darbepoetin alfa to achieve a hemo-
globin target of 13 g/dL or placebo. Patients in the 
darbepoetin group received a starting dose of 0.75 μg/
kg every 2 weeks until a hemoglobin of 13.0 g/dL was 
reached on 2 consecutive visits. Thereafter, patients re-
ceived monthly darbepoetin to maintain a hemoglobin 
of 13.0 g/dL but not exceeding 14.5 g/dL. Iron indexes 
were assessed 3 monthly during the trial. If TSAT fell 
below 20%, oral and, if necessary, intravenous iron was 
administered. Patients had a median age of 72.0 years; 
41% were women; 65% had NYHA class III or IV HF; 
the median LVEF was 31%; and the median estimated 
glomerular filtration rate was 45.7 mL/1.73 m2 body 
surface area. Baseline median hemoglobin was 11.2 
g/dL in both groups. One month after randomization 
and throughout the study thereafter, median attained 
hemoglobin remained ≈1.5 g/dL higher in the darbe-
poetin group (13.0 g/dL; interquartile range, 12.4–13.4 
g/dL) compared with the placebo group (11.5 g/dL; 
interquartile range, 10.7–12.2 g/dL; P<0.001). After a 
median follow-up of 28 months, darbepoetin had no 
effect on the primary composite outcome of death re-
sulting from any cause or hospitalization for worsening 
HF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90–1.13; P=0.87)

or on its individual components. The lack of any effect 
of darbepoetin was consistent across all prespecified 
subgroups examined; no subgroup experienced any 
benefit from darbepoetin. There was also no significant 
difference in any secondary outcome, including fatal 
or nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal strokes, hypertension, 
and HF. More patients had fatal or nonfatal strokes in 
the darbepoetin than in the placebo group, although 
the difference was not significant. This finding be-
comes important because thromboembolic adverse 
events were significantly higher in the darbepoetin 
(13.5%) compared with the placebo (10.0%; P=0.01) 
group. Cancer-related adverse events were similar in 
the 2 groups. Although the rate of clinical events was 
not reduced by darbepoetin, treatment of anemia im-
proved the Overall Summary and Symptom Frequency 
scores on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Question-
naire. However, the average between-group difference 
and the difference in the proportion of patients with a 
clinically meaningful improvement in these scores were 
of questionable importance. It is important to empha-
size that all patients were iron repleted at baseline. The 
darbepoetin group received more iron during the study 
because of greater iron requirement for erythropoiesis. 
Neither group became ID during the study.
In summary, this large pivotal trial failed to confirm 
the results of previous smaller studies that treating mild 
to moderate anemia in patients with HFrEF with ESAs 
improved clinical outcomes. Although an increase in he-
moglobin was associated with a modest improvement in 
QoL, this was of questionable importance, particularly 
because the use of darbepoetin was associated with a 
significant increase in thromboembolic events. Similar 
findings in CKD and cancer populations for cardiovascu-
lar safety have raised concerns about the use of ESAs to 
increase hemoglobin to relatively higher levels.45 There-
fore, a brief examination of the CKD data may be helpful.
Are There Real Risks of Increasing 
Hemoglobin With ESA Therapy?
In the 1990s, several trials were conducted to assess 
whether complete normalization of hemoglobin with 
ESAs would produce additional benefits in patients with 
CKD. NHCT (Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial) random-
ized 1223 patients with CKD on hemodialysis to epoe-
tin-alfa to achieve a hematocrit of 45% versus 30%.46 
The study was terminated early because of a trend to 
increased risk of the composite of death or nonfatal 
MI and a higher incidence of vascular access thrombo-
sis in the normal hematocrit group (39% versus 29%; 
P=0.001). Two trials published more recently (CREATE 
[Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treat-
ment With Epoetin Beta]47 and CHOIR [Correction of 
Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency]48) 
further raised serious concerns about the cardiovascu-
lar safety of higher hemoglobin with the use of ESAs in 
patients with CKD. In CREATE, 603 patients (hemoglo-
bin, 11.6±0.6 g/dL) were randomized to epoetin-beta 
to normalize hemoglobin (13.0–15.0 g/dL) or to epoetin 
only if hemoglobin declined to <10.5 g/dL. There was 
a trend to an increase in the relative risk of mortality 
(34%; P=0.14) with higher hemoglobin. The CHOIR trial 
randomized 1432 patients (hemoglobin, 10.1±0.9 g/dL) 
to epoetin to achieve a hemoglobin of 13.5 or 11.3 g/
dL. The trial was stopped early for presumed futility but 
showed a 34% (P=0.03) increase in the composite of 
death, MI, hospitalization for HF, and stroke in the high 
hemoglobin group. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of 9 
randomized trials, including the 3 trials mentioned earli-
er, compared the low and high hemoglobin target strat-
egies and found a relative increase in all-cause mortality 
of 17% (P=0.03), arteriovenous access thrombosis of 
34% (P=0.0001), and poorly controlled blood pressure 
of 27% (P=0.004) in the high hemoglobin groups.45
With that background, TREAT (Trial to Reduce Car-
diovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy),49 the largest 
RCT, was designed to compare darbepoetin with pla-
cebo (achieved hemoglobin, 12.5 versus 10.6 g/dL) in 
4038 patients with diabetes mellitus and CKD. Unlike 
previous trials that compared using ESA to achieve a 
high or a low hemoglobin, TREAT tested the more ap-
propriate strategy of comparing an ESA with placebo. 
Darbepoetin had a neutral effect on the 2 primary com-
posite outcomes (death or a cardiovascular event; death 
or a renal event) but was associated with a doubling of 
the risk of stroke. In a post hoc analysis of the TREAT 
trial of 1347 patients (33.4%) with HF at baseline, dar-
bepoetin also had a neutral effect on all-cause mortality 
(HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93–1.29) or nonfatal HF events 
(HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87–1.20), similar to the entire co-
hort.50 Therefore, increasing hemoglobin to relatively 
higher levels in patients with CKD is associated with 
either neutral or deleterious effects on cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality with increases in thrombotic 
and stroke risk. Consequently, the current (2017) US 
Food and Drug Administration–approved label for ESAs 
carries Black Box statements for patients with CKD: 
(a) In controlled trials, patients experienced 
greater risks for death, serious adverse cardio-
vascular reactions, and stroke when admin-
istered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of 
greater than 11 g/dL, (b) No trial has identified 
a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing 
strategy that does not increase these risks, and 
(c) Use the lowest ESA dose sufficient to reduce 
the need for RBC transfusions.50a 
Consistent with the aforementioned guidance, Kid-
ney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines rec-

Drug Administration and the Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcomes guidelines6 recommend initiating ESA 
therapy at a hemoglobin cutoff of <10 g/dL in patients 
with CKD on dialysis and individualizing ESA initiation 
at this level in patients with CKD not on dialysis, al-
though the rationale for initiating ESAs at hemoglobin 
<10 g/dL rather than an even lower hemoglobin is not 
entirely clear if the only indication is to avoid transfu-
sions. However, in a subgroup analysis of 816 TREAT-
like patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus in RED-HF 
with baseline hemoglobin 11.0±0.8 g/dL, the use of 
darbepoetin to raise hemoglobin had an overall neutral 
effect on mortality (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73–1.09) but 
was associated with a 2-fold increase in stroke risk (HR, 
2.07; 95% CI, 0.98–4.38), supporting the US Food and 
Drug Administration and Kidney Disease: Improving 
Global Outcomes guidelines on interrupting/holding 
ESAs at an upper level of hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL.
The overall consequences of correcting anemia in HF 
with ESAs are a tradeoff between the favorable effects 
of improving oxygen delivery and the putative cardio-
protective effects of ESAs52 and the unfavorable effects 
of higher hemoglobin on increasing viscosity, vascular 
resistance, and blood pressure and of ESAs on hyper-
coagulability.11,28,29 Moreover, the starting, achieved, 
change-in, and rates of rise in hemoglobin and the dose 
of ESA may influence the net effect of treatment.53
Taken together, data from small, short-term trials 
and meta-analyses of ESA in HF and the pivotal RED-HF 
trial suggest that correcting anemia with ESAs does not 
improve outcomes but does increase the risk of throm-
boembolic events. The findings do not support the use 
of these agents to increase hemoglobin in patients with 
HFrEF and mild to moderate anemia to higher levels. 
Therefore, although HF guidelines recommend a diag-
nostic workup to seek and treat correctable causes of 
anemia, they provide a Class III (no benefit), Level of 
Evidence BR recommendation: “In patients with HF and 
anemia, ESAs should not be used to improve morbidity 
and mortality.”1
IRON DEFICIENCY AND HF
Normal Iron Metabolism and 
Homeostasis
Iron is the most important essential trace element in the 
body. Apart from its role in maintaining the oxygen-car-
rying capacity of the blood through erythropoiesis, iron 
is independently crucial for oxygen transport, delivery, 
and utilization. It is a key component of hemoglobin, 
myoglobin, and diverse enzymes involved in cellular 
respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, citric acid cycle, 
nitric oxide generation, oxygen radical production, 
and several critical body functions.54 Metabolic active 
cells, including myocytes and skeletal muscle cells, are 
dependent on iron for their function and structural in-
tegrity.55,56 Iron distribution and metabolism in healthy 
individuals are illustrated in Figure 2.
Iron Deficiency in HF
ID is a very common comorbidity in HF regardless of 
sex, race, anemia, and LVEF.57,58 Overall, nearly 50% of 
patients with HF with or without anemia have low lev-
els of available iron.59,60 ID can be absolute, when total 
body iron is decreased, or functional, when total body 
iron is normal or increased but inadequate to meet the 
needs of target tissues because of sequestration in the 
storage pool (iron maldistribution; Figure 3).
Diagnosis of ID
In the absence of inflammation or chronic disease, se-
rum ferritin correlates strongly with body iron stores: 1 
μg/L serum ferritin corresponds to ≈10 mg tissue iron. 
Serum ferritin of 100 μg/L thus reflects ≈1 g tissue iron 
stores. In healthy individuals, ferritin below ≈30 μg/L 
and TSAT below ≈16% define ID.64 In inflammatory 
states (including HF), however, ferritin is nonspecifically 
elevated as an acute-phase reactant, making identifica-
tion of absolute or functional ID complex and uncer-
tain.16,65 Consequently, in patients with HF, ferritin <100 
μg/L or <300 μg/L if TSAT is <20% has been used to 
include patients with both absolute and functional ID in 
iron replacement trials.
Table 1 summarizes tests available to diagnose 
ID.65,71,72 The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) level is 
increased in ID and is not affected by inflammation. 
Among the blood parameters, sTfR or TSAT may have 
the strongest correlation with bone marrow iron deple-
tion.69,70 Although not commonly available in clinical 
practice, sTfR, sTfR:log(ferritin) ratio, or hepcidin levels 
may provide better discrimination of absolute and func-
tional ID.73 Improving the diagnostic accuracy of tests to 
identify ID remains an area of active investigation.
Bone Marrow Iron Content for the 
Diagnosis of ID
Bone marrow iron depletion is very specific for ID, is 
not influenced by inflammation, and remains the gold 
standard for the definitive diagnosis of ID.16 However, 
its clinical applicability is limited because its assessment 
is invasive, expensive, somewhat subjective (relying on 
staining and observer interpretation), and difficult to 
perform serially. Few studies have correlated bone mar-
row iron with blood parameters of ID in HF. One small 
study in 37 hospitalized patients with decompensated 
HF and anemia found depleted bone marrow iron in 
73% of patients despite normal serum iron, ferritin, 
and erythropoietin.74 Unpredictable and inconsistent

variability in measured levels of ferritin and TSAT75 may 
partly explain discrepancies between blood parameters 
and bone marrow iron. Recently, Grote Beverborg and 
colleagues69 examined bone marrow iron in a relatively 
small cohort of 42 patients with HFrEF undergoing cor-
onary artery bypass surgery and found bone marrow 
ID in 17 patients (40%). The commonly used definition 
of ID (ferritin <100 µg/L or 100–300 µg/L with TSAT 
<20%) had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 
72% for true ID. As single parameters, TSAT ≤19.8% 
and serum iron ≤13 µmol/L (≤72.6 µg/dL) were highly 
correlated with absolute or functional bone marrow ID 
(sensitivity, 94% for both; specificity, 84% and 88%, re-
spectively; P<0.05). TSAT was calculated with the use of 
transferrin rather than total iron-binding capacity in the 
denominator (thus, TSAT=iron/transferrin). It is notable 
that patients with low ferritin (<100 ng/mL) but nor-
mal TSAT (>20%) did not have bone marrow ID. In 387 
patients with HF, TSAT or serum iron (but not ferritin) 
below these cutoffs was independently associated with 
higher all-cause mortality (P=0.015 and P=0.022, re-
spectively), underscoring their prognostic significance. 
An individual patient data meta-analysis of 4 clinical tri-
als (n=839) of the effects of intravenous ferric carboxy-
maltose (FCM) in patients with HFrEF found that TSAT 
≤19.8% (but not serum iron [interaction P=0.077] or 
Figure 2. Normal iron metabolism and homeostasis.  
The total body iron in healthy men is 35 to 45 mg/kg; it is often lower in menstruating women. Approximately 1.5 to 2 g of this is in the erythroid pool and ≈400 
mg is in myoglobin, various enzymes, and other tissues (nonerythroid pool). About 1.6 g is in the storage pool: 1.0 g in the liver and 0.6 g as ferritin or hemosider-
in in the RES. Iron balance is maintained by intestinal absorption of 1 to 2 mg/d (5%–10% of dietary intake of 15–25 mg), equivalent to losses from the gut, skin, 
urine, and menstrual bleeding. Destruction of senescent red cells by the RES recycles ≈25 mg iron daily, sufficient for the production of new red cells. FP expressed 
on the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes, hepatocytes, and RES cells regulates intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron from the liver or RES. 
Hepcidin produced by the liver binds to ferroportin and induces its internalization and degradation, serving as the “master regulator” of ferroportin expression and 
iron absorption and distribution. Normally, hepcidin levels are regulated by plasma iron, iron stores, and erythropoietic activity and demand. Increasing hepatic iron 
upregulates hepcidin, inhibiting further intestinal iron absorption and release from tissue stores. Conversely, increasing erythropoietic activity, which requires iron, 
suppresses hepcidin via production of erythroferrone, increasing intestinal iron absorption and export from iron stores. In the blood, Tf binds and transports ≈3 
mg iron (reflected in TSAT) that is physiologically usable by cells after uptake via the TfR-1. FP indicates ferroportin; RBC, red blood cells; RES, reticuloendothelial 
system; Tf, transferrin; TfR-1, transferrin receptor; and TSAT, transferrin saturation.

Figure 3. Absolute and functional iron deficiency.  
Iron deficiency can be absolute, when total body iron is decreased, or functional, when total body iron is normal or increased but sufficient iron is not available 
to target tissues because of iron sequestration in the storage pool (iron maldistribution). Both storage and functional pools are smaller in absolute iron deficiency, 
whereas only the functional pool is reduced in functional iron deficiency. Either condition can occur independently or coexist in an individual patient. Absolute iron 
deficiency in HF can result from reduced intake because of anorexia, cardiac cachexia, impaired iron absorption resulting from intestinal edema, and (Continued

in cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality (risk re-
duction 0.45 [95% CI, 0.29–0.71] versus 1.55 [95% 
CI, 0.69–3.47] for patients with TSAT >19.8%; interac-
tion P=0.009).69 Thus, although the conventional defi-
nition of ID (ferritin <100 µg/L or 100–300 µg/L with 
TSAT <20%) performs reasonably well in diagnosing ID 
in patients with HF, a single parameter (TSAT ≤19.8% 
alone) performed at least as well in detecting true ID 
and identified subjects who responded to intravenous 
FCM on retrospective analysis. Ferritin levels may be 
more relevant for monitoring iron overload rather than 
diagnosis of ID in patients with HF.
Pathophysiological Consequences of ID
Although ID is associated with several clinical conse-
quences related to erythropoiesis, chronic ID by itself, 
independently of anemia, impairs oxidative metabo-
lism, cellular energetics, and immune mechanisms that 
can cause structural and functional change in the myo-
cardium, decreasing oxygen storage in myoglobin and

aspirin, antiplatelet agents, or anticoagulants or important coexisting conditions such as malignancies of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract.61–63 Functional 
iron deficiency in HF results from mechanisms similar to those responsible for the anemia of chronic disease or inflammation.59,61,63 HF is associated with increased 
levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cytokines, particularly IL-6, upregulate hepatic hepcidin 
production via Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which binds, internalizes, and degrades ferroportin. This results in impairment of iron 
absorption into the blood from enterocytes and entrapment of iron in the storage pool (liver and reticuloendothelial cells). Together, these effects result in relative 
iron depletion in erythroid cells and nonerythroid tissues (functional pool). Inflammatory cytokines also blunt renal erythropoietin production and erythroblast 
responsiveness to erythropoietin. Erythroblast proliferation is also directly inhibited by elevated levels of hepcidin, further impairing hemoglobin synthesis. HF 
indicates heart failure; and Tf, transferrin.

reducing tissue oxidative capacity, leading to mitochon-
drial and LV dysfunction.76,77 Myocardial iron stores may 
be depleted in HF but correlate poorly with circulating 
markers of iron stores.78 Melenovsky and colleagues55 
found that myocardial iron content in 91 patients with 
HF was lower than in 38 normal control organ donors 
(156±41 versus 200±38 µg/g dry weight, respectively; 
P<0.001). Reduced myocardial iron correlated with 
lower activity of citric acid cycle enzymes (aconitase 
and citrate synthase); diminished reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS) protecting enzymes, including catalase, glu-
tathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase; and re-
duced mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Myocardial 
ID in patients with HF might therefore further promote 
glucose rather than fatty acid utilization and, coupled 
with impaired protection against ROS, contribute to 
myocardial dysfunction and adverse remodeling. That 
severe myocardial ID can cause mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion is supported by the observation that isolated car-
diac ID (induced by myocardial transferrin receptor 1 
inactivation) induces mitochondrial respiratory dysfunc-
tion and fatal cardiomyopathy in mice.79 Iron supple-
mentation partly prevented these adverse effects, sug-
gesting a possible mechanism for the clinical benefit of 
intravenous iron in patients with HF (discussed below).
Impact of ID on Exercise Capacity, QoL, 
and Outcomes
Several studies showed that ID in patients with HF is 
associated with reduced exercise capacity, impaired 
QoL, and poor prognosis independently of anemia and 
LVEF.58,60,80,81 In a prospective study on 443 patients with 
stable HF and a mean LVEF of 26%, ID (serum ferritin 
<100 μg/L or 100–300 μg/L with TSAT <20%) was pres-
ent in 35%. Peak Vo2 was significantly lower in those 
with ID compared with those without ID (peak Vo2, 
13.3±4.0 versus 15.3±4.5 mL·min−1·kg−1). In multivari-
able models, ID was associated with reduced peak Vo2 
independently of demographics and clinical variables, 
including anemia.80
Several observational studies have shown that the 
presence of ID in patients with HF with and without 
anemia is significantly associated with mortality inde-
pendently of other prognostic factors.57,60,82 In 546 Pol-
ish patients with HF, absolute or functional ID (ferritin 
<100 µg/L or 100–300 µg/L with TSAT <20%) was pres-
ent in 37% of patients; 57% were anemic and 32% 
were not anemic.82 On multivariable analysis, ID but not 
anemia was associated with a higher risk of death or 
heart transplantation (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.14–2.17; 
P<0.01). In a pooled international cohort comprising 
1506 patients with HF, anemia, higher NYHA class, 
higher NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-BNP) levels, lower 
RBC mean corpuscular volume, and female sex predict-
ed ID. ID but not anemia remained a strong indepen-
dent predictor of mortality in multivariable models that 
included NYHA class and NT-proBNP (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 
1.14–1.77; P=0.002),60 underscoring the importance of 
ID over anemia in predicting outcomes in HF. Similar 
findings were reported in an Asian cohort.57 Adverse 
effects of ID on exercise capacity in patients with HF 
may therefore be a consequence of the nonhemato-
poietic (rather than erythroid) effects of iron on energy 
metabolism and myocardial structure and function.76–79 
This possibility needs to be examined prospectively.
INTRAVENOUS IRON REPLACEMENT 
THERAPY IN HF
Although the role of ID in HF pathogenesis is only just 
being clarified, investigators have been testing the safe-
ty and efficacy of intravenous iron in patients with HFrEF 
and ID for >10 years. As of 2017, 8 studies (2 small un-
controlled studies and 6 RCTs [3 small and 3 medium-
sized trials]) reported the effects of intravenous iron in 
patients with HFrEF (Table II in the online-only Data Sup-
plement). The primary objective of these studies was 
to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous 
iron on exercise capacity, NYHA class, and QoL. Clini-
cal events were recorded as safety and secondary out-
comes. Five studies (n=103 patients) used intravenous 
iron sucrose; 3 studies (n=504) used FCM. Therefore, 
the highest level of evidence for the safety and efficacy 
of intravenous iron therapy in patients with HFrEF and 
ID is with FCM. Four meta-analyses of published data 
reported the effects of intravenous iron on the second-
ary outcomes of HF hospitalizations and mortality.83–86 
In addition, a robust meta-analysis of intravenous FCM 
on mortality and hospitalizations using individual pa-
tient data extracted from 4 RCTs, including data from 
2 small previously unreported studies (FER-CARS-01 
and EFFICACY-HF [Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on 
Exercise Capacity and Cardiac Function in Patients With 
Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure]), has recently 
been published.87
Bolger and colleagues88 first reported an uncon-
trolled open-label study of 16 anemic (hemoglobin ≤12 
g/dL) patients with HF given intravenous iron sucrose 
for 12 to 17 days and followed up for 92±6 days. Iron 
treatment increased serum iron, ferritin, TSAT, and he-
moglobin (11.2±0.7–12.6±1.2 g/dL; P=0.0007) and im-
proved NYHA class, Minnesota Living With Heart Failure 
Questionnaire score, and 6MWD. In another open-label 
study, intravenous iron sucrose treatment in 32 patients 
with anemia and ID was associated with favorable ef-
fects on LV remodeling and NYHA functional class.89
The first randomized study was a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial in 40 anemic patients with 
HF.90 Twenty control subjects received intravenous sa-
line and 20 received 200 mg intravenous iron sucrose

weekly for 5 weeks. After 6 months, hemoglobin in-
creased by a mean of 1.4 g/dL (P<0.01), and there 
was improvement in creatinine clearance and Minne-
sota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score, a 
decrease in C-reactive protein and NT-proBNP, and an 
increase in LVEF and 6MWD in the intravenous iron 
but not placebo group. FERRIC-HF (Ferric Iron Sucrose 
in Heart Failure)91 was the first trial to use an inclu-
sion criterion of ID defined as ferritin <100 µg/L or 
100 to 300 µg/L with TSAT <20%. This definition of 
ID has since been used in all subsequent trials. Eigh-
teen anemic (hemoglobin, <12.5 g/dL) and 17 non-
anemic (hemoglobin, 12.5–14.5 g/dL) patients with ID 
and peak Vo2 ≤18 mL·kg−1·min−1 were randomized to 
open-label, observer-blinded treatment with placebo 
or intravenous iron sucrose 200 mg/wk for 4 weeks 
during the initial ID correction phase (using the Gan-
zoni formula; Table 2) and additional iron sucrose 200 
mg/mo as required during the maintenance phase or 
to no treatment for the next 3 months. The iron re-
quirement was higher in patients with anemia than 
in those without anemia (1051 versus 781 mg). Iron 
therapy increased serum ferritin and improved NYHA 
class, but unlike the previous 2 studies, hemoglobin 
did not increase. Peak Vo2 increased significantly in 
anemic but not in nonanemic patients.
FAIR-HF (Ferinject Assessment in Patients With Iron 
Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure) is the largest ran-
domized study reported so far.92 Patients (n=459) with 
HF and ID (ferritin <100 μg/L or 100–300 μg/L with 
TSAT <20%), with anemia (hemoglobin 9.5–12.0 g/dL) 
or without anemia (hemoglobin 12.0–13.5 g/dL), were 
randomly assigned 2:1 to intravenous FCM (n=304) or 
saline (n=155). FCM increased ferritin levels in all pa-
tients with a modest increase in hemoglobin only in 
anemic patients (0.9 g/dL; P<0.001 versus controls) but 
not in those without anemia (0.2 g/dL; P=0.21). FCM 
improved patients’ global assessment and NYHA class 
(both P<0.001), the coprimary end point. The benefi-
cial effect of iron was similar in patients with and with-
out baseline anemia. QoL and 6MWD also improved. 
However, there were no significant effects on all-cause 
mortality (3.4% versus 5.5%, FCM versus control) or 
first hospitalization (17.7% versus 24.8%). FCM was 
generally well tolerated. Adverse events were similar in 
both groups.
The design of CONFIRM-HF (A Study to Compare 
the Use of Ferric Carboxymaltose With Placebo in Pa-
tients With Chronic Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency)95 
was very similar to that of FAIR-HF except for higher 
doses of FCM given for a longer duration (52 weeks). 
Patients (n=304) with LVEF ≤45%, elevated natriuretic 
peptides, and ID (ferritin <100 µg/L or 100–300 µg/L if 
TSAT <20%) were randomized 1:1 to intravenous FCM 
(n=152) or placebo (saline; n=152). FCM significantly 
improved the primary end point of 6MWD at week 24 
compared with placebo, a benefit sustained at 1 year. 
This was associated with significant improvements in 
secondary end points, including NYHA class, patient 
global assessment, QoL, and fatigue score. FCM treat-
ment was also associated with a significant reduction 
in the risk of hospitalizations for worsening HF (HR, 
0.39; 95% CI, 0.19–0.82; P=0.009) with no difference 
in all-cause mortality. These findings indicate that the 
benefits of FCM on functional capacity, symptoms, and 
QoL in symptomatic, iron-deficient patients with HF are 
sustainable over a 1-year period. Unlike previous stud-
ies, CONFIRM-HF95 also showed that the use of intrave-
nous iron may be associated with a reduction in the risk 
of hospitalization for worsening HF.
The most recent study, EFFECT-HF (Effect of Ferric 
Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients With 
Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure),96 random-
ized 172 patients with HFrEF and ID (ferritin <100 µg/L 
or 100–300 µg/L if TSAT <20%), NYHA class II to III HF, 
LVEF <45%, BNP >100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >400 pg/
mL, hemoglobin <15 g/dL, and peak Vo2 of 10 to 20 
mL·kg−1·min−1 to FCM (n=86) or standard care (n=86, 
who could receive oral iron as needed). At 24 weeks, 
the primary end point of change in peak Vo2 from 
baseline was no different between the FCM and con-
trol groups (∆peak Vo2, −0.16±0.373 mL·min−1·kg−1 in 
those receiving FCM and −0.63±0.375 mL·min−1·kg−1 in 
controls; P=0.23) in an analysis in which missing data 
were not imputed. Patients’ global assessment and 
functional (NYHA) class improved on FCM versus stan-
dard of care. Outcomes were not assessed.
The meta-analysis by Anker and colleagues87 explored

cular outcomes and was reported before the results of 
EFFECT-HF were available. The authors examined indi-
vidual patient data extracted from 4 RCTs comparing 
FCM with placebo in 839 patients with HFrEF and ID, 
504 randomized to pooled FCM and 335 to pooled pla-
cebo groups. Approximately 90% of the patients were 
contributed by FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF. Patients in 
the 4 RTCs had very similar baseline characteristics; the 
same criteria were used to diagnose ID; and the same 
intravenous iron therapy (FCM) was tested. Therefore, 
this meta-analysis provides a more accurate and robust 
assessment of the relative effects of FCM on hard clini-
cal outcomes compared with other recently performed 
meta-analyses that used different criteria for diagnos-
ing ID, used different intravenous preparations, and in-
cluded patients prescribed ESAs.83–86 The main finding 
of the Anker et al87 meta-analysis is that FCM treatment 
is associated with lower rates of recurrent cardiovas-
cular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality (rate 
ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.88; P=0.009), recurrent HF 
hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality (rate ratio, 
0.53; 95% CI, 0.33–0.86; P=0.011), and recurrent car-
diovascular hospitalizations and all-cause mortality (rate

There are several potential advantages of intravenous vs oral iron: It can be administered in a few doses; it rapidly restores iron stores even in the presence 
of inflammatory conditions; it causes fewer gastrointestinal side effects; and it does not depend on patient adherence/compliance. However, intravenous iron 
preparations are considerably more expensive, require facilities equipped for cardiopulmonary resuscitation because they can cause potentially fatal hypersensitivity 
reactions, and can cause iron overload if not appropriately monitored.
*According to the regulatory agency–approved drug label. Total body iron deficit, and therefore the total iron dose required, can be estimated with the Ganzoni 
formula: body weight×(15−Hb)×2.4+iron stores. Clinically, however, dose and frequency of administration are usually determined by product labels, local protocols, 
and indication for treatment. Adequacy of replacement is assessed by improvement in hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.
†In patients with heart failure, the highest level evidence is available for the use of ferric carboxymaltose.87,92,93 Furthermore, ferric carboxymaltose can be 
administered at a relatively large dose (750 mg) over a short period (7.5 min) because it is a stable, high-molecular-weight polynuclear iron (III) hydroxide carbohydrate 
complex that makes iron available in a controlled manner after uptake and regulated export by reticuloendothelial cells and releases less labile iron that could cause 
iron toxicity.94

ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.88; P=0.009). Intravenous 
iron was not associated with increased risk of adverse 
events. However, a troublesome and hypothesis-gener-
ating finding comes from a prespecified subgroup anal-
ysis demonstrating a significant interaction between 
baseline tertiles of TSAT and treatment effect on all 3 
composite outcomes. A TSAT-dependent effect of iron 
therapy was seen on all 3 composite outcomes, with 
greatest benefit in the lowest TSAT tertile (<12.7%) but 
no benefit in subgroups with TSAT of 12.7% to 20.1% 
and ≥20.1% (Figure 4).
Indeed, a trend to adverse effects of intravenous iron 
was seen in the highest TSAT tertile. Separately, Grote 
Beverborg and colleagues69 reported in their meta-
analysis of this same group of patients that FCM treat-
ment was associated with an improvement in cardio-
vascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality in 
those with TSAT ≤19.8% but not in those with TSAT 
>19.8%. If confirmed in prospective studies, these find-
ings would suggest that there may be no clear benefit 
of intravenous iron in patients with only a modest de-
gree of ID. These findings would be of great interest 
because, as discussed below, there are concerns about 
the deleterious effects of overcorrecting ID, particularly 
over prolonged periods.
Intravenous Iron Preparations
Parenteral iron preparations (Table 2) have seen enor-
mous development over the past 20 years. At present, 
5 intravenous iron preparations are available in the 
United States and Europe, of which 2 preparation (iron 
sucrose and FCM) have been tested prospectively in pa-
tients with HF. In addition, iron isomaltoside is available 
in Europe but not yet in the United States. Both iron 
isomaltoside and FCM enable higher doses of iron to 
be administered to replenish iron stores more rapidly.
Oral Iron Replacement Therapy in HF
Although oral iron supplementation is convenient, read-
ily available, and inexpensive, oral iron is not absorbed 
well, particularly in patients with HF because of effects 
of HF on the gastrointestinal tract and elevated hepci-
din, which inhibits iron absorption by reducing trans-
membrane ferroportin on enterocytes, thereby reduc-
ing iron transfer from enterocytes to blood.97 Moreover, 
oral iron is associated with adverse effects, particularly 
gastrointestinal intolerance, that limit compliance. Few 
studies have investigated the effects of oral iron in pa-
tients with ID and HF.98 The results of IRONOUT HF (Iron

Repletion Effects on Oxygen Uptake in Heart Failure), 
the largest randomized study to examine the effects of 
high-dose oral iron in patients with HF, was published 
recently.99 In this phase 2 double-blind RCT, 225 patients 
with NYHA class II to IV HF (median LVEF, 25%), hemo-
globin of 9 to 15 g/dL (men) or 9 to 13.5 g/dL (women), 
and ID (ferritin 15–100 µg/L or 100–299 µg/L with TSAT 
<20%) received either oral iron polysaccharide 150 mg 
twice daily or placebo. At 16 weeks, there was no sig-
nificant difference between the groups in the primary 
end point of change in peak Vo2 from baseline or in 
any secondary end point (6MWD, NT-proBNP levels, 
or Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score), 
although oral iron increased TSAT, ferritin, and hepci-
din and reduced sTfR-1 levels. These findings contrast 
with the results from trials of intravenous iron therapy 
in similar patient populations.87 Reasons for a lack of 
response to oral iron are not entirely clear. Robust re-
pletion of iron stores may be required to achieve clini-
cal benefit because oral iron induced only modest iron 
repletion (median increases from baseline in TSAT of 
3% and ferritin of 11 µg/L in IRONOUT HF), in contrast 
to median increases of 11.3% and 259.5 µg/L, respec-
tively, with intravenous iron in FAIR-HF.92 This modest 
repletion of iron stores occurred despite 15-fold more 
oral iron administered in IRONOUT HF compared with 
intravenous iron in FAIR-HF (33.6 versus ≈2 g). Patients 
with higher baseline hepcidin levels demonstrated less 
improvement in TSAT and ferritin and an attenuated 
decline in sTfR levels, suggesting that higher hepcidin 
levels may limit responsiveness to oral iron, perhaps via 
inhibiting duodenal iron absorption.
In summary, these early studies provide encouraging 
data raising the possibility that intravenous but not oral 
iron therapy has a potential role in patients with HFrEF 
and absolute or functional ID with or without anemia. 
Most studies found that intravenous iron improved 
exercise capacity, NYHA class, and QoL. Although no 
study by itself showed significant improvements in car-
diovascular mortality, meta-analyses of 4 trials demon-
strated significant improvements in objective cardiovas-
cular outcomes. Overall, intravenous iron was safe in 
the short term, but data on long-term safety and ef-
ficacy are lacking. Nevertheless, the 2016 European So-
ciety of Cardiology guidelines interpreted the available 
data as being adequate to provide a Class IIa, Level of 
Evidence A recommendation: “Intravenous FCM should 
be considered in symptomatic patients with HFrEF and 
iron deficiency (serum ferritin <100 μg/L, or ferritin 
100–299 μg/L and TSAT <20%) in order to alleviate HF 
symptoms, and improve exercise capacity and quality of 
life.”99a The 2017 American Heart Association/Ameri-
can College of Cardiology guidelines provide a lower 
Class IIb, Level of Evidence BR recommendation: “In 
patients with NYHA class II and III heart failure and iron 
deficiency (ferritin <100 µg/L or 100–300 µg/L if TSAT 
<20%), intravenous iron replacement might be reason-
able to improve functional status and QoL.”1
Despite these recommendations, long-term clinical 
studies are still required to confirm the beneficial effects 
of intravenous iron on outcomes; to provide additional 
safety data, particularly on the potential adverse effects 
of iron overload during long-term administration in pa-
tients with HF; and to determine which parameters best 
reflect iron stores to guide iron supplementation. Sev-
eral large long-term studies examining cardiovascular 
outcomes are ongoing (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Some ongoing studies directly examining 
changes in myocardial iron content, gene expression, 
and skeletal muscle metabolism are also likely to pro-
vide critical insights into the pathophysiological role of 
ID in nonerythroid tissues and the clinical effects of its 
repletion in patients with HF. Data from these studies 
are likely to provide valuable information to guide clini-
cal decision making.
POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF 
IRON OVERLOAD ON THE HEART
The human body does not possess any mechanism 
to excrete iron; instead, it regulates duodenal iron 
uptake.100 Above TSAT values of 70% to 85%, non–
transferrin-bound iron is formed, part of which is called 
labile plasma iron or labile cellular iron. Labile plasma 
iron/labile cellular iron catalyzes free radical (ROS) for-
mation, which damages mitochondria, lipids, proteins, 
and nucleic acids.101 Under normal physiological condi-
tions, duodenal iron uptake of dietary iron is reduced 
to prevent iron overload, which could lead to formation 
of free/unbound iron. However, this protective mech-
anism is bypassed when iron is administered intrave-
nously. Iron overload can cause cardiomyopathy and 
HF,102 increases the risk of bacteremia, and promotes 
ROS formation, which can cause widespread tissue 
damage and endothelial dysfunction. These effects may 
increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.103 
Several mechanisms of iron-induced cardiac damage 
have been described,104 mainly related to ROS forma-
tion, which leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis, fibrosis, 
and HF. Myocardial cells have low levels of antioxidant 
enzymes, and ROS-protective enzyme levels are further 
reduced by myocardial ID in HF,55 potentially making the 
failing heart even more susceptible to iron-mediated 
damage. Labile plasma iron/labile cellular iron directly 
enters cardiomyocytes (primarily via L-type calcium 
channels), increases ROS production, and may inhibit 
calcium influx, which further adversely influences myo-
cardial excitation-contraction coupling. Intravenous 
iron given repeatedly over long periods can lead to 
clinically relevant tissue iron overloading. For instance, 
the drug label for FCM describes iron overload–induced

hemosiderosis, leading to multiple joint disorders, walk-
ing disability, and asthenia in 1 patient and hypophos-
phatemic osteomalacia in another. It is therefore critical 
to prevent iron overload when correcting ID in patients 
with HF.
HEPCIDIN AS A POTENTIAL 
THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN HF WITH 
IRON DEFICIENCY
Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron absorption 
and distribution, and its level is increased in chronic 
diseases, including HF. Increased hepcidin reduces 
duodenal iron absorption and simultaneously re-
duces iron release from stores in reticulo-endothelial 
cells and hepatocytes, thereby causing functional ID 
(Figures 2 and 3). Blocking hepcidin might therefore 
be an effective therapeutic strategy, particularly in 
functional ID. In early human studies, several inves-
tigational antihepcidin agents increased iron bioavail-
ability. Promising strategies include directly blocking 
hepcidin expression by an anti–hepcidin l–oligoribo-
nucleotide (lexaptepid) or its activity by a fully human 
anti-hepcidin antibody or blocking hepcidin signaling 
by a small-molecule inhibitor (LDN-193189) or nonan-
ticoagulant heparins.16,105 Spironolactone, commonly 
used in patients with HF, inhibits hepcidin expression 
in mice, raising the possibility that this drug may be 
repurposed to this end.106 Whether strategies that 
downregulate hepcidin will be of clinical benefit mer-
its prospective evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS
Anemia and absolute or relative ID are common co-
morbidities in patients with HF and are associated with 
poor clinical status and worse outcomes. Although the 
cause of anemia in HF is not entirely clear, evidence 
suggests that neurohormonal and proinflammatory 
cytokine activation and renal dysfunction favor the de-
velopment of anemia of chronic disease. Whereas ESAs 
were considered to be a rational therapy to increase 
hemoglobin and to treat anemia in HF, these agents 
do not improve outcomes and may be associated with 
thromboembolic complications. ESAs are therefore not 
recommended.
Early data from short-term studies in patients with 
HFrEF and absolute or functional ID with or without 
anemia suggest that intravenous but not oral iron 
therapy may have a potential role in improving exer-
cise capacity, NYHA class, and QoL. However, larger, 
adequately powered trials with cardiovascular mortal-
ity and morbidity end points are needed to establish 
the long-term efficacy and safety of intravenous iron 
in patients with HF. The numerous long-term ongoing 
studies are likely to provide valuable information to ad-
dress these concerns and to help guide future clinical 
decision making.
