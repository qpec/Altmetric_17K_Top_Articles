Abstract
Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise in the developing aorta during embryogenesis. The 
number of HSC clones born has been estimated through transplantation, but experimental 
approaches to assess the absolute number of forming HSCs in a native setting have remained 
challenging. Here, we applied single-cell and clonal analysis of HSCs in zebrafish to quantify 
developing HSCs. Targeting creERT2 in developing cd41:eGFP+ HSCs enabled long-term 
assessment of their blood contribution. We also applied the Brainbow-based multicolour Zebrabow 
system with drl:creERT2 that is active in early haematopoiesis to induce heritable colour barcoding 
unique to each HSC and its progeny. Our findings reveal that approximately 21 HSC clones exist 
prior to HSC emergence and 30 clones are present during peak production from aortic 
endothelium. Our methods further reveal that stress haematopoiesis, including sublethal irradiation 
and transplantation, reduces clonal diversity. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the 
early clonal events that regulate haematopoietic development.
Blood homeostasis is maintained by proliferation and differentiation of clones of 
haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In vertebrates, clones arise in the haemogenic 
endothelium of the aortic floor, hereafter referred to as the ventral dorsal aorta (VDA) 
region, during the definitive wave of haematopoiesis1–3. From this stage on, blood

 production relies on the self-renewal and differentiation of existing clones rather than de 
novo generation of HSCs1. The number of clones generated in the VDA that sustain blood 
production for life remains unknown. Estimates for the number of HSCs that arise are based 
on genetic reporters, short-term fate mapping or transplantation4–7. Genetic reporters enable 
observation of putative HSCs, but cannot accurately quantify or evaluate their functional 
long-term output in vivo. Transplantation by limiting dilution is a standard and quantitative 
method for assessing HSC function and numbers, but multiple reports demonstrated altered 
HSC dynamics and clonal selection during transplantation, which do not reflect native 
haematopoiesis8–10. Alternative methods for studying endogenous HSCs may provide a 
more accurate view of the stem cell number.
Because their embryos are transparent and contain relatively few HSCs6,11, the zebrafish 
(Danio rerio) is a unique developmental system to observe native haematopoietic 
development in vivo. In Tg(cd41:eGFP) or Tg(Runx1+23:eGFP) zebrafish embryos, GFP+ 
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) appear in the VDA between 33 h post 
fertilization (hpf) and 54 hpf, with peak budding at 48 hpf6,12,13. Time-lapse imaging of 
these transgenic lines shows that, on average, about three cells per hour bud from the VDA 
and enter the circulation, suggesting that dozens of clones could give rise to definitive 
haematopoiesis5. By 80 hpf, on average five Runx1+23:eGFPhigh cells have engrafted the 
caudal haematopoietic tissue (CHT), whereas others remain in circulation. Transplantation 
by limiting dilution revealed that approximately one in three Runx1+23:eGFP+ cells have 
long-term repopulation potential6.
Here, we applied two independent fate mapping methods with clonal analysis in zebrafish to 
study contribution of embryonic HSCs to adult haematopoiesis. First, we established a 
single-cell gene induction method combined with a ligand-inducible creERT2 that induces 
permanent fluorophore expression in cd41:GFP+ cells and their progeny. Second, we 
employed the Zebrabow system with tissue-specific creERT2 expressed in haemogenic 
endothelium. These independent methods yield similar estimates for the number of HSC 
clones that are born in the VDA and survive to contribute to lifelong haematopoiesis. We 
show that the clonal contribution is altered after sublethal irradiation or transplant. Our study 
provides a framework for examining the clonality of blood in zebrafish and establishes that 
approximately 30 HSC clones arise during VDA development.
RESULTS
Laser-induced fate mapping of cd41+ cells measures the contribution of embryonic HSCs 
to adult blood
To evaluate the development of HSCs, we used the transgenic reporter line Tg(β-
actin2:loxP-STOP-loxP-DsRed-Express)sd5, also called Tg(bactin2:switch)1, that drives 
widespread reporter expression from early development throughout adulthood (Fig. 1a). We 
crossed this reporter to the dual 4-hydroxytamoxifen- (4-OHT-) and heat-inducible creERT2 
recombinase driver transgenic Tg(hsp70l:mCherry-T2A-creERT2)14. We heat-shocked 
double transgenic embryos and treated with 1 μM 4-OHT at 24 hpf, and observed high 
expression levels of DsRed-Express in all tissues at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). To determine the efficiency of labelling adult haematopoietic cells,

 we isolated whole-kidney marrow (WKM) cells from 6–9 month old transgenic 
Tg(bactin2:switch; hsp70l:mCherry-T2A-creERT2) animals and analysed reporter 
expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 1b). WKM fractions from zebrafish that received no heat 
shock contained minimal numbers (<3%) of DsRed-Express+ cells. The myeloid, precursor 
and lymphoid fractions of zebrafish that received four heat-shock treatments (6 hpf, 24 hpf, 
36 hpf and 48 hpf) contained 75% (±18.4%, s.e.m.), 58% (±14.8%), 69% (±17.2%) and 15% 
(±4.9%) DsRed-Express+ cells, respectively (Fig. 1b). Our data indicate that the majority of 
adult blood cells in the WKM are capable of being labelled with this system.
Tg(cd41:eGFP) has been used to track the migration of HSCs from the VDA to the CHT, 
thymus and pronephros5,13. Tg(cd41:eGFP;bactin2:switch;hsp70l;mCherry-T2A-creERT2) 
embryos were treated with 4-OHT and subjected to whole-embryo heat-shock induction 
between 50 hpf and 53 hpf (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Confocal microscopy of primordial 
thymuses at 75 hpf revealed abundant double-positive cd41:eGFP+;DsRed-Express+ cells, 
whereas in the absence of heat only six double-positive cells per thymic lobe were detected 
on average (Supplementary Fig. 2d). To more specifically label individual HSPCs, we 
adapted an hsp70l laser induction method that was used to trace microglial precursors in 
zebrafish15. At 48 hpf, there are only 10–15 cd41:eGFP+ cells along the VDA1,16. When we 
specifically targeted ten cd41:eGFP+ cells in the VDA with laser induction, we observed 
approximately 13 double-positive cells per thymic lobe, a significant doubling relative to the 
negative control (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d). These results demonstrate that we can 
specifically target nascent cd41:eGFP-marked HSCs as they emerge. We then analysed their 
contribution to the adult marrow. Consisting mainly of neutrophils, the myeloid fraction 
represents the current, steady-state HSC contribution to the marrow due to its restricted 
lifespan of a few days17. Between 11% and 16% (13.4% ± 2.5% s.e.m.) of this fraction were 
DsRed-Express+ at 6–9 months post induction (Fig. 1c). Without considering the precise fate 
of each HSC and with an approximate targeting efficiency of 45%, we conservatively 
estimate that there are between 25 and 36 HSCs born from the VDA (see Methods for 
estimation). To assess the accuracy of laser induction, we targeted ten cd41:eGFP− cells 
(which we would not expect to contribute to haematopoiesis) in the neighbouring ventral 
wall of the cardinal vein. WKM fractions from these animals resembled those of negative 
controls (Fig. 1c). Altogether, our observations suggest that approximately 30 HSC clones 
are in the VDA around 50 hpf, but there is appreciable background in this system. Our 
conclusion also assumes that targeted cd41:eGFP+ cells contribute to the marrow.
Optimized Zebrabow labelling using draculin:creERT2 induces colour labelling of 
embryonic haematopoiesis
To independently confirm and corroborate our findings, we sought to genetically label 
individual emerging HSC clones with the Zebrabow system18–20. Three fluorescent proteins 
(dTomato (RFP), CFP, and YFP) are driven by a ubiquitous promoter in a single cassette and 
flanked by unique lox site variants (Fig. 2a). In its default state, the Zebrabow transgene 
expresses dTomato. Upon stochastic recombination by creERT2, either CFP or YFP is 
exclusively expressed. Multiple independent integrations of the Zebrabow construct in the 
genetic background lead to different expression levels of the fluorophores after label 
induction. The resulting unique colour barcodes are inherited by all descendants of the

 labelled cell. This system has been used for clonal tracking and fate mapping in a variety of 
localized tissues, including heart, brain, large intestine and cornea19,21–23. While a recent 
study used a similar system in tracking mouse T-cell clones24, multicolour fate mapping has 
not been applied to tracking of HSCs and their descendants.
For clonal labelling of HSCs, we crossed Tg(Zebrabow-M) transgen-ics (~20 transgene 
insertions) to Tg(ubi:creERT2)25 and Tg(draculin (drl):creERT2)26. The drl regulatory 
elements are active during early development in all lineages derived from the lateral plate 
mesoderm and subsequently refine to cardiovascular lineages including HSCs, thus covering 
all haematopoietic cells (Supplementary Video 1). To extend our previous genetic lineage 
tracing26 and to demonstrate that the drl promoter is active in HSPCs, we crossed 
Tg(drl:eGFP) with Tg(Runx1+23:mCherry)6 reporter zebrafish that mark HSPCs and 
analysed co-expression by time-lapse confocal microscopy of the VDA and CHT 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). By flow cytometry, we found that the drl promoter is active in 
more than 95% of Runx1+23:mCherry+ cells throughout development (Supplementary Fig. 
3d–e). Transplantation of sorted drl:eGFP+ubi:mCherry+ cells into irradiated recipients 
demonstrated multilineage engraftment after 3 months, corroborating the view that drl 
reporters are active in functional HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3f–h). Tg(Zebrabow-
M;ubi:creERT2) and Tg(Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) embryos were treated with 10–15 μM 4-
OHT at 24 hpf, immediately prior to HSC emergence. Confocal microscopy of whole 
embryos and the CHT showed stochastic colour expression in multiple cell types at 48 hpf 
(Fig. 2b,c). We used time-lapse imaging to identify putative stem cells, characterized by 
persistence in perivascular niches and a slow division rate (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Video 
2)6. Observation of these cells revealed that they give rise to progeny of identical colour 
(Fig. 2d).
Zebrabow labelling in adults marks multilineage, polyclonal HSPCs
To evaluate HSC clonality, we raised 4-OHT-treated Tg(Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) embryos 
for 2.5–3 months before analysing their mature blood. This time frame allows for growth of 
the kidney, and the long chase period ensures that all colour recombination in the mature 
blood pool is HSC derived. Each treated zebrafish displayed a unique combination of hues in 
the peripheral blood, representing a polyclonal state (Fig. 3a,b). Control zebrafish treated 
with vehicle or lacking the creERT2 transgene showed no detectable recombination (Fig. 
3a,b, n> 75 control animals tested). To demonstrate labelling of multipotent HSCs, we sorted 
blood lineages by forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC) characteristics from WKM of 4-
OHT-treated zebrafish and imaged cells at 3 months post induction; we found that all 
lineages contained labelled cells (Fig. 3c). Percentages of recombined cells, measured by 
flow cytometry, were similar across multiple lineages, which is consistent with labelling of 
multipotent HSCs (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Analysis of myeloid and 
lymphoid lineages revealed similar colour clusters in each population (Supplementary Fig. 
4d). We quantified the lineage output of HSC clones from adults by measuring the ratio of 
myeloid to lymphoid contribution from each coloured clone (Fig. 3e). Our data show that the 
majority of HSC clones (n = 104/119) from 24 hpf to 74 hpf have a balanced lineage output 
(myeloid/lymphoid ratio between 0.5 and 2). A few colour clones (n= 15/119) seemed to 
have biased output (myeloid/lymphoid ratio below 0.5 or above 2), but these were rare and

 generally small clones. We found that labelled cells constituted more than 95% of the 
marrow, indicating the entire haematopoietic system could be fate mapped (Fig. 3d). To rule 
out colour bias in the system, we quantified the percentage of recombination for each 
fluorophore in mature granulocytes. We found no significant difference between percentages 
of cells expressing CFP or YFP, suggesting that neither recombination event is preferred or 
provides a competitive advantage to cells (Fig. 3f). These data show that early embryonic 
label induction can mark endogenous, multipotent HSCs with heritable colour barcodes.
To quantify colour barcodes, we developed a custom MATLAB graphical user interface to 
cluster flow cytometry data (Fig. 4). With flow cytometry, clusters that contributed less than 
0.5% of the granulocyte population could be detected, demonstrating a low threshold of 
detection in this system (Supplementary Fig. 5). To evaluate the potential total number of 
colours in the Zebrabow system, we carried recombination through the germline 
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). Tg(Zebrabow-M;ubi:creERT2) embryos were treated at 50% 
epiboly with 4-OHT to induce mosaic recombination in germ cells. Embryos generated by 
in-crossing of these parents were grown to adulthood. Flow cytometric analysis of WKM 
showed single-hue blood: a result of the combination of random recombination events in the 
parental transgenes (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). By mapping these single colours into the 
total available colour space, we estimated that the Zebrabow system is capable of producing 
about 40 (25–59, 95% CI, n= 13) distinguishable colours in WKM, which is highly 
dependent on transgene copy number (Supplementary Fig. 6d–f).
Fate mapping with clonal analysis at distinct developmental times defines the number of 
nascent clones
We hypothesized that early induction of clonal Zebrabow labelling in HSCs with long-term 
fate mapping, followed by quantification of colour barcodes in mature granulocytes, would 
enable us to map the number of functional HSC clones born at the time of label induction. 
Tg(Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) embryos were treated with 15 μM 4-OHT overnight (16–24 
h) at distinct developmental times. We grew embryos to adulthood (2.5–3 months) and 
analysed their WKM by flow cytometry (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). 
Quantification of colour barcodes in mature, short-lived granulocytes enabled us to estimate 
the number of contributing clones that existed during the time of label induction (Fig. 5b,c, 
Methods). This analysis predicted that, at the beginning of somitogenesis, around 13 clones 
(10.4–15.4, 95% CI, n = 9) are responsible for generating the haemogenic endothelium. A 
few hours before definitive haematopoiesis begins (24 hpf), on average 21 (19.1–23.8, 95% 
CI, n= 14) HSC clones initiate the entire adult haematopoietic system. At 48 hpf, we found 
that on average 28 (22.6–33.8, 95% CI, n= 13) HSC clones were present, which is in close 
agreement with findings from our single-cell laser induction approach, yet is substantially 
higher than the number of HSCs observed through reporter gene expression in zebrafish5,6. 
To verify that overnight treatment with 4-OHT does not over- or underestimate the number 
of HSC clones, we repeated treatment of Tg(Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) embryos at defined 
4 h intervals (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Analysis of mature granulocytes in adult marrow of 
these fish predicted 20 clones (16.1–23.4, 95% CI, n = 8) present at 24–28 hpf and 26 clones 
(22.9–29.5, n = 5) at 51–55 hpf, which agrees with our estimates from overnight treatment 
(Supplementary Fig. 8b,c). Plotting the contribution of all clones revealed non-normal

 distributions of clonal output (Fig. 5d). Our data provide a quantitative assessment of 
endogenous HSC clone number in the developing aorta.
Longitudinal analysis of the erythroid population reveals little HSPC turnover
After defining the number of nascent HSPCs in development, we investigated clonal 
dynamics in the adult. We treated Tg(Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) embryos with 4-OHT at 72 
hpf and grew the animals to adulthood. Every 4–6 weeks for 5 months, we obtained 
peripheral blood samples by retro-orbital bleeding (Fig. 6a, n = 13), and collected a terminal 
marrow sample at 11 months. We found that Zebrabow transgene expression remained stable 
in the erythrocyte population for at least 5 months (Fig. 6b). We quantified the contribution 
of 79 total clones from 13 zebrafish at three times (Fig. 6c). We did not observe any 
evidence of new colour barcodes appearing over time. The majority (73.4%) of clones 
maintained a stable contribution to the peripheral blood after 19 weeks. These findings are 
consistent with reports that clonal dynamics and competition occur at the progenitor 
level8,27.
Stress haematopoiesis leads to clonal selection
To investigate effects of perturbations on the clonality of haematopoiesis, we sublethally 
irradiated 5 month old Tg(Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) fish that had been treated with 4-OHT 
at 51 hpf and analysed their marrow 6 weeks and 20 weeks post irradiation (Fig. 7a). In non-
irradiated fish, we found a large number of granulocyte clones (8–15 clusters), with a large 
distribution of colour barcode and clonal contribution (0.25–35.7% contribution per cluster). 
In contrast, sublethally irradiated marrow displayed fewer colour barcodes in the 
granulocyte population (2–10 clusters, Fig. 7b). These clusters constituted a higher 
percentage of the myeloid population (0.3–88.9%), suggesting that some clones expanded in 
the marrow due to stress induced by irradiation (6 weeks post-treatment (wpt), average 
clonal contribution 8.5% control versus 16.2% irradiated, P = 0.017; 20 wpt, 6.1% control 
versus 21% irradiated, P = 0.021). In the total pool of irradiated zebrafish, we found three 
examples where a single cluster constituted more than 80% of the myeloid population, 
indicating a severe decrease in clonal diversity (Fig. 7d,e). Our findings demonstrate that 
sublethal irradiation leads to increased selection amongst clones.
We transplanted Zebrabow-labelled WKM into irradiated recipients to investigate 
differences between native and transplant haematopoiesis (Fig. 8a). Tg(Zebrabow-
M;drl:creERT2) donors treated at 48 hpf or 72 hpf with 4-OHT were grown to adulthood. At 
3–6 months, marrow was isolated from these donors and transplanted into lethally irradiated 
recipients. At 2.5–3 months post transplant, recipient marrow analysed by flow cytometry 
revealed long-term, multilineage reconstitution (Fig. 8b), confirming that barcoded cells 
were derived from HSCs. Engraftment was generally polyclonal, but clonal diversity was 
reduced in the majority of recipients when compared with donors, suggesting that clonal 
selection occurs (Fig. 8b). There was only one example where a new colour barcode 
emerged in recipients, which possibly indicates activation of quiescent HSCs following 
transplantation (Fig. 8b, red arrow). Clonal contribution did not correlate with contribution 
in the donors, suggesting that clonal dynamics were altered upon transplant. Analysis of 
multiple recipients that received cells from the same marrow revealed that the clonal

 contribution is not consistent across different recipients (Fig. 8c). These results suggest that 
clonal diversity is reduced during stress haematopoiesis, and our data suggest that clonal 
engraftment after transplantation does not correlate with prior contribution to the mature 
blood pool.
DISCUSSION
Our study establishes two independent fate mapping methods to quantify emergence of 
HSCs during development. Both methods reveal similar estimates for the number of nascent 
HSCs born during embryogenesis. During development of the dorsal aorta, we find that 
approximately 30 clones are responsible for generating the entire haematopoietic system, 
which will sustain the animal through its life. We and others have previously reported that 
the CHT, equivalent to the mammalian fetal liver, contains fewer than ten Runx1+23:eGFP+ 
or cd41:eGFPlow HSPCs after 50 hpf5,6. The discrepancy between these numbers and our 
fate mapping prediction could be explained by transgene variegation of previously used 
transgenic insertions, stages of stem cell maturation over multiple days, or presence of 
circulating HSCs that are challenging to quantify.
Our estimates are similar to quantification of embryonic HSC pools in both human28 and 
mouse7,29 systems. Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation in human samples estimates that 
approximately 16 clones are responsible for initiating the haematopoietic system28. Limiting 
dilution analysis in mouse embryonic tissues revealed that approximately three 
transplantable HSCs exist at the time of aorta–gonad–mesonephros (AGM) budding (E10-
E11), but this number expands to approximately 66 definitive HSCs at E127. Since this large 
expansion cannot be explained by cell division alone, it is likely that many more than three 
pre-definitive HSCs are maturing at this stage7. A major advantage of long-term fate 
mapping with genetic means to evaluate HSC output is the ability to capture such immature 
HSCs. Our studies predict that the relative number of HSCs in the zebrafish AGM equivalent 
(~30) would be in the same range as in the mouse. It is thus likely that transplant efficiencies 
of mouse AGM cells into adult hosts greatly underestimate the actual frequency of murine 
HSCs29.
Laser-induced fate mapping of cd41:eGFP+ HSCs or Zebrabow labelling using the drl 
regulatory elements labels the vast majority of adult marrow and in many instances more 
than 95% of mature blood cells. When we observed longitudinal dynamics of erythropoiesis 
with Zebrabow, there was no evidence of new colour barcodes arising up to 8 months post 
label induction. Granulocytes displayed similar colour barcodes one year after label 
induction. These data suggest that the majority of definitive HSCs are active during 
embryogenesis but show limited dynamics in adulthood. This conclusion is consistent with 
recent fate mapping efforts in mouse, which demonstrated that the bulk of HSCs are highly 
active in producing progenitor and mature compartments during embryogenesis27. Labelling 
of HSCs during embryogenesis with an HSC-specific Tie2:iCre reached equilibrium with 
label in the peripheral system within one week27. In contrast, induction of labelling in adult 
mouse revealed that the HSC contribution is not observed until 16–20 weeks later. Another 
report using inducible transposon barcodes in mouse haematopoiesis also found that blood 
production in the adult is mainly driven by successive waves of progenitor populations as 
Henninger et al.

 opposed to contribution from HSCs8. Our findings in light of these data suggest that HSCs 
are most productive during early clonal events in the embryo.
Pertaining to stress haematopoiesis, sublethal irradiation and transplantation influences 
clonal diversity of the marrow. Sublethal irradiation led to increased production of mature 
blood from fewer clones. One possible mechanism is that irradiation eliminates some HSPC 
clones, and their empty niches are taken over by descendants of surviving HSCs. 
Transplantation of labelled marrow also reduced clonality in recipients, which may be 
selective or induced by environmental triggers. We found no observable correlation between 
clonal distribution in donor and recipient marrows. This suggests that clonal activity in the 
donor does not reflect or determine the dynamics of marrow reconstitution. The reduction in 
clonality is consistent with other reports comparing barcoded native and transplant 
haematopoiesis8,30. Our data combined with these studies demonstrate that repopulation 
dynamics of HSC clones after transplant are highly unpredictable.
The fate mapping systems introduced in our study will be useful to evaluate the genetics of 
clonal diversity in both native and malignant settings. The production of blood by one or a 
few stem cell clones with somatic mutations renders patients susceptible to multiple 
haematopoietic malignancies31,32. Our fate mapping systems combined with mosaic gene 
knockout technologies33 in zebrafish could be instrumental to study the genetics of clonality.

Zebrafish are bred and maintained as described34 and in accordance with University of 
California, San Diego and Boston Children’s Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use

0.17 mM KCl, 0.25 mM CaCl2 and 0.15 mM MgSO4). At 24 hpf, embryos are 
dechorionated with 50 mg ml−1 pronase (Roche) and then placed in embryo buffer 
supplemented with 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (Sigma) to prevent pigmentation for optimal

 Whole-embryo heat shock and tamoxifen treatments
Embryos are transferred to a 50 ml conical tube, and the buffer is replaced with embryo 
buffer that has been heated to 38 °C. The tube containing the embryos is immediately placed 
in a 38 °C water bath for the duration of the heat shock. Upon completion of heat shock, 
embryos are transferred to a 10 cm petri dish, buffer is replaced with embryo buffer 
containing 1 μM 4-OHT (Sigma H7904)25, and embryos are kept in a 28 °C incubator. After 
12 h of incubation with 4-OHT, embryos are placed in fresh embryo buffer. For adult blood 
analysis, embryos are transferred to a 28 °C aquatic housing system (Aquaneering) at 6 dpf. 
Embryos lacking both heat and 4-OHT treatment did not show any DsRed-Express signal. 
We observed mCherry expression in the presence of heat shock, regardless of 4-OHT 
treatment. To restrict experimental variables to heat induction, all experiments were 
conducted in the presence of 4-OHT. Percentages of DsRed-Express+ erythrocytes were low, 
probably due to the reduced activity of the β-actin2 promoter upon erythroid 
differentiation1,36.
For Zebrabow labelling, embryos are dechorionated following the procedure described 
above and transferred to six-well plates at a density of 25–30 embryos per well. Embryo 
buffer is replaced with embryo buffer containing 10–15 μM 4-OHT (Sigma, H7904), and 
embryos are kept in the dark overnight (16 h treatments) or for 4 h in a 28 °C incubator. 
After treatment, embryos are washed with fresh embryo buffer and transferred to new 
embryo buffer in a 28 °C incubator.
Single-cell laser induction
Embryos are anaesthetized with 0.02% tricaine (ethyl-3-aminobenzoate) (Sigma, E10521) in 
embryo buffer. Embryos are transferred onto a 40 mm glass-bottom dish with 0.17 mm 
thickness (WillCo Wells, GWST 5040). The dish is placed on the platform of a Leica 
DMI6000 inverted microscope. Individual cells are targeted with a 440 nm wavelength laser 
dye (5 mM coumarin 440 in methanol, with peak λ ~ 435 nm) with a MicroPoint system 
(Photonic Instruments) routed through the epifluorescence port and ×20 objective. Each cell 
is targeted with a 10 Hz pulse for 2 min. Embryos are transferred to a 10 cm petri dish 
containing 1 μM 4-OHT in embryo buffer and left to recover for 12 h in a 28 °C incubator. 
Buffer is then replaced with fresh embryo buffer. For adult blood analysis, embryos are 
transferred to a 28 °C aquatic housing system (Aquaneering) at 6 dpf.
Imaging and microscopy
During imaging, embryos are anaesthetized with 0.02% tricaine in embryo buffer. Embryos 
are imaged using a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope, Leica SP5 inverted confocal 
microscope (Wetzlar) or Leica SP8X inverted confocal microscope (for Zebrabow images). 
Images are analysed with Imaris (Bitplane), Volocity Acquisition and Restoration software 
(Improvision) and ImageJ/Fiji. With the SP5, DsRed-Express and mCherry are excited by 
543 and 594 nm laser lines, respectively; eGFP is excited by a 488 nm laser line. For 
Zebrabow colour detection, CFP, YFP and dTomato are excited with 447 nm, 515 nm and 
555 nm laser lines, respectively. Individual channels were uniformly adjusted with 
Photoshop CS6 (Adobe) for display purposes. All quantification and data analysis were 
conducted on raw images. Imaging experiments were repeated at least three times.

 Cell collection and flow cytometry
Adult fish between the ages of three and nine months post fertilization (3 mpf to 9 mpf) are 
anaesthetized with 0.02% tricaine in embryo buffer and dissected under a Leica MZ75 light 
microscope to collect the WKM. A single-cell suspension is mechanically prepared by 
pipetting the WKM up and down 50 times in cold 1× PBS (or 0.9× PBS with 2% FBS) and 
then passed through a 40 μm nylon mesh. Samples are subjected to 5 nM SYTOX Red dead 
cell stain (Invitrogen, S34859) or 3 nM DRAQ-7 dead cell stain (Abcam, ab109202) for 
Zebrabow analysis. Flow cytometry was done with a BD LSR II machine or BD FACS Aria 
IIIu Cell Sorter (Becton Dickinson) and analysed with FloJo software (Tree Star). For 
optimized Zebrabow colour detection, a 445 nm laser was used for excitation of CFP.
Adult–adult HSPC transplantation and sublethal irradiation
drl:GFP transplant—WKM from 3 month Tg(drl:GFP;ubi:mCherry) zebrafish was 
isolated and sorted by FACS. Cells were specifically enriched from the lymphoid/progenitor 
and precursor gates. Double-positive cells (6 × 104) were transplanted into irradiated casper 
recipients (n = 30 recipients). At 3 months post-transplant, WKM and peripheral blood from 
recipient fish was collected and analysed by flow cytometry to detect chimaerism levels of 
mCherry and eGFP-positive cells. We confirmed multilineage reconstitution by observing 
differentiated eGFP-positive cells in multiple cell populations, as determined by forward and 
side-scatter profiles.
Zebrabow transplant—WKM from 3 month Tg(ubi:Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) fish that 
were treated at either 48 hpf or 72 hpf with 4-OHT was isolated according to the procedures 
described above. WKM cells were transplanted into irradiated casper recipients (11 donors, 
average of eight recipients/donor) at 1.5× 105 non-erythroid cells per recipient. At 2.5–3 
months post transplant, WKM and peripheral blood from recipient fish was collected and 
analysed as described above.
Sublethal irradiation—Tg(ubi:Zebrabow-M;drl:creERT2) fish that were treated at 51 hpf 
with 4-OHT were grown to 5 months. They were then subjected to split dose 30 Gy 
irradiation. WKM was isolated from irradiated fish or non-irradiated controls at 6 and 20 
weeks post irradiation and analysed by flow cytometry.
Zebrabow longitudinal analysis
Zebrafish were anaesthetized with 0.02% tricaine in fish water and bled retro-orbitally with 
a 10 μl bevelled Hamilton syringe. Blood was collected in 0.9× PBS with 2% FBS and 
heparin (1 U). Because there are insufficient numbers of granulocytes in the zebrafish 
peripheral blood, we were only able to observe clonal dynamics of the erythrocyte 
population (Fig. 6b). Erythrocytes are relatively dim in Zebrabow expression, so we chose 
the three times where the detection by flow cytometry was optimal. We used a custom 
MATLAB graphical user interface with manual gating in ratiometric ternary colour space to 
quantify individual clones longitudinally. The contribution of each clone was normalized to 
the first time of collection. We define a stable contribution to the peripheral blood as a 
contribution between 0.5- and twofold relative to the first time.

 Zebrabow cluster analysis
A custom MATLAB graphical user interface was developed to quantify colour barcodes 
using flow cytometry data exported from FloJo software (Tree Star). Live granulocytes, 
which are mainly composed of neutrophils (~80%), were isolated by FSC/SSC 
characteristics (step 1). These cells express the Zebrabow transgenes at the highest level in 
the marrow and are most useful for studying the clonal contribution from stem cells due to 
their short lifespan. We transformed (logicle) and normalized the intensities of the three 
Zebrabow fluorescent proteins in these cells and plotted them in 2D with ternary plots (step 
2). This method revealed visual clusters that correspond to unique colour barcodes (step 3), 
where dTomato+CFP−YFP− cells denote polyclonal cells derived from HSCs that did not 
recombine. These red cells were ignored for analysis. To more accurately quantify the colour 
clusters, we employed a recently described clustering method that measures the density (ρ) 
of each cell in colour space (RGB) or ratiometric ternary space and the distance that each 
cell is from cells with higher density (δ)37. The cells with high ρ and δ values are most 
likely to be cluster centres. Plotting these metrics revealed the cluster centres (step 4), and 
the remainder of the cells were assigned to clusters by a nearest neighbour algorithm (step 
5). The quality of clustering solutions was evaluated by the silhouette criterion, which 
measures the similarity between points in a cluster when compared with points in other 
clusters38 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5).
In cases of low labelling density, where the majority of the mature blood cells derived from 
HSCs that did not recombine, we could be more confident that non-red clusters are clonal in 
origin. In cases of high label density, where the majority of the cells have recombined, we 
observed some clusters that constituted significant percentages of the mature blood (>20%). 
It is possible that large HSC clones were present, but it is more likely that multiple, smaller 
clones expressed the same colour barcode. To accurately predict the clonal contribution in 
the blood, we ignored these large clusters (see examples in Supplementary Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Fig. 7). High quality clusters (average silhouette value > 0.6) that contributed 
less than 0.5% of the granulocyte population could be detected. Clusters that contained 
fewer than 25 cells (out of 10,000 sampled, 0.25%) were also ignored for analysis. With 
treatment after 72 hpf, it is likely that we have saturated the number of colours possible for 
the Zebrabow system, which obscures clonal analysis.
Calculation of HSC number
Laser-induced fate mapping—Heat shock by targeted laser induction is not 100% 
efficient. To test for efficiency with our system, we targeted mesenchymal cells in the medial 
fin fold with laser induction. We found that approximately 45% of targeted cells express the 
DsRed-Express reporter. Out of ten cd41:eGFP+ cells, we estimate that ~4.5 cells on average 
actually recombine to turn on the reporter. In targeted adults, we found that 13.4% of 
granulocytes were labelled on average. 13.4% of labelled granulocytes/4.5 HSCs = ~ 3% 
granulocytes/HSC. Extrapolating to the whole population, 100%/3% = 33 HSCs.
Zebrabow clonal labeling—Colour barcodes were quantified according to the method 
described above in granulocytes from adult zebrafish that had been treated with 4-OHT at 
distinct developmental times. Clustering solutions for each adult marrow were evaluated by

 the silhouette value criterion, and clusters with silhouette values less than 0.75 were 
excluded from analysis. Outlier clusters, defined as more than 1.5 multiplied by the 
interquartile range of the clusters, were also excluded from analysis. These large outlier 
clusters are more likely to be polyclonal populations, where multiple stem cell clones 
express identical colour barcodes. All of the clusters that fit this criteria are shown in the 
violin plots of Fig. 5d. For each zebrafish, we obtained the average contribution of the clones 
that fitted these criteria. The average clonal contribution was then used to extrapolate to the 
entirety of the granulocyte pool (for example, an average clonal contribution of 5% 
extrapolates to 100%/5% = 20 clones). Averaging the data over multiple adult zebrafish led 
to the extrapolated clone numbers provided in Fig. 5b,c.
Our estimates of predicted clones rely on two main assumptions. First, we assume that rare 
colour barcodes in the mature granulocytes are more likely to be clonal populations. Second, 
we assume that the distribution of these rare barcodes reflects the distribution of clones in 
the remainder of the mature blood. It is also important to note that these predicted clones 
may not be functional HSCs at the time of label induction. In early treatments, we are most 
probably labelling a combination of functional HSCs, immature HSCs and haemogenic 
endothelium that will give rise to functional HSCs.
Statistics and reproducibility
Graphs and statistical analysis are done with Excel (Microsoft) and Prism (GraphPad 
Software). Descriptive statistics provide the mean and s.e.m. or s.d. P-values are obtained 
with two-tailed t-tests or one-way or two-way ANOVA, as denoted in figure legends. 
Confidence intervals were 95%. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. 
The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation 
during experiments or outcome assessment.
Experiments for Figs 1, 3e, 5, 6 and 7 and Supplementary Figs 3d–h, 6c–e and 8 were 
conducted once with the biological replicates noted in figure legends. Experiments for the 
remaining figures, especially those showing representative images (Figs 2 and 3 and 
Supplementary Figs 1, 2, 3 and 6), were repeated independently with similar results at least 
twice with the biological replicates noted in the figure legends.

time, while the y axis shows the log2 percentage contribution of each clone (black dots) to 
the total granulocyte pool. At later treatment times, the mean clonal contribution (black line) 
decreases as the number of clones increases (n = 108, 98, 116 and 71 colour clusters for 10, 
24, 48 and 72 hpf, respectively). Cluster data are available in Supplementary Table 1.

 Figure 6. 
Longitudinal dynamics of labelled erythrocytes. (a) Strategy to evaluate clonal dynamics in 
the erythroid lineage. (b) Example ternary diagrams that show colour barcode distribution 
measured by flow cytometry from a single fish over time. The last ternary plot shows 
colours in granulocytes at a final time (red arrows, clone with decreased contribution over 
time in erythrocytes (RBCs); blue arrows, clone with increased contribution). (c) 
Quantification of individual clonal contribution over three analysis times. The contributions 
of individual colour clones (black dots) were compared across multiple times (log2 scale). 
Data were normalized to the contribution at the first time. The majority of clones maintain a 
stable contribution to the blood pool, while a few clones increase (>2-fold) or decrease (>2-
fold) in contribution over time relative to the initial time.

Sublethal irradiation of Zebrabow-labelled marrow. (a) Strategy to measure the effects of 
sublethal irradiation on clonal diversity in Zebrabow-labelled marrow. (b) Quantification of 
colour barcodes in mature granulocytes as a percentage of total cells (log2 scale) in control 
or irradiated animals. Each column of circles corresponds to an individual animal. Box plots 
show the median and interquartile range (n = 6 and 8 fish for control and irradiated 
conditions at 6 weeks post irradiation, n = 5 and 12 fish for control and irradiated conditions 
at 20 weeks post irradiation). (c) Summary of sublethal irradiation data, showing mean 
cluster sizes in control and irradiated animals (error bars, s.e.m.). Each marker corresponds 
to an individual animal (n values are identical to those in (b), *P < 0.05, P = 0.017 at 6 
weeks, P = 0.021 at 20 weeks, two-tailed t-test). (d) Example ternary plots from control and 
irradiated adult zebrafish demonstrating severe reduction of clonal diversity. The red arrows 
indicate an expanded clone. (e) Stacked bar graphs showing the clonal distribution of control 
and irradiated adult zebrafish.

Transplant of Zebrabow-labelled marrow into lethally irradiated recipients. (a) 
Transplantation strategy for labelled marrow. (b) Example ternary diagrams showing colour 
distribution in granulocytes for three donors with two recipients per donor (red arrow, new 
colour barcode in recipient). (c) Bar graphs show colour barcode distributions in 
granulocytes of donors and recipients depicted in b. Each column corresponds to a single 
animal.
