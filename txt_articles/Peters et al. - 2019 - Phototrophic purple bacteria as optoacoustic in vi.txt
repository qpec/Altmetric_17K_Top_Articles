Τhe morphology, physiology and immunology, of solid tumors exhibit spatial heterogeneity
which complicates our understanding of cancer progression and therapy response. Under-
standing spatial heterogeneity necessitates high resolution in vivo imaging of anatomical
and pathophysiological tumor information. We introduce Rhodobacter as bacterial reporter
for multispectral optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography (MSOT). We show that
endogenous bacteriochlorophyll a in Rhodobacter gives rise to strong optoacoustic signals
>800 nm away from interfering endogenous absorbers. Importantly, our results suggest
that changes in the spectral signature of Rhodobacter which depend on macrophage
activity inside the tumor can be used to reveal heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment.
Employing non-invasive high resolution MSOT in longitudinal studies we show spatio-
temporal changes of Rhodobacter spectral profiles in mice bearing 4T1 and CT26.WT tumor
models. Accessibility of Rhodobacter to genetic modification and thus to sensory and
therapeutic functions suggests potential for a theranostic platform organism.

olid tumors are highly heterogeneous, containing sub-
populations of genetically—and phenotypically distinct
cells1. These microenvironments are characterized by spa-
tial differences in oxygen tension, pH, nutrient availability, and
immune system accessibility. In addition, tumor microenviron-
ments exhibit a variable distribution of specific cells strongly
implicated in tumor transition towards malignancy such as
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)2,3. This heterogeneity
further complicates our understanding of tumor biology and
disease progression, and challenges therapeutic interventions4. In
vivo high-resolution imaging has been a fundamental tool for
spatially resolving tumor morphology, physiology, or biochemical
composition, thereby allowing to unravel underlying driving
forces of tumor biology. Intravital microscopy of the tumor
microenvironment is broadly employed in oncological research
but suffers from a limited field-of-view and penetration depth5.
Radiological methods, such as positron emission tomography
(PET) can image tumor pathophysiology at much larger scales
but exhibit limited spatial resolution6. Magnetic resonance ima-
ging (MRI)7, X-ray, computer tomography (CT), or ultra-
sonography enable high-resolution visualization of morphology
and functional tumor parameters, but detailed sensing of patho-
physiological parameters over time is challenging due to the
limited sensitivity afforded. Moreover, techniques such as PET
or MRI require large infrastructure out of the reach of many
research institutions.
Multispectral optoacoustic (OA) tomography (MSOT) com-
bines optical contrast with ultrasound resolution enabling high-
resolution real time in vivo imaging well-beyond the 1 mm
penetration depth typical of microscopy methods8,9. Therefore, it
is emerging as a particularly interesting alternative imaging
method in cancer research. However, in label-free mode, it only
records a limited number of factors of tumor pathophysiology,
e.g., angiogenesis. Therefore, several agents have been considered
for extending the optoacoustic capacity, including nanoparticles
and targeted chromophores which however are only transient and
do not allow longitudinal studies (reviewed in ref. 10). Transgenic
expression of labels has also been considered for OA imaging, in
particular fluorescent proteins as well as the pigments melanin,
violacein, or an indigo dye produced by enzymatic cleavage of
X-gal (reviewed in ref. 11). Major challenges of these genetically
encoded labels are the absorbance in the visible part of the
spectrum hampering their detection deep in tissues due to strong
absorbance of blood at those wavelengths. In contrast, the
absorption spectrum of melanin extends to the near-infrared
region (NIR) however lacks distinct peaks12 making it difficult to
separate its OA signal from background noise. Moreover,
synthesis of melanin in mammalian cell lines for longitudinal
studies is often precluded by long-term toxic effects13.
Here, we propose an alternative OA reporter based on a bac-
terial system. Bacteria have been considered for visualization14
together with therapeutic purposes15,16 like release of anti-
tumorigenic payloads, acting as a vector for delivering transgenes
into mammalian recipient cells17 or directly hampering tumor
cell proliferation18,19. However, no study has attempted to use
bacteria for in vivo monitoring of pathophysiological processes.
Here, we consider facultative phototrophic purple bacteria that
are intrinsically rich in bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a), which
exhibits several favorable characteristics as OA labels: two clearly
defined spectral bands in the near-infrared range (λmax of 800 and
~860 nm) with high molar absorptivity20,21 which are red-shifted
compared to all genetically encoded labels reported for OA so far,
suggesting a unique potential for clear differentiation of bacterial
signal from endogenous absorbers prevalent in tissue such as
blood hemoglobin and lipids. Compared to free BChl a that
absorbs primarily at ~770 nm in solution, the peak signature in
phototrophic bacteria is heavily shaped by the BChl a being
embedded in the membrane-bound photosynthetic machinery.
This spectral tunability can basically be applied for reporter
approaches. Since a recent work has reported the targeting of
Rhodobacter sphaeroides to various solid tumors22, purple non-
sulfur bacteria of the genus Rhodobacter, which have been
extensively used as model organisms to study the regulation and
function of anoxygenic photosynthesis23–25, may be particularly
suited for developing MSOT compatible reporters applicable for
in vivo tumor studies.
However, different factors and microenvironmental conditions
are likely to influence the fate of Rhodobacter and hence the
BChl a-derived OA signal. Those are, for example, the initial
pigment levels before injection which can be affected by indivi-
dual strain characteristics and cultivation conditions, as well as
components of the bacterial cell envelope including lipopoly-
saccharides (LPS) and capsular or exopolysaccharides (EPS) that
might further affect the interaction between the bacterial cell and
the microenvironment inside the tumor. Therefore, we investigate
the suitability of different Rhodobacter species for optoacoustic
signal generation, explore their fate after intratumoral injection
and the potential of their distinct spectral signature to carry any
additional information from the tumor microenvironment.
Results
BChl a production in different purple bacterial strains. Bacteria
used for tumor imaging are required to tolerate the temperature
of their respective host. Phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria,
however, generally prefer growth temperatures of 30 °C and
below. Furthermore, in these bacteria efficient photopigment
synthesis, which is essential for sensitive OA detection, is gen-
erally favored by lowered oxygen accessibility and high nutrient
availability. To identify the optimal strain/cultivation combina-
tion for MSOT applications, we first analyzed the viability, pig-
ment production, and corresponding absorption properties of
different photosynthetic bacteria at 37 °C under anaerobic and
microaerobic conditions in various media and light regimes (see
Methods section and legend of Supplementary Table 1 for details
on growth conditions).
In addition to Rba. sphaeroides ATH 2.4.1, which could
successfully be used for tumor targeting and visualization by
detecting BChl a-dependent fluorescence22, we analyzed the non-
sulfur purple bacteria strains Rba. capsulatus SB1003 and B10S as
well as the SB1003 mutant strain ΔcrtJ carrying a deletion within
the repressor gene involved in O2-mediated inhibition of BChl a
biosynthesis26. Furthermore, we analyzed Rhodospirillium cen-
tenum ATCC 43720. In contrast to the representatives of the
genus Rhodobacter, Rsp. centenum is less well-characterized but is
capable of growing at elevated temperatures up to 42 °C27.
Surprisingly, with exception of Rba. capsulatus B10S and Rsp.
centenum, the chosen strains showed substantial growth at 37 °C
under all tested anaerobic and microaerobic conditions. Photo-
trophic growth in the mixed medium (i.e., a composition of
minimal and complex media) under anaerobic conditions and in
the presence of infrared (IR) light illumination resulted in highest
BChl a absorption per cell (all results of the comparative
cultivation assay are shown in Supplementary Table 1). Under
these conditions, the wild-type SB1003 and ΔcrtJ strains of Rba.
capsulatus exhibited the highest BChl a absorption with a ratio
OD860/660 of 2.15 to 2.48. In agreement with earlier studies23–25,28
we observed that increased O2 availability resulted in reduction of
photopigment synthesis for all Rhodobacter strains. Thus, in
contrast to Rsp. centenum, which consistently exhibited a low
pigment-to-cell ratio under all tested cultivation conditions,
the Rba. capsulatus strains SB1003 and ΔcrtJ as well as Rba.

 sphaeroides showed robust growth at 37 °C together with high
BChl a production favorable for usage in OA experiments.
Rba. absorption spectra and in vitro OA characterization. Next,
we grew Rba. capsulatus SB1003, its ΔcrtJ variant, and Rba.
sphaeroides under the optimal conditions for photopigment for-
mation, i.e. in the absence of oxygen, in mixed medium and with
IR illumination at 37 °C, in order to achieve optimal signal
intensities for subsequent OA analyses. In all cases, characteristic
peaks of cellular BChl a were observed at around 800/850 nm
(Rba. sphaeroides) and 800/860 nm (Rba. capsulatus) (Supple-
mentary Figure 1A, for convenience we name the 850/860 nm
peak exclusively 860 nm throughout the manuscript), and in vitro
OA spectra of the bacteria recorded with MSOT were consistent
with their corresponding optical absorption spectra (Supple-
mentary Figure 1B). In general, the OA signal of a pigment
normalized by its corresponding absorbance is a measure of the
OA signal generation efficiency (photoacoustic signal generation
efficiency, PGE). PGEs normalized to that of a reference solution
of methylene blue, yielding 2.52 in the case of Rba. sphaeroides,
2.18 in the case of Rba. capsulatus SB1003 and 3.04 in the case of
the ΔcrtJ variant are comparable to the PGE of the well-
established OA label melanin (3.36). In comparison to blood, the
raw OA signal at 850 nm of ~2.6 x 106 cells in the imaging
volume (5 µl) equals that of fully oxygenated sheep’s blood. This
is one order of magnitude less cells than would be needed with
melanin producing bacteria12.
OA characterization of Rba. in 4T1 mouse allografts. Next, we
examined the behavior and optoacoustic performance of these
three strains after injection directly into 4T1 mouse mammary
gland breast tumors grafted onto the backs of BALB/c nude mice.
Our goal was to assess how good Rhodobacter can be detected
in the tumor using OA and if the spectral features facilitate
unmixing of the signal from endogenous absorbers in vivo pro-
viding a high signal to noise visualization. In addition, we
examined whether bacterial proliferation could be optoacousti-
cally resolved within the tumor. Therefore, bacteria (1 × 108 cfu)
grown under ideal conditions for BChl a production were injected
into the tumors (n = 3 per strain, Supplementary Table 2 for
information on all mice imaged in this study), followed by con-
secutive days of examination using MSOT. A control mouse was
injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, n = 1).
As a first step for in vivo application, we evaluated whether
components of Rhodobacter cells could have a detrimental
effect on tumor growth, precluding its use as a reporter system.
None, of the bacterial strains significantly altered tumor growth
or mouse body weight suggesting the bacteria exhibit no
immediate anti-tumorigenic effects or systemic toxicity (Supple-
mentary Figure 2). This observation could be further corrobo-
rated by the in vitro cell metabolic activity assay (MTT assay for
colorimetric assessment of cellular NAD(P)H-dependent oxidor-
eductase activities). Here, heat-denatured Rhodobacter cells
showed no negative effects on growth and viability of 4T1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 3).
To
identify
Rhodobacter-specific
signals,
OA
data
were
collected before and at different timepoints after injection into
the tumor and subsequently reconstructed using a model-based
algorithm. Averaged OA spectra of the tumor region clearly show
the characteristic 800-nm and 860-nm peaks as the spectral
signature of the injected bacteria, along with predominant
spectral features reflecting tumor physiology, such as the slope
and peak at 760 nm, which indicates the presence of deoxyhe-
moglobin (Supplementary Figure 4). Interestingly, in tumors,
with all bacterial strains the two-peak signature of the averaged
OA spectra disappeared over time; in the two Rba. capsulatus
strains, the peak at 860 nm was additionally blue-shifted to ~850
nm (Supplementary Figure 4A–I). To examine this phenomenon
more closely, we unmixed the OA data now using an adaptive
match filter and the 850-nm peak (Rba. sphaeroides) and 860-nm
peaks (Rba. capsulatus SB1003 and ΔcrtJ) as target spectra (see
Methods section). This strategy allowed bacterial chlorophyll to
be more faithfully detected even at later timepoints (Fig. 1a–c)
with only a low fraction of possible false positives in the PBS
control (Fig. 1e). Spectral analysis of only the unmixed pixels
makes the abovementioned changes in the spectral signature even
more apparent, pointing clearly to a temporal change in light
absorption at 800 nm in the overall bacterial spectra (Fig. 1f–h).
Furthermore, the unmixed results show relatively constant overall
OA intensity over time with only a slight initial increase
(Fig. 1a–d). The data suggest no strong growth of the bacteria
inside the tumor. After the last timepoint the animals were
sacrificed, tumors cryo-sectioned and preserved for histological
analysis (see below).
Analysis of the changed spectral signature. The observed
spectral shift of BChl a-mediated absorption suggests a change of
photosystem architecture in Rhodobacter cells in response to
processes that exclusively occurred after tumor injection; a
spectral transition can be monitored in vivo by the applied MSOT
approach. Therefore, the spectral shift could be employed to
develop a reporting strategy suitable for analyzing dynamic pro-
cesses in tumors. Consequently, this observation has led us to
further explore the reasons for this spectral shift. First, we could
rule out alterations in endogenous background absorbers because
the spectra of the entire tumor in the PBS-injected control animal
showed no substantial changes between 800 and 860 nm (Sup-
plementary Figure 4O). Moreover, simulating convoluted spectra
of the 800 and 860 nm signature spectra together with spectra of
the major natural absorbers occurring in tumors (e.g., oxygenated
and deoxygenated hemoglobin or lipids) suggest that the spectral
change we observed for bacterial BChl a inside the tumor over
time cannot result from such a convolution, although, tumor
heterogeneity implies that such global spectral interpretations
should be treated with caution (see Supplementary Note 1:
Potential confounders of the spectral signature). Selective pho-
tobleaching of the 800-nm peak could also be excluded since
continuously recorded OA spectra of Rba. capsulatus SB1003 in
an in vitro phantom showed no changes in the peak ratio (Sup-
plementary Figure 5). Furthermore, a second in vivo experiment,
where MSOT was conducted only at the first and last timepoint
to avoid induction of photobleaching effects via repeated BChl a
excitation, showed the same spectral changes as observed for the
initial experiment with repetitive MSOT measurements (Supple-
mentary Figure 6). As a next step we studied whether the spectral
changes could be due to metabolic changes in the bacteria
resulting in a reconfiguration of the photosynthetic machinery29.
To this end, we performed cultivation experiments, where Rho-
dobacter growth conditions were changed in an attempt to par-
tially reflect conditions inside solid tumors (i.e., absence of light,
presence of hydrogen peroxide, acidification, and availability of
nutrients) to induce potential microbial processes that might be
responsible for the tumor-induced shift of BChl a absorption.
However, none of the tested conditions were able to induce
similar spectral effects that have been observed in vivo (Supple-
mentary Figure 7). In addition, we injected Rba. capsulatus
SB1003 that have been inactivated by cell lysis (French press) into
mice bearing 4T1 tumors (n = 3). We likewise observed a similar
spectral change, however, at a much faster rate than utilizing
intact cells (Supplementary Figure 8 for ROI spectra and

 Supplementary Figure 14 for maximum intensity projections).
This suggests that neither an adaptation process of live Rhodo-
bacter cells in response to the tumor environment nor the process
of cell lysis solely caused the observed spectral changes. Subse-
quently, we analyzed if degradation of the photosynthetic mem-
brane—a process that might be initiated when Rhodobacter cells
are inactivated by the immune system—could be causative for
the spectral changes. Therefore, we first recorded the spectral
signature of Rba. capsulatus SB1003 cell extracts where the
photosystem was denatured by prolonged incubation at 95° in
comparison to native (French press) extracts (Supplementary
Figure 9). While the native cell extracts showed the 800 nm/860
nm signature as observed for intact cells indicating undamaged
membranes and photosynthetic complexes, the heat-denatured
samples displayed a distinct 770 nm absorbance indicative of free
BChl a. Ultimately, we analyzed the possibility of phagocytotic
uptake of Rhodobacter by macrophages which are not only
commonly involved in host–pathogen defense, but are also pre-
valent in tumors. To this end we co-incubated Rba. capsulatus
SB1003 cells together with Ana-1 macrophages or 4T1 tumor
cells. Subsequently, the OA spectra of both the mammalian cells
and their corresponding supernatants were recorded separately
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure 10). We could not observe a-
ny spectral information from 4T1 cells indicating no or
only marginal uptake of Rhodobacter. In contrast, a strong
Rhodobacter-mediated MSOT signal was detected in Ana-1
macrophages 24 h and up to 144 h after onset of co-cultivation
showing a spectral shift similar to the one observed in the tumor
experiments and hence indicating that uptake of bacteria by
macrophages is responsible for the spectral conversion. MSOT
spectra of the cell culture media provide mirror images after 24 h
with the classical two peaked spectral signature of live Rhodo-
bacter remaining in the media of 4T1 cells while signal of free-
living Rhodobacter cells is no longer detectable in media of
macrophages. Indeed, microscopic analysis of the cells revealed
that the bacteria are found inside Ana-1 cells (Fig. 2e). Regarding
the intracellular fate of Rhodobacter taken up by macrophages we
found signals of lysosomal marker lamp-1 and signals indicating
ingested Rhodobacter but, surprisingly, observed no significant
colocalization (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Figure 11).
In tissues, analysis of immunohistochemistry of tumors
injected with Rhodobacter SB1003 utilizing anti-macrophage
marker F4/80 shows a clear colocalization of macrophages and
residual fluorescence signal in Cy7 channel from disintegrated
Rhodobacter thereby confirming our in vitro results (Supplemen-
tary Figure 12). The region influenced by Rhodobacter injection
furthermore includes tissue patches positive for cleaved caspase 3
indicating apoptosis in macrophages over time after uptake and
disintegration of Rhodobacter cells. However, with macrophage
viability decreasing only 10–15% within the first 24 h after

 Rhodobacter co-cultivation in vitro (Supplementary Figure 10)
while a strong OA shift is detectable as shown in Fig. 2, we
conclude that macrophage death is not a prerequisite for the
disintegration of Rhodobacter leading to spectral changes.
Our results suggest so far that the temporal change in spectral
signature we observed with intratumoral Rhodobacter reflects an
uptake of the bacterial cells primarily by macrophages via
phagocytosis. Likely, a subsequent disintegration of the bacteria
in macrophages might be accompanied by a substantial release of
BChl a molecules which could finally explain the spectral shift
observed in vivo. However, since BChl a monomers in solution
exhibit an absorption maximum at ~770 nm the red shift may
suggest a spontaneous aggregation of the photopigment upon
macrophagal uptake. In principle, BChl a aggregation can lead to
a red-shifted absorption as observed in vitro (e.g., in solvents with
low ethanol concentrations as shown in Supplementary Fig-
ure 13). In previous in vitro studies, a similar spectral shift of
BChl a is for instance described in n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside
(β-OG)-based micellar systems (λmax ~850 nm30,) or BChl a that
has been covalently linked to 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-
3-phosphatidylcholin (λmax = 824 nm31). The absorption spectra
of BChl a aggregates thus resemble those recorded from
Rhodobacter cells that have been internalized by macrophages
suggesting induction of aggregate formation of BChl a monomers
that might be formed in a micellar or membranous environment.
Spatial analysis of OA spectra. We next explored whether the
changes in the spectral signature occurred uniformly throughout
the tumor or were localized in certain regions. Analysis of spectra of
pixels for which Rhodobacter signals were detected after unmixing
showed that the two peaks at 800 and 860 nm were visible in the
complete tumor immediately after injection. However, over time,
the 800-nm peak selectively and gradually disappeared in the tumor
edge region with the two-peak signature persisting only in the
tumor core (exemplary images Fig. 3 and images of all studied mice
at all timepoints Supplementary Figure 14).
In a next step we elucidated whether the characteristic
spatiotemporal changes can reflect differences between tumor
models. We therefore injected Rba. capsulatus SB1003 cells into
CT26.WT tumors of accordingly xenografted mice (n = 3),
recorded and processed data as described above. Comparison of
pixel derived spectra at equivalent timepoints derived from 4T1-
and CT26.WT mice harboring Rba. capsulatus SB1003 cells show
that the change in the spectral signature is less pronounced in
CT26.WT mice, which might reflect a lower density of tumor-
associated macrophages32 (Figs. 1d, i, 3b as well as Supplementary
Figure 14). Our work thus shows that the spectral signature which
is most probably linked to the uptake and disintegration of
Rhodobacter
by
macrophages
likely
reflects
their
number,
accessibility and activity in the tumor microenvironment.
Spatial analysis of OA spectra in non-tumor tissue. The uptake
and disintegration of Rhodobacter cells in tumor tissue is a slow
process which occurs, depending on the localization, on the scale
of days. We were interested whether in healthy tissue this process
occurs on different timescales. To this end, we injected strongly
vascularized muscle tissue with 1 × 108 cfu Rba. capsulatus SB1003
(n = 2). Consistent with the expected uptake by blood circulating
macrophages the spectral changes occurred faster (Fig. 3c as well
as Supplementary Figure 14). Thus, the unique spectral shift
Rhodobacter shows upon internalization by macrophages can
also be used as a marker of macrophage presence and activity in
other tissues, e.g. in the context of studying infection.
Discussion
We could demonstrate that BChl a accumulating purple bacteria
can serve as label for OA imaging exhibiting outstanding spectral
characteristics. In addition, we provide preliminary evidence that
the characteristic two-peak BChl a spectra together with the
spatiotemporal changes of the spectral shape depend on macro-
phage uptake and action. These properties can be used, e.g. in the
case of tumors, to report macrophage accessibility in the tumor
microenvironments. The strength of the BChl a OA signal (per
unit of absorption) is comparable to that of the well-characterized
strong absorber melanin. Moreover, the two BChl a peaks at 800
and 860 nm provide an excellent target spectrum for unmixing

 and allow the study of regional effects inside the tumor with high
resolution. Remarkably, we found reproducible (n = 3) spatio-
temporal variation of the spectral pattern depending on the
strain, the tumor model and the localization within the tumor at
different times after injection. We believe that the basis for this
shift is the phagocytosis and disintegration of the bacteria by
macrophages and subsequent aggregation of the released BChl a.
Our results clearly link the change of the spectral signature to
macrophage activity in different regions of the tissue, which is an
important contribution to understanding the tumor micro-
environment and the spatially and temporally diverse plasticity,
activity and overall functionality of macrophages33, especially,
since M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are critical
for shaping this microenvironment34. Moreover, the functionality
of macrophages in respect to their phagocytotic activity is linked
to the situation in the tumor or to therapeutic intervention—e.g.,
data suggest that Bevacizumab might inhibit phagocytotic activity
of TAMs35. Presently, detailed in vivo insight into macrophage
function has been obtained by intravital microscopy (IVM),
however, the limited field-of-view of IVM precludes a compre-
hensive view on the whole tumor elucidating macrophage activity
on the level of the tumor microenvironment. Whole animal
imaging of macrophages inside the tumor has been shown with
optoacoustics before36 lacking however the visualization of
activity which is provided by using Rhodobacter as a reporter
agent. The present work therefore provides a starting point for
applying OA imaging and Rhodobacter strains as reporters for
studying the pathophysiological role of macrophages in pre-
clinical cancer research and can help to develop strategies for
bacterial tumor therapy.
Our results further show a dependence of the spatiotemporal
pattern on the employed Rhodobacter strain suggesting an effect
of variable cell envelope components such as EPS on the time
course of bacterial cell lysis inside macrophages. EPS are con-
stituents of the bacterial capsule layer surrounding most strains
of Rba. capsulatus37. In initial studies, however, it could

automatic peak assignment failed. Strong signal (white) in the reconstructed images at 720 nm relates to high absorption by blood or other absorber that
has not been identified by the unmixing procedure. Data for all mice at all timepoints can be found in Supplementary Figure 14 (a n = 3, b n = 3, c n = 2).

 be demonstrated that the composition and relative amount of
the capsule seem to be strain-specific38, and that the formation of
capsule polysaccharides in Rhodobacter depends on the cultiva-
tion conditions, growth phase and the intrinsic quorum sensing
system39. However, in contrast to free-living bacteria such as
Rhodobacter, where EPS is mainly involved in protecting the cells
against environmental threats, bacterial capsules can also have an
important role as virulence factors during the infection process of
human pathogens. On the other hand, EPS can also negatively
affect intramacrophage survival and cell division as, for example,
recently reported for Salmonella40. Therefore, the here described
reporter properties of different Rhodobacter strains might also be
considered as a sensor tool to elucidate the effect of different cell
envelope components on the immune response and/or survival
inside phagocytic cells using MSOT.
Finally, the identification of macrophages as promising ther-
apeutic targets for chronical inflammatory and metastatic diseases
further underpins the requirement for bacterial agents allowing to
selectively deliver therapeutic molecules to phagocytic cells at
injured or diseased sites and, at the same time, enabling the
visualization of the drug release process. In this context, Rhodo-
bacter species also offer promising properties that make them
attractive candidates as therapeutic platforms. In contrast to most
other Gram-negative bacteria, Rba. sphaeroides and Rba. capsu-
latus synthesize non-toxic, non-pyrogenic lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) that potently antagonize endotoxin-induced inflamma-
tion41–43. Thus, Rhodobacter cells may not induce deleterious
effects per se. Furthermore, Rhodobacter can be engineered as
gene therapy vectors or to produce secondary metabolites exhi-
biting anti-cancer activities. For example, the intrinsically high
accumulation of pyrrole and isoprenoid scaffolds are a good
starting point to utilize this group of photosynthetic bacteria for
the production of chlorophylls applicable for photodynamic
therapy, or terpenoids such as β-elemene, that have recently been
shown to target TAMs in cancer treatment44–47. To further
extend the applicability of Rhodobacter as platform organisms for
theranostic research, a diverse set of genetic tools has already
been developed allowing easy genetic manipulation. For instance,
DNA vectors and integrative cassettes have been constructed for
transplanting complete drug pathways into Rba. capsulatus and
Rba. sphaeroides47–50.
In summary, Rhodobacter species offer multiple properties
making them promising candidates for preclinical studies of
tumor heterogeneity. Our results now demonstrate the usefulness
of this class of photosynthetic bacteria by showing that their BChl
a can be very effectively identified via MSOT and that changes in
their unique spectral signature are a function of macrophage
activity, which can provide insights into tumor biology in vivo.
The broad biosynthetic capability together with the here descri-
bed reporter properties finally make phototrophic purple bacteria
a truly versatile smart micro-packaging system which can help to
facilitate the delivery of DNA and active substances into (tumor-
associated) macrophages and simultaneously allows MSOT-based
in vivo monitoring of drug release in the near future.
Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions. All strains used in this study were either
grown at anaerobic or microaerobic conditions in different minimal media (RCV37
with 15 mM ammonia) for Rba. capulatus, SISTROM51 for Rba. sphaeroides and
CENMED52,53 for Rsp. centenum or in complex media PY54 for Rba. capsulatus.
In addition, a mixture of complex PY medium and RCV medium55 was used for
cultivation that was proven to facilitate BChl a biosynthesis in Rba. capsulatus
at 30 °C.
For strain maintenance, the Rba. capsulatus wild-type strain B10S (a
spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant of the original isolate B10)56, the
rifampicin-resistant Rba. capsulatus wild-type strain SB100357 and the
recombinant mutant strain Rba. capsulatus ΔcrtJ (Troost, Loeschcke and Drepper
unpublished) were cultivated on 2% (w/v) agar (Bacto agar, Difco) containing PY
plates supplemented with 200 µg ml−1 streptomycin for B10S, 25 µg ml−1
rifampicin for SB1003 or 25 µg ml−1 rifampicin and 10 µg ml−1 spectinomycin for
the SB1003/ΔcrtJ at 30 °C. The Rba. sphaeroides wild-type strain ATH 2.4.158 and
Rsp. centenum strain ATCC 4372052 were cultivated at 30 °C without antibiotics
either on PY or CENMED plates containing 2 % (w/v) agar.
Microaerobic (chemotrophic) cultivation of all strains was carried out in
Erlenmeyer flasks under permanent shaking (0.57×g) in the dark at 37 °C using
50 ml of the above described media without antibiotics. For anaerobic (i.e.,
phototrophic) cultivation at 37 °C capped air-tight 15-ml reaction tubes were
filled with 15 ml of the respective cultivation media without antibiotics to create
an oxygen-free atmosphere. For phototrophic growth, different light sources
were used emitting either full spectrum light (light bulbs) as well as defined blue
(λmax = 450 nm) and/or infrared (λmax = 850 nm) light. Bulb illumination arrays
consist of two panels with three light bulbs (60 W, Osram, Germany) on each
panel. LED illumination arrays consist of two LED panels with 120 blue LEDs
(NSSB100BT, Nichia, Japan) and 120 high power infrared LEDs (SFH 4257,
Osram, Germany) on each panel. Spectral irradiance data are published in ref. 55.
Cell cultures were placed in 13 cm distance to each light panel.
For the analysis of pigment formation, strains were first cultivated in
appropriate minimal media (RCV, SISTROM or CENMED) for three days under
microaerobic or phototrophic conditions. These pre-cultures were used to
inoculate corresponding test cultures in (i) minimal medium (RCV, SISTROM or
CENMED), (ii) complex PY medium and (iii) a mixture of complex PY and
minimal RCV medium, starting with a cell density of OD660 nm = 0.05. The test
cultures were cultivated at growth conditions outlined above. After 24 h, cell
densities were monitored at 660 nm and BChl a accumulation was determined in
whole cells by measuring the in vivo absorption at 860 nm spectrometrically
(Genesys 6; Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany). On the basis
of this data, BChl a synthesis per cell could be calculated.
For lysed samples, Rba. capsulatus was pre-cultivated under anaerobic
phototrophic conditions under IR light in RCV medium for 3 days. These cells
were used to inoculate ten cultures in hungate tubes with RCV 2/3 PY medium in
parallel with a starting cell density of OD660 nm = 0.05. After 24 h of cultivation
under IR light, cell material corresponding to OD660 nm = 400 was pelleted and re-
suspended in 20 ml PBS, and subjected to disruption in a French Press apparatus
(500 bar). The cell suspension was passed through the apparatus eight times to
ensure complete lysis, which was confirmed by plating samples on agar plates (i.e.,
no colony formation). A 5 µl-sample, corresponding to 1 × 108 lysed cells, was used
for injection.
Cell culture. The mouse mammary tumor cell line 4T1 (CRL-2539; American
Type Cell Culture Collection, Manassas VA), the mouse colon carcinoma line
CT26.WT (CRL-2638) and the macrophage line Ana-1 (kind gift from Heiko
Adler, Lung Infection & Repair, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich), were grown in 5%
CO2 at 37 °C in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Routine culture treatment
was conducted twice a week. Used cell lines are regularly checked for mycoplasma
contamination and authenticity.
Cell viability assay. 4T1 cells were inoculated in 96-well plates at 2.5 × 103 cells
per well in a final volume of 100 µl. After overnight incubation for cell adhesion,
the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 100 µl of
medium containing either 3 × 103 or 3 × 104 cfu heat inactivated (99 °C or 72 °C for
5 min) bacteria; arguing that a tumor of average weight of 0.3 g contains 3 × 108
cells with a bacterial colonization of 1 × 108 cfu this would make 0.3 bacteria per
tumor cell; we adjusted the cells in the cell viability assay (Cell Proliferation Kit 1
(MTT), Roche) accordingly. 10% DMSO was used as positive (inducing cell death)
and PBS as negative control (no influence on viability). After 24 h of incubation,
the medium containing the heat inactivated Rhodobacter cells were removed and
fresh medium was added. Cell viability was determined by a colorimetric MTT
assay used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance measure-
ments were conducted at 595 nm. For reference absorbance of the untreated PBS
control was regarded as 100% and all data normalized accordingly.
Mouse work. All animal experiments were approved by the government of Upper
Bavaria and were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.
For tumor xenografts 0.8 × 106 4T1 or CT26.WT cells in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) have been implanted in the back of Balb c nude mice (Charles River
Laboratories, Boston, US) just below the kidney. Mice remained in the animal care
facility for several days until the tumors reached a size of 100 mm3 (see
Supplementary Figure 2). For MSOT imaging mice have been anaesthetized using
2% Isofluran in O2. Anaesthetized mice were place in the MSOT holder using
ultrasound gel and water as coupling media. The tumor region was imaged from
700 nm to 900 nm with 10 nm step size to cover the spectra of the agent. For
bacteria injection 5 µl PBS with 1 × 108 cfu have been injected from the top directly
in the tumor using a 10 µl Hamilton Syringe (gauge 26 s).
After termination of the experiments all mice have been sacrificed and stored
at −80 °C for cryosectioning.

 MSOT data acquisition, reconstruction, and unmixing. All MSOT data have
been recorded using the MSOT inVision 256 (iThera Medical GmbH, Kreiling,
Germany).
MSOT spectra between 700 and 900 nm of bacterial suspensions have been
recorded using clear plastic syringes together with an equally prepared black indian
ink reference. For reconstructions, the ViewMSOT software was used with a field-
of-view (FOV) of 250 × 250 pixel with a pixel resolution of 200 × 200 μm. Images
have been reconstructed using the model linear approach as described in ref. 59 and
filtering the data for the range between 0.05 and 7 MHz. Mean MSOT intensities
were directly extracted from region of interests (ROI) covering the syringe
diameter. For spectral analysis of Ana-1 or 4T1 cells incubated with Rhodobacter
SB1003 for different timepoints, total mammalian cells were separated from total
Rhodobacter that has not been endocytosed and recorded using syringes as
described above. Mean MSOT intensities for each sample were directly extracted
from six different ROI covering the syringe diameter.
To calculate the PGE we measured three concentrations per strain and plotted
the OA signal intensities vs. absorption of the scattering corrected absorption
spectra at peak wavelength (850 nm for Rba. spheroides and 860 nm for Rba.
capsulatus SB1003 and ΔcrtJ, respectively). To correct for background signals of the
OA measurements the calculated intercept of the linear fit was substrate from each
OA signal yielding a linear fit through zero and through all data points. The
calculated slope of this fit represents the conversion of absorbed photons to OA
signal for the given solution. We referenced all values to a reference slope with 2.6,
5.2, and 7.8 μM solutions of methylene blue.
Mouse MSOT data between 680 and 960 nm have been recorded in 13 (early
tumor) to 34 slices (late tumor development) with 0.5 mm spacing covering the
tumor region. Details of MSOT recording are described elsewhere60. The field-of-
view (FOV) was 200 × 200 pixel with a pixel resolution of 100 × 100 μm. Images
have been reconstructed using a model-based approach as described in59 and
filtering the data for the range between 0.1 and 7 MHz. Speed of sound was
regularly set to 1530 m/s and a regularization parameter was used with 106. A ROI
covering the mouse body was selected for overall data analysis (body-ROI), as well
as an ROI for specific analysis of signals from the tumor region (tumor-ROI). To
obtain the accumulative spectra over the tumor the intensities of all pixels in the
tumor-ROI over all slices were summed for each wavelength.
Unmixing for the range of 700 to 900 nm was performed essentially as
described in ref. 61. Target spectra used for unmixing are indicated with the data.
For the accumulative quantification of the unmixed OA signal OA intensities of the
unmixed images are summed over all positively unmixed pixels in the tumor-ROI.
For the spectral analysis the spectra at each pixel have been analyzed for their
peaks using Matlab. For spectra where the 800 nm peak only occurs as a shoulder
the contribution was assessed by using the ratio of the main peak at ~860 nm to the
spectral position where the 800 nm peak can be assumed (i.e., 800 nm). Unmixed
pixel where automated peak assignment failed have been omitted.
Cryosectioning with fluorescence imaging. After sacrificing by cervical disloca-
tion, the mice were cryopreserved at −80 °C. To detect BChl a-mediated fluores-
cence in tumors as shown in Supplementary Figure 12, 250 μm sections were
cut (Leica CM1950, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar Germany) and imaged using a
740/40 nm bandpass for excitation and 850 nm longpass filter for detection. Images
were taken using an Andor LucaR CCD camera (DL-604M, Andor Technology,
Belfast, UK) with 10 s exposure and a gain of 40.
Immunofluorescence, histochemistry, and microscopy. For immuno-
fluorescence (IF), Ana-1 macrophages were grown on poly-L-lysine coated cover-
slips following addition of Rhodobacter SB1003 at a ratio of 50:1 (Ana-1:Rba) for
24 h. Coverslips were briefly washed with pre-warmed PBS, fixed for 7 min in 4%
pre-warmed paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by IF staining as described
earlier62. The primary polyclonal rabbit antibody to Lamp-1 (Lysosome marker,
Abcam, #24170, diluted 1:500) was paired with the secondary antibody Alexa 405
anti-rabbit.
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of frozen tissue sections (10 µm) the
protocol was altered the following: Sections stored at −80 °C were transferred to
room temperature, equilibrated for 30 min and fixed for 10 min with Acetone.
The primary rat monoclonal antibody recognizing the mouse F4/80 antigen
(Macrophage-specific marker, Abcam, #6640, 1:500) and the polyclonal rabbit
antibody against Cleaved Caspase 3 (Merck Millipore, AB3623, 1:300) were
combined with anti-rat and anti-rabbit peroxidase/HRP conjugated antibodies at
standard dilutions, respectively, followed by DAB detection (Roth 9202.1). H&E
staining was performed according to standard protocol.
Microscopic images showing IF with anti-Lamp-1 were collected with the Zeiss
Axio Imager M2 using the AxioCam MRm camera and the Plan Apochromat
100×/1.4 oil objective to record Z-stacks with 250 nm step size. The Zeiss Zen
software was used for image processing and deconvolution at default (constrained
iterative method) was applied. Images shown in Fig. 2f and Supplementary
Figure 11 are grouped Z-projections of maximum intensity. Brightfield IHC images
were recorded with the AxioColor camera and the EC Plan Neofluar 2.5×/0.085
and 40×/0.75 Ph2 objectives. Tiling of the entire tumor was executed using the
10×/0.3 Ph1 objective, the AxioCam MRm camera and filter settings for Dapi and
Cy7. The following filtersets have been used for fixated samples (Zeiss): DAPI
(FilterNr. 49) Ex: 335–383 nm Em: 420–470 nm, HE Red (FilterNr. 63 = mCherry):
Ex: 559–585 nm Em: 600–690 nm and Cy7: Ex: 673–748 nm Em: 765–855 nm.
