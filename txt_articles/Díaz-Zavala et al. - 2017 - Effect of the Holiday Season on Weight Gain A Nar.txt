Several studies suggest that the holiday season, starting from the last week of November to the first or second week of January,
could be critical to gaining weight. This study aims to review the literature to determine the effects of the holidays on body weight.
In studies of adults, a significant weight gain was consistently observed during this period (0.4 to 0.9 kg, ùëù < 0.05). The only study
in college students found an effect on body fat but not on weight (0.1 kg, ùëù = 0.71). The only study found in children did not show
an effect on BMI percentile (‚àí0.4%, ùëù > 0.05) during this period. Among individuals with obesity who attempt to lose weight, an
increase in weight was observed (0.3 to 0.9 kg, significant in some but not in all studies), as well as increase in weight in motivated
self-monitoring people (0.4 to 0.6%, ùëù < 0.001). Programs focused on self-monitoring during the holidays (phone calls and daily
mailing) appeared to prevent weight gain, but information is limited. The holiday season seems to increase body weight in adults,
even in participants seeking to lose weight and in motivated self-monitoring people, whereas in children, adolescents, and college
students, very few studies were found to make accurate conclusions.
1. Introduction
Obesity is one of the most important health problems
worldwide, making research on its causes a priority [1, 2].
Interest in the causes and prevention of obesity has
increased due to the difficulty of treatment. Intensive lifestyle
change programs, which are considered the gold standard,
reduce weight by around 8‚Äì10% in one year [3], resulting
in multiple benefits to health [4]. Nevertheless, weight loss
over the long term (‚âà10 years) was 6% [3, 4], which means
that the results are not completely maintained. In the case
of pharmacotherapy, results for FDA-approved drugs ranged
from 5.4 to 9.8% in one year [5], but long-term evaluations
(>2 years) are lacking [6]. It has been assumed that the most
efficient long-term treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery
[7, 8], although this surgery is limited to more severe states
(body mass index [BMI] > 40 or 35 with comorbidities)
[8, 9]. In spite of how promising these procedures are, a
recent systematic review of randomized controlled clinical
trials has shown that there are few studies with this kind
of design, that they have small sample sizes, that there is a
possibility of adverse events following surgery, and that there
is a lack of long-term evaluations (>2 years of follow-up)
[10].
Further, once an individual achieves a weight loss, various
neuroendocrine, metabolic, and behavioral mechanisms are
set in motion to counteract the loss of weight [11, 12], in
addition to the obstacles of having a healthy lifestyle in an
obesogenic environment. Thus, it is necessary to consider
prevention as the best strategy to fight obesity.
It is recommended that preventive interventions for
obesity should aim to modify the environment and food
system, as well as behavior-change communication through
policy and regulation [13]. However, these actions do not
consider specific periods in the year, such as the holiday
season. This season, usually from the last week of November

to the first or second week of January, could be a risky
period for weight gain and obesity [14]. During this time,
people from different countries attend religious and cultural
celebrations such as Christmas and New Year, among other
social gatherings. Special meals and high-energy dense foods
are prepared in this period: desserts, candies, sugary drinks,
or alcohol. There is also evidence of a decrease in physical
activity at this time [15, 16].
Sixteen years ago an article published by Yanovski and
colleagues showed that a nonrepresentative sample of 195
adults gained an average of 0.37 kg during the holiday season
[14]. The researchers found that weight gain during this
period is not subsequently lost in a year and represents more
than 50% of the weight gained throughout the year [14].
Additionally, other studies have suggested that this period
could be critical in weight gain, mainly in adults. This study
aimed to review the evidence on the effect of the holidays on
body weight.
2. Methods
This is a narrative (not systematic) review of the topic that
highlights some of the main findings in the area and discusses
potential areas for further research. A search was conducted
in PubMed and other databases, using the keywords ‚Äúhol-
iday/holidays‚Äù and ‚Äúweight gain/obesity.‚Äù The search was
limited to studies published in English and Spanish without
specifying limits on dates, study design, or the age of the
participants.
The exposure of interest is defined as the holiday season,
typically starting from the last week of November to the first
or second week of January. To be selected, studies had to
include at least one measurement of weight or BMI before and
after the holiday season.
Once the articles were identified, some data were
extracted and checked. Information extracted from the
selected studies included author, year, and country of study;
number of participants; date of measurements; sample selec-
tion, retention of subjects, and masking of participants;
and change in weight or BMI. We did not undertake a
formal quality assessment but do consider the important
methodological characteristics when interpreting the results.
Results are reported narratively. Finally, we reviewed some
relevant articles related to the effect of other festive periods
on body weight and the possible causes of weight gain during
these periods for discussion purposes only.
3. Results
Fifteen publications were included [14, 17‚Äì30], six were in the
adult population [14, 18, 21‚Äì24], six were in adults seeking
to lose weight [17, 19, 25, 28‚Äì30], one in motivated self-
monitoring people [20], one in college students [27], and
one in children [26]. All of the studies were conducted in
the northern hemisphere. A summary of the results of the
effects of the holiday season on body weight in adults is
shown in Table 1; the results of the studies with adults who
were seeking to lose weight or motivated self-monitoring
people are shown in Table 2, while Table 3 shows the results
in college students and children. No studies were found
in adolescents. The following are the results of the studies
described chronologically by population group.
3.1. Studies in Adults. In 1985, Rees et al. reported the effects
of the holidays on body weight and biochemical parameters
in a small group of healthy subjects (ùëõ = 22) and another
with type 2 diabetes (ùëõ = 13) [21]. Volunteers were measured
five times (December 10, 22, and 29 and January 5 and 22).
From baseline, all subjects significantly gained an average of
0.8 kg. Subjects with diabetes gained 0.7 kg despite being on a
diet or medication, while healthy participants gained 0.9 kg.
There was a healthy woman who gained 4.3 kg. The highest
weight gain was observed from December 22 to 29 and was
maintained until the last measurement. A significant increase
in glycated hemoglobin (+0.7% healthy group, +1.1% diabetes
group), total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin,
and triglycerides in the study period was also observed,
suggesting an increase in dietary energy intake. It is worth
mentioning that participants were laboratory technicians,
paramedics, nurses, doctors, or friends of those mentioned.
Subjects with diabetes had an exemplary record in their
glycemic control [21].
In 1999, Reid and Hackett assessed the effect of the
holidays on body weight in 26 healthy volunteers between
17 and 59 years of age with an average BMI of 20.5 kg/m2.
The initial measurement was recorded from December 18th
to 21th and the final was around January 4th. A significant
average increase of 0.9 kg was observed in this short period
(around 15 days) [22].
In 2000, Yanovski et al. evaluated 195 adults before and
after the holiday season (last week of November to mid-
January) and participants showed an increase in their weight
of 0.37 kg during this short period of 6 weeks [14]. For the
165 subjects who returned for the one-year measurement, it
was found that the weight gained during the holiday period
was not subsequently lost. The subjects increased 0.62 kg over
the course of a year, so the increase in the holiday season
(0.32 kg in this group) represented about 50% of the weight
gained in all the year [14]. However, a convenience sample
was used; thus it is not representative of the general popu-
lation.
In 2012, Wagner et al. studied the effects of the holidays
on weight and body composition in 13 men and 21 women
aged between 23 and 61 years [24]. The initial measurement
was taken in mid-November, while the second was taken in
early January. Although the participants perceived that they
had gained weight, no significant changes were observed in
weight before and after the holiday period (74.0 kg versus
73.9 kg, difference ‚àí0.1 kg, ùëù = 0.87) nor in body fat (25.4%
versus 25.4%, difference 0.0%, ùëù = 0.97) [24].
Also in 2012, a secondary analysis of a study originally
conducted to determine the error rate of dietary self-report
questionnaires against total energy expenditure measured
with doubly labeled water was published by Cook and
colleagues [18]. In this study, 443 men and women aged 40
to 69 years and with an average BMI of 27 kg/m2 for women

and 28 kg/m2 for men were measured. Initial measurements
were conducted in the period from mid-September to mid-
October and the final measurement from mid-January to
early March. It was observed that participants significantly
increased their weight (average 0.8 kg) during the study
period [18].
In 2013, Stevenson et al. conducted a study with 148
participants to assess if exercise performed regularly during
the Christmas period had an effect on body weight [23]. The
initial assessment was made in mid-November and the final
assessment in mid-January. Measurements included body
weight, fat percentage, blood pressure, and self-reported exer-
cise. Participants gained 0.78 kg (ùëù < 0.001) and increased
their fat percentage by 0.5% (ùëù = 0.007). It should be noted
that obese subjects showed a greater increase in fat percentage
compared to normal weight subjects (1.6% versus 0.2%, resp.,
ùëù < 0.05), but no difference was noted in body weight
compared to normal weight subjects. Regular self-reported
exercise was not shown to be a protective factor against
weight gain during this period and was not a significant
predictor of change in body weight or body fat percentage
[23].
3.2. Studies in Adults with Obesity Who Attempt to Lose Weight
or Motivated Self-Monitoring People. The negative effect of
the holidays on body weight also seems to be observed in
patients seeking to lose weight.
Andersson and R¬®
ossner, in 1992 conducted a study that
included 46 patients with obesity participating in a main-
tenance therapy program at the obesity unit of a hospital
in Sweden. These patients self-reported their weight weekly
in individual charts where the information of the period of
the holidays was obtained (before Christmas to mid-January,
three-week period). In addition, a control group of subjects
from the hospital staff were included. They were invited to
record their weight during the same period. Patients with
obesity had a nonsignificant increase of 0.6 ¬± 2.4 kg, whereas
controls had an increase of 0.4 ¬± 0.8 kg (ùëù < 0.001) in the
3-week period [28].
In 1999, Boutelle et al. evaluated an intervention to
increase consistency of self-monitoring via mailings and
phone calls during the period of the holiday season [17].
Fifty-seven subjects who participated in a long-term cogni-
tive behavioral program that included self-monitoring were
randomly assigned to increase consistency of self-monitoring
during the holiday season or to a control group. Measure-
ments were taken from the beginning of December until the
end of January. The intervention group had a greater self-
monitoring and achieved a better control of body weight
compared to the control group (‚àí0.9 kg versus 0.9 kg, ùëù =
0.007), during the 8 weeks of intervention [17]. A previous
study by Baker and Kirschenbaum showed that individuals
participating (50 weeks) in a behavioral intervention had a
mean weight loss of 12 kg but increased 500% more weight per
week during holidays in comparison with nonholiday weeks.
Also, only individuals in the high quartile of self-monitoring
were able to successfully lose weight during this period [31].
In 2007, Watras et al. reported the weight change dur-
ing the holiday season of individuals who participated in
a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study that
evaluated the effect of conjugated linoleic acid on fat loss for
6 months. The investigators observed that individuals in the
 Journal of Obesity
9
conjugated linoleic acid group reduced their weight by 0.1 kg,
whereas those in the placebo group increased their weight by
0.6 kg during this season (ùëù < 0.05) [25].
In 2007, Squires described the experience from the Lean
Plate Challenge [30]. This program provided support for
participants to maintain their weight from Thanksgiving to
New Year. The subjects recorded their weight and received
information about the challenge and goals on diet and phys-
ical activity. They also received support at their workplace
(cafeterias agreed to make reduced calorie meals during the
period of the challenge) and other incentives when they fin-
ished the challenge (a t-shirt and one ticket to participate in a
drawing to win a mountain bike). The number of participants
that were able to finish the challenge was 217 (from 290) and
a little more than 60% achieved the maintenance goal, with
an average loss of 1.0 kg (significance not reported) [30].
In 2008, Phelan and colleagues evaluated the effect of the
holiday period in a group of successful weight losers from
the National Weight Control Registry [29]. This group had
a mean weight loss of 34.9 kg and had maintained >13 kg for
almost 6 years. In addition, researchers evaluated a group of
subjects with normal weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2) with
no history of obesity. Both groups increased body weight in
the holiday period (0.7 kg versus 0.2 kg) with no significant
differences between them. However, more successful weight
losers gained more than 1 kg, compared to the normal weight
group (39% versus 17%) during the holiday period [29].
A study in Spain, by Garc¬¥
ƒ±a et al., showed that 215 patients
participating in a clinical treatment for obesity gained 0.29 kg
weight at Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Eve (25 December to 5
January) even when they were prescribed to eat a hypocaloric
diet (restriction of 500‚Äì600 kcal/day) [19].
In 2016, Helander et al. reported weight changes through-
out the year in 2924 Withings weight scale users from 3 devel-
oped countries (Unites States [US], Germany, and Japan);
participants also created an online account to monitor their
weight. The users‚Äô weight increased significantly between 10
days before Christmas and 10 days after Christmas (US 0.4%
increase in weight, ùëù < 0.001; Japan 0.5%, ùëù = 0.005; and
Germany 0.6%, ùëù < 0.001). A significant increase was also
observed in weight on other national holidays compared to
preholiday weight: Japan during Golden Week (0.3%, ùëù <
0.001), Germany over Easter holidays (0.2%, ùëù < 0.001),
and the US during Thanksgiving (0.2%, ùëù < 0.001). Half of
the weight gained during the Christmas holidays was quickly
lost and participants in the three countries lost weight during
the year of study. The individuals reported an average of
147.5 to 181.6 weigh-ins over the year, suggesting that these
groups represent actively self-monitoring people, rather than
the general population. Despite being a group of highly
motivated individuals (as seen by the number of weigh-ins
and amount of weight loss), the effect of the holiday periods
on body weight was marked [20].
3.3. Studies in College Students. In 2006, Hull et al. studied
a convenience sample of 94 young people attending college
with an average age of 23 years (Table 3). A weight gain of
0.5 kg, 13 days after the Thanksgiving day period (last week of
November) was observed [32]. However, the weight gained
during this period was quickly lost at the next measure from
January 9 to 20. No difference was found between the initial
weight and final weight in January (71.3 kg versus 71.2 kg,
difference ‚àí0.1 kg, ùëù = 0.71). However, there was a significant
increase in the percentage of body fat measured by dual X-ray
absorptiometry (25.9 versus 27.0, ùëù < 0.05) [27].
3.4. Studies in Children. In 2010, Branscum et al. studied the
effect of the holidays on obesity parameters in 90 children
from a public elementary school in the United States. The
study included two measurements: one in early December
(before the holiday period) and one in early to mid-January
(at the return to classes). During this time the children
gained 0.56 kg and increased their BMI by 0.28 kg/m2 but
an increase in height of 0.82 cm was also observed. Thus,
on average, there was no change in BMI percentile (‚àí0.4%,
ùëù > 0.05). It was noted that children with overweight and
obesity increased their body mass index percentile and BMI
and weigh more than children with normal weight [26].
4. Discussion
Adult studies consistently showed an increase in body weight
during the holiday period, with the exception of one study
[24] with very few participants in which there was no increase
(‚àí0.1 kg). One study found an increase of 0.37 kg [14], and
another four studies showed an increase between 0.58 to
0.9 kg [18, 21‚Äì23]. Results are similar to those reported in a
review of the literature by Schoeller in 2014 that found an
increase in weight of around 0.5 kg [33]. Our work is different
from the Schoeller review because we have also included
studies of populations seeking to lose weight and from a wider
variety of countries. Additionally, we discuss studies that
assessed the effect of other festive periods on body weight (see
next section). In contrast to adult populations, no increase in
weight was found in the college population (one study) but
there was a significant increase in body fat [27]. In the case of
children, one study showed no effect of the holiday period on
BMI percentile (‚àí0.4%, ùëù > 0.05) [26]. Individuals seeking
to lose weight showed a mean increase from 0.3 kg to 0.9 kg
(significant in some but not in all studies). Finally, motivated
self-monitoring people from three countries also significantly
increased their body weight. It should also be noted that, in
general, participants who are overweight or obese gain more
weight than those of normal weight [14, 23, 26, 27, 34], which
should be considered in the planning of preventive measures.
The reported results derive mainly from the US, England,
and other developed countries and may not be generalizable
to other countries due to different factors that might influence
diet and physical activity in the holiday period. For example,
in M¬¥
exico workers receive a higher income (at least 15 to
50 days‚Äô salary) during December, which would allow more
food purchases. There are also differences in religious and
cultural festivities, and environmental, socioeconomic, and
climatic factors can be markedly different. However, it is
worth noting that studies that included samples from other
countries outside of the US and England (i.e., Germany,
 10
Journal of Obesity
Japan, Sweden, and Spain) also showed that participants
gained weight in the holiday season [19, 20, 28].
4.1. Effect of Other Festive Periods on Body Weight. Recently,
Cooper and Tokar showed that other holiday periods (from
one to three weeks away from the place of residence) between
March and August also increased body weight and this was
maintained 6 weeks later [35]. Also, the length of vacation had
a direct relationship with increasing weight [35]. These results
were observed even though individuals reported increased
total physical activity during the holiday period, suggesting
that the cause is the increased intake of dietary energy [35].
Hourdakis et al., meanwhile, assessed the effect of the Greek
Orthodox Easter holidays in a sample of 138 college students
[34]. The results showed an increase of 1.5 to 1.7 kg (ùëù < 0.001)
in men and women, respectively [34]. Payab et al. ascertained
the effects of the Persian New Year Festival ‚ÄúNorouz,‚Äù which
takes place at the beginning of spring [36]. Sixty-six subjects,
aged 21‚Äì68 years participated in anthropometric measure-
ments in mid-March and April (approximately 45 days apart).
A significant increase in weight of 0.58 kg (ùëù < 0.001) was
observed [36].
In relation to studies in children, Cristi-Montero et al.
evaluated the effect of two vacation periods (national and
winter) on some parameters of obesity in Chilean schoolchil-
dren, age 10 to 14 years, with medium socioeconomic status
[37]. For the national holidays (9 days of September) 147
schoolchildren participated and for the winter holidays (16
days of July) 216 schoolchildren participated. Weight (kg) and
fat (percentage, estimated from skinfolds) gained during the
national holiday were 0.6 kg, ùëù < 0.001, and 0.51%, ùëù =
0.0013, respectively, with no change in waist circumference.
Concomitantly, a reduction in self-reported physical activity
and an increase in self-reported sleeping time were observed.
In the winter holidays schoolchildren gained weight (0.51 kg,
ùëù < 0.001), fat (0.51%, ùëù < 0.001), and increased waist
circumference (0.65 cm, ùëù < 0.001), simultaneous with an
increase in the self-reporting of their sleeping time, with
no change in physical activity reported [37]. In this study
the authors did not measure or account for any change in
height during the study period that could be related to weight
change. However, the authors argued that they had carried
out a pilot study to estimate the weight change during a
‚Äúnormal‚Äù week in a random sample of 216 students of the
same age, finding that there was no change in body weight
(0.04 kg, ùëù = 0.12) [37].
Finally, Baranowski et al. conducted a narrative review
of differences in weight gain (BMI ùëç score, obesity, or other
parameters) between the school year and summer holidays
in children. The common pattern in six longitudinal studies
was that children with overweight and obesity had accelerated
weight gain during the summer, while normal weight chil-
dren gained less or did not gain weight [38]. Four intervention
studies were included (three fitness interventions [39‚Äì41]
and one behavioral weight loss program [42]) where they
found the benefits from fitness parameters were lost during
summer. Franckle et al., in their systematic review of the
literature, also found accelerated weight gain is observed
during summer, especially in Afro-American, Hispanics,
and overweight children and adolescents [43]. Additionally,
Zinkel et al. did not find any significant change in total
energy expenditure (adjusted for fat-free mass) and physical
activity level over summer versus in school months among
children from the United States using the doubly labeled
water method. This suggests that the reason for the weight
gain during summer is not necessarily related to differences
in energy expenditure [44].
4.2. Possible Causes of Weight Gain during the Holiday Period.
The causes that could explain a weight gain during the holiday
period are diverse. Typically, at this time people have a more
carefree lifestyle, special meals at parties are prepared, and
social gatherings can be more frequent, which exposes them
to situations that increase food intake: greater variety of
foods [45], high-energy dense foods [46], bigger portion
sizes (i.e., buffets) [47], and eating in company (i.e., social
reunions) [48], plus less physical activity during winter [15,
16]. However, there is a lack of studies that have elucidated
the mediators of the weight gain during these periods.
There are mechanisms that regulate weight at an estab-
lished point [49]. However, this mechanism appears to be
asymmetrical, more oriented to the prevention of weight loss
(body fat) rather than to prevention of weight gain [49, 50].
The Westernized ‚ÄúCafeteria diet‚Äù that includes palatable and
high calorie foods may also be common during holidays. In
experimental animal model studies, this diet can cause loss of
weight regulation, contributing to hyperphagia and obesity
[49, 51, 52]. This palatable diet can lead to high intakes of
food by disrupting diverse signaling pathways related to food
control (including the activation of the reward system) [52].
4.3. Effects of Weight Gain, Weight Loss, and Weight Regain
(Yoyo Effect). The deleterious effect of weight gain and
obesity on health is highly documented. However, the effect
of losing and regaining weight or gaining and reducing
weight is a different case. A recent study showed that
fluctuations in body weight are associated with a higher rate
of cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals with
coronary artery disease [53]. However, the point that the
yoyo effect is harmful to health remains debatable [54‚Äì56].
It is necessary to make a distinction between variations in
body weight for various reasons and fluctuations in body
weight due to voluntary healthy lifestyle intervention. When
an individual regains some of his weight after participating in
a lifestyle intervention program (healthy diet, regular physical
activity, and behavior therapy), the evidence shows that this
body weight fluctuation is associated with positive effects on
health. The Diabetes Prevention Program study showed that
at one year after randomization, participants belonging to the
lifestyle intervention group lost 7 kg; nevertheless at year 5
the weight loss was only 2 kg, and there were no differences
versus the control group at year 10 after randomization [57].
However, the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes was
reduced by 34% in the lifestyle intervention versus the control
group [57]. It makes sense that when individuals with obesity
improve their weight, fitness, body composition, blood lipids,
blood sugar, and blood pressure, lower inflammation, and
 Journal of Obesity
11
reduce sleep apnea, liver fat, and urinary incontinence as well
as improving sexual dysfunction and other markers of mental
health (depression and quality of life) [4] even for a limited or
an extended time, these benefits could impact positively their
health instead of harming it.
5. Limitations of the
Studies and Recommendations
Selection bias is among the limitations of the studies
reviewed, for instance, in using nonrandom and nonrepre-
sentative samples. People interested in their weight and health
could be more likely to be involved in these studies, leading
to more conservative results. However, it has been observed
that even health practitioners and patients with controlled
diabetes, highly motivated individuals and participants under
treatment for obesity also gain weight during the holiday
season (Table 2). Small sample size is another potential
source of bias, with most studies having a sample of less
than 200 participants. Most of the participants knew that
the main outcome of the study was to evaluate the effect of
holidays on body weight, likely making them more conscious
about their weight. Although studies suggest weight might
be gained during holidays, only two studies have followed
up the participants to see if this weight is maintained or
subsequently lost [14, 20]. In the Yanovski study the weight
gain was maintained afterwards [14], while the motivated self-
monitoring group of Withings weight scale users lost the
weight gained during the holiday season in the follow-up
period [20]. Thus, more studies are required with follow-up
of the participants beyond the holiday season to evaluate if
the weight gain is maintained or lost.
6. Conclusion
Holidays seem to increase body weight in adults. However, to
be able to generalize the results, studies with representative
population samples are needed. In children, adolescents,
and young adults (college students) there are few published
studies from which to draw conclusions. Participants seeking
to lose weight appeared to increase weight although this was
not consistently significant and motivated self-monitoring
people also appeared to increase weight. These results must be
considered for registered dietitian nutritionists, other health
providers, and policy makers to prevent weight gain in their
patients and communities during this critical period. Studies
from other countries are required, given that the vast majority
of the studies were conducted in the United States and United
Kingdom. We suggest more studies are needed that include
representative samples of the general population in different
age groups that evaluate change in obesity parameters and
that consider the methodological limitations mentioned in
this review.
