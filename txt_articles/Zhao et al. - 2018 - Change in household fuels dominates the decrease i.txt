To tackle the severe fine particle (PM2.5) pollution in China, the
government has implemented stringent control policies mainly on
power plants, industry, and transportation since 2005, but esti-
mates of the effectiveness of the policy and the temporal trends
in health impacts are subject to large uncertainties. By adopting an
integrated approach that combines chemical transport simulation,
ambient/household exposure evaluation, and health-impact assess-
ment, we find that the integrated population-weighted exposure to
PM2.5 (IPWE) decreased by 47% (95% confidence interval, 37–55%)
from 2005 [180 (146–219) μg/m3] to 2015 [96 (83–111) μg/m3]. Un-
expectedly, 90% (86–93%) of such reduction is attributed to re-
duced household solid-fuel use, primarily resulting from rapid
urbanization and improved incomes rather than specific control
policies. The IPWE due to household fuels for both cooking and
heating decreased, but the impact of cooking is significantly larger.
The reduced household-related IPWE is estimated to avoid 0.40
(0.25–0.57) million premature deaths annually, accounting for 33%
of the PM2.5-induced mortality in 2015. The IPWE would be further
reduced by 63% (57–68%) if the remaining household solid fuels
were replaced by clean fuels, which would avoid an additional
0.51 (0.40–0.64) million premature deaths. Such a transition to clean
fuels, especially for heating, requires technology innovation and policy
support to overcome the barriers of high cost of distribution systems,
as is recently being attempted in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area. We
suggest that household-fuel use be more highly prioritized in national
control policies, considering its effects on PM2.5 exposures.

A
mbient fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations in China are
among the highest in the world (1, 2). Since 2005, the
Chinese government has implemented emission-control policies
that have been continuously tightened. The overarching goal was
to cut down the total emissions of air pollutants such as SO2,
particulate matter (PM), and NOx (3, 4). The focus of the control
policies was initially placed on power plants and transportation
and extended to industrial sources after 2010. In 2013, China
issued the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan,”
which marked the most stringent policy in the nation’s history
(5). In this plan, power, industrial, and transportation sources
remained the three foci. As a result, both bottom-up emission
estimates and satellite observations indicate that China’s total
emissions of SO2 and primary PM have decreased substantially
since about 2006, as well as those of NOx since 2011 (4, 6–10).
The goal of most air pollution control, however, is to reduce ex-
posure to protect the human health. The exposure and health im-
pacts are induced not only by ambient air pollution (AAP), but also
by household air pollution (HAP) from indoor solid-fuel use. The
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated that HAP from
burning of solid cooking fuels resulted in 0.82 million premature
deaths in China in 2010, without considering fuel use for space
heating. This is comparable to 1.07 million due to AAP (11). Besides
contributing to HAP, household fuels also act as one of the most
important sources of AAP in China because of their large emission
rates per unit fuel and low emission height (12–14). Household fuels
have been largely neglected in China’s environmental policies until
2017, when a work plan for clean fuel substitution was launched in
Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and their surrounding areas (15, 16). Nev-
ertheless, the transition from solid fuels to cleaner fuels happened
spontaneously, due largely to urbanization-induced population mi-
gration and increased income (17–19), which leads to potentially
important environmental and health benefits.
Considering the complex driving factors, there are large uncer-
tainties in trends of the integrated population-weighted exposure to
PM2.5 (IPWE, defined as the total population-weighted exposure to
both AAP and HAP) and the associated premature mortality. A
systematic assessment of these trends and the key emission sources
governing the trends could help to develop optimized control pol-
icies based on their health benefits, which would be more effective
Significance
The Chinese government has taken efforts to tackle the na-
tion’s severe ambient fine particle (PM2.5) pollution. Our results
suggest that reduced household solid-fuel consumption was
the leading contributor to the rapid decrease in the integrated
exposure to ambient and household PM2.5 pollution during
2005–2015, even though there was no explicit household con-
trol policy. In contrast, the emission reductions from power
plants, industry, and transportation contributed much less to
the decrease of integrated exposure. Clean household heating
fuels have become part of recent control policies in northern
China, but such policy would be strengthened if extended to
heating and cooking countrywide since shift of the remaining
household solid fuels to clean fuels could additionally avoid an
estimated half-million premature deaths annually.

 than the current emission-oriented policies. The GBD project has
conducted a decadal-scale health-impact evaluation based on global
modeling and databases (20–22), but not yet created a synthesized
assessment of the health impacts from AAP and HAP. An in-
tegrated approach and locally derived datasets (e.g., emission in-
ventory and ambient and household measurements) are needed,
however, for a comprehensive assessment of the trends in IPWE
and associated premature mortality. In addition, it helps in identi-
fying the key emission sources contributing to trends.
This study adopts an integrated model framework that synthe-
sizes AAP and HAP through linking local emission inventory,
chemical transport simulation, ambient/household exposure evalu-
ation, and health-impact assessment. The objective is to investigate
the trends in IPWE and associated premature mortality, and par-
ticularly the contribution of household fuels to the trends, in China
during 2005–2015. The AAP exposure from primary and secondary
PM2.5 is estimated by using the Community Multiscale Air Quality
model with the 2D Volatility Basis Set (CMAQ/2D-VBS) (23) with
emission inputs derived from a Chinese emission inventory de-
veloped in our previous studies (24–27) and updated to 2015 in the
present study. The additional HAP exposure due to solid-fuel use
is evaluated by combining local statistics, census, and household
exposure measurements. Our results indicate that the reduced
household solid-fuel use has been a leading contributor to the rapid
decline in IPWE and the associated estimated reduction in pre-
mature mortality from air pollution in China during 2005–2015.
Important air-quality and health benefits would be further achieved
if the remaining household solid fuels were replaced by clean fuels.
Results and Discussion
Significant Reduction in IPWE Between 2005 and 2015. Fig. 1 A and B
illustrates the IPWE in China in 2005 and its variations from
2005 to 2015. The mean IPWE for the entire China mainland,
including both ambient and household pollution, was 180 μg/m3
in 2005, with a 95% confidence interval of 146–219 μg/m3 (see SI
Appendix, section 3 for the uncertainty analysis method). It de-
creased to 96 (83–111) μg/m3 in 2015 [i.e., by ∼47% (37–55%)].
The significant IPWE decrease essentially occurred across the
entire mainland of China (Fig. 1B), with mean decreasing rates
of 36% and 41% in urban and rural areas, respectively. The
national mean decreasing rate exceeded that in either the urban
or rural areas, because many rural residents migrated into cities
where people suffer from a much smaller IPWE due to a lower
HAP exposure from solid-fuel burning (Fig. 1E).
The significant nationwide decrease in IPWE is induced by the
decline of both HAP and AAP exposures. The HAP exposure,
which was seven times larger in rural areas than in urban areas,
was responsible for 69% of the national mean IPWE in 2005.
Note that the HAP refers to only the increased indoor PM2.5
exposure due to household fuels and does not include the expo-
sure due to penetration of AAP indoors (Methods). The mean
HAP exposure decreased by 56% (56% in urban and 45% in rural
areas) during 2005–2015, as a result of reductions in household
solid-fuel consumption and the associated air pollutant emissions
(Fig. 2). During the 10-y period, the biomass consumption and
urban coal consumption dropped by 58% (Fig. 2 A and B). The
coal consumption in rural households fluctuated from year to
year, but decreased by 5% overall (Fig. 2A). A major driver be-
hind the decrease in solid fuels is the rapid urbanization and the
associated population migration, because rural residents generally
obtain better access to cleaner fuels as they migrate to cities (17,
18). Another important driver is improved income, which makes
cleaner fuels more affordable, as suggested by the significant
positive correlation between living standards and clean fuel usage
in previous surveys (19, 28, 29). As household solid-fuel con-
sumption shrinks, the emissions of PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and
organic carbon (OC) from household fuels decreased by 47–57%
over the period (Fig. 2 C–F).
Compared with HAP, the AAP exposure experienced a smaller
decrease of 24%, with similar decreasing rates in urban and rural
areas. The decline took place in most of China and peaked in major
metropolitan regions, particularly the North China Plain (Fig. 1D).
There is a good agreement between the simulated and observed
trends in PM10/PM2.5 concentrations and aerosol optical depth
(AOD) during 2005–2015 (SI Appendix, section 2). The change in
AAP exposure is a net result of the changes in pollutant emissions
from both household and nonhousehold sources (Fig. 2 and SI
Appendix, Table S1). In 2005, household fuels accounted for 28%,
42%, 64%, and 23% of the total emissions of PM2.5, BC, OC, and
nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), respectively,
and <5% of the emissions of SO2, NOx, and NH3. Along with the
decrease in emissions from household fuels, the emissions of PM2.5,
BC, OC, and SO2 from power plants, industry, and transportation
all experienced considerable reductions due to stringent control
measures, leading to an overall reduction of ∼40% in total emis-
sions of these four pollutants (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1). In
contrast, NOx and NMVOC emissions increased by 10% and 36%,
respectively, during the 10 y, since the decrease in emissions from
household fuels and power plants was not sufficient to offset the
growth in other sectors (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1). All
aforementioned emission trends of primary PM and gaseous pre-
cursors together result in the moderate decrease in AAP exposure.
Source Contribution to IPWE Reduction. We attribute the changes in
IPWE to individual factors, including AAP and HAP from
household coal, household biomass, other household fuels (pri-
marily gaseous fuels), and nonhousehold sources, as well as
meteorological conditions (Methods), as illustrated in Fig. 3A. In
2005, among all individual sources, HAP due to household bio-
mass made the largest contribution (110 μg/m3, 61%) to the
mean IPWE in China, followed by AAP from nonhousehold
sources (43 μg/m3, 24%) and HAP from household coal burning
(14 μg/m3, 8%). The large contribution from household biomass
results from a combination of large fractions of residents using
biomass as their main cooking fuels (10% and 70%, respectively,

 in urban and rural areas in 2005; SI Appendix, Fig. S3) and high
PM2.5 exposures in biomass-using households.
From 2005 to 2015, HAP from household biomass decreased by
67 (41−100) μg/m3 as a result of a remarkable decrease in biomass
consumption by >50% (based on three independent nationwide
statistics/surveys; SI Appendix, section 1 and Fig. S1). This repre-
sents the largest contributor to the reduction of IPWE during the
10-y period, far exceeding the contributions from any other source
(Fig. 3A). The AAP from nonhousehold sources and AAP from
household biomass, which decreased by 10 and 6 μg/m3, re-
spectively, are the second and third largest contributors to IPWE
reduction. The features of the source contributions differed in ur-
ban and rural areas. In the urban area, AAP from nonhousehold
sources played the most important role in reducing IPWE, followed
by HAP due to household biomass. In the rural area, however,
HAP due to household biomass stood out as the dominant factor
due to widespread biomass uses. HAP due to household coal
contributed 4 μg/m3 to the decrease in urban IPWE as a result of
the >50% decline in urban coal consumption, while its contribution
to rural IPWE changes was quite small because of the insignificant
change in rural coal use. With the effects of individual fuels com-
bined, the IPWE attributed to all household fuels decreased dra-
matically by 76 (48–109) μg/m3 during 2005–2015, representing as
high as 90% (86–93%) of the total IPWE reduction. In contrast, the
contribution from power plants to the total IPWE reduction was
only 4 μg/m3, or 5% (Fig. 3A), although the power sector as the
focus of China’s control policies constituted ∼90% of the SO2
emission reductions since 2005 and 70% of the NOx reductions
since 2011. In most provinces, household-fuel use is the largest
contributor to IPWE and its decrease from 2005 to 2015. In some
developed provinces (such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and
Guangdong), however, AAP due to nonhousehold sources plays the
most important role (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
We further separately estimate the IPWE from household fuels
used for cooking and space heating, as they have quite different
policy implications (see SI Appendix, section 5 for methods). The
results are shown in Fig. 3B. In 2005, the IPWE attributed to
cooking is ∼2.5 times as much as that due to space heating, since
heating is only needed in the winter of northern and central
China. From 2005 to 2015, the IPWE attributed to both cooking
and heating decreased, but the decreasing rate of solid-fuel
cooking (62% nationwide and 53% in rural areas) is signifi-
cantly larger than that of heating (39% nationwide and 24% in
rural areas). This is because the heating activities using natural gas
or electricity require a more expensive rural energy distribution
system (e.g., the natural gas pipeline network or terminal power
grid with sufficient capacity) (30). Other clean energy sources for
heating, such as solar energy, geothermal energy, and industrial
waste heat, are limited by resource availability. In contrast, various
clean cooking energy technologies, particularly those using lique-
fied petroleum gas, biogas, and electricity, have been increasingly
affordable and accessible for many rural residents.
The results presented above are different from traditional
source apportionment analysis which only focused on AAP. In
2005, household fuels account for 21% of the AAP exposure in
China (compare 76% of IPWE). From 2005 to 2015, household-
fuel use contributes 42% to the decrease of AAP exposure,
whereas its contribution to the decrease of IPWE is 90%.
Health Impacts and the Role of Household Fuels. Using the IPWE as
input, we apply the integrated exposure–response (IER) functions
to estimate the PM2.5-related premature mortality (Methods), as
shown in Fig. 4. In 2005, the PM2.5-related premature deaths
amounted to 1.72 (1.47–1.99) million. The marginal contribution of
household fuels was estimated at 0.91 (0.72–1.13) million, 53% (46–
60%) of the total (see Methods for the quantification approach).
Considering the curvilinear shape of the IER functions, the mar-
ginal contribution would have been even larger if the emissions
from nonhousehold sources had been lower. Approximately 80% of

AND PLANETARY SCIENCES
 the household-related premature deaths occurred among rural
residents (Fig. 4E).
Following the substantial reduction in IPWE, the PM2.5-related
premature deaths in 2015 were 29% (22–36%) lower than the 2005
level. The decrease occurred over most of China, except for some
urban centers such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chengdu
(Fig. 4C), where the mortality has increased because the effects of
IPWE reduction were counteracted by a rapid increase in the mi-
grant population. Nationwide, the total urban premature mortality
remained stable, while the rural mortality decreased dramatically by
∼43% (Fig. 4E). During the same period, the mortality due to
household fuels decreased by 0.40 (0.25–0.57) million in China,
accounting for 80% (69–88%) of the total reduction in PM2.5-re-
lated mortality. Almost everywhere in China has witnessed a re-
duction in household fuel-induced mortality (by 29% and 49% in
urban and rural areas, respectively), except for very few spots which
have dramatic population growth, such as parts of Beijing (Fig. 4D).
Note that the preceding trends in premature mortality are the
combined effect of multiple factors, including changes in IPWE,
population, age distribution, and background mortality rate. The
IPWE, however, is proved to be the predominant contributor to the
changes in premature mortality (SI Appendix, section 6).
Additional Benefits from Replacing Remaining Household Solid Fuels
with Clean Fuels. In 2015, household fuels still contribute 64% of the
IPWE and at least 43% of PM2.5-related mortality. In 2017, an
action plan for clean heating (15, 16) was launched in northern
China (14 provinces), with a focus on Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and
the surrounding areas. The overarching goal is to increase the
fraction of clean heating in northern China to 70% by 2021, which
means that ∼55% of the existing household solid fuels for heating
in these provinces shall be replaced with clean energy. We assume
that half of the solid fuels are replaced by natural gas and the other
half by electricity (see SI Appendix, section 7 for detailed methods).
A successful implementation of this policy would reduce the
emissions of PM2.5, BC, and OC from household fuels by 15–17%,
which could subsequently reduce the IPWE by 9.7% (8.8–10.4%) in
China and by 21% (19–23%) in northern China (Fig. 5A; this ac-
counts for associated increased emissions from power generation).
This is estimated to avoid 0.055 (0.045–0.075) million premature
deaths annually (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, if all solid fuels used for
cooking and heating in 2015 were thoroughly substituted by elec-
tricity and natural gas (50% each), the IPWE in China would be
lowered by 60 (47–75) μg/m3, or 63% (57–68%) of the total (Fig.
5A). The reductions in HAP and AAP exposures would be 54 and 6
μg/m3, respectively. This implies that ∼0.51 (0.40–0.64) million
premature deaths could be avoided annually (Fig. 5B).
The estimated health benefit is expected to be even larger if
nonhousehold sources were jointly controlled, considering the
curvilinear IER functions. The environmental and health benefits
of substitution by either electricity or natural gas are similar be-
cause the exposure increase due to additional electricity or natural
gas consumption are much smaller than the exposure decrease
due to reduced solid fuels (SI Appendix, section 7). Perhaps sur-
prisingly, the environmental and health benefits are largely in-
sensitive to the assumed energy mix of power systems to supply
the needed electricity due to the large difference in intake frac-
tions between household sources and power plants (SI Appendix,
section 7). All of the preceding control options would bring more
dividend to rural people who have been exposed to the highest
levels of IPWE—specifically, approximately three-quarters of the
avoided premature deaths would be rural residents.
Policy Implications
As stated previously, the decrease in solid-fuel consumption in
China during 2005–2015 was primarily driven by rapid urbanization
and improved income rather than specific control policies. Given
the ongoing urbanization and economic development in China, it is
fair to expect that the transition toward clean fuels for cooking will
continue, even if no control policy is implemented. The spontane-
ous transition, however, is expected to slow down due to the slower
economic growth and urbanization rate (31). The transition in
heating fuels presents a bigger challenge because of the foreseeable
barriers of infrastructure development, such as the construction of a
natural-gas pipeline network or an upgrade of terminal power grid
in the rural areas and “urban villages” in China (30). In addition,
the high cost (30) and limited supply of natural gas (32, 33) and
electricity may also hinder the transition toward cleaner heating
fuels. Indeed, these factors may have prevented many residents

 from changing from biomass or coal to clean energy in the last
decade. This can be inferred because total rural coal consumption
remained relatively stable during 2005–2015 (Fig. 2A), even when
the rural population decreased significantly. Promoting and expe-
diting the transition from solid fuels to clean energy (electricity or
natural gas), particularly for heating, involves affordable technology
innovation, infrastructure construction, clean fuel supply, and fi-
nancial subsidies. Besides, improving the thermal performance of
rural housing through better wall insulation and fenestration could
reduce over half of the space heating demand (34), thus lowering
the barriers to clean energy transition.
Until recently, China’s control policies have primarily targeted
large point sources, particularly power plants, with the overarching
goal of reducing total emissions of SO2 and NOx (and ambient
PM2.5 concentrations since 2013). Nevertheless, the IPWE re-
duction due to the emission controls in power plants has been only
5% of that due to the decreased household-fuel use during 2005–
2015. In addition, ∼90% of the household-related IPWE results
from HAP exposure (rather than AAP exposure), but HAP has not
been on the agenda of the policymakers in China in recent decades.
We suggest that IPWE should be used as a key metric for the
effectiveness evaluation of air-pollution control policies and that the
current control policies should be reevaluated and revised based on
their benefits on reducing IPWE. As we have defined it, it includes
exposures from AAP and from household fuels, two large sources,
but could be expanded in the future to accommodate the higher
relative exposures to other near-field sources, such as neighborhood
industries and vehicles, as has been suggested in India (35). Im-
portantly, household fuels would then be prioritized in health-
oriented control policies, given their dominant role in IPWE and
associated health impacts. As described above, an action plan for
clean heating (15, 16) was launched in northern China in 2017 and
was expected to lead to significant health benefits, although this
policy was motivated by the need to tackle ambient PM2.5 pollution
rather than IPWE (15, 16). This plan could also lead to a faster
transition in cooking fuels since the rural residents will have easier
access to clean fuels after the energy distribution system is con-
structed or improved. Such efforts are much needed and shall be
gradually strengthened and extended to cover solid fuels for both
heating and cooking across the whole country, since shift of the
remaining household solid fuels to clean fuels could additionally
avoid nearly half a million premature deaths. Finally, the present
study may also provide guidance to other developing countries, such
as India (21, 36), which suffer from similarly severe air pollution due
to solid-fuel burning.
Methods
Evaluation of IPWE. IPWE was used to measure the total population-weighted
exposure to PM2.5 through both AAP and HAP. It is defined as the weighted
sum of PM2.5 concentrations in all microenvironments where people spend
time, including the kitchen, living room, bedroom, outdoor environment, etc.
(37). The GBD study as well as most other environmental health studies (20, 21,
38) treated AAP and HAP as separate risks; there are overlaps between the two
since the HAP includes contributions from the AAP. In this study, the concept of
AAP is consistent with GBD and most other studies (12, 22, 39) which assume
that AAP generally penetrates into the household and constitutes a basic ex-
posure level for all people. The HAP refers to only the additional PM2.5 expo-
sure due to household-fuel use (37). Thus, the population-weighted exposures
from AAP and HAP add up to the total IPWE. This assumption only affected the
partitioning between AAP and HAP and did not affect the total IPWE or the
conclusion of the present study (SI Appendix, section 4). Another difference
from GBD is that we also included noncooking fuels (particularly heating fuels),
whose contribution to AAP is fully considered, and the contribution to HAP was
indirectly accounted for. IPWE is expressed as:
IPWE = PWEAAP + PWEHAP,
[1]
where PWEAAP is the population-weighted PM2.5 exposure due to AAP and
PWEHAP is the extra population-weighted exposure due to HAP.
PWEAAP was calculated by using the average of ambient PM2.5 concentra-
tions in each geographic unit, weighted by the population in that geographic
unit. The ambient primary and secondary PM2.5 concentrations were simulated
by the CMAQ/2D-VBS model (23) at 36- × 36-km resolution (see SI Appendix,
section 2 for details). To provide input to the CMAQ/2D-VBS model, we updated
the Chinese emission inventory developed in our previous studies (24–27) to
2015 (see SI Appendix, section 1 for details). The inventory included both pri-
mary PMs (PM10, PM2.5, BC, and OC) and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NOx, NMVOC,
and NH3) which contribute to secondary PM2.5 formation. The county-level
populations were acquired from Chinese statistics, and the subcounty distribu-
tion of population was based on the LandScan dataset at ∼1-km resolution (40).
The geographic unit used in calculation was the intersection of counties and
36- × 36-km model grids, so that the data sources with the highest resolution ere
utilized. Since regional chemical transport models usually underestimate PM2.5
concentrations in the urban centers (by ∼17% in this study; SI Appendix, section
2) while representing rural areas better, we adjusted PM2.5 concentrations in
urbanized counties (defined as those with population density >500 per km2)
based on monitoring data in 2015 from the Ministry of Environmental Protec-
tion’s nationwide network covering 1,497 sites in 367 cities, following Brauer
et al. (41) and Aunan et al. (37). The same adjustment factors were also applied
to 2005 and 2010, considering that the model captures the temporal trends in
PM2.5/PM10 concentrations very well (SI Appendix, section 2). This treatment
minimized the bias in the relative contributions from AAP and HAP to IPWE.
PWEHAP is estimated as:
PWEHAP = 1
P
X
i, j, k
�
Pi,j,k · HAPj,k
�
,
[2]
where P is population, HAP is the extra PM2.5 exposure levels of solid-fuel users,
i refers to geographic unit, j refers to setting (urban or rural), and k refers to
main household cooking fuel type (i.e., coal and biomass). HAPj,k was estimated
by Mestl et al. (42) and subsequently updated in our previous study (37). It was
calculated as the proportion of time spent in the different microenvironments
(kitchen, living room, bedroom, indoors away from home, and outdoors)
multiplied by the PM2.5 concentration in the given microenvironment. The
PM2.5 concentrations in various microenvironments were obtained by summa-
rizing a wide range of measurements in China, and the age, sex and season
specific time-activity patterns for urban and rural populations were gathered
from literature and surveys (37, 42). We classified a number of “exposure re-
gimes” based on urban/rural setting and main cooking fuels, which were
demonstrated to be key determinant factors of HAP exposure levels (37). The
annual mean HAPj,k for urban and rural biomass users was estimated to be 223
(95% confidence interval, 125–321) and 250 (180–320) μg/m3, respectively, and
the corresponding values for urban and rural coal users were 38 (28–48) and
117 (98–136) μg/m3, respectively. No extra HAP exposure was considered for
clean fuel users. It should be noted that many households use more than one
type of fuel, and in some settings, solid fuels are used both for cooking and
heating. These impacts were indirectly taken into account in the HAP exposure
estimates (37) through the fact that HAP measurements were carried out in
settings where heating existed if needed and fuel mixtures often occurred.
There were insufficient data to separately estimate the HAP exposure levels for
cooking and heating or for multiple fuel mixtures. A nationwide survey (28)
revealed that the fraction of solid-fuel users for cooking correlates well with
that for heating, supporting our classification according to main cooking fuel.
We also calculated IPWE using the HAP exposure levels from the GBD study
(21), which are based on in-situ measurements in India, and compared them
with the estimate in the present study (SI Appendix, section 8).
Regarding populations using coal and biomass as their main cooking fuels
(Pi,j,k in Eq. 2), the National Population Census (43, 44) provides county-level
data in 2010, which were subsequently combined with provincial-level sta-
tistics of household coal and biomass consumption during 2005–2015 (de-
scribed in SI Appendix, section 1) to derive county-level solid fuel-using
populations during 2005–2015, as illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig. S3. The ra-
tionale behind this is that the total exposure amount (Pi,j,k · HAPj,k in Eq. 2) for
a specific geographic unit, setting (urban or rural), and solid-fuel type is
proportional to the solid-fuel consumption, under the assumption that the
stove technology remains unchanged over time (see SI Appendix, section 4 for
more discussions). A large-scale survey conducted in 2012 reported that 12%
and 48% of the urban and rural residents used biomass as their main cooking
fuels (28), which is comparable to our estimates (7% and 49%, respectively).
Health-Impact Assessment. Here, we used premature deaths as a health in-
dicator. We estimated the premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 pollution
based on relative risks of mortality, baseline mortality rate, and population
(22, 45). We calculated the relative risks of mortality as a function of PM2.5
exposure (IPWE in this study), employing the age- and sex-specific IER
functions developed by Cohen et al. (22), which is an updated version of
Burnett et al. (45). IER functions were constructed by combining risk esti-
mates from studies of AAP, HAP, and active and second-hand smoking that

 cover a full PM2.5 exposure range from very small to ∼30,000 μg/m3 (22, 45).
Therefore, they are suitable for this study which involves large PM2.5 expo-
sures from both AAP and HAP over a highly polluted region. The health
endpoints considered include ischemic heart disease, stroke, bronchus and
lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for adults and lower
respiratory infections for children and adults. We obtained the disease-
specific baseline mortality rates by age and gender from the Institute of
Health Metrics and Evaluation (46).
Quantification of the Contribution from Individual Sources. We quantified the
marginal contribution of a specific emission source (e.g., household coal) to
both IPWE and premature deaths by designing a hypothetical scenario in
which the air pollutant emissions and HAP exposure from this source are
eliminated and comparing it with the baseline scenario where all sources are
included. Because of the nonlinearity in emission–concentration relation-
ships, the sum of contributions from household coal, household biomass,
and other household fuels to IPWE is not exactly equal to the contribution
from all household fuels. Their difference, however, is within 3% according
to our simulation results. Besides, we quantified the effect of meteorological
changes using the difference between the baseline simulations in 2005 and a
sensitivity scenario where the emissions in 2005 and meteorological fields in
2015 were employed.
