Abstract
Background: There are a number of therapies currently available to assist healthcare professionals
and carers with non-pharmacological treatment for people living with dementia. One such therapy
that has been growing in clinical practice is doll therapy. Providing dolls to some people living with
dementia has the potential to enhance personal well-being through increased levels of communication
and engagement with others. Despite its potential for benefits, the practice is currently under-
developed in healthcare literature, probably due to varied ethical interpretations of its practice.
Aim: To undertake a critical review of the published literature on doll therapy, using the Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist (CASP) tool, in order to determine the potential benefits
and challenges of this therapy for people living with dementia.
Design: A comprehensive literature search, incorporating the CINAHL, Medline, Embase,
PubMed, Joanna Briggs, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO data bases, was conducted.
Conclusions: Despite many commentaries and anecdotal accounts of the practice, this review
identified only 11 empirical studies that were eligible. The majority of studies found that the use of
dolls could be therapeutic for some people living with dementia by reporting increased levels of
engagement, communication and reduction in episodes of distress. Some studies identified
limitations to the therapy including; confusion over the ownership of the doll and healthcare
professional uncertainty about issues pertaining to autonomy.

Relevance to clinical practice: According to this review, doll therapy has the potential to
increase the well-being of some people living with dementia. This review illuminates that
some healthcare professionals feel uncomfortable about its use in clinical practice. The
operationalisation of doll therapy in clinical practice has been shown to be inconsistent with
different approaches to the practice being advocated. This highlights the need for further
empirical research to identify best practice and education to increase awareness in both
healthcare professional and carer populations.

Introduction
The number of people living with dementia is increasing globally. Indeed conservative
estimates suggest that the number of people affected will increase almost three fold, from
40 million to 115 million people (Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2012). Due to the
clinical
manifestations
of
dementia
(which
can
include
communication
difficulties,
distressed behaviours, despondency, withdrawal and anxiety), there has been a plethora of
research around therapies and non-pharmacological interventions that can serve to increase
the autonomy and well-being of those people living with dementia (Downs & Bowers, 2008).
The therapeutic use of dolls has been one such technique that has been growing in clinical
practice over the last number of years. This therapeutic use of dolls, which is widely known
as doll therapy, is usually led by the person living with dementia and includes behaviours like
holding, talking to, feeding, cuddling or dressing the doll (Mitchell, 2014). Providing a baby
doll seems to have the potential to greatly enhance the well-being of some people who are
living with dementia (Gibson, 2005). This enhancement of well-being has been described as:
increased engagement with others, increased dietary intake, improvement in communication
and a reduction in anxiety (Mitchell & Templeton, 2014). These benefits to well-being have
been supported by a range of anecdotal evidence (i.e. authors who have written on personal
experiences of doll therapy for people living with dementia, but not carried out empirical
investigation) and this includes work by Heathcote and Clare (2014), Moore (2001) and
Verity (2006).
It has been postulated that the rationale for these improvements in well-being are
associated with attachment needs. Many commentators have attributed John Bowlby’s
work on attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) as the central rationale as to why doll therapy
has the potential to be therapeutic for people living with dementia (Mitchell & O’Donnell,
2013; Stephens, Cheston, & Gleeson, 2013). Attachment has long been identified as a key
psychological need for people living with dementia due to the new challenges, anxiety and
uncertainties that are faced as a result of advancing disease (Kitwood, 1997; Miesen, 1993).
Interestingly, Bowlby’s conceptual work on attachment theory was originally focused on
child populations (Bowlby, 1969). In actual fact it was Bere Miesen (1993) who first applied
attachment theory to people living with dementia. Miesen (1993) surmised that parent
fixation, or the way some people living with dementia continually search for their parents,
is an expression of an attachment need. This searching behaviour was perhaps evidence that

TER stage]
the person living with dementia was in an unknown, insecure environment and sought
reunion with a family in order to feel safe. If attachment needs are not met in times of
anxiety or uncertainty, there is potential for that person to see their level of well-being
diminish and in turn lead to distress (Kitwood, 1997; Miesen, 1993).
The theoretical underpinnings of doll therapy borrow the idea of attachment from
Bowlby (1969) and the application of this to people living with dementia by Miesen
(1993). With attention to the ‘doll’, the theoretical work of Winnicott (1953) is also
utilized (Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Mitchell & O’Donnell, 2013). Winnicott (1953), again
basing his psychological theory on child populations, noted that a ‘transitional object’ is
sometimes used by children when they are separated from their parents as it enables them to
feel a greater level of security in an uncertain environment (Loboprabhu, Molinari, &
Lomax, 2007). Winnicott (1953) suggested that soft toys, blankets or even repetitive
behaviours or phrases were used by children as a transitional object during times of
uncertainty. The work of Bowlby (1969), Miesen (1993) and Winnicott (1953) then
provide some theoretical underpinnings that are useful when considering how doll therapy
can support people living with dementia.
A major limitation in using these theoretical underpinnings to understand doll therapy is
undoubtedly in their application to child populations. An alternative theoretical lens that
has been considered for people living with dementia is the concept of personhood, which
incidentally has as its core an emphasis on promoting attachment. Kitwood (1997) was an
early champion with regards to promoting personhood in people living with dementia.
Personhood is defined by Dewing (2008) as being the different parts of human beings that
make them a person. With regards to people living with dementia personhood is arguably
more concealed due to the clinical manifestations of the disease (Nolan, Davies, Brown,
Keady, & Nolan, 2004; Smebye & Kirkevold, 2013). As a result of these clinical
manifestations, Kitwood (1997) famously warned that people living with dementia were at
a greater risk of having their personhood eroded. This erosion was said to be perpetuated by,
what Kitwood (1997) termed as, Malignant Social Psychology. Kitwood (1997) theorised
that Malignant Social Psychology would not only reduce the personhood of a person living
with dementia, but also increase stigmatisation associated with the disease. Importantly
Kitwood listed a number of depersonalising tendencies associated with Malignant Social
Psychology, one of which was infantilisation, or treating people living with dementia like
they were children. When considering the therapeutic use of dolls for people with dementia,
it is pertinent that it is distinguished and differentiated from forms of play therapy which are
associated with child populations. This differentiation is particularly important when
considering, not only the therapy itself which will always have the potential to infantilise
if not supported appropriately, but also the sparse theoretical underpinnings to its use in
practice, which were firstly borrowed from child psychology prior to in-depth empirical
investigation.
While some may argue that providing a doll to a person living with dementia has the
potential to infantilise (Boas, 1998; Cayton, 2001; Salari, 2002), there is evidence to suggest
that if this therapy is understood, developed and utilised correctly, that it has the potential to
recapture the personhood of individuals who are living with dementia. This assertion is
based on Kitwood’s (1997) ideology of Positive Person Work, bioethical considerations
(Mitchell & Templeton, 2014) and the very ethos of person-centred care (McCormack &
McCance, 2010). When considering the work of Professor Tom Kitwood (1997), Malignant
Social Psychology is juxtaposed to Positive Person Work. While Malignant Social

Psychology has the potential to undermine personhood, Positive Person Work has the
potential to build personhood when considering the person living with dementia. Positive
Person Work corresponds to types of interaction that people living with dementia should be
supported to have and include play, facilitation and validation (Kitwood, 1997). These
positive interactions have the potential to occur during therapeutic engagement with dolls.
With regards to play, which is differentiated from child’s play, Kitwood (1997) suggests that
people living with dementia should be supported to spontaneously express themselves by
carrying out activities with no specific directed goal. In addition to this, Kitwood (1997)
states that appropriate play therapy in dementia care should be led by the person because it
has the potential to facilitate spontaneity and self-expression. When considering facilitation,
Kitwood (1997) encouraged formal and informal caregivers to enable those living with
dementia to do what they were otherwise not able to do. Facilitating therapeutic
engagement with dolls has been suggested as fulfilling a maternal need for some people
with dementia (Heathcote & Clare, 2014). Validation may also be important as it has
been noted that a number of people living with dementia who engage with the doll
therapy believe their doll to be a living baby for whom they care (Mitchell & O’Donnell,
2013). If these experiences with the doll are validated, Kitwood (1997) states that the results
can help the person living with dementia to become more connected with others and their life
can be more meaningful.
When considering the bioethical principles associated with doll therapy for people living
with dementia, Mitchell and Templeton (2014) noted the importance of autonomy and
beneficence. Importantly, they advocated that the rights of a person living with dementia
should be upheld and so if the person living with dementia made the decision to engage with
a doll they should be afforded this right (Mitchell & Templeton, 2014). If the effects of doll
therapy were therapeutic, for example, increased dietary intake, improved communication,
reduction in episodes of distress (Mitchell, 2014), then the principle of beneficence was
fulfilled. With these in mind, Mitchell and Templeton (2014) were among the first authors
to assert that doll therapy could be a person-centred approach to care.
Person-centred care is an approach that places an importance on the development of the
therapeutic relationship between the patient and healthcare professionals (McCormack &
McCance, 2006, 2010). This approach to care is not only underpinned by mutual respect for
the patient as a person, but also as an approach that seeks to consider the person’s holistic
needs as opposed to previous medical models of care (Edvardsson, Sandman, & Borell, 2014;
Hill, Roberts, Wildgoose, Perkins, & Hahn, 2010; Sidani & Fox, 2014). Through
collaboration and negotiation with people living with dementia and their care partners,
healthcare professionals are able to facilitate shared decision-making about care, which
may or may not include doll therapy. Importantly, a doll should not be forced on a
person living with dementia, instead healthcare professionals should facilitate the person
in making a choice, for example leaving the doll in a communal area or asking the person if
they would like to hold the doll. According to Mitchell and Templeton (2014), the decision
to engage with dolls is considered as a non-complex decision, vis-a
` -vis even if a person is
living with late-stage dementia they should still be able to make this choice. Note, this non-
complex decision-making is different to complex decision-making which is usually made by a
multi-disciplinary healthcare team and the next-of-kin with the person’s best interests in
mind, for example decision-making about medical interventions. The decision of whether
or not to engage with doll therapy should therefore always be with the person, or if this is not
possible, with the person in mind.

TER stage]
Aims
To undertake a critical review of the published literature on the therapeutic use of dolls in
order to determine the potential benefits and challenges of this therapy for people living with
dementia.
Rationale for review
As illustrated, therapeutic engagement with dolls has the potential to be beneficial to the
well-being of people living with dementia. This is coupled with the fact that the therapy is
also cost-effective. Despite these perceived micro and macro benefits there has been a paucity
of empirical investigation on the therapeutic use of dolls for people living with dementia.
There are also a number of theories, ranging from child psychologies to person-centred
psychologies, which have been used interchangeably to describe the reasons for its
effectiveness. The paucity of clinical guidelines and associated ethical tensions provide a
strong rationale for carrying out this review.
On review of the existing evidence base, it would also appear that no reviews of the
literature have been carried out on doll therapy for people living with dementia. This
review will serve to support healthcare professionals to understand the potential benefits
and disadvantages of doll therapy identified from empirical evidence. In addition to this, the
review will also demonstrate how doll therapy has been utilised in different clinical settings
to date.
Methods
Search strategy
A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out in April 2014 using the following
terms: dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease, people with dementia, doll therapy, doll, soft toy,
baby doll, play therapy and residential care institutions. These terms were used in the
following databases: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Internurse, Cochrane
Library, Joanna Briggs Institute, PubMed and NHS Evidence.
Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria
There is a paucity of empirical evidence on the phenomenon of doll therapy for people living
with dementia. As a result there were minimal exclusions applied to this review, except those
studies that were not written in English language, those studies that were not carried out
with people who are living with dementia and those which were not empirical. During the
searching stage of this review, it was found that Fernandez, Arthur, and Fleming (2013) have
published a systematic review protocol on the effect of doll therapy in managing behaviours
that challenge in people living with dementia. This review has not yet been completed and
appears to have a primary emphasis on measuring behaviour change, like ‘agitation, verbal
aggression and physical aggression’, through validated scales. The purpose of this review
differs as it seeks to not only explore the benefits and challenges of doll therapy for people
living with dementia within a practice context, which consequently will take into account
factors associated with well-being and ill-being and in turn may include what Fernandez
et al. (2013) term agitation, verbal and physical aggression’, but also explore additional

factors related to theoretical underpinnings and bioethics. Figure 1 provides an overview of
the results from the search strategy that found 11 studies eligible for inclusion.
Study characteristics
Study setting
Over half of the included studies were carried out in the UK. Six studies were carried out in
England and one in Scotland. In addition to this, two studies were carried out in the USA,
while one study was identified in Japan and one in Australia. It is also interesting to note
that, five studies (Alander, Prescott, & James, 2013; Ellingford, Mackenzie, & Marsland,
2007; Fraser & James, 2008; James, Mackenzie, & Mukaetova-Ladinska, 2006; Mackenzie,
James, Morse, Mukaetova-Ladinska, & Reichelt, 2006) were carried out by personnel from
the same centre, the Newcastle Challenging Behaviour Service (UK). This concentration of
studies in the United Kingdom may raise some questions over generalisability.
The settings for the included studies, which incorporated people living with dementia,
were most often long-term care facilities or nursing homes (Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Cohen-
Mansfield, Thein, Dakheel-Ali, Reiger, & Marx, 2010; Ellingford et al., 2007; James et al.,
2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013; Tamura, Nakajima, & Nambu, 2001).
Only two studies investigated doll therapy within a hospital setting (Green et al., 2011;
Minshull, 2009).
Research design
The majority of studies sought to investigate the phenomenon of doll therapy through
observational data collection of people engaging with doll therapy (Bisiani & Angus,
2013; Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010; Green et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2013; Tamura
et al., 2001). Four studies sought to examine healthcare professional perceptions on the
use of doll therapy through the administration of questionnaires (James et al., 2006;
Mackenzie et al., 2006) and semi-structured or focus-group interviews (Alander et al.,
2013; Fraser & James, 2008). The one remaining study conducted a retrospective analysis
of case notes pre and post-doll therapy (Ellingford et al., 2007).
Sampling
Across the 11 included studies a total of 448 people living with dementia and 49 healthcare
professionals were recruited (n ¼ 497). It should be noted that the study conducted by Cohen-
Mansfield, Thein, Dakheel-Ali, Reiger, and Marx (2010) examined the impact of different
stimuli (one of which was doll therapy) for people living with dementia. It is the only study
that is included in the review that does not explicitly evaluate doll therapy and included 193
people living with dementia which is almost half of the participants of this review. In relation to
the number of participants in this review, the mode was 14 participants, the median was 14
participants and the mean number of participants was 45. Seven of the eleven studies included
in this review were conducted with 16 participants or less (Alander et al., 2013; Bisiani &
Angus, 2013; Fraser & James, 2008; James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Minshull,
2009; Stephens et al., 2013; Tamura et al., 2001). There were no studies that sought to
investigate the phenomenon from the perspective of care partners (relatives or informal carers).
For a comprehensive overview of the included studies see Table 1.

the dolls were real babies.
People living with dementia who

so within around 90 s. The
most common observed
behaviours from engagement
were: ‘‘carrying while

Study appraisal
All studies included in this review were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme Checklist (CASP), which was developed in the United Kingdom. Based on
the checklist questions, each study was given a score and placed into the category of low,
medium or high quality. With regards to this review, seven studies were deemed to be high
quality (Alander et al., 2013; Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010; Fraser &
James, 2008; James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013), one study was
medium quality (Tamura et al., 2001) and three were low quality (Ellingford et al., 2007;
Green et al, 2011; Minshull, 2009). With regards to the lower quality studies, the rationale
for this scoring was mostly due to limited details about methodological approach. It is worth
acknowledging that the three lower quality studies included 190 participants of the 497
participants included in the review, which is almost 40%. It is also worth highlighting
again that, while Cohen-Mansfield et al. (2010) were judged to have a high quality study
based on the CASP, their study used a variety of stimuli interventions, which included dolls,
and this accounted for almost 40% (193 participants). In total then, there were 101
participants (20%) included in this review, which were deemed to be high quality and
concentrated solely on the use of doll therapy.
Findings
Benefits of doll therapy
All studies included in this review clearly articulated a number of benefits that were
associated with doll therapy. The most commonly reported benefit was improvement in
communication between the person living with dementia and other residents or care staff
(Alander et al., 2013; Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Ellingford et al., 2007; Fraser & James, 2008;
James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Minshull, 2009; Stephens et al., 2013; Tamura
et al., 2001). The use of dolls gave people living with dementia a means to engage with care
staff or residents. In the study by James, Mackenzie, and Mukaetova-Ladinska (2006), it was
reported that a group of women who engaged with their dolls began to sit together and
connect as a group. James et al. (2006) reported that this group began what was
affectionately known as the ‘mother’s group’ (p. 1095). In addition to this, Minshull
(2009) reported that some of her participants actually began to better articulate their
language and as a result express themselves more clearly to others. In one example,
Minshull (2009) recalls how one particular person living with dementia was ‘normally
incoherent in speech’ (p. 37) pre-doll therapy. Post-doll therapy Minshull (2009) reported
that this same person was able to better articulate their language through the doll by
communicating phrases like ‘‘baby. . .tickle her toes. . .oh pretty colours [regarding doll’s
pink cardigan]’’ (p. 37). The re-establishment of these communication channels is
arguably essential when considering the therapeutic relationship between the person living
with dementia and healthcare professionals. This notion was supported in the findings of
Fraser and James (2008) who conducted semi-structured interviews with healthcare
professionals, which included representation from nursing, psychology, occupational
therapy and psychiatry. Fraser and James (2008) identified communication as an
important theme as healthcare professionals were able to establish new communication
channels with people in their care. Fraser and James (2008) proposed that healthcare
professionals could frequently use the doll as a starting point for communication and

even talk to the doll and the person living with dementia as means of further developing the
therapeutic relationship.
While improvements in communication were important, other activities of daily living
were shown to be enhanced through engagement with dolls (Roper, Logan, & Tierney,
2000). Considering maintenance of a safe environment, many studies reported reductions
in distressing behaviour experienced by people living with dementia (Bisiani & Angus, 2013;
Fraser & James, 2008; James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013). This
distressing behaviour has been mainly described in the literature as: agitation, wandering,
anxiety, despondency and disengagement from others. During a single case-study on the
phenomenon, Bisiani and Angus illustrated how one resident’s (Mary) previous daily
experiences of ‘‘trying to leave the facility and asking for attachment/child were all
together eradicated’’ by doll therapy (p. 456). This was supported by the work of Green
et al. (2011), who noted that prescription of certain anti-psychotic medications was reduced
in populations who engaged with dolls.
An improvement in dietary intake, or the activity of eating and drinking, was also
identified as a potential benefit of doll therapy (Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Mackenzie et al.,
2006; Stephens et al., 2013). This increased dietary intake was as a result of a better dining
experience (as the doll provided immediate company) and increased awareness about food
(as the person would sometimes give their own doll food). The studies in this review also
found that residents who were previously reluctant to be assisted with elimination and
washing/dressing needs, were more approachable when engaging with a doll (Bisiani &
Angus, 2013; Fraser & James, 2008; James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Stephens
et al., 2013). The rationale behind this was related to the calming affect that the doll
appeared to have on users. Indeed, through analysis of questionnaires administered to
healthcare professionals, Mackenzie, James, Morse, Mukaetova-Ladinska, and Reichelt
(2006) found that the most common change in ‘emotional status’ observed in people
engaging with doll therapy was that of being ‘calmer’ (p. 443).
Finally, benefits associated with working and playing, sleeping and mobilisation were
also described in the literature. According to the findings of this review, therapeutic
engagement with dolls has given rise to a number of behaviours including touch,
cradling, cuddling, kissing, carrying, talking and singing (Alander et al., 2013; Bisiani &
Angus, 2013; Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010; Ellingford et al., 2007; Fraser & James 2008;
James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Minshull, 2009; Stephens et al., 2013; Tamura
et al., 2001). These behaviours are most perceived as therapeutic and fulfilment of
behaviour associated with play. However, as illuminated by Bisiani and Angus (2013),
some people who engage with doll therapy are also meeting working needs. For
example, Mary was observed to be asking healthcare professionals to ‘babysit’ when she
had other tasks that needed to be carried out (p. 456). Improvement in the quality of sleep
was another benefit identified by two studies in the literature (Bisiani & Angus, 2013;
Stephens et al., 2013). Presumably, a person with dementia (with increased general well-
being as a result of doll therapy), is more likely to settle into a better quality of sleep;
however this was poorly explored in the evidence. Interestingly one study (Bisiani &
Angus, 2013) even identified better mobilisation of a resident (Mary, the resident living
with a dementia observed in their single case-study). This was attributed to reduction in
episodes of anxiety that manifested as hyper-ventilation and tremors (which had previously
been so severe that they had caused falls). Figure 2 provides an overview of the reported
benefits of doll therapy.

Potential challenges of doll therapy
While there were a number of benefits that were associated with doll therapy, a number of
challenges were also identified. According to this review, the therapeutic use of dolls for
people living with dementia was approached in two main ways, either as an intervention or a
therapy. In the case of an intervention, which corresponds to dolls being offered to people
for a set period of time, this was less common (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010; Minshull, 2009;
Tamura et al., 2001). Naturally, these studies could not assess the long-term impact of dolls
in the way that the other studies could. The therapeutic engagement of dolls was deemed as a
‘therapy’ when it was provided to people living with dementia over a longer period of time
(i.e. months-permanent). As a long-term ‘therapy’, healthcare professionals were not

required to engage directly with the doll therapy (i.e. people living with dementia used the
dolls without direction) (Alander et al., 2013; Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Ellingford et al., 2007;
James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013). This was in contrast to the
interventional studies, where healthcare professionals guided or led people living with
dementia, on how to use the dolls. These differing approaches raise questions about how
best to operationalise doll therapy in practice.
Considering the person living with dementia, there were a number of studies identified in
this review that reported limitations with regards to doll therapy. While it has already been
reported that doll therapy has clear benefits associated with its use, some studies have noted
its effect is not always long-term. Indeed the findings suggest that some of the people who
engaged with dolls appeared to lose interest in the activity over a sustained period of time
(Stephens et al., 2013; Tamura et al., 2001). Ironically, while one of the key attributes of doll
therapy was reduction in distressing behaviour, there were some instances where doll use
caused distress for people living with dementia (Alander et al., 2013; Bisiani & Angus, 2013;
James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013). In particular, people who
engaged with dolls could become possessive of their doll and refuse to be parted from it
(James et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013). This possessive behaviour can manifest as either
desirable, because the person living with dementia has forged a therapeutic attachment with
their doll, or undesirable, because the person can become distressed if they are separated
from their doll.
Healthcare professional attitudes were found to be a potential barrier to engagement with
doll therapy (James et al., 2006; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Minshull, 2009). In the study carried
out by Mackenzie et al. (2006), the authors found, through use of questionnaires, that some
people thought the use of dolls was ‘‘babyish. . .demeaning. . .patronising. . .inappropriate’’
(p. 442). These attitudes were observed in practice through the work of Minshull who noted
that during her doll therapy intervention, ‘‘nursing assistants were sniggering’’ (p. 37).
Interestingly, the authors who identified staff scepticism as a potential issue appeared to
correct this through education (Mackenzie et al., 2006; Minshull, 2009). Administration of
literature, information sessions and on-the job experience were shown to increase healthcare
professional awareness and practice with doll therapy.
Emerging theoretical underpinnings
As alluded to, there have been some scant theoretical underpinnings as to how doll therapy
can enhance the well-being of people living with dementia based on the theories of
attachment and person-centred care. Two studies identified in this review have produced
comprehensive explanatory models based on grounded theory methods that are significant in
relation to emerging theory on doll therapy (Alander et al., 2013; Fraser & James, 2008).
Fraser and James (2008) developed a model, based on empirical investigation, to assist
practitioners in understanding the rationale for improvement in well-being for people
living with a dementia who engage with dolls. Fraser and James (2008) acknowledged the
importance of attachment in their model, but importantly recognised there were a number of
other equally pivotal factors which included; inclusion, comfort and identity. Importantly
these factors directly correspond with what Kitwood determined were the fundamental needs
of the person with dementia (Kitwood, 1997).
In addition to these factors, which correspond directly to previous theory on doll therapy,
Fraser and James (2008) reported emerging factors which relate to activity, innate drivers

and memories. Doll therapy could offer an opportunity for people living with a dementia to
engage in meaningful activity and as a result provide people living with a dementia with a
sense of purpose, examples of this may include nursing, feeding, dressing or singing to the
doll). On innate drivers, Fraser and James (2008) found that participants believed that
people engaging with dolls were responding to instinct-like behaviours, for example, the
innate wish to engage in social contact. Through grounded theory analyses it was also
suggested that doll therapy could evoke pleasurable memories for the person living with
dementia.
Alander, Prescott, and James (2013) used grounded theory to explore older adults’ views
and experiences of doll therapy. This ultimately supplements Fraser and James’ (2008) work,
which drew on a healthcare professional group. Alander et al. (2013) found that there were a
number of intrapersonal features which directly influenced the well-being of people living with
dementia and these included; ownership of a doll, purpose, role and attachment. In addition to
these intrapersonal features, Alander et al. (2013) found that there were also a number of
external interpersonal factors that could promote a person’s well-being and these included;
companionship, communication with others and greater inclusion. Interestingly Alander et al.
(2013) note that the majority of older adults involved in this study considered that intra/
interpersonal factors were more likely to outweigh any practical or ethical concerns.
In addition to the two studies that sought to generate theory (Alander et al., 2013; Fraser
& James, 2008), only two other studies identified in this review made explicit reference about
their theoretical underpinnings (Bisiani & Angus, 2013; Stephens et al., 2013). These two
studies drew on Bowlby’s attachment theory (1969) and the theory of personhood by
Kitwood
(1997). Stephens,
Cheston,
and Gleeson
(2013) also
utilised
Winnicott’s
transitional object theory (1953). Interestingly the studies identified in this review that do
underpin their research with theory are the more recent, which perhaps illuminates the
emerging development of research into doll therapy. Undoubtedly an explicit theoretical
foundation is important with regards to doll therapy because, as found in this review,
healthcare professionals may be resistive to using the therapy and therefore making the
case from a sound theoretical basis is important.
Summary
The findings of these empirical studies have illuminated a number of potential benefits in the
use of doll therapy for people living with dementia. In particular, the studies have associated
therapeutic engagement with dolls as a means to promote the well-being of people living with
dementia, particularly through improvements in activities of living. The empirical studies
included in this review provide some insight to potential challenges associated with doll
therapy but in less depth when compared to the benefits of the practice. Limited
professional awareness about appropriate utilisation of the therapy, problems pertaining
to doll ownership and negative pre-existing ideologies about the therapy appear to be the
main challenges of the therapy according to the review.
Discussion
There is evidence in the literature to suggest that the use of dolls can provide therapeutic
gains for some people living with dementia. The empirical evidence appears to provide some
direction on how best to utilise doll therapy. Clear division exists on whether dolls should be

used as an intervention or as a therapy and also whether this should be in a nursing home
facility or on a hospital ward. The only guidelines that exist on the use of doll therapy were
reported by the authors from the Newcastle Challenging Behaviour Service (Mackenzie,
Wood-Mitchell, & James, 2007). The authors of these guidelines were best placed to
provide these, given their empirical investigation of doll therapy over the past decade
(Alander et al., 2013; Ellingford et al., 2007; Fraser & James 2008; James et al., 2006;
Mackenzie et al., 2006). Despite their expertise and enterprising work, there are obvious
questions pertaining to the transferability of doll therapy to other clinical settings.
Ostensibly then, many healthcare professionals associate doll therapy as controversial or
contentious (Mitchell, 2014). Yet as evidenced in this review there are a number of people,
both healthcare professionals, older adults and people living with dementia who do support
its use, largely because of the benefits they have witnessed first-hand (Alander et al., 2013).
Unfortunately there was no evidence of how any care partners perceived doll therapy as this
group did not make up any of the participants in the review. Empirical research to date has
largely focused on the observed well-being of doll therapy and opinions of healthcare
professionals. Only Alander et al. (2013), who sought opinions from older adults (some
who lived with dementia and some who engaged with doll therapy), has carried out
investigation differently. As a result of this, it is difficult to determine how care partners
or informal caregivers would perceive doll therapy.
The utilisation of doll therapy in clinical practice is not automatically right or wrong,
however if the therapy is practiced or utilised in a meaningful way, it has the potential to be
truly person-centred. Person-centred care is underpinned by respect, understanding and an
enablement of practices that facilitate self-determination (McCormack, Dewing, et al., 2010;
McCormack, Karlsson, et al., 2010). Due to the paucity of literature on doll therapy it is
important that knowledge about appropriate practices and underpinning theory is delivered
effectively. As demonstrated in this review, one of the key challenges to doll therapy was
preconceptions or education of healthcare professionals who are key in enablement of the
therapy. The learning culture of a clinical environment is particularly important and
McCormack, Dewing, and McCance (2011) assert that any sustained learning will only
occur in a supportive context.
The application of doll therapy to the person-centred nursing (PCN) framework,
developed by McCormack and McCance (2006, 2010) from their previous work on
person-centred practice with older people (McCormack, 2003) and the experience of
caring in nursing (McCance, 2003), is particularly useful when considering the contents
of this review. McCormack and McCance’s (2010) PCN framework comprises four
constructs: pre-requisites, the care environment, person-centred processes and outcomes
(McCance,
McCormack,
&
Dewing,
2011;
McCormack,
Dewing,
et
al.,
2010;
McCormack, Karlsson, et al, 2010; McCormack & McCance, 2010; McCormack,
Roberts, Meyer, Morgan, & Boscart, 2012). This framework is particularly useful
because, as illustrated, the majority of empirical investigation on doll therapy has
occurred in care homes and, as such, nurses are the main representative from the
healthcare professional group. Nurses are therefore the most likely healthcare professional
group to facilitate doll therapy in clinical practice. The PCN can be an effective tool for
nurses to operationalise the practice of doll therapy and are considered as follows:
(1) Pre-requisites: This construct focuses on the attributes of the healthcare professional,
which should include professional competence, well-developed interpersonal skills and

commitment to their role. When considering doll therapy, engagement with dolls can
only work if this is facilitated by the healthcare professional. This review has
demonstrated that the people living with dementia who are likely to glean benefits
from doll therapy must be enabled or empowered by others. As all of these studies
were conducted in clinical settings the enablement is likely to be facilitated by a nurse.
(2) Care environment: This construct focuses on the context in which care is delivered and
should provide organisational systems that are supportive, facilitate a sharing of power
between person and nurse and there is potential for innovation and risk-taking. Building
upon the previous construct, the care environment should be equipped in a manner to
allow nurses to engage with doll therapy. Given the limited, but encouraging, evidence
that is on offer, doll therapy might be considered as an innovative approach for some
people living with dementia. For those practitioners who are less convinced, the therapy
may represent an opportunity of a balanced risk given the potential benefits for the
person living with dementia.
(3) Person-centred processes: This construct focuses on delivering care through a range
of therapeutic avenues that incorporate the person’s (patient) beliefs, values, shared
decision-making
and
the
provision
of
physical
care.
This
construct
is
also
underpinned by sympathetic presence. As demonstrated, doll therapy can facilitate
and support person-centred processes because of the potential for improvement in
many facets of daily living activities that have been identified in this review.
(4) Outcomes: This is the central component of the PCN model and should include
outcomes like; satisfaction with care, involvement in care, increased well-being and
promotion of the therapeutic environment. Doll therapy has the potential to enhance
meaningful engagement with people who are living with dementia and in addition it has
the ability to connect with the innate caring quality of the person (i.e. caring for a baby).
Limitations
One factor that was unclear from the empirical studies included in this review was the staging
of dementia and the associated benefits from doll therapy. When considering the illness
trajectory associated with dementia (Lunney, Lynn, Foley, Lipson, & Guralnik, 2003;
Murtagh, Preston, & Higginson, 2004; World Health Organisation (WHO), 2004), there is
no obvious stage (for example, in early or late dementia) where engagement with dolls is the
most therapeutic. That being stated, given the nature of the findings, it is probably a therapy
that is most utilised by people in the middle to late stages of the illness. The consequence of this
however, is that there has been no empirical investigation in relation to therapeutic engagement
with dolls outside a formalised care setting. When considering the potential benefits and
affordability of the therapy, it is surprising doll therapy does not occur at the homes of
people living with dementia with facilitation or support from informal caregivers or care
partners. As a result, there are no practice guidelines for doll therapy outside a clinical setting.
An area of note that was not overly developed in the literature was in relation to the
gender of people who engaged with dolls. While it is probably unsurprising that the vast
majority were female, a number of studies documented male engagement with dolls. This
perhaps offers an interesting lens of future inquiry because, based on the results of this
review, it is unclear if gender alone correlates with levels of engagement or well-being
and, in addition, if healthcare professionals perceive any differences with regards to

theoretical underpinnings or bioethical principles between men and women. Another
limitation identified through this review pertains to the theoretical underpinnings of doll
therapy for people living with dementia. From the review, there were inconsistent references
to how doll therapy has the potential to enhance the well-being of people living with
dementia. Those studies that did underpin their research with theory used attachment, the
concept of personhood or a combination of both. Limited reference to theoretical
underpinning is understandable given the paucity of research in this area.
In addition it should be also be noted that there have been no randomised controlled trials
that have been carried out to assess the efficacy of the therapeutic use of dolls, many of the
studies have been conducted in the same geographical areas and, when considering the
appraisal of the evidence, there were 101 participants (20% of the overall participants)
included in this review, which were deemed to be high quality and concentrated solely on
the use of doll therapy for people living with dementia.
Conclusion
The number of people living with dementia who are benefiting from therapeutic engagement
with dolls is increasing. While empirical investigation has been limited, there are a number of
encouraging results as well as many anecdotal accounts of its success. The results of doll
therapy are unique to the person and so it is impossible to predict what benefits a person
living with dementia will have, if any, when engaging with a doll but this review suggests
improvements in overall communication, engagement with others, dietary intake and general
well-being. Despite the growing evidence of potential benefits to people living with dementia,
doll therapy is still broached with caution by some. The main challenges to doll therapy
appears to due to pre-existing ideas from healthcare professionals who are crucial to
enablement of it in practice. These pre-existing ideas are often due to a result of limited
education on the therapy and its appropriate application to Positive Person Work (Kitwood,
1997); the bioethical principles of autonomy and beneficence (Mitchell & Templeton, 2014)
and most importantly the concept of person-centred care (McCormack & McCance, 2010).
While the PCN framework offers a very useful structured approach to facilitating doll
therapy in a person-centred way, one must still acknowledge the paucity of high-quality
empirical evidence. There is a pressing need for further empirical study so as healthcare
professionals can be provided greater evidence for the use of dolls in clinical practice. While
any type of empirical investigation would be extremely useful, a pertinent aspect that is
missing in this review at present is the voice of the care partner.
Relevance to clinical practice
(1) What does this research add to existing knowledge in gerontology?
. This review provides evidence to suggest that therapeutic engagement with dolls can
be beneficial to some people living with dementia.
. The review has highlighted that many healthcare professionals have poor education
on the use of dolls for people living with dementia.
. It demonstrates the lack of robust empirical studies focusing on the effectiveness of
doll therapy.
(2) What are the implications of this new knowledge for the care with older people?

. Some people living with dementia have been supported through doll therapy to
maximize their levels of independence and well-being.
. A number of the activities of daily living were enhanced through use of dolls,
particularly communication, eating/drinking, maintaining a safe environment and
sleep.
. Utilisation of doll therapy has the potential to be a person-centred practice.
(3) How could the findings be used to influence policy or practice or research or education?
. Further empirical research on the phenomenon is particularly pertinent, especially
with informal carers and family members.
