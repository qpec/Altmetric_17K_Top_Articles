Few Hospital Palliative Care
Programs Meet National Staffing
Recommendations
ABSTRACT The predominant model for palliative care delivery, outside of
hospice care, is the hospital-based consultative team. Although a majority
of US hospitals offer palliative care services, there has been little research
on the staffing of their program teams and whether those teams meet
national guidelines, such as the Joint Commission’s standard of
including at least one physician, an advanced practice or other registered
nurse, a social worker, and a chaplain. Data from the 2012–13 annual
surveys of the National Palliative Care Registry indicate that only
25 percent of participating programs met that standard based on funded
positions, and even when unfunded positions were included, only
39 percent of programs met the standard. Larger palliative care programs
were more likely than smaller ones to include a funded physician
position, while smaller programs were more reliant upon advanced
practice and registered nurses. To meet current and future palliative care
needs, expanded and enhanced education, as well as supportive financing
mechanisms for consultations, are needed.
P
alliative care provides patients with
relief from symptoms such as pain,
shortness of breath, fatigue, and de-
pression. Palliative care supports
the best possible quality of life for
patients with serious illnesses and their family
caregivers, regardless of whether the patient is
expected to recover or live with the illness for an
extended period of time or is nearing the end of
life.1–4 Palliative care includes hospice care but,
unlike hospice care, is not focused strictly on
end-of-life care after curative treatment has been
terminated.
Palliative care programs, which are distinct
from hospice care but may have a relationship
with a hospice program, have increased in num-
bers. In 1998, 15 percent of US hospitals with
over fifty beds had a palliative care program. The
percentage had risen to 67 percent in 2013.5 Pal-
liative care programs are now spreading into
community health care settings such as nursing
homes and home care services.1,6 Growth in pal-
liative care programs has been driven in part by
evidence that palliative care improves patient
outcomes and satisfaction, while reducing costs
associated with intensive medical care.1,7–14
Palliative care can be provided in settings
throughout the continuum of care, but the pre-
dominant model in the United States (outside of
hospice care) is the hospital consultative team
model.3 Central to this model are interprofes-
sional teams, which can include physicians,
advanced practice and other registered nurses,
social workers, chaplains, pharmacists, rehabil-
itation therapists, direct care workers, and other
clinical and nonclinical specialists.1–3,15
Palliative care programs that have higher staff-
ing levels are able to serve more patients, and
programs
with
higher
service
penetration
(higher percentages of patients who received a
consultation from the program) report shorter
lengths of time to initial consultation.16 The

 standards for the Joint Commission’s Advanced
Certification Program for Palliative Care state
that the core palliative care team should include
a physician (a doctor of either medicine or
osteopathy), an advanced practice or other reg-
istered nurse, a chaplain, and a social worker—
all with specialized training or clinical experi-
ence in palliative care.17 In addition, a consensus
panel convened by the Center to Advance Pallia-
tive Care recommended that palliative care pro-
grams have specific funding for a board-certified
physician.15 And the National Consensus Project
for Quality Palliative Care has advised that pro-
grams should have on-site staffing coverage dur-
ing normal business hours and telephone cover-
age at all times.2
There is limited research on staffing within
palliative care programs. A 2011 survey of pallia-
tive consultation services in hospitals in Califor-
nia reported that physicians were included in
85 percent of the programs, both social workers
and spiritual care professionals in 58 percent,
advanced practice registered nurses in 46 per-
cent, and registered nurses in 63 percent.18
A 2012 national survey of children’s hospitals
identified 112 pediatric palliative care programs,
which reported an average of 2.33 full-time-
equivalent (FTE) personnel—of which 0.85 FTEs
were
licensed
physicians
or
nurse
practi-
tioners.19 FTE staffing was as follows: 59 percent
of the programs employed physicians; 63 per-
cent, registered nurses; 45 percent, advanced
practice registered nurses; 34 percent, social
workers; and 26 percent, chaplains.
These studies suggest that many palliative care
programs do not meet national staffing recom-
mendations, although it is widely acknowledged
that the need for skilled providers is growing.3
For example, two bills pending in Congress, both
called the Palliative Care and Hospice Education
and Training Act (the House version is H.R. 3119
and the Senate version is S. 2748), aim to in-
crease the number of palliative care faculty mem-
bers in medical schools, nursing schools, social
work schools, and other programs.20
There have been no national assessments of
the extent to which Joint Commission and other
consensus recommendations are met by hospital
palliative care programs. We sought to fill this
gap in knowledge through an analysis of nation-
al data on staffing in the programs and an assess-
ment of whether there are important staffing
differences by program characteristics, hospital
characteristics, or region.
Study Data And Methods
Data We analyzed data from the 2012–13 annual
surveys of the National Palliative Care Registry.
The registry is a project of the Center to Advance
Palliative Care and the National Palliative Care
Research Center.21 Its voluntary surveys collect
self-reported operational data on hospital palli-
ative care programs. The programs compile and
submit information that includes the size and
nature of the program, size and type of the hos-
pital in which the program is located, penetra-
tion, scope of services, patient profile, staffing
levels, and certification.
For this analysis we used data from 2013 unless
a program did not respond in that year, in which
case we used data from 2012 if they were avail-
able. A comparison of the programs for which we
used 2013 data and those for which we used 2012
data is provided in online Appendix Exhibit A1.22
There were no significant differences between
the two sets of programs.
Data in the survey arecollected at the program,
not the hospital, level. A small number (thirty-
five) of palliative care programs in our data
served multiple hospitals.We excluded these pro-
grams from our analysis, since they were sub-
stantively different from the single-hospital pro-
grams. There also were twelve hospitals in the
survey that had two distinct palliative care pro-
grams. We retained data only from the program
with the larger number of consultations. Thus,
each of our 410 observationsrepresented a single
program in a single hospital.
Staffing information included both funded
and unfunded (in-kind—which includes time
paid by another department of the hospital—
and volunteer) positions, which provided a
count of the number of staff members in each
health care provider category as well as FTE em-
ployment. We grouped the professions as fol-
lows: director (nonphysician administrator or
medical director), physician (a doctor of either
medicine or osteopathy), advanced practice reg-
istered nurse or physician assistant, registered
nurse, social worker, chaplain, and all others.
Methods We began by identifying the charac-
teristics of the palliative care programs in the
data set. We then developed a detailed break-
down of staffing by the professional groups iden-
tified above for both funded and unfunded posi-
tions. We also computed the percentage of
palliative care programs with a complete team,
according to the Joint Commission’s standards.17
We assessed whether programs complied with
recommendations for on-site staffing coverage
during normal business hours and for telephone
coverageat alltimes.2Wealsodetermined wheth-
er programs included a paid physician in accor-
dance with the recommendation of the consen-
sus panel of the Center to Advance Palliative
Care15 and, if not, whether they included an ad-
vanced practice or other registered nurse.

 We used cross-tabulations to explore differenc-
es in staffing by palliative care program charac-
teristics and chi-square tests to assess whether
differences across groups were significant. Com-
parisons were made by program size, measured
as the number of consultations per year; hospital
size, measured as the number of beds; the types
of palliative services offered; staffing coverage;
program penetration; and region, using the ten
regions developed by the Health Resources and
Services Administration. Following previous re-
search,5 we divided hospitals into the following
two groups: those with fewer than 300 beds and
those with 300 or more beds.
Limitations This study had several limita-
tions. First, the data set did not include all palli-
ative care programs. It has been estimated that
1,591 hospitals with fifty or more beds had palli-
ative care programs in 2014.5 Our analytic data
set of 410 programs represented only 26 percent
of those programs. Our data overrepresented
programs in larger hospitals: 59 percent of the
hospitals in our data had 300 or more beds (Ap-
pendix Exhibit A2),22 but only 42 percent of pro-
grams nationally are in hospitals of this size.5
Given the voluntary nature of the survey and
the overrepresentation of larger hospitals, par-
ticipating programs may be more established
and have better resources than average. Thus,
their staffs may include a broader and better-
trained mix of professionals than average.
Second, the survey data are reported by pro-
grams and are not systematically verified. The
degree of reporting error is unknown, but we
assumed that programs were able to accurately
report on their staffing.
Third, the training and clinical experience of
members of the palliative care team are not re-
ported in the survey, except for the number of
staff members with palliative care certification.
Thus, we could not determine whether a pro-
gram’s staff was fully compliant with Joint Com-
mission standards.
Study Results
Of the 410 palliative care programs in our data,
95 percent offered only a consulting service (in
which palliative care team members serve pa-
tients across all hospital units), and the remain-
ing 5 percent offered a consulting service as well
as a dedicated palliative care unit (Appendix Ex-
hibit A2).22 Sixty of the programs (14.6 percent)
were certified by the Joint Commission, and sev-
enty-five (18.3 percent) had applied for certifica-
tion or were planning to do so within the
next year.
Hospitals with 300 or more beds accounted for
240 of the programs (59 percent). Of the pro-
grams, 129 (31.4 percent) had an outpatient clin-
ic, 69 (17 percent) had a home-based program,
and 390 (95.1 percent) had a relationship with a
hospice program. Only 272 (66.3 percent) had
staffing coverage in accordance with the guide-
lines published by the National Consensus Proj-
ect for Quality Palliative Care.2
The programs reported medians of 531 consul-
tations per year and 336 per 10,000 admissions.
The programs reached a median of 3.4 percent of
hospital
patients
(interquartile
range:
2.1–
4.9 percent). Patients older than age sixty-five
made up a median of 71 percent of all patients
receiving palliative consultations.
Funded And Unfunded Program Staffing
The mean number of funded staff members in
hospital-based palliative care programs was 6.8,
which produced 4.9 FTEs (Exhibit 1). Forty-five
percent of programs reported having in-kind or
volunteer staff members. More than half of the
programs reported that they had funded posi-
tions for physicians, nurses, and social workers,
but only 38 percent had funded chaplain posi-
tions. The difference between the numbers of
staff and FTEs suggests that part-time funding
was less common among nurses and social work-
ers and more common among physicians, chap-
lains, and other staff members. The mean FTEs
per 10,000 admissions was 3.3.
The most commonly reported unfunded posi-
tions were chaplains, other professionals, and
social workers (Exhibit 1). Unfunded chaplains
provided an average of 43 percent of chaplain
FTEs, and unfunded social workers provided
22 percent of social worker FTEs. The position
of administrator or medical director was unfund-
ed in 13 percent of the programs. The median
annual consultations per FTE (funded and un-
funded) was 144 (Appendix Exhibit A2).22

teristics And Region We found variations in

 staffing according to program characteristics
(Exhibit 2; see also Appendix Exhibit A3).22
There was a positive correlation between median
FTEs per 10,000 hospital admissions and the
number of annual consultations in a program.
Programs whose consultation volumes were in
the top quartile (above the seventy-fifth percen-
tile) reported median FTEs per 10,000 admis-
sions of 2.53, as compared with 1.80 FTEs for
programs with consultation volumes at or below
the median. The likelihood of having funded
physician,
social
worker,
and
chaplain
positions—but not of having funded registered
nurse positions—was greater for programs with
consultation volumes in higher versus lower
quartiles of number of consultations.
Hospitals with fewer than 300 beds reported
more FTEs per 10,000 admissions than did hos-
pitals with 300 or more beds (2.56 versus 1.88).
This is likely because programs need to maintain
a minimum level of staffing regardless of hospi-
tal size, and thus FTEs per 10,000 admissions
can be relatively high for small hospitals. Pro-
grams that had outpatient clinics, home-based
programs, recommended staffing coverage, and
penetration above the median had greater num-
bers of staff and FTEs per 10,000 admissions
than programs that did not.
Funded chaplains were more likely to be re-
ported by programs that had home-based pro-
grams and recommended staffing coverage than
by programs that did not. Funded physicians
were more common in programs with outpatient
clinics and recommended staffing coverage than
in those without (Exhibit 2). There were no sig-
nificant regional differences in funded staff
positions except for registerednurses (Appendix
Exhibit A4).22
Alignment With National Staffing Recom-
mendations Two-thirds of the programs re-
ported having a funded physician (Exhibit 3).
Programs with greater consultation volumes
were more likely to report having a funded phy-
sician than were programs with lower volumes.
Regional differences in the presence of physi-
cians, advanced practice or other registered
nurses, and registered nurses were not signifi-
cant (Appendix Exhibit A5).22
Only 25 percent of hospitals had a complete
team of funded staff members, according to the
Joint Commission standards17 (Exhibit 4). If un-
fundedpositions wereincluded, the share rose to
39 percent. Hospital programs with complete
teams were more likely than other hospitals to
have greater consultation volumes: Only 14 per-
cent of hospitals with volumes below the median
hada completefundedteam,comparedto36per-
cent of programs with volumes in the top quar-
tile. Programs with outpatient clinics, home-
based programs, and recommended coverage
also were more likely than other hospitals to
have complete funded teams. There were no sig-
nificant regional differences in the prevalence of
complete teams (Appendix Exhibit A6).22
Discussion
The Institute of Medicine has recommended that
all Americans with advanced illnesses have ac-
cess to palliative care services provided by well-
trained transprofessional teams.3 However, our
data revealed that palliative care programs
reached only a median of 3.4 percent of hospital
patients. Although the “right” penetration level
has not been determined, 3.4 percent is likely
below the need for consultation among hospital
patients.
One
recent
study
estimated
that
13.8 percent of intensive care unit admissions
met criteria for palliative care consultation,23
and a study in a large cancer center estimated
that one-third of hospitalized cancer patients
should receive a palliative care consultation.24
In addition, we found that one-third of palliative
care programs did not have recommended
coverage—personnel available on site during
weekday business hours and by telephone at
all times.2

 gaps, which could explain the low penetration of
services within hospitals and the inability of pro-
grams to provide recommended coverage. Only
one-fourth of programs have a complete team for
palliative care services, based on funded posi-
tions. Larger programs are usually led by physi-
cians, but nearly half of smaller programs rely on
advanced practice and other registered nurses to
lead their teams.
Palliative care programs often rely on volun-
teer and in-kind staff members, particularly in
the positions of chaplain and social worker. It is
not known what impact in-kind unfunded time
has on the other job duties of professionals serv-
ing in palliative care programs. Because the sur-
vey data we used were voluntarily reported and
overrepresented programs in larger hospitals, it
is likely that they have higher staffing levels than
the average among all US hospitals. Thus, our
data may overestimate the adequacy of palliative
care program staffing.
These findings underscore the difficulty of en-
suring that all Americans with serious illnesses
have access to high-quality palliative care ser-
vices. Palliative care physicians are in short sup-
ply,25 and it has been estimated that 18,000 more
of them would be needed to staff current pro-
grams at recommended levels.26 Itis unlikely that
palliative care fellowships can expand sufficient-
ly to fill the gap between current supply and
estimated need.4 Alternative strategies are re-
quired to ensure access to palliative care services
for patients in need.
Access to palliative care could be improved by
enriching all health professionals’ training in
palliative care, particularly in prelicensure edu-
cation programs. Current education programs
do not provide adequate training in palliative
care.3,25 In addition, greater education in inter-
professional teamwork skills is required, be-
cause the care of seriously ill patients with com-
plex conditions is optimally provided by teams.3
Palliative care education needs to include social
work as well as the health professions.27
Midcareer palliative care education can also
play an important role in improving access to
services. Some leaders in the palliative care field
have recommended a midcareer certification for
so-called palliative care champions, who could
provide palliative care consultations when need-
ed, engage in case reviews with board-certified
palliative care physicians, and participate in self-
paced education.4 The acute care setting offers
many opportunities for education in palliative
care,28 and online and video education programs
have proved effective in developing palliative
care knowledge and skills.29–31 To encourage
greater uptake of palliative care education op-
portunities, state licensing boards could encour-
age or even require palliative care education as
part of continuing education requirements.
The Palliative Care and Hospice Education and
Training Act, now pending in Congress, would
amend the Public Health Service Act to increase
the number of palliative care faculty members in
medical schools, nursing schools, social work
schools, and other programs.20 This would in-
crease the capacity of health professions educa-
tion programs to prepare new professionals in
palliative care and might expand opportunities
to develop midcareer and continuing education
in the field. The Bureau of Health Workforce
within
the
Health
Resources
and
Services
Administration can play a role in supporting
palliative care education through its grants
programs.
Access to palliative care services also depends
on the presence of reimbursement policies that
are aligned with the provision of palliative care
consultations and services. The Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has es-
tablished policies and programs that may sup-
port this, such as separate payment for advance
care planning and provisions to allow hospices
in the Medicare Care Choices Model to offer pa-
tients supportive services while continuing to
receive curative treatment.20 Bundled payment
reimbursement could increase the use of pallia-
tive care because of its demonstrated cost sav-
ings.7–14 CMS and private insurers should also
explore reimbursing providers for telehealth
consultations, which could facilitate access to

SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data from the 2012–13 annual surveys of the National Palliative Care
Registry. NOTES A complete team has at least one of the following staff members: physician,
advanced practice registered nurse or registered nurse, chaplain, and social worker (see Note 17
in text). Significance refers to whether each value in a group is significantly different from each
other (for number of annual consultations and number of beds), or as compared with hospitals
that do not have the characteristic (for example, a hospital with an outpatient clinic versus one
without an outpatient clinic). aNot applicable.

Health system managers have a responsibility
to ensure that palliative care is available and of
high quality.3 They can implement programs to
increase access regardless of whether or not they
can maintain a complete palliative care team. For
example, checklists have been developed to iden-
tify patients in need of palliative care consulta-
tion. These can be administered by multiple
types of hospital personnel, streamline the refer-
ral process, and reduce the odds that patients’
needs are missed.23,24,34 Managers should ensure
that their palliative care programs collaborate
with other related hospital programs such as
advance care planning, case management, and
pain services.
Managers also need to be attentive to the risk
of turnover among palliative care personnel.
Palliative care is particularly susceptible to turn-
overbecause of theburnout and stress associated
with the emotional labor of the work—burn-
out rates as high as 62 percent have been re-
ported.35–37 Interventions to promote self-care
strategies have been demonstrated to be effective
at improving stress management and resilien-
cy36,37 and could be supported by employers.
Conclusion
Enhanced and expanded access to palliative care
requires greater attention to the workforce that
provides palliative services. Workforce policy
and palliative care leaders should work together
to identify the areasof greatest need and evaluate
the impact of policies intended to support palli-
ative care. Rapid and sustained efforts in educa-
tion, financing, and health systems management
will be required to prepare the US health work-
force to meet the palliative care needs of a grow-
ing and aging population living with serious and
complex chronic illnesses. ▪
