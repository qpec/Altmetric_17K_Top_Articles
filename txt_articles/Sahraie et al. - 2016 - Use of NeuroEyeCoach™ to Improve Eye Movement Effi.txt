Visual field deficits are common in patients with damaged retinogeniculostriate pathways. The patient‚Äôs eye movements are often
affected leading to inefficient visual search. Systematic eye movement training also called compensatory therapy is needed to
allow patients to develop effective coping strategies. There is a lack of evidence-based, clinical gold-standard registered medical
device accessible to patients at home or in clinical settings and NeuroEyeCoach (NEC) is developed to address this need. In three
experiments, we report on performance of patients on NEC compared to the data obtained previously on the earlier versions of the
search task (ùëõ = 32); we assessed whether the self-administered computerised tasks can be used to monitor the progress (ùëõ = 24)
and compared the findings in a subgroup of patients to a healthy control group. Performance on cancellation tasks, simple visual
search, and self-reported responses on activities of daily living was compared, before and after training. Patients performed similarly
well on NEC as on previous versions of the therapy; the inbuilt functionality for pre- and postevaluation functions was sensitive
to allowing assessment of improvements; and improvements in patients were significantly greater than those in a group of healthy
adults. In conclusion, NeuroEyeCoach can be used as an effective rehabilitation tool to develop compensatory strategies in patients
with visual field deficits after brain injury.
1. Introduction
We explore our surrounding environment by moving our
eyes on average three times per second. The eye movement
episodes are punctuated by brief periods (100‚Äì300 ms) of
fixations. This pattern of activity ensures detailed image
processing by the high density cone-receptor region of our
central vision [1]. The resultant continuous perception of
the stable world relies on amalgamation of lower resolution
peripheral vision with high resolution central information in
a spatiotopic frame of reference [2]. This dynamic process
encompasses the suppression of noise or distractors and
selective enhancement of target objects [3]. The selection of
candidate targets for subsequent eye movements (saccades) is
achieved through a combination of stimulus driven bottom-
up and goal driven top-down mechanisms [4].
Visual field deficits often accompany lesions of the visual
pathways which in turn disrupt the selection of targets falling
within the impaired visual fields [5]. Abnormal patterns of
eye movement are reported in approximately 60% of such
cases [6]. One method for quantifying disturbances of visual
processing is to make use of a visual search paradigm where
the patient is required to report the presence or absence of
a target amongst distractor items, often but not exclusively,
presented on a computer screen [7]. The reaction times
are then compared to those for target detection in the
sighted field in the same individual or in a group of healthy
individuals. The inverse of the slope for a linearly fitted plot
of reaction times as a function of the number of distractor
items reflects ‚Äúsearch efficiency‚Äù [8]. In general, for healthy
adults when targets and distractors are easily discriminable
(pop-out search), the slope is shallow (high efficiency), but

steeper slopes are expected when targets and distractors share
features (complex or conjunction search).
Eye movement recordings of patients with visual field
deficits following brain injury reveal a number of charac-
teristics [9]. These include smaller saccade amplitudes, and,
hence, a larger number of fixations; limited exploration of
the contralesioned visual field; and more between-hemifield
saccades often summarised as disorganised eye movements
leading to slower reaction times for targets in contralesioned
hemifields. Disturbances of eye movement dynamics are also
reported in the sighted (ipsilesioned) hemifield [6, 10].
In clinical practice, the rehabilitation of patients with
visual field deficits is often conducted by occupational ther-
apists or low-vision experts. The aim of any intervention is
to improve the patient‚Äôs interactions with their immediate
surrounding and increasing their confidence in tasks such
as shopping or commuting. The use of computerised visual
search tasks as a rehabilitation tool to improve eye move-
ments after brain injury was first reported in a group of 30
patients [11]. Patients were given systematic practice with
large saccadic eye movements to search for targets presented
at unpredictable positions in both the affected hemifield and
the entire field of gaze. This class of treatment was later
extended by use of a visual search paradigm to improve
scanning strategy. Simultaneous recording of eye movements
in a group of 60 patients provided further evidence for
spatially disorganised pattern of eye movements in 60% of
cases [6], with improved visual scanning in all 13 cases that
underwent visual search training. With better use of the
remaining sight as well as efficient search strategy, patients
were able to compensate for their partial blindness; hence,
the technique has been termed compensatory. This technique
with various modifications has been used in 14 studies to date,
with a total of 593 patients with homonymous visual field loss
and persistent visual disabilities (see Table 1). Indeed a recent
systematic review [12] has identified eye movement training
as the most promising approach to visual rehabilitation in
stroke patients.
The main outcome has been a significant improvement
in visual search performance accompanied by more efficient
oculomotor strategies and a reduction in visual disability as
assessed with standardised questionnaires and behavioural
measures. The treatment effects remained stable and persisted
after 4‚Äì12 weeks of follow-up [18, 19]. The efficacy of this
treatment approach in improving visual search has been
compared to a number of other methods, and although the
findings may not be definitive, they appear to show that the
visual search training is better than reading specific training
[21], nonspecific visual training [17], standard occupational
therapy [20], or counselling with regard to coping strategies
[19]. Importantly, time since brain injury [19] and age of
hemianopic patients [22] did not play a significant role in the
treatment effect. More recently, a compensatory technique
based on tracking a moving target at a constant speed with
a sudden change in its position has also shown improved
eye movement behaviour and faster detection for targets
presented in the blind field [25]. A follow-up study of 78
hemianopic patients showed significant improvements in eye
movements as well as in activities of daily living after 11 days of

training [26]. In one study [23], the level of improvements in
an eye movement training task appeared to be similar to that
of an attention task used as a control. However, in a later study
of 52 patients [24], the revised version of the task combining
search and reading showed significantly more improvements
in search time and reading speed versus a control task.
We have developed NeuroEyeCoach (NEC) with the aim
of providing a standardised protocol for clinical management
of patients using a compensatory technique. The program
systematically increases the task difficulty from a pop-out
to more complex search and finally conjunction searches by
manipulating distractor number and target/distractor simi-
larity. We have ensured that this instrument is appropriate
for use under supervision in clinical settings as well as being
accessible for home use. To facilitate wider access to therapy,
it is Internet deliverable and is self-adaptive by systematic
adjustment of the time allowed for the visual search to reach
predefined level of accuracy.
Here, we report on three observational studies. In the
first study, we report on the comparison of outcomes in
patients using the NEC (ùëõ = 16) compared to the data
obtained previously using the earlier versions of the therapy
[19], showing that NEC leads to a comparable level of
improvement. In the second study, we show evidence that the
patients also show improvements on assessments included
in NEC (ùëõ = 24) and, in a final study, we compare the
changes in visual search in a group of patients (ùëõ = 9) with
those of a similar age control group (ùëõ = 10), when both
groups attended clinical rehabilitation units and conducted
the therapy under supervision. The findings show that the
level of improvement is greater than the effect of practice in
healthy controls.
2. Experiment 1
In this observational study, we compared the performance
on two outcome measures of 16 patients who had undergone
 BioMed Research International
3
compensatory therapy using NEC, supervised and in clinical
settings (experimental group), and 16 matched patients who
had delayed treatment (waiting group) and served as a control
group but were assessed three times as the experimental
group. Patients using NEC were assessed for the fourth time;
however, the control group commenced the therapy shortly
after completing assessment 3. For the delayed treatment
group, we used previous data from our database of 297
patients and selected patients who matched closely to the
treatment group. The groups were matched with respect to
age, time since onset of hemianopia, side and extent of hemi-
anopia, visual field sparing, and degree of impairment with
respect to search performance. The two outcome measures
were time taken to complete a pen and paper version of the
cancellation task and reaction times on a visual search task
([19, pages 78 and 81]). Both outcome measures were repeated
at 4 time periods outlined below. The findings were also
compared to previously reported data [19], in a larger group
of patients using an earlier version of the visual scanning
training program.
2.1. Participants. Thirty-two patients (4F; mean age: 56.6
years; range: 17‚Äì82 years) with either left- (ùëõ = 16) or right-
sided (ùëõ = 16) homonymous hemianopia were monitored.
No patients exhibited signs of visual neglect or suffered from
depressive symptoms. Those with moderate to severe diffi-
culties with attention or memory were excluded. Aetiology
of brain injury causing hemianopia was a left- or right-sided
posterior artery infarction. Mean visual field sparing was 2.5
degrees (SD = 1.3 degrees; range: 1‚Äì6 degrees). Time between
onset of hemianopia and first assessment ranged from 10 to
64 weeks, with an average of 25.1 weeks (SD = 11.2, range: 10‚Äì
48 weeks). The first assessment was followed by a training-
free interval (‚Äúwaiting period‚Äù), with an average duration
of 8 weeks (range: 6‚Äì9 weeks). Training took approximately
2 weeks and a follow-up assessment (assessment 4) was
performed 11 weeks on average (range: 8‚Äì16 weeks) after the
completion of therapy.
2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Assessment Measures. Apart from quantitative visual
field mapping with a T¬®
ubingen perimeter, patients underwent
a comprehensive ophthalmologic and neuropsychological
examination to ensure that they exhibited no additional
visual, oculomotor, or cognitive problems. Visual near and far
acuity was at least 0.8 on Snellen scale (0.1 logMAR).
For assessing visual exploration performance before and
after treatment, we used the same standardised cancellation
task in parallel versions, which we have found sensitive to
changes in visual exploration performance in earlier studies
(Schuett et al., 2012 [21] and Zihl, 2011 [19]). The test consisted
of 20 black diamonds (targets) randomly embedded in 22
black dots and crosses (distractors) on a sheet of white paper.
At a viewing distance of 30 cm, the stimulus array is sub-
tended 44.6 deg horizontally and 35 deg vertically; stimulus
size (diameter) was 0.8 deg. Patients were not informed about
the number of targets but were asked to mark all targets with
a pen as accurately and as quickly as possible with their right
hand. Visual exploration performance was defined as the time
required performing the task, as well as the number of errors.
In addition, we used a standardised questionnaire to assess
subjective experiences before and after treatment similar to
those reported earlier [19]. The questionnaire included three
items (vision too slow, bumping against obstacles, and getting
lost) and three response categories for each item (no/mild
difficulties, moderate difficulties, and severe difficulties). All
the experiments reported were conducted in accordance
with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association
(Declaration of Helsinki) and informed consent had been
obtained from all participants for the use of their data for
research purposes.
2.2.2. Intervention Method. Intervention was performed with
NEC in clinical settings, according to a set procedure. During
the initial software installation, the program uses screen
resolution data and the length of a 400-pixel horizontal and
vertical line, to calculate the screen dimensions and viewing
distance needed such that the screen subtends a minimum
of ¬±20‚àò in horizontal extent. Chin-head-rests were not used
in any of the studies reported; however, for measurements
conducted in the clinic, the supervising therapist controlled
the viewing distance. Those patients attending clinics also
followed the on-screen instructions and the supervising ther-
apist did not interfere in anyway with the patient‚Äôs progress.
As NEC makes use of alphanumeric characters, all users are
initially screened to ensure that they can comfortably see the
items on the screen, starting from a character size subtending
1.4‚àò. The size was increased in 0.1‚àò steps until the letters were
clearly seen up to an upper limit of 1.8‚àò. The therapy program
contains 12 levels, with 4 levels at each of pop-out, complex,
and conjunction search categories. At each level, the task
difficulty was altered by setting the set-size to either 8, 16,
or 24 resulting in 3 discrete sublevels. Examples of pop-out
search include searching for either a T or an X amongst Os
or an H amongst Cs. Complex searches include searching for
an S amongst Cs; an O amongst Gs; or a B amongst Ds. Both
target shape and colour were altered in conjunction searches
(searching for green X, amongst blue Xs and green Rs; a green
b amongst blue bs and green ps; or a green T amongst blue
Ts and green upside-down Ts). Target and distractors were
equally distributed on the left and right half and the upper
and lower parts of the screen and an example of the target
item was always presented in the middle of the screen within
an orange coloured circle. Progression to the subsequent level
was contingent upon achieving 85% or higher in accuracy in
at least 2 of the 3 sublevels. Each sublevel took approximately
15 minutes to complete and consisted of 200 trials with targets
being present in 100 trials. The patient‚Äôs task was to indicate
whether or not a specific target was present by pressing one
of two mouse buttons. The time allowed for each trial was
limited (1500 ms) but increased by 500 ms, if a level had to be
repeated (i.e., performance below 85% correct in 2 sublevels).
Unlimited time for response was provided, if the patient failed
to achieve the accuracy threshold for passing a level for the
second time. Patients participated NEC-training on a regular
basis, with at least 5 sessions per week. Sessions lasted on
average 45 min (sufficient to complete one level), with short
 4

(1-2 min) breaks after approximately 15 min, depending on
their level of fatigue/alertness.
2.3. Results. All data were analyzed using IBMÔøΩ SPSSÔøΩ Statis-
tics 20. Demographical and clinical data were statistically
analyzed using ùúí2-test for gender and side of hemianopia
and ùë°-tests for independent groups with a significance level
of ùëù ‚â§ 0.05. Statistical data analysis of time taken to complete
the cancellation task and visual search reaction time for
target present trials before and after treatment (experimental
group) or waiting period (control group) of the total group
of patients was performed using a two-factorial ANOVA with
repeated measurements, Greenhouse-Geisser correction, and
a significance level of ùëù ‚â§ 0.05. Statistical comparisons of the
time taken to complete the cancellation task and visual search
reaction time for target present trials within and between
groups were performed with ùë°-tests and all reported ùëù values
of these two analyses are Bonferroni corrected at ùëù ‚â§ 0.02.
Subjects in the experimental and control groups did not
differ significantly with respect to sex (ùúí2(1) = 0.00, ùëù = 1.00),
age (ùë°(30) = ‚àí0.31, ùëù = 0.759), side of hemianopia (ùúí2(1)
= 0.00, ùëù = 1.00), visual field sparing (ùë°(24.73) = 1.57, ùëù =
0.130), and time since injury (ùë°(30) = ‚àí0.55, ùëù = 0.586). Mean
number of training sessions to complete NEC was 13 (range:
9‚Äì20).
Regarding the cancellation task, ANOVA showed a sig-
nificant main effect for repeated measurements (ùêπ(1, 30)
= 56.83; ùëù
<
0.001) but not for group (ùêπ(1, 30) = 3.51;
ùëù = 0.071). The interaction between repeated measurements
√ó group was significant (ùêπ(1, 30) = 48.54; ùëù
<
0.001).
ANOVA for visual search revealed similar effects: there was
a significant main effect for repeated measurements (ùêπ(1, 30)
= 75.67; ùëù < 0.001) but not for group (ùêπ(1, 30) = 1.57; ùëù =
0.221). The interaction between repeated measurements √ó
group was significant (ùêπ(1, 30) = 57.06, ùëù < 0.001).
Table 2 shows the results of performance of the various
assessments for the experimental and the control groups.
In the experimental group, there was a small (‚àí3.0 s; 6%),
significant (ùë°(15) = 4.01; ùëù < 0.001) change in time taken to
complete the cancellation task between the first and second
assessment (waiting period); no significant change was found
in the visual search task (ùë°(15) = 1.03; ùëù = 0.320). After
training (assessment 3), we found a significant (ùë°(15) = 7.93;
ùëù < 0.01) decrease in search time in the cancellation task
(‚àº31%) and in the visual search task (‚àº27%; ùë°(15) = 8.90; ùëù <
0.01). Accuracy was perfect (100%) in 9 patients at assessment
2 (before treatment); the rest (ùëõ = 7) omitted 2 targets on
average in either task (range: 1‚Äì6). In assessment 3 (after
training), 12 patients showed perfect accuracy in both tasks,
while four patients omitted still some targets (M = 1.5; range:
1‚Äì3). Performance in both tasks did not differ significantly
between assessments 3 and 4 (after treatment and at follow-
up) (cancellation: ùë°(15) = ‚àí1.15; ùëù = 0.267; visual search:
ùë°(15) = 1.27; ùëù = 0.224). In the control group, we did not find
significant changes in reaction times at assessments 1 and 2
(before and after the waiting period) in the cancellation task
(ùë°(15) = 0.73; ùëù = 0.478) and visual search task times (ùë°(15) =
1.4, ùëù = 0.181). It is important to note that experimental and

the visual search task.

control groups did not differ significantly at assessments 1 and
2 (before treatment/waiting period), either on time taken to
complete the cancellation task (ùë°(30) = ‚àí1.17, ùëù = 0.251) or
for visual search times (ùë°(30) = ‚àí0.40, ùëù = 0.694).
At assessment 1 (before the waiting period), cancellation
and visual search performance was accurate (100%) in 10
patients; the rest omitted 1 target on average (range: 1‚Äì3).
At assessment 2 (end of the waiting period), 9 patients
performed accurately, while the rest (7 patients) omitted 1
target on average (range: 1‚Äì4).
Subjective reports support the observed positive outcome
in scanning (see Table 3). At assessment 2 (before treatment),
all hemianopic subjects (100%) reported at least moderate dif-
ficulties; at assessment 3 (after treatment), the rate decreased
to 40% (4 subjects); at assessment 4 (follow-up), the rate
was 12.5% (two subjects). The most frequent response was
‚Äúvision is too slow,‚Äù followed by ‚Äúbumping into objects‚Äù
and ‚Äúgetting lost.‚Äù In contrast, the patients in the control
group at assessment 3 compared to assessment 2 reported
a much lower decrease in vision related difficulties (100%
versus 81.3%).
For a better ‚Äúgrading‚Äù of the results of this study, we
have placed the findings qualitatively in the context of the
outcome measure previously obtained using a similar method
 BioMed Research International
5
of systematic eye movement training in a larger group (ùëõ =
117) of hemianopic subjects [19]. The outcome is similar with
respect to search times in both tasks. In the earlier study,
improvement in scanning speed in the cancellation task
was ‚àº43% and in the visual search task ‚àº25%, respectively
compared to 31% and 27% reported here (accuracy was also
comparable). The smaller number of training sessions in the
earlier study (10 versus 13 on average) can be explained by
the fact that, in the earlier version of scanning training, the
therapist decided when the next level was reached on a more
variable criterion.
In summary, the findings show that NEC can lead to
improved visual search in patients with partial blindness after
brain injury. In addition, the improvement in visual scanning
as assessed with cancellation and visual search tasks strictly
depended on systematic treatment, because no significant
changes in performance in the two tasks were found in the
waiting group. In addition, the overall effect of using NEC
appears to be similar to the previous compensatory therapy
based on visual search with the added advantage of having
set criteria for progression to different levels of difficulty.
3. Experiment 2
We have established that, similar to those patients using
the previous versions of the program, those undergoing eye
movement training by use of NEC also show improvements
assessed using the previously reported outcome measures
(visual search times and pen and paper based cancellation
task). Here, we report on an additional group of patients
(ùëõ = 24) undergoing eye movement training using NEC.
This time the outcome measures used to assess the therapy
related changes were an integral part of the NEC. Therefore,
patients completed the pre- and post-assessments included
in the NEC program on a computer and unsupervised. These
included a computer-based version of the cancellation task
and a standard visual search task as well as filling out an
activity of daily living questionnaire (ADL, described below).
This ADL has been developed specifically for this patient
group and the findings previously reported in the literature
[14, 27]. In this observational study, we aimed to determine
if this additional cohort of patients also benefits from visual
search training and whether the changes are measurable
using the incorporated pre- and post-assessments.
3.1.
Participants. Twenty-four participants (8F; mean age
58.5; SD = 17.9; range: 15‚Äì80) made use of the NeuroEyeCoach
program either at home (15 cases) or within a rehabilitation
clinic (9 cases). The participants had a visual field defect on
the left (ùëõ = 8), right (ùëõ = 12), or both hemifields (ùëõ = 4; i.e.,
bilateral upper or lower quadrantanopia). The time between
the onset of the field defect and the first training session
ranged from 3 to 170 months with an average of 45.5 months
(SD = 48.6).
3.2. Methods
Pre- and Post-assessments. NeuroEyeCoach program incor-
porates a series of baseline assessments, in order to quantify
the scanning behaviour. The visual search performance was
measured for detection of a black O amongst black Ts and
Ls. For 10 trials, patients were asked to report the presence
or absence of a black O amongst 4 distractors (2Ls and 2Ts)
using either of two mouse buttons (or left and right arrow
keys). They then completed 4 blocks of 20 trials at set-sizes
of 4, 8, 16, and 24. The pre- and post-training RT figure are
the mean of median reaction times from all blocks. The total
number of errors in all blocks is also used to compare pre- and
post-training errors. During the cancellation task, patients
were shown three different screens each containing 20 targets
(e.g., diamonds) and 23 non-targets (e.g., 13 circles and 10
stars). The task was to click the mouse button on targets and
press the space-bar when they had found all targets. When
all the targets were highlighted, the timer would stop and
the next set of instructions would appear. The cancellation
task score is the median of the three measurements. This
task was also repeated after training. Patients also reported
their perceived disability on a 5-point scale for performing
various activities of daily living. The nine questions were
difficulties seeing obstacles; bumping into obstacles; losing
their way; finding objects on a table; finding objects in a room;
finding objects in a supermarket; crossing the road; using
public transport; or using a computer. The rating scale ranged
from no difficulty at all (1) to occasional (2), sometime (3),
often (4), or having severe difficulties (5). Patients performed
all the assessment tasks once again after completing the
NeuroEyeCoach program.
3.3. Results. The study is of repeated-measure design with 5
factors of scores on cancellation task, errors on visual search,
visual search reaction time, reaction time for target absent
trials, and self-reported disability, all being obtained twice,
once before the start of the training and once after completing
training.
The duration of training for those completing the pro-
gram in the clinical setting or online was on average 13.1 (SD
= 1.76) and 14.0 (SD = 1.96) sessions, respectively.
Patients rated their perceived problems with performing
activities of daily living significantly less after the training
(M = 13.21, SD = 5.34) than before the training (M = 18.47,
SD = 6.63) (ùë°(18) = 4.381, ùëù < 0.001, both latter measures
significantly higher than the critical ùë°-value for Bonferroni
correction (ùë° = 2.574)).
Paired-sample ùë°-tests were conducted to compare the
performance before and after the therapy on the time taken
to complete the cancellation task, number of errors in visual
search, and the disability score. The time taken to perform the
cancellation task on the computer screen before (M = 44.5 s,
SD = 38.5) and after (M = 41.6 s, SD = 35.3) training was not
significantly different (ùëù = 0.267). However, patients made
significantly fewer errors after the training (M = 3.42, SD
= 4.47) than before training (M = 9.17, SD = 5.76), ùë°(23) =
4.848, ùëù < 0.001 on the visual search task.
Performance on the reaction times (RT) on visual search
tasks was analyzed using a 2 √ó 2 repeated-measure ANOVA
with a within subject factor mean RT (2 levels, in target
present trials and in target absent trials) and Time (2 levels,
before and after training). There were significant main effects

of RT (ùêπ(1, 23) = 167.6, ùëù < 0.001) and time (ùêπ(1, 23) =
11.48, ùëù = 0.003) but no significant interaction (ùêπ(1, 23) =
0.312, ùëù = 0.581). Paired-sample ùë°-tests indicated that post-
training visual search times (M = 957 ms, SD = 182) were
faster than the pre-training (M = 1125 ms, SD = 304), ùë°(23)
= 4.167, ùëù < 0.001. Patients‚Äô reaction times in ‚Äúno target
present‚Äù trials was also significantly shorter after the training
(M = 1491 ms, SD = 312) than before (M = 1637 ms,
SD = 428) (ùë°(23) = 1.795, ùëù = 0.022). Both reaction time
parameters show that patients are significantly faster after
training on the visual search task. It is also noteworthy that
they also made significantly less errors in the visual search
task; therefore, the improvements in reaction time cannot
be attributed to the speed-accuracy trade-off. A summary of
the findings discussed above is shown in Figure 1. A better
visual search strategy may underline the improved speed in
detecting a target in target present trials during visual search.
However, the reasons for improvements in reaction times to
report the absence of a target are more complex. Of course,
it is possible that, following systematic training, patients are
faster in searching the entire screen for a target and therefore
also improve in reporting its absence in the target absent
trials. However, as the reaction time in target absent trials
can also be affected by other factors such as subjective bias
and confidence, it may also be the case that, following practice
and over repeated exposures, the patients are more confident
(hence faster) in reporting the absence of a target.
In summary, the findings show that this cohort of patients
also benefitted from eye movement training. The training
led to faster visual search times, reduction in the number of
errors made, and improvements in reported activities of daily
living. The computer-based cancellation task, however, was
not sufficiently sensitive to detecting the behavioural changes.
4. Experiment 3
We have demonstrated that, similar to the previously
reported findings, systematic training on visual search tasks
can lead to shorter search times and improved responses
on activities of daily living in patients with partial blindness
subsequent to brain injury. In almost any psychophysical task,
the performance can improve with repeated practice. The
extent of such perceptual learning in normal observers is
often limited. This is due to the fact that one may consider
that the normal observers already perform at optimum.
As the patients also have a much slower search time after
brain injury, the baseline measures between the patients and
normal observers differ significantly. One way of comparing
the effect of training in the two groups would be to normalise
the improvements as a fraction of the baseline performance.
In a third experiment, we have compared the level of
improvements in search times of a group of patients with
those of healthy controls of a similar age to investigate the
extent of changes in both cohorts.
4.1. Participants. In order to ensure that both patients and
normal controls conduct the training under similar condi-
tions, we have compared performance of all those patients
who attended a rehabilitation clinic on daily basis (ùëÅ =
9) and their data was included in Experiment 2 with those
of a similar age range healthy controls who also attended
a rehabilitation clinic again on daily basis. We recruited 10
healthy observers (5F, mean age 60.5 years, SD = 9.5, and
range 47‚Äì77) and their data compared to the group of 9
patients (2F, mean age 58 years, SD = 19.1, and range 26‚Äì80).
For recruitment of the control group, ethical approval was
granted by the ethics review, School of Psychology, University
of Aberdeen, and informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
4.2. Method. Healthy observers attended the Neuropsycho-
logical Day Clinic at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry
in Munich (Germany; same as for Experiment 1) for five
days per week and were paid for their participation. They
received the same instructions as those of the patient group.
The healthy control group and patients underwent the same
training by completing NEC on the same apparatus and
clinical settings. All participants completed the pre- and post-
assessments on the online version of NEC (as described in
Experiment 2) and the control group did not report any
disability.
4.3. Results. Performance on the reaction times (RT) on
visual search tasks was analyzed using a 2 √ó 2 repeated-
measure ANOVA with a within subject factor, mean RT (2
levels, in target present trials and in target absent trials)
 BioMed Research International

and time (2 levels, before and after training). There were
significant main effects of RT (ùêπ(1, 8) = 150.6, ùëù < 0.001) and
time (ùêπ(1, 8) = 14.12, ùëù = 0.006) but no significant interaction
(ùêπ(1, 8) = 2.50, ùëù = 0.153). After completing NEC, patients
had significantly faster search reaction time (M = 1041 ms,
SD = 134) than before training (M = 1357 ms, SD = 273) (ùë°(8)
= 5.09, ùëù = 0.001). Reaction times for reporting target absent
trials after the training (M = 1645, SD = 176) were also shorter
than before training (M = 1894, SD = 340) (ùë°(8) = 2.73,
ùëù = 0.026), but this is below critical ùë°-value for Bonferroni
multiple comparison (critical ùë°(8) = 3.206; 4 comparisons).
Similarly, healthy controls also had faster visual search
times after training (M = 598 ms, SD = 103) than before
(M = 666, SD = 106) and this difference was significant (ùë°(9)
= 3.53, ùëù = 0.006). However, their reaction times in target
absent trials (M = 754, SD = 147) were not significantly
shorter after than before the training (M = 842, SD = 202),
(ùë°(9) = 1.32, ùëù = 0.22).
As both patients and controls improved in search times
following training, we were interested to establish if the
magnitude of improvements was comparable between the
two groups. Overall, the patient group improved more (M =
313 ms, SD = 184) than the control group (M = 68 ms, SD =
60). An independent-sample ùë°-test was conducted to inves-
tigate whether this difference was significant. Levene‚Äôs test
for equality of variance showed that the two variances were
significantly different (ùêπ = 8.643, ùëù = 0.009); therefore, the
degrees of freedom for the independent-sample ùë°-test were
adjusted accordingly. The patient group showed significantly
more reduction of their search times than the control group
(ùë°(9.56) = 3.802, ùëù = 0.004). It is, however, important to note
that the visual search times were significantly longer (both
before and after training) in the patient group compared to
the normal controls. Therefore, we have accounted for this
disparity by calculating the improvement in reaction times
as a percentage of the visual search time before training.
This analysis also showed that the patient group improved
significantly more (M = 21.8%, SD = 9.8%) than the control
group (M = 10.1%, SD = 8.3) (ùë°(17) = 2.82, ùëù = 0.012).
The following observations may also be noteworthy. For
the group of 9 patients, we also analyzed the visual search
times in trials where the target was present in their sighted
field compared to the blind field. The search times for sighted
field presentations in the patient group before the training
(M = 1182, SD = 216) and after training (M = 944, SD = 130)
were much slower than those for normal controls, further
emphasising that the processing in the normal hemifield is
also affected after brain injury. However, on average, patients
made less improvements in their sighted field (M = 17.7%,
SE = 6%) compared to their blind field (M = 25.1%, SE =
4%), although this difference is not significant, probably due
to small sample size.
5. Discussion
We have reported on the outcome of NeuroEyeCoach (NEC),
designed to be used both in clinical settings and by patients
in the home environment. In a series of three experiments,
we have shown that improvements in visual search following
NEC are similar to those reported in earlier versions of
the program [19]. The findings from Experiment 2 indicate
that NEC is an effective compensatory approach for those
with homonymous visual field loss and improved subjective
activities of daily living. The absence of a significant improve-
ment in the NEC cancellation task may be related to the
degree of difficulty that patient may experience in using a
computer mouse to click on objects on a screen compared
with conventional pen and paper version. Therefore, in
clinical practice, the pen and paper task may be a more
appropriate measure to monitor the improvement. Also, it
is likely that this shortcoming might be bypassed by using
a touch sensitive screen for recording pointing responses to
visual items and we intend to test this in further studies.
Finally, Experiment 3 showed that the use of NEC in patients
can lead to more than twice the magnitude of improvements
compared to normal controls, even when accounting for the
overall noisier and slower performance of the patients. It
should be noted, however, that improvements in patients
and normal subjects might be qualitatively different. While
normal subjects might benefit from an improved preexisting
scanning strategy in terms of speed, patients with homony-
mous visual field loss benefitted because they regained an
effective scanning strategy to substitute for the lost visual
field, which is a crucial prerequisite for grasping the actual
surrounding with high accuracy and speed. It is important
to note that the visual search times in patients still remained
slower than the healthy controls. Further studies are required
to investigate both the limits of recovery and the factors
affecting its extent.
Compensatory approaches to visual rehabilitation in
partially sighted patients are aimed at increasing eye move-
ment efficiency, allowing the patients to better explore their
environment and to make the most of their remaining sighted
field. A large body of evidence (see Table 1), including
randomized control trials [17, 20, 24] has shown that patients
benefit from systematic eye movement training. In Lane et
al. [23], patients‚Äô improvements were not significantly more
than those found after an attention training task; however,
results in line with other investigations were found in their
later study [24]. Almost all previous studies of compensatory
therapies make use of visual search tasks. Use of visual search
in improving search efficiency of hemianopic patients was
first reported in 1988 [11]. Other than its use in various forms
in a limited number of rehabilitation clinics over the past
25 years, there has been a marked lack of availability of
an effective evidence-based gold-standard registered medical
device accessible to patients at home or in clinical settings. In
clinical practice, this void has been filled by using a number
of devices that originally had been designed to address other
problems, hence being suboptimum for rehabilitation of
vision loss. Devices such as Dynavision (dynavisioninterna-
tional.com) or Sanet Vision Integrator (SVI, svivision.com)
were originally designed for improving athletes‚Äô performance
on visuomotor tasks, effectively enhancing their reaching
behaviour. For example, in Dynavision, training consists of
asking an individual to reach out to a lit-target on a large
board, a task similar to a simple pop-out search. In the
case of SVI, a more elaborate set of targets can be reached
 8
BioMed Research International
as the device makes use of computer display technology;
nevertheless, in both cases there is an absence of a set
of systematically developed protocols, specific to visually
impaired patients. An effective intervention would need to
be adaptable to the patient‚Äôs performance such that the task
difficulty is altered to encourage the patient to improve on
the task. Also, should the patient find the task excessively
difficult, it would need to be systematically modified to avoid
fatigue and despondency. We have addressed both these
points in the design of NEC. The criterion for progress is also
automated to ensure a systematic approach to rehabilitation.
In NEC, the task difficulty increases monotonically with con-
secutive training sessions. This is achieved by changing the
set-size and target/distractor similarity. Other devices such
as Bioness Integrated Therapy Systems (BIONES Inc., USA)
have also attempted to modify task difficulty by using word
searches. However, as reading difficulties are often comorbid
with visual field defects [19, 21], this approach confounds
hemianopia and dyslexia, making it less appropriate for a
large proportion of patients.
In clinical practice, improving a patient‚Äôs condition or
alleviating the disability is of prime importance. In the
absence of a standardised approach, clinical tools stated above
are used by occupational therapists and rehabilitation work-
ers to help the patients and improve their interactions with
their immediate environment. NeuroEyeCoach is specifically
designed for compensatory therapy, it is evidence based
and relies on a body of previous studies showing improved
eye movement efficiency in hemianopic patients. We have
demonstrated that it is on a par with its earlier version
used previously in clinical settings. Importantly, as it is web-
deliverable, it can also be used unsupervised in the home
environment.
