1 Introduction
Respiratory disease, including lung cancer, is the leading 
cause of death in the UK, accounting for 920,000 disa-
bility-adjusted life years lost [10]. It is the most frequent 
cause of disease in primary care in all age groups and the 
second most common cause of chronic conditions.
For patients who report to A&E, a quick and low-cost 
method of assessment is required. One process currently 
used to assess respiratory disease in a low-cost and time-
effective manner is spirometry [14]. Spirometry allows for 
the measurement of expired airflow from the lungs, ena-
bling physicians to better characterise the cause of breath-
lessness and to assess progression of respiratory disease 
over time.
However, spirometry can have significant limitations. 
Firstly, forced spirometric efforts allow assessment of ini-
tial diaphragm/muscle strength and can only measure total 
airflow in and out of the lungs; it therefore provides a lim-
ited amount of feedback and does not allow physicians to 
identify motion at the chest and the relative contribution 
of different areas of each lung to the subjects’ respira-
tory function [16]. This is particularly important in sub-
jects with more focal lung abnormalities, such as emphy-
sematous bullae, collapsed lung segments and previous 
surgical lung resection. Secondly, the effect of chest wall 
Abstract  Respiratory disease is the leading cause of 
death in the UK. Methods for assessing pulmonary func-
tion and chest wall movement are essential for accurate 
diagnosis, as well as monitoring response to treatment, 
operative procedures and rehabilitation. Despite this, there 
is a lack of low-cost devices for rapid assessment. Spirom-
etry is used to measure air flow expired, but cannot infer or 
directly measure full chest wall motion. This paper presents 
the development of a low-cost chest wall motion assess-
ment system. The prototype was developed using four 
Microsoft Kinect sensors to create a 3D time-varying rep-
resentation of a patient’s torso. An evaluation of the system 
in two phases is also presented. Initially, static volume of a 
resuscitation mannequin with that of a Nikon laser scanner 
is performed. This showed the system has slight underpre-
diction of 0.441 %. Next, a dynamic analysis through the 
comparison of results from the prototype and a spirometer 
in nine cystic fibrosis patients and thirteen healthy subjects 
was performed. This showed an agreement with correla-
tion coefficients above 0.8656 in all participants. The sys-
tem shows promise as a method for assessing respiratory

abnormalities, such as respiratory muscle weakness and 
pectus excavatum, as well as diaphragm movement can-
not be assessed by spirometry [21]. Thirdly, since it is an 
effort-dependent procedure, there is a potential for inaccu-
rate results in subjects unable to reliably perform a forced 
expiratory manoeuvre [12] (e.g. children, the elderly and 
subjects with hearing impairments, learning difficulties or a 
language barrier). Fourthly, subjects with facial abnormali-
ties or muscle weakness are often unable to form a tight 
seal around the mouthpiece, preventing spirometry being 
accurately performed [8].
As a result of these limitations, there has been increas-
ing interest in the development of alternative methods of 
assessing respiratory function, including chest wall motion 
analysis. Systems such as magnetometers [17], respiratory 
inductance plethysmography [13], optoelectronic plethys-
mography [1, 4] (OEP) and structured light plethysmog-
raphy [5] (SLP) have been demonstrated for this purpose; 
however, these technologies have been shown can be cum-
bersome, expensive, time consuming, difficult to interpret 
and not suited to the clinical environment. A more recent 
method for evaluating chest wall motion is through the use 
of the Microsoft Kinect technology (a low-cost motion 
tracking camera). This system is portable, low cost, non-
invasive and has been suggested as an alternative for 
spirometry [3] with positive correlations being shown (Ye 
et al. 2012 show correlations of r = 0.966 [24]). However, 
research demonstrating the use of this technology utilises 
a one-camera version of the system [3, 7, 23, 24]. This 
method follows a process of monitoring the chest wall only 
and detecting changes in surface. The issue with this is that 
motion may affect the sample, particularly large move-
ments during analysis. In addition, it is difficult to compart-
mentalise different parts of the torso and also calculate vol-
umes of the whole or parts of the torso.
This paper reports the development of a low-cost and 
time-effective novel prototype for capturing dynamic chest 
wall motion using four Microsoft Kinect sensors. An ini-
tial evaluation of this prototype is also presented, involving 
healthy volunteers and adults with cystic fibrosis (an inher-
ited condition causing progressive respiratory failure) [20].

Methods
2.1  
System design
This research created a system which was capable of 
assessing respiratory motion using a low-cost and time-
effective motion tracking device. The device to be used was 
the Microsoft Kinect, which is a human tracking periph-
eral used in the gaming industry for the Microsoft Xbox to 
provide low-cost 3D motion capture capabilities [6]. The 
device is composed of an infrared (IR) laser projector, an 
IR camera, a colour camera and a microphone array. The 
Kinect uses the IR projector to detect distance of an object 
from the sensor by emitting a single infrared beam which 
is split to create an invisible pattern of speckles [11]. This 
pattern is captured by the IR camera and compared against 
a reference pattern stored in the device to calculate distance 
from external objects. This study utilised four of these 
devices to create three-dimensional representations of a 
subject’s torso over time, so difference could be calculated 
by comparing the difference between frames.
2.2  
System evaluation: static analysis methods
In order to evaluate the derived system, static testing was 
initially performed to evaluate overall accuracy of the sys-
tem. A cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training man-
nequin was used as the evaluation object, of which volume 
could be calculated. This was a torso-type mannequin 
measuring 63.5 cm in height and weighing 3.9 kg.
Initially, the mannequin was recorded five times by the 
developed, Kinect-based system in a room with mainly 
artificial light. Each capture lasted approximately 15 s.
Next, a Nikon Metrology MCA 2400 M7 articulated arm 
laser scanner (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture 
complete detailed geometric scans. Single point accuracy of 
the scanner is 0.031 mm, and length accuracy is 0.042 mm 
with an uncertainty of ±2σ. A typical scan path for the laser 
device can capture up to 72,000 points per second.
Results from the two scans were then compared for 
static volume estimation.
To make a comparison between the Kinect-based sys-
tem and Nikon laser scanner, initially a root mean square 
(RMS) error was calculated, including mean and mode. 
Probability density and cumulative density function are 
then also utilised to assess estimate errors and bias.
2.3  
System evaluation: dynamic capture methods
Chest wall motion was measured with the developed, 
Kinect-based system, whilst participants simultaneously 
performed spirometry using a MicroLab Spirometer (Care-
Fusion Corp, San Diego, USA).
Spirometry was performed according to ATS/ERS 
guidelines [14]. CareFusion Spirometry PC Software ver-
sion 1.07 (CareFusion Corp, San Diego, USA) was used to 
store patient information and spirometry results.
Nine subjects with cystic fibrosis were recruited at the 
West Midlands Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre and 13 healthy 
volunteers from staff at Heart of England NHS Foundation 
Trust.

The acquisition protocol involved capturing quiet breath-
ing for 20 s, followed by a relaxed vital capacity (VC) 
manoeuver (maximum inspiration and expiration) and fol-
lowed by 20 s of quiet breathing. The test was run three 
times per patient, as per ATS/ERS guidelines. Males were 
captured bare-chested, whilst females wore tight t-shirts 
for modesty. From total chest wall volumes acquired by 
the Kinect-based device, the following parameters were 
obtained: tidal volume (VT), as the total chest wall vol-
ume variation, respiratory rate (RR) and minute ventilation 
(VT × RR).
In order to process the spirometry readings for analysis, 
some data required additional processing. Initially, spirom-
etry data and time stamps were imported into MATLAB. 
The time series captured needed a shape-preserving piece-
wise cubic interpolation procedure to ensure a constant 
sampling rate (5 Hz). A fourth-order zero-phase band-pass 
Butterworth filter [0.025–1 Hz] was applied.
The two volume time series were aligned by searching 
for the peak in their cross-correlation function. A meas-
ure of similarity was needed to compare the two time 
series over a window of interest. The range for compari-
son was set at −8 to 14 s relative to the maximum point 
on the relaxed VC measurement. This window length was 
the largest possible to ensure all subjects tested had suffi-
cient overlap in the time series recorded. The Pearson prod-
uct moment correlation coefficient was chosen as a simple 
measure of similarity:
where cov(vK, vS) is covariance between the Kinect-based 
and spirometry-based volume estimates and the σK and 
ρ = cov(vK, vS)
σKσS
σS are their respective standard deviations. It takes values 
at ±1 and at its extremes this corresponds to data points 
lying perfectly on a line. A summary of all of the corre-
lation coefficients obtained between the Kinect-based and 
spirometry measurements for the two groups (healthy sub-
jects and CF patients) is presented. This is followed by a 
one-way ANOVA to compare sample means between the 
two groups. Finally, a TLS fitting procedure is used to com-
pare results from the Kinect-based system and spirometry 
measurements.
The research study was approved by the Local Research 
Ethics Committee (reference number: 10/H1202/58). 
Informed consent was obtained from all involved par-
ticipants, and the study conforms to the Declaration of 
Helsinki.

Results
3.1  
System implementation
To enable chest wall motion analysis, a system comprising 
four Kinect sensors was developed and orientated as shown 
in Fig. 1. The Kinect sensors were placed around the sub-
ject, ensuring a minimum distance of 1 metre, following 
recommendations from Alnowami et al. [2].
Each Kinect sensor was connected to a PC using an 
independent and dedicated USB bus. The general settings 
of the system allowed for 30 frames per second to be cap-
tured in 320 × 240 pixels for each sensor.
A bespoke software application was designed, using the 
Kinect Software Development Kit (SDK) 1.6 (Microsoft, 
Redmond, USA) which assisted the process.

In order to calibrate the system, a static object was 
placed in the middle of the four Kinects. The bespoke soft-
ware was used to take a scan using each Kinect individu-
ally, with the other cameras turned off, to avoid interference 
from competing infrared laser projectors. The four separate 
scans taken from each Kinect were then exported from the 
bespoke software and imported into the meteorology soft-
ware Geomagic Studio 2012. This software allowed for 
the four images to be aligned using in-built functionality to 
map the four images, and form a point cloud. This resulted 
in a transformation matrix being created which detailed the 
transformations of each of the original four scans. These 
were then exported back to the bespoke software.
At this point, a patient could be placed in between the 
four cameras and a recording taken of their torso, using 
the bespoke software. The images at each frame, from 
each camera, were combined using the previously gener-
ated transformation matrix from the calibration step. This 
formed a set of 3D point clouds at each frame captured, 
from which change in volume could be calculated, by com-
paring the point cloud at each frame.
In order to perform this calculation, Geomagic Studio 
2012 was utilised again, using a set macro which was cre-
ated. This allowed for a repetition of the same task, which 
included loading each of the point clouds which were 
exported from the bespoke software, building a 3D mesh 
(triangles and normals), filling any holes in the mesh and 
using the mesh doctor to smooth the resulting object. The 
user is asked to manually define the limits of the analysis 
before this macro is run, placing a bounding box around 
an initial image to limit volume calculations to the torso 
only. These limits are then applied to all meshes within the 
analysis. This process also helps to eliminate noise from 
outside the bounding box. An example of a scan taken of a 
mannequin is shown in Fig. 2.
A 3D model is created for each subsequent frame, and 
this allows change in volume in the torso to be detected. 
An example of the change in volume in a model is shown 
in Fig. 3.
In order to achieve this, a ply file was stored for each 
point cloud. 3D volume data and the individual frame time 
stamps for all four Kinect sensors were exported from Geo-
magic and imported into MATLAB R2012B (version 8.0) 
(MathWorks, Natick, USA). Volumes were calculated using 
a fast algorithm in MATLAB [19]. Occasional misalign-
ment with the four camera time stamps caused errors in the 
3D reconstruction of the chest wall volume. This occurred 
as the clocks for the four Kinect sensors cannot be synchro-
nised with the drivers supplied in the Microsoft SDK. An

algorithm was implemented to detect sudden sharp changes 
in volume, making the assumption that these were arte-
facts. The resulting 3D volume time series did not have a 
constant sampling rate, due to both the artefact removal 
process and the way the Kinect sensor captures data. 
Therefore, a shape-preserving, piecewise cubic interpola-
tion procedure [9] was used to construct from the original 
time series one with a constant sampling rate of 30 Hz. A 
fourth-order zero-phase band-pass Butterworth filter [22] 
[0.025–1 Hz] was used to remove noise and emphasise the 
frequency region of interest, and a further down-sampling 
procedure was applied to reduce the sampling rate to 5 Hz. 
This also removed the static volume of each subject under 
test and only estimated the dynamic volume.
3.2  
System evaluation: static analysis results
The mannequin was successfully scanned by the Nikon 
Metrology laser scanner and the Kinect-based system.
The estimates from the Kinect-based system were pro-
cessed, and the gold standard reference volume (22.751 l) 
from the Nikon Metrology scanner was subtracted. The 
root mean square (RMS) error for the Kinect-based esti-
mate was εRMS = 0.100 litres to three decimal places, cor-
responding to an error of 0.441 %. The mean of the error is 
0.0626 l and the mode (most common value) 0.0216 l.
Figure 4 shows the empirical probability density and 
cumulative density function (CDF) (blue curves) of the 
Kinect-based volume estimate errors. It can be seen that the 
error distribution is skewed with a long right tail (indicat-
ing underestimation) and has a nonzero mean and mode 
(indicating bias). Taken together, these make it more likely 
that the volume is underestimated with the Kinect sen-
sors. A series of probability distributions were fitted, and 
the best was chosen based on Akaike information criterion 
(AIC). This corresponded to a generalised extreme value 
distribution, as it could adequately model the long right 
tail seen in the empirical results. Figure 4 also shows the 
fitted generalised extreme value distribution (red curve) 
and a fitted normal/Gaussian distribution (black curve) for 
reference.
The probability density function for the generalised 
extreme value distribution was given by:
where µ ∈ is a location parameter, σ > 0 a scale parameter 
and k ∈ a shape parameter. The fitted parameter values and 
their lower and upper 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were 
found to be:
μ = 0.0252 [0.0220, 0.0284] (location);
σ = 0.0580 [0.0557, 0.060] (scale);
k = 0.0641 [0.0231, 0.1051] (shape).
The cumulative density function was given by:

 (i.e.

the error ε < 0.215, with a probability of (F=) 0.95, and 
the error ε < −0.0363, with a probability of 0.05, were 
obtained. It is thus possible to define the 95 % error bounds 
for static volume estimation as −0.0363 < ε < 0.2150.

System evaluation: dynamic capture results
Scans using the developed system, and simultaneous 
spirometry readings, were successfully taken of nine sub-
jects with cystic fibrosis and 13 healthy volunteers. Table 1 
presents the demographics of the study participants.
Figure 5 shows a representative example of the Kinect-
based system (solid blue line) and spirometry (solid red 
line) measurements obtained during periods of VC measure-
ment and relaxed breathing in an individual subject. Both 
data series show estimated 95 % CI with the shaded areas. 
The Kinect sensor CI was derived from the static manne-
quin results and is clearly asymmetric or skewed towards 
lower volumes. The spirometry CI was obtained from the 
CareFusion Microlab Spirometer specifications (www.
carefusion.com/medical-products/respiratory/cardio-pulmo-
nary-diagnostics/pulmonary-function-testing/spirometers/
microlab.aspx, accessed 12 September 2014). Accuracy was 
reported to be ±3 % in line with ATS/ERS standards.
There was generally good agreement between Kinect-based 
measurements and spirometry data. Also shown in Fig. 5 is a 
black arrow indicating the region around the two VC measure-
ments used to calculate the correlation coefficient, used as a 
similarity measure. This region was defined in all cases by −8 
to +12 s, relative to the peak of the VC time course.
Figure 6 shows the aligned point for point comparison 
of the region of interest (−8 to +12 s window) around the 
peak in an exemplar relaxed VC measurement, for patient 
1, run 2. Indicated in this figure is the estimated correla-
tion coefficient, ρ = 0.9937, with upper and lower bounds 
[0.9897, 0.9962], showing a significant (p < 0.001) cor-
relation between the two time series. Also indicated in 
this figure by the red line is the total least squares (TLS) 
regression estimate [15] deemed to be more accurate than 
standard linear regression, treating the spirometry esti-
mate as the regressor, as both the Kinect and spirometry 
estimates contain error. The TLS fitting produces an esti-
mate of regression slope and intercept and their respective 
CI. In the ideal situation, the TLS fit should have+ a slope 
of 1 and an intercept of 0. In this case, the slope is 0.9601 
[0.9580, 0.9621] and the intercept is 0.0167 [0.0147, 
0.0187]. The residual standard error from the linear fit is 
0.0809 l and can be interpreted as a further similarity meas-
ure—the lower the error, the better the fit.

based and spirometry measurements, for patient 1, run 2.
Figure 7 shows all of the correlation coefficients obtained 
between the Kinect-based and spirometry measurements for 
all subjects and repeated measurements. The figure shows a 
box-whisker plot for both groups. The central mark indicates 
the group median values, the edges of the box for the 25th 
and 75th percentiles and the whiskers extend to the most 
extreme data points. Identified outliers are shown by the red 
crosses. All correlation coefficients not deemed outliers were 
above 0.8656 for the patient group and above 0.9226 for the 
healthy volunteer group. All correlation coefficients were 
shown to be significant at a CI of 99 % (p values <0.001), 
where they were computed from a t distribution, assuming 
underlying bivariate normal distribution of the data.
A one-way ANOVA (F[1,51] = 7.5783; p = 0.0082) 
indicated that the two groups’ sample means were sig-
nificantly different. Thus, the CF subjects demonstrated 
slightly poorer correlation coefficients.

correlation [ρ = −0.5243[−0.6960, −0.2960]] between 
the correlation coefficients and the residual error from the 
TLS fitting procedure. Both the TLS fit and correlation 
coefficient measures attempt to determine the degree of 
similarity between the Kinect-based and spirometry meas-
urements. Larger TLS residual error occurs where the two 
estimates are not well represented by a linear relationship, 
also indicated by a low correlation coefficient.

parameters, intercept and slope, for all dynamic lung vol-
ume measurements.
Figure 8 shows histograms of all the fitted intercept and 
slope estimates from the TLS regression. Typically, the 
intercept (left) is grouped around 0. The slopes are skewed 
to slightly less than unity. As established in the static anal-
ysis, the error on the combined Kinect-based system esti-
mates tended towards underestimation rather than overesti-
mation. This is seen in the bias (nonzero mean and median) 
and the long tail (skewed nature of the extreme value distri-
bution). The TLS slope estimates are less than unity, indi-
cating tendency towards underestimation.

Discussion
This paper reports the development of a low-cost and port-
able method for analysing chest wall motion through the 
use of four Microsoft Kinect devices used in parallel. The 
system uses a combination of bespoke software and off-the-
shelf software, in the form of Geomagic Studio, to evaluate a 
three-dimensional model of a patient’s torso taken over time 
and evaluate changes in volume in order to calculate chest 
wall motion. Static testing and testing on healthy volunteers 
and cystic fibrosis patients in comparison with spirometry 
show good correlation (albeit a small underprediction).
The system could prove useful for assessing the effects 
of respiratory interventions such as medications and physi-
otherapy techniques. The system also has potential in the 
pre- and post-operative assessment of thoracic surgical 
interventions to treat lung conditions including lung cancer, 
as well as structural abnormalities such as pectus excava-
tum and paralysed hemidiaphragm. In particular, there is 
potential for the use of the tool as a tele-assessment device, 
particularly as there is potential to use the system whilst the 
patient is seated, or standing.
An advantage of using data from four Kinect sensors is 
that this system is able to accurately assess chest wall motion 
even in moving subjects. This is potentially very useful for 
assessing changes in respiratory physiology that occur on 
exercise, such as dynamic hyperinflation. This is in contrast 
to previously described chest wall motion analysis systems 
that rely on data from one viewpoint [18]. This again allows 
for more effective use of the system for tele-assessment.
It was previously discussed in this paper that an advantage 
of using this system is the ability to measure regional motion. 
Although this was not fully evaluated in this initial testing, the 
system was designed with this in mind. It is possible, when 
the point clouds are exported from the bespoke software, to 
be able to split the point cloud in any way necessary. It is then 
possible to evaluate the volume of each individual component 
created, allowing for regional motion analysis.
The system is currently in a prototype stage and shows 
promising results. However, further development is 
required to create a fully integrated software which does 
not involve the use of Geomagic Studio. The hardware

itself must also be adapted to be more suitable for the clini-
cal environment (e.g. alleviation of excess wiring, produc-
ing single device). With a new version of the Microsoft 
Kinect being released, and future SDK updates, there is 
also scope for improvement in these results through the 
enhancement of the technology itself.
In terms of the accuracy of the system, the probabil-
ity distribution of the error on the Kinect-based system 
highlighted a systematic, albeit small, underprediction of 
static volume. It appears from this testing that the sys-
tem is accurate when measuring static objects. For the 
purposes of this testing, it was decided that this under-
prediction was small enough to conduct dynamic capture 
successfully. However, in future iterations of the proto-
type, these data will require further investigation. With 
further work on the calibration process, and refinement 
of the algorithms used for smoothing, this error may be 
reduced.
Full system testing with 13 healthy volunteers and nine 
CF was conducted to assess dynamic capture capabilities. 
Estimates of volume change showed a high correlation with 
that of spirometry in both groups. Through the total least 
squares regression, it is shown that Kinect-based measure-
ments and spirometry are in good agreement, with a ten-
dency for Kinect-based measurements to underpredict that 
of spirometry. This is further in agreement with the static 
analysis.
There were significant differences between the groups, 
due to airflow obstruction, characteristic of CF lung dis-
ease. This may be down to the original design stage of the 
system in which testing was performed on healthy volun-
teers. At this point, there may not have been enough focus 
on the movement of the diaphragm, and this is something 
that will need to be addressed in future versions.

Conclusion
In summary, these initial results suggest that the novel 
Kinect-based system is an accurate and affordable method 
of rapidly measuring chest wall motion. Some slight under-
prediction has been shown in the results, but in general, a 
promising correlation with spirometry in static objects, 
healthy volunteers and CF patients has been demonstrated, 
providing grounds for further work.
Therefore, the research team will be developing the sys-
tem further, particularly through use of the new version of 
the Kinect and SDK, and evaluation of the system for test-
ing regional motion and tele-assessments. The team will
