Objective: This study aimed to investigate the value of imaging-based multivariable body composition pro-
filing by describing its association with coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic 
health on individual and population levels.
Methods: The first 6,021 participants scanned by UK Biobank were included. Body composition profiles 
(BCPs) were calculated, including abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), 
thigh muscle volume, liver fat, and muscle fat infiltration (MFI), determined using magnetic resonance imag-
ing. Associations between BCP and metabolic status were investigated using matching procedures and 
multivariable statistical modeling.
Results: Matched control analysis showed that higher VAT and MFI were associated with CHD and T2D 
(P 
< 
0.001). Higher liver fat was associated with T2D (P 
< 
0.001) and lower liver fat with CHD (P 
< 
0.05), match-
ing on VAT. Multivariable modeling showed that lower VAT and MFI were associated with metabolic health 
(P 
< 
0.001), and liver fat was nonsignificant. Associations remained significant adjusting for sex, age, BMI, 
alcohol, smoking, and physical activity.
Conclusions: Body composition profiling enabled an intuitive visualization of body composition and showed 
the complexity of associations between fat distribution and metabolic status, stressing the importance of a 
multivariable approach. Different diseases were linked to different BCPs, which could not be described by 
a single fat compartment alone.

Introduction
Anthropometric measures, such as BMI, are poor predictors of 
body fat distribution and associated metabolic risk, particularly at 
an individual level (1-3). Moving toward individualized medicine, 
specific measures of body composition could greatly advance our 
understanding of obesity, metabolic health, aging, and chronic 
diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extensively used 
for body composition analysis (2,4-7) and is accepted as the gold 
standard in body composition research (4,8). Recently developed 
MRI techniques allow for advanced body composition profil-
ing and phenotyping using standardized acquisition protocols, 
enabling a comparison of measurements across large-scale cohorts 
and between different studies (7,9). The use of these techniques 
enables separation of fat and muscle compartments from a single 
6- to 10-minute MRI examination with a high success rate (7).
Ectopic fat accumulation in various compartments of the body is a hall-
mark of metabolic syndrome and related comorbidities (10,11). Increased 
visceral adipose tissue (V
AT) is related to increased cardiac risk (12-
14,16), type 2 diabetes (T2D) (15,16), liver inflammation and fibrosis (17), 
and certain types of cancer (18,19). Increased intramuscular adipose tissue, 
or muscle fat infiltration (MFI), has been associated with reduced mobility 
(20) and increased risk for T2D (21). Moreover, increased liver fat may 
lead to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (22,23), 
and it is also linked to the development of T2D (22,24).
To understand the development of metabolic diseases, investigations of 
the interplay between several different adipose tissue compartments are 
needed. Although most adipose tissue compartments are correlated with 
general adiposity and BMI, disease risks tend to be related to specific pat-
terns or balance in fat accumulation (2,12). To further our understanding

of the complex interplay between muscle metabolism, adipose tissue 
accumulation, and ectopic fat, more refined tools are needed.
The aims of this study were to investigate the value of multivariable 
body composition profiling, by relating the individual body composi-
tion profile (BCP) to population scale data from the UK Biobank imag-
ing cohort (25), and to describe the specific associations with diagnosed 
coronary heart disease (CHD), T2D, and metabolic health by utilizing 
an intuitive multidimensional visualization.
Methods
Subjects
The first 6,021 participants from the UK Biobank imaging substudy were 
included, with a mean age of 62.3 ± 7.5 (44.6-78.3) years and a BMI of 
26.7 ± 4.4 (16.0-58.0) kg/m2. The UK Biobank is a population-based study 
enrolled in 2006, following 502,682 participants, with the aim to improve 
the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a wide range of serious and 
life-threatening illnesses. Baseline assessment gathered extensive infor-
mation via physical measurements, questionnaires, samples, and consent 
to access medical records. Following baseline assessment, 100,000 partic-
ipants are being recalled for an imaging study of the brain, heart, bones, 
carotid arteries, and body composition, as well as a repeat of the baseline 
assessment (26). This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank 
resource, project ID 6569. The study was approved by the North West 
Multicenter Research Ethics Committee in the United Kingdom. Written 
informed consent was obtained prior to study entry.
MRI scanning
The subjects were scanned in a Siemens MAGNETOM Aera 1.5-T 
MRI scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a 
6-minute dual-echo Dixon Vibe protocol, providing a water and fat 
separated volumetric data set covering neck to knees, and a single-slice 
multiecho Dixon acquisition for proton density fat fraction (PDFF) as-
sessment in the liver. For body composition, acquired image data were 
analyzed for VAT, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT), 
thigh muscle volume, MFI in the anterior thighs, and liver PDFF. 
Briefly, the image analysis consisted of (1) image calibration, (2) fusion 
of image stacks, (3) image segmentation, and (4) quantification of fat 
and muscle volumes (7,9,27-29) and included manual quality control 
by an analysis engineer. Body composition analyses were performed 
using AMRA Profiler Research (AMRA Medical AB, Linköping, 
Sweden). The online Supporting Information provides detailed infor-
mation of in vivo acquisitions and analysis.
Body composition profiling
A BCP was defined as a combination of variables that together describe 
the fat and/or muscle distribution of an individual or group. When ap-
plying statistical modeling, the following BCP variables describing 
adipose tissue distribution throughout the body without physically 
overlapping each other were used: VAT index (VATi), or VAT nor-
malized by height squared to compensate for subject size (30); ASAT 
index (ASATi), or ASAT normalized by height squared; liver PDFF; 
and MFI. When visualizing body composition, the six-axis BCP plot 
was used (Figure 1).
Visualizing BCP
The variables used in the BCP plot jointly describe fat accumulation 
and fat and muscle distribution, and they allow for a quick assessment 
of body composition based on the shape in the BCP plot. Specifically, 
the visualization illustrates the balance between different adipose tis-
sue compartments and the distribution of fat, diffuse fat infiltration, 
and muscles in the body. It comprises VATi; total abdominal adipose 
tissue index (TAATi), which is the total abdominal fat (VAT + ASAT) 
normalized by height squared, a fat-specific version of BMI; weight-
to-muscle ratio (WMR), which is body weight divided by thigh muscle 
volume, indicating the ability of subjects to carry their weight; fat ratio 
(FR), which is the total abdominal fat divided by total abdominal fat 
and thigh muscle volume, assessing the distribution between fat and 
muscle volume; MFI; and liver PDFF.
The BCP plot displays multivariable data in a six-axis radar chart 
(Figure 1). Because of the difference in magnitude and distribution 
between the BCP variables, they were mapped using a logarithmic sig-
moid transfer function (Figure 2) with distribution-specific constants to 
values between 0 (chart center) and 1 (end of spokes). The same type 
of transfer function, with the median values of a metabolic disease-free 
(MDF) group as references, was used for all variables. To align the 
distribution-specific constants and reference values in the radar chart, 
and therefore level the visual response between variables, they were 
mapped to fixed distances from the chart center. The reference values 
were mapped to 0.15 for variables with only ectopic fat (liver PDFF, 
VATi, and MFI) and to 0.6 for the remaining variables, forming the 
shape of a star (Figure 1A). Changes in variables on axes with only 
ectopic fat dominated the appearance of the resulting BCP (i.e., high-
lighting the ectopic fat compartments). An individual was visualized 
with a line (Figure 1B) and a group with a shaded field covering the 
interquartile range (Figure 1C-1D).
Stratification of metabolic subgroups
Diagnosis information was gathered through inpatient electronic health 
care records (downloaded November 2016, available from 1995-2015) 
and via touch screen questionnaires followed by interviews performed 
by trained nurses.
Metabolic disease free. To identify subjects asymptomatic of 
metabolic diseases, a list of conditions considered to be serious enough 
to represent metabolically focused health concerns (e.g., cardiovascular 
and metabolic diseases, severe chronic conditions, neurological 
diseases, cancers) (Supporting Information Table S1), reviewed by an 
experienced clinician, was used. Participants were considered MDF 
if they did not report any of the listed diseases (UK Biobank field 
identification numbers 20001 and 20002) (31) and if they did not have 
the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) 
codes mapping to strings similar to the listed diseases (supplementary 
file by Neuraz et al. used for mapping) (32).
CHD
• Cases—Data from the electronic health care records only were used to 
identify subjects with diagnosed CHD. Subjects with ischemic heart 
disease or presence of aortocoronary bypass graft (ICD-10 codes I20-
I25, Z951) were considered CHD cases.
• Controls—CHD controls did not have any of the above ICD-10 codes. 
In addition, they had no self-reported history of heart attack, angina, 
other heart and/or cardiac problems, or diabetes diagnosed by a

doctor. Supporting Information Table S2 lists fields used for strati-
fication. Statistical analyses excluded subjects not characterized as 
CHD cases or controls (n = 1,384).
T2D
• Cases—Subjects with diabetes diagnosed by a doctor and an age of 
diagnosis of 30 years or older were considered T2D cases.
• Controls—Subjects with diabetes diagnosed by a doctor and an age 
of diagnosis younger than 30 years, or with gestational diabetes, 
were excluded from the T2D controls. Supporting Information Table 
S3 lists fields used for stratification. Statistical analysis excluded 
subjects not characterized as T2D cases or controls (n = 38).
Matched controls. For CHD and T2D, two matched control groups 
were stratified matched on (1) sex and age and (2) sex, age, and BMI. 
Each control was chosen as the nearest neighbor with the same sex in 
the euclidean space constructed by (1) age and (2) normalized (standard 
score normalization) age and BMI.

Cases had controls selected by repeating the following: (1) exclude con-
trols with opposite sex, (2) choose the closest control, and (3) remove 
that control from remaining controls.
Acquisition and definition of covariates
Height was recorded using a Seca 240 height measure (Seca, 
Hamburg, Germany), and weight was recorded with a Tanita 
BC-418MA body composition analyzer (Tanita Corp., Arlington 
Heights, Illinois). Smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, 
and statin medication were derived using data from touch screen 
questionnaires and/or interviews (see Supporting Information for 
further details).
Statistical analysis
Individual assessment. Two multivariable logistic regression 
models were used to investigate each individual's association to 
CHD, T2D, and MDF, including (1) sex and age and (2) sex, age, 
and BCP (VATi, ASATi, liver PDFF, and MFI). To adjust for the sex 
and age dependence in the disease prevalence data, a sex-and-age 
normalized predicted probability was calculated. Each predicted 
probability, calculated using the log odds from the model outputs 
including BCP, was divided by that from the model including 
only sex and age. Subjects from three BMI intervals, 24 (23-25) 
(normal weight), 28 (27-29) (overweight), and 32 (31-33) (obesity), 
all approximately 65 years old, were used to exemplify.
Group assessment. The CHD and T2D subgroups were visualized 
in BCP plots. The statistical significance of differences in the 
BCP variables between cases and controls was tested using the 
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test (P < 0.05 significant).
Statistical modeling. Multivariable logistic regression models were 
also used to investigate the association of CHD, T2D, and MDF to 
BCP (VATi, liver PDFF, MFI, and ASATi), including potential 
confounding effects of sex and age (Model MV), smoking status, 
alcohol intake, and physical activity (Model MV + lifestyle), and BMI 
(Model MV + lifestyle + BMI). Liver PDFF was Box-Cox transformed 
(λ = −0.51). All models were run for the whole cohort, males and 
females separately, with and without statin treatment adjustment.
Post hoc analysis. For CHD, the group assessment was extended 
by comparison with a control group matched on sex, age, and 
VATi. Computations were performed using R version 3.4.0 (The 
R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). The Supporting Information lists 
additional R packages.

Statistical analysis
Individual assessment. Figure 3 exemplifies individual BCP 
assessments with sex-and-age normalized predicted probabilities for 
CHD, T2D, and MDF in bar plots. Females were used to exemplify. 
Supporting Information Figure S1 shows the results for males. The 
predicted probabilities for CHD and T2D did not covary, i.e., within all 
BMI ranges, subjects exhibited different combinations of the following 
predicted probabilities for CHD and T2D: low-low, high-low, low-high, 
and high-high. Among subjects with overweight and obesity, there were 
those exhibiting lower predicted probability for disease compared with 
subjects with normal weight.
Group assessment. CHD and T2D cases showed significantly 
higher values for all BCP plot variables (P < 0.001) compared with all 
controls (Figure 4; Table 2). Comparing CHD cases with sex-and-age 
matched controls, all variables except liver PDFF had significantly 
higher values (P < 0.001). Comparison with sex, age, and BMI matched 
controls showed significantly higher values in VATi (P < 0.05) only. 
Comparison with sex, age, and VATi matched controls (post hoc 
analysis) showed significance in liver PDFF only. Liver PDFF was 
lower among CHD cases (2.69% [1.64-7.39%] median, interquartile 
range) compared with controls (3.64% [2.04-7.20%]; P < 0.05).
Comparing T2D cases with sex-and-age matched controls, all vari-
ables had significantly higher values (P < 0.001). Comparison with sex, 
age, and BMI matched controls showed significantly higher values for 
WMR, VATi, liver PDFF, and MFI (P < 0.05). Differences in FR and 
TAATi were nonsignificant.
Statistical modeling. Figure 5 presents multivariable logistic 
regression results showing associations of CHD, T2D, and MDF with 
BCP for the whole cohort as well as males and females separately. CHD 
had a positive association to VATi when applying multivariable statistical 
modeling to the whole cohort (P < 0.001), males only (P < 0.001), and 
females only (P = 0.013), adjusted for sex (whole cohort) and age (Model 
MV). Associations remained significant after adjustment for lifestyle 
factors (smoking status, alcohol intake, and physical activity; Model 
MV + lifestyle) and BMI (Model MV + lifestyle + BMI) and statin 
treatment. MFI was positively associated with CHD for the whole 
cohort (P = 0.018), when adjusting for sex and age and when applying

T2D was associated with higher VATi, liver PDFF, and MFI adjusting 
for sex (whole cohort) and age (all P < 0.01) (Model MV). Associations 
remained significant after applying all adjustments (Models MV + life-
style and MV + lifestyle + BMI), including statin treatment. ASATi was 
nonsignificant.
MDF was associated with lower VATi for the whole cohort (P < 0.001), 
males only (P < 0.001), and females only (P = 0.013), adjusting for sex 
(whole cohort) and age, and lower MFI (all P < 0.02), adjusting for 
sex (whole cohort) and age (Model MV). Liver PDFF was nonsignif-
icant. Associations remained significant after applying all adjustments 
(Models MV + lifestyle and MV + lifestyle + BMI), including statin 
treatment. ASATi was significant in the male model including BMI 
(P = 0.045).
Discussion
This study examined the effectiveness of multivariable, MRI-based 
body composition profiling to further our understanding of metabolic 
health. Investigating the associations between CHD and T2D and each 
fat compartment separately (Table 2) showed positive associations with 
most of the fat compartments. Matching on BMI left only VATi with 
a significant association to CHD, while matching on VATi instead of 
BMI showed a significant negative association to liver PDFF. This re-
sult was also reflected in the whole cohort and among males when 
applying statistical modeling including multiple fat compartments 
(Figure 5). Low ectopic fat, especially VATi and MFI, was positively 
associated with metabolic health, and higher values were found among 
subjects with metabolic diseases (Table 2; Figure 4 and Figure 5), 
while liver PDFF had no significant association. The modeling re-
sults remained significant after adjusting for sex, age, lifestyle factors, 
BMI, and statin treatment. The individual BCP assessment showed that 
within the same sex, age, and BMI group (normal weight, overweight, 
and obesity), a variety of individual BCPs were found, exhibiting 
different combinations of predicted disease probabilities (Figure 3). 
Taken together, these findings stress the importance of a multivariable 
approach investigating associations between fat distribution and met-
abolic diseases. Different diseases were linked to different BCPs, or 
imbalances in fat accumulation, which could not be described by sex, 
age, lifestyle, or generalized adiposity or by investigating a single fat 
compartment alone.
Context of current literature
VATi was identified as a key variable in understanding metabolic dis-
eases. For CHD, this is concurrent with prospective findings from, for 
example, the Dallas Heart Study (2) and Framingham Heart Study (12), 
showing associations between elevated VAT and increased cardiovas-
cular risk factors and incidence of cardiovascular events. For T2D, 
our results agree with those from the Cooperative Health Research in 
the Augsburg Region (KORA) MRI study (24), in which significantly 
higher VAT and liver fat were found among diabetics and prediabetics 
without previous cardiovascular problems. These differences remained 
significant after correction for sex, age, systolic blood pressure, smok-
ing status, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol levels, and triglyceride levels.
The results associating liver PDFF to T2D are well aligned with pre-
viously observed associations to the development of diabetes (22). 
However, for liver fat and CHD, the picture is more complex. There are 
many studies that have linked hepatic steatosis to cardiovascular disease 
(33-35) as well as recent studies that have reported elevated liver fat 
as not having a significant association to CHD after BMI adjustment.

However, there are few studies that have investigated liver fat as one 
among multiple body composition biomarkers describing fat accumula-
tion. Another is the Dallas Heart Study, showing the importance of VAT 
and no association of cardiovascular events to liver fat after correction 
for BMI or VAT (2). Important differences comparing this study and 
the present is that it only included subjects with obesity and, possibly, 
too few cases to reveal multivariable associations. A recent large study 
investigating long-term outcomes in patients with biopsy-proven non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) showed no significant difference 
in cardiovascular death comparing NAFLD cases with controls (36). 
However, this study did not include other fat compartments, leaving 
multivariable associations unknown.
Lower liver PDFF among those who have experienced a cardiac event, as 
compared with controls, might be caused by subsequent disease treatment, 
or it could be an indication that a phenotype exists exhibiting a body com-
position with skewed fat accumulation that is associated with diagnosed 
CHD or common CHD comorbidities, such as chronic liver disease. The 
nonsignificant association between liver PDFF and CHD observed in 
females might be because of the lower prevalence of CHD among females, 
or that females rarely exhibit the skewness in fat accumulation driving 
the negative association between liver PDFF and CHD for the males. The 
observed finding of liver PDFF being negatively associated with CHD was 
not a direct effect of statin treatment. Prospective data can demonstrate 
potential causality and predictive value of this finding.

Body Composition Profiling in UK Biobank Linge et al.
Associations of MFI to metabolic risk factors have previously been 
reported from the Framingham Heart Study (37). MFI has also been 
reported to be associated with insulin resistance in obesity and T2D 
(21). Our study showed a negative association between MFI and MDF 
and a positive association to T2D. However, associations between CHD 
and MFI were different in the sex-stratified analyses; they were not 
significant for males and were significant, or borderline significant, for 
females depending on correction factors. Although the Framingham 
Heart Study (37) did adjust for VAT, the approach of measuring MFI 
was not the same.
The individual BCP assessment (Figure 3) showed subjects with 
obesity with lower disease probability compared with subjects with 
normal weight, adding to the literature on healthy obesity (38-40). It 
was further strengthened by the comparison between the subject with 
normal weight with inflated BCP (Figure 3, top right) and the subject 
with obesity and a more star-shaped BCP (Figure 3, bottom left). This 
comparison yields a predicted probability for CHD and T2D with a 
factor 2 higher for the subject with normal weight and a factor 0.5 
lower for MDF. That BMI has limitations in describing the individ-
ual is no longer a controversial statement, and the existence of body 
compositions in subjects with high BMI that are not disadvantageous 
from a health perspective has become more accepted in current lit-
erature. However, the results from the individual assessment yield a 
much more complex picture. Within all BMI classes, a range of BCPs 
were found, some of which associated with MDF, others with only 
CHD, only T2D, or those exhibiting comorbid disease association. 
Individuals exhibiting high predicted probability for MDF (Figure 3, 
first column) had BCPs more similar to the MDF group, represented 
by the reference star. Individuals exhibiting high predicted probability 
for CHD but low for T2D (Figure 3, second column) seemed to be 
characterized by high VATi and MFI but low liver PDFF. Individuals 
exhibiting high predicted probability for T2D but low for CHD 
(Figure 3, third column) seemed to be characterized by high VATi 
and liver PDFF but low MFI. Finally, individuals exhibiting comorbid 
disease association (Figure 3, fourth column) were characterized by 
high VATi, liver PDFF, and MFI. Although these subjects are among 
the extremes on the spectrum of combined predicted probabilities for 
CHD and T2D (i.e., low-low, high-low, low-high, high-high), they 
exemplify the diversity in disease associations to multivariable body 
composition. This emphasizes the importance of centering the analy-
ses around the individuals, something rarely, if ever, seen in the body 
composition literature.
Implications
This study showed the complexity in investigating disease associations 
to fat distribution and the importance of a multivariable approach. 
With the identification of specific fat distributions associated with dif-
ferent diseases, more targeted and effective disease treatments could 
be developed. Furthermore, a multivariable description of an individ-
ual's body composition, attained from a single examination, enables 
a more standardized and detailed description of a patient's metabolic 
disease status. By combining multivariable body composition analysis 
with already measured biomarkers, there is potential for highly indi-
vidualized intervention plans.
Body composition profiling and visualization allowed for a quick and 
simultaneous assessment of an individual's or group's fat accumulation 
pattern, fat and muscle distribution, and balance between adipose tissue 
compartments. The visualization introduces the possibility to easily 
distinguish between different phenotypes in a multivariable space. The 
star-shaped reference effectively shapes the BCP to highlight the ecto-
pic fat compartments, and a quick assessment, based on current knowl-
edge, of an individual's risk profile can be made.
Our study makes significant advances to current literature by present-
ing normative values of standardized body composition parameters for 
metabolic health and disease (CHD and T2D) (Table 1 and Table 2). 
This brings context of high importance to future studies investigating 
body composition and metabolic disease.
The broad use of MRI to assess body composition has thus far not 
been possible because of limitations in cost and access. Sources of cost 
are, for example, the scanning time and laborious manual segmenta-
tion of anatomical regions. In UK Biobank, a 6-minute protocol was 
implemented for the complete body composition assessment, and the 
combination with advanced image analysis techniques enabled auto-
matic segmentations of anatomical regions and extraction of biomarker 
values. Today, this is a solution available also outside the image pro-
cessing research community. The short acquisition protocol and auto-
mated image analysis enable cost-effective assessment of patients with 
suspected metabolic-related diseases, such as NAFLD, chronic liver 
disease, or cardiovascular disease. In particular, this technique can 
be easily added to provide further metabolic disease profiling of such 
patients that are already examined using MRI.
Strengths and limitations
This study utilized measurements with high reproducibility, accuracy, 
and precision describing fat distribution gathered on a large number of 
well-characterized subjects. The technique has been validated on many 
different MRI scanners, and the standardization of measures allows 
comparisons across and between large cohorts. Simultaneous inclusion 
of several body composition measures strengthened the investigation 
of disease associations to adipose tissue distribution. Furthermore, in 
terms of disease information, we benefitted from the integration of 
self-reported and diagnosis data from electronic health care records.
There are some limitations. First, this study was based on cross-sec-
tional data, and medications taken into account included only statins 
and not the time on medication. This leaves the causality and predictive 
power of the BCP unknown. Future analyses should focus on additional 
medications that may affect liver fat or adiposity. Second, self-reported 
data were used to control for confounding effects and in disease defi-
nitions. Future availability of biochemical assays and primary care 
data enables a more detailed investigation of the metabolic syndrome. 
Thirdly, there is evidence of UK Biobank exhibiting a “healthy vol-
unteer” selection bias (41). However, conclusions on associations 
between exposures and health outcomes are generalizable to the wider 
population because of the large sample size and heterogeneity of expo-
sure measures (41). Also, the bias was partly amended by correcting 
for general adiposity and lifestyle factors. When more subjects have 
been scanned, further investigations can be made, including other eth-
nicities, age ranges, and sociodemographic factors. Lastly, our study 
investigated the associations between multivariable body composition 
and metabolic diseases, showing associations mainly to VATi, MFI, and 
liver PDFF. Investigating other areas of disease may instead reveal the 
importance of other variables, including lean muscle volume, total fat, 
and weight, WMR, FR, ASATi, and TAATi.

Conclusion
Body composition profiling enabled an intuitive visualization of body 
composition and showed the complexity of associations between fat 
distribution and different metabolic diseases on both population and 
individual levels, stressing the importance of a multivariable approach. 
The analyses showed unique associations to diagnosed CHD, T2D, and 
MDF. VATi and MFI were negatively associated with MDF, and higher 
values were observed in CHD and T2D. The associations of liver fat 
were ambiguous; they were negative with CHD, positive with T2D, 
and nonsignificant with MDF. This could not be described by sex, 
age, lifestyle, or generalized adiposity or by investigating a single fat 
compartment alone. Altogether, multivariable body composition pro-
filing showed the potential to improve the description of the interplay 
between different adipose tissue compartments, ectopic fat accumula-
tion, and metabolic disease profiles.O
