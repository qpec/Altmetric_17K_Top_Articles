 Background—Later puberty associates with lower areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and both 
are risk factors for osteoporosis. However, the association between puberty timing-associated 
genetic variants and aBMD during development, and the causal relationship between puberty 
timing and aBMD, remain uncharacterized.
Methods—We constructed sex-specific polygenic risk scores (GRS) consisting of 333 genetic 
variants associated with later puberty in European-descent children in the Bone Mineral Density in 
Childhood Study (BMDCS), consisting of a longitudinal cohort with up to seven assessments (n = 
933) and a cross-sectional cohort (n = 486). These GRS were tested for associations with age- and 
sex-specific aBMD Z-scores at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip, and distal 
radius, accounting for clinical covariates using sex-stratified linear mixed models. The causal 
relationship between puberty timing and aBMD was tested in the BMDCS and in publicly 
available adult data (GEFOS consortium) using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).
Results—The puberty-delaying GRS was associated with later puberty and lower LS-aBMD in 
the BMDCS in both sexes (combined beta (SE) = −0.078 (0.024), P = 0.0010). In the MR 
framework, the puberty-delaying genetic instrument also supported a causal association with lower 
LS-aBMD and FN-aBMD in adults of both sexes.
Conclusions—Our results suggest that pubertal timing is causal for diminished aBMD in a 
skeletal site-and sex-specific manner that tracks throughout life, potentially impacting later risk for 
osteoporosis, which should be tested in future studies.

Introduction
Rapid bone accrual occurs during puberty, and the process of sexual maturation is likely to 
impact lifelong bone health as bone mineral density (BMD) tracks throughout life1. In 
particular, later age at menarche (AAM) is associated with increased osteoporosis risk in 
women1–3, possibly mediated by the association between later AAM and lower peak bone 
mass in young adulthood4–6. In men, later age at peak height velocity, indicating later 
pubertal timing, is associated with lower trabecular and cortical volumetric BMD in young 
adulthood7, and there is a trend between later age at voice break (AVB), also indicative of 
later puberty, and osteoporosis risk1. Heritability estimates of areal BMD (aBMD) and 
pubertal timing both exceed 80%8–10, suggesting a marked genetic component to these 
traits. Investigating the role of genetic factors in early life is important for maximizing bone 
gain during development, as bone acquisition during growth appears to be more important 
than bone loss during adulthood for fracture risk in the elderly11.
With respect to bone health, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated 65 
variants with bone fragility in adults to date12,13, with some overlap in children and 
adolescents14–16. For pubertal timing, 380 variants have been associated with AAM in 
females and/or AVB in males17. Recent co-heritability studies using LD-score regression 
found that pubertal timing and adult aBMD share a common genetic etiology; this genetic 
correlation suggests that some of the same genetic variants impact both traits18,19. In

 addition, in disorders of absent puberty like Turner and Kallmann syndromes, there are clear 
skeletal defects20,21. However, the relationships between genetic risk for later puberty and 
aBMD during skeletal development and later in life have not been explored.
We therefore aimed to determine if there was an association between genetic loci known to 
affect the timing of puberty, both individually and summarized into polygenic risk scores 
(GRS) that represent the “genetic load” of puberty-delaying variants for each individual, and 
aBMD at multiple skeletal sites in healthy children from the Bone Mineral Density in 
Childhood Study (BMDCS). Additionally, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomization 
(MR)22 to test if later pubertal timing caused lower aBMD. Using robustly associated 
genetic loci from large GWAS, these methods avoid confounding by environmental factors 
during development and across the lifecourse.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
The BMDCS was a longitudinal study of healthy children that aimed to establish normal 
reference ranges for aBMD/bone mineral content (BMC) in children aged 5–20 years in the 
United States (N = 2014) (see Supplementary Note for a detailed cohort description). 
Briefly, participants were evaluated annually for up to 7 visits between 2002 and 200923,24. 
At the final study visit, blood or saliva was collected, and DNA was extracted and genome-
wide genotyped16,25. An additional, independent cross-sectional sample from two of the 
original study sites was enrolled in 2008/2009, completed the same protocol, and provided a 
DNA sample. We included genotyped participants from both the longitudinal and cross-
sectional cohorts of European ancestry (N = 733 girls and 685 boys; Supplementary Table 
1).
All participants aged 18 years and older gave written informed consent. Parental or guardian 
consent and participant assent was obtained for individuals younger than 18 years. The study 
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each clinical center.
Phenotypes
Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were used to estimate aBMD at the distal 
1/3 radius (DR), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), and lumbar spine (LS). Age- and sex-
specific aBMD Z-scores (aBMDz) were calculated as previously described26. Trained 
pediatric endocrinology nurses or physicians estimated puberty stage based on testicular 
volume in males and breast development in females. Participants were categorized as pre-
pubertal (Tanner I), pubertal (Tanner II-IV), or post-pubertal (Tanner V). AAM was 
determined by questionnaire. Collection methods for these phenotypes as well as physical 
activity and dietary calcium intake have previously been described in detail25.
Genotyping
High-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed on the 
Illumina Infinium II OMNI Express plus Exome BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) 
at the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia,

 PA, USA)16,25. Quality control of genome-wide genotype data included standard filters, 
including removing SNPs with poor call rate (< 95%), low minor allele frequency (MAF) < 
1%, and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium P < 1 × 10−5. Imputation was performed using the 
Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (r1.1 2016, https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/
index.html)27. In this study, we included 333 common, well-imputed autosomal puberty-
associated variants17. To define ancestry, we used principal component analysis and 
ADMIXTURE (> 50% European ancestry)16.
GRS construction
We calculated two puberty-delaying GRS, which represent a sum of puberty-delaying alleles 
weighted on their effect sizes on pubertal timing derived from large-scale GWAS, using 
PLINK28: (I) Female-GRS: a GRS summed across 333 AAM alleles, weighted on AAM-
delaying effect estimates derived from a large-scale GWAS performed by the ReproGen 
Consortium (www.reprogen.org; Supplementary Table 2)17; (II) Male-GRS: a GRS 
summing 49 alleles that were genome-wide significant for AAM but also associated with 
AVB (P < 0.05), weighted on the AVM-delaying effect estimates (Supplementary Table 3). 
All of the male effect estimates for AVB were directionally concordant with those for 
AAM17.
Statistical analyses
To verify that the GRS associated with later puberty in our sample, we tested the association 
of the female-GRS with AAM and earliest recorded age at entry into Tanner breast stage II, 
III, and IV, with and without adjustment for BMI Z-score (BMIz) using linear regression for 
each cross-sectional Tanner stage bin. Similarly, we tested the association between the male-
GRS and earliest recorded age at Tanner genital stage II, III, and IV. Next, using linear 
mixed effects models taking into account correlations between multiple measurements for 
each individual, we tested each GRS for association with aBMDz in males and females 
separately. Each model was adjusted for study center, cohort (discovery or replication), and 
age at measurement, as well as total physical activity level29 and dietary calcium intake25, 
all of which may affect aBMD during puberty. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by 
adding additional covariates that may impact aBMD during puberty to the base model, 
resulting in additional models including (1) height z-score, (2) height and weight z-scores, 
(3) BMIz, and (4) pubertal status. Individual puberty-associated variants were then tested for 
association with aBMDz in the BMDCS at each skeletal site, adjusting for the base 
covariates listed above. Additionally, these variants were queried from publically available 
GWAS summary data from the GEFOS consortium (http://www.gefos.org/) on adult LS-, 
FN- and DR-aBMDz13. All analyses were performed in STATA v.13.1 or 14.0 (StataCorp 
LP, College Station, TX, USA) or R v. 3.3.2.
Two-sample MR
There is an established relationship between later puberty and lower aBMD and osteoporosis 
risk later in life, suggesting that puberty timing is causally related to aBMD. To test this 
hypothesis, we performed two-sample MR using puberty timing-associated genetic variants 
as an instrument for pubertal timing that avoids confounding from environmental or lifestyle 
factors. MR was conducted using the MR-base website (www.mrbase.org)30 to test for

 causality between puberty-delaying variants and adult aBMD13 or the TwoSampleMR 
package in R (https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR) to test the puberty timing 
variants in the BMDCS31. aBMD at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and distal 
radius (DR) were tested in both the adult and adolescent settings. MR-base provides an 
online platform for performing causal inference that utilizes published GWAS signals as 
genetic instruments and outcomes30, while the TwoSampleMR package is a complementary 
suite for analyzing one’s own data. The platform offers a range of methods, improving the 
reliability and robustness of causal inference estimation, and sensitivity analyses to assess 
potential violations of MR assumptions, including leave-one-out, heterogeneity, and 
horizontal pleiotropy tests. For the MR analyses, default parameters were used (LD 
clumping to ensure that instrument SNPs are independent; LD proxies were found for 
missing SNPs with an r2 minimum of 0.8; palindromic SNPs were allowed; MAF threshold 
of 0.3 for palindromic SNPs). Exposure and outcome data was harmonized to ensure that all 
SNPs were on the forward strand. We performed additional sensitivity analyses in MR with 
a smaller subset of variants, excluding those associated with adult height and BMI, potential 
confounders influencing aBMD. Finally, we tested the reciprocal analysis of genome-wide 
significant BMD-associated variants13 on AAM32 using the MR-base online platform (19 
variants were found in both datasets and survived default clumping and filtering as outlined 
above).
Results
Puberty-delaying GRS
Since the female and males GRS are aggregates of variants associated with puberty in large-
scale GWAS of AAM and AVB, respectively, we would expect them to associate with these 
traits in our cohort. AVB was not available, but we were able to test the association of the 
GRS with AAM and earliest age recorded at Tanner female breast and male genital stages. 
As expected, in the BMDCS, the female GRS strongly associated with later AAM (beta = 
0.34, P = 3.75 × 10−9; adjusted for BMIz, beta = 0.31, P = 1.56 × 10−6), and both the female 
and male GRS associated with later entry into Tanner II, III, and IV (Supplementary Table 
4). Next, we tested the association between the puberty-delaying GRS and aBMD at each 
skeletal site. In both sexes, the puberty-delaying GRS were associated with lower LS-
aBMDz (females: beta = −0.088, P = 0.0097; males: −0.068, P = 0.039; combined: beta = 
−0.078, P = 0.0010) (Table 1), even when adjusting for potentially related traits (height z-
score, weight z-score, BMIz, or pubertal stage) as covariates in a number of models 
(Supplementary Table 5). The GRS were not associated with aBMDz at the other skeletal 
sites.
Individual puberty timing variants
We next assessed the association between each individual puberty timing-associated variant 
and aBMDz at each skeletal site. None of the individual variants associated with aBMDz in 
girls or boys in the BMDCS. However, two individual later puberty loci associated with 
lower LS-aBMDz in adults from the GEFOS consortium13: rs1054442-A (beta = −0.038, P 
= 4.85 × 10−5, MAF = 0.36) at 12q13.2 (near the gene DDN) and rs10750766-C (beta = 
−0.048, P = 1.10 × 10−6, MAF = 0.29) at 11q13.1 (near KAT5) (Supplementary Table 6).

 None of the pubertal timing-associated variants were individually associated with FN- or 
DR-aBMDz.
Causal inference analyses
Using pubertal timing-associated variants as a genetic instrument for causal inference 
analysis, we performed two-sample MR to assess the effect of pubertal timing on aBMD. In 
a fixed-effects model, the genetic instrument revealed association with lower LS-aBMD 
(Table 2). In girls, genetically determined later AAM associated with decreased LS-aBMD 
in children in all MR models tested but was just below the significance threshold corrected 
for multiple testing (P = 0.004) (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table 7) (fixed effects beta = 
−0.18, P = 0.0046). Additionally, nearly all models supported a causal influence of 
genetically determined later AAM on lower LS-aBMD in adult women using genome-wide 
summary statistics from the GEFOS consortium13 (fixed effects beta = −0.072, P = 9.2 × 
10−6) (Fig. 1B). In adult men, genetically determined later AVB also suggested a causal 
effect on lower LS-aBMD (fixed effects beta = −0.119, P = 0.0003); however, this was not 
evident in the BMDCS (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, in adults, but not children 
(possibly due to the smaller sample size), AAM-delaying and AVB-delaying genetic 
instruments showed association between later puberty and lower FN-aBMD (women: fixed 
effects beta = −0.074, P = 9.4 × 10−8; men: beta = −0.113, P = 7.0 × 10−5) (Supplementary 
Fig. 2). Finally, there was no association of genetically determined pubertal timing with DR-
aBMD in either sex, although the beta estimates were directionally consistent (i.e., negative) 
in childhood and adulthood.
Sensitivity analyses
To test whether any individual variant biased the fixed effect estimates, we performed leave-
one-out analyses, which showed that no single SNP was a driver for these associations 
(Supplementary Table 8). rs1054442 had the strongest individual SNP effect (Supplementary 
Table 9), but excluding this SNP did not drastically change the overall results. Next, a range 
of sensitivity analyses were carried out. First, we tested whether there is heterogeneity, or 
variability, in the causal estimates across SNPs (Fig 1C–D; Supplementary Table 10). The 
results showed that this is unlikely, as the Q-values for all models tested were not 
statistically significant. Fig. 1C–D also shows little directional bias among SNPs. There was 
little evidence for horizontal pleiotropy (Supplementary Table 11; Supplementary Fig. 3–4), 
suggesting a low likelihood that these variants influence the outcome through a pathway 
other than the exposure (i.e. pubertal timing), except for LS-BMD in males. Finally, 
removing SNPs associated with height and BMI (P < 0.05) and those without association 
data for these traits showed the persistence of an association with lower pediatric aBMD in 
the LS in adults (Supplementary Table 12).
Genetic instrument for BMD
Lower aBMD has been observed prior to puberty in girls who subsequently have later-than-
average puberty33. Thus, we tested if genetic variants for lower aBMD13, previously shown 
to collectively associate with pediatric aBMD25, also associate with pubertal timing by 
performing reciprocal two-sample MR of aBMD-associated variants on puberty timing 
based on the AAM GWAS by Perry et al32, which was available on MR-base.org. We found

 that an instrument built on 19 LS-BMD-associated genetic variants available on MR-
base.org was negatively associated with AAM32 in some of the models assessed 
(Supplementary Table 13).
Discussion
In this study, we examined the relationship between pubertal timing-associated genetic 
variants and aBMD using complementary methods: (1) association analysis of GRS built on 
puberty-delaying effect estimates, and (2) causal inference analysis using two-sample MR. 
Our results show that genetic risk for later-than-average puberty associated with lower LS-
aBMDz. This association, while stronger in girls in childhood, was evident in adulthood in 
both sexes. The spine is rich in trabecular bone, and may be particularly responsive during 
puberty34. Additionally, we found some evidence that genetically determined later puberty 
associated with lower FN-aBMD, a site that also has a high amount of trabecular bone. 
While aBMD is correlated at various skeletal sites, previous studies have seen both shared 
and unique genetic influences on aBMD at different sites, which may partly be due to 
different genetic regulatory mechanisms, bone composition, or factors like load bearing.
The epidemiological link between later puberty and higher osteoporosis risk is stronger in 
women than men1. Importantly, our results suggest that boys who are genetically 
predisposed to later-than-average puberty are also more likely to have reduced bone density. 
Consistent with these results, in a study of 19-year-old men, later age at attainment of peak 
height velocity was associated with lower aBMD, volumetric BMD, bone size and higher 
rates of previous fractures35. Another study of the 19-year-old men described above with 
later-normal puberty showed deficits in aBMD at all skeletal sites, but at a 5-year follow-up 
visit these deficits did not persist, except at the radius7. Despite this apparent “catch-up” in 
aBMD in young adulthood, lower aBMD during adolescence remains clinically relevant, as 
it is a period of high fracture risk36,37. Additionally, the trend observed in another study 
towards increased osteoporosis risk in men with later AVB1, and the results of our MR 
analyses, suggest that these early life deficits may not all remit and may therefore be 
important for later life bone health.
The association between later puberty and osteoporosis risk in girls is partially attributed to a 
shorter duration of estrogen exposure4. Our data show that part of the link between puberty 
timing and osteoporosis is due to shared genetic factors that influence both pubertal timing 
and bone mass in both sexes, although sex-specific mechanisms are likely involved. 
However, genetic variants affecting puberty timing may exert their effects on bone health via 
mechanisms other than pubertal timing itself. Shared genetic factors may impact bone mass 
even before puberty begins33,38. In this study, when we adjusted for pubertal timing by 
including pubertal stage in the GRS models (Supplementary Table 5), we found that the 
association at the LS remained, although the magnitude of the effect was slightly attenuated, 
supporting the idea that these genetic factors influence bone acquisition partly independently 
of pubertal timing itself.
On the other hand, physiological pathways that operate in tandem with puberty, such as 
height growth and body mass, may also impact bone acquisition in adolescence11. In this

 study, sensitivity analyses for horizontal pleiotropy in the MR framework did not show 
evidence that puberty-associated variants influence aBMD through a biological mechanism 
other than puberty and related, but unmeasured, pathways (e.g. height growth, BMI, or 
steroid hormone levels). Given that a large number of puberty-associated variants also 
associate with body mass and/or adult stature, the key exposure for reduced BMD may not 
be puberty timing itself. However, we removed SNPs at least nominally associated with 
height and BMI, and using this more stringent puberty-delaying genetic instrument showed 
the persistence of an association with lower pediatric aBMD in some of the methods used, 
but only at the LS in adults (Supplementary Table 12). This is consistent with the results of 
the GRS association models, in which the association remained at the spine even when 
height, weight, or BMI z-scores were adjusted for as covariates. Thus, while part of the link 
between puberty-associated genetic variants and aBMD occurs prior to puberty, during 
puberty skeletal development may also be influenced by the pubertal development process 
itself.
Clearly, during adolescence pubertal maturation and bone acquisition develop in tandem, 
and a complex relationship likely exists between genetic variation, puberty timing, and 
BMD, as evidenced by reciprocal MR analyses that showed a negative relationship between 
LS-BMD-associated genetic variants12 and AAM32 in some models (Supplementary Table 
13). Additionally, one genetic locus at chromosome 12q13 is genome-wide associated with 
both AAM17 and adult BMD13, although the lead variants differ and are in partial LD 
(rs1054442 (AAM) and rs12821008 (BMD), r2 = 0.57), and the causal gene(s) is unknown. 
Further work is needed to identify the key genes at these loci that mediate links between 
pubertal timing and bone acquisition.
The strengths of this study include the ability to address the association between puberty 
timing-associated variants and aBMD using several complementary approaches, assessing 
these genetic variants both individually and in combination, and addressing the association 
in both childhood/adolescence and adulthood in both sexes. However, while we demonstrate 
important relationships between bone health and puberty-delaying GRS, the use of GRS as 
an investigative tool is a relatively new area, and much remains to be learned about its 
optimal application. Furthermore, some of the observed puberty-adult BMD associations 
may in fact be present in children, but were not detected in our study due to the limited 
sample sizes available. Additionally, in this study we were unable to directly link the 
puberty-delaying, BMD-lowering GRS to osteoporosis risk, which should be the focus of 
further studies in elderly populations.
In conclusion, our results provide evidence delineating the genetic links between puberty 
timing and bone mineral accrual during critical years of skeletal development. Future studies 
should investigate specific functional mechanisms linking these two traits at various points 
to optimize bone health across the lifecourse.

 Key Messages
•
A genetic risk score for later puberty associates with lower bone mineral 
density, particularly at the lumbar spine, in children of both sexes
•
Mendelian randomization analysis supports a causal association between later 
puberty and lower lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density in 
children and adults
•
We identified two individual loci (at rs1054442 and rs10750766) associated 
with both pubertal timing and bone mineral density, but the causal genes at 
these loci require further investigation
•
Our results point toward shared genetic architecture between later-than-
average pubertal timing and lower bone mineral density present in childhood 
and adulthood and potentially impacts risk for osteoporosis, and therefore 
fracture risk, in later life

 Fig. 1. Mendelian randomization analysis of puberty timing (age at menarche) on pediatric 
lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (LS-aBMDz) in the BMDCS and in adults from the 
GEFOS consortium
Plots are shown of the effect sizes of the SNP-puberty associations (x-axis) versus the SNP-
aBMD associations (y-axis) with 95% Cis in (A) the pediatric and (B) the adult settings. 
Each colored line corresponds to a different MR method, with the slope of each line 
corresponding to the causal estimate. Below, funnel plots depicting the relationship between 
the causal effect of puberty timing on aBMD of each SNP plotted against the inverse of the 
standard error of the effect estimate are shown for (C) pediatric and (D) adult LS-aBMD. 
The symmetry of the funnel plot indicates a low risk of horizontal pleiotropy, and the MR
