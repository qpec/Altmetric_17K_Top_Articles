 Methods. A total of 728 patients with chronic non-
cancer pain were recruited from the waitlists of
eight multidisciplinary pain clinics across Canada.
Patients were assessed using self-administered
questionnaires
to
measure
demographic,
pain-
related (intensity, duration, interference, sleep prob-
lems), psychological (anxiety, anger, depressive
symptoms including suicidal ideation), cognitive (cat-
astrophizing,
attitudes/beliefs),
and
health-related
quality of life variables. A hierarchical logistic regres-
sion analysis was used to identify the factors that
were associated with presence/absence of suicidal
ideation while controlling for depressive symptoms.
Results. The results showed that being a male, longer
pain duration, higher anger levels, feelings of help-
lessness, greater pain magnification, and being more
depressed were significant independent predictor fac-
tors of suicidal ideation, while better perceived mental
health was related with a lesser likelihood of suicidal
ideation. Moreover, being in a relationship and believ-
ing in a medical cure for pain might be protective of
suicidal ideation while being anxious may be more
associated with suicidal ideation.
Conclusions. These results indicate that develop-
ment of suicidal ideation is more closely related to
pain chronicity and certain psychosocial factors than
how severe or physically incapacitating the pain is.
Many of these factors could potentially be modified by
early identification of suicidal ideation and developing
targeted cognitive interventions for suicidal at-risk pa-
tients. Research to examine the efficacy of these inter-
ventions for reducing suicidal ideation is warranted.

Introduction
Suicide is the fifteenth leading cause of death, account-
ing for at least 1.4% of all deaths worldwide [1].
Individuals
experiencing
chronic
non-cancer
pain
(CNCP) are an at-risk group for suicide as they are two
to three times more likely to endorse suicidal ideation
(SI), make suicidal attempts and complete suicide [2]
compared to those without CNCP. The World Health
Organization has recognized the importance of CNCP
as a risk factor for suicide and has recommended that
any individual over 10 years of age who presents a
CNCP condition should be assessed with respect to
potential suicidal behaviors [1,3]. However, in order to
determine the domains that should be part of such an
assessment, it is important to know the factors that are
associated with suicidal behaviors in individuals with
chronic pain (CP)—in particular, the factors that might
be modifiable and therefore could respond to treatment.
There is a growing body of research that has examined
the factors associated with SI, suicide attempts, and sui-
cide completion in individuals with CP. One review high-
lights the importance of both general demographic and
psychological factors (e.g., being a female, comorbid de-
pression) and pain-related risk factors (e.g., pain intensity,
sleep-onset insomnia, pain catastrophizing) as potential
predictors of suicide-related outcomes in individuals with
CNCP [2]. More recently, a narrative review has con-
firmed the relationships between CNCP and increased
risk of presence for all three suicidal variables [4].
In
this
context,
early-identification
of
potential
pre-
dictors associated with SI is of particular importance.
Unfortunately, much of the research done in this area is
based on [1] large epidemiological survey studies that
did not evaluate the relative importance of multiple
demographic and pain-related risk factors as predictors
of SI [2, 5–8]; studies with small numbers of subjects
[9–15], restraining the ability to detect associations due
to low power; and [3] studies examining SI in specific
CNCP
syndromes
[10,14–23],
limiting
the
potential
generalization of findings to other CNCP conditions.
Moreover, no study to date has investigated the rela-
tionship between SI and anger while only a few have
examined important modifiable factors such as pain cat-
astrophizing
[9,11,24],
pain-related
attitudes/beliefs
[9,11] or health-related quality of life [9,23,25]. Thus,
there is a need to identify possible risk factors in larger
samples of individuals experiencing CP.
Given these considerations, the aim of this study was to
identify the general and pain-related risk factors for SI in
a large tertiary care sample of individuals with CP.
Based on the results of previous research, we hypothe-
sized that demographic (being a female, being un-
employed or on disability), pain-related (pain intensity
and duration, pain interference, pain-related sleep prob-
lems), and psychological (anxiety) variables would all
make independent contributions to the prediction of SI
when depressive symptoms were controlled. We also
sought to examine other psychosocial factors (anger,
health-related quality of life, pain catastrophizing, and
pain-related attitudes/beliefs) that we anticipated might
be associated with SI.
Methods
Participants
The data used in the present study came from a larger
epidemiologic study (The Canadian STOP-PAIN Project).
Only variables that were needed to address the current
study objectives and hypotheses were used. Readers
interested in other research findings related to the
Canadian STOP-PAIN Project are referred to previous
published papers that also used data from this project
[26–28].

 The study sample consisted of 728 patients with CNCP
who agreed to participate in the study while they were
waiting to receive their first clinic appointment in one of
the eight participating multidisciplinary pain treatment
clinics located in seven provinces across Canada. A
total of 3343 letters were sent. From these, 1351 pa-
tients (40%) agreed to be contacted, 191 were not
reachable, 422 were not eligible, and 10 who were eli-
gible and were contacted did not complete all study
measures, resulting in a final study-corrected participa-
tion rate of 25%.
Procedures
The medical directors of each pain clinic sent a letter of
invitation to individuals who were waiting for their first ap-
pointment at the pain clinic. Those interested in partici-
pating were invited to return by mail a response card
confirming that they were willing to be contacted by one
of the study nurses to obtain further details about partici-
pation. The research nurse then called potential partici-
pants and the study was described to them. If patients
were interested in participating, the research nurse eval-
uated their eligibility and asked them to provide a written
consent form as well as to complete a series of self-
administered questionnaires that were sent by mail.
Study eligibility criteria were the following: 1) 18 years or
older, 2) capable of providing informed consent, 3) able
to complete questionnaires in French or English, and 4)
reported having a non-cancer related pain that has been
present for at least 6 months and that did not require ur-
gent medical care. All study participants provided signed
informed consent, and the research ethics boards of all
participating clinics approved the study.
Measures
Demographic Measures
All participants were asked to provide demographic in-
formation including sex, age, marital status, educational
level, and employment status.
Pain Characteristics and Physical Functioning
Participants were asked to indicate the duration of their
pain problem (months or years) and to rate their average
pain intensity during the past week using a 0–10 numer-
ical rating scale (NRS-11) (0 ¼ “No pain” to 10 ¼ “Worst
possible pain”) [29]. Pain interference was assessed
using the Pain interference scale of the Brief Pain
Inventory (BPI) [30]. The BPI consisted of seven items
(general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work,
sleep, relations with others, enjoyment of life) rated on a
0
to
10
NRS
(0 ¼ “Does
not
interfere”
and
10 ¼ “Completely interferes”) where patients were asked
to indicate to which degree their pain interfered with
their day-to-day activities over the previous 7 days. The
BPI interference items have been extensively used in
chronic non-cancer-related pain and BPI scores have
been shown to be valid and reliable [31–33]. Sleep
pain-related problems were examined using the Chronic
Pain Sleep Inventory (CPSI) [34]. The CPSI comprises
four items (difficulty to fall asleep, needs of sleep medi-
cation, awaken by pain during the night, awaken by
pain in the morning) which are rated on using a four-
point Likert scale ranging from 1¼ “Almost never” to
4 ¼ “Almost always.” An additional item measures over-
all sleep quality on a 0–10 scale (0 ¼ very bad, 10 ¼ ex-
cellent).
Reports
from
this
questionnaire
have
demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity
[34]. As suggested by the authors of this questionnaire,
we computed the sleep index (items 1, 3, and 4) that
has been considered to be reliable and more specific to
sleep pain-related problems [34].
Psychological Variables
Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were as-
sessed using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI-I) [35], which is one of the most widely used and
well-validated instruments available to measure depres-
sive symptoms in chronic pain populations. Moreover,
question 9 of the BDI has also often been used to as-
sess SI in pain research [11,13,15,23,24]. Patients were
asked to indicate the severity of 21 common depressive
symptoms (including one item asking about SI) on a 0
to 3 Likert scale indicating increasing symptom severity
over the last week. The total score is computed by
summing the items, and thus ranges from 0 to 63. The
measure also has standard cut offs used to classify indi-
viduals with respect to different levels of depression
(i.e., 0 to 9 ¼ no depression, 10 to 18 ¼ mild to moder-
ate depression, 19 to 29 moderate to severe depres-
sion, and 30 to 63 extremely severe depression). To
assess SI in the present study, the BDI item number 9
was employed to classify participants as having 1) no SI
(“Have no thoughts of killing myself”), 2) passive SI (“I
have thoughts of killing myself, but I would not carry
them out”), and 3) active SI (endorsing either “I would
like to kill myself” or “I would kill myself if I had the
chance”). Anxiety and anger levels during the past 2
weeks were also examined with two single 0 to 10 NRS
questions (How anxious [or angry] have you been feeling
in the past two weeks?) ranging from 0 ¼ “Not at all” to
10 ¼ “Extremely.”
Cognitive Variables
Pain-related attitudes/beliefs were examined using the
14-item Survey of Pain Attitudes-Short Form (SOPA-SF)
[29,36]. This questionnaire can be scored to assess
seven pain belief dimensions (control, disability, harm,
emotion, medication, solicitude, and medical cure) that
are hypothesized to play a role in adjustment to chronic
pain. Each belief item is rated on a five-point Likert
scale from 0 ¼ “This is very untrue for me” to 4 ¼ “This
Suicidal Ideation in Patients with CNCP

 is very true for me.” The SOPA has shown adequate
internal consistency, reliability, and convergent/discrim-
inant validity [36]. Catastrophic thoughts about pain
were assessed using the 13-item Pain Catastrophizing
Scale (PCS) [37] where patients are asked to rate on a
five-point Likert scale (0 ¼ “Not at all” to 4 ¼ “All the
time”) how often they have catastrophizing responses
while experiencing pain. The PCS is a frequently used
measure in pain research and PCS scores have demon-
strated to be valid and reliable in adult chronic pain
studies [38–40]. The PCS can be scored to assess
overall global catastrophizing, as well as three subdo-
mains of catastrophizing: rumination, magnification, and
helplessness subscales. Higher scores indicate greater
catastrophic thinking.
Health-Related Quality of Life
This
dimension
was
examined
using
the
Medical
Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey ver-
sion 2 (SF-36v2), a measure that has been extensively
used in chronic pain studies [41]. The SF-36v2 assesses
patients’ perceptions of their physical and psychological
health over the past month within eight different do-
mains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain,
general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional,
role limitations due to physical health problems, role lim-
itations due to emotional problems and mental health)
that can be summarized into a Physical and a Mental
Component Summary Score, where a higher score rep-
resents a better self-reported health state.
Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations for
continuous variables, frequency tables for categorical
variables) were first computed to assess passive (with-
out plan) and active (with a plan) SI as well as the levels
of depressive symptoms in the sample. The distribution
of the study variables was then examined to ensure that
they met the assumptions of the study planned statis-
tical analyses. Three demographic variables [marital sta-
tus
(single,
married,
common
law,
separated
or
divorced, widowed), employment status (full-time job,
part-time job, homemaker, student, retired, on tempor-
ary disability, on permanent disability, unemployed), and
education level (elementary school, high school, college-
technical school, university)] were dichotomized in order
to obtain an adequate number of patients per category
for the planed statistical analyses. The participants’ re-
sponse to item 9 of the BDI was also dichotomized into
1) those denying any SI (response of 0 to item 9) and 2)
those endorsing at least some SI (response of 1, 2, or
3) in order to perform the planned hierarchical logistic
regression analyses (HLRA) to test the study hypothesis
regarding the predictors of SI.
In order to control for the effects of depressive symp-
toms on SI, the BDI total score (with item 9 removed)
was entered first (Step 1) in the HLRA model. Using the
Enter method, the 23 variables of interest were then
added in Step 2 in order to assess whether they pre-
dicted
SI
independently
of
depressive
symptoms.
Considering the conservative nature of this analysis (i.e.,
the relationship between an individual predictor and SI
was only assessed with the relationships between all of
the other predictors and SI, and were removed from the
prediction equation), we also performed a series of ex-
ploratory HLRAs for each independent variable while
only controlling for depression levels in Step 1. This less
conservative approach allowed us to further explore po-
tential predictors of SI that might have been overlooked
in the main model. Semi-standardized beta coefficients
were calculated in order to estimate the relative import-
ance of the predicted probability of each variable in the
model. Since semi-standardized beta coefficients are
bounded by �1 and 1 standard deviation (SD), they can
be viewed as indicating the proportion of the maximum
possible change in the predicted probability of the out-
come [42]. Odd ratios (OR) obtained in the HLRA ana-
lyses were then further investigated in terms of effect
size [43] where small (d ¼ 0.25), medium (d ¼ 0.50), and
large (d ¼ 0.80) effect sizes represented OR values of
1.57, 2.47, and 4.25, respectively, and to 0.64, 0.40,
and 0.24 for OR < 1.00. All analyses were conducted
using SPSS version 17.0 (IBM, http://www-01.ibm.com/
software/analytics/spss/), with the exception of semi-
standardized beta weights, which were computed using
Microsoft Excel macro [42].
Results
Sample Characteristics
The sample was composed of 728 patients with CNCP
mostly middle-aged (Mean ¼ 50.8 years old, SD ¼ 12.6)
women (61%) who were married or living with a roman-
tic partner (64%). Close to one half of the patients re-
ported an education level that was lower or equivalent
to a high school degree (46%) and a high proportion
were currently unemployed or on temporary/permanent
disability (42%). Almost all of the participants (90%) re-
ported that they had constant pain. Participants’ mean
pain duration was 8.83 years (SD ¼ 9.15 years), with
pain onset associated with a trauma (42%), no specific
event (26%), an illness (19%), a surgery (9%), or other
causes (4%). At the time of recruitment, confirmation of
a chronic pain diagnosis was not possible because po-
tential study participants were still waiting to meet with
the pain clinic physician when they were enrolled.
Depressive Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation
As
shown
in
Table
1,
depression
was
commonly
experienced [mean (SD): 18.8 (610.1)] with 50% of the
patients reporting moderate to extremely severe depres-
sive symptoms while less than 20% had no depressive
symptoms. In addition, SI was frequent, with more than
1 out of 3 patients expressing either passive (31%) or
active (4%) SI.

 Identification of Factors Predicting the Presence/
Absence of Suicidal Ideation
All variables met the assumptions of the planned statis-
tical analyses. The depression variable (with SI item 9
removed) was entered at Step 1. The HLRA model was
statistically
significant
(v2¼152.36, df
1,
P < 0.001)
and
explained
27%
of
the
variance
[pseudo-R2
(Nagelkerke) ¼ 0.27] in SI while increasing the model
overall prediction to 75% with a correct percentage rate
of presence of SI of 49%. Results from Step 1 showed
that patients who reported being more depressed were
significantly more likely to also endorse the presence of
SI (OR ¼ 1.08, b
b ¼ 0.167, P < 0.001) (see Table 2).
In Step 2, the 23 variables of interest were then entered
as a block and explained an additional 11% of the vari-
ance in SI [pseudo-R2 (Nagelkerke) ¼ 0.38] (v2¼221.46,
df 24, P < 0.001). The overall prediction model remained
the same (75%), but the correct response rate for de-
tecting presence of SI increased by another 6%. As
shown in Table 2, of the demographic variables exam-
ined, only sex emerged as a significant predictor, with
men
reporting
significantly
more
SI
than
women
(OR ¼1.58, b
b ¼ 0.050, P ¼ 0.026). Longer pain duration
was also associated with the presence of SI (OR ¼ 1.02,
b
b ¼ 0.043, P ¼ 0.053). Neither average pain intensity nor
physical functioning variables (i.e., pain interference and
pain-related sleep problems) were found to be signifi-
cant predictors. For anxiety and anger levels, the results
showed that patients with higher anger levels were sig-
nificantly more likely to endorse the presence of SI
(OR ¼ 1.12, b
b ¼ 0.080, P ¼ 0.010). With respect to cata-
strophizing, patients who exaggerated or magnified the
threat value of their pain experience endorsed more SI
(OR ¼ 0.88, b
b ¼ 0.098, P ¼ 0.005). At first glance, this
result appears to be at odds with the data presented in
Table 2, where PCS magnification scale and SI are
negatively related ( b
b ¼ �0.133). However, further exam-
ination of the data (see below for more details) sug-
gested a suppression effect. Participants who reported
higher ratings of helplessness about their pain were
more likely to report having SI (OR ¼ 1.12, b
b ¼ 0.147,
P ¼ 0.001). We found no significant association between
SI and patients’ attitudes/beliefs toward pain. With re-
spect to patients’ health-related quality of life, our re-
sults revealed that those who perceived themselves to
have better mental health state were also more likely to
have less SI (OR ¼ 0.97, b
b ¼ 0.97, P < 0.017) whereas
no such difference was observed for perceived physical
health. The effect sizes of the individual predictors range
from very small to small (all ds � 0.25).
As indicated previously, exploratory HLRA analyses for
each independent variable were also performed control-
ling only for depression. As presented in Table 2 (last
two columns), in this analysis, sex no longer reaches
statistical significance (P ¼ 0.062), while pain duration,
SF36 mental component summary, anger levels, and
PCS helplessness scales remain significant. In addition,
we found that patients who reported being in a relation-
ship (married, common law) (P ¼ 0.047) and those who
tended to believe that a medical cure existed for their
pain were as well less likely to report SI (P ¼ 0.024). Our
results also showed that higher anxiety levels were
associated with SI endorsement (P ¼ 0.047). The effect
sizes ranged from very small to small in magnitude (all
ds � 0.20) (data not shown). In addition, we obtained a
pattern of results suggesting that the PCS magnification
scale was acting as a suppressor variable in our main
HLRA
model
(see
Results,
Depressive
Symptoms
and
Suicidal
Ideation).
Specifically,
we
observed
that
the
PCS
magnification
variable
became
non-
significant when entered after controlling for depression
(P ¼ 0.524). Knowing that the PCS magnification vari-
able was meeting the assumptions of the planned stat-
istical analyses (i.e., the PCS magnification scale was
significantly and positively correlated with the presence
of SI (r ¼ 0.22, P < 0.001) and was not strongly associ-
ated with any of the other independent variables, we
further explored the contribution of this variable by per-
forming a single logistic regression analysis between
PCS magnification and SI without controlling for depres-
sion. The results indicated that the PCS magnification
scale was significantly and positively associated with SI
(OR ¼ 1.54, b
b ¼ 0.14, P < 0.001) suggesting that the
PCS magnification variable provides a substantial indir-
ect contribution to the prediction of SI.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to better identify factors that
make independent contributions to the prediction of SI
in patients with CP. Male sex, longer pain duration,
higher anger levels, helplessness, pain magnification,
and depressive symptoms were associated with greater
likelihood of SI. In contrast, better perceived mental
health was an independent predictor of the absence of

 SI. Using exploratory HLRAs, our results also revealed
that patients involved in a partnered relationship (i.e.,
married/common law) and those who believed in a
medical cure for their pain were less at-risk for SI, while
those who reported being more anxious were more
likely to endorse SI. Contrary to our hypotheses, how-
ever, pain severity and physical disability were not sig-
nificantly associated with SI. In summary, these findings
suggest that SI is more closely related to psychologically
modifiable factors that can be targeted through cogni-
tive behavioral interventions than to pain-related factors.
Even though it is fairly well established in the general
population that being a woman, younger, less educated,
or unmarried were all important factors associated with
SI [44–47], these relationships do not seem as clear in
individuals with CP. Most studies having examined
demographic factors associated with SI in individuals
with CNCP found no support for a relationship with sex
[12–14,24,48],
age,
marital
status,
education
levels
[9,12–14,23,48,49],
and
work
status
[12,13,23,49],
while a few others have reported a relationship between
SI and female sex [49,50], older age [24], and being un-
employed or on disability [9,24,51]. In our study, the
male sex was identified as a significant predictor of SI,
albeit
only
when
the
other
predictor
factors
were
included in the model. Interestingly, we observed a simi-
lar trend in one of our previous studies [9], where being
a man was associated with SI at a univariate level, but
was no longer significant when other demographic vari-
ables
were
entered
into
a
regression
model.
Considering the inconsistencies in the pain literature,
further research is needed to elucidate the relationship
between sex and SI in individuals with CP. Furthermore,
we found that being in a relationship emerged as a pro-
tective factor for SI. This finding is consistent with a

 large number of studies showing that global marital sat-
isfaction, higher perceived social support, and partner
positive responses are associated with less depressive
symptom severity and better psychological well-being in
individuals with chronic pain [52–60]. This research sup-
ports the view that perceived social support buffers the
effects of stress on depressive symptoms [61–63],
therefore suggesting that perceived social support may
also decrease the likelihood of SI. Another plausible ex-
planation may be found in the interpersonal theory of
suicide [64], which proposes that thwarted belonging-
ness can lead a person to develop SI, and that less so-
cial
isolation—associated
with
being
involved
in
a
relationship—decreases that risk. These findings raise
the possibility that a brief intervention aimed at educat-
ing spouses or significant others with respect to positive
responses (i.e., providing positive reinforcement) while
also diminishing social isolation may also reduce the risk
for SI. Research to examine this possibility is warranted.
With respect to pain-related variables, contrary to our
hypothesis, we found that only longer pain duration was
a significant predictor of SI, while pain intensity, pain
interference, and pain-related sleep quality were not.
The CNCP literature seems inconsistent in this regard.
Some research supports the view that longer pain dur-
ation [16,24,49], higher pain intensity, greater pain inter-
ference [11,14,22–25], and sleep problems [9,13,22,25]
are related to SI whereas several other studies have
found
no
such
associations
(pain
duration
[9,12,14,24,48],
intensity
[9,12,13,48],
interference
[9,13,48], and sleep problems [14,23,48]). One explan-
ation for why we only found longer pain duration to be a
predictor of SI might be related to the lack of timely ac-
cess to multidisciplinary pain clinics in Canada [65].
More than half of the patients waited six months or
more to obtain health care services, which is an un-
acceptable wait-time for pain treatment and contributes
to patient deterioration [65,66]. Therefore, it is plausible
that, as pain becomes more chronic, the time factor be-
comes a stronger predictor of SI, underlining a global
worsening of patient health over time.
It is well documented in the general population that
mood and anxiety disorders are related to SI [1,44,
45,67]. These relationships also appear to be present in
the CNCP literature, where most studies have found
that patients who reported greater anxiety [5,21–25,68]
and
depressive
symptoms
[5,14,15,17,18,21–
25,48,50,69] were also more likely to present with SI. In
this study, we replicated this relationship between de-
pressive symptoms and SI while controlling for other
variables of interest. However, anxiety only emerged as
a predictor of SI when we performed additional explora-
tory analyses, which might be explained by the fact that
we only used a single-item NRS measure. A very limited
amount of research has examined the relationship be-
tween anger and SI in adults. One recent population-
based study showed that anger was an independent
predictor of SI [70]. In our study, we also found support
for
such
a
relationship
using
a
single-item
NRS.
Because of the paucity of research on anger and SI,
additional research is needed to determine the reliability
of this finding.
Our results also showed that patients who perceived
their mental—but not physical—health as better were
less likely to report SI, replicating the findings of two re-
cent CNCP studies [9,25]. For pain catastrophizing and
pain-related attitudes/beliefs, we found that feeling more
helpless about pain and reporting greater pain magnifi-
cation were significantly associated with SI. Only one
pain-related belief appeared to be associated with SI
when we performed separated exploratory HLRA; pa-
tients who believed more in a medical cure for their pain
were less likely to have SI, suggesting that having hope
about treatment for their CNCP might be a protective
factor. However, in a previous study [9], we examined
PCS and SOPA variables in patients with CNCP and
found that only helplessness, but not other beliefs, pre-
dicted SI. Thus, the pain beliefs that are consistently
associated with SI across different samples remain un-
clear. Although the significant findings that do emerge
are consistent with a model suggesting hope as a pro-
tective factor and hopelessness/helplessness as risk
factors for SI.
In a study using a large sample of patients, Edwards
and colleagues [24] found that catastrophizing predicted
the severity of SI, and that catastrophizing and depres-
sive symptoms interacted such that higher scores on
both of these variables (over and above their individual
effect) were associated with more SI. In a recent review
[71] these authors suggested that catastrophizing and
depressive symptoms have their effects on pain via
complex and shared behavioral, cognitive, physiological
interacting pathways. Their findings shed some light on
why, in our study, pain magnification appears to have
exerted a suppressor effect (i.e., indirect contributor to
the other variables, more particularly depression in im-
proving the regression effect) in our HLRA. Further stud-
ies are needed to more closely examine the role of
catastrophizing and its interrelationship with depressive
symptoms in SI.
Our study has a number of important limitations, most
of which have been discussed in previously published
papers [26–28]. These include the fact that our study
only included Canadian tertiary care patients and there-
fore the findings cannot necessarily be generalized to
other populations of individuals with CNCP who are
treated in the primary or secondary sectors of care in
Canada or elsewhere in the world. In addition, the lack
of inclusion of measures of pain location(s) and type(s)
of pain (e.g., myofascial versus neuropathic) precluded
us from performing subgroup analyses, which might
have revealed that patients with certain type of pain
syndromes might be more or less at-risk of reporting SI.
Another limitation is related to the low study response
rate (25%), where non-participants may or may not

 differ with respect to presence/absence of SI. In add-
ition, whether participants and non-participants differed
in terms of their CNCP profile was not possible to evalu-
ate, because the latter group did not provide informed
consent for collecting these data. It is therefore possible
that the rates of SI found in our study either over- or
under-estimated the true rates in the population with
CP. However, even though the present study may suffer
from potential sample biases, it also has a number of
important strengths, such as its large sample size and
the use of a multicentre design, which enrolled partici-
pants across Canada. Another important limitation is
that, in order to keep questionnaires administration
within a reasonable completion time, we choose to use
only two single NRS items to measure anxiety and
anger rather than more extensive and perhaps more re-
liable instruments such as the Beck Anxiety Inventory
[72] or the Clinical Anger Scale [73]. Use of such meas-
ures may have provided more sensitivity and specificity.
Finally, although several previous studies also examined
SI using item 9 of the BDI [11,13,23–25], it could be
argued that a single item is insufficient to reflect the
presence/absence of SI. It is unclear whether we would
have obtained the same findings if we had used a more
detailed measure of SI, such as the Suicidal Behavior
Questionnaire Revised [74] or a clinical diagnostic ap-
proach. Furthermore, the used of a depression measure
that did not have a SI question such as, for example,
the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale
[75] might also have possibly yielded different results.
In spite of these limitations, the present study carried
out in a large sample of patients with CNCP suggests
that being a male, longer pain duration, higher anger
levels, helplessness, pain magnification, and depressive
symptoms were associated with SI, whereas patients
who perceived their mental health as better were less at
risk of reporting SI. Moreover, being in a relationship
and believing in a medical cure for pain might be pro-
tective of SI while those with higher anxiety levels were
also more likely to endorse SI. These results support the
conclusion that SI is more strongly associated with pain
chronicity and psychosocial factors than pain severity or
the extent to which pain is physically incapacitating.
In addition, the present findings have important clinical
implications. By improving our knowledge about the fac-
tors that are associated with SI, they provide for an em-
pirically based way of identifying patients with CNCP
who are at risk for SI. Although more research to deter-
mine the reliability of our results would be useful, clin-
icians should consider using the variables found to
predict SI in this study as potential “red flags” that may
identify patients who are at risk of developing (or have
already developed) SI. For such patients, clinicians may
choose to develop standardized procedures that are
suitable to their clinical setting to provide more timely
interventions (e.g., moving these patients up on a wait-
ing list, referring them to a psychologist, etc.) in order to
prevent suicide risk and to more effectively reduce their
suffering. Importantly, given that a number of these
factors are modifiable (e.g., depression, anger, feeling
helplessness, pain magnification), an important next
step is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of targeted
cognitive-behavioral interventions for these patients.
