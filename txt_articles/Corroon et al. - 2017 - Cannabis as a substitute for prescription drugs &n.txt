Background: The use of medical cannabis is increasing, most commonly for pain, anxiety and 
depression. Emerging data suggest that use and abuse of prescription drugs may be decreasing 
in states where medical cannabis is legal. The aim of this study was to survey cannabis users to 
determine whether they had intentionally substituted cannabis for prescription drugs.
Methods: A total of 2,774 individuals were a self-selected convenience sample who reported 
having used cannabis at least once in the previous 90 days. Subjects were surveyed via an online 
anonymous questionnaire on cannabis substitution effects. Participants were recruited through 
social media and cannabis dispensaries in Washington State.
Results: A total of 1,248 (46%) respondents reported using cannabis as a substitute for pre-
scription drugs. The most common classes of drugs substituted were narcotics/opioids (35.8%), 
anxiolytics/benzodiazepines (13.6%) and antidepressants (12.7%). A total of 2,473 substitutions 
were reported or approximately two drug substitutions per affirmative respondent. The odds 
of reporting substituting were 4.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.87–5.43) greater among 
medical cannabis users compared with non-medical users and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.27–2.16) greater 
among those reporting use for managing the comorbidities of pain, anxiety and depression. A 
slightly higher percentage of those who reported substituting resided in states where medical 
cannabis was legal at the time of the survey (47% vs. 45%, p=0.58), but this difference was not 
statistically significant.
Discussion: These patient-reported outcomes support prior research that individuals are using 
cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs, particularly, narcotics/opioids, and independent 
of whether they identify themselves as medical or non-medical users. This is especially true if 
they suffer from pain, anxiety and depression. Additionally, this study suggests that state laws 
allowing access to, and use of, medical cannabis may not be influencing individual decision-
making in this area.
Keywords: cannabis, marijuana, prescription drugs, pain, analgesics, opioid
Introduction
The past two decades have brought about a prodigious change in state laws and social 
policies regarding the use of cannabis for medical and other purposes. Twenty-eight 
states and the District of Columbia currently enforce legalized medical cannabis 
laws. Eight of these states and the District of Columbia have also legalized cannabis 
for recreational use.1 Among other factors, these legislative and policy changes have 
resulted in shifts in social acceptance and cannabis use patterns in the US population, 
some of which have been driven by a growing understanding of the medicinal value 
of cannabis.2

According to the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics 
and Quality (CBHSQ), past-month use of cannabis has risen 
steadily each year in the general population from 5.8% in 
2007 to 8.4% in 2014. In 2015, an estimated 22.2 million 
of >265 million Americans aged ≥12 years reported having 
used cannabis in the past month (8.3%).3
In addition to changing use patterns, recent research sug-
gests that physicians’ drug prescribing patterns may also be 
changing in states with legalized medical cannabis. Bradford 
and Bradford4 reported a drop in filled prescriptions in such 
states between 2010 and 2013 for drugs under Medicare 
Part D for the treatment of conditions such as pain, anxiety, 
depression and others. The US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) has issued federal guidelines on the 
long-term use of opiates, noting concerns that there may 
be negative unintended consequences associated with dose 
reduction, such as patients switching to the use of heroin.5 An 
alternative for patients with chronic pain is switching to the use 
of cannabis to navigate dose reduction and to treat their pain 
and/or comorbid conditions outright.6 A recent open-label, 
prospective study suggests that medical cannabis may decrease 
opioid use and benefit patients with treatment-resistant pain.7
Here, we analyzed self-reported data for frequency of 
prescription drug substitution with cannabis use across 
sociodemographic characteristics, prescription drug class, 
state legalization policies for medical cannabis and global 
quality of life health scores.
Methods
Survey
The institutional review board (IRB) of Bastyr University 
approved the protocol. Procedures were in accordance with 
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, as 
revised in 2008. Documentation of consent was waived in 
accordance with Department of Health & Human Services 
regulation 45 CFR 46.117(c) by the IRB of Bastyr Univer-
sity on the basis that the research presents no more than 
minimal risk of harm. The only record linking the subject 
with the research would be the consent document, and thus, 
the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a 
breach of confidentiality. A literature review was conducted 
to identify existing epidemiological surveys of cannabis 
use.8–13 The authors developed a novel questionnaire by 
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of existing surveys 
to meet the goals of this study. Drafts were circulated to 
physician researchers and cannabis users for feedback in an 
iterative process. The final survey consisted of 44 structured 
questions answered by yes/no, multiple choice, open-ended 
response fields and rating scales.14 These included patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) using the PROMIS® Global 
Health 10-item short form (part of a National Institutes of 
Health [NIH] initiative to produce validated, self-reported 
item banks for physical, mental, emotional and social 
health) to measure overall well-being. Study data were 
collected and managed using Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap), a secure tool allowing participants to 
directly enter responses.15
Subjects were a self-selected convenience sample who 
accessed the survey through links posted on the Center for the 
Study of Cannabis and Social Policy and Bastyr University 
websites, a Facebook page, flyers in Washington State can-
nabis dispensaries or word of mouth from December 2013 
to January 2016. Recruitment strategies included Bastyr 
University medical students circulating the survey through 
their own social media, by distributing IRB-approved fliers 
to local medical cannabis dispensaries in Washington State, 
through public lectures describing the questionnaire at King 
County Library Systems locations, in an article written for 
an online Cannabis magazine and through an article posted 
to an online group located at momswithms.org. The only 
inclusion criterion was having used cannabis at least once 
in the past 90 days. A total of 31 respondents from the 2,864 
respondents were deemed ineligible and excluded based on 
this criterion. Another 14 were excluded for failure to answer 
the eligibility question. To minimize risk to participants, 
no identifying information was collected. Individuals were 
given the opportunity to provide a five-digit code that enabled 
repeat responses to be identified with only the first response 
analyzed. A total of 389 (10.4%) individuals failed to provide 
this code and were included in the final analysis. A total of 
45 repeat responders were identified and deleted, leaving a 
total of 2,774 eligible respondents. Individuals were told that 
they could skip any question(s) they did not wish to answer. 
Those who refused to provide a five-digit code were included 
based on the rationale that fear of lost anonymity is more 
likely to motivate response refusal than repeat participation.
Data sources and measurement
Prescription drug substitution was evaluated by asking survey 
respondents, “Have you ever used cannabis as a substitute for 
prescription drugs (yes/no)?” If the respondent answered in 
the affirmative, an open-ended response field was available 
with the instructions, “Please list prescription drugs that you 
have substituted cannabis for:”.
If a specific number of prescription drugs were entered 
into the open-ended response field, values were coded as the

Cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs – a cross-sectional study
number of drugs per category. For example, “opiate pain 
killers (Roxicet, Percocet, Vicodin) and benzos (Xanax)” 
was counted as three substitutions in the drug category of 
narcotics/opioids and one substitution in the drug category 
of benzodiazepines. If a specific number of prescription 
drugs were not entered, values were coded as the number 
of drug categories. For example, “opiates and pain killers, 
muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety meds and depression meds” 
was counted as one substitution for the following four drug 
categories: narcotics/opioids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics 
and antidepressants.
All nonspecific drug entries mentioning “anxiety” (e.g., 
“anxiety meds”) were categorized as anxiolytics and then 
combined with drugs in the benzodiazepines category to 
form the broader category of anxiolytics/benzodiazepines. 
Combination drugs were recorded in multiple categories 
where appropriate, except for combinations of opioids and 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Generic 
values like “pain medicine” were categorized as narcotics/
opioids, as opposed to NSAIDs/non-opioid analgesics. 
Generic values like “prescription headache medication” were 
categorized as anti-migraine, despite the absence of language 
confirming the headaches were actually migraines.
Drugs available over the counter (OTC), and entered 
with specific names, were recorded as prescription drugs. 
For example, “ibuprofen” was assumed to be prescrip-
tion ibuprofen, given the nature of the question(s) in the 
survey.
Type of cannabis use was determined by asking the 
question, “What kind of user do you consider yourself to 
be?” Respondents were given four, non-mutually exclusive 
options: “recreational user”, “medically indicated, recom-
mended by licensed provider”, “medically indicated, self-
prescribed” and “religious (e.g., Rastafari)”. For the purposes 
of this analysis, medical cannabis users were defined as 
those respondents identified as either “medically indicated, 
recommended by licensed provider” or “medically indicated, 
self-prescribed”, including those who were also identified as 
a “recreational user”.
Data analyses
Data analyses were conducted using SAS University Edition 
(SAS 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Univariate 
and bivariate comparisons were conducted using PROC 
FREQ and chi-square tests. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to 
estimate strength of association using PROC LOGISTIC. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS) scores were calculated using the recom-
mended scoring method that calibrates each score to a US 
national mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10.16 
T-scores were calculated for only those respondents who 
answered all questions of the short form. Mean differences 
between PROMIS mental health and PROMIS physical health 
scores were computed using a two-sample t-test using PROC 
TTEST. Statistical significance was assessed using an alpha 
value of 0.05. Figures were produced using Microsoft Excel 
for Mac, version 15.27.
Results
Demographics
A total of 2,774 respondents were included in the final 
study population. A majority of respondents were males 
(55.72%), aged <36 years (62.71%), Caucasian (86.13%), 
residing in the US (83.02%) and identifying themselves as 
medical cannabis users (59.81%; Table 1). All 50 US states 
and >42 countries were represented in the survey. Just over 
half of respondents reported residing in the following states: 
Washington (32.50%), California (8.47%), Oregon (5.89%) 
or Colorado (4.27%).
A total of 1,248 respondents, or ~46% of respondents, 
responded affirmatively to the question, “Have you ever used 
cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs?” The odds 
of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs 
increased with age, up to 65 years of age (Table 2). The odds 
of reporting substituting were 1.21 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.04–1.40) greater among females than males and 1.58 
(95% CI, 1.00–2.48) greater among Native American/Asian/
Pacific Islanders than Caucasians. Geographically, the odds 
of reporting substituting were greater among those residing 
in Canada (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.82–1.76) and lesser among 
those residing in Europe (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72–1.21) as 
compared to those residing in the US. These geographical 
comparisons were not statistically significant.
Substitution for prescription drugs
A total of 1,248 respondents reported a total of 2,473 substi-
tutions of prescription drugs. This represents approximately 
two drug substitutions per affirmative respondent. The 
most common classes of drugs substituted were narcotics/
opioids (35.8%), anxiolytics/benzodiazepines (13.6%) and 
antidepressants (12.7%; Figure 1). Substituting cannabis for 
narcotics/opioids was 2.6 times more frequent than substi-
tuting cannabis for anxiolytics/benzodiazepines, the second 
most commonly substituted drug category.

Medical versus non-medical users
The odds of reporting substituting were 4.59 (95% CI, 
 
3.87–5.43) times greater among self-identified medical 
cannabis users as compared to non-medical cannabis users. 
Approximately one-quarter (24.43%) of non-medical users 
reported substituting cannabis for prescription drugs (Table 2).
The relationship between user type (ie, medical or non-
medical) and frequency of reported substitution was assessed 
independently for males and females and for different catego-
ries of age. The odds of substituting were more than six times 
greater (OR, 6.09; 95% CI, 4.65–7.80) among female medical 
users than among female non-medical users. Similarly, the 
odds were 3.7 times (95% CI, 2.91–4.57) greater among male 
medical users. A trend in the odds of substituting among 
medical users was also seen with increased age (Table 3).

Cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs – a cross-sectional study
Comorbidities
We previously reported in an earlier survey that of 1,429 
respondents, 61% reported using cannabis for managing pain, 
58% reported using cannabis for anxiety and 50% reported 
using cannabis for depression.6 In the current analysis, these 
same conditions were also the most commonly reported 
conditions by respondents. Of the 1,040 participants report-
ing pain and/or intractable pain, 619 (59.52%) reported 
depression and anxiety as comorbidities. As such, the odds 
of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were 
more than one and a half times greater (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 
1.27–2.16) among those reporting using it to manage pain, 
anxiety and depression than among those using it to manage 
only one of the three conditions.
States with legalized medical marijuana
A slightly higher percentage of those who reported substitut-
ing resided in states where medical cannabis was legal at the 
time of the survey (47% vs. 44%, p=0.47). This difference 
was not statistically significant.
PROMIS Global Health
The 10-item short form developed and published by PROMIS 
was used to arrive at a bottom-line indicator of self-reported 
health status. By summing the physical and mental health 
scores separately (using only participants with complete 
data on each subscale), the standard PROMIS raw score to 
T-score conversion allowed for comparing our sample with 
the general population. The distributions are standardized 
such that a score of 50 represents the mean for the US gen-
eral population, with an SD of 10 points. A total of 1,186 
respondents (43%) provided complete information for the 
10-item short form. For mental health, the sample scored 
39.34 (SD=5.05; 95% CI, 39.15–39.53). For physical health, 
the sample scored 40.26 (SD=3.94; 95% CI, 40.11–40.41), 
placing these respondents below average for global mental 
health and global physical health as compared with the 
general population. Those reporting substituting cannabis 
for prescription drugs scored similar to the overall sample 
population (mental health, mean: 39.75 [SD=5.32; 95% CI, 
39.45–40.05]; physical health, mean: 39.80 [SD=4.00; 95% 
CI, 39.57–40.02]). In terms of the PROMIS raw scores (i.e., 
non-T-score-converted scores), those who reported substitut-
ing had slightly higher mental health scores (mean difference: 
0.31; p<0.001) and slightly lower physical health scores

Sensitivity analysis
A total of 389 respondents failed to provide a 5-digit code 
anonymously identifying themselves as unique respon-
dents. When excluded from the analysis, the percentage of 
respondents reporting ever using cannabis as a substitute 
for prescription drugs increased from 45.55% (n=1,248) to 
46.28% (n=1,094), an increase of 1%.
The odds of reporting substituting among medical users 
versus non-medical users decreased from 4.59 (95% CI, 
3.87–5.43) to 4.54 (95% CI, 3.78–5.45), a decrease of 1.5%. 
Finally, while the total number of prescription drug substitu-
tions by drug category decreased from 2,473 to 2,160, the 
per respondent substitution ratio remained two substitutions 
per respondent.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine whether, and 
how often, cannabis users report substituting cannabis for 
prescription drugs. Overall, these PROs underscore four key 
points: 1) individuals are substituting cannabis for prescrip-
tion drugs, independent of whether they identify themselves 
as medical users (medical users are doing so at almost five 
times the odds of non-medical users) and independent of 
legal access to medical cannabis; 2) this practice increases 
in frequency with age, up to 65 years, and is more common 
in females, particularly female medical users, and Native 
American/Asians/Pacific Islanders; 3) the most common 
classes of substitution were narcotics/opioids, anxiolytics/
benzodiazepines and antidepressants; and 4) the odds of 
reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were 
more than one and a half times greater among those reporting 
the use of cannabis to manage pain, anxiety and depression 
than among those using it to manage only one of these three 
conditions. Stated differently, pain, anxiety and depression 
seem to represent a comorbidity triad that is associated with 
greater substitution frequency.
These data are in line with previous research suggesting 
that cannabis is commonly used as a substitute for prescrip-
tion drugs. For example, in 2013 and 2016, Lucas et al17,18 
found that 68% of 259 and 87% of 410 physician-authorized 
medical cannabis users in Canada reported substituting can-
nabis for alcohol and illicit or prescription drugs, respectively. 
In 2017, Lucas and Walsh19 found that 63% of 271 such 
subjects reported substituting cannabis for prescription drugs 
such as opioids (30%), benzodiazepines (16%) and antide-
pressants (12%), representing the same top three categories 
as data presented here. These findings also agree with our 
previous data showing that medical cannabis users report 
using cannabis most frequently to manage pain, anxiety and 
depression.6 The present study contributes to a greater under-
standing of substitution across specific classes of prescription 
drugs in a largely US-based sample, in a much larger cohort 
and cross-section, occurring among both medical and non-
medical subjects, and in areas without legal access.
While the results of research on the effects of cannabis 
for medical use have been largely mixed, our previous study 
indicated that patients reporting using cannabis for managing 
pain are experiencing adequate symptom relief.6 In 2016, 
Boehnke et al conducted a survey at a medical cannabis 
dispensary and found a 64% decrease in opioid use among 
those reporting using cannabis for chronic pain (n=118). 
Respondents also reported a reduction in other classes of 
drugs, including antidepressants and NSAIDs, as well as a

Cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs – a cross-sectional study
decrease in the number of side effects of medications.20 This 
study highlights differences between those with the comor-
bidities of pain, anxiety and depression and those with only 
one of the morbidities.
This team previously reported that in a survey of 1,429 
medical cannabis users, 61% reported cannabis use for pain, 
58% reported cannabis use for anxiety and 50% reported 
using cannabis to manage depression.6 In 2016, Dale and 
Stacey21 reported that those using cannabis for pain were 
more likely to be substituting for prescription drugs. In 
2017, Walsh et al published a review of medical cannabis 
and mental health to try to better understand how medical 
cannabis use may impact areas of potential concern for 
clinicians. “Relaxation and relief of anxiety” and “relief of 
negative mood” or depression were among the most widely 
reported conditions in 60 publications included in their 
analysis.22 Because it is common for chronic pain patients 
to be prescribed combinatorial pharmacotherapy to address 
comorbidity with depression and/or anxiety, it is largely 
unknown how often patients may be discontinuing prescrip-
tion medications when initiating cannabis use.21 Doctors need 
to have open communication with their patients regarding 
these matters in order to ensure that the medical community 
does not repeat the prescribing mistakes made in the past 
with opioid pharmacotherapy, namely, unchecked use of 
medical cannabis that leads to adverse events and abuse.23 
Furthermore, these preliminary data can serve to drive pro-
spective research focused on whether cannabis can assist in 
opioid tapering protocols so that doctors can offer patients 
science-based guidance.
Importantly, older individuals may be substituting can-
nabis for prescription drugs at a higher rate than the general 
population, a finding in line with previous research.4 There are 
very little data on the impact of cannabis use in elderly popu-
lations. Our data show a trend toward increased substitution 
with age, perhaps not surprisingly, as older populations are 
more likely to be prescribed prescription drugs, particularly 
psychotropic medications.24,25
We previously reported that medical cannabis users are 
evaluating cannabis products for the presence of a secondary, 
non-intoxicating cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), ~40% of 
the time.6 CBD does not have the same action at the can-
nabinoid receptor as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the 
primary intoxicating constituent in cannabis. To avoid adverse 
effects, particularly in elderly populations, the application 
of CBD-dominant cannabis varietals and preparations may 
be warranted. There is a need for more research on mental 
health disorders and cannabis use, particularly with a focus 
on CBD rather than THC-dominant cannabis.22 This informa-
tion is needed for doctors to be able to adequately participate 
in conversations with their patients, regardless of age, about 
the role that medical cannabis may play in managing mental 
health conditions.26
We previously reported on gender differences in cannabis 
use and effects, highlighting the need for focused research 
on this topic.27 Importantly, there is evidence of differences 
in endocannabinoid system function across gender.28–30 Here, 
we report that female users may be more likely to substitute 
cannabis than male users (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04–1.40) 
and that female medical users may be much more likely to 
substitute cannabis than female non-medical users (OR, 6.09; 
95% CI, 4.65–7.80). These findings are interesting given that 
females reported significantly less frequency and quantity of 
use in our previous study. In that study, women were more 
likely to report use for anxiety, nausea, anorexia and migraine 
headaches than men. Taken together, these findings provide 
preliminary data for future studies on gender-based differ-
ences in cannabis use and effects.
This study showed a nonsignificant difference between 
the proportion of individuals reporting substituting cannabis 
for prescription drugs in states with legalized medical can-
nabis versus states where cannabis remains illegal (47% vs. 
44%, p=0.47). This finding suggests that state laws allowing 
access to, and use of, medical cannabis may not be influenc-
ing individual decision making in this area. This finding is 
in contrast to other studies showing that the use of prescrip-
tion drugs fell in states once medical cannabis laws were 
implemented.4 This finding has public health implications 
and should be explored further.
As compared with the general population, survey respon-
dents scored below average for global mental health and 
global physical health on the PROMIS 10-item short form. 
This association deserves further attention to determine 
whether individuals with lesser mental/physical health are 
using cannabis as a medical therapy or whether cannabis use 
is negatively affecting mental/physical health.
Given the current nationwide epidemic of prescription 
opioid-related abuse, addiction and death, there is an urgent 
need for alternatives with efficacy and safer toxicology pro-
files.31 It is important to note that active “substitution” with 
cannabis may be a conscious decision to reduce harm caused 
by narcotics.32 Not only may opioid therapy prove ineffec-
tive for some patients but it may also induce serious adverse 
reactions that complicate management, including allodynia 
or opioid-induced hyperalgesia, also known as “paradoxi-
cal pain”.33 Chronic pain is an “expensive” condition, both

economically and socially, yet existing pharmacotherapeutic 
interventions are not always adequate.34–36 Taken with pre-
clinical data on the role of the endocannabinoid system in 
stress, pain processing and immune homeostasis, it is clear 
that future investigation is warranted using controlled tri-
als with human subjects to better understand the role that 
cannabis may play in treating pain, anxiety, depression and 
other conditions.37–46
Limitations
The study population was a self-selected convenience sample, 
and it is possible that individuals with favorable opinions 
of, and experiences with, cannabis are more likely to have 
responded to the questionnaire than those with negative 
opinions and experiences. This, when considered with the 
predominance of males, Caucasians and individuals aged 
<35 years, indicates that our sample may not be representa-
tive of the general population. In addition, PROs are subject 
to reporting bias.47,48
Another limitation of this study was the method by which 
prescription drug information was collected. The availability 
of an open-ended response field enabled narrative responses 
that made accurate categorization difficult. In some instances, 
this limitation may have resulted in undercounting. For 
example, a response of “a variety of SSRIs” was counted as 
one drug substitution in the drug category antidepressants. 
In other instances, it may have resulted in overcounting. 
For example, a response of “opiate pain killers (Roxicet, 
Percocet, Vicodin)” was counted as three substitutions in the 
drug category of narcotics/opioids, yet the respondent may 
have only substituted cannabis for “Vicodin” after previously 
trying “Roxicet” and “Percocet”. Additionally, drugs that are 
available both OTC and via prescription (e.g., ibuprofen) 
were counted as prescription substitutions, given the nature 
of the question. The substitution count for these OTC drugs 
would be overestimated if these drugs were not prescribed.
Data for determining the proportion of individuals report-
ing substituting cannabis for prescription drugs in states with 
legal versus illegal medical cannabis policies were analyzed as 
of December 31, 2016. Several states may not have had legal 
medical cannabis policies at the time an individual completed 
the survey, but did have such policies at the time of analysis, 
which may falsely increase the proportion of those reporting 
substituting in states with legalized medical cannabis.
Conclusion
These data contribute to a growing body of literature sug-
gesting cannabis, legal or otherwise, is being used as a 
substitute for prescription drugs, particularly prescription 
pain relievers. According to the CDC, 259 million prescrip-
tions for pain relievers were written by health care providers 
in 2012.49 In 2015, two million Americans aged ≥12 years 
had a substance use disorder that involved prescription 
pain relievers.50 The CDC also reports that overdoses from 
prescription opioids are a “driving factor” in the increase in 
opiate overdose deaths over the past 15 years. Such deaths 
have more than quadrupled in the same time period with 
>20,000 overdose deaths attributable to prescription pain 
relievers alone.51
Despite the illegality of cannabis in many states and the 
lack of professional guidance on dosing, routes of delivery 
and inadequate standardization or quality control for medical 
use, individuals are taking it upon themselves to augment, 
or discontinue, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved drugs in favor of a largely unregulated herbal one.
