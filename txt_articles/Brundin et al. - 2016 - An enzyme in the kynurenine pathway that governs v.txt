Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation has a key role in depression and suicidal behavior. The kynurenine pathway is
involved in neuroinflammation and regulates glutamate neurotransmission. In the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of suicidal patients,
levels of inflammatory cytokines and the kynurenine metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist,
are increased. The enzyme amino-β-carboxymuconate-semialdehyde-decarboxylase (ACMSD) limits QUIN formation by competitive
production of the neuroprotective metabolite picolinic acid (PIC). Therefore, decreased ACMSD activity can lead to excess QUIN. We
tested the hypothesis that deficient ACMSD activity underlies suicidal behavior. We measured PIC and QUIN in CSF and plasma
samples from 137 patients exhibiting suicidal behavior and 71 healthy controls. We used DSM-IV and the Montgomery-Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale and Suicide Assessment Scale to assess behavioral changes. Finally, we genotyped ACMSD tag single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 77 of the patients and 150 population-based controls. Suicide attempters had reduced PIC and
a decreased PIC/QUIN ratio in both CSF (Po0.001) and blood (P = 0.001 and Po0.01, respectively). The reductions of PIC in CSF
were sustained over 2 years after the suicide attempt based on repeated measures. The minor C allele of the ACMSD SNP rs2121337
was more prevalent in suicide attempters and associated with increased CSF QUIN. Taken together, our data suggest that increased
QUIN levels may result from reduced activity of ACMSD in suicidal subjects. We conclude that measures of kynurenine metabolites
can be explored as biomarkers of suicide risk, and that ACMSD is a potential therapeutic target in suicidal behavior.

INTRODUCTION
Suicide is defined as the intentional termination of one’s own life,
and constitutes the 10th leading cause of death globally.1
According to a recent report by the World Health Organization,
4800 000 deaths by suicide occur around the world each year.2
Over the past decade, accumulating clinical data indicate that
inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of suicide.
Recent
meta-analyses
on
inflammation
in
suicidal
patients
conclude that there are aberrant cytokine levels in blood,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and post-mortem brain samples from
suicidal patients.3,4 Increased blood levels of tumor necrosis
factor-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 are associated with suicidal
ideation and behavior, and therefore these cytokines have been
proposed to constitute biomarkers to help distinguish suicidal
from nonsuicidal patients.5,6 We have found that the CSF levels of
IL-6 were increased threefold in patients who recently attempted
suicide compared with healthy controls.7
Some of the effects of inflammation on mood and behavior
may be mediated by kynurenine pathway metabolites, which
modulate neuroinflammation and glutamate neurotransmission.
More than 90% of dietary tryptophan is degraded along the
enzymatic kynurenine pathway, and in the process several
neuroactive compounds are formed, including quinolinic acid
(QUIN) and picolinic acid (PIC)8 (Figure 1). Proinflammatory
cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and also IL-1β and IL-6
activate the kynurenine pathway by inducing several enzymes,
for example, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan
2,3-dioxygenase (TDO).9,10 QUIN is an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
receptor (NMDA-R) agonist that in the central nervous system is
formed to a large extent within microglial cells. QUIN is a potent
excitotoxin
with
proinflammatory
and
immunoregulatory
properties.9 In addition to being a direct NMDA-R agonist, QUIN
increases neuronal glutamate release and decreases glutamate
uptake and recycling by astrocytes.9 Consequently, QUIN has dual
effects on NMDA-R, both acting as an agonist and increasing
extracellular glutamate levels. Ketamine, an NMDA-R antagonist,
has proven effective in counteracting suicidal ideation in several
clinical studies, highlighting the role of glutamate neurotransmis-
sion in suicidal patients.11,12 In mice, inflammation-induced
depressive-like behavior can be reversed by ketamine, providing

 further support for an association between inflammation, NMDA-R
activation and depression.13 It has been proposed that production
of the NMDA-R agonist QUIN is the mechanistic link between
inflammation and symptoms of depression and suicidality.14,15
We have discovered a threefold increase in the levels of QUIN in
the CSF of suicidal patients compared with healthy controls.15
Other groups have also detected increased QUIN staining in post-
mortem brain sections from patients with severe depression who
committed suicide.16 QUIN is produced by the spontaneous
conversion of the precursor metabolite 2-amino-3-carboxymuco-
nate-6-semialdehyde (ACMS; Figure 1). However, ACMS can also
be enzymatically processed by amino-β-carboxymuconate-semi-
aldehyde-decarboxylase (ACMSD) to form PIC.17 In contrast to
QUIN, PIC has been shown to possess neuroprotective properties
in a number of studies, and is known to antagonize the effects of
QUIN.18–20 ACMSD, expressed in liver, kidney and brain, has
previously been predicted to have a key role in neuropsychiatric
disorders because of its crucial position as a gatekeeper in the
metabolism of tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine
pathway.21 Still this enzyme has only recently begun to be
investigated in neuropsychiatric disorders, and its functional
effects have not yet been characterized. In the present study,
we sought to characterize the biological underpinnings of the
increased production of QUIN in patients with suicidal behavior.
We hypothesized that QUIN is increased in both blood and CSF of
suicidal patients due to decreased ACMSD activity, as reflected by
reduced levels of the metabolite PIC and a reduced ratio of PIC/
QUIN. We therefore quantified PIC levels in several cohorts of
suicidal patients and healthy controls, both in direct conjunction
to a suicide attempt and longitudinally for up to 2 years after the
attempt. In addition, we examined the levels of tryptophan/
kynurenine in these subjects as a measure of initial activation of
the kynurenine pathway. We assessed the proinflammatory status
in the blood by monitoring neopterin levels, a peptide synthesized
by IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages.22 Finally, we examined the
effect
of
ACMSD
haplotypes,
using
representative
single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs), on suicidal behavior and
levels of QUIN in CSF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical approval and design of the study
Our study was carried out in accordance with ‘The code of ethics of the
world medical association (Declaration of Helsinki)’ for experiments
including humans. The Regional Ethical Review Boards in Lund, Linköping,
Malmö and Stockholm, approved the study. After complete description of
the study, written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Supplementary Figure 1 shows the different cohorts and the types of
samples used in this study.
CSF cohort
Sixty-four patients (30 men and 34 women) were enrolled following
admission to Lund University Hospital after a suicide attempt (see below
for definition) between 1988 and 2001. Psychiatric diagnoses and
demographics of the subjects are displayed in Table 1. The patients
underwent a washout period when they did not receive any antipsychotic
or antidepressive medication (14.6 ± 9 days, mean ± s.d.). At the end of the
washout period, lumbar punctures and psychiatric evaluations were
carried out as below. Thirty-six healthy controls (29 men and 7 women)
were recruited via the Psychiatric Clinics at the University Hospitals in Lund

 and Linkoping, Sweden, between 2003 and 2009. The controls did not
suffer from any previous or ongoing psychiatric condition or substance
abuse and were somatically healthy. They were thoroughly checked for
psychiatric morbidity using the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM
Disorders (SCID I and II). All controls were free of medication. The levels of
QUIN and cytokines were described before in this cohort.7,15
Plasma cohort
Seventy-three patients (31 men and 42 women) admitted to Lund
University Hospital, Sweden, after a suicide attempt between 2006 and
2010 were enrolled. Only patients with an explicit intent were enrolled (see
below,
‘Definition
of
suicide
attempts’).
The
patients
had
various
psychiatric diagnoses and the majority were treated with pharmacological
drugs. Table 2 shows the demographics of the patients, including
psychiatric and somatic diagnoses. Thirty-five healthy control subjects
(16 men and 19 women) were randomly selected from the municipal
population register in Lund, Sweden between 2008 and 2010. Exclusion
criteria for the controls were the following: previous or ongoing psychiatric
or somatic disorder; prior suicide attempts; prior psychiatric treatment;
including psychotherapy, ongoing somatic illness or treatment (including
painkiller or antibiotics), pregnancy, suicide or non-fatal suicidal self-
directed violence in first-degree relatives, and sporadic recent drug use.
Subjects who did not meet any exclusion criteria at the phone interview
were further assessed for psychiatric and somatic pathology during an
appointment with a research nurse and a resident or specialist in
psychiatry. They were checked for alcohol abuse using the Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)23 with participants scoring 8 or above
being excluded. A somatic examination was performed as described below
for all subjects.
Genotyping cohort
Whole blood for genotyping was available from 227 individuals, including
77 suicide attempters from both the CSF and the plasma cohort. In
addition,
a
cohort
of
150
population-based
healthy
controls
was
genotyped. These were randomly selected by Statistics Sweden (SCB)
and contacted by mail with a request for them to contact study nurse if
interested in participating in the study. Following a preliminary telephone
screening, eligible persons were interviewed by experienced psychiatrists
using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to exclude psychiatric
disorders. AUDIT and the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT)
were used to exclude substance abuse. Apart from psychiatric disorders,
other excluded diagnoses were neurological conditions other than mild
migraines, untreated endocrinological disorders, autoimmune disorders,
pregnancy and a family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in first-
degree relatives. All controls were born in Sweden, as were their parents
(see also Jackobsson et al.24).
Long-term CSF study
All patients were initially enrolled in the study on admission to Lund
University Hospital after a suicide attempt and were subsequently followed
for a maximum of 56 months after the attempt (mean 16 months). Twenty-
nine patients (9 men and 20 women) with a mean age of 40 ± 9 years
(mean ± s.d.) were included between 1987 and 1992. A total of 143 CSF
samples were collected from these individuals at time points when they
were also assessed using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) and the Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS) as described.24 The
levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as QUIN and KYNA in the CSF of
these patients have been previously reported.25
Psychiatric assessment of patients
Briefly, after the suicide attempt, a psychiatrist diagnosed all patients
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM)-IIIR Axis I and II Disorders. The diagnoses were set by the psychiatrist
after an ~ 2-h-long structured interview using the Comprehensive
Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM Disorders (SCID I and II). The CPRS is a widely used rating instrument
in psychiatric research and consists of 65 scaled items, covering a wide
range of psychiatric symptoms.26 We evaluated the severity of depressive
symptoms
using
the
Montgomery-Åsberg
Depression
Rating
Scale
(MADRS), which is a 10-item scale with a maximum score of 60 derived
from CPRS.27 The Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS) is an interview-based
scale, consisting of 20 items assessing signs and symptoms related to
current degree of suicidality and has a maximum score of 80.28 SUAS has
been validated in predicting future suicides.29,30
Definition of suicide attempts
A suicide attempt was defined as ‘situations in which a person has
performed an actually or seemingly life-threatening behavior with the
intent of jeopardizing his/her life’.31 Moreover, to be enrolled, the intent to
commit suicide had to be explicit upon the clinical interview. Patients who
did not state a clear intent were not enrolled. Suicide attempts were
classified into violent and non-violent acts as previously defined.32 Drug-
overdoses, single wrist-cuts or a combination are considered non-violent

 suicide attempts, whereas all other methods (for example, hanging,
drowning and gas poisoning) were classified as violent.
Somatic examination
All patients and controls in the plasma and CSF cohorts underwent a
general physical examination. In order to identify subjects with potential
infections at the time of the lumbar punctures and blood samples, we
analyzed
blood
samples
for
white
blood
cell
count,
erythrocyte
sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, and the subjects were checked
for fever. No evidence of ongoing clinical infection was found, as defined
by the normal reference intervals of these parameters. A complete medical
history was taken. Somatic diagnoses of the subjects are shown in
Tables 1 and 2.
CSF and blood sampling
CSF was obtained from the L4–L5 interspace, using a standardized
protocol. The CSF samples were drawn between 0800 and 1100 hours after
a night of fasting and bed rest. The CSF samples were kept on ice during
the sampling and thereafter immediately aliquoted and frozen at − 80 °C.
Blood samples were collected between 0730 and 0800 hours after a night
of fasting and bed rest. The suicidal patients were psychiatric inpatients,
whereas the control-groups had spent the night at home. The blood was
placed on ice and centrifuged (3000 r.p.m., at +4 °C) within 1 h. Plasma was
collected and stored at − 80°C within 1 h after sampling. All blood and CSF
samples were kept at − 80 °C until analyses. The analysis of PIC, QUIN,
kynurenine and tryptophan levels in blood and CSF as well as genotyping
were performed by staff blinded to the experimental groups, with
samples coded.
Biological assays
Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.
To extract KP metabolites,
samples were treated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration
of 5% (w+v) in equal volume and incubated in ice for 5 min, vortexed
and then centrifuged (4 °C) for 10 min at 12 000 r.p.m. Supernatant was
carefully extracted and filtered with a 0.22 μm syringe filter (Millipore-
Merck, Billerica, MA, USA). QUIN and PIC levels in CSF and plasma were
examined
using
gas
chromatography–mass
spectrometry
with
the
spectrometer operating in electron-capture negative-ionization mode.
The method used is described in Smythe et al.33 The internal standards
were purchased from Le Research (St Paul, MN, USA). Trifluoroacetic
anhydride and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol of GC derivatization
grade, QUIN, PIC and other organic solvents of analytical-grade were all
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). One microliter of sample
was injected into an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph, interfaced to an
Agilent 5973 mass selective detector via an auto-sampler Agilent
Technologies 7683, and controlled using Agilent ChemStation software
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The inter- and intra-assay coefficient of
variation was o5%.
Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography.
Kynurenine and trypto-
phan
were
concurrently
measured
using
Agilent
1290
ultrahigh-
performance liquid chromatography as previously described.34 Briefly,
isocratic elution of kynurenine and tryptophan were achieved using a
reverse-phase Poroshell RRHT C18, 1.8 μm 2.1x150 mm column (Agilent
Technologies) maintained at 38 °C for 12 min run time at a flowrate of
0.75 ml min − 1 using 0.2 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.65) as mobile phase.
Kynurenine was detected using ultraviolet wavelength at 365 nm, whereas
tryptophan was detected using fluorescence intensity set at excitation/
emission wavelength of 280/438 nm. Mixed standards of both metabolites
were used for a six-point calibration curve in order to interpolate the
quantity of the sample readout using Agilent OpenLAB CDS Chemstation
(Edition C.01.04) to analyze the chromatogram. The inter- and intra-assay
coefficients of variation were within the acceptable range of 3–7%.

 Genotyping
Tag SNPs for ACMSD (±20 kB) were chosen using Tagger (HapMap analysis
panel: CEU, r2 threshold = 0.8).35 SNP genotyping (rs4953936, rs1954874,
rs2121337, 6722883, rs6730306, rs10928521, rs6714498 and rs10176573)
were carried out using 5' nuclease assay chemistry with custom KASP
technology probes36 at the Genomics Core Facility at the University
of Gothenburg, Sweden. One SNP (rs6730306) failed at assay design.
No systematic difference in individual missingness percentage was
seen across the two cohorts of patients and controls. All markers had
o10% missing data and none displayed a significant deviation from the
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis, except the longitudinal CSF analysis, was performed
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics
20.0 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)). The longitudinal analysis was performed
using R v 3.2.2 (https://www.r-project.org/). The power calculation was
based on variance and mean levels of inflammatory factors in suicide
attempters versus controls detected in our previous studies. Mean PIC case
concentration was estimated at 175 nM and control concentration at
250 nM. Pooled sample s.d. across the two samples was estimated to
be 150 nM. Power was computed for a two-tailed t-test and 84% power is
achieved with n = 35 per group. In plasma, PIC, QUIN and the kynurenine/
tryptophan
ratios
displayed
a
non-normal
distribution
and
non-
parametrical tests were used for groupwise comparisons and correlations.
For linear regression, the measures were transformed into normal
distribution by logarithm. CSF analytes displayed a normal distribution.
Groupwise comparisons were performed using independent samples
t-test or U-tests. Correlations were performed using Pearson's R or
Spearman's Rho. A linear mixed-effects model with random slopes was
used to determine whether CSF levels changed over the 2 years following
a suicide attempt. The model was originally adjusted for age and gender;
although as no evidence was found that these impacted CSF levels,
they were subsequently omitted in the final model. The delta method was
used to test whether controls differed from the index CSF levels of suicide
attempters, where the mean index CSF was estimated by the linear mixed-
effects model. For the genetic analyses, we used the subsample of patients
and controls with available CSF QUIN, PIC and kynurenine data. We applied
simple linear regression models to study the effect of ACMSD tag SNPs
variants on CSF levels of QUIN, the QUIN/PIC ratio (log transformed), and
kynurenine. Common genetic variants that were significantly associated
with CSF levels of QUIN, after adjustment for multiple comparisons
(Bonferroni correction), were analyzed in cases versus controls using
logistic regression with adjustment for age and sex. All genetic analyses
were performed using an additive model. All reported P-values are two-
sided and analyses were performed using either IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 or
PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/).37
RESULTS
Potential confounders
The levels of PIC in CSF were associated with the age of the
subject (Pearson's R − 0.25, Po0.05), but not with gender, body
mass index or age of samples (Student's t-test and Pearson's R, not
significant (NS)). The PIC data in CSF was therefore corrected
for subject age in all subsequent groupwise comparisons. The
kynurenine/tryptophan ratio in CSF was associated with age
and gender of subjects and was therefore corrected for these
covariates in groupwise comparisons. PIC in plasma was not
associated with any of the mentioned co-variates, whereas the
plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and plasma QUIN were
associated with the age of subjects and therefore corrected for
this in all subsequent groupwise comparisons.

 CSF cohort
We found that the levels of PIC were significantly decreased in the
CSF of suicide attempters (n = 64) compared with healthy controls
(n = 36; t-test, Po0.001, n = 100; Figure 2a). We recently reported
that CSF QUIN is increased in the same patients.15 The PIC/QUIN
ratio was consequently reduced in the suicidal patients, indicative
of impaired activity or reduced biological levels of the enzyme
ACMSD (T-test, Po0.001; Figure 2b).
The CSF kynurenine/tryptophan ratio was increased in suicide
attempters compared with healthy controls (t-test, Po0.01, n = 94;
Figure 2c), indicating an activation of the kynurenine pathway.
No significant differences in CSF PIC levels were found between
the
five
largest
diagnostic
groups
of
the
patients
(major
depressive disorder, depression not otherwise specified, adjust-
ment disorder, personality disorder and substance abuse; one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), NS). The mean CSF PIC concentra-
tions in the main diagnostic groups and controls are shown in
Table 1. There were no correlations between the levels of PIC in
CSF and the severity of psychiatric symptom load as assessed with
total scores of CPRS, SUAS or MADRS (n = 53 for SUAS, 55 for
MADRS and CPRS, Pearson's R, NS).
There was no difference in CSF PIC levels between violent
(n = 16) and non-violent attempts (n = 48), or between patients
who had previously performed attempts (n = 22) versus first-time
suicide attempters (n = 42) (t-tests, NS).
The patients in the CSF cohort had gone through a washout
period of psychotropic medications including anti-depressants
and neuroleptics, although they were allowed to use tranquilizers.
Twenty-six of the patients used benzodiazepines intermittently
either for anxiety or sleeping aid. There was no difference in CSF
PIC levels between patients who did use benzodiazepines versus
patients who did not (n = 38, t-test, NS). A total of nine patients
took other medications (Table 1). The statistical analyses were
repeated without these nine patients, which did not alter the
significant results.
Longitudinal CSF follow-up study
A total of 29 patients contributed to a follow-up study, giving CSF
samples at several random occasions over a 2-year period
following a suicide attempt. Divided into four time periods (up
to 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post suicide-attempt, respectively), the
mean CSF PIC values of the patients were significantly lower than
the value obtained from healthy controls (one-way ANOVA
Po0.0001; all four individual time periods Po0.01, Bonferroni
post hoc correction; Figure 2d).
As a secondary analysis of the same population, a linear mixed-
effects model with random slopes was fit to determine whether
PIC CSF scores changed over time for the patient group, taking all
samples into account, at each individual time point. PIC levels did
not change significantly over time (estimate = 0.56 nM per month,
s.e.m. = 0.34, P = 0.11) (Supplementary Figure 2). The delta method
determined that patient index scores differed from the control
group by an average of 34.82 nM (P = 0.0039, s.e.m. = 12.08). There
was no evidence of a gender difference in either the control group
or the patient group.
Plasma cohort
Similar to the results in the CSF cohort, the levels of PIC were
decreased in plasma of suicide attempters (n = 73) compared with
controls (n = 35; U-test, P = 0.001; Figure 3a). There was no
difference in the levels of plasma QUIN (NS; Figure 3b). The PIC/
QUIN ratio was reduced in the plasma of the suicide attempters
compared with the healthy controls (U-test, Po0.05; Figure 3c).
There were no differences in the degree of IDO/TDO activation in
the peripheral blood between the suicide attempters and the
healthy controls as indicated by an unaltered kynurenine/
tryptophan ratio in plasma (U-test, NS, Figure 3d). However, we
observed that the neopterin levels in plasma were positively
associated with both the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (Spearman’s
Rho = 0.63, Po0.0005) and plasma QUIN (Spearman’s Rho = 0.39,
Po0.01) in the patients (n = 54) but not in the healthy controls
(n = 29).
Table 2 shows the PIC and QUIN levels of the patients and
controls in the plasma cohort, separated by psychiatric and
somatic diagnoses. As for the CSF cohort, there were no significant
differences among the main diagnostic groups of patients (major
depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, substance abuse and
bipolar disorder; depressive episode) (one-way ANOVA, NS).
Similarly, the QUIN levels in plasma did not differ depending on
diagnostic subgroup (one-way ANOVA, NS). There was no
correlation between the levels of PIC in plasma and CPRS, MADRS
or SUAS scores in the patient group (Spearman’s R, NS). The
patients in the plasma cohort were on different psychotrophic
medications, indicated in Table 3. There was no effect of any of
the groups of medications on the PIC levels in plasma except for
propiomazine (linear regression, Table 3). Patients (n = 22) that
received propiomazine, an antihistamine used for improved sleep,
had higher levels of PIC in plasma. Because this effect cannot be a
confounder of the result of significantly reduced PIC in plasma of
patients, we did not correct for this effect. A total of 14 patients
were untreated (that is, received none of the medications listed in
Table 3). There was no significant difference in the plasma levels of
PIC or QUIN between these untreated patients and patients on
psychotrophic medication (n = 58; U-test, NS).
Genetic variation in ACMSD and suicidal behavior
First we studied the effect of ACMSD variants on CSF QUIN levels
in all genotyped patients and controls with available CSF data
(n = 34; 10 controls and 24 patients). Among the seven tag SNPs
only rs2121337 (minor allele frequency = 0.14) remained signifi-
cant post Bonferroni correction (β = 0.4; P = 0.04) (unadjusted P-
value = 0.006). Further, adding age and sex as covariates had little
impact on the association (β = 0.5; P = 0.01). Using the same
sample, the minor C allele of rs2121337 was also associated with
an increased CSF QUIN/PIC ratio (β = 0.4; P = 0.02; Supplementary
Table 1). In line with these findings, the C allele was more
common among the 72 genotyped suicide attempters than in our
control sample of 135 healthy individuals (OR = 2.0; P = 0.03).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence of
reduced levels of PIC in CSF and blood in conjunction to a suicide

the groups of medication on the PIC levels except for propiomazine.
Patients that received propiomazine had higher levels of PIC in the plasma,
therefore we did not correct for this effect in our analysis because it could
not be a confounder of the result of reduced PIC in the plasma of patients.

 attempt in two independent cohorts, as well as over a longitudinal
follow-up period in patients initially enrolled in the CSF cohort.
Moreover, we observed the same biological alterations in suicide
attempters that were medication free (the CSF cohort) and in
attempters that received different psychotropic medications (the
plasma cohort). Our pilot genotyping study indicated that a SNP of
ACMSD, rs2121337, was coupled to increased QUIN in CSF and was
more prevalent in suicide attempters than healthy controls. Hence,
we obtained support for our primary hypothesis, namely that a
reduced
ACMSD
activity
underlies
excess
QUIN
production
observed in patients exhibiting suicidal behavior. The reduced
activity could be due to either a decreased enzymatic function or to
a reduced tissue expression of the enzyme. As QUIN is an NMDA-R
agonist and has additional enhancing effects on glutamate
neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, reduced ACMSD func-
tion could contribute to a vicious circle with increased neuroin-
flammation being established in vulnerable patients. Altogether, our
data indicate that ACMSD is a potential regulator of vulnerability/
resilience to suicidal behavior upon inflammatory challenges.
ACMSD is expressed in liver and kidney as well as in neurons
and astrocytes of the central nervous system.38 The expression
and activity may also be induced in other tissues based on dietary
or metabolic conditions,39–43 although the full tissue range of
expression still remains to be characterized. The biological factors
regulating the expression and activity of ACMSD in neurons and
astrocytes are not yet well established. Genetic variants of ACMSD
have previously been associated with differential expression of the
enzyme in brain tissue in patients with Parkinson’s disease.44 The
purpose of including the tag SNP data in our current study was to
perform a small, hypothesis driven verification of a possible
involvement of a few SNPs in the ACMSD region. Our analyses
differ from a genome-wide association study approach as we only
included ACMSD tag SNPs in our analyses and selected candidate
risk variants based on association with QUIN levels in CSF. Our
sample size using this approach is inevitably limited and our data
have to be interpreted with caution until replicated in larger
studies. Nonetheless, these genetic analyses complement our
patient versus controls analyses of CSF and plasma concentra-
tions, and provide further support for a direct role of ACMSD
function in suicidal behavior.
We studied the levels of PIC in CSF in a follow-up study over 2
years after an initial suicide attempt. Because the patients were
not actively suicidal at the follow-up time points, we were able to
study the CSF levels of PIC without any potential influence of a
physical suicide attempt (for example, by intoxication or direct
injury). We observed that the levels of PIC in CSF were reduced
compared with controls at all time points, which indicates that
decreased ACMSD activity may be a trait-marker of patients prone
to suicidal behavior, rather than a state-marker. One could
propose that an innate reduced biological activity of the ACMSD
enzyme would make patients more susceptible to inflammatory
conditions, as they would produce more QUIN upon inflammatory
stimuli. In fact, we have shown that in patients with elevated QUIN
the depressive and suicidal symptoms fluctuated over time with
varying degree of inflammation in the CSF and blood.25 In
addition, as the increased production of QUIN is by itself
proinflammatory it can lead to increased microglial activation
and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.9 Thus, a reduced
amount or activity of ACMSD within the central nervous system
can predispose to the development of a chronic inflammatory
environment, potentially with the capability of becoming self-
sustained
even
after
cessation
of
proinflammatory
stimuli
originated in the periphery. Conversely, in healthy subjects,
constitutionally high ACMSD activity could be protective, con-
tributing to shunting of kynurenine metabolism toward the
production of the neuroprotective PIC and away from the
neurotoxic QUIN, preventing a vicious circle generating inflamma-
tion and inflammatory metabolites.
We have previously shown that the degree of symptoms in
patients exhibiting suicidal behavior is related to inflammation
and QUIN levels in CSF.7,15,25 Therefore, our results primarily
suggest that ACMSD could be important in the pathogenesis of
suicidality based on its capability to reduce QUIN levels. Indeed, a
study by Walker et al.13 showed that depressive-like behaviors
induced by endotoxin injections (inducing inflammation) in
rodents were reversed by the effects of ketamine on the NMDA
receptor. Ketamine is an NMDA-R antagonist, with the potential of
counteracting effects of the NMDA-R agonist QUIN. However, one
should also consider that PIC itself could influence the pathogen-
esis of psychiatric disease. The neuroprotective mechanisms of
action of PIC are not fully understood, but it is well known that PIC
acts as a metal chelator.17 Bound to chromium, PIC has been
shown to reduce symptoms in patients with atypical depression.45
PIC also exerts growth-factor-like properties, by inducing the
production of macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and -1β as
well as vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent neuroprotec-
tive agent,46,47 and can moreover induce the differentiation of
stem cells.48 Rodent studies have indicated that PIC may protect
against depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors.49–51
Although the findings of reduced PIC and increased QUIN are
most pronounced in the CSF of the suicide attempters, the PIC
levels are also significantly reduced in peripheral blood, opening
up the possibility of assessing PIC, or the ratio of PIC/QUIN in the
blood as a potential risk marker of suicidal behavior. Sublette
et al.52 have previously demonstrated that the kynurenine
pathway is induced in the peripheral blood of suicidal patients,
as evidenced by an increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio,
although they did not attempt to measure QUIN or PIC. In the
current study, we observed increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio
in the CSF of the patients, but not in their peripheral blood;
however, we found that the peripheral ratio was significantly
associated with plasma neopterin levels in suicide attempters.
Neopterin is synthesized and released primarily from human
monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells upon activa-
tion with IFN-γ;22 therefore, elevated neopterin levels are usually
accompanied
by
enhanced
tryptophan
breakdown
because
indoleamine
2,3
dioxygenase
is
upregulated
by
the
same
proinflammatory stimuli.53 This finding demonstrates a proin-
flammatory status in the blood of suicide attempters, so although
our primary indicative is central nervous system inflammation, our
study also points towards involvement of the peripheral immune
system in the suicide attempters. In line with these findings it is
important to note that the decreased activity or expression of
ACMSD is readily detectable in blood by using PIC and QUIN levels
as biomarkers. Therefore, we have identified both a plausible
biological mechanism for the increased QUIN levels detected in
suicide attempters (reduced activity or expression of ACMSD) and
a peripheral biomarker that might indicate suicide risk (the plasma
PIC/QUIN ratio).
Even though this study uses multiple cohorts and analyses both
longitudinal and cross-sectional data as well as genotyping, we do
not test any direct causality of increasing or decreasing the activity
of ACMSD. Such mechanistic studies of causality should be
undertaken in animal models of depressive-like behavior, and
would further strengthen the implication of ACMSD as a potential
target for pharmacological modulation in patients with suicidal
behavior. Moreover, we do not know whether exogenous
inflammation was the initial trigger of the observed changes in
the patients, or whether a decreased enzymatic activity of ACMSD
is sufficient to trigger a proinflammatory environment by itself. As
we did not include any psychiatric control group, it will be
important to define whether the changes in ACMSD biological
activity are specific for suicidal behavior, or whether they also
extend to other underlying psychiatric conditions. Notably, we did
not detect any differences in the levels of PIC in CSF or blood
between any of the diagnostic groups assessed here, which may

 suggest that changes in the kynurenine pathway are specifically
associated with suicidal behavior, not with the primary diagnosis.
A similar observation was made by Steiner et al.,54 who found
post-mortem signs of brain inflammation in patients who died
from suicide, irrespective of their primary diagnosis.
In conclusion, we have found that the neuroinflammation and
excess QUIN previously observed in patients exhibiting suicidal
behavior may be due to deficient activity of ACMSD, an enzyme of
the kynurenine pathway that regulates the formation of the
NMDA-R agonist and neurotoxin QUIN. Modulating ACMSD might
represent a future strategy for the development of novel anti-
suicidal pharmacological tools. Blood measurements of PIC and
QUIN might prove useful as biomarkers in order to identify
patients vulnerable to develop suicidal behavior.
