Abstract
This paper aims to estimate the consequences of an additional 20% tax on sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSBs) on health and health care expenditure. Participants were adult (aged > =
20) Australians alive in 2010, who were modelled over their remaining lifetime. We used lifeta-
ble-based epidemiological modelling to examine the potential impact of a 20% valoric tax on
SSBs on total lifetime disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), incidence, prevalence, and mor-
tality of obesity-related disease, and health care expenditure. Over the lifetime of adult Austra-
lian alive in 2010, seemingly modest estimated changes in average body mass as a result of
the SSB tax translated to gains of 112,000 health-adjusted life years for men (95% uncertainty
interval [UI]: 73,000–155,000) and 56,000 (95% UI: 36,000–76,000) for women, and a reduc-
tion in overall health care expenditure of AUD609 million (95% UI: 368 million– 870 million).
The tax is estimated to reduce the number of new type 2 diabetes cases by approximately
800 per year. Twenty-five years after the introduction of the tax, there would be 4,400 fewer
prevalent cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer persons living with the consequences of
stroke, and an estimated 1606 extra people would be alive as a result of the tax. The tax
would generate an estimated AUD400 million in revenue each year. Governments should
consider increasing the tax on sugared drinks. This would improve population health, reduce
health care costs, as well as bring in direct revenue.
Introduction
Unhealthy diets (11%) and high body mass index (9%) are the risk factors that contribute most
to the burden of disease in Australia [1]. In order to reduce diet-related diseases, overweight,
and obesity, focus should be placed on creating healthy food environments, whereby foods and
beverages that contribute to a healthy diet are more readily available, affordable, and physically
accessible, compared to unhealthy foods [2]. Food taxes have been frequently identified as a
powerful tool to improve population diets [3], with evidence indicating that taxes are an effec-
tive intervention to improve the healthiness of consumption patterns [4]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends that country-level programs to combat obesity should

 include economic tools, such as taxes and subsidies, to improve the affordability of healthy
food products and discourage the consumption of unhealthy options [2]. Several countries
have enacted food taxes to improve population health, most notably Mexico, France, Hungary
and a number of countries in the Western Pacific [5]. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are
the most commonly recommended target for food taxes, primarily due to the strong associa-
tion with poor health and obesity [6], and their lack of nutrition and health benefits. In Austra-
lia, despite recommendations to consider increasing taxes for energy-dense foods (such as
SSBs) [7], no such policies have yet been introduced.
The recently reviewed dietary guidelines clearly articulate the impact of SSBs on overweight
and obesity in children and adults and offer recommendations to reduce consumption. Price
can effectively influence the consumption of SSBs, with a price increase leading to reduced con-
sumption [4]. Correspondingly, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests a tax on SSBs
could reduce consumption and improve population weight and health outcomes, if the tax is
sufficiently high [3]. UK-based research has confirmed the potential for an SSB tax to impact
obesity rates, finding that a 20% tax on SSBs would lead to a reduction in the prevalence of obe-
sity in the UK of 1.3% (approximately 180,000 people), with the greatest effects likely to be
seen in young people, who are the highest consumers of SSBs [8]. Similarly, US-based research
indicates the potential for substantial health gains from taxing SSBs in the US [9].
The limited available evidence on the economic impact of food taxes has been cited by pol-
icy makers as a major barrier to policy progress in the area of regulatory interventions such as
taxes on unhealthy foods [10]. Accordingly, local data outlining the potential impact of taxing
SSBs is particularly useful to policy-makers, with regards to government return on investment
in relation to health sector costs.
The potential for food taxes to improve health outcomes in Australia has previously been
examined. For example, Sharma et al recently examined the potential impact of a SSB tax in
Australia, using household panel data [11]. They estimated that a 20% valoric tax (resulting in
a percentage increase in price, as opposed to an excise tax that varies with the content of the
product) could reduce total energy consumption by about 10,000 kJ per person per year, and
body weight by 0.93 kg, at an average cost per household of $17. The effects were more pro-
nounced among low income groups. However, previous studies are not based on the most
recent dietary intake data for Australia and do not provide an indication of the magnitude,
impact, and timing of health benefits resulting from the tax.
This paper aims to estimate the consequences of an additional 20% tax on SSBs in Australia
on health and health care expenditure, using the latest dietary intake date for the Australian
population.
Methods
Specification of the tax
We examined the potential impact of a 20% valoric tax on SSBs, simulating the impact if the SSB
tax was in place from 2010 onward. An SSB was defined as a non-alcoholic drink with added sugar,
including carbonated soft drinks and flavoured mineral waters. Fruit juices and drinks, energy
drinks, milk-based drinks, and cordials were excluded. The tax was assumed to apply in addition to
the existing Goods and Services Tax (GST), with the effect that the consumer price of SSBs would
increase by 20%. This assumed that the tax would be fully passed on to the consumer.
Effects of tax on body weight
Current dietary intake data was based on the Australian Health Survey (AHS) 2011–2013 [12].
In our base case analysis, we assumed that producers pass on the price increase in full to the

 consumers. A recent review of empirical evidence suggests that SSB taxes are passed on in full
when they are applied to entire countries (but not necessarily when applied to smaller areas)
[13]. In Mexico, there is evidence of overshifting in response to the SSB tax [14]. Australia-spe-
cific price elasticities were used to estimate how changes in price resulting from the tax would
lead to changes in food purchases in the Australian adult population, based on the recent anal-
ysis by Sharma et al. [11]. Price elasticity indicates how price influences demand. An ‘own-
price’ elasticity of -1 indicates that for every percent increase in price, demand drops by 1%,
and a ‘cross-price elasticity’ indicates the change in demand for a product (e.g. milk) as a result
of a price change of another product (e.g. SSBs). The own-price elasticity estimate for soft
drinks (-0.63; p<0.01) was lower than global estimates (mean: -1.30; 95% CI: -1.09 to -1.51)
from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and
France [15]. This lower value may reflect differences in food purchasing habits and culture in
Australia, resulting in a more conservative estimate of the reduction in soft drink consumption
in response to the tax. The only cross-price elasticity used, based on the statistically significant
results in the Sharma et al study, related to artificially-sweetened soft drinks (0.16). Estimated
changes in mean daily energy intake for each age and sex group were determined based on the
estimated changes in purchases and the average energy density of relevant products [16].
Changes in quantity purchased were assumed to lead to changes in what was actually con-
sumed, with no compensatory changes in physical activity levels. Resultant changes in body
weight for each age and sex group were calculated using the ‘rule-of-thumb’ published by Hall
et al (Lancet 2011) whereby every change in energy intake of 100 kJ per day results in an even-
tual body weight change of approximately 1kg [17]. This was converted to an estimated change
in BMI for each age and sex group, based on mean heights and weights derived from the Aus-
tralian Health Survey 2011/12 [12].
Effects of body mass on health outcomes and health care costs
In order to estimate the effects of changes in BMI on health outcomes and health care costs we
used a proportional multi-state life table model [18]. For each age-sex group, the consequences
of weight change on the incidence of obesity-related diseases were calculated using potential
impact fraction calculations and continuous risk functions (S1 Table, S2 Table).
The consequences on health and health care expenditure were modelled for all adult (aged
> = 20) Australians alive in 2010, with life time follow up. BMI was modelled as lognormally
distributed. Interventions shift the mean of those distributions. As in our earlier work in the
ACE Prevention project, a trend towards higher mean BMI over time was assumed to last until
2023, after which BMI was assumed stable [19]. The model compares a scenario in which a tax
on SSB is applied, with a business-as-usual scenario.
Nine obesity related diseases were modelled: stroke, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive
heart disease, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, post-menopausal breast cancer, colon cancer,
endometrial cancer, and kidney cancer. Changes in disease incidence resulted in changes in
prevalence at higher ages and later in time, and ultimately disease-specific mortality followed.
Changes in disease-related quality of life at every age were calculated using disease-specific dis-
ability weights [19]. Disease-specific changes fed into a life table to calculate the number of
health-adjusted life years lived (DALYs). To show the impact at the level of individuals, we also
estimated the average lifetime impact for a hypothetical cohort of 20 to 24 year old Australians.
Costs
To estimate the costs of legislative intervention we used WHO estimates for legislative change
[20] and assumed 30 years of monitoring (Level 4 admin officer, annuitized with 3%

 discounting), as we did in previous work [18]. Health care costs by disease were those prepared
for the ACE Prevention project [21]. The 2003 figures were inflated to 2010 values using
national health price inflation estimates [22]. Health care costs for non-obesity related diseases
were included in the model, so ‘unrelated’ health care costs in added years of life are accounted
for [23].
Implementation and sensitivity analysis
Calculations were performed in MS Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington,
USA) (S1 Model). Uncertainty was assessed by Monte Carlo simulation using the Ersatz pro-
gram (Epigear.com, Brisbane, Australia; 2000 iterations), incorporating uncertainty in inter-
vention effect on mean BMI, relative risks of incident disease and intervention costs (S1 Table,
S2 Table). In this paper we report undiscounted results. We performed a one-way sensitivity
analysis to explore the impact of the expected BMI trend, the duration of the effect on body
mass, the pass-on rate, and discounting of future health gains and costs. Ethics approval was
not required.
Results
Health outcomes
The 20% increase in price would result in an average change in consumption of SSBs from 141
g/day to 124 g/day across the Australian adult male population and from 76 to 67 g/day for
women, representing a 12.6% decrease. Average energy intake would go down by 16 kJ/day for
men and 9 kJ/day for women, and average body mass index of men by 0.10 kg/m2 (0.09–0.11),
which is about 320g for 1.78m males. Women would lose 0.06 kg/m2 (0.06–0.07), or about
170g, assuming a height of 1.63m. The reductions in BMI would be larger for younger age
groups (who consume higher volumes of SSBs) than older age groups. The tax could result in a
decline in the prevalence of obesity of about 2.7% (0.7 percentage point) among men, and 1.2%
(0.3 percentage point) among women, compared to business as usual.
Over the lifetime of Australian adults alive in 2010, these seemingly modest changes in body
mass translated to gains of 112,000 health-adjusted life years for men (95% uncertainty interval
[UI]: 73,000–155,000) and 56,000 (95% UI: 36,000–76,000) for women. Fig 1 shows that the
annual gains rise almost linearly over the first 25 years after the start of the tax. The estimated
benefit for 20–24 year old males is the equivalent of about 7.6 days in full health, of which 4.9
in life extension and 2.7 in improved quality of life. For their female peers the model predicts
3.7 health-adjusted days gained, of which 2.2 from increased longevity.
Figs 2–4 show the results for the modelled diseases over the first 25 years after the introduc-
tion of the tax. (S3 Table of the Supporting Information presents more detail, including uncer-
tainty intervals.) Most notably, the 20% tax would reduce the number of type 2 diabetes cases,
with incidence down by approximately 800 per year. This is roughly a 0.6% reduction com-
pared to the number expected without the tax (approximately 130,000 per year). The annual
number of new cases of heart disease and stroke would be reduced by 240 and 70, respectively.
After 25 years there would be 16,000 less prevalent cases of diabetes, 4,400 fewer cases of
IHD and 1,100 of stroke. In total, an estimated 1600 fewer deaths will occur by year 25, with
heart disease accounting for the largest share of this postponed mortality.
Costs
The cost to government of implementing the tax was estimated at AUD27.6 million. The over-
all health care expenditure over the lifetime of the 2010 population aged > = 20 would be

 reduced by AUD609 million (95% UI: 368 million– 870 million). Fig 5 shows that the annual
health care cost savings rise over the first 20 years and then stabilise at around AUD29 million
per year.
Revenue generated by the tax
In addition to the health care cost savings, the intervention would also raise substantial revenue
for the government. Based on national household expenditure data in 2009/2010 [24],

 expenditure on soft drinks amounted to AUD5.32 per household per week, indicating that a
20% tax on these products would raise taxation revenue in excess of AUD400 million each year
(taking into account changes in consumption in response to the tax). This revenue could be
put towards health promotion activities, or used to subsidise healthy foods.
Sensitivity analysis
Table 1 shows that if body mass across the ages were to remain as in 2010 rather than continue
to increase until 2023, the lifetime health benefits would be 10% lower than projected in our

 base case scenario. Limiting the effect of the tax on body mass to the first 10 years reduces the
health impact by 75%. The degree to which producers pass on the tax linearly relates to the size
of the health benefits. Discounting future lifetime health gains by 3% has a relatively large
impact, since the gains materialise over the course of several decades. The results for health
care costs are in the same direction, but proportionally more modest in size. This is because
health care costs are reduced in the near future, as costly cases of disease are prevented. After
several decades, however, this is outweighed by more people remaining alive who would have
died without the tax, and who accrue health care costs due to unrelated illness. In all scenarios,
the policy was likely to be cost-saving from a health sector perspective.
Discussion
Our analysis suggests that a 20% additional tax on SSBs would result in modest reductions in
BMI and the proportion of Australians that are obese. This would nevertheless translate into
health gains adding up to around 170,000 healthy life years over the lifetime of the 2010 Aus-
tralian adult population. The costs of legislation and monitoring of the tax would be paid back
around 14 times over in the form of reduced health care expenditure.
The weight loss we estimated is slightly less than that predicted by Sharma et al for a 20%
valoric tax, which could be due to our more restricted definition of SSBs and/or the nature of
the Australian Health survey data we used, where recall bias may have led to underestimation
of the consumption of unhealthy foods [11]. The results in this study are also in line with our
earlier findings that a broader ‘junk food’ tax (that included SSBs) could reduce mean weight

 by around 1.6 kg and avert 559,000 DALYs for the Australian adult population [18]. For com-
parison, individual diet and exercise interventions were estimated to avert up to 14,000 DALYs
[19], and offering one year of orlistat (a weight-loss drug) treatment to all obese Australians
was estimated to avert up to 8,800 DALYs [25].
Both empirical and modelled studies in various countries have shown that food taxes can
improve diet, but few report to the level of health and economic outcomes [4]. The current
study is the first Australian study to report results of the likely impact of a tax on SSBs by dis-
ease outcome and health care expenditure, including the timing that benefits are likely to
accrue.
A strength of our analysis is that it presents outcomes at various levels, from changes in
average BMI via a broad range of diseases, to healthy life years gained and health care expendi-
ture changes over time. This is particularly important information for policy makers, for whom
the timeframe for return on investment is likely to be an important consideration [10].
Another strength of the paper is that it uses Australian price elasticity estimates. However,
unlike in the other literature [15] where consumption of milk, fruit juice, and artificially sweet-
ened drinks were shown to be affected by changes in the price of SSBs, the only cross-price elas-
ticity that was statistically significant for Australia related to artificially sweetened drinks [11].
If other food consumption compensation occurs in response to the tax, this would alter the
results.
In this paper we did not consider the impact of a SSB tax on different socio-economic
groups. Nevertheless, we note that Australians of low SES are disproportionately affected by
high rates of diet-related illnesses [26] and are therefore likely to experience greater dietary
improvements as a result of a tax on SSBs [27]. Inequitable aspects are likely to be further ame-
liorated if revenue was used to support healthy eating initiatives and subsidies on healthy foods
for low-SES households. Detailed analysis of differential impacts by SES groups should be the
focus of future research.
This paper investigated the impact of a valoric tax on SSBs. We note that there are a number
of mechanisms that could be used to apply a tax on SSBs in the Australian context. Sharma
et al has indicated that a volumetric tax (a tax on the quantity of sugar, which would most likely
take the form of an excise tax in the Australian context) may have a greater impact on weight
change and prove more efficient than a valoric tax. Our results are thus likely to be a conserva-
tive estimate of the health impact of a tax on SSBs in Australia.
Conclusions
A multi-sectoral policy response is needed to address unhealthy diets and obesity in Australia
and internationally. A tax on SSBs has the potential to reduce the burden of disease attributable
to consumption of sugary drinks and the associated health care costs in the short term. It
would also raise funds that can be used for a comprehensive strategy to improve diet and popu-
lation health. While a tax on SSBs is not currently on the political agenda in Australia, drawing
on this evidence and international experience, a tax on SSBs should be considered as part of
Australia’s tax reform agenda.
