ABSTRACT
Objectives: Self-harm is a major health problem in
many countries, with potential adverse outcomes
including suicide and other causes of premature death.
It is important to monitor national trends in this
behaviour. We examined trends in non-fatal self-harm
and its management in England during the 13-year
period, 2000–2012.
Design and setting: This observational study was
undertaken in the three centres of the Multicentre
Study of Self-harm in England. Information on all
episodes of self-harm by individuals aged 15 years
and over presenting to five general hospitals in three
cities (Oxford, Manchester and Derby) was collected
through face-to-face assessment or scrutiny of
emergency department electronic databases. We
used negative binomial regression models to assess
trends in rates of self-harm and logistic regression
models for binary outcomes (eg, assessed vs non-
assessed patients).
Participants: During 2000–2012, there were
84 378 self-harm episodes (58.6% by females),
involving 47 048 persons.
Results: Rates of self-harm declined in females
(incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.98; 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99,
p<0.0001). In males, rates of self-harm declined until
2008 (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98, p<0.0001) and
then increased (IRR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, p=0.002).
Rates of self-harm were strongly correlated with suicide
rates in England in males (r=0.82, p=0.0006) and females
(r=0.74, p=0.004). Over 75% of self-harm episodes were
due to self-poisoning, mainly with analgesics (45.7%),
antidepressants (24.7%) and benzodiazepines (13.8%). A
substantial increase in self-injury occurred in the latter
part of the study period. This was especially marked for
self-cutting/stabbing and hanging/asphyxiation.
Psychosocial assessment by specialist mental health staff
occurred in 53.2% of episodes.
Conclusions: Trends in rates of self-harm and suicide
may be closely related; therefore, self-harm can be a
useful mental health indicator. Despite national guidance,
many patients still do not receive psychosocial
assessment, especially those who self-injure.
INTRODUCTION
Self-harm (intentional self-poisoning or self-
injury, irrespective of type of motivation1) is
a public health problem in many countries.
It is a major risk factor
for completed
suicide2 and is associated with elevated all-
cause mortality.3 Approximately 50% of indi-
viduals who die by suicide have a history of
self-harm,4 and in many cases, there is an
episode of self-harm shortly before a fatal
act,5 particularly in frequent hospital atten-
ders.6 Self-harm is also often associated with
poorer
psychosocial
outcomes,
such
as
depression, anxiety, substance use and educa-
tional indices,7 and results in considerable
health services and social costs.8
Reliable and accurate data on self-harm
are important for understanding national
trends and risk factors for self-harm, plan-
ning appropriate health services and inform-
ing potentially effective preventive measures.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is a large study of more than 84 000 pre-
sentations to emergency departments following
self-harm.
▪ This multicentre study includes five general hos-
pitals in three cities of socioeconomically diverse
populations in England, which provides more rep-
resentative information than single-centre studies.
▪ The study only included individuals who pre-
sented to hospital following self-harm.
▪ The rates of self-harm reported in this study are
based on urban populations; these have been
shown to have higher rates of self-harm than
rural populations.
▪ Some of the data reported were based on infor-
mation available only for those assessed (ie,
approximately 53% of all episodes of self-harm),
which may limit generalisability.

 Systematic monitoring of self-harm in many countries,
including England, has tended to be confined to single
centres. However, these are limited in terms of generalis-
ability of findings.
In the present study, we examined trends in non-fatal
self-harm in England using data from the Multicentre
Study of Self-harm in England http://cebmh.warne.ox.
ac.uk/csr/mcm/, which was developed as part of the
National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England.9 10 We
previously reported on trend of self-harm during 2000–
2007,11 which showed declining rates of self-harm after
2003, in keeping with the national trends in suicide.
Here, we present data on trends during the 13-year
period, 2000–2012, including rates, methods of self-
harm, psychiatric history, repetition of self-harm and
provision of psychosocial assessment following self-harm.
METHODS
Sample
This observational study was undertaken in the three
centres
of
the
Multicentre
Study
of
Self-harm
in
England, as described in detail elsewhere.12 We included
all individuals aged 15 years and over who presented to
five general hospital emergency departments (EDs) fol-
lowing self-harm - Oxford (one hospital), Manchester
(three hospitals) and Derby (two hospitals merged into
one in mid-2009) - between 1 January and 31 December
2012.
Socioeconomic characteristics of the centres
The
three
study
centres
include
socioeconomically
diverse populations. On the basis of the Index of
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007 in England,13 which
ranks
areas
according
to
seven
domains
(income,
employment, health deprivation and disability, educa-
tion, skills and training, barriers to housing and services,
crime, and living environment) to derive an overall
deprivation score, Manchester was ranked the fourth
most deprived local authority in England, compared
with Derby, which was ranked 69th and Oxford 155th.14
Data collection
Information on all episodes of self-harm was collected in
two ways: (1) completion of assessments (of mental state,
risks and needs) by the general hospital psychiatric
service (and in Manchester also by ED staff)15 and (2)
scrutiny of ED electronic databases by research clerks to
identify all other patients presenting to the hospital fol-
lowing self-harm, from which more limited data are
extracted. Demographic, clinical and hospital manage-
ment data on each episode were collected by clinicians
using pen and paper (Oxford and Manchester), or elec-
tronic (Derby and Manchester since mid-2008) forms.
Regular induction training of clinical staff helps main-
tain the quality of data collection.
Data included gender, age, date of self-harm, method
of self-harm (including drugs used in self-poisoning and
details of self-injury), psychiatric history (including self-
harm), whether or not psychosocial assessment was con-
ducted and subsequent repetition of self-harm.
Information on non-assessed patients (those who had
taken early discharge, refused or were not offered an
assessment)
was
collected
in
Manchester
from
September 2002 onwards. Rates of self-harm for this
centre for the earlier period were adjusted upwards by a
factor of 1.42, taking account of the 30% of non-assessed
individuals identified in a review of the data collected
between 1 September 2002 and 31 August 2003. Rates of
assessment were similar by age and gender and the
adjustment was applied across all age and gender
groups.
Rates of self-harm and suicide
Rates of self-harm were calculated for defined local
population areas for which centres had near-complete
identification
of
self-harm
presentations to
hospital
(Oxford City, City of Manchester and Derby Unitary
Area). We calculated annual person-based rates using
each individual’s first episode of self-harm within each
year. Midyear population estimates for the city catch-
ment areas were obtained from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS).16 Rates were calculated per 100 000 of
the local general population for each centre, for each
year, age standardised to the European population, with
95% CIs.
Rates of suicide in England (age standardised to the
European population) were obtained from the ONS.
Suicides were ‘deaths given an underlying cause of
intentional self-harm or injury/poisoning of undeter-
mined intent’.17
Ethical approval
The monitoring systems in Oxford and Derby have
approval from local Research Ethics Committees to
collect data on self-harm for local and multicentre pro-
jects. Self-harm monitoring in Manchester is part of a
clinical audit system and has been ratified as such by the
local Research Ethics Committee. All three monitoring
systems are fully compliant with the Data Protection Act
of 1998. All centres have approval under Section 251 of
the National Health Services (NHS) Act 2006 (formerly
Section 60, Health and Social Care Act 2001) to collect
patient-identifiable information without patient consent.
Statistical analyses
Rates of self-harm and trends in rates were calculated
separately for each centre. Trends in method of self-
harm and repetition were analysed using data from 2003
to 2012 from the three centres, because these variables
are to a certain extent related to assessment status—for
example, fewer patients who present with self-injury
receive an assessment.15
We used negative binomial regression models to assess
trends in rates of self-harm accounting for overdisper-
sion in the data and logistic regression models for

 binary
outcomes
(eg,

vs
non-assessed).
Likelihood ratio (LR) tests were used to test for devi-
ation from linearity in trends over time.
The correlation between rates of self-harm and suicide
rates in England was examined using Spearman’s rank
correlation test. Analyses were carried out using SPSS
V.22.0 and Stata V.14.0.
Missing data
Level of missing data varied. Some variables (eg, socio-
demographic variables and method of self-harm) which
could be determined from ED records, psychosocial or
ED assessment were available for all or most individuals.
Other variables (eg, history of psychiatric treatment)
could only be determined for episodes in which indivi-
duals received psychosocial assessment by mental health
staff (or in some cases in Manchester by ED staff). A
description of the analytic sample in terms of the vari-
ables examined is presented below.
Rated of self-harm
During 2000–2012, there were 84 378 presentations due
to self-harm involving 47 048 individuals aged 15 years
and over to the study hospitals in the three participating
centres. We excluded the data of 25 individuals whose
sex was unknown, resulting in 84 535 episodes by 47 023
persons. To calculate annual person-based rates, we used
each individual’s first episode of self-harm within each
year (ie, 63 011 episodes by 47 023 individuals). We
included only those individuals residing in the local
catchment area so that this analysis is based on 37 315
episodes by 26 918 individuals aged 15 years and over.
Method of self-harm and psychosocial assessment
Of
the
84 353
episodes
by
47 023
individuals,
we
included those occurring during 2003–2012, that is,
67 653 episode by 35 507 individuals.
Psychiatric treatment
Of the 67 635 episodes by 35 507 individuals presenting
to the hospitals during 2003–2012, information on past
or present psychiatric treatment was available for 42 711
episodes by 23 711 persons as they had undergone psy-
chosocial or ED (Manchester only) assessment.
Repetition
Repetition
was
examined
for
patients
presenting
between 2003 and 2011. It was based on repeat presenta-
tions by individuals within 12 months of their first self-
harm episode in any year during this period. Overall,
44 662 episodes by 31 878 persons were included in this
analysis.
The role of the funding source
The Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England receives
financial support from the Department of Health. The
Department of Health had no role in the study design,
collection,
analysis
and
interpretation
of
data,
the
writing of the manuscript and the decision to submit the
paper for publication. The views and opinions expressed
do not necessarily reflect those of the Department of
Health.
RESULTS
During 2000–2012, there were 84 378 episodes of self-
harm by people aged 15 years and over (41.4% by
males, 58.6% by females and 25 episodes where sex was
not known) presenting to the EDs in the participating
centres, involving 47 048 individuals (43.1% males and
56.8% females; table 1). Overall, 38.4% of individuals
were aged under 25 years and nearly two-thirds (62.1%)
were under 35 years (mean age 32.1 (SD 14.0, range 15–
97 years)).
Rates by gender
The overall age-standardised rates of self-harm were 362
(343–381) in males and 441 (420–462) in females per
100 000 population. In males, the rate appeared to
decline between 2000 and 2008 and steadily increase
thereafter
(figure
1A).
Among
females,
the
rate
appeared to decline until 2009 and level off up until
2012 (figure 1B).
The results of the negative binomial regression models
showed a decline in rates of self-harm over the study
period (2000–2012) among females (incidence rate
ratio (IRR) 0.98; 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, p<0.0001). Rates
also appeared to decline among males (IRR 0.99; 95%
CI 0.97 to 1.00, p=0.021), but the trend was not linear
(p for LR test for deviation from linearity (DFL)=0.007).
After inspecting figure 1 and based on our a priori
assumption that the economic downturn might increase
rates of self-harm, we examined trends in rates by period
(2000–2007 vs 2008–2012) by fitting separate regression
models for each time period.
The results showed a decline in rates until 2008 (IRR
0.96; 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98, p<0.0001), followed by an
increase thereafter (IRR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09,
p=0.002).

 Rates of self-harm from this study were strongly corre-
lated with suicide rates in England in males (r=0.82,
p=0.0006) and females (r=0.74, p=0.004) (figure 1A, B).
Rates of self-harm by centre
Rates of self-harm were similar in Manchester and Derby
(males: 360 (95% CI 353 to 367), females: 502 (493–
511); males: 357 (95% CI 346 to 368), females: 507 (494
to 520), respectively) and markedly lower in Oxford
(males: 293 (95% CI 281 to 305), females: 397 (384–
410)). There also appeared to be differences in trends in
rates of self-harm between the centres (see figure 2A, B).
In males, there was a decline in rates of self-harm
between 2000 and 2012 in Oxford (IRR 0.97; 95% CI
0.96 to 0.99, p<0.0001) and Derby (IRR 0.98; 95% CI
0.97 to 1.00, p=0.009), but the trends were not linear
(p for LR test for DFL: Oxford=0.007, Derby=0.009),
while in Manchester, there was no statistical evidence of
a trend over the study period (IRR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to
1.01, p=0.21; figure 2A). However, in Manchester, the
pattern was similar to the overall trend (see above) with
a decrease in rates until 2008 and increasing rates there-
after. In females, there was no evidence of a trend in
rate of self-harm during 2000–2012 in Oxford (IRR 0.99;
95% CI 0.97 to 1.00, p=0.05) or Derby (IRR 1.00; 95%
CI 0.99 to 1.01, p=0.38), but in Manchester, rates of self-
harm fell during 2000–2012 (IRR 0.97; 95% CI 0.97 to
0.98, p<0.0001).
Rates of self-harm by age group
Trends in rates of self-harm showed some differences
according to gender and age group (figure 3A, B).
There was no evidence of a trend in rates of self-harm in
males 15–24 or 35–54 years (IRR 0.99; 95% CI 0.99 to
1.00, p=0.08; IRR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, p=0.28,
respectively), but among those aged 25–34 years, rates of
self-harm declined during 2000–2012 (IRR 0.96; 95% CI

linear
(p=0.0003
for
LR

Rates
of
self-harm
increased steadily and linearly in males aged 55+ (IRR
1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04, p=0.003), an annual average
increase of 2% over the study period.
Rates of self-harm fell in females younger than 55 years
(15–24 years: IRR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, p<0.0001;
25–34 years: IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.97, p<0.0001; 35–
54 years: IRR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00, p=0.004),
although the trend was linear only in females aged 25–
34 years (p=0.76 for LR test for DFL). There was a clear
increase in rates of self-harm in older females (55+ years)
(IRR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04, p=0.003, p for LR
test=0.81), on average a 2% annual increase.
Methods of self-harm
Using data from 2003–2012 from the three centres
(67 653 episodes), 50 484 (74.6%) were due to self-
poisoning alone, 14 213 (21.0%) involved self-injury
alone and the remainder 2956 (4.4%) involved both self-
poisoning and self-injury. The number of episodes
involving self-injury alone steadily increased from 2007
(OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.10, p<0.0001; figure 4).
Of the self-poisoning episodes (n=53 440), 45.6%
involved paracetamol or salicylate analgesics (both in
their pure or compound form), 24.7% involved antide-
pressants (tricyclic, selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors
(SSRIs),
serotonin–norepinephrine
reuptake
inhibitors
(SNRIs),
other
antidepressants),
13.8%
involved benzodiazepines and 6.9% involved major tran-
quilisers or antipsychotic medication.
The vast majority of self-injury episodes involved self-
cutting/stabbing
(76.7%).
The
remainder
included
asphyxiation/hanging (6.0%), jumping from heights
(2.8%), traffic related (1.9%), carbon monoxide (1.0%),
drowning and gunshot (0.9%) and a variety of other
methods (9.3%). In terms of specific methods of self-
injury, there was little change in the number of presenta-
tions to hospital following self-cutting/stabbing until
2007 (OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03, p=0.60), but from
2007, there was an increase in presentations involving
self-cutting/stabbing (OR=1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.07,
p<0.0001; figure 5A). There was also a marked increase
in the number of episodes of hanging/asphyxiation
from 2005 (OR=1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04, p<0.0001)
and an increase in jumping from heights from 2003
(OR=1.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.17, p<0.0001; figure 5B).
The patterns seen were similar in males and females
(results not shown).
Psychosocial assessment
Between 2003 and 2012, psychosocial assessment by spe-
cialist mental health staff was carried out in 35 960
(53.2%) of 67 653 episodes of self-harm, although there
was considerable variation between the three centres
(41.0–69.3%). The proportion of episodes assessed fluc-
tuated, with no evidence of a linear trend over the study
period (p<0.0001 for LR test for DFL). Overall, the pro-
portion of individuals receiving psychosocial assessment
was greater in 2012 relative to 2003 (OR=1.35, 95% CI
1.26 to 1.44, p<0.0001), although there was variation
between
the
centres.

 receiving psychosocial assessment differed between the
methods of self-harm (self-injury alone: 38.2%; self-
poisoning alone: 56.6%; self-poisoning and self-injury:
65.6%). Individuals presenting with self-injury alone
were less likely to be assessed relative to patients present-
ing with self-poisoning alone (OR=0.47, 95% CI 0.46 to
0.49, p<0.0001) and those presenting after self-poisoning
and
self-injury
(OR=0.32,
95%
CI
0.30
to
0.35,
p<0.0001). Psychosocial assessment was carried out in
34.4% of the episodes of self-cutting alone.
Psychiatric history
Information was available on 39 279 episodes of self-
harm, in 31.3% of which the individuals were in contact
with mental health services at the time of presentation
(30.4% and 0.9% were receiving outpatient and inpatient
treatment, respectively). The proportion of patients
receiving psychiatric treatment at the time of presenta-
tion to hospital generally increased between 2003 and
2012, although there was no evidence for a linear trend
(p<0.0001 for LR test for DFL). The proportion of epi-
sodes in which the individuals reported having had pre-
vious treatment from mental health services was 62.3%
(overall n=38 490 episodes). Information on current psy-
chiatric treatment was missing in 3434 (8.0%) episodes
and that about past psychiatric treatment in 4221 (9.9%)
episodes.
Repetition of self-harm
Repetition was defined as a re-presentation to the same
centre after self-harm. The proportion of individuals
who repeated an episode of self-harm within 1 year was
21.0% (9397/44 662) during 2003–2011. The propor-
tion repeating remained relatively stable during the
study period (OR=1.00, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01, p=0.2).
DISCUSSION
We examined trends in non-fatal self-harm in England
during 2000–2012 using data from the Multicentre Study
of Self-harm in England. We examined rates, methods of
self-harm, psychiatric history, repetition of self-harm and
provision of psychosocial assessment following self-harm.
Because of the rigour of methods used in the this study
to collect information on self-harm, it provides the most
accurate available picture of self-harm in England.
Rates of self-harm
Trends in rates of self-harm were consistent with trends
in rates of suicide in England for the equivalent
period.17 This reinforces our earlier conclusion that
rates of self-harm as found in this multicentre study
reflect those for suicide nationally.11 Since suicide is
often preceded by self-harm,2 it might be argued that
the association is in the other direction, that is, suicide
rates reflect self-harm rates. Certainly, accurate data on
rates of self-harm may represent an important and sensi-
tive mental health indicator.18
There were differences in rates of self-harm between
the centres, which were in keeping with differences in
socioeconomic
characteristics
of
the
catchment
areas.11 12 Thus, the average rates of self-harm between
2000 and 2012 were considerably higher in Manchester
and Derby than in Oxford. The City of Manchester is
ranked lowest of all three in terms of the IMD, followed
by Derby Unitary Area and Oxford City.
Rates of self-harm generally declined during the
initial part of the study period but increased in males
after 2008. This pattern is likely to be related to the
recent economic recession,19 as has been found for
suicide in England.20 21 and for suicide and self-harm
in Ireland.22 The problems people face in relation to
economic downturn (eg, work, unemployment and
housing)19 present particular challenges for clinical ser-
vices and prevention efforts.23 Policies for helping such
individuals include, for example, investing more in
active labour market programmes such as job search
assistance and subsidised employment, training front-
line staff likely to be in contact with those at risk for
mental health problems due to economic and employ-
ment difficulties such as staff in advice agencies and
job centres and provision of adequate welfare benefits
when needed.24
Trends in rates of self-harm showed some differences
according to gender and age group. There was no clear
trend in rates of self-harm in males aged 15–24 or

 35–54 years, but there was a decline in those aged 25–
34 years. However, rates of self-harm in females aged
under 55 years generally declined during 2000–2012.
For males and females, there was a steady rise in rates of
self-harm in those aged 55 years and older, although the
magnitude of the increase was relatively small.
Methods of self-harm
The vast majority of self-harm episodes were due to self-
poisoning, mainly by ingestion of analgesics and antide-
pressants. Self-poisoning presents particular challenges
in terms of medical management and prevention of
suicide death, including optimising medical care to min-
imise the risk of death after hospital addmission.25 The
number of self-injury episodes increased over the studied
period. Of the episodes involving self-injury, the majority
were due to self-cutting/stabbing. In terms of gender,
there were similar changes in specific methods over time.
The number of episodes involving this method increased
markedly. We do not know if this is due to a general
increase in use of this method, or because a greater pro-
portion of people who intentionally cut themselves have
presented to hospitals. However, it should be noted that
there is a stronger risk of suicide following self-cutting
compared to self-poisoning. We previously found a
1.8-fold increased risk of suicide following self-cutting/
stabbing relative to self-harm by self-poisoning.26 Also,
repetition of self-harm is more common in individuals
who cut themselves.27 The increase in self-cutting is also
concerning given our earlier finding that the proportion
of patients who receive psychosocial assessment is espe-
cially low for individuals who self-cut.28 The increase in
other methods of self-injury, especially hanging/asphyxi-
ation, is also worrying. In our earlier study, we found a
2.65-fold increased risk of suicide following hanging/
asphyxiation relative to self-poisoning.26 Indeed, suicide
by hanging has been increasing in the UK, as suggested
by a recent ONS report.29
Psychosocial assessment
Despite the recommendation made by the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in
2004 that everyone who presents to hospital following
self-harm should have a comprehensive psychosocial
assessment,30 an assessment only occurred in just over
half of episodes. In a survey of 32 hospitals across
England, a psychosocial assessment by a mental health
professional occurred in 58% of self-harm episodes
(range 24–88%),31 with no evidence of an increase in
this proportion from a similar study in 2001–2002.32
Hospital attendance following self-harm represents an
opportunity to intervene and implement preventive
measures and is associated with better outcomes.33
Barriers to assessment need to be identified and over-
come. This may particularly apply to self-injury, espe-
cially self-cutting.
Psychiatric history
A little over 30% of the patients were receiving some
form of psychiatric care at the time of presentation.
Interestingly, this
figure is similar to the
National
Confidential
Inquiry
finding
that
28%
of
suicides
occurred in individuals who were in contact with mental
health services in the 12 months prior to death.34
Strengths and limitations
This is a large multicentre study of more than 84 000
presentations to EDs of five general hospitals in three
cities of different socioeconomic characteristics across
England (Oxford, Manchester and Derby). As such, it
provides
more
representative
information
than
any
single-centre study. It also allows for a comparison
between centres of socioeconomically diverse popula-
tions. However, the study only included individuals pre-
senting to hospital following self-harm, and it is known
that many self-harm episodes do not result in hospital
presentation, especially in young people.35 This is rele-
vant in particular to self-cutting, which is less likely to
result in hospital presentation.36
The rates of self-harm we have reported are based on
urban populations, which are known to be higher than
in rural populations.37 Furthermore, some of the data
reported were based on information available only for
those assessed (ie, approximately 53% of all episodes of
self-harm), which may have limited generalisability as
there are known differences between patients who do
and do not receive a psychosocial assessment following
self-harm.15
CONCLUSIONS
There have been similar trends in rates of self-harm and
suicide in England in recent years. Of note is the steady
increase in self-harm observed since 2008, particularly in
males, which coincided with the economic recession.
Rates of self-harm also appeared to have increased in
individuals aged over 54 years. Reliably collected data on
self-harm
may
provide
an
important
and
sensitive
mental health indicator.
Our finding that only a little over half of individuals
presenting to hospital after self-harm were offered psy-
chosocial assessment and that individuals who self-
injured were least likely to receive an assessment,
coupled with the rise in self-injury as a method of self-
harm and the link between such methods and suicide,
may have important implications for the management of
self-harm in hospitals. These include efforts to increase
the overall rate of psychosocial assessment of patients
who self-harm and, especially, to ensure that more of
those who present with self-injury receive an assessment
than appears to be current practice.
