Abstract
Background
Protozoan parasites from the genus Leishmania cause broad clinical manifestations known
as leishmaniases, which affect millions of people worldwide. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL),
caused by L. major, is one the most common forms of the disease in the Old World. There is
no preventive or therapeutic human vaccine available for L. major CL, and existing drug
treatments are expensive, have toxic side effects, and resistant parasite strains have been
reported. Hence, further therapeutic interventions against the disease are necessary. Ter-
minal, non-reducing, and linear α-galactopyranosyl (α-Gal) epitopes are abundantly found
on the plasma membrane glycolipids of L. major known as glycoinositolphospholipids. The
absence of these α-Gal epitopes in human cells makes these glycans highly immunogenic
and thus potential targets for vaccine development against CL.
Methodology/Principal findings
Here, we evaluated three neoglycoproteins (NGPs), containing synthetic α-Gal epitopes
covalently attached to bovine serum albumin (BSA), as vaccine candidates against L.
major, using α1,3-galactosyltransferase-knockout (α1,3GalT-KO) mice. These transgenic
mice, similarly to humans, do not express nonreducing, linear α-Gal epitopes in their cells
and are, therefore, capable of producing high levels of anti-α-Gal antibodies. We observed

Galα-BSA (NGP17B), was able to significantly reduce the size of footpad lesions by 96% in
comparison to control groups. Furthermore, we observed a robust humoral and cellular
immune response with production of high levels of protective lytic anti-α-Gal antibodies and
induction of Th1 cytokines.
Conclusions/Significance
We propose that NGP5B is an attractive candidate for the study of potential synthetic α-Gal-
neoglycoprotein-based vaccines against L. major infection.
Author summary
Despite a worldwide prevalence, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) remains largely neglected,
with no prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine available. In the Old World, CL is mainly
caused by either Leishmania major or L. tropica parasites, which produce localized cutane-
ous ulcers, often leading to scarring and social stigma. Currently, the disease has reached
hyperendemicity levels in the Middle East due to conflict and human displacement. Fur-
thermore, the first choice of treatment in that region continues to be pentavalent antimo-
nials, which are costly and highly toxic, and current vector control measures alone are not
sufficient to stop disease transmission. Hence, a vaccine against CL would be very benefi-
cial. Previous studies have demonstrated that sugars are promising vaccine candidates
against leishmaniasis, since most parasite species have a cell surface coat composed of
immunogenic sugars, including linear α-galactopyranosyl (α-Gal) epitopes, which are
absent in humans. Here, we have developed an α-Gal-based vaccine candidate, named
NGP5B. When tested in transgenic mice which like humans lack α-Gal epitopes in their
cells, NGP5B was able to induce a significant partial protection against L. major infection,
by significantly reducing mouse footpad lesions and parasite burden. Altogether, we pro-
pose NGP5B as a promising preventive vaccine for CL caused by L. major.
Introduction
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected, vector-borne disease caused by several species of
the protozoan parasite, Leishmania. CL currently affects up to 1.2 million people worldwide
annually [1], although due to stigma and psychological burden post-infection, its prevalence
has been recently estimated to be around 40 million [2]. Because of conflict and large human
displacement, the disease is currently hyperendemic in the Middle East [3, 4]. Spread by the
bite of an infected sandfly, CL is characterized by localized cutaneous ulcers with different clin-
ical presentations [5]. Currently, there is no commercially available preventive or therapeutic
human vaccine for CL and, depending on the region, vector control is insufficient or nonexis-
tent. Furthermore, when prevention fails, infected patients rely on expensive and highly toxic
drugs (mainly antimonials), which are costly and have become ineffective in some areas due to
emerging resistant parasite strains [6]. Despite current advances, the development of a safe,
affordable and fully protective anti-leishmaniasis vaccine continues to be a challenge. Experi-
mental vaccines have been explored; however, they either lack the ability to confer full sterile
protection against parasite challenge, show outcomes which considerably differ by location,

 and/or the clinical trial was abandoned due to safety regulations [7–9]. Therefore, develop-
ment of a fully protective vaccine against CL is much needed.
During the life cycle of L. major or L. tropica, the main species responsible for CL in the Old
World, parasites must survive and proliferate inside the hostile environment of human macro-
phages. They use different evasion mechanisms, including the formation of a protective glyco-
calyx barrier that is mainly composed of protein-free glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchors, known as glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), among other surface glycoconjugates
[10–14]. In L. major, highly abundant Type-II GIPL-2 and GIPL-3 are capped with terminal,
non-reducing α-galactopyranosyl (α-Galp or α-Gal) residues with different structural configu-
rations (Galpα(1,3)Galƒβ-R and Galpα(1,6)Galpα(1,3)Galƒβ-R, respectively; where R is the
remaining GPI anchor) [15]. These glycolipids are conserved throughout the parasite’s life
cycle, and are highly abundant (i.e., >1010 copies/cell) in the amastigote (mammalian) stage
[13]. Due to the inactivation of the α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GalT) gene [16], terminal,
non-reducing and linear α-Gal epitopes are absent and, therefore, highly immunogenic to
humans and Old World nonhuman primates. Thus, healthy human individuals normally pro-
duce anti-α-Gal antibodies (also known as normal anti-Gal antibodies) against α-Gal epitopes
found in lipopolysaccharides of enterobacteria [17–19]. On the other hand, during infections
with Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania spp., or Plasmodium spp., parasite-specific anti-α-Gal
antibodies are elicited [20–27]. These antibodies have different specificities than normal anti-
α-Gal antibodies. For instance, T. cruzi-specific anti-α-Gal antibodies have been used as reli-
able biomarkers for diagnosis and follow-up of chemotherapy of patients with chronic Chagas
disease [28, 29]. More recently, similar roles and applications have been proposed for anti-α-
Gal antibodies produced during CL [26]. In both acute and chronic phases of Chagas disease,
T. cruzi-specific IgM and IgG anti-α-Gal antibodies are trypanolytic and protective [22, 25,
30], and a vaccine based on the major parasite α-Gal epitope has been proposed [31]. In Plas-
modium infections in children, however, IgM but not IgG anti-α-Gal antibodies appear to
have a protective effect [27]. Although the levels of anti-α-Gal antibodies are very high in
Leishmania infections [21, 23, 24, 26], it has not yet been demonstrated whether these antibod-
ies have any protective role. More recently, Jaurigue and Seeberger [32] have proposed α-Gal
epitopes as vaccine candidates against Leishmania spp. and other major protozoan parasites.
In this study, we explore this possibility by evaluating neoglycoproteins (NGPs) containing
synthetic α-Gal epitopes in different configurations, as potential preventive L. major vaccine
candidates in the α1,3-galactosyltransferase-knockout (α1,3-GalT-KO) mouse model, which
does not express terminal α-Gal epitopes on their cells [33, 34].

 Melbourne, Australia. Animals were bred and maintained under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2),
pathogen-free conditions at the Laboratory Animal Resources Center (LARC) at UTEP. Six to
eight-week old female α1,3GalT-KO mice were used for all experiments.
Human sera
Human serum samples from adult patients with L. major active (n = 5) or cured CL (n = 5)
infections, or adults with heterologous (non-CL) infections (n = 5) were obtained from the Al-
Ahsa region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which is exclusively endemic for L. major CL
[35]. Detailed information on each serum sample regarding sex, age, and race of the patient
was not available for this study.
Parasites
Promastigote forms of transgenic L. major expressing firefly luciferase (L. major-luc) (Lmj-
FV1-LUC-TK [L. major strain Friedlin], clone V1) [36, 37], kindly donated by Prof. Stephen
M. Beverley (Washington University in St. Louis, MO), were grown at 28˚C in M199 medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, Waltham, MA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Infective metacyclic promastigote
forms were purified by Ficoll gradient at stationary phase (3–5 days), as previously described
[38].
Neoglycoproteins
The NGPs Galα(1,3)Galβ(1,4)Glcβ-BSA (NGP1B), Galα-BSA (NGP3B), Galα(1,6)Galβ-BSA
(NGP5B), Galα(1,2)Galβ-BSA (NGP8B), Galα(1,6)[Galα(1,2)]Galβ-BSA (NGP11B), Galα(1,4)
Galβ-BSA (NGP12B), Galβ-BSA (NGP13B), and Galα(1,3)Galα-BSA (NGP17B) were obtained
as previously described [39]. Briefly, mercaptopropyl glycan derivatives were synthesized and
covalently coupled to commercially available maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin
(BSA) (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate their respective NGPs. A schematic repre-
sentation of the NGP synthesis is shown in Fig 1A.
The glycan load for each NGP was measured using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioniza-
tion time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Axima, Shimadzu), as described
[31]. Lyophilized underivatized BSA (control) or NGP was first diluted in sterile deionized
water to a 1.0–1.5 mg/μL solution. Pre-loading mix was prepared by adding 5 μL of diluted
NGP or BSA, 2.5 μL of sinapinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.5 μL acetonitrile:water (2:1, v/v)
with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, 0.5 μL of pre-loading mix was
applied to MALDI-plate spot and allowed to air dry. Once dried, 100 shots were fired per spot
and 20 spectra were acquired. The glycan load per NGP molecule was calculated by subtracting
the BSA average molecular mass from the NGP average molecular mass, and dividing it by the
nominal molecular mass of one glycan-linker unit (636 Da) (Fig 1B).
Immunizations
The NGPs Galα(1,6)Galβ-BSA (NGP5B), Galα(1,4)Galβ-BSA (NGP12B), and Galα(1,3)Galα-
BSA (NGP17B), obtained as described above, were first redissolved in sterile deionized water
and then diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, immediately prior to
immunizations. Phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) sequence 1826 con-
taining two CpG motifs (5’-TCCATGACGTTC-CTGACGTT-3’) (CpG ODN or CpG adju-
vant) was obtained from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA) and was dissolved in endotoxin-free,
0.9% NaCl solution, at 2 mg/mL. NGP12B, NGP17B, and NGP5B were administrated at 10 μg/

 dose in a final volume of 200 μL PBS. NGP5B was also administrated at 10 μg/dose in combi-
nation with CpG (NGP5B+CpG) adjuvant at 20 μg/dose in a final volume of 200 μL. Control
groups were immunized with CpG (20 μg/dose) or PBS alone in a final volume of 200 μL. A
total of four immunizations were subcutaneously administrated at 7-day intervals.

 Chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(chemiluminescent ELISA) with CL-infected patients
Chemiluminescent ELISA [26] was performed for screening the IgG response to various
α-Gal-containing NGPs in patients with active or cured CL infections, or patients with het-
erologous (non-CL) skin infections. Briefly, 96-well Nunc polystyrene microplates (Thermo
Scientific) were coated overnight at 4˚C with 250 ng/well of each NGP in 200 mM carbonate-
bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (CBB). Plates were blocked with 100 μL 1% BSA-PBS (BSA, Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37˚C before washing three times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20
(Sigma-Aldrich) (PBS-T). Pools of human sera at 1:100 dilution (in PBS) were analyzed in trip-
licate. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C. Goat anti-human IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich;
50 μL, 1:1000 dilution) in PBS was added and incubated for 1 h at 37˚C. Donkey biotinylated
anti-goat IgG conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 50 μL, 1:1000 dilution) in PBS was added
and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-streptavidin (Invi-
trogen; 50 μL, 1:2000 dilution) in PBS was added and plates were incubated for 30 min at
37˚C. Plates were washed three times between steps with PBS-T, except before blocking. The
reaction was developed with Super-Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) at 1:8 dilution in 50 μL CBB and relative luminescence units were measured using a
FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG LabTech, Baden-Wu
¨rttemberg, Germany). Serum
samples used to generate the pools were selected at random from three different patient
groups: cured CL infections, active CL infections, or heterologous diseases (control group).
Heterologous controls included patients that had skin abnormalities that mimicked CL (e.g.,
eczema) but without the Leishmania parasite. Wells with PBS (no serum controls) were added
to address background nonspecific reactivities.
Chemiluminescent ELISA with sera from vaccinated α1,3GalT-KO mice
Blood was obtained from all animals by facial vein puncture, and serum was obtained by cen-
trifugation (2,500 xg, 10 min, 4˚C). To assess the humoral immune response, levels of specific
anti-α-Gal antibody titers were determined by chemiluminescent ELISA, as previously
described [26, 39]. MaxiSorp Nunc polystyrene microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
coated with 125 ng/well of each NGP in CBB and incubated overnight at 4˚C. Plates were
blocked with 200 μL 1% BSA-PBS, and incubated with mouse sera (50 μL) from vaccinated or
control groups at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at 37˚C. Donkey biotinylated anti-mouse (Pierce,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at 1:2000 dilution in 1% BSA/PBS with 0.05% Tween 20
(1% BSA/PBS-T). NeutrAvidin-HRP (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at 1:5000
dilution in 1% BSA/PBS-T. Plates were washed 3x between steps with PBS-T, except before
blocking. The reaction was developed with SuperSignal Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Luminescence (in RLUs) was measured by Luminoskan
luminometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
α-Galactosidase treatment
To test the specificity of the IgG antibodies elicited in mice immunized with NGP5B or
NGP5B+CpG, immobilized NGP5B used as antigen was pretreated with green coffee bean
α-galactosidase (G8507, Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described [26]. First, MaxiSorp Nunc
polystyrene microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) wells were coated with 125 ng/well of
NGP5B in CBB and incubated overnight at 4˚C. The plate was blocked with 200 μL 5% skim
milk-PBS for 1 h at 37˚C, and washed three times with 200 μL PBS-T. In parallel, two hundred
microliters of α-galactosidase (in ammonium sulfate suspension, �9 units/mg protein) were

 centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 10 min at 4˚C to remove the excess ammonium sulfate. The super-
natant was discarded and the pellet containing the enzyme was gently redissolved in ice-cold
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Fifty microliters of the enzyme solution (0.002
units/μL) were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 24 h at 37˚C. The micro-
plate was washed twice with 200 μL PBS-T and the chemiluminescent ELISA was performed
as described above.
Parasite challenge
Six to eight-week old female α1,3GalT-KO mice (n = 3 per group) were inoculated with 1 x
105 L. major-luc metacyclic promastigotes in the left hind footpad 3 weeks after last immuniza-
tion. Mice lesion size (mm) was monitored weekly with a digital caliper.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging and weight monitoring
To measure disease progression, in vivo bioluminescence imaging of L. major-luc was
acquired. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 150 mg.kg-1 D-luciferin (Gold Bio-
technology, St. Louis, MO) and anesthetized with 2.5% gaseous isoflurane in oxygen. Images
were acquired 15 min after luciferin injection using IVIS Lumina III In Vivo Imaging System
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Additionally, for any sign of toxicity mice were periodically
weighed, and weight change was normalized using the initial mouse weight.
Parasite load by quantitative PCR
At experimental endpoint, mice were sacrificed by CO2 overdose and infected footpads from
all groups were harvested. Genomic DNA from 20 to 30 mg of tissue was extracted with High
Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit following the manufactures protocol without modifica-
tions (Roche Molecular Systems, Indianapolis, IN). As internal control, a linearized pUC57
plasmid containing a sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana was spiked before all DNA extrac-
tions as previously described [40]. Parasite load was measured by absolute quantification
based on a standard DNA curve ranging from 0.5 to 105 L. major parasite equivalents/mL. A
standard curve was produced by extracting DNA from a 20 to 30 mg tissue fragment, spiked
with 105 L. major promastigotes (spiked DNA). In parallel, DNA was extracted from 20 to 30
mg of tissue fragment from uninfected mice (negative control DNA). Afterwards, spiked DNA
was 10-fold serially diluted in the negative control DNA. Amplification of 120 bp-fragment
from the kinetoplast DNA of L. major was performed using 100 nM of forward primer (5’-CT
TTTCTGGTCCTCCGGGTAGG-3’), 100 nM of reverse primer (5’-CCACCCGGCCCTATTT
TACACCAA-3’), and 50 nM of TaqMan probe (FAM-TTTTCGCAGAACGCCCCTACCC
GC-TAMRA); a total of 100 ng of DNA was added to a reaction in a final volume of 20 μL [41,
42]. The exogenous internal amplification control (IAC) was amplified using 100 nM of for-
ward primer (5’-ACCGTCATGGAACAGCACGTA-3’), 100 nM of reverse primer (5’- CTCC
CGCAACAAACCCTATAAAT-3’), and 50 nM of TaqMan probe (VIC-AGCATCTGTTCT
TGAAGGT-NFQ-MGB). PCR conditions consisted of 50˚C for 2 min, 94˚C for 10 min, fol-
lowed by 45 cycles at 94˚C for 15 sec and 55˚C for 1 min. Samples were run in triplicate in
Step One Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Serum cytokine profile
Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines (IL-12p40, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-
17) were analyzed using multiplex kit, MILLIPLEX Mouse Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Sera (at 1:2 dilution) from all immunized groups and controls

 were analyzed at 3 weeks after last immunization, prior to challenge (day 0), following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoglobulin isotyping
Additionally, antibody levels of mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b IgG3, and IgE specific to NGP5B
were analyzed by ELISA at boost 3 (B3, day -21) and experimental endpoint (day 43). Briefly,
96-well Nunc polystyrene microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4˚C
with 125 ng/well of NGP5B in CBB. Plates were blocked with 200 μL 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h at
37˚C. Mouse serum was diluted at either 1:400 (B3) or 1:100 (endpoint) dilution in PBS. To
detect the various mouse IgG subtypes secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP were used
(goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP, goat anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP, goat anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP, and
goat anti-mouse IgG3-HRP). All secondary antibody conjugates were from Abcam (Cam-
bridge, MA). The antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in PBS and 100 μL was added to each well.
Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37˚C, followed by washing three times with PBS-T (200 μL)
between the steps. The reaction was developed with 100 μL Super-Signal Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at1:8 dilution in CBB and read using a FLUOstar Omega
microplate reader (BMG LabTech). A pool of sera from α1,3GalT-KO mice was used as nega-
tive control. Biological replicates were run for each test group.
Lytic assay of L. major metacyclic promastigotes
L. major metacyclic promastigotes (200 μL of 1 x 106 parasites/ml DMEM) were pre-incubated
with 10% fresh sera (with active complement) from mice immunized with NGP5B, NGP5B
+CpG, CpG, or PBS. Prior to the lytic assay, in selected incubation mixtures, complement was
heat-inactivated at 56˚C for 30 min before adding serum to the parasites. 0.5 μg/mL propidium
iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in deionized water was added after 10 min of parasite-
serum incubation, followed by additional 30-min incubation at room temperature (RT) for all
experimental samples. A total of 5,000 events were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Gallios
Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The percentage of PI-positive events (= % of dead para-
sites) were graphed.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell analysis by flow cytometry
Three weeks after the last immunization prior to challenge (day 0) or post-challenge (end-
point, day 43), splenocytes were harvested from mice (n = 3 per group) and cultured in freshly
prepared Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’ medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-
vated FBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.5 mM 2-mer-
captoethanol (2-ME). After splenocyte harvesting, ten milliliters of red blood cell lysis solution

to cells for 10 min, and splenocytes were cultured in 12-well flat-bottom plates (Corning
Costar, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stimulated in vitro with 20 μg/ml of antigen (NGP5B or
NGP5B+CpG) at 37˚C, in 5% CO2 atmosphere, for 24 h. In brief, Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR)
was blocked with 10% heat-inactivated naïve α1,3GalT-KO mouse serum and cells were
stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies PE-Cy7-labeled anti-CD3e, PE-labeled anti-
CD4, FITC-labeled anti-CD8, APC-labeled anti-CD44, and Alexa Fluor 700-labeled anti-
CD69 (all conjugates were from BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), along with the appropriate iso-
type controls (BD Bioscience) for 30 min at 4˚C. Cells were washed with PBS with 1% BSA
plus 0.09% sodium azide, and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. A total of 10,000 events were
acquired using a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed by Kaluza Software
(Beckman Coulter). Gates were set for cells, followed by lymphocytes (CD3e-Pe-Cy7 labeling)

Results
Evaluation of synthetic neoglycoproteins as potential biomarkers in L.
major-infected individuals
The antigenicity and specificity of eight NGPs containing different synthetic α-Gal epitopes
were evaluated by chemiluminescent ELISA using pools of sera from L. major-infected patients
with active or cured CL infections, from an endemic region of Saudi Arabia. Heterologous
controls included patients who had skin abnormalities that mimicked CL (e.g., eczema) but
without Leishmania parasites (Fig 2). NGP17B (Galα(1,3)Galα-BSA), NGP12B (Galα(1,4)
Galβ-BSA), and NGP5B (Galα(1,6)Galβ-BSA) showed the best differential reactivity between

 active CL vs. cured CL infection, and active CL vs. heterologous infection. Although highly
reactive with the serum pool from patients with active CL infection, NGP8B and NGP11B
showed higher cross-reactivity with the heterologous control. Conversely, NGP3B and NGP1B
showed little or no differential reactivity between active and cured CL infection. Together,
these results suggest that NGP17B, NGP12B, and NGP5B are immunogenic and potential bio-
markers of active CL infection.
Synthetic NGPs as vaccine candidates against L. major infection
The relative high specificity and antigenicity of NGP12B, NGP17B, and NGP5B in active CL
infection led us to interrogate whether these NGPs would also be able to induce protective
response against in vivo L. major infection. To this end, we used C57BL/6 α1,3GalT-KO mice,
which lack α-Gal epitopes in their cells and tissues, therefore mimicking human antibody
responses to these epitopes [33, 43]. Animals (n = 6 per group) were subjected to four immuni-
zations of NGP12B, NGP17B, or NGP5B, or control (BSA) (10 μg/dose/200 μL PBS, at 7-day
intervals). Three weeks after the last immunization, the specific IgG levels were measured by
chemiluminescent ELISA, as previously described [31]. A strong antibody response was
observed in the animals immunized with NGP12B, NGP17B, or NGP5B when compared to
the control group (BSA) (Fig 3A). However, we also observed a significant cross-reactivity
between the NGPs, although antibodies against NGP5B had lower (~39–49%) cross-reactivity
with NGP12B and NGP17B. Next, to assess the protective ability of these NGPs, mice were
challenged with 1 x 105 L. major-luc metacyclic promastigotes and footpad lesion was evalu-
ated for 81 days post-challenge (Fig 3B). In comparison with control group (BSA), NGP5B vac-
cination was able to maintain significantly lower lesion size in immunized mice throughout
the course of the infection. Although NGP12B and NGP17B showed a protective trend
towards the end of infection follow-up, there was no statistical significance when compared to

than NGP12B and NGP17B, and therefore was selected to be further evaluated as a vaccine
candidate.
NGP5B elicits significant protection against L. major challenge in
α1,3GalT-KO mice
First, six mice per group were immunized with NGP5B (10 μg/dose) or in combination with
the adjuvant CpG (20 μg/dose). Control mice groups were immunized with either 20 μg/dose
of CpG, or PBS. Prime (P) and 3 boost immunizations (B1-B3) were performed subcutane-
ously at 7-day intervals, followed by L. major challenge three weeks after last immunization
(B3) (Fig 4A). In vivo bioluminescence imaging (n = 3) was acquired at 14, 21, 33, and 43 days
post-infection (dpi) (Fig 4B). Quantification of luminescence in the footpads is represented
by the radiance (photons per second per centimeter squared per steradian, p/s/cm2/sr) per
infected footpad/mouse. In comparison to the PBS control group, NGP5B significantly
reduced (P<0.0001) parasite bioluminescence, when administrated alone or in combination
with the CpG adjuvant(P<0.0001) (Fig 4C). This was corroborated by significant parasite load

 reduction in the footpad as detected by qPCR in animals immunized with NGP5B (69%)
(P<0.01) and NGP5B+CpG (72%) (P<0.05), as compared to the PBS control group (Fig 4D).
Furthermore, in contrast to animals treated with CpG or PBS, animals vaccinated with NGP5B
or, in particular, NGP5B+CpG, gained weight following parasite challenge, indicating there-
fore that these animals were healthy (Fig 4E). Taken together, these findings confirmed that
both NGP5B and NGP5B+CpG induce partial but significant protect against L. major
infection.
NGP5B induces a specific humoral immune response
To determine and characterize the humoral immune response produced by NGP5B and
NGP5B+CpG, sera from all groups were collected 3 days after each immunization (P and B1-
3), three weeks after last immunization, and at the endpoint (Fig 4A). First, the production of
specific anti-NGP5B IgG antibodies was analyzed by chemiluminescent ELISA using NGP5B
as antigen. As expected, high levels of specific IgG antibodies against NGP5B were observed in
mice immunized with NGP5B or NGP5B+CpG, when compared to PBS or CpG alone. The
high levels of anti-NGP5B antibodies were maintained until the experimental endpoint (Fig
5A). Furthermore, murine immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgE)
specific against NGP5B were analyzed by ELISA (Fig 5B and 5C). At the end of the immuniza-
tion (B3), mice immunized with NGP5B+CpG showed the following rank of IgG subclasses:
IgG1>IgG2b>IgG2a>IgG3. Mice immunized with NGP5B alone, on the other hand, showed
a slightly different rank of IgG subclasses: IgG1>IgG3>IgG2a>IgG2b>IgE (Fig 5B). More-
over, at the experimental endpoint (43 dpi), the levels of IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 in-
creased in mice immunized with NGP5B+CpG. In contrast, in the NGP5B-immunized group
we observed an increase in IgG1, and decrease in IgG3 and IgG2a following L. major-luc chal-
lenge (Fig 5C). These results indicate that vaccination with NGP5B or NGP5B+CpG can stim-
ulate production of specific IgG isotypes. Furthermore, no increase in the levels of IgE was
observed following vaccination with NGP5B or NGP5B+CpG, or at the experimental endpoint
(43 dpi).
Anti-NGP5B antibodies have lytic activity against L. major metacyclic
promastigotes
The lytic activity of anti-NGP5B antibodies elicited by animals vaccinated with NGP5B or
NGP5B+CpG was investigated by incubating immunized mice sera with L. major-luc metacyc-
lic promastigotes. As observed in Fig 5D, NGP5B+CpG (P<0.001) and NGP5B (P<0.01) anti-
sera caused lysis in 60% and 44% of L. major-luc metacyclic promastigotes, respectively, when
the complement was heat inactivated. Conversely, when complement in these antisera was
active, we observed no significant parasite lysis, indicating that somehow active complement
interferes with the parasite lysis. Therefore, mice immunized with NGP5B or NGP5B+CpG
produced antibodies that are lytic in a complement-independent manner, suggesting a mecha-
nism similar to lytic anti-α-Gal antibodies elicited against Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes
GPI-mucins [25, 44].
Anti-NGP5B response is specific against terminal α-Gal residues
The maleimide derivative succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate
(SMCC) cross-linker commonly used for the conjugation of carbohydrates and peptides to
BSA was reported to elicit high levels of anti-linker antibodies [45]. To detect antibodies
against the maleimide cross-linker used in our NGPs, maleimide-derivatized BSA (Fig 1A)
was blocked with 2-ME to give rise to 2ME-BSA [46]. The specificity of anti-NGP5B and anti-

 linker antibodies of sera (3 weeks post-B3 and endpoint) from mice immunized with NGP5B,
NGP5B+CpG, CpG, or PBS was analyzed by chemiluminescent ELISA. As indicated in Fig 6A,
sera from NGP5B- and NGP5B+CpG-immunized mice (3 weeks post-B3) had a very strong
and specific antibody reactivity (P<0.0001) against NGP5B antigen and a very weak reactivity
against the linker in 2ME-BSA antigen. However, we observed that at the endpoint of the
experiment (Fig 6B), contrary to NGP5B, NGP5B+CpG elicited a considerable antibody
response against 2ME-BSA. Next, NGP5B was treated or not with α-galactosidase, overnight
at 37˚C, to remove terminal α-Gal residues to confirm the main specificity of anti-NGP5B anti-
bodies. In comparison with untreated groups, we observed a significant (P<0.01) decrease in
the reactivity against NGP5B+CpG (90%) and NGP5B (75%) (Fig 6C). This result indicates
that most antibodies produced against NGP5B an NGP5B+CpG recognize the terminal α-Gal
residue in the NGP.

 NGP5B induces a protective Th1 cellular immune response
To study the cellular immune response induced by NGP5B and NGP5B+CpG vaccination in
α1,3GalT-KO mice, a panel of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines (IL-12p40, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α,
IL-5, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-17) were analyzed in the sera of immunized mice before chal-
lenge with L. major-luc three weeks after last immunization (day 0; Fig 4A). Significant higher
levels of Th1 cytokines: IL-12p40 (P<0.001), IL-2 (P<0.05), and IFN-γ (P<0.001) (Fig 7A–
7D); and Th2 cytokine IL-5 (P<0.05) (Fig 7G) were observed in NGP5B-immunized group in
comparison with control (naïve) group. Furthermore, we detected a significant increase in the
IFN-γ/IL-4 (P<0.05) and IFN-γ/IL-10 (P<0.05) ratios in mice vaccinated with NGP5B (Fig
7H and 7I). A lower induction of proinflammatory cytokines was observed upon NGP5B
+CpG immunization. Only IL-12p40 (P<0.05) and TNF-α (P<0.05) were significantly
increased in that vaccinated group. On the other hand, we did not detect significant differences

 for IL-10, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-6 regulatory cytokines in comparison with control group (Fig 7E
and 7F, and S1 Fig) in both NGP5B and NGP5B+CpG. In summary, these results suggest that
animals immunized with NGP5B showed strong protective Th1 cellular immune response
against L. major infection.
Vaccination with NGP5B induces a robust T-cell response
We first assessed the antigen-specific response of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, at three weeks after
last immunization (pre-challenge) and at the endpoint of the experiment (post-challenge). We
also evaluated the levels of activated CD69+ and memory CD44+ T cells in immunized-chal-
lenged animals. NGP5B- and NGP5B+CpG-immunized mice developed a high expression of
antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response, with a significant increase in the post-chal-
lenge time-points as compared to the control mice, CpG or PBS stimulated with NGP5B or
NGP5B+CpG antigen (Fig 8A and 8B). Interestingly, after mice were challenged with L. major,

 a significant upregulation of memory CD44+CD4+ T cells and CD44+CD8+ T cells was found
in both NGP5B (P�0.05) and NGP5B+CpG (P�0.05) groups (Fig 8C and 8D), together with
high expression levels of CD4+CD69+ T cells (Fig 8C). These findings demonstrate that vacci-
nation with NGP5B and NGP5B+CpG in α1,3GalT-KO mice can induce a robust CD4+ T cell
response, accompanied by a CD8+ T cell response, both necessary for the protection against L.
major.
Discussion
Currently, leishmaniasis is endemic in 90 countries, with more than 2 million new cases per
year, and a worldwide incidence of 350 million people at risk of infection [2, 3]. CL is the most

 common form of the disease with an estimated 0.7 to 1.2 million annual cases, representing
50–75% CL new cases [2]. Despite current advances [47–51], there is no human vaccine avail-
able that confers sterile protection against this neglected disease [52]. Nevertheless, previous
studies have shown that a vaccine against CL is a viable and feasible approach [53]. Thus, a pre-
ventive CL vaccine will have a great public health impact in terms of treatment and preventing
disease dissemination in conflict regions [3]. These facts underscore the urgent need for the
development of a fully protective vaccine against CL. Here, by targeting α-Gal glycotopes
abundantly expressed on the L. major surface [10, 11], we evaluated the first synthetic α-Gal-
containing NGP (Galα(1,6)Galβ-BSA or NGP5B) against L. major infection in the α1,3GalT-
KO mouse model.
First, we evaluated a series of eight synthetic α-Gal-containing NGPs as potential biomark-
ers in serum samples from patients infected with L. major from Saudi Arabia. Three highly dif-
ferential biomarkers were selected (NGP17B, NGP12B, and NGP5B) and investigated as
potential vaccine candidates against L. major infection in a murine model. We observed high
levels of anti-α-Gal antibodies produced in α1,3GalT-KO mice vaccinated with NGP12B and
NGP17B, offering partial protection against L. major infection. More importantly, NGP5B
offered a significant, partial protection against the infection with a strong humoral response.
To increase the protection against L. major infection, the CpG-ODN adjuvant in combination
with NGP5B (NGP5B+CpG) was also evaluated. A robust antibody response was observed in
both vaccinated groups (NGP5B and NGP5B+CpG), when compared to PBS and CpG control
groups. Previously, Yilmaz et al. (2014) studied a synthetic α-Gal epitope (Galα(1,3)Galβ(1,4)
GlcNAc) as vaccine candidate for Plasmodium infection [27]. Interestingly, they detected high
levels of IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3, and little or no circulating IgG2a in immunized α1,3GalT-KO
mice [27]. Similarly, our NGP5B-immunized (noninfected) mice also showed high levels of
IgG1 and IgG3, and lower levels of IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses. As for the NGP5B+CpG-
immunized noninfected group, high levels of IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2a and low levels of IgG3
and IgE were observed. The CpG adjuvant is known to increase murine B cells to produce
IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 isotypes [54]. Taken together, these findings indicate that NGP5B
+CpG, and to a slightly lesser extent NGP5B, induces a strong IgG response associated with
protection against L. major infection.
Consequently, the study of lytic parasite-specific anti-α-Gal antibodies is also of great
interest in L. major infection as we anticipate that, similar to Chagas disease [22, 25, 29], these
antibodies could have a protect role against infection. Here, we observed that sera from
α1,3GalT-KO mice immunized NGP5B or NGP5B+CPG had a significant complement-inde-
pendent lytic activity towards infective metacyclic promastigote forms of the parasite. Britting-
ham et al. (1985) [55] have previously demonstrated that Leishmania is able to exploit the
opsonic effects of complement while avoiding complement-mediated lysis. The expression of
gp63 accelerates the change of C3b to its inactive form, reducing the fixation of terminal com-
plement components such as C5 and C7, and the formation of the membrane attack complex,
resulting in a resistance to complement-mediated lysis [55]. Furthermore, previous work in
the metacyclic promastigote form of the parasite demonstrate an increased resistance to com-
plement-mediated lysis in comparison to the promastigote form of the parasite [56]. Our
study provides evidence that immunization with NGP5B or NGP5B+CPG can elicit anti-α-
Gal antibodies with lytic, complement-independent activity against L. major-luc metacyclic
promastigotes, which may serve as one of the mechanisms conferring protection against
infection.
To successfully control CL infection, a Th1-mediated immunity is desired [57, 58]. We
observed that NGP5B induced a predominantly Th1-mediated cellular immune response in
α1,3GalT-KO mice, with an increase in IL-12p40, IL-2, and IFN-γ, which are related to the
α-Gal-neoglycoprotein vaccine against Leishmania major

 protection against CL. On the other hand, NGP5B+CpG induced mainly IL-12p40 and TNF-
α. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend of higher IL-12p40 level in the
NGP5B+CpG-immunized group in comparison to the group immunized with NGP5B alone.
It has been recently reported that CpG-ODN can upregulate the secretion of IL-12 by the help
of inflammatory monocytes [59]. It is known that macrophages are primarily involved in the
destruction of intracellular parasites such as L. major by the secretion of IL-12, causing the dif-
ferentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells and the production IFN-γ and IL-2 cytokines [60–
62]. The production of IL-12 and IFN-γ activates the up-regulation of nitric oxide in macro-
phages producing an oxidative burst that subsequently kills the parasite. Additionally, no sig-
nificant increase in IL-10 and IL-4 cytokines were observed, which are associated with disease
progression through suppression of macrophage activation [60–62]. On the contrary, signifi-
cant higher IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ/IL-10 ratios, which are indicative of a favorable outcome in
CL infection [57], were observed in the animals vaccinated with NGP5B. Interestingly, recruit-
ment and maturation of eosinophils to the site of L. major infection is modulated by the pro-
duction of IL-5 and studies have shown that eosinophils play a role in parasite clearance by
suppressing the developing lesion and having antimicrobial activity against L. mexicana and L.
donovani [63]. Therefore, induction of this cytokine, observed here by immunization with
NGP5B, could be beneficial for the control of L. major infection in α1,3GalT-KO mice.
The activation and expansion of T cells are fundamental to mount an adaptive immune
response for long-term protection against L. major infection and essential in vaccine efficacy
optimization [64, 65]. Therefore, in our study, the cellular immune response was determined
by the percentage of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in both immunized non-challenged,
and immunized challenged mice. Additionally, CD44 and CD69 expression was measured for
T cell activation before and after infection with L. major. First, we observed a robust antigen
specific CD4+ T cell response as well as a CD8+ T cell response before and after infection.
Interestingly, after infection (43 dpi), a high proportion of antigen specific CD4+ T cells
expressing CD44 and CD69 were observed in both NGP5B and NGP5B+CPG mice. Moreover,
a small population of CD8+ T cells expressing CD44 was also observed. This may suggest that
antigen-dependent T-cell stimulation was still in course [66]. Altogether, these results suggest
that NGP5B or NGP5B+CPG vaccination can elicit strong T cell immunity, since both CD4+
and CD8+ T cells are important in controlling parasite burden against L. major infection [57].
Previously, the immunogenicity of three different maleimide derivatives linkers was investi-
gated [45]. Interestingly, a high level of anti-linker antibodies was found against maleimide-
derivative linkers containing an additional aliphatic or aromatic ring [45]. In this study, we
found that NGP5B-vaccinated mice had a specific and strong antibody response against the
terminal α-Gal epitope in NGP5B, and not against the linker when using 2-ME-BSA as antigen
[46]. However, we observed that the NGP5B+CPG group had a significant antibody response
against 2-ME-BSA at the experimental endpoint (43 dpi), suggesting that the L. major infec-
tion might be eliciting antibodies that can cross-react with the linker. Nevertheless, for future
glycan conjugation to the carrier protein, a smaller and more flexible linker could be used to
achieve a more specific immune response against the glycotope [46].
Carbohydrates have been proposed as potential targets for vaccines against Leishmania spp.
[32, 67]. Vaccination with Leishmania lipophosphoglycan (LPG), one of the major compo-
nents of the glycocalyx of the parasite, revealed contradictory results [68–70]. For instance,
LPG purified from L. donovani failed to protect against L. major infection in BALB/c mice
[68]. Martinez Salazar et al. [71] suggested that L. mexicana LPG vaccination induced upregu-
lation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), leading to functional CD8+ T cell inactiva-
tion and, consequently, disease progression. Conversely, Pinheiro et al. [70] demonstrated that
intranasal vaccination with L. amazonensis LPG provided protection in BALB/c mice against
α-Gal-neoglycoprotein vaccine against Leishmania major

 subsequent parasite challenge. Additionally, a synthetic glycovaccine containing fragments of
the phosphoglycan moiety of LPG or proteophosphoglycan (PPG) from L. mexicana exerted a
protective effect in a natural sand fly infection model of CL caused L. mexicana [72]. In the pres-
ent study, we explored NGPs containing non-reducing, terminal α-Gal epitopes similar to those
found in Type-II GIPL-2 and GIPL-3 of L. major [10, 14], as preventive CL vaccines. For
instance, the NGP5B glycotope, Galα(1,6)Galβ, is analogous to the GIPL-3 glycotope, Galα(1,6)
Galα-R, and showed to be highly reactive to sera from active CL infections and partially protec-
tive in the α1,3GalT-KO mouse model. Evaluation of purified GIPL-3 or its synthetic terminal
α-Gal-containing glycotope(s) covalently coupled to a carrier protein as vaccine candidates may
provide evidence whether protective anti-α-Gal antibodies against NGP5B cross-react with the
native glycotope. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the α-Gal-terminating NGP5B, NGP12B,
and NGP17B, evaluated here as vaccine candidates against L. major, and eventually additional
α-Gal-terminating NGPs may protect against other Leishmania species that express Type-II
GIPLs (e.g., L. mexicana) [73] or Type-II-like GIPLs (e.g., L. brasiliensis and L. infantum) [74].
We also speculate that similar or distinct α-Gal-terminating glycotopes could be expressed in
other Leishmania glycoconjugates (e.g., LPG and PPG) and could play a protective role against
leishmaniasis. In this regard, the evaluation of current and additional α-Gal-terminating NGPs
as vaccine candidates against other Leishmania species will be pursued in future studies.
Previous reports have shown that the sand fly saliva plays a critical role in the establishment
and maintenance of Leishmania spp. in the mammalian host, as well as in the pathogenesis of
leishmaniasis and immune responses against the parasite (reviewed in [75, 76]). Accordingly,
the efficacy of vaccines against Leishmania spp. might be considerably influenced by the parasite
challenge procedure, either by needle or sand fly bite. For instance, Peters et al. [77] showed
that the protective effect of a complex L. major vaccine preparation in mice that were initially
needle-challenged could be subsequently abrogated by a sand fly-mediated infection. On the
other hand, Oliveira et al. [78] demonstrated that the protective effect of Phlebotomus duboscqi
uninfected sand fly bites in rhesus macaques. First, they observed that only 30% of animals
exposed to uninfected sand fly bites followed by vector-transmitted L. major challenge, exhib-
ited ulcerated lesions, in comparison to 70% of naïve animals. Furthermore, macaques immu-
nized with a P. duboscqi-derived recombinant salivary protein (PdSP15), followed by sand fly-
challenge with L. major, showed a significant reduction in disease burden, resulting from an
early Th1-mediated anti-parasitic protective immune response involving CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells.
Moreover, besides salivary proteins, Leishmania also releases large quantities of promastigote
secretory gel (PSG) within the sand fly, a glycoconjugate that is regurgitated along with parasites
and is important for establishment of the infection in skin [79]. In summary, these and other
studies (reviewed in [75, 76]) highlight the paramount importance of the natural sand fly-trans-
mitted model of infection in the assessment of efficacy of any potential vaccine against Leish-
mania spp. To this end, the efficacy of current and novel α-Gal-terminating NGP vaccine
candidates will eventually be evaluated in α1,3GalT-KO mice by sand fly-mediated challenge.
In conclusion, here we have demonstrated that the α-Gal-terminating NGP5B vaccine can-
didate, in the presence or not of CpG adjuvant, conferred partial but significant protection
against L. major infection in mice, by eliciting a robust B- and T-cell mediated immune
response through lytic, complement-independent anti-α-Gal antibodies and protective Th1
cytokines.
