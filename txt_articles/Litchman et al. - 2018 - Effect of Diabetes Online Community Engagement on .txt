Abstract
Background: Successful diabetes management requires ongoing lifelong self-care and can require that individuals with diabetes
become experts in translating care recommendations into real-life day-to-day diabetes self-care strategies. The diabetes online
community comprises multiple websites that include social media sites, blogs, and discussion groups for people with diabetes to
chat and exchange information. Online communities can provide disease-specific practical advice and emotional support, allow
users to share experiences, and encourage self-advocacy and patient empowerment. However, there has been little research about
whether diabetes online community use is associated with better diabetes self-care or quality of life.
Objective: The aim of this study was to survey adults with diabetes who participated in the diabetes online community to better
understand and describe who is using the diabetes online community, how they are using it, and whether the use of the diabetes
online community was associated with health indicators.
Methods: We recruited adults diagnosed with diabetes who used at least one of 4 different diabetes-related online communities
to complete an online survey. Participants’ demographics, reported glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), health-related quality of life
(SF-12v2), level of diabetes self-care (Self-Care Inventory-Revised), and diabetes online community use (level of intensity and
engagement) were collected. We examined the relationships between demographics, diabetes online community use, and health
indicators (health-related quality of life, self-care, and HbA1c levels). We used binary logistic regression to determine the extent
to which diabetes online community use predicted an HbA1c <7% or ≥7% after controlling statistically for other variables in the
model.
Results: A total of 183 adults participated in this study. Participants were mostly female (71.6%, 131/183), white (95.1%,
174/183), US citizens (82.5%, 151/183), had type 1 diabetes (69.7%, 129/183), with a mean age of 44.7 years (SD 14) and diabetes
duration of 18.2 years (SD 14.6). Participants had higher diabetes self-care (P<.001, mean 72.4, SD 12.1) and better health-related
quality of life (physical component summary P<.001, mean 64.8, SD 19; mental component summary P<.001, mean 66.6, SD
21.6) when compared with norms for diabetes. Diabetes online community engagement was a strong predictor of A1c, reducing
the odds of having an A1c ≥7% by 33.8% for every point increase in diabetes online community engagement (0-5). Our data also
indicated that study participants are oftentimes (67.2%, 123/183) not informing their healthcare providers about their diabetes
online community use even though most (91.2%, 161/181) are seeing their healthcare provider on a regular basis.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that individuals highly engaged with diabetes online community are more likely to have better
glycemic levels compared with those with lower engagement. Furthermore, diabetes online community users have high health-related
quality of life and diabetes self-care levels. Supplementing usual healthcare activities with diabetes online community use may
encourage knowledge and support among a population that needs to optimize its diabetes self-care. Further studies are needed to
determine how diabetes online community engagement may affect health outcomes.

Introduction
Background
The internet is increasingly used as a source of health
information. In fact, 79% of adults in the United States use the
internet and, of those, 59% are looking for health information
[1]. It is observed that 23% of individuals with chronic
conditions look online to find someone with similar health
concerns [2]. Websites that allow interaction and crowdsourcing
the collective wisdom of others [3] can help patients manage
their own health by providing tools for health promotion and
disease self-care, decision support, support for behavior change,
and access to online communities [4]. Online communities can
support health literacy by crowdsourcing information to support
medical decision making [5,6]. Although many patients are
using online information and communities to improve health
[7] and engagement, how online activity affects health outcomes
is poorly understood, and measuring meaningful eHealth
engagement can be difficult [8].
As diabetes is a complex condition, some people with diabetes
find patient peers helpful in providing support for managing
their disease. Engagement in peer health is defined as the
interaction, education, and support offered by peers with the
same condition to promote self-care. Peers who receive special
training can provide assistance in day-to-day chronic disease
management, encourage appropriate clinical care, and offer
ongoing social and emotional support [9,10]. Trained peers with
diabetes have provided formal face-to-face support or discussion
groups [10,11], phone calls [10,12,13], text support, and home
visits [10]. Diabetes-related peer health has been associated
with increased knowledge [14,15], self-efficacy [11,12,16],
patient activation [11,16], communication with physicians,
healthier eating habits [11,17], and improved hemoglobin A1c
[13,15-24]. Importantly, reciprocal peer support has been found
to be better than nurse care management with regard to glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction [13]. The American Diabetes
Association and American Association of Diabetes Educators
recognize peers as an important factor in diabetes self-care
[25,26]. However, the informal or unstructured peer support
provided by the diabetes online community (DOC) has not been
fully addressed.
Diabetes Online Community
The DOC is a grassroots online community developed for the
purpose of sharing knowledge and support based on the user’s
experience of living with diabetes. Individuals involved in the
DOC were initially those living with diabetes themselves,
although the community has expanded and now includes family,
friends, healthcare providers, and industry representatives [27].
DOC provides a vehicle for individuals to learn practical
diabetes self-care techniques from experienced peers with shared
experiences [27-29], and can be a source of confidence in
diabetes 
self-care 
[30], 
inspiration, 
motivation, 
and
encouragement [31], all of which support health literacy. The
DOC includes blogs, video vlogs, discussion boards, and
diabetes-specific (ie, Reality Check, TuDiabetes, Diabetic
Connect, Beyond Type 1, Diabetes Daily) and general social
media sites (ie, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).
The DOC can be accessed through stand-alone interactive
websites or social media sites. DOC users can actively contribute
to discussions or passively view posts without contributing to
the discussion [32]. DOC users engage in peer health [33,34]
to gain practical advice [35-38], emotional support [35-41],
shared experience [37-39], and improved coping [42] and
empowerment [40]. There is limited data on negative patient
outcomes related to DOC use [43]; however, misinformation
on social media sites is infrequent [35,36,44,45] and quickly
corrected by other members in the discussion group [35,39].
Currently, we are not aware of any research examining the
relationship between DOC engagement and health behaviors.
Objective
The overarching purpose of this study was to better understand
DOC users and how DOC engagement is related to self-reported
health outcomes. The specific aims of this exploratory and
descriptive study were threefold: (1) to describe DOC users in
terms of demographics, diabetes type, and diabetes-related
treatment; (2) to describe intensity of use and levels of
engagement of DOC users; and (3) to examine the relationship
between DOC use (intensity and engagement) and health-related
quality-of-life, self-care behaviors, and HbA1c levels.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted an exploratory cross-sectional study of a
convenience sample of DOC users using an online survey posted
to 4 distinct DOC social media sites. First, we conducted a small
pilot study of DOC users (n=5) and asked for input from 2
diabetes specialty healthcare providers to guide survey
development, and to address usability and technical
functionality. The final 129-item survey included questions
about demographic information, health history, eHealth app
use, DOC intensity and engagement, health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) [46], and diabetes self-care behaviors [47]. We
used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) Survey
software (Nashville, TN) to administer the survey. REDCap
survey is a secure, Web-based study management system.
Sample
Adult DOC users (18 years and older) with a diagnosis of type
1 or type 2 diabetes, or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of
Adulthood (LADA) who could read English, were eligible for
the study. Any participant who identified themselves as having
gestational diabetes, being a caregiver for someone with diabetes
(ie, parent of a child with diabetes), or younger than 18 years

 were excluded from the analyses. The study was approved by
the University of Utah Institutional Review Board, Salt Lake
City, UT. The study was also approved by the administration
team from TuDiabetes and Diabetic Connect; the other 2 sites
were Facebook and Twitter.
Recruitment and Setting
We recruited adult DOC users in 2 waves. We selected the initial
site, TuDiabetes, because it was hosted by a nonprofit
organization, the Diabetes Hands Foundation, that did not allow
advertisements. TuDiabetes members were screened by an
administrator before they could join, posts could be viewed by
members without logging in to their account. TuDiabetes had
more than 35,000 members with diabetes at the time of the
study. Initially, we posted a synopsis of the study with a link to
the survey on the principal investigator’s TuDiabetes profile
page, which was shared by key opinion leaders and mentioned
in the TuDiabetes online newsletter. The first question of the
survey asked individuals if they consented to participate in the
study and provided a link to further information about the study
purpose and method.
A second wave of recruitment included Diabetic Connect, a
for-profit organization, which was selected because of its
growing diabetes-specific social media presence. Facebook and
Twitter were also used for recruitment, given the number of
groups, pages, and tweet chats focused on diabetes. Data
collection occurred over a 7-month period.
Measures
The online survey was divided into 6 sections: (1) demographics,
(2) health history, (3) eHealth use (including reasons to join a
diabetes social network, DOC intensity, DOC engagement, and
internet social capital), (4) HRQoL, (5) diabetes self-care
behaviors, and (6) source credibility. Moreover, 5 validated
instruments were used and included the SF-12v2 [46,48], an
adapted version of the Facebook intensity scale [49], an adapted
version of the internet social capital scale [50], Self-Care
Inventory-Revised (SCI-R) [47], and the source credibility scale
[51]. This paper will examine demographics, health history,
eHealth use as noted below (that includes reasons to join a DOC,
DOC intensity, and DOC engagement, but does not include
internet social capital), HRQoL, and diabetes self-care behaviors.
Details for each measure are noted below.
Demographics
A total of 11 demographic items focused on gender, marital
status, education level, employment, annual household income,
age, ethnicity, race, country or state, living setting, and insurance
status.
Health History
A total of 8 self-reported items focused on diabetes type,
diabetes duration, current diabetes treatments, most recent HbA1c
level, type of medical practice, and type of healthcare provider
used for diabetes care, frequency of diabetes provider visits,
and presence of diabetes-related complications.
eHealth Use
A total of 22 items, individually scored, were asked to measure
how participants navigate the DOC and if the participants’
healthcare provider knew about and supported their DOC use.
Reasons to Join the Diabetes Online Community
A total of 13 items were developed based on an anecdotal dLife
(Diabetes Life) report [52] that addressed the reasons why
someone with diabetes should join the DOC. Items were
dichotomous, allowing a yes or no response.
Diabetes Online Community Intensity
The DOC intensity scale is an 8-item tool adapted from the
Facebook intensity scale [49] to measure how often and for how
long individuals are engaged in the DOC, and to determine the
emotional connectedness and integration into daily activities.
Scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more
DOC intensity. Cronbach coefficient for DOC intensity was
.85.
Diabetes Online Community Engagement
The DOC engagement scale is a 5-item tool developed by the
authors and informed by a qualitative analysis [36] to measure
engagement or interaction with other DOC users. Specifically,
this tool was used to measure whether or not participants shared
clinical information, requested or provided clinical guidance or
feedback, or received or provided emotional support. Scores
range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more DOC
engagement. Cronbach coefficient for DOC engagement was
.73.
Health-Related Quality of Life
SF12-v2 is a 12-item tool used to measure physical and mental
health status. A 4-week recall was used in this study. Norm
based scoring (mean 50, SD 10) was used for this analysis [46].
Cronbach coefficient for SF-12v2 was .88 (physical=.77 and
mental=.86).
Diabetes Self-Care
SCI-R is a 15-item tool used to measure diabetes self-care
behaviors and can accommodate natural variation in treatment
plans for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Scores range
from 0 to 100 [47]. Cronbach coefficient for the SCI-R was .68.
Analysis
In a survey study such as ours, precision of parameter estimation
is the key sample size criterion. We defined excellent precision
operationally as an 80% probability of obtaining 95% confidence
intervals for the mean, with half-width no greater than 0.15 SD.
This criterion provides interval estimation with symmetric
uncertainty that is smaller than Cohen familiar standard for a
“small” effect. Under the 2-sided t-distribution, a sample size
of 189 was required to meet this criterion, which conservatively
guided our recruitment of a sample of 207. The final sample of
183 participants successfully achieved an 80.5% probability of
95% CI precision limited to 0.151 SD units.
Survey responses were identified by a participant number code,
and all the study-related files were maintained in REDCap. Data
were screened for multiple entries. In accordance with standard

 scoring methods, missing data were imputed with appropriately
scaled item means in the calculation of total scores for the
validated scales. All other missing data were excluded pairwise.
Missing data made up less than 10% of each analysis. We
performed statistical analysis using SPSS 21 (IBM) [53] and
used exploratory data analysis to screen for errors, determine
frequencies, and identify normality of distribution patterns.
Cronbach alpha was calculated for each validated measure.
The primary goal was to gather detailed data on DOC users,
both demographically and in terms of intensity and engagement
in using the DOC, and to describe any relationship between
DOC use and health indicators (HRQoL, self-care, and HbA1c
levels). To address our first aim, we ran frequencies for each
demographic variable and used analysis of variance and
Chi-square tests to examine if there were differences in
demographic variables based on diabetes type. To address our
second aim, scores for DOC intensity and DOC engagement
were averaged. Analyses were conducted to determine
relationships between, and interactions among, demographic
variables, health history, eHealth use, DOC intensity, DOC
engagement, HRQoL, and diabetes self-care behaviors, to
address our third aim. This included correlations between DOC
intensity, DOC engagement, HRQoL, and diabetes-self-care,
as well as between the support participants received from their
healthcare providers related to their DOC use, DOC intensity,
and DOC engagement scores. A one sample t test was used to
compare the studied sample with norms for diabetes related to
health status [46] and diabetes self-care [47].
Variables that predicted the dichotomous outcome of HbA1c
<7% or ≥7%, based on the American Diabetes Association’s
recommendations for an HbA1c <7% [54], were examined in a
simultaneous model among DOC users. To explore this,
variables were analyzed based on researcher and DOC key
opinion leader knowledge of the DOC in an initial stepwise
logistic regression. Stepwise logistic regression allowed us to
refine the variables and to remove nonsignificant variables. We
then used a simultaneous logistic regression in the final
predictive model. For inference, alpha was set at .05.
Results
Recruitment
There were 1501 unique DOC site visitors who viewed the
online recruitment post and 207 unique participants who
completed the survey. Of those, 183 met the inclusion criteria,
giving us a recruitment rate of 12.2%. Table 1 shows participant
demographic data. Participants were more likely to be female,
white, living in the United States in a suburban setting, well
educated, employed, and to have type 1 diabetes. Participants
with type 1 diabetes were younger than those with type 2
diabetes (P<.001), or those with LADA (P=.002).
Health History
Most of the participants reported receiving care for their diabetes
at an endocrinology office (68.1%, 124/182), although those
with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be seen by a family
practice provider than those with type 1 diabetes (P<.001).
Participants saw their healthcare providers at least quarterly
(63.5%, 115/181) or every 6 months (23.8%, 43/181).
Participants had an average of 
1.2 
diabetes-related
complications; there was a positive correlation between number
of diabetes-related complications and diabetes duration (r=.369,
P<.001). Those with type 1 diabetes were more likely to report
depression (P=.01), heart disease (P=.01), and eye disease
(P<.001) than those with type 2 diabetes or LADA. Over half
(59.0%, 108/183) of individuals reported diabetes-related
complications. Most commonly reported diabetes-related
complications 
included 
depression 
(32%, 
59/183),
cardiovascular disease (27%, 49/183), retinopathy (21%,
38/183), and neuropathy (19%, 35/182). Diabetes treatments
varied, although majority of the participants were using intensive
insulin management (85%, 155/183). Of those undergoing
intensive insulin management, 54.8% (81/147) were using an
insulin pump, whereas 25.2% (37/147) were using a continuous
glucose monitor. Respondents with type 1 diabetes had a longer
diabetes duration than those with type 2 diabetes or LADA
(P<.001).
eHealth Use
Participants used an average of 2.6 devices to access the internet.
The majority (96.2%, 175/183) of participants spent their time
reading (91.3%, 167/183), responding (74.3%, 136/183), and
creating original posts (59.6%, 109/183). The time for which
participants had been using DOC ranged from less than 1 year
(32%, 58/183) to 1 to 3 years (37.7%, 69/183), or more than 3
years (30.4%, 56/183). The majority of respondents had not
told their healthcare providers about their DOC use (67.2%,
123/183). Of those who did tell their healthcare providers about
their DOC use, 60% (36/60) were supported to continue doing
so, 1.9% (3/183) were not supported, and 10.9% (20/183) were
not sure if their provider supported their use of the DOC.
Reasons to Join a Diabetes Online Community
A majority of the participants found participating in the DOC
beneficial as it related to knowledge attainment, support, and
empowerment; see Table 2. DOC users who found a benefit in
their participation with the DOC reported higher DOC intensity
and DOC engagement; see Table 3.

 Diabetes Online Community Intensity
The average DOC intensity scale score was 2.76 (SD .73) on a
scale of 0 to 5. There was a difference in the intensity with
which participants were using the DOC when comparing the 4
diabetes treatments (F3,177=3.5, P=.02). Respondents who were
on no medications (mean 3.1, SD 0.80) or on intensive insulin
management (mean 2.8, SD 0.71) had higher DOC intensity
scores when compared with those taking oral agents only (mean
2.3, SD 0.69). DOC intensity scores varied based on whether
or not DOC users had told their healthcare providers about their
DOC use, and if it was supported (F3,170=11.3, P<.001).
Specifically, DOC intensity scores were higher in those
participants who had told their healthcare providers about their
DOC use and felt supported (mean 3.2, SD 0.64) or were not
sure (mean 3.2, SD 0.57) than those who had never told their
healthcare providers about their DOC use at all (mean 2.6, SD
0.71). Type of diabetes or length of time using the DOC was
not associated with DOC intensity. DOC intensity and DOC
engagement were positively correlated (r=.572, P<.001).
Diabetes Online Community Engagement
The average DOC engagement score was 2.24 (SD 1.69) on a
scale of 0 to 5. DOC engagement scores were related to
healthcare provider knowledge and support of DOC use
(F3,170=11.0, P<.001). DOC engagement scores were higher for
those who had told their healthcare providers about their DOC
use and were unsure if they were supported (mean 2.9, SD 1.3)
or felt supported (mean 3.6, SD 1.4) than for those who had
never told their healthcare providers about their DOC use at all
(mean 1.9, SD 1.6). DOC engagement scores were higher the
longer someone had participated in the DOC. Those who had
participated in the DOC for 4 or more years (mean 2.86, SD
1.7) were more engaged than those who had participated for
less than 3 months (mean 1.50, SD 1.5, P<.001). There was no
difference in DOC engagement scores for those who were
insured or uninsured or by type of diabetes. Furthermore, there
was no correlation between DOC engagement and age, diabetes
type, or diabetes duration.
Health-Related Quality of Life
The SF-12v2 physical component summary mean score was
64.8 (SD 19) and the mental component mean summary score
was 66.57 (SD 21.1); both were higher (P<.001, one sample t
test) than previously reported physical component summary
norms of individuals with diabetes [46]. The SF-12v2 physical
component summary score negatively correlated with age
(r=−.177, P=.02). The physical component summary and mental
component summary were not related to diabetes type, DOC
engagement, and DOC intensity.
Diabetes Self-Care Behaviors
On average, DOC participants had high self-care scores (mean
72.4, SD 12.0) compared with mean scores found in other
samples of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (P<.001,
one-sample t test) [47]. Diabetes self-care behavior scores were
lower in those who reported depression (reported depression
mean 68.9, SD 13.8; reported no depression mean 74.1, SD
10.8, P=.007). There were positive correlations between
self-care scores and DOC engagement scores (r=.170, P=.02),
DOC intensity scores (r=.236, P=.002), and SF-12v2 mental
component summary scores (r=.301, P<.001). There was a
negative correlation between self-care scores and HbA1c
(r=−.157, P=.04). Correlation between diabetes self-care,
HRQoL, DOC intensity, and DOC engagement is noted in Table
4.
Glycated Hemoglobin A1c Levels and Predictors
The majority (59.6%, 109/183) of survey respondents reported
an HbA1c<7%. There was no difference in HbA1c levels between
US users and non-US users, insured and uninsured users, or
type of diabetes. After conducting an initial stepwise logistic
regression, the final predictive binary logistic regression model
(see Table 5) was employed to explain the HbA1c category of
<7% or ≥7% while controlling for all other variables in the
model. The odds ratio for age was significant, with every 1-year
increase in age yielding 34% reduction in the odds of having
an HbA1c≥7%. Diabetes duration generated a 1.46 odds ratio
of having an HbA1c≥7%. DOC engagement was a strong
predictor of HbA1c level; every single point increase in DOC
engagement yielded a 33.8% reduction in the odds of an
individual having an HbA1c≥7%. There was a 2.7 times increase
in the odds of having an HbA1c≥7% among participants who
reported that DOC helped them learn about strategies to improve
insurance coverage for diabetes-related medications, supplies,
and technology devices (coded yes or no).

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to explore who uses the DOC,
how they use it, and whether DOC use is associated with specific
health indicators. Below we discuss the significant findings that
support both the importance of the DOC for specific populations
with diabetes and the positive association of DOC use with
health indicators. We also discuss implications for clinical
practice.
Principal Findings
We found an overwhelming representation of type 1 diabetes
within this sample of DOC users, even though type 1 diabetes
makes up only 5% to 10% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes
[55]. This overrepresentation may be due to the fact that one of
our recruitment sites, TuDiabaetes, had mostly individuals with
type 1 diabetes using their website. An alternative explanation
is that individuals with type 1 diabetes must utilize intensive
insulin management techniques, whereas individuals with type
2 diabetes may not. Intensive insulin management may drive
an additional need for knowledge and support, leading patients
to DOC. Furthermore, those with type 1 diabetes have more
exposure to technology, given that they typically are diagnosed
much younger and typically use a glucometer. Those with type
1 diabetes in this sample were younger and potentially more
likely to use social media in general [56]. Finally, because there
are fewer individuals with type 1 diabetes compared with type
2 diabetes in the general population, those with type 1 diabetes
may not be able to connect with another person with their same
condition offline and this may lead them to seek others like
themselves online [2]. Diabetes research conducted in other
online communities, such as PatientsLikeMe, have found more
respondents with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that other factors
such as DOC site user characteristics and site purpose may
influence who participates [57]. There was no significant
difference between type of diabetes as it related to DOC
engagement or HbA1c.
The majority of the participants had not told their healthcare
providers about their DOC use. Although our findings support
the idea that DOC use is supplementary to, not in place of,
regular healthcare provider visits, research has shown that
healthcare providers may be hesitant to suggest DOC use due
to concerns about misinformation [58,59], fear of a power
imbalance from the traditional hierarchy of medicine [60,61],
or fear of a challenge to their authority [62]. It is important for
healthcare providers to be aware of the DOC and how
health-related social media is driving a more patient-centered
healthcare system [63,64] by putting the patient’s preferences
and values about how they want to receive healthcare front and
center [65], consistent with the eHealth-enhanced chronic care
model [66]. Furthermore, healthcare providers should be
learning how they can engage with DOC themselves while
supporting their patients with diabetes to use the DOC
[28,31,67]. If healthcare providers discuss and support DOC
use with their patients, patients may be encouraged to access
quality online diabetes self-care information and support. In
this way, the DOC could be a complementary resource for
information to support health literacy not found in the traditional
healthcare model.
DOC intensity varied by treatment. Those with no medications
or on intensive insulin management used DOC more intensely
than those on oral agents. This is perhaps due to the fact that
individuals on no medications may be accessing the DOC to
educate themselves with hopes of halting the progression of
their diabetes, whereas those on intensive insulin management
require more education, skills, and support to manage their
diabetes than those on oral agents only. Similar to other research,
our study found associations between intensity of DOC use and
feeling supported in disease management [68]. We did not find
differences in DOC intensity between insured and uninsured
participants; conversely, other research has shown that
individuals with chronic conditions who were uninsured were
more likely than those who were privately insured to be frequent
users of online health information [69].
Our research indicates that DOC users have higher HRQoL
when compared with HRQoL norms for the general population
[46]. Individuals who seek online health information report
being happier and healthier when compared with those who
seek offline health information [70]. DOC users can quickly
access health-related information they desire in multiple formats

 (ie, discussion board, blog, Tweetchat, etc), allowing them to
easily review crowdsourced information from individuals living
with diabetes, learn the same information in a variety of ways
[8] from different DOC users to address learning style
preferences, and focus on topics based on need and interest.
The ability to obtain health information from the DOC in
multiple ways supports a patient-centered approach to enhancing
health literacy. The DOC also provides an avenue for individuals
with diabetes to provide social support to one another. Social
support, which has been linked to HRQoL scores [71], allows
individuals to feel less alone in their diabetes. Individuals
reported a sense of social connectedness, which strongly predicts
altruism [72]. Altruism has been identified as a factor in
participating in chronic disease online communities [73-75],
which may enhance the social learning process.
This is the first study to demonstrate that engaging in the DOC
is associated with positive health benefits for people with
diabetes. DOC engagement is related to better glycemic levels,
diabetes self-care, and HRQoL. DOC engagement allows
individuals to share personal experiences, exchange emotional
support, and gain expertise in day-to-day management
techniques through crowdsourced information by peers.
Although it is important to note that directionality and causation
cannot be determined in this model, there is evidence to suggest
that DOC engagement may lead to improved HbA1c levels.
Individuals who have an HbA1c≥7% and longer diabetes duration
may be engaging in the DOC to connect with others due to
diabetes burnout. Furthermore, individuals who already had an
HbA1c≥7% may have sought support from the DOC to learn
strategies to improve insurance coverage of diabetes-related
expenses so they could in turn improve their diabetes
management. Longitudinal research is necessary to understand
glycemic levels as it relates to specifics of DOC use, such as
learning how to improve insurance coverage for diabetes-related
expenses.
Individuals with diabetes who are actively engaging in the DOC
are actively participating in their own healthcare. Patient
activation, known to decrease healthcare costs, is gauged by
knowledge, skills, and confidence one has to manage his or her
own health [76], which is associated with engagement in online
communities [77]. In this study, DOC engagement was
associated with increasing diabetes-related knowledge and skills,
self-care, and empowerment, supporting the notion of high
patient activation. Health literacy may also improve with
increased diabetes-related knowledge. Research has shown that
the interaction between patient activation and health literacy is
associated with better glycemic levels [78]. Furthermore,
patients who actively participate in medical decisions have
improved glycemic levels [79]. Additional research is needed
to distinctly identify how DOC impacts glycemic levels, patient
activation, and health literacy.
DOC engagement was higher for DOC users whose healthcare
providers supported them in their DOC use. Although it is
important to note that a causal inference cannot be made, this
finding has potential clinical implications in that DOC
engagement may supplement current diabetes care and lead to
improved glycemic levels. Participation in the DOC requires
no resource allocation from the current healthcare system,
although it is only available to those with internet access and a
sufficient level of health literacy to use it. Despite documented
benefits of face-to-face peer health [11-13,80], there are
currently no professional recommendations for individuals to
use peer health via the DOC to supplement their diabetes care.
Limitations
We recruited our sample from the DOC, and therefore, caution
must be exercised when generalizing because of the possibility
of bias due to sample self-selection. Individuals who responded
to the survey may be more engaged with the DOC or have better
glycemic levels. The majority of individuals in this sample
identified themselves as using intensive insulin management,
which does not reflect the treatment intensity seen in the general
population. We had a response rate of 12.2% based on the
number of times the study recruitment post was viewed by
unique site visitors. Although the recruitment percentage may
appear low, a response rate of <.1% is not unusual for online
surveys [81]. The respondents were overwhelmingly white,
college-educated females living in the United States, which may
not be an accurate reflection of the entire DOC population, and
is not an accurate reflection of the general population with
diabetes. For example, individuals who are American Indian or
Alaskan Native, black, and Hispanic are more likely to have
diabetes than those who are white [82]. Finally, this study only
looked at adult DOC users, and findings should not be
generalized to individuals with gestational diabetes, minors, or
caregivers participating in the DOC.
Self-reporting of HbA1c may affect reliability of data; however,
research that validated self-reported HbA1c with laboratory
values has shown that self-reported diabetes data are accurate
>92% of the time [83]. Similar HbA1c results have been found
among international DOC users, in which the average HbA1c
was 6.9% [84]. In addition, some DOC participants have been
found to share their HbA1c levels with others online [84], and
have gone as far as including a photograph of their lab record.
Transparency in sharing health information, as seen in recent
#wearenotwaiting and #OpenAPS movements on Twitter and
other social media sites [85], may improve reliability in
reporting, although we did not request HbA1c documentation
for this study.
The nature of this research cannot determine causality. We do
not know if the high DOC engagement results in high self-care
and optimal glycemic levels, or vice versa, or if common
unknown causal factors induce the association. Prospective
studies, specifically randomized control trials, are warranted to
better understand DOC and its impact on health outcomes.
Conclusions
Our study found that higher engagement with the DOC was
associated with HbA1c levels <7%, although we cannot
determine directionality of this relationship. We also found that
DOC users are generally proactive in diabetes self-care
behaviors and that there was a strong sense of community among
DOC participants. Participants found DOC peer health to be
beneficial with regard to knowledge attainment and support,

 factors known to enhance health literacy. Our survey indicated
that DOC users are often not informing their healthcare
providers about their participation with the DOC. Our findings
suggest that healthcare providers should be familiar with DOC
and ask their patients about use of online sources for diabetes
self-care information and support. Supplementing usual
healthcare activities with DOC use may encourage knowledge
and support among a population that can benefit greatly from
optimizing diabetes self-care. This study adds to the body of
knowledge in diabetes care and online communities for chronic
disease management. Further studies to determine how DOC
use affects health outcomes, and how health behaviors
contagiously spread throughout the DOC, would be enlightening.
