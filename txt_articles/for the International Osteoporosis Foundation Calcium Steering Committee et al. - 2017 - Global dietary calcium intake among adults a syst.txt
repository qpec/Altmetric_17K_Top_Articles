Abstract Low calcium intake may adversely affect bone
health in adults. Recognizing the presence of low calcium
intake is necessary to develop national strategies to optimize
intake. To highlight regions where calcium intake should be
improved, we systematically searched for the most represen-
tative national dietary calcium intake data in adults from the
general population in all countries. We searched 13 electron-
ic databases and requested data from domain experts.
Studies were double-screened for eligibility. Data were ex-
tracted into a standard form. We developed an interactive
global map, categorizing countries based on average calcium
intake and summarized differences in intake based on sex,
age, and socioeconomic status. Searches yielded 9780 ab-
stracts. Across the 74 countries with data, average national
dietary calcium intake ranges from 175 to 1233 mg/day.
Many countries in Asia have average dietary calcium intake
less than 500 mg/day. Countries in Africa and South
America mostly have low calcium intake between about
400 and 700 mg/day. Only Northern European countries
have national calcium intake greater than 1000 mg/day.
Survey data for three quarters of available countries were
not nationally representative. Average calcium intake is gen-
erally lower in women than men, but there are no clear
patterns across countries regarding relative calcium intake
by age, sex, or socioeconomic status. The global calcium
map reveals that many countries have low average calcium
intake. But recent, nationally representative data are mostly
lacking. This review draws attention to regions where mea-
sures to increase calcium intake are likely to have skeletal
benefits.

Introduction
Calcium intake is one of the many factors affecting the devel-
opment of peak bone mass and preservation of bone mass in
adults. Calcium is an important component of bone, account-
ing for about 30 to 35% of its mass and much of its strength.
The contribution of dietary calcium intake to bone mass is
easiest to document during periods when bone mass is chang-
ing rapidly, that is, during adolescence when the skeleton

 gains up to 409 g per year in boys and 325 g per year in girls
[1], and late in life when bone loss occurs at a rate of about 1%
per year, resulting in calcium loss of approximately 15 g per
year [2]. Low calcium intake in some populations may be
adversely affecting the development of peak bone mass in
adolescents and young adults and the retention of bone mass
in older adults. Recognizing the presence of low calcium in-
take is a necessary first step in developing culturally appropri-
ate strategies and policies to address the deficiency.
The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) took the
initiative to describe dietary calcium intake in the general adult
population in different countries based on a systematic review
and to present the data on a global map. This study follows on
a similar review and map of global vitamin D status conducted
in 2011 (https://www.iofbonehealth.org/facts-and-statistics/
vitamin-d-studies-map) [3]. The aim of the current review
was to find the most representative data for each country,
regarding average dietary intake of calcium in general
population adults. The available studies were used to
populate a color-coded global map of average dietary calcium
intake per country.
Methods
We used a systematic review approach to search for, select,
and analyze available studies, following, to the extent possi-
ble, Institute of Medicine guidance [4]. The protocol was
discussed and agreed upon with the Calcium Map Steering
Committee of the IOF. The research team (EMB, GPA,
VNL, AE) independently conducted the review. Preliminary
findings were presented at the World Congress on
Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, and Musculoskeletal Diseases
on March 24, 2017. Attendees were encouraged to inform
the team of any missing or erroneous studies.
Data sources
We searched 13 electronic databases that focus on medical,
nutrition, allied health, and global health literature. These in-
cluded PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CAB Abstracts, Global
Health, Academic Search Premier, Africa-Wide Information,
American Bibliography of Slavic and East European Studies,
Anthropology Plus, Bibliography of Asian Studies,
Environment Index, Humanities & Social Sciences Index
Retrospective, SocINDEX, and LILACS. The searches were
conducted on December 16, 2016, and included terms for
calcium, micronutrients, dairy, and other calcium-rich food-
stuffs; nutrition, health, diet, and food surveys, food frequency
questionnaires, and food records; and lists of 154 countries
and 158 known national or regional food surveys (Electronic
supplementary material—Appendix A). In databases that
allowed it, searches were restricted to primary studies or
systematic reviews of humans and adults. From relevant re-
views and selected primary studies, we searched for additional
studies in reference lists. We also conducted web-based
searches for national dietary surveys in general and specific
named surveys where we had basic information. We also re-
quested known studies from domain experts in the IOF. One
author was contacted to help obtain data alluded to in her
publication [5]. Data for India and Gambia were obtained
for us by an IOF member from the survey researchers directly
(Varghese JS et al., Daily adult calcium intake in Indian states
based on the NSSO (2012) data, personal communication;
Ward K. Gambia. Medical Research Council Lifecourse
Epidemiology, University of Southampton, UK. Funded by
the Nutrition and Bone Health Research Programme,
Medical Research Council (MRC) Elsie Widdowson
Laboratory, Cambridge, UK, personal communication).
Study selection
Four researchers screened abstracts and full-text articles in
duplicate. Screening was conducted in two phases. The first
phase aimed to find all potentially relevant articles. The sec-
ond phase selected the one or two most representative studies
for each country. To select studies, we formulated an ideal set
of eligibility criteria and included the studies that best matched
these criteria. For countries that did not have ideal data, we
included less representative studies. The ideal eligibility
criteria were national (or regional) surveys (designed to be
nationally representative) of general population adults (≥
18 years old) that reported average dietary calcium intake
(excluding supplement intake) in milligrams per day or equiv-
alent, surveyed since 2010. Ideally, studies also reported sub-
group analyses based on sex, age, and socioeconomic status.
For countries that lacked such studies, we allowed nonnational
(e.g., city-level) studies and studies of selective populations
(e.g., by age or sex). In addition, when necessary, we allowed
studies that included children or calcium supplement intake.
When studies were not nationally representative, we allowed
multiple studies from a single country if the studies were com-
plementary (e.g., represented different regions or age ranges).
We excluded studies that were restricted to children, insti-
tutionalized adults or those with comorbidities (e.g., studies of
nursing home residents or those with osteoporosis or diabe-
tes), lactating or pregnant women, or if study participants had
to undergo imaging testing (e.g., bone mineral density or cor-
onary calcium testing). We also excluded studies that reported
only normalized calcium intake, intake in terms of recom-
mended daily allowance (or equivalent), that estimated avail-
able dietary calcium (e.g., based on food market surveys), or
that reported calcium intake only from selected foodstuffs
(e.g., dairy, fruit).
After the full list of potentially relevant studies was collect-
ed, we extracted basic study data from the abstracts including
3316

 country, specific location (e.g., if limited to a city), survey
name, survey year, sample size, subpopulation data if relevant
(e.g., age limitation), and whether subgroup analyses were
reported. Based on these data, full-text articles were iteratively
retrieved starting with the studies that most closely met ideal
eligibility criteria (i.e., that were most representative and re-
cent). Full-text articles were screened to ensure studies met
eligibility criteria. Multicountry studies (e.g., EPIC) were
evaluated separately for each included country.
Data extraction
Data were extracted from eligible studies by one researcher
and confirmed by a second. We extracted data regarding the
publication, country, study location (e.g., city name), survey
used and years of survey, methodology for estimation of die-
tary calcium intake, study eligibility criteria, participant char-
acteristics (age, sex, body mass index), whether children or
supplement intake were included, sample size, average esti-
mated dietary calcium intake data, and pertinent subgroup
data. Studies were categorized as either nationally representa-
tive of current dietary calcium intake (without supplements)
among general population adults or not. For countries with
multiple estimates of calcium intake (either within study by
subgroup, e.g., by sex, or across studies), we determined
weighted averages by sample size (or simple averages if sam-
ple sizes were not reported) to calculate a single average intake
per country. Countries were categorized across the range of
average calcium intake. Within-study comparisons of sub-
groups were evaluated and compared across studies.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the
report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data
in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to
submit for publication.
Results
The literature searches yielded 9780 abstracts after
deduplication, of which 443 articles were deemed potentially
relevant. Data from two additional nutrition surveys were also
included. Our final dataset included 78 eligible studies cover-
ing 74 countries (Fig. 1). See Electronic supplementary mate-
rial—Appendix C for the full reference list. The most com-
mon reasons studies were rejected were a lack of reported
calcium data, less restrictive studies available, more recent
data available, and other similar reasons. A full list of exclud-
ed studies, with rejection reasons, is available in the Electronic
supplementary material—Appendix B.
Across the 74 countries with data, the best estimate of
average dietary calcium intake among general population
adults ranged from 175 mg/day (Nepal) to 1233 mg/day
(Iceland) (Table 1). The most notable patterns internationally
were that most countries in South, East, and Southeast Asia
have low average dietary calcium intake, less than 400 to
500 mg/day (Fig. 2). Most countries with data in Africa and
South America have moderately low average dietary calcium
intake between about 400 and 700 mg/day. However, many
countries in Africa, Central and South America, the Middle
East, and Central Asia did not have available estimates. All
countries with average dietary calcium intake greater than
1000 mg/day were in Northern Europe.
However, for only 18 of the 74 countries (24%) were the
estimates of dietary calcium intake current (since 2000) and
nationally representative (Table 1). Thirteen (of 78) study sur-
veys (17%) were conducted since 2010, 49 studies (63%)
mostly between 2000 and 2010, 12 studies (15%) mostly prior
to 2000, and four other studies (5%) conducted their surveys
at some unreported date prior to about 2004 to 2012. Study
sample sizes ranged from 32 to 306,329, with 25 studies
(32%) having fewer than 1000 participants, but 18 studies
(23%) with more than 10,000; three studies did not provide
sample sizes. At least 27 of the studies (35%) were conducted
in specific towns, cities, or regions, but many studies did not
report where surveys were conducted. Thirty studies (38%)
included all adults (age 15 years and older), while six studies
(8%) included children, and 39 studies (50%) included a lim-
ited range of adults. Among 28 studies that reported data on
sex, the median study included 59% women (range 49.6–
100%), but five were restricted to women. Six studies were
conducted at the household (instead of individual) level. Also
of note, for two countries with high average calcium intake
(Finland and Iceland), the studies explicitly included supple-
ment intake in their estimates; however, for most countries, it
was only implied that supplement intake was not included.
Among the studies that reported subgroup analyses based
on sex, age, or urban versus rural residence, there were no
clear patterns across countries (Table 1). In the 42 countries
that had subgroup data by sex, the median calcium intake ratio
between women and men was 0.90 (range 0.65, 1.18); in 36
(86%) countries, women’s intake was lower than men’s.
However, the countries with relatively low calcium intake
ratios (< 0.80) or with greater intake among women did not
fall into any geographic or cultural groupings. In two thirds of
countries with reported subgroup estimates by age (N = 21),
older people consume less dietary calcium, with no discern-
able patterns across countries. In five of seven mostly low-
resource countries, rural residents had lower dietary calcium
intake than urban residents. In South Korea, people with
worse food sufficiency had lower calcium intake than others,
but in Brazil, average dietary calcium intake was similar
across income groups.

 Discussion
In summary, data on dietary calcium intake were available for
74 countries. However, many of the studies were not nation-
ally representative of general population adults, with about
40% of countries having only small sample size or local re-
gion data available. Most surveyed countries in South, East,
and Southeast Asia have low dietary calcium intake (<
400 mg/day). Most surveyed countries in Africa and South
America have moderately low calcium intake (400–700 mg/
day). The countries with mean calcium intake greater than
1000 mg/day were all in Northern Europe. Subgroup analyses
comparing sexes, ages, and urban versus rural populations did
not reveal any consistent patterns across countries.
Review of the global calcium map reveals that there are
many countries in which calcium intake is very low, under
400 mg/day. The countries with very low calcium intake are
clustered in the Asia-Pacific region and include countries with
large populations such as China, India, Indonesia, and
Vietnam, among others. Countries in the next lowest intake
categories, 400 to 500 and 500 to 600 mg/day, are clustered in
South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil) and scattered
throughout the Far East, North Africa, and elsewhere. Of the
total of 195 countries, we could identify calcium intake data
for only 74 or 38%. This leaves 123 countries without quali-
fying survey data on calcium intake.
Asia-Pacific countries with very low calcium intakes also
have suboptimal vitamin D status. In 2012, the IOF published
results of a systematic review conducted by the Mannheim
Institute describing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
[25(OH)D] around the globe [3]. Among adults age 18 years
and older in most Asia-Pacific countries, mean serum
25(OH)D levels were in the range of 25–49 nmol/L, which
is considered insufficient by the Institute of Medicine, at least
for the US general population [6]. The combination of low
calcium intake and low 25(OH)D levels is of particular con-
cern because it is known to increase the risk of osteoporosis. In
older adults, for instance, supplementation with calcium in
combination with vitamin D reduces bone loss [7], reduces
the risk of any fracture [7–9], and specifically reduces the risk
of hip fracture [8, 9]. In much of the Asia-Pacific region where
calcium intake is low, serum 25(OH)D levels also are low [3].
This is notable in China, Malaysia, and India, and also in
South Korea where serum 25(OH)D levels are generally in
the range of 25–49 ng/mL (Table 1).
While the implications of low calcium intake for bone mass
have not been systematically evaluated in many countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, they have in South Korea. In South
Korean adults aged 50 years and older in the 2009–2010
Korean National Health and Examination Survey
(KNHANES), Joo et al. examined associations of quintiles
of calcium intake with bone mineral density (BMD) within
three categories of serum 25(OH)D levels: < 50, 50–75, and >
75 nmol/L [10]. Within each category of serum 25(OH)D,
higher calcium intake was significantly positively associated
with BMD of the femoral neck. Within the lower two
25(OH)D categories, calcium intake was positively associated
with BMD of the spine. These observations in older adults
indicate not only that low calcium intake is associated with
lower BMD but also that higher 25(OH)D levels do not

i Two complementary studies were included for these countries. Relevant data are reported for each study, separated by a forward slash, with the larger study reported first. Where only a single value is
presented, the data were the same for both studies, except for calcium intake (which is an average across studies) and whether the studies are nationally representative (which is assessed across studies)

 compensate for an inadequate calcium intake. The mean cal-
cium intake of the older adults was 485 mg/day, and the top
quintile consumed at least 666 mg/day. The Korean RDA for
calcium for adults age 50 years and older is 700 mg/day [11].
Clearly over 80% of the older segment of the South Korean
population has calcium intake below their RDA. The positive
associations of bone mass with calcium intake strongly sug-
gest that a higher calcium intake would improve bone mass in
older South Korean adults.
Our goal was to summarize current, representative esti-
mates of dietary calcium intake in adults. However, few coun-
tries provided such data. Most studies were not nationally
representative or were based on old surveys. Numerous stud-
ies had other deficiencies, particularly incomplete reporting of
sample size, study eligibility criteria, survey dates, and basic
demographic information. Moreover calcium intake was
assessed by different methodologies, including food frequen-
cy questionnaires, recall, and diet records, which have well-
recognized differences and limitations [12]. For most
countries, future, representative, national nutrition surveys
are needed to better estimate dietary calcium intake. Notably,
we failed to find data for over half the world’s nations, partic-
ularly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Our methodolo-
gy called for selecting the most representative data for each
country; we did not attempt to summarize all available evi-
dence for all countries. Despite clear a priori eligibility criteria,
judgments had to be made regarding whether specific studies
or articles were less representative than others; for example,
whether to choose older, larger studies or newer, smaller stud-
ies with a broader eligible age range.
Hip fractures are projected to increase from 1.66 million in
1990 to 6.26 million by 2050 [13]. Europe and North America
accounted for about half of all hip fractures in 1990, and this
proportion will fall to one quarter in 2050, due to steep in-
creases in reported hip fractures in Asia and South America
[13]. Steep increases in Beijing, China, have recently been
confirmed [14]. Among adults age 70 years and older, hip
fracture rates have increased more than threefold in women

country with available data is colored based on its estimate of mean or
median dietary calcium intake. Bright red < 400 mg/day, dark red 400–
499 mg/day, orange 500–599 mg/day, brown 600–699 mg/day, yellow

 and twofold in men in the short interval between 1990–1992
and 2002–2006 [14]. Although several dietary, lifestyle, and
genetic factors influence hip fracture risk, inadequate calcium
intake appears to amplify this risk. To the extent that the cur-
rent very low calcium intake in Asia-Pacific region and South
America adversely affects the skeleton, it becomes a public
health priority to increase calcium intake to combat the dis-
abling, growing, and costly problem of osteoporosis in these
regions.
In conclusion, this systematic review compiled available
data on average national dietary calcium intake around the
globe. The key findings are that calcium intake is low (aver-
aging less than 400 mg/day) in many large countries of
Southeast Asia and nearly as low in much of South
America. Calcium intake has not been reported in over
half of the world’s countries. This work draws attention
to regions where calcium intake needs to be assessed and
where measures to increase calcium intake are likely to
have skeletal benefits.
