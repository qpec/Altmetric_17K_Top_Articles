Background: Italy has experienced a resurgence in measles since 2015. Although much emphasis has been placed
on the role of individuals opting out of vaccination, here we test the hypothesis that large budget reductions in
public health spending were also a contributing factor. Methods: Multi-variate statistical models were used to
assess the relationship between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) coverage and real public health expenditure
per-capita across Italy’s 20 regions covering the period 2000–14. Results: Between 2010 and 2014 Italy’s public
health expenditure fell by over 2%, although varying among regions. Fixed effects models estimate that each
1% reduction in per-capita public health expenditure was associated with a decrease of 0.5 percentage points
(95% CI: 0.36–0.65 percentage points) in MMR coverage, after adjusting for time and regional-specific time trends.
The consequences can be illustrated by comparing two regions, Lazio, where public health spending fell by 5%
and MMR coverage by over 3 percentage points, and Sardinia, a historically deprived region, where public health
spending partly rose and MMR rates remained approximately steady. Conclusion: Adoption of austerity policies in
the Italian health system was found to be significantly associated with declining vaccination rates for MMR.
However, the recent introduction of mandatory vaccination for Italian children may help counteract this trend.

Introduction
T
he adoption of austerity measures in Europe in recent years has,
in several cases, impacted adversely on health protection, an area
that has often been poorly funded even when economies are
performing well.1 These measures have been linked to several
health damaging effects including suicides,2,3 increase in unmet
needs4 and disease outbreaks that have disproportionally affected
vulnerable
groups.5
Examples
from
the
most
recent
global
financial crisis include malaria in Greece and HIV in Greece and
in Romania,1,6 while, in earlier economic crises, cuts in public health
expenditure were linked to outbreaks of diphtheria,5 leptospirosis7
and tuberculosis.8
Several European countries have been experiencing declining vacci-
nation rates and resurgences in measles incidence rates. In 2017 there
were over 14 000 incident cases across Europe and 30 fatalities,
including 19 in Romania, four in Italy, one in Bulgaria, Germany,
Portugal, France and Spain.9,10 Italy has been especially badly affected,
with 5004 cases, the second largest number in Europe in 2017.11–13
The primary reason for the outbreak is declining uptake of
measles vaccination, creating large pockets of measles-susceptible
individuals. In Italy, of the incident cases, 88% were never
vaccinated and 6% received only one of the two required doses of
measles vaccine.14 Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine
coverage is currently below the 95% vaccine coverage target that
was set by National Immunization Prevention Plan in 2012 to
achieve herd immunity.15
There has been widespread debate about how best to respond.
Attention has focused on adults who have opted to refuse vaccin-
ation for their children (so-called ‘vaccine hesitancy’).16 Paolo
Gentiloni, the Italian prime minister during the 2017 outbreak,
e.g. blamed the return of measles on the ‘spread of anti-scientific
theories’. In response, the Italian government implemented a
mandatory vaccination policy in 2017. Under the new regime, all
children under 16 years are required to have proof of vaccination
against 10 common infectious diseases, including measles, prior to
enrolment in public schools.
Although, undoubtedly, anti-scientific theories play a crucial role
in the potential emergence of new outbreaks, it has been observed
that these are more prominent among more affluent households and
in the wealthier northern Italian regions.17 Yet the increase in
measles has been concentrated in more deprived regions and hard
to reach populations, suggesting that other factors also came into
play.18–20 Thus, another view links recent outbreaks to minorities, in
particular in Lazio, which experienced one-third of all Italian cases
in 2017, where some have drawn connections to the high concen-
tration of Romanian migrants in the region.21,22 This view seemed to
be supported by evidence from the outbreaks in 2006 and 2015/16 in
the northern regions, the richest part of the country, which were
concentrated
among
Roma
and
migrants,19
although
those
communities were not especially affected in the 2017 outbreak. In
fact, in 2017, 7% of cases occurred in healthcare settings and adults,
rather than children, appear to have been most affected.22
A further possible factor is the impact of the economic situation
on public health capacity. In November 2011, the government
reduced the health budget by E7.5 million and introduced co-
payments for visits to specialists. The healthcare budget was
reduced by E900 million in 2012, a cut of slightly under 1% in a
budget that had previously been growing steadily, with a further cut
of E1.8 billion in 2013, and then E2 billion more in 2014.23 These

 cuts affected a range of services including prevention programmes,
pharmaceuticals, staff and equipment.24 Unfortunately it is not
possible to isolate specific budget lines in publicly available data;
however, official government reports from 2013 to 2014 note that
vaccine expenditure dropped by about 10% in this period.25
The objective of this study is thus to assess whether austerity in
the health sector might have impacted adversely on MMR coverage
in Italy.
Methods
Data sources
To assess the association between MMR coverage and public health
expenditure per-capita, two distinct data sources were linked. The
first comprises MMR coverage rates at 24months of age, so consider-
ing the first vaccine dose only, derived from data supplied by the
Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita
`, ISS)
for Italy’s 19 regions covering the period 2000–14. The independent
province of Trento was considered but Bolzano was excluded from the
main analyses because of characteristics that make it an extreme outlier
in Italy. This German-speaking province has very low levels of MMR
coverage reported (68.8% vs. the Italian average of 85.3%) despite
being very wealthy. However, as noted below, it was included subse-
quently in a series of robustness checks. For the purposes of analysis,
we classify the province of Trento as a region for coherence, giving 20
regions in total (Trento and 19 standard regions).
The second dataset provides information on the per-capita annual
public health expenditure for the 20 regions, covering the same
period, extracted from ‘Health for All’ a database periodically
released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics based on a
WHO platform.26 The public health expenditure was adjusted for
inflation using Purchasing Power Parity at 2010 constant prices.
Hence we now use the term real public health expenditure.
Supplementary Web Appendix table A1 in the Web Appendix 1
provides further details.
Statistical models
The association between real per-capita public health expenditure
and MMR coverage at regional level is analyzed using the following
equation:
MMRit ¼ � þ �logðexpitÞ þ �yeart þ �regioni � yeart þ �it
where i is the region, t is the year, MMR is the annual coverage level
expressed in percentage, EXP represents the real public health expend-
iture per-capita and � represents a random error term. The model
includes year and region-specific time trends which should account
for the strength of the anti-vaccination movement at regional level.
The coefficient of interest in this model is �, which represents the
percentage change in MMR coverage associated with a percentage
point change in the real public health expenditure. To test whether
our results were driven by potential unobserved heterogeneity we
used a within-group estimation. We clustered the standard error by
region to reflect non-independent sampling. All models were
estimated using STATA version 15.
Results
Figure 1 shows that the rising trend in real public health expenditure
per-capita reversed, starting from 2010. It should be noted that, until
then, it was growing rapidly, at a yearly average of 3.51% from 2000
to 2009 but then it reversed its trend and dropped by about 2%
between 2010 and 2014.
These aggregate figures do, however, mask regional variations.
In nine regions, real public health spending rose in some years
(Liguria, Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Lazio, Puglia, Calabria,
Sardinia, Tuscany). In contrast, the greatest reductions were
observed
in
the
Southern,
more
deprived,
regions
such
as
Basilicata and Molise, which experienced declines of over 10%.
Prior to these reductions, MMR coverage was slowly rising, from
74.1% in 2000 to 90.6% in 2012 (90%) (figure 1). After this period,
and coinciding with the introduction of austerity measures, coverage
levels fell to 85.1% in 2014. Between 2010 and 2013, in particular,
those three regions experiencing the largest drop in MMR coverage
(>3%) within the study period were also the ones experiencing the
largest financial cuts (Friuli Venezia Giulia—3.39%, Marche—
3.59% and Valle d’Aosta—6.89%) (figure 2).
Figure 3 depicts the estimates from a series of statistical models
(full results are reported in Supplementary Web Appendix table A2).
Our unadjusted model estimates that each 1% increase in real public
health expenditure was associated with a significant increase in
MMR coverage of 0.29 percentage points (95% CI: 0.19–0.40
percentage points). After controlling for regional fixed effects, to
address time-consistent variations in surveillance and health infra-
structure, the corresponding figure increased to 0.53 percentage points
(95% CI: 0.37–0.69 percentage points). Similarly, when correcting for
regional time trends, every 1% increase in real public health
expenditure per-capita (corresponding to an average of E17 per-
capita) was associated with an increase of 0.50 percentage points in
MMR coverage (95% CI: 0.36–0.65 percentage points).
These associations are consistent with the observed regional
pattern of measles resurgence. The largest outbreak in Italy was in
Lazio, which includes Rome. There, a drop of about 5% in real
public health expenditure spending per-capita was associated with
a drop of about 2.5% points in MMR coverage. The second largest
outbreak was in Piemonte, in the north, also characterized by a drop
of over 5% in real public health expenditure per-capita, which
experienced
a
drop
of
3%
points
in
the
MMR
coverage.
Interestingly, even in the richer northern regions, the largest
declines in MMR coverage appear to coincide with the largest falls

 in per-capita health expenditure. Examples include Valle d’Aosta,
where a fall of more than 6% in spending was associated with a
reduction in MMR coverage of more than 11 percentage points and
Friuli Venezia Giulia, where per-capita health expenditure fell by over
3%, with a reduction in MMR coverage of about 6.65 percentage points.
Sicily and Sardinia provide a marked contrast to this overall
picture. Our data show that Sardinia increased immunization
coverage by about 3.8 percentage points and Sicily by about 1.40
percentage points over the period 2010–13. For historical reasons,
these two regions, together with Trentino Alto Adige (i.e. Trento and
Bolzano), Valle d’Aosta, and Friuli Venezia Giulia, enjoy greater
autonomy under the Italian constitution. Sicily and Sardinia are
also considered among the most proactive in Italy in terms of im-
munization policies. The former was the first to introduce varicella
immunization in 2003 and the latter was one of the first regions to
comply with the 2012–14 National Immunization Plan.27–29 During
the period covered by the present analyses, Sardinia managed to
increase its budget by a yearly average of 3%, and after 2008 by
about 2%, the largest rise among all the regions since the
beginning of the Great Recession.
Robustness checks
We conducted a series of robustness checks to the model specifica-
tion. First, as the outbreaks can be non-linear, we replicated our
results using log–log functions, finding consistent patterns (see
Supplementary Web Appendix tables A2 and A3). Second, we
added the German-speaking province of Bolzano However, none
of the main results was qualitatively changed, although the coeffi-
cient estimates were slightly attenuated.
Discussion
Our analysis suggests that austerity measures adopted in Italy
contributed significantly to the resurgence of measles. We estimated
that each 1% reduction in real public health expenditure per-capita
corresponded to a 0.5 percentage points reduction in MMR coverage.
In the worst affected regions, which faced up to 5% cuts, this would
equate to a 2.5 percentage point fall in coverage. This result is in line
with previous studies relating declining pattern in vaccination coverage
with economic factors such as poverty,30 perceived distance to
clinics,31 low family income32–34 and lack of health insurance.35–37
Before analyzing potential implications for policy and research, we
must note several limitations of our analysis. First, our study did not
evaluate infections, but vaccination rates. There is little doubt that
the primary risk factor for measles outbreaks is declining vaccination
coverage levels and the population inability to achieve herd
immunity rates of 95%. Ideally, we would have liked to further
evaluate the impact of reductions in public health expenditures on
measles hospitalization and incidence rates. Unfortunately, this
would have required a surveillance system with linked data, which

 are not currently available. Second, our data do not allow us to
control for all potential relevant variables and we acknowledge this
limitation to our analysis. Third, although fine-grained data on
budgets for infectious diseases are available for some regions and
years, these are neither routinely recorded nor comparable over time
and regions and, thus, have not been used in the current analysis.
Moreover, given that even aggregate figures are available only up to
2014, we have not been able to examine the very recent measles
outbreak that occurred in Italy in 2017 and produced over 5000
cases among, mostly, unvaccinated individuals. Fourth, the Italian
healthcare system is regionally devolved, so that, even though it is a
National Health Service, the regions are responsible for financing,
planning
and
implementing
healthcare
services.
This
creates
diversity across the regions, especially among those five regions
that receive greater funding because, historically, were more
disadvantaged (specifically, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino Alto
Adige, Sicily, Sardinia and Valle d’Aosta). Fifth, although we
excluded the province of Bolzano a priori because of its specific
characteristics, including its extremely low MMR coverage rate, we
concede that its data are inconsistent with our finding that public
health expenditure is positively correlated with MMR coverage.
However, when we run robustness checks to test whether its
inclusion affects our overall findings, we find that it does not.
Notwithstanding
these
limitations,
our
observations
can
contribute to understanding the regional patterning of declining
measles vaccination coverage in Italy. Importantly, the declines
were concentrated neither in the most deprived nor most affluent
regions, but in those which experienced the greatest reductions in
the real public health expenditure. Thus, even though Sardinia is one
of the poorest regions, it increased in some years real public health
expenditure per-capita while Italy as a whole was implementing
austerity and it did not experience significant measles outbreaks.
In March 2017, WHO expressed concern about the measles
outbreaks affecting Europe, despite the availability of a safe,
effective vaccine.38 In this context, a new law adopted in Italy jn
July of that year offers lessons for elsewhere.39 This law made vac-
cination mandatory for children entering public primary schools.
However, this has been highly controversial and those opposing
vaccination in the Province of Bolzano seek to avoid it through
private schooling or crossing borders to Austria and other neigh-
bouring countries. It is still too early to know whether the new
immunization plan will be effective. However, early signs are
promising, with coverage data presented at the end of December
2017 estimating a national increase from 87.9 to 92.2% at
36 months of age.
The Italian changes have echoes in other European countries. In
Germany, while parents have had to show proof that they have
received counselling on vaccination before their children can enter
kindergarten for the past three years, a recently proposed law would
make it mandatory for all kindergartens to notify the health
authorities if parents have not submitted such proof. After the intro-
duction of mandatory vaccination in Italy, the French Prime,
Minister, E
´douard Philippe, stated that ‘it was unacceptable that
children are still dying of measles in the country where some of
the earliest vaccines were pioneered’.40 Currently, diphtheria,
tetanus and polio vaccines are mandatory in France. However,
the government made eight additional vaccines mandatory from
1 January 2018: whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella,
hepatitis B, influenza, pneumonia and meningitis C.
The most recent Italian budget will increase health expenditure by
1.3% per year in the years 2018–20, which will create fiscal space for
investing in infectious disease prevention. However, whether this
will be enough to reverse the decline in vaccination coverage
remains to be seen, as it remains less than the predicted increase
in GDP.
In conclusion, these findings highlight the risks of disinvestment
in public health services. Italy is now addressing its low vaccination
rate, by a combination of legislation and budgetary increases. It will
be important to monitor these developments, not only to inform
policy in Italy but across Europe where many countries now face
similar problems.

Key points
� Italy is experiencing a resurgence in measles, primarily
arising from declining vaccination rates.
� Using statistical models across Italy’s region, we found evidence
that declines in routine vaccination rates correspond to
reductions in health expenditure.
