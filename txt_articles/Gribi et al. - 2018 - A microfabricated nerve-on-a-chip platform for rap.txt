Peripheral nerves are anisotropic and heterogeneous neural tissues. Their complex physiol-
ogy restricts realistic in vitro models, and high resolution and selective probing of axonal
activity. Here, we present a nerve-on-a-chip platform that enables rapid extracellular
recording and axonal tracking of action potentials collected from tens of myelinated fibers.
The platform consists of microfabricated stimulation and recording microchannel electrode
arrays. First, we identify conduction velocities of action potentials traveling through the
microchannel and propose a robust data-sorting algorithm using velocity selective recording.
We optimize channel geometry and electrode spacing to enhance the algorithm reliability.
Second, we demonstrate selective heat-induced neuro-inhibition of peripheral nerve activity
upon local illumination of a conjugated polymer (P3HT) blended with a fullerene derivative
(PCBM) coated on the floor of the microchannel. We demonstrate the nerve-on-a-chip
platform is a versatile tool to optimize the design of implantable peripheral nerve interfaces
and test selective neuromodulation techniques ex vivo.

ince the first recording of propagating intracellular action
potential along a nerve fiber by Hodgkin and Huxley1,
electrophysiology has become a leading technique to study
and control properties and functions of neurons, both in vitro1–4
and in vivo5–12.
Assessing peripheral nerve function is challenging given the
anisotropic nature of peripheral nerves. They spread throughout
the body and vary significantly in diameter from sub-millimeter
up to centimeter. Within each nerve, there are hundreds to
thousands of axons, which vary in diameter (1–20 µm), degree of
myelination, velocity of signal propagation (0.1–120 ms–1), and
direction of propagation (afferent vs efferent fibers). In myeli-
nated fibers, these signals are concentrated at the nodes of Ran-
vier and their electrical potential dissipates in the low-resistance,
extracellular space. In addition, the morphology and the pheno-
type of the nerve fibers influence their response to physical or
biochemical perturbation. In vivo, electrodes are implanted either
around or into the nerve to record extracellular signals. The
ability to differentiate fibers and measure potential disruption in
signal conduction is restricted by the necessary trade-off between
implant invasiveness and selectivity13. Consequently, monitoring
neural activity in a healthy peripheral nerve or following trauma,
disease, chronic conditions, or drug exposure is an intricate
mission.
Recent nerve-on-a-chip models have been developed to break
down the complexity found in vivo, using in vitro neuronal
cultures14–19 or ex vivo explanted nerves20–27. In vitro extra-
cellular recording interfaces are manufactured using micro-
fabrication to ensure repeatability and enable statistically relevant
sample sizes14–19. They consist of planar microelectrode arrays
(MEAs)14–16 or microchannel electrodes26,28–31 that combine
axonal guidance with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) recordings.
High-density complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor MEA
combined with built-in microfluidic channel can help detecting
complex signals along individual axons, at subcellular resolu-
tion16,32. In vitro neural cultures reach maturation after several
weeks and support homogeneous population of neurons. In two-
dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems,
axons usually grow up to a few millimeters length14–19. Although
myelination can be induced under specific, appropriately timed
culture conditions14,18,19, standard culture techniques produce
unmyelinated, thin ( < 3 µm diameter) axons, with resulting
conduction velocities below 2 ms–115–17. Seeding neurons in 3D
scaffolds can lead to the formation of aligned fibers mimicking
nerve structure17,19. In this configuration, neural activity, usually
compound action potentials (CAPs), is visualized using Ca2+
imaging18,19 or acquired with electrodes positioned by hand with
micromanipulators17. Recording of single-fiber action potentials
(SFAPs) remains to be achieved.
Ex vivo nerve models enable probing of explanted nerves
carrying cm-long myelinated fibers. Stimulation and recording
from explanted tissue are usually performed in custom-made
electrode set-ups20–27 involving micromanipulators, hook elec-
trodes, insulating oil baths25, or cuff-electrodes24,28. Alternatively,
penetrating or suction electrodes may be used27,28. The resulting
SNR typically allow the detection of multiple SFPA composing
CAP21 and conduction velocity computation but these experi-
mental techniques are cumbersome and time consuming.
Although each of the aforementioned approaches has its
merits, none enables systematic monitoring and quantification of
neural activity from heterogeneous ensembles of nerve fibers,
reflecting in vivo anatomy and transduction. Here, we introduce
an ex vivo platform that integrates a realistic 3D nerve model with
precise stimulation and high-resolution recordings of neural
signals (SFAP, multi-unit action potentials (MUAPs) and CAP)
and computation of conduction velocity. The nerve-on-a-chip
platform hosts microfabricated microchannel electrodes on glass
wafer allowing for precise and reproducible layout of the
microelectrodes,
and
rapid
and
consistent
positioning
of
explanted nerve root threads through the micro-conduits, which
enhances the recordings throughput from excised tissue. The
electrode design enables high SNR extracellular recordings with
controlled spatial and temporal registration leading to measures
of neural signal amplitude, density, and velocity.
We exploit the nerve-on-a-chip platform as an efficient design
tool for neuroprosthetic research focusing on implants for nerve
regeneration and peripheral nerve cuffs. Regenerative micro-
channel implants offer a fascicular-like design with tens of par-
allel micro-conduits that support peripheral nerve regeneration
and embed microelectrodes that communicate with the regener-
ated axons10,33–36, whereas the microchannel design amplifies the
extracellular neural signal amplitude26,28. SFAP are recordable in
microchannel as short as 4 mm34, whereas nerve fibers can
regenerate in vivo up to 6 mm through bundle of 100 × 100 µm2
cross-section microchannels33. Such implants are useful tools to
both understand nerve regeneration and design bidirectional
interfaces for artificial limb control, yet current designs usually
contain only one electrode site per microchannel, limiting
recording capability. Although the fabrication and interfacing of
high-density electrode arrays within microchannel implants
remain a challenge, we can optimize the design of microchannel
electrodes in vitro. In a first study, we use the nerve-on-a-chip
platform to test microchannel length, electrodes position and
number, and neural signal waveform against the ability to com-
pute conduction velocity using a velocity selective recording
(VSR) algorithm.
In a second study, we employ the platform to test a nerve
conduction block strategy based on thin coating of optoelectronic
organic semiconductor films. Conditions including amputa-
tion37,38, spinal cord injury10, or retinal degeneration39 call for
efficient nerve conduction blocking to reduce pain or silence
neural hyperactivity. Feyen et al.4 introduced controlled silencing
of neuronal activity through opto-thermal transduction in
explanted and cultured neuronal network using a semiconductive
poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric
acid
methyl
ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend polymer. This blend is compatible
with
thin-film
technology
and
microfabrication
of
neural
implants. Using our nerve-on-a-chip platform, we evaluated the
efficiency of this thin-film polymer to block neural conduction in
peripheral nerves.
Results
Nerve-on-a-chip design and recording capability. The nerve-
on-a-chip platform consists of two aligned microchannel elec-
trodes prepared on a glass carrier through which a nerve rootlet is
threaded (Fig. 1a). The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-
channels have a section of 100 × 100 μm2 and a 4–10 mm length.
Platinum microelectrodes are distributed along the micro-
channels—two electrodes in the stimulation channel, and up to
eight electrodes in the recording one (with 100 × 300 µm2 active
sites). The complete fabrication of the nerve-on-a-chip platform
(to final packaging in a Petri dish) can be carried out within
2 days and with multiple electrode layouts. Rat nerve rootlets are
dissected from the explanted spinal cord, which provides exci-
table roots for about 6 h post-mortem. Nerve roots are dissected
into strands of about 100 μm diameter and 2–4 cm length
(Figs. 1b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1). Next, a nerve rootlet is deli-
cately pulled through both stimulation and recording micro-
channels and kept at 37 °C. Explanted nerve roots are kept on ice
in Hibernate A until further dissected so that recordings from
tens of teased rootlets can be completed within a single day of

 experiment. For example, from an L5 root dissection, 10–15
rootlets are obtained and show a 90% excitability within the first
2–3 h. Beyond this time window, slow component of MUAP or
CAP become more difficult to record, suggesting thinner fibers
degrade faster than larger ones. On average, each rootlet is used
for about 10 min in the nerve-on-a-chip thus does not require
perfusion.
Upon electrical stimulation in the first microchannel (µA
range, 5 µs cathodic pulses), action potentials were triggered
within the nerve rootlet. Figure 1d illustrates a traveling SFAP
recorded by each of the eight electrodes distributed along the
recording microchannel. Confinement of the nerve rootlet in the
insulating
microchannel
substantially
amplifies
extracellular
signals28 (Supplementary Note 1). Following the stimulation
artifact (#1 label), the SFAP propagates along the axon in the
recording microchannel (#3 label). The initial onset (#2 label) is
an artifact caused by the SFAP entering the microchannel28.
Using one nerve rootlet and gradually increasing the stimulation
current from 2.1 to 3 μA, SFAP, MUAP, then CAP were elicited
thereby providing a variety of nerve signals, similar to those
occurring in vivo (Fig. 1e). Large nerve fibers displayed the lowest
stimulation threshold; increasing the stimulation current dom-
inantly recruited the largest fibers contained in the rootlet13.
Signal conduction velocity was next computed from spike
propagation delay recorded between two neighboring electrodes
(1 mm apart). At low stimulation current (2.1 and 2.3 µA), fibers
with distinct conduction velocities (and therefore distinct axon
diameter)40 were recruited (Fig. 1e: 44 and 12 ms–1). At higher
stimulation currents, fibers with the highest conduction velocity
(44 ms–1) were mostly recruited, thereby forming a CAP. The
CAP amplitude further increased with the stimulation current
(Fig. 1f).
In order to quantify the amplification along the channel, SFAP
were obtained using the minimal threshold of stimulation current
eliciting a single-neural response. When, the minimal current
elicited two spikes, the data were discarded. We observed that the
amplification of both the SFAP amplitude and SNR varied along
the channel length and were the highest at the location two-thirds
of the channel length (Fig. 1g). Increasing the microchannel
length further increases the signal amplitude and its SNR (Fig. 1h)
and asymmetry of the peak amplitude down the microchannel
(Supplementary Fig. 2). This is consistent with theoretical
analysis published by FitzGerald et al.28 and gives an indication
of the direction of propagation of the neural signals.
VSR. The nerve-on-a-chip platform supports more than one
electrode per microchannel thereby opening an opportunity to
register-rich axonal information such as signal propagation
direction and velocity. We implemented the VSR algorithm
described by Donaldson et al.41–44 to compute the direction and
velocity of nerve signals within the microchannel (Fig. 2a). Neural
signals recorded by each electrode along the microchannel are
shifted by an artificial time delay then summed. When the arti-
ficial time shift matches a neural signal propagation delay, the
signals add up constructively, and the detection of the maxima
can be used to compute the signal velocity. We used a systematic
approach to characterize neuron signal propagation along
microchannels of different dimensions (10 different designs) and
we implemented a computational model that simulates these
signals. Next, we built and validated a model that predicts the
error rate of velocity calculation as a function of the geometry of
the microchannel and signal waveform.
SFAP were recorded with the nerve-on-a-chip platform then
processed with the algorithm described above. We used the
success rate (SR) to quantify the algorithm performance, defined
as the proportion of successfully calculated velocity within 10
repetitions of an SFAP (Fig. 2b, thin lines). The reference velocity
(vreference) was defined as the velocity computed from averaged
repetitions (Fig. 2b, thick line). Ten platforms with varying
microchannel length, electrode number, and electrode pitch were
fabricated and enough SFAPs were recorded so that the full range
of signal amplitude, width, and velocity was obtained for each
design (Supplementary Fig. 3).
First, we used experimental data to measure the amplification
factor along microchannels with different length (4, 5, 6, and 10
mm, Supplementary Fig. 2) and further implement a computa-
tional simulation of SFAP propagation (Fig. 2c) to deduce SR
model terms and functions shown in Fig. 2d (see Supplementary
Methods for complete development). We found that (i) the SNR
rather than the signal amplitude affects the SR, (ii) the velocity is
exponentially correlated to the SR, and (iii) the microchannel
length, number of electrodes, electrode pitch, and SFAP SNR and
width are linearly correlated to the SR (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Next, we simulated propagating SFAP along the microchannel
(see Supplementary Methods for complete development) and
compared them with experimental fits. We computed the
influence of each parameter expressed as relative half effect on
the SR (Fig. 2e). Although all terms significantly affect the SR in
simulations, the number of electrodes and pitch have no
significant effect in experimental conditions. As the eventuality
of an over fit was discarded (Supplementary Fig. 5), we
hypothesize this difference depends on experimental variability.
Indeed, although in simulation data, there is no change in
waveform across repetitions of an SFAP, irregularities are
observed during and across recording sessions. In both experi-
mental and simulated analyses, we found the SR to be mostly
sensitive to the signal velocity and the SNR (Fig. 2f). Both sets of
coefficients predict experimental measures of the SR (SRe) with a
similar precision (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 6). The length of the
recording microchannel determines the SNR range at which
SFAP are recorded (Fig. 1f) and defines the maximal value of the
SR for velocity computation. The longer the microchannel (e.g., >
10 mm), the higher the SR ( > 0.8). Shorter microchannel requires
SFAP averaging to increase both the SNR and the SR (Fig. 2g,
fitting details in Supplementary Methods).
Heat-induced neuroinhibition upon P3HT:PCBM illumina-
tion. We adapted the microfabricated nerve-on-a-chip platform
to integrate optically transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) elec-
trodes within the recording microchannel thereby allowing for
concurrent optical stimulation and neural signal recording. A thin
film of P3HT:PCBM polymer was coated at the floor of the
recording microchannel (Figs. 3a, b). Shining green light (1 mm
diameter spot size, irradiance 16 mW mm–2, 510 and 550 nm
wavelength) through the thin blend film induces local surface
heating (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Movie 1)
with time constant of τpolymer of 3.22 s.
Representative neural signals (recorded at electrode E7) from a
nerve rootlet threaded through the modified nerve-on-a-chip are
shown Fig. 3d. Current stimulation (10–35 μA, 50 μs pulse width,
0.33 Hz) elicits MUAPs. Two superimposed signal envelopes are
clearly visible in the raw data (Fig. 3d, orange lines). Illumination
cycles (15-s light pulse) are applied to the nerve rootlet within the
recording microchannel and through the electrode E4. We
observe a visible reduction of signal amplitude during the
illumination phase (Fig. 3d). This appears in signals recorded
by
all
electrodes
within
the
microchannel
and
is
more
pronounced in the inner signal envelope than in the outer one.
As neural signal amplitude in the microchannel is positively
correlated with signal velocity26, these results suggest a stronger

 inhibition of MUAP amplitude in the slow fibers. As spike
amplitude can sum up or cancel out depending on their relative
position in the microchannel and are not distinguishable on all
electrodes, we used the normalized signal density (NSD) to
quantify signal inhibition rather than MUAP amplitude. We
integrated and normalized the fast and slow fiber activity (Fig. 3e,
f). Integration intervals for each electrode are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 9. Calculation was done based on a velocity
threshold
of
5 ms–1
(calculation
details
in
Supplementary
Methods). Then, we distinguish slow (green data, conduction
velocity < 5 ms–1) from fast (blue data, conduction velocity > 5
ms–1) fibers. NSD averages from recordings collected from four
distinct rootlets (Supplementary Fig. 8a) are displayed in Fig. 3g.
We discard recordings from ITO electrodes (E4–E6) as a
significant increase in white noise was observed close to the
illumination spot (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The statistical analysis
is detailed in Supplementary Methods. We observe maximal
inhibition of both fast and slow fiber close to the illuminated area

 (electrode E3). The inhibition gradually decreases as the distance
from the illuminated area increases, suggesting that photo-
induced heat is diffusing. To differentiate MUAP inhibition from
MUAP conduction blockade, we consider recordings from
electrodes positioned downstream the illumination area, i.e.,
electrodes E7 and E8. NSD of fast fiber fully recovers to 1,
whereas NSD of slow fiber remains inhibited, suggesting fast
fibers are locally inhibited by local heating while slow fibers
appear permanently blocked (Fig. 3g). The heat has a significantly
stronger effect on slow fibers than on fast fibers (Fig. 3h).

a
temperature increase localized to the spot size (Supplementary
Movie 1, Supplementary Fig. 7). In the nerve-of-chip platform,
the induced heat also diffuses through the extracellular medium
and the rootlet thereby inducing some inhibition up- and
downstream the illumination spot. An increase in temperature
affects signal propagation at different levels. First, voltage-gated
sodium channel activation and inactivation kinetics is accelerated,
which in turn shortens the action potential, decreases its
amplitude, and increases conduction velocity45–47. This is visible

(observing
propagating
action
potentials from fast fibers). Second, heating hyperpolarizes the
cell membrane thus competes against the depolarization wave
forming the action potential. Heat-induced hyperpolarization
decreases membrane resistance and increases membrane capaci-
tance48. As both membrane resistance and capacitance are
functions of nerve fiber diameter, it is expected the hyperpolariz-
ing effect will differ according to the fiber diameter. NSD kinetic
of slow and fast fibers with light-induced heating is illustrated by
“discharging/charging” like profiles (Fig. 3i). The corresponding
time constant τ of the fast fibers is nearly half that of the slow
fibers, and the NSD value at the end of the heat/illumination cycle
of the fast fibers is nearly twice that of the slow fibers. This
confirms slow fibers inhibition to light-induced heating is
stronger than that of fast fibers. The activity from both fibers
groups recovers their initial level once illumination is turned off.
Averaged NSD for the three heating/cooling cycles led to no
significant difference in the recovery phase, indicating that the
thermal inhibition is reversible (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Discussion
Our nerve-on-a-chip platform provides significant amplification
of extracellular axonal signals. Microchannel restricts the extra-
cellular space at the electrode—tissue interface increases its
impedance, which results in an increase in extracellular signals28.
Explanted nerve rootlets were used to demonstrate that signal
sensitivity can be increased by either decreasing the cross-
sectional area or by increasing the length of the microchannel in
previous studies. Microchannels were also used for in vivo
recording of regenerating fibers with a cross-section allowing
nerve growth and vascularization: 100 × 100 µm233,34,36,49. Simi-
larly, using microchannels as a stimulating cuff reduces the
necessary current to elicit nerve fiber response to the µA range26.
Optimal electrode size is a trade-off between recording selectivity
and thermal noise50. In previous studies, 100 × 300 µm2 electro-
des enabled recording of SFAP in vivo34.
In this ex vivo study, we maximized the length of both sti-
mulation and recording microchannels according to tissue length.
We separated recording and stimulation channels to further
decrease stimulation artifacts. We used microchannel and elec-
trode dimensions compatible with in vivo regeneration to show
the recording potential of the optimized microchannel. In 10 mm
long microchannel, we observed the all-or-none principle as
increasing the current lead to an incremental increase of the
amplitude. The relationship between amplitude and velocity was
consistent with previous studies on SFAP recording26. However,
over 16 recorded SFAP, 3 outliers (with higher amplitude than
expected for a given velocity) were obtained as well. Thus, we
cannot exclude that, occasionally, a detected waveform is the
result of the superposition of two identical signals traveling at the
very same velocity (Supplementary Fig. 3b). For experiments
relying on SFAP recording, one preliminary explant should sys-
tematically be devoted to calibration recording. The distribution
of amplitude-velocity (as a function of microchannel length and
section) would further be used as a reference to discard non-
SFAP data.
In order to implement a VSR in a regenerative implant for
in vivo applications, the length of a microchannel implant should
be as long as possible to maximize the SNR but short enough to
sustain nerve regeneration. Six-millimeter length appears as a
good trade-off. The number and spacing of electrodes have a
negligible impact on the reliability of velocity calculation in
millimeter length microchannels, however, the minimal number
of electrodes to run the VSR algorithm is 3. As the smallest spikes
are not systematically visible at both ends of the microchannel,
four electrodes should enable to systematically record spikes at
three sites. In the regenerative implants, spike sorting and aver-
aging (at least 50 repetitions) should be done prior to applying the
VSR for velocity up to 35 ms–1. For superior velocity, reliability of
SFAP velocity should be assessed individually by calculating the
SR. Finally, all SFAP with a low SR should be discarded from
in vivo analysis.
Different strategies to optimize the VSR algorithm perfor-
mance, based on qualitative analysis, have been previously
implemented in proof-of-principle studies44,51,52. Our platform
enabled rapid data collection and easy variation of the recording
design in a cost-efficient manner. Thanks to our data library, our
simulation and experimental validation enabled calculation of
Fig. 2 Prediction of VSR algorithm performance. a VSR principle, adapted from24. SFAP are traveling along the nerve recorded by n electrodes spaced by x
(gray line). The recordings on each electrode are shifted by ns (black line), where s corresponds to the propagation delay between two electrodes (multiple
of the sampling frequency). For each value of s, all recordings are summed. The sum becomes constructive when s matches dt (alignment of propagating
SFAP). b Example of calculation of the SR. Each simulated or recorded SFAP is elicited 10 times and averaged. The SR is the proportion of SFAP with a
calculated velocity equal to the velocity of the mean SFAP (see Eq. 1). c Example of recorded SFAP repetitions and mean (experimental data) and its
simulated version (amplitude = 55 µV, SNR = 30 dB, width = 0.22 ms, and velocity = 13.3 ms–1). d Linear model resulting from preliminary simulation (see
Supplementary Methods). The model terms are function of the number of electrode (NE), the electrode pitch (pitch), the SFAP width at half prominence
(width), the SFAP velocity (e1/v) and the maximum SNR along the channel (SNR). The model coefficients ai were fitted to experimental and simulated data.

 velocity measurement range as a function of the calculation error
rate, the SFAP waveform and the desired implant geometry.
Although some of the waveforms might have been superimposed
spikes, it did not influence our SR model, as the amplitude and
velocity are independent variables. Classification algorithm often
requires the experimenter to estimate the thresholds to detect
spikes (root mean square – based threshold) or differentiate them
(principal component analysis) to minimize false-positive and
-negative signal detection. Our platform enables to elicit single-
cell spike in a timely controlled manner, thereby providing direct

 read-out. Consequently, we were able to characterize not only the
error rate of velocity calculation but also quantify on which
variable it depends. To our knowledge, it is the first character-
ization of classification performance done in a dish. Our nerve-
on-a-chip model can offer more insight on optimizing decoding
algorithm for neuroprosthetic application.
Although heat inhibition was observed, it is unlikely that
photo-thermal thin films can be used to efficiently silence whole-
nerve activity as conduction block was not observed in the largest
myelinated fibers, even with a temperature increase of 10 °C.
However, compromising for inhibiting antidromic stimulation,
selective inhibition toward thinner fibers provides an exciting
opportunity for pain relief. As pain fibers have the smallest dia-
meter, and heat diffused over a few millimeters within the
microchannel, the semiconductive blend film could be integrated
in a nerve implant to selectively block pain without affecting
other nerve functions. In situ light stimulation could be achieved
with flexible optical fibers53,54 or micro-light-emitting diodes
embedded in the implant wall55. This approach would bypass the
need for genetic modification to control pain fibers or the use of
pain inhibiters56. Moreover, the patterning of the photo-thermal
semiconductive blend within the nerve implant could enable a
treatment localized in space and time to affected neurons to treat
chronic or phantom pain.
We used our platform to spatially control the propagation of
neural signals and were able to refine conclusions from a previous
study4 by adding the effect of fiber size to the outcome of silen-
cing. We confirmed that heat indeed inhibits neural activity but
not on large myelinated fibers. Investigation of pain suppression
often relies on in vivo indirect read-out such as Von Frey testing
as it is challenging to predict selective inhibition. Our results
show the importance of controlling tissue heterogeneity in vitro
and how these tools can extend to applications in the field of
neuroprosthetic research.
The microfabricated nerve-on-a-chip platform is a versatile
in vitro tool to study and quantify peripheral nerve electro-
physiology including nerve signal density and kinetics of activity
change of myelinated fibers. The platform offers a good com-
promise between SNR, stimulation selectivity, and temporal
selectivity of recordings. In addition, the ex vivo model reflects
accurately the heterogeneity present in peripheral nerve tissue
and enables advanced analysis based on the full range of SFAP
waveforms rather than on a single nerve fiber type. Of note, the
nerve-on-a-chip platform described here answers efficiently the 3
R principle. We built our neural signals library in 10 days of
experiment and acquired the neuromodulation data in 2 days,
involving 12 animals in total and a minimal degree of severity
procedure.
The nerve-on-a-chip platform is an efficient tool for designing
and evaluating new implantable electrodes: a range of electrode
configurations and materials can be tested to optimize implants
geometry, define electrical and optical powering of neural inter-
faces, validate neuromodulation strategies and selectivity, or
advance spike sorting algorithms. We foresee the ex vivo platform
may also find applications in neurotoxocity testing where alter-
natives to expensive and time consuming in vivo testing are
needed.
In summary, the microfabricated nerve-on-a-chip design can
be tailored to rapidly achieve complex multifactorial analysis,
computational modeling and experimental validation while deli-
vering a robust statistical analysis. Future improvements of the
nerve-on-a-chip platform include reducing of the cross-section
area of the microchannel to further amplify the extracellular
signals, perfecting nerve root teasing, and extending tissue sur-
vival with improved conservation environment. In addition, data
library based on MUAP and corresponding algorithms could be
developed to also extract their composing SFAP.
Methods
Device fabrication. The standard nerve-on-a-chip platform is made of two sti-
mulation electrodes, eight recording electrodes (pitch: 1 mm), and a reference and
grounding electrode. All tracks and electrodes were made in platinum. Glass wafers
were cleaned in a piranha solution. A Ti/Pt thin film (25/200 nm) was evaporated
and patterned on glass during a lift-off process (positive photoresist: LOR/AZ1215
800/1200 nm). Glass wafers were diced into rectangular chip of 4 × 2.5 cm2. PDMS
microchannels with a 100 × 100 μm2 cross-section were obtained through soft
photolithography; silicon master molds were obtained by BOSH RIE, silanized and
double casted with PDMS. Recording electrodes were encapsulated in a PDMS
microchannel (10 mm length) thereby defining 100 × 300 μm2 electrode contacts.
Similarly, stimulation electrodes were encapsulated in a 8 mm PDMS microchannel
leading to 100 × 600 μm2 electrode contacts. Connector wires were soldered to the
chip and encapsulated in silicone glue. The chip was glued inside a polystyrene
well.
For the VSR experiment, 10 platforms with different recording configuration
(channel length, number of electrode, and electrode pitch) were produced. For the
polymer experiment, stimulation electrodes were enlarged to 100 × 900 μm2 and
central recording electrodes were made of ITO to allow light transmission (E4, E5,
and E6): ITO electrodes (200 nm) were patterned (AZ1512 1200 nm) above
platinum tracks and etched using HCl. In addition, the semiconductive blend was
spin coated on top of the recording electrode. P3HT and PCBM were individually
dissolved in chlorobenzene anhydrous (concentration of 20 mg mL–1) and the
obtained solutions stirred overnight at 70 °C. Subsequently, the solutions were
filtered (PTFE filters, 0.45 µm) and mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio. Plastic tape was
used to restrict the area to be coated. The chip surface was activated by oxygen
plasma. The polymer (50 µL) was spin coated on the electrode layer at 1000 rpm for
60 s and baked 2 h at 80 °C (nominal thickness of 200 nm).
Tissue extraction. All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the
Veterinarian Offices of the Cantons of Vaud, Switzerland. Ten and three adult male
Lewis rats were used for the VSR and photo-thermal case studies, respectively.
They were provided ibuprofen in drinking water for 12 h and anesthetized with

performed (α = 0.05, Supplementary Methods). The illumination effect is significant, as well as the difference of inhibition between fast and slow fibers,
meaning that the effect of the illumination was stronger on slow fibers than on fast fibers. Post-hoc one-way ANOVA (α = 0.05, Supplementary Methods)
applied on slow and fast fiber separately showed a significant effect of the illumination on slow but not on fast fiber. Significance: **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05.

 isofluorane. The spinal cord was exposed via a long laminectomy (T12–L6) and
longitudinal dura matter incision. Nerve roots were cut at the exit foramen and the
spinal cord with attached roots was left on ice in Hibernate A medium (Life
Technology) until further dissected. The dissection and recording took place in
Hanks’s balanced salt solution kept at room temperature. Nerve roots were cut
from the spinal cord to obtain a nerve strand of several centimeters. They were
teased into rootlets with a diameter of 100 μm (Supplementary Fig. 1). One end of
the rootlet was tied with a nylon suture (Ethicon 9.0), used to pull it inside the
microchannels. For testing recording capabilities and for the VSR experiment,
nerve activity was recorded from ventral L5–L4 root at 37 °C using a hotplate. For
the polymer experiment, nerve activity was recorded from dorsal S1 root at room
temperature.
Histology. Dissected rootlets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C.
Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sliced with 1.5 µm thickness. Hematoxylin
was used for tissue staining; imaging was performed with bright field microscopy.
Data acquisition. Each recording electrode was connected to an AC amplifier
(AM-system 1700) with a gain of 1000 and a band pass filter of 100Hz–5kHz (–40
dB decade–1). Data were acquired using Micro-1401 hardware and Signal software
(CED). Sampling frequencies varied with the experiments: for testing recording
capabilities and for the VSR experiment, data were recorded at a sampling fre-
quency of 50 kHz and further interpolated (cubic spline, MATLAB) at 500 kHz.
For the polymer experiment, data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 25
kHz and no further interpolation was made. Finally, all recordings were band
filtered using (butterworth, order = 1, MATLAB) with cutoff frequency of 100 Hz
and 3 kHz.
VSR. Our nerve-on-a-chip platform is depicted Figs. 1a, b. We fabricated different
designs in order to vary experimentally the SNR range (via the recording micro-
channel length), the number of electrode and the electrode pitch (summarized in
Supplementary Table 1). Ten adult male rats were used in this study. With each
platform design, we elicited and recorded 30 different SFAP and each SFAP was
elicited 10 times using minimal threshold current stimulation (square, cathodic,
phase: 50 µs). We built a custom software in MATLAB to supervise spike detection
in the individual spikes and in the average of spike repetition. The software then
extracted all the biological parameters, VSR results and performance on all data.
The ladder was defined as follow:
Performance � SR ¼ NSFAP 2 ½vreference þ δ; vreference � δ�
Nrepetition
ð1Þ
where NSFAP is the count of SFAP velocity successfully calculated, Nrepetition is the
number of repetition of an SFAP, vreference is the calculated velocity of the mean
SFAP, δ was set according to the sampling step of the velocity at 50 ± 5 ms–1. SFAP
with a velocity above 60 ms–1 or containing multiple spikes were discarded from
the study.
In order to model recorded data, we extracted several parameters from the
experimental setup that we included in our simulation and reproduced the same
data processing step. (Details on the implementation of the model, simulation
parameter, and model fitting can be found in Supplementary Methods). First, we
measured SFAP amplification for each channel length; we normalized the SFAP
amplitude along the channel and averaged the recordings. The same analysis was
done on the SNR and the SFAP width (Supplementary Fig. 2). Second, we
measured biological range of amplitude, width, SNR at mid-channel
(Supplementary Fig. 3a) and how they are related to the velocity (Supplementary
Fig. 3b). We simulated SFAP with all possible combination of width, SNR, and
velocity and included channel amplification factors corresponding to each nerve-
on-a-chip design. Each SFAP was simulated 10 times to enable the measurement of
the SR. We used intermediate simulation to implement a linear model correlating
the SR with SFAP width, velocity, SNR, the number of electrode, and electrode
pitch (see Supplementary Methods). It was fitted to both simulated data and
experimental data to calculate the model coefficients.
Heat-induced neuroinhibition upon P3HT:PCBM illumination. Four nerve
rootlets (dorsal S1) were placed in the chip coated with the polymer and mounted
under a light source (1 mm diameter spot size, irradiance 16 mW mm–2, wave-
lengths 510 and 550 nm) at room temperature. Each rootlet was stimulated using
current (square, anodic, phase: 50 μs, pulse frequency: 0.33 Hz). Every 45 s, a 15-s
light pulse was illuminating the electrode E4. Signals envelope and NSD for slow
and fast fiber were computed for each root at each electrode. A factorial analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the effect of the light on fiber type at each
electrode (see Supplementary Methods for detailed statistics). We quantified the
heating upon illumination with an IR camera. We applied an illumination pulse
with the same duration and intensity as in the recording experiment on plain glass
and glass coated with the blend.
