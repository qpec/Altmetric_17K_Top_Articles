Abstract
Background: The inclusion of almonds in an energy-restricted diet has been reported both to enhance or to have no effect
on weight loss. Their effects specifically on visceral body fat stores during energy restriction have not been widely
examined. In addition, almond consumption has been associated with reduced blood pressure (BP), but whether this is
linked to or independent of changes in body composition has to our knowledge not been examined.
Objective: We evaluated the effects of consuming almonds as part of an energy-restricted diet on body composition,
specifically visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and BP, compared to a nut-free energy-restricted diet.
Methods: A randomized controlled 12-wk clinical trial of 86 healthy adults [body mass index (in kg/m2): 25–40] was conducted.
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 energy-restricted (500-kcal deficit/d) diets: an almond-enriched diet (AED) (15%
energy from almonds) or a nut-free diet (NFD). A linear mixed-model analysis on primary outcomes such as body weight, body
fat, VAT, and BP was performed on all participants [intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis] and compliant participants (complier analysis).
Results: Body weight, truncal and total fat percentage, VAT, and systolic BP decreased after 12 wk of energy restriction in
both the ITT and complier analyses (P < 0.05). The complier analysis (but not the ITT analysis) indicated a greater mean 6 SEM
reduction in truncal fat (AED: 21.21% 6 0.26%; NFD: 20.48% 6 0.24%; P = 0.025), total fat (AED: 21.79% 6 0.36%; NFD:
20.74% 6 0.33%; P = 0.035), and diastolic BP (AED: 22.71 6 1.2 mm Hg; NFD: 0.815 6 1.1 mm Hg; P = 0.029), and a greater
tendency for VAT loss (AED: 28.19 6 1.8 cm2; NFD: 23.99 6 1.7 cm2; P = 0.09) over time in the AED group than the NFD group.
Conclusions: Moderate almond consumption by compliant overweight and obese individuals during energy restriction
results in greater proportional reductions of truncal and total body fat as well as diastolic BP and hence may help to reduce
metabolic disease risk in obesity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02360787.

Introduction
Despite their high energy content, the inclusion of almonds in an
energy-restricted diet does not compromise and may enhance
weight loss (1–3). This may occur by several mechanisms, the most
important of which is probably through improved dietary compli-
ance. This is likely attributable to greater sensory variety that
results in a higher palatability of the diet (4), stronger locus of
control (5) that leads to a sense of empowerment, and management
of appetitive sensations through their slow and sustained energy
release (6). The satiating effects of almonds may prolong intermeal
intervals, promote smaller meal sizes, and reduce the desire to eat
when not hungry and hence contribute to purposeful weight loss (7).
A goal of weight loss is to maximize the reduction of fat mass
while retaining fat-free mass. Traditionally, exercise was viewed as
the primary way of achieving this outcome, but evidence shows that
dietary factors can also be effective (8). Increasing the proportion of
protein in an energy-restricted diet enhances satiety, energy expen-
diture, and greater relative fat mass loss (9). In addition, different
types of dietary fat may influence substrate oxidization. Monoun-
saturated fats are oxidized preferentially (10, 11), and a diet higher in
the unsaturated:saturated fat ratio may reduce subcutaneous adipose
tissue (12) and, more importantly, visceral adipose tissue (VAT)4

 during weight loss (13). Few studies, to our knowledge, have
investigated the effects of dietary FA composition on abdominal fat
changes (14). VAT undergoes rapid lipolytic activity that leads to
an increased flux of FFA to the liver and systemic circulation. As a
consequence, muscle insulin sensitivity is reduced and insulin
secretion is stimulated. Elevated peripheral insulinemia will
suppress lipolysis and promote lipogenesis, resulting in the accu-
mulation of more abdominal and visceral fat (15). The preferential
loss of VAT is believed to mitigate metabolic syndrome and hence
improve metabolic fitness. Almonds are good sources of protein
and monounsaturated fats, and their effects on visceral body fat
loss, in conjunction with energy restriction, have not been directly
examined.
Being overweight increases the risk of hypertension by 46–
75% (16). There is evidence implicating visceral adiposity as the
primary cause of obesity-related hypertension (17). Losing
weight may reduce blood pressure (BP), and this may be
augmented by incorporating almonds into the diet. In addition,
food-derived peptides such as arginine reduce the risk of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) (18). Arginine is the physiologic precursor
of NO, a vasodilator (19). NO inactivation increases BP (20).
Certain nuts and seeds are good plant-based sources of arginine,
and studies with peanuts (2.8 g arginine/100 g peanuts, as indicated
in the USDA National Nutrient Database) reveals their ingestion
for 12 wk leads to notable reductions in diastolic BP (21). Almonds
also contain a high concentration of arginine (2.4 g arginine/100 g
almonds), but their effect on BP is not well characterized.
The purpose of this study (NCT02360787) was to evaluate the
effects of almond consumption as part of an energy-restricted diet
on weight, body composition, VAT, and BP compared to a nut-
free diet (NFD) matched on the level of energy restriction. We
hypothesized that including almonds in an energy-restricted diet
would augment the rate of weight loss, lead to greater fat loss
(especially in the visceral depot), and reduce BP compared to a
control diet matched on energy restriction.
Methods
Participants
Eighty-six healthy adults (21 men and 65 women) aged 18–60 y who
were overweight and obese [BMI (in kg/m2): 25–40] were recruited.
Eligibility criteria included the following: no nut allergies, willingness to
consume almonds, not taking medications known to influence metabo-
lism and appetite, nonsmoker for >1 y, consistent diet and activity patterns,
and weight-stable (<3-kg change over the last 3 mo). All procedures
involving human subjects were approved by the Purdue University
Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited via public adver-
tisements. Participants were excluded from the trial if they had diabetes or
prediabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, CVD, or dyslipidemia requiring
drug therapy. Informed consent was obtained from participants who met
eligibility criteria before the commencement of study visits.
Study protocol
The study was a 12-wk randomized, controlled, parallel-arm clinical
trial. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 energy-restricted
study arms: an almond-enriched diet (AED) or NFD. Both groups
received dietary counseling with the use of the MyPlate food guidance
system (21) to reduce energy intake to achieve a 500-kcal deficit/d to
support weight loss. Their estimated energy requirement was calculated
with the use of the Schofield equations (22) with a physical activity level
factor of 1.3. Participants met with a dietitian on a weekly basis for the
first 5 wk (including baseline) to establish their dietary prescription and
every 2 wk until the 10th week of the study to monitor dietary
adherence. Weekly energy and nutrient analyses were conducted with the
use of 24-h food recalls to determine participants� compliance to dietary
recommendations. Compliance to consistent physical activity was tracked
every 4 wk on 2 d (1 weekday and 1 weekend day) with the use of a
previously validated triaxial accelerometer (RT3; Stayhealthy) (23).
Forty-three participants were randomly assigned to both the AED and
NFD groups. They were asked to consume almonds providing 15% energy
in their individualized energy-restricted diet. The almonds were dry-
roasted at 129.4�C for ;50 min and were lightly salted (199 mg Na/100 g
almonds) to enhance palatability. The energy from almonds was accounted
for during dietary modeling so that a 500-kcal deficit/d was achieved.
Participants in the AED group were asked to avoid consuming other nuts
and seeds. Participants in the NFD group were asked to avoid all nuts,
seeds, and nut products during the intervention period.
Study outcomes
The primary outcomes for this study were weight, body composition,
VAT, and resting BP. Other outcomes were waist circumference, sagittal
abdominal diameter (SAD), serum lipids, insulin, glucose, 24-h ambu-
latory BP, and 24-h free-living appetite. All outcomes were assessed at
baseline and 12 wk after the intervention.
Anthropometric outcomes. Body weight was measured with the use of
a calibrated scale (model ABC; Tanita) with participants wearing
minimal light-weight clothing. Height was measured with the use of a
wall-mounted stadiometer. Body composition was assessed with the use
of DXA (Lunar iDXA; GE Healthcare). SAD was measured with the use
of a portable sliding caliper (Holtain-Kahn Abdominal Caliper; Holtain
Limited) placed at the level of the iliac crest while participants were in a
supine position. Waist circumference was measured with the use of a
measuring tape placed at the narrowest part of the torso.
VATwas predicted with the use of 2 multivariate anthropometric models.
The first model was based on waist circumference (centimeters), proximal
thigh circumference (centimeters), age (years), and/or BMI (24) [i.e., women:
VAT = 2.15 (waist circumference) – 3.63 (proximal thigh circumference) +
1.46 (age) + 6.22 (BMI) – 92.713; men: VAT = 6 (waist circumference) – 4.41
(proximal thigh circumference) + 1.19 (age) – 213.65 (model 1) (24)].
Proximal thigh height was measured with the use of a measuring tape placed
around the thigh just distal to the gluteal crease. The second model was based
on SAD (centimeters), age (years), waist circumference (centimeters), and
truncal fat (percentage) [i.e., VAT = 2208.2 + 4.62 (SAD) + 0.75 (age) + 1.73
(waist circumference) + 0.78 (truncal fat) (model 2) (25)]. Although this
model has only been validated for women, we applied it to men as well and
examined the correlations between the 2 models with regard to sex.
Resting BP was assessed with the use of an automated digital BP
monitor (model 6013; American Diagnostic Corporation). The partic-
ipants rested for 5 min before BP measurement. Three readings were
taken, and the mean was used to determine resting BP. Twenty-four–hour
ambulatory BP in a free-living environment was assessed with the use of
an automated ambulatory BP machine (ABPM50; Contec) that was
programmed to measure BP every hour from 0800 to 2400 and then
every 4 h until 0800 the next day. This device was worn on the arm for
24 h, and the cuff was periodically inflated and deflated to measure BP.
Serum lipids, insulin, and glucose. Fasting blood samples (8 mL)
obtained from participants were analyzed for serum insulin with the use
of an ELECSYS 2010 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (CV: 2.5–2.8%), and
glucose (CV: 1.1–1.4%) and lipids [total cholesterol (CV: 1.4–1.9%),
LDL cholesterol (CV: 1.8–1.9%), HDL cholesterol (CV: 0.7–1%), and
TGs (CV: 1.9%)] were analyzed with the use of a COBAS INTEGRA
400 Plus analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).
Free-living appetite ratings. Hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and
prospective consumption ratings were measured on visual analog scales
on palm pilots with end anchors of ‘‘not at all’’ to ‘‘extremely.’’ These
ratings were assessed hourly during waking hours over a 24-h period.
The mean of the respective appetite ratings were considered for analysis.
Almond acceptance and palatability ratings
Participants randomly assigned to the AED group rated the acceptability
of almonds with the use of a food action rating scale (26) and the
palatability of almonds with the use of a hedonic general labeled magnitude
scale (27, 28) 1 wk after the start of the intervention and at the end of the
intervention.

 Compliance assessment
Participants� compliance with energy restriction (regardless of group) was
assessed via self-reported intake (24-h food recalls) and weight loss. The 24-h
recalls were collected by a registered dietitian every week for the first 5 wk
(including at baseline) and then every 2 wk until the 10th week of the study.
Participants� compliance to their respective intervention groups (i.e., almond
consumption or no nut consumption) was monitored via self-reported intake
(24-h food recalls) as well as by analyzing their erythrocyte membranes for
lipids and flavonoids at baseline and 12 wk after the intervention.
The lipid extracts from participants� erythrocytes were prepared with
the use of a procedure by Rose and Oklander (29) and were analyzed by
a shotgun lipidomics approach (J Dhillon, CR Ferreira, TJP Sobreira, RD
Mattes, unpublished data, 2016). The most informative lipids identified
through the lipidomic scans and nut flavonoids reported in the literature
were combined into 2 MS methods, single-ion monitoring and multiple-
reaction monitoring, with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrom-
eter. Data obtained from the targeted single-ion and multiple-reaction
monitoring methods were analyzed via univariate (volcano plots) and
multivariate statistics with the use of MetaboAnalyst version 3.0 (30).
The performance of the different m/z values and their combinations and
ratios was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analyses.
Statistical analysis
We conducted 2 analyses: an ITT analysis followed by an analysis of
participants compliant to their respective intervention groups. Both
analyses used a linear mixed model with time, intervention group, and a
time-by-intervention-group interaction as factors for all absolute values
of outcomes. An additional linear mixed-model analysis on the change in
outcomes as opposed to absolute values was also performed. In each
analysis, when significant interactions were observed, pairwise comparisons
with Bonferroni correction were carried out. Age range, sex, and BMI range
were also considered as between-subject factors for all the tests, but there
were no effects of the aforementioned factors on any of the outcomes.
The sample size calculations for this study were based on the detection of
a 7% difference in visceral fat between groups with 80% power and a 2-tailed
a of 0.05. Complete data were required from 40 participants/group.
Between-group differences were assessed at baseline by using independent-
sample t tests. Categorical outcomes were assessed with the use of chi-
square tests. The a level was set at 0.05. SPSS version 22 (IBM) was used
for all statistical analyses. Data are reported as means 6 SEMs unless
otherwise stated.

 were 7% for the AED group and 9.3% for the NFD group at
12 wk. There were no significant differences in attrition between
the AED and NFD intervention groups at 12 wk. The baseline
characteristics of all participants are described in Table 1. There
were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of
participants between groups.
Compliance to energy restriction. The energy-restriction
compliance rates were 65.1% for the AED group and 67.4% for
the NFD group at 12 wk. There were no significant differences in
compliance to energy restriction as assessed by the dietary intake
data and weight loss between the AED and NFD intervention
groups at 12 wk.
Compliance to intervention groups. Data from 24-h recalls
indicated that total energy, carbohydrates, fat, protein, and
sodium intake decreased over time (P < 0.05). The percentage of
energy from fat and total MUFAs, oleic acid, the MUFA:SFA
ratio, linoleic acid, total a-tocopherol, magnesium, copper, and
phytic acid intake (almonds are rich in these nutrients) was
greater and the percentage of energy from carbohydrates lower
in the AED group than the NFD group at the end of the
intervention (P < 0.05) (Table 2).
The shotgun metabolomics analysis conducted on 61 partic-
ipants whose erythrocytes were collected indicated that specific
ratios and combinations of mainly membrane lipids such as
phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin were discriminatory of
almond consumption from the nut-free diet at the end of the
12-wk intervention in the AED group (J Dhillon, CR Ferreira,
TJP Sobreira, RD Mattes, unpublished data, 2016). However, 8
participants in the AED group and 3 from the NFD group were
misclassified into the opposite group, indicating possible non-
compliance to their respective interventions that was supported
by dietary intake data. These participants, as well as those who
did not comply with the energy restriction, were excluded from
thesecondarycomplieranalysis.Therewerenosignificantdifferences
in overall compliance based on weight loss and the metabolomics
analysis to the AED and NFD intervention groups at 12 wk. The
baseline characteristics of the compliers are shown in Table 1.
Anthropometric outcomes. Weight loss was similar in both
the AED and NFD groups in the ITT and complier analyses
(Table 3). However, the complier analysis indicated a signifi-
cantly greater decrease in truncal fat mass and percentage and
total fat percentage and a significantly greater increase in the
truncal and total fat-free mass percentage in the AED group than
the NFD group (P < 0.05) (Figure 2). In general, truncal and total
fat mass and percentage fat significantly decreased after the
intervention (P < 0.05) in both analyses, whereas truncal and total
fat-free mass significantly decreased only in the complier analysis.
Truncal and total fat-free mass percentage significantly increased
after the intervention in both analyses (P < 0.05) (Figure 2).
SAD and waist circumference measurements were similar in the
AED and NFD groups after the intervention in both analyses (Table
3). However, SAD and waist circumference significantly decreased
after the intervention in both analyses (P < 0.05) (Table 3).
VAT, predicted with the use of both models, significantly
decreased after the intervention (P < 0.05) in both analyses (Table
3). Although there was a tendency for greater VAT loss in the AED
group than the NFD group (model 1: P = 0.09) in the complier
analysis, this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3).
Although VAT model 2 was validated only for women, it strongly
correlated with VAT model 1 for both men (r = 0.94; P < 0.001)
and women (r = 0.92; P < 0.001) (baseline correlations shown).
Resting diastolic BP significantly decreased in the AED group
after the intervention (P < 0.05) but not in the NFD group for
compliant participants (Table 3). However, resting systolic BP
significantly decreased after the intervention (P < 0.05) in both
analyses (Table 3). Twenty-four–hour ambulatory systolic and
diastolic BP remained unchanged at the end of the intervention
in both analyses. In general, ambulatory BP readings were sig-
nificantly higher during waking hours (systolic: 124 6 0.6 mm
Hg; diastolic: 73.9 6 0.46 mm Hg) than sleeping hours (systolic:
114 6 1.04 mm Hg; diastolic: 64.1 6 0.94 mm Hg) (P < 0.05).
Serum lipids, insulin, and glucose. Fasting serum insulin,
TGs, total cholesterol, and HDL and LDL cholesterol remained
unchanged after the intervention, whereas fasting glucose increased
significantly after the intervention regardless of the intervention
group (P < 0.05) (Table 3). In the complier analysis, fasting glucose
remained unchanged after the intervention in both groups (Table 3).
Free-living appetite ratings. Twenty-four–hour hunger, desire-
to-eat, and prospective consumption ratings significantly de-
creased at the end of the intervention (P < 0.05), with no
differences between the AED and NFD groups (Table 3). Fullness
ratings remained unchanged at the end of the intervention (Table
3). In the complier analysis, hunger, desire-to-eat, and fullness
ratings followed the same trend as in the ITT analysis, but
prospective consumption ratings remained unchanged at the end
of the intervention (Table 3).
Almond palatability and acceptance. The almond palatability
ratings significantly decreased after the intervention (24.81 6 2.2 food
action rating scale units; P < 0.05), whereas the almond acceptance

Discussion
This study presents several important findings, particularly for
individuals who might comply with this type of dietary change.
Despite similar weight loss with the 2 diets, almond consumption
was associated with considerably greater proportional improve-
ments in overall body composition and greater fat loss in the
truncal area in compliant participants. Estimates of truncal fat
(DXA) are typically strongly correlated with abdominal visceral
fat (r = 0.86–0.89) (31); hence, a reduction in truncal fat could
reduce metabolic disease risk. One possible explanation for the
greater fat loss with almond consumption stems from their high
unsaturated fat content. Unsaturated fats have high-fat oxidation
rates that can preferentially reduce visceral fat (7). However,
these beneficial effects may only be observed in individuals who
fully complied with the protocol (i.e., with energy restriction
and almond consumption) because no such effects were found
in the ITT group.
Although there was no statistically significant difference in
VAT loss between the 2 diets, there was a tendency (P = 0.09) for
a greater reduction in VAT with almond consumption when
assessed with the use of models that took into account DXA
estimates of truncal fat and other measures of central obesity
such as SAD and waist circumference. Two nut-based interven-
tion trials examined VAT directly and found conflicting results
(32, 33); whereas walnut consumption led to substantial reduc-
tions of fat in both visceral and subcutaneous depots in overweight
diabetic individuals in one trial (33), pistachio consumption for
24 wk did not lead to a reduction in VATor subcutaneous adipose
tissue (assessed by MRI) in individuals with metabolic syndrome
in the other trial (32). Although the walnut trial was conducted in
the context of weight maintenance, participants still lost weight.
Hence, nut consumption in the context of weight loss might have
greater effects on VAT loss. Nut-specific effects are also possible,
but in most clinical outcomes there are generally more similarities
between nut types than there are differences.
Our intervention demonstrated a decrease in resting systolic
BP in both groups, but only the AED was associated with
a reduction in resting diastolic BP (23.6%) in compliant
participants (but not in the ITT analysis). Our findings differ
from the preponderance of clinical evidence that suggests no
effect of tree nuts on resting BP in individuals without existing
CVD (34). Similar reductions in diastolic BP have been observed
with peanut consumption, but only in individuals with elevated
BP at baseline (21). Moreover, in the Primary Prevention of
Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet trial, the
consumption of a nut-based Mediterranean diet for 1 y led to a

Effects of almonds on body fat and blood pressure

 decrease in 24-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP, but only in
individuals with a high risk of CVD (35). It is possible our
findings reflect the use of almonds under energy-restricted
weight-loss conditions that could augment the reductions of
diastolic BP (36).
In this study, serum insulin and glucose remained unchanged
with almond consumption for 12 wk. Although nut consump-
tion has positive effects on glycemic control (37), the long-term
effects are typically more favorable in prediabetic (38) and
diabetic individuals (39) or those with metabolic syndrome (40).
In addition, there were no changes in serum TGs or total, HDL,
and LDL cholesterol with almond consumption. The partici-
pants in our study were healthy adults who were overweight and
obese with no other CVD risk factors, and the preponderance of
nut-based evidence shows the greatest improvements in blood
cholesterol in individuals with high LDL cholesterol and those
with a low BMI and improvements in TGs in individuals with
hypertriglyceridemia (41). Moreover, these improvements were
observed with a mean daily nut consumption of 67 g, whereas the
participants in our study had a mean daily nut consumption of 38 g.
The satiating effects of almond consumption in acute feeding
trials are well documented (7). These properties have important
implications for weight management because they can translate
into strong dietary compensatory responses. Whether these
satiating effects can be sustained chronically has yet to be
established to our knowledge. In this 12-wk clinical weight-loss
trial, almond consumption reduced 24-h–hunger and desire-to-
eat ratings to a similar degree as the nut-free diet. However, it is
important to note that both intervention groups underwent
structured dietary counseling to make healthier and satiating
food choices.
Another consideration in long-term feeding studies is the
monotony that results from the repeated daily consumption of
specific foods (42). This is important because it might undermine
compliance to a dietary recommendation to increase the
consumption of a given food. Long-term (12-wk) consumption
of 30 g nuts/d does not seem to induce the effects of monotony
over time (43, 44), but as indicated by the decreased acceptance
of nuts with the repeated consumption of 60 g nuts/d, these
effects might be dose-dependent (43). In our study, almond
palatability ratings decreased considerably over time but
remained within an acceptable range (i.e., from over strongly
palatable at baseline to over moderately palatable at the end of
the intervention). However, individuals who complied with the
intervention demonstrated no decline in almond palatability
ratings (rated consistently over strongly palatable). Although
this finding suggests that these individuals may have been more
resistant to the effects of monotony and hence more compliant,
it needs to be investigated further.
In conclusion, incorporating modest quantities of almonds in
a 12-wk weight-loss regimen led to improvements in body
composition and BP in healthy overweight and obese adults who
complied with the protocol. The findings from the ITT analysis
reflect the practical implications of almond consumption during
energy restriction, whereas the complier analysis reflects more
closely the efficacy of the almond intervention when individuals
are compliant with almond consumption during energy restric-
tion. Nevertheless, the clinical benefits of moderate almond con-
sumption among individuals with or at a high risk for metabolic
syndrome and/or CVD have been repeatedly confirmed, and our
findings indicate positive health effects among compliant over-
weight but otherwise healthy adults as well.
