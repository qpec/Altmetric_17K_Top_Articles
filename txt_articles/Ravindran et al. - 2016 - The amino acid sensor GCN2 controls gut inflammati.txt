Summary
The integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism by which eukaryotic cells sense 
and respond to stress-inducing signals, such as amino acid starvation. General controlled 
nonrepressed (GCN2) kinase is a key orchestrator of the ISR, and modulates cellular metabolism 
in response to amino acid starvation. Here we demonstrate that GCN2 controls intestinal 
inflammation by suppressing inflammasome activation. Enhanced activation of ISR was observed 
in intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells during amino acid starvation, or 
intestinal inflammation. Genetic deletion of GCN2 in CD11c+ APCs or intestinal epithelial cells 
resulted in enhanced intestinal inflammation and Th17 responses, due to enhanced inflammasome

 activation and IL-1β production. This was caused by reduced autophagy in GCN2−/− intestinal 
APCs and epithelial cells, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potent activator of 
inflammasomes1. Thus, conditional ablation of Atg5 and Atg7 in intestinal APCs resulted in 
enhanced ROS and Th17 responses. Furthermore, in vivo blockade of ROS and IL-1β resulted in 
inhibition of Th17 responses and reduced inflammation in GCN2−/− mice. Importantly, acute 
amino acid starvation suppressed intestinal inflammation via a mechanism dependent on GCN2. 
These results reveal a mechanism that couples amino acid sensing with control of intestinal 
inflammation via GCN2.
The immune system can sense pathogens through pathogen recognition receptors2, but 
emerging evidence suggests that it can also sense and respond to environmental changes that 
cause cellular stress3. The ISR is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism that enables 
eukarytoic cells to sense and respond to diverse stress signals, such as amino acid starvation 
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress4. The four known sensors of the ISR include: GCN2, 
Protein Kinase R (PKR), Heme-Regulated Inhibitor (HRI) and PKR-like Endoplasmic 
Reticulum Kinase (PERK)4. GCN2 senses amino acid depletion, PERK senses endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress, and PKR can recognize viral double-stranded RNA4. Activation of 
HRI is induced by heme deficiency5, and is important for the survival of erythroid 
precursors. Activation of these four sensors results in phosphorylation of eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) leading to initiate global translational arrest4. Recent evidence 
suggests a crosstalk between the ISR and the immune system3. Thus, our recent systems 
based analysis of immune responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) in humans 
revealed a correlation between the expression of GCN2 in the blood and the magnitude of 
the later CD8+ T cell response6. Furthermore YF-17D induced GCN2 activation in dendritic 
cells (DCs), resulting in enhanced autophagy and antigen presentation7. Whether GCN2 can 
modulate immune responses during conditions of amino acid restriction remains unexplored. 
This is particularly relevant in the intestine, where the immune system has to endure 
dynamic changes in nutrient bioavailability. We thus determined whether GCN2 impacts 
immune-homeostasis in the intestine.
Phosphorylated eIF2α was detected in intestinal DCs, macrophages and epithelial cells 
under steady state and inflammatory conditions (Extended Data. Fig.1a). Furthermore, 
expression of phosphorylated PKR, PERK, eIF2α and GCN2 could be detected in tissues 
from healthy and inflamed human colon (Extended Data. Fig.1b). Analysis of public gene 
expression databases revealed that the expression of genes encoding GCN2 and other eIF2α 
kinases was highest in the colon, relative to other organs (Extended Data. Fig.1c). 
Interestingly, there was a higher expression of genes encoding GCN2, PERK and PKR in 
ulcerative colitis (UC) and crohn's disease (CD), relative to healthy controls8,9 (Extended 
Data. Fig. 1d).
To investigate the functions of GCN2 in vivo we analyzed the structure and morphology of 
gut tissue isolated from the GCN2−/− mice. Ki-67 and Chromogranin A staining in small and 
large intestines were unaffected in GCN2−/− mice suggesting that GCN2 is not required for 
steady-state cell differentiation and proliferation in the intestine (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b 
and d). GCN2−/− mice had normal paneth cell granules as evident in the lysozyme staining

 (Extended Data Fig. 2c), and did not exhibit any spontaneous gut inflammation up to 45 wks 
of age.
We then assessed the impact of GCN2 deficiency on acute colitis by challenging the mice 
with 2% Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS), a chemical irritant which induces inflammation 
with clinical and histological features of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) in mice10. 
Upon DSS administration GCN2−/− mice exhibited enhanced severity of colitis compared to 
littermates, including greater weight loss, inflammation, Th17 responses and colon 
shortening (Fig. 1a-c & Extended Data Fig. 3a, b and c). Histopathological analysis revealed 
severe mucosal epithelial erosion, displacement and crypt loss (Extended Data Fig. 3a). 
Consistent with enhanced gut inflammation, we observed a severely impaired epithelial 
barrier, evidenced by increased intestinal permeability (Extended Data Fig. 3d). These 
differences were not due to differences in the expression of antimicrobial defensins between 
wild type and GCN2−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e).
To assess potential roles for APCs versus epithelial cells in mediating the effects of GCN2, 
we generated mice lacking GCN2 specifically in epithelial cells (GCN2flox/flox villin cre+, 
GCN2ΔVillin hereon) (Fig. 1 d-f, Extended Data Fig. 3a, b and c), or in CD11c+ APCs 
(GCN2flox/flox CD11c cre+, GCN2ΔAPC hereon) (Fig. 1g-i; Extended data Fig 3a, b and c). 
DSS induced enhanced colitis in both strains, evidenced by weight loss, colon shortening 
and increased Th17 responses, (a surrogate readout of intestinal inflammation), relative to 
littermate controls (Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 3b and c). Consistent with a role for GCN2 in 
APCs, isolated intestinal DCs from GCN2−/− mice could stimulate enhanced IL-17 
production from antigen specific CD4+ T cells, in vitro (Extended Fig. 3f). Collectively, 
these findings demonstrate that GCN2 deficiency in both epithelial cells and APCs results in 
enhanced inflammation and DSS-induced colitis.
Since PERK activation by ER stress is also known to be an important component of the host 
ISR11, we generated mice lacking PERK in epithelial cells (PERKflox/flox villin cre+, 
PERKΔVillin hereon) or APCs (PERKflox/flox CD11cre+, PERKΔAPC hereon) to study the 
role of PERK in intestinal inflammation (Extended Data Fig. 4). PERK deficient strains 
were challenged with 2% DSS, and their symptoms and pathology were compared to 
littermate controls. Both PERKΔVillin and PERKΔAPC strains exhibited little or no 
differences relative to littermates, in intestinal inflammation induced by DSS (Extended 
Data Fig. 4).
Since ISR kinases exert their function by phosphorylating Ser-51 on eIF2α, we assessed the 
impact of eIF2α on intestinal inflammation. We generated mice conditionally lacking Ser51 
eIF2α phosphorylation in epithelial cells (eIF2αflox/flox villin cre+, eIF2αΔVillin, hereon) as 
previously described12,13 and APCs (eIF2αflox/flox CD11cre+, eIF2αΔAPC hereon) (Extended 
Data Fig. 5). eIF2αΔVillin mice exhibited enhanced weight loss and elevated Th17 response 
relative to littermate controls and eIF2αΔAPC mice exhibited enhanced Th17 responses 
(Extended Data Fig. 5), consistent with a recent report on a role for eIF2α in mediating 
protection against gut inflammation13. However these effects were more modest than those 
observed in GCN2−/− mice (Fig. 1), suggesting additional eIF2α independent mechanisms.

 Recent studies indicate a role for GCN2 in promoting autophagy7,14. Given its importance in 
regulating inflammation at mucosal sites15, we hypothesized that defective autophagy may 
mediate enhanced gut inflammation in GCN2−/− mice. We analyzed expression of the 
autophagy protein LC3 using a knock-in reporter strain16, and observed high LC3 
expression in colonic antigen presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells, which was 
indicative of constitutive autophagy (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To study the role of GCN2 in 
mediating autophagy at mucosal sites we generated GCN2-deficient autophagic reporter 
mice (GCN2−/− × LC3-GFP), and additionally examined expression of p62, another marker 
for autophagy. In naive mice, expression of both LC3 and p62 were similar in intestinal 
APCs and epithelial cells of GCN2−/− and littermates (Fig. 1j and k). However, we observed 
a significant increase in the number of LC3-GFP punctae in the crypts of wild type mice 
compared to the GCN2−/− mice following oral administration of DSS (Fig. 1j). Additionally, 
we observed that intestinal APCs and epithelial cells from GCN2−/− mice have lower levels 
of LC3B and p62 relative to cells from wild type mice (Fig. 1k; Extended Data Fig. 6b). To 
determine if the observed reduction in autophagy in GCN2−/− was due to impaired induction 
or enhanced degradation of autophagosomes, we assessed LC3B and p62 levels in intestinal 
APCs and epithelial cells from wild type or GCN2−/− with or without chloroquine, an 
inhibitor of autophagy degradation (Fig. 1k; Extended Data Fig. 6b). Blocking the 
degradation of autophagosomes with chloroquine in wild type mice resulted in greater 
accumulation of LC3B and p62 at 12hrs after DSS (Fig. 1k; Extended Data Fig. 6b). 
Importantly, the accumulated form (LC3B and p62) was significantly lower in GCN2−/− 
cells indicating reduced autophagy flux relative to wild type mice (Fig. 1k; Extended Data 
Fig. 6b). Similar results were observed at 24hrs, although chloroquine treated GCN2−/− mice 
displayed enhanced accumulation of LC3B and p62, albeit at lower levels than wild type 
mice (Fig. 1k; Extended Data Fig. 6b). The specificity of the LC3B antibody to LC3BII was 
confirmed using digitonin to specifically retain the membrane bound LC3II within cells 17 
(Extended Data Fig. 6 c and d).
These findings suggested that defective autophagy in intestinal cells may mediate enhanced 
inflammation in GCN2−/− mice. We therefore generated Atg5lox/lox CD11c cre (Atg5ΔAPC) 
and Atg7lox/lox CD11c cre (Atg7ΔAPC) mice that are conditionally deficient in autophagy 
proteins Atg5 and Atg7 in CD11c+ APCs (Extended Data Fig. 7). Upon treatment with 2% 
DSS both Atg5ΔAPC and the Atg7ΔAPC strains exhibited greater weight loss (Fig. 1l), 
enhanced shortening of colon length, Th17 responses and immunopathology (Extended Data 
Fig. 7) compared to the littermate controls, indicating a role for APC-intrinsic autophagy in 
regulating inflammation in GCN2−/− mice.
Autophagy can limit reactive oxygen species (ROS) abundance during colitis15, and 
impaired autophagy results in abnormal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress15, which 
is a characteristic feature of IBD18. Hence we studied the role of ROS in mediating DSS-
induced inflammation, using cell-permeant 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate 
(H2DCF-DA) a fluorescent probe that reacts with numerous types of ROS19. Following 
oxidation by ROS, the nonfluorescent H2DCFDA is converted to fluorescent 2', 7’-
dichlorofluorescein (DCF)19, which was detected in intestinal APCs and epithelial cells 
(Fig. 2a and Extended Fig. 8a and b) by flow cytometry. GCN2−/− mice exhibited 
significantly higher levels of ROS compared to littermate controls, indicating enhanced

 oxidative stress in the colon (Fig. 2a) and small intestine (Extended Fig. 8a and b). We also 
analyzed the levels of mitochondrial ROS in the large and small intestine using Mitosox, a 
flurogenic dye that specifically detects mitochondrial superoxide20. GCN2−/− mucosal cells 
produced excess mitochondrial ROS in comparison to the littermate controls in the colon 
(Fig. 2a) and small intestine (Extended Fig. 8a and b). To determine if autophagy regulated 
mitochondrial ROS we analyzed superoxide levels in colonic cells isolated from Atg5ΔAPC 
and the Atg7ΔAPC mice after DSS treatment. As in the GCN2−/− strain, there was higher 
production of mitochondrial ROS in Atg5ΔAPC and the Atg7ΔAPC mice compared to 
littermate controls (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, blockade of ROS via administration of the 
antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in vivo led to reduced disease severity, and reduction 
of Th17 responses in GCN2−/− mice (Fig. 2c-f). Thus, these data demonstrate a key role for 
ROS in mediating the enhanced inflammation observed in GCN2−/−.
Oxidative mitochondrial stress is known to be involved in the activation of the 
inflammasome pathway1,15. We therefore hypothesized that excess ROS enhanced 
inflammasome activation in the GCN2−/− cells under inflammatory conditions. GCN2−/− 
DCs produced excess amounts of cleaved IL-1β and cleaved caspases when subjected to 
amino acid starvation (Fig. 3a). Additionally, there was higher production of pro-IL-1β in the 
colonic macrophages and DCs isolated from the DSS-treated GCN2−/− mice in the large 
(Fig. 3b) and small intestine (Extended Fig 8b). In vivo blockade of IL-1β with a 
neutralizing antibody in GCN2−/− mice ameliorated the deleterious effects of DSS (Fig. 3c 
and d, Extended Fig 8c), and significantly reduced intestinal Th17 response (Fig. 3e). 
However, there were no detectable effects on histopathology, possibly due to incomplete 
neutralization of IL-1β (Extended Fig. 8c). Additionally, we observed that increased 
inflammation and Th17 responses in the GCN2−/− mice were negated by the deletion of 
inflammasome adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD 
(ASC) (Fig. 3f-i), demonstrating a clear role for inflammasome activation in mediating the 
enhanced inflammation in GCN2−/− mice.
Given the importance of GCN2 in sensing amino acid starvation, we hypothesized that mice 
fed an amino acid deprived diet might display enhanced activation of ISR in intestinal cells, 
resulting in dampened inflammation. Therefore we fed mice a reduced amino acid diet (2% 
protein/weight versus 16% in control mice) and observed rapid activation of p-eIF2α on 
intestinal APCs and epithelial cells (Fig. 4a). Intestinal cells isolated from wild type mice 
that were on low protein diet rapidly up regulated autophagy in comparison to those from a 
GCN2−/− deficient mice (Fig. 4b). Consistent with this, mass spectrometric analysis of free 
cytosolic amino acids revealed reduced levels of specific amino acids in colonic epithelial 
cells and APCs isolated from mice on 2% low protein diet, relative to the corresponding cell 
types from control mice, as well as in mice on DSS (data not shown).
Interestingly, diets lacking in selective amino acids can also preferentially activate the GCN2 
pathway21-23. We next asked whether lowering of proteins (2% protein) or selective 
depletion of individual essential amino acid like leucine (Leu−) impacted intestinal 
inflammation (Fig. 4). Thus wild type or GCN2−/− mice were fed amino acid restricted or 
control diets (16% protein) and subsequently challenged with 3% DSS in their drinking 
water (Fig. 4c-e). 3% DSS was administered in order to induce enhanced inflammation in

 wild type mice, so as to be able to reveal the putative protective effects of amino acid 
starvation on inflammation. Mice on protein restricted diets and normal diets had similar 
weights prior to DSS (Data not shown). Following DSS, wild type mice on protein-restricted 
diets weighed significantly less than those on control diet (Fig. 4c), but this was not the case 
in GCN2−/− mice, indicating that GCN2 protected against gut inflammation (Fig. 4c). The 
colon lengths and histopathology (epithelial integrity, cellular infiltration, crypt loss) were 
similar (Extended data Fig. 8e & data not shown). In contrast, mice on protein-modified 
diets showed a reduced incidence of “bloody diarrhea,” compared to control diet mice (Fig. 
4d). Remarkably, the frequencies of colonic Th17 cells were significantly lower in wild type 
mice on modified diet compared to mice on control diets (Fig. 4e). In contrast, there were no 
significant differences in the Th1 responses or regulatory T cells indicating that amino acid 
restricted diets selectively impair Th17 responses (Extended Fig. 8f). Notably, there were no 
differences in the Th17 frequencies among GCN2−/− mice on various diets indicating that 
this effect is GCN2 dependent (Fig. 4 e). Together these data demonstrate that amino acid 
starvation protects the symptoms of colitis and limits Th17 cells, via a GCN2-dependent 
mechanism.
In this study we demonstrate that GCN2 suppresses intestinal inflammation and Th17 
responses via a mechanism dependent on autophagy and sequestration of ROS, which is a 
trigger for inflammasome (Extended Fig. 9a). GCN2−/− mice displayed enhanced ROS and 
inflammasome activation, leading to increased inflammation and Th17 responses (Figs. 1 - 
3). Thus blockade of ROS and IL-1β led to lower inflammation and Th17 responses in 
GCN2−/− mice (Figs. 2 & 3). In addition, GCN2−/− mice were deficient in autophagy, which 
sequesters ROS, and consistent with this there was enhanced ROS and Th17 inflammation in 
Atg5ΔAPC and Atg7ΔAPC mice (Fig 1 & Extended Fig. 7). Future studies aimed at the 
functional reconstitution of a constitutively active autophagy pathway specifically in 
intestinal APCs and epithelial cells in GCN2−/− mice should provide greater insight into the 
extent to which the observed phenotype in GCN2−/− mice are due to impaired autophagy. 
Consistent with these results it is known that halofuginone, a compound that activates the 
amino acid starvation response (AAR), selectively inhibits mouse and human Th17 
differentiation24. Remarkably, we observed that low protein diet that activates the AAR 
pathway reduces the symptoms of colitis and colonic Th17 responses. Although prolonged 
protein deficiency impairs critical immune functions25, short term protein restriction can 
enhance immunity to pathogens26-28 and cancer29. Also, pharmacological activation of 
GCN2 protected mice against ischemia reperfusion injury30.
It is tempting to speculate on the evolutionary significance of coupling amino acid starvation 
with control of inflammation. Tissue injury and cell death, which occur during 
inflammation, inevitably, result in tissue regeneration. Tissue regeneration, in turn, is 
accompanied by protein synthesis, which could lead to amino acid depletion in the cytosol. 
The consequent activation of GCN2 will suppress inflammasome activation through the 
mechanisms described herein, in effect representing a negative feedback mechanism that 
limits the inflammation (Extended Fig. 9b). In summary, our results show a role for GCN2 
in protecting mice against intestinal inflammation. Thus targeting the GCN2 pathway may 
provide new strategies for the pharmacological intervention for the amelioration of IBD 
other inflammatory disorders.

Mice
GCN2−/− mice31 were provided by Dr. David Ron. The GCN2 floxed and PERK floxed 
mice32 were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, and bred on-site. To specifically delete 
GCN2 or PERK in APCs, floxed GCN2 mice (GCN2fl/fl) were crossed with CD11c-cre or 
villin-cre mice that express the cre enzyme under the control of CD11c promoter33 or villin-
promotor34, respectively, generating GCN2ΔAPC, GCN2Δvillin, PERKΔAPC and PERKΔvillin 
mice. eIF2α-Ser51Ala Tg (eIF2α floxed) mice were provided by Dr. Randal J Kaufman35, 
and crossed to CD11c cre and villin cre mice to obtain the conditional expression of 
nonphosphorylatable Ser51Ala mutant eIF2α in APCs or IECs. Successful cre-mediated 
deletion was confirmed by PCR and protein expression (FACS or Western blot) (Extended 
data Fig 10). LC3-GFP mice were generated by Dr. Noboru Mizushima, Tokyo Medical and 
Dental University, Japan36 and provided by Dr. Herbert Virgin, University of Washington, in 
St. Louis MO. These mice were crossed with GCN2−/− mice to generate GCN2−/− LC3-GFP 
mice.
Animal studies were conducted using age matched littermate controls for each experiment. 
Both male and female mice were used and were between 8-14 weeks of age at the time of 
experiments. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the Emory 
Vaccine Center vivarium. All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institute 
Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University.
Histology
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded murine intestinal tissue was sectioned (4 microns) 
and standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains were carried out to assess DSS-induced 
damage. Paraffin-embedded sections were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene, 
rehydration in graded series of ethanol, and rinsing with distilled water. The resident 
pathologist at Yerkes performed all histopathology analyses in a blinded manner.
Immunohistochemistry was performed by using labeled anti-mouse/anti-Rabbit/anti-goat 
biotin, antibody followed by streptavidin–alkaline phosphatase using a multistep staining 
protocol. All reactions were detected by development of the chromogen (Warp Red, Biocare 
Medical). Appropriate positive and negative controls were run in parallel. Post rehydration, 
slides were treated with a target retrieval solution (DIVA decloaker, Biocare Medical) and 
then steamed for antigen retrieval for 20 minutes and cooled for 20 minutes. The following 
primary antibodies were used for Immunohistochemical staining: Ki67 (#12202, Cell 
Signaling Technology, 1:200), Lysozyme (Sc-27956, Santa Cruz, 1:50), Chromagranin A 
(ab15160, Abcam, 1:200). Nuclei were counter stained using Gill's hematoxylin. Human 
sections from naive or inflamed colons (Pantomics, Cat No-COLO1& COLO2) were stained 
in a similar fashion with following primary antibodies: PERK (#T980, Cellsignaling 
Technology, 1:200), Phospho-GCN2 (ab32026,Abcam, 1:200),PKR(ab32036,Abcam,1:200), 
anti-IL-1β (ab9722, Abcam, 1:200).

 Isolation of intestinal APCs and lymphocytes
For epithelial and lamina propria (LP) lymphocyte isolation, mice were euthanized and the 
intestine was washed, cleaned of fat tissue and Peyer's patches, and longitudinally cut and 
suspended in 1× HBSS with 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT and 5 mM EDTA for 30 min at 
37°C. After washing with 1X HBSS, pieces were digested with collagenase VIII (Sigma) (1 
U ml−1 in RPMI with 2% FCS) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking (150 r.p.m.). Tissue was 
processed through a 100-μm-cell strainer, and the resulting suspension was pelleted. For 
lymphocyte isolation, cells derived following collagenase were resuspended in 7 ml of 40% 
Percoll and layered on top of 2 ml of 70% Percoll (GE Amersham). After centrifugation for 
15 min at 1,500 r.p.m without brakes, the middle layer was removed, washed in 2% FBS in 
RPMI and the lymphocytes were obtained. For LP DCs and macrophages, the collagenase-
digested cells were filtered through a 100-μm strainer and pelleted and stained. For cell 
sorting, APCs in this preparation were enriched with CD11c+ and CD11b+ magnetic beads 
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec) and sorted on FACS Aria at 
the Emory Vaccine Center flow cytometer core (BD Biosciences). For flow cytometry, cells 
were stained with a combination of the following fluorescence-conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies: phycoerythrin (PE)–Texas red conjugated anti-CD11b (Invitrogen), PE-Cy7 
conjugated anti-F4/80 (eBioscience), allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated anti-CD3 
(eBioscience), Pac Blue conjugated anti-CD11c (eBioscience), eFluor650NC conjugated 
anti-CD45 (eBioscience), PerCP-Cy5.5 conjugated anti-CD4 (eBioscience). For studying the 
levels of pro-IL-1β, cells were stained intracellular with antibody from affymetrix 
eBioscience (12-7114). Dead cells were excluded from analysis through the use of a LIVE/
DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on an LSR II 
(BD Biosciences) and were analyzed with FlowJo software (v9.2; TreeStar).
In vivo intestinal barrier function assays
Naive or 3 day-DSS treated wild type or GCN2−/− mice were fasted overnight, and FITC-
dextran (0.6 mg/g; Sigma) diluted in PBS was gavaged the following day. Fluorescence 
intensity of plasma samples was measured (excitation 485 nm/emission 535 nm) 4 h after 
gavage.
In vitro lymphocyte co-culture
FACS sorted LP APC subsets (1×105) were co-cultured with naive CD4+CD62L+ OT-II 
CD4+ Transgenic T cells (1×105) and OVA peptide (ISQVHAAHAEINEAGR; 2 μg/ml) in a 
total volume of 200 μl RPMI complete medium. The culture supernatants were analyzed 
after 72 h and cells were harvested and restimulated for 6 h with plate-bound antibodies 
against CD3 (10 μg/ml; 145.2C11 from Becton Dickinson) and CD28 (2 μg/ml; 37.51 from 
Becton Dickinson), in the presence of brefeldin A (Becton Dickinson) for intracellular 
cytokine detection (IL-17A and IFN-γ). For analysis of IL-17A and IFN-γ responses from 
freshly isolated LP, the percoll-purified lymphocytes from colon or small intestine were 
stimulated with PMA (100ng/ml) and ionomycin (1000ng/ml) for 4 h in the presence of 
GolgiPlug and then stained for intracellular IL-17A and IFN-γ for FACS analysis.

 Phospho-eIF2α staining by flow cytometry
Mice were orally gavaged with 2% DSS in 200μl volume. The LP cells were isolated and 
immediately fixed using the BD fixation solution for 10 minutes. Fixed cells were stained 
for intracellular p-eIF2α using a monoclonal antibody from Cell Signaling (3398). Cells 
were then stained with anti –Rabbit IgG-PE (Jackson labs, Cat No-111-116-144) at a 1:400 
dilution.
Gene Expression Analysis
Total RNA was extracted from gut samples using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (cat# 74104) 
according to manufacture's recommended protocol with on the column DNase- RNase free 
treatment. Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript Vilo cDNA synthesis kit 
(cat# 11754050) according the manufacture's protocol. An aliquot (10ng) of cDNA was used 
to quantitate Ang4 ((Mm03647554_g1), Lyz (Mm00727183_s1) and Reg3γ 
(Mm00441127_m1) on the ABI7900 system. GADPH (Mm99999915_g1) was used as the 
reference gene. The comparative gene expression method was used to determine the relative 
quantitation.
ROS and mitosox staining by flow cytometry
For detecting the ROS levels, the LP preparations were incubated with CM-H2DCFDA (10 
mM; C6827, Life Technologies), a cell permeable indicator for ROS. Following incubation 
the levels of fluorescence were measured by flow cytometry. For mitosox staining the LP 
preparation was incubated with mitosox (M36008, Life technologies) for 15 minutes 
(manufacturers instructions). Cells were then surface stained and analyzed by flow 
cytometry.
N-acetyl cysteine and anti-IL-1β treatment in vivo
For in vivo treatment, NAC (Sigma) was injected into mice i.p. (275mg/kg) in phosphate-
buffered saline solution, pH 7.4, every other day at days 1, 3, 5 and 7 post DSS. For in vivo 
IL-1β neutralizing experiments, 300 μg/mouse of anti-mouse IL-1β (BioXcell, Cat No-
BE0246) was injected i.p. on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 post DSS. Control mice received 300μg 
isotype control antibody (Hamster IgG, BioXcell BE0091) i.p.
Detection of LC3-GFP
Mice were euthanized, and intestines were fixed (3.7% formaldehyde for 3 min) and 
promptly washed with PBS. The tissue was fixed in formalin for an additional 12–18 h. 
Fixed tissue was embedded in OCT and sectioned on a cryotome into 6 μm sections. Slides 
were washed with PBS and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI 
(Invitrogen). Images of the sections were collected using LSM510 META confocal 
microscopy (Carl Zeiss). The z stack images were collected and the GFP signals were 
analyzed through the sections. Each individual crypt was analyzed in three dimension to 
reveal the number of LC3-GFP positive crypts using an Imaris 7 3D/4D an image processing 
and analysis software (Bitplane). Multiple crypts (5-7) were chosen from 3 different animals 
per group and the average mean LC3-GFP counts quantified per crypt using Imaris software 
7 (Bitplane).

 In vivo autophagy flux
In order to study autophagy flux we used choloroquine was used as a mode of inhibiting 
degradation of the components of the autophagosomes. Accumulated versus steady state 
form of the autophagosomes in wild type and GCN2−/− mice following oral administration 
of DSS (200 μl of 3% DSS) was compared. Chloroquine (10mg/kg) or saline was 
administered i.p. 2 hrs following DSS gavage and mice were sacrificed at 12 hours and 24 
hours post DSS treatment. The colons were cleaned, collagenase treated and the lamina 
propria preparation was quickly stained for various APC surface markers (CD11c, CD45, 
Epcam, MHC-II, CD11b) and intracellular levels of p62 (1:150) (H00008878-M01PE) and 
LC3B (1:150) (NB100-220F) to study the levels of intracellular autophagosomes. 
Intracellular staining was performed using BD perm buffer (BD Bioscience-554723) 
following fixation with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Bioscience-554714). In 
some instances the lamina propria was treated with digitonin (200μg/ml) for 10 min before 
undergoing intracellular staining.
Cytokine ELISA detection
IL-17, and IL- 1β in culture supernatants were quantitated by ELISA according to product 
protocol (R&D Systems Cat # DY42; BD Biosciences, Cat # 559603).
Dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis
Acute colitis was induced by adding 2% DSS (MW 36,000–50,000; MP Biomedicals, Solon, 
OH) to drinking water ad libitum for 7 consecutive days. Following the treatment mice were 
kept in normal drinking water for 3 more days. Mice were sacrificed and tissues analyzed for 
immune and histo-analysis. In addition, mice were orally gavaged with 200 μl of 2% DSS, 
thus minimizing the variation within a group owing to differences in the consumption of the 
drinking water. In the experiment involving protein restriction diets, mice wild type 
(littermate) or GCN2−/− mice were fed with 3% DSS to induce colitis in the wild type mice. 
3%, rather than 2% DSS was used to induce intestinal inflammation in wild type mice, in 
order to be able to detect any effect of a low protein diet in these mice.
Low protein mouse diet
The mice were fed with either test diet 5CC7 (1812281), baker amino acid defined diet (16% 
protein) or diet 5CC7 modified with 2% defined protein or no leucine (Test Diet Land O’ 
Lakes Purina Feed, St. Louis, MO).
Generation of murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells
Mice tibiae and femurs were flushed with ice-cold PBS through a 70μm cell strainer. Cells 
were pelleted and plated at a density of 5-7 × 106 bone marrow cells per 10 cm petri dish in 
(RPMI complete) in the presence of GM-CSF (20ng/ml, peprotech) and IL-4 (5ng/ml). At 
day 3, the cultures were supplemented with another 10 ml of RPMI complete + GM-CSF. At 
day 6, BMDCs were harvested by gently flushing the cells from the plate.

 In vitro activation of DCs
The BMDCs purified from wild type or GCN2−/− mouse tibia cultures were plated in 96 
well microculture plates (1×105 cells/well) and primed for 8h with 100ng/ml LPS 
(InvivoGen, LPSSM) in RPMI 1640 (US Biological; R8999-04A) plus 1% dialyzed FBS 
(Gibco 26400-036). Cultures were further stimulated for 1hr with ATP (5mM) (InvivoGen, 
tlrl-atp). Following the stimulation, cell supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-1β 
by ELISA or Western blot. Cell pellets were lysed and assayed for the presence of pro-IL-1β 
and pro-Caspase 1.
Western Blotting
Purified DCs (1×106) were lysed with 100-μl protein extraction reagent (89900, Thermo 
Scientific) containing protease inhibitor (5872S, Cell Signaling). Equal amounts of protein 
(lysate) or supernatants were run on an SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose 
membranes following electro blotting. After blocking with 5% fat-free milk, the membranes 
were incubated at 4°C overnight with the following primary antibodies: anti mouse pro & 
cleaved IL-1β (Cell Signaling, 12507), pro-caspase-1 (Abcam, ab108362), Caspase-p20 & 
10 (Adipogen-AG-20B-0042) as per manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were then 
washed was incubated with Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Cell 
Signaling). Proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate 
(34078, Thermo Scientific).
Statistical Analysis
To assess the significance of a difference between groups, a two-sample, unpaired t test was 
performed using Graph Prism software. A P value less than 0.05 (*) was considered to be 
significant, a P value less than 0.01 (**) was considered to be very significant, and a P value 
less than 0.001 (***) was considered to be extremely significant.

 Figure 1. GCN2 activation in APCs and epithelial cells suppresses intestinal inflammation by a 
mechanism dependent on autophagy
GCN2 deficiency leads to loss of body weight, colon shortening and enhanced production of 
IL-17 by colonic CD4+ T cells (a-c). Expression of GCN2 in epithelial cells (GCN2Δvillin) 
(d-f) or APCs (GCN2ΔAPC) (g-i) protects mice from DSS induced colitis. (j). LC3-GFP 
expression and the GFP punctae counts in the crypts (3D) from GCN2−/− LC3-GFP and 
LC3-GFP mice before and 12 hrs after DSS (k) Mean fluorescence Intensity (MFI) 
comparison of LC3B and p62 expression with and without chloroquine on APC subsets and 
epithelial cells by flow cytometry before and following 3% DSS administration. (l) 
Comparison of body weights of Atg5ΔAPC and Atg7ΔAPC mice to littermate controls 
subjected to acute 2% DSS-induced colitis. Data are representative of three separate 
experiments (n=5). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005, ***P < 0.0005. Error bars indicate mean 
±SEM., two-tailed unpaired student's t-test.

 Figure 2. GCN2 suppresses ROS activity and intestinal inflammation
(a) Histograms and MFI quantification of ROS and mitochondrial ROS in colonic APC 
subsets and epithelial cells isolated from wild type and GCN2−/− mice after 5 days of DSS. 
(b) Atg5ΔAPC and the Atg7ΔAPC compared to littermate before and after 5 days of DSS. 
NAC protects the GCN2−/− mice from weight loss (c), colon length (d), decreased pathology 
(e) and reduced colonic Th17 frequencies (f), induced by DSS. Data are representative of 
three experiments (n=5). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005, ***P < 0.0005. Error bars indicate mean 
±SEM.

 Figure 3. Enhanced intestinal inflammation in GCN2−/− mice is dependent on inflammasome 
activation
(a) Western blot analysis of pro-IL-1β, pro-caspase, cleaved IL-1β (p17) and cleaved caspase 
(p20) in lysate and culture supernatants of BMDC cultures of wildtype and GCN2−/− treated 
with LPS alone or LPS + Adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) (Potassium efflux agent that 
triggers inflammasomes) under amino acid starvation condition. (b) Quantification of MFIs 
of pro-IL-1β in colonic APC subsets in GCN2−/− and littermates following DSS. (c-e) Body 
weight (c), colon length, and colonic Th17 responses (e) in DSS treated GCN2−/− mice 
treated with anti-IL-1β antibody or isotype control. (f-i) Comparison of body weight (f), 
colon length (g), histology (h) and Th17 frequencies between littermates, GCN2−/−, ASC−/− 
and GCN2−/− ASC−/− mice subjected to DSS induced colitis. Data are from one experiment 
representative of three separate experiments n=(4-5). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005, ***P < 
0.0005. Error bars indicate mean ±SEM.

 Figure 4. Dietary restriction of amino acids can partially protect against DSS induced colitis
(a) Expression of p-eIF2α on APC subsets and epithelial cells from wild type mice on 2% 
protein diet (b) Kinetics of LC3B-GFP expression after 2% protein diet in colonic APC 
subsets and epithelial cells isolated from GCN2−/− LC3-GFP and LC3-GFP mice. (C) Mice 
on modified protein diet are protected from DSS induced colitis. (c) Weight loss (d) percent 
of animals having bloody diarrhea and (e) colonic Th17 responses, in 3% DSS induced wild 
type or GCN2−/− mice that were on protein modified diets (2% protein diet or leucine 
deficient diet) compared to control diet (16%). Data are from of two separate experiments 
that were then pooled. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.005, ***P < 0.0005. Error bars indicate mean 
±SEM.
