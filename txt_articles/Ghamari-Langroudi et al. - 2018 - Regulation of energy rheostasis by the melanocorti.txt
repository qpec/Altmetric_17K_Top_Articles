Like most homeostatic systems, adiposity in mammals is defended between upper and lower boundary conditions. 
While leptin and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) signaling are required for defending energy set point, mecha-
nisms controlling upper and lower homeostatic boundaries are less well understood. In contrast to the MC4R, 
deletion of the MC3R does not produce measurable hyperphagia or hypometabolism under normal conditions. 
However, we demonstrate that MC3R is required bidirectionally for controlling responses to external homeostatic 
challenges, such as caloric restriction or calorie-rich diet. MC3R is also required for regulated excursion from set point, 
or rheostasis, during pregnancy. Further, we demonstrate a molecular mechanism: MC3R provides regulatory inputs 
to melanocortin signaling, acting presynaptically on agouti-related protein neurons to regulate -aminobutyric 
acid release onto anorexigenic MC4R neurons, exerting boundary control on the activity of MC4R neurons. Thus, 
the MC3R is a critical regulator of boundary controls on melanocortin signaling, providing rheostatic control on 
energy storage.
INTRODUCTION
Adipose stores in mammals are tightly regulated and defended 
during nutritional challenges, indicating existence of a mechanism 
that maintains energy stores near a set point. The molecular mecha­
nisms underlying the control of energy stores between upper and 
lower homeostatic boundaries are incompletely understood. The cru­
cial role of the melanocortin­4 receptor (MC4R) neuronal pathway 
in regulating energy homeostasis was established both pharmaco­
logically (1) and genetically (2). MC4R homozygous and heterozy­
gous knockout (KO) mice (2), as well as humans (3), present with early 
onset severe obesity associated with hyperphagia, reduced auto­
nomic outflow and energy expenditure (EE), and significantly re­
duced response to the adipostatic hormone leptin. Hence, the MC4R 
acts at the heart of the adipostat, regulating both energy intake and 
expenditure, and is essential for establishing energy set point. In con­
trast, disruption of the MC3R produces no measurable hyperphagia 
or hypometabolism in mice or rats under normal conditions (4–6). 
MC3R is primarily expressed in the brain in a relatively small set of 
nuclei that are largely nonoverlapping with expression of the MC4R 
(7, 8), a critical site being the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and 
agouti­related protein (AgRP) neurons of the arcuate nucleus (9, 10).
While mild late­onset obesity is observed in the MC3R KO 
mouse and rat, there are seemingly conflicting physiological find­
ings, such as a striking increase in susceptibility to weight loss in ex­
perimental models of cachexia in the MC3R KO mouse (11, 12). 
This is in stark contrast to the MC4R KO mouse, which is protected 
from anorexia and weight loss relative to wild­type (WT) animals 
in numerous cachexia paradigms (11–14). A second observation is 
that MC3R KO mice exhibit defective responses to fasting or food 
restriction (15) and exhibit defective food anticipatory activity (16), 
suggesting a defect in the function of the orexigenic AgRP neurons 
in MC3R KO. Further, reduced activation of AgRP and neuropep­
tide Y (NPY) gene expression during fasting was demonstrated in 
these models (15, 17). Finally, attempts at selective activation of the 
MC3R using a moderately MC3R­selective agonist, d­Trp8­­MSH, 
also produced paradoxical findings in both mice (18) and rats (19): 
stimulation of food intake. To better understand the role of the 
MC3R in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeosta­
sis, we have examined the control of feeding, energy accumulation, 
and EE in MC3R KO versus WT mice in response to a variety of 
orexigenic and anorexigenic challenges. To build a model of the mo­
lecular basis for the role of MC3R in response to these stressors, 
we have used slice electrophysiology to determine the actions of 
MC3R on downstream paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus 
(PVN) MC4R target neurons, as this circuit is critical for the regu­
lation of feeding and energy homeostasis (20).
RESULTS
Physiological responses to nutritional state affected by loss 
of the MC3R
As demonstrated previously, MC3R KO mice showed normal ad 
libitum feeding that was not significantly different from WT mice 
when monitored at 6, 12, and 24 hours after the beginning of a dark 
phase (4, 5), while we also observed the hyperphagia resulting from 
deletion of the MC4R (Fig. 1A). A defect in 24­hour refeeding was 
seen in the MC3R KO mouse (Fig. 1B), as reported previously (15); 
the reduced food intake persisted for up to 5 days (Fig. 1C), and 
cumulative food intake did not return to WT levels until 10 days 
after a 36­hour fast (Fig. 1D).
We next examined the effects of caloric restriction (CR) on body 
weight in the MC3R KO mouse. Animals were calorie restricted to 
70% of their own average daily ad libitum energy intake for a period 
of time until the lean WT mice lost 30% of their original body weight 
(~25 days). MC3R KO mice lost significantly more of their body 
weight during the same period (~36%), showing that MC3R KO mice

libitum food intake of C57BL/6J WT, MC3R KO, and MC4R KO mice on normal chow at 6, 12, and 24 hours, following lights off. In contrast to hyperphagia shown by MC4R KO mice 
(n = 6), MC3R KO (n = 13) showed normal feeding compared to WT [n = 12; two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (B) Time course of refeed-

test). (C) Kinetics of daily food intake after a 36-hour fast. Daily food intake was suppressed in MC3R KO mice from hour 16 to day 4 of refeeding (WT, n = 12; MC3R KO, n = 13; two-way 
ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). ns, not significant. (D) Cumulative food intake in the same cohort, showing a deficit in energy homeostasis sustained for up to 9 days 
(two-way ANOVA and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). (E) Average body weight changes (means and SEM) of MC3R KO (n = 12) and WT (n = 11) mice in response to CR (gray), 
followed by ad libitum chow (white), HFD (blue), and then ad libitum chow (white). MC3R KO mice lost significantly more weight than WT mice during CR (P < 0.001) and gained 
more than WT mice on HFD (P < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (F) Indirect calorimetry measuring EE of WT and MC3R KO mice in control condi-
tions, in response to a 24-hour period of fasting (shaded area) and to injection of saline, followed by ad libitum refeeding beginning with a dark cycle. (G) MC3R KO mice had signifi-
cantly higher EE than WT animals during the light cycle in both fed and fasted states (Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). In contrast to WT mice, MC3R KO mice failed to suppress EE 
in response to fasting (P > 0.05; two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (H) The EE of MC3R KO was not different than WT mice during the dark cycle in any meta-
bolic state (P > 0.05; Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). (I) Serum TT4 of MC3R KO (n = 17) and WT (n = 18) mice in basal fed state and after fasting for 36 hours. The serum TT4 is not 
significantly different in MC4R KO and WT mice in basal fed states (WT, 4.28 ± 0.16 g/dl; KO, 4.1 ± 0.15 g/dl; P < 0.5). Fasting fails to cause suppression of the TT4 levels in MC3R KO mice 
(4.1 ± 0.15 g/dl in fed to 3.9 ± 0.17 g/dl during fasting; P > 0.05), as opposed to WT mice (4.28 ± 0.16 g/dl in fed to 3.0 ± 0.09 g/dl in fasting). The serum TT4 levels in MC3R KO 
fasted mice was significantly higher than in WT fasted mice (WT fasted mice, 3.0 ± 0.09; KO fasted mice, 3.9 ± 0.17 g/dl; two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).

24% of their body weight during the same period (P < 0.05 from days 20 to 25; multiple t test). Convention used throughout: ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.

are unable to appropriately conserve energy when subjected to cal­
orie restriction (Fig. 1E).
Upon termination of CR, we allowed mice ad libitum access to 
chow and observed an initial rapid weight gain. After 1 week, WT 
and MC3R KO mice reached new steady­state body weights, suggest­
ing the achievement of an energy set point. However, while the WT 
lean mice maintained their body weight slightly above their pre­CR 
values (+3.69 ± 0.82%), MC3R KO mice reached a new steady­state 
body weight significantly less than their pre­CR values (−8.53 ± 
0.88%). After their body weights were stabilized, we then fed the 
WT lean and MC3R KO mice a high­fat diet (HFD) (60% kcal 
fat; Research Diets) for a period of 30 days. Data show that WT lean 
mice reached a new body weight 16% higher than their pre­HFD weight. 
In contrast, MC3R KO mice gained weight at a much faster rate, 
reaching a point 29% higher than their initial body weight (Fig. 1E). 
When the diet was again switched back to regular chow, both groups 
of mice lost some of the weight they gained during HFD feeding. How­
ever, the weight loss was significantly more pronounced for MC3R 
KO mice (~22%) compared to WT lean mice (~15% of peak body 
weight). Thus, MC3R KO mice exceed the normal boundaries of 
weight loss during CR, defend a reduced set point on chow refeed­
ing, and exceed the normal boundaries of regain compared with WT 
mice when given energy­rich chow.
Since MC3R KO mice fed with equal calories lost more weight 
than WT littermates during CR, we hypothesized that they must 
have higher EE than matched WT mice. To test this hypothesis, we 
individually housed WT and MC3R KO mice, which were matched 
for lean mass, in indirect calorimetry chambers (Fig. 1F). During 
the light cycle, we observed that EE was slightly higher in MC3R KO 
mice compared to WT mice in the fed state [area under the curve 
(AUC), 4.97 ± 0.08 (WT) versus 5.56 ± 0.079 (MC3R KO); Fig. 1G]; 
no significant effects were seen in the dark cycle (Fig. 1H). EE in 
WT mice was suppressed during fasting, but no effect of fasting 
on EE was observed in MC3R KO mice (Fig. 1G). EE in mammals 
is suppressed during fasting in part through suppression of the 
hypothalamic­pituitary­thyroid (HPT) axis (21). To address a possible 
role of thyrotropin­releasing hormone PVN neurons, known to ex­
press MC4R (22), in dysregulation of the HPT axis, we also mea­
sured serum levels of thyroid hormone [total T4 (TT4)] in response 
to 36 hours of fasting in WT and MC3R KO mice (Fig. 1I). TT4 was 
not significantly different in MC3R KO and WT mice in basal fed 
states (WT, 4.28 ± 0.16 g/dl; KO, 4.1 ± 0.15 g/dl). As expected, 
fasting caused significant suppression of the TT4 levels in WT mice 
(3.0 ± 0.09 g/dl). However, fasting failed to cause suppression of 
the TT4 levels in MC3R KO mice (3.9 ± 0.17 g/dl). The EE and 
TT4 findings collectively indicate dysregulation of EE in response 
to nutritional challenges in MC3R KO mice, which is in parallel to 
defects shown above in the control of feeding. These defects in food 
intake and EE can explain changes in body weight (Fig. 1E) and 
point to a defect in constraining both weight loss and weight gain 
upon loss of the MC3R. Thus, the MC3R does not appear necessary 
for maintenance of set point per se but for regulation of the upper 
and lower boundaries of set point, suggesting a role in rheostasis or 
the regulated movement of set point (Fig. 1J).
MC3R is expressed in multiple brain nuclei (8) but is known to be 
expressed in the melanocortin circuits proper—the AgRP and POMC 
neurons found in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) 
(9). To test the role of the MC3R specifically in the ARC in the pheno­
types described here, we knocked down MC3R gene expression by 
bilateral ARC­specific injection of lentivirus expressing short hair­
pin RNA (shRNA) against this gene or a scrambled control se­
quence into C57BL/6J mice. We validated the effectiveness of the 
virus in knocking down MC3R mRNA in human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) 293 cells transfected with an MC3R expression vector (fig. 
S1A) and the efficacy of the viral injections into the ARC by post hoc 
analysis of viral green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in ARC 
and an adjacent uninjected site (fig. S1, B and C). We then conducted 
postfast refeeding studies as in Fig. 1 (C and D) in these animals. Mice 
injected with lentiviral particles expressing shRNA against MC3R 
were unable to refeed as efficiently as mice injected with control virus 
for up to 7 days after ad libitum refeeding began (Fig. 1K). MC3R 
shRNA–expressing mice failed to compensate for the energy deficit 
for up to 13 days of refeeding (Fig. 1L). Furthermore, upon 70% 
calorie restriction as described previously (Fig. 1E), MC3R shRNA–
expressing mice lost about 30% (29.6 ± 0.98%) of their body weight 
compared to control shRNA–injected mice that lost about 24% of 
their body weight during the same period (Fig. 1M). These data sup­
port a role of MC3R specifically expressed in ARC neurons in medi­
ating the homeostatic responses shown here.
MC3R regulates miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents 
in PVN MC4R neurons
We used slice electrophysiology to probe the role of the MC3R in 
the function of these circuits. We previously characterized effects of 
­MSH (alpha­melanocyte­stimulating hormone) and AgRP on 
various parameters of cellular excitability, such as membrane poten­
tial and the intracellular signaling pathways involving postsynaptic 
MC4R in PVN neurons (23–25). In addition to these effects on post­
synaptic membrane current, we noted that applications of melano­
cortins such as ­MSH can also increase the synaptic activity in 
PVN MC4R neurons, suggesting a potential effect involving pre­
synaptic melanocortin receptors, perhaps including MC3R.
We thus sought to examine whether ­MSH modulates the 
frequency or amplitude of action potential–independent, tetrodo­
toxin (TTX)–resistant miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents 
(mIPSCs) recorded from MC4R­expressing PVN neurons in acute 
hypothalamic slices (26). We performed whole­cell recordings by 
using CsCl­ 
filled patch electrodes from voltage­clamped neurons 
held at −70 mV to examine effects of ­MSH on the frequency 
and amplitude of mIPSCs in brain slices pretreated with TTX, AP5 
(d,l­2­amino­5­phosphonopentanoic acid), and NBQX (2,3­dihydroxy­ 
6­nitro­7­ 
sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline), the blockers of fast Na+ 
channels, AMPA and NMDA (N­methyl­d­aspartate) receptors, 
respectively. After recording baseline activity, ­MSH was bath­ 
applied for 8 to 13 min and then washed out by switching to control 
solution (for example, Fig. 2A). We then measured and compared 
the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs recorded in control solu­
tion, with ­MSH in the bath and after washout. Results showed that 
­MSH significantly and reversibly increased the mean frequency 
(from 3.2 ± 0.42 Hz in control to 4.8 ± 0.6 Hz in peptide; Fig. 2, A to 
C), but not the amplitude (Fig. 2D), of mIPSCs in MC4R PVN neu­
rons compared to control or wash. The cumulative probability dis­
tribution of the frequency [interevent intervals (IEIs)] of mIPSCs 
was also significantly different in ­MSH compared to control con­
dition (IEI; from 336.0 ± 6.0 ms in control to 185.4 ± 2.2 ms in 
peptide; Fig. 2E). ­MSH failed to affect the mean or the cumulative 
probability distribution of the peak amplitude of mIPSCs when 
compared to control (Fig. 2F). We observed no effect of ­MSH on

the presynaptic release of glutamate onto MC4R neurons, which 
was determined by recording frequency and amplitude of excitatory 
postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; fig. S2).
It is possible that ­MSH acting on postsynaptic MC4R neurons 
causes the release of retrograde neurotransmitters that act on presynap­
tic sites to increase ­aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. Since both 
endocannabinoids and nitric oxide are known to function as retrograde 
neurotransmitters, we pretreated brain slices with and included in the 
external recording solution either 10 M AM251, a cannabinoid type 1 
receptor blocker, or 100 M l­NAME (NG­nitro­l­arginine methyl 
ester), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. These treatments failed to affect 
the basal frequency of mIPSCs recorded from MC4R PVN neurons 
or the ­MSH–induced increase in frequency of mIPSCs (fig. S3).
MC3R mRNA is expressed in ARC AgRP/NPY neurons (9), and 
data suggested that MC3R may regulate release of GABA from 
AgRP terminals synapsing onto POMC neurons (27). We thus tested 
whether the ­MSH–induced increase in the frequency of mIPSCs 
in MC4R PVN neurons required MC3R by generating MC4R­GFP × 
MC3R KO and MC4R­GFP × MC4R KO mice. We then examined 
effects of ­MSH on the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs re­
corded from PVN MC4R neurons in these mice. ­MSH failed to 
increase the mean and cumulative probability distribution of mIPSC 
frequency (Fig. 2, G and I) recorded from MC3R KO mice but did 
so in MC4R KO mice (Fig. 2, H and J), demonstrating the role of the 
MC3R in this phenomenon.
Since AgRP neurons are GABAergic, we investigated effects of 
deletion of AgRP neurons on GABAergic inputs recorded from 
PVN neurons. By crossing MC4R­GFP to mice expressing the diph­
theria toxin (DT) receptor (DTR) under the control of the AgRP 
promoter (28), we generated MC4R­GFP mice that express DTR 
selectively in AgRP neurons. We then treated mice with two intra­
peritoneal injections of DT (50 g/kg, at day 0 and day 2), resulting 
in a significant reduction in ARC AgRP neuron numbers (fig. S4). 
As reported previously, deletion of AgRP neurons by DT injections 
causes anorexia and weight loss. We then measured and compared 
the frequency of mIPSCs at day 1, days 5 and 6, and days 7 and 8 
after injections (Fig. 2K). The average basal frequency of mIPSCs 
recorded from PVN MC4R neurons in control condition was sig­
nificantly diminished by deletion of AgRP neurons. The mIPSC 
frequency recorded at days 7 and 8 (mean ± SEM, 1.3 ± 0.2 Hz), 
when mice have lost about 25 to 30% of their original body weight, 
was significantly smaller than at day 1 (3.24 ± 0.32 Hz) or than at 
days 5 and 6 after injection (2.67 ± 0.34 Hz). Furthermore, although 
­MSH significantly increases the mIPSC frequency in day 1 (from 
3.24 ± 0.32Hz in control to 5.40 ± 0.55 Hz in peptide), this peptide 
fails to affect the frequency of these events when tested at days 5 and 
6 (from 2.67 ± 0.34 Hz in control to 3.66 ± 0.48 Hz in peptide) or 
days 7 and 8 (from 1.31 ± 0.20 Hz in control to 1.73 ± 0.42 Hz in 
peptide). At least half of the basal inhibitory activity recorded from 
PVN neurons thus appears to originate from AgRP neurons in ARC; 
all of the ­MSH–inducible increase in IPSC frequency appears to 
require intact AgRP neurons. These data demonstrate that presynaptic 
MC3R in AgRP neurons exert inhibitory feedback on the POMC­MC4R 
circuit by regulation of GABA release onto MC4R neurons (Fig. 2L).
MC3R modulates the in vivo response to anorexigenic 
melanocortin agonists
Since slice electrophysiology demonstrated a role for MC3R in reg­
ulating PVN MC4R neurons, we next sought to examine the regula­
tion of MC4R­mediated responses in vivo in the presence and ab­
sence of the MC3R, following exogenous administration of an 
­MSH analog. We chose a stable and potent peptide analog of 
­MSH, LY2112688, as this peptide is a full agonist of MC3R and 
MC4R and can produce MC4R­dependent inhibition of food intake 
following peripheral administration (29). Following a 24­hour fast, 
mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with vehicle or LY2112688 
(10 mg/kg) and given chow ad libitum, 30 min before the onset of 
the dark phase. We then measured food intake at 1, 4, 12, 18, and 
24 hours (Fig. 3A). LY2112688 caused comparable suppression of 
food intake in both MC3R KO and WT mice at 1 hour of feeding 
compared to vehicle (P < 0.05). However, the LY2112688­induced 
inhibition of food intake was significantly greater in MC3R KO mice 
than in WT mice at all time points measured after 1 hour. Thus, 
much as MC3R KO mice exhibited lack of appropriate responses to 
the orexigenic stimulus of a fast, they also exhibited a prolonged res­
ponse to the anorexigenic stimulus of administration of an ­MSH

anorexigenic activity in vivo in the absence of the MC3R. LY2112688 
caused an increase in EE compared to saline in WT and MC3R KO 
mice, which were matched for lean mass (Fig. 3, B and C). However, 
the LY2112688­induced increase in EE was almost 3× greater in 
MC3R KO mice than in WT animals (Fig. 3D), also suggesting de­
fective restraint of MC4R effects on EE.
Reproductive state alters physiological responses in the 
MC3R KO mouse
Changes in reproductive state also represent an internal challenge 
to the maintenance of energy stores. For example, the increased en­
ergy demands of pregnancy result in significant changes in energy 
intake and storage; this regulated escape from established to new 
homeostatic set points is referred to as rheostasis (30). Mice are 
known to exhibit a ~50% increase in daily food intake during preg­
nancy, and thus, WT and MC3R KO pregnant mice were analyzed 
for food intake and body weight changes during gestation. MC3R 
KO female animals showed a significant blunting of daily food in­
take (Fig. 4A) during the middle stage of pregnancy, between days 7 
and 12 (Fig. 4B). Analysis of the entire pregnancy shows a sustained 
reduction in cumulative food intake (Fig. 4C). When compared to 
nonpregnant­matched genotype controls, both WT and MC3R KO 
animals showed a significant increase in food intake during preg­
nancy (Fig. 4D); however, MC3R KO animals showed a blunted 
increase in food intake in comparison to WT pregnant controls 
(Fig. 4D). This alteration in food intake does not elicit a detectable 
difference in total body weight change throughout pregnancy bet­
ween genotypes (Fig. 4E); however, when adipose mass is carefully 
measured near the end of pregnancy, WT animals exhibit an in­
crease in fat mass, while no pregnancy­induced increase in adipose 
mass is seen in the MC3RKO (Fig. 4F). Another rheostatic increase 
in energy stores associated with reproductive state often occurs during 
menopause. Modeling this using ovariectomy in the mouse, in con­
trast to the decreased fat storage during pregnancy, we observed 
a much greater increase in adipose mass in MC3R KO versus WT 
mice (fig. S5). Thus, both deficient and excessive changes in adipose 
mass as a function of reproductive state may be observed in the 
MC3R KO.
DISCUSSION
Unlike mutations in leptin or melanocortin­4 signaling genes, 
MC3R deletion does not produce measurable hyperphagia or hy­
pometabolism on normal chow, and the mild body composition 
phenotypes seen in these mice have been viewed as defective energy 
partitioning rather than defective energy homeostasis (4–6, 15). 
However, MC3R KO animals do not exhibit normal homeostatic 
responses and, as shown here, exhibit excursions from energy set 
point in either direction when challenged with either internal or 
external nutritional stressors. Fasting reduces serum leptin and po­
tently activates the AgRP neurons (31), yet the MC3R KO mouse 
exhibits defective behavioral (feeding), autonomic (EE), and neuro­
endocrine (HPT axis) responses to this strong orexigenic signal. 
While MC3R KO mice appear to defend set point and maintain 
constant body weight relatively well on normal chow, CR or high­
fat chow produces greater weight loss or weight gain, respectively, 
compared to WT mice (Fig. 1E). Hence, the MC3R KO exhibits de­
fective energy rheostasis; when animals are unperturbed, energy set 
point is relatively well maintained, but anorexigenic or orexigenic 
challenges highlight weak homeostatic boundary controls in these 
animals, resulting in excessive weight loss or weight gain.
­MSH–induced GABA release has been demonstrated previ­
ously in a number of different brain regions but never in the context 
of MC3R regulation of MC4R mIPSC. An ­MSH–mediated in­
crease in IPSCs in POMC neurons was shown previously and pro­
posed to involve presynaptic MC3R, but POMC neurons do not 
express MC4R (27). Fu and van den Pol (32) showed that both 
MC4R and MC3R agonists increased IPSCs in neurons in the 
ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), but the VMH 
cells were randomly selected and unlikely to be MC4R neu­
rons, as they demonstrated no postsynaptic responses to ­MSH. 
Bagnol et al. (9) published the first paper showing that MC3R was 
coexpressed in POMC and AgRP neurons and hypothesized the ex­
istence of an MC3R­mediated inhibition of MC4R neuronal activity 
purely from anatomical principles. Thus, together, the data provided 
here finally prove a long­ 
standing hypothesis: MC3R, functioning 
presynaptically on AgRP neurons, facilitates the release of GABA 
onto MC4R neurons to inhibit their activity. Since knockdown of 
MC3R mRNA in the ARC reproduces the defective refeeding and 
enhanced loss of weight in response to an energy deficit, this specific 
result is not a developmental consequence of MC3R loss and must 
involve primarily MC3R expressed in AgRP and POMC neurons of 
the ARC. The increased responsiveness to melanocortin adminis­
tration fits well with a model (Fig. 2L) in which anorexigenic stimu­
li resulting from the activation of POMC neurons and release of 
­MSH, followed by engagement of MC4R in sites such as the PVN, 
may ultimately be inhibited by ­MSH engagement of MC3R on 
AgRP termini, known to be found overlapping with POMC termini 
in many brain regions containing MC4R (9). Aside from one ana­
tomical study showing that POMC boutons in the PVN exhibit 
both synaptic and nonsynaptic architecture and that POMC syn­
pases in the PVN tend to be concentrated on distal dendrites while 
AgRP neuronal synapses tend to be concentrated on somata (33), 
we simply do not have enough anatomic or kinetic data to make 
many predictions regarding the spatial or temporal mechanisms by 
which ­MSH engages the MC4R and MC3R in regions such as the 
PVN. For example, while our electrophysiological data show that 
MC3R is acting presynaptically and MC4R postsynaptically in the 
PVN, we do not yet have ultrastructural data showing the precise 
subcellular localization of MC3R or MC4R proteins.
Previous research has shown that MC3R KO mice also exhibit a 
partial defect in activation of AgRP and NPY gene expression in the 
ARC in response to a fast, via an unknown mechanism (15, 17), and 
this is likely to be a component of the defective responses to nutri­
tional deficit shown here and reported previously (15, 17). However, 
analysis of AgRP neuron­specific deletion of AgRP, NPY, or the ve­
sicular GABA transporter Vgat shows that NPY and GABA can each 
independently mediate the acute feeding response to AgRP neuro­
nal activation (34). Pharmacological blockade of either GABA or 
NPY in the PVN can inhibit feeding induced by optogenetic stimu­
lation of AgRP axon terminals in the PVN (35). Further, GABA ag­
onists alone, injected into the parabrachial nucleus, can rescue feeding 
in animals in which AgRP neurons have been ablated (36). Thus, 
the importance of GABA release by AgRP neurons in the control of 
food intake and energy homeostasis is indisputable, and it is likely 
that in the absence of the MC3R, the AgRP neurons have a general 
defect in fasting­induced activation that extends to the release of 
GABA as well. Further, the finding of a defective fasting­induced

refeeding response following knockdown of MC3R just in the ARC 
(Fig. 1, K and L) also argues that this defect may be cell­autonomous; 
that is, loss of MC3R in AgRP neurons makes these cells less res­
ponsive to fasting­induced activation. The mechanism for this re­
mains to be determined.
The role of MC3R in regulating GABA release from AgRP neu­
rons argues for a molecular mechanism underlying control of lower 
homeostatic boundary conditions, in that activation of MC4R neurons 
by POMC­derived ­MSH undergoes MC3R­dependent inhibitory 
feedback. This may explain the increased and prolonged inhibition 
of feeding, the excessive EE seen in MC3R KO mice in models of 
melanocortin agonist administration (Fig. 3), and perhaps the en­
hanced cachexia reported in MC3R KO mice (11, 37). MC3R in 
ARC is also required for normal rebound from a drop in energy 
stores, as in fasting or CR, and activation of MC3R neurons in ARC 
using DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer 
drug) technology produced profound hyperphagia and weight gain 
(fig. S6); however, the mechanisms here may be more complex, 
involving defects in up­regulation of AgRP and NPY gene ex­
pression along with defects in GABA release resulting from loss of 
the MC3R.
Mechanism(s) by which MC3R prevents excursion beyond up­
per homeostatic boundary conditions following high­fat feeding or 
ovariectomy remain to be tested. Two potential mechanisms could 
involve MC3R on either AgRP or POMC neurons. AgRP is a high­ 
affinity MC3R antagonist, and thus, autofeedback inhibition of 
AgRP neurons via AgRP binding to MC3R on presynaptic termi­
nals of these cells is possible. In addition, ­MSH released from 
POMC neurons might act in a feed­forward mechanism on presyn­
aptic POMC MC3R sites to increase the activity of these anorexi­
genic neurons. However, it is important to remember that MC3R is 
expressed in many brain regions beyond the ARC, and again using 
DREADD technology, we show that activation of MC3R neurons 
in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) inhibits food 
intake (fig. S6). Thus, the loss of MC3R from PVT neurons might 
remove an important anorexigenic input from outside the ARC. 
These data also argue that the bidirectional regulation of rheostasis 
by the MC3R is likely to involve MC3R neurons beyond the ARC 
(Fig. 4G).
MC3R KO animals show a significant deficit in cumulative food 
intake during the middle phase of pregnancy and a defect in total 
energy accretion during pregnancy compared with WT animals. 
MC3R KO animals also show a nondepot­specific accumulation of 
fat stores that is significantly greater than that observed in WT 
animals following ovariectomy, thus again highlighting energy 
stores that can diverge above or below normal levels, depending 
on the challenge. POMC and AgRP fiber densities show extensive 
overlap in many forebrain regions, including reproductive control 
centers, such as the ventral premammillary nucleus, anteroventral 
periventricular nucleus, and gonadotropin­releasing hormone 
neurons. Thus, it is expected that the MC3R­mediated regulatory 
feedback loop that we have identified for MC4R PVN neurons 
is functional in many other brain regions receiving POMC and 
AgRP projections.
Changes in reproductive state, such as pregnancy and meno­
pause, involve the regulated movement from one energy set point to 
another, sometimes referred to as energy rheostasis in the agricul­
tural literature (30), and these data further argue for a physiological 
role for MC3R in the regulation of rheostasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal strains
MC3R KO, MC4R KO, and MC4R­GFP strains have been described 
previously (2, 5, 26) and maintained continuously by regular back­
crossing onto C57BL/6J mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. 
MC3R­Cre mice are reported here for the first time. Mice containing 
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA constructs expressing 
Cre recombinase under the control of the MC3R promoter were cre­
ated in the Vanderbilt Transgenic Mouse Resource. Briefly, a DNA 
fragment containing a Cre recombinase sequence with kozak con­
sensus and polyadenylation signal, followed by a FRT­flanked tetra­
cycline resistance cassette from pFTet­129, was recombined at the 
ATG codon of the MC3R, using a 177­kb BAC cassette (BAC RP24­
181G19) containing 125­kb 5′ and 50­kb 3′ to the single­ 
 
coding exon 
Mc3r gene. The FLP (flippase recombinase) target (FLT) flanked Tet 
cassette was removed by FLP expression in bacteria, and the final 
BAC vector was shown to match predicted restriction digests by both 
a pulsed­field gel and standard “fingerprint” gel and by sequencing of 
all recombination junctions. Multiple transgenic lines were created 
and characterized by comparing the distribution of GFP immunore­
activity in the MC3R­GFP mouse with the distribution of TdTomato 
in MC3R­Cre tg/wt;TdTomato fl/wt. GFP distribution in MC3R­
GFP mice was determined to represent bona fide sites of MC3R ex­
pression by dual in situ hybridization of MC3R mRNA and GFP 
mRNA using RNAscope. The MC3R­Cre mouse used in these stud­
ies exhibited matching distribution of immunoreactivity with the 
MC3R­ 
GFP mouse in ARC, PVT, nucleus accumbens, and ventral 
tegmental area, all sites of known MC3R mRNA expression.
Food intake studies
All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee or the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use 
Committee. WT male C57BL6/J mice were obtained from the Jackson 
Laboratory. Upon arrival, mice were single­housed and allowed to 
acclimatize at 22° to 24°C with a 12­hour light/12­hour dark cycle 
with standard chow and water provided ad libitum for 1 week. 
Unless otherwise described, all mice were fed a standard chow diet 
(S­5LOD, 13.5% kcal fat, 32.98% kcal protein, and 56.7% kcal car­
bohydrate; LabDiet). Diet­induced obesity was promoted by HFD 
(D12492, 60% kcal fat, 20% kcal protein, and 20% kcal carbohydrate; 
Research Diets). Food pellets were provided in a dish, and in­
take was measured manually, taking care to include all crumbs left 
in the dish.
CR experiments
MC3R KO, MC4R KO, and WT mice were individually caged start­
ing at 8 weeks of age. Starting at 16 weeks of age, the food intake and 
body weight of the mice were monitored daily for 2 weeks. The av­
erage food consumed per mouse of each genotype was calculated, 
and this amount is referred to as the average food intake (AvFI). 
Next, mice were provided 70% of AvFI every day 1 hour before dark 
cycle (30% calorie restriction–30% CR).
Indirect calorimetry
Indirect calorimetry was performed by the Vanderbilt Mouse Met­
abolic Phenotyping Center (DK059637) using the Promethion system 
(Sable Systems International). Mice were individually housed at a 
standard 12­hour light/12­hour dark cycle. The Promethion system

allows continuous (at 5­min intervals) VO2, VCO2, physical activi­
ty, food intake, and body weight measurements. The body compo­
sition of the mice was measured before they were placed into the 
metabolic chambers and at the completion of the study. After 3 days 
of acclimation in the metabolic chambers, mice were fasted for 
24 hours before receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline 30 min 
before the dark cycle. Mice were provided ad libitum access to chow 
at the beginning of the dark cycle. Three days after the first fast, 
mice were fasted for a second time for 24 hours and then received 
intraperitoneal injections of LY2112688 (10 mg/kg; #H­6268, Bachem) 
before the dark cycle. Food was provided at the beginning of the 
dark cycle. The average of 12 5­min measurement points collected 
per hour was used to calculate hourly EE.
TT4 measurements
Total serum T4 was measured in fasted and fed mice with enzyme­ 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; AccuDiag T4 ELISA Kit cata­
log #3149­18). Four to five drops of blood were collected by facial 
vein puncture and allowed to clot in microfuge tubes for 30 min at 
room temperature. Clot was removed by centrifugation (2000g for 
10 min at 4°C), and serum was flash­frozen for further analysis ac­
cording to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Preparation of lentiviral vectors
Mouse MC3R­specific shRNA clones in a pLKO.1 vector were pur­
chased from Sigma­Aldrich. Scrambled shRNA in pLKO.1 was from 
Addgene (plasmid #1864). pLL3.7 was a gift from T. Nakagawa, 
Vanderbilt University and available at Addgene (plasmid #11795). 
An Xho I fragment of pLKO.1 containing the shRNA sequence was 
subcloned into a pLL3.7 vector digested with Xho I. HEK 293T cells 
were transfected with pLL3.7 (containing the shRNA for MC3R or 
scrambled shRNA), together with pRSV­REV, pVSVG, and pMDL. 
Forty­eight hours later, the supernatants were collected and filtered 
through a 0.45 M filter. Lentiviral particles were precipitated by 
ultracentrifugation at 26,000 rpm at 4°C for 2 hours. The pellets were 
resuspended in 100 l of phosphate­buffered saline (PBS). Viral 
titers were determined by the number of GFP­positive HEK 293T 
cells 48 hours after infection of cells with serial dilutions of the 
virus stocks.
DREADD viral injections
Stereotaxic viral injections of adeno­associated viral vectors (AAVs) 
expressing Cre recombinase–dependent expression of hM3Dq 
[AAV5­Ef1a­DIO­hM3D(Gq)­mCherry, Addgene) or mCherry 
(AAV5­Ef1a­DIO­mCherry, Addgene) were performed in adult 
MC3R­Cre mice (8 to 12 weeks old). Littermate mice were random­
ly assigned to experimental (DREADD­injected) or control groups 
(mCherry­injected) before viral injections. For viral injections, mice 
were anesthetized with isoflurene vapor and placed in a stereotaxic 
frame (Kopf). Small burr holes were made above either the arcuate 
nucleus or the PVT. A micromanipulator (Narishige) attached to a 
pulled micropipette (Drummond Scientific Company) was used to 
deliver viral vectors at a rate of 0.2 l/min. A total of 30 to 50 nl of 
virus was injected unilaterally into either the arcuate nucleus [coor­
dinates from bregma: anterior/posterior (A/P), −1.4; medial/lateral 
(M/L), 0.2; dorsal/ventral (D/V), −5.85 from brain surface] or the 
PVT (coordinates from bregma: A/P, −1/1; M/L, 0.0; D/V, −2.6 
from brain surface). Injection needles were left in place for 10 min 
following viral injections to prevent leakage of virus. Three weeks 
were allowed following viral injections and before behavioral exper­
iments to allow full viral expression.
Chemogenetic feeding assays
All chemogenetic feeding assays were performed on ad libitum fed 
mice during either the light period or the dark period of the light 
cycle. All mice were single­caged and handled daily for 1 week be­
fore feeding assays. Food intake was measured manually following 
intraperitoneal injections of sterile saline (0.9%, 200 l) or clozapine 
N­oxide (CNO; 0.1 mg/kg, 200 l; Enzo Life Sciences). Saline and 
CNO were administered randomly in a counterbalanced order, and 
average food intake following saline or CNO administration was 
calculated for each mouse for statistical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry and imaging
Cardiac perfusion was performed in all mice following chemoge­
netic experiments. Mice were perfused with 1× PBS, followed by 
10% formalin. All brains were postfixed overnight in 10% formalin, 
followed by 20% sucrose in 1× PBS. Brain sections (30 m) throughout 
the arcuate nucleus and PVT were prepared using a cryostat (Leica). 
Immunofluorescence imaging for mCherry was performed to con­
firm correct viral targeting in all mice injected with chemogenetic 
constructs. All mice without viral infection or viral infection targeted 
outside of ARC or PVT were excluded from analysis.
For cfos immunostaining, mice were injected with CNO (0.1 mg/kg 
ip, 200 l) or sterile saline (0.9%, 200 l) 30 min before perfusion. 
Brain sections were blocked for 1 hour in blocking buffer consisting 
of 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma­Aldrich) in 1× PBS with 0.1% 
Tween 20. Sections were then incubated overnight in primary anti­
bodies prepared in blocking buffer. Primary antibodies used included 
rabbit anti­cfos (1:5000; Calbiochem), goat anti­AgRP (1:200; R&D 
Systems), and chicken anti­GFP (1:1000; Abcam). Following pri­
mary antibody incubation, sections were washed three times for 10 min 
in 1× PBS, and secondary antibody prepared in blocking buffer was 
applied for 2 hours. Secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 594 
donkey anti­rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti­goat, and Alexa 
Fluor 488 donkey anti­chicken (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Following incubation with secondary antibody, brain sections were 
washed with 1× PBS (3× washes for 10 min each) and mounted onto 
glass slides. To quantify cfos levels, cfos­positive cells were manual­
ly counted from sections containing viral infection in either arcuate 
nucleus or PVT. For each mouse in each experimental condition 
(saline or CNO), cfos was quantified from 5 to 10 sections, and an 
average number of cfos­positive cells was calculated for each mouse 
for statistical analysis.
Hypothalamic slice electrophysiology
MC4R­GFP mice were previously characterized by dual immuno­
histochemistry and in situ hybridization to validate the observation 
that GFP­positive neurons in the PVN expressed MC4R RNA. Male 
and female MC4R­GFP mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflu­
rane before decapitation. The brain was entirely removed and 
immediately submerged in ice­cold, gassed (95% O2 and 5% CO2) 
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), containing 126.2 mM NaCl, 
3.1 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM 
NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, and 11 mM sucrose [320 mosmol/kg 
(pH 7.39) when gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at room tempera­
ture]. Coronal brain slices of 200­m thickness were then cut and 
transferred to a glass beaker containing oxygenated aCSF at 31°C.

After an incubation period lasting at least 1 hour, a slice was trans­
ferred to a recording chamber (~2.0 ml in volume). To record from 
miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs), whole­cell recordings were performed 
using patch pipettes of 3.4­ to 5­megohm resistance when filled with 
a solution containing 125 mM K gluconate, 8 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 
10 mM Hepes, 5 mM NaOH, 4 mM Na2ATP, 0.4 mM Na3GTP, 
5 mM Na2–creatine phosphate, 7 mM sucrose, and 7 mM KOH, which 
resulted in a pH ~7.23 and osmolality of 295 to 300 mosmol/kg. 
Recordings from mIPSCs were obtained using patch pipettes of 
2.5­ to 4­megohm resistance when filled with a solution containing 
121 mM CsCl, 4 mM MgCl, 3 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 mM 
CaCl2, 4 mM NaATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, 14 mM creatinine phos­

700A amplifier (2000× gain; −3­dB filter frequency, 5 kHz) and 
Clampex 10.0.1 software (Axon Instruments). GraphPad Prism 6.0 
(Graphpad Software Inc.) and Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp.) were 
used for data analysis.
Deletion of AgRP neurons for slice recording
AgRP DTR mice, provided by R. Palmiter (28), were crossed to 
MC4R­GFP mice. The male offspring heterozygous for DTR and 
GFP of both sexes were then injected ip with DT (50 g/kg) twice on 
the mornings of day 0 and day 2. Brain slices for electrophysiolog­
ical analyses were prepared on the mornings of the days indicated in 
Fig. 2K. Body weight was monitored daily throughout the study.
Body composition
Whole­animal body composition analysis was performed using the 
Minispec Model mq7.5 (7.5 mHz; Bruker Instruments), which is a 
benchtop­pulsed 7­T NMR system. The instrument gives lean mass, fat 
mass, and fluid mass values. MC3R KO and WT female animals sub­
jected to sham surgery or ovariectomy were analyzed at 14 to 16 weeks 
of age, and WT and MC3R KO pregnant and nonpregnant controls 
were analyzed at pregnancy day 18 or equivalent.
Melanocortin administration
Male mice of each genotype were divided into two subgroups, 
and each subgroup was given either vehicle (100 l of saline) or 
LY2112688 (10.0 mg/kg) in 100 l of saline ip half an hour before 
the beginning of the dark phase.
Food intake and body weight measurements  
during pregnancy
WT and MC3R KO females were paired with WT males overnight, 
and the presence of a vaginal plug was documented as pregnancy 
day 1. After verification of a vaginal plug, WT and MC3R KO dams 
were individually housed. Food intake and body weight were as­
sessed daily.
Surgical ovariectomy
Female mice 8 to 9 weeks in age were subjected to ovariectomy as 
previously described (38). Briefly, mice were laid on their ventral 
surface with their tail toward the surgeon. A small midline incision 
was made on the dorsal surface midway between the base of the tail 
and the middle of the back. In a point lateral to the paraspinous 
muscles, the peritoneal cavity was punctured, and the ovary was 
then pulled through the incision by grasping the periovarian fat 
pad. A hemostat was clamped around the uterine vasculature be­
tween the oviduct and uterus. The ovary and a small part of the 
oviduct were then removed with a single cut. The hemostat was 
then removed, and the remaining tissue was reinserted into the 
peritoneal cavity via the entrance incision. The ovary on the contra­
lateral side was then removed in a similar matter. The skin incision 
was sealed with Vetbond, and the animals were returned to warm 
cages for postoperative care. Four to six weeks after surgery, ani­
mals were euthanized, and tissue was collected for analysis.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. The 
number of samples and the statistical tests used in each experiment 
are described in the figure legends.
