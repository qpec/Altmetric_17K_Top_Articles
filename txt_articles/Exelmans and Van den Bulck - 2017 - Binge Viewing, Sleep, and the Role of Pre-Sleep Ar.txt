Study Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of binge viewing, its association with sleep and examine arousal as an underlying mechanism of this 
association.
Methods: Four hundred twenty-three adults (aged 18–25 years old, 61.9% female) completed an online survey assessing regular television viewing, binge 
viewing, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale), insomnia (Bergen Insomnia Scale), and pre-sleep arousal 
(Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale). Regression analyses were conducted. Mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS Macro.
Results: There were 80.6% who identified themselves as a binge viewer. Among those who binge viewed (n = 341), 20.2% had binge viewed at least a few 
times a week during the past month. Among poor sleepers (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5), 32.6% had a poor sleep quality associated with being a binge 
viewer. Higher binge viewing frequency was associated with a poorer sleep quality, increased fatigue and more symptoms of insomnia, whereas regular 
television viewing was not. Cognitive pre-sleep arousal fully mediated these relationships.
Conclusions: New viewing styles such as binge viewing are increasingly prevalent and may pose a threat to sleep. Increased cognitive arousal functions as 
the mechanism explaining these effects. Measures of media exposure should take into account the user’s level of engagement with media. Interventions aimed 
at (1) alerting viewers about excessive viewing duration and (2) reducing arousal before sleep may be useful ways to tackle sleep problems in binge viewers.

INTRODUCTION
The way we watch television has dramatically changed over 
the past decades. New technologies such as digital recorders 
and streaming services have ended the era of appointment 
viewing: 63% of American households use a streaming ser-
vice,1 and the use of digital video recorders and the Internet 
increased the amount of viewing in college students.2 The un-
precedented access to television content has also introduced a 
new viewing style: binge viewing, defined as watching mul-
tiple episodes of the same series in one sitting.3 Statistics in-
dicate that binge viewing is on the rise: 3 out of 4 respondents 
in the study by Sung et al. self-identified as a binge viewer,4 
and research showed that 70% of television viewers between 13 
and 49 years old binge viewed at least sometimes.5 In general, 
viewers are increasingly watching television in larger doses at 
a time of their choosing.
The term binge viewing hints at an overindulgence or ad-
diction regarding television viewing, and concerns have been 
raised over its harmful effects. Prior research has indicated 
that media bingeing was associated with more anxiety, depres-
sion, and fatigue.6,7 Binge viewers also reported higher levels of 
loneliness and depression.4 Although some researchers worry 
that binge viewing may lead to a reduction in social skills in 
the long term,6,8 binge viewers also reported the behavior has a 
social value: the ability to participate in conversations about a 
show with friends creates a sense of belonging.5,9,10
Despite the growing popularity of binge viewing, the phe-
nomenon has received little scholarly attention thus far. In

sleep research, it is recognized that screen exposure negatively 
affects sleep. For television viewing, findings have been in-
consistent: a review study indicated that 32 of 42 studies that 
examined television viewing and sleep outcomes found signifi-
cant negative associations.11 Conversely, Bartel and colleagues 
found television viewing not to be a significant risk factor for 
sleep.12 Most of the research on this topic focuses on regular 
viewing volume. To our knowledge, this study is the first to 
investigate the association between binge viewing and sleep.
Dworak and colleagues posited that excessive media con-
sumption would negatively affect sleep,13 and research found 
that watching television for more than 2 hours per day in-
creased sleep onset delay among children.14 Considering that 
binge viewing signifies an intense or more extreme viewing 
BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Whether regular television 
viewing has much effect on sleep is debated. New viewing patterns, 
such as binge viewing, in which consumers watch an excessive 
amount of television in one sitting, have, however, not been studied. 
There is also a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism of 
the association between technology use and sleep.
Study Impact: The current study shows binge viewing is prevalent 
among young adults and is the first to demonstrate a link with poorer 
sleep quality, more fatigue, and increased insomnia. Importantly, 
the mechanism explaining this relationship appears to be increased 
cognitive arousal, resulting from binge viewing. Although this has 
been explained by viewers’ higher level of engagement with the 
television show, future research should verify this hypothesis.

L Exelmans and J Van den Bulck. Binge Viewing, Sleep, and Pre-Sleep Arousal
habit, we expect that binge viewing will negatively affect sleep 
outcomes.
Addressing the call for more research into the underlying 
mechanisms explaining the relationship between media use 
and sleep,15,16 this study will explore arousal as an explana-
tory factor (ie, mediator) of the aforementioned relationship. 
In addition to displacing sleep and affecting melatonin output, 
screen exposure is presumed to affect sleep through its effect 
on arousal.15 The existing research has found that playing video 
games increased activity in the central and autonomic nervous 
system, which in turn prolonged sleep onset.13,17,18 One recent 
study reported that cognitive pre-sleep arousal mediated the 
relationship between social media use and sleep onset latency.19 
Although it has been argued that these results can be extrapo-
lated to other media platforms,14,20 evidence of this hypothesis 
is scarce.
The limited literature on binge viewing provides some in-
dications to propose arousal as a mediator of the relationship 
with sleep. Television shows that are binge viewed are char-
acterized by a complex narrative structure and intense char-
acter development. Binge viewers become strongly immersed 
into the story, identify with the characters, and experience 
increased difficulty to stop viewing.10,21,22 In other words, be-
cause of the higher emotional and cognitive involvement dur-
ing binge viewing, we expect that binge viewing will affect 
sleep through its effect on arousal. In summary, we formulate 
two research questions:
• RQ1: Does binge viewing affect sleep (ie, sleep quality, 
fatigue, insomnia)?
• RQ2: Is arousal a significant mediator of the 
relationship between binge viewing and sleep?
METHODS
Sample and Procedure
Arnett identified “emerging adults,” the group of 18- to 
25-year-olds between adolescence and adulthood, as a group 
particularly sensitive to risk behaviors.23 As young adults are 
also often considered to be the most avid binge viewers,5 18- to 
25-year-olds were invited to participate in an online survey in 
February 2016. A call for participation was disseminated via 
Facebook postings that highlighted the topic of the research 
project and the voluntary nature of participation. The study 
was presented as a study on young people’s leisure time and 
well-being to blind the relationships we were studying. Anony-
mous participation was guaranteed. The study was conducted 
in accordance with the ethics requirements of the Social and 
Societal Ethics Committee of the KU Leuven, and informed 
consent was obtained from all respondents.
A total of 463 questionnaires were completed. Respondents 
who reported that they had a clinical history of sleep problems 
(ie, who indicated they had consulted a doctor regarding sleep 
difficulties, n = 40) were dropped from the analyses, resulting in 
a final sample of 423 respondents. There was a higher propor-
tion of women (61.9%), and 74.2% of respondents were students, 
23.0% was working, and 2.8% were unemployed. Respondents’ 
average age was 22.17 years (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86).
Measures
Sleep Quality
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)24 is a 19-item self-
report measure that assesses sleep quality over the past month. 
The index consists of 7 component scores (sleep duration, 
subjective sleep quality, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, sleep 
disturbances, daytime dysfunction, use of sleep medication) 
ranging between 0 and 3, with a higher score indicating more 
problems in that component. An overall sleep quality score is 
computed, and respondents scoring higher than 5 are catego-
rized as poor sleepers. The index showed acceptable internal 
consistency (α = .60).
Insomnia
The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS)25 is composed of 6 items 
measuring how frequently respondents experienced different 
symptoms of insomnia during the past month (0 = 0 days per 
week over the last month, 7 = every day over the last month). A 
total score was computed, ranging between 0 and 42. Cronbach 
alpha (α) for the BIS was .76.
Fatigue
We used the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS),26 consisting of 
10 items that describe symptoms of daytime fatigue experi-
enced during the past month, rated on a 5-point scale (1 = never, 
5 = always). The total scores ranges between 0 and 50 and the 
scale showed good internal consistency (α = .87).
Pre-Sleep Arousal
We assessed pre-sleep arousal using the Pre-Sleep Arousal 
Scale.27 The scale taps into somatic (eg, heart racing, pound-
ing, or beating irregularly) and cognitive (eg, being mentally 
alert, active) manifestations of arousal experienced when try-
ing to fall asleep, with 8 items in each subscale. Respondents 
rated on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely) how 
intensely they experienced each element during the past month 
as they attempted to fall asleep. The scale has been broadly 
used and shows satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest 
reliability.27–30 Validity has been demonstrated for populations 
with insomnia versus good sleeper controls.27 Both subscales 
(αsom = .73; αcog = .88 ) showed good internal consistency in our 
sample.
Binge Viewing
Appendix 1 in the supplemental material shows our opera-
tionalization of binge viewing, which is based on previous re-
search.4 The first question was a screening question to identify 
binge viewers in the sample. Because there is considerable in-
consistency in the number of episodes that are required before 
the literature defines a session as a “binge,” 31 we provided a 
definition of binge viewing as “watching multiple consecutive 
episodes of the same television show in one sitting on a screen, 
be it a television, laptop, computer or tablet computer screen.” 
Those who identified themselves as a binge viewer continued 
to answer questions about their frequency of binge viewing 
during the last month (1 = once during the past month, 5 = (al-
most) every day), the duration of an average binge viewing

session (hours and minutes), and the number of episodes they 
usually watched (2, 3–4, 5–6, more than 6).
Control Variables
We incorporated sex (0 = male, 1 = female), age, status (1 = stu-
dents living on campus, 2 = students living at home, 3 = full 
time employment, 4 = part-time employment, 5 = unem-
ployed), shiftwork (0 = no, 1 = yes), perceived physical health 
(“In general, would you say your health is: 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 
3 = good, 4 = very good, 5 = excellent”),32 exercise level (“how 
many hours per week do your exercise to the extent of becom-
ing out of breath?”), and bedtime television viewing volume 
as control variables. For bedtime television viewing volume, 
respondents reported how much (hours and minutes) television 
they usually watched during the final 2 hours before bedtime 
on an average weekday and an average weekend day. Weekly 
bedtime television viewing volume was computed by multiply-
ing weekday volume by 5 and adding it to the weekend day 
volume multiplied by 2.33
Analyses
SPSS for Windows (Version 22.0, Chicago, Illinois, United 
States) was used to execute all analyses. Descriptive statistics 
and zero-order correlations were computed, and regression 
analyses (hierarchical and logistic) were conducted. Hayes’ 
PROCESS computational tool with 5,000 bootstrap samples 
was used to test the proposed mediation hypothesis.34,35 The 
results are represented as bias-corrected confidence intervals: 
95% confidence intervals that do not contain zero indicate a 
significant indirect or mediating effect.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics and correlations are reported in Table 1. 
Most of the sample (80.6%) reported that they had binge viewed. 
Among those who binge viewed (n = 341), 39.6% did this once 
during the month preceding the study, 28.4% a few times, 11.7% 
once a week, 13.5% a few times a week, and 6.7% had binge 
viewed almost every day during the preceding month. They 
spent 3 hours and 8 minutes on a binge viewing session on 
average (mean = 3.14, SD = 1.63). Men (mean = 1.01, SD = 1.38) 
binge viewed less frequently than women (mean = 1.46, 
SD = 1.91) (t(314.43) = −2.469, P < .05), but binge viewing ses-
sions lasted longer among men (mean = 3.50, SD = 1.68) com-
pared to women (mean = 2.93, SD = 1.57) (t(235.361) = 3.077, 
P < .01). Binge viewing frequency and duration were nega-
tively related (r = −.144, P < .01): the more frequently one had 
binge viewed during the past month, the less time they spent on 
a binge viewing session. Finally, one in four (25.6%) watched 
on average of 2 episodes per binge viewing session, one in two 
(52.4%) watched 3 to 4 episodes in one sitting, 16.2% watched 
5 to 6 episodes, and 5.9% watched more than 6 episodes in one 
sitting.
The sample scored on average 5.04 (SD = 2.35) on the PSQI, 
which borders on the cutoff point for having poor sleep qual-
ity. More than one in three respondents (37.4%) were catego-
rized as a poor sleeper. Respondents went to bed at 11:32 pm 
(SD = 1:04) and got up at 8:11 am (SD = 1:28). On average, 
they slept 7 hours, 37 minutes (SD = 1:02). Sleep quality was 
positively related to all other sleep indicators: a poorer sleep 
quality was thus associated with more symptoms of fatigue, 
insomnia, and pre-sleep arousal (Table 1).
Those who identified as a binge viewer reported more fa-
tigue (meanbinge = 12.58, SDbinge = 6.30; meannon-binge = 10.73, 
SDnon-binge = 5.76; t(130.633) = −2.549, P < .05) and poorer sleep 
quality (meanbinge = 5.14, SDbinge = 2.35; meannon-binge = 4.60, 
SDnon-binge = 2.32; t(117.592) = −1.845, P = .068) compared to 
those who had never binge viewed. Logistic regression analy-
ses showed that those who identified as a binge viewer had a 
98% higher likelihood of having poor sleep quality compared 
to those who did not identify as a binge viewer (Exp(B) = 1.981, 
P < .05). Attributable risk, which is an epidemiological indi-
cator reflecting the difference in prevalence of a phenomenon 
between the exposed and the nonexposed group,36 was 32.6%. 
A PSQI score higher than 5 could thus be attributed to binge 
viewing in almost one in three cases.
Binge viewing frequency was positively associated with all 
sleep indicators, whereas binge viewing duration did not have 
a significant relationship with our sleep variables. Binge view-
ing frequency was also positively associated with cognitive 
pre-sleep arousal, but there was no relationship with somatic

L Exelmans and J Van den Bulck. Binge Viewing, Sleep, and Pre-Sleep Arousal
pre-sleep arousal (Table 1). In hierarchical regression analyses 
(Table 2) control variables were added in Step 1, and binge 
viewing frequency was added in Step 2. Results show that 
those who binge viewed more frequently reported a poorer 
sleep quality (β = .145, P < .01), more daytime fatigue (β = .131, 
P < .05), and more symptoms of insomnia (β = .161, P < .01). 
Bedtime television viewing volume was not a significant pre-
dictor of these sleep indicators.
Mediation analyses were performed using PROCESS macro. 
Cognitive pre-sleep arousal was used as a mediator, and all of 
the control variables were taken into account (Table 3). Results 
showed that binge viewing frequency was significantly related 
to cognitive pre-sleep arousal (Model PSQI: β = .133, P < .05; 
Model FAS: β = .122, P < .05; Model BIS: β = .135, P < .05) and 
that cognitive pre-sleep arousal was strongly related to each 
sleep indicator (Model PSQI: β = .589, P < .001; Model FAS: 
β = .462, P < .001; Model BIS: β = .565, P < .001). Cognitive 
pre-sleep arousal fully mediated the relationship between binge 
viewing and sleep quality (effect size = .078; Boot SE = .033; 
95% CI [.014; .145]), daytime fatigue (effect size = .056; Boot 
SE = .027; 95% CI [.008; .110]), and insomnia (effect size .077; 
Boot SE = .032; 95% CI [.014; .137]). In other words, the more 
frequently respondents binge viewed, the more cognitive pre-
sleep arousal they reported, which in turn affected their sleep 
quality, daytime fatigue, and insomnia symptoms.
DISCUSSION
Consuming television content in larger bursts instead of, or in 
addition to, regular daily viewing is an increasingly common 
practice. Although extensive research has been carried out on 
the effects of television viewing on sleep, no earlier study ex-
ists that explicitly investigates the association between binge 
viewing and sleep. Moreover, there is little understanding of 
how media exposure affects sleep. The current study, there-
fore, examined the relationship between binge viewing and 
sleep outcomes (sleep quality, fatigue, insomnia) and explored 
the role of arousal as an underlying mechanism.
Approximately 80% of our participants considered them-
selves to be a binge viewer, and one in five respondents (20.2%) 
had binge viewed at least a few times a week in the month pre-
ceding the study. This prevalence of binge viewing is congruent 
with that found by Sung and colleagues, who researched a sim-
ilar American age group.4 Additionally, the results showed that 
(1) a higher frequency of binge viewing was related to poorer 
sleep quality, more fatigue, and insomnia, and (2) cognitive 
pre-sleep arousal fully mediated these relationships. Cognitive 
pre-sleep arousal thus appeared to be the explanatory mecha-
nism for the effects of binge viewing on sleep. These results 
are consistent with those of Harbard and colleagues who found 
that cognitive pre-sleep arousal mediated the relationship be-
tween social media use and sleep.19
Only cognitive pre-sleep arousal was a significant mediator, 
whereas somatic arousal was not. A possible explanation might 
be that binge viewing leads to a stronger sense of involvement 
into the narrative and identification with its characters than 
does regular viewing. This would also explain why regular 
bedtime television viewing was not related to our sleep indica-
tors or arousal measure. The narrative structure that character-
izes “bingeable” television shows involves (1) a larger number 
of (2) more diverse storylines that (3) extend beyond one epi-
sode, and that often (4) intersect during a season or (5) turn 
out to be connected with each other in the end.37,38 As such, the 
narrative complexity in these shows leaves viewers thinking 
about episodes and their sequel after viewing them. This pro-
longs sleep onset or, in other words, requires a longer period to 
“cool down” before going to sleep, thus affecting sleep overall.

L Exelmans and J Van den Bulck. Binge Viewing, Sleep, and Pre-Sleep Arousal
Whether the increase in cognitive pre-sleep arousal can be at-
tributed to the higher degree of involvement with the content is 
an interesting avenue for future research.
Our results may shed new light on the fact that the findings 
on the effects of television viewing on sleep have been some-
what inconsistent,11 and a recent meta-analysis by Bartel et al. 
concluded that in comparison with other media such as video 
games and computer use, television viewing is not a signifi-
cant risk factor for sleep.12 Different types of television content 
and different types of television viewing behavior are likely to 
have different effects on sleep. Our study suggests that intense 
exposure leads to cognitive arousal. It would be interesting to 
study whether, for instance, relaxing media content does the 
opposite.
In a broader sense, we think this study signals a need to 
move beyond a focus on “how much” people are using media 
and incorporate measures on usage styles and experience. It 
is interesting to note that although television viewing has un-
dergone a remarkable transformation, the ways of measuring 
television viewing have not. One recommendation could be to 
incorporate people’s media habits: the definition of “watching 
a lot” can vary strongly between individuals. Wagner found 
that among respondents who regularly watch only a little televi-
sion, binge watching ignited more guilt compared to those who 
watch a lot of television habitually.31 What qualifies as a “binge” 
can thus vary strongly between individuals. Accounting for the 
length of shows or identifying concrete cutoff scores for binge 
viewing that take into account viewing history are challenges 
for future research. In addition, repeated exposure to arousing 
media content can also lead to habituation of physiological and 
emotional reactions, which is often associated with so-called 
“desensitization.” These differences in how people react to 
media content may explain the differences in effects on sleep. 
For instance, King et al. hypothesized that violent video games

L Exelmans and J Van den Bulck. Binge Viewing, Sleep, and Pre-Sleep Arousal
may elicit only minimal effect on sleep parameters among older 
adolescents and adults because they have grown accustomed to 
these stimuli by more frequent exposure.39
Relevance and Guidelines
Our exploratory, cross-sectional design and the modest size of 
the beta coefficients mean that recommendations based on our 
conclusions have to be cautious and tentative. However, our 
study signals that binge viewing is prevalent in young adults 
and that it may be harmful to their sleep. Research has also 
shown that binge viewing signifies an overall passive or sed-
entary lifestyle,8 which in turn has been associated with in-
creased health risk and sleep problems.40,41 Curiously, binge 
viewing appears to be unintentional: reports indicate that 71% 
of binge viewing happens by accident, when people wound up 
watching more than they wanted to.42 De Feijter and colleagues 
argued that the first step to avoid viewing too much television 
is to become aware of short- and long-term viewing behavior. 
They suggested implementing a system—such as an app—that 
allows viewers to determine their optimal viewing duration, 
such that the viewer can engage with the content, without 
leading to a disconnect between the intended and actual view-
ing time. According to their research, optimal viewing time 
is generally passed after 5 episodes.8 Some online streaming 
services already alert viewers when a number of consecutive 
episodes have been watched.
Also, because the relationship between binge viewing and 
sleep was fully mediated by pre-sleep arousal, interventions 
and treatments aimed at reducing arousal before sleep (such as 
relaxation techniques and mindfulness)43 can be valuable ap-
proaches to target sleep problems associated with media use.
Strengths and Limitations
As is the case with all cross-sectional studies, we cannot de-
termine causality, thus making the reversed hypothesis (ie, 
that poor sleep leads to increased binge viewing) also possible. 
However, the observation that binge viewing appears to be un-
intentional behavior,8 and the support found for the temporal 
order of the mediation model (in which sleep outcomes were 
preceded by arousal, which was predicted by binge viewing) 
strengthens the hypothesized direction of the effects.
We conducted this research in a sample of younger Face-
book users. Even though we did not explicitly state the focus of 
the study, recruitment through Facebook may have introduced 
self-selection bias. This caveat, and the restricted age group of 
this study, hinders the generalizability of the results. Although 
an online survey via social networks ensures the privacy of 
our respondents, we had no control over the respondents par-
ticipating and increased the odds of tapping into groups of 
people with similar interests. Nonetheless, social media has 
been found to be a useful tool for exploratory studies on a 
new topic, aimed to investigate young people, an age group 
known to be active on social media.44 A study on personal-
ity factors compared data gathered through Facebook with (1) 
online data from a large-scale web survey and (2) data from 
an online study among university students, and concluded that 
Facebook data are unlikely to exhibit systematic biases. In 
all, our sample may thus be non-representative but appears to 
represent those young adults who consume a lot of television 
(ie, a “risk group.”)45
Although we used clinically validated sleep measures and 
constructed a binge viewing measure with a clear definition of 
the concept and multiple indicators of the behavior, this study 
relied on self-report measures that could have biased our results. 
Objective measures of sleep and arousal are already available, 
but future research would benefit from objectively measuring 
binge viewing, too. Experience sampling studies or partnering 
with streaming services are possible approaches in this regard.
Finally, there has been much inconsistency in the definition 
and operationalization of binge viewing. Binge viewing is a rel-
atively new concept and the paucity of literature is still evolving. 
We composed a measure for binge viewing based on the study 
of Sung and colleagues.4 Our measure focuses on global fre-
quency and time estimates, which are among the most common 
forms of measurement in media research.46 However, Robinson 
and Godbey posited that these estimates can be complex for 
respondents and require significant cognitive effort to answer 
correctly. Probing media use within delineated time slots or aid-
ing recall with the use of graphic formats such as timelines are 
suggestions for improvement.47 In addition, because we used a 
formative measurement model—and the scores on the items are 
thus not the result of an underlying latent construct—we cannot 
report reliability or validity estimates. Assessment of internal 
validity and reliability is only possible for reflective measure-
ment models,48 because covariance between the items can be 
zero, positive, or negative in formative models.49 The design of 
a reflective measurement model for binge viewing is therefore 
recommended in future research.
CONCLUSIONS
Convergence between traditional and new media has diversi-
fied television’s technology, distribution, and use. This study 
provides initial evidence that modern viewing styles such as 
binge viewing may negatively affect overall sleep quality, and 
identified cognitive pre-sleep arousal as the explanatory mech-
anism. Despite television’s status as a form of “old media,” the 
rise of binge viewing shows that viewers are more engaged 
than ever with television content. Although sleep research is 
increasingly devoted to uncovering the effects of media on 
sleep, continued efforts are essential to monitor the dynamic 
relationship between leisure time and sleep. As quoted by 
Mikos: “Television will not disappear: it will only become 
available on all existing screens—and so become more present 
and more important.”10
