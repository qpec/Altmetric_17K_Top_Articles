ABSTRACT
Background. Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming
increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their
health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and
consumers–some of which have been shown to lead to improved health
management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have
been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide
study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system. Methods. We
conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a
2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac
arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that
corresponded to their condition(s) (hypertension: Withings Blood Pressure
Monitor; diabetes: Sanofi iBGStar Blood Glucose Meter; arrhythmia: AliveCor
Mobile ECG) and an iPhone with linked tracking applications for a period of
6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program.
Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health
management system which provided participants detailed device tracking
information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by
leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader,
health care provider, and employee wellness program–making it both unique and
inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health
insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also
examined health-self management. Results & Conclusions. There was little evidence
of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention.
Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were
equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests
there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization
associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital

improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease
in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the

INTRODUCTION
Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac arrhythmias are chronic diseases with a
significant health burden. The high prevalence and well-characterized complications of
these conditions result in negative impacts to quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Vast
medical, scientific, and engineering resources have been devoted in efforts to find ways to
improve diagnosis, treatment, management, and prevention, including advances in
diagnostic technology (Willits et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, 2015), dissemination of identifiable risk factors (Wilson et al., 1998;
Chobanian et al., 2003; American Diabetes Association, 2014), and development of
pharmaceuticals (The ALLHAT Officers and Coordinators for the ALLHAT Collaborative
Research Group, 2000; The ALLHAT Officers, 2002; Uzu et al., 2005; Ernst et al., 2006).
Nevertheless, the continued maintenance of these efforts and the costs associated with
direct patient care of individuals with these conditions remains a sizable fraction of health
care costs (Kim et al., 2011; Davis, 2013; Yang et al., 2013).
Despite these efforts, the management of these conditions remains challenging
(Hansen et al., 2005). Patient engagement, medication adherence, and adherence to
treatment strategies is variable and often suspect (Guyatt et al., 1986; Hansen et al.,
2005). Furthermore, poor communication between patients and their health care
providers can accentuate these issues. The end result is often a major clinical
decompensation event that could have been largely preventable. In addition to these
clinical consequences, these challenges also result in economic consequences such as high
utilization of inpatient resources and emergency departments, as well as readmissions
(Sander & Giles, 2011). One would surmise that better, more informed management of
disease would lead to better long-term health outcomes and thereby lower health care
resource utilization.
Understanding both this problem of day-to-day poor health care management and
ubiquity of smartphones and other mobile computing platforms in our daily lives,
numerous device manufacturers have developed biomedical sensors designed for patient
consumers which measure meaningful physiologic metrics (National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, 2015). These sensors often utilize a smartphone to display
information, while some can employ the internet network connectivity of the smartphone
to transmit data to remote servers for additional display, storage, or analytics. Individuals
appropriately using such devices can monitor their condition in their own real world
setting–potentially making management of disease more personalized and more engaging.

 This data may provide individuals with early recognition of disease symptoms and
consequences of behaviors, which can allow patients and providers to make proactive
health care decisions, thereby leading to improved health outcomes and potentially reduce
health care utilization. However, there is potential that such monitoring may lead to a
short-term increase in health care resource utilization even if appropriate, or over-
utilization while patients are learning to recognize which readings constitute normal
variation and which readings indicate a health issue requiring medical attention.
In large part, the jury is still out if chronic disease monitoring using mobile health and
digital medicine technology will, on its own, improve health outcomes (Steinhubl, Muse &
Topol, 2013; Steinhubl, Muse & Topol, 2015). Many previous studies have shown
improvements, but many others have shown none (Free et al., 2013a; Free et al., 2013b;
Hamine et al., 2015; Karhula et al., 2015). Whether or not a patient has improved health as
a result such monitoring likely depends on the behavior of the individual and the
technology itself. Motivated individuals using an informative device which captures
actionable data are likely to see improvements, while unmotivated individuals using
devices which capture meaningless or nonactionable information will see no benefit.
What has yet to be fully explored is how such monitoring will impact health care
utilization if digital medicine technology becomes embraced by the medical establishment
in the face of an increasingly informed, technology-embracing patient population
(Boeldt et al., 2015).
In light of this, we conducted a prospective, randomized-controlled trial designed to
assess the impact of mobile health monitoring on short-term health care utilization in
individuals with hypertension, diabetes, or arrhythmia. The intervention consisted of a
comprehensive, integrated monitoring system that included wireless medical devices
designed to be used with a smartphone, a smartphone with appropriate monitoring
applications, a web-based care management portal and iOS-based mobile application
where patients could access their data, and a staff of nurses and technicians available for
assistance. Given the potential for both short-term and long-term impacts on health care
utilization, we hypothesized that the intervention may impact health care costs compared
to standard disease management practices. We also examined how this intervention
influenced health self-management. We conducted this mobile health management
strategy on 160 employees and dependents from a large health care system.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study design
The research design was a prospective, simple randomized controlled, two-group, pre-
post intervention trial. Of 21,691 individuals insured by Scripps Health (employees and
dependents) and who submitted at least one claim in 2012, 3,998 individuals age 18 or
over who had billed a claim with a current procedural terminology (CPT) code related to
hypertension, insulin-dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes, and/or with
arrhythmia were identified and, if eligible, offered study participation. No stratification
with respect to condition was employed. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are
included in Supplemental Methods. The study period was six months and the trial took
Bloss et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1554
3/16
 place between July 2013 and December 2014. The study was approved by the Scripps
Institutional Review Board (approval # IRB-12-6019).
Study recruitment
The 3,998 eligible individuals were ranked according to the amount of their 2012 health
insurance claims billed for the three study conditions. Recruitment proceeded in blocks
starting with individuals in the highest 25% in terms of dollar amount, then the highest
50% and so on. For each block of individuals, a letter was sent describing the trial and
disease management program. Within two to four weeks, the letter was followed up with a
telephone call made by a HealthComp nursing staff member in which the study was
explained. HealthComp is the third party administrator for Scripps Health. A maximum
of three calls were attempted before a prospective participant was considered not
reachable. For those prospective participants who expressed interest, a link to the online
informed consent was sent via email. Prospective participants were asked to read and sign
the online consent. Once consented, participants were directed to complete an online
baseline survey. Afterwards, participants were randomized to control or intervention and
brought in for an enrollment visit with an unblinded research coordinator. The
participants were blind to their assigned group prior to enrollment. It was explained to all
participants that their employer would not have access to any of their medical information
used for the study.
Study enrollment
At the enrollment study visit, individuals assigned to the intervention arm were provided
with a study iPhone 4 or 4s (even if they owned one) and one or more mobile devices that
corresponded to their condition(s): a Withings Blood Pressure Monitor (hypertension),
Sanofi iGBStar Blood Glucose Meter (diabetes), or AliveCor Mobile ECG (arrhythmia).
As part of the intervention, participants were also supplied with an online account to
HealthyCirclesTM. HealthyCircles is a Qualcomm Life health care coordination and
management platform with an integrated suite of management and consumer portals that
can deliver chronic disease education and connect users to their families, caregivers, and
health care professionals. As part of the study, HealthComp nursing staff had access to the
HealthyCircles care management dashboard which displayed the participant’s device
monitoring results and trends over time. Device readings collected by the participant were
wirelessly uploaded to the patient’s HealthyCircles account and made available to the
HealthComp nurses as well as the patient via the study phone or a computer. Example
displays are included in Figs. S1–S3. Also included in the management platform were
reminders for monitoring, information about the participant’s disease condition, and
general health behavior recommendations. Participants randomized to the intervention
group were trained on how to use their phone, the HealthyCircles mobile applications and
portal, and their medical device(s). All study participants, including participants
randomized to the control arm, were enrolled in the HealthComp disease management
program, which involved outreach by HealthComp nursing staff for purposes of relaying
medical education and wellness information with regard to disease prevention and

 chronic disease management. In addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings
were recorded at baseline and follow-up on individuals with hypertension, whereas blood
glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were recorded on diabetics. Participants were also
provided with a contact email and phone number they could use to reach a study staff
member for technical and other study support.
Participants in the monitoring group were asked to take readings as follows:
hypertension: twice per day, three days per week, first one in the morning; insulin-
dependent diabetes: three times per day, once before each meal, and once before bed
every day; non-insulin dependent diabetes: once per day before meal, three times per
week; and arrhythmia: when symptomatic (Table S4). If their monitoring fell below the
level defined in the “Poor Compliance” range, the HealthComp nurse would send a secure
email through the HealthyCircles message center reminding them of the monitoring
schedule. They were also asked some compliance-related questions and provided with
strategies for getting back on schedule with the program. If the participant’s physician
recommended a monitoring schedule that was more frequent than that required for the
study, participants were encouraged to follow their physician’s instructions. Also, if
participants experienced other symptoms, for example hypertension: visual changes,
“bounding” pulse, chest discomfort, nausea; diabetes: fatigue, visual changes,
pre-syncopal symptoms, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting; arrhythmia: chest discomfort,
palpitations, rapid heart rate, feeling of “skipped beats,” dyspnea, nausea, pre-syncopal
symptoms they were recommended to take additional measurements. Individuals
were instructed on how to navigate the online disease management program at

Study procedures
Study participants were asked to attend both an enrollment study visit (baseline) and end-
of-study visit (follow-up) six months later, and to complete both a baseline and follow-up
survey on SurveyMonkey. At the mid-point of the study (i.e. three months), each
participant also received an email seeking any feedback about their experience thus far, or
asking if they were having any problems or had any questions.
Outcome measures
For both the treatment and control groups, outcomes were assessed using claims data
during the enrollment and termination visits. Primary outcomes were health care resource
utilization as measured by health insurance claims and visits to the hospital during the
study period (details below). Secondary outcomes were health self-management as
indicated by validated measures of health locus of control (Wallston, Stein & Smith, 1994),
health self-efficacy (Lorig et al., 1989), and patient activation (Hibbard et al., 2005).
Health insurance claims
All health insurance claims from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 were
collected on each study participant. For each individual, the total claims, condition-
specific claims, pharmaceutical claims amounts (all in dollars) were calculated.
Bloss et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1554
5/16
 Condition-specific claims were the total amount in claims related to one of the three study
conditions monitored. For example, the amount of hypertension claims was the amount
in claims in dollars with an ICD-9 code for hypertension. Totals were calculated for a
period of 6 months prior to study enrollment (baseline claims; Table S5) and 6 months
during enrollment (enrollment claims; Table S6). Claims were further partitioned into
four categories: office visits, emergency room visits, inpatient stays, and all visits (all in
number of occurrences). Differences in enrollment claims were then compared to baseline
claims between the control and monitoring groups, as well as between groups with specific
conditions. Data are available in Supplemental Data.
Health self-management
Information on health self-management was collected through the baseline and follow-up
survey. The outcomes of interest were: 1) the four subscales of health locus of control
(Internal, Chance, Doctor, Others) as assessed by the Form C of the Multidimensional
Health Locus of Control (MHLC) 18-item scale (Wallston, Stein & Smith, 1994); 2) health
self-efficacy as assessed by the Stanford Patient Education Research Center (PERC) 6-item
scale (Lorig et al., 1989); and 3) patient activation using the Patient Activation Measure
13-item measure (Hibbard et al., 2005). Health locus of control measures an individual’s
belief that his or her health is dependent on factors within his or her control; health
self-efficacy measures an individual’s confidence managing his or her health; and patient
activation measures an individual’s skills and knowledge in managing his or her
own health.
Device usage
Device usage statistics were recorded for each study participant in the monitoring group.
Whenever a study participant used a device, the time, date, and user information of that
particular reading was sent to a database managed by Qualcomm and available to
participants through Healthy Circles. In the case of the Withings Blood Pressure Monitor
and IBG Star, the reading measurements (i.e. blood pressure and blood glucose levels)
were also recorded; while PDFs corresponding to the AliveCor arrhythmia assessments
were saved. An issue was encountered where a subset of Withings measures could not be
accurately determined. These measures were omitted. There were 21 study participants
affected in varying severity, 10 of which had this issue present in all data and 8 others had
this issue present in at least 16% of the data (the other two 6% and 0.5%). As accurate
device usage information on these 18 individuals could not be determined, it was treated
as missing. For all other study participants, the total number of readings taken on each
device was recorded.
Statistical analyses and sample size justification
Between group differences were compared using a paired two sample t-test or Mann-
Whitney test in cases of small sample sizes and skewed outcomes (e.g. health insurance
claims). By using this paired approach we better model the change in outcomes of interest
induced by the intervention and reduce the influence of baseline confounders in the
Bloss et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1554
6/16
 association statistics. Equivalence testing was performed using the two one-sided test for
equivalence using a magnitude of region of similarity equal to half a standard deviation
for each outcome. The study was designed to be powered (a priori) to detect a one
office visit difference between the control and monitoring arm (assuming a standard
deviation of two office visits).
RESULTS
Participant demographics and information
Study participant demographics are presented in Table 1. Participants in the control and
monitoring groups were roughly equivalent with respect to common demographics and
disease, which is consistent with the randomization process. A total of 89 had only
hypertension, 9 non-insulin dependent diabetes, 6 arrhythmia, 5 insulin-dependent
diabetes, and 51 with more than one of these conditions. The study enrollment flow
chart is presented in Fig. S7. Of the 160 individuals enrolled in the study, 130 completed
both the baseline and follow-up assessments (n = 65 control, n = 65 monitoring;
p = 0.14). Using Google Analytics we observed a total of 3,670 sessions (after quality
control filtering) to the HealthyCircles online disease management program over
the course of the study (Fig. S8), with 7.17 page visits per session, and average
session duration of 11 minutes and 18 seconds. Google Analytics does not provide easily
accessible individual user website traffic data. We assessed weekly compliance of the
intervention in the monitoring group based on device usage (e.g., an individual
with hypertension would be compliant in a given week if they used the device
at least six times that week). We observed compliance rates were largely uniform
(mean = 50%), with 66% of individuals deemed compliant at least one-third
of the weeks.
Health insurance claims
Health insurance claims during the period of 6 months prior to study enrollment did not
differ between control and monitoring groups (Table S5). The average total amount of
health insurance claims during this period was $5,712 (sd = $19,234; median = $976), and
we observed no difference in claims between individuals with different disease conditions
(p = 0.99). The average number of office visits was 4.1 (sd = 4.2; median = 3); the average
number of emergency room visits was 0.10 (sd = 0.45; median = 0); and the average
number of inpatient stays was 0.53 (sd = 3.10; median = 0). None of these claim categories
differed statistically between conditions.
We did not observe any differences in health insurance claims between control and
monitoring groups during the 6 months of study enrollment (Table S6). This trend also
persisted when we accounted for baseline claims (Table 2). The average total amount of
health insurance claims in the monitoring group was $6,026 while the average amount
in the control group was $5,596 (p = 0.62). We note these averages are consistent with
average total amount in health insurance claims across the entire sampling frame
(mean = $5,305), indicating that health insurance claims in the monitoring group were
not grossly different from the average patient (i.e., individuals not enrolled in the study).
Bloss et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1554
7/16
 We also did not observe any differences between the groups with respect to office visits
(p = 0.46), inpatient stays (p = 0.82), emergency room visits (p = 0.06), or pharmacy
claims (p = 0.60). The total health insurance claims amount during enrollment also did
not differ by condition (p = 0.50), and we similarly observed no differences in claims
specific to each condition or multiple conditions (Table S6).
Alternatively, we examined the differences in health care utilization using an
equivalence testing approach. Using a magnitude of region of similarity equal to half a
standard deviation for each outcome, in general we discovered that health care utilization
was roughly equivalent between groups (Table 2). We discovered that monitoring and
control groups were roughly equal with respect to total health insurance claims dollars
(p = 0.027), pharmacy claims (p = 0.037), office visits (p = 0.038), inpatient stays
(p = 0.042), and total hospital visits (p = 0.014). This suggests that there is unlikely to be

 substantial short-term changes in health care utilization as a result of the monitoring
intervention.
We also examined health insurance utilization in a subset of the monitoring group who
we were able to assess as being compliant with the study protocol in at least one-third of
the weeks of the study. Again, we did not observe any differences with respect to the total
amount of health insurance claims (p = 0.17), office visits (p = 0.34), or inpatient stays
(p = 0.34). Though there was slight trend towards an increase in emergency room visits
among these participants in the monitoring group (mean increase = 0.10) compared to
the controls (mean decrease = 0.12; p = 0.027).
Health self-management
Additionally, we examined the relationship between monitoring/control group
assignment and health self-management using baseline and follow-up survey responses.
We quantified differences in measures of health locus of control, self-efficacy, and patient
activation (Table 3). Each of these are validated measures designed to address how an
individual perceives his or her health and health management. We did not find differences
in changes in self-efficacy (p = 0.85) or patient activation (p = 0.68) between groups. In
both cases, both the control and monitoring groups did not differ between baseline and
follow-up. The average Stanford Patient Education Research Center (PERC) 6-item
self-efficacy scale was 7.9 and 8.0 across both groups at baseline and follow-up,
respectively. Meanwhile, the average Patient Activation Measure 13-item measure was
73 and 76 across both groups at baseline and follow-up, respectively. However, one
component of Form C of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) 18-item
scale, the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors (MHLC Chance),
showed improvement in the intervention group as compared to controls

 (� = 2.06; p = 0.020). We simultaneously observed an approximately 1.3 increase in the
scale in the control arm and 0.8 decrease in the intervention arm. Thus, compared to
controls, participants in the intervention arm were less likely to view their health status as
due to chance. We did not observe any group differences with respect to the other health
locus of control components. In each group, the average scores at the follow-up visit were
within 0.5 of the baseline scores (Table 3).
Among the 138 individuals who enrolled in the study with a prior indication of
hypertension, we obtained both baseline and follow-up systolic and diastolic blood
pressure readings on 112 participants (n = 61 monitoring; n = 61 control). The average
systolic blood pressure did not differ between baseline and end-of-study in the
monitoring group (p = 0.32), control group (p = 0.12), or between groups (p = 0.56).
However, the average diastolic blood pressure dropped 3.6 mmHg in the monitoring
group (p = 0.035) and 6.1 mmHg in the control group (p = 0.0036); though again there
was no difference between groups (p = 0.35). Likewise, among the 47 individuals who
enrolled in the study with a prior indication of diabetes, we obtained hemoglobin A1c
levels on 31 participants at both time points. However, hemoglobin A1c levels did
not differ between baseline and the end-of-study within each group or between groups
(p = 0.98).
Device usage
Study participants in the monitoring group who completed the follow-up study visit used
one of the monitoring devices a total of 10,305 times (Fig. S9). This includes 6,356 blood
pressure readings, 3,440 blood glucose readings, and 509 arrhythmia readings. The
average number of blood pressure readings was 151 (sd = 84; median = 154) with a
maximum of 436. Four of 42 (10%) study participants had fewer than three times
measurements over the course of the study. All others had more than 60 measurements.
The average number of blood glucose readings was 248 (sd = 268; median = 125). Four
of 14 (29%) study participants did not record a reading. Meanwhile, the average number
of arrhythmia readings was 57 (sd = 54; median = 53) with one individual of nine (11%)
not using the device.

 DISCUSSION
Our study constitutes a major advancement over existing studies that have examined
mobile health technologies by virtue of its design features. First we deployed a gold-
standard prospective, randomized design with an intervention that included multiple key
components relevant for management of three chronic conditions with high morbidity
and mortality. This intervention included the use of three state-of-the-field wireless
smartphone-enabled remote monitoring medical devices. Furthermore, data from the
devices was aggregated using the Qualcomm Life cloud-to-cloud data integration
capability. Data visualization was then provided to study participants through an online
care coordination application where participants could view their device readings through
web and mobile mediums throughout the course of the intervention period. Thus, we feel
that compared to previous studies in the mobile health space, our intervention more
closely mirrors a future in which chronic disease monitoring using mobile biomedical
sensors is embraced by the health care community. This requires a system that brings
together device manufacturers, mobile health telecommunication expertise, health care
providers, and employee wellness programs–all of which we utilized in the development
and implementation our mobile health monitoring intervention.
We enrolled 160 study participants in the study, achieving low drop-out particularly in
the monitoring group where 87% of participants completed all aspects of the study.
We also had relatively good compliance among individuals in the monitoring group.
Hypertensive study participants on average recorded one blood pressure measurement per
day, roughly what we requested (twice per day, three days per week; 6 total per week).
In total, individuals in the monitoring group provided over 9,000 blood pressure, blood
glucose, and electrocardiogram readings which we will are now examining for interesting
trends in the entirety of data we collected. Interestingly, these individuals used the
HealthyCircles online disease management program somewhat sparingly (3,670 uses over
six months for 65 study participants). Instead, many users preferred the mobile tracking
applications. Future research could explore different means of providing data back to
individuals monitoring their condition.
Overall we found little in terms of differences in health insurance claims between
individuals enrolled in the control and monitoring arm. This is significant because we
were powered to detect a moderate difference–approximately a doubling of health
insurance claims dollars. This suggests that while there may be small short-term increases
in health care utilization as a result of mobile health monitoring, there is likely not a major
effect. Our equivalence testing results reiterated this finding. We also expect that any
short-term effect would decrease over time as a user’s comfort with monitoring and
understanding of their data improves. Importantly, our six month study period fails to
capture the potential competing long-term decrease in health care utilization that may
occur as a result of monitoring leading to improved health management and health
outcomes. Taken collectively, we feel any apprehension directed at consumer mobile
health monitoring with respect to over-utilization of health care resources should
be tempered.

 Meanwhile, we found some evidence of improved health self-management in
individuals who received the intervention, which was characterized by a decrease in the
propensity to view health status as due to chance factors. One possible explanation is that
this shift was due to the ability to remotely, and at will, track personal biometric indices
important for one’s condition. Another explanation is that the actual information gleaned
from the readings prompted the users to consider how they might make behavioral
changes that would impact those metrics. Clarifying this mechanism of action could
enable the development of future digital medicine interventions that are refined in such a
way as to optimally impact health locus of control.
We encountered several challenges executing this project as a result of its complexity.
One particular challenge was effectively dealing with the involvement of and collaboration
between multiple entities, including industry, research, and clinical partners in the digital
medicine space. Necessary legal agreements, data pipelines, and working arrangements
were required to facilitate the study initiation and execution. In total, the study involved
over five different Scripps departments, ten different companies, development and
execution of at least eight different contracts or legal agreements, five different terms of
use that a study participant could potentially have to agree to, and creation of six
participant instruction or “set-up” guides. As this demonstrates, the conduct and
deployment of digital medicine trials can present unique challenges that future work in
this area could help address. We also encountered technological issues. Out of 75
individuals enrolled in the monitoring group, 21 (28%) experienced issues that required
the research team to log at least one help desk ticket due to technical issues with the
participant’s phone, device(s), or connection to the online portal. Furthermore,
10 of these individuals had more than one help desk ticket submitted and at least
20 individuals had to have either the iPhone and/or the device replaced altogether.
Technical issues are, of course, inevitable when pursuing innovative interventions that
leverage new technologies. However, in order for such interventions to effectively provide
benefit to the user they have to be seamless in order to minimize participant fatigue.
Exposing study participants to such issues has the potential to create biases in the study
results. Though we did not observed a difference in drop-out rate between individuals
who submitted a help desk ticket and those that did not (p = 0.27), minimizing
technological issues should be an important consideration in the design of future digital
medicine trials.
In conclusion, we have presented the first prospective randomized trial of a digital
medicine intervention with multiple smartphone-enabled biosensors, data aggregated and
visualized through an online connected health platform, deployed with three high
morbidity and mortality chronic diseases examining health care utilization. Our results
suggest there is little to no short-term increase in health care utilization as a result of
participation in a comprehensive mobile health monitoring care coordination platform.
Meanwhile, we did see some improvement in health self-management. Future work
should explore the potential reduction in long-term health care utilization as a result of
potentially improved health management due to mobile health monitoring.
