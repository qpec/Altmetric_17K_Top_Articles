Abstract
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), the second most common subtype of lung cancer,
is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and exhibits genomic instability. The cellular
origins and molecular processes that contribute to SqCC formation are largely unexplored.
Here we show that human basal stem cells (BSCs) isolated from heavy smokers proliferate
extensively, whereas their alveolar progenitor cell counterparts have limited colony-forming
capacity. We demonstrate that this difference arises in part because of the ability of BSCs to
repair their DNA more efficiently than alveolar cells following ionizing radiation or chemical-
induced DNA damage. Analysis of mice harbouring a mutation in the DNA-dependent pro-
tein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key enzyme in DNA damage repair by nonho-
mologous end joining (NHEJ), indicated that BSCs preferentially repair their DNA by this
error-prone process. Interestingly, polyploidy, a phenomenon associated with genetically
unstable cells, was only observed in the human BSC subset. Expression signature analysis
indicated that BSCs are the likely cells of origin of human SqCC and that high levels of
NHEJ genes in SqCC are correlated with increasing genomic instability. Hence, our results
favour a model in which heavy smoking promotes proliferation of BSCs, and their predilec-
tion for error-prone NHEJ could lead to the high mutagenic burden that culminates in SqCC.
Targeting DNA repair processes may therefore have a role in the prevention and therapy of
SqCC.
Author Summary
Human lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled chemicals that have the potential to dam-
age cellular DNA. Lung stem cells must therefore have the ability to repair DNA damage
to survive and achieve tissue homeostasis. Lung airways are composed of different types
of cells, including basal cells, which have been proposed to be the stem cells of the lung.

 Here, we show that lung basal stem cells have a superior ability to resolve DNA damage
compared to alveolar progenitor cells, thus allowing these cells to survive and proliferate
after injury. Accordingly, basal stem cells isolated from patients with a long history of
tobacco smoking had remarkable proliferative potential compared to those extracted from
never smokers. However, we demonstrate that basal stem cells predominately use nonho-
mologous end joining to repair DNA double-strand breaks, a notoriously error-prone
pathway. A subset of polyploid basal stem cells was observed in cigarette-smoking
patients, pointing to the accumulation of genetic instability in these long-lived cells. Gene
expression analyses revealed that lung squamous cell carcinoma, a subtype of lung cancer
that almost exclusively occurs in smokers, carries a transcriptional fingerprint of basal
cells, suggesting that lung basal stem cells could be the cells of origin of this subtype of
lung cancer. We postulate that further unravelling of DNA repair in lung cells may lead to
potential therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of lung diseases.
Introduction
Human lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled environmental and chemical insults that have
the potential to damage cellular DNA. Lung stem and progenitor cells must be capable of
repairing their DNA to maintain healthy survival. The failure of stem cells to repair DNA dam-
age can contribute to tissue loss through damage-induced cell death, whereas unfaithful DNA
repair in stem cells may invoke carcinogenesis through the accumulation of genetic aberra-
tions [1]. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), the second most common histological sub-
type of lung cancer, exhibits strong genomic instability and occurs almost exclusively in
smokers, with 96% of patients having a history of tobacco use [2–4]. The carcinogens present
in cigarette smoke are likely responsible for the extraordinarily high mutational rate observed
in SqCC compared to other cancers [4].
The early molecular events caused by tobacco exposure and the cell types in which these
genetic aberrations occur to induce SqCC formation are not well known. Stem/progenitor
cells are putative tumour-initiating cells because of their capacity for renewal and their longev-
ity, allowing for accumulation of genetic lesions. Susceptibility of different lung epithelial pro-
genitor cells to DNA damage has not been explored and could further inform the mechanisms
involved in smoking-induced carcinogenesis. DNA damage encompasses alterations to bases,
strand cross-links, single-strand breaks (SSBs), and double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs, which
have been shown to arise after cigarette smoke exposure [5–7], are the most dangerous type of
DNA lesion, as they can result in loss or gain of genetic information through insertions, dele-
tions, or chromosomal translocations. DSB repair occurs through either homologous recombi-
nation (HR), a high-fidelity DNA repair mechanism, or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ),
an unfaithful mechanism that is implicated in genomic instability and tumour formation [1,8].
Different types of lung progenitor cells have been proposed in distinct anatomical regions
of the lung [9]. Lung airways are composed of basal, secretory, ciliated, and neuroendocrine
cells. Basal stem cells (BSCs), present only in the human cartilaginous airways or the mouse
trachea [10], are located between the basement membrane and the luminal airway cells and
have been proposed as stem cells of the lung [9,11–13]. The alveolar compartment is composed
of alveolar type 1 and type 2 (AT1 and AT2) cells. AT2 cells have progenitor activity and can
replenish both AT1 and AT2 cells following lung injury [14,15], although recent studies sug-
gest that AT1 cells could also serve as progenitors in the mouse lung after pneumonectomy
[16,17]. Different cell surface markers have been used to isolate human lung BSCs [12,18,19],

 but few markers allowing separation of other lung epithelial cell types have been identified
[20,21].
Here we used flow cytometry to isolate BSCs, luminal (club, goblet, and ciliated) cells, and
AT2 cells from fresh human proximal and distal lung tissue and showed that BSCs and AT2
cells behave as progenitor cells in an in vitro colony-forming assay. BSCs from heavy smokers
had an increased proliferative potential compared to those of never smokers, whereas AT2
progenitor activity was diminished in patients with long smoking histories. To investigate this
striking difference in lung stem/progenitor cell response to cigarette smoke exposure, we
asked if the DNA repair mechanisms differed between the two cell types. DNA damage studies
following ionizing radiation or exposure to a chemical agent demonstrated that human and
mouse BSCs repair their DNA more efficiently than alveolar progenitor cells using the unfaith-
ful NHEJ pathway, leading to cell survival and proliferation. In addition, polyploidy, a phe-
nomenon occurring during oncogenesis [22], was only observed in the BSC subset, indicating
that these cells may be more prone to transformation. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that
lung SqCCs carry a transcriptional fingerprint of human lung BSCs, suggesting that BSCs may
behave as the cells of origin of this subtype of lung cancer. In addition, high expression levels
of key NHEJ genes in lung SqCCs are associated with increased genomic instability. Collec-
tively, our data indicate that error-prone DNA repair is a hallmark of lung SqCC and suggest
that targeting NHEJ may play a role in SqCC prevention and/or treatment.
Results
Isolation of Epithelial Progenitor Cells in the Human Lung
Fresh human lung samples were obtained from patients undergoing lung cancer surgery and
held intact in media until processing. The tissues were collected distally from the tumour sites
and subdivided into proximal (containing cartilaginous airways and surrounding paren-
chyma) and distal (containing distal noncartilaginous airways and surrounding parenchyma)
regions. A novel fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategy was developed to deplete
pre-erythrocytes, fibroblasts, and haematopoietic and endothelial cells from lung cell suspen-
sions. Epithelial cells (EpCAM+, epithelial cell adhesion molecule) were then subdivided based
on their expression level of CD166 (encoded by ALCAM), CD49f (α6 integrin), and T1α
(also known as podoplanin). Three populations were defined in proximal samples:
CD49fhiT1α+CD166mid (termed P5), CD49fmidT1α-CD166hi (termed P6), and
CD49fmidT1α-CD166mid (termed P10), and two populations in distal samples:
CD49fmidT1α-CD166hi (P6) and CD49fmidT1α-CD166mid (termed P10) (Fig 1A and S1A Fig).
These populations were consistently observed in the 121 lung samples analysed.
Quantitative PCR analysis (Fig 1B) and intracellular FACS staining (Fig 1C) of known
intracellular markers of lung epithelial cells revealed that each population contained distinct
cell types. P5 cells expressed high levels of the basal cell markers TP63 and keratin 5 (KRT5). In
contrast, both proximal and distal P6 populations contained cells that exhibited strong expres-
sion of markers of club (secretoglobin 1A1, SCGB1A1),goblet (mucin 5AC, MUC5AC), and
ciliated cells (forkhead box J1, FOXJ1; acetylated-tubulin) indicating this subpopulation is
enriched in luminal airway cells (Fig 1B, 1C and 1D). The P10 subsets expressed high levels of
the AT2 lineage marker surfactant protein C (SFTPC). Transmission electron microscopy fur-
ther showed that the P5 population (referred to as BSC) contained cells with numerous mito-
chondria and keratin filaments, consistent with a basal cell phenotype [23] and their exclusive
location in the proximal lung (Fig 1A and 1E). P10 populations (referred to as AT2) contained
a homogenous population of AT2 cells, as evidenced by the presence of microvilli and multiple
lamellar bodies (Fig 1E). These data establish that the expression of EpCAM, CD49f, CD166,

 and T1α is sufficient to delineate cellular compartments enriched in BSCs, luminal cells, and
AT2 cells in human lung samples.
Human Lung BSCs Are Activated by Cigarette Smoke Exposure
We then assessed the colony-forming capacity of the five cellular subsets described above in a
three-dimensional assay. Only BSCs and AT2 cells generated colonies that were phenotypically
distinct (Fig 2A). BSCs formed clonal, hollow, spherical colonies, whilst AT2 colonies were
saccular and less uniform (Fig 2A, S1B and S1C Fig). Immunostaining showed that BSC colo-
nies maintain expression of KRT5, whilst AT2 colonies expressed SFTPC, indicating that the
cells retain their lineage commitment in this culture system (Fig 2B). Distal AT2 cells had a sig-
nificantly higher number of colony-forming units (CFUs) than proximal AT2 cells (Fig 2C),
suggesting heterogeneity in the AT2 population between proximal and distal lung. We focused
on the distal AT2 compartment (named AT2 from now on) because of its increased progenitor
activity. Diversity in the basal cell compartment has also been suggested from studies in the
mouse trachea, with BSCs and basal progenitor cells possessing different colony-forming
capacities [24]. Heterogeneity in the BSC population may also exist in the human lung and
could explain the variability in BSC CFUs observed in our study (Fig 2C). To further interro-
gate the diversity in the colony-forming capacity of BSCs, we investigated the association
between patient tobacco-smoking history and the proliferative potential of human lung pro-
genitor cells. Strikingly, BSCs isolated from an exsmoker patient formed numerous large colo-
nies compared to BSCs isolated from a never smoker, which only formed a limited number of
small colonies (Fig 2D). Conversely, AT2 cells isolated from an exsmoker had reduced colony-
forming capacity compared to AT2 cells from a never smoker that formed multiple large sac-
cular colonies (Fig 2D). Linear correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation
between years of smoking and the number of BSC CFUs, whereas tobacco exposure was
inversely correlated with the number of AT2 cell CFUs (Fig 2E). The number of years since a
patient had quit smoking, patient age, and patient sex did not correlate with colony-forming
capacity (S2A, S2B and S2C Fig). These data demonstrate that exposure to cigarette smoke
activates lung BSCs yet impairs AT2 cells and that this effect is maintained after smoking
cessation.
Human and Mouse BSCs Possess Increased DNA Repair Capacity
To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the differential response of AT2 cells and
BSCs to cigarette smoking, we performed RNA sequencing on freshly isolated cells from cur-
rent and exsmokers. Unsupervised clustering showed that each population was molecularly
distinct (Fig 3A and S3A Fig). Gene ontology analyses revealed that cell cycle and DNA repair
genes were up-regulated in BSCs compared to AT2 cells (Fig 3B). Human BSCs also expressed
high levels of telomere maintenance genes, including TERT (S3B Fig), and were found to have
longer telomeres than AT2 cells (S3C Fig). Given that both active DNA repair and telomere
maintenance are properties of stem cells [25,26], these findings align with mouse studies and
confirm that BSCs have greater stem cell-like characteristics than the AT2 progenitor cells
[11,27]. BSCs exhibited up-regulation of key genes that control the activation of DNA repair
pathways, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) [28] (Fig 3C), suggesting that BSCs
may have an enhanced ability to respond to DNA damage. To evaluate the sensitivity of
human lung stem and progenitor cells to DNA damage, we subjected fresh human lung tissue
to ionizing radiation (IR) and assessed the presence of DSBs over time by immunofluorescence
analysis of phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX), an early marker of DSBs. Strong γH2AX
staining was observed in both the alveolar and BSC compartment 1 h after IR exposure

 (Fig 3D). However, DSBs were resolved in the basal cell compartment 24 h post IR, whereas
γH2AX staining was still detected in the alveolar region at this time point (Fig 3D). These
results suggest that human BSCs exhibit an increased capacity to repair their DNA following
IR compared to alveolar cells.
Given that the transcriptomic analysis and the study of the response to IR were performed
on human samples from patients with different smoking histories, we sought to determine
whether this striking difference in gene expression profile and DNA damage response of
human BSCs and AT2 cells was acquired as a result of chronic cigarette smoke exposure or if it
was an inherent property of the cells. Healthy lungs from never smokers are difficult to obtain;
hence, we performed RNA-seq transcriptional profiling on mouse tracheal BSCs and lung
alveolar cells (S4A Fig). Gene expression profiles of mouse BSCs and alveolar cells significantly
correlated with their human counterparts, indicating that the transcriptome of lung stem/pro-
genitor cells is highly conserved between species (Fig 4A). Consistent with the human data, we
observed that DNA repair genes and cell cycle genes were up-regulated in mouse BSCs com-
pared to alveolar cells (S4B Fig), suggesting that both mouse and human lung BSCs may be
intrinsically positioned to repair DNA damage. γH2AX immunofluorescence staining of mice
subjected to IR revealed that both BSCs and alveolar cells had DSBs 1 h post IR, and this was
detected in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4B, S4C Fig). However, γH2AX expression was
resolved in BSCs 4 h post IR, whilst it was still strongly detected in the alveolar compartment
24 h after IR (Fig 4B). Similar results were observed when the mice were injected with bleomy-
cin, a DNA-damaging agent known to induce DSBs [29] (Fig 4B). The sensitivity of mouse
alveolar cells to IR was reflected in increased apoptosis that was not observed in BSCs (Fig 4C,
S4D and S4E Fig). Whilst it is possible that BSCs undergo cell senescence, BSCs proliferated 4
h and 8 h after IR (Fig 4D), suggesting that senescence in these cells is unlikely. Therefore,
lung BSCs have superior DNA repair capabilities leading to cell survival and proliferation that
is conserved across species, while alveolar cells exhibit limited DNA repair capacity resulting
in DNA damage-induced cell death.
BSCs Use NHEJ to Repair DNA DSBs
Our results show that BSCs have a prompt and enhanced ability to repair DSBs compared to
alveolar cells in vivo. NHEJ is a rapid DSB repair process that occurs in all phases of the cell
cycle, while HR functions only in actively cycling cells [30]. Given that the majority of BSCs
and alveolar cells reside in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (S4D Fig) and that RAD51, an
early marker of HR, was not detected in mouse BSCs after IR (Fig 5A), we interrogated
whether BSCs preferentially used NHEJ to repair DSBs. Genes regulating NHEJ were found to
be up-regulated in human and mouse BSCs compared to alveolar cells (Fig 5B and S5A Fig),
including PRKDC that encodes for the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit
(DNA-PKcs), a necessary enzyme for the initiation of NHEJ [31]. Activation of DNA-PKcs
was observed in lung samples from cigarette-smoking patients and in irradiated mouse lung
and trachea as detected by immunofluorescence staining of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (Fig
5C and 5D).

 To assess whether BSCs use NHEJ to repair their DNA, we analysed severe combined
immune deficiency (SCIDPrkdc) mice, that have a mutation in Prkdc, leading to a 50% reduc-
tion in DNA-PKcs activity and impaired NHEJ [32]. Identical levels of γH2AX were induced

 Strikingly, DSBs were still detected in tracheas of SCIDprkdc mice 8 h post IR, whereas DSBs
were completely resolved in WT tracheas at this time point, indicating that BSCs use NHEJ to
rapidly repair their DNA following damage (Figs 4B and 6A). Quantification by flow cytome-
try confirmed that BSCs from SCIDprkdc mice exhibited delayed DSB repair after IR compared
to WT mice, whilst the levels of γH2AX in the alveolar compartment were not affected by
reduced DNA-PKcs activity (Fig 6B and 6C). Treatment with bleomycin similarly resulted in
delayed DSB repair in BSCs isolated from SCIDprkdc mice compared to WT mice, whereas
knock-down of DNA-PKcs activity did not alter γH2AX expression in AT2 cells (S5B and S5C

with an increase in cell death following IR that was not observed in WT BSCs (Fig 6D and 6E).

 In addition, alveolar cells isolated from WT and SCIDprkdc mice had similar levels of apoptosis
(S5D Fig). These data establish that BSCs predominantly use the NHEJ pathway to repair
DSBs to maintain cell survival and proliferation, whilst lung alveolar progenitor cells have
reduced NHEJ activity.
BSCs Are the Candidate Cells of Origin of Lung SqCC
Use of the error-prone NHEJ repair pathway has been associated with increased genetic alter-
ations and genomic instability [1]. Interestingly, polyploid cells were detected in the human
BSC subset isolated from exsmokers, whereas no such population was present in AT2 cells (Fig
7A and 7B), suggesting that a proportion of BSCs have increased genetic instability compared
to AT2 cell progenitors. These results led us to investigate the involvement of BSCs in lung car-
cinogenesis. We used expression signature analysis to relate the transcriptome of human lung
cell subsets to expression profiles of tumours available from The Clinical Lung Cancer Project
(S6A Fig) [33]. We found that the expression profile of human lung BSCs was strongly associ-
ated with that of SqCC (Fig 7C and 7D). No correlation was observed between BSCs and other
lung cancer subtypes, nor did any other human epithelial cell subset associate with SqCC
(S6B–S6E Fig), suggesting BSCs as the putative cells of origin of SqCC. We noticed that
human BSCs express higher levels of genes known to be frequently altered in SqCC, such as
NFE2L2, SOX2, and PTEN [3,34], compared to the other lung epithelial subsets (Fig 7E). Addi-
tionally, BSCs expressed high levels of APOBEC cytidine deaminase genes (Fig 7E), which
could explain the APOBEC signature observed in lung SqCC [4]. Interestingly, lung SqCCs
express higher levels of DNA repair and cell proliferation genes compared to lung adenocarci-
noma, a cancer that arises from lung AT2 cells (S7A Fig) [35,36]. Analysis of the RNA-seq data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas data [3,37] showed that key NHEJ genes such as PRKDC and
XRCC6 are expressed at higher levels in lung SqCC compared to lung adenocarcinomas and
normal lung tissue (Fig 7F and S7B Fig). Strikingly, high expression of PRKDC or XRCC6 in
lung SqCC was found to be associated with increased genomic instability (Fig 7G). These data
suggest that DNA repair by NHEJ could prove to be a hallmark of lung SqCC. We propose
that the use of NHEJ by BSCs could lead to the accumulation of genetic alterations that may
culminate in SqCC formation in cigarette-smoking patients (Fig 8), although this hypothesis
will need to be validated with functional studies in vivo.
Discussion
In this study, we used a novel combination of cell surface markers to simultaneously isolate
distinct human lung epithelial cell populations and observed that lung BSCs have more stem
cell-like characteristics than AT2 progenitor cells. BSCs were found to have longer telomeres
and a superior ability to repair DSBs compared to AT2 cells. Our study provides new evidence
to indicate that adult lung stem cells have developed more efficient DNA repair mechanisms

 than differentiated cells to promote cell survival and tissue repair. Consistently, haematopoie-
tic stem cells appear more resistant to IR-induced cell death than myeloid progenitors and
were found to activate NHEJ to repair their DNA [38]. NHEJ has also been proposed as a
mechanism for DSB repair in breast and hair follicle bulge stem cells [39,40] as a process to
evade apoptosis and ensure stem cell longevity.
Cigarette smoke contains a complex mix of carcinogens and toxins that cause DNA dam-
age, including oxidative base damage, the formation of DNA adducts, SSBs, and DSBs
[7,41,42]. The observation that lung BSCs have a greater capacity to repair DNA damage com-
pared to alveolar progenitor cells may explain the varied smoking-induced pathologies
observed in specific anatomical regions of the lung. Loss of AT2 cells has been identified as a
mechanism participating in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and emphy-
sema-like diseases [43,44]. Different genetic mutations have been associated with the develop-
ment of these diseases, including aberrations in telomere maintenance genes, SFTPC, MUC5B,
and alpha-1 anti-trypsin [45–47]. Our data showing that AT2 cells are highly sensitive to DNA

Fig 8. Lung BSCs have a rapid yet error-prone response to DNA damage through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). This allows
the cells to continue to survive and proliferate after DNA injury and may eventually result in the accumulation of genetic lesions that lead to
SqCC formation. In contrast, AT2 progenitor cells have an insufficient response to DNA damage, resulting in cell death.

 damage, leading to increased cell death and reduced colony-forming capacity, suggest a novel
molecular mechanism that may participate in tobacco smoking-induced emphysema. They
also provide further supporting evidence that epithelial cell dysfunction plays a role in the
pathogenesis of degenerative lung diseases. Radiation therapy is frequently used in lung cancer
patients yet is often associated with damage of surrounding normal tissue, resulting in reduced
quality of life [48]. Our observation that AT2 progenitor cells have limited DSB repair capacity
and increased cell death following IR may also provide insights into the adverse loss of alveolar
cells and radiation-induced fibrosis following γ-irradiation.
We observed that BSCs isolated from heavy tobacco users are drastically more proliferative
than those from never-smoker patients, which is consistent with the basal cell hyperplasia fre-
quently observed in cigarette smokers [23,49]. Multiple mechanisms most likely account for
the activation of BSC proliferation following exposure to tobacco smoke. Firstly, endogenous
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to influence the proliferative capacity
of lung cells [18], and elevated ROS levels, like those induced by cigarette smoke exposure,
could participate in the higher proliferative potential of BSCs observed in smoker patients. Sec-
ondly, cigarette smoking damages luminal airway cells [49,50], and BSCs could be activated to
replenish differentiated airway cells. Consistently, studies in mice have shown that depletion of
luminal airway cells results in the expansion of BSCs and their differentiation into secretory
cells and ciliated cells [12]. We propose an additional mechanism by which the enhanced
DNA repair capabilities of BSCs promote their proliferation after cigarette smoke exposure
and could participate in smoking-induced basal cell hyperplasia.
Our findings provide evidence that BSCs are more proficient than alveolar cells in using
NHEJ to repair their DNA. NHEJ has been implicated in the accumulation of genetic lesions
[51] and plays a role in chromothripsis [52–54]—phenomena that participate in the initiation
of tumour formation. Quiescent haematopoietic stem cells use NHEJ and displayed increased
genomic instability after irradiation compared to progenitor cells, further implicating NHEJ in
oncogenesis [38]. We propose the ability of BSCs to rapidly repair DNA through error-prone
NHEJ allows the cells to survive longer and places them at greater risk than lung progenitor
cells to accumulate mutations, which may ultimately lead to the induction of carcinogenesis
(Fig 8).
In vivo studies in genetically modified mice have been used to demonstrate the cell of origin
of cancer. AT2 cells were found to act as the tumour-initiating cells in K-RasG12D-driven lung
adenocarcinoma [35,36], whilst inactivation of Tp53 and Rb specifically in lung neuroendo-
crine cells resulted in small cell lung cancer [55]. Based on its anatomical location in the upper
airways and the expression of BSC markers, lung SqCC is thought to arise from BSCs. Surpris-
ingly, a recent study in genetically modified mice showed that overexpression of Sox2 in a
Cdkn2ab/Pten null background could drive SqCC formation from BSCs, Club cells, or AT2
cells [56]. It remains to be seen whether multiple cells of origin are observed in other mouse
models of lung SqCC, including mice with genetic backgrounds such as Lkb1-/-, Lkb1-/-/Pten-/-,
or kinase-dead Ikkα [57–59]. In addition, such results may not be directly translatable in
humans, given that mouse and human cells may not have the same degree of plasticity.
Human tumours also carry much more genetic diversity than mouse cancer models, which is
particularly relevant in lung cancer given its high levels of genomic instability [4]. To take into
account the complexity of human cancers, computational comparison of normal cellular sub-
set gene expression signatures to cancer subtypes has been used to gain insights into the cell of
origin of human cancers [60,61]. Here we show that BSC gene expression signature closely
resembles the human SqCC gene signature, suggesting that human lung BSCs are the candi-
date cells of origin of lung SqCC. An important caveat of such comparisons is the genetic sig-
nature of end-stage tumours may not fully represent the origin of the cancer. Our hypothesis

 will therefore need to be validated by introducing multiple genetic alterations in primary
human lung cell subsets and determining their propensity for SqCC formation.
Invasive SqCC develops from preinvasive lesions in tobacco-smoking patients [62]. One-
third of patients with basal cell hyperplasia will progress to carcinoma [63]; however, there are
currently no biologic biomarkers to predict disease progression. Such biomarkers would
greatly inform follow-up monitoring and perhaps enable early detection of invasive lesions.
The discovery that BSCs are NHEJ competent and proliferate in response to DNA damage sug-
gests that high levels of DNA-PKcs activation in cigarette smoking-induced basal cell hyper-
plasia may be a predictor of progression towards malignant disease. Assessment of the
correlation between NHEJ activity in basal cell hyperplasia and progression to malignant dis-
ease would be necessary to validate this hypothesis. Advanced SqCCs are notoriously resistant
to DNA-damaging agents [64]. Our data suggest that patients with strong expression of DNA
repair genes such as PRKDC may benefit from therapy combining inhibitors of DNA repair
and DNA-damaging agents. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of fine-tuned con-
trol of DNA repair in stem/progenitor cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents, in which both
unfaithful repair and failure to repair contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Human Samples and Mice
Adjacent normal lung specimens (confirmed by histology) were obtained through the Victo-
rian Cancer Biobank from surgically resected tissue of lung cancer patients. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients by the Victorian Cancer BioBank prior to inclusion in
the study, according to protocols approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) (approval #10/04). Patients were
classified as current smokers (quit <10 y prior to surgery), exsmokers (quit >10 y), or never
smokers (smoked less than 100 lifetime cigarettes). C57/Bl6 mice (8–12-wk-old males) were
bred at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute breeding facility, and SCIDprkdc mice (8–12-wk-old
males) were obtained from the Animal Resource Centre (Australia). All animal experiments
were approved by the WEHI Animal Ethics Committee (Approval #2013.028). Mice were
maintained in our animal facilities according to institutional guidelines.
Human Lung Cell Preparation
Lung tissue was classified as either large airway (LA, containing bronchi, cartilaginous airways,
and attached alveolar tissue) or small airway (SA, containing bronchioles and attached alveolar
tissue) and was processed either immediately or held intact for a maximum of 48 h at 4˚C in
DMEM/F12 media (Gibco) supplemented with 1 mg/mL of penicillin and streptomycin (Invi-
trogen). Samples were minced and then digested for 1 h at 37˚C with 2 mg/mL collagenase
(Worthington) and 200 U/mL deoxyribonuclease (Worthington) in 0.2% D-glucose (Sigma)
in DPBS (Gibco). The cell suspension was strained through a 100 μm cell strainer and washed
with 2% FCS-PBS, followed by red blood cell lysis to obtain a single-cell suspension.
Human Lung Staining and FACS Sorting
Cells were blocked with rat immunoglobulin and CD16/CD32 FCγ II and III antibody (WEHI
Monoclonal Antibody Facility) for 10 min at 4˚C, followed by incubation with CD45-PE
(HI30, BD Pharmingen), CD235a-PE (GA-R2, BD Pharmingen), CD140b-PE (28D4, BD
Pharmingen), CD31-PE (WM59, BD Pharmingen), EpCAM-FITC (VU-1D9, Stem Cell Tech-
nologies), CD49f-PE-CY7 (GoH3, eBioscience), CD166-biotin (105902, R&D systems), and

 Podoplanin-APC (NC-08, BioLegend, also known as T1α) for 25 min at 4˚C. The cells were
then stained with streptavidin-APC-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen) before being washed and resus-
pended in 0.5 μg/mL propidium iodide. The cells were sorted on an Aria cytometer (BD Bio-
sciences) using a 100 μm nozzle and processed immediately after sorting.
Intracellular FACS Staining
Human cells were prepared and stained as for sorting using LIVE/DEAD Aqua (Life Technol-
ogies) as a viability marker. Cells were fixed and permeabilised using the BD Fix/Perm kit (BD
Biosciences) and stained with keratin-5 (polyclonal, Covance), MUC5AC (45M1, Thermo Sci-
entific), acetylated-tubulin (6-11B-1, Sigma Aldrich), SCGB1A1 (polyclonal, Millipore), or
phospho-histone H2A.X Ser139-BV421 (γH2AX, N1-431, BD Horizon) antibodies. Cells were
stained where appropriate with either anti-rabbit Alexa594 or anti-mouse Alexa594 (Molecu-
lar Probes) before analysis on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). For 40,6-diamidino-2-pheny-
lindole (DAPI) nuclear content analysis, cells were subjected to an additional fixation step in
Permeabilise Plus buffer according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Biosciences) and
deoxyribonuclease treatment (Worthington) before staining with DAPI. All analyses were per-
formed using FlowJo software.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Sorted cells were immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and postfixed in osmium tetroxide
according to standard electron microscopy protocols. The cells were subsequently embedded
in EPON Araldite resin. Ultra-thin sections were cut on a Leica UCT ultramicrotome, stained
with lead citrate and uranylacetate, and imaged using a Gatan Ultrascan camera on a Hitachi
H-7500 transmission electron microscope.
In Vitro Colony-Forming Assay
Freshly sorted cells were resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 1 mg/mL
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), B27 (Gibco), 4 μg/mL heparin (Sigma Aldrich), 100 ng/
mL EGF (Sigma Aldrich), insulin-transferrin-selenium (Gibco), 50 ng/mL human fibroblast
growth factor-10 (R&D Systems), and 25 ng/mL human hepatocyte growth factor (R&D Sys-
tems), hereafter referred to as base media. A 50:50 matrigel (BD Biosciences):base media mix
in a 96-well plate was allowed to set for 15 min at 37˚C, before 2,000 cells were plated in media
on top of the matrigel. Cells were grown for 14 d at 37˚C in 5% CO2 and 5% O2 before colonies
were photographed, counted, and processed for immunofluorescence studies.
Immunofluorescence of Colonies in Matrigel
Matrigel colonies were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Colonies were per-
meabilised with 0.3% TritonX in PBS for 10 min at 4˚C then rinsed in 100 mM glycine in PBS.
Blocking was performed with 10% goat serum in immunofluorescence buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.2%
TritonX-100, and 0.05% Tween20 in PBS) followed by primary antibody staining with keratin-
5 (polyclonal, Covance) or pro-SFTPC (polyclonal, Millipore) antibodies. Secondary antibod-
ies were anti-rabbit Alexa594 or Alexa488 (Molecular Probes). Counterstaining of nuclei was
performed using DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). The colonies were mounted on SuperFrost slides
before 3-D imaging with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 780). All imaging
analyses were performed using Fiji software.

 γ-Irradiation
Whole fragments of human lungs were either nonirradiated (control) or γ-irradiated at 6 Gy
and left to recover in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 1 mg/mL of penicillin and strep-
tomycin for 1 or 24 h post irradiation at 37˚C in 5% CO2 and 5% O2. At each time point, tissue
portions were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma) overnight at
room temperature before paraffin embedding and sectioning for immunostaining. For mouse
immunofluorescence studies, mice (C57Bl/6, SCIDprkdc) were exposed to 6 Gy of irradiation.
Tracheas and lungs were harvested at 1, 4, 8, 24, or 96 h post irradiation and fixed/inflated in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 overnight at 4˚C. Tracheas and lungs were then embed-
ded in paraffin and sectioned for immunostaining. For mouse FACS analysis of cell cycle and
apoptosis 24 h post IR, mice were irradiated and immediately injected with bromodeoxyuri-
dine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, Amersham). For FACS analysis of γH2AX expression, mouse lungs
and tracheas were harvested 1 h or 4 h post irradiation, and single-cell suspensions generated
as described below. This timing corresponds to 4 h or 7 h post irradiation including the time
taken to generate single-cell suspensions.
Bleomycin
Trachea and lungs from mice (C57/Bl6, SCIDprkdc) were harvested at 1, 4, 8, 24, or 96 h after
bleomycin (Hospira) administration (IV 40 mg/kg) before fixation, sectioning, and immunos-
taining as described above. For FACS analysis of γH2AX expression, mouse lungs and tracheas
were harvested 1 h post injection, and single-cell suspensions generated as described below.
This timing corresponds to 4 h post bleomycin injection including the time taken to generate
single-cell suspensions.
Mouse Lung Cell Preparation
Lungs were minced and then digested in 2 mg/mL collagenase in 0.2% glucose-PBS for 45 min
at 37˚C. Red blood cells were lysed (0.64% NH4Cl) and cells filtered through a 40 μm cell
strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension. Mouse lung cells were blocked as described for
human cells and stained with CD45-PE-Cy7 (30-F11, BioLegend), CD31-PE-Cy7 (390, BioLe-
gend), EpCAM-APC-Cy7 (G8.8, BioLegend), and CD104-FITC (346-11A, BioLegend). Alveo-
lar cells were identified as CD45-CD31-EpCAMhiCD104lo as described previously [15]. Cells
were then fixed and subjected either to Brdu/7-AAD staining (BD BrdU Flow Kit) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions to identify apoptotic and proliferating cells or to γH2AX
(20E3, Cell Signalling) staining.
Mouse Tracheal Cell Preparation
Tracheal epithelial cells were isolated according to the protocol from Rock et al. [12]. Briefly,
tracheas were cut into four pieces and incubated in 16 U/mL dispase (Roche) for 40 min at
room temperature. Digestion was stopped with the addition of 5% FCS-DMEM (Gibco), and
the epithelium peeled from the trachea. Epithelial sheets were washed and incubated in 2X
trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) for 20 min at 37˚C. Cells were then washed with 5% FCS-DMEM. Cells
were blocked and stained with anti-NGFR (Abcam) or anti-T1α (clone 8.1.1, DHSB) antibod-
ies for 30 min at 4˚C. Cells were incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor488 or anti-hamster
Alexa Fluor647 (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 4˚C. BSCs were identified as NGFR+ or T1α+
cells. Cells were then stained with BrdU, 7-AAD, or γH2AX (γH2AX, 20E3, Cell Signaling
Technology).

 Immunostaining
Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6) or high-pH antigen
retrieval solution (Vector). Sections were blocked in 10% goat serum and incubated with anti-
bodies overnight at 4˚C followed by fluorophore-conjugated antibody for immunofluores-
cence or HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector) for immunohistochemistry.
Antibodies used were phospho DNA-PKcs-S2056 (Abcam) and phospho-histone H2AX
Ser139 (γH2AX, 20E3, Cell Signaling Technology) on human and mouse tissue; RAD51
(14B4, Genetex), T1α (clone 8.1.1, DHSB), and cleaved caspase 3 Asp175 (5A1E, Cell Signaling
Technology) on mouse tissue; and T1α (NC-08, Biolegend) on human tissue. Nuclei were
counterstained with DAPI where appropriate. Images were acquired using a DeltaVision fluo-
rescence microscope (Applied Precision).
RNA Sequencing and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Human and mouse RNA was extracted from snap-frozen sorted cell pellets using a RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen), and DNase treatment was performed using the TURBO DNA-free Kit
(Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA sequencing was performed on
an Illumina HiSeq at the Australian Genome Research Facility. Per human sample, 16–26 mil-
lion 100 bp single-end reads were generated, and 13–17 million 100 bp single-end reads were
generated per mouse sample. For human qPCR analyses, cDNA was generated using the
SuperScript III system (Life Technologies) and subject to qRT-PCR using the Sensimix SYBR
Hi-Rox kit (Bioline) on the Rotorgene RG-6000 (Corbett Research) under standard condi-
tions. Three technical replicates were performed for each sample. Taqman gene expression
assays were used for MUC5AC (Hs0087365_mH) and FOXJ1 (HS00230964_m1) using 18S
(HS99999901_s1) or GAPDH (HS99999905_m1) as reference genes (Life Technologies). The
sequence of the primers is available in S1 Table.
RNA-seq Analysis
Human RNA-seq reads were aligned to the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and mouse reads were
aligned to the mm10 genome using Rsubread [65]. Reads were assigned to Entrez gene IDs
using featureCounts [66] and Rsubread’s in-built RefSeq annotation. The raw sequence data
and read counts are available from GEO series GSE83492 (human) and GSE83991 (mouse).
Filtering and normalization used the edgeR package [67]. Genes were filtered if their counts
per million (CPM) values were above 1 in fewer than three samples for the human data and
above 0.2 in fewer than three samples for the mouse data. Library sizes were normalized by the
trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method [68]. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were
produced using edgeR’s plotMDS function with the default settings. Distances between points
on the MDS plots represent leading fold change, the root-mean-square log2-fold change for
the 500 genes that best distinguish each pair of RNA samples.
Differential expression analyses used the limma package [69]. Counts were transformed to
log2-CPM values with associated precision weights using the voom function [70]. Gene set
tests were performed using roast rotation gene set testing [71]. Signature genes were defined
for each normal cell population to be those genes that were consistently either up- or down-
regulated in that population versus every other cell population of the same species. Differential
expression was assessed for this purpose using limma’s treat function with fold change thresh-
olds varying from 1 to 1.2 and a false discovery rate of 0.05 [72]. Larger fold-change thresholds
were used for populations with more signature genes. A log-fold change was associated with
each signature gene, being the log2-fold change for that gene between the population for
which it is a signature and the next closest population.

 CLCGP Microarray Data
Normalized microarray gene expression profiles for 261 lung cancers were downloaded from
The Clinical Lung Cancer Genome Project (CLCGP) [33]. Gene symbols were converted to
current official symbols with limma’s alias2SymbolTable function. Probes were filtered if their
average log expression was in the bottom 50% or if no official symbol could be assigned. When
more than one probe associated with the same gene, the probe with the highest average expres-
sion was retained. A signature score was computed for each normal lung cell population in
each tumour profile: the signature scores were defined as Sum(wg yg) / Sum(|wg|), where yg is
the log expression of the gene in the tumour and wg is the log-fold change of the gene between
the normal populations. The sums were taken over all signature genes for the normal popula-
tion. Signature scores were scaled to be between 0 and 1 for each normal population. Barcode
plots were created using limma’s barcodeplot function. Correlation between normal expres-
sion signatures and cancer subtypes was assessed using rotation gene set tests, with 9,999 rota-
tions and with the normal cell log-fold changes as gene weights.
TCGA RNA-seq Data
Genewise RNA-seq read counts for 125 lung adenocarcinomas, 224 SqCC, and 54 normal lung
samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project were obtained from GEO series
GSE62944 [73]. Genes were filtered if they failed to achieve 0.1 CPM in at least 54 samples.
TMM normalization was applied, and differential expression between the cancer subtypes and
normal samples was assessed using limma-voom and moderated t tests [70]. The proportion of
the genome altered for each of the lung SqCCs (derived from somatic copy number informa-
tion) was downloaded from the TCGA data portal (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).
Measurement of Telomere Length
Telomere lengths were determined as described previously [74]. Briefly, genomic DNA was
extracted from snap-frozen FACS sorted human lung epithelial pellets or from 293T (ATCC)
snap-frozen cell pellets using an Illustra Tissue and Cells GenomicPrep kit (GE Healthcare).
The mastermix contained Sybr green I (0.75X, Life Technologies), AmpliTaq Gold (0.625 U,
Life Technologies), Buffer II (1X, Life Technologies), MgCl2 (3 mM, Ambion), DTT (1 mM,
Ambion), betaine (1 M, Sigma Aldrich), dNTPs (0.2 mM, Life Technologies), albumin primers
(900 mM, IDT), and telomere primers (900 mM, IDT). The master mix was combined with 20
ng of experimental DNA and analysed in triplicate alongside a four-point 293T standard curve
(50 to 1.85 ng of DNA) using albumin as the single-copy gene. PCR was performed on a Rotor-
gene RG-6000 using the following conditions: (15 min, 95˚C) x 1, (15 s, 94˚C − 15 s, 49˚C) x 2,
(15 s, 94˚C − 10 s, 62˚C −15 s, 74˚C − 10 s, 84˚C − 15 s, 88˚C) x 32. Telomere lengths were cal-
culated by determining the ratio of telomere signal (T) to single-copy gene signal (S) as deter-
mined from the 293T standard curve.
Statistical Analysis
p-Values less than 0.05 were considered significant when conducting univariate tests. Error
bars on plots represent mean ± SEM, and stars indicate significant differences in two-group
comparisons: �p < 0.05, ��p < 0.01, ���p < 0.001.
