Traumatic brain injury often produces executive dysfunction. This characteristic cognitive impairment often causes long-term
problems with behaviour and personality. Frontal lobe injuries are associated with executive dysfunction, but it is unclear how
these injuries relate to corticostriatal interactions that are known to play an important role in behavioural control. We hypothe-
sized that executive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury would be associated with abnormal corticostriatal interactions, a
question that has not previously been investigated. We used structural and functional MRI measures of connectivity to investigate
this. Corticostriatal functional connectivity in healthy individuals was initially defined using a data-driven approach. A constrained
independent component analysis approach was applied in 100 healthy adult dataset from the Human Connectome Project.
Diffusion tractography was also performed to generate white matter tracts. The output of this analysis was used to compare
corticostriatal functional connectivity and structural integrity between groups of 42 patients with traumatic brain injury and 21
age-matched controls. Subdivisions of the caudate and putamen had distinct patterns of functional connectivity. Traumatic brain
injury patients showed disruption to functional connectivity between the caudate and a distributed set of cortical regions, including
the anterior cingulate cortex. Cognitive impairments in the patients were mainly seen in processing speed and executive function, as
well as increased levels of apathy and fatigue. Abnormalities of caudate functional connectivity correlated with these cognitive
impairments, with reductions in right caudate connectivity associated with increased executive dysfunction, information processing
speed and memory impairment. Structural connectivity, measured using diffusion tensor imaging between the caudate and anterior
cingulate cortex was impaired and this also correlated with measures of executive dysfunction. We show for the first time that
altered subcortical connectivity is associated with large-scale network disruption in traumatic brain injury and that this disruption
is related to the cognitive impairments seen in these patients.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly causes persistent
cognitive and behavioural impairments, including executive
dysfunction (Draper and Ponsford, 2008). While these ex-
ecutive problems have been linked to focal frontal lobe
injury (Damasio et al., 1994; Stuss and Alexander, 2007),
dysexecutive problems are often seen in the absence of focal
injury after TBI (Anderson et al., 1995; Bigler, 2001). This
cognitive impairment is associated with reduced structural
integrity of cortico-subcortical connections; however, it is
unclear how it relates to the functional interactions of the
frontal lobes with subcortical structures that are linked to
behavioural control (Little et al., 2010; Leunissen et al.,
2013, 2014). Here we used advanced MRI techniques to
investigate corticostriatal interactions after TBI, to test
whether
functional
and
structural
disruption
of
this
circuitry is associated with cognitive impairments.
Cognitive control processes that underpin executive func-
tion depend on the efficient functioning of corticostriatal
circuits, which are often abnormal in other conditions that
are characterized by executive dysfunction (Mennes et al.,
2011; Unschuld et al., 2012). These circuits integrate both
cognitive and motivational cortical information to facilitate
motor control involved in goal-directed behaviours (Haber,
2016). As TBI disrupts brain network function and striatal
physiology (Donnemiller et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 2005;
Bonnelle et al., 2011; Sharp et al., 2011), one possibility that
has not previously been investigated is that executive dys-
function after TBI is specifically associated with abnormal
corticostriatal functional interactions. The majority of cor-
tical input to the basal ganglia passes through the striatum
(Haber, 2003). The region is organized into subregions
including the caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens,
primarily associated with cognitive, motor and motivational
processes, respectively (Haber, 2003).
Disruption to corticostriatal loops produces executive dys-
function in other diseases. For example, Huntington’s disease
is characterized by progressive degeneration of the striatum,
originating in the caudate (Douaud et al., 2006). Prodromal
Huntington’s disease patients demonstrate poor motor and
executive function, together with disrupted functional and
structural connectivity between cortical areas and the caudate
(Unschuld et al., 2012; McColgan et al., 2015). Caudate
connectivity is also related to executive function in attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD),
which
has
been
demonstrated using response inhibition and cognitive switch-
ing tasks (Mennes et al., 2011). These studies suggest
executive dysfunction after TBI could also be the result of
altered corticostriatal connectivity, particularly in light of the
effects of diffuse axonal injury and the susceptibility of
neuromodulatory control systems such as dopamine that
influence striatal function after TBI (Jenkins et al., 2016).
The functional organization of corticostriatal connections
can be investigated using resting-state functional MRI
(Postuma and Dagher, 2006; Di Martino et al., 2008;
Barnes et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2012). This can be used
to derive the functional connectivity between regions,
which provides an estimate of the strength of their inter-
actions. Specific subdivisions of the striatum are known to
be connected to cortical networks, which reflect their
function (Pauli et al., 2016). Originally these circuits were
thought to be largely segregated, with information pro-
cessed in a parallel fashion (Alexander et al., 1986).
More recently it has become clear that basal ganglia
connectivity
also
incorporates a degree of integration
(Haber and Knutson, 2010; Bell and Shine, 2016). This
configuration allows circuits to interface and produce com-
plex cognitive control behaviours that rely on combining
both cognitive and motivational information (Haber and
Knutson, 2010). We have previously used a multivariate
data-driven approach to identifying complex patterns of
functional connectivity (Leech et al., 2011, 2012). This
method is well suited to identifying overlapping but distinct
patterns of connectivity in regions that show complex func-
tional connectivity, such as the brain’s hub regions that
integrate processing from diverse cortical regions (Leech
et al., 2012). The method avoids the use of a priori-defined
striatal or cortical seed regions to perform connectivity
analyses and instead isolates independent signals and their
corresponding spatial locations in a data-driven manner by
performing an independent component analysis on the
signal within the region of interest.
We have previously used resting-state functional connectiv-
ity to investigate the relationship between cognitive impair-
ment and network dysfunction after TBI. Sustained attention
impairments are associated with disruption to functional
interactions
within
the
default
mode
network
(DMN;
Bonnelle et al., 2011). Abnormal interactions between the
DMN and medial temporal lobes are also related to the
extent of associative memory impairments following TBI
(De Simoni et al., 2016). These changes are often associated
with underlying disruption of the structural connections pro-
duced by diffuse axonal injury, which can be measured using
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For example, DTI measures
of the salience network have been related to efficient DMN
functioning (Bonnelle et al., 2012). The combination of this
multi-modal imaging provides a rich description of network
dysfunction, which we apply here to study altered interactions
between the cortex and subcortical structures following TBI
for the first time.

 Here we use a masked independent component analysis
(mICA) approach to examine striatal functional connectiv-
ity after TBI. First we defined patterns of corticostriatal
functional connectivity in a large healthy dataset (Human
Connectome Project, HCP). These data have high spatial
and temporal resolution, which for the first time allows
striatal connectivity patterns to be separated in a data-
driven way. This analysis provided detailed maps of
corticostriatal interactions, which we used to compare func-
tional connectivity between TBI patients and age-matched
controls. In addition, we used DTI data to test whether
altered functional connectivity between frontal and striatal
structures was associated with damage to the tracts con-
necting them, which would potentially imply a causative
role for diffuse axonal injury in the observed network
dysfunction. We tested the following specific hypotheses:
(i) corticostriatal functional connectivity is abnormally
low following TBI; (ii) disruption in corticostriatal connect-
ivity correlates with impairments in cognitive function; and
(iii) abnormalities in striatal functional connectivity correl-
ates with damage to corticalstriatal tracts.
Materials and methods
Participant demographics and clinical
details
Forty-two patients (five females, mean age 40.6 � 11.7 years,
range
20–65)
following
a
moderate–severe
TBI
at
least
6 months previously were recruited from neurology clinics.
Mean time since injury was 73.1 months ( � 86.9, range
6–366 months). TBI severity was assessed according to the
Mayo Classification (Malec et al., 2007). All patients were
identified as having persistent cognitive problems by the pa-
tient themselves, treating clinician or caregiver. Inclusion
criteria were: age 20–65 years, no significant premorbid psy-
chiatric or neurological history, alcohol or substance misuse,
or significant previous TBI. Exclusion criteria included contra-
indication to MRI and a positive urine drug screen. Written,
informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved
by the West London and GTAC Research Ethics Committee
(14/LO/0067). Six patients were excluded from the functional
imaging analyses based on stringent criteria for assessing the
possible impact of movement during the resting-state scan
(Supplementary
material
and
‘Control
analyses’
section).
Thirty-six patients were thus included in the functional ima-
ging analysis. Diffusion and neuropsychological analysis was
performed with the full dataset of 42 patients.
Twenty-one age and gender-matched healthy controls were
recruited (four females, mean age 39.2 � 12.1, range 21–61).
Participants had no history of psychiatric or neurological ill-
ness, previous TBI, alcohol or substance misuse. All partici-
pants gave written informed consent. One healthy control
was excluded from the functional imaging analyses due to
movement during the resting-state scan (Supplementary mater-
ial and ‘Control analyses’ section). Twenty controls were thus
included in the functional imaging analysis. Diffusion and
neuropsychological analysis was performed with the full data-
set of 21 controls.
Neuropsychological and well-being
assessment
A standardized neuropsychological battery was used to assess
cognitive function, including tests previously shown to be sen-
sitive to TBI-related deficits (Table 1) (Kinnunen et al., 2011).
The Trail Making Test (TMT) and Delis-Kaplan Executive
Function System (D-KEFS) Colour-Word Interference Test
(Stroop) assessed information processing speed and executive
function, including inhibition and task switching (Delis et al.,
2001); Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III) logical memory
subtests I and II and the People Test (PT) from the Doors
and
People
Test
measured
episodic
memory
(Wechsler,
1945);
the
Wechsler
Abbreviated
Scale
for
Intelligence
(WASI)
Matrix
Reasoning
and
Wechsler
Test
of
Adult
Reading (WTAR) assessed reasoning ability and premorbid
IQ, respectively (Wechsler, 1945). A laptop-based choice reac-
tion time (CRT) task measured basic information processing
speed.
Self-report measures were used to assess subjective well-
being in all participants. The Lille Apathy Rating Scale
(LARS) was used to assess apathy (Table 2) (Sockeel et al.,
2006); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
measured feelings of anxiety and depression. The visual ana-
logue scale (VAS-F) evaluated fatigue severity on the day of
scanning (Lee et al., 1991). The Frontal Systems Behaviour
Scale (FrSBe) was used in patients to evaluate subjective
changes
in
behaviour
post-injury
(Table
2)
(Grace
and
Malloy, 2001). Quality of life was assessed using the Short
Form-36 (SF-36) (Table 2) (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992).
Data were found to be non-normally distributed based on
Shapiro-Wilk tests. Group differences in performance were
investigated with the use of Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests for
independent samples (one-tailed) and Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests for
paired samples (one-tailed) were used to assess longitudinal
changes in FrSBe scores.
Structural and functional MRI data
acquisition
MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (http://www.
humanconnectome.org/) were collected on a 3 T Siemens
Connectome Skyra, including a T1-weighted MPRAGE struc-
tural scan, resting-state functional MRI and DTI using multi-
band acquisitions.
MRI data from a separate cohort of TBI patients and
healthy control subjects, were acquired using a 3 T Siemens
Magnetom Verio Syngo with a 32-channel head coil. Standard
clinical MRI was collected. Resting-state functional MRI data
were also acquired, alongside a high-resolution T1-weighted
image and DTI (see Supplementary material for details on
the acquisition parameters for both cohorts).

 high spatial and temporal resolution taken from the HCP.
These results were then used to assess group differences in
corticostriatal connectivity in a separate sample of healthy con-
trols and TBI patients. Structural connectivity analysis was
informed by the functional connectivity results in the TBI pa-
tients. Disruption of functional connectivity was particularly
observed between caudate subdivisions and the cingulate
cortex (see ‘Results’ section). Therefore, to investigate whether
abnormalities in caudate functional connectivity were asso-
ciated with damage to relevant white matter tracts, the HCP
dataset was used to define tracts extending from the caudate to
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
Human Connectome Project analysis
Preprocessing
Data for 100 randomly selected healthy participants (41 males,
age range: 22–36) from the HCP were analysed. Preprocessing
of both resting-state functional MRI and diffusion data was
performed by the HCP consortium with FMRIB Software
Library (FSL) and Freesurfer (version 5.2). A subset of 94
healthy participants from this HCP cohort was used for the
tractography analysis. For details on preprocessing procedures
see Supplementary material (see also Glasser et al., 2013;
Smith et al., 2013; Van Essen et al., 2013).
Defining striatal subdivisions based on functional signals
MICA was performed with the mICA Toolbox on the HCP
preprocessed data (Moher Alsady et al., 2016; Fig. 1A). MICA
was constrained to extract independent components within a
striatal mask, defined a priori using the Harvard-Oxford prob-
abilistic anatomical atlas within FSL (thresholded at 450%).
This pipeline allows the HCP data to be spatially smoothed
using a 6 mm kernel after masking, avoiding signal contamin-
ation from outside the striatum. MICA was run to extract 12
independent components (DIM12), based on previous work,
which identified 12 corticostriatal functional networks (Di
Martino et al., 2008). To establish whether decomposing stri-
atal signal into 12 independent components is representative of
the underlying data, mICA was also run using dimensionalities
in the range of 2–20. Spatial cross-correlations were performed
between dimensionalities to assess the stability of components.
High spatial correlations would suggest that DIM12 compo-
nents are identifiable and robust across various ICA decom-
positions. In addition, to determine the degree to which the
DIM12 striatal components were spatially separable, pairwise
correlations were performed between each pair of components.
Low
correlations
suggest
good
spatial
separation.
Subsequently, the striatum was parcellated into 12 subdiv-
isions based on z-transformations of the ICA results, with
voxels allocated to a particular subdivision based on the com-
ponent with the highest z-score at that location (Fig. 2).
Defining corticostriatal functional networks with the
Human Connectome Project data
A combined mICA and dual-regression approach was used to
define corticostriatal functional connectivity networks within
the HCP resting-state functional MRI data (Bonnelle et al.,
2011; Sharp et al., 2011; Leech et al., 2012; Fig. 1A). This
approach provides a voxel-wise measure of functional connect-
ivity that represents the temporal correlation between each
voxel and the activity of a region or network of interest
(Sharp et al., 2011). Details of the method can be found in
our previous work (Sharp et al., 2011; Leech et al., 2012).
To define corticostriatal functional networks within the HCP
cohort, 12 group-level striatal independent components from

 the mICA procedure described above were used to produce
subject-specific corticostriatal functional connectivity networks
(Fig. 1A). A permutation-based one-sample t-test was then run
to generate group-level maps of functional connectivity for
each
component.
Functional
connectivity
networks
were
defined using non-parametric permutation testing, thresholded
using the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method
and corrected for multiple comparisons with a family-wise
error (FWE) rate of P 5 0.05. These analyses were constrained
within a grey matter mask, provided through FSL. Resulting
networks were thresholded and binarized to investigate be-
tween group differences in corticostriatal functional connectiv-
ity between TBI and control datasets (Fig. 1B).
Defining caudate to anterior cingulate cortex white
matter tracts with the Human Connectome Project data
Tractography was performed using MRtrix (Tournier et al.,
2012). This framework combines estimation of fibre orienta-
tions using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) with a
probabilistic streamlines approach to define structural connect-
ivity. Four separate regions of interest were used to drive the
tractography, consisting of the four caudate subdivisions of the
striatal parcellation (Figs 1 and 5). Streamlines (n = 3000)
seeded within these regions of interest were generated from
each subject’s fibre orientation density image and terminated
using an ACC mask, defined a priori using the Harvard-
Oxford atlas (thresholded at 450%). Fibre tracking was also
terminated if the curvature angle was 445�. Each individual’s
tract density image was thresholded to remove voxels contain-
ing 55% of total number of streamlines. Tractograms were
combined to create single tracts where 425% of subjects
had data. This resulted in four white matter tracts: right an-
terior caudate to ACC, left anterior caudate to ACC, right
posterior caudate to ACC and left posterior caudate to ACC.
To investigate the specificity of the findings to white matter
tracts associated with caudate-ACC structural connections,
additional ‘control’ tracts were also tested. These included
(i) a striatum to primary motor cortex white matter tract

Figure 1 Overview of the imaging methods used to assess corticostriatal connections. (A) A combined mICA and dual-regression
approach was used to define corticostriatal functional connectivity networks within the HCP resting-state data. MICA was performed and
constrained to extract independent components within a striatal mask. Corticostriatal functional connectivity of the individual independent
components was assessed with dual regression. (B) The independent components and associated corticostriatal functional connectivity networks
defined with the HCP dataset were then used to evaluate functional connectivity differences in a clinical resting-state dataset including TBI patients
and healthy controls. (C) Tractography analysis was performed with the HCP data between selected striatal independent components and the
ACC. These white matter tracts were then used to assess differences in white matter integrity between TBI patients and controls.

Clinical study data
Preprocessing
Data were analysed using FSL (Version 5.0.6; Smith et al.,
2004) (see Supplementary material for details on preprocessing
of the resting-state functional MRI and diffusion data).
Defining differences in corticostriatal functional connec-
tivity between controls and patients with TBI
A combined mICA and dual-regression approach was used to
assess corticostriatal functional connectivity differences be-
tween
patient and control groups (Bonnelleet al., 2011;
Sharp et al., 2011; Fig. 1B). Twelve dual regressions were
performed. For each dual regression a different striatal inde-
pendent component was used to perform the analysis; each
was constrained to voxels within the corresponding whole-
brain network identified within the HCP cohort. Between-
group effects were assessed using non-parametric permutation
testing (Winkler et al., 2014), thresholded using TFCE and
FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons at P 5 0.05.
Measures of altered corticostriatal functional connectivity in
TBI patients were correlated with neuropsychological and self-
report measures to explore whether these changes were related
to particular cognitive impairments identified in the patients.
Spearman’s correlations (referred to in the results as rho) were
used and corrected for multiple comparisons using a false-dis-
covery rate (FDR) of P 5 0.05. Spearman partial correlations
were also run to account for the effects of age and time since
injury.
To investigate the specificity of post-traumatic changes in
corticostriatal connectivity, we performed additional ‘control’
functional connectivity analyses to investigate whether tha-
lamo-cortical and fronto-parietal connectivity was affected by
TBI. Six dual regression analyses were performed. Four separ-
ate subthalamic regions of interest were used to examine
thalamo-cortical connectivity. These were derived from the
FSL Oxford Thalamic Connectivity Probability Atlas, with
subdivisions of the thalamus defined on the basis of their
white matter connectivity to cortical areas. We focused on bi-
lateral thalamic subdivisions projecting to prefrontal and
motor cortical areas, thresholded at 25% (Supplementary
Fig. 2). In addition, fronto-parietal functional connectivity
was investigated within left and right fronto-parietal intrinsic
connectivity networks, defined from functional connectivity
analysis of resting-state functional MRI data (Smith et al.,
2009). Functional connectivity was compared between TBI
and control groups.
In addition, to investigate the specificity of subcortical-cor-
tical interactions for executive function we also investigated
whether thalamo-cortical functional connectivity to the ACC
was related to behaviour. This particular analysis was moti-
vated by the results of the cortico-striatal analysis, which was
the main focus of the paper. Thalamic functional connectivity
to the ACC was investigated using functional connectivity
derived from the four thalamic subdivisions. For each of
these analyses, mean functional connectivity values for each
subject were extracted from the ACC (as defined above).
Spearman’s correlation was used to test the relationship be-
tween mean functional connectivity values and all neuropsy-
chological tests. This included measures shown to correlate
with caudate functional connectivity as well as our other cog-
nitive measures.
Defining differences in white matter tract structural con-
nectivity between healthy controls and patients with TBI
A region of interest approach was used to assess white matter
structure differences between TBI patients and healthy con-
trols. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusion metrics were
extracted from the four caudate–ACC white matter tracts
defined using the HCP data. Data were also extracted from
the control tracts. Between-group differences were evaluated
using linear mixed-effects models. Group was defined as the
between-subjects factor, region of interest as the within-sub-
jects factor (fixed effects) and subject was defined as a random
effect to model variability in subject intercepts. Age was
included as a covariate. Post hoc t-tests were used to investi-
gate any significant main effects.
Diffusion metrics from each region of interest were corre-
lated with measures of functional connectivity for the corres-
ponding caudate subdivision to assess whether functional
changes
reflected
the
underlying
structural
variability.
Correlations were also performed with information processing
speed and executive function measures shown to be associated
with changes in caudate functional connectivity. Spearman
partial correlations were run to account for the effects of age
and time since injury, and corrected for multiple comparisons
using FDR of P 5 0.05. To assess whether combining func-
tional connectivity and diffusion measures explained more of
the variability in cognitive performance than either imaging
measure alone, linear models were run. Variability was quan-
tified by the residual sum of squares and models compared
using F-tests. Specifically, functional connectivity and frac-
tional anisotropy from the four caudate subdivisions and
tracts, respectively were included in four separate models to
assess
variability
in
executive
function
(i.e.
Stroop
task
performance).
Lesion analysis
Focal lesion masks were generated to determine lesion volume
and create overlap maps. This was done to ensure that the
functional connectivity results were not primarily driven by
lesioned cortex. Lesions were also reported by a neuroradiol-
ogist (Supplementary material, Supplementary Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Table 1).

 Making and Stroop, and memory impairments on the Logical
Memory and Doors and People tests were impaired after
correction for multiple comparisons (Table 1). The WTAR
estimate of IQ was lower in the TBI group. Performance on
other measures differed between groups but did not survive
correction for multiple comparisons (Table 1).
TBI patients also reported increased apathy, which af-
fected both the physical (action initiation) and cognitive
(intellectual curiosity) domains, as measured by the LARS
(Table 2). Increases in apathy, together with behavioural
evidence of executive
dysfunction
were also apparent
using the FrSBe (Table 2). These did not differ significantly
from caregiver assessments, suggesting a good level of self-
awareness in the patients (P 4 0.5). Patients reported sig-
nificant levels of fatigue and felt more depressed than
healthy controls. Perceived general health was significantly
lower than that reported by healthy controls (Table 2).
Imaging
Distinct subdivisions of the striatum defined on the
basis of their local functional connectivity
Striatal subdivisions were identified based on distinct pat-
terns of local functional connectivity calculated from the
HCP data. Twelve independent but spatially overlapping
subdivisions were identified across the caudate nucleus, pu-
tamen and nucleus accumbens (Fig. 2A). Four subdivisions
were located in anterior and posterior parts of the right and
left caudate. Predominantly left and right lateralized puta-
men components were also identified. No distinct subdiv-
isions
within
the
nucleus
accumbens
were
identified;
however, both anterior caudate and two anterior putamen
subdivisions extended into this region.
The spatial overlap between components was maximal
within the right putamen and nucleus accumbens, where a
maximum of five subdivisions overlapped (Fig. 2C). Spatial
pairwise correlations were performed for each pair of com-
ponents to establish the degree of spatial separation between
subdivisions (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The highest spatial
correlation coefficient was 0.11, which suggests that, al-
though there is some spatial overlap, ICA successfully pro-
duced striatal subdivisions with reasonable spatial separation.
Striatal subdivisions are associated with distinct
corticostriatal networks
Next we tested how activity in the striatal subdivisions cor-
related with cortical activity (Fig. 2A). The four caudate sub-
divisions showed similar patterns of functional connectivity,
which included the anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri,
as well as the thalamus, insula, cerebellum, supramarginal
gyrus, superior and inferior frontal gyri (Fig. 2B). Putamen
subdivisions were associated with more restricted networks
including the caudate, insular cortex, thalamus, cingulate and
paracingulate gyri and motor cortical areas.
Caudate functional connectivity is reduced following
traumatic brain injury
Next we investigated whether striatal functional connectivity
was affected by TBI. Caudate functional connectivity was
reduced in the TBI group (Fig. 3). All four subdivisions of
the caudate showed reduced cortical functional connectivity
in patients compared to controls. A similar pattern of abnor-
mal functional connectivity was seen across these subdiv-
isions. Reduced striatal functional connectivity to large
parts of the anterior cingulate cortex, extending into the
superior frontal gyrus was observed. In addition, the right
anterior caudate subdivision showed reduced functional con-
nectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex extending into the
precuneus. Reduced functional connectivity to parts of the in-
ferior and middle frontal gyri and insulae bilaterally was also
seen (Fig. 3). No other striatal subdivisions showed signifi-
cant changes in functional connectivity between patients and
controls. In addition, thalamo-cortical and fronto-parietal
connectivity was not significantly different in patients com-
pared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

with executive dysfunction and fatigue

with cognitive impairment (Fig. 4B). After correcting for

recall, were not correlated with thalamic-ACC functional
connectivity even if multiple comparison correction was
not performed (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary
Fig. 2).
Caudate to ACC structural connectivity is abnormal
following TBI
Next we investigated whether abnormalities in functional
connectivity were associated with underlying white matter
disruption (Fig. 5). We focused this analysis on the structural
connections between the caudate subdivisions and the ACC,
because these regions showed a common pattern of abnormal
functional connectivity that correlated with cognitive per-
formance (Fig. 5A). TBI patients showed microstructural
abnormalities in the four tracts connecting the ACC to caud-
ate subdivisions (Fig. 5B). A significant group effect was pre-
sent

fractional
anisotropy
[F(1,60) = 10.61,
P = 0.002] and mean diffusivity [F(1,60) = 7.63, P = 0.008].
Post hoc t-tests demonstrated that fractional anisotropy was
reduced and mean diffusivity was increased in all tracts
(P 5 0.05, FDR corrected). After correction for multiple com-
parisons and partialling out the effects of age and time since
injury, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures
correlated with information processing speed and executive
function measures (Table 3 and Fig. 5). Specifically, fractional
anisotropy within the right caudate to ACC tracts (anterior
and posterior) were correlated with both measures of infor-
mation processing and executive function corrected for base-
line speed (P 5 0.05; Fig. 5C), whereas only the left posterior
caudate tract was correlated with these measures (P 5 0.05).
Mean diffusivity measures were correlated with information
processing and executive function within the posterior right
and left caudate tracts (P 5 0.05) (Table 3). No significant
relationships were found in healthy controls.
Interestingly, there was no correlation between measures
of caudate structural integrity and functional connectivity,
despite the fact that they both correlated with similar cog-
nitive measures. To assess the relative contributions of frac-
tional anisotropy and functional connectivity to executive
function, linear models including both measures were run.
For three of the four caudate subdivisions/tracts, including
both these measures explained more variability than just

 including fractional anisotropy (P 5 0.05). However, for
the right caudate subdivisions/tracts, the combined models
did not explain significantly more variance compared to
including functional connectivity alone, suggesting that
functional connectivity explains more of the variability in
performance than fractional anisotropy.
Patients with TBI also showed microstructural abnorm-
alities in control tracts, including the striatum to motor
cortex, corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, infer-
ior fronto-occipital
fasciculus
and
cingulo-hippocampal
tracts. A significant group effect was present for both frac-
tional anisotropy [F(1,60) = 14.47, P = 0.0003] and mean
diffusivity [F(1,60) = 12.36, P = 0.0008]. Differences were
present in all tracts except within the left cingulo-hippo-
campal tract. Information processing speed and executive
function impairments were also correlated with changes in
fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in control tracts.
Following multiple comparison correction and accounting
for the effects of age and time since injury, correlations
with fractional anisotropy were restricted to the genu and
splenium of the corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radi-
ation and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (P 5 0.05;
Fig. 5C). In contrast, correlations with mean diffusivity
changes were seen in the striatum to motor cortex tract,

and

 patients and one healthy control exceeded criteria for ex-
cessive motion and were thus excluded from further ima-
ging
analysis
(Supplementary
material).
All
remaining
participants’ data were de-noised using FSL FIX. This con-
trolled for any residual effects of motion on functional con-
nectivity. Motion was minimal across all the remaining
participants (50.31 mm in mean frame-wise displacement).
Following these exclusions, there was no evidence for
group differences in motion and no evidence that motion
correlated with functional connectivity. No significant dif-
ferences in mean frame-wise displacement were found be-
tween groups [t(39.8) = 1.5, P = 0.151], with TBI patients
and healthy controls demonstrating an average of 0.16 mm
and 0.14 mm, respectively. No significant differences in
blood oxygen level-dependent signal intensity (DVARS) be-
tween groups were found [t(38.05) = �1.33, P = 0.192].
There were also no correlations between caudate functional
connectivity and mean frame-wise displacement (P 4 0.3
for all four subdivisions).
Stability of the striatal subdivisions across different
ICA dimensionalities
ICA can be performed at different dimensionalities i.e. dif-
ferent numbers of striatal subdivisions can be derived
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). We tested whether the 12 subdiv-
isions we studied were reproduced at different dimension-
alities. An ICA was run at dimensionalities ranging from 2
to 20. Spatial correlations were then performed between

 each of the 12 striatal subdivisions derived from the ori-
ginal ICA (DIM12) and all components resulting from the
additional ICA dimensionalities. The spatial correlations
suggest that the striatal subdivisions derived from DIM12
can be stably identified when dimensionalities above �10
are used (Supplementary Fig. 1B). This stability provides
reassurance that decomposing striatal signal into 12 inde-
pendent components is representative of the underlying
data (Smith et al., 2009; Leech et al., 2011; Geranmayeh
et al., 2014).
Discussion
For the first time we show that patients with cognitive im-
pairment after TBI show abnormal patterns of striatal func-
tional connectivity. Within the striatum, these were only
seen in the connectivity of subdivisions of the caudate,
where reduced functional connectivity to large-scale cortical
and subcortical networks was observed. Distinct patterns of
functional connectivity were seen in other striatal regions,
but these were not abnormal when compared with controls.
Group differences in thalamo-cortical and fronto-parietal
functional connectivity were not observed. The strength
of right caudate functional connectivity correlated with in-
formation processing, memory and executive abnormalities,
which
are
hallmarks
of
the
chronic
effects
of
TBI
(Colantonio et al., 2004). Reduced functional connectivity
was particularly observed between caudate subdivision and
the cingulate cortex. In keeping with this reduction in func-
tional connectivity, the structural integrity of the white
matter tract connections from the caudate to ACC was
reduced. This also correlated with processing speed and
executive impairments, although this relationship was also
seen with other damaged white matter tracts. The results
suggest that disruption of fronto-caudate interactions may
underpin common cognitive impairments seen in TBI and
provide an anatomical target for treatment interventions.
Our results build on previous work showing that TBI
often produces disruption of large-scale brain network ac-
tivity that is relevant to cognition (Sharp et al., 2014).
Diffuse axonal injury often damages white matter tract
connections between network nodes. This disrupts network
function, leading to cognitive impairment (Sharp et al.,
2011). Previously, this has mainly been studied by investi-
gating cortico-cortical interactions, but cortical-subcortical
connectivity is likely to be key to many of the cognitive
impairments seen after TBI. Abnormalities of thalamo-cor-
tical pathways have been described, particularly in severely
affected patients (Schiff et al., 2007; Schiff, 2010; Giacino
et al., 2014). However, in other diseases abnormal corticos-
triatal interactions underpin cognitive and motor impair-
ments. The striatum may be particularly vulnerable to the
downstream effects of axonal injury as it receives the
majority
of
cortical
projections
to
the
basal
ganglia
(Haber, 2003) and as it combines both cortical and sub-
cortical information its interactions may be particularly

 important for the efficient functioning of large-scale brain
networks (Bell and Shine, 2016). Although TBI typically
has a complex effect on structural and functional connect-
ivity (Sharp et al., 2014), in this population we did not
observe
a
reduction
in
functional
connectivity
in
a
number of control thalamo-cortical or fronto-parietal ana-
lyses. Furthermore, interindividual variability in the inter-
actions between the thalamus and the ACC did not
correlate
with
cognitive
performance.
Taken
together,
these results suggest that change in corticostriatal connect-
ivity
is
particularly
important
in
producing
executive
dysfunction after TBI, although it is important to consider
this change as one part of a more distributed cortical and
subcortical network that is involved in supporting complex
cognitive functions.
The most striking relationship between caudate func-
tional connectivity and behaviour was in the domain of
executive function, although measures of information pro-
cessing speed and memory function also showed relation-
ships. Executive functions encompass various cognitive
control processes, including information processing, conflict
monitoring and action control (Heyder et al., 2004).
Executive dysfunction underpins many characteristic prob-
lems seen after TBI, such as behavioural disinhibition and
altered personality (Damasio et al., 1994). However, the
neural
basis
for
these
problems
remains
unclear.
Corticostriatal structural and functional pathways link pre-
frontal and anterior cingulate cortices through the striatum
into the basal ganglia (Kunishio and Haber, 1994; Haber
and Knutson, 2010) and have long been implicated in ex-
ecutive control processes (Heyder et al., 2004; Shenhav
et al., 2013). Resting-state corticostriatal functional con-
nectivity is correlated with executive performance in both
healthy subjects and in diseases such as schizophrenia,
Huntington’s disease and ADHD (Mennes et al., 2011;
Unschuld et al., 2012; Su et al., 2013; Gordon et al.,
2015). Future work could investigate in a more precise
way how abnormal caudate interactions produced by TBI
relate to specific patterns of executive impairment. Event-
related functional MRI studies are likely to be informative
for identifying dynamic changes in functional connectivity
and their relationship to moment-to-moment changes in
executive control.
We also demonstrated that caudate connectivity correlated
with levels of fatigue; however overall, there were fewer
correlations with functional outcome measures compared
to neuropsychological assessments. This may be because of
self-report measures being inherently more susceptible to
confounds such as a lack of insight and response bias.
Although similarities are present between certain corti-
costriatal networks, a caudate-specific pattern of functional
connectivity was identified and delineates an ‘executive con-
trol’ network, including areas such as the thalamus, anter-
ior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortex. These networks
associated with bilateral caudate were disrupted in TBI,
whereas putamen connectivity was unaffected. This is simi-
lar to functional connectivity changes seen in Huntington’s
disease, a disorder initially characterized by degeneration
and altered connectivity of the caudate and subsequent ex-
ecutive dysfunction (Unschuld et al., 2012). Importantly,
despite the inherent heterogeneity of injury mechanism
and pathology, we demonstrate a similar disruption in
caudate connectivity across our TBI cohort. This common
effect may result from the striatum’s central role as part of
a subcortical hub of information processing and integration
(Bell and Shine, 2016), rendering it particularly vulnerable
to disruption irrespective of aetiology. Although the influ-
ence of the caudate for cognitive function needs to be con-
sidered in the context of a more distributed brain network,
the results suggest that diverse patterns of brain injury
converge to produce a common and cognitively important
disruption to caudate interactions.
Previous research has shown that the caudate is specific-
ally associated with executive function (Grahn et al., 2008),
with a right-lateralized system particularly involved (Casey
et al., 1997; Hart et al., 2013). For example, in ADHD
where impairments in executive function and attention
are also prevalent, a right cortico-caudate network has
been implicated, including areas such as the inferior frontal
cortices, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate and caudate nu-
cleus (Mennes et al., 2011; Hart et al., 2013). In addition,
caudate activity during an executive function task has been
shown to be associated with prefrontal measures of struc-
tural connectivity (Casey et al., 2007).
The dorsal ACC plays a central role in cognitive control
and the regions dense connectivity with the caudate suggest
its interactions with the striatum is important for this func-
tion (Kemp and Powell, 1970; Yeterian and Van Hoesen,
1978). Functional imaging has shown the involvement of
the ACC during the exertion of cognitive control. For ex-
ample, the region robustly activates when conflict exists
between potential actions, as exemplified by the Stroop
and other similar tasks (Kerns et al., 2004; Ham et al.,
2013). The region has been implicated in a range of pro-
cesses, including reward processing, conflict monitoring,
and action selection (Shenhav et al., 2013). The ACC
may play a particular role in the allocation of control
based on the estimated value of that control (Heyder
et al., 2004; Shenhav et al., 2013), with interactions be-
tween the striatum and the ACC perhaps important for
adjusting behaviour through biasing response selection as
a result of this evaluation (O’Reilly and Frank, 2006;
Shenhav et al., 2013; Wiecki and Frank, 2013). These ob-
servations are clinically relevant. In addition to failures of
cognitive control in Huntington’s disease, children with
ADHD fail to activate the ACC during performance on
the Stroop task, suggesting that their cognitive impairments
may result from a loss of ACC input during the inhibition
of routine responses (Bush et al., 1999). Our results suggest
that disruption to connectivity between the dorsal ACC and
the caudate leads to the inability to execute cognitive con-
trol appropriately, resulting in disordered behaviour and
disability.

 There are a number of potential causes for altered func-
tional connectivity following TBI. It is possible that changes
in functional connectivity reflect the pattern of structural
brain injury, which might damage either grey or white
matter. One mechanism is that structural injury might dir-
ectly injure the fronto-striatal white matter tracts that con-
nect cortical and subcortical structures. In keeping with this
mechanism is the observation that widespread changes in
white matter structure were found in the TBI patients.
Altered fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity was
seen in the caudate to ACC connections as well as striatal
connections to the motor cortex and in the corpus callo-
sum. White matter tract structure was also correlated with
information processing and executive function measures in
a number of tracts suggesting a more general relationship
with executive function impairment than that of functional
connectivity. This suggests that diffuse axonal injury may
lead to more specific functional changes in connections
implicated in executive function, although this was not a
specific relationship as altered white matter integrity was
widespread and correlations with executive function were
observed in other areas.
Focal brain lesions might also contribute to the func-
tional connectivity abnormalities observed. One possibility
is that the presence of focal lesions might confound the
functional connectivity analysis through a direct effect of
damaged brain tissue in the regions where functional con-
nectivity was calculated. We examined this issue in part by
checking whether the location and extent of these lesions
were contributing to group differences in functional con-
nectivity. There was only minimal spatial overlap between
focal lesions and areas of altered caudate functional con-
nectivity. Furthermore, when subjects with lesions in areas
of functional connectivity change were completely removed,
we still observed a strong relationship between functional
connectivity and executive dysfunction in TBI patients, pro-
viding strong evidence that the results are not directly pro-
duced by the effects of focal lesions. A more interesting
possibility is that a remote effect of focal lesions might be
seen i.e. a type of diaschesis. Our analysis does not resolve
this issue, as patients with focal lesions remote from the
areas included in the functional connectivity analysis were
included in all analyses.
The starting point for our analysis was data from the
HCP study of healthy subjects, acquired using the most
advanced MRI acquisition protocols. This has high spatial
and temporal resolution providing an optimal starting
point for analysis. This allowed us to identify distinct func-
tional subdivisions of the striatum in a data-driven way,
which has not previously been possible using lower reso-
lution data. The striatal subdivisions identified in this way
obeyed anatomical boundaries, such as the separation by
laterality and anterior/posterior dimensions in the caudate.
The subdivisions were spatially separated and robustly
reproduced across different dimensionalities, suggesting
that the functional decomposition used to investigate the
effects of TBI is representative of the underlying data.
There are a number of potential limitations for our study.
One factor that it is important to consider is the effect of
motion on functional connectivity measures. A number of
steps were taken to ensure that movement-induced biases
did not affect the results. Based on strict exclusion criteria,
several subjects (patients and controls) were removed en-
tirely from the imaging analyses. After this step, minimal
motion was present in both groups with no evidence of
group differences. Furthermore, robust motion artefact re-
moval was performed, leaving derived functional connect-
ivity measures that were uncorrelated with movement. As is
common in many studies on TBI, only a small number of
females were recruited. This reflects the gender split that is
seen in the TBI population, as males are at higher risk of
TBI than females. Although gender differences could not be
investigated directly, control and patient groups were
gender-matched, ensuring any gender effects did not influ-
ence the results. Future work should specifically assess how
gender affects outcome following TBI. Another potential
confound is the influence of age on white matter integrity.
However, this is unlikely to have had a significant impact
on the results as age ranges across groups were well
matched and age was included as a covariate in the ana-
lyses. A further potential limitation of this study is the
moderate sample size of the control group. This may
have an impact on our ability to identify brain–behaviour
relationships in the control population, in part because of
lower variability in the experimental measures observed
across the control population. It is likely to be informative
to explore the relationship between caudate connectivity
and executive function in a larger cohort of healthy
individuals.
In summary, we used an advanced data-driven approach
to study the effects of TBI on cortico-striatal connectivity.
Abnormalities
of
cortico-striatal
connectivity
were
observed, with a breakdown in interactions between the
right caudate and ACC strongly associated with executive
dysfunction after TBI.
