Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) represents a major cause of 
mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) (1–4), 
and despite substantial effort, the control of GVHD remains one 
of the key unmet needs in the field. Moreover, prevailing calci-
neurin-based therapies are associated with significant off-target 
toxicities (5, 6) and are not associated with immune tolerance 
induction (7, 8). This has intensified investigation into calci-
neurin-free regimens, employing strategies that have been shown 
in preclinical models to be protolerogenic. Of the new approaches, 
those targeting T cell costimulation are being increasingly inves-
tigated in auto- and alloimmunity (9, 10) and are beginning to be 
explored to prevent and treat acute GVHD (aGVHD) (11–13). One 
of the most potent T cell costimulation pathways occurs through 
CD28:CD80/86 ligation (14). Blockade of the CD80/86 com-
ponent of CD28:CD80/86 costimulation with CTLA4-Ig (using 
either of the 2 FDA-approved formulations, abatacept or belata-
cept) represents the first successful clinical translation of costim-
ulation blockade (9, 11, 12, 15–20). However, targeting CD80/86 
has not been entirely successful in downregulating auto- and 
alloimmunity (10, 21–23) and may be associated with untoward 
immune-activating effects through blockade of CD80/86-depen-
dent coinhibitory pathways (24–35). Given these challenges with 
CTLA4-Ig, there has been growing interest in more selectively tar-
geting CD28 (36–41), and these approaches have shown efficacy 
in selected preclinical models (42–49). Although the molecular 
mechanisms by which CD28 blockade controls T cell alloactiva-
tion have been proposed (50), the comprehensive interrogation 
of the relative efficacy of targeting CD28 versus CD80/86 and 
associated safety signatures (both alone and when combined with 
other immunomodulators) have been undetermined, and these 
aspects, which have not been comprehensively interrogated, rep-
resent key questions in the field, given that reagents targeting both 
CD80/86 and CD28 are now clinically available.
To thoroughly address these mechanistic issues, we used the 
nonhuman primate (NHP) GVHD model to evaluate a clinically 
available therapeutic anti-CD28 Fab′, FR104 (42, 43, 45, 46, 48), 
in order to determine its impact on T cell function, reconstitution, 
and GVHD, both as a monoprophylaxis and combined with the 
Controlling graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major unmet need in stem cell transplantation, and new, targeted 
therapies are being actively developed. CD28-CD80/86 costimulation blockade represents a promising strategy, but targeting 
CD80/CD86 with CTLA4-Ig may be associated with undesired blockade of coinhibitory pathways. In contrast, targeted 
blockade of CD28 exclusively inhibits T cell costimulation and may more potently prevent GVHD. Here, we investigated FR104, 
an antagonistic CD28-specific pegylated-Fab′, in the nonhuman primate (NHP) GVHD model and completed a multiparameter 
interrogation comparing it with CTLA4-Ig, with and without sirolimus, including clinical, histopathologic, flow cytometric, and 
transcriptomic analyses. We document that FR104 monoprophylaxis and combined prophylaxis with FR104/sirolimus led 
to enhanced control of effector T cell proliferation and activation compared with the use of CTLA4-Ig or CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus. 
Importantly, FR104/sirolimus did not lead to a beneficial impact on Treg reconstitution or homeostasis, consistent with 
control of conventional T cell activation and IL-2 production needed to support Tregs. While FR104/sirolimus had a salutary 
effect on GVHD-free survival, overall survival was not improved, due to death in the absence of GVHD in several FR104/
sirolimus recipients in the setting of sepsis and a paralyzed INF-γ response. These results therefore suggest that effectively 
deploying CD28 in the clinic will require close scrutiny of both the benefits and risks of extensively abrogating conventional T 
cell activation after transplant.

uated either as monoprophylaxis or in combination with sirolimus 
for its ability to prevent GVHD in the setting of MHC-haploiden-
tical T cell–replete HCT (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows the resulting 
FR104 pharmacokinetics (PKs) in the current study. During the 
period of antibody dosing, the average FR104 trough was 28.6 
μg/ml ± 2.3 μg/ml, a level previously shown to successfully block 
CD28 in healthy controls (HCs) (46). After antibody discontinu-
ation at day 54, FR104 levels steadily declined, with a terminal 
half-life of 5.6 ± 1.0 days, resulting in undetectable FR104 levels 
after day 66 after transplant (Figure 1B) (45, 46). To directly assess 
CD28 receptor occupancy with FR104 in the setting of HCT, we 
measured the crossblocking of CD28 expression flow cytometri-
cally using a mouse anti-CD28 antibody (clone CD28.2) prior to 
each FR104 dose (Figure 1C). This analysis confirmed more than 
97.5% and more than 99% CD28 blockade on CD4+ and CD8+ T 
mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, and to compare this agent with CTLA4-
Ig–based GVHD prevention strategies (51). These experiments pro-
vide strong evidence for superior control of T cell proliferation and 
activation when CD28 is directly targeted, as compared with when 
CD80/86 is targeted. However, while the combination of anti-
CD28 and sirolimus led to superior GVHD-free survival, it did not 
enhance Treg homeostasis, nor did it improve overall recipient sur-
vival as compared with CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus. These studies under-
score the complex nature of targeted blockade of cosignaling path-
ways and suggest that head-to-head comparisons of these agents 
are indicated in clinical trials for GVHD prevention and treatment.

No Rx (MST = 10 days, P = 0.23 versus No Rx; Figure 2, A and B), 
and sirolimus monoprophylaxis had a clinically modest, albeit sta-
tistically significant impact on GVHD-free survival (MST = 17 days, 
P = 0.003 versus No Rxl Figure 2, A and B). As shown in Figure 2, A 
and C, CD28 blockade with FR104 as monoprophylaxis delayed the 
onset of clinical GVHD compared with that in the No Rx cohort and 
was associated with early control of disease compared with both 
CTLA4-Ig and sirolimus monoprophylaxis. Thus, at 7 days after 
transplant, each of the other monoprophylaxis cohorts displayed 
moderate-to-severe clinical aGVHD, while animals receiving 
FR104 monoprophylaxis were still significantly controlling disease 
(Figure 2C). However, as shown in Figure 2, A, D, and E, GVHD 
did ultimately develop in the FR104 monoprophylaxis cohort. The 
delay in the onset of aGVHD in the FR104 monoprophylaxis cohort 
was associated with a survival advantage compared with both the 
No Rx and CTLA4-Ig cohorts (MST for the FR104 monoprophy-
laxis cohort = 21 days, P = 0.003 versus No Rx, P = 0.013 versus 
CTLA4-Ig, P = 0.95 versus sirolimus; Figure 2B).
Transcriptomic analysis of T cells purified at day 14 from the 
peripheral blood of recipients in the FR104 monoprophylaxis 
cells, respectively, in the peripheral blood when recipients were 
receiving FR104 as well as blockade of T cell CD28 expression in 
the bone marrow, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, spleen, and lymph 
node (LN), with more variable blockade in the liver (Figure 1, D 
and E). However, as expected from the PK analysis, after day 66 
after transplant, we observed desaturation of CD28 occupancy in 
both blood and tissue T cells (Figure 1E).
Monoprophylaxis with FR104 demonstrates clinical activity 
against aGVHD with evidence for improved efficacy compared with 
CTLA4-Ig monoprophylaxis. Figure 2 depicts the clinical and his-
tologic aGVHD outcomes after prophylaxis with FR104 alone as 
well as with combination FR104/sirolimus when compared with 
4 historical cohorts: no prophylaxis (No Rx) (n = 11), sirolimus (n 
= 4), CTLA4-Ig (n = 4), and CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus (n = 7) (51, 52). 
As shown and as we previously reported (12, 53), recipients in the 
No Rx cohort developed severe multiorgan aGVHD concomitant 
with the first signs of lymphocyte engraftment and expansion and 
a short median survival time (MST) of 8 days (Figure 2, A and B). 
Also, as previously described (51, 52), CTLA4-Ig monoprophylaxis 
did not significantly prolong GVHD-free survival compared with 
Figure 2. Clinical aGVHD scoring and aGVHD-free survival. (A and B) Longitudinal clinical aGVHD scoring (A) and GVHD-free survival curves (B) of

(n = 7; purple) cohorts. Scoring was based on our previously described NHP aGVHD clinical scoring system (12). GI aGVHD scores from FR104/sirolimus 
recipients with documented enteric infections were censored. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. For GVHD-free survival analysis, FR104/sirolimus recipients 
with documented graft rejection were excluded from this analysis. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate survival. (C) Clinical

cohorts. These included gene sets indicating relative preservation 
of naive T cells in the FR104 versus No Rx comparison (Figure 3A) 
and underrepresentation of gene sets associated with cell prolif-
eration, T cell antigen–dependent activation, and effector differ-
entiation in the FR104 cohort (Figure 3B). In contrast, when com-
pared with HCs, the day 14 FR104 monoprophylaxis T cells were 
clearly not quiescent and demonstrated relative enrichment for 
these same gene sets (Figure 3C). Thus, while relatively controlled 
compared with fulminant hyperacute GVHD, immune escape 
during FR104 monoprophylaxis was nonetheless occurring.
The monoprophylaxis cohorts also permitted a direct compar-
ison of the transcriptome of T cells in the setting of CD28 block-
ade versus blockade of CD80/86, and as documented in Figure 3, 
D–F, and Supplemental Table 2, there were numerous gene sets 
cohort (Figure 3 and Supplemental Tables 1 and 2; supplemental 
material available online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/
JCI98793DS1) provided insights into the immune pathways 
responsible for the bioactivity of FR104 in delaying GVHD as well 
as the ultimate immune escape that occurred despite anti-CD28 
monoprophylaxis. Differential expression analysis highlighted the 
ultimate similarities in the severity of GVHD in both the FR104 
and No Rx cohorts in that there were no differentially expressed 
(DE) genes between these 2 cohorts using a differential expression 
threshold of 1.4-fold and a P value of less than 0.05, corrected for 
multiple testing (Supplemental Table 1). However, despite the lack 
of individual transcript differences, gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) (54), revealed relative over- and underrepresentation of 
multiple gene sets in the FR104 monoprophylaxis versus No Rx

detail below, 3 other recipients in this cohort did not reach the 
planned endpoint: R.222 died at day 21 of a hemorrhagic stroke 
prior to platelet engraftment (platelet count 14 at terminal anal-
ysis); R.213 died at day 66 unexpectedly after anesthesia, in the 
setting of intercurrent giardia infection; R.250 died at day 72 of 
culture-negative sepsis. None of these animals had signs of clini-
cal GVHD at the time of their deaths.
As shown in Figure 2B, despite the early deaths, the clinical 
protection from aGVHD resulted in prolongation of GVHD-free 
survival in the FR104/sirolimus cohort compared with multi-
ple other cohorts, including the No Rx, sirolimus, and CTLA4-
Ig monoprophylaxis cohorts as well as the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus 
cohort (51): P < 0.0001 vs. No Rx (MST = 8 days); P = 0.0001 vs. 
CTLA4-Ig (MST = 10 days); P = 0.0005 vs. sirolimus (MST = 17 
days); P < 0.0014 vs. FR104 (MST = 21 days); and P = 0.004 vs. 
CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus (MST = 34 days). As shown in Figure 2, D 
and E, histopathologic GVHD scores for animals in the FR104/
sirolimus cohort were divided into 2 groups: (a) those necropsied 
during ongoing FR104 exposure (defined as animals necropsied 
prior to day 66 after transplant, with this cutoff based on the PK 
analysis depicted in Figure 1B) and (b) those that were necropsied 
after FR104 washout (Figure 2, D and E). The histopathologic 
GVHD scores of animals necropsied during ongoing FR104 expo-
sure aligned with clinical aGVHD scores, with significantly less 
GVHD-associated pathology in comparison with the No Rx cohort 
(2.2 ± 0.5 vs. 6.9 ± 0.6; P = 0.003), which was similar to what was 
found in autologous transplant controls. Of note, while animals 
necropsied after FR104 washout did not show significant clinical 
signs of GVHD at terminal analysis (Figure 2D), histopathologic 
analysis did indicate subclinical pathology in these animals in the 
skin, liver, and colon (Figure 2E and Supplemental Table 3), with 
a total pathologic score of 4.2 ± 0.8 (P = 0.94 compared with No 
that were significantly different in T cells purified from these 
recipients. Importantly, this analysis uncovered evidence for the 
absence of CTLA4 signaling in the CTLA4-Ig cohort compared 
with the FR104 cohort (Figure 3D). In addition, GSEA identified 
significant enrichment for resting/naive T cell gene signatures in 
the FR104 cohort compared with the CTLA4-Ig cohort (Figure 
3E). In contrast, T cells isolated from recipients in the CTLA4-Ig 
monoprophylaxis cohort demonstrated enrichment for gene sets 
involved in (a) cell cycle/proliferation, (b) effector T cells, (c) anti-
gen response, and (d) cytotoxicity (Figure 3F).
Long-term control of GVHD with FR104/sirolimus combination 
prophylaxis. While both sirolimus and FR104 as monoprophylaxis 
only modestly delayed the onset and lethality of aGVHD (Figure 
2, A–D), the combination of these agents synergistically con-
trolled disease. Two FR104/sirolimus cohorts were examined. 
In cohort 1 (short-term, recipients R.26, R.27, R.28, and R.29; 
Table 1), animals underwent a planned terminal analysis at days 
33–35 after transplant, with 3 of 4 recipients reaching the prede-
termined experimental endpoint. The single recipient that did 
not reach the experimental endpoint (R.29) developed an injec-
tion site infection with Enterococcus faecalis requiring euthanasia 
on day 22, at which time he had no signs of skin or liver aGVHD 
and had mild diarrhea consistent with possible clinical stage I GI 
aGVHD. In cohort 2 (long-term, recipients R.213, R.222, R.249, 
R.250, R.251), animals underwent extended observation in the 
setting of discontinuation of FR104 at day 54 after transplant 
(with continued sirolimus dosing) and a planned terminal anal-
ysis at day 100 or later after transplant. In this extended cohort, 
only 2 of 5 recipients reached the predetermined experimental 
endpoint. These 2 animals, R.249 and R.251, underwent termi-
nal analysis on days 105 and 100, respectively, with no clinical 
signs of GVHD at the time of necropsy. As will be discussed in

Rx). This is an important observation, as it suggests that break-
through GVHD remained a risk in FR104/sirolimus recipients. 
While it is not clear whether the immune pathology noted would 
have eventually resulted in a clinically significant syndrome, this 
result suggests that longer-term dosing of FR104 may be required 
for optimal GVHD control.
Flow cytometric and transcriptomic evidence for synergistic 
control of T cell effector maturation with FR104/sirolimus. The 
prevention of clinical aGVHD during ongoing FR104 exposure 
in the FR104/sirolimus cohort correlated closely with control 
of T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and effector function. Thus, 
as we have previously described (12, 53), and in agreement with 
the transcriptomic data discussed above, the No Rx, sirolimus, 
and CTLA4-Ig cohorts developed increasing expression of Ki-67 
(Ki67hi) that denotes proliferation and overexpression of gran-
zyme B (GZMBveryhi) after transplant (Figure 4A). In contrast, 
FR104 monoprophylaxis partially controlled Ki67 expression 
(but not GZMB overexpression; Figure 4A), while combination 
prophylaxis with FR104/sirolimus resulted in synergistic control 
of both proliferation and granzyme B overexpression in the blood 
and tissues (Figure 4, A and B). This control of proliferation result-
ed in restraint of effector maturation and improved maintenance 
of the naive T cell phenotype in the FR104/sirolimus cohort, 
most prominently in CD4+ T cells (Figure 4C), which persisted 
in the FR104/sirolimus cohort for the length of FR104 exposure. 
However, when FR104 was discontinued, and concomitant with 
desaturation of CD28 occupancy on donor T cells (Figure 1, C and 
E), loss of naive CD4+ T cells did occur (Figure 4, C and D). This 
loss of naive cells occurred earlier for CD8+ T cells and did not 
correlate with FR104 exposure (Figure 4, C and D).
The impact of FR104/sirolimus on T cell proliferation and 
effector maturation was also observed transcriptomically. Thus, 
GSEA performed on T cells purified on day 14 after transplant (or 
at the time of necropsy if this occurred prior to day 14) confirmed 
underrepresentation of gene sets involved in the control of cell 
proliferation and in the control of antigen response and overrepre-
sentation of gene sets associated with the naive T cell phenotype 
in the FR104/sirolimus cohort compared with both the FR104 
and sirolimus cohorts (Figure 4E). The complete list of gene sets 
over- and underrepresented in the day 14 FR104/sirolimus cohort 
is shown in Supplemental Table 2.
Previous reports have suggested that the control of T cell sig-
naling through CD28 blockade may be mediated by coinhibitory 
2B4 signaling (44). However, and consistent with the lack of effec-
tor maturation in the FR104-prophylaxed cohorts (55) (Figure 4, 
A–E), we did not observe increased expression of individual coin-
hibitory receptors (including PD-1, LAG3, 2B4, CTLA4 and TIM-3; 
 
Figure 4F) in the FR104/sirolimus cohort and, indeed, observed 
decreased expression of these molecules in the FR104/sirolimus 
versus No Rx cohorts.
Transcriptional consequences of FR104/sirolimus versus CTLA4-
Ig/sirolimus for GVHD prophylaxis. T cell transcriptome analysis 
allowed us to further interrogate the mechanisms underlying the 
control of GVHD with FR104/sirolimus and the relative impact of 
FR104/sirolimus on T cell signaling compared with CTLA4-Ig/
sirolimus. We first probed our data set for pathways that defined 
the synergistic impact of combining CD28 blockade with mTOR 
inhibition. To do this, we quantified the number of genes DE in 
the FR104, sirolimus, and FR104/sirolimus transcriptomes com-
pared with those expressed in the No Rx transcriptome (Figure 
5A). Gene arrays for this analysis were performed on T cells puri-
fied from recipients at day 14 after transplant (or at the time of 
necropsy, if this occurred prior to day 14). To avoid potential con-
founding associated with the secondary graft failure/loss of donor 
chimerism that occurred in 2 animals in the FR104/sirolimus 
cohort (recipients R.250 and R.251; Table 1 and discussed in detail 
below), we excluded the transcriptomes from these recipients 
from this analysis. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, T cells purified 
from the FR104/sirolimus cohort demonstrated a distinct gene 
expression landscape in comparison with the No Rx, sirolimus, 
and FR104 cohorts. Thus, as shown in this figure and Supplemen-
tal Tables 1 and 4, using an absolute fold change cutoff of greater 
than 1.4, there were no DE genes in the FR104 monoprophylaxis 
versus No Rx comparison and only 32 DE genes in the sirolimus 
monoprophylaxis versus No Rx comparison. In striking contradis-
tinction, there were 2,162 DE genes in the FR104/sirolimus versus 
No Rx comparison. Importantly, of these 2,162 transcripts, 2,139 
(99%) were uniquely affected by combination prophylaxis, sug-
gesting deep synergy between the 2 agents. Next, we performed 
a similar DE gene analysis comparing the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus, 
sirolimus, and CTLA4-Ig transcriptomes to No Rx (as before, gene 
arrays were performed on day 14 or at the time of necropsy if it 
occurred earlier than day 14). As shown in Figure 5A, again using 
an absolute fold change cutoff of greater than 1.4, there were no

and Supplemental Table 5). The other overrepresented pathways 
involved cytokine signaling (cytokine-cytokine receptor inter-
action and FoxO-signaling pathway). In contrast with the high-
ly focused upregulation of TGF-β signaling, we identified many 
more pathways uniquely downregulated in the FR104/sirolimus 
versus No Rx comparison. As shown in Figure 5C, these pathways 
belonged to the following major functional categories: (a) cell cycle 
(36.4% of pathways); (b) DNA repair (23.6%); (c) gene expression 
(transcription) (9.1%); (d) replication and repair (5.5%); (e) signal 
transduction (signaling by Rho GTPase; 5.5%); (f) immune system 
(3.6%); and (g) cell growth, senescence, and death (5.4%).
This analysis also permitted us to determine which pathways 
were affected by both FR104/sirolimus and CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus 
prophylaxis regimens compared with No Rx in or der to deter-
mine the mechanisms potentially shared by these 2 GVHD-pre-
vention strategies (Figure 5, B and C). This analysis revealed no 
upregulated and 6 downregulated pathways that were shared by 
both FR104/sirolimus and CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus versus No Rx. The 
shared downregulated pathways were predominated by those con-
trolling the cell cycle (4 of 6 pathways; Figure 5C and Supplemen-
tal Table 5), underscoring the shared impact of both regimens on 
T cell proliferation and expansion.
While both CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus and FR104/sirolimus down-
regulated cell-cycle–related transcripts compared with No Rx 
(Figure 5, A–C), GSEA comparing these 2 cohorts identified better 
control of cell-cycle and immune system activation with FR104/
sirolimus compared with CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus (Figure 5D and 
Supplemental Table 2), with concomitant enrichment in naive T 
cells in the FR104/sirolimus versus CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus compar-
ison (Figure 5D and Supplemental Table 2). These transcription-
al results provide important mechanistic associations with the 
improved control of GVHD documented with FR104/sirolimus 
versus CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus (Figure 2).
To most rigorously define the transcriptional hallmarks of 
FR104/sirolimus versus CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus, we applied unsu-
pervised weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) 
(57, 58) to construct a gene coexpression network from our data 
set, using the transcriptomes from the FR104/sirolimus (n = 6) 
DE genes in the CTLA4-Ig monoprophylaxis versus No Rx com-
parison and the same 32 DE genes in the sirolimus monoprophy-
laxis versus No Rx comparison. There were far fewer DE genes in 
the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus versus No Rx comparison compared with 
the FR104/sirolimus versus No Rx comparison: 51 DE genes in 
the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus versus No Rx comparison, with 45 genes 
(88%) being uniquely affected by combination CTLA4-Ig/sirolim-
us prophylaxis versus No Rx (Figure 5A).
To develop a deeper understanding of the pathways uniquely 
modified by sirolimus combined with either CD28 or CD80/86 
blockade, we determined the unique transcripts that were DE in 
the FR104/sirolimus versus No Rx comparison compared with 
the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus versus No Rx comparison. We identified 
2,098 genes that were uniquely DE in the FR104/sirolimus cohort 
(but not in the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus cohort) when compared with 
No Rx (659 transcripts were overrepresented and 1,439 were 
underrepresented; Figure 5B). There were many fewer transcripts 
uniquely DE in the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus compared with No Rx (4 
total transcripts, with 2 overrepresented and 2 underrepresent-
ed in the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus versus No Rx comparison; Figure 
5B, Supplemental Table 4), with no pathways identified among 
these 4 transcripts. While the vast majority of DE transcripts com-
pared with No Rx were unique between the FR104/sirolimus and 
CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus comparisons, we did identify 41 transcripts 
(18 overrepresented and 23 underrepresented) that were DE in 
both FR104/sirolimus and CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus cohorts (Figure 
5B, discussed below).
Pathway analysis using DAVID (56) allowed functional annota-
tion of the cellular processes represented by these DE genes, which 
are depicted in Figure 5C and enumerated in Supplemental Table 
5. With respect to pathways uniquely perturbed in the FR104/
sirolimus cohort, we identified 5 overrepresented pathways and 
55 underrepresented pathways. Of note, of the 5 overrepresented 
pathways uniquely identified in the FR104/sirolimus versus No Rx 
comparison, 2 (TGF-β signaling pathway and signaling by BMP) 
belonged to TGF-β/Smad-related signaling with an additional 
pathway (signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells) 
that also contained many mediators of TGF-β signaling (Figure 5C

shown in Supplemental Table 6. (B) Eigengene adjacency heatmap showing module eigengene similarity to each of the NHP clinical cohorts.

tal Table 6). The module eigengenes (59) were then clustered with 
the 4 experimental cohorts (No Rx, HC, CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus, and 
FR104/sirolimus) in order to identify metamodules (Figure 6B). 
This analysis determined that the No Rx and CTLA4-Ig/sirolim-
us cohorts were strongly clustered in a metamodule with the blue 
eigengene (Figure 6B) and that this blue eigengene demonstrated 
no correlation with either the FR104/sirolimus or the HC cohorts 
(Figure 6B), suggesting that it could reveal genes and pathways 
and CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus (n = 6) cohorts (microarray data collect-
ed at day 28) in comparison with the No Rx cohort (microarray 
data collected at terminal analysis, which occurred prior to day 28 
for all No Rx animals; n = 11) and with HCs (n = 62). After applying 
WGCNA, we then performed hierarchical clustering of the matrix, 
thereby identifying sets of genes that met a predetermined thresh-
old of coexpression, which resulted in the identification of 9 dis-
crete self-assembling modules (Figure 6, A and B, and Supplemen-

and Figure 8), and the pathways encapsulated by the blue module 
are enumerated in Supplemental Table 7. The resulting pathway 
analysis using DAVID (interrogating the Reactome, KEGG, and 
Biocarta databases) revealed that the blue module was enriched 
in multiple pathways of T cell activation and proliferation (Figure 
7, A and B). These prominently included pathways associated with 
cell cycle and DNA repair, but also included pathways associated 
with the regulation of gene transcription, cellular senescence, sig-
that linked the breakthrough aGVHD that occurred with CTLA4-
Ig/sirolimus with the severe GVHD observed in the No Rx cohort. 
In contrast, the brown eigengene clustered with the FR104/siroli-
mus cohort and with HCs, but not with the No Rx and CTLA4-Ig/
sirolimus cohorts (Figure 6B), suggesting that it may reveal genes 
associated with the T cell quiescence induced by FR104/sirolim-
us. The transcripts and gene correlations identified in the blue and 
brown eigengenes were visualized using Cytoscape (60) (Figure 7A

ed noticeable evidence for the 
impact of FR104/sirolimus on T 
cell proliferation and activation, 
it is notable that we did not iden-
tify pathways associated with 
Tregs in this analysis. This may be 
due to the fact that CD4+FoxP3+ 
Tregs express CD28 (confirmed 
in this study; see Supplemental 
Figure 2A) and that they rely on 
CD28 signaling for their surviv-
al and suppressive function (61). 
We have previously shown that 
the development of aGVHD in 
NHP is associated with a signif-
icant decrease in the Treg/Tcon 
ratio (Figure 9A, Supplemental 
Figure 2B, and ref. 62), and in the 
current study, we observed that, 
consistent with the development 
of GVHD in the FR104 monopro-
phylaxis cohort, these recipients 
were unable to maintain either 
their pretransplant numbers of 
Tregs or the pretransplant Treg/
Tconv ratio. Furthermore, the 
decay in these parameters coin-
cided with the development of 
clinically significant GVHD (Fig-
ure 9A). Importantly, while com-
bination prophylaxis with FR104/
sirolimus initially preserved abso-
lute Treg numbers as well as the 
Treg/Tconv ratio, this effect was 
not durable for the length of the 
experiment, with peripheral blood 
Treg counts dropping by approx-
imately day 25 after transplant 
(Figure 9A) and with a decrease 
in the proportion of Tregs compared with the pretransplant level 
also observed in the LNs and spleens of FR104/sirolimus recip-
ients (Figure 9B). The inhibitory effect on Tregs may have been 
due to FR104. Thus, in 2 of 3 recipients in the FR104/sirolimus 
cohort that survived for more than 66 days after transplant, we 
observed a rebound of the Treg/Tconv ratio after discontinua-
tion of FR104, concomitant with the desaturation of T cell CD28 
occupancy (Figure 9C), as well as a modest increase in the abso-
lute number of Tregs after discontinuation of FR104 (Figure 9A). 
Importantly, we did not observe any negative impact of FR104 
on the in vitro suppressive capacity of Tregs, as measured by the 
sustained ability of Tregs that were pretreated with FR104 to 
suppress Tconv alloproliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction 
(MLR) assay (Supplemental Figure 2, C and D).
Transplant-related mortality in the FR104/sirolimus cohort. As 
noted above, while combination prophylaxis with FR104/sirolim-
us was successful in preventing clinical GVHD, the regimen was 
not uniformly successful in supporting posttransplant survival, 
nal transduction, cell growth and death, hemostasis, cancer, and 
immune system/immune-mediated diseases (See Supplemental 
Table 7 for a list of all 55 pathways enriched in this module). The 
results of this highly rigorous, unsupervised analysis closely mir-
rored the results shown in Figure 5D, where these pathways were 
uniquely underrepresented in a comparison of the FR104/siroli-
mus cohort versus No Rx, providing independent confirmation of 
the relatively stronger impact that FR104/sirolimus had on path-
ways of T cell proliferation, activation, and functional maturation 
compared with CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus. The brown module (which 
was less strongly associated with FR104/sirolimus than the blue 
module was associated with CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus; Figure 6B) con-
sisted of fewer transcripts than the blue module (318 versus 595) 
and did not include any annotated enriched pathways when ana-
lyzed with DAVID. The complete list of genes in the brown module 
is shown in Supplemental Table 6.

In order to interrogate the possible causes of the increased risk 
of sepsis and graft loss in the FR104/sirolimus cohort, 2 experi-
ments were performed. In the first, we determined whether other 
immune cells also expressed CD28 in NHP and thus could have 
been affected by FR104 blockade. While each of 4 distinct anti-
CD28 clones labeled T cells, none of the antibodies bound to the 
surface of B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, or granulo-
cytes (Supplemental Figure 3A). Intracellular labeling techniques 
demonstrated similar results, with only 1 of 4 clones (15E8) label-
ing non–T cell leukocytes at low levels after permeabilization. This 
labeling was likely nonspecific to CD28, however, given that it 
was only minimally affected by preincubation with FR104 (Sup-
plemental Figure 3, A–C). In addition to the expression analyses 
described above, functional assays were also performed, which 
demonstrated that short-term preincubation with FR104 did not 
affect phagocytosis or the respiratory burst of granulocytes (Sup-
plemental Figure 3, D and E). Together, these experiments suggest 
that the impact of FR104 on protective immunity was unlikely to 
be due to the expression of CD28 on non–T cells.
The second experiment was designed to determine other 
possible mechanisms of the increased risk of sepsis in transplant 
We observed the following posttransplant complications in both 
the short-term and long-term FR104/sirolimus cohorts (Table 1): 
(a) 1 episode of hemorrhagic stroke associated with thrombocyto-
penia (R.222) and (b) 2 episodes of infection-related death (R.29 
and R.250). R.29 developed an injection-site infection that led to 
necropsy on day 22, and R.250 died of culture-negative sepsis on 
day 71 in the setting of a high WBC count (18.0 × 106/ml), absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) (17.3 × 106/ml), C-reactive protein (CRP) 
count (44.5 mg/l). In addition to these deaths, 1 additional animal 
(R.213) died unexpectedly during sedation. At the time of death, 
R.213 had a confirmed GI infection with Giardia.
In addition to the infection-related morbidity and mortality, 2 
animals in the 9-animal FR104/sirolimus cohort had signs of loss 
of engraftment (Figure 10, A and B). Thus, R.250 demonstrated 
a loss of myeloid chimerism (Figure 10A) and R.251 demonstrat-
ed secondary graft failure (Figure 10, A and B). This resulted in a 
dichotomous impact on survival after transplant in the FR104/siro-
limus cohort. While GVHD-free survival was improved compared 
with that in the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus cohort (Figure 2B), combina-
tion FR104/sirolimus prophylaxis did not improve overall survival 
compared with CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus prophylaxis (Figure 10C).

on overall survival when compared with CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus, 
despite improved GVHD-free survival. While the number of recip-
ients analyzed was relatively small (n = 9 total, with 5 followed 
long term), we did observe fatal sepsis in 2 animals, loss of donor 
chimerism in 1 animal, and secondary graft loss in 1 animal. These 
complications occurred in the setting of intact reconstitution of 
CD4 cells compared with autologous transplant controls, but 
slower reconstitution of CD8 cells (Supplemental Figure 1). Death 
from these clinical complications was not observed in any of the 7 
animals that we have previously reported in the CTLA4-Ig/siroli-
mus cohort (51). While sepsis and loss of chimerism are expected 
complications associated with transplant, it is also possible that 
they were directly affected by the impact of combined FR104/
sirolimus on T cell activation. Thus, it is well established that T 
cells function within an allograft to promote donor engraftment 
and protection against infection and that both failure to engraft 
and infectious complications accompany T cell depletion (74–77). 
The significant control of T cell activation with FR104/sirolimus 
may blunt these T cell functions, and indeed, previous results in 
murine models suggested that deficiency of CD28 increased the 
risk of nonengraftment after allo-HCT (39) and that intact CD28 
signaling in T cells was required to mount an effective protective 
immune response against bacterial infections (78–80). Moreover, 
and further supporting the hypothesis that FR104/sirolimus-me-
diated control of T cell activation may have increased the risk of 
infection and sepsis in this cohort, we found that FR104/sirolim-
us recipients were unable to mount an appropriate (66–68) IFN-γ 
response to sepsis (Figure 10D). While the ability to discern a pos-
itive impact on overall survival may have been limited by a lack of 
statistical power with the current sample size, given the combined 
risk of infection and engraftment failure that we encountered in 
the FR104/sirolimus transplants, it was not feasible to add enough 
additional animals to provide a more definitive evaluation of this 
end point. It is important to note, however, that the NHP model 
may have accentuated the risks of both infection-related death 
and graft rejection compared with what would be seen in the clinic. 
Thus, the ability to provide successful prophylaxis and treatment 
of infection is more challenging in NHP than in patients, which 
likely contributes to the increased risk of life-threatening sepsis 
in this animal model. Furthermore, the NHP transplant model 
employed used only total body irradiation (TBI) for pretrans-
plant conditioning; thus, the risk of rejection could be mitigated 
in patients by augmenting the pretransplant regimen with addi-
tional conditioning agents. Given the prominant control of T cell 
activation and GVHD that we observed, and if clinical risks were 
mitigated as described above, translation of this regimen would 
be appropriate and potentially of considerable value to transplant 
patients at high risk of GVHD.
The striking control of T cell activation when FR104 was com-
bined with sirolimus suggests that this combinatorial strategy may 
be an important approach for clinical translation (81). However, 
the complications that were also observed in the FR104/siroli-
mus cohort suggest that effectively deploying CD28 blockade in 
the clinic may be complex. Our results suggest that there may be 
considerable trade-offs associated with the comprehensive down-
modulation of conventional T cell activation that occurred with 
FR104/sirolimus, which may impede functional engraftment if 
recipients exposed to FR104/sirolimus by determining the abil-
ity of these animals to mount an appropriate cytokine response 
during infection (Figure 10D and Supplemental Figure 4A). While 
cytokines classically associated with innate immune responses, 
including IL-1RA, IL-6, and IL-12 (63–65), were appropriately 
elevated in the serum during infection in the FR104/sirolimus 
cohort, it was notable that an infection-associated response by 
IFN-γ, which represents the major T cell cytokine produced during 
sepsis (66–68) (and which was elevated in a transplant recipient 
from a separate costimulatory blockade protocol who also devel-
oped sepsis after allogeneic HCT; Supplemental Figure 4B), did 
not occur. This result is consistent with the transcriptomic analysis 
shown in Supplemental Figure 4C, which documented substantial 
control of IFN-γ production/lack of IFN-γ signaling in the FR104/
sirolimus cohort compared with the CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus cohort 
and suggests that inhibition of an appropriate IFN-γ response may 
have increased the risk of infection in the FR104/sirolimus cohort.
Discussion
Here, we provide evidence for broad synergy between CD28 
blockade and mTOR inhibition in preventing GVHD and, using a 
systems biology approach, have determined the molecular mecha-
nisms associated with disease control. Importantly, this study has 
also allowed us to measure the comparative impact of targeting 
CD28 versus CD80/86 in controlling T cell activation and pre-
venting GVHD, both in single-agent experiments and in combina-
tion with mTOR inhibition.
One of the most striking findings in the current study was the 
depth of synergy between mTOR inhibition and CD28 blockade in 
controlling aGVHD. The impact was impressive, with 2,098 genes 
identified that were exclusively normalized in the FR104/siroli-
mus cohort compared with the No Rx cohort. The other critical 
result of this study was the evidence for more complete control of 
T cell activation, proliferation, and effector maturation with CD28 
blockade versus CD80/86 blockade. Two other key observations 
made in this study deserve special discussion, each of which has 
important clinical relevance. The first is the impact that CD28 
blockade had on Treg reconstitution and homeostasis in the NHP 
GVHD model. Given the contribution that CTLA4 signaling makes 
to Treg function, it has long been thought that targeting CD80/86 
(and thus potentially blocking signaling from both CD28 and 
CTLA4) would not be ideal in terms of Treg homeostasis. Howev-
er, with regard to the impact that CD28 (and its blockade) has on 
Treg development, function, and homeostasis, the literature sup-
ports complex mechanistic relationships, with evidence for both 
salutary and inhibitory effects of CD28 deficiency on Tregs (61, 
69–73). In the experiments presented here, we provide evidence 
for the inhibition of Treg homeostasis in the FR104/sirolimus 
cohort. These results strengthen the inference that control of allo-
reactivity in the FR104/sirolimus cohort occurred predominantly 
through the inhibition of conventional T cell activation rather than 
the promotion of Treg predominance.
The second critical observation concerns possible drawbacks 
associated with the substantial control of conventional T cell acti-
vation and functional maturation that occurred in the FR104/siro-
limus cohort. Thus, we observed a number of transplant-related 
toxicities in this cohort that resulted in a lack of a beneficial impact

used in the early peritransplant period. Nonetheless, the potency 
of the control of T cell activation with FR104/sirolimus suggests 
that it may be of use in settings characterized by refractory T 
cell pathophysiology, for example, in treating refractory acute or 
chronic GVHD. Although the current NHP model does not speak 
directly to either of these clinical entities, the transcriptomic evi-
dence for potent downmodulation of effector T cell activation 
when CD28 blockade was combined with mTOR inhibition sug-
gests that this combination may have efficacy in these hard-to-
treat scenarios. Given the unique balance of risks and benefits that 
may be inherent to anti-CD28–based regimens, careful clinical 
investigation, with robust immunologic analysis linked to clinical 
outcomes, is warranted.
Methods
Experimental animals and transplant protocol. Transplants were per-
formed as previously described (12, 53), with details of conditioning 
regimens, immunomodulation regimens, and stem cell infusions 
described in Figure 1A, Table 1, and Supplemental Methods.
Flow cytometric and immunofluorescence analysis. For phenotypic 
analysis and T cell sorting, multicolor flow cytometry was performed on 
all transplant recipients, as previously described (12). A complete descrip-
tion of flow cytometry methods is found in Supplemental Methods.
Microarray and data analysis. CD3+CD20– lymphocytes were puri-
fied flow cytometrically using a FACS Jazz Cell Sorter (BD Bioscienc-
es). Following T cell purification, RNA was stabilized in T cell lysates 
with RLT buffer (QIAGEN) and RNA was purified using the RNeasy 
Column Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop Spec-
trophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purity confirmed with 
an RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent). The purified RNA was sent to either 
the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics Core (Nash-
ville, Tennessee, USA) or to the Oregon Health Sciences University 
Gene Profiling Shared Resource (Portland, Oregon, USA), where RNA 
quantity and quality were verified. This was followed by cDNA/cRNA 
synthesis and target hybridization to the GeneChip Rhesus Macaque 
Genome Array (Affymetrix). The resultant fluorescent signals were 
processed and normalized using the robust multichip averaging (RMA) 
method (82). The microarray was performed in 7 batches, with batches 
containing samples from both HCs and transplanted recipients. Details 
of microarray statistical analysis and full details of the computational 
analysis of the transcriptome are found in the Supplemental Methods. 
The NHP microarray data discussed in this publication were deposited 
in the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO GSE116070).
Statistics. Survival statistics were calculated using Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. Other variables were expressed as mean ± SEM, and P val-
ues less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical 
analysis was performed using Prism version 6 for Mac OS X (Graph-
