Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the most ancient human pathogens, yet the exact mechanism(s) of host 
defense against Mtb remains unclear. Although one-third of the world’s population is chronically infected with 
Mtb, only 5 to 10% develop active disease. This indicates that, in addition to resistance mechanisms that control 
bacterial burden, the host has also evolved strategies to tolerate the presence of Mtb to limit disease severity. We 
identify mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) as a critical checkpoint of T cell metabolism that controls the expansion 
of activated T cells. Although loss of CypD function in T cells led to enhanced Mtb antigen–specific T cell responses, 
this increased T cell response had no impact on bacterial burden. Rather, mice containing CypD-deficient T cells 
exhibited substantially compromised disease tolerance and succumbed to Mtb infection. This study establishes a 
mechanistic link between T cell–mediated immunity and disease tolerance during Mtb infection.
INTRODUCTION
Despite over a century since the discovery of Mycobacterium tuber-
culosis (Mtb), our understanding of protective immunity to Mtb re-
mains elusive. Considering the ubiquitous infection of humans, the 
low conversion rate of chronic Mtb infection to active tuberculosis (TB) 
(1) indicates that Mtb has coevolved with humans to achieve an evo-
lutionary trade-off, which is infrequently compromising host fitness 
for survival. Conventionally, this trade-off has been considered to be 
dependent almost exclusively on host resistance to control Mtb growth. 
However, disease tolerance is another host defense strategy that pro-
vides protection against infection by tolerating the presence of the 
pathogen and controlling tissue damage without affecting pathogen 
burden (2–4). Although the concept of disease tolerance is well es-
tablished in plants (5), only recently has its contribution to Drosophila 
(6–8) and mammalian (9–11) host defense been appreciated. The rel-
evance of this host defense mode during TB has not been carefully 
examined.
T lymphocytes are essential to control primary Mtb infection, be-
cause T cell–deficient animal models and lymphopenic HIV patients 
are extremely susceptible to Mtb infection (12). Although it is clear 
that T cell–mediated immunity is critical for preventing Mtb dis-
semination, whether enhancing the T cell response to Mtb improves 
protection against TB is less clear. Accumulating evidence suggests 
that dysregulated T cell responses during Mtb infection may actually 
increase bacterial burden and susceptibility. For instance, programmed 
cell death protein-1 (PD-1)–deficient mice were found to be extreme-
ly susceptible to Mtb infection despite markedly enhanced T cell 
responses. This increased susceptibility was associated with increased 
pulmonary bacterial growth (13, 14). Thus, a tightly controlled T cell 
response is fundamental for host survival to TB.
Specific cell surface receptors expressed on antigen-experienced 
T cells play a major role in regulation of T cell responses. Binding of 
the inhibitory receptor PD-1 to its ligands (PD-L1 or PD-L2) prevents 
T cell proliferation and function, whereas increased expression of the 
killer cell-lectin–like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) enhances 
T cell differentiation (15). Although the surface expression of these 
markers on T cells appears to be critical for dictating their functional 
role during Mtb infection (13, 14, 16, 17), our understanding of in-
trinsic immunoregulatory mechanisms of T cells is limited.
One of the central programs initiated upon T cell activation is re-
programming of cellular metabolism to fuel T cell proliferation, dif-
ferentiation, and cytokine production. Upon T cell receptor (TCR) 
activation, T cells increase their rate of nutrient uptake and initiate 
a shift in their metabolic program to aerobic glycolysis (18). High rates 
of glycolysis enable T cells to rapidly produce adenosine 5′-triphosphate 
(ATP) and biosynthetic precursors essential for cell growth and prolif-
eration. This switch from predominantly oxidative phosphorylation 
(OXPHOS) (in the resting state) to aerobic glycolysis (in the proliferative 
state), despite the presence of abundant oxygen, is known as the “Warburg 
effect.” It has been recently shown that the Warburg effect occurs in the 
lungs of mice with TB and that it is necessary for the bioenergetic 
demands of host immunity to Mtb infection (19).
Mitochondria are central platforms for cellular bioenergetics and 
biosynthesis, rapidly switching from catabolic to anabolic states to 
provide the biosynthetic intermediates is pivotal for cellular function 
(20). In addition, mitochondrial metabolism influenced by the energy 
sensor adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
can buffer T cells from energetic stress and influences T cell responses 
to both viral and bacterial infections (21). However, the molecular 
mechanisms that regulate T cell metabolic demands during Mtb in-
fection are poorly understood.
Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a mitochondrial matrix protein of the 
cyclophilin protein family (22) encoded by the Peptidyl-prolyl isom-
erase F (Ppif) gene, shown to play a key role in necrosis by regulat-
ing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), which 
allows the passage of solutes and water from the cytoplasm into the 
mitochondria (23, 24). Because necrosis in macrophages is an exit 
mechanism for Mtb (25–27), Gan et al. (28) initially demonstrated 
that the pharmacological inhibition of CypD in human macrophages

leads to the inhibition of necrosis and reduction of Mtb growth in 
vitro. Genetic blockade of CypD in the zebrafish model of TB pre-
vented macrophage necrosis and enhanced their antimycobacterial 
capacity (29). Thus, from fish to human, CypD appears to play a critical 
role in antimycobacterial immunity of macrophages.
On the basis of the role of CypD in macrophage immunity to Mtb 
infection, here, we examined the function of CypD in host responses 
to Mtb infection. We found that Ppif−/− (CypD-deficient) mice were 
highly susceptible to Mtb infection compared with control animals, 
despite similar numbers of bacteria between groups. We established 
that susceptibility of Ppif−/− mice to Mtb infection was related to 
enhanced T cell responses that promoted lung immunopathology, inde-
pendent of bacterial burden. Using loss- and gain-of-function experi-
mental approaches, we have demonstrated that CypD intrinsically 
regulates T cell metabolism and critically controls disease tolerance 
in TB. These data indicate that, although host resistance is essential 
to Mtb infection, effector T cell responses must be tightly regulated 
to maintain disease tolerance and host survival.
RESULTS
CypD-deficient mice are highly susceptible to Mtb infection
Virulent Mtb inhibits apoptosis and triggers necrosis in macro-
phages to evade macrophage antibacterial responses (30), subvert 
adaptive immunity (31), and facilitate dissemination. Previous 
studies have shown that inhibition of CypD notably decreased ne-
crosis in Mtb- 
infected macro 
phages and also prevented the growth 
of bacteria (26, 28, 29, 32). In line with these findings, we also found 
that after Mtb infection, CypD- 
deficient macrophages were signifi-
cantly resistant to necrosis (fig. S1).
On the basis of these in vitro observations, we next investigated the 
potential contribution of CypD in vivo. We initially assessed bacterial 
burden and survival rate after intravascular (IV) infection in both 
Ppif−/− and wild-type (WT) mice with a high dose [~106 colony-forming 
units (CFU)] of virulent Mtb (H37Rv). Surprisingly, although there 
was no difference in the bacterial burden in the lungs, spleens, and 
livers at days 7, 14, and 21 after Mtb infection (Fig. 1A), Ppif−/− mice were 
highly susceptible to Mtb infection, and all succumbed to death within 
100 days (Fig. 1B). We next assessed the kinetics of pulmonary bacte-
rial burden after infection of WT and Ppif−/− mice with a low dose 
(~50 CFU) of aerosolized virulent Mtb. Similar to IV infection, there 
was no difference in the lung bacterial burden of Mtb-infected WT 
and Ppif−/− mice (Fig. 1C), whereas the survival of Ppif−/− mice was 
significantly reduced after pulmonary Mtb infection (Fig. 1D). However, 
lung gross and histology examinations revealed profound nodular 
lesions (Fig. 1E), and the affected alveolar spaces were significantly 
filled by increased lymphocytic inflammation (Fig. 1F) in the lungs 
of Mtb- 
infected Ppif−/− mice. Flow cytometry identified that most of 
the pulmonary lymphocytic infiltration was CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ 
T cells (Fig. 1G), and the expression levels of Ppif was also signifi-
cantly up- 
regulated in T cells isolated from Mtb-infected lungs (fig. 
S2A). In line with this increased T cell–derived inflammation in Mtb- 
infected Ppif−/− mice, we observed enhanced immunopathology leading to 
severe damage in the lung architecture and alveolar septa (Fig. 1F, high 
magnification). Moreover, similar to another study (33), our data also 
indicate the impact of sex on CypD function was negligible (fig. S2, B 
to E). Collectively, these data suggest that in the absence of CypD, 
there is an increased pulmonary T cell–mediated immunopathology 
that may lead to enhanced mortality during Mtb infection.
CypD-deficient mice have enhanced T cell responses
Considering that the lungs of Ppif−/− mice showed increased inflamma-
tion, predominantly involving T cell infiltration, compared with control 
animals, we next investigated the quantity and quality of the antigen- 
 
specific T cell responses. At various time points after a low dose (~50 CFU) 
of aerosolized virulent Mtb infection, there was a significant increase 
in the frequency and the total cell number of Mtb antigen–specific 
(TB10.4) CD8+ T cells in the lungs of Ppif−/− mice compared to WT 
mice (Fig. 2, A to C). CypD-deficient CD8+ T cells were highly active, 
producing significantly higher levels of interferon- (IFN-) and tumor 
necrosis factor– (TNF; Fig. 2D and fig. S3A). The assessment of 
T cell–lineage transcription factors indicated that CypD-deficient 
T cells highly express T-bet, which is a critical transcription factor 
for T helper 1 cells (TH1; Fig. 2E and fig. S3B), whereas the levels of 
other transcriptional factors for TH17 [retinoic acid receptor–related 
orphan receptor gamma t (RORt)], regulatory T cell (FOXP3), and 
TH2 [GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3)] cells were not significantly 
changed (fig. S3C). Similar data were also obtained in IV model of 
Mtb infection (Fig. 2, F to H, and fig. S3, D to F).
To determine the protective capacity of CypD-deficient T cells in 
host resistance to Mtb, we adoptively transferred equal numbers of 
purified naïve T cells from WT and Ppif−/− mice into Rag1-deficient 
mice that were then infected with a low dose (50 to 100 CFU) of vir-
ulent Mtb via aerosol route (Fig. 2I). In recipient Rag1−/− mice, we 
found no significant difference in bacterial burden in the lungs, spleens, 
or livers at days 7, 14, and 35 after Mtb infection (Fig. 2J); however, 
there was a significant increase in Mtb antigen–specific CD8+ T cells 
in Rag1−/− mice that received CypD-deficient T cells (Fig. 2K and 
fig. S3G). In addition, in either aerosolized or IV models of Mtb infec-
tion, the frequency of other immune cells, including alveolar macro-
phages, monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells, was not markedly altered 
between Mtb-infected WT and Ppif−/− mice (fig. S4, A to C). These 
results indicate that after Mtb infection, there is an increase in CypD- 
 
deficient T cell proliferation/activation, and the protective capacity 
of CypD-deficient T cells against Mtb is intact.
CypD negatively regulates T cell proliferation
The increased number of T cells observed in Ppif−/− mice could be ex-
plained by two nonmutually exclusive possibilities: (i) enhanced T cell 
proliferation and (ii) reduced T cell death. To determine whether CypD 
affects the ability of naïve T cells to proliferate and expand, we first eval-
uated homeostatic T cell proliferation in vivo. Naïve T cells purified from 
WT or Ppif−/− mice were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinim-
idyl ester (CFSE) and adoptively transferred intravenously into Rag1- 
deficient mice (Fig. 3A). Three days after adoptive transfer, where 
control T cells had just begun to initiate proliferation (less than two 
cell divisions), we observed greater expansion of CypD- 
deficient 
T cells (two to three divisions) in recipient mice (Fig. 3B). We next in-
vestigated whether the differences in T cell proliferation could also 
be observed in vitro. CD8+ T cells purified from WT or Ppif−/− mice 
were labeled with CFSE and stimulated in vitro with different con-
centrations of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, and 
cell proliferation was assessed 3 days later. CypD-deficient T cells dis-
played increased proliferation after TCR engagement compared to 
controls (Fig. 3C). In addition, CD8+ T cells demonstrated elevated 
TNF and IFN- production (Fig. 3D and fig. S5A). Corroborating 
enhanced T cell proliferation, expression of early T cell activation 
markers (CD69 and CD25) was also substantially increased in CypD- 
deficient CD8+ T cells compared with WT CD8+ T cells at both frequency

and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI; Fig. 3, E to F, and fig. S5B). Sim-
ilarly, CypD-deficient CD4+ T cells also showed elevated TNF and 
IFN- production after anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation (fig. S5C).
To further validate the intrinsic role of CypD in T cell proliferation, 
we generated CypD-deficient ovalbumin (OVA) TCR-transgenic 
CD8+ mice (OT-I mice). Purified CD8+ T cells from either WT OT-I 
or CypD-deficient OT-I mice were labeled with CFSE and cocultured 
with WT bone marrow (BM)–derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) loaded 
with OVA protein. Three days after coculture, we observed significantly 
increased proliferation of CypD-deficient OT-I CD8+ T cells specific 
to OVA protein compared to control OT-I CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3G). To 
evaluate the role of CypD in T cell proliferation during Mtb infection, 
we next aerosolized WT and Ppif−/− mice with a low dose of Mtb and 
assessed the proliferative capacity of T cells by using markers for pro-
liferation (Ki67), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl2), or apoptosis marker 
(active caspase 3). At days 14 and 28 after infection, we observed an 
increase in the frequency of Ki67+ CD8+ T cells from Ppif−/− mice 
compared to WT mice (Fig. 3H). Similarly, the MFI of Ki67 was sig-
nificantly increased in Mtb antigen–specific CypD-deficient CD8+ 
T cells, whereas there were no significant changes in Bcl-2 or active 
caspase 3 (Fig. 3I).
To further assess whether the increased frequency of CypD-deficient 
T cells after infection is due to enhanced proliferation or reduced cell 
death, we measured the levels of active caspase 3, 7AAD, and annexin 
V in T cells from the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. At both 14 and 28 days 
after Mtb infection, no significant change was observed in active 
caspase 3, annexin V, or 7AAD expression in CD8+ T cells between 
genotypes (Fig. 3, J to K, and fig. S5D). In addition, the levels of 7ADD 
and annexin V was also similar in both WT and CypD-deficient CD4+ 
T cells (fig. S5E). Furthermore, after in vitro stimulation (anti-CD3/
CD28) of WT or CypD-deficient T cells for 48 hours, there was no 
impact on cell viability (fig. S5F). Taking into consideration the role 
of PD-1 in limiting activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as its 
essential role in protection against Mtb (13, 14, 16), we next assessed 
the expression of PD-1 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after Mtb 
infection. At both days 14 and 28 after pulmonary Mtb infection, we 
found no difference in the expression of PD-1 on CD4+ or CD8+ 
T cells isolated from the lungs of Ppif−/− mice compared to WT mice 
(fig. S5G). Collectively, these data indicate that CypD intrinsically 
regulates T cell proliferation independent of the cell death program.
Increased metabolic activity drives the enhanced 
proliferation and cytokine production of CypD- 
deficient T cells
T cell expansion and effector function (i.e., cytokine production) are 
tightly coupled to glycolytic and mitochondrial activity during in-
fections (21, 34). Considering the location of CypD in the mitochon-
dria and many cell survival pathways being linked to global cellular 
metabolism (35), we hypothesized that CypD may influence T cell 
proliferation and effector function via control of T cell metabolic 
activity. To test this, we performed bioenergetic flux analysis of in 
vitro–generated WT and CypD-deficient T effector cells using a Seahorse 
Bioanalyzer. CypD-deficient T cells displayed increased aerobic gly-
colysis compared to control T cells, as evidenced by elevated extra-
cellular acidification rate (ECAR) and lactate production (Fig. 4, A 
and B). Mitochondrial OXPHOS was also elevated in CypD-deficient 
T cells, as seen by the overall increase of the basal oxygen consump-
tion rate (OCR; Fig. 4C). CypD-deficient T cells appeared to operate 
at maximum mitochondrial capacity, with very little spare respiratory 
capacity compared to control cells (Fig. 4C and fig. S6A). The ob-
served global increase in metabolism of CypD-deficient T cells (Fig. 4D) 
correlated with greater glucose and glutamine consumption in CypD- 
deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4, E and F). These effects were not limited 
to CD8+ T cells, because similar changes in metabolism (fig. S6, B and 
C) and cytokine production (fig. S6D) were also observed in CD4+ T cells. 
These changes were also independent of the number of mitochon-
dria in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from WT or Ppif−/− mice (fig. S6E).
Cytokine production is associated with rates of glycolytic metab-
olism (21, 34). Thus, we hypothesized that the hyperinflammatory 
phenotype of CypD-deficient CD8+ T cells may be due to the hyper-
metabolic state of these Tcells. To test this, we treated invitro– 
generated CD8+ WT and CypD-deficient T effector cells for 5 hours 
with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). Treatment of 
CypD-deficient T cells with 2-DG entirely ablated the increased 
IFN- response of these cells (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, inhibition of 
lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which regulates the latter arm of 
glycolysis, using sodium oxamate led to markedly reduced IFN- 
responses in CypD-deficient T cells (Fig. 4G). These data suggest that 
increased cytokine production in CypD-deficient T cells is due, in 
part, to aberrant glucose metabolism in these cells. It appears that 
CypD regulates T cell metabolism independent of the classical mam-
malian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), Akt, or hypoxia- 
inducible factor–1 (HIF-1) pathways (fig. S6, F to I).
Another well-documented regulator of T cell proliferation is re-
active oxygen species (ROS) (20). Mitochondrial ROS (mROS), pro-
duced at complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC), is required 
for T cell expansion (20). Nonmitochondrial oxygen consumption was 
markedly increased in CypD-deficient T cells (Fig. 4H), suggesting 
that residual oxygen consumption may occur from other sources such 
as ROS production. Consistent with this, mROS levels was significantly 
elevated in CypD-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4I). Quenching of mROS 
by coenzyme Q (CoQ; an electron carrier for the ETC that acts as an 
antioxidant) significantly reduced ECAR and OCR in CypD-deficient 
T cells (Fig. 4, J and K) and reversed the hyperproliferative pheno-
type of CypD-deficient CD8+ T cells while having no effect on WT 
T cell proliferation (Fig. 4, L and M). Thus, these data suggest that 
CypD regulates T cell metabolism in a ROS-dependent manner.
CypD intrinsically regulates T cell–mediated 
immunopathology
To directly test the potential role of CypD in hyperproliferation and 
activation of T cells, we next generated chimeric mice in which only 
T cells lack CypD (T cellPpif−/− chimeric mice). As shown in Fig. 5A, 
irradiated / TCR–deficient mice (Tcra−/−) were reconstituted with 
BM cells from Tcra−/− and Ppif−/− mice mixed in a 4:1 ratio, respec-
tively. Thus, T cells in reconstituted T cellPpif−/− mice are only derived 
from Ppif−/− precursors, whereas the non–T cells are predominantly 
Ppif+/+. Control chimeric mice were generated in an equivalent man-
ner by using a BM mixture from Tcra−/− mice and WT littermates 
(T cellsPpif+/+ chimeric mice). Twelve weeks after reconstitution, we 
confirmed the absence of CypD in T cells purified from T cellPpif−/− 
mice (Fig. 5B). To evaluate T cell responses, we aerosolized chimeric 
mice with virulent Mtb. Five weeks after Mtb infection, we observed 
a significant increase in antigen specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs of 
T cellPpif−/− mice (Fig. 5, C and D). In parallel, the levels of IFN- and 
TNF were significantly higher in CD8+ T cells isolated from the 
lungs of T cellPpif−/− mice (Fig. 5, E and F). These results indicate that 
CypD intrinsically regulates T cell responses after Mtb infection.

Considering in the absence of CypD, the capacity of T cells in 
host resistance to Mtb infection was not impaired (Figs. 1, A and C, 
and 2J), we next investigated the potential contribution of CypD in 
T cell–mediated disease tolerance using both loss- and gain-of- 
function 
approaches. First, we depleted T cells in Ppif−/− and WT mice at days 7 
and 14 after IV infection with the low dose of Mtb (fig. S6J). As ex-
pected, Ppif−/− mice treated with rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) suc-
cumbed earlier to infection than WT mice. Temporary depletion of 
T cells significantly prolonged survival of Ppif−/− mice (Fig. 5G), 
supporting the contribution of an exacerbated T cell response to 
susceptibility. Second, to further support the contribution of CypD- 
deficient T cells in disease tolerance to Mtb infection, we used an 
adoptive transfer model where Rag1-deficient mice were reconstituted 
with naïve WT or CypD- 
deficient T cells or equal numbers of CypD- 
deficient T cells and WT T cells (1:1) before aerosolized infection with 
low dose of Mtb (Fig. 5H). Without T cells, mice quickly succumbed to 
death, whereas reconstitution of WT T cells significantly enhanced 
survival of mice from Mtb infection. By contrast, Ppif−/− T cells failed 
to enhance survival, and the lung histology examination showed severe 
parenchymal inflammatory infiltrate and tissue damages (Fig. 5, I 
and J). However, reconstitution of Rag1−/− mice with equal numbers 
of CypD-deficient T cells and WT T cells significantly increased the

survival compared with mice that received only CypD-deficient T cells 
(Fig. 5I). Together, these results indicate that, although the protective 
capacity of CypD- 
deficient T cells in host defense is integral, their 
heightened proliferative capacity and activation state compromised 
disease tolerance in TB.
DISCUSSION
Although control of TB requires T cells to prevent disease progression 
and delaying T cell priming is one strategy that Mtb uses to subvert 
the host immune response (36), the direct role of T cells in protec-
tion against Mtb is still controversial. Here, we identify CypD as a 
critical regulator of T cell activation that controls the magnitude of 
the T cell response to Mtb infection.
Although in macrophages, CypD prevents necrosis that enhances 
macrophage resistance to Mtb infection (26, 28, 29), Ppif−/− mice were 
extremely susceptible to Mtb infection despite similar bacterial burden 
and enhanced T cell–mediated immunity. This enhanced susceptibil-
ity to Mtb infection was due to an intrinsic function of CypD in T cells, 
because depletion of CypD-deficient T cells significantly increased 
survival, and reconstitution of CypD-deficient T cells significantly 
increased mortality to Mtb infection. Our data suggest that CypD reg-
ulates a metabolic checkpoint in T cells—partly through the regula-
tion of mROS—to promote enhanced T cell proliferation and effector 
function. These results also indicate that CypD regulates mitochon-
drial function in a cell-dependent manner that, under stress, may 
control either cell death program or survival and proliferation. One 
unique difference between fully differentiated macrophages, struc-
tural cells (e.g., cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts), and T cells is their 
capacity to proliferate. Thus, as T cells are intrinsically programmed 
to proliferate, the functional role of CypD appears to be mainly wired 
to regulate metabolism and proliferation rather than MPTP and cell 
death.
T cell metabolic programs adapt based on their activation state. 
Whereas the generation of ATP for quiescent naïve T cells depends 
on OXPHOS, activated T cells use glycolysis to adequately match 
production to their increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs 
(37). Although the role of CypD in the cell death program is well 
established, little is known about its influence on other mitochondri-
al functions such as metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that CypD 
is a key checkpoint for T cell metabolism. CypD-deficient T cells 
display increases in both glycolysis and OXPHOS, which support 
both the mitochondrial biosynthetic and ATP production pro-
grams needed for enhanced proliferation after Mtb infection. 
Blocking glycolysis with 2-DG or sodium oxamate ablated cyto-
kine production by CypD- 
deficient T cells, indicating a direct link 
between increased glycolytic activity and increased effector func-
tion in CypD-deficient T cells. The metabolic reprogramming ob-
served in activated CypD-deficient T cells was not driven by classical 
mTORC1/HIF-1 signaling but rather was dependent on ROS sig-
naling. CypD-deficient T cells operated at maximal mitochondrial 
capacity and produced substantially higher levels of mROS com-
pared with control T cells. Quenching excess ROS using antioxidants 
was sufficient to reverse the glycolytic phenotype of CypD- 
deficient 
T cells and return T cell proliferation to control levels. mROS pro-
duction can drive glycolytic metabolism and is essential for T cell 
activation and proliferation (20). Thus, the enhanced proliferation 
may be a secondary response to metabolic dysfunction induced 
by heightened ROS production in CypD-deficient T cells. CypD- 
deficient cells also display increased pyruvate dehydrogenase and 
-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (38), which may help drive 
the increased OCR in these T cells.
Although we have demonstrated the regulatory impact of CypD 
on T cell metabolism and disease tolerance to Mtb infection, it will be 
important to investigate the impact of CypD in whole tissue or even 
systemic metabolic responses. TB was initially known as “consumption” 
due to its ability to cause cachexia (wasting). Consistent with this idea, 
a previous study examining Mycobacterium marinum infection in 
the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster showed an increased mortality 
that was independent of bacterial load but was associated with al-
tered host metabolisms and increased body wasting (7). Therefore, 
unraveling the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in meta-
bolic regulation of disease tolerance is essential for a complete un-
derstanding of TB pathogenesis.
Exposure to Mtb leads to two broad outcomes: elimination of 
the bacteria or its persistence (1). If Mtb is not eliminated (most likely 
within the airway), then the pathogen translocates into the lung pa-
renchyma and leads to granuloma development. It appears that 
granuloma formation is a double-edged sword that, on the one 
hand, prevents the dissemination of Mtb but, on the other hand, 
allows persistence of Mtb by recruiting monocytes/macrophages, 
which are required for the growth of bacteria (39). T cells are a dom-
inant constituent of granuloma formation that has long been 
thought as a critical component of host protective immunity to Mtb 
infection. The prevailing paradigm that T cells provide protection 
against Mtb infection stems from studies using major histocompati-
bility complex class I (MHC-I) knockout (KO; lacking CD8+ T cells), 
MHC-II KO (lacking CD4+ T cells), or TCR KO (lacking both CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells) mice, all of which are impaired in effective granu-
loma development, are unable to control Mtb growth and are pro-
foundly susceptible to infection (40, 41). In contrast to the setting of 
T cell deficiency, an increased number of T cells is also not benefi-
cial to the host. For instance, adoptive transfer of high numbers of 
Mtb antigen–specific T cells before aerosol Mtb infection fails to 
eliminate the bacteria (42). Several studies have also demonstrated 
that impaired PD-1 signaling notably enhances host susceptibility 
to Mtb infection due to excessive CD4+ T cell activation that drives 
both the growth of bacteria and immunopathology (13, 14). Al-
though PD-1 regulates T cell functions that affect host resistance and 
immunopathology in TB, our study demonstrates that CypD intrinsical-
ly regulates T cell functions in disease tolerance against TB. Thus, 
one could speculate that, during Mtb infection, the initiation of gran-
uloma formation is a transition of host defense mechanisms from 
resistance to tolerance, and T cells are the gatekeeper within granulo-
mas. Validation of this concept requires further investigation.
In 90 to 95% of Mtb-infected individuals, bacteria stay in a qui-
escent or latent state with infrequent progression to active TB disease 
(43). This epidemiological data indicate that humans have coevolved 
with Mtb to tolerate its presence with minimum immunopathology. 
Here, we show that CypD regulates T cell metabolism and directly 
affects disease tolerance but not host resistance to Mtb infection. 
Our study furthermore demonstrates that the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of disease tolerance to TB differ from host resistance 
with the former being a key component of host defense and surviv-
al. In addition, our data indicate that caution must be exercised in 
developing a TB-vaccination strategy to boost conventional T cell 
responses, which inadvertently may compromise disease tolerance 
to Mtb infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study used in vivo and in vitro models of Mtb infection to in-
vestigate disease tolerance in pulmonary TB. The original objective 
of this study was to determine the role of mitochondrial CypD in host 
resistance to Mtb infection. However, the experimental data revealed 
that CypD had no impact on host resistance (bacterial burden) and 
rather regulates T cell metabolism and disease tolerance to Mtb in-
fection. All experiments were performed at least twice. Every group 
consisted of at least three mice. No outliers were excluded from the 
data analysis. This study was not randomized and was not blinded.
Mice
Six- to 10-week-old C57BL/6, Rag1−/− (Jax: 002216), and Tcra−/− (Jax: 
002116) mice were from the Jackson Laboratory. OT-I T cell anti-
gen receptor-transgenic mice (specific for the OVA257–264, peptide 
SIINFEKL, restricted by H-2kb) were from Taconic Farm (4175-M), 
Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase F (Ppif) KO mice (CypD-deficient mice) 
were obtained from M. Forte (Oregon Health and Science University, 
Portland, OR, USA) and were bred at McGill University. All animal 
studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of and ap-
proved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of McGill University.
Histopathology and bacterial staining
Lung tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) staining. Scoring of histologic parameters was performed by a 
thoracic pathologist blinded to experimental data and included following 
parameters: bronchial/endobronchial inflammation, peribronchial 
inflammation, perivascular inflammation, interstitial inflammation, 
pleural inflammation, intra-alveolar inflammation, and overall severity 
(44–48). Microphotographs were taken using a DXM1200F digital 
camera (Nikon).
Adoptive transfer
CD3+ T cells were purified from spleens of naïve WT and Ppif−/− mice 
using negative selection (Pan T cell kit, Stemcell Technologies). The 
purity was more than 95%. One million CD3+ T cells were transferred 
intravenously to Rag1−/− recipient mice. One day later, Rag1−/− mice 
were infected via aerosol route with 50 to 100 H37Rv. At 1, 2, 4, and 
5 weeks after Mtb infection, CFU of lungs, spleens and livers were 
determined as described above. CD3+ T cells purified from the spleen 
and lymph nodes of naïve WT and Ppif−/− mice were stained with 5 M 
CFSE in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum 
albumin at room temperature. Staining was stopped after 8 min of 
incubation by addition of RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine 
serum. Cells (5 × 105) were transferred intravenously (via the retro- 
orbital vein) to Rag1−/− mice. Three days after adoptive transfer, CD8+ 
T cell proliferation was evaluated in the spleen of recipient mice by CFSE 
reduction.
Generation of mixed BM chimeric mice
BM from femurs and tibiae was flushed with RPMI medium. BM cells 
from Tcra-deficient mice and Ppif−/− mice were mixed in a proportion of 
4 to 1, respectively. This mixture was used to generate T cellPpif−/− chi-
meric mice. BM cells from Tcra-deficient mice and WT mice were com-
bined in the same way to generate T cellWT control mice. As recipient 
mice, we used Tcra-deficient mice that were irradiated with 9 gray (Gy). 
These mice were kept under antibiotic treatment [128 mg of polymixin 
B and 1.1 g of neomycin trisulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) per liter of drinking 
water] for 10 days after irradiation. Sixteen hours after irradiation, 4 × 
106 mixed BM cells were intravenously transferred to recipient mice. 
Chimeric mice were used after 12 weeks, at which time the hematopoietic 
compartment was reconstituted as determined by flow cytometry.
Bioenergetic flux analyser (Seahorse) assay
In vitro–activated T cells were collected, washed in PBS, and counted. 
They were plated on 96-well plates from Seahorse that were previ-
ously coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were plated at 200,000 cells per 
well and spun down at 1400 rpm for 5 min. A Seahorse Bioenergetic 
flux analyzer was used to measure the ECAR and the OCRs. Mito-
chondrial inhibitors were added every 10 min in the following order: 
oligomycin A (1.5 M), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-
hydrazone (FCCP; 2 M), and antimycin A (2 M).
Statistics
Data are means ± SD and analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t test or two- 
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as appropriate using the GraphPad 
Prism program (version 6). For survival analyses, log-rank test was per-
formed. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.
