IMPORTANCE The dopamine hypothesis suggests that dopamine abnormalities underlie
psychosis, irrespective of diagnosis, implicating dopamine dysregulation in bipolar affective
disorder and schizophrenia, in line with the research domain criteria approach. However, this
hypothesis has not been directly examined in individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder
with psychosis.
OBJECTIVES To test whether dopamine synthesis capacity is elevated in bipolar disorder with
psychosis and how this compares with schizophrenia and matched controls and to examine
whether dopamine synthesis capacity is associated with psychotic symptom severity,
irrespective of diagnostic class.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional case-control positron emission
tomographic study was performed in the setting of first-episode psychosis services in an
inner-city area (London, England). Sixty individuals participated in the study (22 with bipolar
psychosis [18 antipsychotic naive or free], 16 with schizophrenia [14 antipsychotic naive or
free], and 22 matched controls) and underwent fluorodihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine
([18F]-DOPA) positron emission tomography to examine dopamine synthesis capacity.
Standardized clinical measures, including the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young
Mania Rating Scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning, were administered. The study
dates were March 2013 to November 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dopamine synthesis capacity (Kicer) and clinical measures
(Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Global Assessment of
Functioning).
RESULTS The mean (SD) ages of participants were 23.6 (3.6) years in 22 individuals with
bipolar psychosis (13 male), 26.3 (4.4) years in 16 individuals with schizophrenia (14 male),
and 24.5 (4.5) years in controls (14 male). There was a significant group difference in striatal
dopamine synthesis capacity (Kicer) (F2,57 = 6.80, P = .002). Kicer was significantly elevated in
both the bipolar group (mean [SD], 13.18 [1.08] × 10−3 min−1; P = .002) and the schizophrenia
group (mean [SD], 12.94 [0.79] × 10−3 min−1; P = .04) compared with controls (mean [SD],
12.16 [0.92] × 10−3 min−1). There was no significant difference in striatal Kicer between the
bipolar and schizophrenia groups. Kicer was significantly positively correlated with positive
psychotic symptom severity in the combined bipolar and schizophrenia sample experiencing
a current psychotic episode, explaining 27% of the variance in symptom severity (n = 32,
r = 0.52, P = .003). There was a significant positive association between Kicer and positive
psychotic symptom severity in individuals with bipolar disorder experiencing a current
psychotic episode (n = 16, r = 0.60, P = .01), which remained significant after adjusting for
manic symptom severity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings are consistent with a transdiagnostic role for
dopamine dysfunction in the pathoetiology of psychosis and suggest dopamine synthesis
capacity as a potential novel drug target for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

sychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar af-
fectivedisorder,haveacombinedlifetimeprevalenceof
approximately 3%.1 The research domain criteria initia-
tive from the National Institute of Mental Health proposes that
common neurobiological mechanisms underlie symptom do-
mains across disorders.2 The neuromodulator dopamine has
been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis in
schizophrenia3-9 and psychosis in other disorders.10 Investiga-
tions using positron emission tomography (PET) have demon-
strated increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in
schizophrenia.11 Dopamine synthesis capacity is also elevated
in individuals at high clinical risk of psychosis,12-16 some of
whommaydevelopbipolaraffectivedisorderwithpsychosis,17
andinindividualswithpsychosisinthecontextoftemporallobe
epilepsy.10Thesefindingssuggestthatelevateddopaminesyn-
thesis capacity may be transdiagnostic, underlying psychosis
across disorders, rather than specific to schizophrenia. Evi-
dence also suggests that dopamine dysfunction increases with
development of psychosis15 and is greater in acute psychosis
relative to remission,9 suggesting a state component.
Bipolar affective disorder has an approximate lifetime
prevalence of 1%,18 and about half of the patients develop psy-
chosis, predominantly in the manic phase.19 Psychotic symp-
toms in bipolar affective disorder respond to antipsychotic
drugs (dopamine D2/D3 blockers), suggesting that a dopami-
nergic abnormality could underlie these symptoms.20-33 Dopa-
mine synthesis capacity is unaltered in bipolar disorder with-
out psychosis,34 although it remains unclear if dopamine
synthesis capacity is altered in individuals with bipolar disor-
der with a history of psychosis, whether this is related to psy-
chotic symptoms, or how this compares with schizophrenia.
Therefore, we sought to investigate dopamine synthesis
capacityindexedusingfluorodihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine([18F]-
DOPA) PET imaging in individuals with bipolar psychosis. We
hypothesized that (1) individuals with bipolar psychosis would
have elevated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity com-
pared with matched healthy controls and that this elevation
would be comparable to that in schizophrenia and (2) striatal
dopamine synthesis capacity would positively correlate with
psychotic symptom severity in individuals currently experi-
encing psychosis, irrespective of diagnosis, in line with evi-
dence linking dopamine dysregulation to psychotic state.9,15
Methods
Ethical permission was obtained from the local ethics com-
mittee (East of England–Cambridge East National Health Ser-
vice Research Ethics Committee) for this cross-sectional case-
control study. All participants provided written informed
consent to be included in the study. An a priori power calcu-
lation in G*power was used to determine the minimum sample
size (eAppendix in the Supplement). The study dates were
March 2013 to November 2016.
Participants
Patients with bipolar disorder were recruited from first-
episode psychosis services in an inner-city area (London, En-
gland).Theywereeligibleforinclusioninthestudyifthey(1)met
diagnostic (DSM-IV) criteria for bipolar affective disorder type
IasassessedbytheStructuredClinicalInterviewforDSM-IVAxis
I disorders,35 (2) had at least one current or previous psychotic
episode(definedbelow),and(3)demonstratednoevidencethat
symptoms were drug induced.
Individuals with schizophrenia were recruited from the
same first-episode psychosis services, matched with the bi-
polar group for age (within 5 years). They were eligible for
inclusion in the study if they (1) met the Structured Clinical In-
terview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders35 criteria for schizophre-
nia, (2) had at least one current or previous psychotic episode
as defined below, and (3) demonstrated no evidence that the
symptoms were drug induced.
A psychotic episode was defined as at least moderate se-
verity on one or more of the delusion (P1), hallucination (P3),
and persecution (P6) items on the Positive and Negative Syn-
drome Scale (PANSS) lasting for at least 1 week, consistent with
research definitions.17 We excluded the conceptual disorga-
nization item, which could be confounded by mania.
Age-matched (within 5 years) healthy controls were
recruited contemporaneously from the same geographical
area through advertisements in local media. Healthy volun-
teers had no previous or current history of psychiatric illness
(assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
Axis I disorders),35 no concurrent psychotropic medication
use, and no family history of psychosis. Full exclusion crite-
ria are given in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Clinical Assessments
Participants were assessed on the day of the PET scan with the
PANSS,36GlobalAssessmentofFunctioning(GAF)scale,37and,
in the bipolar group, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).38 All
patientsreceivedclinicalfollow-upforaminimumof18months
to determine diagnostic stability using DSM-IV criteria.
Medication history was recorded. Individuals were sub-
classified as antipsychotic naive (no current or previous treat-
ment), antipsychotic free (not currently taking antipsychotic
medication, with at least 6 weeks’washout for oral medica-
tion or 6 months’washout for depot medication), or cur-
rently treated with antipsychotics.39
Key Points
Question Is dopamine synthesis capacity elevated in bipolar
psychosis compared with controls?
Findings In this cross-sectional case-control positron emission
tomographic study of 22 individuals with first-episode bipolar
psychosis, 16 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia, and 22
controls, there was a statistically significant elevation in dopamine
synthesis capacity in those with bipolar psychosis compared with
controls. This difference was similar to that seen in schizophrenia,
and there was a statistically significant association between
positive psychotic symptoms and dopamine synthesis capacity in
the whole sample, explaining 27% of the variance.
Meaning Dopamine synthesis capacity is elevated in bipolar
psychosis and is associated with positive psychotic symptoms,
irrespective of diagnosis.

 [18F]-DOPA PET Imaging
Imaging data were obtained on a PET scanner (Biograph 6
HiRez; Siemens) in 3-D mode. Participants were not permit-
ted to smoke for 4 hours preceding the scan.40 One hour be-
fore the scan, participants received 400 mg of entacapone, a
peripheralcatechol-O-methyl-transferaseinhibitor,and150mg
of carbidopa, a peripheral aromatic acid decarboxylase inhibi-
tor, to prevent formation of radiolabeled metabolites that may
cross the blood-brain barrier.41 After acquiring a computed to-
mographic scan for attenuation correction, approximately 160
MBq of [18F]-DOPA was administered by bolus intravenous in-
jection 30 seconds after the start of PET imaging (eAppendix
in the Supplement).
PET Image Analysis
The region-of-interest analysis was conducted masked to
group status. Our primary end point was the dopamine syn-
thesis capacity (Kicer, written previously as Ki
42) in the whole
striatum. In view of evidence that dopaminergic alterations
may be more marked in schizophrenia in the associative sub-
division of striatum relative to other regions13,43,44 and
elevated in the substantia nigra,44 we also conducted sec-
ondary analyses of these regions. Statistical parametric map-
ping (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging45) was
used to automatically normalize a tracer-specific tem-
plate,13,46 together with functional striatal and substantia
nigra regions of interest defined in Montreal Neurologic
Institute space,47,48 to each individual PET summation
realigned image. Further details of striatal subdivisions are
given in the eAppendix in the Supplement. The cerebellum
was used as the reference region, defined as per Martinez et
al.48 Kicer was calculated using the Patlak-Gjedde graphical
approach adapted for reference tissue input function, which
has been shown to have good reliability.46 Although the ref-
erence region approach is robust to global differences in
radiotracer delivery to the brain,49 we examined the refer-
ence region (cerebellum) to see whether there was any
change in standardized uptake values in the cerebellum at 95
minutes.
An exploratory voxelwise analysis was conducted to
determine subregional differences in Kicer between groups.
Details are given in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using software programs
(Microsoft Excel for Mac, version 15; Microsoft Corp50 and
SPSS, version 23; SPSS Inc51). Normality of distribution was
confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Independent-sample
t tests for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney tests
for nonparametric data were used to examine if there were
differences in demographic and clinical variables between
groups.
To test for differences in striatal Kicer between the 3 diag-
nostic groups, we used analysis of variance, with Tukey test
for post hoc pairwise comparisons. To test the association
between Kicer and positive psychotic symptom scores in indi-
viduals experiencing a current psychotic episode (irrespective
of diagnosis), we used Pearson product moment correlation.
In addition, we restricted this analysis to individuals with
bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia separately. Manic
symptoms may be linked to dopamine dysfunction25,52,53 and
may covary with psychotic symptoms. Therefore, we also
conducted partial correlation with the YMRS as a covariate
(excluding the “content” item on the YMRS, which indexes
psychotic symptoms).
Plots were inspected for outliers, and Cook distance of 4/n
was used to identify outliers. A 2-tailed significance (α) thresh-
old of 0.05 was used throughout.

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
In total, 22 individuals were included in the bipolar group, 16
individuals were included in the schizophrenia group, and 22
individuals were included in the healthy control group. All pa-
tients received follow-up, which confirmed that diagnoses re-
mained stable.

summarized in Table 1.
Sixteen of 22 individuals in the bipolar group and all 16
individuals in the schizophrenia group fulfilled criteria for a
current psychotic episode, with the remainder having a his-
tory of a psychotic episode within the last 2 years. Of the 22
individuals with bipolar psychosis, 18 (10 antipsychotic naive
and 8 antipsychotic free) were not taking antipsychotics at
the time of the PET scan (eAppendix in the Supplement). Of
the 16 individuals with schizophrenia, 14 (11 antipsychotic
naive and 3 antipsychotic free) were not taking antipsychot-
ics at the time of the PET scan (Table 1). Two individuals (one
in the bipolar group and one in the schizophrenia group)
were taking aripiprazole at the time of the PET scan (one for
<2 weeks).
Uptake in the Reference Region and Movement Variables
Across Groups
There was no significant association of group with standard-
ized uptake values in the reference region (eAppendix in the
Supplement). In addition, no significant association of group

(SD) values of 13.06 (9.07) mm for the bipolar group, 14.52

Dopamine Synthesis Capacity Across Groups
There was a significant group difference in Kicer in the whole
striatum (F2,57 = 6.80, P = .002) and its functional subdivi-

and the schizophrenia group (12.94 [0.79] × 10−3 min−1) was

bipolar group and Cohen d = 0.91, P = .04 in the schizophre-
nia group). There was no significant difference in Kicer in the
whole striatum between the bipolar and schizophrenia groups
(P = .73). The group difference in Kicer remained significant af-

ing 18 in the bipolar group and 14 in the schizophrenia group
(F2,51 = 6.40, P = .003): the mean (SD) whole striatal Kicer was

min−1 in the schizophrenia group, and 12.16 (0.92) × 10−3 min−1
in the control group. Because the schizophrenia group had lon-
ger duration of illness than the bipolar group, we ran a sec-
ondary analysis of the relationship between whole striatal Kicer
and the duration of illness across the patient groups, which
showed no significant relationship (r = −0.05, P = .78).
Voxelwise analysis identified significantly greater Ki
cer
in the bipolar group relative to controls (peak in the right
caudate) and in the schizophrenia group relative to controls
(peak in the left putamen) (Figure 1). Relative to controls,
the subregional analyses showed significant elevations in all
3 functional striatal subdivisions in the bipolar group but
only a suggestion in the associative striatum in the schizo-
phrenia group, with no differences in the substantia nigra
for either group (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Relationship Between Kicer and Psychotic Symptom Severity
Across Diagnostic Groups
We found a significant association between whole striatal
Kicer and the PANSS positive subscale symptom severity

patients experiencing a current psychotic episode (Figure 2),
explaining 27% of the variance (n = 32, r = 0.52, P = .003).

removal of this individual did not affect the significance
(r = 0.49, P = .01). There was no association between whole

(r = 0.13, P = .48 and r = 0.30, P = .10, respectively).
Symptom Correlation in Bipolar Disorder
In the whole sample of individuals with bipolar disorder (with
and without a current psychotic episode), there was a nonsig-
nificantrelationshipbetweenwholestriatalKicerandthePANSS
positive subscale symptom severity score (n = 22, r = 0.42,
P = .05).Thisrelationshipwassignificantwhenthesamplewas
restricted to patients with bipolar disorder with a current psy-
chotic episode, explaining 36% of the variance in positive
symptoms (n = 16, r = 0.60, P = .01), and remained signifi-
cant after covarying for the YMRS (excluding the “content”
item) (r = 0.56, P = .046).
Symptom Correlation in Schizophrenia
Finally, symptom correlation was assessed in the schizophre-
nia group. In the whole sample of patients with schizophrenia
(allexperiencingacurrentpsychoticepisode),therewasnocor-
relation between whole striatal Kicer and the PANSS positive
symptoms (n = 16, r = 0.31, P = .24).
Discussion
Dopamine synthesis capacity was elevated, with a large ef-
fect size (Cohen d = 1.02), in individuals with bipolar affec-
tive disorder and a current or previous psychotic episode com-
pared with healthy controls. In addition, dopamine synthesis
capacity was significantly elevated in the schizophrenia group
relative to controls. Moreover, dopamine synthesis capacity
was associated with the severity of psychotic symptoms in the
bipolar group, explaining 36% of the variance in psychotic
symptoms. This relationship remained significant after ad-
justing for the severity of manic symptoms.
The finding herein of no difference in Kicer in the substan-
tia nigra between the schizophrenia group and controls differs
from the results by Howes et al.44 However, it should be noted
that our study was underpowered to detect this influence.
Our finding of a relationship between positive psychotic
symptoms and dopamine synthesis capacity in the combined
bipolar and schizophrenia sample but not in the schizophre-
nia group could be due to a lack of power or inclusion of more
patients with longer illness durations in the schizophrenia
group. However, while some studies13,44,54 in schizophrenia
have found relationships with symptoms, other studies55-58
have not, suggesting that further work is needed to disen-
tangle these correlations.
Strengths and Limitations
A strength of our study is the large number of participants
who were antipsychotic naive or free. Furthermore, most
individuals were symptomatic and were experiencing an
acute psychotic episode at the time of the PET scan. The
bipolar and schizophrenia groups were matched for age and
medication status, but by chance the schizophrenia group
had significantly longer duration of illness. However, there
was no relationship between the duration of illness and Kicer
in either group. A concern in first-episode samples is that
diagnoses may change. However, in bipolar disorder, more
than 90% of diagnoses made on initial presentation are
stable 2 years later,59 although diagnoses may be more
dynamic in the early-intervention services that we recruited

 from because they aim to see patients as soon as possible.
On follow-up (minimum of 18 months), none of the indi-
viduals classified as having either bipolar disorder or schizo-
phrenia had their diagnoses changed, and the validity of
diagnosis is strengthened by the difference in negative but
not positive symptoms between groups. We did not detect a
difference in head motion between groups, although it was
greater in absolute terms in the patient groups. Given that
motion, especially in the basal ganglia, causes loss of
resolution,60 any residual motion after motion correction
would reduce Kicer. However, because this would lead to an
underestimate of Kicer, it would not account for our findings.
A potential limitation is the lack of a nonpsychotic con-
trol group given possible nonspecific influences of illness, al-
though a prior [18F]-DOPA study34 in individuals with non-
psychotic mania failed to find a difference compared with
controls. Our study was not constructed or powered to detect
a difference between bipolar psychosis and schizophrenia.
A small number of individuals were taking antipsychotic
medication. The results of preclinical studies61,62 suggest
that antipsychotic blockade of autoreceptors should cause
increased DOPA uptake. However, these studies generally
used short exposures to antipsychotics, which may not be
equivalent to months of patient exposure. Indeed, there is
evidence from animal investigations that 3 weeks of antipsy-
chotic treatment leads to depolarization, decreasing sponta-
neous firing of dopamine neurons,63 which would reduce
dopamine synthesis. Consistent with this finding, the one
relevant human study64 found that subchronic antipsychotic
treatment reduced [18F]-DOPA uptake in individuals with
schizophrenia, which would not explain our results because
the effect of antipsychotics would mask any difference com-
pared with controls. However, individuals in that study took
only haloperidol for their psychiatric symptoms, and it
remains to be determined in patients what effect other anti-
psychotics have on Kicer. Nonetheless, Kicer remained signifi-
cantly elevated in the patient groups herein when our analy-
sis was restricted to patients who were antipsychotic naive
or free, indicating that our findings are not explained by
direct treatment influences.
Our outcome measure, Kicer, indexes the uptake of [18F]-
DOPA into dopamine neurons, as well as its conversion by aro-
matic acid decarboxylase into [18F]-dopamine and storage in
terminals.49 Therefore, the increased Kicer we report likely re-
flects an increase in one or more of these processes, as well as
a net increase in dopamine synthesis capacity.65 However, be-
cause tyrosine hydroxylase, not aromatic acid decarboxyl-
ase, is the rate-limiting step in dopamine synthesis, this in-
terpretationcouldbeaffectediftherearealterationsintyrosine
hydroxylase levels or activity. Indeed, reduced tyrosine hy-
droxylase levels could conceivably lead to reduced net dopa-
mine synthesis, despite a compensatory increase in aromatic
acid decarboxylase activity detectable with [18F]-DOPA
imaging.
We did not measure plasma input function. There could
conceivably be alterations in the delivery of [18F]-DOPA, al-
though the reference region approach is robust to global
differences.49 To exclude this potential confounding factor, we
examined the reference region to see whether there was any
change across groups and found no difference.
Kicer reflects a composite of kinetic parameters, includ-
ing not only blood-tissue transportation (ie, K1 and k2) but also
relative activity of aromatic acid (DOPA) decarboxylase with
respect to [18F]-DOPA (k3) and the elimination of decarboxyl-
ated [18F]-DOPA metabolites from the brain (kloss).49,66 There-
fore, while our findings indicate elevation in these aspects of
dopaminergic activity, differences measured for Kicer could re-
flect change in one or more of these parameters. However, Kicer
has been shown to correlate well with the [18F]-DOPA decar-
boxylation rate (k3D) derived from the 2-tissue compartmen-
tal model, with a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input
functioninbothnormalandpathologicalconditions.67,68More-
over, if any bias was introduced in Kicer estimates by the quan-
tification approach, it is likely to be consistent across all
3 groups in our cross-sectional case-control study. However,
future studies could address this by measuring the arterial
input function.
Conclusions
Our results contrast with prior molecular imaging studies34,69
in bipolar disorder finding that dopamine synthesis and re-
leasecapacitywasunaltered.However,incontrasttoourstudy,
neither of these prior studies included individuals with bipo-
lar illness with current psychosis, although one study34 in-
cluded patients with mania and did not find a relationship be-
tween manic symptoms and dopamine synthesis capacity.
Moreover, the association between Kicer and psychotic symp-
toms in our sample remained after controlling for manic symp-
toms, suggesting that it was not driven by mania. Taken to-
gether with the previous results, our findings suggest that
elevated dopamine synthesis capacity is linked to psychosis
in bipolar disorder. However, a direct comparison between
individuals having bipolar disorder with vs without psycho-
sis is needed to definitively test the specificity of our findings
to psychosis in bipolar disorder. While we found an associa-
tion between dopamine synthesis capacity and bipolar psy-
chosis, this result does not imply causality. Further studies
are required to determine the relationship between dopa-
mine synthesis capacity and development of psychosis in
bipolar disorder.
We found that dopamine synthesis capacity is elevated in
psychotic bipolar affective disorder to a degree similar to that
inschizophreniaandisrelatedtotheseverityofpsychotic(posi-
tive) symptoms. These results extend previous findings that
dopaminesynthesiscapacityiselevatedinschizophrenia11and
psychosis associated with temporal lobe epilepsy10 and in-
creases with the onset of psychosis,15 suggesting that presyn-
apticdopaminedysfunctionisassociatedwithpsychosisacross
diagnostic categories. This finding provides a potential neu-
robiological explanation for why antipsychotic drugs, which
are all dopamine D2/D3 receptor blockers, are effective in bi-
polar psychosis and schizophrenia70-72 and identifies the regu-
lation of dopamine synthesis as a potential novel drug target
for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
