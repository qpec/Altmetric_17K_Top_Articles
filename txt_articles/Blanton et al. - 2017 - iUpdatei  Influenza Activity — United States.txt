During May 21–September 23, 2017,* the United States 
experienced low-level seasonal influenza virus activity; however, 
beginning in early September, CDC received reports of a small 
number of localized influenza outbreaks caused by influenza 
A(H3N2) viruses. In addition to influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were detected 
during May–September worldwide and in the United States. 
Influenza B viruses predominated in the United States from late 
May through late June, and influenza A viruses predominated 
beginning in early July. The majority of the influenza viruses 
collected and received from the United States and other coun-
tries during that time have been characterized genetically or 
antigenically as being similar to the 2017 Southern Hemisphere 
and 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere cell-grown vaccine reference 
viruses; however, a smaller proportion of the circulating A(H3N2) 
viruses showed similarity to the egg-grown A(H3N2) vaccine 
reference virus which represents the A(H3N2) viruses used for the 
majority of vaccine production in the United States. Also, dur-
ing May 21–September 23, 2017, CDC confirmed a total of 33 
influenza variant virus† infections; two were influenza A(H1N2) 
variant (H1N2v) viruses (Ohio) and 31 were influenza A(H3N2) 
variant (H3N2v) viruses (Delaware [1], Maryland [13], North 
Dakota [1], Pennsylvania [1], and Ohio [15]). An additional 18 
specimens from Maryland have tested presumptive positive for 
H3v and further analysis is being conducted at CDC.
United States
The U.S. Influenza Surveillance System§ is a collaboration 
between CDC and federal, state, local, and territorial partners 
* Data as of September 29, 2017.
† Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human 
population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.
§ The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information from 
eight data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance 
System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient illness surveillance 
(U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network); 3) mortality (the 
National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System and influenza-
associated pediatric mortality reports); 4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which 
includes the Emerging Infections Program and surveillance in three additional 
states); and 5) summary of the geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial 
epidemiologist reports). https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm.
and uses eight data sources to collect influenza informa-
tion,¶ six of which operate year-round. U.S. World Health 
Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric 
Virus Surveillance System laboratories, which include both 
public health and clinical laboratories throughout the United 
States, contribute to virologic surveillance for influenza. 
During May 21–September 23, 2017, clinical laboratories 
in the United States tested 153,397 respiratory specimens 
for influenza viruses, 3,785 (2.5%) of which were positive 
(Figure 1). Among these, 1,885 (49.8%) were positive for 
influenza A viruses, and 1,900 (50.2%) were positive for 
influenza B viruses. Public health laboratories in the United 
States tested 6,431 respiratory specimens collected during 
May 21–September 23, 2017. Among these, 1,536 were posi-
tive for influenza (Figure 2), including 842 (54.8%) that were 
positive for influenza A viruses, and 694 (45.2%) that were 
positive for influenza B viruses. Influenza B viruses were more 
commonly reported from late May through late June, and 
influenza A viruses have predominated since early July. Among 
the 828 (98.3%) influenza A viruses subtyped by public health 
laboratories, 715 (86.4%) were influenza A(H3N2) and 113 
(13.6%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Among the 
537 (77.4%) influenza B viruses for which lineage was deter-
mined, 398 (74.1%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 
139 (25.9%) belonged to the B/Victoria lineage.
During May 21–September 23, the weekly percentage of out-
patient visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness** 
from the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network remained below the national baseline†† of 2.2%, 
ranging from 0.7% to 1.2%. Based on data from CDC’s 
National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance 
 ¶ https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm.
 
** Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100°F [≥37.8°C]), oral or equivalent, and 
cough and/or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 
†† The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for 
influenza-like illness (ILI) during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three 
seasons plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as 
periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks in which each week accounted for <2% of 
the season’s total number of specimens that tested positive for influenza in 
public health laboratories. National and regional percentages of patient visits 
for ILI are weighted based on state population. Use of the national baseline 
for regional data is not appropriate.

System, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and 
influenza did not exceed the epidemic threshold§§ and ranged 
from 5.1% to 6.1%. Four influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
occurring during May 21–September 23 were reported; two 
were associated with an influenza A(H3N2) virus, one was 
associated with an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and one 
was associated with an influenza B virus.
 
§§ The seasonal baseline proportion of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths 
is projected using a robust regression procedure, in which a periodic regression 
model is applied to the observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were 
reported by the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance 
System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold is set at 1.645 
standard deviations above the seasonal baseline.
Novel Influenza A Virus Infections
Fifty-one human infections with novel influenza A 
viruses were reported in the United States during May 21–
September 23, 2017. All of these were variant virus infections 
(human infections with influenza viruses that normally circu-
late in swine). Thirty-one have been sequenced and are H3N2v 
viruses reported from five states (Delaware [1], Maryland 
[13], North Dakota [1], Pennsylvania [1], and Ohio [15]) 
and two were H1N2v viruses, both from Ohio. The remain-
ing 18 viruses have tested presumptive positive for H3v at the 
Maryland public health laboratory and further confirmatory 
testing is being performed by CDC. All 51 patients reported

exposure to swine in a fair setting during the week preceding 
illness onset. Swine influenza A viruses were identified from 
respiratory specimens collected from pigs at multiple fairs. 
Forty-seven of the 51 patients were children aged <18 years 
and four patients were adults aged ≥50 years. Three of the 51 
patients were hospitalized. All other patients are recovering or 
have fully recovered from their illness. No human-to-human 
transmission of these viruses has been identified.
The viruses detected in Maryland, Ohio, North Dakota, 
and Pennsylvania all had a hemagglutinin (HA) gene derived 
from a seasonal human H3N2 virus that was likely introduced 
into swine by reverse zoonosis (i.e., humans infecting swine) 
in 2010. These viruses were closely related to H3N2 viruses 
known to circulate in the U.S. swine population, as well as to 
variant virus infections detected in Ohio and Michigan dur-
ing 2016 (1). Further analysis of the variant viruses detected 
in the most recent cases from Maryland is being performed at 
CDC. One of the H1N2v viruses had an HA gene from the 
alpha sublineage of the classical swine H1 HA lineage (2). This 
is the second alpha sublineage H1N2v virus detected since 
the mid-1990s. The second H1N2v virus had an HA gene 
representative of the delta 2 sublineage circulating in swine. 
The HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes are closely related to 
2016/2017 swine influenza viruses from the United States. The 
NA genes of both H3N2v and H1N2v viruses are related to 
human H3N2 viruses that likely entered the North American 
swine population around 2002 and have remained the pre-
dominant NA found in contemporary swine influenza viruses.

along with other international public health partners, provides 
surveillance and virus characterization data to WHO.*** 
The timing of influenza activity around the world varies by 
region,††† and areas with similar influenza transmission pat-
terns are grouped by influenza transmission zones.§§§
Reports from GISRS during May 21–September 23 sug-
gested that typical seasonal patterns of influenza activity 
occurred in temperate climate Southern Hemisphere countries 
(3). Influenza activity began to increase in late April in the 
temperate countries of South America, late May in Southern 
Africa, early June in New Zealand, and early July in Australia. 
Influenza activity peaked in mid-June in temperate South 
America, the beginning of July in Southern Africa and New 
Zealand, and in mid-August in Australia, although elevated 
activity continued through September in Southern Africa and 
Australia. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated across 
the Southern Hemisphere countries, with some reported 
influenza B viruses cocirculating in temperate South America, 
New Zealand, and Australia. In temperate-climate countries of 
Europe and North America, influenza activity was low, with 
influenza B viruses predominating.
In countries with tropical influenza seasonality, influenza 
activity levels and the predominant virus varied by country. 
In Central America and the Caribbean, activity was low and 
influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses predominated. 
In tropical South America, influenza activity decreased from 
May 21 through September 23; influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
predominated with some influenza B viruses reported. Sporadic 
influenza virus detections were reported in Eastern and Western 
Africa, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), 
and influenza B viruses cocirculating. In Eastern Asia, high lev-
els of influenza activity were reported in Southern China, Hong 
Kong special administrative region (SAR), and Taiwan begin-
ning in July, peaked in mid-August, and decreased through 
September 23; influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated. In 
Southern Asia, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predomi-
nated, with elevated activity reported in India, Nepal, and the 
Maldives. Influenza activity in Southeast Asia was elevated in 
August and September. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
 *** http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/.
 ††† In temperate climates, the onset and peak of influenza activity might vary 
substantially from one influenza season to the next, but generally begins to 
increase in the late fall. In the Northern Hemisphere’s temperate regions, annual 
epidemics of influenza typically occur during October–February, but the peak 
of influenza activity can occur as late as April or May. In temperate regions of 
the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity typically peaks during May 
through August. Although temperate regions of the world experience a seasonal 
peak in influenza activity, influenza viruses can be isolated year-round. The 
timing of seasonal peaks in influenza activity in tropical and subtropical 
countries varies by region. Multiple peaks of activity during the same year have 
been seen in some areas and influenza infection can occur year-round.

predominated in the Philippines and Myanmar. Influenza 
A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses 
cocirculated in Singapore, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 
influenza B viruses cocirculated in Vietnam.
During May 23–September 13, WHO reported 100 
laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza 
viruses, all from China, including 99 Asian lineage avian 
influenza A(H7N9) infections, and one influenza A(H9N2) 
infection.¶¶¶ A total of 764 human infections, including 283 
(37%) deaths, with Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) 
virus were reported to WHO from more provinces, regions, 
and municipalities in China during the fifth epidemic than in 
the previous four epidemics combined (4).
Genetic and Antigenic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
The 2017–18 influenza vaccine virus components were 
selected in March 2017, during one of two biannual WHO-
sponsored vaccine consultation meetings to review influenza 
data generated by GISRS laboratories. The recommended 
Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 trivalent influenza vaccine 
composition consists of an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)
pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like 
virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) 
virus. An additional influenza B virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013-
like [B/Yamagata lineage]) was recommended for quad-
rivalent vaccines.**** These recommendations reflect an 
update to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus component to a 
more contemporary influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (an 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus was replaced 
with an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus), com-
pared with the recommendation for the Northern Hemisphere 
2016–2017 influenza season and are the same as the vac-
cine virus recommendations made for the 2017 Southern 
Hemisphere influenza vaccine.
Most influenza vaccines licensed in the United States, with 
the exception of cell culture–based inactivated influenza vac-
cine (ccIIV4) and recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV3 and 
RIV4) are produced through propagation of candidate vaccine 
viruses (CVVs) in eggs. Historically, CVVs provided to manu-
facturers have been egg-derived. Egg propagation of influenza 
viruses, particularly influenza A(H3N2) viruses, often leads to 
genetic changes that might have antigenic implications. The 
vaccine viruses selected for the Northern Hemisphere 2017–18

vaccine were representative of most, but not all, circulating 
influenza viruses at that time, and had the fewest and least 
substantial egg-adapted changes. In August 2016, the Food 
and Drug Administration approved the use of cell-derived 
CVVs for inclusion in ccIIV4.†††† For the 2017–18 season, the 
influenza A(H3N2) component of this vaccine is manufactured 
using a cell-derived CVV. The other components of this vac-
cine are manufactured using egg-derived CVVs. Production 
of influenza vaccines using cell-grown CVVs and cell-based 
technology can circumvent antigenic changes that might be 
associated with egg propagation, particularly for influenza 
A(H3N2) viruses.§§§§
Data obtained from antigenic characterization are important 
in the assessment of the similarity between reference vaccine 
viruses and circulating viruses. In vitro antigenic characteriza-
tion data acquired through hemagglutination inhibition (HI) 
assays or virus neutralization assays are used to assess whether 
genetic changes in circulating viruses affect antigenicity, 
which could affect vaccine effectiveness. Since the 2014–15 
season, many influenza A(H3N2) viruses lack sufficient 
hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization using 
hemagglutination inhibition assays. Therefore, representative 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses are selected for antigenic charac-
terization using the virus neutralization focus reduction assay 
to assess the ability of various antisera to neutralize infectivity 
of the test viruses. For nearly all influenza-positive surveil-
lance samples received by CDC, next generation sequencing 
(NGS), which employs genomic enrichment practices (5–7), 
adapted by CDC, Nextera library preparation (Illumina, San 
Diego, California) and NGS using MiSeq (Illumina, San 
Diego, California), is performed to determine the genetic 
identity of circulating viruses. The genomic data are analyzed 
and submitted to public databases (GenBank or GISAID 
EpiFlu). CDC has antigenically or genetically characterized 
877 influenza viruses collected and submitted by U.S. and 
international laboratories since May 21, 2017, including 117 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 495 influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses, and 265 influenza B viruses.
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from the A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses collected since May 21, 2017, showed that all 
but one were in subclade 6B.1, and one virus belonged to clade 
6B (Figure 3). All A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically 
similar (analyzed using HI with ferret antisera) to the 6B.1 virus 
A/Michigan/45/2015, the recommended influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 reference virus for the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 
2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.

Four hundred ninety-five influenza A(H3N2) viruses collected 
globally since May 21, 2017, were sequenced, and phyloge-
netic analysis of the HA genes illustrated that multiple clades/
subclades were cocirculating (Figure 3). The HA genes showed 
extensive diversity and belonged to clades 3C.2a or 3C.3a, with 
3C.2a predominating (Figure 3). The 3C.2a and the 3C.2a1 
subclade circulated in approximately equal proportions. A repre-
sentative set of 153 influenza A(H3N2) viruses (51 international 
and 102 United States) were antigenically characterized, and 
most (97%) A(H3N2) viruses were well-inhibited (reacting at 
titers of less than or equal to fourfold of the homologous virus 
titer) by ferret antisera raised against A/Michigan/15/2014 
(3C.2a), a cell propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like refer-
ence virus representing the A(H3N2) component of the 2017 
Southern Hemisphere and 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere 
influenza vaccines. A smaller proportion (33%) of influenza 
A(H3N2) viruses were well-inhibited by antiserum raised 
against egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 reference 
virus representing the A(H3N2) vaccine component, which is 
likely because of egg-adaptive amino acid changes in the HA of 
the egg-propagated virus.
A total of 85 influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses were phy-
logenetically analyzed, and all HA genes belonged to genetic 
clade V1A, the same genetic clade as the vaccine reference virus, 
B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, two deletion subclades were 
detected in 2017. One subclade has a 6-nucleotide deletion 
(encoding amino acids 162 and 163) and the other subclade has 
a 9-nucleotide deletion (encoding amino acids 162, 163 and 
164). The 162–163 double deletion in the HA was detected 
in viruses circulating in multiple countries, with the majority 
identified in the United States, although the three viruses with 
162–164 triple deletion were only detected in Hong Kong 
SAR, China. Thirty-nine (72%) B/Victoria lineage viruses 
were well-inhibited by ferret antisera raised against MDCK-
propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 reference virus, representing 
the B/Victoria lineage component of the 2017 Southern 
Hemisphere and 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza 
vaccines. However, 28% of B/Victoria lineage viruses reacted 
poorly with ferret antisera raised against MDCK-propagated 
B/Brisbane/60/2008, which correlated with the 162–163 
double deletion and the 162–164 triple deletion in the HA.
Phylogenetic analysis of 180 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage 
viruses indicate that the HA genes belonged to clade Y3 
(Figure 3). A total of 99 representative influenza B/Yamagata-
lineage viruses (59 international and 40 United States) were 
antigenically characterized, and all were antigenically similar 
to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference vaccine virus represent-
ing the influenza B/Yamagata-lineage component of the 2017 
Southern Hemisphere and 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere 
quadrivalent vaccines.

Composition of the 2018 Southern Hemisphere 
Influenza Vaccine
The WHO recommendations for influenza vaccine composi-
tion for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere season were made at 
the WHO Vaccine Consultation meeting September 25–28, 
2017, in Melbourne, Australia. The recommended compo-
nents for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza trivalent 
vaccines are an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like 
virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like 
virus, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) 
virus (8). For quadrivalent vaccines, an additional component, 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus, is recom-
mended (8). This represents a change in the influenza A(H3N2) 
component and a change in the influenza B lineage included 
in the trivalent vaccine compared with the composition of 
the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017–18 Northern 
Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation. The H3N2 com-
ponent was updated to address the egg-adaptive changes that 
occurred with the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 
reference virus and to better represent genetic changes seen in 
recently circulating H3N2 viruses.

Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 
486 influenza virus specimens collected during May 21–
September 23, 2017, from the United States and worldwide 
for resistance to the influenza neuraminidase inhibitor anti-
viral medications currently approved for use against seasonal 
influenza: oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. A total of 75 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (37 international and 38 
United States) were tested, and all were sensitive to these drugs.

All 231 influenza A(H3N2) viruses (60 international and 171 
United States) and all 180 influenza B viruses (98 international 
and 82 United States) tested were also sensitive to all three 
recommended antiviral medications. High levels of resistance 
to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist 
among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses. Adamantane drugs continue not to be recommended 
for use against influenza at this time.
Discussion
During May 21–September 23, 2017, influenza A(H3N2), 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses co-cir-
culated worldwide. In the United States, influenza B viruses 
predominated from late May through late June. Influenza A 
viruses were most commonly reported beginning in early July. 
The majority of the influenza viruses collected from the United 
States and other countries during that time were characterized 
antigenically and genetically as being similar to the cell-grown 
reference viruses representing the 2017 Southern Hemisphere 
and 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. 
Antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating influenza 
viruses can give an indication of the influenza vaccine’s abil-
ity to produce an immune response against the wide array of 
influenza viruses cocirculating, but vaccine effectiveness studies 
are needed to determine how much protection has been pro-
vided to the population by vaccination. Influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses were detected at low levels from May 21 to 
September 23, and virus characterization data indicate no 
substantial genetic or antigenic changes, even among viruses 
from regions that experienced higher A(H1N1)pdm09 activ-
ity. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated in many 
countries in the Southern Hemisphere and in the United States 
since early July. Virus characterization data suggest extensive 
genetic diversity among circulating viruses, but limited evi-
dence of substantial antigenic drift. To date, a predominant 
subclade of A(H3N2) viruses with substantial antigenic drift 
has yet to emerge, and extensive genetic variation exists in the 
circulating virus population. Among the influenza B viruses 
for which lineage was determined, influenza B/Yamagata 
viruses predominated across the United States from May 21 
through September 23, and virus characterization data indicate 
no substantial genetic or antigenic changes. Two subgroups 
of antigenically distinct influenza B/Victoria viruses, repre-
sented by the double or triple deletion viruses, were detected; 
the majority of the double deletion viruses were identified in 
the United States, while all three triple deletion viruses were 
identified only in Hong Kong SAR, China. Nevertheless, 
such antigenically distinct viruses represented a minority of 
B/Victoria viruses circulating globally during this period. 
Close monitoring of these viruses is required to better assess 
their potential impact on public health. Although influenza 
B viruses circulate throughout the influenza season, they fre-
quently circulate later in the season than do influenza A viruses 
and often result in a second peak of influenza activity, often 
in the late winter and spring in the United States and other 
Northern Hemisphere countries (3).
Annual influenza vaccination is the best method for prevent-
ing influenza and its potentially severe complications (9). In the 
United States, annual influenza vaccination is recommended 
for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindica-
tions. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended regard-
less of whether the vaccine composition has changed because 
immunity from vaccination wanes over time and might decline 
below protective levels after one season. Optimally, vaccination 
should occur before the onset of influenza activity in the com-
munity. If possible, vaccination should be offered by the end 
of October and should continue to be offered as long as influ-
enza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. 
Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses 
should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine 
becomes available, and the second dose ≥4 weeks later. For 
2017-18 season, manufacturers have projected they will supply 
the United States with as many as 151 to 166 million doses 
of injectable influenza vaccine; approximately 119 million of 
this will be quadrivalent vaccine. As of September 15, 2017, 
approximately 73 million doses had already been distributed.
Multiple influenza vaccines are approved and recommended 
for use and are being distributed during the 2017–18 season, 
including egg-based trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccines (IIV3 and IIV4), adjuvanted trivalent 
egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (aIIV3), high-dose 
trivalent egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (HD-IIV3), 
quadrivalent cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccines 
(ccIIV4), and recombinant trivalent and quadrivalent influenza 
vaccines (RIV3 and RIV4). Two available intramuscular vac-
cines are approved for administration by jet injector for persons 
aged 18 through 64 years. One IIV4 formulation is approved 
for intradermal administration. There is no preferential rec-
ommendation for one licensed and recommended influenza 
vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than 
one licensed, recommended product is available (9). Currently 
available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV3, 
RIV4, and ccIIV4, are prepared by propagation of virus in 
embryonated eggs (9). Egg propagation of influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses often leads to genetic changes that have antigenic 
implications. For the 2017–18 season inactivated vaccines, 
all influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and both influenza B 
components will be egg-derived, with the exception of ccIIV4, 
for which the influenza A(H3N2) virus component will, for 
the first time, be a cell-derived vaccine virus component (9).

This represents a first step toward producing a totally egg-
independent inactivated virus vaccine. Recombinant technol-
ogy is used in the production of RIV3 and RIV4; therefore 
they are manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or 
eggs. The use of egg-independent vaccine technologies is likely 
to provide vaccines that more precisely represent the antigenic 
characteristics of circulating viruses and have the potential to 
offer improved protection. Because of the low effectiveness of 
live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine (LAIV4) against 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the United States during 
the 2013–14 and 2015–16 seasons, for the 2017–18 season, 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and 
CDC renewed the recommendation that LAIV4 should not 
be used (9).
Although vaccination is the best method for preventing and 
reducing the impact of influenza, antiviral medications provide 
a valuable adjunct. Treatment with influenza antiviral medica-
tions as early as possible in the course of illness is recommended 
for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza (either 
seasonal influenza or novel influenza virus infection) who 
have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require 
hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-related 
complications¶¶¶¶ (10). Treatment is most effective when given 
early in the illness, especially within 48 hours of illness onset; 
providers should not delay treatment until test results become 
available and should not rely on insensitive assays such as found 
with some rapid antigen detection influenza diagnostic tests 
to determine treatment decisions (10).
Fifty-one infections with variant influenza viruses were 
reported from five states during summer 2017. Most of these 
infections occurred in children with prior direct contact with 
pigs at agricultural fairs, highlighting the importance of pre-
ventive actions,***** especially for young children or persons 
at high risk for serious influenza complications. Although 
community transmission of these viruses has not been identi-
fied, the potential for them to develop the ability to transmit 
efficiently from person to person remains a concern. Testing for 
 ¶¶¶¶ Persons at high risk include 1) children aged <2 years; 2) adults aged 
≥65 years; 3) persons with chronic pulmonary conditions (including 
asthma), cardiovascular disease (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, 
hematologic (including sickle cell) disease, metabolic disorders (including 
diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions 
(including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and 
muscles, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, 
intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental 
delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); 4) persons with 
immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by human 
immunodeficiency virus infection; 5) women who are pregnant or 
postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery); 6) persons aged ≤18 years who 
are receiving long-term aspirin therapy; 7) American Indians/Alaska Natives; 
8) persons with extreme obesity (i.e., body mass index ≥40); and 9) residents 
of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year-round in the United States. Timing of influenza activity and 
predominant circulating influenza viruses vary by season.
What is added by this report?
Worldwide, influenza activity during May 21–September 23, 
2017, followed typical seasonality and in the United States 
overall, low levels of seasonal influenza activity were detected. 
The majority of influenza viruses genetically and antigenically 
characterized at CDC were similar to the reference viruses 
representing the recommended components for the 2017–18 
vaccine. A small subset of antigenically distinct influenza 
B/Victoria viruses was detected.
What are the implications for public health practice?
In the United States, an annual influenza vaccination is recom-
mended for all persons aged ≥6 months and can reduce the 
likelihood of becoming ill with influenza and transmitting the 
virus to others. Annual influenza vaccination offers optimal 
protection regardless of whether the vaccine composition has 
changed since the previous season, because immunity wanes 
over time. Although vaccination is the best method for 
preventing and reducing the impact of influenza, antiviral 
medications are an important adjunct. Early treatment with 
influenza antiviral medications is recommended for patients 
with confirmed or suspected influenza (either seasonal 
influenza or novel influenza virus infection) who have severe, 
complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; 
or who are at high risk for influenza-related complications. 
Testing for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for novel 
influenza A virus infections should continue year-round.
seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for novel influenza A 
virus infections should continue year-round. Health care pro-
viders also are reminded to consider novel influenza virus 
infections in persons with influenza-like illness and swine or 
poultry exposure, or with severe acute respiratory infection 
after travel to areas where avian influenza viruses have been 
detected. Providers should alert the local public health depart-
ment if novel influenza virus infection is suspected. Clinical 
laboratories using a commercially available influenza diagnostic 
assay that includes influenza A virus subtype determination 
should contact their state public health laboratory to facilitate 
transport and additional testing of any specimen that is positive 
for influenza A, but for which the subtype cannot be deter-
mined. Public health laboratories should immediately send 
influenza A virus specimens that they cannot subtype using 
standard methods to CDC and submit all specimens that are 
otherwise unusual as soon as possible after identification. Early 
identification and investigation of human infections with novel 
influenza A viruses are critical to ensure timely risk assessment 
so that appropriate public health measures can be taken.
