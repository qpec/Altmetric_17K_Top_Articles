A
ccording to prospective cohort studies, smoking is the 
most important lifestyle risk factor for subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH)1–3 and accounts for at least one third of 
all cases.4,5 In addition, earlier studies report that women are 
at higher risk for SAH with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 
from 1.4 to 1.9 compared with men,1–3 but the reason for 
this sex difference has remained unresolved. Retrospective 
case–control studies have suggested that an increasing num-
ber of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) elevates the risk 
gradually.4,6,7
Our aim was to examine associations between smoking 
habits and SAH in a large, population-based, prospective 
cohort. We also focused on interaction or effect modifica-
tion between smoking habits and sex because this approach 
remains unstudied. In addition, we evaluated whether smok-
ing elevates the risk of sudden deaths from SAH outside 
hospitals or in emergency rooms more than hospitalizations. 
Finally, we evaluated the effect of smoking cessation on risk 
for future SAH.
Methods
Data Collection
The research protocol has been described in detail.2,8,9 In brief, the 
National FINRISK Surveys have been conducted every 5 years since 
1972, with independent, population-based, random samples from vari-
ous geographical areas of Finland. Alcohol consumption, history of 
hypertension, medication for hypertension, smoking status, and socio-
economic status were assessed by a standardized self-administered 
questionnaire. Individuals with a history of hypertension or medication 
for hypertension received the classification hypertensive. Experienced 
nurses performed clinical measurements including systolic blood 
pressure, height, and weight and acquired semifasting blood samples 
for cholesterol measurement after at least 4-hour fasting.
Follow-Up
Follow-up started at enrollment and ended at first-ever SAH, death, 
or on December 31, 2011, whichever came first. The nationwide 
Hospital Discharge Register and Causes of Death Register identi-
fies fatal (including outside of hospital and emergency-room SAH 
deaths) and nonfatal SAHs with high accuracy.10 Sudden deaths from 
SAH were defined as deaths away from hospitals and those occurring 
Background and Purpose—Women are at higher risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) than men for unknown reasons. 
Also cumulative effects of smoking have been neglected among prospective studies. We studied associations between 
smoking habits and SAH and interactions between known SAH risk factors in a prospective population-based study.
Methods—The population-based FINRISK study cohort of 65 521 individuals was followed up for 1.38 million person-
years. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to calculate hazard ratios and evaluated additive and multiplicative 
interactions between study variables, with all analyses adjusted for known SAH risk factors.
Results—During follow-up, we identified 492 SAHs (266 women). Smoking had a linear dose-dependent and cumulative 
association with risk for SAH in both sexes. Women smoking >20 cigarettes per day had a hazard ratio of 8.35 (95% 
confidence interval, 3.86–18.06) compared with a hazard ratio of 2.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.68–4.52) in men 
in the same cigarettes per day group. Hazard ratios differed by sex in all cigarettes per day and pack-year categories; 
this association was stronger in women in all categories (P=0.01). When an adjusted model included interaction terms 
between sex and cigarettes per day or pack-years, female sex was no longer an independent SAH risk factor. Former 
smokers had a markedly decreased risk for SAH in both sexes when compared with current smokers.
Conclusions—Smoking has a dose-dependent and cumulative association with SAH risk, and this risk is highest in female 
heavy smokers. Vulnerability to smoking seems to explain in part the increased SAH risk in women.

in emergency rooms. Sudden deaths from SAH were confirmed in 
autopsy, and a nosologist checked and corrected the underlying cause 
of death when necessary. The follow-up was complete for deaths 
and hospitalizations, when hospitalized patients continued to live in 
Finland.9 Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE) statement11 guided the reporting.
Smoking
Those participants who reported no smoking at all or <100 cigarettes 
in their lifetime were considered never-smokers. Occasional smok-
ers had smoked on a nondaily basis during the past 6 months before 
enrollment. Recent quitters were participants who had quit smok-
ing within 6 months before enrollment; former smokers had quit >6 
months before enrollment. Current smokers reported how many ciga-
rettes they smoked per day on average, separately for manufactured 
and self-rolled cigarettes, and the sum of these 2 comprised their CPD.
On the basis of previous studies, we estimated that 1 cigar increased 
risk for SAH as much as 1 cigarette and 1 pipeful of tobacco as much as 
3 cigarettes.12–16 For analyses, we divided smoking status into 8 catego-
ries: never-smokers, occasional smokers, former smokers, recent quit-
ters, and further to 4 groups of current smokers. Current smokers were 
categorized on the basis of CPD into 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30, and ≥31 
CPD. Analyses using pack-years (PYs) included only current smokers. 
PYs were calculated by multiplying the number of CPD by the number 
of years the person had smoked before enrollment; this number was then 
divided by 20 (one pack=20 cigarettes). PYs were categorized as none 
(for all but current smokers), <5 PYs, 5 to 10 PYs, and then in 10-PY 
intervals until >50 PYs. Smoking status was available for 99.4% of the 
participants, CPDs for 99.2%, and PYs for 98.8% of the current smokers.
Statistical Analyses
Because of <2% of missing data per variable, we used complete case 
analyses. We used the Cox proportional hazard model to calculate 
HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in adjusted models. On the 
basis of previous prospective and population-based studies,1–3 our 
final model included age, smoking, systolic blood pressure, body 
mass index, cholesterol, sex, and study area and year. The prelimi-
nary models examined also the role of alcohol consumption and 
socioeconomic status. According to Schoenfeld residuals and log–
log inspection, our models met the proportional assumption criteria. 
The likelihood ratio test (LRT) served to evaluate the evidence of 
multiplicative interactions and departure from linearity in adjusted 
models; a LRT P value of <0.10 was considered evidence of pos-
sible interaction. A method described by Andersson et al17 served in 
assessing additive interactions by calculating a relative excess risk 
because of interaction, attributable proportion, and synergy index (SI) 
in adjusted models. We defined the evidence for additive interaction 
as strong when at least 2 of relative excess risk because of interaction, 
attributable proportion, or SI had P values <0.05. Competing risk 
incidence estimates were calculated by the method described by Fine 
and Gray.18 Population attributable risk was estimated by the follow-
ing formula: population attributable risk=pf (HR-1)/[pf (HR-1)+1], 
where pf is population fraction of smokers. All statistical analyses 
used Stata Corp version 12.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Ethics Statement
Ethical approval came from the corresponding ethics committee 
according to the commonly required research procedures and Finnish 
legislation for each survey, and the study was conducted according to 
the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki on ethical 
principles for medical research. From 2002 onward, written informed 
consent has been provided by each participant.8
Results
Cohort
The study cohort comprised 65 521 participants (33 805 
women) who participated in the baseline surveys between 
1972 and 2007. A total of 492 first-ever SAHs (266 women) 
were recorded during the 1.38 million person-years of follow-
up. The mean and median ages of the participants were 45.3 
(SD, 12.1) and 45.0 years. Median follow-up time for SAH 
cases was 14.8 years and for the whole cohort 21.1 years.
Smoking
At baseline, 19% of women and 38% of men were current 
smokers. Men had smoked longer, smoked more daily, and 
their total exposure (as PYs) was greater than in women 
(Table 1). Because only 3 occasional smokers had SAH, cal-
culation of HRs for this group was omitted. Current smokers 
had an HR of 2.77 (95% CI, 2.22–3.46) in comparison with 
never-smokers. In analysis by sex, HR was 2.20 (95% CI, 
1.56–3.10) for male smokers and 3.43 (95% CI, 2.58–4.55) 
for female smokers. This translates to a population attribut-
able risk estimate of 31% in both men and women. Recent 
quitters were at higher risk (HR, 1.93 [95% CI, 0.98–3.79]) 
for SAH than were former smokers (HR, 1.34 (95% CI, 0.98–
1.82]). Light smokers (1–10 CPD) were at elevated risk, and 
this risk increased gradually, reaching an HR of 3.91 (95% 
CI, 1.97–7.75) among very heavy smokers with >30 CPD 
(Table 2). A linear dose-dependent relationship also existed 
between CPD and risk for SAH in all models (Table 2). The 
association of smoking status with SAH risk was stronger in 
women in all groups (LRT P=0.01), indicating multiplicative 
interaction between sex and CPD (Table 2). In the CPD group, 
21 to 30 women had an HR of 8.35 (95% CI, 3.86–18.06) 
compared with an HR of 2.76 (95% CI, 1.68–4.52) in men 
(Table 2). The cumulative incidence by smoking status and 
CPD category with a competing risk model in Figure 1 shows 
the higher lifetime risk in women than in men.
Pack-Years
When compared with never-smokers, current smokers with 
<5 PYs had an elevated risk, with an HR of 2.13 (95% CI, 
1.44–3.16); this risk gradually increased, reaching an HR of 
5.62 (95% CI, 2.88–10.97) among those with >50 PYs. PYs 
had a linear dose-dependent relationship with SAH risk and 
a stronger association with the risk in women than in men 
(LRT P=0.08; Table 3). When we compared PY categories of 
current smokers with nonsmokers (by combining both quitter 
groups with never-smokers), we found even stronger evidence 
supporting the sex difference (LRT P=0.02).
Interactions
Because our analysis revealed multiplicative interactions 
between CPD and sex, and between PYs and sex, we included 
these interaction terms in a fully adjusted models. In these mod-
els, female sex was no longer an independent risk factor for SAH 
(CPD-model: HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.86–1.62] and PY-model: 
HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.82–1.34]). Moreover, an adjusted model 
(with all categorical variables) including only never-smokers 
(effects of smoking excluded) showed that female sex was not 
an independent risk factor (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.85–1.67]). In 
addition, we found some evidence of an additive interaction 
between sex and smoking; in the 11 to 20 and 21 to 30 CPD 
categories, the relative excess risk because of interactions were 
2.11 and 6.90 (Figure 2). To conduct analyses similar to those in

 Lindbohm et al  Sex, Smoking, and Risk for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage   1977
previous prospective studies,1–3 which found female sex to be an 
independent risk factor for SAH, we combined all CPD groups 
into a current smokers group and compared this group to never-
smokers. In this fully adjusted model, we found only weak evi-
dence of multiplicative interaction (P=0.16) and small additive 
interaction (relative excess risk because of interaction=0.94), 
as expected. Moreover, female sex emerged again as an inde-
pendent risk factor with an HR of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.18–1.75), 
and multiplicative interaction was no longer evident. Similarly, 
when we divided the categorical systolic blood pressure variable 
into 2 groups: normotensives and hypertensives, the adjusted 
model found no interactions between sex and smoking, and 
female sex emerged again as a risk factor, with an HR of 1.33 
(95% CI, 1.07–1.65). We found no other strong multiplicative 
or additive effect modifications or interactions between any risk 
factors mentioned in this study.
Smoking rates by sex may differ between older and more 
recent cohorts, which may in part explain the effect modifica-
tion. We thus performed an analysis of only the more recent 
cohorts between 1982 and 2007, but the results remained 
the same. Moreover, the results remained the same in all age 
groups with a reasonable number of participants.

Sudden Deaths From SAH
An adjusted model including only sudden deaths from SAH 
showed an increased risk in each CPD category when com-
pared with those for hospitalized SAH patients (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). This model suggested that all 
CPD categories elevated the risk of sudden death from SAH 
more in women than in men (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Discussion
Our results suggest that female sex may not be an independent 
risk factor for SAH, challenging the current understanding of 
SAH epidemiology. We found that multiplicative and addi-
tive effect modification19 between sex and CPD may explain 
why previous prospective studies2,3,20,21 find female sex to be 
an independent risk factor for SAH. In other words, if cumu-
lative doses of smoking are not taken into account by sex, 
categorical analyses may suggest that female sex is a strong 
risk factor for SAH. We found no other strong multiplicative 
or additive effect modifications or interactions between any 
risk factor mentioned in this study. Furthermore, our results 
confirm retrospective case–control study findings4,6,7 that sug-
gest that smoking is a dose-dependent risk factor for SAH. 
Even though smoking seems to affect the risk particularly in 
women, it is important to recognize that the dose-dependent 
association exists in both sexes and in former and current 
smokers. Even light smoking (1–10 CPD) elevated the risk 
for SAH, and this risk increased rapidly after only 0.05 to 5 
PYs in both men and women. The risk was lower among for-
mer smokers in both sexes, suggesting that smoking cessation 
reduces risk. Because of difference in smoking prevalence by 
sex, however, population attributable risk estimate was the 
same for both sexes. The results were same in all age groups 
with reasonable number of participants.

Given that retrospective6,22–29 and many prospective21,30–34 
risk factor studies do not include in their analyses sudden 
deaths from SAH, we also looked into whether such a selec-
tion bias could confound the results of risk factor studies. 
According to our data, smokers have an increased risk of sud-
den death from SAH, and this risk may be particularly high in 
female smokers. Because ≈20% of SAH patients die before 
hospitalization,9 and these patients may have the worst risk 
factor profiles, risk factor studies excluding sudden deaths 
may be somewhat unreliable. Finally, we found no interac-
tions between other SAH risk factors, suggesting that, in risk 
factor studies, these are independent and important to take 
into account.
Our observation of decreasing risk for SAH among former 
smokers is in line with findings of retrospective studies,4,6 
which suggest that risk decreases rapidly among those who 
have quit recently (within 1 year) and continues to decrease, 
reaching the risk level of never-smokers within 5 years. The 
same studies4,6 have reported that even light smoking leads to 
an increased risk for SAH. Our results are in accordance with 
this. Moreover, our findings agree with other cardiovascular 
disease study findings, suggesting that smoking has a dose-
dependent association with risk for acute myocardial infarc-
tion35 and stroke36 and that risk decreases considerably after 
smoking cessation.35,37 Our findings are also in line with find-
ings on myocardial infarction showing an effect modification 
between smoking and sex.38,39
Biological mechanisms for the deleterious effects of smok-
ing on women are unknown, but it is possible that smoking 
reduces estrogen levels, which further leads to collagen deple-
tion, inflammation, and dysfunction of mural cells in vessel 
walls.40 This cascade is the main event in a tendency for vessel 
walls to degrade.41,42 Early menopause with an early additional 
decrease in estrogen levels is more common among smok-
ers,43,44 and this may further associate in middle-aged female 
smokers with the formation and rupture of intracranial aneu-
rysms. In line with this reasoning, large prospective studies 
have reported that the risk for SAH in women surpasses the 
risk in men after 55 years of age.2,21
The strengths of our study include, to our knowledge, the 
following: the longest follow-up—40 years—among cardio-
vascular risk factor studies,8 the highest number of first-ever 
SAHs among prospective SAH risk factor studies, a prospec-
tive set-up reducing risk for information bias and reverse cau-
sality, a population-based cohort including sudden deaths from 
SAH, detailed data on smoking that allow reliable subgroup 
analyses, and accurate SAH diagnosis.45 These factors enabled 
us to calculate the additive interactions preferred in describing 
biological interactions,17,46 and thereafter, our results indicated 
that smoking is more hazardous to women.
However, our study also has limitations. First, because of 
the study design, we do not know how the participants’ smok-
ing patterns evolved during the period after the baseline sur-
vey. Although smoking habits are quite stable, during a long 
follow-up, about half of all smokers will quit, as based on a 
birth-cohort analysis.47 This, however, only should weaken 
the associations between SAH and CPD and between SAH 
and PYs. The same applies to associations between sex and 
CPD and between sex and PYs. Second, we could not include 
alcohol consumption in our final adjusted model because of 
the small number of never-smokers with high alcohol con-
sumption, as we have reported earlier.2 Nevertheless, the asso-
ciations of CPD and PYs with SAH remained essentially the 
same whether or not alcohol consumption was included in 
the adjusted model. Moreover, because socioeconomic sta-
tus relates to smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and other 
cardiovascular disease risk factors,48,49 as well as SAHs,50 we 
also included in our analysis socioeconomic status as years of 
education. This adjustment, however, did not change the asso-
ciations or effect modifications significantly, so we excluded 
it from the final model. Third, we could not take into account 
medication for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. This 
could theoretically affect interactions between other risk fac-
tors but would be unlikely to change the effect modification 
observed between sex and smoking. Finally, the external valid-
ity of Finnish studies is sometimes questioned, as the incidence 
of SAH is believed to be exceptionally high in Finland.51–54 
For example, the latest pooled risk analysis, the PHASES risk 
prediction model,52 does not predict 5-year risk of aneurysm 
rupture reliably, as discussed recently.55 After pooling previ-
ous studies, the authors concluded that incidence of SAH is 
higher in Finland than in other western countries.52 Thus, these 
authors excluded Finnish cohorts from the final risk predic-
tion model, which was based on only 2 studies, namely, the 
highly selected International Study of Unruptured Intracranial 
Aneurysms (ISUIA)56 with 59 SAH patients and a Dutch 
study57 with only 1 patient with SAH. However, a recent opin-
ion article in Nature Reviews Neurology55 suggested that the 
incidence of SAH in Finland is similar to that in other coun-
tries, which, as in Finland, also include sudden deaths in their 
incidence estimates. In fact, the first study on the nationwide 
(not only population-based) incidence of SAH in Finland, 
which identified 6885 incident SAHs during 79 083 579 cumu-
lative person-years, confirmed recently that the Finnish inci-
dence rate of SAH is not exceptional, when compared with 
incidences that include sudden SAH deaths outside hospitals.58 
This indicates that our results are perhaps generalizable.

pared with men in the same CPD group. Increase in RERI shown 
on the y axis by CPD group in women when compared with men 
(P values 0.06, 0.02, and 0.08). The model is adjusted for age, 
body mass index, cholesterol, CPD, systolic blood pressure,  
sex, study year, and area. Corresponding attributable proportion 
values are 0.39 (P=0.02), 0.47 (P<0.0001), and 0.69 (P<0.0001) 
and synergy index values are 2.18 (P=0.10), 2.58 (P=0.01), and 
4.36 (0.006).

Conclusions
Our results suggest that smoking is an important dose-depen-
dent risk factor for SAH and has a stronger association with 
this risk in women. This effect modification seems to explain 
why previous studies report female sex as an independent 
risk factor for SAH. The results emphasize the importance of 
worldwide smoking cessation agendas and active treatment of 
nicotine dependence.
