IMPORTANCE Differences in utilization and costs of end-of-life care among developed
countries are of considerable policy interest.
OBJECTIVE To compare site of death, health care utilization, and hospital expenditures in 7
countries: Belgium, Canada, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United
States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using administrative and
registry data from 2010. Participants were decedents older than 65 years who died with
cancer. Secondary analyses included decedents of any age, decedents older than 65 years
with lung cancer, and decedents older than 65 years in the United States and Germany from
2012.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Deaths in acute care hospitals, 3 inpatient measures
(hospitalizations in acute care hospitals, admissions to intensive care units, and emergency
department visits), 1 outpatient measure (chemotherapy episodes), and hospital
expenditures paid by insurers (commercial or governmental) during the 180-day and 30-day
periods before death. Expenditures were derived from country-specific methods for costing
inpatient services.
RESULTS The United States (cohort of decedents aged >65 years, N = 211 816) and the
Netherlands (N = 7216) had the lowest proportion of decedents die in acute care hospitals
(22.2.% and 29.4%, respectively). A higher proportion of decedents died in acute care
hospitals in Belgium (N = 21 054; 51.2%), Canada (N = 20 818; 52.1%), England (N = 97 099;
41.7%), Germany (N = 24 434; 38.3%), and Norway (N = 6636; 44.7%). In the last 180 days
of life, 40.3% of US decedents had an intensive care unit admission compared with less than
18% in other reporting nations. In the last 180 days of life, mean per capita hospital
expenditures were higher in Canada (US $21 840), Norway (US $19 783), and the United
States (US $18 500), intermediate in Germany (US $16 221) and Belgium (US $15 699), and
lower in the Netherlands (US $10 936) and England (US $9342). Secondary analyses showed
similar results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients older than 65 years who died with cancer in 7
developed countries in 2010, end-of-life care was more hospital-centric in Belgium, Canada,
England, Germany, and Norway than in the Netherlands or the United States. Hospital
expenditures near the end of life were higher in the United States, Norway, and Canada,
intermediate in Germany and Belgium, and lower in the Netherlands and England. However,
intensive care unit admissions were more than twice as common in the United States as in
other countries.

D
ifferences in utilization and costs of end-of-life care
among developed countries are of considerable policy
interest despite scarce data to inform international
comparisons. In the United States, end-of-life care is consid-
ered resource intensive, expensive, and insufficiently atten-
tive to patients’needs and wishes.1 Two decades ago, the ma-
jority of deaths due to terminal illness were reported to occur
in the hospital.2 More than a quarter of the Medicare budget,
which pays for the health care of Americans aged 65 years or
older, is devoted to the care of beneficiaries who die in that
year.3,4 Other developed nations spend less than the United
States on health care, a finding some attribute to lower-
intensity care at the end of life.5,6 Simultaneously, irrespec-
tive of nation of origin, there appears to be a disconnect be-
tween patients’stated preferences for dying at home and
actually dying in the hospital.7-9
Challenges with end-of-life care are not new, and many ef-
forts have been made to improve care.1,6,10 Yet few research
efforts have directly compared end-of-life care among devel-
oped countries. Limited prior studies have yielded conflict-
ing findings: some suggest that patterns of care among devel-
oped countries may not differ11,12; others found considerable
variation in end-of-life care among countries.13
To address an essential knowledge gap in cross-national
end-of-life research, we formed the International Consor-
tium for End-of-Life Research (ICELR). We aimed to conduct
a systematic examination of patterns of care, health care uti-
lization, and expenditures among patients dying in 7 devel-
oped countries. We focused on cancer because it is the sec-
ond leading cause of death, accounting for more than 20% of
deaths in most developed countries,14 is identifiable in regis-
try or administrative claims data, and is among the most
resource-intensive illnesses.15
Methods
Study Design and Data Sources
We conducted a retrospective observational study of persons
dying with cancer in 2010 using administrative claims or reg-
istry data sets from 7 developed nations, Belgium, Canada, En-
gland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United
States (Table 1). These nations were selected because they had
diverse modes of health care financing and delivery and avail-
able high-quality sources of administrative claims and regis-
try data. Investigators in 2 other developed nations were
approached but were unable to provide data.
The research was approved by institutional review boards
with waivers of consent at the University of Pennsylvania and
Dartmouth College (United States), at Sunnybrook Health Sci-
ences Center (Canada), and through the Regional Commit-
tees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (Norway). In other
countries, the research did not require institutional review
board approval because anonymized data was used in Ger-
many (based on section 75 of the German Social Code Book V)
andEngland(basedonalicensetoreuseanonymizeddatawith
permission of the Health and Social Care Information Center;
reference NIC-152151-PD4PG); because the study did not in-
volve an intervention and posthumous anonymized data was
used in the Netherlands (based on guidance from the Central
Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects and the
Dutch Personal Data Protection Act); and because the Inter-
Mutualist Agency (through the Programme Law of December
24, 2002) and the Belgian Cancer Registry (through the Law
of December 13, 2006, article 39) have statutory authority to
undertake the analyses conducted for the study in Belgium
without institutional review board approval.
Identification of Decedents With Cancer
The identification of study cohorts followed prior methods
used in each participating country.16-22 We identified dece-
dents between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010, who
had a diagnosis of cancer documented within 180 days
before death. In Canada, England, Germany, the Nether-
lands, and the United States, cancers were identified in
administrative data through International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes, excluding neoplasms of the
skin.23 In the Netherlands, ICD-9/10 codes were translated into
diagnosis-treatmentcombinationscapturedwithintheAchmea
Health Database. In Norway, ICD-9/10 codes were translated
into diagnosis related groups captured within the Norwegian
Patient Register. In Belgium, an analogous set of cancers were
identified from the Belgium Cancer Registry, allowing for iden-
tificationofcorrespondingpersonsinthenationalhealthclaims
database of the InterMutualist Agency. The US data set was
restricted to decedents older than 65 years in fee-for-service
Medicare; other data sets covered all ages.
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics of patients included sex, age, and can-
cerdiagnosis.Patientswithmultiplecancerswereclassifiedinto
mutually exclusive primary cancer diagnoses according to a
hierarchy:lung,hematologic,colon,breast,prostate,andother.
Site of Death, Health Care Utilization,
and Hospital Expenditures
We examined site of death by determining whether dece-
dents died in an acute care hospital. We examined health care
utilization by assessing 3 inpatient measures (hospitaliza-
tions in acute care hospitals, admissions to intensive care units
[ICUs], and emergency department visits) and 1 outpatient
measure (chemotherapy episodes).24-26
We defined acute care hospitals as hospitals that provide
inpatient care for acute medical conditions or surgery, exclud-
ing skilled nursing facilities, long-term care facilities, or reha-
bilitation hospitals. In secondary analyses of site of death in
the United States, where health policies have promoted pa-
tient transfers from acute care hospitals to skilled nursing fa-
cilities, we also examined deaths in skilled nursing facilities
(similardatawerenotavailableorcomparableinothernations).
We defined ICUs within acute care hospitals as special-
ized units for the purposes of critical care with a high staff-to-
patient ratio, acknowledging heterogeneity among countries
in the definition of critical care beds.27 We identified other in-

patient and outpatient measures based on prior methods tai-
lored to each country-specific data set. Data on ICU admis-
sions were not available from Norway and England, and data
on emergency department visits were not available from the
Netherlands or Norway.
We examined health care expenditures paid by insurers
(commercial or governmental) in each country. To report the
mostsimilarhealthcareexpendituresamongcountries,wecal-
culated health care expenditures associated with acute care
hospital admissions (“hospital expenditures”), excluding out-
patient, hospice, and other indirect medical expenditures.

turesaredescribedineTable1intheSupplement.Ineachcoun-
try, hospital expenditures accounted for the largest propor-
tionoftotalhealthcareexpendituresandend-of-lifecarecosts.
In the 6 non-US nations, physician costs were part of hospital
admissions and thus included in hospital expenditures.
In the United States, physician costs associated with hos-
pital admissions were reimbursed separately from hospital ad-
missionsthroughtheMedicarePartBprogram.28ForUSexpen-
ditures, we estimate that Medicare Part B expenditures during

Observation Periods
We determined health care utilization and hospital expendi-
tures during the 180-day and 30-day periods before death. We
included hospitalizations and expenditures if the initial date
or date of admission occurred within the observation periods
and excluded those that began before but extended into the
observation periods.
Analyses
We calculated descriptive statistics for each country’
s sample
and report unadjusted results, drawing from the balance sheet
model for integrating and interpreting evidence.30 Regula-
tory and data restrictions did not allow combining patient-
level observations across national data sets, thereby preclud-
ing adjusted comparisons of outcomes among nations.

tries, although Germany had a higher and the Netherlands a
lower proportion of female decedents (Table 2). In all coun-
tries but Germany, the largest proportion of decedents were
diagnosed as having lung cancer. The United States had a dis-
proportionately high rate of decedents with prostate cancer.31
Site of Death
In Belgium (cohort of decedents >65 years, N = 21 054; death
in acute care hospital, 51.2%), Canada (N = 20 818; 52.1%),
England(N = 97099;41.7%),Germany(N = 24434;38.3%),and
Norway(N = 6636;44.7%),ahighproportionofdecedentsdied
in acute care hospitals. In comparison, 29.4% of decedents in
the Netherlands (N = 7216) and 22.2% of decedents in the
UnitedStates(N = 211 816)diedinacutecarehospitals(Table3).
In the United States, 29.5% of decedents died in acute care
hospitals or skilled nursing facilities.
Inpatient Health Care Utilization
In the last 180 days of life, between 82.6% and 88.7% of de-
cedents were hospitalized in Belgium, Canada, England, and
Norway, while less than 77% were hospitalized in Germany,
the Netherlands, and the United States (Table 3). In the last 180
days, the United States had the fewest mean per capita hos-
pital days (10.7 [SD, 14.0] days) while Belgium (mean, 27.7 [SD,
27.4] days) and Norway (mean, 24.8 [SD, 12.8] days) had the
highest mean per capita hospital days. Germany (mean, 21.7
[SD, 25.0] days), Canada (mean, 19.0 [SD, 21.5] days), En-
gland (mean, 18.3 [SD, 20.7] days), and the Netherlands (mean,
17.8 [SD, 24.9] days) had intermediate per capita hospital days.
Despite having the second lowest hospitalization rate,
40.3% of US cancer decedents had an ICU admission in the last
180 days compared with less than 18% in other reporting coun-
tries (Table 3). Similarly, the mean per capita ICU days in the
last 180 days of life in the United States was 3.6 days, while it
was less than 1.5 days in other reporting countries.
In the last 30 days of life, England, Belgium, Canada, Nor-
way, and the United States had intermediate rates of hospital-
ization(rangingfrom49.0%to62.6%),whileGermany(44.8%)
and the Netherlands (43.2%) had lower hospitalization rates
(Table3).Belgiumhadahighermeanpercapitanumberofhos-
pitaldays(10.6[SD,10.4]days),whilethoseinGermany(mean,
5.0 [SD, 7.4] days), England (mean, 5.0 [SD, 7.4] days), and the
United States (mean, 5.0 [SD, 8.4] days) were lower. How-
ever, in the last 30 days of life, 27.2% of US decedents had an
ICU admission while 11.0% of decedents or less did in other
reporting countries. Similarly, US decedents had a mean of 2.0
(SD, 5.5) ICU days compared with less than 1.0 for other re-
porting countries (Table 3). England and Norway did not
report ICU utilization.
Chemotherapy Utilization
In the last 180 days of life, 38.7% in the United States, 33.0%
of patients in Belgium, 29.1% in Canada, and 28.2% in Ger-
many received chemotherapy at least once, while the rate was
23.7% in Norway and 18.1% in the Netherlands (Table 3). In the
last 30 days of life, Belgium (12.7%), United States (10.6%), the
Netherlands(10.6%),Germany(10.5%),andCanada(8.8%)had
higher chemotherapy utilization while Norway (4.8%) had
lower chemotherapy utilization (Table 3). England did not re-
port chemotherapy utilization.
Hospital Expenditures
In the last 180 days of life, mean per capita hospital expendi-
tures were higher in Canada (US $21 840), Norway (US $19 783),
and the United States (US $18 500) (Table 3). Mean per capita
hospital expenditures were intermediate in Germany (US
$16 221) and Belgium (US $15 699) and lower in the Nether-

In the last 30 days of life, mean per capita hospital expen-
ditures were highest in Canada (US $10 273), the United States
(US $8126), and Norway (US $6625), intermediate in Belgium
(US $5840) and Germany (US $4382), and lower in the Neth-
erlands (US $3680) and England (US $3160). Mean hospital ex-
penditures per day were highest in Canada (US $1712) and the
United States (US $1625), intermediate in Norway (US $946)
and Germany (US $876), and lower in England (US $632), Bel-
gium (US $551), and the Netherlands (US $497).
Physician expenditures were included in non-US hospi-
tal expenditures but were excluded from US hospital expen-
ditures. If Medicare Part B expenditures, which include phy-
sician costs, were included in US hospital expenditures during
the period of hospital admissions, we estimate that US hospi-
tal expenditures could be an average of 11.5% higher (eFigure
in the Supplement).
Analysis of Decedents of Any Age
We conducted similar analyses of decedents of any age from
the 6 non-US countries (Belgium, Canada, England, Ger-
many, the Netherlands, and Norway) that could report find-

and 54.1% of decedents died in acute care hospitals. Con-
versely, in the Netherlands, 29.4% died in acute care hospi-

cer decedents older than 65 years from the 6 countries that
could identify them, Canada, England, Germany, the Nether-
lands, Norway, and the United States. The comparative pat-
terns in acute care hospital deaths, hospitalization rates, ICU
rates, expenditures, and other outcomes were consistent with
other analyses (Table 5).
Analysis of Decedents Older Than 65 Years in 2012
To examine temporal patterns, we analyzed decedents older
than 65 years from the 2 countries that could provide more re-
cent data, Germany and the United States. In these 2 nations,
thecomparativepatternswerealsoconsistentwithotheranaly-
ses (Table 6).
Discussion
This is the first international comparative study to our knowl-
edge of site of death, health care utilization, and hospital ex-
penditures at the end of life. All 7 nations had high rates of hos-
pital admissions and hospital days near the end of life. The
UnitedStateshadthelowestproportionofdecedentswithcan-
cer dying in acute care hospitals. Norway and England had
higherratesofin-hospitaldeaths,hospitaladmissions,andhos-
pital days, and Norway had among the highest hospital ex-
penditures but England had among the lowest. We found simi-
lar patterns in the larger cohort of decedents of any age and
themorehomogeneouscohortofdecedentsolderthan65years
with lung cancer, suggesting that the differences observed are
likely driven more by end-of-life care practices and organiza-
tionratherthandifferencesincohortidentification.Fourpoints
are worth emphasizing.
First, 3 broad patterns of end-of-life care emerged in the
7 countries we examined (Figure). Decedents in Belgium,
Canada, Germany, and Norway received more hospital-
centric care with correspondingly high expenditures for hos-
pitalizations, where hospital-centric implies higher rates of
death in acute care hospitals and other measures of inpatient
utilization.End-of-lifecareinEnglandwashospital-centricbut
at a lower cost. Decedents in the United States and the Neth-
erlands received care in acute care hospitals less often and for
fewer days, although hospital expenditures near the end of life
in the United States were higher (commensurate with expen-
ditures in Canada and Norway), while hospital expenditures
in the Netherlands were lower. However, even among na-
tions with lower rates of deaths in acute care hospitals, 4 in
10 decedents with cancer were admitted to acute care
hospitals for an average of 5 days in the last 30 days of life.
Second, the United States had the lowest proportion of pa-
tients dying in the hospital. Only 22.5% of US decedents older
than 65 years with cancer died in acute care hospitals (29.5%
died in acute care hospitals or skilled nursing facilities). Death
in US acute care hospitals has declined considerably,32,33 and
in 2010, death in the hospital was half of most other coun-
tries studied. The Netherlands also had lower acute care hos-
pital deaths, consistent with explicit policies in the Nether-
landsthatpromotetheprovisionofgeneralist-ledpalliativeand
home care.34 Dying in the hospital is often viewed nega-
tively; surveys consistently suggest that people would like to
be at home among family and loved ones when they die.7,35,36
Thisdifferencemayreflectdifferencesininfrastructureand
the cost of hospital-based care. Deaths not occurring in acute
care hospitals may occur at other health care facilities rather
than at home, such as skilled nursing facilities.32 The United
States also has more than 5300 hospices, and two-thirds of
themprovidehome-basedcare.37Inaddition,theUnitedStates
had a higher per-day hospital cost compared with other de-
veloped countries. The economic pressure to find alterna-
tives to hospitalization near the end of life may be less in other
countries, and national health care systems may have under-
developed end-of-life alternatives to hospitalization like hos-
pice, home, and palliative care. Nonetheless, the Nether-
lands was distinguished by lower hospital utilization rates and
lower hospital expenditures, suggesting that economic pres-
sures may be only 1 contributing factor to promoting
nonhospital end-of-life care alternatives.
The lower rates of acute care hospital admissions, length
ofstay,andin-hospitaldeathsintheUnitedStatesandtheNeth-
erlands suggest that end-of-life care can evolve to reflect pa-
tient preferences and goals about site of death irrespective of
health system (Table 1).1,10,32,35 In the early 1980s, more than
70% of US cancer patients died in hospital.33 Over the last 30
years,recognitionofpreferencesforhome-basedend-of-lifecare
and patients’rights to refuse medical interventions and eco-
nomic pressures to lower end-of-life costs and expand hospice
use have all played an important role in advancing end-of-life
care.1,35,38 Yet excessive utilization of high-intensity care near
the end of life, particularly in the United States relative to other
developed countries, underscores the need for continued
progress to improve end-of-life care practices.

Physician costs associated with hospital admissions are included in mean
hospital expenditures reported for the 6 non-US nations. United States
expenditures shown are an underestimate because physician costs are not
included; in the United States, it is estimated that Medicare Part B, which
includes physician costs, adds an average of 11.5% in expenditures to mean
hospital expenditures. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

Third, the United States was prominent in its use of ex-
pensive, resource-intense services at the end of life. While the
United States had a comparatively low rate of hospital deaths
and hospitalizations and shorter hospital stays, 40% of all de-
cedents were admitted to the ICU in the last 180 days and 27%
in the last 30 days of life, more than twice the rate of other
countries. Days spent in the ICU in the United States were also
more than twice the corresponding numbers in other coun-
tries. These high rates of ICU use extended to the more homo-
geneous cohort of lung cancer patients older than 65 years.
Similarly, the United States had higher rates of chemo-
therapy use at the end of life, second only to Belgium.

Fourth, this study collected a wide variety of data on dece-
dents across 7 developed countries. Cross-national compari-
sons are rare because of the difficulties in identifying consis-
tent cohorts and collecting comparable data on utilization and
costs. We were able to mitigate these challenges by focusing on
cancer decedents, validating findings from the general co-
horts on a more homogeneous cohort of patients older than 65
years with lung cancer, and examining a limited but important
set of measures of health care utilization that are available in
claims data, such as hospitalizations and ICU admissions.
This study has limitations. First, we identified decedents
dying with cancer rather than dying of cancer. This differen-
tial may reduce cancer severity in the United States because
of a higher incidence of prostate cancer cases31 and may bias
US health care utilization and costs downward. However, the
analysis of patients older than 65 years with lung cancer iden-
tified patterns consistent with those for the entire cancer co-
hort. This subset analysis restricted to a homogeneous pa-
tient population supports the internal validity of our findings.
Second, each country used disparate data sources that may
notbeentirelycomparable;moreover,thedatasourcesforsome
countries are samples that may not be representative of their
populations.Thus,ourfindingsarehypothesisgeneratingandnot
definitive.Third,healthandend-of-lifecarepaymentpoliciesand
financing differ among the nations and cohorts examined, and
theUScohortwasrestrictedtodecedentsinfee-for-serviceMedi-
care.Moreover,whilewerestrictedourdefinitionofexpenditures
to those associated with acute care hospital admissions, inevi-
tably there were differences in how hospital expenditures were
accountedforandintheexpendituresassociatedwithsimilarin-
patient services.39 For example, US hospital expenditures were
an underestimate in comparison with the 6 non-US nations be-
cause US hospital expenditures exclude physician costs; we es-
timatethatMedicarePartB,whichincludesphysiciancosts,adds
11.5%inexpenditures,onaverage,tooverallhealthexpenditures

videcomparativeinsightsintononhospitalhealthcareorexpen-
ditures.Fifth,wewereunabletoidentifycomparabledataacross
countries regarding use of hospice or palliative care services or
admissiontoothercarefacilitieslikeskillednursingfacilitiesor
nursing homes. Sixth, the data sources used did not allow us to
evaluate differences in quality of care or patient-reported out-
comes. Our findings and the limitations highlight the need for
greatercross-nationalcomparisonsofend-of-lifecareusingpro-
spectively designed quality and cost metrics.
Conclusions
Among patients older than 65 years who died with cancer in 7
developed countries in 2010, end-of-life care was more hos-
pital-centric in Belgium, Canada, England, Germany, and Nor-
way than in the Netherlands or the United States. Hospital ex-
pendituresneartheendoflifewerehigherintheUnitedStates,
Norway, and Canada, intermediate in Germany and Belgium,
and lower in the Netherlands and England. However, ICU ad-
missionsweremorethantwiceascommonintheUnitedStates
