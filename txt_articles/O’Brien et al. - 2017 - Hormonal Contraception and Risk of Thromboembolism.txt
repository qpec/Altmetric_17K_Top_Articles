 Hormonal Contraception and Risk
of Thromboembolism in Women
With Diabetes
Diabetes Care 2017;40:233–238 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1534
OBJECTIVE
To investigate safety of hormonal contraception with regard to thromboembolic
events in women with type 1 or 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We used data from 2002–2011 in Clinformatics Data Mart to identify women in the
U.S., 14–44 years of age, with an ICD-9-CM code for diabetes and a prescription
for a diabetic medication or device. We examined contraceptive claims and com-
pared time to thromboembolism (venous thrombosis, stroke, or myocardial in-
farction) among women with diabetes dispensed hormonal contraception using a
modification of Cox regression to control for age, smoking, obesity, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetic complications, and history of cancer; we excluded data
for 3 months after women gave birth.
RESULTS
We identified 146,080 women with diabetes who experienced 3,012 thromboem-
bolic events. Only 28% of reproductive-aged women with diabetes had any claims for
hormonal contraception, with the majority receiving estrogen-containing oral con-
traceptives. Rates of thromboembolism were highest among women who used the
contraceptive patch (16 per 1,000 woman-years) and lowest among women who
usedintrauterine(3.4per1,000woman-years)andsubdermal(0per163woman-years)
contraceptives. Compared with use of intrauterine contraception, progestin-only in-
jectable contraception was associated with increased risk of thromboembolism
(12.5 per 1,000 woman-years; adjusted hazard ratio 4.69 [95% CI 2.51–8.77]).
CONCLUSIONS
The absolute risk of thromboembolism among women with type 1 or 2 diabetes
using hormonal contraception is low. Highly effective, intrauterine and subdermal
contraceptives are excellent options for women with diabetes who hope to avoid
the teratogenic effects of hyperglycemia by carefully planning their pregnancies.
It is estimated that 2% of women in the U.S. between the ages of 20 and 39 years
have diabetes (1). Because birth defects affect 5–8% of pregnancies conceived by
women with diabetes, over twice the rate of the general population, preconception
counseling is particularly important. Planning pregnancies allows for tight glycemic
control before and during pregnancy, thus decreasing congenital malformations and
fetal macrosomia (2). However, nearly two-thirds of pregnancies in women with
diabetes are unplanned (3,4), and women with diabetes are less likely to receive
contraceptive counseling or use contraception than women without diabetes (5–9).

EPIDEMIOLOGY/HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
 One concern with prescribing hor-
monal contraception to women with di-
abetes is the risk of thromboembolic
complications, in particular cardiovascu-
lar disease and stroke. Prior epidemio-
logic studies suggest that combined
hormonal contraception influences the
risk of thromboembolism to the same
extent in women with and without di-
abetes, but the absolute risk of throm-
boembolism is higher in those with
diabetes because of the increased spon-
taneous incidence of thromboembolism
in these patients (10,11). In a 15-year
Danish historical cohort study, the rela-
tive risk of stroke and myocardial in-
farction (MI) among women who filled
prescriptions for medications to treat di-
abetes, as compared with women with-
out such prescriptions, was 2.73 for
stroke (95% CI 2.32–3.22) and 4.66 for
MI (95% CI 3.88–5.61) (12).
For women with medical conditions
that increase their baseline risk of throm-
boembolism, such as women with ad-
vanced diabetes, or women with diabetes
and other cardiovascular risk factors,
progestin-only contraceptives are rec-
ommended by the World Health Orga-
nization (13). However, the majority of
published studies regarding progestin-
only contraception and thromboembo-
lism have included only healthy women
(14). This gap in evidence may be con-
tributing to lower rates of contraceptive
counseling, prescriptions, or services for
women with diabetes as compared with
women without a chronic medical con-
dition (15).
In a recent systematic review, most
progestin-only contraceptives were not
associated with increased odds of venous
or arterial thrombotic events (14). How-
ever, even in the few studies in which
women with diabetes were included,
sample sizes were small, and women
with diabetes were not analyzed sepa-
rately. Our study, therefore, used a large
administrative health care claims data-
set to investigate dispensing of prescrip-
tion contraception to women with type 1
and type 2 diabetes and subsequent
thromboembolic outcomes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data Source
The Clinformatics Data Mart is an admin-
istrative health claims database encom-
passing 15 million individuals annually
from all 50 states. Over a 10-year period,
47 million unique individuals contributed
information to the database. Clinformatics
is composed primarily of commercial
health plan data and contains medical
claims, outpatient pharmacy claims, labo-
ratory results, hospitalizations, standard
pricing, coverage dates for members, and
demographic information. Inpatient and
outpatient services are coded with Current
Procedural Terminology codes or Health-
care Common Procedure Coding System
codes. Diagnoses are coded with ICD-
9-CM diagnoses codes. All claims include
the dates of service. Outpatient pharmacy
data include National Drug Codes, drug
brand names, genericclassifications, quan-
tity, days supplied, and date dispensed. In-
patient drugs are not included.
Study Population
We examined claims from 2002 to 2011
for females of reproductive age (14–44
years) who had at least one ICD-9 code
for diabetes (250.xx) and a prescription
for a diabetic medication or device. A list
of diabetic medications and devices was
developed by a board-certified internist
based on medications/devices/supplies
contained in the Clinformatics data set.
Advanced diabetes, a covariate of interest,
was defined as at least one ICD-9 code
indicating nephropathy (250.4x), retino-
pathy (250.5x), neuropathy (250.6x), or
macrovascular disease (250.7x). We calcu-
lated a Charlson Comorbidity Index for
each participant using modified code
from the Manitoba Center for Health
Policy (16). The majority of the diagnoses
listed in the Clinformatics database ex-
tended to the fourth or fifth digit, allow-
ing the comorbidity index to produce
reliable results.
Age at entry was based on a woman’s
first ICD-9 code for diabetes or prescrip-
tion for a diabetic medication. However,
if an individual was ,14 years of age at the
time of first ICD-9 code for diabetes, she
was not included in the cohort until she
turned 14 years of age. Likewise, women
were excluded from the cohort once they
turned 45 years of age. Observation time
wascalculatedusingeligibilitydates.When
women had multiple enrollment periods
(because of changes or lapses in health in-
surance coverage), the period of longest
enrollment was selected for inclusion.
Outcomes of Interest
The primary objective of this study was
to compare time to thromboembolism
among women dispensed progestin-
only, combination, or no hormonal con-
traception. As our goal was to examine
the safety of available contraceptives
for women with type 1 and type 2 di-
abetes, we restricted this analysis to
women with new thromboembolic
events. New diagnoses of MI (ICD-9-CM
410.xx and 412) or stroke (ICD-9-CM 433.
xx–436.xx, 437.6, 438.xx, and 671.5) had
to be associated with a hospital admis-
sion. In addition, participants identified
as having suffered a venous thromboem-
bolism, whether that was a deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism,
were required to have been dispensed
an anticoagulant within 30 days of
the service date indicated by the
relevant ICD-9 code for the throm-
boembolism. Other health conditions
considered to be potential confounders
included hyperlipidemia (272.0–272.4),
hypertension (401.x–405.x), cancer
(140.x–172.x, 174.x–195.8x, and 200.
x–208.x), smoking (305.1 and 649.0–
649.04), and obesity (278.00–278.01).
Women with ICD-9 codes indicating
pregnancy or a postpartum state were
removed from analysis from the time of
first pregnancy code until 3 months af-
ter any diagnostic or procedure code
consistent with infant delivery.
Hormonal Contraception
Hormonal contraception was stratified
by type (combined oral contraceptives,
transdermal patch, vaginal ring, progestin-
only pills, injection, subcutaneous implant,
or intrauterine device [IUD]), type of
progestin (categorized as desogestrel/
gestodene, drospirenone, or levonorges-
trel/other), and estrogen dose ($30
or ,30 mg). Duration of contraception
use was calculated in woman-years. This
allowed fluidity among the groups so
that a woman using more than one type
of hormonal birth control over the time of
her participation in the cohort could be
included inmultiplecontraceptivegroups.
Length of time on each hormonal con-
traceptive was determined by using the
Medication History Estimator (MHE) pro-
gram (17). The MHE uses eligibility data in
parallel with the pharmacy claims data to
construct a consecutive timeline of speci-
fied medications for each individual in the
cohort. Based on prescription fill dates and
days supply dispensed, the MHE searches
pharmacy records for recurring fills of
specified medications and calculates the
total length of time an individual used
234

 each medication. A participant was consid-
ered to have discontinued contraceptive
use if 120 days (4 months) elapsed with-
out a refill for oral contraceptives, the
transdermal patch, or the vaginal ring.
The end of use of depot medroxyproges-
terone acetate (DMPA) was defined as
196 days (16 weeks) without a repeat in-
jection code. For contraceptive methods
that are primarily coded as procedures
(i.e., IUDs and subdermal implants), we
calculated length of use using placement,
surveillance, and/or removal codes.
Codes specifying the type of IUD (lev-
onorgestrel or copper-bearing) were not
frequently used by providers. Therefore,
we were unable to distinguish between
the two types of IUDs in our analyses,
and we conservatively assumed that all
IUDs were hormonal. If no removal codes
were detected following IUD or implant
placement, then we assumed that the
contraceptive was used as specified in
the package insert (3 years for implants
and 5 years for the IUD) while the patient
remained in the study cohort.
Statistical Analysis
In this longitudinal database, a woman’s
contraceptive exposure could change
over time. Thus, sequential time for
each exposure was calculated. Descriptive
statistics were calculated by exposure,
with individual women contributing var-
iable amounts of observation time to
each exposure. To calculate hazard ratios
(HRs) of thromboembolism by exposure
to a contraceptive, we used a modification
of Cox regression that allowed for time-
dependent covariates (i.e., changes in con-
traceptive use). Interactionsbetween birth
controlexposureandage,advanceddiabe-
tes (i.e., diabetes with nephropathy, reti-
nopathy, neuropathy, or macrovascular
disease), hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
cancer, obesity, and smoking were evalu-
ated in each model. An a of 0.010 and
biological rationale determined if models
stratified by the covariate were calculated.
All HRs were then adjusted for the follow-
ing covariates of interest: age, advanced
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
cancer, obesity, and smoking. In models
analyzing the association between specific
types of birth control and thromboembo-
lism, women who were not using the
methods of interest were dropped from
themodel.Ifawomanuseddifferenttypes
of hormonal contraception, only her time
receiving that specific type of contracep-
tion was included in the model. All analy-
ses were performed using SAS version 9.4.
We considered an a of 0.05 to indicate
statistical significance unless otherwise
noted.
RESULTS
We identified 146,080 unique women
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes between
14 and 44 years of age, of whom 25,590
(17.5%) had advanced diabetes. A sub-
stantial proportion of women treated
for diabetes had ICD-9 codes indicating
concurrent diagnoses of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and/or obesity (Table
1). However, the median Charlson Co-
morbidity Index of our study population
was only 2.0. In total, 478,650 woman-
years of observation were available for
women of reproductive age with diabetes.
Over the time period of study, the ma-
jority of women with diabetes (104,732;
72%) had no claims for hormonal contra-
ception devices or prescriptions. Approxi-
mately one-fourth (n = 35,361) of women
treated for diabetes were dispensed
estrogen-containing contraception, and
2,263 were dispensed both estrogen-
containing and progestin-only contracep-
tionduringthetimeperiodofstudy.Among
those who were dispensed estrogen-
containing contraception, most (83%; n =
29,319) had gaps in their use of prescrip-
tion contraception, leaving only 6,042

 (4%) who were dispensed enough contra-
ception to allow continuous use over their
entire period of observation. A minority of
women (4%; n = 5,987) were dispensed
purely progestin-only contraception, which
included pills, DMPA, an implant, or an IUD.
Among these women, 5,307 had gaps in
use,leaving680(0.5%)whoweredispensed
enough progestin-only contraception to
meet the definition of continuous use.
We identified 3,012 total thrombotic
events in our study population over a
total of 478,650 woman-years of obser-
vation, producing a rate of 6.3 throm-
botic events per 1,000 woman-years
of observation (95% CI 6.1–6.5 per
1,000 woman-years) (Table 1). Among
women with diabetes, arterial thrombo-
sis (2,015 out of 3,012; 67% of throm-
botic events) was more common than
venous thrombosis. Among women ex-
periencing arterial thrombosis, strokes
and transient ischemic attacks were
more common (1,238 out of 3,012;
41% of thrombotic events overall) than
MI (777 out of 3,012; 26% of events). We
found that when compared with use of
no hormonal contraception, estrogen-
containing products were associated
with an increased risk of thromboembo-
lism (HR 3.38 [95% CI 2.94–3.88] in
women ,35 years of age and 1.79
[1.54–2.09] in women $35 years of
age) (Table 2). When compared with
no hormonal contraception, progestin-
only products were associated with a
modestly increased risk of thromboem-
bolism in women ,35 years of age (2.02
[1.51–2.70]) but were not associated
with thromboembolism in older women.
When directly compared with each other,
the hazard of thromboembolism with
progestin-only contraception was lower
than for estrogen-containing contracep-
tion; this difference was statistically signif-
icant for women ,35 years of age (0.60
[0.44–0.81]) but not for older women
(0.74 [0.54–1.03]). The crude incidence
rate of thromboembolism among women
with diabetes using any type of hormonal
contraception was 9.5 per 1,000 woman-
years of use for women ,35 years of age
(95% CI 8.5–10.5) and 11.4 per 1,000
woman-yearsofuseforwomen$35 years
of age (10.0–13.0).
For women using combined hormonal
contraceptive pills, we compared risk of
thromboembolism by dose of estrogen
and type of progestin (Table 3). We
also compared progestin-only pills to
combined oral contraception and did not
find a difference in risk of thromboembo-
lism in this analysis (Table 3). We did not
find an increased risk of thromboembo-
lism in women using pills with $30 mg es-
trogen as compared with those receiving
“ultra–low-dose” pills. We also did notfind
an increased risk of thromboembolism
with pills containing drospirenone or des-
ogestrel/gestodene as compared with
other types of progestin. Although the
vast majority of estrogen-containing prod-
ucts were oral contraceptives, we also ex-
amined thromboembolic risk for the
transdermalpatch andvaginalringascom-
pared with combined oral contraceptives
and found a modestly increased risk of
thromboembolism for the transdermal
patch (1.68 [1.14–2.49]), but not the vag-
inal ring (Table 3).
When compared with use of an IUD for
contraception, progestin-only pills and
DMPA were associated with an approxi-
mately four times increased risk of throm-
bosis (Table 4). Women using DMPA did
tend to be older than IUD users and were
more likely to be smokers (data not
shown). However, these variables were
controlled for in our analysis. Nonetheless,
even amongDMPA andprogestin-only pill
users, the absolute number of thrombotic
events was low. The number of subder-
mal implantable progestin-only devices
(Implanon and Nexplanon; Merck) pre-
scribedwas very small, and nothrombotic
events were identified in this patient
population, precluding detailed analysis.
CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis of claims data from 146,080
commercially insured women with diabe-
tes found that the absolute risk of throm-
boembolism among women with type 1
and type 2 diabetes using hormonal con-
traception is low, with ,17 events per
1,000 woman-years of use independent
of type of contraceptive used. We also
found that arterial events were more com-
mon than venous thrombosis, accounting
for two-thirds of thromboembolic events.
All analyses were adjusted for patient age,
advanced diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyper-
tension, cancer, and smoking. The contra-
ceptives most likely to be associated with
thromboembolism were the contraceptive
patch and vaginal ring. The contraceptives
least likely to be associated with throm-
boembolism when used by women with
diabetes were the intrauterine and sub-
dermal contraceptives, although the

Contraception and Thromboembolism in Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 40, February 2017
 amount of woman-time with subdermal
contraceptives was very small. As these
highly effective reversible contracep-
tives are typically 20 times as effective
as oral contraceptives (18), they are ex-
cellent options for women with diabetes
who wish to avoid the teratogenic con-
sequences of hyperglycemia by carefully
planning their pregnancies. Unfortunately,
the large majority (72%) of women with
diabetes in this study received no prescrip-
tion contraception and may face greater
risk of undesired pregnancy than war-
ranted. Further, amongwomen prescribed
short-acting methods, the vast majority
had gaps in use.
As combined hormonal contraceptives,
which contain both estrogen and proges-
tin, are known to increase risk of thrombo-
embolism in the general population (19),
we were not surprised to find this to also
be true for women with type 1 and type 2
diabetes. Estrogen exerts a negative influ-
ence on the anticoagulant protein C path-
way and is likely the primary mechanism
for the prothrombotic effect of combined
hormonal contraceptives (20), as well as
postmenopausal hormones (21). Although
one recent French study reported that
women (,1% of whom had diabetes) us-
ing oral contraceptives with only 20 mg
estrogen were less likely to experience
pulmonary embolism, stroke, and MI
than those using products containing
30–40 mg estrogen, our study, like most
prior studies of the general population,
did not show that ultra–low-dose estro-
gen products were associated with a de-
creased risk of thromboembolism for
women with diabetes (22,23). We also
did not find an increased risk of throm-
boembolism with agents containing the
progestin types of desogestrel or dro-
spirenone, a finding that has been re-
ported in multiple other retrospective
studies, although not substantiated in
the prospective European Active Surveil-
lance study (22–24).
With regard to progestin-only contra-
ception, concern for a possible increased
risk of thromboembolism stems from re-
ports that higher-dose progestins used for
noncontraception purposes are associated
with venous thromboembolism (25,26). In
addition, an international study reported a
possible increase in stroke risk in women
with hypertension who used injectable
progestin-only contraceptives (27). Most
recently, a study from the Netherlands re-
ported that women using DMPA had a 3.6-
fold (1.8–7.1) increased risk of venous
thromboembolism compared with nonus-
ers of hormonal contraceptives (28). Our
work supports these findings, as we
identified a fourfold increased risk of
thromboembolism in women using pro-
gestin-only pills or DMPA when compared
with women with IUDs. Our findings may
underestimate the risk of progestin-only
pills, as postpartum women, the most
common users of these agents, were ex-
cludedfromallanalyses,leavingonly1,902
woman-years of use to analyze (29).
The primary strength of this work is the
data source, which provides access to
.100,000 women with diabetes, a patient
population that is often excluded from
other large studies of contraception use.
Limitations of this work include the
typical limitations of administrative data
analysis, which are dependent on proper
documentation and coding by medical
providers. Administrative data does not
include family history of thrombosis,

 and risk factors such as smoking and obe-
sity are typically undercoded by providers
(30,31). Use of administrative data also
does not allow us to know the exact tim-
ing of thromboembolism in relation to
start of contraceptive use, and thrombo-
embolism is known to be more common
in new users. Our data source was also
almost exclusively a commercially insured
population, so our results may not be ap-
plicable to the Medicaid or uninsured
populations. Contraceptives can also be
obtained through Title X clinics such as
Planned Parenthood, which would not
be billed to insurance; therefore, some
women coded as no hormonal contracep-
tive use may have been miscoded. Our
analysis did not control for acute throm-
botic risk factors such as recent trauma or
major surgery. Finally, we had very small
numbers of implant users, and larger stud-
ies are needed to definitively show low
thromboembolic event rates in women
with diabetes.
Currently, diabetes affects ;2 million
U.S. women of reproductive age. Even
among women with “uncomplicated”
diabetes (,20 years of diabetes and no
end-organ disease), it appears that cli-
nicians may avoid combined hormonal
contraceptives because of concerns of
cardiovascular side effects (32), in large
part because of the lack of published
data directly relevant to women with di-
abetes. Our results demonstrate the
safety of hormonal contraception use in
women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
with an overall low absolute risk of ;1
thromboembolic event per 100 woman-
years of use. The contraceptives with the
lowest absolute risk were the intrauterine
and implantable subdermal contracep-
tives, and these highly effective reversible
contraceptives are excellent options for
women with diabetes.
