Smoking prevalence and attributable disease burden in 
195 countries and territories, 1990–2015: a systematic 
analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Tobacco Collaborators*
Summary
Background The scale-up of tobacco control, especially after the adoption of the Framework Convention for Tobacco 
Control, is a major public health success story. Nonetheless, smoking remains a leading risk for early death and 
disability worldwide, and therefore continues to require sustained political commitment. The Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) offers a robust platform through which global, regional, and 
national progress toward achieving smoking-related targets can be assessed.
Methods We synthesised 2818 data sources with spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and produced estimates 
of daily smoking prevalence by sex, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We analysed 
38 risk-outcome pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and disease burden, as measured by 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We then performed a cohort analysis of smoking prevalence by birth-year cohort 
to better understand temporal age patterns in smoking. We also did a decomposition analysis, in which we parsed out 
changes in all-cause smoking-attributable DALYs due to changes in population growth, population ageing, smoking 
prevalence, and risk-deleted DALY rates. Finally, we explored results by level of development using the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
Findings Worldwide, the age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking was 25·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
24·2–25·7) for men and 5·4% (5·1–5·7) for women, representing 28·4% (25·8–31·1) and 34·4% (29·4–38·6) 
reductions, respectively, since 1990. A greater percentage of countries and territories achieved significant annualised 
rates of decline in smoking prevalence from 1990 to 2005 than in between 2005 and 2015; however, only four countries 
had significant annualised increases in smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015 (Congo [Brazzaville] and 
Azerbaijan for men and Kuwait and Timor-Leste for women). In 2015, 11·5% of global deaths (6·4 million [95% UI 
5·7–7·0 million]) were attributable to smoking worldwide, of which 52·2% took place in four countries (China, India, 
the USA, and Russia). Smoking was ranked among the five leading risk factors by DALYs in 109 countries and 
territories in 2015, rising from 88 geographies in 1990. In terms of birth cohorts, male smoking prevalence followed 
similar age patterns across levels of SDI, whereas much more heterogeneity was found in age patterns for female 
smokers by level of development. While smoking prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates mostly decreased by sex and 
SDI quintile, population growth, population ageing, or a combination of both, drove rises in overall smoking-
attributable DALYs in low-SDI to middle-SDI geographies between 2005 and 2015.
Interpretation The pace of progress in reducing smoking prevalence has been heterogeneous across geographies, 
development status, and sex, and as highlighted by more recent trends, maintaining past rates of decline should not 
be taken for granted, especially in women and in low-SDI to middle-SDI countries. Beyond the effect of the tobacco 
industry and societal mores, a crucial challenge facing tobacco control initiatives is that demographic forces are 
poised to heighten smoking’s global toll, unless progress in preventing initiation and promoting cessation can be 
substantially accelerated. Greater success in tobacco control is possible but requires effective, comprehensive, and 
adequately implemented and enforced policies, which might in turn require global and national levels of political 
commitment beyond what has been achieved during the past 25 years.

Introduction
Smoking was the second leading risk factor for early 
death and disability worldwide in 2015.1 It has claimed 
more than 5 million lives every year since 1990,1 and its 
contribution to overall disease burden is growing, 
especially in lower income countries. The negative effects 
of smoking extend well beyond individual and population 
health2 as billions of dollars in lost productivity and 
health-care expenditure are related to smoking every 
year.3 Successfully combatting the tobacco industry’s 
pursuit of new smokers has been further complicated 
by the substantive—and sometimes rapid—social,

demographic, and economic shifts occurring worldwide.4–6 
As the tobacco industry moves to target previously 
untapped markets,6–8 strong tobacco control policies and 
timely monitoring of smoking patterns are imperative.
The past decade has brought a substantial expansion 
and strengthening of tobacco control initiatives, 
harnessing a wide range of effective interventions and 
policy 
instruments 
for 
addressing 
the 
tobacco 
epidemic.9–16 Successful strategies include taxation of 
tobacco products,9 bans on smoking in public places and 
instituting smoke-free zones,10,11 restrictions on the 
marketing and promotion of cigarettes, including plain 
packaging laws,12 community-wide and nation-wide 
smoking cessation interventions,13,14 and enforcement of 
both text and pictorial warning labels on tobacco 
products.15,16 Efforts to implement comprehensive tobacco 
control policies culminated in the adoption of the WHO 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 
in 2003.17 The FCTC, the world’s first public health treaty, 
is viewed as a key driver of recent progress in reducing 
tobacco consumption and smoking prevalence in many 
regions of the world.18 As of 2016, 180 parties have ratified 
the FCTC,19 and many use WHO’s MPOWER measures,20 
established in 2008, to guide national and local FCTC 
compliance.21 More recently, WHO introduced the 25×25 
non-communicable disease (NCD) targets, which include 
decreasing tobacco use by 30% between 2010 and 2025.22 
Several countries have committed to an even stronger 
anti-smoking goal, setting national targets to become 
tobacco-free.23 
Additionally, 
strengthening 
FCTC 
implementation was explicitly included in the United 
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).24 With 
tobacco control’s increasing prioritisation on the global 
stage, accurately monitoring patterns in smoking and 
associated health outcomes is critical for identifying 
optimal intervention strategies across geographies, 
demographic groups, and the development spectrum.
Previous 
analyses 
of 
smoking 
prevalence 
and 
attributable disease burden often were hindered by poor 
data availability, methodological limitations, or both.25–27 
Investments in survey series focused on tobacco, such as 
the Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS) and the Global 
Youth Tobacco Surveys (GYTS), have supported more in-
depth assessments of national tobacco use.28 Nonetheless, 
remaining data gaps across countries and time, as well as 
differences in smoking-related questions and definitions 
among available data sources, necessitated large 
analytical improvements to produce a systematic and 
consistent understanding of smoking patterns. As part of 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
2013 Study (GBD 2013), Ng and colleagues generated the 
first comprehensive, comparable estimates of smoking 
prevalence and tobacco consumption for 188 countries 
from 1980 to 2013.29 Since then, other studies have used 
similar data synthesis approaches to project smoking 
trends from 2010 to 2025 in 173 countries for men and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Smoking is a widely recognised risk factor for premature 
morbidity and mortality, but adequate monitoring of smoking 
levels and trends throughout the world has been challenging. 
Increasing investments in multi-country survey series has 
improved the availability of data for smoking behaviours, 
especially in lower income countries, but such surveys are quite 
infrequent and differences in survey questions and definitions can 
hinder appropriate comparisons between countries and across 
time. Through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors 2013 Study (GBD 2013), researchers collated diverse data 
sources and synthesised them to produce comprehensive, 
comparable estimates of daily smoking prevalence, by sex and age 
group, for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. Additional analyses, 
including those by Bilano and colleagues in 2015, have applied 
similar methods to project trends in tobacco use through 2025 in 
173 countries for men and 178 countries for women.
Added value of this study
With the 2015 update to the GBD, the number of data sources 
included was substantially increased and the estimation process 
for both smoking prevalence and attributable disease burden, 
as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), has been 
improved. Two novel analyses are also provided through the 
GBD 2015 study: a birth cohort analysis of smoking patterns 
over time and a decomposition analysis to parse out changes in 
total DALYs attributable to smoking to changes in population 
growth, population ageing, smoking prevalence, and 
risk-deleted DALY rates. The latter assessment can assist with 
identifying what factors are contributing to changes in disease 
burden due to smoking–demographic trends, efforts to address 
smoking, or some combination of these factors. Further, we 
used the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a new summary 
measure of overall development from GBD 2015, to assess 
levels and trends in smoking prevalence and attributable 
burden across the development spectrum.
Implications of all the available evidence
Amid gains in tobacco control worldwide, smoking remains a 
leading risk factor for early death and disability. Although there 
have been some success stories, for many countries and 
territories, faster annualised rates of decline in smoking 
prevalence occurred between 1990 and 2005 than 
between 2005 and 2015. Although smoking prevalence and 
risk-deleted DALY rates fell across SDI quintiles, population 
growth and ageing ultimately offset these gains and 
contributed to overall increases in smoking-attributable disease 
burden in low to middle SDI geographies. Intensified tobacco 
control and strengthened monitoring are required to further 
reduce smoking prevalence and attributable burden, especially 
in view of the fact that demographic factors like population 
ageing are not easily amenable to intervention.

178 countries for women.30 Previous GBD studies31,32 have 
assessed the contribution of smoking to overall disease 
burden through the comparative risk assessment 
framework developed by Murray and Lopez.33 Recent 
studies have quantified the global effects of tobacco on 
achieving NCD mortality targets34 and life expectancy,35 
while several assessed smoking-attributable mortality 
and non-fatal health outcomes for specific locations.36,37
In this analysis, we assess smoking prevalence and 
smoking-attributable disease burden, based on deaths 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by sex and age 
group for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. 
We also investigate differences in smoking prevalence and 
attributable burden according to the Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI), a summary measure of income per 
capita, educational attainment, and total fertility rate.38 
Additionally, we assess age and sex patterns by birth 
cohort across levels of development. Finally, we perform 
a decomposition analysis of potential drivers of smoking-
attributable disease burden over time.
Methods
This study follows the overall GBD 2015 comparative risk 
assessment framework, details of which have been 
previously published.1 Here we summarise the main 
steps in the estimation process; the appendix provides 
more details about data inputs and modelling strategies 
(pp 5–9). This study fully adheres to the Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER).39
Estimating smoking exposure
Improving upon methods used by Ng and colleagues,29 
we calculated two exposure measures: prevalence of 
daily smoking of tobacco and the smoking impact ratio. 
We defined a daily smoker as an individual using any 
type of smoked tobacco product on a daily basis.40,41 We 
used 2818 data sources, covering 2928 geography-years 
of data, identified through the Global Health Data 
Exchange (GHDx), WHO InfoBase Database, and 
International Smoking Statistics Database; the appendix 
provides additional details on data sources (pp 5, 6). For 
any data that did not match our exposure definition we 
adjusted for frequency of use or type of tobacco 
consumed to avoid potential biases. We adjusted for 
smoking frequency and type simultaneously, which 
allowed us to account for their mutual correlations with 
each other (appendix pp 7, 8). Second-hand smoke 
exposure is estimated separately in GBD and is not 
included in this analysis.
We generated estimates of smoking prevalence by sex 
and 5-year age groups starting at age 10 years. Any data 
that spanned multiple age groups or were reported for 
both sexes combined were split based on the age-sex 
patterns recorded from data sources with multiple age-
sex groupings.29 We then used spatiotemporal Gaussian 
process regression (ST-GPR), a data synthesis method 
widely used in GBD,1 which allowed us to draw strength 
across geography, time, and age, incorporate both data 
and model uncertainty, and produce a full time-series of 
estimates for all 195 geographies. The appendix provides 
full details on the modelling strategy (pp 5–9).
The second exposure measure, the smoking impact 
ratio, was first described by Peto and Lopez42 as part of a 
method to estimate smoking-attributable burden in the 
absence of information about smoking patterns. The 
smoking impact ratio is defined as the population lung 
cancer mortality rate in excess of the background lung 
cancer mortality rate recorded in non-smokers in the 
population, relative to the excess lung cancer mortality rate 
recorded in a reference group of smokers. We computed 
the smoking impact ratio for each analytic unit using the 
geography-specific, year-specific, age-specific, and sex-
specific population lung cancer mortality rates from 
GBD 2015,20 and reference group lung cancer mortality 
rates from prospective cohort studies (appendix p 9).
Defining risk-outcome pairs
We assessed all available evidence that supported causal 
associations between smoking and 38 health outcomes 
using a systematic approach adapted from Hill’s criteria 
for causation43 and the World Cancer Research Fund 
evidence grading schema (appendix p 9).44 We added 
seven new outcomes to those used in GBD 2013:31 larynx 
cancer, peptic ulcer disease, rheumatoid arthritis, 
cataract, macular degeneration, hip fracture, and non-hip 
fracture.
Estimating attributable burden
We used 5-year lagged smoking prevalence in estimating 
smoking attributable burden for cardiovascular diseases, 
tuberculosis, diabetes, lower respiratory infections, 
asthma, cataracts, macular degeneration, fractures, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and peptic ulcer disease. We chose 
a 5-year lag based on findings showing that most risk-
reduction occurs within 5 years of quitting smoking.45 We 
used the smoking impact ratio in estimating smoking- 
attributable burden for cancers, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, 
other chronic respiratory diseases, and pneumoconiosis. 
The appendix provides a complete list of outcomes and 
their associated exposure metric (pp 31, 32).
For each outcome included in this analysis we used 
relative risk estimates derived from prospective cohort 
studies comparing smokers to never smokers (appendix 
p 9). Population attributable fractions were calculated 
based on estimates of exposure, relative risks, and the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level for smoking 
(zero smoking). Following population attributable 
fraction calculation, we multiplied estimates of deaths 
and DALYs by outcome-specific population attributable 
fractions, and then summed them across all 38 outcomes 
to compute overall disease burden attributable to smoking 
(appendix p 9).

Uncertainty analysis
We captured and propagated uncertainty through all 
steps of the analysis, including sampling uncertainty 
from data extraction, uncertainty from models used to 
adjust data reported in non-standard frequency-type 
combinations, uncertainty in the ST-GPR model, and 
uncertainty in deaths and DALYs for the 38 included 
outcomes. Ultimately, we produced 1000 draws of 
exposure and attributable burden estimates, for each 
geography, year, age, and sex, from which 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were taken using the 2·5 percentile and 
97·5 percentile of the distribution.
Decomposing changes in DALYs
To parse out the drivers of changes in smoking-attributable 
DALYs from 2005 to 2015, we assessed the relative 
contribution of four factors: population growth, population 
age structure, risk-deleted DALY rates, and smoking 
exposure. Risk-deleted rates are defined as the DALY rates 
that would have been recorded had we removed smoking 
as a risk factor. We estimated risk-deleted DALY rates by 
multiplying the observed cause-specific DALY rates by one 
minus the cause-specific population attributable fractions. 
For the decomposition analysis, we used the methods 
developed by Das Gupta (appendix p 10).46
Smoking and its association with SDI
We present results aggregated by level of SDI, a 
composite indicator of development estimated for each 
geography based on lag-distributed income per capita, 
average educational attainment among individuals over 
age 15 years, and total fertility rate. SDI values were 
scaled to a range from 0 to 1.38 The appendix provides 
SDI values for each geography (pp 21–25).

Results
Global, regional, and national levels and trends of daily 
smoking
Worldwide in 2015, the age-standardised prevalence of 
daily smoking was 25·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
24·2–25·7) in men and 5·4% (5·1–5·7) in women (table 1). 
51 countries and territories had significantly higher 
prevalence of smoking than the global average for men, 
and these countries were located mainly in central and 
eastern Europe and southeast Asia (figure 1). For women, 
70 countries, mainly in western and central Europe, 
significantly exceeded the global average. Among men, 
prevalence of daily smoking was highest in middle SDI 
countries, whereas for women high SDI countries had the 
highest prevalence of daily smokers (figure 2). Compared 
with other SDI levels, low SDI geographies generally had 
the lowest prevalence of daily smoking for both sexes.
Between 1990 and 2015, the global age-standardised 
prevalence of daily smoking fell significantly for both 
sexes, decreasing by 28·4% (95% UI 25·8–31·1) for men 
and 34·4% (29·4–38·6) for women (table 2). 13 countries 
(Australia, Brazil, China, Denmark, Dominican Republic, 
Iceland, Kenya, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 
Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA) recorded significant 
annualised rates of decline both between 1990 and 2005 
and 2005 and 2015, suggesting sustained progress in 
tobacco control (table 1). 18 countries showed a faster 
annualised rate of reduction in daily smoking in the most 
recent decade compared with between 1990 and 2005. 
Focusing on the most recent decade, since 2005, 53 (27%) 
of 195 countries and territories recorded significant 
decreases in age-standardised prevalence of male daily 
smoking, whereas only 32 (16%) recorded significant 
reductions for women.
Countries with large smoking populations
In 2015, there were 933·1 million (95% UI 831·3–1054·3) 
daily smokers in the world, 82·3% of whom were men 
(768·1 million [690·1–852·2]). The ten countries with the 
largest number of smokers together accounted for 63·6% 
of the world’s daily smokers. China, India, and Indonesia, 
the three leading countries in total number of male 
smokers, accounted for 51·4% of the world’s male 
smokers in 2015. On the other hand, the USA, China, 
and India, which were the leading three countries in total 
number of female smokers, accounted for only 27·3% of 
the world’s female smokers. Together, these results 
suggest that the tobacco epidemic is less geographically 
concentrated for women than for men.
Among the ten countries with the largest number of 
total smokers in 2015, seven recorded significant 
decreases in male smoking prevalence and five had 
significant decreases in female smoking prevalence 
since 1990 (table 2). Of these countries, Brazil recorded 
the largest overall reduction in prevalence for both male 
and female daily smoking, which dropped by 56·5% 
(51·9–61·1) 
and 
55·8% 
(48·7–61·9), 
respectively, 
between 1990 and 2015. Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the 
Philippines did not have significant reductions in male 
prevalence of daily smoking since 1990, and the 
Philippines, Germany, and India had no significant 
decreases in smoking among women. All of the three 
countries 
with 
female 
age-standardised 
smoking 
prevalence less than 3·0% (China, India, and Bangladesh) 
succeeded in keeping smoking prevalence low in women. 
Notably, female prevalence of daily smoking significantly 
increased in Russia and Indonesia since 1990 (table 2).
Adolescents
Delving into the smoking patterns of adolescents can 
shed light on trends in smoking initiation.47 Between 1990 
and 2015, the global prevalence of daily smoking for this

age group significantly decreased for each sex, falling 
from 16·1% (95% UI 14·4–18·0) to 10·6% (9·3–12·1) for 
men and from 4·8% (4·3–5·6) to 3·0% (2·6–3·7) for 
women (table 2). Despite global decreases, several 
countries still had a high prevalence of smoking among 
individuals aged between 15 and 19 years. In 2015, there 
were 22 countries with female smoking prevalence in 
this age group higher than 15·0%, 18 of which were 
located in western or central Europe. Countries with high 
male smoking prevalence were much more dispersed. Of 
the 24 countries with male smoking prevalence higher 
than 20·0%, six were in eastern Europe, and the 
remainder were spread across ten other regions 
(appendix pp 13, 14). The rank of countries with the 
largest smoking populations for the 15–19 years age 
group was mostly consistent with the rank for all-age 
smoking populations (table 2).
Although no country had a significant increase for men 
or women in this age group since 2005, only three 
countries saw smoking prevalence in 15 to 19 year-olds 
significantly drop for both men and women since 2005 
(New Zealand, Iceland, and the USA). Iceland had the 
largest significant decrease among men, decreasing 
from 14·8% (95% UI 11·7–18·5) in 2005 to 9·0% 
(5·6–13·3) in 2015. New Zealand had the largest 
significant decline among women, decreasing from 
20·8% (18·1–23·8) in 2005 to 12·5% (10·1–15·5) in 2015 
(available to view through GHDx).
Shifts in patterns of smoking across cohorts
Parsing out daily smoking prevalence by age group and 
birth cohort allows for a more fine-grained examination 
of smoking prevalence, age patterns, and temporal trends 
by level of development (figure 2). Male age patterns of 
smoking were fairly consistent across levels of SDI, with 
prevalence generally peaking between the ages of 25 and 
35 years. For women, however, age patterns varied more 
by SDI; female smoking prevalence typically peaked 
around age 25 years for high and high-middle SDI 
countries, while prevalence generally increased until age 
60 years in low to middle SDI countries. Across birth 
cohorts, smoking prevalence decreased by age group, sex, 
and SDI level. The most notable decreases were recorded 
in high and high-middle SDI countries for men, where 
sizeable reductions in smoking prevalence in 15 to 
24 year-olds occurred across birth cohorts. Middle SDI 
countries, which have the highest levels of daily smoking 
among men, had minimal changes in prevalence across 
birth cohorts, suggesting far less progress in curbing 
smoking initiation or promoting cessation. For women, 
prevalence is consistently lower than in men; nevertheless, 
reductions in smoking prevalence across birth cohorts 
generally were smaller than those recorded for men.
Deaths and disease burden attributable to smoking
In 2015, 6·4 million deaths (95% UI 5·7–7·0) were 
attributable to smoking worldwide, representing a 4·7%

(1·2–8·5) increase in smoking-attributable deaths 
since 2005. More than 75% of these deaths were in men, 
and 52·2% took place in four countries (China, India, the 
USA, and Russia). Smoking was the second-leading risk 
factor for attributable mortality among both sexes in both 
2005 and 2015, following high-systolic blood pressure.1 
The relative ranking of smoking-attributable disease 
burden, as measured in DALYs, increased from third to 
second between 2005 and 2015. In 2015, there were 
148·6 million (95% UI 134·2–163·1) smoking-attributable 
DALYs worldwide, and smoking was the leading risk 
factor for attributable disease burden in 24 countries, an 
increase from 16 countries in 1990 (figure 3). Further, 
smoking was ranked among the leading five risk factors 
for 109 countries in 2015. Between 2005 and 2015, only 
Egypt recorded a significant increase in the age-
standardised smoking-attributable mortality rate among 
both sexes, increasing by 11·4% (95% UI 0·3–24·7) over 
that time period. On the other hand, 82 countries had 
significant decreases in their age-standardised smoking-
attributable mortality rates since 2005.
Overall, in 2015, cardiovascular diseases (41·2%), cancers 
(27·6%), and chronic respiratory diseases (20·5%) were 
the three leading causes of smoking-attributable age-
standardised DALYs for both sexes. Of all risk factors, 
smoking was the leading risk factor for cancers and 
chronic respiratory diseases, but only the ninth leading 
risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.1 The appendix 
shows the 30 leading causes of DALYs attributable to 
smoking, including changes over time (pp 19, 20). For 
women, the leading cause of smoking-attributable DALYs 
was COPD, whereas the leading cause for men was 
ischaemic heart disease.
Decomposing changes in attributable burden due to 
smoking
Relative to changes in smoking exposure, the main 
drivers of overall changes in attributable burden due to 
smoking varied by both sex and SDI level (figure 4). 
Since 2005, all-cause DALYs attributable to smoking for 
men decreased by 11·8% (95% UI 10·0–13·9) in high-
SDI countries, the only SDI level with a significant 
decrease in attributable burden for men. For women, 
only middle-SDI countries had a significant reduction 
in 
all-cause 
DALYs 
attributable 
to 
smoking 
(a 
22·6% decrease [9·0–32·8]) between 2005 and 2015. In 
both instances, a combination of reduced smoking 
exposure 
and 
reduced 
risk-deleted 
DALY 
rates 
contributed to overall reductions. Conversely, all-cause 
burden due to smoking significantly increased in low

SDI and low-middle SDI countries since 2005 for men. 
This rise in attributable DALYs was driven mainly by a 
combination of population growth and population ageing 
for both sexes. In women, while rising exposure to 
smoking has resulted in increased DALYs due to smoking 
for low-middle SDI countries, this increase was not 
significant. Generally, population growth was the leading 
factor for increasing attributable burden due to smoking 
among the low SDI countries between 2005 and 2015. 
For countries of middle to high SDI, more pronounced 
sex differences emerged. For instance, decreases in male 
smoking prevalence propelled an overall reduction in 
attributable burden for high SDI countries, whereas 
changes in smoking exposure had minimal effects on 
overall burden for women at similarly high levels of SDI.
A complete dataset of all results by geography, year, sex, 
and age group can be downloaded through GHDx, and 
an interactive data visualisation of smoking prevalence 
results can be found online.
Discussion
Despite more than half a century of unequivocal evidence 
of the harmful effects of tobacco on health,48,49 in 2015, 
one in every four men in the world was a daily smoker. 
Prevalence has been, and remains, significantly lower in 
women—roughly one in every 20 women smoked daily 
in 2015. Nonetheless, much progress has been 
accomplished in the past 25 years. Specifically, the age-
standardised global prevalence of daily smoking fell to 
15·3% (95% UI 14·8–15·9), a 29·4% (27·1–31·8) 
reduction from 1990, with smoking rates decreasing 
from 34·9% (34·1–35·7) to 25·0% (24·2–25·7) in men 
and from 8·2% (7·9–8·6) to 5·4% (5·1–5·7) in women. 
These reductions were especially pronounced in high 
SDI countries and Latin America, probably reflecting 
concerted efforts to implement strong tobacco control 
policies and programmes in Brazil and Panama, among 
others. 
Yet amid these gains, many countries with persistently 
high levels of daily smoking recorded marginal progress 
since 2005, and smoking remained among the leading 
risk factors for early death and disability in more than 
100 countries in 2015, accounting for 11·5% of global 
deaths (95% UI 10·3–12·6) and 6·0% (5·3–6·8) of global 
DALYs. Smoking patterns diverged by geography, level of 
development, sex, and birth cohort, emphasising the 
need for tailored approaches to change smoking 
behaviours. Although male smoking prevalence still far 
exceeded that of female smokers in 2015, the most 
pronounced reductions in smoking prevalence since 1990 
were generally found for men—and more places saw 
minimal changes or increases in smoking among 
women. These trends highlight how the tobacco 
epidemic, and corresponding industry forces, has 
expanded beyond a male-centred health challenge.
Low to middle SDI countries saw increased disease 
burden attributable to smoking since 2005, a trend that

that occurred despite variable decreases in smoking 
prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates. Population 
growth or ageing, or a combination of both, ultimately 
contributed to increased disease burden attributable to 
smoking in these countries. In higher SDI countries, 
population growth and ageing offset the potential for 
larger gains in places where notable declines in smoking 
prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates occurred. This 
finding points to a crucial challenge ahead for tobacco 
control: unless progress in reducing current smoking 
and preventing initiation can be substantially accelerated, 
demographic forces, which are far less amenable to 
immediate intervention, are poised to heighten the 
disease burden associated with smoking’s global toll.
Since 2005, the year when the FCTC entered into force, 
it has redefined global, regional, and national approaches 
to tobacco control and policy.50,51 Case studies point to the 
successful uptake and enforcement of FCTC components 
in many countries with especially prominent reductions 
in smoking prevalence. Pakistan, Panama, and India 
stand out as three countries that have implemented a 
large number of tobacco control policies over the past 
decade and have had marked declines in the prevalence 
of daily smoking since 2005, compared with decreases 
recorded between 1990 and 2005.52–54 At the same time, 
many countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
South Korea, and the USA, among others, achieved 
sizeable declines in smoking prevalence well before 
FCTC adoption.15,56–58 Altogether, 18 countries recorded a 
faster annualised rate of decline from 1990 to 2005 than 
from 2005 to 2015.
Brazil, which has achieved the third largest significant 
decline in age-standardised smoking prevalence since 1990, 
is a noteworthy success story. Brazil accomplished this 
reduction through a combination of tobacco control 
policies that began with advertising restrictions and 
smoking bans in some public places starting in 1996 and 
culminated with Brazil achieving the highest level of 
achievement in all MPOWER measures except for 
monitoring by 2011. Policies were comprehensive and were 
supplemented with fiscal interventions that included 
raising taxes and establishing minimum prices for tobacco 
products. Finally, Brazil has achieved high levels of 
compliance through enforcement.20,59–62
Critics of the FCTC argue that the treaty’s effectiveness 
may be limited in various settings, especially since 
compliance has lagged in many countries.63–65 The FCTC, 
while necessary and vital for creating the policy 
environment 
for 
more 
effective 
tobacco 
control 
worldwide, is not sufficient to fully address each country’s 
tobacco control needs. Rather, countries will need to both 
implement FCTC-stipulated measures and supplement

such policies and programmes with strong enforcement 
and high rates of compliance. For example, India, 
where 11·2% of the world’s smokers live, supplemented 
the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) 
with the creation of a National Tobacco Control 
Programme (NTCP) in 2007
. NTCP was created to 
strengthen implementation and enforcement of the 
various provisions of COTPA at the state and district 
level. It has been rolled out in phases and currently 
covers about 40% of all districts in India.66
Despite concerted efforts to control tobacco around the 
world, there remain a number of countries where current 
levels and recent trends raise concern. For example, 
Indonesia, a country with very high levels of smoking, 
particularly among men, has not yet ratified the FCTC 
and scores very poorly on the MPOWER indicators.18 
Also, in Russia, prevalence among women has been 
increasing, and, until recently, there were very few laws 
related 
to 
tobacco 
control.67 
Russia 
passed 
a 
comprehensive tobacco control policy in 2014 and has the 
potential to achieve progress on tobacco control.68 As a 
region, eastern Europe has seen a statistically significant 
increase in smoking prevalence among women 
since 1990. Increases among women, along with a 
sustained high prevalence of male smokers, can be 
linked to tobacco industry targeting during the 1990s.6 
The tobacco industry is now turning its focus toward 
emerging markets in sub-Saharan Africa, seeking to 
exploit the continent’s patchwork tobacco control 
regulations and limited resources to combat industry 
marketing advances.69,70 Given the large effects of 
population growth and ageing on smoking-attributable 
disease 
burden—and 
Africa’s 
rapidly 
changing 
demographic profile—a renewed dedication to strong, 
proactive tobacco policies and monitoring will be vital for 
the continent.71
The 2030 agenda features tobacco control as a key 
component to sustainable development, with SDG 
Target 3.a calling for stronger FCTC implementation.24 
Nonetheless, the utility and potential impact of the 
SDGs on tobacco control may be hindered by the 
vagueness of Target 3.a (“Strengthen the implementation 
of the WHO FCTC in all countries, as appropriate”) and 
absence of defined targets for reducing smoking 
prevalence by 2030. Ultimately, to move all countries 
toward stronger tobacco control by 2030, improvements 
in policy formulation, enforcement and compliance, and 
the routine monitoring of smoking behaviour are 
urgently needed. Without valid and reliable data, these 
efforts risk being more aspirational than grounded in 
evidence-informed action. Multi-country survey series 
have substantially improved data availability on smoking 
prevalence, yet the disadvantages associated with such 
surveys—high cost, time lags, inconsistent questions 
across survey series, sample restrictions for young 
populations, and a reliance on self-reported smoking 
behaviour—necessitate the development of robust, 
locally focused, timely, objective, and low-cost methods 
of tracking smoking trends. Supplementing surveys 
with biomarker collection is essential because self-
reported smoking prevalence is believed to be severely 
underestimating true smoking prevalence,72–75 especially 
in population subgroups or places where tobacco use 
may not be culturally acceptable.
Our findings should be interpreted taking into 
consideration the study’s limitations. First, our exposure 
estimation focused on smoked tobacco and did not 
include smokeless tobacco products and e-cigarettes. 
Second, our definition of smoking exposure pertained to 
current daily smokers, and did not include occasional or 
former smokers, which might underestimate the 
attributable disease burden to smoking, especially in 
populations who tend to be less likely to smoke every 
day, such as women, children and young adults, and 
individuals with less disposable income. Third, we did 
not account for the intensity or duration of smoking. 
Fourth, the study relied on self-reported data, and it is 
possible that reporting biases varied across countries 
and over time. Fifth, for long-term effects of smoking on 
cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, we used the 
smoking impact ratio method, which estimates the 
lifetime cumulative effect of cigarette smoking using the 
proxy of recorded lung cancer mortality rates. This 
method provides robust estimates of the burden of 
cancers and chronic respiratory diseases related to 
tobacco but is not fully consistent with the GBD 
approach of estimating exposure independently of the 
outcomes affected by exposure. Also, the smoking 
impact ratio method is based on the cumulative effect of 
cigarette smoking rather than all types of tobacco 
smoking, and might be less robust for geographies in 
which non-smoker lung cancer might be significantly 
affected by air pollution or other factors. Sixth, our

estimates of DALYs are probably underestimates because 
relative risk values used for estimating population 
attributable fractions might not fully represent all 
possible risk-outcome pairs experienced by sex, age 
group, and over time.76 Also, burden estimates did not 
account for the effect of both indoor and outdoor air 
pollution potentiating risks. Finally, minimal risk-
outcome data were available for populations younger 
than 30 years, and therefore burden attribution was 
limited to age groups 30 years and older.
Discussion
Despite more than 50 years of anti-tobacco efforts, smoking 
remains a leading global risk factor. Its toll will remain 
substantial without more concerted policy initiatives, policy 
compliance and enforcement, and sustained political will 
to offset commercial interests. Despite progress in some 
settings, the war against tobacco is far from won, especially 
in countries with the highest numbers of smokers. The 
staggering toll of smoking on health echoes well beyond 
the individual, especially as tobacco threatens to exact long-
term financial and operational burdens on already resource-
constrained 
health 
systems. 
To 
significantly 
and 
permanently bend the global tobacco epidemic’s trajectory, 
a renewed and sustained focus is needed on comprehensive 
tobacco control policies around the world. Success is 
possible, but requires effective and aggressively enforced 
policies and laws. Intensified efforts are also greatly needed 
to keep smoking prevalence rates low in populations which 
have not experienced a devastating epidemic yet, and to 
prevent children, adolescents, and young adults from 
starting to smoke.
