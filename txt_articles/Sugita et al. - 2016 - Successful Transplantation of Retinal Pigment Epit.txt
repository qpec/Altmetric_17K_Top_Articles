SUMMARY
There is an ongoing controversy as to whether major histocompatibility complex (MHC) matching is a solution for allogeneic stem cell
transplantation. In the present study, we established retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in
MHC homozygote donors. We observed no rejection signs in iPSC-derived RPE allografts of MHC-matched animal models without
immunosuppression, whereas there were immune attacks around the graft and retinal tissue damage in MHC-mismatched models. In
an immunohistochemical examination of MHC-mismatched allografts, the transplanted RPE sheets/cells were located in the subretinal
space, but the RPE exhibited inflammatory and hypertrophic changes, and many inflammatory cells, e.g., Iba1+ cells, MHC class II+ cells,
and CD3+ T cells, invaded the graft area. Conversely, these inflammatory cells poorly infiltrated the area around the transplanted retina
if MHC-matched allografts were used. Thus, cells derived from MHC homozygous donors could be used to treat retinal diseases in
histocompatible recipients.
INTRODUCTION
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated from
reprogrammed adult somatic cells by using Yamanaka
pluripotent transcription factors (Park et al., 2008; Takaha-
shi et al., 2007; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). Recently,
the potential for reprogrammed cells to be used as trans-
plantation materials has been explored. The induced
stem cells have the ability for self-renewal and the ability
to generate several types of differentiated cells. Therefore,
there might be a reduced risk for inflammatory immune
rejection after transplantation because of the self-renew-
ability. However, there have been problems with transplan-
tation associated with immunogenicity in iPSCs, even after
differentiation of cells/tissues. Even autologous mouse
iPSCs induce an immune response, probably akin to an
autoimmune reaction (Zhao et al., 2011). Although
another group (Araki et al., 2013) reported that differenti-
ated cells from iPSCs are eventually not recognized by the
immune system, the immunogenicity of iPSCs and of
iPSC-derived cells is still controversial.
The first clinical application of iPSCs has been initiated
using autologous cells. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
cells are an especially safe cell type that will seldom form
tumors; however, a major problem using autologous iPSCs
for standard treatment is the high cost of cell production.
To resolve these issues, we are studying allogeneic retinal
cell lines derived from iPSCs. When we can prepare
completely safe iPSC-derived retinal cells, and we use
allogeneic retinal cells for the transplantation, we must
consider the expression of major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC; also known as human leukocyte antigen
[HLA]) antigens on the finally differentiated cells/tissues
for the transplantation therapy as the next step. Although
MHC expression is low in many types of stem cells, differ-
entiated tissue expresses MHC, and this expression causes
immune rejection.
Transplantation of RPE cells may be a treatment for
retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration
(AMD).
Many
experimental
clinical
applications
of
allogeneic RPE cells for the treatment of AMD have been
attempted (Algvere, 1997; Algvere et al., 1999; Kaplan
et al., 1999; Peyman et al., 1991). The clinical application
of iPSC-derived RPE (iPS-RPE) cells for AMD treatment
was started in our associated hospital in 2014. Before trans-
plantation studies of iPSCs are undertaken, questions con-
cerning the survival of RPE cells in situ and the presence of
immune attacks after retinal surgery must be addressed. It is
assumed that MHC molecules on RPE cells, including cells
derived from iPSCs, might be the main antigens in alloge-
neic inflammatory reactions. In previous reports (Mochi-
zuki et al., 2013; Sugita, 2009; Sugita and Streilein, 2003;

 Sun et al., 2003), immune cells such as T cells were stimu-
lated or inhibited by exposure to RPE cells. The dual effects
of RPE cells are regulated by MHC and co-stimulatory
molecules on RPE cells. Retinal antigen-specific T cells are
stimulated by exposure to RPE cells that express MHC class
II (MHC-II) on their surface (Sun et al., 2003). RPE cells
maintain immune privilege in the eye (Mochizuki et al.,
2013; Sugita, 2009), but allogeneic RPE grafts are immuno-
genic after ocular transplantation.
The purpose of the present study was to determine
whether allogeneic RPE cells derived from iPSCs could
survive after transplantation. We used an in vivo animal
model with monkey iPS-RPE cells derived from MHC ho-
mozygote iPSC lines that were transplanted into the eyes
of MHC-matched heterozygote donors.
RESULTS
Expression of MHC Classes I and II on iPSC-Derived
RPE Cells
As a first step, we established RPE cells from monkey MHC
homozygote iPSCs for transplantation materials. The mon-
key iPSCs 1121A1, which are MHC near-homozygous, were
established from skin fibroblasts by using an episomal
vector, as previously described (Kamao et al., 2014; Oka-
moto and Takahashi, 2011). The iPS-RPE cells showed
polygonal morphology, mostly hexagonal, and contained
melanin (Figure 1A). iPS-RPE cells expressed RPE65, MiTF,
pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), bestrophin,
Pax6, tyrosinase, MerTK, and ZO-1, which are expressed
by primary RPE cells but not the iPSC marker OCT3/4 (Fig-
ure 1B). The RPE cells had the ability to phagocytose shed
photoreceptor rod outer segments (Figure 1C).
We also examined the expression of MHC molecules on
1121A1 iPS-RPE cells. MHC homozygote iPS-RPE cell line
1121A1, as well as control heterozygote iPS-RPE cell line
46a, constitutively expressed MHC class I (MHC-I), and
recombinant interferon-g (IFN-g)-pretreated RPE cells ex-
pressed MHC-II (Figure 1D). In addition, these RPE cells
did not express CD40, CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), or
CD275
(B7-H2),
but
constitutively
expressed
CD276
(B7-H3) co-stimulatory molecules (Figure 1E).
iPS-RPE Cells from Monkey MHC Homozygote iPSCs
Have Poor Immunogenicity in an In Vivo Animal
Model
Next, we transplanted the 1121A1 MHC homozygote
iPS-RPE cells into monkey eyes in MHC-matched or -mis-
matched donors (cynomolgus monkeys without immuno-
suppression). The graft was monitored by color fundus
pictures, fluorescein angiography (FA), and optical co-
herence tomography (OCT) after surgery at 1, 2, 4, 8, and
12 weeks, and at 6 months. MHC-typing profiles of iPS-
RPE cells and transplanted animals are shown in Table S1.
We observed rejection signs in the allografts of the MHC-
mismatched monkeys (1121A1 RPE cells into S2-4 monkey
eye), e.g., disc redness in color fundus photographs, serous
retinal detachment, and retinal edema including disap-
pearance of the outer retinal layers around the graft in
OCT findings (Figure 2A). On the other hand, there were
no rejection signs in the allografts of the MHC-matched
monkeys (1121A1 RPE cells into DrpZ1 monkey eye), and
the grafts appeared to survive in the subretinal space of
the eye (Figure 2B). Moreover, we observed severe rejection
signs in the allografts of the MHC-mismatched monkeys
(1121A1 RPE sheet into S3-2 monkey eye), e.g., leakage of
fluorescein in the grafts and disc in FA, retinal cystic edema,
and disappearance of the outer retinal layers around the
graft in OCT (Figures 3A and S2). In the fellow eye (left
eye), there were severe immune attacks in the retina (Fig-
ure S1). When 1121A1 RPE sheets were explanted into
MHC-matched monkey eye (DrpZ17), the grafts survived
until the final evaluation at 6 months (Figures 3B and
S2). In addition, there were no immune attacks in the
retina of the fellow eye (Figure S1).
In transplants with control MHC heterozygote iPS-RPE
cells, there were inflammatory rejection signs around the
grafts (46a iPS-RPE cells in K-177 and K-247 monkeys:
Figure S3). For example, we observed rejection signs in
the allografts (cell suspensions) of the MHC-mismatched

(middle panel). iPS-RPE cells without ROS at 37�C were also analyzed (upper panel). DRAQ5 was bound within live/intact cells.

 monkeys (46a RPE cells into K-177 monkey eye), e.g.,
leakage of fluorescein in the grafts in FA (Figure S3A). These
rejection signs were seen 2 weeks after macular surgery.
Moreover, we also observed rejection signs in the allografts
of RPE sheets of the MHC-mismatched monkeys (46a RPE
sheets into K-247 monkey eye), e.g., retinal infiltration
around the graft in OCT (Figure S3B).
iPS-RPE Cells from MHC Homozygote iPSCs Have Poor
Immunogenicity in Immunohistochemistry
Next, we examined whether the transplanted animal
models with iPS-RPE sheets/cells have immunogenic in-
flammatory cells. We conducted H&E staining and in-
flammatory cell immune staining of retinal sections.
The
monkey
retina
was
stained
with
anti-ionized
calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1), MHC-II, or
CD3 antibodies using paraffin sections. In the eye of mon-
key K-247 (transplanted 46a iPS-RPE cell sheet: Figure 4),
we found a piece of the RPE grafts in the center of the in-
flammatory nodules in the retina. Iba1+ cells (ameboid-
type microglia) invaded the inner nuclear layer (INL)
and outer nuclear layer (ONL), and there were abundant
MHC-II+ cells and CD3+ cells in the inflammatory nod-
ules. In addition, we also observed rejection findings in
the allografts of sheets/cells of the MHC-mismatched
monkeys (S3-2, S2-4); the transplanted iPS-RPE cells/
sheets disappeared in the subretinal space, and the retina
was destroyed, with retinal cysts and serous retinal
detachment in the operated eye (Figure S4).
On the other hand, the transplanted RPE cells survived in
the subretinal space of the macula if we transplanted the
1121A1 iPS-RPE cell suspension into DrpZ1 monkey eye
(MHC-matched: Figure 5). The retinal sections had poorly
infiltrated Iba1+ cells, MHC-II+ cells, and CD3+ cells around

 the transplanted retina. We obtained similar results
with DrpZ17 monkey eye (1121A1 iPS-RPE sheets of
MHC-matched allografts: Figure 6). The transplanted RPE
sheets survived in the subretinal space without any inflam-
matory signs, activated microglia, antigen-presenting cells
(APCs), or T cells in the RPE sheets or retina. We also
prepared control retinal sections that we injected with
medium only (without iPS-RPE cells) (DrpZ10: Figure S5).
We observed the Iba1+ cells in the retina, but not MHC-II+
cells or CD3+ cells. These findings were similar to normal
monkey sections (data not shown).
We summarized the results of allografts of iPS-RPE cells/
sheets in monkey models (Table S2). Eventually there was
no rejection between allogeneic RPE cells and the trans-
planted MHC-matched monkey eyes (n = 3), and there
were no rejection signs between allogeneic RPE cells and
the MHC-mismatched monkey eyes (n = 7) that had ocular
inflammation after transplantation. Together, these results
indicate that RPE cells including iPS-derived cells have
immune attacks in the retina. Thus, if we transplant the
iPS-RPE cells/sheets into the subretinal space of an MHC-
matched monkey, the transplant remains intact, even if
the monkey is not immunosuppressed.

rophages/monocytes), CD20+ cells (B cells), and CD56+

 PBMCs (DrpZ10 monkey) did not induce the proliferation
of MHC-matched 1121A1 iPS-RPE cells, i.e., all cell types of
inflammatory cells did not respond, whereas all cell types

 We also examined whether T cells can recognize alloge-
neic RPE cells in vitro (T cell RPE rejection assay). As
expected, T cells produced significant amounts of IFN-g
with 46a iPS-RPE cells but not with autogenic iPS-RPE cells
(Figure S7A). CD4+ T cells produced high levels of IFN-g
with 1121A1 allogeneic MHC-mismatched iPS-RPE cells

 (Figure S7B). However, CD4+ T cells did not recognize
MHC-matched iPS-RPE cells (Figure S7C). In addition,
T cells failed to recognize MHC-mismatched allogeneic
iPS-RPE cells if we added anti-B7-H3 blocking antibodies
in the cultures (Figure S7D). Taken together, our results
with in vivo and in vitro data demonstrate that MHC anti-
gens play a prominent role in the inflammatory processes
in iPSC-derived RPE allografts after transplantation.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we established RPE cells from iPSCs in
MHC homozygote animals. We found no immune attacks
in iPSC-derived RPE allografts of MHC-matched animal
models without immunosuppression. By contrast, there
were inflammatory immune rejections around the graft
and retinal tissue damage together with inflammatory
cell invasion in MHC-mismatched monkeys. In an immu-
nohistochemical examination, the transplanted iPS-RPE
cells of MHC-mismatched allografts did not survive in
the subretinal space, and the retinal tissues exhibited
hypertrophic changes, e.g., inflammatory nodules with
many inflammatory cells, such as Iba1+ microglia/macro-
phages, inflammatory MHC-II+ APCs, and CD3+ T cells
that invaded the region around the RPE grafts. On the other
hand, Iba1+ cells, MHC-II+ cells, and CD3+ cells poorly
invaded around the transplanted retina, and the allografts
survived if we used MHC-matched allografts. In addition,
T cells directly recognized allogeneic iPS-RPE cells in vitro
as well as B cells (positive controls), whereas the T cells
failed to recognize RPE cells from MHC homozygous
donors when there was an MHC-matched combination
between T cells and iPS-RPE cells.
The process of T cell activation after transplantation
could be both direct and indirect. MHC-II-expressing
APCs directly activate alloreactive T cells after transplanta-
tion. Alloreactive T cells of the direct type have T cell recep-
tors (TCRs) that can directly recognize allogeneic MHC-I
(mainly CD8) or MHC-II (mainly CD4), and these T cells
are important mediators of allograft immune rejection.
Most solid-tissue grafts contain MHC-II+ APCs, i.e., den-
dritic cells and macrophages/microglia, which promptly
migrate from the graft once it is in place. RPE cells do not
contain CD11b+, CD11c+, CD14+, or CD45+ cells (Sugita
and Streilein, 2003). In the case of solid-tissue grafts with
MHC-II+ APCs, by trafficking to draining lymph nodes
these donor-derived cells activate alloreactive T cells with
TCRs that directly bind donor MHC antigens. In the indi-
rect pathway, T cells recognize graft MHC-II allogeneic an-
tigens that have been processed and presented by host
APCs. Ocular resident dendritic cells, macrophages, retinal
microglia, and also RPE cells have the capacity to present
retinal antigens to naive and sensitized T cells such as pro-
fessional APCs (Butler and McMenamin, 1996; Percopo
et al., 1990). Our results showed that the rejection process
after allogeneic RPE transplantation in the subretinal space
could be achieved by the direct and indirect activation of
T cells.
As shown in this study, our iPS-RPE cells expressed
MHC-I and MHC-II molecules (first signal). In addition,
the cells expressed CD276 (B7-H3) molecules (second
signal). Although there was no expression of CD40,
CD80, CD86, or B7-H2 co-stimulatory molecules on iPS-
RPE cells, the cells constitutively expressed MHC and
co-stimulatory molecules B7-H3, and can activate T cells
through the first and second signals. Although the
function of B7-H3 molecules is still controversial, B7-H3
molecules that express APC can promote T cell-mediated
immune responses and the development of acute and
chronic immune rejection in allografts after transplanta-
tion (Chapoval et al., 2001). Our results indicated that
the co-stimulatory signals from B7-H3 molecules on iPS-
RPE cells could mediate allogeneic T cell activation. As
the next step, we must consider other antigens (e.g.,
minor antigens and iPSC-specific antigens) and other
immune cells (e.g., CD8+ CTL, NK cells, B cells, and com-
plement factors) to develop successful transplantation
techniques for retinal diseases. The presentation of aber-
rant peptides (minor antigens) by MHC molecules could
lead to significant T cell stimulation. There is substantial
literature on major and minor antigen mismatch in
bone marrow transplants (Dickinson et al., 2002; Goulmy
et al., 1996; Tseng et al., 1999; Voogt et al., 1988). There
are no previous reports of the correlation between minor
histocompatibility antigens and T lymphocytes after
retinal transplantation. The minor histocompatibility an-
tigens, e.g., HA-1, are immunogenic allogeneic antigens
responsible for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in HLA-
matched bone marrow transplantation (Tseng et al.,
1999; Voogt et al., 1988). Laurin et al. (2010) previously
showed that minor histocompatibility antigen-associated
alloreactivity plays a critical role in the development of
GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) after HLA-iden-
tical
hematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation.
They
showed by IFN-g assay that the alloreactivity from donor
versus recipient or donor versus mismatched minor anti-
gens was associated with acute GVHD and GVL. We
currently have no evidence for the correlation between
minor histocompatibility antigen and T cells after RPE
transplantation, but we might be able to monitor the
minor histocompatibility antigen-related immune rejec-
tion if we use similar methods using peripheral T cells in
transplanted patients.
In in vivo animal models, we observed no rejection
signs in the iPS-RPE allografts of MHC-matched monkeys

 (DrpZ1 and DrpZ17); for example, fundus photographs re-
vealed no exudation, FA showed no vascular leakage of
fluorescein, and OCT indicated there was no retinal
edema around the transplanted RPE cells. In contrast, FA
revealed hyperfluorescence staining, while OCT indicated
retinal edema, serous retinal detachment, and disappear-
ance of the outer retinal layers around the graft in
MHC-mismatched animals. Thus, as T cells cannot recog-
nize MHC near-homozygote iPS-RPE cells in MHC restric-
tion, their derivatives from HLA homozygous donors may
be useful in treating retinal diseases in histocompatible re-
cipients. The iPSC bank (Nakatsuji et al., 2008; Okita
et al., 2011) might be a useful source for allografts in
retinal diseases, since T cell-mediated rejection may not
occur if some of the main HLA antigens (at least HLA-A,
B, and DRB1) are matched. This is new evidence that im-
mune cells fail to attack iPS-RPE cells if we use human RPE
cells from HLA homozygous donors.
We next examined whether the transplanted animal
models with iPS-RPE cells have immunogenic inflamma-
tory cells in the retina. First, we conducted H&E staining
and then immune staining of inflammatory cells (Iba1+,
MHC-II+, or CD3+) by using retinal paraffin sections.
Compared with OCT findings, the H&E staining of retinal
sections was clearer. We found that the retina tissues in
MHC-mismatched
allografts
exhibited
hypertrophic
changes in the subretinal space, inflammatory nodules
and/or changes of cystic edema in the retina, retinal
destruction, vitreous cells, and cell infiltration in the
choroid. On the other hand, we observed that the grafts
survived intact in the subretinal space if we transplanted
MHC-matched RPE allografts. According to previous re-
ports in monkey transplantation models (Valentino et al.,
1995), the authors removed the RPE tissues from Bruch’s
membrane in the macula and outside the vascular arcades.
In their results, the regrowth of RPE cells was associated
with repaired, normal-appearing photoreceptor outer seg-
ments, suggesting that repopulation of RPE cells in the
adult monkey could support the repair of damaged photo-
receptors following retinal surgery.
On immune staining we found many inflammatory cells
such as Iba1+, MHC-II+, and/or CD3+ cells in the retina. For
instance, K-247 monkey, ameboid-type Iba1+ cells (acti-
vated microglia) invaded the INL/ONL after transplanta-
tion. Many MHC-II+ cells (activated APCs) invaded the
inflammatory nodules in the retina. Moreover, we were
able to see the Iba1 and MHC-II double-positive cells in
the retina, features that are not visible in normal sections
and control sections (DrpZ10 left eye). More importantly,
there were many CD3+ cells (T cells) in the inflammatory
nodules in the retina, and a piece of the RPE grafts in the
center of the retinal nodules. In a previous report, IFN-g-
pretreated RPE cells that inducibly express MHC-II mole-
cules were able to stimulate retinal antigen-specific T cells
(Sun et al., 2003). The grafted RPE cells and the host RPE
layer also expressed MHC-II molecules, and the infiltrated
CD3+ T cells in the retina greatly expressed IFN-g in the
inflamed eye (data not shown).
However, as shown in immunohistochemical analysis of
DrpZ1 and DrpZ17 monkeys, the transplanted iPS-RPE cells
(1121A1) survived in the subretinal space, and these mon-
key retinal sections with anti-Iba1, MHC-II, or CD3 anti-
bodies had slight cell infiltration around the transplanted
retina. In the present study we did not use any immuno-
suppressive medication for the transplantation, but we
eventually found no immune attacks even if MHC-
matched allografts were explanted. Tezel et al. (2007)
previously reported that allogeneic RPE cell sheet trans-
plants for exudative AMD patients showed no signs of
immune rejection in patients who were able to continue
the immunosuppressive medication for 6 months. Thus,
systemic immune suppression prevented the rejection of
the transplanted allogeneic RPE cells. Our results primarily
show that MHC-matching transplantation between donor
and recipient appears to prevent the immune attacks of
allografts without immunosuppressants. We are now
conducting experiments as to whether iPS-RPE MHC-mis-
matched allografts have immune rejection under local
immunosuppressive medication (e.g., intraocular steroids),
compared with systemic immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclo-
sporine A).
In conclusion, T lymphocytes cannot recognize MHC
antigens on allogeneic iPS-RPE cells established from
MHC homozygote donors, as well as autogenic iPS-RPE
cells in vitro. Importantly, in animal models without
immunosuppressive
medication,
iPS-RPE
cells
from
MHC homozygous donors did not have immune re-
sponses in the retina of MHC-matched donors after
transplantation. This study is the first to show the
possibility that the main HLA loci-matched allogeneic
iPSC-RPE cell transplantation will need little or no
immunosuppression.
Figure 7. Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction Assay with Fresh PBMCs Plus iPS-RPE Cells
In the PBMC-RPE MLR assay with allogeneic 1121A1 or 46a iPS-RPE cells, PBMCs (2 3 106 cells/well in DrpZ10 monkey) were cultured with
allogeneic iPS-RPE cells for 5 days. Before the assay, RPE cells were irradiated (20 Gy), and 1 3 104 cells were cultured in a 24-well plate.
Cells were stained with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD11b, anti-CD20, anti-CD56, anti-Ki-67, and each isotype control antibody at 4�C
for 30 min. The samples were analyzed on a FACS flow cytometer. Numbers (%) in the scatterplots indicate double-positive cells
(e.g., CD4/Ki-67).

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Preparation of Monkey iPS-RPE Cells
We prepared two iPSCs from normal cynomolgus monkey (HT-1
or Cyn46), 1121A1 iPSCs from HT-1 MHC homozygote monkey,
and 46a iPSCs from Cyn46 MHC heterozygote monkey as a
control. The monkey iPSCs were established from cynomolgus
monkeys as previously described using OCT3/4, SOX2, c-MYC,
and KLF4 (Okamoto and Takahashi, 2011). To differentiate into
RPE cells, we cultured monkey iPSCs on gelatin-coated dishes
using Glasgow’s minimal essential medium (GMEM) supple-
mented as previously described (Kamao et al., 2014; Sugita
et
al.,
2015).
Signal
inhibitors
Y-27632
(10
mM,
Wako),
SB431542 (5 mM, Sigma), and CKI-7 (3 mM, Sigma) were added
to the GMEM (Kamao et al., 2014; Sugita et al., 2015). After the
appearance of pigment epithelium-like colonies, the medium
was switched to DMEM/F12 medium with B27 supplement
(Invitrogen). In qRT-PCR analysis, these monkey iPS-RPE cells ex-
pressed mRNA for specific makers for primary RPE cells such as
RPE65, Pax6, tyrosinase, transforming growth factor b1, b2, and
b3, PEDF, and vascular endothelial growth factor, but not Nanog
and Lin28 (data not shown).
The care and maintenance of the monkeys conformed to the
ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision
Research, and the Use of Laboratory Animals, as well as to the
Guidelines of the RIKEN CDB Animal Experiment Committee.
Transplantation of iPS-RPE Cells into the Subretinal
Space of Monkeys
MHC-controlled monkeys (DrpZ1, 10, 17: adult cynomolgus
monkeys/Macaca fascicularis) were purchased from Ina Research.
Normal control cynomolgus monkeys (K-151, K-177, K-247,
S2-4, S3-2) were purchased from Shin Nippon Biomedical Labora-
tories. The MHC-controlled monkeys or normal control monkeys
were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine, and
their pupils were dilated with 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenyl-
ephrine hydrochloride. For transplantation of iPS-RPE cells/sheets
(MHC near-homozygote 1121A1 iPS-RPE cells), after induction of
posterior vitreous detachment by active suction, a complete vitrec-
tomy was performed (Accurus, Alcon) (Kamao et al., 2014). The
transplantation site was enlarged with a subretinal injection
cannula (Synergetics) and vitreoretinal scissors to enable implanta-
tion of iPS-RPE cells, and another retinotomy site for drainage was
created by the cannula and scissors. The iPS-RPE cells/sheets were
transplanted into the subretinal space, as previously described in
detail (Kamao et al., 2014). The graft cells were monitored by color
fundus photographs, FA (both RetCamII and Clarity) and OCT
(Nidek) at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery and at 6 months
after surgery.
MHC Typing
The results of MHC-allele typing are described in Table S1. Geno-
typing of MHC-1 and MHC-II genes in M. fascicularis (cynomolgus
monkeys) was performed by pyrosequencing as described in our
recent report (Shiina et al., 2015). The MHC information for the
MHC near-homozygote monkeys was described in the previous
report (Shiina et al., 2015).
Mixed Lymphocyte Reactions with iPS-RPE Cells
PBMCs were isolated from healthy adult monkey donors, and
allogeneic immune responses were assessed for proliferation by
Ki-67 incorporation in the PBMCs. PBMCs were cultured with
iPS-RPE cells (1121A1 or 46a) and monkey B cells. As a positive
control, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (B95-8 B cells) that
are MHC-I+, MHC-II+, CD40+, and CD86+ were also prepared. The
culture medium used was RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), human recombinant inter-
leukin-2 (Becton Dickinson), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.1 mM
nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma),
penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), and 1 3 10�5 M 2-mercaptoetha-
nol (Sigma). Before the assay, the target RPE cells or B cells were
irradiated (20 Gy). After 96–120 hr, PBMCs were washed and
analyzed by flow cytometry (Ki-67 proliferation assay by fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting [FACS]). The PBMC-RPE MLR assay
was also performed with similar methods (Kamao et al., 2014).
In Vitro T Cell RPE Rejection Assay
T cells were established from normal monkey PBMCs. Monkey
CD4+ T cells were prepared separately by using separation beads
(MACS cell isolation kit, Miltenyi Biotec). These cells were more
than 95% CD4-positive. Purified CD4+ T cells (5–8 3 105 cells/well
in 96-well plates) from the PBMCs of healthy donors were co-cul-
tured with target iPS-RPE cells (5–8 3 103 cells/well: effector/target
ratio = 100:1) for 48 hr. In some in vitro assays, T cells from the
PBMCs of a healthy donor (K251) were co-cultured with iPS-RPE
cells in the presence of anti-B7-H3 abs (CD276, BioLegend) or iso-
type-control mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (purified mouse
IgG1, BioLegend). T cell activation was evaluated by measurement
of monkey IFN-g production by using ELISA (Mabtech).
Flow Cytometry
Expression of MHC-I and MHC-II on monkey iPS-RPE cells
(1121A1 or 46a) was examined by FACS analysis. Before staining,
these cells were incubated with an Fc block (Miltenyi Biotec) at
4�C for 15 min. The cells were stained with anti-MHC-I antibody,
anti-MHC-II antibody, or isotype control (mouse IgG) at 4�C for
30 min. iPS-RPE cells co-cultured with recombinant IFN-g
(100 ng/mL) for 48 hr were also prepared. Expression of co-stimu-
latory molecules on these iPS-RPE cells was also examined by FACS
analysis of CD40, CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), CD275 (ICOS-L/
B7-H2), and CD276 (B7-H3). The cells were stained with the above
antibody or isotype control at 4�C for 30 min.
Expression of RPE65, bestrophin, MerTk, MiTF, Pax6, ZO-1,
PEDF, tyrosinase, and OCT3/4 by monkey iPS-RPE cells (1121A1
or 46a) was evaluated by FACS analysis. After Fc block staining,
these RPE cells were stained with anti-human antibodies (Table
S3) at 4�C for 30 min. RPE cells were also stained with anti-rabbit
IgG or anti-mouse IgG (isotype controls) at 4�C for 30 min.
To confirm phagocytic function, we cultured 1121A1 iPS-RPE
cells with RPE medium in the presence of fluorescein isothiocya-
nate
(FITC)-labeled
porcine
shed
photoreceptor
rod
outer
segments for 5 hr at 37�C, and phagocytosis was evaluated by
FACS (Sugita et al., 2015).
In the Ki-67 proliferation assay by FACS analysis, the following
antibodies were prepared: APC-labeled anti-CD4 (helper T cells),
646
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 7 j 635–648 j October 11, 2016
 APC-labeled anti-CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), APC-labeled anti-CD11b
(macrophages/monocytes), FITC-labeled anti-CD20 (B cells), FITC-
labeled anti-CD56 (NK cells/NKTcells), and phycoerythrin-labeled
anti-Ki-67. The harvested PBMCs and PBMCs co-cultured with iPS-
RPE cells (or B cells) were stained with these antibodies at 4�C for
30 min. For intracellular staining for Ki-67, the staining was per-
formed after cell fixation and permeabilization (BioLegend). All
antibody information including isotype controls is described in Ta-
ble S3. All samples were analyzed on a FACSCanto flow cytometer
(BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 9.3.1).
Immunohistochemistry
Monkey eyes collected at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, or 6 months were
fixed and embedded in paraffin (Sigma-Aldrich). Paraffin sections
were sliced into 10-mm-thick sections in a series of five sequential
slides by using an autoslide preparation system (Kurabo; http://
www.kurabo.co.jp). The same immunochemical techniques and
photographing methods as mentioned below were applied to all
sections. Sections were then blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS
for 1 hr at room temperature. Additional primary antibodies
against the following proteins were used: ionized calcium-binding
adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) (host: rabbit), CD3 (host: rabbit), and
MHC-II (host: mouse) (Table S3), and the antibodies were incu-
bated at 4�C with overnight cultures. After rinsing with Tween
20 in PBS three times, sections were incubated with appropriate
secondary antibodies (Table S3) for 1 hr at room temperature and
counterstained with DAPI (31,000; Life Technologies). Images
were acquired with a confocal microscope (LSM700, Zeiss; http://
www.zeiss.com). Each retinal layer (anatomy) in the section is
shown in Figure S5 (control section).
Statistical Evaluation
At least three independent experiments were performed for in
vitro data. All statistical analyses were performed with the paired
Student’s t test. Values were considered statistically significant if
p was less than 0.05.
