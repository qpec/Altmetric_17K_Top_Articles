Energy drinks (ED) are nonalcoholic beverages that have caffeine as their most common active substance. The rapid expansion of
ED consumption has created concern in the scientific community as well as in the public opinion. We report a psychotic episode
probably triggered by ED abuse in a young adult without previous psychotic disorders. We have reviewed the literature regarding
the relationship between caffeine, energy drinks, and psychopathology. Few articles have been published about mental health effects
of energy drinks and caffeine abuse. Nevertheless, this relationship has been suggested, specifically with anxiety disorders, manic
episodes, suicide attempts, psychotic decompensation, and substance use disorder. ED consumption could represent a global public
health problem because of the potential severe adverse effects in mental and physical health. To our knowledge, this article is
probably the first case of psychosis related to ED abuse in an individual without previous psychotic disorders.
1. Introduction
ED constitute a relatively new product category in the
wide soft drink market. The category includes a variety of
nonalcoholic beverages marketed for their perceived effects
as stimulants, energizers, and performance enhancers. The
most common substance in ED is caffeine, which is often
combined with taurine, D-glucurono-y-lactone, guaran´
a,
maltodextrin, ginseng, carnitine, creatine, and gingko biloba;
other common ingredients are vitamins and artificial and
natural sweeteners [1]. Hundreds of different brands are now
marketed with significant variation in their caffeine content
(ranging from a modest 50 mg to an alarming 505 mg per can
or bottle) and caffeine concentration (ranging from 2.5 mg
to 17.1 mg per fluid ounce). The acute and long-term effects
resulting from excessive and chronic consumption of ED are
not yet fully known [2, 3].
The rapid expansion of ED consumption has created
concern in the scientific community as well as in the
public opinion. Available information suggests that ED
consumption is becoming more and more widespread among
young individuals, especially in relation to entertainment
and sports practice. In the European Union, the highest
prevalence of consumption was observed in the adolescent
age group, with 68% having consumed at least once in 2012.
However, prevalence of consumption in adults was 30% and
in children was 18% [4, 5].
Caffeine seems to be the main ED compound to produce
a stimulant effect [6, 7]. Caffeine can influence the activity
of neuronal control pathways in the peripheral and central
nervous system (CNS). The neuropsychiatric effects of caf-
feine are mediated by antagonism of adenosine A1 and A2A
receptors in the CNS. As adenosine inhibits dopaminergic
neurotransmission, blockage of A2A receptors by caffeine may
increase dopaminergic activity. Antagonism of A1 receptors
regulates the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate
or acetylcholine. Caffeine differs from classical substances of
misuse in causing dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex
rather than the nucleus accumbens [8].

Case Reports in Psychiatry
2. Clinical Case
The patient was an 18-year-old Spanish male with no relevant
medical or psychiatric history. Regarding his substance use,
he admitted daily use of tobacco (20 cigarettes/day, meeting
criteria for tobacco use disorder), daily use of cannabis (3
cannabis cigarettes/day, meeting criteria for cannabis use
disorder), and occasionally weekend drinking (no meeting
criteria for alcohol use disorder). He denied consumption of
other psychoactive substances. As for his family background
there was a paternal uncle with an unspecified chronic mental
illness.
He was admitted to a psychiatry ward after presenting
with an acute psychotic episode. The clinical picture included
delusions of reference and persecution, pressured speech,
increased alertness, fright, suspiciousness, marked anxiety,
and psychomotor agitation during previous days. Halluci-
nations were not identified. He was aware and oriented in
person, place, and time. Over the previous week, he had felt
very nervous due to the proximity of high school exams. Thus,
he had been drinking about 6 ED cans (80 mg caffeine per
can) per day during the last seven days. Also, he had been
sleeping less than three hours per night in this period, until
finally he showed global insomnia during the day prior to
hospital admission. He denied increasing cannabis smoking
in these days or consumption of other substances.
During his first day in the inpatient unit he presented
severe acute psychomotor agitation that required mechanical
restraint and high doses of medication (first olanzapine 20 mg
oral, followed by haloperidol 5 mg and levomepromazine
25 mg intramuscularly). After these treatments he exhibited
low awareness and the ECG showed sinus bradycardia and
QTc prolongation. He stayed 24 hours in the intensive care
unit until his ECG was normalized and he recovered good
awareness level. Urinary drug screening test was positive
for cannabinoids and negative for opioids, benzodiazepines,
cocaine, amphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, and barbi-
turates. Additional tests (cranial CT and blood tests) were
normal.
The patient returned to the psychiatry ward and was
treated with olanzapine 10 mg daily and there was cessation of
caffeinated drinks. After three days, psychotic symptomatol-
ogy had disappeared and he was discharged with diagnosis of
Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder (according to DSM-5
classification) relative to stimulants (ED) and cannabis. He
was followed up at a mental health outpatient setting with
positive global evolution. He remained abstinent to cannabis
and ED. Antipsychotic treatment was gradually reduced and
he was finally discharged of mental health service without
pharmacological treatment two years later.
3. Discussion
Five caffeine-related syndromes are recognized in the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-5) [9]; however, the International Classification of
Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) is less specific and only
recognizes “mental and behavioural disorders due to use of
other stimulants, including caffeine” [8] (Table 1).
Table 1: Caffeine-related syndromes in DSM-5 and ICD-10.
DSM-5
ICD-10
(1) Caffeine-induced sleep disorder (F15.182,
F15.282, F15.982)

behavioural disorders
due to use of other
stimulants, including
caffeine (F15)
(2) Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder
(F15.180, F15.280, F15.980)
(3) Caffeine intoxication (F15.929)
(4) Caffeine withdrawal (F15.93)
(5) Unspecified caffeine-related disorder
(F15.99)
Caffeine intake has been linked as a potential risk factor
for a wide range of psychiatric and substance use disorders.
A genetic factor seems to predispose people to both caffeine
intake and the risk for psychiatric disorders [10]. For example,
it has been described that individuals with the 1976T/T
genotypes for A2A adenosine receptors showed higher levels
of anxiety after caffeine administration than other genotypic
groups [11, 12].
Some studies have demonstrated that the intake of large
amounts of caffeine is associated with psychotic and manic
symptoms and/or exacerbation of previous psychotic symp-
toms [13]. Case reports have also suggested that excessive
caffeine intake may hamper the recovery of patients with
bipolar disorder or manic-type mood episodes. For this
reason, several guidelines recommend discontinuation of
caffeine intake as one of the first steps in the treatment of
mania [7].
Case report evidence suggests that caffeine might induce
psychotic symptoms also in some individuals without previ-
ous psychotic disorders, but this has not yet been confirmed.
This may result from an exacerbation of underlying paranoid
traits. Also, reduction of caffeine intake has been associated
with symptom improvement in patients with psychotic disor-
ders [7]. Individuals with a predisposition to psychosis may
have a greater disposition or demonstrate a lower threshold to
develop psychopathology following ingestion of caffeine [14].
Recently, case reports of psychopathology related to ED
consumption have been reported (Table 2).
Initial evidence to suggest that ED use can be associated
with the occurrence/reoccurrence of psychiatric symptoms
comes from these case reports. Although these cases imply
that excessive consumption of energy drinks may act as a trig-
ger for relapse in certain vulnerable people with preexisting
mental health problems, cases have also emerged in which
serious psychiatric symptoms have occurred in otherwise
healthy individuals [15].
In a recent study, Marmorstein [16] examined the associa-
tion between ED and coffee consumption and psychopathol-
ogy among early teenagers. The author studied symptoms
of depression, anxiety, conduct disorder (CD), and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and found that ED
and coffee consumption were concurrently associated with
similar psychopathology symptoms. However, longitudinally,
the associations between these beverages and psychopathol-
ogy differed. Specifically, ED consumption at the initial

assessment predicted increases in CD and ADHD rates.
Conversely, initial levels of ADHD hyperactivity symptoms
predicted later increases in coffee consumption, while social
anxiety was protective against increases in energy drink
consumption [16].
Richards and Smith [15] have recently reviewed the
literature about the chronic effects of ED on mental health.
They concluded that although acute mood effects associated
with ED appear often to be positive, chronic use also tends
to be associated with undesirable mental health effects such
as stress, anxiety, and depression. However, as almost all
identified studies were cross-sectional and some did not
control for other relevant factors such as sex, socioeconomic
status, and additional caffeine intake, the nature of this
relationship is not yet fully understood [15].
In this case report we hypothesize that psychotic symp-
toms could be related to the excessive consumption of ED
during the days prior to hospitalization. Review of the topic
shows similar case reports although there is not enough
literature yet about the psychiatric effects of ED. Otherwise,
we have to take into account other important factors that
could play an important role in this case. These relevant
factors are cannabis use disorder and sleep deprivation. Both
have been linked with psychosis in several researches and,
therefore, they have been able to contribute as etiologic and
pathogenic factors.
Current cannabis abuse or dependence increases the risk
of transition into psychosis in persons at ultrahigh risk of
psychosis [17, 18]. There have been few studies addressing
the effects of caffeine and cannabis in combination, but they
have been focused on their combined effects on memory but
not in psychosis [19]. Our patient met criteria for cannabis
use disorder and is important to take it into account in
this psychotic process. However, psychotic symptoms only
appeared after the excessive consumption of ED and, thus,
cannabis could not be considered as unique etiologic factor.
Excessive intake of caffeinated ED leads to sleep depriva-
tion [20], which also has implications for psychotic pathogen-
esis. Sleep deprivation has been associated with an increase
in self-reported psychiatric symptoms, including somatic
complaints, anxiety, depression, mania, and paranoia [21].
Insomnia symptoms have also been related to higher levels
 4
Case Reports in Psychiatry
of persecutory thoughts, even in the general population
[22]. Recently, another study has shown that sleep depriva-
tion induces sensorimotor gating deficits and elevated self-
reported psychosis-like experiences in healthy humans [23].
In our case report, sleep deprivation is probably consequence
of excessive consumption of ED and excessive tension due to
exam stress. This effect, in accordance with the other relevant
factors, has been able to influence the emergence of psychotic
symptoms.
It is also remarkable that the patient suffered a severe
cardiovascular complication (sinus bradycardia and QTc
prolongation) after antipsychotic drug administration. A
possible QTc prolongation secondary to antipsychotic drugs
is well-known [24, 25]. However, cardiovascular effects,
such as supraventricular tachycardia, long QT syndrome,
or myocardial infarction, have also been described after
ED intake [26–29]. In addition, a number of investigations
have focused on the hemodynamic effects and endothelial
functions of the consumption of energy drinks [30–33]. For
this reason we hypothesize that the complication described
in our patient could be multifactorial and not only related to
antipsychotic drugs.
4. Conclusions
To our knowledge this case report is probably the first case of
psychosis related to ED abuse in a patient without a previous
diagnosis of psychotic disorder. ED abuse likely played the
most important role in the pathogenesis of psychosis in this
case report; however, other factors, such as cannabis use
disorder, genetic factors, and sleep deprivation, were probably
relevant and facilitated the process.
ED consumption could represent a global public health
problem because of its potential severe adverse events. Few
articles have been published on this important matter. The
general public and potentially vulnerable users, such as
adolescents, should be advised that caution is warranted
when using these drinks, especially in large quantities over
short periods of time or mixed with cannabis, alcohol, or
other substances. More research is needed to determine
the potential health and mental effects associated with ED
consumption.
