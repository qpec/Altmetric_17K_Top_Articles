Abstract
IMPORTANCE Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the syndrome for which antibiotics are most
commonly prescribed; viruses for which antibiotics are ineffective cause most ARIs.
OBJECTIVES To characterize antibiotic prescribing among outpatients with ARI during influenza
season and to identify targets for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for common ARI
diagnoses, including among outpatients with laboratory-confirmed influenza.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study enrolling outpatients aged 6 months or older
with ARI evaluated at outpatient clinics associated with 5 US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness
Network sites during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons. All patients received influenza
testing by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction for research purposes only.
Antibiotic prescriptions, medical history, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
diagnosis codes were collected from medical and pharmacy records, as were group A streptococcal
(GAS) testing results in a patient subset.
EXPOSURE Visit for ARI, defined by a new cough of 7 days’duration or less.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Antibiotic prescription within 7 days of enrollment.
Appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was based on diagnosis codes, clinical information, and
influenza and GAS testing results.
RESULTS Of 14 987 patients with ARI (mean [SD] age, 32 [24] years; 8638 [58%] women; 11 892
[80%] white), 6136 (41%) were prescribed an antibiotic. Among these 6136 patients, 2522 (41%) had
diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated; 2106 (84%) of these patients were diagnosed as
having a viral upper respiratory tract infection or bronchitis (acute or not otherwise specified).
Among the 3306 patients (22%) not diagnosed as having pneumonia and who had laboratory-
confirmed influenza, 945 (29%) were prescribed an antibiotic, accounting for 17% of all antibiotic
prescriptions among patients with nonpneumonia ARI. Among 1248 patients with pharyngitis, 1137
(91%) had GAS testing; 440 of the 1248 patients (35%) were prescribed antibiotics, among whom
168 (38%) had negative results on GAS testing. Of 1200 patients with sinusitis and no other
indication for antibiotic treatment who received an antibiotic, 454 (38%) had symptoms for 3 days
or less prior to the outpatient visit, suggesting acute viral sinusitis not requiring antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antibiotic overuse remains widespread in the treatment of
outpatient ARIs, including among patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, although study sites
may not be representative of other outpatient settings. Identified targets for improved outpatient

Key Points
Question What are targets for
improving antibiotic stewardship for
outpatient acute respiratory infections?
Findings Among 14 987 outpatients
with acute respiratory infections
enrolled in this cohort study during
influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed
antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses
for which antibiotics are not indicated,
primarily viral upper respiratory tract
infections and bronchitis; 29% of
patients with influenza confirmed
through research testing were
prescribed antibiotics. Among patients
prescribed antibiotics, 38% with
pharyngitis tested negative for group A
streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis
had symptoms for 3 days or less before
the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy
was not required.
Meaning Eliminating antibiotic
treatment of viral upper respiratory tract
infections and bronchitis, improving
influenza diagnosis and treatment, and
reinforcing prescription guidelines for
pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve
outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

 Abstract (continued)
antibiotic stewardship include eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract
infections and bronchitis and improving adherence to prescribing guidelines for pharyngitis and
sinusitis. Increased access to sensitive and timely virus diagnostic tests, particularly for influenza,
may reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for these syndromes.

Introduction
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain the clinical category for which antibiotics are most
commonly prescribed.1,2 However, most ARIs are caused by viruses for which antibiotics have no role
in treatment. Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant
organisms, which cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23 000 deaths annually in the United
States.3 Understanding antibiotic prescribing practices for ARIs in outpatient settings is critical to
designing strategies for reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.
Previous studies examining antibiotic overuse have relied on national survey data, and many
lack clinical and laboratory testing results.2,4-7 In this study, we include data on illness onset date,
laboratory testing for influenza in all patients, and, for many patients, self-reported fever and the
results of clinician-ordered group A streptococcal (GAS) testing. We used 3 approaches to assess
antibiotic prescribing among outpatients with ARIs during the influenza season. First, we examined
antibiotic prescribing by age group, antibiotic type, and diagnosis. Second, because influenza is a
frequent cause of ARIs, sensitive point-of-care influenza testing is not widely available,8,9 and
individuals with influenza are often inappropriately prescribed antibiotics,10 we characterized
antibiotic prescribing among those with laboratory-confirmed influenza, excluding syndromes for
which antibiotics are indicated (eg, pneumonia). Third, we examined appropriateness of antibiotic
prescribing for those with pharyngitis, sinusitis, and otitis media (OM), diagnoses that account for
nearly one-third of prescribed outpatient antibiotics,2 based on symptom duration, presence of
fever, prescription of recommended first-line antibiotics,4 and GAS testing results.
Methods
Enrollment
In this cohort study, we used data collected by the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network
during the 2013-2014 (defined here as December 2, 2013, through April 16, 2014) and 2014-2015
(defined here as November 10, 2014, through April 10, 2015) influenza seasons, as described
elsewhere.11 The network, which included 57 (2013-2014) and 66 (2014-2015) clinics associated with
5 sites that are geographically diverse academic medical centers and health care organizations, was
designed to assess influenza vaccine effectiveness annually; additional data were collected for this
secondary analysis. Once sites confirmed local influenza circulation, patients aged 6 months or older
with ARI, defined by a new cough of 7 days’duration or less, were eligible for enrollment. Respiratory
swab specimens were obtained and tested for influenza with real-time reverse transcriptase–
polymerase chain reaction for research purposes only. Patients could enroll more than once per
season more than 14 days apart; we analyzed each patient visit separately. Eligible patients were
screened and enrolled if they or their legal guardians provided written or oral informed consent,
depending on requirements of local institutional review boards. Study procedures, forms, and
consent documents were approved by site institutional review boards.
Patient characteristics, including self-reported race and ethnicity selected from options defined
by the investigator, and symptom onset date were ascertained by interview. In addition, patients
were asked about self-reported fever at 2 sites in 2013-2014 and all sites in 2014-2015. We obtained
patients’history of underlying medical conditions by examining International Classification of

 Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes assigned to medical encounters during the year before
enrollment. We extracted dates of hospitalizations occurring less than 30 days after enrollment from
medical records. Excluding topical antibiotics, we obtained antibiotic and influenza antiviral
prescriptions within 7 days of enrollment from pharmacy, insurance, or electronic medical records.
Patients were excluded if dates indicated antibiotics were first prescribed during a hospitalization. If
more than 1 antibiotic was prescribed, the antibiotic with the earliest prescription date was included.
Diagnostic Categories
We classified the first 4 ICD-9 codes assigned to the enrollment visit into 3 tiers based on previously
published classifications (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Tier 1 includes diagnoses for which antibiotics
are almost always indicated, including pneumonia; per Infectious Diseases Society of America/
American Thoracic Society guidelines, empirical antibiotic treatment is appropriate for persons with
pneumonia, regardless of the etiology.12 Tier 2 includes diagnoses for which antibiotics may be
indicated, eg, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and suppurative OM. Tier 3 includes all other diagnoses for which
antibiotics are not indicated or the indication was unclear; these include viral upper respiratory tract
infection (URI), influenza, allergy, asthma, and acute bronchitis.2 Because current guidance
recommends antibiotic treatment for some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) exacerbations,13 adults with a history of COPD or COPD diagnosis code at enrollment were
excluded from bronchitis analyses. We excluded patients missing ICD-9 codes or assigned diagnostic
codes compatible with nonrespiratory diagnoses for which antibiotics are potentially indicated (eg,
urinary tract infection). If a patient had multiple diagnoses, priority was given to tier 1 diagnoses, then
tier 2 diagnoses, then tier 3 diagnoses.
Antibiotic Classification
We classified antibiotics based on previously established categories.14 Narrow-spectrum antibiotics
included narrow-spectrum penicillins, tetracyclines, first-generation cephalosporins, and
sulfonamides. Broad-spectrum antibiotics included macrolides (eg, azithromycin), broad-spectrum
penicillins (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate), advanced-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, and
lincomycin derivatives (clindamycin). We examined whether clinicians prescribed first-line antibiotics
for the most common tier 2 diagnoses, based on national guidelines: penicillin or amoxicillin for
pharyngitis, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for sinusitis, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-
clavulanate (alternative) for suppurative OM.4,15-19
Influenza Testing
At 1 site, clinicians were provided study real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
results for influenza within 48 hours of enrollment. Results were not available to clinicians at other
sites. At 4 sites, we examined data on rapid influenza diagnostic tests or other diagnostic tests
ordered the day of enrollment and not performed as part of the study protocol.
Pharyngitis and GAS Testing
For pharyngitis, guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy only for GAS pharyngitis and diagnostic
testing if GAS is suspected.20 We examined a GAS testing subset comprising patients with a
pharyngitis diagnosis with no other diagnosis for which antibiotics may be warranted at 4 sites during
the 2014-2015 season for whom we obtained information from medical records on clinician-ordered
GAS testing. Rapid antigen detection test results were available at all sites, and some sites performed
cultures when rapid antigen detection test results were negative. If a patient had positive results on
either the GAS rapid antigen detection test or culture, the patient was considered GAS positive. The
proportion of patients in the entire study population with pharyngitis who were prescribed an
antibiotic despite a negative result on GAS testing was estimated based on results from the GAS
testing subset.

 Sinusitis and OM
For sinusitis, national guidelines recommend antibiotics for adults and children with severe
symptoms, defined by a temperature of 39°C or higher, purulent nasal discharge, or facial pain, for at
least 3 consecutive days; worsening course after initial improvement; or persistent illness (symptoms
lasting �10 days).16-18 Among patients with sinusitis and suppurative OM,15 we examined antibiotic
prescribing and its relationship to the timing of symptom onset and self-reported fever, when
available.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical data were analyzed with a χ2 test. We used logistic regression to develop 2 models with
predictors of antibiotic prescribing. A model examining antibiotic prescribing among those with only
tier 3 diagnoses adjusted for sex, site, age group, race, number of chronic conditions, time from
symptom onset to presentation for care, and clinical diagnosis. A model that examined antibiotic
prescribing among those with laboratory-confirmed influenza adjusted for sex, site, age group,
number of chronic medical conditions, time from symptom onset, clinical diagnosis, and presence of
fever. Variables with 2-sided P < .20 on univariate analysis were included in multivariable analyses
and subjected to model-fitting procedures. A 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 statistical software
(SAS Institute Inc).
Results
During the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons, we enrolled 15 714 patients. Among these,
727 were excluded: 126 had missing ICD-9 codes, 118 were prescribed an antibiotic while hospitalized,
and 483 were diagnosed with a nonrespiratory condition for which antibiotics are potentially
indicated. Among the 14 987 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 32 (24) years, 8638 (58%)
were women, and 11 892 (80%) were white (Table 1). The 14 987 included patient visits had a mean
(SD) of 2.0 (1.2) ICD-9 codes; 338 (2%) had at least 5 codes, less than 1% of which had additional
codes indicating tier 1 or tier 2 diagnoses. Results were unchanged when we analyzed all
diagnosis codes.
Among 14 987 patient visits analyzed, 6136 (41%) were associated with an antibiotic
prescription, including 3423 (56%) with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Five drugs accounted for 90%
of antibiotic prescriptions: azithromycin (37%), amoxicillin (35%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (10%),
doxycycline (5%), and levofloxacin (3%) (Figure 1). Macrolides were most frequently prescribed in
adults; 960 of 4339 adults (22%) aged 50 years or older were prescribed azithromycin, regardless of
clinical diagnosis, symptoms, symptom duration, or laboratory findings.
Influenza and Antibiotic Prescribing
Influenza was confirmed through research testing in 3381 patients (23%), 902 (27%) of whom
received a clinical diagnosis code for influenza. Excluding those with a tier 1 diagnosis, among 3306
patients (22%) with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 945 (29%) were prescribed an antibiotic,
accounting for 17% of all antibiotic prescriptions among patients with nonpneumonia ARI; 656
(20%) were prescribed an influenza antiviral medication, including 89 prescribed both antibiotic and
antiviral medications. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was detected in 72 of 375 patients (16%)
diagnosed as having pneumonia, 446 of 2065 patients (18%) with pharyngitis, 129 of 1099 patients
(11%) with suppurative OM, and 227 of 1486 patients (13%) with sinusitis; the proportion with
laboratory-confirmed influenza among those prescribed antibiotics is shown in Figure 2. In a
multivariable model among those with laboratory-confirmed influenza, antibiotic prescribing was
significantly associated with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 145.74;
95% CI, 34.37-617.82), sinusitis (AOR = 15.34; 95% CI, 9.83-23.94), OM (AOR = 71.77; 95% CI,
30.00-171.71), and bronchitis (AOR = 4.60; 95% CI, 3.27-6.47), but not pharyngitis (AOR = 1.23; 95%

Antibiotic Prescribing Without an Appropriate Indication (Tier 3 Diagnoses)
Among 6136 patients who received antibiotic prescriptions, 2522 (41%) had only diagnoses for which
antibiotics are not indicated (tier 3) (Table 2; eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The proportion of
patients with only tier 3 diagnoses who were prescribed antibiotics increased with increasing age:
25%, 46%, and 65% of antibiotic prescriptions among those younger than 18 years, 18 to 64 years,
and 65 years or older, respectively (P < .01). Azithromycin was the most commonly prescribed
antibiotic given to adults who lacked a diagnosis for which antibiotics are indicated; among the 3186
adults aged 50 years and older with no clinical indication for antibiotics (tier 3 diagnoses only), 1183
(37%) received an antibiotic prescription; 688 (58%) of these prescriptions were for azithromycin.
Among the 2522 patients with tier 3 diagnoses prescribed an antibiotic, 2106 (84%) were
diagnosed as having either a viral URI or bronchitis (acute or not otherwise specified). Among 5553

 patients with a viral URI diagnosis, 1376 (25%) received an antibiotic, accounting for 22% of all
antibiotic prescriptions (Figure 2). Excluding patients with COPD, 1157 persons were assigned a
diagnosis for bronchitis; 730 (63%) received an antibiotic, accounting for 12% of all antibiotic
prescriptions. In a multivariable model among those with only tier 3 diagnoses, antibiotic prescribing
was most strongly associated with a diagnosis of bronchitis (AOR = 4.71; 95% CI, 3.82-5.80)
(Figure 3). Other factors associated with antibiotic prescribing include site, longer symptom
duration, older age, at least 1 chronic medical condition, worse self-rated health, and fever. Black
patients were significantly less likely to be prescribed antibiotics than white patients (AOR= 0.60;
95% CI, 0.48-0.76; P < .001). Both a clinical diagnosis of influenza and laboratory-confirmed
influenza through research testing were significantly associated with decreased odds of an antibiotic
prescription (clinical diagnosis: AOR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.25-0.42; laboratory-confirmed diagnosis:
AOR = 0.62; 0.54-0.71).
Pharyngitis, Sinusitis, and OM (Tier 2 Diagnoses)
The 3 most frequent diagnoses for which antibiotics are potentially indicated (tier 2 diagnoses) were
pharyngitis (diagnosed in 2494 patients [17%]), sinusitis (1707 patients [11%]), and suppurative OM
(1212 patients [8%]), which together accounted for 52% of all antibiotics prescribed. Among 3198
persons who received antibiotics for these diagnoses, 2050 (64%) received first-line antibiotics
(eFigure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Pharyngitis accounted for 16% of antibiotic prescriptions. Among 1000 of 2494 patients (40%)
with a pharyngitis diagnosis who received an antibiotic, 122 (12%) had laboratory-confirmed
influenza (Figure 2; eTable 2 in the Supplement). Among the 1248 patients assigned a pharyngitis

A total of 440 patients with pharyngitis (35%) were prescribed an antibiotic, among whom 208
(47%) lacked a positive GAS test, either because they did not have testing performed (40 patients
[9%]) or their test result was negative (168 patients [38%]) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). An
estimated 327 of 860 patients (38%) in the entire study population with only a pharyngitis diagnosis
were given an antibiotic prescription despite a negative GAS test result.
Among 1707 patients assigned a sinusitis diagnosis, 1385 (81%) were prescribed antibiotics, 188
(14%) of whom had laboratory-confirmed influenza (Figure 2; eTable 2 in the Supplement). Among
the 1295 patients diagnosed as having sinusitis for whom fever information was collected, 1087
(84%) were prescribed an antibiotic; 558 (51%) reported a fever, whereas 203 (19%) had neither
fever nor symptom duration longer than 3 days. Among patients with sinusitis and no other
indication for antibiotic treatment who received an antibiotic, the median time from symptom onset
to prescription date was 4 days (interquartile range, 3-6 days); 454 of 1200 patients (38%) were

 prescribed an antibiotic within 3 days following symptom onset, a proportion that was unchanged
when these patients were stratified by fever status.
Suppurative OM accounted for 17% of antibiotic prescriptions, including 41% of those in
children and 4% in adults. Among 1055 persons with this diagnosis prescribed an antibiotic, 121 (11%)
had laboratory-confirmed influenza (Figure 2; eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Among all 6136 patients with antibiotic prescriptions, we estimated 3303 (54%) likely did not
meet clinical criteria or laboratory criteria for GAS pharyngitis for antibiotic treatment. Of these 6136
patients, 2522 (41%) had only clinical diagnoses that do not warrant antibiotics (tier 3 diagnoses
only), 454 (7%) had sinusitis that did not meet clinical criteria, and an estimated 327 (5%) had
pharyngitis with a negative GAS test result. Among the remaining 2833 patients given antibiotic
prescriptions who had a clinical diagnosis for which antibiotic therapy may be indicated (eg,
suppurative OM, pharyngitis, or sinusitis), an additional 369 (13%) had influenza virus infection
confirmed through research testing and likely did not benefit from antibiotic therapy.
Discussion
Antibiotics were likely prescribed inappropriately to a majority of the nearly 15 000 outpatients in
this study who presented during influenza season with symptoms of a broadly defined ARI
characterized by cough. Among all patients prescribed antibiotics, 41% lacked a diagnosis code for
which antibiotic therapy is potentially indicated. Those with influenza confirmed through research
testing accounted for a substantial proportion (17%) of all antibiotics prescribed; fewer than
one-third of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were given a clinical diagnosis of influenza.
Patients with influenza virus infection accounted for a substantial proportion of those given
antibiotics for diagnoses for which antibiotics may be appropriate, including pharyngitis (12%),
sinusitis (14%), and suppurative OM (11%), although most patients with influenza are unlikely to
benefit from antibiotic treatment. In addition, among those patients given diagnoses for which
antibiotic therapy may be appropriate, many patients prescribed antibiotics likely did not meet
criteria for antibiotic therapy based on clinician-ordered laboratory testing and clinical criteria,
including 47% of those with a pharyngitis diagnosis and 38% with a sinusitis diagnosis.
Our study is consistent with previous studies that indicate clinicians overprescribe antibiotics
for outpatient ARIs. These studies used national survey data, which lack detailed clinical data,
including laboratory testing results.2,4-7 We used a sensitive clinical definition of ARI and had data
including illness onset date, laboratory confirmation of influenza, and, for many patients, self-
reported fever and the results of clinician-ordered GAS testing. As noted in previous studies,2,6 we
found that a substantial proportion of antibiotic overuse was driven by prescribing for conditions for
which antibiotics were not indicated, including viral URIs and acute bronchitis.19 Our results also
suggest antibiotics were frequently overprescribed for patients with 2 common diagnoses for which
antibiotics are potentially indicated, pharyngitis and sinusitis, underscoring that these diagnoses are
important targets for improving antibiotic use. For pharyngitis, national guidelines recommend
antibiotic therapy only for laboratory-confirmed GAS19,20; in our study, nearly half of patients
diagnosed as having pharyngitis who received antibiotics either tested negative for GAS or were not
tested. For patients with sinusitis, among those prescribed an antibiotic, 38% had symptoms for 3
days or less and most did not report fever, indicating that many patients likely did not meet clinical
criteria for antibiotic treatment as defined by national guidelines.
Older adults were more likely than younger adults and children to receive antibiotics without
diagnostic documentation of an appropriate indication and were far more likely to receive broad-
spectrum antibiotics, particularly macrolides. Azithromycin was prescribed to nearly one-quarter of
adults aged 50 years or older with an ARI, regardless of diagnosis, laboratory testing, symptom
duration, or medical history, including to 58% of those older adults given a prescription who lacked
an indication for antibiotic treatment. Azithromycin also accounted for more than one-quarter of
prescriptions among those adults diagnosed as having pharyngitis and sinusitis, even though it is not

 the first-line agent for either condition. A concerning increase in macrolide use for these conditions
has been previously noted in both adults and children.5,7 Choosing a macrolide when amoxicillin or
amoxicillin-clavulanate is the recommended first-line antibiotic is a potential patient safety issue;
GAS and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are more likely to be resistant to macrolides than to
amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. While all antibiotics have potential risks, macrolides have also
been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.21
This study was conducted during influenza seasons, and we found that 17% of patients with ARI
prescribed antibiotics had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Influenza can predispose patients to
increased risk of bacterial coinfections. In some instances of influenza infection, antibiotics may be
appropriately prescribed if an associated bacterial infection is suspected. However, bacterial
coinfection was likely only in a minority of influenza cases.22 As in previous studies,10 we found that
patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were more likely to receive an antibiotic
than an antiviral medication. In addition, a substantial proportion of patients with diagnoses for
which antibiotics may be considered appropriate—pharyngitis, suppurative OM, and sinusitis—
actually had influenza virus infection, and depending on the clinical situation, many would likely not
benefit from antibiotic treatment. Current widely available point-of-care influenza diagnostic tests
have highly variable sensitivity8 and are not recommended for ruling out influenza infection for the
purposes of treatment decisions9; clinician-ordered testing was infrequent in this study. Clinicians
assigned an influenza diagnosis code to only one-quarter of patients with influenza confirmed
through research testing, indicating that influenza virus infections were underdiagnosed. However,
among all patients with ARI, those patients to whom clinicians assigned an influenza diagnosis were
significantly less likely to receive an antibiotic prescription. The development of sensitive and specific
point-of-care testing for influenza may assist clinicians in making treatment decisions for patients
with ARI during influenza season and may help to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for influenza in
outpatient settings.23 Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing exposes patients to the risks of
unnecessary antibiotics and represents a potential missed opportunity for patients to benefit from
influenza antiviral medications.9 Clinicians should be encouraged to consider influenza as a clinical
diagnosis during the influenza season, refrain from prescribing antibiotics in situations in which they
are not recommended by guidelines, and prescribe influenza antiviral medications when indicated.9
Limitations
This study has several limitations. We used up to 4 ICD-9 codes to determine whether antibiotics
were prescribed appropriately, but these may inaccurately reflect clinical decision making. Medical
history information may have been incomplete in some instances, and other factors may have
informed prescribing decisions. Our study sites may not be representative of other outpatient
settings; some sites are health care organizations that may have institutional prescribing policies or
mostly serve insured patients. In addition, sites have been engaged in influenza research for multiple
years, which may have influenced clinician awareness of influenza and antibiotic prescribing
practices. Of note, the proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics for conditions such as pharyngitis
and bronchitis was lower in this study compared with other studies, and assessment of antibiotic
overuse may be underestimated.2,6,7 We also assumed prescriptions were related to the study visit,
but this could not always be verified. We lacked dispensing information for several sites, limiting our
ability to know whether clinicians used delayed prescribing strategies in which patients are instructed
to fill prescriptions only if symptoms failed to improve. This could have led to an overestimation of
antibiotic use. Previous antibiotic treatment of prior infections and allergy history were not available,
both of which may have affected antibiotic choice.
Conclusions
Our study adds to evidence that misuse of antibiotics, characterized by antibiotic overuse and
inappropriate antibiotic selection, is widespread in the treatment of outpatient ARIs. The study

 indicates a number of potential targets to achieve the goal of the National Action Plan for Combating
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020.24
We must strengthen outpatient antibiotic stewardship efforts to eliminate antibiotic treatment for
viral URIs and acute bronchitis, which our study indicates would make the largest contribution to
decreasing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Increased efforts are needed to support improved
adherence to guidelines for antibiotic prescribing for common diagnoses, including more stringent
adherence to GAS pharyngitis testing guidelines and clinical criteria for antibiotic treatment of
sinusitis, as well as interventions focused on appropriate selection of first-line antibiotics for these
conditions if treatment is indicated. In addition, our findings indicate that improved point-of-care
influenza diagnostics and increased recognition and appropriate treatment of influenza virus
infection may also aid in decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use for ARIs. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention published “
Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship,”
25 which
provides guidance to clinicians and facility leadership to implement activities to improve antibiotic
use. Improving antibiotic prescribing for ARIs during the influenza season represents an important
opportunity to improve the long-term quality of patient care.
