Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 200 million people globally, and 60–80% of cases persist as a 
chronic infection that will progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer in 2–10% of patients1–3. We 
recently demonstrated that HCV induces aberrant expression of two host microRNAs (miRNAs), 
miR-208b and miR-499a-5p, encoded by myosin genes in infected hepatocytes4. These miRNAs, 
along with AU-rich-element-mediated decay, suppress IFNL2 and IFNL3, members of the type III 
interferon (IFN) gene family, to support viral persistence. In this study, we show that miR-208b 
and miR-499a-5p also dampen type I IFN signaling in HCV-infected hepatocytes by directly 
down-regulating expression of the type I IFN receptor chain, IFNAR1. Inhibition of these miRNAs 
by using miRNA inhibitors during HCV infection increased expression of IFNAR1. Additionally, 
inhibition rescued the antiviral response to exogenous type I IFN, as measured by a marked

 increase in IFN-stimulated genes and a decrease in HCV load. Treatment of HCV-infected 
hepatocytes with type I IFN increased expression of myosins over HCV infection alone. Since 
these miRNAs can suppress type III IFN family members, these data collectively define a novel 
cross-regulation between type I and III IFNs during HCV infection.
HCV is a single-stranded hepatotropic RNA virus against which no vaccine currently exists. 
Previously, the standard of care for chronic HCV infection was combination treatment with 
pegylated IFN-α (pegIFN-α) and ribavirin, which produced a sustained virological response 
in fewer than 40% of patients5. With the addition of protease inhibitors, a type of direct-
acting antiviral (DAA), to pegIFN-α and ribavirin therapy, viral cure rates have improved to 
56–95% of patients; the exact rate is dependent on both virus and host factors6–9. Following 
this success, therapeutic advancements have focused on interfering with the viral lifecycle, 
and many new DAA drugs are currently in clinical trials6,10. More recently, interferon-free 
combinations of HCV protease and RNA polymerase inhibitors, sometimes with ribavirin, 
have produced dramatic results in a subset of patients10. However, the emergence of resistant 
HCV variants and the high cost of DAA treatments might limit the availability of these 
therapies worldwide11–13. The usefulness of DAA-based therapies for some patients—such 
as those with advanced infection, who are at the highest risk for hepatic decompensation, 
liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and/or death—also remains to be fully proven13. 
Hence, it is critical to identify the mechanisms that HCV employs which lead to the failure 
of type I IFN therapy. In this study, we show that HCV dampens type I IFN signaling by 
targeting IFNAR1 mRNA expression. This novel mechanism not only provides insight into 
why IFN-based HCV therapies have failed but also suggests why the interferon lambda 3 
(IFNL3) genotype correlates with the outcome of type I IFN treatment.
Several viral and host factors are predictive of HCV clearance, including viral genotype, 
baseline viral load and host genotype. Genome-wide association studies have identified three 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the antiviral IFNL3 gene that associate with 
natural clearance of HCV14,15 and patient response to therapy14,16–18. Ensuing studies have 
since identified four genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with the primary tag 
SNPs19–21. One of these variants, rs368234815, is a dinucleotide frameshift variant that 
creates IFNL4, a gene upstream of IFNL3 (ref. 22). Paradoxically, expression of IFNL4 
correlates with viral persistence. The mechanism behind this correlation has yet to be fully 
elucidated. We identified rs4803217, located in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of 
IFNL3, as a functional SNP that determines HCV clearance by altering IFNL3 expression4. 
We further showed that the protective allele (G/G, rs4803217) increases expression of 
IFNL3 by escaping both AU-rich element-mediated decay and post-transcriptional 
regulation by HCV-induced miRNAs, miR-208b and miR-499a-5p. IFNλ3 is a potent 
antiviral cytokine that induces expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A recent 
study using ex vivo HCV-infected primary human hepatocytes demonstrated that the 
favorable IFNL3 genotype correlates with high ISG expression and subsequent antiviral 
activity in HCV-infected and adjacent cells23. In contrast, the magnitude of ISG expression 
in HCV-infected livers before IFN therapy has been shown to negatively correlate with 
response to pegIFN-α therapy24. This disparity underlines the complexity of IFN signaling

 in HCV infection, as well as how much remains to be understood about the interplay 
between virus, host and IFN therapies.
Beyond its ability to predict natural clearance of HCV, IFNL3 genotype is also the strongest 
predictor of patient response to pegIFN-α plus ribavirin therapy: patients with the 
unfavorable allele are less likely to respond to this therapy than those with the favorable 
allele14,16–18. This association between IFNL3 genotype and response to pegIFN-α therapy 
suggests a possible cross-regulation of these pathways during infection, yet the mechanisms 
guiding this are unknown.
Factors have been identified within the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the 
success of pegIFN-α and ribavirin therapy, among them the expression of IFNAR1 in the 
liver25,26. IFNAR1 is a subunit of the type I IFN receptor composed of IFNAR1 and 
IFNAR2 chains. Studies have found that patients with high hepatic IFNAR1 mRNA 
responded better to IFN therapy, whereas patients who relapsed or did not respond to IFN 
therapy had intermediate or low hepatic IFNAR1 mRNA, respectively27–31. Since these 
clinical observations, studies have demonstrated that in vitro HCV infection or treatment of 
hepatocyte cells with a HCV subgenomic replicon induces the unfolded protein or 
endoplasmic reticulum stress response in hepatoma cells that indirectly decreases IFNAR1 
protein levels32,33. While these data provide insight into one mechanism regulating IFNAR1 
surface expression during HCV infection, a mechanism that explains decreased IFNAR1 
mRNA levels in HCV infected patients has yet to be described. Moreover, no study has 
indicated a HCV-specific factor that directly reduces IFNAR1 expression.
miRNAs regulate gene expression by guiding mRNA degradation machinery to 
complementary sequences in the 3′ UTR of mRNAs34. We previously demonstrated that 
HCV infection induces expression of miR-208b and miR-499a-5p (ref. 4), two miRNAs not 
normally expressed in the liver. We hypothesized that within innate immune signaling 
pathways these miRNAs may target multiple genes in addition to IFNL2 and IFNL3. 
miR-208b and miR-499a-5p are termed “myomiRs” as they are encoded in the introns of 
two myosin-encoding genes, myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) and myosin heavy chain 7B 
(MYH7B), respectively35. Studies of miR-208b and miR-499a-5p in myofibers have shown 
that expression of these myomiRs correlates with expression of their respective parental 
genes MYH7 and MYH7B35. We found a significant correlation between transcript levels of 
MYH7 and MYH7B with their intronic pri-miRNAs and mature miRNAs in liver biopsies 
from patients chronically infected with HCV. This demonstrates that MYH7 and MYH7B 
expression can be used as a surrogate readout for myomiR expression4. Since HCV 
clearance depends on the host response to endogenous type I IFNs and/or therapeutic 
pegIFN-α, we were interested in determining whether these myomiRs targeted effectors in 
the type I IFN signaling pathway.
To investigate the effects of HCV-induced myomiRs on type I IFN signaling, we used 
previously characterized locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibitors to inhibit endogenous 
miR-208b and miR-499a- 5p during HCV infection of the hepatoma cell line Huh7 (ref. 4). 
A LNA inhibitor with a non-targeting sequence that does not bind to any known miRNA was 
used as a non-targeting control (NC). Huh7 cells were transfected with myomiR inhibitors or

 an NC inhibitor, infected with HCV, and then treated with IFN-β. Exogenous IFN-β was 
used to mimic therapeutic and paracrine type I IFN signaling, as HCV disrupts signaling 
downstream of the helicase RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene), an essential pathogen-
recognition receptor important for IFN induction. We confirmed that miR-208b, 
miR-499a-5p and their parental myosin genes were induced following infection as 
documented in our previous study4 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a). As expected, 
expression of the ISGs Mx GTPase (encoded by MX1), 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase 
(OAS1) and the translational inhibitor PKR were all induced following IFN-β stimulation 
(Fig. 1b). Interestingly, induction of these ISGs was significantly higher in cells treated with 
the myomiR inhibitors compared to the non-targeting control. Increased ISG expression in 
myomiR inhibitor-transfected cells correlated with decreases in viral titer and RNA copy 
number (Fig. 1c). The effect of the inhibitors was dependent on HCV infection and IFN- β 
treatment, as there was no difference in ISG expression in either HCV-infected cells treated 
with inhibitors or mock-infected cells treated with IFN-β (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). In this 
system, type III IFNs had no measurable effect, and the difference seen in ISG expression 
was downstream of type I IFN in the presence of myomiRs (Supplementary Text 1; 
Supplementary Fig. 2a–e). Together these findings suggested that myomiR-regulated 
factor(s) influenced hepatocyte responsiveness to IFN-β and, importantly, that myomiR 
inhibition improved the anti-HCV response.
As our data revealed that myomiR inhibition increased expression of multiple antiviral ISGs 
during HCV infection, we hypothesized that myomiRs may target an upstream effector in 
the type I IFN pathway. Given that reduced IFNAR1 mRNA has been reported in HCV-
infected livers27–31, we investigated whether IFNAR1 mRNA could be targeted by these 
myomiRs. Computational analysis revealed that the IFNAR1 3′ UTR harbors multiple 
predicted miRNA recognition elements (MREs) for both miR-208b and miR-499a-5p (Fig. 
1d,e). This suggests that these myomiRs may regulate IFNAR1. To explore this further, we 
transfected myomiR inhibitors or an NC inhibitor into HCV-infected Huh7 cells. We 
discovered that myomiR-inhibitor-transfected cells had significantly higher IFNAR1 mRNA 
and cell surface expression than NC-transfected cells (Fig. 1f,g). In contrast, expression of 
IFNAR2, which does not harbor MREs for the myomiRs in its 3′ UTR, was unaffected by 
the myomiR inhibitors (Fig. 1f). This demonstrated that the HCV-induced myomiRs, 
miR-208b and miR-499a-5p, specifically reduced expression of the IFNAR1 subunit. In a 
pattern similar to that seen in HCV infection (Fig. 1b), cells transfected with the myomiR 
mimics also showed and reduced pSTAT1 and ISG induction compared to control mimic-
treated cells (Supplementary Text 2, Fig. 2a–e). To confirm IFNAR1 targeting by miR-208b 
and miR-499a-5p, we used a firefly luciferase reporter assay where we cloned the human 
IFNAR1 3′ UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene. We observed decreased 
luciferase expression when the IFNAR1 3′ UTR luciferase construct was transfected into 
HepG2 cells overexpressing miR-208b or miR-499a-5p (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Taken 
together, these observations reveal that miR-208b and miR-499a-5p antagonized type I IFN 
signaling by destabilizing and down-regulating IFNAR1, leading to dampened ISG 
expression.
As myomiRs targeted components of the type I and type III IFN pathways, which are central 
to the antiviral response against HCV, we reasoned that understanding myomiR induction

 and regulation could lead to the discovery of new antiviral targets. As there is a strong 
correlation between expression of miR-208b and miR-499a-5p with their parental genes, we 
used expression of MYH7 and MYH7B as surrogate readouts for myomiR expression in the 
current study.
We previously showed that MYH7 and MYH7B are not induced in Huh7 cells during 
infection with West Nile virus or Sendai virus, nor are they induced following stimulation 
with the HCV 3′ UTR PAMP or poly(I:C)4. In addition, we did not observe myosin 
expression in Dengue virus-infected Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, all data to 
date suggest that myomiR/myosin induction is specific to HCV infection. We have also 
observed that MYH7 and MYH7B expression in JFH1 HCV-infected Huh7 cells correlated 
with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, treatment of HCV-infected 
Huh7 cells with a 2′-C-methyladenosine nucleoside analog inhibitor of HCV RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) that blocks viral genome replication and reduces viral 
load36,37 also blocked MYH7 and MYH7B induction in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3b). 
Using the HCV replicon system, we also observed that viral replication in the absence of 
viral entry was sufficient to induce myosin expression (Supplementary Text 3, Fig. 3c,d). 
These data suggested that myosin expression was dependent on viral replication.
As type I and type III IFNs inhibit HCV replication, we reasoned that IFN treatment would 
also reduce myosin expression. Like NS5B inhibitor treatment, prolonged type I IFN 
treatment of HCV-infected Huh7 cells reduced viral titer and copy number (Fig. 4a–c; 
Supplementary Fig. 3c). However, treatment with either IFN-α or IFN-β dramatically 
increased MYH7 expression in HCV-infected cells compared to untreated infected cells, 
suggesting a role for type I IFNs in the regulation of MYH7 (Fig. 4a–c). In line with this 
observation, type I IFN treatment of the Huh7 cell lines Huh7-K2040, Huh7-HP and Huh7-
JFH1 that harbor HCV replicons also amplified MYH7 expression (Fig. 3c). However, 
unlike type I IFNs, type III IFNs did not synergize with HCV to augment expression of 
myosin genes (Supplementary Text 4, Fig. 4a–d). These data suggest that myomiRs connect 
the type I and III IFN pathways during HCV infection as type I IFNs can increase myomiRs, 
which consequently regulate type III IFN production and type I IFN signaling 
(Supplementary Text 5).
Here we have shown that the HCV-induced myomiRs, miR-208b and miR-499a-5p, decrease 
IFNAR1 expression by destabilizing its mRNA transcript. miRNA repression of IFNAR1 
was sufficient to decrease IFNAR1 surface expression and dampen the antiviral response to 
type I IFN. During HCV infection of hepatocytes, we observed that myomiR inhibitors 
rescued expression of IFNAR1 and amplified the antiviral response to type I IFN, resulting 
in decreased viral load. Based on these data and our previous observation that inhibition of 
myomiRs rescues expression of IFNL2 and the risk allele of IFNL3 during HCV infection, 
myomiR inhibition could aid in a multistep fashion by increasing both hepatocyte 
production of type III IFNs and responsiveness to pegIFN-α. This would be particularly 
relevant during IFN-based therapies, considering that we found that type I IFNs increase 
myosin/myomiR expression (Fig. 4). The ability of type I IFNs to amplify myosin 
expression, a surrogate readout for myomiR expression, is also interesting in terms of type I 
IFN signaling feedback. myomiRs may function to blunt the cellular response to secondary

 type I IFN signaling, including the production of type III IFNs, which can be induced by 
prolonged type I IFN stimulation38 (Supplementary Fig. 4).
It is remarkable that unlike treatment with type I IFNs, treatment of HCV-infected 
hepatocytes with type III IFNs did not induce myosin/myomiR expression, raising the 
possibility that type III IFN-based therapies will bypass IFN induction of these myomiRs. 
Currently, IFN-λ-based therapy is in phase 3 clinical trials, and results from phase 2 trials 
have shown it to be as effective as pegIFN-α with fewer adverse effects; this suggests that 
IFN-λ may be a viable replacement for pegIFN-α39,40. myomiR inhibition may also benefit 
patients on IFN-free DAA regimens by increasing endogenous type III IFN production and 
type I IFN signaling. Taking these results together with our previous finding that these 
myomiRs also target IFNL2 and the risk variant of IFNL3, we conclude that myomiRs 
suppress both type I and type III IFN signaling during HCV infection. Collectively, these 
data add to our understanding of HCV immune evasion strategies and cross-talk between 
type I and type III IFN signaling pathways.
ONLINE METHODS
Cell culture conditions
HepG2 and PH5CH8 cell lines were obtained from ATCC. The identity of each hepatocyte 
cell line was confirmed based on their response to stimuli, and all cell lines tested negative 
for mycoplasma contamination. HepG2, Huh7, Huh7.5, PH5CH8 cells were cultured in 
complete DMEM (Sigma) media containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (FBS; Atlanta 
Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Mediatech). HepG2 cells 
overexpressing miR-208b (pLV-miR-208b), miR-499a-5p (pLV-miR-499a-5p), or a non-
targeting control miRNA were cultured in complete DMEM with 2 μg/mL puromycin 
dihydrochloride. Huh7-K2040, Huh7-HP and Huh7-JFH1 replicon cells were cultured in 
DMEM with 2 μg/mL G418, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1× MEM NEAA, 2mM L-Glutamine, 
and 10% FBS (Hyclone, no heat inactivation). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2.
IFNLR1 knockout with CRISPR–Cas9 system
IFNLR1 guide RNA (gRNA, 5′-GCTCTCCCACCCGTAGACGG-3′) was cloned 
downstream of the U6 promoter in the pRRL-U6-empty-gRNA-MND-Cas9-t2A-Puro vector 
using In-Fusion enzyme mix (Clontech). To generate knock out of IFNLR1 in Huh7, cells 
were transfected with either cas9 alone or IFNLR1 gRNA-Cas9 plasmids. For transfection of 
CRISPR–cas9 plasmids, 3 × 106 cells were seeded onto a 10 cm dish the day before 
transfection. 10 μg of either cas9 alone or IFNLR1 gRNA-cas9 was transfected using the 
CaPO4 transfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h post 
transfection, 2 μg /mL of puromycin was added to the media and cells were cultured for an 
additional week under selection before transduction efficiency was accessed. To confirm 
successful gene targeting in selected cells, genomic DNA was extracted from Huh7-wt/cas9 
and Huh7-IFNLR1−/− cells (NucleoSpin Tissue; Clontech). The genomic region surrounding 
the IFNLR1 target site was amplified by PCR, forward 5′-
GGTCCCAAAGCTAGGGAGGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TTGTTGTACAGGTC 
CTGTTTCTTCAGG-3′. PCR products were evaluated by restriction fragment length

 polymorphism using the enzyme Hyp166II, the restriction site of which overlaps the 
IFNLR1 CRISPR targeting site.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantification of gene expression
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) or by using the TRIzol method 
(Qiagen). qPCR was carried out using the QuantiTect RT kit (Qiagen) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was carried out using the ViiA7 qPCR system with TaqMan 
reagents (Life Technologies). Gene expression levels were normalized to HPRT for all cell 
types.
Total RNA for miRNA analysis was extracted with miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) or by using 
the Trizol method. miRNA-RT was carried out using miRCURY LNA Universal RT 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Exiqon), and SYBR qPCR master mix (Life 
Technologies) was used for quantitative PCR. Three LNA primers (Exiqon) designed to 
detect the most common miR-499a-5p isomiRs (miRBase) were pooled for detection. The 
miR-208b LNA primer was optimized by using a primer with a lower Tm. SNORD38B was 
used as an endogenous control.
miRNA mimic and inhibitor transfections and stimulations
miR-208b mimic, miR-499a-5p mimic, as well as a non-targeting control (NC) mimic that 
does not bind to any known mammalian genes, were purchased from Dharmacon. As 
commercially available inhibitors of miR-208b and miR-499a-5p (Dharmacon) had marginal 
efficacy of 40% in our systems, we developed LNA inhibitors specific for either miR-208b 
or miR-499a-5p. These custom LNA inhibitors showed a consistent 80% inhibition of their 
target miRNA4. A LNA inhibitor control in which the seed sequence of miR-499a-5p was 
mutated and predicted to bind no known human miRNA was used as a non-targeting control 
(NC). For transfection of mimics/inhibitors, cells were seeded at a density of 2–3 × 105 
cells/well of a 6-well plate, and 20–40 nM/well of mimics or inhibitors were transfected 
using 5–10 μl/well of DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon).
For all stimulations done on mimic- or inhibitor-transfected cells, 500 IU/mL of human IFN-
β was used. For immunoblot analysis of HepG2 cells, cells were stimulated 48 h post-
transfection with mimics and whole-cell extracts were collected at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. For 
ISG expression in HCV-infected Huh7 cells or mimic-transfected HepG2 cells, cells were 
stimulated 48 h post transfection with inhibitors/mimics and for the HCV-infected cells, 36 h 
post infection. IFN-α and IFN-β were purchased from PBL, and IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2 and IFN-
λ3 were purchased from R&D Systems.
mRNA stability
Mimic-transfected HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μg/106 cells/mL of Actinomycin D 48 
h post transfection. Samples were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-treatment and processed for 
qPCR analysis. HepG2 cells treated with ActD did not show any overt toxicity at the 
specified concentration at 8 h.

 Immunoblot analysis
30–60 μg of lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes 
(Thermo Scientific). The membranes were then probed using the recommended antibody 
dilution in 5% BSA in TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20) or 5% non-fat milk in 
TBST for phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), STAT1, phospho-STAT2 (Tyr690), STAT2, phospho-
Tyk2 (Tyr1054/1055), Tyk2, phospho-Jak1 (Tyr1022/1023), Jak1 or β-actin (13E5) (Cell 
Signaling). Validation of antibodies is provided on the manufacturer’s website.
HCV infection
Cell culture-adapted HCV JFH1 genotype 2A strain was propagated and infectivity titrated, 
as previously described previously39. For HCV infections, inhibitor-transfected cells were 
inoculated with virus at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 1.0 for 3 h and then the media 
was replaced. Cells were harvested using Trizol or RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) at the indicated 
times. HCV RNA copy number was measured using quantitative qPCR with the TaqMan 
Fast Virus 1-step kit and primers specific for the 5′ UTR (Pa03453408_s1, Life 
Technologies). The copy number was calculated by comparison to a standard curve of in 
vitro-transcribed full-length HCV RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
HCV RNA transcription and transfections
Plasmids containing full-length cDNA sequences of JFH1, JC1 or H77D HCV viruses were 
linearized by restriction enzyme digest and purified. The linearized product was used for in 
vitro transcription using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Life technologies). Following transcription, 
samples were DNAse treated, unincorporated nucleotides were removed and the resulting 
RNA sample was run on a 1% formaldehyde gel to check for purity. For HCV RNA 
transfection, PH5CH8 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in a 12 well 
plate. The next day 200 ng of HCV RNA was transfected per well using 1.125 μl mRNA 
Boost reagent (Mirus) and 2.25 μl TransIT-mRNA reagent (Mirus)41. Cells were harvested 
48 h post transfection.
HCV viral titer
HCV viral titer was measured using a focus-forming unit (FFU) assay where 100 μl of cell 
supernatant was serially diluted 10 to 100-fold in complete DMEM and used to infect 8 × 
104 Huh-7.5 cells per well in 24 well plates. Cells incubated for 2 h, then supernatant was 
removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and supplemented with complete DMEM. 
48 h post-inoculum cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with an anti-HCV 
NS5A antibody, then the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary. VECTOR VIP Peroxidase 
Substrate Kit (SK-4600) was used to visualize staining, and focal units were counted and 
expressed as FFU/mL of supernatant.
Statistical analysis
Unpaired Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 6 
Software. For samples with unequal variance, determined by F-test, Welch’s correction was 
applied. Mean ± s.e.m. was used for statistical analyses of experiments with technical 
replicates noted in figure legends. For data using pooled biological replicates, the averages
