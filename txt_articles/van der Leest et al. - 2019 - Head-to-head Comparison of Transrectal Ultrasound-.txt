Abstract
Background: There is growing interest to implement multiparametric magnetic reso-
nance imaging (mpMRI) and MR-guided biopsy (MRGB) for biopsy-naïve men with
suspected prostate cancer.
Objective: Primary objective was to compare and evaluate an MRI pathway and a
transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) pathway in biopsy-naïve men with
prostate-specific antigen levels of �3 ng/ml.
Design, setting, and population: A prospective, multicenter, powered, comparative
effectiveness study included 626 biopsy-naïve patients (from February 2015 to February
2018).
Intervention: All patients underwent prebiopsy mpMRI followed by systematic
TRUSGB. Men with suspicious lesions on mpMRI also underwent MRGB prior toTRUSGB.
MRGB was performed using the in-bore approach.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Clinically significant prostate cancer
(csPCa) was defined as grade group �2 (Gleason score �3 + 4) in any core. The main
secondary objectives were the number of men who could avoid biopsy after nonsus-
picious mpMRI, the number of biopsy cores taken, and oncologic follow-up. Differences

Introduction
International guidelines recommend systematic 12-core
transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) in biopsy-
naïve men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
serum levels of >3 ng/ml [1,2]. However, TRUSGB has
limitations. First, clinically insignificant prostate cancer
(insignPCa) is unnecessarily detected. Second, many men
undergo TRUSGB and never have prostate cancer (PCa)
diagnosed. Biopsies can lead to complications such as
bleeding and infections, leading to increased healthcare
costs [3]. Third, clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa)
can be missed. Fourth, multiple risk stratification errors
occur, contributing to treatment failures for men undergo-
ing active surveillance for presumed low-risk PCa.
Compared with
TRUSGB,
multiparametric
magnetic
resonance imaging (mpMRI) has been reported to reduce
the detection of insignPCa while increasing the detection of
csPCa [4–6]. The opportunity to selectively localize csPCa
enables MR-directed biopsy and in so doing use fewer cores.
This has improved the diagnostic pathway for men with
suspected PCa. It has been shown that if mpMRI is
nonsuspicious, immediate TRUSGB can be safely avoided
[7,8]. Multiple single- and multicenter randomized trials
have confirmed the superiority of mpMRI and MR-directed
biopsy to TRUSGB [9–14]. However, these studies lacked
sufficient standardization of MRI reporting, central quality
control review of mpMRI acquisition and reading, central
pathology review of biopsies, and adequate oncologic
follow-up. In addition, many studies have not performed
a comparison of TRUSGB and mpMRI + MR-guided biopsy
(MRGB) in the same patients.
Therefore, we conducted a prospective, multicenter,
clinical effectiveness study that compared head-to-head
mpMRI + MRGB (MRI pathway) with the TRUSGB pathway
in biopsy-naïve men at a risk of PCa.
2.
Patients and methods
2.1.
Study population
Between February 2015 and February 2017, 699 consecutive biopsy-
naïve men, aged 50–75 yr with a PSA level of �3 ng/ml were recruited in
this prospective multicenter comparative effectiveness study (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Patients were enrolled from four medical centers in the
Netherlands: Radboudumc Nijmegen (coordinating, central center;
n = 169) and three nonuniversity hospitals—Ziekenhuis Groep Twente
(n = 357), Maasstad Hospital Rotterdam (n = 152), and Andros Men's
Health Institutes (n = 21).
Exclusion criteria were age <50 or >75 yr, a history of previous
prostate biopsy or PCa, general contraindications for MRI, use of
medications known to affect serum PSA levels, symptoms of urinary tract
infection, and a history of invasive treatments for benign prostate
hyperplasia. The central ethical review board approved this study, and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was
registered in the Dutch Trial register under identifier NTR5555.
2.2.
Multiparametric MRI
All patients underwent mpMRI performed at 3 T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens
Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) compliant with the Prostate Imaging
Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) standards (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2) [15,16]. The protocol consisted of T2-weighted imaging in three
planes, diffusion-weighted imaging with calculation of apparent diffusion
coefficient(ADC)maps,highb-valueimages(b > 1400 s/mm2),anddynamic
contrast enhanced imaging (Supplementary Table 1). The images were
in proportions were tested using McNemar's test with adjusted Wald confidence
intervals for differences of proportions with matched pairs.
Results and limitations: The MRI pathway detected csPCa in 159/626 (25%) patients and
insignificant prostate cancer (insignPCa) in 88/626 patients (14%). TRUSGB detected
csPCa in 146/626 patients (23%) and insignPCa in 155/626 patients (25%). Relative
sensitivity of the MRI pathway versus the TRUSGB pathway was 1.09 for csPCa (p = 0.17)
and 0.57 for insignPCa (p < 0.0001). The total number of biopsy cores reduced from
7512 to 849 (–89%). The MRI pathway enabled biopsy avoidance in 309/626 (49%)
patients due to nonsuspicious mpMRI. Immediate TRUSGB detected csPCa in only 3%
(10/309) of these patients, increasing to 4% (13/309) with 1-yr follow-up. At the same
time, TRUSGB would overdetect insignPCa in 20% (63/309). “Focal saturation” by four
additional perilesional cores to MRGB improved the detection of csPCa in 21/317 (7%)
patients. Compared with the literature, our proportion of nonsuspicious mpMRI cases is
significantly higher (27–36% vs 49%) and that of equivocal cases is lower (15–28% vs 6%).
This is probably due to the high-quality standard in this study. Therefore, a limitation is
the duplication of these results in less experienced centers.
Conclusions: In biopsy-naïve men, the MRI pathway compared with the TRUSGB
pathway results in an identical detection rate of csPCa, with significantly fewer
insignPCa cases. In this high-quality standard study, almost half of men have non-
suspicious MRI, which is higher compared with other studies. Not performing TRUS
biopsy is at the cost of missing csPCa only in 4%.
Patient summary: We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MRI-guided
biopsy against standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in
biopsy-naïve men. Our results show that patients can benefit from MRI because biopsy may
be omitted in half of men, and fewer indolent cancers are detected, without compromising
the detection of harmful disease. Men also need fewer needles to make a diagnosis.

 analyzed by trained radiologists using the PI-RADS v2 to score all detected
lesions. A central review before biopsy was performed by two central-center
radiologists (J.B. and M.v.d.L., 25 and 5 yr of experience with prostate MRI,
respectively) for each case. For patients enrolled in the central center, the
images were analyzed independently by these two radiologists. When PI-
RADS scores were discordant, a consensus assessment decided on the need
for MRGB. Multiparametric MRI was categorized as suspicious in the
presence of PI-RADS 3–5 lesion(s). PSA density (PSAD) was calculated by
dividing serum PSA level by MRI prostate volume.
2.3.
Biopsy
Men with a suspicious mpMRI scan underwent in-bore MRGB (using 18G
needles with sampling length of 17 mm) followed by a 12-core
systematic TRUSGB (using 18G needles with sampling length of
17 mm) preferably the same day, performed by a urologist blinded to
the imaging results. MRGB was performed using a commercially
available transrectal in-bore MR biopsy device (Invivo, Gainsville, FL,
USA). Nonuniversity radiologists received training for the MRGB
procedure. Each PI-RADS 3–5 lesion was biopsied using two to four
cores. The lowest signal areas on ADC maps within a suspicious region
were used to target biopsies.
TRUSGB
was
performed
according
to international guidelines
[17]. Where a lesion was visible at [6_TD$DIF]TRUS, it was targeted by using the
core for the relevant prostate zone (no additional cores were performed).
Men with nonsuspicious mpMRI (PI-RADS 1–2) underwent TRUSGB only.
2.4.
Histopathology
All biopsies were centrally reviewed at the central center by an
experienced uropathologist (C.A.H.K., 25 yr of experience) independent
of the results of the nonuniversity pathologists and the mpMRI results.
TRUSGB and MRGB of each patient were evaluated separately from each
other and blinded to the individual results. TRUSGB cores adjacent to
lesions sampled by MRGB were called “perilesional.” For cores contain-
ing cancer, grade group (GG) and Gleason score (GS) were determined
using the 2014 International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) criteria
[18]. Any prostatectomy specimens after radical prostatectomy were
analyzed by the experienced general pathologists.
2.4.1.
Definition of clinically significant PCa
Recent EAU guidelines use the definition of GG � 2 (GS � 3 + 4) for csPCa
[17,19]. This matches with the newly introduced ISUP scoring system,
where no separation is made between large and small GG 1 (GS 3 + 3)
PCa. Therefore, our initial definition of csPCa that included large GG 1 (GS
3 + 3) PCa was changed to GG � 2 (GS � 3 + 4). Additional analyses for
the two other csPCa definitions, large GG 1 (GS 3 + 3) and GG � 3 (GS � 4
+ 3) were performed.
2.5.
Outcome measurements
The primary outcomes comprised the overall detection rates of csPCa
and insignPCa for both pathways. The secondary outcomes were the
proportion of men in the MRI pathway who did not undergo MRGB after
a nonsuspicious scan result, the number of csPCa missed in this group
(detected by immediate TRUSGB and 1-yr follow-up), histopathologic
details of biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens, the number of
biopsy cores per biopsy session, MRI and histopathology reader
performance, biopsy complications, and oncologic follow-up.
2.6.
Follow-up
A “safety net” was provided to all patients without csPCa at TRUSGB with
either nonsuspicious mpMRI or suspicious mpMRI without a csPCa at
MRGB. This included a minimum follow-up of 1 yr, with repeated PSA
levels every 6 mo. In case of increased or persistent elevated PSA, repeat
mpMRI and/or biopsy was performed.
2.7.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.5.0; R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Descriptive statistics were
used to present clinical and mpMRI characteristics. Continuous variables
were presented as median (interquartile range) and categorical variables
as numbers with percentages. In patients with multiple lesions on
mpMRI, the index lesion with the highest PI-RADS score was used.
To compare the proportions of csPCa and insignPCa in both pathways,
McNemar's tests were used. Adjusted Wald confidence intervals (CIs) for
differences of proportions with matched pairs were calculated. Multi-
parametric MRI and histopathology reader agreement was calculated
using Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC) [20].

Results
3.1.
Patient data and mpMRI results
Data of 626 patients were analyzed (Fig. 1). Patient
characteristics and mpMRI scores are summarized in
Table 1. The mpMRI was scored PI-RADS 1–2, 3, 4, and
5 in 49%, 6%, 22%, and 23%, respectively. Cancer detection
rate (CDR) of the combined pathways was 334/626 (53%).
Overall detection rates [7_TD$DIF](without [8_TD$DIF]follow-up) were 190/626
(30%) for csPCa and 144/626 (23%) for insignPCa. Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 10 show the results of two alternate
definitions of csPCa.
3.2.
MRGB and TRUSGB results
MRGB was performed in 317/626 (51%) patients. TRUSGB
was performed in all patients. Biopsy core analysis details
are presented in Table 2. Detection rates of csPCa increased
with increasing PI-RADS categories. Differences of csPCa
detection between TRUSGB and MRGB for PI-RADS 5 lesions
were minimal (2%). These differences were higher for PI-
RADS 3–4 lesions (12%; Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3).
3.3.
Clinical performance of MRI and TRUSGB pathways
The overall CDR in the MRI pathway was 247/626 (39%)
compared with 301/626 (48%) in the TRUSGB pathway.
Immediate results, without follow-up, showed that the
TRUSGB pathway found csPCa in 146/626 (23%) and the MRI
pathway in 159/626 (25%) patients (difference of 2%; 95%
CI:–1 to 5); insignPCa was found in 155/626 (25%) and 88/
626 (14%) patients, respectively (difference of 11%; 95% CI:
7–14). Relative sensitivity of the MRI pathway compared
with the TRUSGB pathway was 1.09 for csPCa and 0.57 for
insignPCa (Table 3).
The diagnostic impact of biopsy strategies is presented in
Fig. 2. Restricting biopsy to patients with suspicious mpMRI
(PI-RADS
3–5; n = 317) reduced the
number of men
requiring a biopsy by 309/626 (49%). Not performing biopsy
in PI-RADS 1–2 cases resulted in missing 10/309 (3%) of
csPCa. Nine patients had a GG 2 (GS 3 + 4) and one a GG 3
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 5 ( 2 0 19 ) 5 7 0 – 5 7 8
572
 (GS 4 + 3; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig.
4A). In patients with nonsuspicious mpMRI, TRUSGB
overdetected insignPCa in 63/309 (20%). If systematic
TRUSGB would be performed in patients with nonsuspi-
cious mpMRI and PSAD �0.15 ng/ml/ml (n = 55), three cases
of csPCa would have been found. This would lower the
underdetected rate to 2%, at the cost of 9% more insignPCa. If
biopsy would be performed only in patients with PI-RADS
3 and PSAD �0.15 ng/ml/ml, four csPCa cases including one
GG 3 and one GG 5 would go undetected.
The utility of the MRI pathway alone versus the MRI
pathway
plus
systematic
12-core
TRUSGB
(combined
pathway) was also evaluated. Additional 7% (21/317) csPCa
cases were detected with the combined biopsy approach
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4B, and Supplementary Table 3).
In 20 of these 21 patients, the csPCa cases detected by
TRUSGB were recognized on mpMRI as suspicious lesions.
In the remaining patient, the csPCa diagnosed by TRUSGB
(GG 5; GS 4 + 5) was missed by all readers (therefore not
specifically targeted) but was retrospectively visible. In the
20 patients with visible lesions diagnosed as csPCa only by
TRUSGB cores, the TRUSGB cores were [9_TD$DIF]obtained from the
abnormal mpMRI lesion [10_TD$DIF]area [1_TD$DIF]or from neighboring perile-
sional TRUSGB areas. In total 72 (peri)lesional TRUSGB cores
were taken, yielding 15 patients with GG 2 (GS 3 + 4) and
five with GG � 3 (GS � 4 + 3) PCa. Thus, the average number
of TRUSGB cores was 4 (72/20) to diagnose each extra csPCa.
3.3.1.
MRI reader performance
MRI reader performance concordance analysis for PI-RADS
score was performed between first nonuniversity center
and second central-center reading. The agreement for both
readers was 88% (399/456; Gwet's AC = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.80–
0.88) and the agreement for decision whether to perform an
MRGB was 94% (428/456; Gwet's AC = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.83–
0.92; Supplementary Table 4).

 3.3.2.
Histopathologic reader performance
Concordance between the nonuniversity and the central-
center histopathologic reading was analyzed with respect to
GG/GS and the number of positive biopsy cores. The
agreement in GG/GS was 77% for the MRGB and 88% for
the TRUSGB group (Gwet's AC = 0.73 and 0.82, respectively).
The agreement in the number of positive cancer cores was
94% in the MRGB group and 87% in the TRUSGB group
(Gwet's AC = 0.96 and 0.86, respectively; Supplementary
Tables 5–8).
3.4.
Prostatectomy results
In 131 patients, radical prostatectomy was performed.
Between the TRUSGB cores and prostatectomy specimen,
there was an agreement in GG in 37%, a downgrade in 38%,
and an upgrade in 25%. For MRGB cores, these values are
44%, 35%, and 21%, respectively (Supplementary Table 9).
3.5.
Follow-up
In 39/309 (13%) patients with baseline nonsuspicious
mpMRI, repeat biopsies were performed. In these patients,
three csPCa cases were found: two had a GG 2 (GS 3 + 4) and
one a GG 5 (GS 5 + 4) lesion. The GG 5 (GS 5 + 4) tumor was
retrospectively visible on the baseline mpMRI but missed by
all readers and thus was a false-negative mpMRI finding.
Combined immediate and follow-up results show that in
total 13/309 (4%) cases of csPCa were missed in patients
with nonsuspicious mpMRI.
In 53/137 (39%) patients with a negative biopsy or
insignPCa at combined biopsy and suspicious baseline
mpMRI, repeat mpMRI was performed, which was non-
suspicious in 26 of these 53 (49%) patients. Seven cases of
GG 2 (GS 3 + 4) were found at repeat biopsy (Supplementary
Fig. 5).
3.6.
Biopsy complications
In total, 6% (41/626) of patients had complications: 3% had a
complicated urinary tract infection (UTI/urosepsis) and 3%
had other complications including lower urinary tract
symptoms
(n = 9),
bleeding
(n = 8),
vasovagal
episode
(n = 3), and transient ischemic attack after discontinuation
of anticoagulant medication (n = 1). Fifty percent (20/41) of
these complications occurred in patients who underwent
only TRUSGB in the nonsuspicious mpMRI group, including
2.9% (nine of 309) with complicated UTI/urosepsis.

Discussion
The major strength of this study is its quality-controlled,
multicenter, head-to-head design. It confirms the larger
body of research and clinical experience on combined
mpMRI and MRGB for the detection and localization of
csPCa in biopsy-naïve patients [9–14,21–23]. This paper
makes multiple contributions to existing literature where
there is controversy regarding its use for biopsy-naïve men.
Our study provides level 1a evidence that the mpMRI
pathway is noninferior to the TRUSGB pathway in biopsy-
naïve men with regard to significant disease detection but is
superior for detecting fewer insignificant cancers, and
supports the “no immediate biopsy approach” after non-
suspicious mpMRI scans. Similar to other studies, we show
that TRUSGB yields of csPCa in nonsuspicious mpMRI
patients are low (4%) [7,8]. Furthermore, not performing
TRUSGB in these patients results in avoidance of compli-
cated UTI/sepsis in 2.9%.
The proportion of men avoiding biopsy is almost twice
that reported by the PROMIS and PRECISION trials—27% and
28%, respectively [9,10]. In the PROMIS study, this was at the
cost of underdetection of csPCa of 24% (38/158) found on
template mapping biopsy using the csPCa definition of
GG � 2 (GS � 3 + 4) [9]. However, for TRUSGB the csPCa
yield in nonsuspicious mpMRI cases was only 5.1% (H.U.

Relative sensitivity is the sensitivity (ie, true positive rate) ratio between the MRI pathway and the TRUSGB pathway for each definition of csPCa. A value of
1 shows equal sensitivity. Values >1 indicate greater sensitivity for the MRI pathway, whereas values below 1 show lower sensitivity. Higher relative sensitivity
is desirable for csPCa, and lower for the detection of insignPCa. The p values were calculated with McNemar's test for paired nominal data.

 Ahmed, personal communication). Pokorny et al. [11]
showed that biopsy could be avoided in 36% (81/223), with
an underdiagnosis of csPCa in 11% (9/81) found on TRUSGB.
The low prevalence of csPCa in this study (30%)
compared with contemporary cohorts (38–47%) could
contribute to the high number of nonsuspicious MRI scans
[9,10,21,24], which are in line with the MRI screening study
of Grenabo Bergdahl et al. [25]. Another more important
explanation for the higher proportion of nonsuspicious
mpMRI scans than in other studies may be the high-quality
standards achieved in image acquisition and reading. In our
study, all mpMRI scans were performed on 3 T scanners,
adhering to the PI-RADS v2 protocols, undertaken by
trained prostate-MRI technologists. We also attained high
quality in mpMRI readings using double expert consensus
readings.
These
high
standards helped
minimize the
proportion of “uncertain” (PI-RADS 3) diagnoses. PI-RADS
3 was present in 6% in our study, versus 28%, 21%, and 15% in
the PROMIS, PRECISION, and Pokorny et al's studies [9–11],
respectively. That nonuniversity radiologists can perform
high-quality reading after appropriate training is illustrated
by their high agreement with the central-center radiolo-
gists.
This study design can also address the debate regarding
the appropriate biopsy action in men with suspicious
mpMRI scans: MRGB alone or MRGB + TRUSGB? In agree-
ment with the literature, addition of systematic TRUSGB to
MRGB leads to higher rates of csPCa and insignPCa
[6,26]. The majority of csPCa missed by MRGB appears to
be sampling errors related to intratumor heterogeneity.
“Focal saturation” by additional four perilesional cores
showed to improve csPCa detection when sampling with
MRGB.
Some limitations should be discussed. First, reproducing
these findings outside expert centers may be a challenge,
but as shown in this study, it is not impossible. A well-
designed training program can achieve high inter-reader
agreements for PI-RADS score allocations as well as for
biopsy decision making.
Second, MRGB and TRUSGB were undertaken in se-
quence on the same day. The visible MRGB needle track
could have influenced the urologist in TRUSGB needle
placements. Moreover, when TRUSGB was abnormal[12_TD$DIF], a
needle targeted to the abnormality was undertaken in lieu
of the sextant core. This could inflate the PCa detection rates
of TRUSGB, although biopsy hemorrhage from MRGB may
partly negate this effect.
Third, even though this study used in-bore MRGB, which
is considered the optimal MR-targeting technique for
smaller lesions, a recent review showed that in-bore MRGB

to csPCa (underdetection); 11 additional cases of insignificant PCa were detected at TRUSGB where MRGB yielded no PCa.

 and MR-TRUS-fusion–guided biopsy are equally accurate,
and results are potentially translatable to MR-TRUS-fusion–
guided biopsies [27].
Fourth, some investigators have noted that selective
sampling of the most aggressive part of a cancer by MRGB
may lead to risk-stratification errors and can potentially lead
to overtreatments of csPCa detected by MRGB [28]. However,
a comparison of TRUSGB and MRGB with prostatectomy
specimenswithinthisstudydidnotshowmarkeddifferences
between histologic down- and upgrading.
Finally, the low rate of infection-related complications
could be further reduced by utilizing transperineal template
mapping biopsies instead of the transrectal sampling route
used in this study [9].
An
“MRI-first”
pathway
in
biopsy-naïve
men
has
implementation challenges. The recommendation for “no
immediate biopsy[13_TD$DIF]” requires a robust follow-up regimen to
minimize missing csPCa that emerge in follow-up. Our
approach for a “safety net” is to perform 6-montly PSA tests
and repeated mpMRI, MRGB, or TRUSGB when clinical
suspicion persists. Panebianco et al. [8] have shown that
such a safety net detects most interval cancers after non-
suspicious mpMRI and that emerging csPCa are curable at
that time (Panebianco, personal communication) [29]. Fur-
thermore, an education program and quality control for
prostate-MRI technologists, MRGB physicians, and radiol-
ogists are needed, to deliver optimized quality of care for
men with suspected PCa.
Finally, implementation of all new technologies is always
connected with costs; although the MRI pathway, especially
when using in-bore MRGB, is initially more expensive, extra
costs are compensated for by reduced delays in diagnoses,
omittance
of
biopsies
and
subsequent
biopsy-related
morbidities, and treatment costs [30–32].

Conclusions
In biopsy-naïve men, the MRI pathway compared with the
TRUS pathway results in an identical detection rate of csPCa,
with significantly fewer cases of insignPCa. In this high-
quality standard study, almost half of men have non-
suspicious MRI, which is higher compared with other
studies. Not performing immediate TRUS biopsy after
negative MRI is at the cost of missing csPCa only in 4%.
