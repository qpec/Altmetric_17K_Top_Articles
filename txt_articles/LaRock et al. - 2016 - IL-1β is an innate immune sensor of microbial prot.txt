Abstract
Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key proinflammatory cytokine that drives antimicrobial immune 
responses. IL-1β is aberrantly activated in autoimmune diseases, and IL-1β inhibitors are used as 
therapeutic agents to treat patients with certain autoimmune disorders. Review of postmarketing 
surveillance of patients receiving IL-1β inhibitors found a disproportionate reporting of invasive 
infections by group A Streptococcus (GAS). IL-1β inhibition increased mouse susceptibility to 
GAS infection, but IL-1β was produced independent of canonical inflammasomes. Newly 
synthesized IL-1β has an amino-terminal prodomain that blocks signaling activity, which is 
usually proteolytically removed by caspase-1, a protease activated within the inflammasome 
structure. In place of host caspases, the secreted GAS cysteine protease SpeB generated mature 
IL-1β. During invasive infection, GAS isolates may acquire pathoadaptive mutations eliminating 
SpeB expression to evade detection by IL-1β. Pharmacological IL-1β inhibition alleviates this 
selective pressure, allowing invasive infection by nonpathoadapted GAS. Thus, IL-1β is a sensor 
that directly detects pathogen-associated proteolysis through an independent pathway operating in 
parallel with host inflammasomes. Because IL-1β function is maintained across species, yet 
cleavage by caspases does not appear to be, detection of microbial proteases may represent an 
ancestral system of innate immune regulation.

 INTRODUCTION
Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is an important alarm to infection that stimulates intrinsic, innate, 
and adaptive immune pathways. Conversely, excessive or chronic IL-1β activation is 
implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 
diabetes, celiac disease, gout, and systemic lupus erythematosus (1). Accordingly, IL-1β 
inhibitor therapy has therapeutic benefit in these diseases and hereditary inflammasome 
disorders including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and familial Mediterranean 
fever (2). In contrast to these pathological consequences, inflammasome function is 
protective during most infections; IL-1β coordinates an immune response that can 
antagonize pathogen colonization, replication, invasion, and dissemination (3).
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a ubiquitous human pathogen, colonizing 10 to 20% of 
individuals at any given time and causing ~700 million cases of pharyngitis and superficial 
skin infections yearly (4). These infections are classically pyogenic; the interaction of GAS 
with the host is highly inflammatory and is accompanied by substantial neutrophil influx and 
pus formation. The role of IL-1β in the inflammatory response to GAS has not been defined, 
but IL-1 receptor knockout (IL-1R1−/−) mice are markedly more susceptible to infection by 
the pathogen (5). Typically, IL-1β is regulated by posttranslational cleavage of an N-terminal 
prodomain by the protease caspase-1 within the inflammasome complex (3). GAS can 
induce IL-1β maturation through the NACHT, LRR, and PYD family pyrin domain-
containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in vitro (6, 7), yet in vivo NLRP3 is required neither 
for IL-1β release nor for innate immune resistance to the bacterium (6–8), leaving the 
mechanism for IL-1β generation unclear (9).
Here, we present an alternative mechanism for activation of IL-1β that reconciles these 
disparate findings. We show that a GAS protease, SpeB, directly processes IL-1β during 
infection and generates a mature, inflammatory cytokine that can promote macrophage 
bactericidal functions. Robust activation of IL-1β in this fashion triggers a 
hyperinflammatory state that restricts GAS invasion. In murine models and human patients, 
invasive GAS may develop SpeB-repressing pathoadaptive mutations, which aid the 
bacterium in escaping IL-1β restriction. A requirement of this mutation to reduce innate 
immune “visibility” provides a barrier to invasive infection that is lost if IL-1β signaling is 
therapeutically inhibited.
RESULTS
Although numerous experimental models identified marked susceptibility of IL-1β-deficient 
mice to infection (9), clinical trials supporting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approval of IL-1β inhibitors revealed only modest infectious complications (10). Our 
review of postmarketing surveillance from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System 
[FAERS (11)] confirmed this low infection rate with one striking exception: severe invasive 
infections produced by GAS. Patients receiving an IL-1β inhibitor are reported to experience 
invasive GAS disease at an ~330-fold increased rate, including at least 13 hospitalizations 
(and 3 fatalities) in patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF), sepsis, or tissue abscess (Fig. 
1A) (4). This extraordinarily high reporting rate of GAS infectious complications was not

 found for other common immunosuppressant therapies used in rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 
1A). Furthermore, GAS NF infections in anakinra-treated individuals were associated with 
greater mortality than similar infections in patients receiving alternative immunosuppressant 
drugs (Fig. 1B) or the overall expected mortality rate (4).
The rarity of NF infection makes the assignment of the underlying risk factors difficult. 
Severe GAS infectious complications reported in patients receiving IL-1β inhibitors 
suggested a pivotal role for IL-1β in controlling streptococcal NF. Mice treated with the 
FDA‐approved IL‐1β inhibitor anakinra were deficient in IL-1β signaling and more 
permissive for GAS replication and dissemination (Fig. 2A), consistent with our previous 
observations in IL‐1R−/− mice (5). Anakinra likewise inhibited IL-1 signaling, but not IL-1β 
maturation, in GAS-infected macrophages (Fig. 2B). Autocrine IL-1β signaling can promote 
macrophage cell activation and immune functions (3, 7); correspondingly, anakinra also 
reduced macrophage killing of GAS (Fig. 2C). To exclude off-target drug effects, we 
compared anakinra treatment to host deficiency in IL-1R, as well as caspase-1, the key 
regulator of inflammasome-mediated IL-1β maturation and release. Although IL-1R−/− cells 
and mice were similarly impaired in GAS killing, caspase-1−/− cells and mice were not (Fig. 
2, C and D). Caspase-1-independent IL-1 signaling was observed during infections by GAS, 
but not with similar Gram-positive bacterial pathogens group B Streptococcus (GBS), group 
C Streptococcus (GCS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or during 
incubation with the sterile inflammatory stimulus adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (fig. S1). 
These data indicate that anakinra treatment leads to GAS susceptibility by blocking IL-1β 
signaling but that caspase-1 is not involved.
Two emergent immunotherapies target caspase-1 [VX-765, (12)] or NLRP3 [MCC950, (13)] 
rather than IL-1β. Both drugs inhibited IL-1β signaling in response to ATP and crystalline 
monosodium urate, sterile NLRP3 agonists involved in autoinflammatory diseases; VX-765 
additionally inhibited the response to absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) agonist, poly(dA:dT) 
[poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic) acid sodium salt] (Fig. 2E). However, host-protective 
IL-1β signaling was maintained during GAS infections in the presence of these direct 
inflammasome inhibitors (Fig. 2E). Moreover, therapeutic administration of the NLRP3 
inhibitor MCC950 did not increase the in vivo proliferation of GAS (fig. S2), a finding 
consistent with previous infectious challenge studies in NLRP3−/− mice that did not exhibit a 
hypersusceptible phenotype (6, 7). These findings suggest that strategies for blocking 
endogenous IL‐1β maturation may not carry the same risk for GAS infection as those 
blocking its receptor signaling.
IL-1β signaling requires proteolytic processing of immature pro-IL-1β (9), but the lack of 
caspase-1 involvement indicates another source of the IL-1β-converting protease. Caspase-1-
independent IL-1β signaling during GAS infection was prevented by pretreatment of the 
microorganism with broad-spectrum protease inhibitors, suggesting that a bacterial protease 
was acting as a surrogate of host caspase (Fig. 3A). Examining the three major secreted 
proteases of GAS we found that cysteine protease SpeB was necessary and sufficient to 
induce IL-1 signaling (Fig. 3A). SpeB colocalized with IL-1β within cells (fig. S3) and 
induced the release of cleaved IL-1β (~p17) into the supernatant, independent of caspase-1 
(Fig. 3B).

 Confirming that SpeB is sufficient for the activation of IL-1β, caspase inhibitors YVAD-
fmk, IETD-fmk, and DEVD-fmk did not alter IL-1 signaling in these cells, whereas 
cysteine-protease inhibitors that target SpeB, E64 (14), and N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-2-
amino-acetonitrile (15) did (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, cotransfection of human embryonic 
kidney (HEK) 293 cells with vectors expressing pro-IL-1β and various proteases showed 
that SpeB, such as the positive control caspase-1, was sufficient to establish IL-1β signaling 
in the cells (Fig. 3D). Catalytically inactive SpeB or the apoptosis regulator caspase-7 did 
not result in IL-1β signaling, indicative of protease substrate specificity to this activation. 
Active caspase-8 can cleave IL-1β (16), but caspase-8 activation was not observed during 
infection (fig. S4), and would be inhibited by IETD-fmk (Fig. 3C). Caspase-1-like activity 
was decreased, not increased, by SpeB (fig. S5). Notably, SpeB degrades the inflammasome-
activating GAS virulence factors streptolysin O (SLO) and SpyA (fig. S5) (17), explaining 
the decreased activation of the canonical inflammasome in its presence. Nonetheless, cell 
death was induced in the presence of SpeB, even in the absence of caspase-1 (fig. S5), 
providing a mechanism for the release of IL-1β (18). Together, these studies exclude several 
alternative explanations for in vitro maturation of IL-1β and point to direct activation by 
SpeB.
Similar to caspases, SpeB targets numerous proteins for cleavage including those involved in 
the extracellular matrix, antibodies, cell receptors and cytokines, including IL-1β (19); SpeB 
can also cleave several of GAS’ own surface-associated and secreted virulence factors (17, 
20). These data indicate that SpeB has broad substrate specificity. Because enzyme 
saturation during in vitro assays can falsely identify protease substrates, we first developed a 
cellular reporter system to analyze specific pro-IL-1β cleavage. Relative proteolysis was 
measured using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) through a construct containing a 
protease-labile linker separating the dual fluorescent proteins (21). Concurrently, pro-IL-1β 
conversion was measured with IL-1R reporter cells (Fig. 3E). In caspase-1/11− cells, 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs) activating the caspase-11 [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], NLRC4 [flagellin (FliC)], 
AIM2 [poly(dA:dT)], or NLRP3 (ATP, SLO, or exotoxin A) inflammasomes did not induce 
IL-1 signaling (Fig. 3E). In contrast to these inflammasome agonists, SpeB activated IL-1β 
with similar relative specificity as the known IL-1β convertases caspase-1 (22, 23) and 
neutrophil elastase (Fig. 3E) (24).
To further examine pro-IL-1β processing by SpeB, we co-incubated recombinant human 
pro-IL-1β with purified, native SpeB. In these reactions, we observed accumulation of a 
major cleavage product approximating the size of mature IL-1β generated by caspase-1 (22, 
23) and concurrent with the generation of an active IL-1R agonist (Fig. 3F). Peptide 
sequencing by Edman degradation revealed SpeB cleaved after Phe105, 11 amino acids that 
are N-terminal to the Asp116 site of caspase-1 cleavage. To corroborate these cleavages, we 
created a set of internally quenched peptides to quantify proteolysis of this region of pro-
IL-1β (Fig. 3G). Caspase-1 and neutrophil elastase both efficiently cleaved the 
EAYVHDAPV peptide containing the Asp116 and Val114 sites each enzyme is known to 
cleave (Fig. 3G) (22–24). SpeB had no activity toward this peptide but, instead, efficiently 
cleaved the more distal peptide IFFDTWDNE that contained the Phe105 identified by Edman 
degradation that was not previously known to mediate IL-1β activation (Fig. 3G).

 Because IL-1β, but not its canonical inflammasome regulators, suppressed GAS replication, 
we examined whether SpeB was responsible for IL-1β maturation during infection. 
Compared to wild-type GAS, an isogenic SpeB− mutant induced less IL-1β, and its 
proliferation during mouse necrotizing skin infections was not potentiated by anakinra 
treatment (Fig. 4A). Caspase-1 knockout partially rescued the virulence potential of SpeB− 
mutant GAS, suggesting that canonical inflammasome responses can function and provide 
some protection in the absence of SpeB (Fig. 4B). However, because this rescue was not 
concurrent with differences in IL-1β, a role for other inflammasome-regulated processes 
such as pyroptosis is indicated.
Clinical isolates from GAS invasive infections often have mutations in the covR/S two-
component regulator (25, 26) that abolish SpeB expression (17) and confer hypervirulence 
(27). Because invasive infection could be restricted by SpeB activation of IL-1β, we 
hypothesized that IL-1β can select for this pathoadaptive mutation. GAS isolated from mice 
treated with anakinra to inhibit IL-1β signaling had not pathoadaptively switched and 
maintained their SpeB expression (Fig. 5A). In vitro, macrophages are sufficient to select for 
SpeB− GAS (Fig. 5B), and this required IL-1β, but not the inflammasome or other cytokines 
tested (Fig. 5C).
An animal-passaged (AP) GAS strain that had already undergone SpeB inactivation by 
covR/S mutation was unable to induce IL-1β or IL-1α independently of caspase-1 (Fig. 6A). 
This resulted in scant IL-1 signaling from caspase-1−/− bone marrow-derived (BMMs) (Fig. 
6B) and greatly reduced and delayed IL-1 signaling kinetics in wild-type BMMs (fig. S6). 
This IL-1 signaling deficiency rendered these cells less able to control GAS infection (Fig. 
6C), highlighting the importance of IL-1β generated in response to the microbial protease 
SpeB during GAS skin infections (Fig. 7A).
Several proteases other than caspase-1 cleave IL-1β, suggesting extra-inflammasomal 
protease detection might be a conserved pathway for IL-1β activation. Activation by these 
other proteases may have ancestral evolutionary origins, because although less complex 
vertebrates such as fish encode for both IL-1β and the machinery of the inflammasome, such 
inflammasomes do not always activate IL-1β (28). Aspartic acid, the key amino acid 
targeted by caspase family proteases for cleavage, is notably absent within the prodomains 
of many of IL-1β orthologs of several species (Fig. 7B). Thus, proteases other than 
caspase-1 are likely to commonly mediate IL-1β conversion, suggesting a model wherein 
IL-1β evolved to sense aberrant proteolysis, as during pathogenic infection.
DISCUSSION
Although the inflammasome typically plays a central role in the maturation of IL-1β, human 
IL-1β can be activated by other proteases. Here, we show that the infectious pathogen GAS 
induces noncanonical IL‐1β activation in host macrophages and that this occurs via direct 
maturation of the cytokine by the bacterium’s own secreted cysteine protease SpeB. Our 
data support the idea that IL-1β is a sensor of intracellular proteolytic activity whose origins 
might predate the evolution of caspase-dependent processing of IL-1β. Although the 
inflammasome is typically more important for immunity than IL-1β during acute bacterial

 infection, it becomes less relevant in response to a pathogen that itself directly activates 
IL-1β. Activation of the canonical inflammasome by GAS virulence factors such as SLO (6) 
and SpyA (7) occurs in parallel but has a lesser contribution to innate immunity (Fig. 2, C 
and D), likely due to the potential inactivation of these protein toxins by SpeB (fig. S5). 
Through the process of covR/S mutation and loss of SpeB expression in vivo, GAS avoids 
the dominant noncanonical IL-1β innate immune response during progression of invasive 
disease (Fig. 7A). This mechanism may tie back to our original clinical observation that 
pharmacological IL-1β inhibition results in a greater incidence of invasive GAS infection, as 
development of the pathoadaptive covR/S mutation may not be required in the absence of 
IL-1b signaling.
The findings of this paper illustrate a paradigm in which IL-1β and the inflammasome are 
not functionally redundant, with implications for the treatment of inflammatory disease. The 
success of IL-1β–neutralizing therapy demonstrates the critical contribution of this cytokine 
to autoinflammatory disease (29). Because these treatments preserve inflammasome 
function, pyroptosis and the other remaining inflammatory signaling and antimicrobial 
processes of the cell can still provide significant protection from pathogen infection (3). 
Furthermore, IL-1β neutralization can provide therapeutic benefit in instances when IL-1β is 
activated by alternative mechanisms (30). Conversely, therapeutic targeting of the 
inflammasome (for example, NLRP3 or caspase-1 inhibitors) could provide greater 
advantage when IL-1β is not the sole driver of disease pathology. Knowing when these 
pathways act in concert or diverge can provide better targets for the control of inflammation 
because targeting each component of inflammasome signaling can led to different 
therapeutic benefits and carry different infection risks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria and plasmids
The invasive GAS isolate M1T1 5448, its isogenic AP covRS−, ΔspeB, ΔcepA, Δmac, and 
Δralp3 variants, and plasmid complementation by speB (pSpeB) have been previously 
described (14, 17, 31–33). GAS strains were routinely propagated statically at 37°C in Todd 
Hewitt broth (Difco), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and diluted to a 
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for in vitro experiments.
Animal experiments
GAS cultures were grown statically overnight at 37°C in Todd Hewitt broth and washed 
twice in PBS, and 1×108 colony-forming units (CFU) in 100 μL of PBS were injected 
subcutaneously into 7- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratories), caspase-1/-11−/− 
(R. Flavell), or il1β−/− (D. Chaplin) mice, as previously described (34). Where indicated, 
anakinra [50 mg/kg of body weight; Amgen] or MCC950 [20 mg/kg (13)] were delivered 
intravenously daily starting 24 hours before infection. At 72 hours, mice were euthanized by 
CO2 asphyxiation, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and lesions were excised and 
homogenized. Blood and homogenate were dilution plated onto Todd-Hewitt agar plates for 
enumeration of bacterial CFU or used for cytokine quantification by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D Systems or BioLegend). Mice were housed under

 specific pathogen-free conditions, and all use and procedures were approved by the 
University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Cell culture
Macrophages were generated from femur exudates of wild-type C57BL/6 (Jackson 
Laboratories) or caspase-1/11−/− (R. Flavell), il1R−/− (Jackson Laboratories), il1β−/− (D. 
Chaplin), il18R−/− (Jackson Laboratories), or nlrp3−/− (Millennium Pharmaceuticals) mice 
as previously described (35). One hour before infection, the medium was replaced with 
medium lacking fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Inhibitor treatments were added 1 hour 
before infection and included anakinra (20 mg/ml; Amgen); 10 μM VX-765 (Invivogen); 50 
μM MCC950 (13); 10 μg/mL complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche); recombinant 
IL-1β (100 ng/mL; R&D Systems); 5 μM caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk, YVAD-fmk, 
DEVD-fmk, and IETD-fmk (R&D Systems); 50 μM E-64 (Sigma); or 10 μM benzyl-
(cyanomethyl)carbamate (Sigma). GAS 5448, GBS COH1, GCS MGCS10565, or MRSA 
USA300 was grown overnight at 37°C and diluted in PBS to a MOI of 10 for in vitro 
experiments. Purified PAMPs include LPS (100 ng/mL, from E. coli O111:B4; Sigma), 5 
mM ATP (Sigma), FliC (1 μg/mL, from S. typhimurium; Invivogen), poly(dA:dT) (1 μg/mL; 
Boehringer-Mannheim), and monosodium urate crystals (100 μg/mL; Invivogen). Cells were 
analyzed 2 hours after infection or treatment unless otherwise stated. Only for intracellular 
bacterial survival experiments, the medium was supplemented with gentamicin (100 μg/mL) 
30 min before the terminal time point, and then, the cells were washed once in PBS and 
lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100 for dilution plating and CFU enumeration on Todd Hewitt 
agar plates.
HEK293 cells cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were 
transfected with pIL-1β (36), pCaspase-1 or pCaspase-7 (35), or pSpeB or catalytic mutant 
pSpeBC192A (14) using Lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Cells or supernatants were harvested 24 hours after transfection for analysis, unless 
otherwise stated. Human neutrophils [polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)] isolated from 
healthy donors using Polymorphprep (Axis-Shield) in accordance with the UCSD Human 
Research Protections Program and HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured in RPMI as 
previously described (34).
Measurements of cytokines and cell death
Cell death was quantified by release of lactate dehydrogenase (CytoTox 96 kit; Promega) 
and cytokine release by ELISA (R&D Systems or BioLegend). Caspase-1 activation was 
determined by Fam-YVAD-FMK (ImmunoChemistry Technologies) staining of 
macrophages infected on glass coverslips, as previously described (35). Cell permeability 
was monitored in parallel by staining with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml; ImmunoChemistry 
Technologies). Caspase-1 activation and cell death were enumerated by counting the fraction 
of positive cells in at least four separate fields. Subcellular localization of SpeB and IL-1β 
was examined in macrophages 1 hour after infection with GAS at MOI of 10. Cells were 
washed in PBS, fixed with Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), incubated with anti-IL-1β (R&D 
Systems) or anti-SpeB (Toxin Technology, Inc.) antibodies and detected with Alexa Fluor-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence images were collected

 using an Axio Observer D1 microscope (Zeiss). Images were processed by identical 
adjustments for brightness and contrast in ImageJ.
Protein methods
Western blots for IL-1β cleavage were performed on cells infected or transfected as outlined 
above. In blots of secreted proteins, samples were concentrated by mixing supernatants with 
an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate (Teknova). After SDS–polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (PAGE) and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blots were 
probed with anti-IL-1β antibody (R&D Systems). Anti-SpyA (7) and anti-SLO (Abnova) 
antibodies were used to examine expression of canonical GAS PAMPs in cultured GAS. 
Blots were developed with infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences) 
and visualized on an Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR Biosciences).
For assays with purified proteins, 300 ng of recombinant pro-IL-1β (Sino Biological Inc.) 
was incubated with 1.24 ng of SpeB at room temperature in assay buffer (PBS with 2 mM 
dithiothreitol). At the indicated time intervals, reactions were quenched by the addition of 
LDS-PAGE buffer and heated to 95°C for 5 min, and then run on SDS-PAGE; proteins 
visualized by silver stain (Thermo Fisher), or incubated with 10 μM E-64 (Sigma); and 
activity was measured with IL-1R reporter cells (Invivogen). For sequencing of the protein 
cleavage site, 3 μg of recombinant pro-IL-1β (Sino Biological Inc.) was incubated for 18 
hours with 1.24 ng of SpeB at room temperature in assay buffer (PBS with 2 mM 
dithiothreitol). Proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-PSQ membrane 
(Millipore), and then stained with Coomassie blue. The indicated band was cut out of the 
membrane and sequenced by Edman degradation by Bio-Synthesis Inc.
Internally-quenched peptides of the sequences of IFFDTWDNE, TWDNEAYVH, 
EAYVHDAPV, and HDAPVRSLN, corresponding to amino acids 103 to 111, 107 to 115, 
111 to 119, and 115 to 123 of the reference human pro-IL-1β sequence (UniProt: P01584), 
were labeled on the N terminus with Mca and the C terminus with Lys-Dnp (CPC 
Scientific). In triplicate, 10 μM peptides were incubated in assay buffer (PBS with 5 mM 
dithiothreitol and 0.01% Tween-20) with 5 nM human neutrophil elastase (VWR), human 
caspase-1 (Enzo), or SpeB from 5448 GAS. The reaction was continuously monitored using 
an EnSpire plate reader (PerkinElmer) with fluorophore excitation at 323 nm and emission 
at 398 nm, and the maximum kinetic velocity in triplicate samples was calculated, as 
previously described (37).
IL-1 signaling assay
Relative IL-1 signaling by macrophages was measured by removing 50 μl of supernatants 
from infected or treated cells onto transgenic IL-1R reporter cells (Invivogen). After 18 
hours, reporter cell supernatants were analyzed for secreted alkaline phosphatase activity by 
addition of 30 μl of IL-1R reporter cell supernatant onto 70 μl of HEK-Blue Detection 
reagent (Invivogen) and reading the optical density at 620 nm via EnSpire plate reader 
(PerkinElmer).
A protease-labile mAmetrine-tdTomato FRET construct (21) was used as a biosensor 
reference for total proteolysis activity. HEK293T cells (2 × 104) stably expressing the FRET

 sensor were transiently transfected with 400 ng of pIL-1β (36) in black 96-well plates 
(Costar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were gently washed twice in RPMI free 
of serum and phenol red. Neutrophil elastase (1 μg/mL; VWR), caspase-1 (Enzo), or SpeB 
was made in fourfold dilutions from this concentration and packaged into TransFast 
liposomes (Promega) using established methods (38). In parallel, LPS (100 ng/mL, from E. 
coli O111:B4; Sigma), 5 mM ATP (Sigma), FliC (1 μg/mL, from Salmonella typhimurium; 
Invivogen), poly(dA:dT) (1 μg/mL; Boehringer-Mannheim), Streptococcus pyogenes SLO 
(1 μg/mL; Fisher), or Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (100 ng/mL; List Biological 
Laboratories) was prepared with these liposomes as controls. Cells transfected with 
proteases or inflammasome PAMPs were monitored with an EnSpire plate reader 
(PerkinElmer) measuring change in FRET with emission at 526 and 581 nm after excitation 
at 406 nm. Cell supernatants were analyzed by the relative IL-1R signaling assay.
SpeB switching assay
Single CFU were assayed for total protease activity was measured by hydrolysis of 
azocasein (Sigma) or casein (Sigma) by methods previously described (31). Alternatively, 
switching was confirmed by monitoring hyperencapsulation by hyaluronic acid assay 
(Corgenix), as previously described (25). At least eight isolates from each biological 
replicate were analyzed, and phenotypic conversion is expressed as the percentage of 
isolates with a heritable loss of casein proteolysis. In each instance, wild-type GAS 
inoculum was found to contain only a SpeB+ cell population.

The FAERS database (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm135151) was 
reviewed as in (39) for reports of infections associated with Anakinra use from 2004 to 
2014. Reports were manually screened, and cases with identifiers indicative of duplicated 
records were excluded from analysis, as outlined in the Supplementary Methods. 
Proportional reporting risk analysis was assigned by incidence of adverse outcome 
(infection) in reports containing anakinra relative to incidence of the same outcome in all 
reports where anakinra is not indicated.
Statistical analysis
The Prism software package (GraphPad) was used to calculate statistical significance by 
unpaired two-sided Student’s t test (*P < 0.05). All calculations are presented in table S1.

 Fig. 1. IL-1 inhibition is associated with severe invasive GAS infection
(A) Proportional reporting risk of bacterial species overrepresented in infections associated 
with the IL-1 signaling inhibitor anakinra (M. tb., Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and the 
types of GAS infection associated with IL-1 inhibition (APSGN, acute poststreptococcal 
glomerulonephritis). Proportional reporting of streptococcal NF infection in individuals 
taking IL-1 inhibitors compared with incidents associated with other classes of anti-
inflammatories prescribed for the same conditions, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 
IL-6, CD20 (rituximab), disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as 
methotrexate, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Several of these drugs 
have been described in single case reports to be associated with streptococcal NF (40–44) 
except for anakinra, although it is the most overreported in the FAERS. (B) Reported 
outcomes of streptococcal NF infections associated with anakinra compared to all other 
drugs.

 Fig. 7. Models of IL-1β activation
(A) Diagram of IL-1β signaling during GAS infection. IL-1β is processed by both caspase-1 
through canonical inflammasome pathways and directly by SpeB via an alternative pathway 
to result in pathogen-restrictive inflammation. The covR/S− pathoadaptation that occurs 
during invasive infection represses SpeB to prevent alternative activation of IL-1β and allow 
evasion of IL-1β-induced immune mechanisms. mIL-1b, mature IL-1β. (B) Alignment of 
the activation region of IL-1β in vertebrates with potentially caspase-targeted aspartic acids 
highlighted, and compared to the conservation of related signaling and inflammasome 
proteins. PRR, pattern recognition receptor; D. melanogaster, Drosophila melanogaster; 
NLRC, nuclear oligomerization domain-like protein subfamily C; PHYIN, pyrin and HIN 
domain; ASC, apoptotic speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain.
