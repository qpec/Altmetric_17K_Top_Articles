The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a “state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity.” Despite general acceptance of this
comprehensive definition, there has been little rigorous scientific
attempt to use it to measure and assess population health. Instead,
the dominant model of health is a disease-centered Medical Model
(MM), which actively ignores many relevant domains. In contrast to
the MM, we approach this issue through a Comprehensive Model
(CM) of health consistent with the WHO definition, giving statisti-
cally equal consideration to multiple health domains, including med-
ical, physical, psychological, functional, and sensory measures. We
apply a data-driven latent class analysis (LCA) to model 54 specific
health variables from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging
Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of US commu-
nity-dwelling older adults. We first apply the LCA to the MM, iden-
tifying five health classes differentiated primarily by having diabetes
and hypertension. The CM identifies a broader range of six health
classes, including two “emergent” classes completely obscured by
the MM. We find that specific medical diagnoses (cancer and hyper-
tension) and health behaviors (smoking) are far less important than
mental health (loneliness), sensory function (hearing), mobility, and
bone fractures in defining vulnerable health classes. Although the
MM places two-thirds of the US population into “robust health”
classes, the CM reveals that one-half belong to less healthy classes,
independently associated with higher mortality. This reconceptuali-
zation has important implications for medical care delivery, preven-
tive health practices, and resource allocation.

I
n 1946, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health
as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (1). In 1977, George
Engel (2) built on this definition, calling for a new biopsychosocial
model. It integrated traditional medicine with psychosocial factors,
which stimulated the field of psychosomatic medicine. These ideas
have been honored more as an ideal than in practice.
Here, we seek to apply this comprehensive definition to charac-
terize the health of US older adults living in their homes. Studying a
representative sample of the US population ages 57–85 y old [the
National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP)], we
gathered wide-ranging information on the diseases of the traditional
“Medical Model” (MM) and also, psychological well-being and
physical function in a “Comprehensive Model” (CM) informed by
the approach by Engel (2, 3). We empirically determined if these
health measures formed distinct constellations, characterizing
groups of people with different patterns of health and well-being.
Our large survey of 3,005 community-dwelling older adults ages
57–85 y old was not a clinical sample or a sample of convenience
but one systematically selected to represent all older, community-
dwelling adults of the United States, regardless of their health status.
The standard MM of health, sometimes called the biomedical
model, has its origins in the 1910 Flexner Report (4), which codi-
fied medical education and focuses on diseases, specifically their
pathology, biochemistry, and physiology (5–8). It is exemplified in
hospital-based care responding to failure of specific organ systems,
codified in international health care reimbursement categories
[International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (9)] and
historically instantiated in the organization of the National Insti-
tutes of Health [e.g., National Cancer Institute (1937) and National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (1948) (10)].
More typically, however, older adults often have more than one
organ system-based disease (e.g., both diabetes and hypertension),
forming a cluster of problems (11), although their other organ
systems continue to function (e.g., kidneys and lungs). Therefore,
our first step was to empirically identify distinct constellations of
health states within the MM. We used data on prevalent causes of
death to select diseases for inclusion (12). These selected diseases
are heart disease, cancer, lung disease, stroke, diabetes, kidney
disease, and liver disease. We also include common diseases in
older adults, albeit with low associated mortality: arthritis, hy-
pertension, asthma, and thyroid disease (measures 1–19 in Fig. S1
document the organ system diseases).
We then propose the CM intended to correspond theoretically
to the health definitions of the WHO (1) and Engel (2) by incor-
porating five additional functional dimensions relevant for broadly
characterizing health and well-being: health behaviors, psycholog-
ical health, sensory abilities, neuroimmune function, and mobility
(Fig. S1). These dimensions and the domains within them are not
part of the biomedical model (2). They reflect the integrative role
of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous
system with behavior (13, 14) and undergird the robust health
Significance
Health has long been conceived as not just the absence of disease
but also the presence of physical, psychological, and social well-
being. Nonetheless, the traditional medical model focuses on
specific organ system diseases. This representative study of US
older adults living in their homes amassed not only comprehen-
sive medical information but also psychological and social data
and measured sensory function and mobility, all key factors for
independent living and a gratifying life. This comprehensive
model revealed six unique health classes, predicting mortality/
incapacity. The healthiest people were obese and robust; two
new classes, with twice the mortality/incapacity, were people
with healed broken bones or poor mental health. This approach
provides an empirical method for broadly reconceptualizing
health, which may inform health policy.

 crucial to quality of life and continued independence in older
adults (15, 16). The additional 35 health measures (Fig. S1, mea-
sures 20–54), although not exhaustive, were selected to represent all
five dimensions. For conceptual clarity and analytic tractability, we
focus our analysis on physical and psychological domains of these
dimensions, keeping the individual at the center of the analysis. We
consider the social domains only in relation to these other person-
centered domains and characterize people in terms of marital status,
sexual intimacy, social interactions, and socioeconomic status as well
as age, race, and gender.
To group all respondents into distinct constellations or classes
based on their multiple health measures, we used latent class
analysis (LCA; also called finite mixture modeling) (17). LCA
posits an underlying structure to a population that is not directly
observable but can be identified using a sufficiently large collection
of observable variables. The LCA then identifies distinct subgroups
or classes within the larger population based on underlying com-
monalities among variables, commonalities that are assumed to
arise from the underlying “latent” characteristic. After the classes
have been identified mathematically (specifying the constellation
of values of the health measures that group together), each re-
spondent can be assigned to the most appropriate class based on
his or her particular values for each of the health measures.
We ask several questions. What are the health characteristics
that appear together in each of the classes identified? Which health
measures best discriminate among the constellations? We report
the prevalence of all health measures in each class relative to the
general US population. We use heat maps (Figs. 1 and 2), in which
each cell is color-coded to indicate prevalence of a measure sig-
nificantly lower than, typical of, or higher than the general pop-
ulation (green, yellow, and red, respectively). The resulting heat
map presents a visual snapshot of the characteristics of the classes
across all health measures, allowing the reader to scan down
characteristics for each class and across classes for different groups
of characteristics, effectively and quickly summarizing constella-
tions of health that appear in the US population of older adults.
We hypothesized that including the measures covering the five
additional dimensions of the CM of health would significantly
change the constellation of characteristics defining distinct groups
of older adults in the United States. Doing so, we argue, would
illuminate the significant associations between functioning, well-
being, and disease in older people. If so, these new constellations
would create a richer picture of the diverse types of aging and could
inform the ongoing restructuring of the US health care system.
To robustly validate the health of individuals within each health
class, we used three standard health measures that were independent
of the LCAs: (i) the number of vulnerable health measures per in-
dividual, with vulnerable defined by clinical or literature-based cut
points (Figs. 1 and 2 and Fig. S1); (ii) the number of the major
chronic diseases that each individual had [defined by the Charlson
Index (18, 19); labeled as Charlson comorbid diseases], and (iii) the
proportion of individuals in each class who died or were too in-
capacitated to be interviewed by the time of the second wave of data
collection (labeled as deceased or incapacitated 5 y later). We refer
to these three measures as the mortality and morbidity of the indi-
viduals within a class. The person’s subjective assessments of global
physical and mental health are additional validators of the health
classes (20, 21).
Aging has been conceptualized as the increasing loss of physi-
ologic function, a trajectory followed by most people as they get
older (22). If so, health classes in an aging population should be
arranged linearly by chronological age as people progress from one
class to the other in sequence. Alternatively, aging can be con-
ceptualized as a diverse set of pathways (23, 24), with chronological
age being a poor predictor of whether an aging pathway or sus-
tained health will be followed. We follow individuals over a 5-y
period, assessing the likelihood of stable class membership and the
transition to improvement, incapacitation, or death.
Results
MM: Distinct Classes Distinguished by Diabetes and Hypertension.
Analysis of the organ system diseases of the MM identified five
distinct classes of disease and health among older, community-
dwelling Americans, each statistically independent of the others
(Fig. 1). Diabetes, which accounted for only 3% of deaths over the
age of 55 y old in 2010 (25), nonetheless had the greatest power to
distinguish among these five health classes, dividing the five into
two broader sets. One set was very robust, with a complete ab-
sence of diagnosed diabetes (0%) and only 7% (MM1) and 2%
(MM2) with measured diabetes [HbA1C > 6.5 (26)] (Fig. 1,
measures 1 and 2). The other set was quite vulnerable to diabetes
and other diseases (MM3–5: 39–100% had diagnosed diabetes
and 30–69% had measured diabetes).
Cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 1, measures 4–10), which account
for 35% of deaths over the age of 55 y old (25), did not distinguish
robust from vulnerable classes. Rather, blood pressure measured
in the home distinguished the two robust nondiabetic classes. No
one in MM1 [Unrecognized Hypertension class] had normal systolic
blood pressure; 100% were elevated (61% into hypertension stage
I or II). In sharp contrast, 0% of the second robust class (MM2
One Noncardiovascular Disease) had hypertensive blood pressure,
and even the 34% diagnosed with hypertension were well-con-
trolled. Instead, most in MM2 had only one, if any, of a variety of
noncardiovascular diseases or conditions (e.g., asthma, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease, thyroid disease, ulcers, or cancer) (27).

The MM with five distinct classes of organ system diseases and health.
The column US population (US Pop.) reports the prevalence in 2005 of each
disease in the older US Pop. ages 57–85 y old. Within each health class (col-
umns), the prevalence of a given disease indexes the likelihood that any
member of the class has that particular disease [rows; n = 19 health measures
ordered by prevalence within each of the six domains (column 2) within the
organ system dimension (column 1)] and shares similar constellations of dis-
ease and health. Colors indicate the prevalence of each class’s disease preva-
lence relative to the US Pop.: green, lower (P ≤ 0.01); yellow, typical [not
significant (NS)]; red, higher (P ≤ 0.01). Morbidity was indexed by the pro-
portion of class members who were incapacitated (i.e., too sick to interview at
the 5-y follow-up), and mortality was indexed by the proportion who had died.
*Given the health context of extensive multimorbidity, the classification of
these blood pressure measures was overridden and designated vulnerable
(red). BP, blood pressure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CV,
cardiovascular; CVD, cardiovascular disease; HTN, hypertension.

The CM of health with six distinct health classes based on 54 health measures across six dimensions (listed in column 1). The column US population (US Pop.)
reports the prevalence in 2005 of each disease or condition in the older US Pop. ages 57–85 y old (definitions and validation are in Fig. S1). Within each health class
(columns), the prevalence of a given disease or condition indexes the likelihood that any member of the class has that particular disease [rows; n = 54 health measures
ordered by prevalence within each health domain (column 2)] and shares similar constellations of disease and health. Colors indicate the prevalence of each class’s
disease and conditions relative to the US Pop.: green, lower (P ≤ 0.01); yellow, typical [not significant (NS)]; red, higher (P ≤ 0.01; indicating greater vulnerability).
Morbidity was indexed by the proportion of class members who were incapacitated and too sick to interview at the 5-y follow-up, and mortality was indexed by the
proportion who had died. *Given the health context of extensive multimorbidity, the classification of these blood pressure measures was overridden and designated
vulnerable (red). ADL, activities of daily living; BP, blood pressure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HTN, hypertension; ID, identification; STD, sexually
transmitted diseases.

 All three indicators of mortality and morbidity (bottom three
rows of Fig. 1) were significantly lower in the two robust classes
(MM1 and -2) than in the overall population. These classes had
the fewest number of health measures signifying disease as well
as the lowest prevalence of physician-identified organ system
diseases (Charlson comorbid diseases) (Fig. 1) (18, 19). Fully
two-thirds of older adults in America were members of these
robust classes.
Surprisingly, although cancer caused 24% of deaths among those
over the age 55 y old in 2005 (25), no cancer type distinguished the
five MM classes (Fig. 1, measures 17–19). Rather, cancers seemed
to develop randomly with respect to other organ system diseases.
The three vulnerable classes (MM3–5) shared a high prevalence
of diabetes and hypertensive blood pressure but were distinguished
by their constellations of other diseases. The Uncontrolled Diabetes
class (MM3) was comprised entirely of diagnosed diabetics (100%),
primarily uncontrolled (69% HbA1C > 6.5). Most (70%) were also
diagnosed with hypertension, but it was well-controlled in the home
interview (only 32% with systolic blood pressure in hypertension
stage I or II), reflecting the recommended clinical practice of
controlling hypertension before diabetes. In addition, one-half had
arthritis (49%), which is typical of older adults, and 3% had severe
liver disease, three times more than the overall population. In sum,
they had more diseases than the general population (4.0, vulnera-
ble health measures; 2.2, Charlson comorbid diseases).
Members of the remaining two diabetic classes (MM4 and -5)
were the most vulnerable. In MM4, the prevalence of diabetes was
twice that of the older population nationally, and most had been
diagnosed with hypertension that was not controlled when measured
at home (76–89%), with 0% in the normal range. Strikingly, car-
diovascular diseases were two to three times more prevalent in
MM4 than in the older US population, defining it as the Cardio-
vascular Disease and Diabetes class. Only arthritis and peptic ulcers
had a higher prevalence, whereas lung, kidney, and liver diseases
were typical of the general population, and cancer prevalence was
low. The fifth most vulnerable class had a very high prevalence of all
diseases, making it the Extensive Multimorbidity class. Of note, the
measured blood pressure of those in this class was usually lower than
that in the other classes, consistent with advanced heart failure (28).
The characterization of the MM classes as either robust or vul-
nerable was independently supported by the 2.5-fold difference
across the classes in the prevalence of being incapacitated or de-
ceased (bottom row of Fig. 1). Of the two robust classes, 14% and
15% were incapacitated or deceased 5 y later, respectively, signifi-
cantly lower than the three vulnerable classes at 20%, 24%, and 35%.
The constellations of diseases in the five MM classes are con-
sistent with the traditional MM of organ system diseases with two
added contributions. Diabetes and elevated blood pressure were
identified as the “first tier” traits distinguishing among health
classes of older community-dwelling adults. In addition, cancers did
not form a distinct health class. Moreover, this analysis reveals that
there are no significant differences in chronological age among the
five classes, supporting the hypothesis that health and well-being of
older adults do not follow a single linear progression and are as-
sociated less with age than with such sociodemographic traits as
race, education, and gender (23, 29).
CM of Health: New Constellations of Disease and Health. Organ
function is coordinated in part by the CNS and the peripheral
nervous system, which also integrate the body with the social and
physical worlds essential for health and well-being. To create a CM
of health, we augmented the MM with 35 measures drawn from five
additional health dimensions involving the nervous systems: health
behaviors, such as smoking, exercise, and sleep; psychological health
(i.e., mental health and cognition); sensory function, such as vision
and olfaction; neuroimmunity; and frailty. Within each dimension,
specific domains included measures of conditions common at older
ages, such as depressive symptoms, memory loss, poor vision,
chronic inflammation, and impaired mobility. They also included
trauma, such as bone fractures, as well as health behaviors, such
as body composition, sleep quality, drinking, smoking, and sexu-
ally transmitted diseases. Although some of these comprehensive
measures are physical, none are part of the standard MM (2).
Six distinct, statistically independent health classes emerged (Fig.
2). Many individuals categorized as in robust health by the MM
were revealed to have important health vulnerabilities when the
broader definition of health was used. Conversely, some with organ
system disease showed many counterbalancing strengths, leading to
a reassignment to a robust health class in the CM. Many individuals
were reclassified from their MM classes to different CM classes (Fig.
3), yielding a rich reconceptualization of what constitutes health and
well-being in the older population at home in the United States,
characterized by specific constellations of disease and function.
The CM identified two types of robust health at older ages (CM1
and -2), strikingly different from those identified by the MM and
also, strikingly different from each other. Obesity characterized the
first robust class, which comprised 22% of the older US population
[54% of the Robust Obese class had an obese body mass index (BMI;
41% moderately obese and 13% morbidly obese; 0% had a normal
BMI), and 60% had central obesity] (Fig. 2, measures 20 and 21).
This class was also characterized by elevated blood pressure mea-
sured at home (45% systolic blood pressure hypertension stage I or
II and 31% diastolic hypertension stage I or II) (Fig. 2 measures 5
and 6) (30). Although obesity is typically viewed as a severe health
risk (31), this obese class had few organ system diseases or condi-
tions per individual (Fig. 2) (individual average: 7.2, vulnerable
health measures; 1.2, Charlson comorbid diseases). This class
(CM1) had the lowest prevalence of dying or becoming in-
capacitated 5 y later (6%; one-third the prevalence in the general
population), supporting the emerging concept that being over-
weight without complications and impaired mobility is not always
deleterious to health, particularly in older adults (31–34). This class
had notably better psychological health than the overall older
population as well as better mobility and sensory function (other
than taste) [Fig. S2A presents odds ratios (ORs) for the constella-
tion of health characteristics, whose presence and absence distin-
guished the Robust Obese class from the rest of the population].
In marked contrast, people in the second robust class (One Minor
Condition, CM2) were normal weight (0% central obesity and ≤1%

 obese; central obesity OR = 0.048; P = 0.001) (Fig. 2, measures 20
and 21 and Fig. S2A), with a low prevalence of cardiovascular dis-
eases and diabetes. Instead, people in this class had one minor
condition or disease [(e.g., peptic ulcers, problems with voiding,
skin cancer, thyroid disease, or anemia (Fig. 2, measures 3, 14, 17,
49, and 53 and Fig. S2A)]. Although none of these are recognized
high-risk factors for death, let alone its causes, the prevalence of
dying or being incapacitated 5 y later (16%) was significantly higher
than in the Robust Obese class, suggesting that these “minor” con-
ditions could be early harbingers of vulnerability and might mandate
aggressive preventive care, although cardiovascular, metabolic, lung,
and kidney functions are robust. This class also had worse sensory
function than the Robust Obese class (Fig. 2, measures 35–40),
particularly hearing (Fig. S2A).
With two different models for defining health classes, we can ask
which best discriminates robust health at older ages. The MM
classified fully two-thirds of the older US population as robust in
two classes with a low prevalence of disease (Fig. 1). The definition
of robust health was fine-tuned by the CM; only one-half (54%) of
people identified as robust in the MM were also assigned to the
robust classes in the CM (Fig. 3, columns 2 and 3). But what of the
other one-half deemed in robust health by the traditional MM?
Most were reassigned to two emergent classes (CM3 and -4)
defined by traits actively ignored by the MM, which together
comprised fully 28% of the US population (Figs. 2 and 3). The first
new class (CM3) was characterized by people who had broken a
bone after age 45 y old (100% of Broken Bones class; OR = 61)
(Fig. S2B) and had the highest prevalence of osteoporotic fractures
(28%; OR = 27.7) (Fig. 2, measures 47 and 48). These healed bone
fractures were not the well-recognized end-of-life hip fractures that
can lead to immobilization and eventually death from complica-
tions. Its members were less likely to be immobile, be inactive, or
have trouble walking than the general population (0.152 ≤ OR ≤
0.43) (Fig. S2B). In sharp contrast, mental health problems, poor
sleep, and heavy drinking characterized the second new class (CM4;
Poor Mental Health, particularly depression; OR = 12.4 (Fig. 2,
measures 22–25 and 29–32 and Fig. S2B) along with poor olfactory
function and slow gait, known correlates of depression (35, 36), as
well as voiding dysfunction (Fig. 2, measures 39, 43, and 53).
None of the traditional medical health classes predicted mem-
bership in the new Broken Bones or Poor Mental Health classes, al-
though participants from all MM classes were reassigned to these two
new classes, underscoring the unique contribution of the CM and its
additional health dimensions (0.7 ≤ all ORs ≤ 1.3; all NS) (Fig. 3).
The Broken Bones class had a lower prevalence of diabetes but other
than that, intermediate prevalence of organ system diseases typical of
the older US population (Fig. 2, measures 1–19). Their mobility was
relatively robust as was their mental and cognitive health. The Poor
Mental Health class also had typical prevalence of traditional organ
system diseases accompanied by normal weight and a low prevalence
of immune surveillance dysfunction (Fig. 2, measures 1–20 and 41).
Finally, the two most vulnerable classes (CM5 and -6) were
characterized by multiple comorbid diseases, which are common
causes of death among older adults. In CM5 (Diabetes, Hyperten-
sion, and Immobility), uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension were
more common than in the general population as were immobility
and urinary incontinence, obesity (particularly morbid obesity at
36% and moderate at 35%), arthritis, peptic ulcers, and impaired
immune function along with impaired vision, hearing, and touch
(Fig. 2, measures 1, 2, 4–7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, 29, 37, 38, 40–46, 50,
and 52). Nonetheless, they had lower odds of all mental health
problems than the rest of the population (0.295 ≤ OR ≤ 0.74) (Fig.
S2C). In contrast, the most vulnerable class (Extensive Multi-
morbidity and Frailty) was distinguished by poor mental health
(anxiety OR = 5.2) (Fig. S2C) and a high prevalence of 47 of 54
measures indicating disease and health conditions, including car-
diac, lung, liver, and kidney diseases and nonreproductive cancers as
well as poor mental health, memory, and sensory function. As
expected, these two most vulnerable classes had more diseases than
older adults in the United States (individual averages of 12.1 and
17.0, vulnerable health conditions and 2.2 and 3.3, Charlson
comorbid diseases in CM5 and -6, respectively) (Fig. 2). Although
the Extensive Multimorbidity and Frailty class (CM6) had the highest
concordance with the most vulnerable MM class [38% of those with
extensive multisystem disease (MM5) were reclassified to Extensive
Multimorbidity and Frailty (CM6) with an OR = 6.1] (Fig. 3), a
majority came from other classes. The marked increase in the
proportion of women in the most vulnerable classes between the
MM and CM (39% vs. 65% women) (Fig. 4) indicates the two most
vulnerable classes in these two models are quite distinct.
Fully 44% of this most vulnerable class [Extensive Multimorbidity
and Frailty (CM6)] died within 5 y of the original interview or be-
came incapacitated (Fig. 2), making its constellation of diseases a
much better predictor of poor health outcomes than the MM based
only on organ system diseases. In sum, the CM differentiated classes
with more precision than the MM, because it expanded the range of
class differences in prevalence of dying or becoming incapacitated
from a 2.5-fold to a 7.3-fold range (14–35% to 6–44%).
Causes of Mortality and Morbidity. In both models, the causes of
death and becoming incapacitated were reassuringly consistent with
the most prevalent diseases in a particular class. For example, in the
three “diabetes” classes (MM3–5), deaths caused by diabetes, car-
diovascular disease, and genitourinary complications were higher
than the population average (Fig. S3A). In CM4, a class defined by
mental health problems, deaths from substance abuse and suicide/
homicide were higher than in either most robust or more vulnerable
classes (Fig. S3B).
More interestingly, deaths from cancer confirmed its random
occurrence with respect to the health classes identified in both the
MM and the CM of health. Deaths from cancer were higher than
average in the healthier MM2 class, but in MM5, the most vul-
nerable class, cancer deaths were lower than the population average
(Fig. S3A). Likewise, cancer more often afflicted the healthiest
classes of the CM (CM1 and -2) (Fig. S3A), whereas in CM5,
deaths were more often caused by cardiovascular, diabetic, and
elimination system diseases rather than cancer. This pattern is
consistent with a “competing causes of death” model, in which
prevalence of a more randomly distributed cause of death (in this
case cancer) is highest when other causes of death are low.
The most common disease causing incapacity 5 y later and pre-
venting a second interview was dementia or other mental de-
terioration (63% across all classes) (Fig. S3B). Strikingly, frailty or
accidents in the intervening 5 y were three to five times more likely
to incapacitate the Broken Bones class (CM3). Additionally, no one
was incapacitated by alcohol, drug abuse, or suicide attempts, except
those in the Poor Mental Health class (9% of CM4), showing that
identifying this novel health class has prognostic power over 5 y.
Sexual Motivation and Social Ties. After assigning participants to a
latent class based on their health measures [average assignment
certainty = 0.83 (MM) and 0.89 (CM)], we sought to characterize
the classes in terms of the participants’ social and demographic
traits. At older ages, sexual motivation can be a key component of
social connection, vitality, and well-being (37–39). A fourfold dif-
ference in sexual motivation, indexed by sexual ideation (40), sig-
nificantly distinguished the health classes in the CM [only 12% of
the Robust Obese (CM1) class rarely thought about sex (less than
once a month) in contrast with 52% of Extensive Multimorbidity and
Frailty (CM6)] (Fig. 5B). In the MM, however, sexual motivation
did not differ among its health classes (range = 26–33%) (Fig. 5A).
Likewise, social lives differed more among the CM than among
the MM classes; only MM1 and -2, the robust classes, were more
engaged socially than the US population and even so, on only a few
measures (Fig. 5A) (41–45). The two robust classes of the CM
(CM1 and -2) had stronger and more varied social lives than the

 US population [e.g., more members of Robust Obese (CM1) were
married, and few felt socially isolated, lived alone, or had low social
participation] (Fig. 5B).
There was a socially embedded class and an isolated class
within both the intermediate (CM3 and -4) and the vulnerable
classes (CM5 and -6) (Fig. 5B). Members of the intermediate
classes [Broken Bones (CM3)] rarely felt isolated (13%), had low
social participation (14%), or a small social network (11%). In
stark contrast, members of Poor Mental Health (CM4) were the
most likely to feel isolated (64%), live alone (38%), rarely
participate socially (37%), and have small social networks
(23%). A similar dichotomy was observed within the vulnerable
classes. Members of Diabetes, Hypertension, and Immobility (CM5)
were less likely to feel isolated (17%) and as socially engaged as
the general population, whereas 45% of the most vulnerable
Extensive Multimorbidity and Frailty (CM6) felt isolated, were not
socially engaged (35%), and lived alone (32%). The marked dif-
ferences in social characteristics captured by the CM are clinically
relevant, because social connections affect not only well-being but
also, access to health care and compliance (46–48).
Demographics of the Classes. CM classes did not differ in age from
the population average, with the exception of the sickest class
(Extensive Multimorbidity and Frailty), which is 3 y older, and the
Robust Obese class, which is 2.5 y younger (Fig. 4B), indicating that
the health classes are not simply a strong age gradient. However,
they did differ significantly in terms of gender, race, education, and
household financial assets (Fig. 4B), again with greater differences
within the CM than within the MM (Fig. 4A).
The two healthiest classes (CM1 and -2) were, on average,
disproportionately men of all races, with more education and
assets than the population as a whole. The Broken Bones class
(CM3) was predominantly white women. Members of the Poor
Mental Health class (CM4) were more likely to live alone with
moderate income. Members of the Diabetes, Hypertension, and
Immobility class (CM5) were more likely to be black, not have a
high school degree, and have assets under $50,000. The most
vulnerable class, Extensive Multimorbidity and Frailty (CM6), was
disproportionately older women of all races, also with low edu-
cation and few household assets.
Class Stability over 5 y. We sought to confirm the CM by de-
termining whether the same health classes emerged in 2010 when
we followed the same LCA procedures (SI Methods and Fig. S4).
We asked whether the health class structure of the population
persisted as states of being over 5 y or whether it changed as the
population aged and new participants were recruited. We found
that the six class structure did persist virtually unchanged in 2010
with constellations of disease and characteristics similar to those in
2005, replicating the health classes derived from the CM (compare
Fig. 2 with Fig. S4).
We then asked whether individuals also persisted in their classes
in the intervening 5 y, which would be expected if membership was
the cumulative result of having lived their particular lives. Indeed,
those in good health in 2005 often remained in good health (CM1
OR = 6.65; CM2 OR = 6.79; both P values ≤ 0.001). Likewise,
people in the most vulnerable health class with multiple comorbid
diseases in 2005 remained so (CM6 OR = 5.87; P ≤ 0.001) and faced
a high risk of death or becoming incapacitated (OR = 4.44; P ≤
0.001). Those in intermediate health classes were also significantly
likely to remain in their 2005 classes but with lower odds, particularly
Poor Mental Health (CM4) (CM3 OR = 3.41; CM4 OR = 1.57; CM5
OR = 3.33; all P values ≤ 0.001).
Discussion
In defining health in older adults, medicine traditionally focuses on
absence of chronic diseases of major organ systems; those without
diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular, kidney, liver, or pulmonary dis-
ease are generally considered healthy. Medications treat hyperten-
sion and elevated cholesterol, risk factors for developing a chronic
disease. When applied to the population of older adults in the
United States, this standard MM (4–8), identifies about two-thirds of
the older US population as generally healthy, with no diseases of
major organ systems. However, a closer look that includes health
behaviors, psychological health, sensory function, neuroimmunity,
and frailty paints a very different picture. It does so by both revealing
constellations of health completely hidden by the MM and reclassi-
fying about one-half of the people seen as healthy as having signifi-
cant vulnerabilities that affect the chances that they die or become
incapacitated within 5 y. At the same time, some people with chronic
disease are revealed as having many strengths that lead to their
reclassification as quite healthy, with low risks of death and incapacity.
A number of surprises appear in the CM. First, cancer, the sec-
ond leading cause of death in the United States, is unrelated to the
presence of organ systems disease (a pattern also seen in the MM;
there is no cancer class). In fact, cancer is unrelated to health be-
haviors, psychological health, sensory function, and frailty. Cancer
seems to appear essentially at random in the general population of
older adults; those who get it either succumb to the disease or are
treated and recover, in which case, they are randomly distributed
across classes like anyone else.

 Second, obesity, often pointed to as “epidemic” and life-threat-
ening (49), characterizes those older adults in the most robust health
as well as in more vulnerable health. Obesity in a person with ex-
cellent mental health, no chronic disease, intact sensory function,
good health habits, and excellent physical functioning seems to pose
very little risk. Obesity in a person with diabetes, poor mental health,
poor sensory function, and poor mobility is a very bad sign in a tidal
wave of bad signs for those in the vulnerable health classes.
Third, having broken a bone during or after middle age uniquely
identifies a class consisting of one in seven older US adults. This is a
class that is “hidden” in the MM of health. This class is about
“average” in other respects, but having broken a bone removes them
from being in one of the robust groups. In a medical history, a past
broken bone might signal osteoporosis risk but little else. However,
according to the CM, a broken bone is a “marker” for future health;
accidents are the primary cause of incapacity 5 y later, and member’s
mortality is as high as the general population. This group is an ex-
cellent “target” for interventions—to prevent these individuals from
declining over time and move them into more robust health.
Fourth, another one in eight older adults is revealed as having
pervasive poor mental health, including high levels of stress, symp-
toms of anxiety and depression, loneliness, unhappiness, and poor
self-esteem. More of the people in this group sleep poorly, wake up
tired, or drink excessively compared with those in other groups. This
constellation of mental health problems and the consequences of
attempts to deal with them stand out from the population of older
adults more generally for the shape and scope of the health prob-
lems those in this group face, including high incapacity and mortality.
They too are completely hidden in the MM of health.
Fifth, the most vulnerable group of older adults has serious
problems in all health dimensions from chronic diseases and neu-
roimmunity to mental health, health behaviors, cognition, sensory
function, and frailty. Note that 44% of this group, which comprises
one older adult in eight living at home, will die or become in-
capacitated in the next 5 y. Only 35% of those in the sickest health
class as identified in the MM died or became incapacitated. Clearly,
the CM contains a great deal of prognostic information left out
of the MM.
Health status in older adults does not correspond with chrono-
logical age; age differentiates only two of the classes at most by 3 y.
The gender story is bigger, with disproportionately more men in the
two robust classes and more women in broken bones and multi-
morbidity and frailty classes. The apparent paradox in having more
men in the youngest and healthiest class and more women in the
oldest and sickest class results directly from men having higher
mortality rates. They die younger, and women survive longer, often
with chronic disease and other aging conditions. This well-known
pattern was not captured by the MM.
The current MM of health emphasizes organ system disease cat-
egories as the fundamental conception of health. A list of “diagnostic
codes,” embodied in the ICD-10 system used to bill for health ser-
vices, is emblematic of this approach. One consequence is that health
policy neglects important aspects of health, such as mental health
(50) and medical training for managing comorbidities in geriatric
populations (51). By using the WHO definition of health, we have
shown how expanding health dimensions and domains and in-
corporating positive aspects of health reveal six unique, replicable
constellations of disease and health, including two previously un-
recognized classes not apparent in the organ disease-focused
MM. From a health system perspective, a shift of attention is
needed from disease-focused management, such as medications
for hypertension or high cholesterol, to overall health, especially
for mental health concerns, sensory function, and mobility.
Although public health campaigns, such as “Choosing Wisely,”
rightly emphasize the need to decrease unnecessary health inter-
ventions (52), they still accept the basic health conception of the
MM as resting on organ system disease. Instead, the CM instan-
tiates comorbidities and the equal importance of mental health,
mobility, and sensory function in health and should inform policy
redesign. For example, including assessments of sensory function,

 mental health, broken bones in middle age, and frailty in annual
physician visits would enhance risk management. In addition to
policies focused on reducing BMI, greater support for preventing
loneliness among isolated older adults would be effective. In place
of additional (expensive) new medicines for hypertension, helping
older adults find social support through home care services or
alternative living arrangements could be developed. In summary,
taking a broad definition of health seriously and empirically
identifying specific constellations of health and comorbidities in
the US population provide a new way of assessing health and risk
in older adults living in their homes and thereby, may ultimately
inform health policy.
Methods
NSHAP Sampling and Field Methods. The NSHAP designed and collected a
probability sample of individuals ages 57–85 y old selected to represent US
households in 2005 and 2006 [response rate of 74%; n = 3,005 (53)], and these
individuals were reinterviewed (reinterview rate of 89%) together with their
spouses/partners [response rate of 84%; total n = 3,377 (54)]. The data are
sample-weighted values, so that they reflect estimates of the characteristics of
the US community-dwelling population at the time of interview (SI Methods).
The interviews were comprised of a personal interview; anthropometric,
clinical, and physiological measures; and a self-administered questionnaire
(27, 40, 45). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of
The University of Chicago and NORC of The University of Chicago; all re-
spondents provided written informed consent.
Classifying Health Measures. Each variable was coded either dichotomously or
into ordinal categories, in which higher values indicate worse health. We used
the 2005 clinical and literature-based cut points when available (Fig. S1
provides cut points). Respondents reported whether health professionals
had told them that they had a specific disease. For other measures, such as
happiness and how many hours the person usually sleeps, we identified
those at the low ends of the measures as poor health scores.
Latent Classes and Heat Maps of Their Composition. The latent class models
described earlier were estimated using Mplus, version 6 (55). SI Methods and
Table S1 provide model parameters and Bayesian Information Criterion values
for determining class number. LCA searches for an underlying statistical
structure to a population that is not directly observable but can be identified
using a sufficiently large collection of observable variables. The LCA then
identifies distinct subgroups, or classes, within the overall population based on
underlying commonalities among variables, commonalities that are assumed
to be caused by the underlying latent characteristic. Classes are estimated
through structural equation modeling. There are no a priori assumptions
about class identity that constrain the model, and it is possible to test the
hypothesis that there are significant co-occurrences of diseases and other
health states across the identified latent classes rather than random noise
(under the assumption that health measures are independent given class
membership). Each person can then be assigned to a single class based on his
or her value on each of the health measures (average class assignment
certainty = 0.83 for the MM and 0.89 for the CM).
We then characterized the constellation of presence of disease and health
states for each class by calculating the percentage of each class with a par-
ticular disease (e.g., diabetes) or a poor score for a measure (e.g., waking up
tired) (MM and CM of health in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). We illustrate the
constellation of disease and healthy states that characterizes each class
reading down the columns of Figs. 1, MM and 2, CM of health. Class per-
centages were statistically compared with the overall population percent-
ages using logistic regression (56) and then categorized as being higher, the
same, or lower (P < 0.05). Color codes indicate the prevalence of each
variable relative to the US population prevalence based on 2005 Wave 1
weighted data.
Our goal for the CM was consideration of all variables that could be useful
beyond the MM by adding 35 health measures chosen for their connections to
the broad functions of the nervous systems: mental health, cognition, sensory
function, health behaviors, neuroimmunity, and frailty. After we established
the six latent health classes, we then asked which of the 54 health measures
distinguished each health class from the remaining population by either the
presence or absence of disease or health states (i.e., their power to significantly
predict class membership; six logistic regression analyses) (Fig. S2). Each lo-
gistic regression analysis determined the independent contribution (OR) of
each of the 54 variables, controlling for the presence of the other health
measures. Future work will determine the most parsimonious set of mea-
sures for predicting class membership.
Mortality and Incapacity. Our measures were death and being “too sick to
interview” (incapacity). If a respondent was unable to participate in 2010, a
proxy was asked why and the date and cause of death or incapacity were
coded overseen by a geriatrician who routinely assigns cause of death (Fig.
S3). Such proxy reports are as accurate, if not more so, than the National
Death Index (57) and were available immediately (SI Methods) (58).
