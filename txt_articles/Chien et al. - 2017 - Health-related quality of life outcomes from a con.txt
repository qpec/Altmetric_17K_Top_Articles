Objective
To assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of
patients with prostate cancer up to 24 months after treatment
in a contemporary large diverse population.
Patients and Methods
Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from March
2011 to January 2014 in our healthcare system were included.
The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26)
questionnaire was administered before treatment, and at 1, 3,
6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment up to November
2014 for all methods of treatment. The Kruskall–Wallis test
was used to compare the distribution of each EPIC-26
domain score at each time point, and mixed models were
used to assess the overall scores over the period after
treatment.
Results
In all, 5 727 patients were included. There were data for
3 422, 2 329, 2 017, 1 922, 1 772, 1 260, and 837 patients
before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after
treatment, respectively. At 1 month, bowel scores were the
lowest for patients that had had radiation therapy, and
urinary irritative symptoms were the lowest for those who
had had brachytherapy. There were sexual function declines
for all the treatment methods, with surgery having the
steepest decline; open radical prostatectomy (ORP) had a
greater decline than robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy
(RALP). Patients who underwent RALP had a better return of
sexual function, approaching that of brachytherapy and
radiation therapy at 24 months. Urinary incontinence (UI)
also declined the most in surgical patients, with RALP
patients improving slightly more than ORP patients at
12–24 months.
Conclusions
Patients’ HRQoL after prostate cancer treatment varies by
treatment method. Notably, sexual function recovers most for
RALP patients. UI remains worse at 24 months after surgery,
compared to other methods of prostate cancer treatment.

Introduction
Prostate cancer remains the most common internal-organ
cancer in American men, with estimated incidence of 180 890
cases in 2016 [1]. With a 15-year survival rate of 95% when
all stages are considered [1], prostate cancer treatment
methods continue to evolve and advance in the modern era,
which has potential implications for their resultant side-
effects. One of these is the change in health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) [2]. Previous large prospective cohort studies
have shed light on men’s HRQoL changes after treatment as
to their ability to achieve the goal of ‘trifecta’ after prostate
cancer treatment: oncological cure, urinary and sexual
function preservation [3–9]. However, many of these studies
were not comprehensive; and many are now outdated in the
methods of treatment studied. As prostate cancer treatment
has undergone some paradigm changes in the last decade, we
therefore examined the long-term HRQoL results of patients
with prostate cancer in our large healthcare system.
Patients and Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
and conducted at an integrated healthcare system in Southern
California with >4 million members, representing nearly 15%
of the region’s diverse population [10].

 Before the onset of the study, the objectives and methods of
the study were presented to >100 urologists and ancillary
providers, and through e-mail campaigns to gain
stakeholders’ support. All patients with newly diagnosed
prostate cancer from March 2011 to August 2013 at all 14
medical centres within the healthcare system were included.
The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26)
questionnaire, in English or Spanish, was administered before
treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after
treatment, with data collection ending in November 2014. A
certified Spanish translator was used to create the Spanish
version. The baseline forms were administered to patients
who presented for prostate biopsy. Natural Language
Processing (NLP) was used to identify positive biopsies from
the pathology reports. Then, tracking the type of treatment
using Current Procedural Technology (CPT) and
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes weekly,
the patients were assigned to the arm of treatment identified,
and asked to complete surveys at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and
24 months after their treatment by mail or telephone from
our research department, as to avoid bias. The forms were in
Teleform
TM (Cardiff Software Inc., Vista, CA, USA) format,
thus were automatically scanned and populated into our
database. If the surveys were not returned within 1 month, a
rescue call was made (Appendix 1). NLP was used to trigger
data collection, and to populate our prostate cancer pathology
database, both with the biopsy and post-prostatectomy
results. The validation methods have previously been
described [11,12]. The treatment arms were: active
surveillance (AS), surgery (open radical prostatectomy [ORP],
robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy [RALP]), external
beam radiation (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), androgen-
deprivation therapy (ADT), and cryoablation (CA). AS was
defined as patients who were enrolled in the study in the
absence of any treatment for ≥6 months after diagnosis of
prostate cancer. The patients’ sociodemographics, including
age, race, language spoken, neighbourhood education and
income levels, marital status, body mass index, and Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI) were recorded from the survey and
electronic health record. Although many patients underwent
secondary or tertiary therapies during the study period, the
primary aim of the study was assessing their HRQoL.
Therefore, we included only patients who underwent and
stayed in their primary treatment. As such, patients who
underwent neoadjuvant ADT before EBRT or surgery were
excluded. Also, patients who failed primary treatment and
underwent a secondary treatment were excluded. During the
study period, the EBRT cohort included patients who
underwent intensity modulated radiotherapy or image-guided
radiation therapy in our healthcare system.
The Kruskall–Wallis test was used to compare the distribution
of each EPIC-26 domain score at each time point. Mixed
models for each domain score were created accounting for the
repeated surveys for each subject, and using a random
intercept to account for unmeasured differences, with AS as
the reference group. Separate mixed models were created
comparing RALP to ORP. All analyses were performed using
SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 (Cary, NC, USA).
Results
In all, 5 727 patients with prostate cancer with a treatment
start date were included our study. The number of patients
and clinicopathological characteristics in each primary
treatment cohort are shown in Table 1. The largest treatment
cohorts were AS (2 389 patients) and RALP (1 861).

HRQoL outcomes of prostate cancer patients
 Appendix 2 shows a flow chart of the number of patients
who remained in their primary treatment arm and who were
included in the HRQoL analysis, i.e., neoadjuvant ADT
patients and treatment failure patients were excluded. The
ADT group was the oldest and had the highest clinical
staging, PSA levels, and Gleason scores. The CCI was higher
in the ADT and radiation groups. There were 3 422, 2 329,
2 017, 1 922, 1 772, 1 260, and 837 patients who completed
surveys before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and
24 months after treatment, respectively. As some surveys
were incomplete, domain scores were only calculated when
surveys were adequately completed. The CA arm was
excluded from analysis due to negligible enrolment. For
baseline functional outcome scores, the ADT patients had the
lowest domain scores (P < 0.001) of all the groups (Table 2).
After treatment, the bowel scores initially declined in all
treatment arms. The EBRT arm had the greatest decline at
1 month, and then showed recovery beginning at 3 months,
although the scores remained below baseline up to 24 months
(Fig. 1). The RALP and ORP arms had smaller declines in
bowel function at 1 month and recovered to near baseline by
6 months. The ADT and BT patients had slower declines in
bowel scores, reaching a nadir at 3–6 months after treatment.
Over the entire 24-month follow-up, the EBRT and BT arms

Chien et al.
 had the largest average deficit compared to AS at 9.6 and 8.6
points, respectively (both P < 0.001, Table 3) in a mixed
model adjusting for age, stage, Gleason score, and PSA level.
Sexual function declined in all the treatment arms when
followed-up to 24 months. Surgery (ORP and RALP) patients
had the steepest decline initially, with ORP having a greater
decline compared with RALP. RALP notably had a better
return of sexual function, approaching that of BT and EBRT
at 24 months. Patients in the ADT arm reported a smaller
initial decline than surgery patients, although their scores
continued to decline and did not show any recovery through
to 24 months, resulting in the worst sexual function at
24 months after treatment. Patients in the BT and EBRT
arms had smaller initial declines and little recovery. In the
mixed model, adjusting for age, stage, Gleason score, and
PSA level, all treatment arms had statistically significantly
worse average sexual function scores over the 24-month
follow-up period when compared to AS (all P < 0.001), with
ORP patients averaging 37.4 points worse than AS, RALP
31.1 points worse, and ADT 18.2 points worse than AS
(Table 3). In the adjusted mixed model comparing the two
surgical arms, RALP patients had significantly higher sexual
function scores during follow-up, with a difference of 7.6
points (95% CI 3.5–11.8, P < 0.001; Table 4).
Urinary continence scores also declined the most for surgical
patients, with RALP patients improving slightly more than
ORP patients at 24 months after treatment. Nevertheless, the
urinary recovery at 24 months for both surgical approaches
was significantly worse than the other treatment arms. In the
adjusted mixed model, only ADT did not show significantly
reduced continence compared to AS.
Urinary irritation scores showed the largest decline and
slowest recovery in BT patients, while the EBRT, RALP and
ORP arms had smaller declines at 1 month after treatment
and recovery to near equivalence with the AS arm by
6 months after treatment. In the adjusted mixed model, the
BT arm had the greatest decline in urinary irritation scores
compared to AS (14.4 points, 95% CI 11.1–17.6, P < 0.001),
while the other arms all had smaller but still statistically
significant deficits compared to AS (Table 3).
The ADT arm had the largest decline in hormonal domain
scores, which continued to decline until 6 months after
treatment before levelling off. All other treatment arms had
small declines at 1 month after treatment and no further
decline. In the adjusted model, ADT (estimated difference
14.2, P < 0.001) and EBRT (estimated difference 5.2, P <
0.001) had significantly worse average hormonal scores
during follow-up when compared to AS, while the other
treatment arms were not significantly worse.
Discussion
This is the largest contemporary prospective study of HRQoL
in men with prostate cancer followed-up to 24 months after
treatment. It shows the unique trajectories of HRQoL

HRQoL outcomes of prostate cancer patients
 following each type of treatment. Similarly, in one of the
largest studies to date, Sanda et al. [5] reported on 1 201 men
with prostate cancer and followed their HRQoL using the
EPIC survey. Their cohorts included men who underwent
watchful waiting, ORP, BT, or EBRT. Since that time, the
practice pattern of prostate cancer treatment has changed
dramatically. AS has now been replaced with watchful waiting
for low risk, localised prostate cancer [13,14]. Another
paradigm change in contemporary prostate cancer treatment
is the rapid dissemination of RALP, which has replaced ORP
as the most common surgical approach in the USA [15]. As
such, various authors have reported contemporary series
comparing these two approaches [16,17]. However, most of
these studies have limitations including comparisons of
retrospective asynchronous cohorts, low numbers of enrolees,
and/or short follow-up.
Due to the ubiquity and slow progression of prostate cancer,
comprehensive multiple-arm, long-term follow-up studies are
rare. Some authors have achieved long longitudinal follow-up
of selected cohorts, such as patients who undergo EBRT
compared to BT [18], and surgery compared to surgery with
adjuvant radiation [19]. In two of the longest follow-up of
functional outcomes studies to date, comparisons were made
only between ORP and EBRT [20] and surgery vs EBRT and
BT [21].
To our knowledge, there has not been a contemporary,
comprehensive healthcare system-wide prospective follow-up
of all patients with prostate cancer and their HRQoL after
treatment. The design of a large scale study such as this may
be logistically difficult in a private-payer healthcare climate.
The difficulties lie in the collection of data from a
heterogeneous group of informational technology systems,
various research Institutional Review Boards, and
collaboration of the local principal investigators. We think
our present study setting was likely ideal for this particular
study, using one existing electronic medical record system of
>4 million members for tracking and data collection, and
using our existing clinical workflow of prostate cancer
ancillary providers to administer the surveys. Our population
is diverse and reflects the demographic character of Southern
California.
Much of the clinicopathological and demographic results were
expected: the ADT group was the oldest and had the highest
clinical staging, PSA levels, and Gleason scores. The CCI was
higher in the ADT and radiation groups. The distribution of
the prostate cancer treatments is reflective of the current
practice patterns in prostate cancer [22]. Notably, 31%
(1 785/5 718) of our enrolled patients during the study
period were under AS. During our study period, 25.3% (604/
2 389) of these patients ceased AS and underwent a
treatment. Similarly, 47.7% (395/828) of the ADT patients
ceased ADT and underwent a treatment. Although not
tracked, these patients probably underwent one dose of
neoadjuvant ADT before either surgery or radiation therapy.
For the functional outcome domains, we found much of our
present results consistent with previous findings: BT patients
have more urinary bother [23] and EBRT patients have more
initial bowel bother than all other treatment methods [24].
Not surprisingly, patients who underwent primary ADT have
the lowest scores on the hormonal domain.
Sexual function declined in all the treatment arms, but for
RALP patients the sexual function approached that of EBRT
and BT patients at 24 months (Fig. 2). Urinary incontinence
(UI) remained worse at 24 months after surgery, regardless of
the type of surgery, compared to the other treatment arms
(ORP, �36.98; RALP, �37.89; P < 0.001; Table 4).
There were other results worth noting. Sexual function
declined the most, as expected, in patients after surgery.
However, there was a lesser decline in the RALP patients,
even immediately postoperatively at 1 month. In our model
comparing sexual function scores between RALP vs ORP
patients, RARP sexual function was higher by 7.6 points
(P < 0.001). Sexual function recovery for RALP patients was
also better than for ORP patients. At 24 months, RALP
patient sexual function equated to that of BT and EBRT
patients. The sexual function of the ORP patients never
equated to that of the RALP patients postoperatively up to
24 months. Another notable finding is that in both surgery
cohorts, the RALP and ORP patients had the steepest
decline in urinary continence postoperatively. The recovery
for both cohorts was similar, but unfortunately never
approached that of other treatment arms at 24 months
postoperatively (Figs 3–5).
Sexual and urinary function recovery after RALP vs ORP has
been a subject of interest since the introduction of the robotic
platform. The initial presumption of improved sexual
function after RALP compared to ORP, possibly due to
improved optics and refined dissection, had mixed results
[25,26]. However, increasingly, mature data is confirming that
sexual function may be superior after RALP compared to
ORP [27], similar to our present findings.
There are limitations with our present study. In an intensive
longitudinal patient-dependent survey collection study, we
have inherently noncompliance with patients who did not
complete or were incomplete with the surveys. As for
previous studies, we reported the average of all surveys at
corresponding time intervals according to their treatment
method. We assume that due to the large numbers of the
cohorts, any notable variation or biases are minimised.
Another limitation involves AS, which has varied protocols in
the community. We acknowledge our inclusion criteria of
patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer without any
active treatment at 6 months and throughout the study

 period may not be inclusive of all AS protocols. However, in
terms of HRQoL analysis, our exclusion of any secondary
treatments should minimise contamination of data. Finally,
although the sexual domain scores for surgical cohorts were
adjusted for age and clinicopathology, we did not have
enough data to adjust for nerve-sparing status. We
acknowledge this limitation, and are currently collecting these
data for future sub-analysis.

HRQoL outcomes of prostate cancer patients
 Our present findings may allow for better understanding and
counselling of postoperative treatment after prostate cancer
diagnosis, particularly in the era of shared decision-making.
This is particularly important for prostate cancer, one of the
most complex and arguably high-profile urological cancers.
Although the HRQoL of patients with prostate cancer was one
of the major objectives of our present study, we also collected
data on pathology, disease comorbidity, and
sociodemographics. Most of these data are available for our
internal quality review and assessment. Patient-reported

 outcomes and its comprehensive data collection as such have
become paramount to establishing large disease registries and
are now increasingly required by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. The data not only provide important
information on prostate cancer, its treatment patterns and
resultant HRQoL, but also healthcare disparities and costs
[28,29]. The significance of this endeavour is utmost important
for outcomes measurement and research, as regional and
national comprehensive prostate cancer registries such as the
Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative and
the AUA Quality Registry have begun to show [30]. These
registries, similar to the one described in our present study,
underlie the importance of future of prostate cancer care, and
may serve as a model to other urological cancers.
Conclusions
Health-related quality of life after prostate cancer treatment
varies by treatment method. Notably, sexual function recovers
most for RALP patients. UI remains worse at 24 months after
surgery, compared to other treatment methods. These results
and the data collected from our prostate cancer registry
allows for better understanding and management of
population-based prostate cancer care.
