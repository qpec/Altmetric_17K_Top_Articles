Abstract
Background
High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is established as the major cause of inva-
sive cervical cancer (ICC). However, whether hrHPV status in the tumor is associated with
subsequent prognosis of ICC is controversial. We aim to evaluate the association between
tumor hrHPV status and ICC prognosis using national registers and comprehensive human
papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping.
Methods and findings
In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we identified all ICC diagnosed in Sweden
during the years 2002–2011 (4,254 confirmed cases), requested all archival formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded blocks, and performed HPV genotyping. Twenty out of 25 pathology bio-
banks agreed to the study, yielding a total of 2,845 confirmed cases with valid HPV results.
Cases were prospectively followed up from date of cancer diagnosis to 31 December 2015,
migration from Sweden, or death, whichever occurred first. The main exposure was tumor
hrHPV status classified as hrHPV-positive and hrHPV-negative. The primary outcome was
all-cause mortality by 31 December 2015. Five-year relative survival ratios (RSRs) were cal-
culated, and excess hazard ratios (EHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-
mated using Poisson regression, adjusting for education, time since cancer diagnosis, and
clinical factors including age at cancer diagnosis and International Federation of Gynecol-
ogy and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. Of the 2,845 included cases, hrHPV was detected in
2,293 (80.6%), and we observed 1,131 (39.8%) deaths during an average of 6.2 years fol-
low-up. The majority of ICC cases were diagnosed at age 30–59 years (57.5%) and classi-
fied as stage IB (40.7%). hrHPV positivity was significantly associated with screen-detected
tumors, young age, high education level, and early stage at diagnosis (p < 0.001). The 5-
year RSR compared to the general female population was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72–0.76) for

 hrHPV-positive cases and 0.54 (95% CI 0.50–0.59) for hrHPV-negative cases, yielding a
crude EHR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.38–0.52) and an adjusted EHR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.52–0.71).
Risk of all-cause mortality as measured by EHR was consistently and statistically signifi-
cantly lower for cases with hrHPV-positive tumors for each age group above 29 years and
each FIGO stage above IA. The difference in prognosis by hrHPV status was highly robust,
regardless of the clinical, histological, and educational characteristics of the cases. The
main limitation was that, except for education, we were not able to adjust for lifestyle factors
or other unmeasured confounders.
Conclusions
In this study, women with hrHPV-positive cervical tumors had a substantially better progno-
sis than women with hrHPV-negative tumors. hrHPV appears to be a biomarker for better
prognosis in cervical cancer independent of age, FIGO stage, and histological type, extend-
ing information from already established prognostic factors. The underlying biological mech-
anisms relating lack of detectable tumor hrHPV to considerably worse prognosis are not
known and should be further investigated.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Studies on tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) status and prognosis of invasive cervi-
cal cancer (ICC) have been continually published since the 1990s; however, there have
been substantial variations regarding sample size, HPV detection methods in laborato-
ries, and, to some extent, statistical methods.
• Very few studies have comprehensively tested a wide spectrum of both high-risk HPV
(hrHPV) and non-high-risk HPV types in cervical tumors when evaluating the associa-
tion between tumor HPV status and cervical cancer prognosis.
• Controversies remain on the association between tumor hrHPV status and ICC
prognosis.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We performed a nationwide population-based study of ICC cases diagnosed in Sweden
during the years 2002–2011 in which we comprehensively tested for 13 hrHPV types
and 24 HPV types not established as oncogenic.
• The association between hrHPV tumor status and ICC prognosis was assessed, and we
found that women with hrHPV-positive tumors had 39% lower excess mortality than
women with hrHPV-negative tumors, irrespective of other standard factors for ICC
prognosis including patient age, cancer stage, and tumor histological type.

Introduction
Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. The role of
high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) in the development of invasive cervical cancer
(ICC) is well established [1]. Persistent infection with hrHPV in the cervical epithelium, espe-
cially types HPV16 and HPV18, is known to be associated with higher probability of progres-
sion to cervical intraepithelial lesion grade 3 (CIN3) and ICC compared to being negative for
such infection [2]. However, once a cancer has occurred, the extent to which hrHPV status in
the actual invasive tumor tissue may be related to prognosis of ICC has been found to be vari-
able between studies [3–9]. This is despite the fact that for oropharyngeal cancer, another
tumor etiologically linked to hrHPV, there is consensus that presence of hrHPV in the tumor
marks better prognosis [10,11].
The disparities of existing findings on cervical cancer prognosis may be explained by varia-
tion in design or assay use or the limited size of the study population. The subject is of impor-
tance as a straightforward prognostic biomarker could be considered for clinical use. Large
and stringently designed studies are needed to answer the question of whether hrHPV status is
related to prognosis. To this end, we conducted a population-based cohort study considering
all ICC cases occurring in Sweden during the years 2002–2011, using comprehensive survival
and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping data and providing a large-scale population-
based evaluation of the association between tumor hrHPV status and ICC prognosis.
Methods
Study population
Records for a total of 4,533 women (Fig 1) diagnosed with cervical cancer or unspecified uter-
ine cancer in Sweden between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2011 were retrieved from the
Swedish Cancer Registry, which includes virtually complete information on all cancer cases
diagnosed in Sweden since 1958 [12]. A senior gynecologist (BA) reviewed the medical charts
of the 4,533 cases. The 279 cases not confirmed as primary invasive epithelial cancers of cervi-
cal origin were excluded, leaving 4,254 confirmed cases. From all confirmed cases, archived
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks obtained from the primary invasive epithe-
lial cervical tumor were requested from the archives of the diagnosing pathology laboratories.
Among the 25 pathology biobanks in Sweden, 4 biobanks declined to provide blocks for sec-
tioning and 1 biobank was excluded because of long delays in the approval process. In all,
2,932 blocks were collected. When there was more than 1 diagnostic block, the blocks were
evaluated for the proportion of tumor versus healthy tissue and only the block with the highest
proportion of tumor tissue was kept, resulting in exclusion of 23 duplicate blocks.

 All eligible blocks (n = 2,909) were then subjected to HPV genotyping. Blocks with invalid
results, including case-blocks showing β-globin-negative results (n = 4), and cases with corre-
sponding blank-blocks showing HPV-positive and/or β-globin-positive results (n = 11) were
excluded. All blocks from primary cervical cancer with HPV-negative results were re-reviewed
by our pathologist (W. Ryd) to confirm or reject ICC diagnosis. Blocks identified as not con-
taining any ICC tumor tissues (n = 44) were excluded. In the end, a total of 2,850 confirmed
cases with valid HPV genotyping results were eligible for our cohort.
Our main exposure was tumor hrHPV status. HrHPV-positive cases included cases that
were positive for only hrHPV or both hrHPV and low-risk HPV, while hrHPV-negative cases
included both cases without any detectable HPV and cases positive for only low-risk HPV.
Women were prospectively followed up from date of cancer diagnosis to 31 December 2015,
migration from Sweden, or death, whichever occurred first. Information on migration and
death was retrieved from the Total Population Register [13] using the individually unique
national personal identification number for all Swedish residents. Women with cancer diagno-
sis upon autopsy were excluded. A total of 2,845 women were thus eligible for our analyses. All
analyses were carried out blinded to study endpoint.
HPV genotyping and validation
All FFPE blocks were extracted and tested in parallel with β-globin real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and HPV genotyping using general primers (MGP)-PCR targeting the L1

 region [14], followed by typing with Luminex for 13 high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45,
51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68; 12 of these types are established as class I carcinogens and HPV68 is clas-
sified as a probable carcinogen) and 24 HPV types not established as oncogenic (i.e. low-risk)
(6, 11, 26, 30, 40, 42, 43, 53, 54, 61, 66, 67, 69, 70, 73, 74, 81, 82, 83, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91) [15,16]. A
blank-block containing only paraffin was sectioned and analyzed in between each case block
as a control for contamination. The blank-blocks had to be negative in all tests to confirm lack
of contamination, and the case-block had to be positive for β-globin to confirm the existence
of human tissue.
Real-time E7 and E6 PCR tests for HPV16 and HPV18 were further performed for all
tumors that were HPV-negative in the L1-directed PCR [17], as loss of the L1 region could
occur in tumors, whereas the oncogenic E7 and E6 regions are more likely to be retained [18].
Statistical analysis
We used Pearson’s chi-squared test to compare the distribution of age, International Federa-
tion of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histological type, mode of detection, educa-
tion, and hrHPV status for included cases. Age at cancer diagnosis was grouped as <30, 30–
44, 45–59, 60–74, and >74 years. FIGO stage was categorized as IA, IB, II, and III+ [19]. Mode
of detection was categorized as screen-detected or symptomatic cancer, based on our review of
medical charts. Information on education was retrieved from the Swedish Longitudinal Inte-
gration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA) [20] and classified
as low, middle, high, or missing based on the highest education level achieved by time of can-
cer diagnosis. Tumor grade was available for a subset of tumors; those in which cancer cells
obviously presented as low differentiation in histopathological assessment were classified as
high grade.
All-cause mortality was modeled as relative survival in relation to the general female popu-
lation in Sweden with comparable age and during the same calendar period, with time since
cancer diagnosis as time scale. We used the life table method [21] to estimate relative survival
ratios (RSRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cumulative time since diagnosis by
1-year increments, separately for hrHPV-positive and hrHPV-negative cases. We used Poisson
regression to estimate crude and adjusted excess hazard ratios (EHRs) with 95% CIs for 5-year
survival; this corresponds to an additive hazards model with a baseline hazard based on the
general population and an excess hazard component estimated from the cohort at hand ([21],
Section 5, Eq 1), with survival censored at 5 years. For all Poisson models, we assumed approx-
imately constant hazard across 1-year time bands and split the follow-up time accordingly. In
adjusted models, we included age at cancer diagnosis as a spline term with 5 degrees of free-
dom, time since cancer diagnosis corresponding to the 1-year time bands, FIGO stage, and
education. We did not adjust for treatment type since we found it overlapped substantially
with stage. In stratified analyses, we also calculated the 5-year RSRs, crude 5-year EHRs, and
adjusted 5-year EHRs with 95% CIs by age group and FIGO stage. In all stratified adjusted
models, age at cancer diagnosis was included as a spline term with 3 degrees of freedom. We
further selected squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC), the 2 main histo-
logical types of ICC, to examine the association of hrHPV status and prognosis by histological
type.
Sensitivity analysis
We compared the clinical and educational characteristics for confirmed ICC cases with and
without FFPE blocks retrieved, using Pearson’s chi-squared test. We calculated crude and
adjusted 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year EHRs by hrHPV status. We applied a stratified

 adjusted model by mode of detection and a subgroup analysis by utilizing information from
tumors classified as high grade (n = 221). Moreover, we reclassified hrHPV status taking also
HPV16-E7 and HPV18-E6 real-time PCR results into account. For that analysis of relative sur-
vival and excess mortality, tumors HPV negative in Luminex but HPV16-E7 and/or
HPV18-E6 real-time PCR positive (n = 89) were considered hrHPV positive and analyzed
together with hrHPV-positive cases. Finally, we linked 2,845 included cases to the Swedish
National Cervical Screening Registry (NKCx) for identifying those cases that had HPV testing
results prior to cancer diagnosis (n = 55).
Analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) and Stata 15.1 (StataCorp). p-Value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. We present the original analysis protocol and the
documentation of revision during the whole analysis process with reasons for changes in S1
Text. This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, which
determined that, due to the population-based nature of the study, informed consent from the
study participants was not required (Dnr 2011/1026-31/4; Dnr 02–556; Dnr 2012/1028/32;
Dnr 2011/921-32).
Results
Determinants of hrHPV status
hrHPV was detected in tumors of 2,293 cases. Compared to hrHPV-negative cases, hrHPV-
positive cases were more likely to be diagnosed at younger age, to be diagnosed at an earlier
FIGO stage, to be classified as having a screen-detected cancer, and to have a higher education
(all p < 0.001; Table 1).
hrHPV status and prognosis
Cumulative relative survival was considerably and constantly higher for hrHPV-positive cases
than hrHPV-negative cases throughout the study period (Fig 2). There were 822 deaths
(36.3%) observed among hrHPV-positive cases and 309 deaths (56.0%) among hrHPV-nega-
tive cases during the study period. The mean follow-up time was 6.5 years for hrHPV-positive
cases and 4.9 years for hrHPV-negative cases. Survival decreased sharply for both hrHPV-posi-
tive and hrHPV-negative cases within the first 3 years after cancer diagnosis, especially during
the first 2 years. In hrHPV-positive cases, the 5-year RSR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72–0.76) and in
hrHPV-negative cases, the RSR was 0.54 (95% CI 0.50–0.59). This yielded a crude EHR of 0.45
(95% CI 0.38–0.52) and an adjusted EHR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.52–0.71), indicating a statistically
significant 39% lower excess mortality among hrHPV-positive cases compared to hrHPV-neg-
ative cases after adjustment for age at cancer diagnosis, FIGO stage, education, and time since
cancer diagnosis (Table 2).
Stratified by age at cancer diagnosis, 5-year RSRs were consistently and statistically signifi-
cantly higher for hrHPV-positive cases than hrHPV-negative cases in all age groups from age
30 years up (S1 Table). The 5-year age-specific adjusted EHRs for hrHPV-positive cases ranged
from 0.55 to 0.66 (Fig 3) compared to hrHPV-negative cases. A similar pattern was seen for
cases in each FIGO stage above IA, with adjusted EHRs for hrHPV-positive cases ranging
from 0.59 to 0.62 (Fig 3; S2 Table).
hrHPV status, histological type, and prognosis
Our analysis of hrHPV status and histological type included the 2 main histological types of
ICC (2,109 cases of SCC and 526 cases of AC). hrHPV-negative AC was associated with the
worst 5-year relative survival (RSR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35–0.55), followed by hrHPV-negative SCC,

 hrHPV-positive SCC, and hrHPV-positive AC (Table 3). Using hrHPV-negative SCC as refer-
ence, hrHPV-positive SCC and hrHPV-positive AC were both related to significantly better
prognosis, showing adjusted EHRs of 0.68 (95% CI 0.56–0.82) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.43–0.87),
respectively.
Sensitivity analyses
Cases with and without FFPE blocks retrieved differed somewhat regarding distribution of
FIGO stage and histological type, with fewer stage IA and AC/other rare carcinomas obtained
than occurred in the overall material (S3 Table). The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year
adjusted EHRs by hrHPV status (S4 Table) showed 51%, 46%, 39%, and 36% lower excess
mortality for hrHPV-positive cases compared to hrHPV-negative cases, respectively. In the
stratified adjusted model, better prognosis remained for hrHPV-positive cases compared to
hrHPV-negative cases irrespective of mode of detection (S5 Table) or high tumor grade (S6

 Table). Cases that were only positive for HPV16-E7 or HPV18-E6 but not L1 were had a prog-
nosis similar to that of hrHPV-negative cases (EHR 1.15, 95% CI 0.78–1.69). When we reclassi-
fied the cases incorporating HPV16-E7/HPV18-E6 status, the association between hrHPV
status and prognosis remained unchanged (S7–S9 Tables).
There were 55 cases that had HPV testing results from liquid-based cytology tests prior to
ICC diagnosis (S10 Table); 53/55 (96.4%) pre-diagnostic HPV tests were hrHPV positive. The
2 hrHPV-negative tests before cancer were from (i) a stage II AC diagnosed in 2009 where the
HPV test in question was performed 2 years before cancer diagnosis and (ii) an ICC with
HPV73 detected by us in the tumor, which was not any of the hrHPV types tested for in
screening. Only 4/55 ICC cases that were HPV negative in the tumor had a pre-diagnostic
HPV test, out of which 3 had been hrHPV positive.

 Discussion
In this large, nationwide study including 2,845 HPV-genotyped cervical cancer cases occurring
over 10 years, we found that women with hrHPV-positive ICC had a statistically significant
39% lower excess mortality compared to women with hrHPV-negative tumors. The substantial
survival difference by hrHPV status observed already within 2–3 years after ICC diagnosis
illustrates this biomarker’s potential for distinguishing ICC associated with higher mortality.
The difference in prognosis was highly robust regardless of the clinical, histological, and edu-
cational characteristics of the cases.
Findings from previous studies on tumor hrHPV status and prognosis have not been con-
clusive [3–9]. Cuschieri et al. [4] found that HPV16- and HPV18-positive ICC cases had
improved survival compared to ICC infected by other HPV types. A large study [8] showed
that cases with both HPV alpha-7 (which includes HPV18) and alpha-9 (which includes HPV
16) species had better survival compared to cases with only alpha-7 species, and a worse prog-
nosis was also seen for HPV-negative cases. Meanwhile, other studies have reported better
prognosis for HPV16 [9] but worse for HPV18 [5]. In addition, findings on overall detectabil-
ity of HPV have either shown equal [3,6] or worse [4,7,8] prognosis in HPV-negative as com-
pared to HPV-positive cases. Findings on the impact of histological type on prognosis have
also been inconsistent [22,23]. Our findings suggest that the proportion of hrHPV-positive
and hrHPV-negative cases among the histological types might also explain the discrepancy in
prognostic value deriving from the latter variable. Therefore, considering hrHPV status, in
addition to evaluating histology and stage, should add substantial prognostic value in the clini-
cal management of ICC.
Although HPV is a necessary but not sufficient cause of ICC, a variable proportion of
tumors are reported to be negative for hrHPV [24,25]. We found that the hrHPV status of
tumors is strongly dependent on the mode of cancer detection (screening or symptomatic),
age at diagnosis, and stage at diagnosis, providing a likely explanation for this variability of the
proportion with hrHPV positivity seen in different case series. It is key to note that hrHPV
negativity in the tumor does not imply that hrHPV was not involved in the etiology of cancer
development, since hrHPV-negative cases may have been infected with hrHPV at an earlier
time point before cancer diagnosis. Rather, our findings imply that hrHPV DNA may become
undetectable at a late stage of the oncogenic process, as HPV negativity was associated with
tumors detected at a late FIGO stage and tumors not detected by screening. Indeed, a similar
association between HPV negativity and advanced cancer cases was shown in an earlier study
[26]. Also, using the same HPV detection method as in this study, we previously found that

 97% of CIN3 or worse cases in the Swedish population were hrHPV positive [27], and similar
very high proportions of hrHPV-positive CIN3 cases have been documented by others [28].
The registry linkage analyses of pre-diagnostic HPV tests found that 53/55 (96.4%) HPV
tests prior to cancer diagnosis had been hrHPV positive (S10 Table), which was in line with
the improved protection against cervical cancer of using primary HPV-based screening in pro-
spective randomized trials [29], implying that screen-detectable cervical cancer precursors are
in general hrHPV positive. HPV-based screening was not recommended in Sweden until
2015; thus, the opportunity to examine hrHPV status in screening prior to cancer diagnosis
was limited for this cohort of HPV-negative cases. The identification of 3 out of 4 hrHPV-posi-
tive pre-diagnostic specimens from women who later had an HPV-negative ICC also supports
that in some cases hrHPV may be involved in carcinogenesis, but may be lost in advanced
stages of the tumor. Our findings are fully compatible with hrHPV being the cause of cervical
cancer, yet equally suggest that loss of hrHPV DNA in the resulting tumor appears to be of
clinical importance and should not be ignored.
The inability to detect HPV in tumors might be explained by low viral load of HPV DNA in
the tumor tissues [24]; loss of the L1 region, which could occur in some fraction of the cancers
[18]; poor quality of samples; undetectable HPV types; or partial loss of HPV because of inte-
gration [30]. We therefore used only diagnostic blocks with stringent quality controls, used
sensitive laboratory methods capable of identifying 37 HPV genotypes, and in addition
included testing for oncogenic E6 and E7 regions of HPV16 and HPV18. It is thus unlikely
that we had any substantial proportion of hrHPV negativity deriving from methodological
problems. Had hrHPV negativity been caused by methodological problems in our study, mis-
classifying hrHPV-positive tumors as hrHPV negative, this would have diluted the associations
found, and therefore our study would not have been likely to detect such strong associations
with the biological behavior of the tumor. Conceivably, some ICC tumors might accumulate
genetic changes to the point that continued presence of the hrHPV is no longer necessary to
maintain malignancy. Another plausible explanation—which has been proposed to explain the
better prognosis of hrHPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer—is that hrHPV-positive cases
might be more immunogenic because of continued expression of viral proteins, making
tumors more susceptible to control by the immune system [10].
Limitations of our study include that we were not able to collect FFPE blocks for all cases,
but the introduction of confounding or selection bias due to this was limited, as it was related
to the policy applied by the respective biobank, and thus cannot have been differential on HPV
presence in tissue. Furthermore, our sample was shown to be representative of the original
case load, where the only difference of note was an over-representation of micro-invasive can-
cer (stage IA) in excluded cases, attributable to insufficient sample adequacy for re-sectioning
based on limited remaining malignant tissue in the archival block. It should be noted, though,
that statistical adjustment for FIGO stage or age might not be sufficient to explain prognostic
variations within stages or ages; therefore, residual confounding by stage or age might theoreti-
cally still exist in our estimates. However, as the magnitude of the association of these factors
with hrHPV status was strong and robust under both advanced adjustment and stratification
for these factors, we judge that there is little risk that residual confounding could have substan-
tially biased the associations we observed.
Finally, we acknowledge that, except for education, we did not have data on socioeconomic
status or lifestyle factors, such as smoking, which may affect ICC prognosis [31]. If unhealthy
lifestyle factors were more likely to be associated with hrHPV negativity in the tumor, and
adversely related to ICC prognosis, failing to adjust for these factors would result in an under-
estimation of the excess mortality for women who had a hrHPV-positive tumor. However, we
had complete data on education level, which is a good proxy indicator both for overall

 socioeconomic status [32] and to some extent for smoking status [33]. We thus included edu-
cation level in our final model to control for potential confounding from different lifestyle hab-
its, and, indeed, our results remained entirely robust. We therefore posit that extensive
residual confounding from such factors appears to be unlikely, and that the utility of hrHPV
status as a clinical biomarker for prognosis is easier to quantify in practice regardless.
To our knowledge, this is the first, and largest to date, nationwide population-based study
of hrHPV status and cervical cancer prognosis. We employed stringently validated methods
for ascertainment of hrHPV status and strict clinical and histopathological review for case
ascertainment. This study was further augmented with virtually complete and high-quality
register data, which enabled us to adjust for potential confounders and minimize loss to fol-
low-up in an unbiased manner. We used relative survival, measuring all-cause mortality in
relation to the general female population of the same age and during the same time period.
This approach is well suited to adjust for natural mortality in the population, and also elimi-
nates the risk of potential misclassification of causes of death. We also controlled for FIGO
stage, which is closely related to mode of cancer detection and alleviates lead time and length
time bias in survival studies [23]. Prognosis by hrHPV status remained strongly different also
after adjustment for FIGO stage and/or high grade. Importantly, we used established and
widely available laboratory methods, suggesting that testing for hrHPV status could be used
alongside age and stage at diagnosis in clinical prognostication.
Conclusions
Since methods of HPV analysis have been substantially improved in recent years, and have
also been implemented in cervical screening, hrHPV status in tumors may represent a rou-
tinely available biomarker for cervical cancer prognosis of potentially substantial value. We
observed that women with hrHPV-positive cervical tumors had a substantially better progno-
sis than women with hrHPV-negative tumors. We thus posit that hrHPV appears to be a bio-
marker for ICC prognosis, extending information from the already established prognostic
factors age, clinical stage, and histological type. The underlying biological mechanisms relating
lack of detectable tumor hrHPV to considerably worse prognosis are not known and should be
further investigated.
