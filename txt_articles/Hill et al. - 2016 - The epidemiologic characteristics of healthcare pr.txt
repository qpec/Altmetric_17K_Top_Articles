Abstract
Background: The rates of childhood allergic conditions are changing, prompting the need for continued
surveillance. Examination of healthcare provider-based diagnosis data is an important and lacking methodology
needed to complement existing studies that rely on participant reporting.
Methods: Utilizing our care network of 1,050,061 urban and sub-urban children, we defined two retrospective
cohorts: (1) a closed birth cohort of 29,662 children and (2) a cross-sectional cohort of 333,200 children. These
cohorts were utilized to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of the conditions studied. Logistic regression
was utilized to determine the extent to which food allergy was associated with respiratory allergy.
Results: In our birth cohort, the peak age at diagnosis of eczema, asthma, rhinitis, and food allergy was between 0
and 5 months (7.3 %), 12 and 17 months (8.7 %), 24 and 29 months (2.5 %), and 12 and 17 months (1.9 %), respectively.
In our cross-sectional cohort, eczema and rhinitis prevalence rates were 6.7 % and 19.9 %, respectively. Asthma
prevalence was 21.8 %, a rate higher than previously reported. Food allergy prevalence was 6.7 %, with the most
common allergenic foods being peanut (2.6 %), milk (2.2 %), egg (1.8 %), shellfish (1.5 %), and soy (0.7 %). Food allergy
was associated with development of asthma (OR 2.16, 95 % CI 1.94-2.40), and rhinitis (OR 2.72, 95 % CI 2.45-3.03).
Conclusions: Compared with previous reports, we measure lower rates of eczema and higher rates of asthma. The
distribution of the major allergenic foods diverged from prior figures, and food allergy was associated with the
development of respiratory allergy. The utilization of provider-based diagnosis data contributes an important and
lacking methodology that complements existing studies.

Background
Eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis (rhinitis) are among
the most common childhood medical conditions in the
United States [1]. The large disease burden of these con-
ditions represents a significant source of morbidity, mor-
tality, and healthcare expenditures [2, 3]. Additionally,
disease rates for these conditions are thought to be chan-
ging [4–6], prompting the need for continued surveillance.
While prior studies aimed at determining the epidemio-
logic characteristics of these conditions have provided im-
portant insights, the majority of large-scale studies have
relied on participant reporting as opposed to provider-
based diagnosis methodology [1, 6–9]. While studies that
utilize participant reporting are a valuable tool when
studying changing disease patterns across large popula-
tions, they have limitations including participant honesty,
introspective ability, and understanding of complex dis-
ease processes. Indeed, it has been shown that studies that

 utilize participant reporting or provider-based diagnosis
data provide different estimates of disease patterns [10, 11].
As such, provider-based diagnosis data is needed to com-
plement existing studies and to provide for the most accur-
ate estimates of disease rates.
Like eczema, asthma, and rhinitis, allergies to foods
are common in the United States and their prevalence
may be changing [4, 12]. Childhood food allergy is asso-
ciated with impaired quality of life, limited social inter-
actions, comorbid allergic conditions, and significant
economic cost [13–18]. Importantly, a severe allergic re-
action resulting in anaphylaxis can be life threatening,
and food allergens are the most common cause of ana-
phylaxis and anaphylaxis-related mortality in children
and adolescents [19]. Recent estimates have reported
food allergy prevalence figures between 4 and 8 %, how-
ever, these studies are limited in size and scope or rely
on participant reporting rather than healthcare provider-
based diagnosis [18, 20, 21]. Interestingly, prior studies
have suggested an association between food allergy and
the development of comorbid allergic conditions, though
these studies have been relatively small in size, examined
only a single comorbid condition, or relied on partici-
pant reporting methodology [16, 18]. An examination of
the epidemiologic landscape of food allergy, through the
utilization of healthcare provider-based diagnosis data, is
therefore needed.
We describe a retrospective analysis of a primary care
network of 1,050,061 children. We define two large pri-
mary care cohorts: (1) a closed birth cohort of 29,662 chil-
dren followed continuously in our primary care practices
from age < 30 days through their 5th birthday and (2) a
larger cross-sectional cohort of 333,200 children who
established primary care in our network before their 18th
birthday and had at least 12 months of follow-up in our
network. We examine healthcare provider-based diagnosis
data to determine the age at diagnosis, incidence, and
prevalence of eczema, asthma, rhinitis, and food allergy.
We further examine asthma-related medication prescrip-
tions to more accurately measure asthma prevalence rates.
Finally, we exploit the large number of patients in our co-
horts to determine the extent to which food allergy is as-
sociated with the development of asthma, and rhinitis.
This study complements existing studies, identifies differ-
ent disease rates than previously reported, and provides
important information that will shape future efforts
aimed at prevention, diagnosis, and management of
these common pediatric conditions.
Methods
Cohort design
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia care network is
both an international referral center and a provider of
primary and sub-specialty care services to patients
residing in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Our
primary care network, which encompasses more than 30
sites, has been validated as an accurate tool for estimating
disease rates across our broader community population
[22]. We extracted data from The Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia’s
electronic
medical
records
(EMRs)
of
1,050,061 children who obtained any primary, specialty, or
hospital-based care in our health system. An honest bro-
ker removed direct patient identifiers (e.g., medical record
number, name, etc.) to create a dataset with limited identi-
fiers (e.g., date of birth, dates of healthcare encounters,
diagnoses, etc.). Data analyses tasks were completed using
R version 3.1.2. (Wien, Austria). The data extraction in-
cluded data on healthcare provider-diagnosed conditions
for 379,134 children who received outpatient healthcare
before their 18th birthday at a primary care location be-
tween 1/1/2001 and 12/31/2013. To determine age at
diagnosis and incidence rates in the first 5 years of life, we
generated a closed birth cohort by identifying 29,662 chil-
dren who established healthcare in our primary care net-
work before age 30 days and were followed in our
network at least through 5 years of age (birth cohort). To
determine prevalence rates, we generated a cross-sectional
cohort by excluding 45,934 children who received care for
less than 12 months, leaving 333,200 children who re-
ceived one or more years of care in our primary care net-
work (cross-sectional cohort). Individual children with
each diagnosis were enumerated. The Institutional Review
Board of The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia reviewed
the retrospective cohort portion of our study and deter-
mined that it did not meet the definition of “human sub-
ject” research and was therefore exempt from requiring
ethics approval.
Definitions of conditions studied
Each cohort was examined for the presence of Inter-
national Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
diagnosis codes that fell into one of three diagnosis
groups: eczema, asthma, or allergic rhinitis (rhinitis)
(Additional file 1: Table S1). We identified children with
specific food allergies using the allergy module of our
EMR (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) (Additional file 2:
Table S2). For our principal analysis of eczema, asthma,
and rhinitis, we required patients to have diagnosis codes
representative of each condition during at least two separ-
ate care visits occurring at least six months apart. As a
sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of alter-
native definitions, we utilized a subset of our cross-
sectional cohort with at least 24 months of follow-up (n =
296,556) to identify those children whose eczema, asthma,
and rhinitis diagnoses were present in at least two separate
care visits occurring two or more years apart. To
minimize the likelihood of including non-allergic wheeze
in our analysis, we excluded diagnosis codes relating to
Hill et al. BMC Pediatrics  (2016) 16:133 
Page 2 of 8
 reactive airway and post-viral wheeze (Additional file 3:
Table S3), as well as any asthma diagnoses made before
the age of 1 year of life. Finally, to minimize the likelihood
of including lactose intolerance and gluten sensitivity (ce-
liac disease) in our analysis, we re-coded patients with
diagnosis codes corresponding to these conditions as non-
milk or non-wheat allergic, respectively.
Query validation via chart review
To determine the extent to which ICD-9 diagnosis codes
and food allergy data correctly represented the presence
of each of the conditions of interest, charts of 240 subjects
were manually reviewed and estimations of the accuracy
of the coded EMR data were made. To establish accuracy,
diagnoses were compared to practice parameters and con-
sensus guidelines from the Joint Task Force on Practice
Parameters (representing the AAAAI, ACAAI, and the
JCAAI) [23–26]. The chart review portion of our study
was approved by The Institutional Review Board of The
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and performed under
IRB protocol number 07-005420_AM13.
Analysis of asthma medication prescriptions
Data on asthma-related medication prescriptions was ex-
tracted from the medical records of patients who fell into
the asthma diagnosis group. After excluding asthma diag-
noses and medications in the first year of life, we com-
pared the rates of asthma based on definitions that
required either (a) the occurrence of at least two visits
with an asthma-related diagnosis code (ICD-9 codes
493.00 to 493.92) occurring at least six months apart; (b)
prescriptions for asthma medications on at least two sep-
arate dates; or (c) both a diagnosis code and prescriptions.
Analysis of food allergy as a risk factor for development
of respiratory allergy
Utilizing our birth cohort, we performed a risk analysis to
determine the extent to which food allergy in general, and
allergy to specific foods, predisposed to the development
of respiratory allergy (asthma or rhinitis). For the outcome
of asthma, we utilized our most restrictive definition (two
asthma diagnoses at least six months apart, and asthma-
related medication prescriptions on at least two separate
dates). Asthma and rhinitis were analyzed as independent
outcomes. For each outcome, we excluded children who
developed the outcome prior to the onset of food allergy.
Outcomes were assessed using logistic regression with ad-
justment for gender, race, and ethnicity. Adjusted odds ra-
tios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were reported.

Results
Cohort demographics
The demographic characteristics of patients in both co-
horts are shown in Table 1. Our patient population were
found to be approximately 48 % white, 40 % black, and
have a primarily non-Medicaid payer type. To determine
the accuracy of our coded EMR data, a manual chart re-
view was performed on a subset of charts. The percent
confirmed diagnosis for all conditions studied was 92 %
(Additional file 4: Table S4).
Age at diagnosis and overall incidence
The incidence of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis in each 6-
month age strata of our birth cohort are shown in Table 2.
The incidence of eczema during the first 5 years of life
was 15.3 %, with a peak age at diagnosis between 0 and
5 months of life (7.3 %). The incidence of asthma during
the first 5 years of life was 22.4 %, with a peak age at diag-
nosis between 12 and 17 months (8.7 %). The incidence of
rhinitis over the first 5 years of life was 17.2 %, with a peak
age at diagnosis between 24 and 29 months (2.5 %).
The incidence of food allergy in each 6-month age
strata is shown in Fig. 1. The incidence of at least one
food allergy during the first 5 years of life was 8.2 %,
with a peak age at diagnosis between 12 and 17 months

 of life (1.9 %). The incidence of peanut, milk, egg, and
soy allergies over the first 5 years of life ranged from 1.1
to 3.4 %, with a peak age at diagnosis between 12 and
17 months for peanut or egg allergy and between 6 and
11 months for milk or soy allergy. The incidence of
shellfish allergy was 1.2 %, with a peak age at diagnosis
between 24 and 29 months.
Prevalence
Prevalence of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis by age strata
in our cross-sectional cohort is shown in Table 3. The
prevalence of eczema across all ages in our cohort was
6.7 %, with the peak prevalence between 3 and 5 years of
life (7.7 %). The prevalence of asthma across all ages in
our cohort was 21.8 %, with the peak prevalence be-
tween 14 and 17 years of age (23.0 %). The prevalence of
rhinitis across all ages in our cohort was 19.9 %, with
the peak prevalence between 14 and 17 years (24.8 %).
As a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of
alternative disease definitions, we utilized a subset of our
cross-sectional cohort with at least 24 months of follow-
up (n = 296,556) to identify those children whose eczema,
asthma, and rhinitis diagnoses were present in at least two
separate care visits occurring two or more years apart.
The prevalence of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis did not
substantially change when we required diagnosis codes to
be present for at least two separate care visits occurring at
least two years apart (7.1, 20.7, and 18.2 %, respectively).
Prevalence of food allergies by category and age strata in
our cross-sectional cohort is shown in Fig. 2. The preva-
lence of at least one food allergy across all ages in our co-
hort was 6.7 %, with the peak prevalence between 0 and
3 years of life (5.7 %). Peanut allergy was most common
(2.6 %), followed by milk (2.2 %), egg (1.8 %), shellfish
(1.5 %), and soy (0.7 %). Milk, egg, and soy allergy were
most common between 0 and 3 years of age (2.6, 2.1, and
0.8 % respectively), while peanut allergy was most com-
mon between 3 and 5 years (2.1 %) and shellfish allergy
was most common between 14 and 17 years (1.6 %).
Examination of asthma-related medication prescriptions
Given that asthma rates were elevated in our population
compared with previous reports, we sought to more

 accurately determine asthma prevalence in our popula-
tion by correlating ICD-9 codes with asthma-related
medication prescriptions. Our most stringent asthma
condition inclusion criteria required the occurrence of at
least two encounters after the first birthday with an
asthma diagnosis code separated by at least six months,
and the presence of prescriptions for one or more
asthma medications on at least two separate dates. Based
on these criteria, we estimated an asthma prevalence
rate of 21.6 % in our birth cohort and 18.4 % in our
cross-sectional cohort (Additional file 5: Table S5). In a
manual review of charts of 20 children meeting our
ICD-9 code definition of asthma (two visits at least
6 months apart), 18 (90 %) were confirmed to have
asthma. Of the 18 children with confirmed asthma, 2
(11 %) outgrew their asthma symptoms during the time
they received treatment from our health system.
Food allergy as a risk factor for respiratory allergy
Prior studies have suggested that patients with food al-
lergy are at increased risk of developing asthma, how-
ever, these studies relied on participant reporting, were
relatively small, or were limited to a single outcome
[16, 18]. Utilizing our birth cohort, we sought to investi-
gate the extent to which healthcare provider-diagnosed
food allergy placed children at risk for developing respira-
tory allergy (asthma or rhinitis). The prevalence of asthma
in patients with food allergy is shown in Table 4. Of pa-
tients with an established diagnosis of food allergy, 35 %
went on to develop asthma (adjusted odds ratio: 2.16,
95 % CI: 1.94-2.4). Of the major food allergens, allergy to
peanut, milk, and egg significantly predisposed to develop-
ing asthma (OR 1.74, 1.38, and 1.60, respectively). Add-
itionally, patients with multiple food allergies were at
increased risk of developing asthma as compared to pa-
tients with a single food allergy (Table 4).
The prevalence of rhinitis in patients with food allergy
is shown in Table 5. Of patients with an established
diagnosis of food allergy, 35 % went on to develop rhin-
itis (adjusted odds ratio: 2.72, 95 % CI: 2.45-3.03). Of the
major food allergens, allergy to peanut, milk, and egg
significantly predisposed to developing rhinitis (OR 2.59,
1.46, and 1.80, respectively). Additionally, patients with
multiple food allergies were at increased risk of develop-
ing rhinitis as compared to patients with a single food
allergy (Table 5).
Discussion
We report the largest study to date to examine the epide-
miologic characteristics of healthcare provider-diagnosed
eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy in a
pediatric primary care population. Part of our analysis uti-
lized a closed birth cohort of 29,662 children to determine
the age at diagnosis and overall incidence rates for the
conditions studied. This cohort was also used to deter-
mine the extent to which food allergies influence a child’s
risk for developing respiratory allergy. We believe that,
with the adoption of EMRs by most major academic med-
ical centers, the utilization of healthcare provider-based
diagnosis data within virtual birth cohorts will become a
more common and powerful epidemiologic tool for the
study of pediatric disease patterns and associations.
We found that the prevalence of rhinitis in our popu-
lation was 19.9 %, a rate which is similar to previously
reported figures [1, 7, 10]. In contrast, we found the
prevalence of eczema in our population to be 6.7 %, a
rate lower than previous reports [1, 8]. To minimize the
likelihood of measurement error in our study we utilized
healthcare provider-based diagnoses, which complement
published data that utilize participant reporting method-
ologies, to ensure the most accurate estimation of dis-
ease burdens [10, 11]. We also restricted our analysis to
diagnosis codes that were present on at least two separ-
ate visits that were at least six months apart to reduce
the likelihood of including accidental or inaccurate diag-
nosis, and performed a chart review to confirm accuracy
for ICD9 codes included in our study. It is possible that
our eczema definition was less inclusive than previously
published studies, or that infants outgrew their eczema
within six months of diagnosis and were not counted.
While consistent with global data that suggest eczema
rates may be leveling off or decreasing in some regions

 [27], further investigation is necessary to determine
whether eczema rates are changing in our population.
The prevalence of asthma in our cohort was measured
to be 21.8 %, a rate higher than those reported previ-
ously, irrespective of study methodology (participant
reporting or provider-based diagnoses) [1, 3, 4, 6]. To
further define children with asthma, we correlated
asthma-specific ICD-9 codes with asthma medication
prescriptions in both our birth and cross-sectional co-
horts. Using this approach, we estimated the prevalence
rate of asthma in our population to be between 18.4 and
21.6 %. We utilized multiple methods to ensure that our
asthma measurements were not over-estimates such as
excluding all reactive airway disease diagnosis codes, ex-
cluding asthma diagnosis codes present before 1 year of
life, performing a sub-analysis in which we required two
asthma-specific diagnoses codes at least 2 years apart,
and correlating asthma diagnosis codes with asthma-
related medication prescription data. In a longitudinal
chart review of children with asthma identified via ICD9
codes, we found that a large proportion (89 %) of chil-
dren continued to display asthma symptoms, and/or
require asthma-related medications, suggesting that pro-
viders were not “miss-coding” asthma that had resolved.
Based on our findings, it may be that asthma rates in
some populations of the country are higher than previ-
ously appreciated. Consistent with this, the asthma
prevalence rates we measured are similar to those ob-
served in other industrialized nations such as Australia,
Singapore, and the United Kingdom [5, 9].
Current prevalence rates of food allergy are thought to
range from 4 to 8 % [18, 20, 21]. We observed the over-
all prevalence of allergy to any food to be 6.7 %, a rate
similar to those previously published [21]. However, the
rates of food allergies to peanut, milk, egg, shellfish, and
soy were proportionally higher in our patient population
compared with prior reports [21]. Additionally, allergy
to wheat is rarer than previously appreciated, while al-
lergy to sesame is likely more common than previously
appreciated and should be considered one of the com-
mon allergenic foods. We excluded lactose intolerance
and gluten sensitivity from our analysis, a difference in
methodology that may allow for more specific disease
identification as compared previously published studies.
Additionally, regional differences in the most common
food allergens could be due to genetic or environmental
factors. Additional studies are necessary to determine
whether the rates of food allergy observed in our study
are similar to those of other U.S. patient populations, or
represent shifting epidemiologic trends.
Prior studies have suggested that patients with food al-
lergy are at increased risk of developing comorbid aller-
gic conditions such as asthma [16, 18]. We found that
patients with existing food allergy were at increased
likelihood of developing asthma, and rhinitis. The asthma
and rhinitis rates observed in our food allergic population
are approximately double those we observed in the gen-
eral population, and our data represent stronger comorbid
associations than those previously described [16, 18]. We
also found that allergy to peanut, milk, and egg signifi-
cantly increased risk of developing respiratory allergy, and
that children with multiple food allergies were at increased
risk of developing respiratory allergy when compared with
children with a single food allergy. The strong association
between food allergy and the subsequent development of
asthma and/or rhinitis in our study may be due to the
large size of our study cohort, or the utilization of health-
care provider-based diagnosis codes. Based on these find-
ings, providers may choose to modify their counselling
and management of patients with food allergy. Finally, our
cohorts include data on other predisposing factors, out-
comes, as well as data on healthcare utilization which can
be examined in future studies.
Limitations
This study was a secondary analysis of health records at
a single institution collected as part of routine care. We
relied primarily on diagnosis codes to identify conditions
of interest, and choice of diagnosis codes result in poten-
tial biases in our data collection, and may be affected by
billing or administrative constraints. However, in a chart
review of a subset of our cohort in which we compared
diagnosis codes to commonly accepted practice parame-
ters and consensus guidelines, we found a high degree of
diagnosis code accuracy. Furthermore, in our analysis of
asthma-related medication prescription data we found
that asthma-related diagnosis codes highly correlated
with prescription practices. To ensure a suitable number
of subjects for analysis, and capture the most common
age at diagnosis for the conditions studied, the max-
imum age of inclusion in our birth cohort was set at
5 years. As such, a peak incidence occurring beyond
5 years could not have been detected by this study. Diag-
noses corresponding to both IgE and non-IgE-mediated
food allergies were included in our analyses and there-
fore, our food allergy data should not be interpreted as
representing purely IgE-mediated food allergy. Addition-
ally, it is not routine for patients to undergo food chal-
lenge or skin-prick testing to establish diagnosis of food
allergy or allergic rhinitis, respectively. As such, an over-
estimation of the prevalence of these conditions could
occur. We examine disease prevalence rates in our health-
care system between 1/1/2001 and 12/31/2013 with the
aim of establishing accurate prevalence data for the condi-
tions studied. Longitudinal analysis of prevalence rates
was not performed and as such we cannot draw conclu-
sions on changing prevalence rates over time, and varia-
tions in prevalence between our study and other studies

 could be influenced by methods of data collection. Finally,
our study cohort consists primarily of children residing in
urban and suburban settings. Consequently, results in
other communities, especially those that are rural, may
differ.
Conclusions
We utilized one of the largest pediatric primary care
cohorts ever assembled to describe the epidemiologic
characteristics of healthcare provider-diagnosed eczema,
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Our study pro-
vides an important addition to existing studies that
utilize participant reporting methodologies. In compari-
son with published rates, we measure lower rates of ec-
zema, and higher rates of asthma, in our population.
Additionally, rates of food allergies to peanut, milk, egg,
shellfish, and soy may be proportionally higher than previ-
ously reported. Finally, our findings indicate that the pres-
ence of food allergy is a risk factor for the subsequent
development of respiratory allergy. These findings allow
new insights into the epidemiologic characteristics of
these
diseases,
describe
the
importance
of
utilizing
provider-diagnosis
data
to
complement
participant
reporting methodologies, and provide important infor-
mation to shape future efforts aimed at prevention,
diagnosis, and management of these common pediatric
conditions.
