A Call to Action
The TENDR Consensus Statement is a call to action to reduce expo­
sures to toxic chemicals that can contribute to the prevalence of neuro­
developmental disabilities in America’s children. The TENDR authors 
agree that widespread exposures to toxic chemicals in our air, water, 
food, soil, and consumer products can increase the risks for cognitive, 
behavioral, or social impairment, as well as specific neurodevelop­
mental disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) (Di Renzo et al. 2015; Gore et al. 2015; Lanphear 
2015; Council on Environmental Health 2011). This preventable 
threat results from a failure of our industrial and consumer markets 
and regulatory systems to protect the developing brain from toxic 
chemicals. To lower children’s risks for developing neurodevelop­
mental disorders, policies and actions are urgently needed to eliminate 
or significantly reduce exposures to these chemicals. Further, if we are 
to protect children, we must overhaul how government agencies and 
business assess risks to human health from chemical exposures, how 
chemicals in commerce are regulated, and how scientific evidence 
informs decision making by government and the private sector.
Trends in Neurodevelopmental Disorders
We are witnessing an alarming increase in learning and behavioral 
problems in children. Parents report that 1 in 6 children in the United 
States, 17% more than a decade ago, have a developmental disability, 
including learning disabilities, ADHD, autism, and other develop­
mental delays (Boyle et al. 2011). As of 2012, 1 in 10 (> 5.9 million) 
children in the United States are estimated to have ADHD (Bloom 
et al. 2013). As of 2014, 1 in 68 children in the United States has an 
autism spectrum disorder (based on 2010 reporting data) (CDC 2014).
The economic costs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders 
are staggering. On average, it costs twice as much in the United States 
to educate a child who has a learning or developmental disability as it 
costs for a child who does not (Chambers et al. 2004). A recent study in 
the European Union found that costs associated with lost IQ points and 
intellectual disability arising from two categories of chemicals—polybro­
minated diphenyl ether flame retardants (PBDEs) and organophosphate 
(OP) pesticides—are estimated at 155.44 billion euros ($169.43 billion 
dollars) annually (Bellanger et al. 2015). A 2009 analysis in the United 
States found that for every $1 spent to reduce exposures to lead, a potent 
neurotoxicant, society would benefit by $17–$221 (Gould 2009).
Vulnerability of the Developing Brain to Chemicals
Many toxic chemicals can interfere with healthy brain development, 
some at extremely low levels of exposure (Adamkiewicz et al. 2011; 
Bellinger 2008; Committee on Improving Analysis Approaches Used 
by the U.S. EPA 2009; Zoeller et al. 2012). Research in the neuro­
sciences has identified “critical windows of vulnerability” during 
embryonic and fetal development, infancy, early childhood and adoles­
cence (Lanphear 2015; Lyall et al. 2014; Rice and Barone 2000). 
During these windows of development, toxic chemical exposures may 
cause lasting harm to the brain that interferes with a child’s ability to 
reach his or her full potential. 
The developing fetus is continuously exposed to a mixture of 
environmental chemicals (Mitro et al. 2015). A 2011 analysis of the 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) biomoni­
toring data found that 90% of pregnant women in the United States 
have detectable levels of 62 chemicals in their bodies, out of 163 
chemicals for which the women were screened (Woodruff et al. 2011). 
Among the chemicals found in the vast majority of pregnant women 
are PBDEs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS),  
phthalates, 
perfluori 
nated compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 
perchlorate, lead and mercury (Woodruff et al. 2011). Many of these 
chemicals can cross the placenta during pregnancy and are routinely 
detected in cord blood or other fetal tissues (ATSDR 2011; Brent 
2010; Chen et al. 2013; Lien et al. 2011).
Prime Examples of Neurodevelopmentally Toxic 
Chemicals
The following list provides prime examples of toxic chemicals that can 
contribute to learning, behavioral, or intellectual impairment, as well 
as specific neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD or autism 
spectrum disorder:
• 
Organophosphate (OP) pesticides (Eskenazi et al. 2007; 
Fortenberry et al. 2014; Furlong et al. 2014; Marks et al. 
2010; Rauh et al. 2006; Shelton et al. 2014).
• 
PBDE flame retardants (Chen et al. 2014; Cowell et al. 2015; 
Eskenazi et al. 2013; Herbstman et al. 2010).
• 
Combustion­related air pollutants, which generally include 
PAHs, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, and other air 
pollutants for which nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter are 
markers (Becerra et al. 2013; Clifford et al. 2016; Jedrychowski

Project TENDR: Targeting Environmental 
Neuro-Developmental Risks. The TENDR 
Consensus Statement
http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP358
Summary: Children in America today are at an unacceptably high risk 
of developing neurodevelopmental disorders that affect the brain and 
nervous system including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
intellectual disabilities, and other learning and behavioral disabilities. 
These are complex disorders with multiple causes—genetic, social, and 
environmental. The contribution of toxic chemicals to these disorders can 
be prevented. approach: Leading scientific and medical experts, along 
with children’s health advocates, came together in 2015 under the auspices 
of Project TENDR: Targeting Environmental Neuro-Developmental 
Risks to issue a call to action to reduce widespread exposures to chemicals 
that interfere with fetal and children’s brain development. Based on the 
available scientific evidence, the TENDR authors have identified prime 
examples of toxic chemicals and pollutants that increase children’s risks 
for neurodevelopmental disorders. These include chemicals that are used 
extensively in consumer products and that have become widespread in the 
environment. Some are chemicals to which children and pregnant women 
are regularly exposed, and they are detected in the bodies of virtually all 
Americans in national surveys conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. The vast majority of chemicals in industrial and 
consumer products undergo almost no testing for developmental neuro-
toxicity or other health effects. concluSion: Based on these findings, we 
assert that the current system in the United States for evaluating scientific 
evidence and making health-based decisions about environmental chemi-
cals is fundamentally broken. To help reduce the unacceptably high preva-
lence of neurodevelopmental disorders in our children, we must eliminate 
or significantly reduce exposures to chemicals that contribute to these 
conditions. We must adopt a new framework for assessing chemicals that 
have the potential to disrupt brain development and prevent the use of 
those that may pose a risk. This consensus statement lays the foundation 
for developing recommendations to monitor, assess, and reduce exposures 
to neurotoxic chemicals. These measures are urgently needed if we are to 
protect healthy brain development so that current and future generations 
can reach their fullest potential.

2015; Volk et al. 2013).
• 
Lead (Eubig et al. 2010; Lanphear et al. 2005; Needleman 
et al. 1979).
• 
Mercury (Grandjean et al. 1997; Karagas et al. 2012; Sagiv 
et al. 2012).
• 
PCBs (Eubig et al. 2010; Jacobson and Jacobson 1996; 
Schantz et al. 2003).
The United States has restricted some of the production, use and 
environmental releases of these particular chemicals, but those measures 
have tended to be too little and too late. We face a crisis from both 
legacy and ongoing exposures to toxic chemicals. For lead, OP pesticides, 
PBDEs and air pollution, communities of color and socioeconomically 
stressed communities face disproportionately high exposures and health 
impacts (Adamkiewicz et al. 2011; Engel et al. 2015; Zota et al. 2010).
Policies to ban lead from gasoline, paints and other products have 
been successful in lowering blood lead levels in the American popula­
tion (Jones et al. 2009), yet lead exposure continues to be a preventable 
cause of intellectual impairment, ADHD and maladaptive behaviors for 
millions of children (CDC 2015). Scientists agree that there is no safe 
level of lead exposure for fetal or early childhood development (Lanphear 
et al. 2005; Schnur and John 2014), and studies have documented the 
potential for cumulative and synergistic health effects from combined 
exposure to lead and social stressors (Bellinger et al. 1988; Cory­Slechta 
et al. 2004). Thus, taking further preventive actions is imperative. 
Epidemiological, toxicological, and mechanistic studies have 
together provided evidence that clearly demonstrates or strongly 
suggests neurodevelopmental toxicity for lead, mercury, OP pesticides, 
air pollution, PBDEs, and PCBs. The level and type of available 
evidence linking exposures to toxic chemicals with neurodevelop­
mental disorders, including the examples in this statement, vary both 
within and among chemical classes. In light of this extensive evidence 
and continued widespread exposure, the risks for learning and devel­
opmental disorders can likely be lowered through targeted exposure 
reduction, starting with these example chemicals. 
Majority of Chemicals Untested for 
Neurodevelopmental Effects
The examples of developmental neurotoxic chemicals that we list 
here likely represent the tip of the iceberg. Of the tens of thousands 
of chemicals on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
chemical inventory, nearly 7,700 are manufactured or imported into 
the United States at ≥ 25,000 pounds per year (U.S. EPA 2012). The 
U.S. EPA has identified nearly 3,000 chemicals that are produced or 
imported at > 1 million pounds per year (U.S. EPA 2006). 
Only a minority of chemicals has been evaluated for neurotoxic 
effects in adults. Even fewer have been evaluated for potential effects 
on brain development in children (Grandjean and Landrigan 2006, 
2014). Further, toxicological studies and regulatory evaluation seldom 
address combined effects of chemical mixtures, despite evidence that 
all people are exposed to dozens of chemicals at any given time. 
Need for a New Approach to Evaluating Evidence
Our failures to protect children from harm underscore the urgent need for 
a better approach to developing and assessing scientific evidence and using 
it to make decisions. We as a society should be able to take protective 
action when scientific evidence indicates a chemical is of concern, and not 
wait for unequivocal proof that a chemical is causing harm to our children.
Evidence of neurodevelopmental toxicity of any type—epidemio­
logical or toxicological or mechanistic—by itself should constitute a 
signal sufficient to trigger prioritization and some level of action. Such 
an approach would enable policy makers and regulators to  
proactively 
test and identify chemicals that are emerging concerns for brain 
 
development and prevent widespread human exposures. 
Some chemicals, like those that disrupt the endocrine system, 
present a concern because they interfere with the activity of 
 
endogenous hormones that are essential for healthy brain develop­
ment. Endocrine­disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include many pesti­
cides, flame retardants, fuels, and plasticizers. One class of EDCs 
that is ubiquitous in consumer products are the phthalates. These 
are an emerging concern for interference with brain development 
and therefore demand attention (Boas et al. 2012; Ejaredar et al. 
2015; Mathieu­Denoncourt et al. 2015; Miodovnik et al. 2014; U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 2014).
Regrettable Substitution
Under our current system, when a toxic chemical or category of 
chemicals is finally removed from the market, chemical manufacturers 
often substitute similar chemicals that may pose similar concerns or be 
virtually untested for toxicity. This practice can result in “regrettable 
substitution” whereby the cycle of exposures and adverse effects starts 
all over again. The following list provides examples of this cycle:
• 
When the federal government banned some uses of OP 
pesticides, manufacturers responded by expanding the use of 
neonicotinoid and pyrethroid pesticides. Evidence is emerging 
that these widely used classes of pesticides pose a threat to the 
developing brain (Kara et al. 2015; Richardson et al. 2015; 
Shelton et al. 2014).
• 
When the U.S. Government reached a voluntary agreement 
with flame retardant manufacturers to stop making PBDEs, the 
manufacturers substituted other halogenated and organophos­
phate flame retardant chemicals. Many of these replacement 
flame retardants are similar in structure to other neurotoxic 
chemicals but have not undergone adequate  
assessment of their 
effects on developing brains. 
• 
When the federal government banned some phthalates in chil­
dren’s products, the chemical industry responded by replacing 
the banned chemicals with structurally similar new phthalates. 
These replacements are now under investigation for disrupting 
the endocrine system.
Looking Forward
Our system for evaluating scientific evidence and making decisions 
about environmental chemicals is broken. We cannot continue to 
gamble with our children’s health. We call for action now to prevent 
exposures to chemicals and pollutants that can contribute to the 
prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities in America’s children.
We need to overhaul our approach to developing and assessing 
evidence on chemicals of concern for brain development. Toward this 
end, we call on regulators to follow scientific guidance for assessing 
how chemicals affect brain development, such as taking into account 
the special vulnerabilities of the developing fetus and children, cumu­
lative effects resulting from combined exposures to multiple toxic 
chemicals and stressors, and the lack of a safety threshold for many of 
these chemicals (Committee on Improving Analysis Approaches Used 
by the U.S. EPA 2009). We call on businesses to eliminate neuro­
developmental toxicants from their supply chains and products, and 
on health professionals to integrate knowledge about environmental 
toxicants into patient care and public health practice.
Finally, we call on policy makers to take seriously the need to 
reduce exposures of all children to lead—by accelerating the clean 
up from our past uses of lead such as in paint and water pipes, by 
halting the current uses of lead, and by better regulating the industrial 
processes that cause new lead contamination.
We are confident that reducing exposures to chemicals that can 
interfere with healthy brain development will help to lower the preva­
lence of neurodevelopmental disabilities, and thus enable many more 
children to reach their full potential.
