Displaying Red and Black on a First Date:
A Field Study Using the “First Dates”
Television Series
Robin S. S. Kramer1,2 and Jerrica Mulgrew2
Abstract
Previous research has shown that displaying the color red can increase attractiveness. As a result, women display red more often
when expecting to meet more attractive men in a laboratory context. Here, we carried out a field study by analyzing 546 daters
from the “First Dates” television series. Each participant was filmed in a pre-date interview and during a real first date, allowing
direct comparison of the clothing worn by each person in these two contexts. Analysis of ratings of the amount of red displayed
showed that both men and women wore more red clothing during their dates. This pattern was even stronger for black clothing,
while the amount of blue clothing did not differ across the two contexts. Our results provide the first real-world demonstration
that people display more red and black clothing when meeting a possible mate for the first time, perhaps seeking to increase their
attractiveness and/or reveal their intentions to potential partners.

In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the role that
color plays in affect, cognition, and behavior. Color-in-context
theory (Elliot & Maier, 2012; for a review, see Elliot & Maier,
2014) provides a framework for this research, suggesting that
color–behavior associations are context-dependent. For exam-
ple, red may activate approach motivations in the context of
Valentine’s Day lingerie or the red-light district but may warn
perceivers to avoid in the case of sirens and stop signals. Within
mating contexts, red is associated with sexual fertility (and
hence desirability) in nonhuman primates (Caro, 2005; Nunn,
1999), and a growing body of research suggests that people
may also show evidence of this red–attractiveness association
(also referred to as the “red–sex” link; Elliot & Niesta, 2008).
In this study, we consider the use of red clothing in a real-world
dating context as an opportunity to increase attractiveness.
Researchers typically find that images of women either
wearing red or placed on a red background are perceived as
more attractive, more sexually receptive, and as having higher
sexual intent (Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Elliot, Tracy, Pazda, &
Beall, 2013; Gu´
eguen, 2012; Gu´
eguen & Jacob, 2013; Niesta
Kayser, Elliot, & Feltman, 2010; Pazda, Elliot, & Greitemeyer,
2012, 2014; Pazda, Prokop, & Elliot, 2014; Roberts, Owen, &
Havlicek, 2010; Young, 2015), although this effect is not
always present (Lehmann & Calin-Jageman, 2017; Peper-
koorn, Roberts, & Pollet, 2016). There is also more limited
evidence demonstrating this relationship for images of men
(Elliot et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2010), again accompanied
by failures to support this result (Hesslinger, Goldbach, &
Carbon, 2015; Lehmann & Calin-Jageman, 2017).
Evidence also suggests that, at least in women, red clothing
is chosen to communicate sexual intent and interest to others
(Elliot, Greitemeyer, & Pazda, 2013; Elliot & Pazda, 2012).
This may explain why women choose to wear red or pink
clothing more often at peak fertility (Beall & Tracy, 2013;
Eisenbruch, Simmons, & Roney, 2015; Tracy & Beall,
2014), the point in their cycles at which they should be

 especially motivated to increase their attractiveness in order to
obtain high-quality mates. In line with this idea, researchers
have shown that wearers indeed perceive themselves to be
more attractive when in red (Berthold, Reese, & Martin, 2017).
In the current study, we consider the choice to wear red in a
real-world dating context. If both men and women are seen by
others as more attractive (Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Elliot et al.,
2010) and they rate themselves as more attractive (Berthold
et al., 2017) when in red clothing, then it follows that red
clothing should be more prevalent in situations in which wear-
ers are highly motivated to increase their attractiveness. In line
with this idea, studies focusing on imagined situations have
shown that women were more likely to choose to wear red
(vs. another color) when expecting to interact with attractive
men (Elliot, Greitemeyer, et al., 2013) or during scenarios in
which the probability of meeting a potential mate was high (vs.
low; Prokop & Hromada, 2013).
To our knowledge, only one study has investigated whether
people really do wear red more often (rather than simply select-
ing this color in their experimental responses) in a naturalistic
situation where increasing one’s attractiveness is desirable.
Niesta Kayser, Agthe, and Maner (2016) manipulated whether
female participants were expecting to meet an attractive versus
unattractive male research assistant upon arrival at the labora-
tory by e-mailing them one of two photographs in advance. The
researchers found that the women expecting to interact with the
attractive man were significantly more likely to display red (in
their clothes, accessories, and/or makeup) than those who
expected to interact with the unattractive man. In addition, both
the quantity and the perceived conspicuousness of the red dis-
plays were greater in the “attractive man” group. Finally, in
comparison with a baseline sample of women observed on
campus, female participants expecting to interact with the
attractive (unattractive) man displayed red significantly more
(less) often. Importantly, participants were arriving for an
experiment, and so these results do not inform regarding a
dating context. In addition, only red clothing displays were
considered, and so it may be that participants displayed more
color in general when expecting to meet an attractive
experimenter.
Previous research suggests that black clothes are also seen
as attractive. Indeed, red and black clothing were perceived to
be equally attractive on both men and women (Roberts et al.,
2010). However, evidence suggests that these colors may
increase attractiveness through different pathways. While red
increases the perceived sexual receptivity of its wearers, it
appears that black increases their perceived fashionableness
(Pazda, Elliot, et al., 2014). Importantly, the red–sex link
described above makes no predictions with regard to black
clothing, and so as an ancillary consideration, we also explore
the use of this color in the present work. As previously men-
tioned, this allows us to address whether more color in general
is displayed on a date or specifically red is worn by daters.
Here, we investigated a real-world situation in which people
were motivated to look their most attractive—a first date with a
stranger. In this context, daters were free to select clothing from
their own wardrobes, and we expected that both men and
women would seek to increase their attractiveness because
people volunteering to go on a blind date want the other person
to find them attractive. Of course, upon meeting their dates and
throughout their dinner together, people’s motivations may
change, but the most logical approach is to “dress to impress”
in all cases to allow for those situations in which the other
person is judged to be a desirable mate. In order to address the
specificity of the red–sex link, we considered the use of color
displays for both red and black clothing, while also including
blue as a control color, for which we have no a priori reason to
predict a change across contexts.
Method
Materials
Data were collected from the British reality television show
“First Dates” (2013 to present). The show is filmed at a restau-
rant in Central London and all participants are on “blind dates”
(i.e., first dates with people they have not previously met).
Participants are single and hoping to begin some form of dating
(as the show does not discriminate based on whether daters are
seeking short- or long-term relationships, etc.). Couples are
aware that they are being recorded by video cameras that are
mounted around the restaurant. We also confirmed with Multi-
tude Media (the public relations company behind the series)
that daters were free to wear their own choice of clothing for all
appearances on the show (W. Wood, personal communication,
September 6, 2017).
The details of the television show changed after the second
series. For the first two series only, each participant was shown
a photograph of their date prior to filming the show. Previous
research suggests that participants may choose whether to dis-
play red or not based on their impressions of their date’s
appearance (Niesta Kayser, Agthe, & Maner, 2016). Given that
we could not know whether participants found their upcoming
dating partner to be attractive or not, and hence whether they
would dress with the goal of attracting that person, we chose to
exclude participants in these first two series. In Series 3
onward, no photographs were shown beforehand and partici-
pants had no prior knowledge of their upcoming dating partner.
All regular episodes were analyzed from Series 3 to 8, with
each one depicting several simultaneous dates. “Special” epi-
sodes (themed around Christmas or Valentine’s Day, or featur-
ing celebrities) were excluded since these may result in
additional influences upon people’s clothing choices. This pro-
vided an initial sample of 617 participants. In order to avoid
potential issues with repeated appearances (occasionally,
someone whose date was romantically unsuccessful would
reappear in a subsequent show, perhaps feeling the need to
wear new clothing, etc.), any appearance after the participant’s
first was excluded (28 observations).
Participants also appeared (alone) in a pre-date interview,
which took place prior to the filming of their actual date.
Unfortunately, not all pre-date interviews were televised,

 which resulted in the exclusion of 33 additional participants.
We also noticed that 10 participants wore identical clothing for
both their pre-date interview and actual date. We learned
through correspondence with Multitude Media that these par-
ticipants were reinterviewed on the day of their dates, which
meant that they had no opportunity to change their clothes
between contexts (W. Wood, personal communication, Febru-
ary 5, 2018). We therefore excluded these participants also.
This resulted in a final sample of 546 participants (279 women;
age: M ¼ 33.76 years, SD ¼ 13.96 years; age missing for six
participants), with sex, age, and sexuality information (i.e.,
whether they were on a same- or opposite-sex date) also
recorded.
Analysis
Preliminary analysis was carried out using author-coded cate-
gorical judgments of the presence/absence of red (see the
Online Supplementary Material). Here, we present our main
analysis using an unbiased and quantitative approach, which
addresses several of the limitations identified in our initial
analysis.
In the interest of full disclosure, no further analysis strate-
gies were used but not reported, no other conditions or vari-
ables were coded, and no other data sets were analyzed for a
similar research question.
Raters
We recruited four independent raters (three women; age range:
18–31) who were blind to the study’s hypothesis. All raters
provided written informed consent and were given both verbal
and written debriefings at the end of the study. The University
of Lincoln’s School of Psychology ethics committee approved
this study (PSY171818), which was carried out in accordance
with the provisions of the World Medical Association Declara-
tion of Helsinki.
Procedure
Each rater spent 1.5 hr coding images (both the pre-date inter-
view and the date itself for each participant), requiring four
raters in total to complete the 546-participant data set. For each
participant and context, raters coded the amount of red dis-
played by the person: 0 ¼ none, 1 ¼ a small amount, 2 ¼ a
medium amount, 3 ¼ a large amount/the majority, and 4 ¼ all
their clothing. Only clothing and accessories were included
(with definitions given). We accepted a range of reddish hues
(pink, red, and scarlet), while excluding atypical shades of red
such as orange, maroon, or purple (Niesta Kayser et al., 2016).
Raters also coded the amount of blue clothing and black cloth-
ing displayed using the above scale. Blue is another primary
color commonly featured on clothing, while black is seen as an
attractive color and therefore represents a useful comparison
with red (Roberts et al., 2010). For blue, we accepted a range of
bluish hues (blue, light blue, navy, and dark blue) but excluded
atypical shades such as teal, cyan, and purple. For black, we
accepted only black, while excluding shades of gray.
Pre-date interview images depicted participants front-on
(talking directly into the camera) and always featured the same
interview room background, while images showing the date
itself were taken within the restaurant using cameras placed
at a variety of angles. As such, we were unable to remove cues
to the images’ context when collecting coders’ ratings. Impor-
tantly, coders were unaware of the study’s hypothesis regarding
clothing colors in these two contexts.
Results
Although raters coded different subsets of participant images
simply due to the large number collected, we also asked all four
raters to code the first 10 participants. This allowed us to
quantify the agreement between raters. For these 60 ratings
(10 participants � 2 contexts � 3 colors), we found a Cron-
bach’s a of .96 and an average correlation between raters of
.87, which we considered to be acceptable levels of agreement.
We analyzed the full set of ratings using a 2 (Dating Con-
text: interview, date) � 3 (Clothing Color: red, blue, black) � 2
(Sex: male, female) mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA),
where Sex varied between participants and the remaining fac-
tors varied within participants. We found significant main
effects of Dating Context, F(1, 544) ¼ 59.62, p < .001, Z2
p ¼
.099, and Clothing Color, F(2, 1088) ¼ 237.89, p < .001, Z2
p ¼
.304, but not of Sex, F(1, 544) ¼ 0.10, p ¼ .756, Z2
p < .001.
However, these were qualified by several significant two-way
interactions.
We found a significant Sex � Dating Context interaction,
F(1, 544) ¼ 7.76, p ¼ .006, Z2
p ¼ .014. We therefore considered
the simple main effects of Dating Context at each level of Sex.
These simple main effects were significant for both women,
F(1, 544) ¼ 56.43, p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .094, and men, F(1, 544) ¼
11.92, p ¼ .001, Z2
p ¼ .021. As such, both women and men
displayed more red/blue/black clothing (this effect does not
differentiate between the three colors) on a date in comparison
with a pre-date interview, and the size of this effect was larger
for women.
We also found a significant Sex � Clothing Color interac-
tion, F(2, 1088) ¼ 33.10, p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .057. Again, we
considered the simple main effects of Clothing Color at each
level of Sex. These simple main effects were significant for
both women, F(2, 1088) ¼ 165.02, p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .233, and
men, F(2, 1088) ¼ 107.24, p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .165. Pairwise
comparisons (Dunn–S
ˇida
´k corrected) showed that, for both
women and men, more black clothing was displayed than both
blue and red clothing (all ps < .006). For men, more blue
clothing was displayed than red clothing (p < .001) but this
difference was not significant for women (p ¼ .092).
Finally, and of most relevance for the current study, we
found a significant Dating Context � Clothing Color interac-
tion, F(2, 1088) ¼ 12.00, p < .001, Z2
p ¼ .022 (see Figure 1).
We therefore considered the simple main effects of Dating
Context at each level of Clothing Color. Cohen’s d was

 calculated using the pooled estimate of the standard deviation
as the standardizer, more easily allowing for comparisons with
other studies irrespective of their designs. For red, the simple
main effect was significant, F(1, 545) ¼ 11.40, p ¼ .001, Z2
p ¼
.020; Mdiff ¼ .15, 95% confidence interval (CI) [.06, .23]; d ¼
.19, 95% CI [.07, .31]. We also found a significant simple main
effect for black clothing, F(1, 545) ¼ 38.55, p < .001, Z2
p ¼
.066; Mdiff ¼ .49, 95% CI [.33, .64]; d ¼ .35, 95% CI [.23, .47].
However, the simple main effect was not significant for blue
clothing, F(1, 545) ¼ 0.00, p ¼ 1.00, Z2
p < .001; Mdiff ¼ .00,
95% CI [�.13, .13]; d ¼ .00, 95% CI [�.12, .12]. Therefore,
more red and black clothing was displayed on a date in com-
parison with a pre-date interview. These results were not qual-
ified by a Sex � Dating Context � Clothing Color interaction,
F(2, 1088) ¼ 1.40, p ¼ .248, Z2
p ¼ .003.
We also included Type of Date (heterosexual, homosexual)
as an additional between-participants factor in the above
ANOVA but found no significant main effect or interactions
involving this factor (all ps > .323).
Discussion
In a large sample of participants, we investigated whether
specific colors of clothing were displayed more on dates in
comparison with pre-date interviews, allowing us to contrast
these two situations for the same sample of participants. Our
results showed that both men and women wore more red and
black during their dates in comparison with pre-date inter-
views, while no difference was found across these two con-
texts for blue clothing.
Previous research has shown that women chose to display
red more frequently in imagined scenarios when expecting to
interact with attractive men (Elliot, Greitemeyer, et al., 2013)
or where the probability of meeting a potential mate was high
(Prokop & Hromada, 2013). Investigating real-world displays
of red, Niesta Kayser and colleagues (2016) found that female
study participants chose to wear red more often when they
expected to meet an attractive (vs. unattractive) male
researcher. Our results in the current work support and extend
these findings, showing that people wear more red clothing
during real-world first dates in comparison with a non-date
context. Importantly, the nature of our data set allowed for a
within-participants comparison of behaviors, contrasting dis-
plays of the same person across two contexts. Although com-
paring two groups, each observed in a different context, may
show differences in red displays (Niesta Kayser et al., 2016),
such designs inherently suffer from greater noise (or possible
confounds) due to other group differences. Here, we find
changes in red displays when participants served as their own
matched controls.
Our results showed that the amount of red displayed by men
was higher in the dating context. Although previous research
found that men saw themselves as more attractive when wear-
ing red (Berthold et al., 2017), and others also shared this
perception of them (Elliot et al., 2010), it may be that display-
ing red can have additional, and sometimes undesirable,
effects. For example, men wearing red were rated as more
aggressive, dominant, and angry-looking (Wiedemann, Burt,
Hill, & Barton, 2015; cf. Kramer, 2016). Perhaps red displays
in men, in comparison with women, show weaker associations
with attractiveness and/or stronger associations with aggres-
sion. However, further research is needed on this topic.
The results of our analysis found that the amount of both red
and black clothing displayed was higher during participants’
first dates. Previous research has shown that red and black
clothing are perceived to be equally attractive on men and
women (Roberts et al., 2010). As such, it is no surprise that
more black was also worn in a context in which participants
hoped to look their most attractive. This increase in black
appears, upon initial consideration, to call into question the
specificity of the “red–sex” link (Elliot & Niesta, 2008), which
predicts that only red displays should increase in the current
context. However, recent evidence has shown that these colors
may increase attractiveness through different pathways—red
increases the perceived sexual receptivity of its wearers while
black increases perceived fashionableness (Pazda, Elliot, et al.,
2014). Although distinct mechanisms could explain why we
find an increase in the display of both colors in the current
work, this account has little to say regarding why black in
particular is considered a fashionable color in society.
Here, we found no change in the amount of blue displayed
across the two contexts, perhaps because blue may not be
displayed to increase attractiveness. Indeed, previous studies
found that blue was seen as less attractive than red on men
(Elliot et al., 2010) and women (Elliot & Niesta, 2008) and
that wearers rated themselves as less attractive when in blue
than red (Berthold et al., 2017). That no change was found for
blue clothing is an important result, demonstrating that daters
did not simply increase the amount of color worn in general.
However, as noted above, we find an increase for both red and
black in the context of a date. Therefore, while we were
unable to consider an unlimited range of additional colors in
the present study, it is possible that other colors may also be

views and dates. Error bars represent the standard error. *p � .001.

 displayed more on a date and with varying effects on percei-
vers’ judgments.
Interestingly, significantly more black was worn by partici-
pants than red in both contexts (see Figure 1) in line with
previous findings (Elliot & Pazda, 2012). We hypothesize that
both black and red may increase attractiveness but only the
latter is associated with sexual interest/intent (Elliot & Pazda,
2012; Pazda, Elliot, et al., 2014). Therefore, red may be worn
more sparingly, given its particular signaling function. Indeed,
we found a larger increase in the amount of black displayed
across the two contexts (0.49) in comparison with the increase
in red (0.15). While red may increase perceived attractiveness
through evolutionary mechanisms, daters appear to rely more
heavily on black in order to attract a potential mate. This sug-
gests that cultural and/or societal influences (e.g., black is seen
as fashionable and hence attractive) may play a much larger
role in the way people dress than the use of evolutionary signals
that have been discussed here. Alternatively, as noted above,
daters were unaware of the attractiveness of their dating part-
ners beforehand, and so may have employed a strategy of
increasing their own attractiveness (wearing more black) while
being more conservative in their signals of interest (wearing
more red). From an evolutionary perspective, signaling interest
to unattractive (potentially lower quality) partners should lower
reproductive fitness (Niesta Kayser & Schwarz, 2017). Further
work might address how these different motivations manifest
in real-world dating scenarios.
As noted, the average increase in the amount of red dis-
played in the dating versus interview context was 0.15 on a
0–4 rating scale. Our measure of effect size (Cohen’s d ¼
.19) confirmed that this should be considered a small effect.
While our large sample size and within-subjects design
resulted in a statistically significant difference, we question
whether this increase is of practical importance. Does such a
small increase provide support for the hypothesis that peo-
ple use red displays in the real world? We acknowledge that
our baseline for comparison was given by the clothing worn
for a televised interview, and as such, it could be that par-
ticipants were already using clothing displays to increase
their attractiveness. However, even if we used 0 (no red
clothing day-to-day) as our baseline, the resulting increase
of 0.38 on our scale would still provide only weak evidence
that red was being used by our daters.
Interestingly, our effect size appears to be considerably
smaller than those reported in previous work. For example,
when women expected to interact with an attractive versus
unattractive man, Cohen’s d was .57 for the quantity of red
displayed (Niesta Kayser et al., 2016) and .67 when choosing
a red versus green shirt to wear (Elliot, Greitemeyer, et al.,
2013). In addition, when presented with scenarios in which
there was a high versus low probability of meeting a potential
mate, Cohen’s d was .71 for women’s choices of red versus
non-red clothing (Prokop & Hromada, 2013). These medium to
large effects resulted from laboratory-based studies, and we
argue that our use of a within-subjects design with a large
sample in a naturalistic setting represents a more precise
estimate of the true effect. Future research might benefit from
approaching red effects with the assumption that these are
likely to be subtle, at least in real-world contexts, and so larger
samples sizes and/or sensitive designs should be employed.
More common in women than men, the use of cosmetics
provides an additional outlet for displaying the color red. Pre-
vious work by Niesta Kayser and colleagues (2016) included
women’s displays of red through makeup in their coding
scheme. However, we chose not to code makeup displays in
the current study for three reasons. First, we had no control over
viewing conditions when observing our participants since we
were limited to interactions that had already been filmed,
which meant that it was often difficult to accurately determine
whether cosmetics had been applied to faces and nails and
which colors had been used. Second, shades of pink and red
are the most common colors of makeup used by women, espe-
cially when applying lipstick, and so coding the presence of red
makeup often simplifies to the presence or absence of makeup
itself. Given the prevalence of cosmetics use in modern society,
we felt that virtually all women would be wearing some form of
cosmetics for their television appearances. Third, makeup art-
ists are often employed on set to apply their own products
during the filming of television shows (to counter strong light-
ing, etc.), and since we had no information regarding whether
this process took place, we could not be sure if the makeup
displayed was chosen by the participants themselves or not.
Future studies might consider red displays through cosmetics
in a more controlled dating context, where detailed information
regarding product use can be collected.
In the current work, we found no effect of the type of
date (heterosexual vs. homosexual) that participants were
on, suggesting that the increase in red and black clothing
in dating contexts applied to all daters. We acknowledge
that only 14% of participants in our sample were on
same-sex dates (see the Online Supplementary Material),
and so these data are only preliminary with respect to homo-
sexual clothing displays, requiring further replication. Inter-
estingly, such evidence of red displays in homosexual dating
provides support for a cultural account, whereby red is con-
sidered attractive in modern day interactions irrespective of
fertility and other biological factors.
In the current study, we were unable to investigate the
potential influence of sociosexual orientation, that is, whether
daters were more interested in short-term relationships and/or
casual sex versus more long-term and/or committed relation-
ships. Research has shown that women displaying red were
evaluated as having higher sexual intent (Gu´
eguen, 2012),
along with the complimentary finding that women interested
in casual sex were more likely to display red (Elliot & Pazda,
2012). If future studies were able to collect information regard-
ing the motivations of the dating participants, we might predict
that red displays would be used more frequently by women
who were seeking (or at least more open to) casual sex.
Furthermore, our findings are unable to speak to the recent
work regarding peak fertility and displays of red. Evidence
suggests that women choose to wear red or pink clothing more
Kramer and Mulgrew
5
 often at peak fertility (Beall & Tracy, 2013; Eisenbruch et al.,
2015; Tracy & Beall, 2014). The participants in our study
provided no information about their menstrual cycles and so
we could not investigate whether fertility played a role in red
displays here. However, fertility is also a product of age in
women. Researchers found that the photograph of an older
woman (perceived age of 48) was not rated as more attractive
when displayed on a red background (Schwarz & Singer,
2013), suggesting that red displays may only enhance the
attractiveness of young (premenopausal) women. In the current
data set, for women over 50, there is no difference in ratings for
the amount of red displayed in the two contexts, t(29) ¼ 0.17,
p ¼ .865. Although only exploratory and with a limited sample
size, this result may provide tentative support for the idea that
displaying red to increase attractiveness is only effective for,
and hence utilized by, younger women. Further, the current
female sample (age M ¼ 32.49 years, SD ¼ 13.80 years) was
somewhat older than previous laboratory-based samples (typi-
cally recruiting students in their early twenties), which might
contribute to the smaller effect size for red found here. How-
ever, as noted, the majority of our sample were premenopausal,
and so the red-sex link should still be apparent.
In conclusion, the present research demonstrates that both
women and men display more red clothing during a first date in
comparison with a non-date context. Our use of a field study to
investigate real-world dating behaviors, away from the labora-
tory, provides the first evidence that people choose to display
red when meeting a potential mate for the first time. Impor-
tantly, we found this same pattern of behavior for black cloth-
ing, and indeed, our results suggested that black may represent
a more utilized signal than red in dating contexts. The current
work included a large sample with a repeated-measures design,
representing a strong demonstration of the use of red and black
displays in dating contexts. This research reveals interesting
mechanisms through which people may seek to increase their
attractiveness and/or reveal their intentions to potential
partners.
