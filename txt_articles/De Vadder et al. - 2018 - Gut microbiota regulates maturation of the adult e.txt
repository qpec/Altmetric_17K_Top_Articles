The enteric nervous system (ENS) is crucial for essential gastroin-
testinal physiologic functions such as motility, fluid secretion, and
blood flow. The gut is colonized by trillions of bacteria that regulate
host production of several signaling molecules including serotonin
(5-HT) and other hormones and neurotransmitters. Approximately
90% of 5-HT originates from the intestine, and activation of the 5-
HT4 receptor in the ENS has been linked to adult neurogenesis and
neuroprotection. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the gut micro-
biota could induce maturation of the adult ENS through release of 5-
HT and activation of 5-HT4 receptors. Colonization of germ-free mice
with a microbiota from conventionally raised mice modified the
neuroanatomy of the ENS and increased intestinal transit rates,
which was associated with neuronal and mucosal 5-HT production
and the proliferation of enteric neuronal progenitors in the adult
intestine. Pharmacological modulation of the 5-HT4 receptor, as well
as depletion of endogenous 5-HT, identified a mechanistic link be-
tween the gut microbiota and maturation of the adult ENS through
the release of 5-HT and activation of the 5-HT4 receptor. Taken
together, these findings show that the microbiota modulates the
anatomy of the adult ENS in a 5-HT–dependent fashion with con-
comitant changes in intestinal transit.

T
he gastrointestinal tract is unique in the body, as it has an
intrinsic nervous system, the enteric nervous system (ENS),
composed of the outer myenteric plexus and the inner submucosal
plexus. The ENS has several essential physiologic functions, such
as regulation of gastrointestinal motility, fluid secretion and ab-
sorption, and blood flow (1). In rodents, most enteric neurons are
formed during embryogenesis and early postnatal life (2–5).
During this process, a small subpopulation of Sox10-expressing
neural crest-derived cells colonizes the foregut, subsequently un-
dergoes proliferation, and then colonizes the entire bowel, giving
rise to both neurons and glial cells (6–8). Furthermore, enteric
neuronal stem cells, which express markers such as Nestin, have
been reported in the postnatal murine intestine (9–11). While it
was long thought that no enteric neurons were formed after
postnatal day 21 in mice, except in cases of inflammation or injury
(2–4), a recent study has demonstrated that the ENS undergoes
continuous renewal in adult mice, with apoptosis balancing neu-
rogenesis (12). Thus, this report demonstrates that the adult ENS
is capable of maturation and plasticity, but the mechanisms driving
these processes remain unknown.
The microbiota colonizes the gastrointestinal tract after birth
with continuous maturation during the first year of life (13). Con-
comitantly with colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and matu-
ration of the mucosal immune system, the ENS undergoes extensive
development during the early postnatal life (14). Accordingly, germ-
free (GF) mice, which lack a gut microbiota, have early postna-
tal structural and functional abnormalities of the ENS (15). These
features can be reversed by colonization with the microbiota from a
conventionally raised (CONV-R) donor (16).
About 90% of the body’s serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)
is produced by enterochromaffin (EC) cells, a type of enter-
oendocrine cells which are present in the epithelium of the gut
(17). Recently, two studies have reported that the gut microbiota
is able to induce mucosal 5-HT secretion in the gut (18, 19). The
concept that mucosal and neuronal 5-HT are distinct pools is
supported by the fact that different forms of the rate-limiting
synthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) are used by
neuronal and nonneuronal cells, with TPH2 used by neurons and
TPH1 used by EC cells (20). While mucosal 5-HT is strongly
proinflammatory (21, 22), activation of the 5-HT4 receptor (5-
HT4R) in the ENS exerts neurogenerative and neuroprotective
actions (4, 23).
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota
modulates the function and the anatomy of the ENS through
release of 5-HT and activation of the 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R).
Colonization of GF mice reduced intestinal transit time and was
associated with the release of 5-HT. We studied GF and
Significance
The gut microbiota affects several physiological processes, in-
cluding gut motility. Here we observed that germ-free mice have
an immature enteric nervous system (ENS) that is normalized
upon colonization with a normal microbiota. We identified the
mechanism of communication between the microbiota and en-
teric neurons as the initiation of serotonin release and sub-
sequent activation of the 5-HT4 receptor. This demonstrates a
strong interaction between the microbiota and the ENS and in-
dicates potential mechanisms linking microbial dysbiosis to
gastrointestinal disorders. The ability to modulate the micro-
biota, e.g., by diet, will open new perspectives of research
in neurogastroenterology.

 colonized Tph1-deficient mice and demonstrated that mucosal
5-HT is neuroprotective in the early phases of colonization.
Next, we studied the respective roles of mucosal and neuronal
5-HT in the observed phenotype through inhibition of TPH1 and
TPH2 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) or depletion of
neuronal 5-HT with reserpine. Finally, using pharmacological
modulation of the 5-HT4 receptor, we established a link between
the gut microbiota and neuronal activation of 5-HT4Rs.
Results
The Gut Microbiota Regulates Intestinal Transit Accompanied by
Neuroanatomic Changes of the ENS. Recent work has shown that
the gut microbiota is essential for normal brain development and
function in mice (24), but much less is known about the impli-
cations of the gut microbiota in the development of the ENS. A
recent study established that the microbiota is required for the
postnatal development of enteric glial cells of the mucosa (25),
but so far mechanistic studies on the role of the gut microbiota in
the maturation of ENS neurons, and particularly colonic enteric
neurons, are lacking.
We determined a link between the gut microbiota and ENS
function and anatomy by colonizing 12-wk-old GF mice with the
microbiota from the cecum of age-matched donor mice, gener-
ating CONV-D mice. In agreement with previous findings (26),
we found that GF mice exhibited significantly slower intestinal
transit than CONV-R controls and that intestinal transit was
normalized after 15 d, but not 3 d, of colonization, i.e., when the
microbial community is fully established after colonization (Fig. 1A)
(27, 28). While we did not observe any difference in the
number of myenteric neurons or innervation of the longitudinal
muscle/myenteric plexus (LMMP) between GF, CONV-D, and
CONV-R mice, as revealed by immunohistochemical quantification
of the pan-neuronal marker HuC/D and the neurite marker Tuj1
(Fig. 1 B–D), innervation of the colonic epithelium was reduced in
GF animals. These phenotypes were restored 15 d after colonization
(Fig. 1 E and F), mirroring the faster transit (Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy
that, in accordance with a previous study (25), colonization increased
the density of the glial network (as revealed by immunostaining for
the glia-specific marker S100β; see SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B).
However, the number of Sox10+ cells (a marker of neuronal and glial
progenitors) was not affected by the microbial status of the mice (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D), suggesting that (i) glia are larger after
colonization or (ii) a greater percentage of glia express S100β. Sox10+
cells have been shown to give rise to neurons and glial cells in vitro
and in vivo (2, 3, 25). A previous study using reporter mice found
that, after colonization, Sox10+ cells undergo proliferation in the
myenteric plexus, followed by migration to the mucosa, giving rise to
enteric glial cells (25). In line with that finding, we found that about
1% of Sox10+ cells expressed Ki67 in the myenteric plexus 15 d after
colonization (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
Next, we investigated whether depletion of the gut microbiota by
3-wk antibiotic treatment in CONV-R mice reduced innervation of

 the colon mucosa. Microbial depletion was confirmed by qPCR
and was associated with cecum enlargement (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A
and Table S1). Unlike GF mice, the depletion resulted in reduced
innervation of the colonic mucosa and LMMP, which was associ-
ated with a decrease in the glial network (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B–
H). This suggests that the presence of a gut microbiota is not
necessary for the development of the nervous myenteric network
but is crucial for the maintenance of the network.
Nestin is a cytoskeletal protein that is expressed by a variety of
neural stem cells (10, 12, 29, 30). Nestin+ cells in the myenteric
plexus of adult mice give rise to neurons in vivo (12), and studies
of Nestin-GFP transgenic mice suggest that coexpression of
Nestin and HuC/D is a signature of neuronal plasticity in the
adult ENS (10). Thus, we determined the proportion of Nestin+
neurons in GF, CONV-D, and CONV-R mice (Fig. 2A). Colo-
nization of GF mice induced a global decrease in the proportion
of Nestin+ neurons (χ2 = 208.7; df = 3; P < 10−4) (Fig. 2B),
suggesting that GF mice retain a higher plasticity in the ENS,
which is maintained for at least 3 d after colonization but dis-
appears when the microbiota has reached a steady state.
Colonization of GF Mice Induces Proliferation of a Preexisting Nestin+
Subpopulation of Neural Precursors. To test the hypothesis that
colonization of GF mice with a normal microbiota induces the
proliferation of neural precursor cells, we examined the coex-
pression of Nestin with the cycling marker Ki67 in the myenteric
ganglia of the colon. We found that in GF mice as many as 5% of
the Nestin+ cells retained the capacity to undergo proliferation
and that this state persisted 3 and 15 d after colonization (Fig. 3
A and B). In contrast, less than 1% of Nestin+ cells in CONV-R
mice expressed Ki67 (P = 0.03 vs. GF; Kruskal–Wallis test fol-
lowed by Dunn’s post hoc test). We also observed that some
Ki67+ cells had a small rim of Nestin+ cytoplasm (Fig. 3).
Since myenteric Nestin+ cells are responsible for adult neu-
rogenesis in the ENS (12), our results suggest that GF mice re-
tain a potential for neurogenesis and maturation of the ENS
which can be activated upon colonization. However, since we
observed no difference in the density of neurons in GF mice,
proliferation is likely compensated for by cell loss. Taken to-
gether, our results suggest that neuronal differentiation from
Nestin+ cells occurs after exposure to the gut microbiota.
Interactions Between the Microbiota and Mucosal 5-HT are
Neuroprotective. 5-HT has been implicated in neurogenesis as well
as in promoting the survival of neurons. We confirmed previous
observations that colonization of GF mice partially restored serum
levels of 5-HT (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A) (18, 19, 31), likely by in-
ducing de novo 5-HT synthesis by increasing the expression of the
rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, Tph1, in the mucosa (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4B). Furthermore, depletion of the microbiota with
antibiotics reduced circulating 5-HT levels (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C).
To investigate whether mucosal 5-HT production was required
to maintain the neuroanatomy of the ENS, we quantified neu-
ronal density in Tph1-knockout (Tph1−/−) mice. After confirming
that Tph1 was not expressed in the colon of our knockout mice
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4D), we analyzed the anatomy of the ENS in
Tph1−/− mice and wild-type littermates. CONV-R Tph1−/− mice
do not show any evident alterations in the neuroanatomy of the
ENS (32), but no study so far has focused on these mice under GF
conditions. In line with previous studies in the ileum of CONV-R
mice (32), we did not observe significant changes in the neuro-
anatomy of the ENS of CONV-R and GF mice (Fig. 4). However,
when GF mice were colonized for 3 d with the microbiota of wild-
type C57BL/6 CONV-R mice (yielding CONV-D mice), we found
that Tph1−/− mice (Fig. 4 A and B) had a decreased number of
myenteric neurons (effect of microbiota: 35% of total variation;
two-way ANOVA, P = 0.02), highlighting the importance of mu-
cosal 5-HT in maintaining the integrity of the ENS during the early
colonization period. Moreover, the proportion of Nestin+ neurons
was significantly reduced in CONV-D Tph1−/− mice (Fig. 4 D and E

 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4E). Taken together, our data show that the
microbiota-induced release of mucosal 5-HT is neuroprotective for
the ENS in the early phases of colonization.
The Gut Microbiota Induces Neuronal 5-HT Production. It has been
shown that the release of 5-HT from enteric neurons influences
the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons (32),
showing the importance of serotonergic neurons in organizing
more mature ENS network components. We performed immu-
nohistochemistry of 5-HT in the LMMP and found that seroto-
nergic neuronal networks were almost absent in GF mice but
were gradually restored by colonization with a gut microbiota
(Fig. 5 A and B). Importantly, the presence of a gut microbiota
was crucial to maintain the serotonergic networks, since depletion
with antibiotics abolished 5-HT immunoreactivity (SI Appendix,
Fig. S5 B and C). To distinguish the specific roles of serotonin on
the observed phenotype, we chronically treated CONV-D mice for
3 d with PCPA, a selective and irreversible inhibitor of TPH1 and
TPH2, or with reserpine, an irreversible blocker of vesicular mono-
amine transporter (thus depleting neuronal 5-HT). We confirmed
that PCPA and reserpine diminished 5-HT immunoreactivity in the
LMMP (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 E–H).
Treatment with the TPH inhibitor PCPA resulted in reduced
density of myenteric neurons (Fig. 5 D and E). Surprisingly, the
treatment also led to a significant increase in the proportion of
Nestin+ neurons (Fig. 5 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). These data
suggest that blocking 5-HT production results in (i) loss of myenteric
neurons similar to that observed in Tph1−/− CONV-D mice and (ii)
inhibition of neuronal differentiation from Nestin+ progenitors.
While there was no significant difference in the number of
neurons or in Tuj1+ neurite density in reserpine-treated CONV-
R (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 J and K) or CONV-D (Fig. 5 D–F) mice,
the treatment significantly decreased the proportion of Nestin+
neurons (Fig. 5 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). It is note-
worthy that reserpine is an irreversible blocker of the vesicular
monoamine transporter, which also transports dopamine and
noradrenaline, so we cannot exclude the possibility that these
neurotransmitters contribute to the phenotype. Further studies
with GF and CONV-D Tph2-deficient mice might confirm the
specificity of the action of neuronal 5-HT on maturation of the
ENS after colonization.

MICROBIOLOGY
 Activation of the 5-HT4R in GF Mice Induces Maturation of the Adult
ENS. The 5-HT4R is widely expressed in the intestine (33, 34), and
mucosal application of 5-HT4R agonists activates mucus discharge
by goblet cells and Cl− secretion by enterocytes, whereas 5-HT4R
antagonists block these actions (33). Stimulation of 5-HT4R also
induces adult neurogenesis and neuroprotection in the gut (4, 23).
Here, we confirmed that 5-HT4R was expressed in the ENS, and
specifically in myenteric neurons (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A), and
found that its expression was dependent upon the presence of a
gut microbiota (Fig. 5 A and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S5 B and D).
Similar to 5-HT, we observed that 5-HT4R expression was located
in the soma of the cells in GF mice but in serotonergic neurites
after colonization (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Fig. S5A).
We next colonized GF mice and concomitantly treated them for
3 d with chronic injections of the 5-HT4R antagonist GR-125487.
Treatment with the antagonist did not affect the density of the
neuronal network but resulted in a decrease in the number of
myenteric neurons (Fig. 5 D–F). The proportion of Nestin+ neu-
rons (Fig. 5 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S6) was significantly
reduced by the treatment. This suggests that neuronal 5-HT re-
lease regulates the stemness of neuronal progenitors in the ENS,
while specific activation of 5-HT4R also regulates proliferation.
To test directly whether the effects of colonization on ENS
anatomy could be phenocopied in GF mice, we treated GF mice
with the 5-HT4R agonist sc-53116 for 4 d. We observed that
activation of 5-HT4R in GF mice was associated with faster in-
testinal transit (Fig. 6A), concomitant with an increased number
of myenteric neurons (Fig. 6 B–D) and increased innervation of
the colonic mucosa (Fig. 6 E and F).
Taken together, our data suggest that, upon colonization, the
gut microbiota stimulates neuronal and mucosal 5-HT release
and that 5-HT4R activation in GF mice leads to differentiation
and maturation of enteric neurons.
Discussion
The ENS contains cells that give rise to neurons in vitro and
in vivo (2, 3, 9). In this study, we showed that colonization of
adult GF mice induced maturation of the ENS associated with
the proliferation of Nestin+ progenitors precursors present in GF
mice. While blocking 5-HT4R or depleting endogenous 5-HT
prevented the process, GF mice had restored innervation of the
gut when treated with 5-HT4R agonists. Here we show that
maturation of the adult ENS requires 5-HT4R–specific signaling
and that colonization by gut microbes of GF Tph1−/− mice
resulted in fewer myenteric neurons, suggesting that both pools
of enteric 5-HT are crucial for maintenance of the adult ENS.
Our findings confirm that the maturation capacity of the ENS
(i.e., growth of neurites and neurogenesis) continues in adult
mice in a microbiota-naive gut. Interestingly, GF rodents show
an abnormal proportion of calbindin and nitrergic myenteric
neurons, suggesting that the microbiota influences the matura-
tion of intestinal neural networks (15, 16, 35). Furthermore, func-
tional activity of the ENS can be regulated by the microbiota, either
directly through Toll-like receptors (36) or by inducing the secretion
of BMP2 by macrophages (37). A recent study showed that adult
enteric neurogenesis is an active process that is balanced with ap-
optosis (12). Our results complement these findings and suggest that
Nestin+ cells can undergo proliferation and differentiation into
functional neurons. However, the mechanisms by which the gut
bacteria impact the organization of the ENS remained unexplored.
For example, in cases of dysbiosis, NO production in the ENS is
impaired (38). Thus, it is likely that nitrergic and serotonergic
pathways interact with the microbiota to establish a functional ENS.
The gastrointestinal tract is the site where most 5-HT is syn-
thesized, and recently two studies have shown that the gut
microbiota plays a key role in promoting 5-HT secretion (18, 19).
We confirmed these findings, but our results suggest that neu-
ronal and mucosal 5-HT play complementary roles in the ENS
maturation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Neuronal 5-HT has been
identified as a major neuronal growth factor during development
(32) while also acting as a promoter of growth and a suppressor
of inflammation in the intestinal mucosa (22, 39). We com-
plemented these findings by rederiving Tph1−/− mice as germ-
free. Similar to the PCPA-treated mice, colonization of these
mice resulted in a decreased number of myenteric neurons,
showing that mucosal 5-HT is crucial for the integrity of the ENS
in the early stages of colonization. However, unlike Tph1−/− and
reserpine-treated CONV-D mice, PCPA induced an increase in
the ratio of Nestin+ cells in the myenteric plexus, an observation
that requires future investigation.
The altered organization and properties of enteric neurons in
GF mice also influence gastrointestinal function. Treatment with
the 5-HT4R agonist prucalopride protects enteric neurons against
oxidative stress (23), and activation of 5-HT4R in the epithelium
reduces inflammation in mice with colitis (40). Changes in the gut
microbiota triggered, for example, by infection, stress, or antibiotic
usage have been suggested to cause irritable bowel syndrome (41).
Thus, improved understanding of the dialogue between the micro-
biota and the ENS opens the possibility for new treatments for
inflammatory diseases of the gut.
