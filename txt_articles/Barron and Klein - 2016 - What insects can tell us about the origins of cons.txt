How, why, and when consciousness evolved remain hotly debated topics. Addressing these issues requires
considering the distribution of consciousness across the animal phylogenetic tree. Here we propose that at
least one invertebrate clade, the insects, has a capacity for the most basic aspect of consciousness:
subjective experience. In vertebrates the capacity for subjective experience is supported by integrated
structures in the midbrain that create a neural simulation of the state of the mobile animal in space. This
integrated and egocentric representation of the world from the animal’s perspective is sufficient for sub-
jective experience. Structures in the insect brain perform analogous functions. Therefore, we argue the
insect brain also supports a capacity for subjective experience. In both vertebrates and insects this form of
behavioral control system evolved as an efficient solution to basic problems of sensory reafference and
true navigation. The brain structures that support subjective experience in vertebrates and insects are very
different from each other, but in both cases they are basal to each clade. Hence we propose the origins of
subjective experience can be traced to the Cambrian.

Consciousness is marked by the presence of sub-
jective experience: In the philosopher’s term of art,
there is “something it is like” for us to be aware of
the world (1). Neurotypical adult humans are obviously
conscious. So are young human children, although we
recognize that the nature of consciousness in children
is different from that of adults and changes rapidly as
children develop. Plausibly, some animals also have
the capacity for some forms of consciousness—at
least, it certainly seems odd to insist that the inner life
of a chimp goes on entirely in the dark. However,
consciousness also gives out somewhere. Plants do
not have it. It would be surprising if jellyfish did. Where
to draw the line between what is conscious and what is
not, and how to justify drawing that line, remain hotly
debated questions.
These debates are especially difficult when it
comes to assessing potential consciousness in inver-
tebrates. Methodological challenges are partly to
blame. The three most common methods of studying
consciousness in humans—verbal report, behavioral
demonstrations, and neural correlation with conscious
activity—generalize poorly to invertebrate models.
Nonhuman animals cannot give verbal reports about
what they are experiencing. There have been at-
tempts to deploy to animals behavioral paradigms
that are considered evidence of conscious processing
when successfully performed by humans (2–4). This
introduces a strong bias toward anthropomorphic per-
formance by animals. As skeptics are quick to note, we
have no guarantee that animals that behave like hu-
mans do so because they have the same subjective
experiences that humans do. (Indeed, establishing this
is precisely the issue.) Further, the bias toward clever
animals is itself distorting. Many invertebrates live
comparatively simple lives, without complex forms of
communication and social behavior. If one cares about
the basic capacity for consciousness and where it
came from, one should be prepared to accept that
the origins of consciousness may lie in animals that
do only very boring, unclever things.
The search for the neural correlates of conscious-
ness (NCCs) (5) is often framed as avoiding the pitfalls
of purely behavioral research. NCC research focuses
on the contents of particular conscious experiences,
rather than the overall capacity for subjective expe-
rience (6). NCCs may thus be a poor guide to the
more basic shared capacity to have any conscious

 experiences at all. In practice, NCC work also tends toward the
anthropocentric, and the best paradigms are still difficult to ex-
tend to invertebrates. NCC results thus tend to be biased toward
complex cortical structures and cannot generalize to animals lack-
ing a cortex.
In this review, we will suggest an alternative approach to
studying the capacity for subjective experience in invertebrates.
Neuroethological approaches have made great advances in
determining how neurobiological mechanisms within the insect
brain generate adaptive behavior. We argue that knowledge of
these mechanisms can ground an evidence-based inquiry into the
capacity for consciousness in insects. We begin our argument by
discussing the basic features of the simplest forms of conscious-
ness, the capacity to have subjective experience (7). We then
consider structures that support the capacity for subjective expe-
rience in humans. Following Bjorn Merker (8, 9), we argue that the
human midbrain subserves the basic capacity for subjective expe-
rience. It does so in virtue of producing an integrated simulation
of the state of the animal’s own mobile body within the environ-
ment. We then argue that the insect brain performs similar func-
tions, even though the anatomy of the insect brain is very different
from that of vertebrates. Insects have specialized brain structures
that solve the same basic problems by producing the same kind of
unified model. We therefore conclude that if subjective experi-
ence is indeed supported by midbrain structures in humans, then
insects also have the capacity for a form of subjective experience.
Finally, we propose that a capacity for subjective experience
probably evolved early in the history of animal life for specific
animal clades. We thus suggest that the study of insects gives a
unique comparative perspective on the mechanisms and evolu-
tion of consciousness.
Subjective Experience and the Vertebrate Midbrain
Behavioral researchers have realized the need to distinguish dif-
ferent levels of consciousness. There are many classifications (7),
but each posits a basic form of consciousness that consists of a
direct awareness of the world without further reflection upon that
awareness. This basic level has been termed primary conscious-
ness (10), core consciousness (11, 12), phenomenal consciousness
(13), or “I” consciousness (14). The defining feature of this most
basic level of consciousness is the appearance of the capacity for
subjective experience.
Humans are capable of more complex forms of consciousness.
We can reflect upon our own mental states, for example, which is
why verbal reports are so valuable. The levels corresponding to
these higher capacities are variously termed self-reflexive con-
sciousness (7), access consciousness (13), higher-order awareness
(10), or “me” consciousness (14). These higher forms of con-
sciousness require more than the mere capacity for subjective
experience: the ability to represent one’s own subjective experi-
ence to oneself, awareness of oneself as a self, the possession of
the concept of experience, or full linguistic capability.
We mention these more complex levels of consciousness to
bracket them off. It is contentious whether any other higher ver-
tebrates possess them; we think it exceedingly unlikely that any
invertebrates do. Our argument thus concerns only whether in-
sects have subjective experience. Because subjective experience
is a simpler phenomenon than self-reflexive consciousness, one
might reasonably expect it to be more widespread in the animal
kingdom, and evolutionarily older.
There is now considerable evidence that, in humans, sub-
jective experience can exist in the absence of self-reflexive
consciousness, and that the two are supported by different neural
structures. Midbrain structures, rather than cortex, seem to be
especially important. Merker (8, 9), Parvisi and Damasio (11),
Damasio and Carvalho (15), and Mashour and Alkire (16) have all
argued that the integrated structures of the vertebrate midbrain
are sufficient to support the capacity for subjective experience.
Merker (8) notes that subjective experience is remarkably
sensitive to damage to midbrain structures. Conversely, there is
evidence of preserved consciousness even in patients who lack a
cortex (9). Further, although cortical damage can have profound
effects on the contents of consciousness, damage to any portion
of the cortex alone can spare the basic capacity for subjective
experience (17–22). Cortical damage alone can have profound
effects on the contents of consciousness, but even massive cor-
tical damage seems to spare subjective experience itself (8, 17,
18). Indeed, there is evidence of residual conscious awareness in
patients with severe cortical damage who are otherwise unre-
sponsive to the world, suggesting that preserved subcortical
structures may continue to support subjective experience (23, 24).
Although the mechanism of anesthetic action is still debated (25),
there is increasing evidence that the effect of anesthetics de-
pends on the disconnection of cortical circuits from subcortical
structures rather than on their direct cortical activity (26, 27). An-
esthetics (28) or electrical stimulation (19), which affect cortical
midline structures without affecting subcortical structures, do not
abolish consciousness; they instead produce unresponsive but
conscious dreamlike states. Conversely, emergence from anes-
thesia (16, 29) and coma/vegetative state (30) are predicted by the
reengagement of subcortical structures and reintegration of those
structures with cortical circuits. Other authors have noted the
powerful subcortical effect of drugs, endogenous peptides, and
direct stimulation on primitive motivational states (12, 16, 31).
In sum, there is good evidence that subcortical structures un-
derlie the basic capacity for subjective experience in humans. This
is not to say that the cortex is unimportant for conscious experi-
ence, of course. Rather, the proposal is that subcortical structures
support the basic capacity for experience, the detailed contents of
which might be elaborated by or otherwise depend upon cortical
structures (32).
How the Vertebrate Midbrain Supports the Capacity for
Subjective Experience
We will adopt and expand the account given by Merker (8), who
argues that subjective experience arises from interacting midbrain
and basal ganglia structures creating an integrated simulation of
the state of the animal’s own mobile body within the environment.
Merker suggests that an important function of the midbrain is
to combine interoceptive (stimuli arising from within the body)
and exteroceptive (stimuli external to the body) sensory in-
formation. Information on the environment, and the location and
movement of the animal within it, is processed within the roof of
the midbrain (the tectum, or colliculus in mammals). Information
about homeostatic needs is processed within the floor of the
midbrain (the hypothalamus and associated structures). Nuclei
located between these poles integrate this information to pro-
duce a unified multimodal neural model of the spatial location of
resources relative to the animal, which is coupled to, and
weighted by, the extent to which different resources are needed
by the animal (8) (Fig. 1A). Vertebrates organize their behavior by
reference to this integrated model of the environment rather than
by reacting to independent sensory inputs (8, 33).

 In mammals the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC)
receive topographically organized visual inputs (34), whereas the
deeper layers receive topographically organized visual, auditory,
and somatosensory input (8, 15, 33, 35). In some species, spe-
cialized spatial senses such as infrared and magneto- and elec-
trosenses and echolocation send topographically organized
inputs to the SC (8, 36–38). Within a species, the sensory topo-
graphic maps in different layers of the SC are superposed,
meaning specific regions of space are represented by similar
points in each overlaid sensory map (39). This arrangement allows
a point of convergence for processed spatially structured in-
formation, in turn allowing an integrated sense of space that in-
cludes the position, state, and movement of the body (9, 40–42).
Organizing behavior by reference to an integrated simulation
of the state of the mobile body in space also provides an efficient
neural solution for resolving the confusing sensory input caused
by self-motion [the so-called reafference problem (43)]. Bodily
motion causes widespread changes in sensory input, yet we
seamlessly disambiguate our own movements from the move-
ments of objects around us. In mammals, the multisensory inputs
to the SC include inputs from the vestibular system (44), in-
formation on eye position (45–47), and somatosensation (8). This
allows the influence of self-motion on the sensory fields to be
factored out of the constructed sensory model of the environment
(42). Resolving the reafference problem is a key function for the
mammalian SC, which is why this region is vital for organizing
motion in space for directed attention, reaching, and grasping for
targets (41, 48–50).
For active animals with well-developed spatial senses, it is
computationally more effective to resolve the reafference prob-
lem once for a unified sensory model than to resolve it in a dis-
persed and peripheral way for each sense independently. Further,
different senses are affected by reafference in different ways and
contribute different information on how the body is moving.
Reafference can thus be resolved with greater accuracy and pre-
cision by integrating information from multiple senses (9).
For mammals, the processing performed within the SC con-
structs something akin to a simulation of the moving body in the
environment (9). For humans at least, this spatial “model” is further
enhanced by processing within the subcortical dorsal pulvinar
(one of the thalamic nuclei, part of the basal ganglia) (32), which
adds color, three-dimensionality, and an egocentric first-person
perspective to the human conscious experience of space. A major
benefit of this integrated spatial simulation is that it allows animals
to interact with objects in a qualitatively different set of ways than
simple stimulus-bound organisms could manage. Animals that
navigate by reference to a simulated spatial model can actively
seek out and navigate toward hidden objects. It is worth em-
phasizing what is implied by such an apparently simple naviga-
tional ability. A food source concealed behind a barrier, for
example, is neither part of an organism’s current sensory input nor
accessible by following a simple vector with its origin at the ani-
mal’s current position. Navigation requires a unified metric space
that allows for effective computation of relative position after both
actual and hypothetical translations within that space (51–54). This
is beyond the primary sensory input but can be supported by a
simulation of the environment constructed from that input (55).
The midbrain also provides the capacity to resolve competing
behavioral priorities or motivations and rank needed resources by
both urgency and availability. The floor of the midbrain is formed
by the hypothalamic structures and associated nuclei whose
function is to integrate information from the nervous and endo-
crine systems, to harvest and respond to information on the
physiological status of the organism, and to motivate behavior to
maintain a homeostatic optimum (56) (Fig. 1B). Maintaining ho-
meostasis requires actively seeking needed resources; hence,
midbrain structures are critical for the initiation and direction of a
wide range of goal-directed behavior (15, 56). Integrative struc-
tures within the midbrain and basal ganglia, including the peri-
aqueductal gray, substantia nigra, ventral thalamus, striatum, and
midbrain reticular formation, combine this information on in-
trospective assessment of state with exteroceptive assessment of
Fig. 1. Structures of the vertebrate midbrain (not to scale) supporting the behavioral “core control system.” The vertebrate midbrain supports an
integrated multisensory model of the state of the animal in space, which supports effective decision making. (A) Decision making involves an
assessment of what is needed and where and how the needed resources can be obtained. Decision making can therefore be considered to
involve three domains: internal motivations, target selection, and action selection [adapted from the “selection triangle” proposed by Merker
(8)]). These domains interact and can be resolved by referencing an integrated neural model that contains information on the state of self, self
movement, environmental state and structure, and memory of prior experience. These elements of the neural model are supported by midbrain
structures (B). As a simplification, regions are colored according to their primary function(s) in the neural model described in A. The superior
colliculus [part of the tectum (TEC) forming the roof of the midbrain] receives topographically organized multisensory input and creates an
integrated neural model of the organism moving in space (8). The floor of the midbrain is formed by the hypothalamic structures (Hyp) and
associated nuclei [pituitary (pt) and mammillary bodies (M)] that collate information on the physiological status of the organism referenced with
prior experience, to identify needs to maintain a homeostatic optimum (15, 56). Integrative structures within the midbrain and basal ganglia,
including the periaqueductal gray (P), substantia nigra (N), thalamus (Tha), striatum (St), and midbrain reticular formation (MR), integrate these
sources of information (8, 33) (A). In advanced vertebrates the cortex and hippocampal structures clearly have a very strong input in to this
system, but this midbrain system is not dependent on cortical inputs to function (140) and is highly conserved across all vertebrate lineages (33).

 location in space to collate and resolve competing motivations,
prioritize resources, and select targets and actions (8, 33).
Midbrain and basal ganglia structures thus provide an effective
and efficient neural solution for decision making (Fig. 1A). Com-
peting and potentially conflicting behavioral responses that might
be stimulated by different inputs can be resolved within a single
behavioral control system (33, 57). Target selection and action
selection must interact (Fig. 1A) because each domain informs the
others. Motivational factors will influence the prioritization of tar-
gets and therefore action selection, but the location of targets will
also influence which is selected, and which actions should be
taken (8). Merker (8, 9) describes this as a “behavioral core control
system” within which these decision domains can be resolved.
Analyses and modeling of basal ganglia function in vertebrates
have emphasized how drawing together all evidence for different
possible actions within a unified neural system enables an effec-
tive and efficient solution for action selection, without having
to posit a higher-level decision maker reflecting on the de-
cision (57–59).
Placing the basic capacity for subjective experience in sub-
cortical structures does not rule out a role for the cortex and other
subcortical systems (including hippocampal systems) in conscious
experience. The contents of subjective experience will vary
enormously between species, and that variation will depend in
part on the degree of elaboration of cortical structures. However,
the capacity for subjective experience is not dependent on con-
taining any particular contents (9, 32). The basic capacity for
subjective experience that the midbrain supports is rather a ca-
pacity to have any subjective contents at all.
The midbrain thus provides a forum for specific contents to be
integrated together with more basic survival-oriented machinery.
However, the modeling function of the midbrain does not require
some overseer that reflects on the model [the fallacy of the
“Cartesian theater” (60)]. Decisions arise directly from this model,
not from some further decision-making process informed by
the model.
It is worth distinguishing the current proposal for the substrate
of subjective experience from other, related, accounts. Like global
workspace theories (61), we emphasize the role of consciousness
in bringing together disparate brain processes into a common
arena. Global workspace theories have a strongly cortical bias,
however, focusing on the contribution of human fronto-parietal
regions to reflective self-awareness of our mental states. It is un-
clear how widely this generalizes. We propose that even for
invertebrates—which lack anything remotely like an elaborate
cortex—holistic integration is essential for the more basic, evo-
lutionarily ancient behavioral demands of action selection, reaf-
ference adjustment, and navigation. Further, insofar as cortical
processes can matter to the organism, we argue that they must
ultimately be integrated via midbrain mechanisms (58, 62). As
Merker (8) puts it, the midbrain control system is “anatomically
subcortical [but] functionally supra-cortical.”
Like information integration theories of consciousness (63–65),
we claim that consciousness performs an important synthetic role.
Unlike information integration theories, however, it matters which
information is unified. Subjective experience requires the con-
struction of an integrated neural simulation of the agent in space,
weighted by the state of the agent. This simulation is constructed
from appropriate integration of afferent, efferent, and homeo-
static information. Just integrating information is not sufficient for
subjective experience, no matter how complex or well-integrated
the information. Information integration theorists have also tended
to take a more liberal and graded view of consciousness, sug-
gesting that even simple circuits such as a photodiode attached to
memory might have a “modicum of experience” (65). By contrast,
our theory implies that there is a definite cutoff point below which
there is definitely not subjective experience (a point to which we
will return).
Unified modeling provides effective solutions to the reaffer-
ence problem and action selection for motile animals with de-
veloped spatially coherent senses (such as vision) (9, 66, 67). As
such, it is not surprising that the vertebrate midbrain behavioral
core control system evolved early on in the group and has been
largely conserved since. Lampreys (primitive jawless fish) have
functional homologs of all of the key nuclei involved in the ver-
tebrate behavioral core control system (sensu ref. 8) including a
well-developed tectum to process spatially structured visual in-
formation (68, 69) and equivalents of the basal ganglia system to
resolve action and target selection (67, 70). It is thus a commit-
ment of our model that subjective experience is likely to be uni-
versal among the vertebrates. What about invertebrate groups?
Consciousness in Insects
The insects are an extremely diverse group, but all insect brains
have a common anatomical plan (Fig. 2). The nervous system
contains an enlarged cephalic ganglion (a brain) specialized for
sensory processing and integration. This is linked by paired ven-
tral nerve cords to a series of smaller ganglia for the thoracic and
abdominal body segments. The insect nervous system has fre-
quently been stereotyped as decentralized (71), with the cephalic
ganglion acting simply as a region of sensory input that triggers
motor responses organized by the segmental ganglia (8, 71).
This interpretation is incorrect and outdated. The insect brain
resolves action and target selection, processes sensory infor-
mation, and clearly executes a command function over the be-
havioral system (72).
A compelling demonstration of the command function of the
insect brain for the total behavioral system of the insect is the
effect of focused injection of neurotransmitter agonists and an-
tagonists to the region of the central complex (CX) of the insect
brain. The parasitoid jewel wasp Ampulex compressa uses its
ovipositor to inject venom containing GABA and octopamine
antagonists into the CX of its cockroach prey (72, 73). The venom
is not paralytic: the cockroach is still able to perform many basic
actions. Rather, the pharmacological lesion to the central proto-
cerebrum containing the CX disrupts the cockroach’s behavioral
program, rendering it entirely passive so that it will not struggle as
the wasp leads the cockroach by the antennae into its burrow. The
effect of Ampulex venom on the cockroach brain is thus to elim-
inate the capacity of the roach to organize and initiate behavior
(73). This example shows that the central brain structures are key
for the initiation and direction of movement in cockroaches and
crickets (74, 75).
Further, the CX of the insect brain seems specialized for the
processing of spatial information and organization of movement
(76). As such (we argue), it performs functions analogous to the
vertebrate tectum/colliculus (Fig. 2). Like the vertebrate tectum/
colliculus, the CX plays a crucial role in processing multiple
sources of spatial information drawn from different senses. Many
insects are sensitive to plane-polarized light, a vital celestial nav-
igational cue. In locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) information on the
distribution of polarized light in the sky is processed by the CX,
which creates a central polarotopic representation of the sky po-
larization pattern (77). Outputs from this system could provide
Barron and Klein

 compass-like information to stabilize the direction of moving in-
sects relative to the external celestial cue (78). This function for the
CX has been described in locusts and butterflies (Danaus plex-
ippus) but may be common across insect orders (79). Further, in
S. gregaria (80), the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis (75), and Dro-
sophila melanogaster (81, 82), the CX encodes topographically
organized visual information on moving objects and is capable of
factoring out the confounding effects of visual motion generated
by self-movement from moving objects in the environment (82).
In Drosophila, neural activity within the CX encodes the fly’s heading
relative to visual landmarks in the environment and presumably
enables the fly to maintain a course relative to those landmarks (83).
The CX is also vital for flies to learn spatial tasks (84, 85).
Collectively these studies emphasize the capacity of the insect
CX to represent visual space such that the insect can orient and
navigate. However, the CX processes more than just visual in-
formation. In cockroaches (86), Drosophila (83), and crickets (74),
the CX also encodes topographically organized mechanosensory
and proprioceptive information, corrected for reafference, to re-
solve the movements and orientation of the body and limbs in
space. The CX is necessary for producing actions that involve
coordination of limbs on both sides of the body (such as turning),
and also for judging distance in targeting and reaching (87). The
various topographically organized sensory maps are layered in
Drosophila (79), and it would seem the sensory maps are in-
tegrated because the encoding of azimuth in the Drosophila CX
can switch seamlessly between a reliance on visual landmarks in
the light to a reliance on proprioceptive cues in the dark (83).
New electrophysiological studies of the visual interneurons of
the lobula of the Drosophila brain have shown how a flying fly can
resolve the reafference problem (88). Visual interneurons that
register optic flow in the visual field receive a motor-related input
when the fly turns, which precisely counters the visual stimulation
of the neurons caused by the turn (88). The electrophysiological
data support von Holst and Mittelstaedt’s (43) classic theory, and
inferences from insect behavioral studies (89–91), that an “effer-
ence copy” of a motor action is sent to the visual system to silence
the specific image motion caused by a voluntary turn. The motor-
related input to the lobula is specific and anticipatory of the motor
action, cautiously supporting a forward model of action selection
(where modeling of the movement and its consequences pre-
cedes the movement itself) (88, 92). Although we still do not know
how the efference copy to the lobula is generated, it seems in-
creasingly likely that CX circuits are involved.
One of the crucial functions of the CX is thus to generate a
neural simulation of the state of the moving insect in space. This
simulation forms part of the insect behavioral core control system
(Fig. 2). The CX outputs to, and receives input from, the proto-
cerebrum (P) of the insect brain, especially the lateral accessory
lobe which is a point of convergence for sensory information.
These include both direct inputs from the sensory lobes and in-
direct inputs via the CX and mushroom body (MB) pathways (Fig.
2), which are a locus for memory of past experience. The P is
premotor, and emerging evidence suggests that competitive
processing within structures of the P contributes to effective ac-
tion selection based on all available sensory information (93–96).
In sum, new functional analyses of the insect brain emphasize
how it supports a behavioral core control system that is func-
tionally analogous to that of the vertebrate midbrain (Fig. 2). This
no doubt supports much of the dynamic and flexible behavior for
which some insects are famous. Some of the central-place for-
aging ants and bees have remarkable navigational skills and
spatial memory and are clearly able to organize their behavior
with respect to more than simply their immediate sensory envi-
ronment. They will perform targeted searches in appropriate lo-
cations and at appropriate times (97) for resources they have
experienced previously. Several insect species have been shown
to be able to plot novel routes based on learned landmarks and
goals, evidencing a spatial relation of landmark information (98,
99). The honey bee dance communication system requires a
dance follower to determine a flight vector relative to celestial
cues from symbolic and stereotyped dance movements (100).
All these behaviors require a form of neural modeling of space.
There is now both behavioral and electrophysiological evidence
that the neural modeling of the environment performed by insects
involves multiple layers of filtering of sensory information to
support selective attention to stimuli that are salient and sup-
pression of representation of irrelevant stimuli (101–104). The
amount and amplitude of firing activity within certain defined
frequency bands in the central brain of tethered flies in response
to visual stimuli is dependent on whether the fly is visually fixed on
the stimulus or whether the context of the stimulus has changed
(101). This change in neural activity has been described as a neural
signature of “salience” in insects (101, 102). The brain region in
which this occurs includes the point of interaction between the
MB, CX, and P circuits, and the electrophysiological response is
dependent on a functioning MB (101, 102).
These findings show how the brain responses to environmental
stimuli in insects are not driven simply by the primary sensory
input, but rather by egocentric characteristics: whether the con-
text of the stimulus needs to be updated or whether the stimulus
is a point of immediate navigational reference (101, 102). In es-
sence, responses depend upon what the insect is attending to at
that moment (104). In bees, even activity in the optic lobes is
influenced by centrifugal input from the central brain to enhance
Fig. 2. Basic functional anatomy of the insect brain (not to scale). The
structures of the insect brain create an integrated neural model of the
state of the insect in space that is functionally analogous to that
described for the vertebrate brain in Fig. 1. Regions are colored to
reflect the major functions described in Fig. 1A. Vision and smell are
primarily processed by dedicated sensory lobes, which function to
refine and enhance sensory representations and enhance distinctions
between similar stimuli (95, 141). Primary odor processing is
performed in the antennal lobes (AL). Visual processing is performed
by the lamina (LA), medulla (ME), and lobula (LO). The MB supports
learning and memory (142–146). The CX is anatomically variable
between insect orders but typically is composed of the central body
upper (CBU), central body lower (CBL), and noduli (NO). It has several
specializations for processing spatial information corrected for self
movement (75, 76, 83, 87). The protocerebrum (P) is an anatomically
complicated region. Modulatory and inhibitory connections to and
within the protocerebrum convey information on physiological state
(94, 95), and structures within the protocerebrum, particularly the
lateral accessory lobe, are involved in integration of information,
hence the hatched shading.

 neural responses to stimuli that are points of visual fixation (103).
These exciting new electrophysiological studies demonstrate
more compellingly than behavioral studies alone the subjective
and egocentric nature of the neural representation of the envi-
ronment in insects, and their capacity for selective attention
supports our assertion that insects have a capacity for subjective
experience. We note that the relationship between subjective
experience and selective attention in humans remains a topic of
considerable debate (105, 106). Whether selective attention is a
prerequisite for consciousness (105) or whether consciousness is
broader than what we attend to (106) is quite contentious. Be-
cause insects clearly have a capacity for selective attention we
may safely sidestep this debate for now. However, insect brains
could provide powerful experimental systems for future explora-
tion of the relationship between attention and experience in
simple animals.
The honey bee particularly is held up as an insect with cogni-
tive capacities that rival those of many mammals (107–109).
Without consideration of the underlying mechanisms, this may
seem like no more than a curiosity. The systems that underlie
these abilities were shaped by evolutionary pressures similar to
those that shaped the mammalian midbrain. The insect brain
does a similar sort of modeling, for the same reasons, in a similar
way. That is strong evidence that the insect brain has the capacity
to support subjective experience.
Beyond Insects
Our thesis raises two related questions. First, how widespread is
subjective experience among the other invertebrates? Second,
when did a capacity for subjective experience arise?
To the question of how widespread subjective experience is
among the invertebrates, we answer that it is likely to be more ex-
tensive than previously thought, but far from universal. One of the
virtues of the account we have endorsed is that it also gives an
evidence-based argument for where to draw the line between the
haves and have-nots. There are other, simpler ways to organize
animal behavior than by creating the kind of integrated neural
simulation seen in the insect and vertebrate core control systems.
These simpler systems cannot support a capacity for subjective
experience.
An informative, if simple, example is the cubozoan box jellyfish
Tripedalia cystophora. This species shows dynamic behavior that
includes actively hunting its prey. It has a well-developed geo-
sense and visual sense thanks to 24 lensed eyes distributed
around the body (110, 111), yet the nervous system is entirely
decentralized. Sense organs independently modulate activity in
regions of the sensory net and muscle walls to steer the animal
(112). The outcome of local sensory input acting on local muscle
activity is an adaptive change in the swimming direction and
speed of the animal (112), but the simple behavioral control sys-
tem is entirely decentralized. Although such systems manifest the
appearance of adaptive and dynamic targeting, they are nothing
more than simple decentralized stimulus–response systems. They
could not reasonably be expected to support any form of
subjective experience.
Centralization is necessary for subjective experience, but it is
not sufficient. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a
famously simple and well-characterized centralized nervous sys-
tem that can integrate input from an array of thermo-, mechano-,
chemo-, and nociceptors, along with an interoceptive sense of
time to organize directed movements (113). Sensory inputs are
integrated at the level of an array of interneurons that compete for
activation of the motor neurons (113). The simple nervous system
of C. elegans can also support various forms of learning such as
habituation (114–116) and classical associative conditioning (116–
118), enabling adaptive change in behavior with experience.
Nematodes are thus able to integrate multiple forms of sen-
sory input using a centralized nervous system, but it seems that
their behavior is organized as responses either to the immediate
sensory environment or to immediate interoceptive signals of
physiological state. Action selection in nematodes is driven by
shifts in global brain dynamics (119), and there is sufficient plas-
ticity in the nematode nervous system for their responses to vary
with system state (120). However, there is no evidence that
nematodes can actively hunt for things beyond their immediate
sensory environment. Hungry nematodes respond to starvation
with increased locomotion and dispersal in a random, rather than
directed, search (121, 122). By contrast, hungry rodents, ants, and
bees will navigate to places where they have previously encoun-
tered food. Their internal state of hunger triggers a highly di-
rectional and oriented food search focused on locations where
food was previously experienced, even if no food stimuli are
currently present (123–125). Hence, in mammals and insects ho-
meostatic drives direct behavior to where resources are expected
to be, even if they are not currently there. We argue the difference
between this behavior and nematode search behavior arises be-
cause nematode behavior is organized by reference to their pri-
mary sensory input, whereas rodent and insect behavior is
organized in response to an integrated and spatial simulation of
their environment. Nematodes do possess forms of memory (116)
that can change how they react to stimuli (120), but there is no
evidence this memory has a spatial component or contributes to a
structured model of their environment.
Consequently, even though nematodes have a centralized
nervous system and memory, they lack the egocentric modeling
of the environment that is required for subjective experience.
Further, it is because they lack the capacity to make such models
that they are unable to do a variety of tasks that vertebrates and
insects handle with ease. As a group, nematodes may have
evolved a simplified body plan and nervous system as a conse-
quence of evolving to exploit very stable environments or a par-
asitic existence (126, 127). In such environments, very simple
behavioral control systems are sufficient.
If the insect brain supports subjective experience, then this not
only increases the diversity of animals considered to have these
abilities—it also requires a reconsideration of when this ability
might have appeared on Earth. As noted above, the key struc-
tural elements of the vertebrate behavioral core control system
are all present and functional in lampreys (128). If these struc-
tures are present in the basal vertebrates then they may also
have been present in the basal vertebrate species Haikouichthys
identified in Cambrian fossil fauna (128). This species had well-
developed eyes and a hydrodynamic eel-like body (129). It is
reconstructed as an active swimmer (129) and presumably had a
version of an operational behavioral core control system for the
organization of dynamic and active movement, action selection,
and target selection (128).
The insect behavioral core control system is likely to be simi-
larly ancient. Cambrian fossil faunas are famous for their arthropod
diversity, many of which had complex jointed limbs and bodies,
sensory appendages, and well-developed image-forming com-
pound eyes (130–133). These have been reconstructed as hav-
ing active lifestyles, and arthropods were the top predators of
the period (130–133). At least some of these arthropods had
Barron and Klein

 well-developed cephalic ganglia with structural similarities to
extant crustacean and insect brains (134). We argue it is likely that
a version of the extant insect behavioral core control system must
have been present in at least some Cambrian arthropods to
support their active foraging and hunting lifestyles. The CX is
basal to the insect clade. Although there is some variation in the
structure of the CX between insect orders, this structure features
in all insects and crustaceans and is likely homologous to the ar-
cuate body of arachnids (87, 135, 136), suggesting a form of the
CX evolved before the radiation of insects, crustaceans, and spi-
ders. Trestman (130) has argued that the spatial awareness and
agentive behavior enabled by arthropod neural and sensory sys-
tems may have contributed to the arthropod radiation in the
Cambrian as a consequence of the emergence of new forms of
behavior such as hunting. It is plausible that some of the Cambrian
fauna within both the basal vertebrate and arthropod groups had
a capacity for subjective experience.
It is presently unclear whether the insect and vertebrate be-
havioral core control systems evolved independently. Strausfeld
and Hirth (137) marshal commanding developmental, anatomical,
and genetic evidence to argue a possible deep homology of the
insect CX and associated structures with vertebrate basal ganglia
structures. If this interpretation is correct, it would imply that a
brain with a form of higher sensory integration center may even
predate the divergence of these groups.
Moving Forward on Invertebrate Consciousness
We have argued that insects possess a capacity for subjective
experience. Many find this a counterintuitive result. A natural
place to take issue with our argument is with our reliance on
Merker’s proposal that the midbrain is sufficient to support sub-
jective experience. Fair enough. Merker’s theory is far from
universally accepted, and even otherwise similar theories may not
(for all we have said) generalize to invertebrates. With Merker, we
have emphasized the importance of a unified perspective on the
world as a key feature of subjective experience (14). However,
perhaps other neural features are also necessary for subjective
experience, such as a representation of a temporal dimension
(138). Perhaps insects lack these (though see ref. 139).
However, this kind of disagreement can be fruitful. If insects
do not have subjective experience, why not?
What is important, from our perspective, is that either pro-
posing or denying that insects have subjective experience should
require telling an evidence-based structural, functional, and
comparative story about the insect brain. We have downplayed
behavioral data. Critically, we have not relied on evidence of
unusual or clever achievements by insects. Rather, we suggest,
behavior is important only insofar as it is a guide to understanding
the underlying mechanisms by which behavior is generated.
We propose that arguing about what subjective experience is,
and what is capable of it, is most productive when appealing to
empirical neuroscience. We believe that it is on these structural,
functional, and comparative grounds that questions about sub-
jective experience—of insects or of any other animal—ought to
be settled.
