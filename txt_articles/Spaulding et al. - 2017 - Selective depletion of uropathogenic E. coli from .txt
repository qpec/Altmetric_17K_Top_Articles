 Urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) affect 150 million people 
annually1,2. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, 30–50% of patients experience recurrent UTI 
(rUTI)1. Additionally, the growing prevelance of UPEC resistant to last-line antibiotic treatments, 
and more recently carbapenems and colistin, make UTIs a prime example of the antibiotic-
resistance crisis and emphasize the need for new approaches to treat and prevent bacterial 
infections3–5. UPEC strains establish reservoirs in the gut from which they are shed in the feces, 
can colonize the peri-urethral area or vagina and subsequently ascend through the urethra to the 
urinary tract, where they cause UTI6. UPEC isolates encode up to 16 distinct chaperone-usher 
pathway (CUP) pili and each pilus type likely enables colonization of a habitat in the host or 
environment7. For example, the type 1 pilus adhesin, FimH, binds mannose on the bladder surface, 
mediating bladder colonization. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying 
UPEC persistence in the gut5. Using a mouse model, we found that F17-like and type 1 pili 
promote intestinal colonization and show distinct binding to epithelial cells distributed along 
colonic crypts. Phylogenomic and structural analyses reveal that F17-like pili are closely related to 
pilus types carried by intestinal pathogens, but are restricted to extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. 
Moreover, we show that targeting FimH with a high-affinity inhibitor, mannoside M4284, reduces 
intestinal colonization of genetically diverse UPEC isolates, while simultaneously treating UTI, 
without significantly disrupting the the structural configuration of the gut microbiota. By 
selectively depleting the intestinal UPEC reservoir, mannosides could significantly reduce the rate 
of UTI and rUTI.
Main Text
The genome of UTI89, a human cystitis isolate, contains 9 distinct functional CUP pili. To 
determine whether any of these CUP pili promote intestinal colonization, we used a 
streptomycin mouse model of UPEC intestinal colonization8 to co-colonize C3H/HeN mice 
with wildtype (WT) UTI89 and one of 9 mutant strains, each lacking a single CUP operon 
(Extended Data Fig. 1). Deletion of 7 operons yfc, yeh, yad, pap, sfa, yqi, and mat had no 
effect on UTI89 intestinal fitness compared to the isogenic WT strain (Fig. 1a–g). However, 
deletion of the fim or ucl pilus operons, which encode type 1 and F17-like pili, respectively, 
produced significant colonization defects (up to 100- and 1000-fold, respectively; Fig. 1h,i). 
Loss of FimH, the type 1 pilus adhesin, mirrored the defect caused by deletion of the full 
type 1 pilus operon (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Deletion of both pilus types in a single strain 
produced a fitness defect greater than either individual deletion alone, suggesting that these 
two pilus types do not have redundant roles (Fig. 1j,k).
In a mouse model, type 1 pilus mediated binding to mannosylated receptors is indispensible 
for bladder colonization and invasion of urothelial cells lining the bladder lumen2,5. Once 
inside urothelial cells, a single bacterium rapidly divides, forming an intracellular bacterial 
community (IBC)2,5. Further, UPEC can access underlying transitional cells, forming 
quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs)2,5. Mutations in fimH abolish the ability of UPEC 
to colonize the bladder, form IBCs and QIRs2,5,9. In contrast, no role was observed for F17-
like pili in the rate or severity of bladder infection in individual or concurrent transurethral 
inoculations of UTI89 and UTI89Δucl strains into the bladders of female C3H/HeN mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 3). Differences between mouse and human bladders or the over-

 expression of F17-like pili in vitro may account for the variance with another study that 
showed a role for F17-like pili in binding to desquamated epithelial cells harvested from 
human urine10.
The fim and ucl operons encode two-domain tip adhesin proteins, FimH and UclD, 
respectively. The adhesin lectin domain contains the ligand binding site, while the pilin 
domain joins the adhesin to the pilus rod5. Purified FimH lectin domain (FimHLD) bound to 
more differentiated epithelial cells located in the upper portion of crypts and in ‘surface 
epithelial cuffs’ (the colonic homologs of small intestinal villi) (Fig. 1l). FimH binding was 
prevented by pretreating tissue sections with PNGase, which cleaves N-linked 
oligosaccharides. FimHLD also bound to Caco-2 cells (an immortalized human enterocyte-
like cell line derived from colorectal carcinoma); binding was inhibited by D-mannose and a 
high affinity mannose-analog (mannoside), M428411 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The UclD 
lectin domain, UclDLD, also bound colonic epithelial cells in tissue sections; binding was 
inhibited by pretreating tissue sections with O-glycosidase, an enzyme that cleaves O-linked 
oligosaccharides, suggesting that the UclD ligand is contained within an O-glycan (Fig. 1m).
CUP pili are highly conserved throughout Proteobacteria and are assembled by dedicated 
chaperone-usher assembly machines encoded by each respective CUP operon along with the 
various subunit types comprising the pilus fiber5,7. The sequence identity between usher 
genes of distinct CUP pilus types is greater than the identity of genes that encode other CUP 
pilus proteins and thus can be compared to elucidate evolutionary relationships of CUP pili 
among Proteobacteria7,12. A homology search of a database of γ-Proteobacteria genomes 
revealed that the UTI89 F17-like usher gene sequence (uclC) shared highest identity with 
other E. coli uclC sequences and with orthologous usher sequences of P. mirabilis, a 
bacterium that can colonize the gut, and S. enterica, an intestinal pathogen (Supplementary 
Table 1). The uclC usher gene was also closely related to usher genes in F17 (thus the 
derivation of the name, F17-like), pVir99 and ECs1278 pili. A phylogenetic analysis showed 
clustering of these E. coli and Proteus species’ ushers into a distinct sub-branch within the 
broader F17 group usher phylogeny, suggesting that they share a common ancestor 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). F17-like pili are present in only 10% of E. coli strains; these strains 
are almost exclusively in the B2 clade, which harbors the majority of extraintestinal 
pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and UPEC strains10,13. In contrast, F17 and ECs1278 pili are 
found in the intestinal pathogens, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. 
coli (EHEC), respectively, which are specific to clades A, E, and B114,15. These findings 
suggest that UPEC strains in clade B2 may have acquired the ucl operon from a different 
species and retained this factor to facilitate its residency in the gut. No binding of UclDLD 
was observed to GlcNAc, the ligand bound by F17 pili, indicating that F17-like pili bind a 
ligand distinct from that of F17 pili (Fig. 1n)16. Interestingly, although the amino acid 
sequence of the full length UclD adhesin has diverged from that of the F17 adhesin, F17G, it 
is virtually invariant across all strains encoding it (>99%), suggesting that there is a single, 
distinct ligand for UclD adhesins10.
A comparative genomic analysis of 43 strains isolated from a cohort of 14 women at the 
time of initial presentation with acute UTI, or during subsequent recurrent UTIs revealed 
that fourteen of the rUTI events were caused by B2 strains (Supplementary Table 2)17,18. Of

 these 14 strains, 13 encoded F17-like pili (~93%) (Extended Data Fig. 5). In contrast, F17-
like pili have been found in less than 50% of all B2 strains10 (E. coli reference collection 
(ECOR)), suggesting that F17-like pili might be associated with UPEC persistence in 
women with rUTI due to their ability to promote maintenance of a UPEC intestinal 
reservoir.
To further characterize F17-like pili, we solved two X-ray crystal structures of UclDLD. The 
structures in the P21 (green) and P212121 (gray) space groups were resolved to 1.05 Å and 
1.6 Å resolution, respectively, and are nearly identical (Fig. 2a-1; Supplementary Table 3). 
Despite low primary sequence identity (~25%), the structural characteristics of UclDLD and 
the F17 adhesin, F17GLD are conserved (Fig. 2a–c)16. This includes the presence of a 
transverse putative binding site in UclDLD located at a similar position to the GlcNAc 
binding site on F17G (Fig. 2a–3, b, c)16. Structural and sequence alignments reveal two 
large conserved insertions in UclD relative to F17G (Fig. 2c), whose direct proximity to the 
putative binding pocket suggests that they are involved in UclD receptor binding. The six 
conserved residues that make up the candidate binding pocket in UclD are chemically 
distinct to their F17G counterparts (Fig. 2b,c), providing further evidence that UclD binds a 
distinct ligand.
In light of the role of FimH and UclD in gut colonization, we conducted a study designed to 
reduce the UPEC intestinal reservoir with an adhesin-directed therapeutic. M4284 is a high-
affinity biphenyl mannoside whose binding affinity for FimH is ~100,000-fold higher than 
the natural sugar, D-mannose11,19. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis revealed that M4284 
concentrations remain high in the feces of mice for up to 8 h after an oral dose (Fig. 3a). 
Treating mice that were colonized by UTI89 with 3 doses (administered by oral gavage) of 
M4284, a regimen that successfully treats UPEC UTI in mice20, significantly reduced 
UTI89 levels in feces, cecum, and colon compared to those treated with a vehicle control 
(Fig. 3b,c). Treating mice with additonal M4284 doses further reduced the UTI89 population 
and the overall number of UPEC continued to be lower in M4284-treated mice after 
termination of treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6). While D-mannose blocks FimH binding in 
vitro, treating mice with D-mannose did not alter UTI89 levels in vivo (Exended Data Fig. 
2b, Fig. 3d).
The ID50 in the UTI mouse model is 105 CFU21. Furthermore, decreasing the dose of UPEC 
introduced into the bladder from 108 to 106 CFU significantly reduced the rate of UTI, 
suggesting that the 1–1.5 log (or 90–95%) mannoside-driven reduction in fecal UPEC levels 
would reduce the numbers of bacteria available to access the urinary tract and likely reduce 
the rate of UTI and/or rUTI (Extended Data Fig. 7). Indeed, we found that M4284 
simultaneously reduces UTI89 levels in the gut and urinary tracts of mice that were 
concurrently colonized with UTI89 in the gut and bladder (Fig. 3e–g).
We sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons generated from fecal samples of 
C3H/HeN mice that had not been given streptomycin or infected with UPEC but were 
treated with 3 doses of M4284 or vehicle alone. We found that M4284 produced no 
significant changes in the overall phylogenetic configuration of the microbiota as judged by 
the unweighted UniFrac dissimilarity metric, in contrast to the significant perturbations

 produced by treatment with ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (Fig. 4a, Extended 
Data Fig. 8a). Using this UniFrac metric, we found that M4284 treatment did not produce 
significant perturbations in bacterial community structure in mice pretreated with 
streptomycin and then colonized with UTI89 (Extended Data Fig. 9). We concluded that 
M4284 can function to selectively extirpate UPEC from the gut in our preclinical model. 
Interestingly, while most Enterobacteriaceae carry the fim operon7,18,22, M4284 treatment 
does not significantly affect the abundance of intestinal Enterobacteriaceae (Extended Data 
Figure 8a,b), suggesting that these bacteria may not be expressing type 1 pili during M4284 
exposure or that they reside within inaccessible intestinal habitats.
M4284 treatment of mice colonized with three additional genetically diverse UPEC clinical 
isolates (EC95823, 41.4p18 and CFT07324), reduced the levels of each UPEC strain by a 
similar percentage in the feces, cecum, and colon (Fig. 4b–f, Extended Data Fig. 10a). 
Furthermore, we found that M4284 treatment reduced UTI89 levels in C3H/HeN and 
C57BL/6 mice from different vendors, harboring distinct gut microbial communities. In 
each case tested, the percentage reduction in UPEC levels in cecum, colon and feces did not 
vary significantly between the different treatment groups (Fig. 4f–h, Extended Data Figs. 8c,
10b). We concluded that M4284 treatment has activity against different UPEC strains in 
different host genetic backgrounds and gut microbial community contexts.
Prospectus
As the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens continues to rise, the need to develop 
highly targeted/specific therapeutic approaches has gained increased urgency25,26. 
Additionally, an increasing number of studies are finding that disruption of the gut 
microbiota by orally administered antibiotics, especially during childhood, may affect its 
functional properties in ways that are deleterious to the host, not only in the short term but 
for more protracted periods of time27,28. Therefore, developing therapeutic agents, like 
mannosides, that specifically target a pathogen without disrupting the remainder of a 
microbial community has important ramifications not only for UPEC but potentially for 
other infections, including those caused by enteropathogens. In addition, identification of 
genes involved in UPEC intestinal colonization may also provide a method by which UTI 
patients could be stratified for epidemiologic studies of risk for recurrent disease as well as 
for proof-of-concept clinical studies of the efficacy of CUP-directed treatment regimens.

 Bacterial strains
CUP operon and adhesin deletions in UTI89 were engineered by replacing the gene(s) of 
interest with antibiotic-resistance markers using the λ Red Recombinase system30. Earlier 
reports described WT UTI89 and its isogenic fim and fimH mutants21,31 as well as EC95823, 
41.4p18 and CFT07324.
Colonization of mice with UPEC strains
6-week old female C3H/HeN mice were obtained from Envigo or Charles Rivers Labs 
(CRL). 6-week old female C57BL/6 mice were also obtained from Envigo. Animals were 
maintained in a single room in our vivarium for no more than 2 days prior to treatment. Prior 
to and after treatment all animals received PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 (Purina) ad libitum. All 
animals were maintained under a strict light cycle (lights on at 0600h, off at 1800h). For 
competitive infections, if a phenotype was observed after testing five mice (1 biological 
replicate), the experiment was repeated 1–2 times (total of n=10–16 mice, 2–3 biological 
replicates). For 16S rRNA analyses, 4–5 mice were examined (1 biological replicate). For all 
other experiments, 9–16 mice were tested and the experiment was repeated 2–3 times (2–3 
biological replicates). Exclusion criteria for mice were pre-established; (i) both introduced 
strains in competitive infections became undetectable during the course of a 14 day 
experiment, and (ii) mice died or lost > 20% of their body weight. No mice in this study met 
these criteria. Mice were acquired from indicated vendors and randomly placed into cages 
(n=5 mice/cage) by employees of Washington University’s Division of Comparative 
Medicine (DCM); no additional methods for randomization were used to determine how 
animals were allocated to experimental groups. Investigators were not blinded to group 
allocation during experiments.
Animals received a single dose of streptomycin (1000mg/kg in 100 μL water by oral gavage 
(PO)) followed 24 h later by an oral gavage of ∼108 CFU UPEC in 100 μl phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS). Bladder infections were performed via transurethral inoculation32. 
UPEC strains were prepared for inoculation as described previously32. Briefly, a single 
UTI89 colony was inoculated in 20 mL of Luria Broth (LB) and incubated at 37°C under 
static conditions for 24 h. Bacteria were then diluted (1:1000) into fresh LB and incubated at 
37°C under static conditions for 18–24 h. Bacteria were subsequently washed three times 
with PBS and then concentrated to ~1×108 CFU per 100 μL for intestinal infections and 
~1×108 CFU per 50 μL for bladder infections.
In all cases, fecal and urine samples were collected directly from each animal at the 
indicated time points. Fecal samples were immediately weighed and homogenized in 1 mL 
PBS. Urine samples were immediately diluted 1:10 prior to plating. Mice were sacrificed via 
cervical dislocation under isofluorane anesthesia and their organs were removed and 
processed under aseptic conditions. Intestinal segments (cecum and colon) were weighed 
prior to homogenization and plating on LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.
Enumeration of bladder intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs)
6 week old C3H/HeN mice were given a single oral dose of either M4284 (100mg/kg) or 
vehicle control (10% cyclodextrin) 30 min before transurethral inoculation with UTI89. To

 accurately count the number of IBCs, mice were sacrified 6 hours after infection. Bladders 
were removed aseptically, bi-sected, splayed on silicone plates and fixed in 4% (v/v) 
paraformaldehyde. IBCs, readily discernable as punctate violet spots, were quantified by 
LacZ staining of bladder wholemounts20,33.
Immunofluorescence Studies
The protocols used for immunohistochemical analysis are based on a previous study34. 
Following sacrifice of 6 week old, female C57BL/6 mice (supplied by VIB-Ghent 
University breeding program, Belgium), segments of colon were fixed in methanol-Carnoy 
for a minimum of 3 hours at room temperature. The fixed tissues were then embedded in 
paraffin and 4-μm-thick sections were cut and placed on glass slides. Slides were de-
paraffinized and re-hydrated by incubating them in xylene, isopropanol, 100% ethanol and 
finally 70% ethanol (each step involving a 3 min incubation in the reagent followed by 
another 3 min incubation in fresh reagent). Slides were subsequently rinsed in tap water and 
PBS, placed in blocking buffer (5% fecal calf serum prepared in PBS) at room temperature 
for 30 min, and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Muc2 [1/2000; Mucin 2 
(H-300), Santa Cruz Biotechnology] for 2 h. After three washes with PBS, slides were 
incubated with a goat anti-rabbit Dylight-488 labeled secondary antibody (1/1000 dilution, 
ThermoFisher Cat No. 35553) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were 
washed three times with PBS before counterstaining with bis-benzimide (Hoechst dye) 
(1/1000 in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, slides were incubated with 
FimHLD or UclDLD (P21) protein, labeled with NHS 650nm Dylight, in blocking buffer at 
4°C overnight. Prior to staining, sections were treated with O-glycosidase (NEB) or 
PNGaseF (SIGMA) at 37°C using buffers and protocols supplied by manufacturer. Slides 
were washed subsequently with PBS before treatment with fluoro mounting medium (n-
propyl gallate in glycerol) and viewing under a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems 
LAS-AF-TCS SP5) using a 20×125 objective.
Mannoside Treatment
D-mannose or the mannoside M4284 (which has been characterized in a prior published 
study11), were diluted in vehicle (water and 10% cyclodextrin, respectively) and 
administered to 6 week old C3H/HeN mice at a dose of 100mg/kg. Control animals were 
treated with water or 10% cyclodextrin alone. Unless stated otherwise, three doses of 
M4284, cyclodextrin, or D-mannose were given via oral gavage over 24 hours, with doses 
administered 8 h apart. Mice were sacrificed and intestinal tissues were processed for 
analysis of viable bacteria (CFU) 8 h after the last dose, unless otherwise noted. To test the 
effect of M4284 on intestinal UPEC titers after treatment was terminated, mice were 
sacrificed 5 days after the last dose of mannoside. To test the effect of additional doses on 
M4284 treatment on UPEC titers, mice were given 5 doses of mannoside; the first 3 doses 
were administered 8 h apart, followed 12h later by the 4th dose, and 24h later by the 5th 
dose. Mice were sacrificed 24h after the 5th dose.
Carriage of F17-like pili
We examined 43 available UPEC isolates (Supplementary table 2). These isolates originated 
from a clinical study of 14 women who experienced at least two episodes of UTI (an initial

 UTI and one or more rUTI) during the 90 day study window17. The isolates used in this 
work were sequenced in a previous study18 (Bioproject ID: PRJNA269984) and include (i) 
14 isolates collected at enrollment, (ii) 18 isolates collected during rUTI (10 women 
experienced a single rUTI while four women experienced two rUTI events), and (iii) 11 
isolates collected in the days leading up to an rUTI.
The distribution of the F17-like operon in these clinical E. coli isolates was determined 
using BLAST and the F17-like operon from UTI89 as the query sequence. A “hit” was 
considered as any genome sequence that matched the entire length of the query sequence 
with >75% identity. As a control to prevent false negatives in the BLAST search of draft 
genomes, DNA sequencing reads from each clinical UPEC isolate were mapped against a 
reference sequence constructed by concatenating all the ucl genes with 100 N’s separators 
using Geneious v6.1.735.
Phylogenetic Analyses and Sequence Alignments
Amino acid alignments of full-length UTI89 UclD, P. mirabilis UcaD, S. enterica UclH, and 
ETEC F17G were conducted using the MAFFT L-INS-i iterative refinement method and the 
default BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (Supplementary table 1)36. MAFFT collected up to 100 
homologs with E values of less than 1e-10 to each sequence from the SwissProt database to 
improve alignment accuracy. Homologs are automatically removed from the final alignment. 
The alignment was visualized using Geneious35. A homology search of the coding sequence 
database of the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) was conducted using the Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)37 using the UTI89 uclC (ENA accession: ABE10308) and 
EDL933 ECs1278 (ENA accession: AIG67653) as queries. Sequences that matched either 
gene sequence with >50% identity were downloaded and then filtered to remove partial hits 
(<80% length of query sequence) and sequences with nonsense mutations, which resulted in 
a total of 659 sequences (Supplementary table 1). Duplicate sequences were then removed, 
resulting in a list of 122 unique, representative sequences. These sequences were then 
aligned with the UTI89 fimD usher sequence (ENA accession: ABE10417) as an outgroup 
using the MAFFT MAFFT L-INS-i alignment method and the 200PAM scoring matrix36: 
The phylogenetic relationship between gene sequences was then estimated using RAxML 
v8.1.3 with the GTRCAT model and supported with 1000 bootstrap replicates; the tree was 
visualized using the tool interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) v338.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting FimH
Caco-2 cells (ATCC Number HTB-37) were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) 
supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell cultures tested negative for 
mycoplasma. Cells were split into 48-well plates, grown to 100% confluence and then fixed 
with paraformeldahyde for 15 min followed by treatment with blocking buffer (1x PBS 
containing 2% BSA) for 2h. A truncated FimH, corresponding to residues 1–178 of the 
mature FimH adhesin (FimHLD), expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously39, 
was serially diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the fixed CaCo-2 cells for 1h at 
room temperature. To test the effect of D-mannose or M4284 on FimH binding, 0.2 mg/mL 
FimHLD was pre-incubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 mM D-mannose 
(Sigma-Aldrich) or 1mM M4828 (in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 or 20 mM Tris plus water or 10%

 cyclodextrin, respectively) before serial dilution and incubation. Wells were washed four 
times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) prior to incubation with a polyclonal rabbit anti-T3 
antibody against FimHLD (generated against FimH residues 1–165; ref. 39) for one hour at 
room temperature. Following another series of four washes, secondary antibody (goat anti-
rabbit Ig conjugated to horse radish peroxidase; ThermoFisher, Catalog Number 32460) was 
incubated with the cells for 1 h at room temperature (24°C) before washing in PBST. Plates 
were developed with the BD OptEIA TMB substrate reagent kit for 5 min at room 
temperature (24°C) before quenching with 1 M H2SO4. Binding was assessed by measuring 
the absorbance at 450 nM on a TECAN infinite 2 PRO plate reader. Wells lacking protein 
were used as controld. All conditions were examined in quadruplicate.
Effect of antibiotic exposure on the microbiota
Six week old female C3H/HeN mice from Envigo and CRL were subjected to the following 
treatments: (i) none (naïve control mice, Untreated), (ii) three doses of M4284 (100mg/kg; 
in 10% cyclodextrin) or 10% cyclodextrin given 8 h apart, or (iii) ciprofloxacin (two doses 
of 15mg/kg given 12 h apart). All doses were given via oral gavage. Five mice were included 
for each treatment type (1 biological replicate) and fecal samples were collected prior to 
treatment and 24 hours after the last dose of each treatment. Another group of four 
C3H/HeN mice from Envigo (1 biological replicate) were pretreated with streptomycin and 
colonized with UTI89 before recieving treatment with either three doses of M4284 
(100mg/kg; in 10% cyclodextrin) or with 10% cyclodextrin alone; fecal samples were 
collected prior to treatment but after exposure to streptomycin and UTI89 and 24 hours after 
the last dose of each treatment.
Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing
DNA was extracted by bead beating in extraction buffer [200 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM 
NaCl, 20 mM EDTA], 210μL of 20% SDS and 500μL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 
(pH 7.9, 25:24:1). This crude DNA extract was purified (Qiaquick PCR purification kit) and 
PCR used to generate amplicons from the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes using 
primers and cycling conditions described previously40. Amplicons were pooled in equimolar 
ratios and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (paired end 250 nt reads). Paired 
V4-16S rRNA sequences were merged using FLASH software41, demultiplexed, and reads 
clustered into 97%ID OTUs (2013 Greengenes OTU reference database; QIIME version 
1.9.042). A custom database using modified NCBI bacterial taxonomy was used to train the 
Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) version 2.4 classifier and assign taxonomy to picked 
OTUs43. The resulting OTU table was filtered to include only OTUs found in at least two 
samples at greater than or equal to 0.1% relative abundance.
F17-Like Constructs and Purification
For the P21 UclDLD construct, the first 197 amino acids of the mature UclD adhesin protein 
were cloned into pDEST14 using Gateway® technology (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid 
pUclDAD. Expression was induced with 1mM IPTG. Periplasmic extracts were prepared by 
resuspending bacterial pellets in 20mM Tris/20% sucrose (pH 8) (4 ml/per gram of pellet). 
Subsequently, 40μl of 0.5M EDTA and 10mg/ml lysozyme were added per gram of pellet 
and the suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min. This step was followed by addition of

 40 μl of 2.5M MgCl2 per gram of cell pellet and incubation on ice for 5 min. Cells were 
spun at 15,000 × g and the supernatant was saved as the periplasmic extract. The extract 
containing the UclD lectin domain was dialyzed against 20mM HEPES pH 7, passed over a 
SP FF cation exchange column (GE) and bound material eluted with 20mM HEPES 
pH7/1M NaCl. Pooled fractions containing UclD lectin domain were then applied to a 
Phenyl Hi Trap column (GE) after addition of 1M ammonium sulfate. Elution was 
performed using 20mM HEPES pH 7.
To generate purified UclDLD for the P212121 space group, DNA from the UTI89 uclD gene 
encoding the N-terminal 217 amino acids of the protein were cloned into pTRC99a with a 
C-terminal 6-His tag. This construct was expressed in the periplasm of E. coli DL41(DE3), a 
methionine auxotroph strain suitable for expression of native or selenomethionine-labeled 
protein. Periplasmic extracts were first dialyzed against PBS supplemented with 250 mM 
NaCl, then bound to a Cobalt (Goldbio) column; bound proteins were eluted with PBS 
containing 250 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into 20 
mM MES (pH 5.8), bound to an HR16/10 Mono S cation exchange column (GE 
Healthcare), and eluted with 300 mM NaCl. Following cleavage of the periplasmic 
localization sequence, the mature form of UclDLD-6×His contained 203 amino acids.
Selenomethionine-labeled protein was purified using the same protocol, but all buffers were 
supplemented with 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM EDTA to prevent oxidation. EDTA 
was omitted from the periplasmic dialysis buffer to prevent chelation of immobilized cobalt.
Crystallization and Structure Determination
For the P21 UclDLD structure solved in the P21 space group, UclDLD (15mg/ml) was 
crystallized using sitting drop vapor diffusion against a solution containing 16% PEG 4000, 
0.1M Tris HCl pH 8.5, 0.2M magnesium chloride. UclD crystals were flash cooled to 100°K 
in a solution containing 16% PEG 4000, 0.1M Tris HCl pH 8.5, 0.2M magnesium chloride 
and 30% glycerol. Data were collected at beamline ID29 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) to 1.05 
Å resolution. Data were indexed and processed with XDS44, scaled and merged using 
SCALA in the CCP4 suite45. Data and refinement statistics can be found in Supplementary 
Table S3.
For the UclDLD structure solved in the P212121 space group, UclDLD (10 mg/ml 10 mM 
MES 5.8) was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against a well 
solution containing 0.1 M potassium phosphate (monobasic), 0.2 M potassium iodide and 
20% PEG 3350. One microliter of the protein solution was mixed with 1 μL well solution 
and incubated at 18 °C. Crystals were harvested and transferred to a solution containing 0.1 
M KH2PO4, 0.2 M KI and 20% PEG 3350 supplemented with 20% glycerol before being 
flash-frozen in a bath of liquid N2. Data were collected at beamline 4.2.2 (ALS Berkeley) to 
1.6 Å resolution. Data were indexed and processed with XDS44, scaled and merged 
AIMLESS in the CCP4 suite45 and phased with the Single anomalous dispersion (SAD) 
method using phenix.autosol, and refined with phenix.refine46. Data and refinement 
statistics can be found in Supplementary Table S3. RMSD values were calculating using the 
DALI server47. Structural alignments were performed in Promal’s 3D using the default 
settings. Secondary structure assignments for UclDLD were completed using DSSP.

 Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
Purified UclDLD (1.4 μg/well) was incubated with 5× Sypro orange fluorescent dye in 20 
mM Tris (pH 8.0) with or without 10 mM monosaccharide in a total volume of 70 μL. 
Samples were heated from 20 °C to 100 °C in 30-second/0.5 °C increments using a Bio-rad 
C1000 thermocycler with CFX96 RT-PCR attachment. The reported melting temperatures 
were determined by the inflection point of the sigmoidal graph.

cecum and colon in female C3H/HeN and C57BL/6 mice
(a) Mice were pretreated with streptomycin and subsequently colonized via oral gavage (PO) 
with UTI89, a prototypical human UPEC cystitis isolate. (b–e) Colonization of UTI89 in 
C3H/HeN mice from Envigo (b,c) or C57BL/6 mice from Envigo (d,e) was assessed by 
quantifying colony forming units (CFU) in fecal samples collected over the course of 21 
days from mice who did not receive streptomycin (white circles) or mice pretreated with the 
antibiotic (black circles). CFU analysis of levels of colonization in the cecum and colon 
were defined by analyzing tissue homogenates prepared 21 days post colonization. Symbols 
represent geometric means ± SD, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 (Mann

of the mouse gut and for binding to human intestinal epithelial cells
(a) C3H/HeN mice from Envigo were pretreated with streptomycin and concurrently 
colonized with 1×108 CFU of WT UTI89 and UTI89ΔfimH. The WT strain outcompetes the 
strain lacking the FimH adhesin. (b) The ability of purified FimH lectin domain (FimHLD) to 
bind to Caco-2 cells was assessed by a FimH-ELISA. Pre-incubation of FimHLD with D-
mannose (1mM) or M4284 (1mM) results in significant reductions in FimH binding to 
Caco-2 cells while 10% cyclodextrin (M4284 vehicle) had no significant effect. All data 
shown are normalized to wells that were not exposed to the purified adhesin. Abbreviations

 Extended Data Figure 3. F17-like pili are not required for UTI in mice.
C3H/HeN mice received a transurethral inoculation of UTI89 (WT) and UTI89Δucl, 
concurrently (a, b), or individually (c–e). (a) UTI89Δucl and WT strains persist at similar 
levels in the urine over 28 d in competitive infections. (b) The two strains are also present at 
equal levels in the bladder and kidney at the time of sacrifice (28 days post infection). (c) 
Single infection with the WT strain (black circles) or the F17-like mutant strain (white 
circles) produces similar levels of bacteruria over 28 days. (d) Single strain infection also 
produces similar levels of viable cells in homogenates of whole bladder or kidneys harvested 
at the time of sacrifice (28 days post infection). There was no statistically significant 
difference in the number of mice that resolved bacteriuria while maintaining bladder-
associated CFUs after transurethral infection with either WT or UTI89Δucl (highlighted in 
red in d), suggesting that both strains are capable of forming similar numbers of QIRs. (e) 
Mice infected transurethrally with WT or Δucl strains of UTI89 exhibit a similar number of

the duration of its effects
(a) Experimental design. (b) Animals treated as in panel (a) show a continued decrease in 
UTI89 levels in their feces (samples were processed after 3, 4, and 5 doses of M4284), and 
at the time of sacrifice in the cecum and colon, compared to control mice treated with 
vehicle alone (Control, 10% cyclodextrin). (c,d) The effects of mannoside treatment persist 5

inoculated into the urinary tract
C3H/HeN mice (Envigo) were given an experimental UTI via transurethral introduction of 
either 106 or 108 CFU of UTI89. The doses were chosen to represent the reduction observed 
in intestinal UTI89 titers before and after treatment with the M4284 mannoside. Mice were 
sacrificed 24 hours after inoculation and UTI89 titers in urine, bladder, and kidneys were 
defined by quantifying CFU. Mice receiving the 106 dose of UTI89 had significantly fewer 
bacteria in all three biospecimen types, indicating an important relationship between the 
number of bacteria introduced into the urinary tract and the severity of UTI outcome. Bars

(p<0.05;Wilcoxon Signed Rank test with FDR correction). Individual comparisons between 
untreated and other treatment types did not disclose changes that were statistically 
significant by Wilcoxon Signed Rank test with FDR correction. (b) Corresponding fecal 
samples collected 24 h after treatments (as shown in Extended Data Figure 8a) were 
homogenized, diluted serially, and plated on MacConkey medium. The abundance of 
bacteria capable of growing on the selective medium was similar between fecal samples 
taken from untreated mice and those collected 24 hours after treatment with cyclodextrin 
and M4284. No colonies were detected from fecal samples collected 24 hours after 
ciprofloxacin treatment. (c) Comparison of the representation of bacterial taxa in the fecal 
microbiota of untreated mice obtained from different vendors or representing different 
genetic backgrounds. Each row in the heatmap represents a species-level taxon, while each 
column represents a mouse of the indicated genetic background from the indicated vendor. 
Colored boxes indicate species whose relative abundances were significantly different 
(p<0.05) between all three groups of animals (Kruskal-Wallis test with FDR correction).

 Figure 1. Type 1 and F17-like pili promote UPEC intestinal colonization
Streptomycin pretreated C3H/HeN mice were concurrently (a–j) or singly (k) colonized with 
WT UTI89 and/or UTI89 lacking one or more CUP operons. (l,m) Purified adhesin lectin 
domains FimHLD (type 1 pili) and UclDLD (F17-like pili) were tested for binding to mouse 
colonic sections. Sections were stained with hoechst (blue) and antibodies to Muc2, a 
mucus-associated glycoprotein (green). FimHLD and UclDLD binding was lost by pre-
treating tissue sections with PNGase and O-glycosidase, respectively. Arrowheads highlight 
binding by FimHLD or UclDLD. (n) UclDLD does not bind five common monosaccharides.

 Figure 4. Mannoside treatment minimally effects the fecal microbiota configuration and targets 
human UPEC isolates in mice with different genetic backgrounds
Mice were given one of the following oral treatments: (i) M4284 (100mg/kg), (ii) 
cyclodextrin (Cyclo, 10%), (iii) ciprofloxacin (Cipro, 15mg/kg), or (iv) none (Untreated). 
Fecal community structure was defined by sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. 
(a) For each treatment performed on C3H/HeN mice from Envigo or CRL, the change in 
microbiota configuration was determined by measuring the unweighted UniFrac distance 
between samples obtained from each animal before treatment and 24 h after the last dose 
(larger UniFrac distance equates to a larger shift in community structure). (b–f) Mice were 
colonized by oral gavage (PO) of one of four different UPEC strains and given three doses 
of M4284. (g,h) The ability of M4284 to target UTI89 in C3H/HeN mice from CRL (g) and 
C57BL/6 mice from Envigo Labs (h) was also assessed. Bars represent median (a) or 
geometric means ± SD (c–h). *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 Mann

cyclodextrin); n=9 mice (M4284); 2 replicates (h). All replicates are biological (a–h).
