The starvation-inducible coactivator cAMP response element bind-
ing protein (CREB)–cAMP-regulated transcription coactivator (Crtc)
has been shown to promote starvation resistance in Drosophila by
up-regulating CREB target gene expression in neurons, although
the underlying mechanism is unclear. We found that Crtc and its
binding partner CREB enhance energy homeostasis by stimulating
the expression of short neuropeptide F (sNPF), an ortholog of mam-
malian neuropeptide Y, which we show here is a direct target of
CREB and Crtc. Neuronal sNPF was found to promote energy ho-
meostasis via gut enterocyte sNPF receptors, which appear to main-
tain gut epithelial integrity. Loss of Crtc–sNPF signaling disrupted
epithelial tight junctions, allowing resident gut flora to promote
chronic increases in antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression
that compromised energy balance. Growth on germ-free food re-
duced AMP gene expression and rescued starvation sensitivity in
Crtc mutant flies. Overexpression of Crtc or sNPF in neurons of wild-
type flies dampens the gut immune response and enhances starva-
tion resistance. Our results reveal a previously unidentified tolerance
defense strategy involving a brain–gut pathway that maintains ho-
meostasis through its effects on epithelial integrity.

hen faced with a pathogen, a host can use two defense
strategies to survive infection: resistance and tolerance (1–3).
Resistance mechanisms are a function of the immune system, which
works to kill pathogens. Tolerance mechanisms reduce the negative
impact of infection on host health without directly affecting patho-
gen levels. Although typically beneficial to the host, activation of the
immune system comes at the expense of energy stores, and over-
activation can lead to physiological damage in the form of metabolic
disruption. Indeed, genetic mutations that increase resistance also
affect tolerance (4).
Hosts have likely evolved tolerance mechanisms that maintain
triglyceride stores, in part, by modulating resistance (1, 2). The
tight junction protein big bang (Bbg) protects against bacterial
infection, for example, by maintaining epithelial integrity in the
gut; loss of Bbg expression triggers immune system activation and
decreases survival. Indeed, persistent up-regulation of the immune
response appears to decrease lifespan, in part, by interfering with
insulin signaling and thereby reducing energy stores (5).
In Drosophila, bacterial infection stimulates the production of an-
timicrobial peptides (AMPs) in response to activation of the NF-κB–
like pathways Imd and Toll (6). AMP expression is also up-regulated
in hemocytes during fasting, albeit to a far lower level; it requires the
forkhead box transcription factor FoxO (7, 8). Enhancing FOXO
activity promotes longevity, in part, by increasing pathogen resistance
(9, 10). However, dysregulated FOXO activation during pathogenic
infections increases mortality, despite control of pathogen burden
(11), due to the depletion of energy stores.
The Drosophila cAMP-regulated transcription coactivator
(Crtc) is expressed primarily in neurons, where it protects against
starvation and oxidative stress (12). Under basal conditions, Crtc,
like its mammalian homologs, is phosphorylated by salt-inducible
kinases and sequestered in the cytoplasm via interactions with
14-3-3 proteins (12, 13). In response to starvation or oxidative
stress, Crtc undergoes dephosphorylation and nuclear transloca-
tion, where it associates with cAMP response element binding
protein (CREB) over relevant promoters (14). Crtc mutant flies
have reduced triglyceride and glycogen stores, and they are short-
lived, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we
reveal an unexpected role of the neuronal CREB/CRTC pathway
in maintaining gut homeostasis by stimulating neuropeptide Y
(NPY)-like signaling. Our results may provide insight into the
treatment of stress-related gastrointestinal disorders.
Results
Crtc Suppresses Inflammation. Although their food intake is com-
parable to controls, Crtc mutant flies have lower glycogen and lipid
stores, and they are starvation-sensitive (12). In gene profiling
studies, we noticed that the expression of unpaired 3 (upd3), which
encodes a mammalian IL-6 homolog (15), was increased in Crtc
mutant flies, whereas other members of the UPD/JAK/STAT
pathway (upd, upd2, or Stat92) were not (Fig. 1A). Pointing to
activation of the Imd pathway in Crtc flies, mRNA amounts of the
stress peptide turandot A (TotA) and for the AMPs diptericin
(Dipt) and attacin (Att) were also up-regulated.
Using promoter-driven GFP reporter transgenes to identify
tissues in which Upd3 and Dipt transcriptional activities were el-
evated, we found that Upd3-GFP+ and Dipt-GFP+ cells were lo-
calized primarily in the midgut and proventriculus of Crtc mutant,
but not control, flies, respectively (Fig. 1B), whereas other tissues
were unremarkable.
The induction of Upd3 in gut enterocytes often signals increases
in stress due to bacterial infection or oxidative damage (16). Indeed,
Significance
The Drosophila coactivator cAMP-regulated transcription coac-
tivator (Crtc) functions in neurons to promote energy balance. We
found that Crtc and its binding partner cAMP response element
binding protein (CREB) maintain metabolic homeostasis by stim-
ulating the expression of the neuropeptide-Y–like neuropeptide
short neuropeptide F (sNPF). Loss of sNPF disrupted gut epithelial
integrity and increased immune response gene expression, lead-
ing to decreases in triglyceride and glycogen stores. Conversely,
overexpression of Crtc or sNPF in neurons of wild-type flies at-
tenuated the immune response and enhanced starvation resis-
tance. By enhancing gut barrier integrity, the CREB/CRTC pathway
maintains energy homeostasis in response to stress.

 Upd3 has been shown to promote enterocyte turnover by in-
creasing compensatory intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation.
Using phospho-Ser10-histone 3 immunostaining as a marker for
ISC activity, we found that numbers of mitoses in the midgut
were increased more than 10-fold in Crtc mutants relative to
controls (Fig. S1A). Collectively, these results indicate that Crtc
suppresses Upd3 and Imd pathways in the gut.
Epithelial integrity appears critical for innate immune ho-
meostasis (17). Intestinal barrier dysfunction promotes increases
in AMP gene expression that interfere with insulin signaling and
reduce energy stores (5). Having seen that Upd3 is up-regulated
in Crtc mutant flies, we wondered whether gut permeability is
correspondingly affected. In transmission electron microscopy
studies, electron densities at apical cell–cell junctions were re-
duced in Crtc mutant midgut relative to controls (Fig. S1B).
Intestinal permeability was also increased in dye-based (Smurf)
assays (Fig. S1C). As a result, amounts of active, phosphorylated
AKT were decreased in Crtc flies, and these Crtc flies had lower
amounts of triglyceride and glycogen relative to controls (Fig. 1C
and Fig. S1D).
In many organisms, commensal bacteria promote nutrient ab-
sorption and contribute to immune homeostasis (18). The intes-
tinal epithelium provides an important physical barrier that
permits growth of these commensals without triggering over-
activation of the immune system. Based on the loss of barrier
integrity in Crtc mutant flies, we examined whether gut micro-
biota ecology was affected. In line with this notion, populations
of the commensal bacteria Acetobacter sp. and Lactobacillus sp.
were increased in Crtc mutants (Fig. S1E). We considered that
the up-regulation of immune response genes in Crtc mutants may
reflect these increases in resident bacteria. In that event, elimi-
nation of these microbes would rescue starvation sensitivity. To
test this idea, we cultured Crtc mutant flies either under germ-
free conditions or on normal medium. Germ-free growth not
only reduced immune gene expression in Crtc mutant flies but
also increased triglyceride stores and enhanced starvation re-
sistance (Fig. 1 D and E and Fig. S1F).

 To determine whether the activation of the Imd pathway in
Crtc mutant flies enhances their resistance to gram-negative in-
fection, we challenged them with the intracellular pathogen
Salmonella. In keeping with the associated increases in AMP
expression, Crtc mutant flies had reduced bacterial counts rela-
tive to control flies (Fig. 1F). Despite their ability to control the
infection, however, Salmonella-infected Crtc mutants died more
rapidly than infected wild-type flies, demonstrating that there
were tradeoffs between the heightened resistance response and
tolerance defenses (Fig. 1G). These data suggest that an over-
exuberant response to infection compromised survival of Crtc
mutant flies relative to controls.
Creb Phenocopies the Metabolic Effects of Crtc. CRTCs have been
found to mediate induction of cellular genes by binding to CREB
over relevant promoters (14). Drosophila has a single CREB
homolog, CrebB, which appears to function in a variety of set-
tings, including learning and memory, circadian rhythmicity, and
sleep (19, 20). To date, there exists a single mutant allele of
CrebB, CrebBS162, which expresses truncated CrebB polypeptides
of unknown activity (20). To obtain well-characterized CrebB mu-
tations and to circumvent the lethality associated with the CrebBS162
chromosome, we generated a series of CrebB deletions by P-element–
mediated imprecise excision. One of these deletions, CrebBΔ400, is a
fully viable null allele that removes both the activation and leucine-
zipper DNA-binding domains (Fig. 2A). CrebB mRNA and protein
amounts are not detectable in CrebBΔ400 mutants (Fig. 2 B and C).
Consistent with the absence of CrebB, CREB reporter gene activity
is nearly eliminated in CrebBΔ400 flies (Fig. 2D).
We examined metabolic effects of CrebB. Similar to Crtc mutants,
CrebBΔ400 flies had reduced glycogen and lipid stores (Fig. 2E), and
they were sensitive to starvation (Fig. 2F). Moreover, proinflammatory

with controls (Fig. 2 G and H).
Short Neuropeptide F Is a Direct Target of CrebB and Crtc. Having
seen that panneuronal expression of fly Crtc fully rescues star-
vation sensitivity in Crtc mutants (12), we tested whether specific
neuronal types could mediate effects of Crtc in this setting. Using
the GAL4/upstream activation sequence (UAS) system to express
Crtc in discrete neuronal subsets, we found that supplying Crtc
function to the large class of peptidergic neurons (21) was sufficient
to rescue starvation sensitivity in Crtc mutant flies (Fig. S2A). Of
the roughly 60 neuropeptide-encoding genes in the Drosophila
genome, we noted several whose expression appeared to be Crtc-
dependent. In particular, the promoter for short neuropeptide F
(sNPF) contains a cAMP response element (CRE) that is fully
conserved across all Drosophila species (Fig. S2B). A member of
the NPY family of neuropeptides, sNPF has been shown to
function in energy-driven behavior (22).
In transient transfection assays, overexpression of Crtc in-
creased the activity of a wild-type, but not a CRE-mutant, sNPF

 reporter in S2 cells exposed to cAMP agonist (Fig. 3A). We also
performed ChIP studies to determine if Crtc directly regulates sNPF
transcription. Using the GAL4/UAS system to target expression of
epitope-tagged Crtc to sNPF neurons, we observed robust recruit-
ment of Crtc to the sNPF promoter relative to controls (Fig. 3B).
Consistent with the role of CrebB and Crtc in stimulating sNPF
gene expression, protein amounts for sNPF, detected by immuno-
histochemical staining, were substantially reduced in adult CrebB
and Crtc mutant brains (Fig. 3C).
We used the GAL4/UAS system in Crtc mutant flies to eval-
uate whether this coactivator is required specifically within sNPF
neurons to regulate inflammation and starvation sensitivity.
Supporting this idea, expression of Crtc under control of a sNPF-
GAL4 driver reduced AMP gene expression and restored
phospho-AKT amounts, thereby increasing triglyceride stores
(Fig. 3 D–G and Fig. S1D); however, Crtc expression in other
classes of neurons or in other tissues did not. Additionally,
melanization, a characteristic feature of the Drosophila immune
response, was evident in the posterior midgut and hindgut of Crtc
mutants (Fig. S2C); reexpression of Crtc in sNPF neurons, but
not in other tissues, rescued the melanization phenotype (Fig.
S2D). Indeed, overexpression of Crtc in sNPF neurons of wild-
type flies further enhanced their starvation resistance (Fig. 3H).
Collectively, these results indicate that Crtc functions in some
or all of the sNPF neurons to regulate starvation sensitivity and
gut immunity.
sNPF Inhibits Inflammation. To determine whether sNPF itself
mediates the effects of Crtc on inflammation and energy me-
tabolism, we evaluated starvation resistance and gut inflammation in
sNPF mutants using two alleles: a P-element insertion (sNPFNP6301)
and a sNPF partial deletion (sNPFΔ119; Fig. S3A). Both sNPF mu-
tant alleles act as strong loss-of-function alleles and show similar
phenotypes. sNPF peptide is greatly reduced in either of the sNPF
mutants by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. S3B).
mRNA amounts for proinflammatory genes (upd3, Dipt, Att, and
TotA) were increased in sNPF mutants relative to controls (Fig.
4B). Similar to Crtc mutant flies, upd3-lacZ reporter activity was
elevated in sNPF mutant midguts (Fig. S3C). Dipt-lacZ expression
in the proventriculus of sNPF mutants was also substantially up-
regulated, whereas Drs-GFP reporter activity was not (Fig. S3C).

 In line with these increases in immune gene expression, sNPF
mutant flies have lower triglycerides, and they are more sensitive
to starvation compared with controls (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3 D and
E). Consistent with a role for neuronal sNPF, blocking synaptic
release in the sNPF neurons with tetanus toxin increased star-
vation sensitivity in wild-type flies (Fig. S3F).
Having seen that Crtc overexpression in sNPF neurons enhances
starvation resistance in wild-type flies, we wondered whether these
effects are indeed dependent on sNPF itself. By contrast with its
salutary effects in a wild-type background, Crtc overexpression in
sNPF mutant flies failed to promote starvation resistance (Fig. 3H).
Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of sNPF
in mediating metabolic effects of Crtc.
Enterocyte sNPF Receptors Mediate Effects of Neuronal sNPF. To
determine the mechanism by which sNPF mediates effects of
Crtc on starvation resistance, we evaluated sNPF receptor
(sNPF-R) expression in tissues from adult flies. mRNA amounts
for sNPF-R were detected in the head and at fivefold higher
levels in the midgut (Fig. S4A). Similarly, UAS-GFP reporter
expression was observed in enterocytes of transgenic flies
expressing a sNPF-R promoter-GAL4 driver (Fig. 4C). Indeed,
midgut sNPF-R expression was significantly increased in Crtc
flies, likely reflecting the compensatory receptor up-regulation
that often accompanies decreases in ligand binding (Fig. S4B).
We tested the importance of sNPF-R in mediating effects of
Crtc in the gut. Similar to disruption of sNPF, RNAi-mediated
knockdown of sNPF-R with the enterocyte-specific GAL4 driver
Myo1A-GAL4 (23) decreased fly starvation resistance compared
with controls (Fig. 4D). By contrast, knockdown of sNPF-R in
ISCs and enteroblasts (EBs) with an Esg-GAL4 driver (24) did
not modulate starvation resistance. Indeed, knockdown of sNPF-R
in enterocytes, but not ISCs or EBs, also up-regulated in-
flammatory peptide expression while decreasing energy stores
(Fig. 4E and Fig. S4C). Conversely, overexpression of sNPF-R
from its own promoter-driven GAL4 (sNPF-R-GAL4) increased
starvation resistance in a wild-type background (Fig. 4F). sNPF-
R-GAL4 drives expression in both the gut and nervous system.
To determine in which tissue sNPF-R functions to increase
starvation resistance, we blocked sNPF-R overexpression spe-
cifically in neuronal tissues by coexpression of the GAL80 re-
pressor with elav-GAL80. The inclusion of elav-GAL80 did not
attenuate sNPF-R effects on starvation resistance, indicating that
the expression of SNPF-R specifically in the gut is required for
metabolic effects (Fig. 4F). Collectively, these results demon-
strate that enterocyte sNPF-R is required for salutary effects of
Crtc on innate immunity and energy balance.
Discussion
Disruptions in energy balance are a component of the collat-
eral damage associated with mounting an immune response. In
addition to regulating the magnitude of an immune response,
energy allocation must be properly regulated to minimize phys-
iological damage during infection. We found that Drosophila
sNPF, a mammalian NPY homolog, is regulated by CrebB/Crtc
within the CNS, where it promotes energy balance by maintaining
epithelial integrity and thereby attenuating overexuberant immune
activation in the gut. The effects of sNPF were unexpected, given
its role in food-seeking behavior (25). Indeed, food intake appears
comparable between Crtc mutants and control flies (12).
The effects of sNPF are mediated by enterocyte sNPF-Rs,
suggesting that the sNPF brain-gut signal is released by a subset
of the sNPF+ neurons that directly innervate the gut (26).
Although neuronal activity is known to contribute to energy
homeostasis, our results suggest that the modulation of the
gut immune system by CrebB/Crtc is a critical component in
this process.
Epithelial tissues are typically colonized by both commensal
and invasive microbes. sNPF appears to be actively expressed
and released from the CNS in times of stress, providing nonau-
tonomous control of gut immunity from the brain. Based on its
widespread expression in the midgut, sNPF-R may provide ubiq-
uitous attenuation of the innate immune response. Consistent with
our observations in Drosophila, activation of the NPY receptor
ortholog (NPR-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans also down-regulates
inflammatory gene expression (27). Our studies extend these find-
ings by showing how a neuronal fasting-inducible pathway modu-
lates energy balance via its effects on the gut immune system.
Following their activation, sNPF-Rs appear to promote energy
balance by enhancing epithelial integrity. Although the mecha-
nism underlying these effects is unclear, we note that disruption
of the tight junction protein Bbg in flies also causes constitutive
up-regulation of innate immunity genes (17). Future studies
should reveal whether sNPF-R modulates the activity of Bbg or
related proteins in enterocytes.
In mammals, inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative
colitis, are often associated with profound weight loss, due, in
part, to the chronic activation of the immune system. By reducing
inflammatory gene expression and enhancing energy homeosta-
sis, gut neuropeptides, such as NPY, may provide therapeutic
benefit in this setting.

generated by mobilization of the P{EPgy2}insertion EY04780 with a Δ2-3
source of transposase (35). Potential deletions were screened by PCR. The
CrebBΔ400 deletion line has an ∼3.5-kb deletion that removes sequences
encoding the CREB leucine zipper-DNA binding domain. The CrebBΔ400 de-
letion break points were confirmed by sequencing.
sNPF deletion was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) (36). Briefly, two pairs of chi-RNA targeting se-
quences were selected using CRISPR Resource (www.genome-engineering.org/
crispr), sNPF-E2s, TACAGTTTCCCATCAACGCG, sNPF-E2as, CGCGTTGATGG-
GAAACTGTAC, sNPF-E5s, TGGCAATGACAATGGCAGCT, sNPF-E5as, and
AGCTGCCATTGTCATTGCCAC. The sequences were cloned into pU6-BbsI-chiRNA.
Targeting DNAs were used with phsp70-Cas9 to inject fly embryos. Positive de-
letions were selected by PCR and confirmed with sequencing.
Cultivation of Bacterial Flora. Five third-instar larvae were collected, washed
twice in PBS, and sterilized in 75% (vol/vol) ethanol for 2 min to eliminate
bacteria on the larval surface. The larvae were then washed with sterile PBS
and homogenized in 100 μL of sterile PBS. Ten microliters of the homoge-
nate was diluted in sterile PBS and spread on LB plates. The plates were
incubated at 25 °C for 3 d.
Salmonella Injections. Salmonella typhimurium (a gift from D. Monack,
Stanford University, Stanford, CA) was grown overnight in LB media shaking
at 37 °C. Cultures were diluted, and 1,000 cfu was injected into male 5- to
7-d-old files. Flies were anesthetized with CO2 and injected with 50 nL of
culture using a picospritzer and pulled glass needle. Flies were injected in
the anterior abdomen on the ventrolateral surface. Flies were then placed in
vials containing molasses medium and incubated at 29 °C, 65% humidity.
The number of dead flies was counted daily. Using Prism (GraphPad) soft-
ware, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated, and statistical analysis
was done using log-rank analysis. Survival was tested at least three times
and gave similar results for each trial. For cfu determination, infected flies
were homogenized in PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and serially
diluted. Dilutions were plated on LB agar plates and incubated overnight.
The data were plotted using Prism software for three independent experi-
ments. The P value was determined with a nonparametric two-tailed t test.

 Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay. Drosophila S2 cells were
maintained as previously described (12), and 1.5-kb and 0.7-kb sNPF pro-
moter fragments were cloned into a pGL3 vector. Transfections were per-
formed as reported (12). After 2–3 d infection, cells were collected for
protein or RNA analysis.
Starvation and Oxidative Stress. Starvation and oxidative stress assays have
been described (12).
Tissue Staining. Primary and secondary antibodies were used as indicated:
anti-LacZ (41-1a; 1:100) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,
rabbit anti-pH 3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), mouse anti-GFP (1:1,000; Life
Technologies), Alexa Fluor 488- and 568-conjugated antibodies (1:1,000; Life
Technologies), rabbit anticaudal (Paul McDonald, University of Texas at
Austin, Austin), rabbit anti-sNPF (Jan Veenstra, Universite de Bordeaux,
Bordeaux, France and Kweon Yu, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and
Biotechnology, Daejeon, South Korea), and mouse anti-CrebB (Jerry Yin,
University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Tissues were counterstained with
DAPI. Msn-lacZ activity was detected in transgenic flies by X-Gal (5-bromo-4-
chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) staining. Images from staining are
representative of three independent experiments.
Quantitative PCR. RNA was isolated from antennae of 10 female flies for each
sample. The RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) was used to isolate RNA, and reverse transcription
was performed using the Retroscript kit (Ambion) with random decamers.
cDNA was subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using SYBR green de-
tection on a Light Cycler 480 II thermocycler (Roche). All values are the average of
four replicates, each measured in triplicate and normalized to rp49 mRNA.

ChIP. Chromatin was prepared and immunoprecipitated as described, with the
following modifications. The heads of 0.5 g of flies were ground in liquid
nitrogen with a mortar and pestle before cross-linking with formaldehyde.
Chromatin was sheared by 15 10-s bursts of sonication at level 6 power with a
Virtis Virsonic 100 Sonicator. IgG was used as a negative control, and mono-
clonal anti-GFP was used to pull down chromatin complexes. Precipitated DNA
fragments were purified and resuspended in 50 μL of water for qPCR analysis.
Smurf Assay. Seven- to 10-d-old flies were collected, starved for 2 h, and then
transferred to normal food containing 10% blue food dye (FD&C blue dye
no. 1). Flies were incubated in vials with blue dye at 29 °C. Flies with ex-
tended blue coloration not limited to the proboscis and crop were
scored positive.
Statistical Analyses. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired
two-tailed Student’s t test with unequal variance. Statistical significance for
survival curves was determined using a log-rank test. Data are presented as
mean ± SD. Two-tailed P values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. The
target number of samples in each group was determined based on numbers
reported in published studies. No statistical methods were used to prede-
termine sample size. Microsoft Excel was used for statistical analyses. The
experiments were not randomized.
