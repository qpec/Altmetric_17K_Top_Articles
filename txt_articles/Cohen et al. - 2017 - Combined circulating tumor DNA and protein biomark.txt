The earlier diagnosis of cancer is one of the keys to reducing
cancer deaths in the future. Here we describe our efforts to
develop a noninvasive blood test for the detection of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma. We combined blood tests for KRAS gene
mutations with carefully thresholded protein biomarkers to deter-
mine whether the combination of these markers was superior to
any single marker. The cohort tested included 221 patients with
resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and 182 control pa-
tients without known cancer. KRAS mutations were detected in
the plasma of 66 patients (30%), and every mutation found in the
plasma was identical to that subsequently found in the patient’s
primary tumor (100% concordance). The use of KRAS in conjunc-
tion with four thresholded protein biomarkers increased the sen-
sitivity to 64%. Only one of the 182 plasma samples from the
control cohort was positive for any of the DNA or protein bio-
markers (99.5% specificity). This combinatorial approach may
prove useful for the earlier detection of many cancer types.

P
ancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, hereafter “pan-
creatic cancer”) is the third leading cause of cancer death
and is predicted to become the second most common cause in
the United States by 2030 (1). Pancreatic cancer is notoriously
lethal, with fewer than 9% of patients surviving 5 y after di-
agnosis (2). The poor prognosis of patients with pancreatic
cancer is in part due to the fact that 80–85% of patients are
diagnosed at advanced stages, when either tumor invasion into
the surrounding major vessels or distant metastases are evident
upon radiologic studies (3). At this late point in the disease,
pancreatic cancer is not amenable to surgical resection, and the
3-y survival rate is <5%. In contrast, a 5-y survival of almost 60%
is reported for very small, localized tumors; among resectable
cancers, the smaller the tumor, the better the prognosis (4–8).
Pancreatic cancer is not different from other cancers with re-
spect to its strong correlation between tumor stage and prognosis
(4). Very few patients with cancers of the lung, colon, esophagus,
or stomach who have distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis
survive for more than 5 y (9). The size of cancers is also important
in a general sense, in that smaller tumors have less often metas-
tasized than larger tumors at the time of diagnosis and are
therefore more likely to be curable by surgery alone. Even when
cancers have metastasized to distant sites, a smaller burden of
disease is much more easily managed than bulky lesions (10).
Thus, adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents administered to patients

 with micrometastases stemming from a colorectal cancer can be
curative in nearly 50% of cases (11–13). The same chemothera-
peutic agents delivered to patients with metastatic lesions that are
radiologically visible produce virtually no cures (14).
It is therefore evident that the earlier detection of cancers is
one key to reducing deaths from these diseases, including pan-
creatic cancer. In addition to offering the possibility of surgical
resection, newly developed adjuvant chemotherapeutic and
emerging immunotherapy regimens will undoubtedly prove more
efficacious in patients with minimal disease beyond that which is
curable surgically (15). Biomarkers in the circulation provide one
of the best ways, in principle, to detect cancers at an earlier stage.
Historically, the type of biomarkers used to monitor cancers
were proteins (16) and included carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and cancer antigen
125 (CA125). These biomarkers have proven useful for following
patients with known disease, but none has been approved for
screening purposes, in part because of their low sensitivity or
specificity (17–19). More recently, mutant DNA has been explored
as a biomarker. The concept underlying this approach, often called
“liquid biopsies,” is that cancer cells, like normal self-renewing
cells, turn over frequently. DNA released from the dying cells
can escape into bodily fluids such as urine, stool, and plasma (20–
30). An advantage of using mutant DNA in the circulation as a
biomarker is its exquisite specificity. Every cell within a cancer has
a core set of somatic mutations in driver genes that are responsible
for their clonal growth (31). In contrast, normal cells do not
clonally expand during adulthood, and the fraction of normal cells
that have any specific somatic mutation is extremely low.
Most studies of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have focused
on following patients with cancer rather than on evaluating its
use in screening settings. Available data indicate that ctDNA is
elevated in >85% of patients with advanced forms of many cancer
types (22, 24). However, it has been shown that a considerably
smaller fraction of patients with earlier stages of cancer have de-
tectable levels of ctDNA in their plasma (22, 24). In the current
study, we determined whether ctDNA and protein biomarkers can
be combined to increase the sensitivity of detection of resectable
pancreatic cancer under conditions that preserve high specificity.
Results
Characteristics of Patients with PDAC and Presumed Healthy Controls.
Two hundred and twenty-one patients with surgically resectable
pancreatic cancer were evaluated in this study. The histopatho-
logical and clinical characteristics of these patients are summa-
rized in Table S1. A total of 182 individuals of similar age with no
known history of cancer, autoimmune disease, or chronic kidney
disease acted as the healthy control cohort.
Twenty percent of the patients had no symptoms typically
associated with pancreatic cancer. The size of the primary tu-
mors at presentation ranged from 0.6 cm to 13 cm, with a median
size of 3.0 cm. The most common stage at presentation was
American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIB, ac-
counting for 77% of patients, with the remaining patients har-
boring stage IA (5%), stage IB (8%), or stage IIA (10%) disease
(Table S1). Patient survival correlated with stage, as graphically
depicted in Fig. S1 and as expected from prior clinical studies (32).
A PCR-Based Assay to Identify Tumor-Specific KRAS Mutations in
Plasma Samples. We designed a PCR-based assay that could si-
multaneously assess the two codons (codons 12 and 61) of the
KRAS gene that are most frequently mutated in PDAC as well as
surrounding codons. The assay used a sensitive technology called
the “Safe-Sequencing System” (Safe-SeqS) (33). Safe-SeqS in-
corporates molecular barcodes that uniquely label each template
molecule, thereby drastically minimizing the errors that routinely
occur in massively parallel sequencing. This approach can iden-
tify one mutant template among as many as 10,000 normal
templates. Using this technology, we identified KRAS mutations
in the plasma of 66 of the 221 (30%: 95% CI 24–36%) pancreatic
cancer cases (Table 1, Table S2, and Dataset S1). Sixty-two
(94%) and four (6%) of the mutations were at codons 12 and
61, respectively, with G > T transversions most commonly ob-
served (Dataset S1). Mutations were found more frequently in
stage II patients than in stage I patients (Fig. 1A, Table 1, Table
S2, and Dataset S1). Additionally, while the mutant allele fre-
quency did not correlate with tumor size (Fig. S2A and Dataset
S1), mutations were found more frequently in larger tumors than
in smaller tumors (Fig. 1B, Table 2, Table S2, and Dataset S1).
The number of mutant templates in the plasma could be cal-
culated from the mutant allele fraction and the concentration of
DNA in each plasma sample (Dataset S1). This number was
often very low, with 25 (38%) of the patients with detectable
KRAS mutations having fewer than two mutant templates per
milliliter of plasma. The average number of mutant templates
per milliliter of plasma was 5.3 (Dataset S1). These results em-
phasize that extremely sensitive techniques are required to ef-
fectively detect the mutations in early-stage pancreatic cancer
patients. KRAS mutations were observed in only one of the
182 individuals in the presumed healthy cohort, a 69-y-old male
with no known cancer.

Significance
Few patients with pancreatic cancer survive longer than 5 y, in
part because most patients are identified only after their disease
has progressed to an advanced stage. In this study, we show how
combining mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with pro-
tein markers can result in a screening test with improved sensi-
tivity while retaining specificity. The combination of the ctDNA
and protein markers was superior to any single marker. Moreover,
the combination detected nearly two-thirds of pancreatic cancers
that had no evidence of distant metastasis at the time of surgical
resection. The strategy may represent an approach to detect
cancers of many types at an earlier stage.

 The basis for the liquid biopsy concept is that the mutant DNA
templates identified in the circulation are derived from cancers.
It was therefore important to determine whether the KRAS
mutations identified in these patients’ plasma samples were also
present in their primary carcinomas. We were able to obtain
primary carcinomas from 50 of the 66 patients with detectable
KRAS mutations in their plasma. In all 50 cases, the mutation
found in the plasma was identical to that found in the primary
carcinoma, providing another, orthogonal measure of specificity.
Simultaneous Assessment of CA19-9 and KRAS Mutations in Plasma.
We sought to determine whether a combination of the KRAS
ctDNA test with CA19-9, the best-known PDAC biomarker (17,
34), would result in improved sensitivity compared with the
KRAS ctDNA test alone. Recent studies have shown that CA19-9
can be elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer 2 y before di-
agnosis (35). However, CA19-9 elevations have also been ob-
served in nonmalignant conditions, and 5% of the population
cannot produce the CA19-9 antigen due to germline genetic var-
iation, limiting its use for screening purposes (17). However, we
reasoned that CA19-9 might prove useful as a screening bio-
marker if the threshold for scoring a result as positive was suffi-
ciently high. We chose a threshold of 100 U/mL based on prior
data that this level is not found among healthy individuals who do
not have a clinical history of pancreaticobiliary disease (36).
Using this predefined high threshold, CA19-9 was detected in
109 of the 221 (49%: 95% CI 43–56%) patients with pancreatic
cancer and in none of the 182 healthy controls, confirming its
specificity when used in this way (Table 1, Table S3, and Datasets
S1 and S2). As expected, the number of patients with detectable
CA19-9 levels increased with stage and tumor size (Fig. 1, Tables 1
and 2, Table S3, and Dataset S1). The most important question
addressed in the current study was whether these two biomarkers—
KRAS mutations and a positive CA19-9 score—were independent
indicators of the presence of disease. We found that the overlap was
only partial, as indicated in the Venn diagram in Fig. 2A. Although
42 patients (19%) had elevated CA19-9 levels as well as detectable
KRAS mutations in their plasma, 91 additional patients had either
mutations in KRAS or elevated CA19-9 but not both (Fig. 2A).
Thus, the combined sensitivity of these analyses was 60% (95% CI
53–67%), higher than the sensitivity of either alone (Fig. 1 and
Table 1). Importantly, the two assays could be combined without
substantially increasing the false-positive rate because each was
extremely specific at the thresholds used.
Further Increasing Sensitivity by Inclusion of Other Protein Biomarkers.
Encouraged by the results described above, we sought to further
increase sensitivity by combining ctDNA KRAS mutations and
CA19-9 with other protein biomarkers. In a pilot study on a small
number of pancreatic cancer samples independent from those
studied here, we evaluated the potential utility of other proteins
that had been found to be elevated in cancer, including alpha-
fetoprotein (AFP), CA15-3, leptin, IL-6, CEA, CA-125, IL-8, sFas,
prolactin, osteopontin (OPN), basic FGF2, hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF), cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), human
epididymis protein 4 (HE4), TGF-α, growth/differentiation factor
15 (GDF15), dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), neuron-specific
enolase (NSE), osteoprotegerin (OPG), TIMP metallopeptidase
inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (TIMP-2),
mesothelin, midkine, kallikrein-6, CD44, AXL receptor tyrosine
kinase, soluble human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (sHER2),
soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR), soluble
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), and sol-
uble platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (sPECAM-1)
(37). Of these 29 protein biomarkers, five—CEA (38), HGF (39),
midkine (40), OPN (41), and prolactin (42)—appeared to be most
promising.
When the levels of these five markers were evaluated in
plasmas from our 221-patient pancreatic cancer cohort, we ob-
served an association between the plasma concentrations of
prolactin and midkine and sample collection site (P < 0.01, χ2
test, df = 5), suggesting that blood collection conditions might
have elevated the levels of these two markers. There was no
significant correlation between CA19-9, CEA, HGF, or OPN
levels and collection sites, nor was there any correlation between
the presence of KRAS ctDNA mutations and collection site.
Upon further investigation, we noted that the levels of prolactin
and midkine were significantly elevated in samples that were col-
lected after the administration of anesthesia but before surgical
excision (Fig. S3). The results on prolactin were consistent with
previous studies showing that anesthetics elevate the levels of this
protein (43). To ensure that anesthesia did not affect the levels of
the other protein biomarkers described above, we collected paired
plasma samples before and immediately after the administration of
anesthesia in 29 new patients. The only proteins found to be ele-
vated by anesthesia were prolactin and midkine (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) (Fig. S4), in perfect accord with the correlation
between collection site and protein levels noted above. We there-
fore excluded prolactin and midkine from further analysis.
Unlike CA19-9, no predefined threshold exists for the use of
CEA, HGF, or OPN as markers for pancreatic cancer. As a re-
sult, we determined appropriate thresholds in an independent set
of 273 plasma samples from healthy controls. To be conservative,

 we chose thresholds for each protein that were 10% higher than
the maximum values observed in any of the 273 normal plasma
samples. Notably, when these thresholds were applied to the
independent test set of 182 plasma samples, all three protein
markers maintained 100% specificity (Dataset S2). The sensi-
tivity of each of these three markers was less than that obtained
with KRAS mutations or CA19-9 when each marker was used
alone, but their levels were less dependent on stage and size than
KRAS mutations or CA19-9 (Table 1, Fig. S2, Tables S4–S6, and
Dataset S1). In combination with KRAS mutations and CA19-9
assays, this five-member biomarker panel (“combination assay”)
detected 141 (64%: 95% CI 57–70%) of the 221 resectable can-
cers (Figs. 1A and 2A, Table 1, Fig. S5, Table S7, and Dataset S1).
Some of the patients detectable by the combination assay were
of particular note. Forty-five (20%) of the patients in this study
had no symptoms classically associated with pancreatic cancer
(Table S1 and Dataset S1). The combination assay identified 27
(60%) of these individuals, of whom 19 (70%) had no evidence
of recurrence with a median follow-up of 12 mo (range 3–16 mo)
(Table S7 and Dataset S1). Of the 29 patients with the earliest
stages of disease recognized by the AJCC (stages IA and IB), 12
(41%) were detectable using the combination assay (Fig. 1A),
seven of whom (58%) had no evidence of recurrence at the study
termination with a median follow-up of 19 mo (range 2–25 mo).
Another notable but sobering result from our study was that
patients with poorer survival were more likely to have a positive
test. Of the entire 221 pancreatic cancer patients studied, 122
(56%) patients were alive at the termination of the study, with
a median follow-up of 13 mo (7–21 mo). We found that the
combination assay provided prognostic value that was indepen-
dent of conventional clinical and histopathologic features. In
particular, multivariate analyses showed that the independent
predictors of overall survival were combination assay status
[hazards ratio (HR) = 1.76, 95% CI 1.10–2.84, P = 0.018], in-
creasing age (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06, P = 0.001), grade of
differentiation (poorly differentiated, HR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.11–
2.66, P = 0.015), lymphovascular invasion (present, HR = 1.81,
95% CI 1.06–3.09, P = 0.028), nodal disease (present, HR =
2.35, 95% CI 1.20–4.61, P = 0.013), and margin status (HR =
1.59, 95% CI 1.01–2.55, P = 0.050) (Fig. S6).
Inclusion of TP53 in a Multiplex Assay. While nearly all pancreatic
cancers harbor mutations within KRAS, a large fraction (∼75%)
also contains mutations in TP53 (44–46). Furthermore, TP53 is the
mostly commonly mutated gene in cancer (31), making it an at-
tractive target for ctDNA detection in future studies involving other
tumor types. We wished to determine whether the mutant allele
frequencies (MAF) of TP53 in the plasma correlated with those of
KRAS and also whether a mutant TP53 assay in plasma might add
to the sensitivity of the mutant KRAS assay. For this purpose, we
evaluated the 152 carcinomas for which matched tumor and plasma
samples were available. We first searched for mutations at one of
the “hotspots” identified in previous genome-wide studies of PDAC
(44). A total of 64 (42%) carcinomas contained a TP53 mutation at
one of these positions. We then determined whether these same
mutations could be identified in the plasma of these 64 patients,
using Safe-SeqS–based assays similar to that described above for
KRAS but using primers specific for particular TP53 mutations.
We identified TP53 mutations in 13 (20%) of the 64 plasma
samples (Table S8). Two observations were of interest. First, 12 of
the 13 plasma samples containing a detectable TP53 mutation also
contained a detectable KRAS mutation. Thus, TP53 mutation assays
did not substantially increase sensitivity for pancreatic cancer de-
tection, as expected from the high prevalence of KRAS mutations
noted above. Second, there was a strong correlation between the
MAF of TP53 and KRAS mutations in the plasma of the 12 patients
whose plasma contained detectable amounts of both mutations
(Pearson’s r = 0.885) (Fig. 2B). This provides yet another validation
of the reliability of the ctDNA assay and its quantitative nature.
Discussion
The major conclusion of this study is that assays for genetic al-
terations can be combined with assays for elevated proteins to
increase the sensitivity of a blood test for low-stage pancreatic
cancers. We were able to detect 64% of these cancers through
this combination test, including some patients with a favorable
prognosis. One of the critical design features of our study was
that we included only patients with resectable pancreatic cancers
and excluded all patients with advanced disease (i.e., stage III or

(A) Combining ctDNA and protein markers increases sensitivity be-
cause a large proportion of patients are detected by only one marker. The
Venn diagram shows the number of patients detected by ctDNA KRAS mu-
tations (red circle), CA19-9 (green circle), the three other protein biomarkers
(blue circle), and by combinations thereof (overlapping regions). Eighty pa-
tients (36% of the total) were not detectable by any of the three makers.
(B) MAF of KRAS and TP53 mutations are strongly correlated (Pearson’s r =
0.885) in the plasma of the 12 patients whose plasma contained detectable
amounts of both mutations, providing validation of the reliability of the ctDNA
assay and its quantitative nature. The shaded region represents the 95% CI.

 IV). Although this exclusion reduces the sensitivity that could be
achieved by evaluating all pancreatic cancer patients, regardless
of stage, the resectable cases are the most important group with
respect to evaluating a screening technology.
Whether combining ctDNA and protein markers could in-
crease sensitivity over either alone was not known. In fact, it was
conceivable that the patients with detectable circulating protein
markers would largely overlap those releasing DNA into the
circulation. This was of particular concern for early-stage cancer
patients, because both ctDNA and protein-based markers are
known to be considerably higher in patients with advanced
cancers than in those with earlier-stage cancers (17, 19, 22).
Another important aspect of our study is that we achieved very
high specificity (99.5%: 95% CI 97–100%), observing only one
false positive among 182 healthy individuals of average age 64 y.
Given the relative infrequency of cancer in the general pop-
ulation, the specificity of any potentially useful blood-based
screening test for pancreatic cancer has to be high, prefera-
bly >99%. Otherwise, the number of false positives will greatly
exceed the number of true positives (i.e., have suboptimal posi-
tive predictive value) (47). This stringency for screening tests is
not required for tests to monitor disease in patients with known
cancer. For monitoring, specificity can be relaxed somewhat in
the interest of obtaining higher sensitivity. We achieved high
specificity in two ways. First, we used ctDNA as one of the
components of the test. KRAS mutations are exquisitely specific
for neoplasia, and their specificity is limited by technical rather
than biological factors. The incorporation of molecular barcod-
ing into our assays (Safe-SeqS) minimizes the false-positive re-
sults from sequencing that are the major technical issues
confronting any ctDNA-based assays. KRAS mutations are par-
ticularly suitable for early-detection strategies because they are
rarely found in clones arising during age-associated clonal he-
matopoiesis. Such clones, which may represent early forms of
myelodysplasia, are a potential source of false-positive ctDNA
assays. The vast majority of such mutations occur within nine
genes (DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2, ASXL1, TP53, GNAS, PPM1D,
BCORL1, and SF3B1) (48–50), posing challenges for the use of
these genes as biomarkers in ctDNA-based assays. Second, we
used high thresholds for scoring the protein markers as positive.
These thresholds were based on prior studies in the literature or
on an independent set of controls, allowing us to avoid positive
scores in the vast majority of healthy patients (36). We could
afford to use these high thresholds without an overall reduction
in sensitivity because the ctDNA assay added sensitivity on its
own and the ctDNA-positive cases only partially overlapped the
protein-biomarker–positive cases (Figs. 1 and 2A and Table 1).
Protein biomarkers have been combined in the past to achieve
higher sensitivity (51). For example, nearly 20 y ago it was shown
that combining CA19-9 and TIMP-1 was more sensitive for the
detection of PDAC than either biomarker alone (34). More re-
cently, it was shown that the combination of CA19-9, TIMP-1,
and LRG-1 was more sensitive for the detection of early PDAC
than CA19-9 alone (52). The combination of protein biomarkers
with ultrasensitive ctDNA is by comparison novel. For example,
a recent study evaluated a combination of ctDNA and CA19-9
for pancreatic cancer but found no benefit to combining the
biomarkers over CA19-9 alone, perhaps due to inadequate sen-
sitivity of the test used in detecting KRAS mutations (53). Fur-
thermore, the specificity for ctDNA achieved in that study was
relatively low, reducing its suitability for screening.
Our study demonstrates that the majority of patients with re-
sectable pancreatic cancers can be detected through a noninvasive
blood test. However, there are several limitations of the study that
should be acknowledged. Patients with pancreaticobiliary disease,
such as ascending cholangitis, cholecystitis, or chronic pancreatitis,
can have high levels of CA19-9 (17). Our goal is to develop a test
that will be used in healthy, asymptomatic individuals. Individuals
with ascending cholangitis, cholecystitis, or acute pancreatitis are
almost always symptomatic. Incidentally detected chronic pancre-
atitis has been reported; however, the risk of this is extremely low,
with an estimated prevalence of 0.49 per 100,000 (54–56), so this
should not reduce specificity in practice. Another limitation is that,
even though the majority of patients with resectable pancreatic
cancer in our cohort could be detected, most patients still died from
disease recurrence following surgery. These results make it clear
that it will be necessary to detect cancers at earlier stages than those
in our cohort to realize the maximum potential of earlier diagnosis,
i.e., detection of individuals that can be cured by surgery alone.
On the other hand, the results we obtained may underestimate
the survival benefits of early detection. The majority of the pa-
tients we studied, even though they had resectable cancers, were
symptomatic, and their cancers were discovered only by virtue of
their symptoms. Accordingly, 77% of patients in our cohort were
stage IIB, and the median size of tumors in these patients was
3 cm. In a screening study of asymptomatic individuals, it is
expected that a greater proportion of earlier-stage patients with
smaller tumors will be discovered. This optimistic expectation is
somewhat tempered by the fact that our combination assay was
more sensitive for the detection of patients with larger tumors
and patients with a poorer prognosis than for patients with
smaller tumors, even though all tumors were surgically resectable
(Fig. 1B, Table 2, Fig. S6, and Table S7). Another caveat to the
use of this test for screening is that KRAS mutations are found in
the circulation of patients with cancer types other than those of
the pancreas, primarily cancers of the lung (57), and CA19-9,
CEA, HGF, and OPN expression is elevated in several other
cancer types (36, 58–60). Thus, patients testing positive would
have to undergo appropriate imaging studies for tumor locali-
zation. Despite these limitations, our study establishes proof of
principle for a large, prospective study in which these and other
related issues can be evaluated.
The current study also lays a foundation for evaluation of pa-
tients at high risk for PDAC, which is a key strategy in imple-
mentation of early-detection technologies (61). As an example,
new-onset diabetes is associated with an increased risk for pancre-
atic cancer. Approximately 1% of diabetic patients aged 50 y and
older are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 3 y of first
meeting criteria for diabetes (62). With an incidence of 1%, the
positive predictive value/negative predictive value of the combina-
tion assay are expected to be 54% and 99.6%, respectively, in this
population, which is well within the range of currently approved
screening tests for cancers.
The applicability of our combination strategy to other cancers
remains to be determined. Its success will largely depend on the
extent of release of ctDNA from other cancer types coupled with
the availability of protein and other biomarkers for those types.
Available evidence indicates that many cancers have detectable
ctDNA in their earliest stages, often more commonly than ob-
served in pancreatic cancer (22). Similarly, a large number of
protein biomarkers have already been described for the de-
tection of numerous cancer types (16). In theory, these protein
biomarkers could be thresholded in the way described here, of-
fering cautious optimism for the use ctDNA–protein combina-
tions to detect a variety of cancer types (22).
Materials and Methods
Detailed materials and methods are available in SI Materials and Methods.
Briefly, DNA was purified from plasma using a QIAsymphony circulating
DNA kit (catalog no. 1091063; Qiagen). Custom primers containing a unique
identifier (UID) and amplicon-specific sequence (Table S9) were used to amplify
plasma DNA, and the resulting products were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq
or HiSeq instrument. Protein biomarker plasma concentrations were determined
using Luminex bead-based immunoassays on the Bio-Plex 200 platform (Bio-
Rad). Plasma samples were scored as positive if the sample contained a KRAS
mutation or if the concentration of CA19-9, CEA, HGF, or OPN was greater than
100 U/mL, 7.5 ng/mL, 0.92 ng/mL, or 158 ng/mL, respectively. All samples were
