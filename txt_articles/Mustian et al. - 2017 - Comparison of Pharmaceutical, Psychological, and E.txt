Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) remains one of the most prevalent and 
troublesome adverse events experienced by patients with cancer during and after therapy.
OBJECTIVE—To perform a meta-analysis to establish and compare the mean weighted effect 
sizes (WESs) of the 4 most commonly recommended treatments for CRF—exercise, 
psychological, combined exercise and psychological, and pharmaceutical—and to identify 
independent variables associated with treatment effectiveness.
DATA SOURCES—PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were 
searched from the inception of each database to May 31, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION—Randomized clinical trials in adults with cancer were selected. Inclusion 
criteria consisted of CRF severity as an outcome and testing of exercise, psychological, exercise 
plus psychological, or pharmaceutical interventions.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—Studies were independently reviewed by 12 raters 
in 3 groups using a systematic and blinded process for reconciling disagreement. Effect sizes 
(Cohen d) were calculated and inversely weighted by SE.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Severity of CRF was the primary outcome. Study 
quality was assessed using a modified 12-item version of the Physiotherapy Evidence-Based 
Database scale (range, 0–12, with 12 indicating best quality).
RESULTS—From 17 033 references, 113 unique studies articles (11525 unique participants; 78% 
female; mean age, 54 [range, 35–72] years) published from January 1, 1999, through May 31, 
2016, had sufficient data. Studies were of good quality (mean Physiotherapy Evidence-Based 
Database scale score, 8.2; range, 5–12) with no evidence of publication bias. Exercise (WES, 0.30; 
95% CI, 0.25–0.36; P < .001), psychological (WES, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.21–0.33; P < .001), and 
exercise plus psychological interventions (WES, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13–0.38; P < .001) improved

 CRF during and after primary treatment, whereas pharmaceutical interventions did not (WES, 
0.09; 95% CI, 0.00–0.19; P = .05). Results also suggest that CRF treatment effectiveness was 
associated with cancer stage, baseline treatment status, experimental treatment format, 
experimental treatment delivery mode, psychological mode, type of control condition, use of 
intention-to-treat analysis, and fatigue measures (WES range, −0.91 to 0.99). Results suggest that 
the effectiveness of behavioral interventions, specifically exercise and psychological interventions, 
is not attributable to time, attention, and education, and specific intervention modes may be more 
effective for treating CRF at different points in the cancer treatment trajectory (WES range, 0.09–
0.22).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Exercise and psychological interventions are effective 
for reducing CRF during and after cancer treatment, and they are significantly better than the 
available pharmaceutical options. Clinicians should prescribe exercise or psychological 
interventions as first-line treatments for CRF.
Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common and disabling adverse effects 
reported by patients with cancer during and after treatment.1–6 Cancer-related fatigue can 
persist for years after treatment completion4,6–11 and is exacerbated by co-occurring cancer-
related adverse effects such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and pain.3,4,12–18 
Cancer-related fatigue reduces a patient’s ability to complete medical treatments for cancer 
and participate in essential and valued life activities, thus undermining quality of life and 
potentially reducing overall survival.6,9,19 Cancer-related fatigue has been designated a high-
priority research area by the National Cancer Institute and is 1 of the 5 highest priority 
research areas designated by the National Cancer Institute Clinical Oncology Research 
Program in the United States.20
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have tested exercise, psychological, exercise plus 
psychological, and pharmaceutical interventions for the amelioration of CRF.21–35 Results of 
these RCTs are promising; however, development and implementation of guidelines for 
clinical practice36–38 are challenging owing to the lack of a direct meta-analytic comparison 
of these 4 most commonly recommended behavioral and pharmaceutical treatments for CRF. 
Although clinical practice guidelines exist for the management of CRF,36–38 which mode of 
treatment is most effective remains unclear.
To our knowledge, no prior review of CRF has applied meta-analytic methods to compare 
the efficacy of all 4 major types of treatments recommended for managing CRF, nor has any 
prior review systematically explored factors that are associated with treatment effectiveness 
(eg, age, type of cancer, during vs completed primary cancer treatment, study quality) when 
managing CRF. This information can enhance a personalized medicine approach when 
treating CRF and can inform future research.
The primary purposes of this meta-analysis were to (1) ascertain a more comprehensive and 
definitive estimate of weighted effect sizes for exercise (ie, aerobic, anaerobic or strength, or 
both), psychological (ie, cognitive behavioral, psychoeducational, or eclectic), the 
combination of exercise and psychological, and pharmaceutical interventions used to treat 
CRF; (2) to determine which of these 4 interventions significantly improves CRF; and (3) to 
compare the magnitudes of improvement in CRF produced by each intervention type. The

 secondary purpose was to identify independent variables associated with treatment efficacy 
for the management of CRF.
Methods
Search Strategy
Methods and reporting for this meta-analysis adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the recommendations of 
2 experts (D.M. and S.M.M.) in meta-analytic procedures on the team.39,40 We searched the 
following electronic databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane 
Library. Articles published in English between the inception of each database and May 31, 
2016, were searched for controlled-vocabulary terms specific to each database related to 
CRF, neoplasms, questionnaires, intervention strategies, and study design (eTable 1 in the 
Supplement).
Selection Strategy
Study selection strategy was rigorously defined. For inclusion, studies met the following 
criteria: (1) use of an RCT design, (2) adult (≥18 years) participants with cancer, (3) CRF 
severity measured as an outcome (eTable 2 in the Supplement for fatigue measures), (4) 
evaluation of CRF severity not solely as an adverse effect of cancer treatment, (5) no report 
on a pharmaceutical intervention that evaluated an erythropoietin drug because such drugs 
are used primarily for treating anemia and are not recommended as a stand-alone treatment 
for CRF due to adverse effects, (6) no report of a complementary and alternative 
intervention with the exception of exercise-based therapies (ie, yoga, tai chi), and (7) no use 
of reduced energy, vitality, or vigor as the fatigue outcome measure because these constructs 
are qualitatively different from CRF.41
Review Strategy
All reviews and data extractions were performed independently by at least 3 raters (includes 
all authors) considered experts in the field of cancer control and CRF. Data were 
extractedusing online coding and Excel programs (Microsoft, Inc) designed specifically for 
this project. The programs produced a list of data abstraction and coding discrepancies 
among reviewers. All discrepancies were resolved by independent third-party review and 
consensus; independent review was required for 6 studies, and 100% agreement was 
obtained for all 113 studies. Study investigators were contacted by standardized email letters 
at least 3 times to provide information omitted from published articles. To assess the 
methodologic quality of the studies, a modified 12-item version of the Physiotherapy 
Evidence-Based Database (PEDro) scale, developed using a Delphi expert consensus 
technique,42–44 was used because it identifies studies that are generalizable, internally valid, 
and statistically interpretable. The PEDro scale (range, 0–12, with 12 indicating highest 
quality) accounts for unique issues regarding blinding of the participant, assessor, or 
therapist in behavioral trials.42–44 Delineation of exercise interventions as aerobic, 
anaerobic, or both and psychological interventions as cognitive behavioral, 
psychoeducational, or eclectic was based on descriptions provided in the published articles.

 Statistical Analysis
Effect sizes (Cohen d) were computed as the mean difference in change from pretreatment to 
posttreatment between the experimental and control groups, divided by the pooled post-
intervention SDs. The effect sizes were combined across all intervention types with weights 
based on a random-effects model (Hedges random effects45) to facilitate generalizability of 
results and because we expected considerable heterogeneity.46 Owing to the smaller number 
of studies, we used fixed-effects models to combine effect sizes within each intervention 
type and to model predictors of intervention effectiveness. Cut points for determining small, 
moderate, and large effects were defined as 0 to 0.29, 0.30 to 0.59, and 0.60 or greater, 
respectively.47 Details for the computations are given online in the eMethods of the 
Supplement. All analyses were performed using the meta for package in R (version 3.2).48
Estimation of Intervention Effectiveness
Tests for significant differences between groups used a fixed-effects model for categorical 
independent variables. Method of moments estimation was used for analysis of continuous 
independent variables in the univariate metaregression.47 Variables to be tested for 
association with intervention effectiveness were selected a priori and included age, sex, 
cancer type, cancer stage, treatment status at baseline (ie, inpatient, outpatient, or mixed), 
experimental treatment format (ie, group or individual), primary delivery mode of 
experimental treatment (ie, in-person only, in-person plus other [eg, telephone calls, 
mailings, or web], or no in-person contact), exercise mode (ie, aerobic, resistance or 
nonaerobic, or combined), psychological mode (ie, psychoeducational, cognitive behavioral, 
or eclectic), type of control comparison (ie, no intervention, standard care, or wait-list vs 
placebo, time, attention, and education), allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, 
use of treatment fidelity protocol, PEDro scale quality score, and fatigue scale used.49–53
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted because of studies with multiple treatment conditions 
that resulted in 2 or more intervention comparisons (eg, treatment 1 vs control and treatment 
2 vs control) from the same study. To detect an artificial reduction of heterogeneity and a 
bias in the overall mean effect size, we conducted analyses in which we included only 1 
comparison per study at a time.
Bias Analyses
Publication bias was tested by examining funnel plots and the trim and fill procedure of 
Duval and Tweedie.54 To examine stability of the overall effect, fail-safe number was 
calculated to determine the number of studies with a null effect size that was needed to 
reduce the overall effect to nonsignificance.55
Results
Studies
We selected more than 17 033 titles and abstracts for initial review. An article was excluded 
if information in the title and abstract indicated it was not an RCT, it did not assess fatigue,

 or it used an ineligible intervention method. We selected 351 articles for full review. One 
hundred seventy-eight articles did not meet inclusion criteria (eg, nonrandomization, 
assessed vigor rather than fatigue, ineligible intervention method) and were eliminated; 60 
of the remaining 173 articles did not provide sufficient data for calculation of effect sizes, 
even after querying the authors multiple times. Ultimately, we analyzed 113 unique studies 
(eTable 3 in the Supplement) and calculated 127 effect sizes (14 articles had multiple 
treatment arms). Of these 127 effect sizes, 69 evaluated exercise interventions, 34 evaluated 
psychological interventions, 10 evaluated the combination of exercise and psychological 
interventions, and 14 evaluated pharmaceutical interventions. Figure 1 displays the PRISMA 
study selection flowchart.56,57
Participants
The 113 included studies yielded a sample of 11 525 unique participants (78% female and 
22% male). Fifty-three studies (46.9%) were performed among women with breast cancer 
and the remaining studies were performed among patients with other cancer types. Fifty-four 
studies included only women and 10 studies included only men. The mean age of 
participants was 54 (range, 35–72) years across all studies. Race, educational level, and 
partner status could not be accurately summarized owing to missing data. With regard to 
cancer stage, 50 studies (44.2%) enrolled patients with nonmetastatic cancer; 11 studies 
(9.7%), with metastatic cancer; and 33 studies (29.2%), with metastatic and nonmetastatic 
cancer. The remaining 19 studies (16.8%) did not provide staging information. With regard 
to primary treatments, 51 studies (45.1%) enrolled patients receiving primary treatment 
(defined as surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy) during the study intervention, 45 
studies (39.8%) enrolled patients who had already completed primary treatments, 15 studies 
(13.3%) enrolled patients of mixed treatment status (during and after primary treatment), and 
2 studies (1.8%) did not provide sufficient information on treatment status. Recruitment for 
these studies was conducted primarily in medical clinics using systematic screening and 
mixed recruitment strategies.
Intervention and Control Conditions
Mean (SD) sample size was 102 (95.5) at baseline with 47 (47.3) participants in the control 
groups and 57 (49.0) participants in the intervention groups at baseline. Mean duration of 
interventions was 14 (range, 1–60) weeks, included a mean of 43 (range, 1–364) sessions, 
and sessions lasted a mean of 60 (range, 16–150) minutes. With regard to control 
interventions, 77 studies (68.1%) used standard cancer care, no intervention, or waitlist 
control, whereas 36 studies (31.0%) used a placebo, time, attention, or education control. 
Two pharmaceutical studies tested paroxetine hydrochloride; 4, modafinil or armodafinil; 5, 
methylphenidate hydrochloride or dexymethylphenidate; 1, dexamphetamine; and 1, 
methylprednisolone. Thirty-six exercise studies tested aerobic modes of exercise, 13 tested 
anaerobic modes, and 20 tested a combination of aerobic and anaerobic modes. Nineteen 
psychological studies tested a cognitive behavioral method, 14 tested a psychoeducational 
method, and 1 tested an eclectic method (a unique combination of psychotherapeutic 
methods). Ten studies tested a combined exercise plus psychological intervention. Ninety-
nine studies used a traditional 2-arm RCT design (ie, intervention vs control), whereas 14

 studies used a 3-arm RCT design (ie, intervention 1 vs intervention 2 vs control). eTable 3 in 
the Supplement provides a detailed summary of all included studies.
Quality of Studies
The mean PEDro scale score for all studies was 8.2 (range, 5–12), suggesting that the 
studies were of good quality. In all 113 studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria for study 
participants were specified; random allocation was used for group assignment, and between-
group statistical comparisons were reported for CRF severity. Seventy studies (61.9%) used 
intention-to-treat analyses; 32 studies (28.3%) concealed allocation from participants or 
blinded outcome assessors; and 38 studies (32.7%) monitored treatment quality, fidelity, and 
drift.
Meta-analysis Main Effects
Changes in CRF by Intervention Type—We found significant moderate improvements 
in CRF (weighted effect size [WES], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24–0.43; P < .001) across all 113 
studies, including all 4 intervention types (ie, exercise [n = 69], psychological [n = 34], 
exercise plus psychological [n = 10], and pharmaceutical [n = 14] from before to after 
intervention). Studies that intervened with exercise demonstrated the largest overall 
improvement in CRF, with significant moderate effects (WES, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.25–0.36; P 
< .001). Studies using psychological interventions exhibited similar improvements in CRF 
(WES, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.21–0.33; P < .001). Studies that delivered the combination of 
exercise plus psychological interventions also exhibited similar improvements in CRF 
(WES, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13–0.38; P < .001). Pharmaceutical interventions yielded significant 
but very small improvements in CRF (WES, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.00–0.19; P = .05). 
Comparisons across all 4 intervention types revealed that exercise, psychological, and 
exercise plus psychological interventions produced significantly greater improvements in 
CRF compared with pharmaceutical interventions, with no other demonstrated differences 
between intervention types (Figure 2 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement depict forest plots).
Independent Variables Associated With Intervention Effectiveness—We tested 
whether each of 15 variables listed in the Methods section was associated with the 
effectiveness of all 4 intervention types for improving CRF per their WES (for all data and P 
values, see Table). Results suggest that intervention effectiveness is associated with the 
following 8 variables: cancer stage (nonmetastatic, metastatic, or mixed), treatment status at 
baseline (during primary treatment, after primary treatment, and mixed), experimental 
treatment format (group or individual), primary delivery mode of experimental treatment (in-
person, in-person plus other, or no in-person contact), psychological mode 
(psychoeducational, cognitive behavioral, or eclectic), type of control condition, use of 
intention-to-treat analysis, and fatigue scale used. Although improvements in CRF were 
reported by all patients and survivors, patients with early-stage (ie, nonmetastatic) disease 
and patients who had completed primary treatments (ie, surgery, chemotherapy, or 
radiotherapy) reported the greatest benefit. Interventions were the most effective for 
reducing CRF when delivered using group-based and in-person formats. The most effective 
type of psychological intervention for reducing CRF was cognitive behavioral therapy, and 
these interventions were most effective when implemented among survivors after primary

 treatment. Participants were also more likely to report the greatest reductions in CRF when it 
was measured using the Piper Fatigue Scale,49 the use of intention-to-treat analysis was not 
clearly stated, and the control condition was standard care. However, exercise and 
psychological interventions produced significant improvements in CRF, even when a 
rigorous specific-component (behavioral placebo) control comparison was used.
The following variables were not associated with intervention effectiveness: age, sex, cancer 
type (breast vs others), exercise mode (aerobic, resistance or anaerobic, or combined), 
allocation concealment, treatment fidelity protocol, or PEDro scale quality score. Patients of 
all ages and with all types of cancer equally experienced improvements in CRF. Aerobic and 
anaerobic exercise interventions were equally effective for treating CRF. However, exercise 
was most effective when prescribed for patients receiving primary treatment, whereas the 
combination of exercise plus psychological interventions was most effective when delivered 
in survivors after they received the primary treatment. Participants were also equally likely 
to report improvements in CRF regardless of allocation concealment, use of a treatment 
fidelity protocol, and PEDro scale quality score.
Publication Bias and Sensitivity Analyses—We found no evidence of publication 
bias per the funnel plot (eFigure 2 in the Supplement) and the trim and fill methods. The 
fail-safe analysis indicated that 6264 RCTs with null findings for CRF would have to be 
included in this meta-analysis to alter the reported conclusions. Sensitivity analyses revealed 
no substantial change in overall WES or WES by intervention type, indicating no artificial 
reduction of heterogeneity or bias when multiple intervention comparisons from the same 
study were included in the analyses.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the most comprehensive and rigorous conducted to 
date to examine the influence of exercise, psychological, exercise plus psychological, and 
pharmaceutical interventions on CRF. This meta-analysis is also, to our knowledge, the first 
to calculate WES across more than 110 well-designed RCTs testing the efficacy of the 4 
most recommended treatment intervention types for CRF. Our results demonstrate that 
exercise, psychological, and exercise plus psychological interventions are effective for 
improving CRF during and after primary treatment, whereas pharmaceutical interventions, 
as studied to date, are not. Exercise and psychological interventions are significantly more 
effective for improving CRF compared with pharmaceutical interventions overall.
In this meta-analysis, studies using the combination of exercise plus psychological 
interventions produced inconsistent results. In the studies we reviewed, the combination of 
the 2 interventions is sometimes equivalent to or inferior to a single modality. These 
combinations could be counterproductive owing to insufficient psychological content or 
exercise prescriptions and doses and added complexity and time demands leading to reduced 
adherence. These combinations also could be synergistic and provide patients with much 
needed motivation, specific and reasonable goals, and assistance with trouble-shooting 
barriers. With only 10 studies of exercise plus psychological interventions, we cannot

 determine whether these inconsistent results stem from inferior study quality or dose 
dilution effects. Additional research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.
This meta-analysis is the first to demonstrate that the effectiveness of CRF interventions is 
related to cancer stage, baseline treatment status, experimental treatment format, 
experimental treatment delivery mode, psychological mode, type of control condition, use of 
intention-to-treat analysis, and fatigue scale used. This meta-analysis is also the first to 
demonstrate that the effectiveness of behavioral interventions, specifically exercise and 
psychological interventions, is not attributable to time, attention, and education. In addition, 
this meta-analysis is also the first to show that certain intervention modes may be more 
effective for treating CRF at different points in the cancer treatment trajectory. For example, 
exercise may be the most effective treatment for patients receiving primary treatment, 
whereas psychological and exercise plus psychological interventions may be most effective 
for survivors who have completed primary treatment.
Strengths and Limitations
This meta-analysis has several strengths, including the large number of studies included (113 
studies and 127 effect sizes), a rigorous literature search by a team specializing in treatment 
or/and research of CRF; abstracting and consensus building of the data by highly qualified, 
experienced, and independent raters; adherence to stringent inclusion criteria and analytic 
methods; use of standard and valid measures of CRF severity; and examination of variables 
associated with intervention effectiveness. This meta-analysis also has limitations, most of 
which stem from the study designs and reporting methods in the published literature. For 
example, less than half of the studies provided detailed information on race, educational 
level, socioeconomic status, and other demographic factors, which limits the accuracy of the 
description of study participants and prohibits definitive conclusions regarding the 
generalizability of the results. Most of the studies are among patients with breast cancer or 
breast cancer survivors. Most studies did not screen for a specific level of fatigue as part of 
inclusion criteria or clearly designate the fatigue severity outcome as primary or secondary; 
moreover, these trials were not registered (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov) to provide reporting 
transparency. Only small numbers of published RCTs examined the combination of exercise 
plus psychological interventions and pharmaceutical interventions. Few studies use an 
appropriate control condition for specific components. Some studies were excluded because 
they were not written in English or because they did not include the basic statistics needed to 
calculate an effect size. Long-term follow-up (eg, 1–12 months) on continued adherence to 
the behavioral changes stemming from the interventions and their resultant effectiveness in 
treating CRF could not be examined owing to the lack of follow-up assessments and the 
inconsistency of assessment timing. Finally, as a limitation inherent to meta-analyses, 
residual confounding may result when combining WES across studies owing to distinct 
eligibility or other factors across studies (ie, participants were randomized within each study 
but not across studies).
Future RCTs need to provide demographic, medical, and statistical data to enable meta-
analysis (means and SDs at each point). Future RCTs needto register trials; implement CRF 
severity screening criteria; identify CRF as a primary outcome; design studies to test

 independent variables associated with intervention effectiveness; use appropriate specific-
component control conditions for comparisons; identify biomarkers of CRF; identify 
biological and psychosocial mechanisms of CRF and its treatment; identify new drugs, 
exercise, psychological, and combination interventions to test; and implement longer-term 
follow-up assessments at consistent times. Although the results of this meta-analysis are 
very informative, conducting more high-quality, phase 3 RCTs to test new treatment options 
and directly compare treatments with known efficacy for managing CRF is of critical 
importance.
Conclusions
These findings demonstrate that exercise and psychological interventions are effective for 
improving CRF during and after primary treatment, whereas pharmaceutical interventions 
are not. More research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of interventions that 
combine exercise and psychological treatments for CRF. Clinicians should prescribe 
exercise and psychological interventions as first-line therapy for patients experiencing CRF.

 Key Points
Question
Which of the 4 most commonly recommended treatments for cancer-related-fatigue—
exercise, psychological, the combination of exercise and psychological, and 
pharmaceutical—is the most effective?
Findings
This meta-analysis of 113 unique studies (11525 unique participants) found that exercise 
and psychological interventions and the combination of both reduce cancer-related 
fatigue during and after cancer treatment. Reduction was not due to time, attention, or 
education. In contrast, pharmaceutical interventions do not improve cancer-related fatigue 
to the same magnitude.
Meaning
Clinicians should prescribe exercise and/or psychological interventions as first-line 
treatments for cancer-related fatigue.
