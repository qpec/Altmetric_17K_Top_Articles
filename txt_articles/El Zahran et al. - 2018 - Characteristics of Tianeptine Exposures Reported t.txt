Tianeptine (marketed as Coaxil or Stablon) is an atypical 
tricyclic drug used as an antidepressant in Europe, Asia, and 
Latin America. In the United States, tianeptine is not approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use 
and is an unscheduled pharmaceutical agent* (1). Animal 
and human studies show that tianeptine is an opioid receptor 
agonist (2). Several case studies have reported severe adverse 
effects and even death from recreational abuse of tianeptine 
(3–5). To characterize tianeptine exposures in the United 
States, CDC analyzed all exposure calls related to tianeptine 
reported by poison control centers to the National Poison Data 
System (NPDS)† during 2000–2017. Tianeptine exposure 
calls, including those for intentional abuse or misuse, increased 
across the United States during 2014–2017, suggesting a pos-
sible emerging public health risk. Most tianeptine exposures 
occurred among persons aged 21–40 years and resulted in 
moderate outcomes. Neurologic, cardiovascular, and gastroin-
testinal signs and symptoms were the most commonly reported 
health effects, with some effects mimicking opioid toxicity. A 
substantial number of tianeptine exposure calls also reported 
clinical effects of withdrawal. Among 83 tianeptine exposures 
with noted coexposures, the most commonly reported coexpo-
sures were to phenibut, ethanol, benzodiazepines, and opioids.
CDC used NPDS data to review all tianeptine exposure 
telephone calls reported by U.S. poison control centers dur-
ing 2000–2017. Calls for drug information or identification 
were excluded. Trends in exposure by year were compiled for 
all tianeptine exposure calls and for calls related to intentional 
abuse or misuse. Descriptive statistics were compiled for all 
exposure calls by U.S. Census region (Midwest, Northeast, 
South, and West),§ caller source (self or health care profes-
sional), demographics (sex and age group), exposure type 
(intentional, unintentional, withdrawal, or unknown/other), 
exposure route (ingestion, parenteral, or inhalation), and 
* Drugs, substances, and certain chemicals used to make drugs are classified by 
the Drug Enforcement Administration into five schedules depending upon the 
drug’s acceptable medical use and the drug’s abuse or dependency potential.

† NPDS is a national database of information provided by the country’s regional 
poison centers serving all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and Puerto Rico. The American Association of Poison Control Centers 
maintains the database. NPDS case records are the result of call reports made 
by members of the public or health care providers. https://www.aapcc.org/

coexposures. Tianeptine-only exposures were defined as those 
that reported only tianeptine use with no other substances. 
Tianeptine-only exposures (excluding withdrawal-associated 
calls) were analyzed for reported related clinical effects by body 
systems, performed therapies, and level of care (evaluated, 
treated, and released from the emergency department (ED), 
admission to noncritical care units, admission to critical care 
units, or other).
Exposure medical outcomes were classified according to 
American Association of Poison Control Centers (https://www.
aapcc.org/) definitions as either no effect, minor outcome, 
moderate outcome, severe outcome, or death. Minor outcomes 
were defined as symptoms that were minimally bothersome 
to the patient, usually resolved rapidly, and often involved 
skin or mucous membrane manifestations, after which the 
patient returned to a preexposure state of well-being with no 
residual disability or disfigurement. Moderate outcomes were 
defined as symptoms that were more pronounced, more pro-
longed, or of a more systemic nature than minor symptoms 
but were not life threatening; usually requiring some form of 
treatment, after which the patient returned to a preexposure 
state of well-being with no residual disability or disfigure-
ment. Major outcomes were defined as symptoms that were 
life threatening or resulted in a significant residual disability 
or disfigurement. Withdrawal-associated tianeptine calls were 
analyzed separately for clinical effects and performed therapies. 
Summaries of two cases reported in 2016 are presented for 
illustrative purposes (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.
gov/view/cdc/57404).
Frequencies for categorical variables and mean values for 
continuous variables were calculated using statistical software. 
Tests for the trend for all tianeptine exposure calls and for calls 
related to intentional abuse or misuse during 2014–2017 were 
performed. Fisher’s exact test was used to test for associations 
between reported outcome severity and tianeptine-only expo-
sures versus tianeptine with coexposures, age group, and sex. 
Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.
During 2000–2017, NPDS received 218 calls related to 
tianeptine exposure, including one from outside the United 
States. Tianeptine-only exposures, excluding 29 withdrawal-
associated calls, accounted for 114 (52.3%) calls. During 
the first 14 years of the study period (2000–2013), NPDS 
received a total of 11 tianeptine exposure calls. From 2014

through 2017, there was a statistically significant increase in 
calls related to exposure (p<0.001) and intentional abuse or 
misuse (p<0.001). The total number of tianeptine exposure 
calls increased from five in 2014 to 38 in 2015, 83 in 2016, 
and 81 in 2017 (Figure). The majority of calls (91.2%) came 
from health care providers; by U.S. Census region, the highest 
percentage of calls came from the South (34.6%). Among 213 
(97.7%) exposure calls for which information on age was avail-
able, the mean age was 35 years (range = 1–80 years) (Table 1).
Among the 114 tianeptine-only exposures, excluding with-
drawal-related calls, the most commonly reported related clini-
cal effects were neurologic (48.3%), cardiovascular (32.5%), 
and gastrointestinal (10.5%) (Table 2). The most commonly 
administered therapies included fluids (35.1%), benzodiaz-
epines (27.2%), and oxygen (10.5%) (Table 2). Among the 105 
exposure calls for which level of care was reported, 46 (44%) 
persons were treated, evaluated, and released from the ED, 
and 25 (24%) were admitted to a critical care unit. Among the 
93 tianeptine-only exposures with a known medical outcome, 
50 (54%) had moderate outcomes. No deaths were reported.
Poison control centers reported 29 withdrawal-associated 
calls. Among those, tianeptine was the only substance reported 
to be associated with withdrawal in 21 (72.4%) calls; among 
those 21 calls, the most frequently reported signs and symp-
toms were agitation (33.3%), nausea (33.3%), vomiting 
(19%), tachycardia (19.1%), hypertension (14.3%), diarrhea 
(9.5%), tremor (9.5%), and diaphoresis (9.5%). The most 
frequently administered therapies included benzodiazepines 
(57.1%), fluids (38.1%), and antiemetics (19.1%).
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tianeptine is an antidepressant drug that is not approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical effects of tianeptine 
abuse and withdrawal can mimic opioid toxicity and withdrawal.
What is added by this report?
Tianeptine exposure calls to U.S. poison control centers increased 
during 2014–2017, suggesting a possible emerging public health 
risk. The associated health effects included neurologic, cardiovas-
cular, and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, with some effects 
mimicking opioid toxicity and withdrawal. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care provider and public education about adverse 
effects associated with tianeptine use is warranted. Health care 
providers and public health officials need to report adverse 
effects to the FDA MedWatch reporting system and contact 
poison control centers for clinical guidance. 
Among the 183 exposure calls with a known outcome, sig-
nificant associations were found between outcome severity for 
tianeptine-only exposures versus tianeptine with coexposures 
(p = 0.01) and between outcome severity and sex (p = 0.02). 
Persons reporting coexposure along with tianeptine were more 
likely to have major outcomes than those with tianeptine-
only exposures. Men were more likely than women to have 
a moderate outcome. No differences were found between 
outcome severity and age group (<20, 21–40, 41–60, and 
≥61 years) (p = 0.93).

Discussion
This study revealed a nationwide increase in tianeptine 
exposure calls and calls related to intentional abuse and misuse 
during 2014–2017. Approximately half of all reported expo-
sures occurred among users aged 21–40 years. The increase in 
exposures from 2014 to 2017 might be explained by a 2014 
study in animals and humans that showed that tianeptine is 
an effective mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonist (2). Deaths 
associated with misuse of tianeptine have been reported outside 
the United States (3,4). Recently, two deaths that were not 
reported to NPDS during the study period and were attributed 
to tianeptine toxicity were reported in the United States in 
persons who purchased the drug online (5).
Several case reports showed that tianeptine toxicity 
mimicked opioid toxicity and that naloxone was an effective 
therapy (6,7). Tolerance to tianeptine and withdrawal have 
been reported (8). Neonatal abstinence syndrome mimicking 
opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome has occurred after 
tianeptine dependence during pregnancy (9). This study 
further highlights that the withdrawal effects of tianeptine 
mimic those of opioid withdrawal.
Tianeptine has an abuse potential in former opiate drug 
users (3). In the country of Georgia, the health authority 
withdrew tianeptine from the market in June 2010, and the 
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
818 
MMWR / August 3, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 30

health authorities of Russia and Armenia classified tianeptine 
as a controlled substance in July 2010 (3). Similar measures 
were implemented in Ukraine in January 2011 (3). Although 
tianeptine is not FDA approved in the United States, it is 
readily available for purchase online as a dietary supplement 
or research chemical. Several online discussion forums among 
users describe the euphoregenic effects of tianeptine. Users 
have also reported combining tianeptine with other drugs like 
phenibut for a potentiated effect. In this study, among 83 calls 
with reported coexposures, phenibut (26 [31%]) was the most 
commonly reported coexposure with tianeptine. In light of the 
ongoing U.S. opioid epidemic, any emerging trends in drugs 
with opioid-like effects raise concerns about potential abuse 
and public health safety.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, NPDS relies on data voluntarily reported 
to poison control centers by health care providers and the 
public, who might not have reported all tianeptine exposures 
to poison control centers. Second, unintentional coding errors 
could have occurred during documentation. Finally, NPDS 
data provide only limited clinical information. For example, 
information on treatment response, length of hospital stay, or 
residual sequelae are not available.
This analysis highlights recent increases in reported tianep-
tine use and the potential for abuse and effects associated with 
withdrawal that can make it difficult to reduce or discontinue 
use. The associated outcomes and health effects associated 
with tianeptine use suggest a possible emerging public health 
risk and underscore the need for public outreach to increase 
awareness. Tianeptine testing is not routinely available, but 
specialty-testing laboratories might have that capacity. Health 
care providers and public health officials need to be vigilant 
for potential cases of tianeptine exposure and, when appli-
cable, report adverse effects to the FDA MedWatch reporting 
system (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm). 
Clinicians and other health care providers can contact their 
local poison control center by telephone at 1-800-222-1222 
for clinical guidance as needed.
