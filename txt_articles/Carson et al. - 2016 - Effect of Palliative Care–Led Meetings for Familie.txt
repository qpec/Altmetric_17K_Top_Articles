Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Family caregivers of patients with chronic critical illness experience significant 
psychological distress.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether family informational and emotional support meetings led 
by palliative care clinicians improve family anxiety and depression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A multicenter randomized clinical trial 
conducted from October 2010 through November 2014 in 4 medical intensive care units (ICUs). 
Adult patients (aged ≥21 years) requiring 7 days of mechanical ventilation were randomized and 
their family surrogate decision makers were enrolled in the study. Observers were blinded to group 
allocation for the measurement of the primary outcomes.
INTERVENTIONS—At least 2 structured family meetings led by palliative care specialists and 
provision of an informational brochure (intervention) compared with provision of an informational 
brochure and routine family meetings conducted by ICU teams (control). There were 130 patients

 with 184 family surrogate decision makers in the intervention group and 126 patients with 181 
family surrogate decision makers in the control group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale symptom score (HADS; score range, 0 [best] to 42 [worst]; minimal clinically 
important difference, 1.5) obtained during 3-month follow-up interviews with the surrogate 
decision makers. Secondary outcomes included posttraumatic stress disorder experienced by the 
family and measured by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R; total score range, 0 [best] to 
88 [worst]), discussion of patient preferences, hospital length of stay, and 90-day survival.
RESULTS—Among 365 family surrogate decision makers (mean age, 51 years; 71% female), 
312 completed the study. At 3 months, there was no significant difference in anxiety and 
depression symptoms between surrogate decision makers in the intervention group and the control 
group (adjusted mean HADS score, 12.2 vs 11.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.8 
[95% CI, −0.9 to 2.6]; P = .34). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were higher in the 
intervention group (adjusted mean IES-R score, 25.9) compared with the control group (adjusted 
mean IES-R score, 21.3) (between-group difference, 4.60 [95% CI, 0.01 to 9.10]; P = .0495). 
There was no difference between groups regarding the discussion of patient preferences 
(intervention, 75% control, 83% odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.16; P = .14]). The median 
number of hospital days for patients in the intervention vs the control group (19 days vs 23 days, 
respectively; between-group difference, −4 days [95% CI, −6 to 3 days]; P = .51) and 90-day 
survival (hazard ratio,0.95 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.38], P = .96) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among families of patients with chronic critical illness, 
the use of palliative care–led informational and emotional support meetings compared with usual 
care did not reduce anxiety or depression symptoms and may have increased posttraumatic stress 
disorder symptoms. These findings do not support routine or mandatory palliative care–led 
discussion of goals of care for all families of patients with chronic critical illness.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01230099
Patients are considered to have developed chronic critical illness when they experience acute 
illness requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation or other life-sustaining therapies but 
neither recover nor die within days to weeks.1 One-year survival is between 32% and 55%, 
and most patients require institutional care after hospital discharge.2,3 It is estimated that 
chronic critical illness affected 380000 patients in the United States in 2009, accounting for 
health-related costs of $35 billion or 1.4%of annual US health care costs.4
Family members of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience emotional distress 
including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).5,6 Studies have 
shown that communication of expected outcomes in patients with chronic critical illness is 
often inadequate to support surrogate decision making about goals of care.7,8 The resulting 
discordance between the expectations of clinicians and families can adversely affect the 
quality of family surrogate decision making and thus the treatment of patients with chronic 
critical illness.6,9,10
Clinical trials of interventions to improve communication about prognosis and goals of care 
in the ICU have shown mixed results,11–13 and none has focused on the high-risk population

 with chronic critical illness.14 Palliative care specialists are trained to provide emotional 
support, share information, and engage patients and surrogate decision makers in discussions 
of patient values and goals of care.15 To our knowledge, there have been no randomized 
clinical trials to determine if a palliative care specialist-led communication intervention for 
families of patients with chronic critical illness can improve both family- and patient-
centered outcomes.
To address this important evidence gap, a multicenter randomized clinical trial was 
conducted to determine the effect of informational and emotional support meetings for 
families of patients with chronic critical illness led by palliative care specialists on family- 
and patient-centered outcomes. We hypothesized that more intensive informational and 
emotional support during periods of decision making would reduce symptoms of anxiety 
and depression in families of patients with chronic critical illness compared with the routine 
sharing of information and support provided by ICU teams.
Methods
The study protocol (appears in Supplement 1) was reviewed and approved by the 
institutional review boards at each participating hospital. The informed consent form and 
process fully described the nature of the intervention, and consent was obtained from all 
family surrogate decision makers. For patient participation, written consent was obtained 
from legally authorized representatives when patients were incapacitated, and informed 
consent was obtained from the patients when their conditions improved. The primary 
surrogate decision maker was determined through discussions with the ICU physicians, 
nurses, and social workers, by review of the medical record, and by asking individual family 
members. A data and safety monitoring board reviewed the outcome data at predefined 
intervals.
Enrollment Criteria
Patients were enrolled from an urban tertiary care center in the northeastern United States 
and 2 tertiary care centers and a community hospital in the southeastern United States from 
October 2010 through November 2014. Patients aged 21 years or older treated in medical 
ICUs were eligible if they required at least 7 days of mechanical ventilation uninterrupted 
for 96 hours or longer and were not expected to be weaned or to die within 72 hours. For the 
first year of the study, patients were eligible if they required at least 10 days of mechanical 
ventilation. Patients were identified by screening of ICU records and discussion with ICU 
clinicians. Patients were excluded if he or she was mechanically ventilated at an outside 
hospital for longer than 7 days or had chronic neuromuscular disease, trauma, or burns 
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Patients also were excluded if a surrogate decision maker was not available or lacked 
English proficiency, the primary physician refused to grant permission to investigators to 
approach the patient or family, or the investigators were the attending physicians. Patients 
who were previously admitted to the study ICU or had a palliative care consultation prior to 
screening also were excluded. Family members were eligible if they had the responsibility of

 health care decision making for the patient, which sometimes included multiple family 
members if they participated together in the decision-making process.
After enrollment of patients and family members, patients were randomized to the 
intervention or the control group using a computer-generated, web-based randomization 
system with blinding of allocation. The randomization was stratified by study site in block 
sizes varying from 8 to 10. The research coordinator at each study site who had knowledge 
of group assignments was not involved in collection of the primary outcomes through family 
interviews. A research assistant at each study site who was blinded to group assignments 
conducted these interviews.
Intervention
A validated and widely available brochure describing chronic critical illness was provided to 
the family surrogate decision makers.16 Research coordinators then scheduled a minimum of 
2 meetings with the support and information team. These teams consisted of a palliative care 
physician and nurse practitioner and could include social workers, chaplains, or other 
disciplines as needed. Study investigators did not participate as support and information 
team members.
The first and second support and information team meetings were separated by 10 days, 
targeting 2 key time points. The first meeting was conducted after 7 days of mechanical 
ventilation at the onset of chronic critical illness and when a tracheostomy is often 
considered. The second meeting was conducted after further treatment was provided for a 
period approximating the mean duration of mechanical ventilation after tracheostomy for 
patients who achieve ventilator liberation.17 The protocol provided for scheduling of 
additional support and information team meetings between these time points at the request 
of the family, ICU physician, or support and information team clinicians.
Support and information team clinicians conducted pre-meetings with ICU physicians to 
review each patient’s condition, prognosis, and previous discussions of goals of care 
(eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2). In addition to prognostic information from the ICU 
clinicians, support and information team clinicians also reviewed estimates of 1-year 
prognosis based on the ProVent 14 score.2 The ICU clinicians could attend the support and 
information team meetings if desired. The support and information team meetings were 
structured according to a set of objectives and recommended topics7,13,18,19 (eAppendix 2).
Support and information team clinicians were trained by reviewing the main objectives of 
the meeting templates that appear in the original protocol in Supplement 1; however, they 
were allowed some flexibility for adapting the content of the meetings to the particular needs 
of each family. The ICU clinicians were blinded to the structured meeting templates for the 
intervention group. After the meetings with family members, the support and information 
team provided feedback to the ICU clinicians not in attendance. The ICU clinicians held 
additional family meetings as per their usual practice.

 Usual Care Control
The ICU clinicians managed all formal and informal family meetings per their usual practice 
without input from the palliative care specialists. Family surrogate decision makers in the 
control group received the same informational brochure (publicly available through the 
Society of Critical Care Medicine Website20 and available in the study hospitals throughout 
the study period) as the intervention group. Clinicians were able to formally consult 
palliative care clinicians at their discretion even if randomized to the usual care control 
group, and this was encouraged if they needed assistance with symptom management or for 
transfer to hospice.
Data Collection
Research coordinators interviewed family surrogate decision makers prior to patient 
randomization to collect demographics and prehospitalization activities of daily living21 and 
instrumental activities of daily living.22 Race was self-reported using fixed categories and 
obtained during the interviews with family members and was measured because of its 
association with higher symptoms of depression.23 Research coordinators measured fidelity 
to the meeting templates by completing a checklist of items covered by the end of the 
meeting. Investigators reviewed audio recordings for selected meetings.
Investigators periodically provided feedback on intervention fidelity to the support and 
information team members for quality control. Research coordinators blinded to group 
assignment interviewed surrogate decision makers immediately after the second support and 
information team meeting for the intervention group and 10 days after randomization for the 
control group, unless the patient had died. All surrogate decision makers were interviewed 
again by telephone for follow-up beginning 90 days after randomization.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
symptom score obtained during 90-day follow-up interviews with the family surrogate 
decision makers.24 The total HADS symptom score ranges from 0 (best) to 42 (worst) and 
there was a minimal clinically important difference of 1.5.25 Baseline HADS scores were 
measured prior to randomization. Secondary outcomes included PTSD symptoms of the 
surrogate decision maker at 90 days measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-
R)26 score (range, 0 [best] to 88 [worst]).
To assess patient-focused communication about the goals of care, an advance care planning 
domain from a modified version of the After-Death Bereavement Family Interview27 was 
used and the frequency and proportion of family members providing affirmative answers to 
each of the 3 yes or no questions were determined. This domain has been validated for 
independent administration. Although the original protocol specified 3 coprimary end points 
for anxiety and depression (HADS scores), PTSD (IES-R scores), and discussion of patient 
preferences, it was decided before enrollment that total HADS score should be the primary 
outcome, which is consistent with the power analysis. The trial registration reflected this 
change.

 The dimension scores for the After-Death Bereavement Family Interview were validated for 
use as a group and were calculated as the sum of negative responses to individual items 
within each domain divided by the number of items in the domain (ie, problem score) to 
assess patient-focused communication regarding the goals of care. A higher problem score is 
an indication of more opportunities to improve care or more concerns with the quality of 
care. A rating from the tool to assess overall patient-focused and family-centered care also 
was obtained (score range, 0 [worst] to 10 [best]).
Other measures included the Quality of Communication scale28 score (range, 0 [worst] to 10 
[best]; comments marked “did not ask”were coded as 0) used for surrogate decision makers 
who were available in the hospital after the intervention period. Satisfaction at 90 days was 
assessed using the 24-item Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit survey score 
(range, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]).29 Patient-focused outcomes included numbers of days of 
mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, limitations of ICU 
therapies (eg, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, nutrition, vasopressors), hospital mortality, 
and 90-day survival. Physician-surrogate discordance is not reported.
Statistical Analysis
Based on a previous study,25 it was determined that 150 family members in the intervention 
group and the control group would provide a sufficient sample to detect a minimal clinically 
important difference of 1.5 for mean total HADS score with 90% power and a type I error of 
5%. Additional patients and family surrogate decision makers were enrolled to allow for 
dropout and adjustment for multiple family respondents. Enrollment concluded at the end of 
the funded enrollment period. The HADS and IES-R scores were evaluated using 
hierarchical models based on the patient. For the primary analysis, the HADS score was 
adjusted for the baseline score and for multiple surrogate respondents. The IES-R was 
adjusted for multiple respondents.
In the post hoc analyses, the scores for HADS and IES-R also were adjusted for variables 
selected by the investigators based on their potential effects and included study site, race 
(white vs other), sex, and primary surrogate vs additional surrogate decision makers. The 
effect of patient death by the time of follow-up interviews and the effect of formal palliative 
care consultation were also assessed. The proportion of patients meeting diagnostic cutoffs 
for anxiety and depression (scores ≥8 for the HADS Anxiety and Depression subscales for 
both anxiety and depression, adjusting for baseline and for multiple surrogate respondents) 
and PTSD (scores >33 on the IES-R, adjusting for multiple surrogate respondents) were 
compared using generalized linear models allowing for random effects.
Data from the After-Death Bereavement Family Interview and Family Satisfaction in the 
Intensive Care Unit survey were adjusted for multiple surrogate respondents and study site. 
For the Quality of Communication scale, comments indicating “did not ask” were coded as 0 
and a summary measure of all items was adjusted for multiple surrogate respondents, 
baseline score, and study site. Differences between groups for other patient outcomes were 
analyzed based on t tests, nonparametric tests, χ2 tests (including the Fisher exact test), or 
log-rank tests as appropriate. The number of hospital days and 90-day survival rate were 
described using Kaplan-Meier plots. In addition, the differences between groups for 90-day

 survival were described based on the Cox model. Differences in the number of hospital days 
were analyzed using nonparametric methods.
All analyses were 2-tailed and performed on an intent-to-treat basis. The 2-sided level of 
significance was set at .05. There was no adjustment of significance threshold for secondary 
analyses, all of which should be viewed as exploratory. Analyses were performed using SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Of 366 eligible patients, consent was obtained for 256, all of whom were randomized 
(Figure 1). There were 365 family surrogate decision makers for a mean of 1.42 per patient 
(median, 1.0 [range, 1–6). There were no significant differences between patients in the 
intervention and control groups with the exception of slightly higher independence in 
activities of daily living in the intervention group (Table 1). There were no significant 
differences between groups in the demographics of family surrogate decision makers (Table 
2).
At least 1 support and information team meeting was held for 116 (89%) patients in the 
intervention group. Reasons for meetings not occurring included patient death or discharge 
prior to the scheduled meeting (n = 6) and family refusal or inability to participate (n = 8). 
Eighty-two percent of family surrogate decision makers in the intervention group 
participated in at least 1 support and information team meeting, and there was an average of 
1.4 meetings per surrogate. Support and information team clinicians addressed key topics 
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2) suggested in the study protocol (Supplement 1); however, they 
were allowed to use clinical judgment to adjust the discussion to meet the needs of 
individual patients and families.
Patient prognosis was discussed in 100% of the first support and information team meetings 
and in 91% of the second meetings. Understanding by the family of the patient’s values, 
goals, and preferences was discussed in 89% of the first support and information team 
meetings and in 81%of the second meetings. Physicians from the ICU attended 8.8% of the 
first support and information team meetings and 3.3% of the second meetings. A mean of 
1.9 family meetings was conducted independently by the ICU teams for families in the 
intervention group after randomization that were separate from the support and information 
team meetings; however, this was not significantly different than the number of family 
meetings (mean, 2.1 meetings) conducted by the ICU teams for families in the control group 
(between-group difference, −0.2meetings; 95% CI, −0.6 to 0.2 meetings).
Final interviews were completed for 312 family surrogate decision makers (85%) at a 
median of 105 days after randomization. There was no significant difference in the mean 
adjusted total HADS score at 3 months between the intervention group (12.2) and the 
control group (11.4; between-group difference, 0.8 [95% CI, −0.9 to 2.6], P = .34; Table 3). 
Adjusting for additional variables including study site, race, sex, primary surrogate, and 
patient death did not affect the difference in a meaningful way. Thirteen percent of patients 
in the intervention group had a formal palliative care consultation outside the study protocol

 compared with 22% of patients in the control group; however, adjusting for this variable had 
no significant effect on the between-group comparison. Limiting the analysis to those family 
members who participated in a support and information team meeting in the intervention 
group had no significant effect.
Symptoms of PTSD measured by the adjusted mean total IES-R score were significantly 
higher in the intervention group (25.9) compared with the control group (21.3) (between-
group difference, 4.60 [95% CI, 0.01 to 9.10], P = .0495; Table 3).Mean scores were 
significantly higher for the Avoidance subscale in the intervention group (8.8) compared 
with the control group (7.1; between-group difference, 1.70 [95% CI, 0.02 to 3.30], P = .
048) and for the Hyperarousal subscale (5.9 for the intervention group vs 4.4 for the control 
group; between-group difference, 1.5 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.8], P = .03). Conversely, the mean 
Intrusion subscale score was not significantly different for the intervention group (11.1) 
compared with the control group (9.7; between-group difference, 1.4 [95% CI, −0.6 to 3.4]; 
P = .17).
Adjusting for additional covariates in the post hoc analyses did not have a meaningful effect 
on the between-group differences (Table 3). Limiting the analysis to family members in the 
intervention group who received at least 1 support and information team meeting did not 
have a significant effect. Differences in the proportion of family decision makers who met a 
diagnostic cutoff for PTSD were not statistically significant (34% in the intervention group 
vs 25% in the control group; odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.90–2.60], P = .10).
For the main patient-focused communication outcome measure, nearly all family surrogate 
decision makers in both groups indicated that medical treatments and procedures had been 
discussed and were consistent with the wishes of the patients (Table 4). The proportion 
answering in the affirmative to all 3 preference measure questions (Did physician discuss 
patient wishes about medical treatment? Did physician discuss if care was consistent with 
patient wishes? Were all medical procedures and treatments consistent with patient wishes?) 
was not significantly different (75% of the intervention group vs 83% of the control group; 
odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.16], P = .14) when adjusting for multiple respondents 
and study site. There were no significant differences in any other dimension of the After-
Death Bereaved Family Interview (Table 4).
The median summary measure on the Quality of Communication scale (after adjusting for 
multiple family member surrogate decision makers, baseline score, and study site) was not 
significantly different between groups (8.05 for the intervention group vs 7.76 for the control 
group; between-group difference, 0.29 [95% CI, −0.63 to 1.21], P = .40). The mean scores 
on the Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit survey were not significantly different 
(81.1 for the intervention group vs 84.3 for the control group; between-group difference, 
−3.1 [95% CI, −7.3 to 1.0], P = .13; Table 4).
The median number of hospital days after randomization was not significantly different 
between the groups (19 days for the intervention group vs 23 days for the control group; 
between-group difference, −4 days [95% CI, −6 to 3 days], P = .51; Table 5 and Figure 2). 
Ninety-day follow-up was completed for all but 2 patients (99%) and 90-day survival was

 not significantly different between groups (hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.38], P = .
96; Figure 2). Post hoc adjustment for baseline activities of daily living and study site did 
not alter the outcome (hazard ratio, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.47], P = .96). There were no 
significant between-group differences for other patient outcomes including duration of 
mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, limitation of ICU treatments, and discharge 
disposition (Table 5).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized trial of a palliative care clinician-
based, informational, and emotional support intervention for family surrogate decision 
makers of patients with chronic critical illness. Protocol-based informational and emotional 
support meetings with palliative care specialists did not improve anxiety or depression 
symptoms among family surrogate decision makers at 3 months. Exploratory analyses 
indicate that the intervention may have increased PTSD symptoms. In addition, there was no 
significant effect on the patient and resource outcomes of duration of mechanical ventilation 
and hospital length of stay and there was no effect on survival.
Potential explanations for this lack of benefit may relate to the high perceptions of quality of 
communication, emotional support, and family satisfaction in the usual care control. When 
informational support provided by the primary team is sufficient, additional focus on 
prognosis may not help and could further upset a distressed family, even when emotional 
support is concurrently provided. Some early interventions (such as debriefing) intended to 
mitigate a major psychological trauma in other contexts may have paradoxically resulted in 
exacerbation of symptoms of PTSD at longer-term follow-up.30
Alternatively, the intervention may have been insufficient to overcome the high levels of 
family stress associated with having a relative with chronic critical illness. The support and 
information team intervention focused on providing informational and emotional support 
according to the study protocol for a sequence of 2 meetings. Support and information team 
clinicians may not have communicated qualitatively or quantitatively in the same way as 
they do in their regular palliative care consultations outside the research context; however, 
they were free to adapt their approach as needed for individual circumstances. The fidelity 
rate for some items on the meeting template suggests that they did indeed adapt freely.
It is also possible that the intervention was limited in its ability to have an effect on 
outcomes because it did not consistently provide continuity between admitting services and 
hospital units, or it lacked the full array of palliative care services, including more frequent 
support visits by team members, symptom management, and the added expertise of other 
disciplines, such as social work or chaplaincy. In addition, the absence of direct participation 
by ICU clinicians in most support and information team meetings could have created a 
discordance in communication with families that offset the positive effects of these 
meetings.
In the literature of ICU communication interventions, 1 randomized trial conducted in 
France,13 which included a family meeting and an informational brochure for families of

 patients at the time of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, showed significant 
improvement in anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. The intervention in this trial 
enrolled families earlier in the decision-making process, representing a distinctly different 
clinical situation.
Another trial that tested whether communication skills training for residents and nurse 
practitioners could improve family outcomes did not improve the quality of communication 
and was associated with increased depression symptoms.11 A trial that enrolled general 
patients in the ICU and involved trained communication facilitators as the intervention did 
not show a benefit in the level of family depression symptoms at 3 months but did show a 
benefit at 6 months; however, there were no effects on anxiety and PTSD.12 A lower follow-
up rate in that study could have introduced more response bias. Their results did show 
significant decreases in hospital length of stay for decedents. Decision making about 
continued intensive care for patients with chronic critical illness, all of whom have survived 
the acute phase of illness, may present greater challenges for successful interventions. 
Communication interventions that occur earlier rather than after 7 days of mechanical 
ventilation or that are more intensive might be required.
Chronic critical illness has been recommended as a trigger for specialist palliative care 
consultation to facilitate discussions regarding the goals of care.31–33 However, palliative 
care personnel are facing increasing clinical demands as the need for palliative services 
outpaces the rate of clinician training.34,35 Results of this trial indicate that routinely 
allocating scarce palliative care resources toward this large patient population may be 
ineffective if the interaction is limited to only 1 to 2 meetings. This does not mean that 
palliative consultation is not warranted in the support and communication for families of 
patients with chronic critical illness when particularly challenging cases arise or when 
assistance is needed for symptom management or hospital discharge disposition planning. 
Future research on communication interventions in the ICU should focus on identifying 
individual family decision makers who are at highest risk for poor emotional outcomes and 
targeting palliative care interventions to their specific needs. Interventions can include 
training and support to enhance primary palliative care by ICU clinicians.36,37
The multicenter randomized design, the variety of enrollment study sites, and the high 
participation and completion rates are strengths of this study, particularly considering the 
complex patient conditions and emotional states of families with patients being treated in the 
ICU.
Study limitations include the impossibility of blinding families to the intervention. However, 
research personnel conducting interviews were blinded to study group allocation, and bias 
would most likely favor the intervention, an unlikely occurrence given the findings. 
Although a halo effect or control group contamination could have biased the study toward 
the null, members of the ICU teams attended less than 10% of the support and information 
team meetings, and eligible patients were not enrolled when the investigators were providing 
care for them.

 Conclusions
Among families of patients with chronic critical illness, the use of palliative care–led 
informational and emotional support meetings compared with usual care did not reduce 
anxiety or depression symptoms and may have increased PTSD symptoms. These findings 
do not support routine or mandatory palliative care–led discussion of goals of care for all 
families of patients with chronic critical illness.

 Key Points
Question
Do palliative care–led informational and emotional support meetings improve anxiety 
and depression symptoms for family decision makers of patients with chronic critical 
illness vs usual care and communication by ICU clinicians?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial that included 365 family decision makers for 256 adult 
patients, family symptom scores for anxiety and depression were 12.2 for the intervention 
and 11.4 for usual care, a difference that was not significant.
Meaning
Palliative care–led information and support meetings for discussion of goals of care do 
not need to be routinely conducted for all family decision makers of patients with chronic 
critical illness.

The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range, 12 to 37 days) for the 
intervention group compared with 23 days (interquartile range, 12 to 39 days) for the control 
group (between-group difference, −4 days [95%CI, −6 to 3 days]; P = .51). For 90-day 
survival, the cross-hatches indicate censored events.
