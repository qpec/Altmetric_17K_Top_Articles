IMPORTANCE Medications that influence the risk of dementia in the elderly can be relevant
for dementia prevention. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for the treatment of
gastrointestinal diseases but have also been shown to be potentially involved in cognitive
decline.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between the use of PPIs and the risk of incident
dementia in the elderly.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a prospective cohort study using
observational data from 2004 to 2011, derived from the largest German statutory health
insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen (AOK). Data on inpatient and outpatient diagnoses
(coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision) and drug prescriptions (categorized according
to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) were available on a quarterly
basis. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2015.
EXPOSURES Prescription of omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or
rabeprazole.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was a diagnosis of incident dementia
coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. The association between PPI use and dementia
was analyzed using time-dependent Cox regression. The model was adjusted for potential
confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and polypharmacy.
RESULTS A total of 73 679 participants 75 years of age or older and free of dementia at
baseline were analyzed. The patients receiving regular PPI medication (n = 2950; mean [SD]
age, 83.8 [5.4] years; 77.9% female) had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia
compared with the patients not receiving PPI medication (n = 70 729; mean [SD] age, 83.0
[5.6] years; 73.6% female) (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.36-1.52]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The avoidance of PPI medication may prevent the
development of dementia. This finding is supported by recent pharmacoepidemiological
analyses on primary data and is in line with mouse models in which the use of PPIs increased
the levels of β-amyloid in the brains of mice. Randomized, prospective clinical trials are
needed to examine this connection in more detail.

P
roton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are indicated for the treat-
ment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic
ulcers.1,2 The use of PPIs has increased tremendously,
especially among the elderly.3,4 Proton pump inhibitors are
among the most frequently used classes of drugs.5,6 Within the
last 10 years, the prescription rate of PPIs increased 4-fold in
Germany7; in 2013, 3.178 billion defined daily doses were
prescribed.7 Observational studies8,9 have shown that about
40% to 60% of all PPI prescriptions were considered to be de-
tected as inappropriate, without adequate documentation for
a gastrointestinal diagnosis. There is evidence that PPI use
might affect cognition. Lam et al10 report a significant asso-
ciation of previous and current PPI use with vitamin B12 defi-
ciency in a population-based sample. Vitamin B12 deficiency
has been shown to be associated with cognitive decline.11 In
anotherstudy,12PPIswereobservedtoenhanceβ-amyloid(Aβ)
levels in the brains of mice by affecting the enzymes β- and
γ-secretase. Modulation of the degradation of Aβ by lyso-
somes in microglia could be another functional aspect of the
enrichment of Aβ levels by PPIs.13-16
We analyzed detailed data from a prospective, longitudi-
nal, multicenter cohort study of elderly primary care pa-
tients, the German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia
in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe),17 including 3327 commu-
nity-dwelling persons 75 years of age or older. Follow-up as-
sessments in the AgeCoDe study17 were conducted every 18
months. The interviews included detailed neuropsychologi-
cal testing and a detailed recording of medical history and
medication. Taking into account a large number of potential
confounding factors such as age, sex, educational level, apo-
lipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele status, depression, diabetes,
stroke, ischemic heart disease, and polypharmacy, we de-
tected a significant association between PPI use and incident
dementia in the AgeCoDe study17 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38 [95%
CI, 1.04-1.83]). In the present study, we used a large longitu-
dinal data set from routine claims data to investigate the in-
fluence of PPI use on the risk of incident dementia and, thus,
confirm our previous findings.
Methods
Sample and Study Design
Analyses were conducted on a longitudinal sample of elderly
patients from the largest German statutory health insurer, All-
gemeine Ortskrankenkassen (AOK). The data include in-
formation on age, sex, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses
(categorized according to the German modification of the In-
ternational Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes), and drug
prescriptions (categorized according to the Anatomical-
Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] Classification System codes) on
a quarterly basis for the years 2004-2011. To compare the re-
sultsofthepresentanalysiswithpreviousresultsfromtheAge-
CoDe study,17 for which follow-up assessments took place
every 18 months, we aggregated the data into intervals start-
ing with a 1-year baseline in 2004, followed up by 18-month
intervals. Owing to the data structure, the last interval (2011)
comprises only 12 months. Data access was legally approved
by the Wissenschaftliches Institut der Ortskrankenkassen. The
study is based on anonymized administrative claims data that
never involved patients directly. Individual patients cannot be
identified, and the analyses presented do not affect patients
whose anonymized records were used.
Selection Criteria
Inclusion criteria consisted of age at the beginning of the study
of 75 years or older, no data inconsistencies, and no dementia
or death in the baseline interval. A diagnosis of dementia is de-
fined as documented with one of the following ICD-10 codes:
G30, F00, F01, F03, F05.1, G31.1, G31.82, and G31.9. We con-
sidered the dementia diagnosis to be valid (incident demen-
tia) if it was reported in at least 2 of the 6 quarters of an 18-
month interval. We did not differentiate between dementia
subtypes.
Exposure Assessment
Use of a PPI was defined as at least 1 prescription per quarter
of omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or
rabeprazole (ATC codes A02BC01-05). We defined regular PPI
use as a PPI prescription in each quarter of an interval, and we
defined no use as no prescription in an interval at all. Patients
with occasional PPI use (defined as a PPI prescription in 1-5
quarters of an interval) were excluded. We selected patients
with either no use or regular use in all intervals for the analy-
sis. Use of a PPI was included in the analysis as a time-
dependent variable. The end of an observation was defined as
the first occurrence of dementia, death, or the end of the study
(year 2011). For the evaluation of the use of a single PPI, we de-
fined the regular use of a single PPI in each quarter of an
interval.
Potential Confounding Factors
To address potential bias, we selected a priori a number of po-
tential confounding factors that were plausible factors to
modify the risk for incident dementia and that have also been
used in the previous analysis of the AgeCoDe study17 for which
information was available. We introduced the following
confounding factors into the analysis as covariates: age, sex,
polypharmacy (defined as ≥5 drug prescriptions besides the
PPI),andthecomorbiditiesofstroke(ICD-10codesI63andI64),
Key Points
Question: Is there an association between the use of proton pump
inhibitors (PPIs) and the occurrence of dementia in the elderly?
Findings: In this cohort study including more than 70 000
participants and using longitudinal observational data derived
from the German statutory health insurer Allgemeine Ortskran-
kenkassen (AOK), elderly patients 75 years of age or older
receiving PPI medication had a significantly increased risk of
incident dementia compared with patients 75 years of age or older
not receiving PPI medication.
Meaning: The restricted use of PPIs may help prevent the
development of dementia.

ease (ICD-10 codes I20-22, I24, and I25), and diabetes (ICD-10
codes E10-E14).
Diagnoses were considered present if reported in at least
2 quarters of a 12- or 18-month interval. We selected only pa-
tients with valid information on the absence or presence of all
comorbidities in all intervals before the censoring.

dition, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) without covariates.
All calculations were performed using SAS for Windows

statistically significant.
Results
The study population consisted of 218 493 persons 75 years of
age or older at the beginning of the study period in 2004
(Figure 1). Of those 218 493 persons, 144 814 were excluded af-
ter quality-control filtering (104 because of incomplete or in-
consistent data, 24 346 because they died in 2004, 36 634 be-
cause they received a diagnosis of dementia in 2004, 17 722
because they received only 1 assured dementia diagnosis, and
66 008 because they did not regularly use PPIs). We detected
29 510 patients who developed dementia during the study pe-
riod. Of those 29 510 patients, 9056 (30.7%) received a diag-
nosis of unspecified dementia only (ICD-10 code F03), 805
(2.7%) received a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease only (ICD-10
codes F00 and G30), 1834 (6.2%) received a diagnosis of vas-
cular dementia only (ICD-10 code F01), 24 (0.1%) received a
diagnosis of delirium with dementia only (ICD-10 code F05.1),
387 (1.3%) received a diagnosis of senile degeneration only
(ICD-10 codes G31.1 and G31.9), and 17 404 (59.0%) received a
diagnosis of at least 2 different types of dementia. Because of
the large amount of diagnoses of unspecified and mixed de-
mentias, we did not differentiate between the dementia sub-
types in the following analyses.
Regular PPI use (ie, at least 1 PPI prescription in each quar-
ter of an 18-months interval) was observed for 2950 persons
(Table 1). Omeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole were
the most prescribed PPIs with regular use among 1340, 659,
and 308 patients, respectively (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The data on regular PPI users indicate that there are relatively
low numbers of regular users who use additional PPIs (with an
average number of quarters per person of 1.0-2.0; eTable 1 in
the Supplement). The characteristics of PPI users and nonus-
ers are given in Table 1 for Cox regression with time-
dependent covariates. The use of PPIs was associated with a
significant increased risk of incident dementia (HR, 1.44 [95%
CI, 1.36-1.52]; P < .001) (Table 2). The occurrence of incident
dementia with the use of PPIs was slightly more pronounced
in male (HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.33-1.74]) rather than female pa-
tients (HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.33-1.51]). Of the potential confound-
ing factors that were included in the analysis, depression
(HR,1.28[95%CI,1.24-1.32])andstroke(HR,1.37[95%CI,1.29-
1.46) showed the highest risk increase for incident dementia.
Also, age per year had a considerable effect on risk of demen-
tia(HR,1.083[95%CI,1.081-1.085]).Theotherfactorsthatwere
included elevated the risk of dementia only slightly but sig-
nificantly (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.11-1.18] for female sex; HR, 1.05
[95% CI, 1.02-1.08] for diabetes; and HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.13-
1.19] for polypharmacy). Data on patients with ischemic heart

disease showed a minor reduction in the risk of dementia (HR,
0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95]). Visualization of the association of
PPI use and incident dementia as survival function is given in
Figure 2. Exclusion of all potential confounding factors re-
sulted in a slightly higher HR for the association between PPI
use and incident dementia (HR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.57-1.76])
(Table 2).
The inclusion in the model of a specific drug class (namely,
anticholinergic drugs) that was shown to affect cognitive
performance18 resulted in nearly the same outcomes for PPI
use (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.36-1.53]; P < .001) and for the other
covariates(datanotshown).Weincludedanticholinergicdrugs
with a high anticholinergic activity (levels 3 and 4 according
to Chew et al19). As expected, anticholinergic drug use itself
was a risk factor for incident dementia (HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.65-
1.96]; P < .001).
To examine the effect of the duration of PPI exposure, we
analyzed occasional PPI use (defined as a PPI prescription in
<6 quarters within an interval). We observed a lower HR for
occasional PPI use (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.13-1.19) (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
For the 3 most prescribed PPIs (omeprazole, panto-
prazole, and esomeprazole), we performed subgroup analy-
ses. Including all previous covariates, we detected a similar
elevated risk of dementia for omeprazole (HR, 1.51 [95% CI,
1.40-1.64]) and pantoprazole (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.40-1.79]) and
aslightlymorepronouncedriskincreaseforesomeprazole(HR,
2.12 [95% CI, 1.82-2.47]) (eTable 3 in the Supplement; for
sample characteristics of the subgroup analyses, see eTables
4-6 in the Supplement).
For an age-group analysis, we divided the sample into 3
groups (75-79, 80-84, and ≥85 years). The risk of incident de-
mentia with the use of PPIs gradually decreased with age (HR,
1.69 [95% CI, 1.49-1.92] for 75-79 years; HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.35-
1.66] for 80-84 years; and HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43] for ≥85
years) (Table 3). Also, the effect of the potential confounding
factors such as depression, diabetes, stroke, and polyphar-
macy decreased with age (Table 3).
Discussion
Dementia is characterized by cumulative cognitive decline and
a progressive inability to live independently. Analyses of data
from the German statutory health insurance system showed
that the prevalence of dementia increases with age.20 About
one-third of Germans who are 90 years of age will have
dementia.20 The global prevalence of dementia will increase
from about 35 million people today to more than 80 million
people in 2040.21,22 Besides the substantial burden on pa-
tients and their families, dementia also affects health care sys-
tems worldwide. Dementia therapies and care have a notable
socioeconomic impact. In the year 2010, the estimated world-
wide cost of dementia was $604 billion.23 The largest effect
on the reduction of the occurrence of dementia has been re-
ported to be primary prevention (namely, reducing the risk of
dementia).24 Therefore, an effective step for dementia pre-
vention is to detect risk factors for dementia in people at in-
creased risk (ie, the elderly). Often used drugs are of special

interest as risk factors for dementia in the elderly, especially
data on the consequences of their long-term use.
Our analysis of the AOK data set revealed a significant in-
creased risk of dementia (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.36-1.52]) with the
useofPPIs.Thus,theresultsconfirmthefindingsfromourpre-
vious study with the AgeCoDe data set (HR, 1.38 [95% CI,
1.04-1.83]).17 The subgroup analyses for the 3 most often used
PPIs (omeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole) showed
similar effect sizes, with a slightly more pronounced risk of de-
mentia by use of esomeprazole. The underlying mechanism
by which PPIs might influence the development of dementia
is yet to be determined. There is evidence that links PPI
intake with cognitive decline. First of all, some PPIs (eg, lan-
soprazole and omeprazole) have been reported to cross the
blood-brain barrier, and so they are able to directly affect the
brain.25,26 Badiola et al12 showed that PPIs may be able to in-
teract with brain enzymes. They observed increased Aβ lev-
els in an amyloid cell model and in the brains of mice after PPI
treatment.12 They suggest a mechanism of inverse γ-secre-
tase modulation in combination with an augmented β-secre-
taseBACE1activitythatleadstoanaccumulationofAβlevels.12
Aβ peptides are a major pathological sign of dementia in the
course of Alzheimer disease.27
AnotherexplanationfortheenrichmentofAβbyPPIsmight
involve a modulation of degradation of Aβ by lysosomes in
microglia.13FibrillarAβclearancebymicrogliaispH-dependent,
and this process is induced by acidification of lysosomes.
Vacuolar-typeH+–adenosinetriphosphatase(V-ATPase)proton
pumpsmediatethisacidification,14andPPIshaveinhibitoryprop-
erties at V-ATPases.15 As a result, PPIs may contribute to the
inhibition of acidification, reduced Aβ degradation, and
enhanced Aβ levels.16 A further hint of a possible involve-
ment of PPIs in cognition is given in a study by Lam et al,10 in
which an association of previous and current PPI use with
the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency is reported (odds ratio,
1.65 [95% CI, 1.58-1.73]). Poor vitamin B12 status has been
described as negatively affecting cognition and promoting
neurological damage, probably owing to impaired DNA syn-
thesis, methylation, and homocysteine neurotoxicity.28,29
For the claims data analysis, we were able to include al-
most all of the potential confounding factors that have also
been included in the analysis of the AgeCoDe study.17 The 2
exceptions are the ApoE4 allele status and educational level,
variables for which we lack claims data. Of the included co-
variates, age per year, stroke, depression, diabetes, and poly-
pharmacy all significantly elevated the risk of dementia. This
is in line with the results of the data analysis of the AgeCoDe
study,17 in which age per year, stroke, depression, and diabetes
weresignificantlyassociatedwithriskofdementia,whilepoly-
pharmacycontributedtoanelevatedriskofdementiathatfailed
to be statistically significant. Female sex was slightly but sig-
nificantly associated with an increased risk of dementia in the
claimsdataanalysis;inthedataanalysisoftheAgeCoDestudy,17
there was no clear sex-specific signal for incident dementia.
The HRs in our study were very similar to those in the data
analysis of the AgeCoDe study17 for age per year (1.083 [95%
CI, 1.081-1.085] vs 1.12 [95% CI, 1.10-1.15]) and polypharmacy
(1.16 [95% CI, 1.13-1.19] vs 1.14 [95% CI, 0.92-1.42]). The in-
creased risk of dementia with regard to the comorbidities of
stroke and diabetes was less pronounced (by 25%-50%) in the
claims data analysis. For depression, the value for the HR was
1.0 higher in the data analysis of the AgeCoDe study17 com-
pared with the claims data analysis. This might be explained
by the comprehensive and detailed neuropsychological as-
sessments performed for the AgeCoDe study,17 whereas the di-
agnosis of depression can be overlooked during a routine gen-
eral practitioner visit, a situation that is reflected in the AOK
data. The covariate ischemic heart disease was not signifi-
cantlyassociatedwithdementiainthedataanalysisoftheAge-
CoDe study17 but showed a HR of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.95) in
the claims data analysis. This effect might be attributed to the
concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medication.
Population-based studies have shown that antihypertensive
drugs such as calcium channel blockers and renin-

angiotensin system blockers can be beneficial in preventing
cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly.30
The age-group analysis revealed that the risk of incident
dementia with the use of PPIs gradually decreased with age,
withthehighestHRintheage-groupof75to79years.Thesame
was true for potential confounding factors such as depres-
sion and stroke, which also showed lower effect sizes with in-
creasing age. This might reflect the decreasing influence of ex-
ternal and internal factors on dementia progression with age,
possibly owing to an already initiated disease process.
To address the possibility that regular PPI users might have
a higher chance of receiving a diagnosis of dementia owing to
an increased use of the health care system, we defined the per-
centage of quarterly data entries during the whole study pe-
riod (2004-2011) as a proxy variable for use of the health care
system in general. We observed an average percentage of 94%
and93%ofquarterlydataentriesforregularPPIusersandnon-
regular PPI users, respectively. Thus, both groups regularly use
the health care system, with the differences between the
groups being negligible and not likely to have caused a more
likely dementia diagnosis for PPI users.
Our study has several strengths. The sample of patients is
a population-based sample and covers longitudinal data from
2004 to 2011 extracted from the largest German mandatory
public health insurer, the AOK. The AOK comprises one-third
of the German population and as much as 50% of the elderly
population.31 This allowed us to perform the analysis in a real-
life setting in an unselected patient population. Health claims
data cover the total population, including people who live in
institutions such as assisted living or nursing homes. In addi-
tion, selection bias or recall bias was avoided because of the
use of routine database records.
On the other hand, there are also limitations that have to
be taken into account when interpreting the results. Residual
confounding in claims data is a concern that cannot be ruled
out completely. However, we have adjusted our analysis by
including several potential confounding factors, such as
age, sex, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Other risk fac-
tors for dementia (eg, ApoE4 allele carrier or lower educa-
tional level) could not be integrated into the analysis
because the AOK claims data lack genetic information or
detailed sociodemographic parameters. Because we ana-
lyzed claims data with a high rate of diagnoses of unspeci-
fied and mixed dementia, we were not able to differentiate
between different dementia etiologies, such as dementia in
the course of Alzheimer disease or vascular dementia. How-
ever, because we found in the analysis of the data from the
AgeCoDe study17 only subtle differences between the results
of patients with all different types of dementia and the
results of patients with dementia in the course of Alzheimer
disease, and because mixed dementia forms outweigh pure
dementia forms,32,33 this fact should not be a major limita-
tion in the present analysis.
Conclusions
We analyzed a large longitudinal German claims data set and
confirmed the results of our previous analysis on a smaller pri-
mary data set that PPI use is associated with an increased risk
of incident dementia. Thus, the avoidance of PPI medication
may contribute to the prevention of dementia. The present
study can only provide a statistical association between PPI
use and risk of dementia. The possible underlying causal bio-
logical mechanism has to be explored in future studies. To
evaluate and establish direct cause and effect relationships be-
tween PPI use and incident dementia in the elderly, random-
ized, prospective clinical trials are needed.
