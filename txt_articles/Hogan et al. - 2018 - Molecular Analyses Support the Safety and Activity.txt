Abstract
Purpose: Toca 511 is a gammaretroviral replicating vec-
tor encoding cytosine deaminase that selectively infects
tumor cells and converts the antifungal drug 5-fluorocy-
tosine into the antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil, which
directly kills tumor cells and stimulates antitumor immune
responses. As part of clinical monitoring of phase I clinical
trials in recurrent high-grade glioma, we have performed
extensive molecular analyses of patient specimens to track
vector fate.
Patients and Methods: Toca 511 and Toca FC (extended-
release 5-fluorocytosine) have been administered to 127 high-
grade glioma patients across three phase I studies. We mea-
sured Toca 511 RNA and DNA levels in available body fluids
and tumor samples from patients to assess tumor specificity.
We mapped Toca 511 integration sites and sequenced inte-
grated Toca 511 genomes from patient samples with detect-
able virus. We measured Toca 511 levels in a diverse set of
tissue samples from one patient.
Results: Integrated Toca 511 is commonly detected in
tumor samples and is only transiently detected in blood in
a small fraction of patients. There was no believable evidence
for clonal expansion of cells with integrated Toca 511 DNA, or
preferential retrieval of integration sites near oncogenes. Toca
511 sequence profiles suggest most mutations are caused by
APOBEC cytidine deaminases acting during reverse transcrip-
tion. Tissue samples from a single whole-body autopsy affirm
Toca 511 tumor selectivity.
Conclusions: Toca 511 and Toca FC treatment was not
associated with inappropriate integration sites and clonal
expansion. The vector is tumor-selective and persistent in
patients who received Toca 511 injections. Clin Cancer Res;

Introduction
Given the limits of conventional cancer treatments, retroviral
replicating vectors (RRVs) have emerged as a potential backbone
for useful therapies across a wide range of oncologic malignan-
cies. RRVs selectively infect tumor cells without directly lysing
them. This differentiates them from directly oncolytic and
highly inflammatory viruses such as adenovirus and herpes
viruses (1–3). Thus, RRVs provide a platform for therapies based
on tumor-specific gene delivery strategies without the inherent
limitation of rapidly killing infected cells. RRV are selective for
tumor cells partially due to virus-selective advantages in the
tumor
microenvironment
from
blunted
innate
immune
responses as well as suppressed adaptive immune responses
relative to normal dividing cells (3–6). Viral dependency on
mitosis for integration contributes to cancer cell selectivity (7),
and the noninflammatory nature of the infection (and replica-
tion competency) allows subsequent spread (8).
Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) is a RRV derived from
a murine gammaretrovirus (gRV), with an amphotropic enve-
lope to allow infection of human cells. Such viruses are known
to be nonpathogenic to humans (9), and all adult humans so
far tested appear to be seropositive (10, 11). The modified
Toca 511 virus encodes a transgene for an optimized yeast
cytosine deaminase (yCD2) that converts the orally available
prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU; refs. 12–14).
Three phase I clinical trials, NCT01156584 (Study 8),
NCT01470794 (Study 11) and NCT01985256 (Study 13), eval-
uated safety of Toca 511 and Toca FC (an extended-release
formulation of 5-FC) therapy in patients with recurrent high-
grade glioma (HGG) by different routes of Toca 511 administra-
tion, followed by oral Toca FC dosing. In Study 8, Toca 511 was
administered by injection into the tumor, without resection. In
Study 11, tumor resection was performed, followed by multiple
injections of Toca 511 into the tissue walls of the resection cavity
(9). In Study 13, intravenous administration of Toca 511 (bolus
injections for one, three or five consecutive days) was followed by
surgical resection plus additional injections of Toca 511 into the
tissues of the resection cavity 8 to 14 days later (clinical results
from Study 13 will be presented elsewhere). For all trials, 4 to 6
weeks after the final Toca 511 administration, patients were

 treated with Toca FC for approximately one week, in repeated
cycles, every 4 to 8 weeks, for 6 months, or until radiologic
evidence of tumor progression, clinical progression, or termina-
tion by treating physicians (Fig. 1A).
Historical safety concerns are associated with different retrovi-
ral nonreplicative vectors (RNV). For instance, RNV preparations
grossly contaminated with replicative murine leukemia virus
(MLV) derived from recombination during serial passage through
ecotropic and amphotropic murine cell–derived packaging cell
lines were employed for ex vivo transduction of hematopoietic
stemcells (HSC) followed by autologous transplant into monkeys
(15, 16). Three of 10 monkeys so treated, who were unable to
develop antiviral immune responses, developed lymphomas
containing multiple copies of an array of MLV related sequences
in the tumor genomes. A second source of concern was the
observation, following transplant of autologous cytokine-stimu-
lated HSCs transduced ex vivo with RNV, of delayed occurrence of
lymphoma in some clinical trial patients several years after
treatment (17–19). T-cell lymphoma was linked to treatment of
X-linked
Severe
Combined
Immune
Deficiency
Syndrome
(X-SCIDS) with the common gamma chain interleukin receptor
and Wisckott–Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) gene replacement, which
in turn were linked to insertions near the promoter for LMO2,
leading to its ectopic expression. Myelodysplastic syndrome was
linked to treatment of chronic granulomatous disease and inser-
tion and activation of MDS-EVI-1 oncogene (19, 20). However, a
therapy based on RNV transduction and reimplantation of autol-
ogous HSCs for ADA deficient SCIDS has not shown such side
effects, and was recently approved for sale in Europe (Strimvelis,
GSK Ltd.; ref. 18). In addition, long-term outcomes with persistent
RNV transduced T cells have also failed to show such side effects
(21). These observations suggest that such adverse outcomes are
influenced by factors including multiplicity of infection, nature of
the transgene, indication, clinical condition, and age of the
recipient, expected mechanism of action of the transgene, and
target tissue (17, 22).
Several methodologies have been developed to track the fate of
viral vectors in patients. Viral RNA and DNA levels can be
measured over a broad dynamic range with qPCR. Viral integra-
tion sites, originally identified by Sanger sequencing of cloned
PCR products (23), can be systematically mapped via next-gen-
eration sequencing (24–26).
While previous gRV trials used RNVs, often transducing autol-
ogous cells ex vivo, Toca 511 is a RRV used to infect cancer cells in
vivo. Thus, host immunity to viral proteins and virus–host restric-
tion factor interactions may influence Toca 511 spread and
activity (27). For instance, APOBEC proteins target a number
of retroviruses in humans, causing G to A hypermutation via
processive cytidine deamination during reverse transcription
(28, 29). The influence of APOBEC proteins on Toca 511 in
patient samples can be measured via next-generation sequencing.
In addition, RNVs (unlike RRVs) usually lack genes to produce
viral proteins that could stimulate immune responses against
infected cells. Thus, Toca 511 therapy requires an overlapping
but distinct set of assays for molecular monitoring than those
used in RNV trials.
In this study, we report results of Toca 511 monitoring in blood
and tumor samples from patients who received Toca 511 through
direct injection into the resection cavity (Study 11) and intrave-
nous delivery (Study 13) 8 to 14 days prior to tumor removal
(additional Toca 511 is delivered via direct injection into the
resection cavity), as well as analyses of tissue from a full autopsy
of a patient that participated in a phase III clinical study
(NCT02414165) and received Toca 511 injection into the HGG
resection cavity. Our monitoring methods include Toca 511
quantification, identification of genome integration sites, and
mutation profiles of Toca 511 genomes from available Toca
511–positive tumor tissue and blood cells. This work provides
molecular and genomic corollaries to traditional safety assess-
ments and presents a framework for clinical monitoring of RRV
therapies during initial development, allowing for continued
confidence in using such vectors in patients.
Patients and Methods
Toca 511 quantification
DNA and RNA purification. DNA and RNA were extracted from
the same source (tumor or whole blood) using a modified
version of Promega's Maxwell 16 Purification System as com-
municated by the manufacturer. Tumor sections were minced
in petri dishes on dry ice and transferred into 1.5 mL microfuge
tubes. A total of 500 mL of homogenization/1-thioglycerol
solution were added into each tube and the test articles were
agitated with pestles (VWR: catalog no. 47747-366) followed
by vortexing at full speed for 30 seconds. For whole-blood
DNA and RNA purification, up to 200 mL of whole blood
(brought to 200 mL with PBS if necessary) was transferred into
1.5-mL microfuge tubes. A total of 300 mL of homogenization/
1-thioglycerol solution was added to the tube and vortexed at
full speed for 30 seconds. In each case, 300 mL of the homog-
enate was transferred into Maxwell 16 DNA Purification car-
tridges and subjected to automated DNA purification. Purified
DNA was eluted in 300 mL of nuclease-free water. For RNA
purification, 200 mL of lysis buffer was added into the 1.5-mL
microfuge tubes containing the remaining 200 mL of the
original 500-mL homogenate. Test articles were vortexed for 30
seconds and the full volume was transferred into Promega's
Translational Relevance
Retroviral replicating vectors (RRVs) are potential therapies
for a wide range of oncologic malignancies, with ongoing
durable responses and multiyear survival outcomes for some
recurrent high-grade glioma patients in a phase I trial. Detailed
characterization including viral presence in biological fluids
and cancer cells, viral insertion site location and clonality, as
well as viral sequence stability are important to support future
approval of biologic therapies built on RRVs. Previous treat-
ment-related adverse events, including lymphomas, in some
clinical trials with distinct nonreplicating retroviral vectors
were preceded by clonal expansion of infected cells due to
integration near a proto-oncogene. As part of our ongoing
development of RRV Toca 511 in recurrent high-grade glioma,
we performed extensive monitoring of the virus in patient
tumors and body fluids, including Toca 511 quantitation,
integration site identification, and mutation profile character-
ization. Our results support the favorable safety profile of Toca
511 and expansion of clinical trials into other indications.
Moreover, this work provides a broad framework for molec-
ular monitoring of RRV therapies during clinical development.

RNA purification was carried out and purified RNA was eluted
in 50 mL of nuclease-free water. RNA purification from
plasma, urine, and saliva and IHC of CD gene were described
previously (4).
qPCR. TaqMan probe-based qPCR was performed as single-tar-
geted 20 mL reactions for Study 11 test articles and as multiplex
reactions for Study 13 test articles. The reactions were prepared in
triplicate, on a CFX96 or CFX384 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad)

terminal repeat region of Toca 511 or in the yCD2 transgene
(monoplex) or in sequences in the amphotropic MLV4070A ENV,
POL, and yCD2 transgene (multiplex). Primers and probes were
designed with PrimerQuest software and synthesized by Integrat-
ed DNA Technologies. For qPCR detection of gRV-specific
sequences, primers were used at final concentration of 300
nmol/L each of MLV-F (50- AGC CCA CAA CCC CTC ACT C-
30) and MLV-R (50- TCT CCC GAT CCC GGA CGA-30), and 100

 Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 95�C for 5 minutes,
followed by three cycles of 95�C for 15 seconds and 65�C for 10
seconds, followed by 38 cycles of 95�C for 15 seconds and 65�C
for 30 seconds. CFX Manager 3.0 software (Bio-Rad) was used to
calculate threshold cycle (Ct) values. Technical replicates were
averaged and absolute quantification was determined from linear
regression using a six-log serial dilution standard curve (25 to
2.5e6 copies/reaction) from a Toca 511–containing plasmid,
pAZ3-yCD2.
qRT-PCR. TaqMan probe-based qRT-PCR was performed as sin-
gle-targeted 20-mL reactions for Study 11 test articles and as
multiplex reactions for Study 13 test articles. The reactions were
prepared in triplicate using primers and probes annealing to
sequences in POL (monoplex) or to sequences in the ampho-
tropic MLV4070A ENV, POL, and yCD2 (multiplex).
For simultaneous qRT-PCR detection of POL, ENV, and yCD2
in a single reaction, primers were used at 300 nmol/L each of Pol2-
F (50-CAA GGG GCT ACT GGA GGA AAG-30) and Pol2-R (50-CAG
TCT GGT ACA TGG AGG AAA G-30); 100 nmol/L of Pol2 hydro-

Env2-F (50-ACC CTC AAC CTC CCC TAC AAG T-30) and Env2-R
(50-GTT AAG CGC CTG ATA GGC TC-30); 100 nmol/L of Env2
hydrolysis probe (50-TEX615/AGC CAC CCC CAG GAA CTG GAG

TCA TCA GCT TCT TAC-30); and 100 nmol/L of yCD2 hydrolysis
probe (50-FAM/TCA TCG TCA ACA ACC ACC ACC TCG T/
30BHQ_1) were used with AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent
(Life Technologies; either the Pol2 or Pol3 primer/probe set was
used as a component in the triplex reaction).
Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 46�C for 20 minutes,
followed by 95�C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95�C
for 15 seconds and 55�C for 45 seconds. Absolute quantification
was determined from linear regression on a seven-log serial
dilution RNA standard curve (2.55e2 to 2.55e8 copies/mL) puri-
fied from Toca 511 viral vector containing the corresponding
targets that underwent qRT-PCR in parallel with the test articles.
The Toca 511 standard was originally qualified by comparison
with an in vitro–synthesized RNA standard quantified by absor-
bance at 260 nm.
Identification of Toca 511 integration sites
Preparation of sequencing libraries. A total of 100–1,000 ng of
genomic DNA (isolated as described above) was sheared using
Covaris E220 to 300 bp peak size. Following cleanup with
Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), DNA was end repaired
(End-It DNA End-Repair Kit, Epicentre), a 30 overhang A was
added (NEBNext dA-Tailing Module, New England Biolabs), and
partially double stranded adaptors (Adaptor1 þ Adaptor 2) were
ligated with T4 ligase (Quick Ligation Kit, NEB). Two rounds of
PCR were performed using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master
Mix. The second round of PCR included primers with barcoded
Illumina adaptors. Following clean-up with Ampure XP beads,
libraries were quantified by qPCR and Qubit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and pooled for paired-end sequencing on Miseq or
Hiseq 2000.

Trimmed and filtered fastq files were mapped to the human
(hg19) and Toca 511 genomes using Bowtie2 (for human
genome: -q -X 2000 –no-mixed –no-discordant –no-unal
–score-min L,0,-0.4; ref. 31). Sorted BAM files were filtered to
remove read pairs in which at least one of the reads contained at
least two mismatches to the reference genome in the first ten
bases using RSamtools (32). Filtered BAM files were converted
to BED files (Bedtools; ref. 33) and read pairs with the same
start and end positions (� 2 bp) were collapsed. We removed
read pairs that shared the same integration site but that had a
different fragmentation site in cases in which the fragmentation
read site accounted for less than 1% of total integration events
at this site. We did this because we found that most (or all)
cases were likely due to spurious PCR products created from
PCR duplicates of a single integration event. Integration sites
that contained sequence motifs enriched in sequences adjacent
to integration sites from negative controls, identified using
HOMER2, were removed (34). These motifs contained matches
to the 30 end of Toca511 PCR_2 primer and/or the Toca 511
integration footprint (TTTCA). Finally, we filtered out integra-
tion events in which another sample had the same integration
site and fragmentation site in at least 100� greater abundance,
which was likely due to index primer misidentification during

Toca 511 sequencing
Full-length PCR for sequencing. PCR for full-length amplification

Tri Set 3-reverse (50- GAGTGAGGGGTTGTGGGCTCT-30). Primers
for nested PCRs (8349 bp) were designed to anneal internally to
the primary amplicons and were used at 400 nmol/L each: 50 long
PCR sequencing primer-forward (5-TGGTAGGAGACGAGAACC-
TAAA-30)and 30 UCLA3-37 IRES-reverse (50-CCCCTTTTTCTGGA-
GACTAAATAA-30). Genomic DNA (up to 400 ng) for the primary
PCR or primary PCR reaction (1 mL) for the nested PCR, long mix
buffer (containing 25 mmol/L MgCl2), dNTPs (500 mmol/L each),
DMSO (2%), primers (400 nmol/L), and LongRange Enzyme Mix
(1 U) were combined and PCRs initiated. Primary PCR: thermal
cycling conditions consisted of one cycle of 93�C for 3 minutes, 20
cycles of 93�C for 15 seconds, 55�C for 30 seconds, 68�C for 9
minutes, followed by one cycle of 93�C for 15 seconds, 55�C for
30 seconds, 68�C with 20-second incremental increases from
previous time, for an additional 15 cycles. For nested PCR,
thermal cycling conditions consisted of one cycle of 93�C for 3
minutes, 35 cycles of 93�C for 15 seconds, 60�C for 30 seconds,
and 68�C for 8 minutes.
Tripartite PCR for sequencing. PCR for tripartite amplification of
Toca 511 was performed with three sets of overlapping primers.
Primers were utilized at 150 or 400 nmol/L each: upstream
sequence (2356 bp), 713_LTR Set 2-forward (50-CGGGGGTC-
TTTCATTTGGGG-30) and Tri Set 1-Reverse (50ACAGTCTG-
GTACATGGAGGAAAG-30); middle sequence (4842 bp), 50

downstream sequence (3797 bp), Set 14-forward (50- AGC CTT
CCC AAC CAA GAA AGA-30) and Set 14-reverse (50- AGC TAG CTT
GCC AAA CCT ACA-30). Reactions were prepared as 25-mL ali-
quots with LongRange PCR Kit as described above. Thermal
cycling conditions consisted of one cycle of 93�C for 3 minutes,
followed by 30 cycles of 93�C for 15 seconds, 60�C for 30 seconds,
and 68�C for 4 minutes.
Preparation for sequencing. Following the nested PCR, products
were separated on 1% TAE ethidium bromide agarose gels and
bands corresponding to the expected size were excised and puri-
fied according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gel PCR Puri-
fication Kit: Qiagen). Quantification of purified PCR products was
performed using QuantiFluor dsDNA (Promega) on an Infinite
M200 Plate Reader (Tecan).
Purified PCR products were prepared for sequencing using
Nextera XT kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Pooled libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (2 �
75 base reads) at University of California San Diego IGM
facility. Fastq files are available from NCBI SRA database
(SRP149280).
Toca 511 sequence analyses
PCR duplicates were removed with PRINSEQ-lite 0.20.4 (37).
Read pairs were quality trimmed with Cutadapt (-q 30,30 –min-
imum-length 30) and mapped to the Toca 511 genome using bwa
mem 0.7.15-r1140 using default parameters (38). SNVs and
indels were identified with Varscan 2.3 (P ¼ 0.01; min-coverage
500; min-avg-qual 25; min-var-freq 0.01; ref. 39) from Samtools
(40) generated mpileup files (-d 20000). The resulting VCF files
were parsed, combined, and analyzed in R using custom scripts.
Plots for figures were made with ggplot2.
yCD2 sequencing
Primers used to amplify the yCD2 coding region included
Illumina Nextera XT universal primer sequences at their 50 ends:
50-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG CACGGG-
GACGTGGTTTTCCTT-30 and 50- GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATG-
TGTATAAGAGACAGTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCATTCC-30. Prima-
ry PCR was performed with 400 nmol/L of each primer using
Qiagen Long Range PCR kit components. PCR products were gel
purified and a secondary PCR was performed with Nextera XT
dual-indexed primers to prepare samples for sequencing. Samples
were pooled and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (2 � 300 base
reads). Adaptors were removed from sequencing reads with
Cutadapt. Reads were quality trimmed with Trimmomatic
v0.32 (SLIDINGWINDOW:30:30; ref. 41) and then mapped to
Toca 511 genome with bwa mem as described above. SNVs were
identified with Varscan2 as described above. Fastq files are avail-
able from NCBI SRA database (SRP149351).
Patient autopsy samples
The whole-body autopsy patient was a 65-year-old male with
a past medical history of left temporal anaplastic astrocytoma
with transformation to glioblastoma (GBM) status postresec-
tion. The patient completed Toca 511 dosing and a single cycle
of Toca FC. Main study informed consent was reviewed and
received approval from Western Institutional Review Board,
which allows Tocagen to request tissues from an autopsy case.
Full autopsy consent was obtained by the investigators at
UTHealth. Samples were collected approximately 40 days after
the last dose of Toca FC. Tissue and biofluids samples were
collected as follows: brain -adjacent, tumor – noninjected site
A, tumor – noninjected site B, tumor – noninjected site C,
tumor injection site A, tumor injection site B, tumor injection
site C, 1 mL blood, 1 mL urine, skin, lower GI, testes, liver,
spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, spinal cord, lung - left
lower lobe, lung - Lobe Consolidation, CSF.
The brain autopsy was from an 80-year-old male with a past
medical history of GBM and recurrent GBM postresection. Sam-
ples from the following locations were collected: contralateral
templobe (amygdala), ipsilateral frontal cortex (sagittal), anterior
half (putamen and internal capsule), posterior half, posterior
tumor, posterior tumor (slightly more anterior), anterior tumor
(presumed injection site), anterior tumor (presumed injection
site, slightly more posterior).

 Results
Toca 511 is transiently detected in blood in a small subset of
patients in Study 11
In Study 11, surgical resection was followed by multiple injec-
tions of Toca 511 into the walls of the resection cavity; 4–6 weeks
later, Toca FC dosing started (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 9). To
quantitatively measure Toca 511 DNA and RNA levels over a
broad dynamic range, robust [reverse-transcription (RT)]-qPCR
assays that utilized a six-log standard curve for absolute quanti-
fication were developed (see Materials and Methods). The esti-
mated lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the qPCR assay is
25 viral genome copies per reaction, whereas the LLOQ for the RT-
PCR assay is approximately 7,300 viral RNA copies per mL of
plasma. As part of Study 11, we performed Toca 511 qPCR on
DNA isolated from whole blood as well as qRT-PCR on total RNA
isolated from plasma, urine, and saliva, sampled longitudinally
starting just prior to Toca 511 treatment and continuing at
intervals over the course of treatment, including > 500 DNA and
RNA test samples across 56 patients (Fig. 1A – red lines; ref. 9).
Samples that were within the quantitative range of the assay, as
defined above, were considered detected.
Quantitative Toca 511 RNA signal was rarely detected in urine
or saliva samples but was detected in 32 plasma samples collected
from 22 of 56 patients tested (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supple-
mentary Dataset S1) and rapidly cleared. Sixteen of the positive
RNA samples from plasma were detected from samples collected
one day after surgery (visit 2). This is probably too early for
infection and viral replication to occur and likely represents
leakage of the injected vector into the blood stream following
surgery. Thirteen patients had positive RNA signal at times after
visit 2, occurring between day �10 (visit 3) and week 6(visit 5).
We detected Toca 511 in DNA isolated from blood in 15
samples collected from 11 patients (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Dataset S1). Detection of Toca 511 DNA in whole blood did not
correlate with patients' Toca 511 dose level (Supplementary
Dataset S1). In all cases, quantitative signal occurred between
week 4 (visit 4) and week 10 (visit 7; Fig. 1B). Patients begin taking
Toca FC at week 6 (visit 5) and it is likely this helped clear virus
from the blood. Even in cases in which integrated Toca 511 was
detected, overall levels were low; the maximum DNA signal was
3,400 copies per mg of genomic DNA (�2 copies per 100 diploid
genome equivalents; Fig. 1B and D). In summary, virus was well
controlled as it was infrequently and only transiently detected in
the patients' blood with quantitative Toca 511 signal in 6% of
plasma samples and 3% of whole blood samples.
Toca 511 infects patients' HGG tumors
While it was not feasible to systematically measure Toca 511
levels in residual tumors from patients in Study 11, we obtained
tumor samples from 8 patients in Study 11 for whom their tumor
recurred following Toca 511 and Toca FC treatment and the tumor
was subsequently resected (re tumor samples in the figures). We
detected Toca 511 in DNA isolated from three of seven tumors
tested. Two of these patients' tumors had both quantifiable Toca
511 DNA and RNA signal (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Dataset S1), It
is likely viral levels in these tumors are not representative of the
initial uptake in the patient population as Toca FC treatment is
expected to deplete Toca 511-expressing cells; moreover, one
reason for tumor recurrence would be from a paucity of Toca
511-infected cancer cells.
In Study 13, recurrent HGG tumor was resected 8 to 14 days
after the initial day of intravenous administration of Toca 511,
additional Toca 511 was injected into the resected cavity
followed by Toca FC treatment 4 to 6 weeks later (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Table S2). Appropriate qPCR was performed on
DNA and RNA isolated from multiple tumor pieces (referred to,
herein, as intravenous tumor samples; Fig. 1A). For 8 of the 17
patients given intravenous Toca 511, integrated Toca 511 was
detected in at least one tumor piece (Fig. 1C), at levels up to
47,000 copies per mg of DNA (�31 copies per 100 diploid
genome equivalents; Fig. 1D; Supplementary Dataset S1). We
detected Toca 511 RNA isolated from tumor samples in 9
patients,
including
6
patients
whose
tumors
also
had
quantifiable levels of integrated Toca 511 (Supplementary
Dataset S1). The first two low-dose patients showed no quan-
tifiable signal for DNA or RNA in their tumors. At the third,
fourth, and fifth dose levels with 1-, 3-, or 5-day administration
respectively, Toca 511 was detected in 11 of 15 tumors. These
results suggest that Toca 511 gains access to the brain tumor
after virus infusion into peripheral blood and can successfully
deliver therapeutic transgenes.
Toca 511 integration patterns are tissue specific and consistent
with previous analyses of gammaretroviral integration
Identification of integration sites in samples with few integra-
tion events per hundreds of genomes is challenging and we
optimized an integration site enrichment procedure and sequenc-
ing analysis workflow to reliably do so (Supplementary Text,
Supplementary Figs. S2–S4). We distinguished clonal events from
PCR duplicates by virtue of having the same integration site, but
different fragmentation site, as is standard (e.g., refs. 42–44). Nine
blood samples from Study 11, and 10 tumor samples from study
13 with quantifiable Toca 511 signal were analyzed along with
three negative controls (DNA isolated from human cells not
exposed to Toca 511; Fig. 2A). The three negative controls yielded
zero, three, and eight "integration events," respectively (from
millions of sequencing reads); these events were likely created
from spurious priming by the Toca 511-specific nested primer in
locations of the human genome that happened to be immediately
followed by the four bp Toca 511 integration sequence. Patient
samples generally had orders of magnitude more read pairs that
mapped to the human genome than the negative control samples,
yielding on average 34 integration events per blood sample and
165 integration events per tumor sample for a total of 1,984
measured integration events across all tumor samples tested
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S5).
Given gRVs' preference to integrate near the 50ends of tran-
scriptionally active units, as also observed for Toca 511 in cell
culture (Supplementary Fig. S3D), we predicted there would be
enrichment of Toca 511 integration sites near annotated mRNA
transcription start sites (TSS) from patient samples. For these
analyses we combined integration sites from blood and integra-
tion sites from tumor into two pools of data. We plotted the
distribution of integration sites adjacent to annotated TSSs and
observed a characteristic enrichment centered around TSSs in
both blood and tumor samples, albeit with a shallower peak
than observed in cell culture (Fig. 2B). For both blood and tumor,
14% of integrations occurred within 5 kb of the nearest annotated
TSS (vs. 5% expected on the basis of random chance; P ¼ 0.03 and
P < 1e�5 for blood and tumor, respectively based on proportions
test). We asked whether genes proximal to integration sites

 [immediately upstream (within 10 kb) or within the gene] encode
proteins that are functionally linked to the site from which
samples were taken; blood or brain tumor. Utilizing the hundreds
of GO and REACTOME gene sets (45, 46), we found that brain
tumor–derived integration sites preferentially occurred near genes
involved in neuronal functions and growth/differentiation, while
blood-derived integration sites preferentially occurred near genes
linked to blood functions (Fig. 2C). Thus, Toca 511 integration
site preferences from patient tumor and blood transduced in vivo
are congruent with previous work on gRVs showing preference for
sites of active transcription ex vivo and in mice (25, 26).
Absence of compelling evidence for clonal expansion of
Toca 511-integrated cells
The degree to which integration sites are unique versus sub-
clonal expansion is key to assess the putative risk of insertion
mutagenesis leading to hyperproliferation. An abundance of
unique integration events would also indicate viral spread within
the tumor versus expansion of one to a few tumor cells with
integrated genomes. For each sample, we determined the number
of sites with two or more integration events and plotted the results
as a fraction of all integration events (Fig. 3A). For samples with at
least 20 identified integration events, multiple events from the
same site comprised fewer than 5% of the total, with one excep-
tion, from patient 11_33 visit 4a blood (not shown in Fig. 3A).
Follow-up analyses suggest this potential clonal expansion, which
occurred in an Alu element, was a technical artifact caused by
recombination with other Alu elements during PCR (Supplemen-
tary Text; Supplementary Fig. S6).
Given the precedent for clonal expansion due to integration of
gRVs adjacent to oncogenes, particularly LMO2, we determined
whether there was a preponderance of sites adjacent to or within
various classes of cancer-related genes, in both blood and tumor.
We found some integration events within 10 kb of oncogenic
drivers or tumor suppressor genes in blood or tumor (Fig. 3B).
There was one integration site in blood (11_05 visit 7) near a
lymphoma-linked gene, NKAIN2/TCBA1, which encodes a trans-
membrane protein that interacts with the beta subunit of a
sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (47). There was no
observed clonal expansion from this integration event and like
all other patients, detectable Toca 511 signal was undetectable
after Toca FC treatment. These results are consistent with the lack

patients after Toca 511 delivery to date and the paucity of Toca
511-infected cells in all patients' blood samples (9).
Toca 511 genomes are mutated by restriction factors in patients
We previously reported Toca 511 gross genome stability in vitro
across multiple passages of the virus in cell culture (13). In the
clinical setting, Toca 511 was PCR-amplified from patient DNA
samples using a single nested PCR that spanned 9 kb of the
genome including all coding regions, or three overlapping PCR
products that spanned the same region (Supplementary Fig. S7).
PCR products were gel purified and those with sufficient material
were prepared for Illumina sequencing. We obtained quality
sequencing results (> 1,000� coverage across at least 6,000 bp)
from three blood samples, 6 samples from re-resected tumors, 6
tumor samples following intravenous treatment, and 4 nonclin-
ical samples, including two cell lines (HT-1080 and U-87MG)
infected with Toca 511 and two plasmids containing the parental
Toca 511 genome.
Following quality filtering and read mapping to the Toca 511
reference genome, we characterized the mutation profiles of the
Toca 511 genomes from each sample using Varscan2 (39),
which identifies both single nucleotide variants (SNV) and
short insertions and deletions (indels; Fig. 4; Supplementary
Fig. S8). At a mutation frequency threshold of 3%, there were
four SNVs and zero indels in the two plasmid controls and U-
87MG–infected cells. These mutations were previously identi-
fied shared silent point mutations from the initial cloned MLV
genome from which Toca 511 was derived (48) and were
removed for subsequent analyses. There were two additional
SNVs in the HT-1080 control sample, both occurring at less
than 5% frequency. In contrast to the plasmid and cell culture
samples, there was a wide spectrum of mutations among
patient samples. Total SNVs per sample ranged from 31
(11_33 blood visit 7) to 742 (11_02 re-tumor section 8; mean
¼ 204; Fig. 4A and B). Indels were much less frequent than
SNVs (Supplementary Fig. S8). There were generally more SNVs
and indels in Toca 511 genomes from re-resected tumors versus
tumors resected prior to Toca FC treatment and blood, which
could reflect more rounds of infection and replication and/or
enrichment of nonfunctional Toca 511 following Toca FC
treatment (patient 11_02 took one cycle of Toca FC while
patient 11_31 took three cycles of Toca FC).
Next we asked whether there was a bias in the mutation patterns
among SNVs, which may suggest underlying mechanisms of
mutation. For each sample, we calculated the fraction of all SNVs
corresponding to each of the twelve possible pairwise combina-
tions. As shown in Fig. 4C, an overwhelming majority of SNVs
corresponded to three of four possible transitions: G to A, A to G,
and T to C. For 11 of 13 samples, the majority of SNVs were G to A
transitions, which is commonly seen in retroviral mutation pro-
files due to APOBEC cytidine deaminase-mediated C to U transi-
tions during reverse transcription (Fig. 4D; refs. 28, 29). G to A
transitions were more likely to occur at higher frequency than
other transitions in nine samples (Dunn test, P < 0.001). These
results suggest that APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination dur-
ing reverse transcription contributes to Toca 511 mutation spec-
trum in both patient blood and tumors, but that its influence
varies among samples.
G to A mutations can create premature stop codons in Toca 511
The abundance of SNVs in integrated Toca 511 genomes
from patient samples raises the question as to what degree these
mutations inactivate the vector. We focused our attention on
nonsynonymous mutations caused by G to A transitions due
their abundance. What stood out was the potential for the
codon encoding tryptophan (TGG) to be converted to stop
codons (STOP - TGA, TAG, and TAA) by any combination of G
to A at the second or third position. Toca 511 contains 52
tryptophan codons: 12 in gag, 24 in pol, 14 in env, and 2 in
yCD2. We calculated the frequency of G to A mutations in
tryptophan codons and plotted the results for each sample as a
heatmap (Fig. 5A). There were a number of sites in the genome
with high frequency tryptophan to STOP that occurred in
multiple samples. There were 10 samples with at least one
tryptophan to STOP at 30% frequency or greater (Fig. 5B).
Coinciding with increased mutation accumulation and/or
selection for nonfunctional Toca 511 genomes, tryptophan to

 STOP was more abundant in samples from tumors re-resected
following repeated cycles of Toca FC treatment. The most
common tryptophan to STOP mutation was in amino acid
10 (W10) in yCD2, which was mutated in 8 samples at > 30%
frequency. This mutation, occurring near the 50 end of yCD2
coding sequence presumably eliminates functional yCD2 pro-
tein unless an alternative start codon rescues function; for
instance, the closest downstream methionine is at amino acid
15. W10 is immediately adjacent to the first alpha helix and is
conserved in orthologs from closely related fungal species
(Supplementary Fig. S9; ref. 49). The next two most frequent
mutations affected W804 and W1016 in pol. W804 to STOP
occurred in three re-resected tumors and five tumors resected
prior to Toca FC treatment, while W1016 to STOP occurred in
one blood, three re-resected tumors and two tumors resected
prior to Toca FC treatment.
To corroborate these results we performed targeted sequenc-
ing on the yCD2 coding region (Supplementary Text; Supple-
mentary Fig. S10). According to the targeted yCD2 sequencing
results at least 30% of yCD2-coding sequences were functional
in 10 of 16 samples isolated from tumors following intrave-
nous treatment, 1 of 5 samples isolated from blood (3 of 5 were
from one patient) and 1 of 3 samples from re-resected tumors
(Fig. 5C). While technical replicates for targeted sequencing of
yCD2 were highly concordant (Supplementary Fig. S11), the
concordance between Toca 511 sequencing results and targeted
yCD2 sequencing results varied (Supplementary Text; Supple-
mentary Fig. S10). Thus, we must be cautious about quantita-
tive interpretation of specific mutation frequencies, which
could be skewed by a small number of viral copies going into
PCR reactions prior to sequencing preparation (50). For
instance, even in tumors resected after Toca 511 delivery and
multiple rounds of Toca FC, where deleterious mutations are
observed at high frequency, we still detect yCD2 expression,
suggesting a reservoir of functional virus persists (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S12; ref. 9).
Toca 511 preferentially targets tumors in a recurrent GBM
patient
While we have characterized the tissue and biofluid distri-
bution of Toca 511 in mice (12), analogous analyses have not
been reported in humans. Twenty-one tissue samples through-
out the body were obtained after the death of a male patient
with recurrent GBM who was treated with Toca 511 via injec-
tion into the newly resected tumor cavity, as in Study 11. The
patient died approximately 3 months after Toca 511 injection
and approximately 6 weeks after a single cycle of Toca FC as the
patient declined further treatment due to poor quality of life
with global aphasia. We obtained three pieces of recurrent
tumor at the Toca 511–injection site, three from a separate
noninjected GBM tumor, two from nonneoplastic brain, one
from spinal cord, one from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) as well as
from sites that are considered potential repositories for gRVs or
important organs to test, including spleen, lymph node, bone
marrow, lung, liver, lower GI, testes, and skin as well as whole
blood and urine.

 We measured Toca 511 levels in DNA and total RNA isolated
from each autopsy tissue sample. Toca 511 was detected in RNA
isolated from two of three samples from the injected tumor site
and from one of three samples from neighboring noninjected
tumor, but not elsewhere (Fig. 6A, right). Toca 511 was detected in
DNA isolated from all three injected-site tumor pieces, two of
three noninjected tumor pieces, immediately adjacent non-
neoplastic brain region, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF, Fig. 6A, left). Outside of the central nervous system, we
found observable but not quantifiable (< 100 copies/mg, < 1 copy/
1,500 diploid cell equivalents) Toca 511 DNA in blood, liver,
spleen, lymph node, lung, and bone marrow. No Toca 511 signal
was observed in DNA isolated from testes, urine, skin, or lower GI.
No Toca 511 RNA was detected outside of the tumor samples,
reinforcing the low probability of live virus shedding by patients.
Toca 511 tumor specificity is corroborated by whole brain autopsy
samples isolated from a patient in Study 8 who underwent one
cycle of Toca FC (Supplementary Table S3).
We amplified and sequenced integrated Toca 511 from DNA
isolated from the injection site tumor, the noninjected tumor,
CSF, and blood. For all four samples, we obtained quality results
from the 30 PCR product covering 3,750 bp including yCD2
(Supplementary Fig. S7). There were more than twice as many
SNVs from the two tumor samples and CSF relative to blood (Fig.
6B). Most mutations in tumor and CSF were G to A (Fig. 6C).
Nonetheless the specific mutation pattern in each sample was
unique (Fig. 6D). Thus while the general mutation biases were
similar among the tumor and CSF samples, the locations and
frequencies of specific mutations varied considerably.
Discussion
The logic behind gammaretroviral replicating vector gene
therapy for oncology
Gammaretroviral replicating vector gene therapy holds prom-
ise for a range of oncologic therapeutic indications due its ability
to selectively infect cancer cells without direct cell lysis and deliver
a therapeutic transgene. In animal models, Toca 511–infected
tumor cells are killed by 5-FU converted from 5- FC. The diffusible
5-FU also kills susceptible neighboring cells, including immune
suppressor myeloid cells that contribute to the immune-sup-
pressed tumor microenvironment (51, 52). After several cycles
of Toca FC, treated immunocompetent animals that clear tumor
are resistant to tumor rechallenge (12) and this resistance is T-cell
mediated (51, 52).
The potential advantages of a RRV, Toca 511, over RNV center
around the premise that there will be multiple rounds of infection
and spread in the tumor over time, leading to a greater proportion
of tumor cells and geographical regions infected, including non-
injected tumors. The replication of retroviruses, including Toca
511, includes stable integration of viral genomes into infected
cancer cell genomes creating a reservoir of Toca 511. This reservoir

 persists during Toca FC treatment in part because noncycling
cancer cells are more resistant to 5-FU killing than replicating cells
(53). The reservoir provides a source of Toca 511 production and
spread to newly formed cancer cells between Toca FC doses. This
allows for continued killing of tumor cells over multiple cycles of
Toca FC and subsequent breaking of immune tolerance and
reactivation of the immune system against the tumor. This is
seen in preclinical models where several cycles of Toca FC are
required to produce durable response in immunocompetent
animals (12).
Toca 511 selectively replicates and spreads in patient tumors
Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest Toca 511 does
indeed undergo multiple rounds of infection in patient samples.
The strongest evidence comes from mutational profiles in which
the frequencies of specific mutations vary over 30-fold (Fig. 4).

 Samples from tumors isolated after Toca 511 and Toca FC treat-
ment categorically displayed more mutations than samples from
tumors taken before Toca FC treatment, likely due to depletion of
functional Toca 511 genomes from yCD2-dependent 5-FU–medi-
ated cell death. Detection of integrated Toca 511 in blood samples
emerges weeks after dosing suggesting ongoing viral replication
and spread of productive virus over time (Fig. 1). Toca 511 was
quantitatively detected in both the tumor from the injection site
and in a separate noninjected tumor in the brain (Fig. 6).
Multiple lines of evidence presented herein support Toca 5110s
selectivity for tumor cells over normal cells and tissues in humans.
Integrated Toca 511 was detected transiently in blood but only in
11 of 56 patients treated in Study 11 (Fig. 1). Toca 511 RNA was
only detected in 2 of the 15 blood samples with detectable levels
of integrated Toca 511 DNA (Supplementary Dataset S1). While it
was not feasible to measure Toca 511 levels in tumor cells in the
resection study prior to Toca FC treatment, we did measure Toca
511 levels in the context of intravenous delivery as well as in
tumors that recurred post Toca FC treatment. In these contexts,
Toca 511 DNA and Toca 511 RNA were detected in >40% of
tumors, at levels generally higher than seen in blood (Fig. 1),
arguing for active virus production in the tumor (Supplementary
Dataset S1). These results are extended in a more expansive
analysis of nontumor samples from a patient's whole body
autopsy, where we detected integrated virus and viral RNA in the
injected tumor site as well as in a noninjected brain tumor, but we
only detected nonquantifiable levels of virus DNA in a subset of
bodily sites outside of the central nervous system (Fig. 6). All
patients cleared detectable virus signal in blood within the first
couple cycles of Toca FC suggesting that human patients are
generally able to control the virus systemically, even if the yCD2
gene is inactivated (Figs. 4 and 5). We hypothesize blood clear-
ance is due to a combination of yCD2-dependent apoptosis
following 5-FC administration, Toca 511 independent cell turn-
over and multiple innate and adaptive defense mechanisms that
act naturally to clear MLV, which is not zoonotic.
APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination is likely the dominant
source of Toca 511 mutations in patients
Most mutations in Toca 511 genomes isolated from patient
samples were G to A transitions (Fig. 4). The human genome
encodes a repertoire of APOBEC cytidine deaminases, some of
which are incorporated into retroviral particles via interactions
with the core viral protein GAG and viral RNA and catalyze C to U
transitions on single-stranded DNA during reverse transcription
in the cytoplasm (54), leading to G to A mutations in the viral
coding strand. The most parsimonious explanation for the muta-
tion profiles is that Toca 511 particles encapsulate one or more
APOBEC molecules, which then processively mutate C's to U's
during reverse transcription in the subsequent rounds of infec-
tion, leading to mutated and often inactivated integrated virus
(Fig. 4). Among G to A mutations, those resulting in conversion of
the tryptophan codon (TGG) to premature stop codons (TGA,
TAG, and TAA) are expected to be particularly deleterious to viral
functions. The complement of the tryptophan codon is the
preferred sequence context for APOBEC3G, suggesting this para-
log as a likely culprit. Generally though, the sources and identities
of APOBECs incorporated into Toca 511 particles in patients are
not known. While in some samples we estimate >90% frequency
of specific G to A stop mutations, such as mutations leading to
conversion of tryptophan at position 10 in yCD2 (Figs. 4 and 5C;
Supplementary Fig. S10), we are cautious about quantitative
interpretation of the mutation frequencies given the observed
intrasample discordance (Supplementary Text and Supplemen-
tary Fig. S10). Indeed, we detected yCD2 protein via IHC in some
tumor samples with high frequency of conversion of tryptophan
at position 10 to stop codon (Supplementary Fig. S12), suggesting
APOBECs inactivate some, but not all, Toca 511 genomes. How-
ever, we are unable to make quantitative connections between
observed yCD2 expression by IHC from one piece of tumor to
Toca 511 DNA and RNA levels in another piece of tumor due to
intratumor heterogeneity.
As Toca 511 is derived from a mouse gammaretrovirus, it did
not specifically evolve mechanisms to minimize inactivation by
human APOBECs (or other human restriction factors). In prin-
ciple, future generations of gRVs could be engineered to minimize
tryptophan residues within the transgene, which could lead to
enhanced efficacy in tumors while maintaining the safety profile.
No evidence for pathology or molecular abnormalities from
Toca 511 insertions
A primary safety concern using RRVs has been that infection of
blood progenitor cells leading to oncogenic transformation could
occur in some clinical situations as has been observed with RNVs.
Toca 511 integration profiles from blood and tumor samples
described herein, after administration both into the tumor resec-
tion cavity and intravenously, show no compelling evidence for
clonal expansion of infected cells within the time frame of these
trials (Study 11 started in 2011; Fig. 3). These results are consistent
with the absence of direct clinical evidence for this kind of adverse
event so far in patients with recurrent HGG treated with Toca 511
and Toca FC in a resection setting (9). However, given the
precedence for subsequent malignancies in patients with HGG
and temozolomide-related hematologic adverse events (55, 56),
it is likely that we will eventually encounter patients treated with
Toca 511 and Toca FC that develop hematologic adverse events,
including lymphoma. The assays presented herein would enable
us to gauge the contribution, if any, of Toca 511 insertional
mutagenesis.
Gammaretrovirus integration is stimulated by physical inter-
actions between integrase with BET proteins which orchestrate
assembly of transcription initiation complexes, leading to so-
called pseudo-random insertion preferentially near transcription
start sites, including active enhancers and promoters (57). There-
fore, many gRV integration sites are within gene-regulatory
regions, which in turn could influence the transcriptional regu-
lation of linked genes, as seen for LMO2 in HSCs in some treated
X-SCID patients, resulting in the delayed onset of leukemia in
some of these severely immune compromised patients (58). Our
analyses of Toca 511 integration sites in blood and brain tumor
suggest that while Toca 511 follows pseudo-random preferences
of other gRVs, there was no compelling evidence for clonal
expansion as judged by overrepresentation of specific integration
sites, nor was there preferential insertion near oncogenes (Fig. 3).
We did find that insertion sites in blood and brain tumor occurred
preferentially near genes that function in their respective tissue
type (Fig. 2).
Conclusions
Toca 511 and Toca FC treatment represents a general novel
anticancer modality (9). This study fills in crucial gaps in our
understanding of the therapeutic use of Toca 511 and replicating
