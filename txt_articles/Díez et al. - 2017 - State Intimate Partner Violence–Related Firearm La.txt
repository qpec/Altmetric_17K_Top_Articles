Background: To prevent intimate partner homicide (IPH), some
states have adopted laws restricting firearm possession by inti-
mate partner violence (IPV) offenders. “Possession”laws prohibit
the possession of firearms by these offenders. “Relinquishment”
laws prohibit firearm possession and also explicitly require of-
fenders to surrender their firearms. Few studies have assessed
the effect of these policies.
Objective: To study the association between state IPV-related
firearm laws and IPH rates over a 25-year period (1991 to 2015).
Design: Panel study.
Setting: United States, 1991 to 2015.
Participants: Homicides committed by intimate partners, as
identified in the Federal Bureau of Investigation'
s Uniform Crime
Reports, Supplementary Homicide Reports.
Measurements: IPV-related firearm laws (predictor) and annual,
state-specific, total, and firearm-related IPH rates (outcome).
Results: State laws that prohibit persons subject to IPV-related
restraining orders from possessing firearms and also require
them to relinquish firearms in their possession were associated
with 9.7% lower total IPH rates (95% CI, 3.4% to 15.5% reduction)
and 14.0% lower firearm-related IPH rates (CI, 5.1% to 22.0%
reduction) than in states without these laws. Laws that did not
explicitly require relinquishment of firearms were associated with
a non–statistically significant 6.6% reduction in IPH rates.
Limitations: The model did not control for variation in imple-
mentation of the laws. Causal interpretation is limited by the ob-
servational and ecological nature of the analysis.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that state laws restricting fire-
arm possession by persons deemed to be at risk for perpetrating
intimate partner abuse may save lives. Laws requiring at-risk per-
sons to surrender firearms already in their possession were asso-
ciated with lower IPH rates.

E
very year, more than 1800 persons in the United
States are killed by their intimate partners, and ap-
proximately 50% of these homicides are committed
with firearms (1). Approximately 85% of victims of inti-
mate partner homicide (IPH) are women, and IPH ac-
counts for nearly 50% of all homicides involving women
in the United States each year (2, 3). Several studies
(4–7) have shown that in situations of intimate partner
violence (IPV)—which may include physical violence,
sexual violence, stalking, and/or psychological aggression—
abusers'access to firearms increases the risk for IPH as
much as 5-fold (5). Because of the association between
firearm access and IPH, regulating the possession of
firearms by IPV offenders is one approach to reducing
IPH (3, 6–8).
Federal legislation enacted in the United States in
1968 prohibited firearm possession by persons con-
victed of an IPV-related felony (9). This legislation was
augmented in 1996 to extend the prohibition to those
convicted of an IPV-related misdemeanor (10). In addi-
tion, the 1994 Violence Against Women Act barred
firearm possession by persons subject to permanent
IPV-related restraining orders (11). However, there is
limited federal capacity or willingness to enforce these
restrictions. Therefore, several states have enacted
their own statutes to mirror these federal laws and ex-
plicitly authorize state officials to enforce the restric-
tions curtailing IPV perpetrators'possession of firearms
(we refer to these as “possession” laws).
However, a substantial loophole in the federal stat-
ute limits the ability of states to enforce these laws,
even if they have codified the federal statute into their
own laws. Although the federal statute prohibits certain
IPV offenders from possessing firearms, it does not ex-
plicitly require them to surrender guns already in their
possession (12, 13). In other words, in some states, a
person may technically be prohibited from possessing
a firearm, but it is up to the person to go to a police
station to relinquish the weapon. Without statutory au-
thorization, law enforcement cannot confiscate the fire-
arms. This loophole has been termed the “relinquish-
ment gap” by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence
(14). As the Law Center stated in its recent report on
this loophole, “One of the most glaring gaps in the na-
tion'
s gun laws—even in states with the strongest gun
laws in the country, like California—is the lack of an ef-
fective firearm relinquishment policy. Few state legisla-
tures have taken any meaningful steps to actually en-
force their criminal gun restrictions by ensuring that
armed offenders give up their firearms after they are
convicted of serious crimes” (14). Recently, however,
some states have taken steps to enforce their gun re-
strictions by going beyond federal law.

 One way that some states have done this is by en-
acting legislation that explicitly requires persons pro-
hibited from possessing firearms due to an IPV-related
misdemeanor or restraining order to surrender firearms
already in their possession (we refer to these as “relin-
quishment” or “surrender” laws) (14). These laws typi-
cally enhance enforcement by putting offenders on of-
ficial notice that surrender of their firearms is required
and by specifying a time by which the transfer must
take place. For example, California law requires that
when a court issues an IPV-related restraining order, it
orders respondents to surrender all firearms in their
possession within 24 hours by transferring them to a
law enforcement official or a federally licensed gun
dealer (15). As of 2016, 11 states explicitly required
persons convicted of an IPV-related misdemeanor to
surrender their firearms after conviction, and 15 states
explicitly required persons subject to an IPV-related re-
straining order to surrender their firearms for as long as
the order is in effect (14). A second approach that some
states have used is requiring law enforcement officials
to remove firearms from the scene of an IPV incident. A
third approach involves extending the prohibition of
firearm possession to persons convicted of stalking.
We are aware of only 3 studies that have evaluated
the effect of state firearm policies on IPH rates (16–19).
These studies were limited because they used data
from 2003 or earlier and had little power to detect an
effect of IPV-related firearm policies because so few
states had enacted such policies. Most important, at the
time of these studies, few states had enacted laws that
required IPV offenders to surrender firearms already in
their possession, although 16 states had adopted a re-
linquishment law by 2013. The number of state IPV-
related firearm laws has increased sharply since 2003,
partly in response to the reauthorization of the Violence
Against Women Act in 2005. A new provision made
Violence Against Women Act grants conditional on
state courts' informing convicted IPV offenders of the
federal and any state restrictions on firearm ownership.
This study builds on and extends previous studies
in 2 key ways. First, our data include homicide rates and
state laws over a much longer and more recent time
frame (1991 to 2015). Second, we drew data from the
most comprehensive coding of state IPV-related laws to
date, paying particular attention to relinquishment pro-
visions that might be critical to the larger policy goal of
restricting firearm possession by potentially dangerous
persons.
METHODS
Design Overview
We conducted a panel study to examine the asso-
ciation between state IPV-related firearm laws and total
and firearm-related IPH rates between 1991 and 2015.
The panel consisted of state-level predictor and out-
come variables for each of the 50 states during each of
the 25 years. The outcome variable was the state-
specific IPH rate in a given year. Four categories of laws
were considered: 1) prohibition of firearm possession
by persons convicted of an IPV-related misdemeanor,
with or without a relinquishment requirement; 2) prohi-
bition of firearm possession by persons subject to an
IPV-related restraining order, with or without a relin-
quishment requirement; 3) laws authorizing removal of
firearms from the scene of a domestic violence inci-
dent; and 4) prohibition of firearm possession by per-
sons convicted of stalking (Table 1). We also examined
whether laws in the first 2 categories included a mech-
anism to ensure that persons surrender firearms al-
ready in their possession. Because we used secondary
data sources without personal identifiers, the Institu-
tional Review Board of Boston University Medical Cen-
ter deemed this not to be human subjects research.

 Homicide Reports (SHR) of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation'
s Uniform Crime Reports (20–23). State and lo-
cal law enforcement agencies report homicides to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation on a monthly basis.
Data were provided for each of the 50 states for the
entire study period, with the exception of missing data
for 23 state–year combinations. Thus, the final sample
size was 1227 out of 1250 possible observations.
The SHR victim–offender relationship categories in-
clude spouses, common-law spouses, former spouses,
and dating partners, but former dating partners are not
specifically categorized (24). This prevented us from as-
sessing the effect of IPV-related firearm laws on abuse
of noncohabiting dating partners, which is underre-
ported in the SHR because these cases are often not
classified as IPH (24).
Missing Data on Victim–Offender Relationship. The
SHR is limited by missing data on the victim–offender
relationship in approximately one third of homicides.
Fox and Swatt developed a multiple imputation ap-
proach for these missing data that is generally viewed
as the strategy of choice (25). The imputation proce-
dure attempts to ascertain the likely victim–offender re-
lationship using known variables about the case and
the observed association of those variables with the
victim–offender relationship in cases where this rela-
tionship is clear. Fox provided us with multiply imputed
files covering 1990 to 2015 (26). In our prior work, we
showed that regression results obtained using the im-
puted data are similar to those obtained using only
cases in which the victim–offender relationship is
known (27). Nevertheless, we conducted analyses us-
ing both the imputed and nonimputed data to ensure
that the imputation process did not alter the findings.
The correlation between imputed and nonimputed IPH
rates was 0.93.
Main Predictor Variable
Using searches conducted with the WestlawNext
and HeinOnline legal resources, with laws then col-
lected from state legislature Web sites, Everytown for
Gun Safety developed a database of state IPV-related
firearm laws over time (28). Using this database, we
coded 4 categories of laws and their operative provi-
sions (a total of 6 variables) as present or absent for
each state during each of the 25 years from 1991
through 2015 (Appendix Table 1, available at Annals
.org). Data on these provisions for all 50 states for 2015
are shown in Appendix Tables 2 and 3 (available at
Annals.org). State laws on IPV-related felonies were not
included in our analyses because most states have pro-
cedures in place for the surrender of firearms by per-
sons convicted of felonies.
Control Variables
We accounted for secular trends in homicide rates
by including year fixed effects. To account for dynamic
effects and to address the potential problem of
omitted-variables bias, we included the lagged IPH rate
(that is, the rate in the previous year). We also con-
trolled for state-level household firearm ownership, us-
ing a proxy (a variable that serves in place of an unmea-
surable variable) that we developed in earlier research
(29).
This
proxy
is
necessary
because
no
survey
assessed household firearm ownership at the state
level throughout the study period (29). We also consid-
ered the following factors, retaining in the model only
those that were significantly related to the outcome:
population distribution by age, sex, and race/ethnicity;
region (East, South, West, and Midwest); degree of ur-
banization; rates of education, poverty, unemployment,
divorce, and self-reported depression; levels of house-
hold income and income inequality; population den-
sity; per capita gross domestic product, personal dis-
posable income, and alcohol consumption; rates of
nonhomicide violent crime (aggravated assault, rob-
bery, and forcible rape), stranger homicide (homicide
committed by a person unknown to the victim), and
property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehi-
cle theft); incarceration rate; and per capita number of
law enforcement officers (Appendix Table 4, available
at Annals.org). We lagged the state laws by 1 year; for
example, we used laws in 1991 to predict homicide
rates starting in 1992. Thus, the law data used in our
analyses covered 1990 through 2014.
Statistical Analysis
Because homicide rates are skewed and overdis-
persed rather than normally distributed, we modeled
this outcome using a negative binomial model follow-
ing the approach in our previous studies (27, 30–33).
To account for clustering of observations among states,
we used a generalized estimating equations approach
(34–38). We used SEs that are robust to the presence of
serial
autocorrelation
and
heteroscedasticity
(39).
Model fit was assessed using the quasi-information cri-
terion, indicated by Pan as the criterion of choice for
generalized estimating equations models (40). This test
indicated that an exchangeable working correlation
matrix produced the best fit for the data.
To develop a parsimonious model and to avoid
overfitting the model, we conducted a stepwise vari-
able selection procedure. Both a forward and a back-
ward selection procedure resulted in the inclusion of 3
covariates: proportion of the population that was Afri-
can American, violent crime rate, and divorce rate. Five
variables were automatically included in all models:
year fixed effects, region fixed effects, stranger homi-
cide rate, household firearm ownership, and lagged
IPH rate.
Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 14
(StataCorp).

 RESULTS
The number of states with IPV-related firearm laws
increased substantially between 1990 and 2015, but
very few states enacted laws requiring IPV offenders to
surrender firearms they already had (Figure 1). For ex-
ample, by 2015, 26 states prohibited firearm posses-
sion by persons convicted of an IPV-related misde-
meanor, but only 11 of those states also explicitly
required relinquishment of weapons. Similarly, 24
states prohibited firearm possession by persons sub-
ject to an IPV-related restraining order, but only 15 of
those states also explicitly required relinquishment of
firearms. By 2015, 2 states (California and Illinois) had
enacted all of the laws, but 16 states had enacted none.
During the study period, 3 states (Washington, Ala-
bama, and Arkansas) repealed a law that was already in
place.
Nationally, the total IPH rate decreased from 1.19
per 100 000 persons in 1991 to 0.60 per 100 000 per-
sons in 2015, and the firearm-related IPH rate de-
creased from 0.68 to 0.36 per 100 000 persons. There
was a nearly 5-fold range in average IPH rates across
states in 2015, with a low of 0.36 per 100 000 persons
in Minnesota and a high of 1.67 per 100 000 persons in
Louisiana. The mean IPH rate across all states de-
creased from 1.18 per 100 000 persons in 1991 to 0.67
per 100 000 persons in 2015.
We first examined models that included each of the
laws one at a time (Table 1). Laws that prohibited fire-
arm possession by persons subject to an IPV-related
restraining order and required them to surrender fire-
arms they already had were associated with 10.8%
lower total IPH rates (95% CI, �16.8% to �4.4%) and
15.0% lower firearm-related IPH rates (CI, �23.3% to
�5.9%) compared with the absence of both laws. Laws
prohibiting firearm possession by persons subject to
IPV-related restraining orders that did not also require
offenders to surrender firearms they already had were
not significantly associated with total or firearm-related
IPH rates. The 3 other categories of laws were not sig-
nificantly associated with total or firearm-related IPH
rates.
We next developed a final model that included
only the presence or absence of an IPV-related restrain-
ing order firearm relinquishment law but did not in-
clude restraining order firearm possession laws (states
with these laws were in the reference group). These
laws were significantly associated with 9.7% lower total
IPH rates and 14.0% lower firearm-related IPH rates but
were not significantly associated with non–firearm-
related IPH rates (Table 2).
To ensure that imputation of the victim–offender
relationship in some cases did not affect the results, we
repeated the analysis using only nonimputed data (that
is, including only confirmed IPHs). The results were es-
sentially unchanged: restraining order relinquishment
laws were associated with 8.4% lower IPH rates (CI,
�16.0% to �0.04%) (Appendix Table 5, available at
Annals.org).
We then estimated a model in which the relation-
ship between restraining order relinquishment laws
and IPH rates was allowed to vary by state. In this
model, these laws were associated with significantly
lower IPH rates in 9 states, nonsignificantly lower rates
in 3 states, and nonsignificantly higher rates in 2 states
(Figure 2; Appendix Table 6, available at Annals.org).

 In 10 of 14 states that enacted these laws, the percent-
age change in IPH rates from before to after the law
was greater than that for other states without such a law
during the same period (Appendix Table 7, available at
Annals.org). The regression model estimated lower IPH
rates associated with implementation of the law for all
of these states.
To check the validity of our findings, we investi-
gated whether laws requiring persons subject to IPV-
related restraining orders to surrender their firearms
were associated with other crime-related outcomes not
expected to be affected by these laws. We found
no significant relationship between these laws and
stranger homicide rates, violent crime rates, or prop-

 erty crime rates. We also confirmed that the relation-
ship between restraining order relinquishment laws
and IPH rates remained significant when we included
region-specific time trends and state fixed effects in the
model. We also reran the analysis using the traditional
proxy for household gun ownership (the percentage of
suicides committed with a firearm) used in other stud-
ies (41), and the results were unchanged. Finally, the
results remained unchanged when we controlled for
state laws requiring universal background checks, per-
mits to purchase handguns, or waiting periods for the
purchase of handguns.
We saw a clear trend of gradually decreasing IPH
rates in states without restraining order relinquishment
laws, but the rate of decrease slowed after 2005 and
the average IPH rate actually increased from 2013 to
2015 (Figure 3). In contrast, IPH rates in states with re-
straining order relinquishment laws continued to de-
crease at their previous rate after 2005 and dropped
slightly from 2013 to 2015. Differences in IPH rates in
2015 between states with and without restraining order
relinquishment laws are shown in the Appendix Figure
(available at Annals.org).
If one assumes a causal relationship, our final
model (Table 2) suggested that there were 75 fewer
IPHs in 2015 among states with restraining order relin-
quishment laws than would have been expected with-
out these laws. The model also suggested that if all 50
states had such laws in place, there would have been
an additional 120 fewer IPH deaths across the nation in
2015 than would have been expected without these
laws.
DISCUSSION
We examined the association of state IPV-related
firearm laws with IPH rates using data subsequent to
2003, a period in which many states enacted such laws.
We found that state laws that both prohibited the pos-
session of firearms by persons subject to an IPV-related
restraining order and required these persons to surren-
der their firearms were associated with firearm-related
IPH rates that were 14.0% lower than in states without
these laws. Laws that prohibited the possession of fire-
arms by persons subject to a restraining order but did
not require them to surrender firearms already in their
possession were not significantly associated with IPH
rates.
A basic implication of these findings is that laws
that identify firearm owners who are at high risk for
using their weapons against their partners and require
the relinquishment of those weapons may save lives.
Women who obtain restraining orders are at particu-
larly high risk for partner violence, given that fear of
violence (often created by threatened or actual vio-
lence) typically motivates the desire for a protective or-
der. These findings seem to demonstrate the value of
identifying high-risk situations based on known epi-
sodes of past violence and removing firearms from
such situations to prevent future violence.
Although our study did not find a statistically signif-
icant association between laws prohibiting IPV misde-
meanants or convicted stalkers from owning guns and
rates of IPH, current data do not allow us to assess the
extent to which implementation might mediate their ef-
fect. Such laws may be effective only if law enforcement

 has the authority or mandate to seize firearms from of-
fenders. At this time, there are not enough states with
such provisions to assess their effect.
Other state-level variables that were related to IPH
in our models were residence in the South, the preva-
lence of household firearm ownership, the stranger ho-
micide rate, the lagged IPH rate, the proportion of the
population that was African American, the violent crime
rate, and the divorce rate. Data from a national survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention show that physical (excluding sexual) IPV is ap-
proximately
35%
higher
among
African
American
women than white women (42). Thus, it may be that the
significant coefficient for this variable reflects a higher
rate of IPH among African Americans.
The chief potential threat to the validity of our find-
ings is that states that have enacted laws requiring sub-
jects of IPV-related restraining orders to surrender their
firearms may differ from those that have not in ways
that were not measured. Another important limitation
of this research is that even if laws are written similarly,
their enforcement may vary by county, city, or town
within a given state. There may also be differences in
how the judicial system in each state adjudicates IPV
cases and in how state law handles protective orders in
general. Our findings may also reflect the effect of laws
other than IPV-specific ones. Finally, to avoid the eco-
logical fallacy, caution must be used in drawing infer-
ences from this study with regard to the relationship
between both the main exposure variable (state laws)
and the covariates and IPH risk at the individual level.
Despite these limitations, the results of this study
suggest that laws prohibiting firearm possession by
persons subject to IPV-related restraining orders may
be associated with lower rates of firearm-related IPH,
but only if the law includes an explicit requirement that
these persons relinquish their firearms.

IPH = intimate partner homicide; IPV = intimate partner violence.
* For each state that enacted an IPV-related restraining order posses-
sion and surrender law during the study period, this table shows the
average IPH rate before and after the year of implementation of the
law, compared with the average IPH rates during the same years in all
other states combined (excluding any states that had a similar law in
effect). Results for Minnesota are not reported because there was only
1 y of data after implementation of the law, so the estimate is highly
unstable.
