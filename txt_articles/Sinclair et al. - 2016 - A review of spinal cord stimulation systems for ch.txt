Abstract: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) applications and technologies are fast advancing. 
New SCS technologies are being used increasingly in the clinical environment, but often there 
is a lag period between the clinical application and the publishing of high-quality evidence on 
safety and efficacy. Recent developments will undoubtedly expand the applicability of SCS, 
allowing more effective and individualized treatment for patients, and may have the potential 
to salvage patients who have previously failed neuromodulation. Already, high-level evidence 
exists for the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness (Level I–II) of traditional SCS therapies in 
the treatment of chronic refractory low back with predominant limb pain (regardless of surgical 
history). More than half of all patients with chronic painful conditions experience sustained and 
significant levels of pain reduction following SCS treatment. Although only limited evidence 
exists for burst stimulation, there is now Level I evidence for both dorsal root ganglion SCS and 
high-frequency SCS that demonstrates compelling results compared with traditional therapies. 
The body of evidence built on traditional SCS research may be redundant, with newer itera-
tions of SCS therapies such as dorsal root ganglion SCS, high-frequency SCS, and burst SCS. 
A number of variables have been identified that can affect SCS efficacy: implanter experience, 
appropriate patient selection, etiologies of patient pain, existence of comorbidities, including 
psychiatric illness, smoking status, and delay to SCS implant following pain onset. Overall, 
scientific literature demonstrates SCS to be a safe, effective, and drug-free treatment option for 
many chronic pain etiologies.
Keywords: spinal cord stimulator, neuromodulation, chronic pain, low back pain
Introduction to chronic pain
Chronic pain affects up to 20% of the population in developed nations.1–4 This represents 
a profound impact on individuals and their families alongside the sizeable burden on 
employers, health care systems, and society in general.3 When chronic pain occurs, it 
has the potential to become disease itself, and subsequently, chronic pain has emerged 
as a distinct phenomenon.5  
Management of chronic pain varies greatly between nations and even within nations. 
Literature supports a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care, although vari-
ous health care systems may not always support this concept consistently.2  
The current standard of care for chronic, noncancer pain typically includes many 
disciplines with the clinician developing an individualized treatment plan with the 
options of utilizing surgical interventions, pharmacology, and psychological and 
physical therapies. Opioid analgesics are often prescribed, despite the lack of clinical

evidence supporting their long-term use in the manage-
ment of chronic pain.6 However, for many patients, this 
multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or 
is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unac-
ceptable and debilitating. Only at this late stage, referral for 
advanced neuromodulation techniques is considered and 
potentially trialed.  
Neuromodulation 
The field of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has 
developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the electrical 
inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column 
almost 50 years ago.7 The original term of dorsal column 
stimulation has evolved to become known as spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS).8 SCS has been particularly effective as 
an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic/nociceptive and 
neuropathic/radicular pain conditions such as failed back sur-
gery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome 
(CRPS). Neuromodulation therapies offer a treatment option 
that has minimal side effects and that is relatively safe and 
potentially reversible.9 SCS has been used to treat various 
pain conditions for many decades.8,10–13 
In traditional SCS therapies, the objective has been to 
replace the pain sensation with paresthesia that requires 
mapping of stimulation to the region of pain.14 The antici-
pation is that the electrical current alters pain processing by 
masking the sensation of pain with a comfortable tingling or 
paresthesia. Although patients mostly cope with paresthesia, a 
significant proportion report that the sensation is unpleasant, 
particularly with positional changes.  
The stimulation is provided either through electrodes that 
are placed percutaneously into the epidural space or through a 
surgical paddle lead that is delivered via a laminotomy.8 These 
devices are capable of delivering pulse frequencies in the 
range of 2–1,200 Hz but are regularly utilized at 40–60 Hz. 
Patients typically undergo a trial of neuromodulation with 
an externalized power source and if this trial proves to be 
positive and compelling, they subsequently have a subcutane-
ously implantable pulse generator for the long-term therapy. 
 
In recent years, the next phase in the evolution of neuro-
modulation has become available with the development of 
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) SCS and the emerging use of 
two novel advances in stimulation frequencies, being high-
frequency SCS (at 10,000 Hz) and burst SCS.14–19 These 
recent advances have improved the efficacy and expanded 
the applicability of SCS.  
DRG SCS is a highly targeted form of neuromodulation 
therapy.20 Studies indicate that the DRG plays a key role in 
both nociceptive and neuropathic pain.14,21  DRG SCS is 
particularly useful in treating focal areas of pain, in particular 
those that have been difficult to target with traditional SCS 
systems such as groin and foot pain, by applying an innovative 
lead configuration and delivery system around the DRG.8,9,15 
High-frequency 10 SCS (HF10) presents a significant 
development in the evolution of SCS technologies.19 This 
involves application of a unique waveform at 10,000 Hz at a 
subthreshold level and therefore provides pain relief without 
any paresthesia.18,22 The majority of patients have a clear pref-
erence for paresthesia-free stimulation, and HF10 has been 
approved for clinical use in Australia and Europe since 2011 
and has received Food and Drug Administration approval for 
the United States in 2015 for patients with chronic refractory 
pain of the trunk and/or limbs.22,23  
Burst SCS offers another novel mode of stimulation 
whereby conventional frequency parameters are provided in 
bursts of five pulses. The burst frequency is 40 Hz, and the 
pulse frequency is 500 Hz. Amplitude is reduced to try and 
achieve subthreshold stimulation, thereby providing pain 
relief with either reduced or no paresthesia.16,17,24
Efficacy
The most recent systematic and comprehensive review of the 
effectiveness of SCS in treating chronic spinal pain demon-
strated that there is a significant (Level I–II) evidence for SCS 
as a treatment for lumbar FBSS, where conventional medical 
management has failed.23 Furthermore, there is now Level 
I evidence for high-frequency stimulation but only limited 
evidence for burst stimulation.23  
In another recent and extensive review and meta-analysis 
of conventional SCS, more than half of all patients experi-
enced significant pain relief.25 The authors observed that this 
was maintained for a mean follow-up period of 24 months.25 
These reviews demonstrate that traditional SCS is an effec-
tive treatment option for a cohort that is notoriously difficult 
to treat. 
The existing SCS literature has a large number of case 
series reports and only a limited number of high-quality, 
large prospective, consecutively recruited, randomized, or 
controlled comparative trials (Table 1).8,23,25 Furthermore, 
the literature, when viewed historically, must be tempered 
by the developments in skills, application, and technologi-
cal advances.26 Hence, the traditional SCS papers have often 
reported successful pain relief as an undifferentiated generic 
pain that is not specific to the site of the primary or greatest 
pain (eg, back or leg).25 This observation is important because 
conventional SCS therapy has historically been prescribed

analgesic benefit over time and/or efficacy has been lost.30,31 
Tolerance cannot be predicted, and although the rate has 
not been widely reported in the literature, one study that 
researched over 10 years found it to be in the order of 29%.32 
Possible causes for stimulation tolerance include neuro-
plasticity of pain transmission pathways, cellular or fibrotic 
changes in the tissues around the electrodes, patients refram-
ing their pain over time, and psychological or psychiatric 
affective disorders.30 However, data pertaining to HF10 SCS 
have demonstrated no tolerance at this point.22
Despite strict criteria for patient selection, a substantial 
number of patients fail to achieve optimal pain relief with 
SCS.30,33 A number of factors have been identified as possible 
indicators for treatment failure including tobacco and drug 
use, age, and lengthy delay between times of original pain 
onset to SCS implant.30,33 
Food and Drug Administration requirements for labeling 
the recent advanced iterations of SCS systems have led, for 
the first time, to Level I noninferiority comparative studies 
being undertaken to achieve labeling.  
DRG SCS has been demonstrated as effective in multiple 
etiologies, including FBSS, CRPS, and chronic postsurgical 
pain.15 A recent study reported 1 year outcomes for DRG with 
overall pain scores reducing from 77.6 to 33.6 (P<0.005). 
Back pain reduced from 74.5 to 39.7 (P<0.05), and leg pain 
reduced from 74.6 to 28.7 (P<0.0005). The most compelling 
pain reduction happened for foot pain with scores reducing 
from 81.4 to 22.0 (P<0.05).15 Approximately 60% of the DRG 
SCS patients reported >50% improvement in their pain, and 
the pain localized to the back, legs, and feet was reduced by 
42%, 62%, and 80%, respectively.15 Other outcome param-
eters including quality of life, mood, and satisfaction were 
improved and maintained throughout the 12 months.15  
The Accurate study is a US pivotal, noninferiority, random-
ized controlled trial (RCT) between DRG SCS and traditional 
SCS Medtronic system (Medtronic, Inc., Fridley, MN, USA). It 
is the largest RCT in the history of CRPS and causalgia, run-
ning from 2013 with primary completion estimated for 2018. 
The sample size for the study is 152; with 76 randomized to 
DRG SCS and 76 to the control arm using Medtronic traditional 
SCS. The inclusion criterion was leg pain for more than 6 
months duration with a visual analog scale (V
AS) score >6/10.34
In the intention-to-treat analysis, superiority was demon-
strated in the DRG SCS group with 81% of patients achieving 
>50% pain reduction and meeting the primary endpoint at the 
3-month mark, and 74% maintaining that primary endpoint at 
12-month follow-up. The traditional SCS arm demonstrated 
56% of patients having >50% pain reduction at 3 months and 
53% maintaining this through 12 months.34 
In the subset analysis of the implant-only group, the 
data were even more impressive with 93% of the DRG SCS 
group meeting the primary endpoint at 3 months and 86% 
at 12 months. The traditional SCS arm had 72% meeting the 
primary endpoint and 70% at 12 months.34 The statistical 
analysis demonstrated noninferiority and, beyond that, supe-
riority in the intention-to-treat, modified intention-to-treat, 
and implant-only groups. Furthermore, it was noted that 
70% of patients achieved >80% pain reduction in the DRG 
group versus 52% in the Medtronic group. Target specificity 
for stimulation and pain relief was achieved in 94.5% of the

The Sunburst study is set to run from 2013, with primary 
completion in 2016. It is a prospective randomized, non-infe-
riority controlled trial with the St Jude Medical Company (St 
Jude Medical, Inc. St Paul, MN, USA). Patients with intrac-
table pain were randomized for the order they would receive 
either traditional or burst SCS. The study was performed with 
a one-to-one crossover at 12 weeks to the alternate therapy. 
The outcome measures included safety, effectiveness, and 
non-inferiority. The study was applied to an enriched cohort 
with patients who required to have pre-existing pain scores 
>6/10 and a >50% pain reduction in a traditional SCS trial 
using tonic stimulation. The sample size for the study was 
121 with 100 people randomized. The sample size reported to 
date is 85 with a 24-week follow-up. The mean age of patients 
was 59 years, with a median duration of pain being 13 years.35 
The trial demonstrated noninferiority, and further statisti-
cal analysis demonstrated superiority for burst stimulation 
over tonic stimulation (P=0.035).35 The mean difference in 
burst pain reduction compared with tonic stimulation was 
6 mm VAS points. This difference, while being statistically 
significant, does not meet the well-defined criteria for mini-
mal clinical important difference.36 
Approximately 65% of the burst cohort experienced pares-
thesia-free stimulation and 69% of the cohort chose a preference 
for burst, with the majority of these having their preference 
related to no paresthesia, more so than better pain reduction.34
The Senza RCT is a Level I study design run from 2012 
with an estimated primary completion in 2015.22,37 This is the 
first-ever RCT of two SCS therapies with patients random-
ized to HF10 SCS (Senza System; Nevro Corp., Redwood 
City, CA, USA) or traditional SCS commercially available, 
Precision Plus, SCS system (Boston Scientific Corporation, 
 
Marlborough, MA, USA). It is a noninferiority study with the 
statistical capability of demonstrating superiority supervised 
by the Food and Drug Administration, and patients were 
monitored and programmed by the technicians associated 
with the respective devices. One hundred and ninety-eight

patients were randomized with 101 to the HF10 SCS group 
and 97 to traditional. Of these, 90 HF10 SCS patients and 
81 traditional SCS patients were subsequently implanted.
The primary endpoint of >50% back pain reduction at 
3 months was achieved in 80.9% of the HF10 SCS group 
versus 42.5% of the traditional SCS group.37 This met the cri-
teria for noninferiority and statistical superiority (P<0.001). 
Furthermore, at 12 months, this primary endpoint was met 
in 78.7% versus 51.3% of the patients.
Similarly, the primary endpoint for leg pain reduction 
was met in 80.0% of the HF10 SCS group versus 49.4% of 
the traditional SCS group.37 The responder rates for >50% 
leg pain reduction at 3 months was 83.1% in the HF10 SCS 
group and 55.0% in the traditional SCS group. The 12-month 
outcome data for the same groups were 78.7% versus 51.3% 
(superiority P value, P<0.001).37 This study demonstrated 
superiority of HF10 SCS to traditional SCS in all primary 
and secondary endpoints that has led to the labeling of HF10 
therapy as superior to traditional low-frequency SCS by the 
Food and Drug Administration.
In further analysis of pain etiology, it was demonstrated that 
for the conditions of FBSS, radiculopathy, degenerative disc 
disease, and spondylosis, the relative ratio of patients meeting 
the primary endpoint with HF10 SCS was approximately 2.0 
times the traditional SCS (eg, FBSS 85.7% versus 41.4%).37 
 
Further subset analysis of patients who achieved VAS pain 
scores of ≤2.5 showed that for those with back pain, relief was 
maintained for 12 months 68.5% of the time for HF10 SCS, 
but only 35.8% of the time using traditional SCS. Whereas, 
for those with leg pain it was achieved 67.4% of the time for 
HF10 SCS versus 42.5% of the time with traditional SCS. 
Superiority P-values for HF10 were significant (P<0.001).37
These data demonstrate compelling evidence for treating 
complex back pain that was previously unheralded in the 
literature. Furthermore, paresthesia-free options allow the 
patient to keep stimulation on potentially 24 hours a day and 
hence sleep with the stimulator on and also perform activities 
such as driving.  
Economical or cost efficiency 
Health care policy and funding decisions require evidence of 
clinical efficacy and information around cost-effectiveness 
of treatments.38,39 Consequently, there have been a number 
of studies considering the economic factors associated 
with SCS. Most recently, a 2015 study investigating the 
cost-effectiveness of conventional medical management 
with or without SCS in patients with FBSS compared a 
summary of the total direct and indirect costs incurred in 
the 12 months prior and 24 months following SCS.40 The 
costs were scaled to values of €2,009. The total pre-SCS 
treatment costs were equivalent to €6,567/patient-year. 
The year of implant incurred a significant increase in costs 
of €20,902/patient-year, mainly attributed to the high cost 
of the SCS devices. In the following 12–14 months, SCS 
implant had dropped to €5,430/patient-year.40 Applying the 
current United Kingdom National Health Service threshold 
(intervention considered not cost-effective if the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio is higher than €45,000/quality-
adjusted life year [QALY]), SCS with conventional medical 
management would be considered cost-effective around 40% 
of the time.40 However, if the willingness-to-pay threshold 
was shifted to €60,000/QALY, SCS would be considered 
cost-effective by the National Health Service with an average 
of 80% of the time.  
In 2013, a study developed models to evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of SCS and conventional medical management 
together compared with conventional medical management 
alone for patients with FBSS and CRPS.41 Health effects 
were expressed as QALYs and costs were expressed as 
Canadian dollars (CAN$) scaled to 2012. The models 
were extrapolated over a 20 year-time period with 3.5% 
discounts annually (as per National Institute of Clinical 
Excellence suggestion). The modeling data showed that SCS 
with conventional medical management is cost-effective 
compared with conventional medical management alone 
for all presentations, with a cost-effectiveness ratio for 
SCS of CAN$9293 for FBSS and CAN$11,216 for CRPS 
per QALY gained.41  
In a study in 2010, the cost-effectiveness of SCS with 
conventional medical management was compared with con-
ventional medical management alone in CRPS patients.42 
This study models economic costs using a simulated model 
population, employing parameters and assumptions set from 
previously published randomized trials. Here, SCS was 
shown to be cost-effective in select CRPS patients, with a 
probability exceeding 80% that SCS is cost-effective where 
the willingness to pay is set for a maximum of £30,000 per 
QALY.42
Another cost-effectiveness study of SCS was performed 
in 2010 using a FBSS cohort.42 Here, the authors compared 
SCS versus conventional medical management versus 
reoperation. Rechargeable and nonrechargeable implantable 
pulse generators were also assessed for cost efficacy. This 
study showed that in selected patients, SCS is cost-effective 
both as an adjunct to conventional medical management 
and as an alternative to reoperation; that the likelihood 
SCS would be cost-effective versus conventional medical 
management and versus reoperation exceeds 80%, where

the willingness to pay is set for a maximum of £20,000 per 
QALY.42
In 2008, a systematic review for cost-effectiveness of 
three studies where FBSS patients had been treated with 
SCS demonstrated that SCS is both more effective and less 
costly than conventional medical management alone in the 
long-term but there are high upfront implant costs associated 
with SCS implantation and maintenance.43 
In 2008, another study reported the generic health-related 
quality of life and costs of SCS at 6 months follow-up (using 
data from the PROCESS trial) compared to the quality of 
life, resource consumption, and costs of conventional medi-
cal management alone in patients with FBSS.39 The study 
found that the mean total health care costs for the SCS group 
were significantly higher (€12,653) than the conventional 
medical management group (€2,594), when scaled for UK 
2005–2006 national data.39  
This result reflects the high upfront costs of SCS over the 
limited 6-month follow-up period. The authors showed that 
15% of the additional mean cost of SCS was offset within 
6 months by a reduced use of drug and nondrug therapies. 
They also demonstrated a gain in quality of life over the same 
period which was significantly greater for the SCS group. 
The study concludes that, over the short term, SCS treatment 
results in greater healthcare costs but also generates important 
health improvements for the patients over the same period.39
Cost-efficacy studies show that despite significant initial 
costs, SCS compared with other conventional treatments 
available to chronic pain patients results in long-term reduc-
tions in health care costs, which offset the high initial treat-
ment costs over time.44  
Safety and tolerability
In the literature, SCS is reported as a safe procedure due to its 
reversible and minimally invasive characteristics.30 Although 
catastrophic complications are possible, they are very rare. 
However, the incidence of minor complications of SCS has 
been reported at around 30%–40%.13,30,31,45–47 These minor 
complications tend to occur within 12 months of implantation 
and are readily reversible and generally resolved.13
The complications are divided into three main categories: 
mechanical, biological, and technique-related.32 Complica-
tions of a mechanical origin are more common than those 
of biological origin.31,45 Historically, hardware-related com-
plications occurred at a rate of between 24%–50%, whereas 
adverse biological events occurred in 7.5% of cases.30
Mechanical complications include lead fracture or discon-
nection, which has a reported incidence of between 5% and 
9%; lead migration has a reported incidence between 0% 
and 27%; implantable pulse generator failure occurred at a 
reported frequency of 1.7%.11,30 These complications can be 
minimized by using appropriate leads, anchoring, and sutur-
ing techniques. Furthermore, minimizing patient movements 
in the first 3 months after surgery allows for postoperative 
scarring of leads into place.30 
Kapural et al22 demonstrated that lead migration of sig-
nificance and requiring intervention in both the HF10 and 
traditional SCS arms occurred <5%. This most likely reflects 
improvements in both lead design and the anchoring systems 
used (Figures 1–3).14,22,26,48
Biological complications include infection, allergic 
reaction, pain at implant site, implantable pulse gen-
erator seroma, epidural fibrosis, epidural hematoma, dural

puncture, and, rarely, neurological injury.30,31,49–52,57–60 The 
most common biological complication is infection with 
a rate between 3% and 8%, and the majority of these are 
superficial.30 As is seen in the more recent literature,30 
incidence of infection can be minimized via pre and post-
operative antibiotic use and appropriate skin preparation. The 
occurrence of dural puncture is reported as between 0.3% 
and 2%.53  Other adverse biological events such as epidural 
fibrosis, compressive phenomenon, or spinal cord injury, 
while serious, are rare.
The Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Com-
mittee has recommended a number of criteria and adaptations 
to practice to help reduce complications: physician training 
and mentoring, the appropriate and careful selection of 
patients, a continued focus on equipment development and 
innovation, as well as the dissemination and application of 
practice and research-based advances.30
Patient-focused perspectives 
As this field strives to provide high-quality, transparent, and 
independent empirical evidence for SCS therapies, it is pos-
sible to overlook the primary rationale for SCS treatment in 
the first place: patient benefit.  
Patients suffering from chronic pain are often misdiagnosed 
or treated inappropriately.  Improvements to training in pain 
management are needed, beginning at the undergraduate medi-
cal level. At present, the time allocated to pain management is 
generally inadequate; for instance, in the United Kingdom, the 
median time spent on pain management by a medical student is 
13 hours, and sometimes it is as little as 6 hours.2 Indeed, when
“the undergraduate training of all healthcare professionals 
is analyzed, education about the identification, assessment, 
and treatment of pain represents less than 1% of university-
based teaching – yet pain is the most common reason for 
patients to consult their general practitioner.”2
The ensuing repercussions may include inadequate 
diagnosis, inappropriate treatments, and extended periods of 
mismanagement. Further complicating the treatment of this 
cohort has been the inclusion of neuromodulation therapies 
as a treatment of last resort.54 Y
et research has shown that 
shifting SCS forward in the treatment algorithm of refractory 
chronic pain is associated with better patient outcomes.44,55 
 
In recent years, many researchers and practitioners have 
included patient satisfaction (alongside empirical measures) 
as a clinically useful metric for assessing SCS treatment 
success.23 When reported, overall patient satisfaction is high 
for the vast majority of SCS patients, perhaps reflecting the 
efficacy of SCS treatment, but may also reflect factors such

as limitations of alternative treatments, safety, and toler-
ability of SCS and the rapidity of onset and durability of 
SCS treatment.56  
Moreover, under current arrangements, most patients 
access SCS treatment through private health insurance 
schemes or through compensatory bodies such as workers 
compensation schemes.57 For patients who do not qualify for 
these funding systems, the immediate cost outlay would likely 
post a significant financial barrier to treatment.57 The SCS 
specialty should aim to support the provision of equitable 
and accessible treatment for all.
Conclusion
Significant evidence exists for traditional SCS as a safe, 
clinical, and cost-effective treatment for many chronic pain 
conditions. Indeed, the field is rapidly evolving, and there is 
now Level I evidence for newer techniques including HF10 
SCS and DRG SCS, which demonstrate dramatic improve-
ments in overall efficacy in reducing pain in specific condi-
tions, including failed back surgery, back pain, neuropathic 
leg pain, CRPS, and causalgia.  
Furthermore, the field has increasingly met the challenge 
of not only having newer devices to achieve these outcomes 
but concurrently reducing the risks of complications and 
adverse events.  
The data supporting SCS in its multiple forms are com-
pelling and have reached a level that now demands that this 
therapy be considered earlier in the treatment continuum and to 
be no longer regarded as simply an end-stage salvage therapy.
