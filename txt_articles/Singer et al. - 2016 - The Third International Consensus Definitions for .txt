IMPORTANCE Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable
advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function,
morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and
epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.
PROCESS A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and
epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European
Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through
meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting,
followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and
endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment).
KEY FINDINGS FROM EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Limitations of previous definitions included an
excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum
through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are
currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in
reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis
was redundant.
RECOMMENDATIONS Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ
dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital
mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which
particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with
a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically
identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg
or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of
hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.
In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients
with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes
typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute
a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater,
altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace
previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and
facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of
developing sepsis.

S
epsis, a syndrome of physiologic, pathologic, and bio-
chemical abnormalities induced by infection, is a major
public health concern, accounting for more than $20 bil-
lion (5.2%) of total US hospital costs in 2011.1 The reported inci-
dence of sepsis is increasing,2,3 likely reflecting aging populations
with more comorbidities, greater recognition,4 and, in some coun-
tries, reimbursement-favorable coding.5 Although the true inci-
dence is unknown, conservative estimates indicate that sepsis is a
leading cause of mortality and critical illness worldwide.6,7 Further-
more, there is increasing awareness that patients who survive sep-
sis often have long-term physical, psychological, and cognitive dis-
abilities with significant health care and social implications.8
A 1991 consensus conference9 developed initial definitions
that focused on the then-prevailing view that sepsis resulted from
a host’
s systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to
infection (Box 1). Sepsis complicated by organ dysfunction was
termed severe sepsis, which could progress to septic shock,
defined as “sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite
adequate fluid resuscitation.”A 2001 task force, recognizing limi-
tations with these definitions, expanded the list of diagnostic cri-
teria but did not offer alternatives because of the lack of support-
ing evidence.10 In effect, the definitions of sepsis, septic shock,
and organ dysfunction have remained largely unchanged for
more than 2 decades.
The Process of Developing New Definitions
Recognizing the need to reexamine the current definitions,11 the
European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of
Critical Care Medicine convened a task force of 19 critical care,
infectious disease, surgical, and pulmonary specialists in January
2014. Unrestricted funding support was provided by the societies,
and the task force retained complete autonomy. The societies
each nominated cochairs (Drs Deutschman and Singer), who
selected members according to their scientific expertise in sepsis
epidemiology, clinical trials, and basic or translational research.
The group engaged in iterative discussions via 4 face-to-face
meetings between January 2014 and January 2015, email corre-
spondence, and voting. Existing definitions were revisited in light
of an enhanced appreciation of the pathobiology and the avail-
ability of large electronic health record databases and patient
cohorts.
An expert consensus process, based on a current under-
standing of sepsis-induced changes in organ function, morphol-
ogy, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation
(collectively referred to as pathobiology), forged agreement on
updated definition(s) and the criteria to be tested in the clinical
arena (content validity). The distinction between definitions and
clinical criteria is discussed below. The agreement between
potential clinical criteria (construct validity) and the ability of the
criteria to predict outcomes typical of sepsis, such as need for
intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death (predictive validity, a
form of criterion validity), were then tested. These explorations
were performed in multiple large electronic health record data-
bases that also addressed the absence (missingness) of individual
elements of different organ dysfunction scores and the question
of generalizability (ecologic validity).12 A systematic literature
review and Delphi consensus methods were also used for the
definition and clinical criteria describing septic shock.13
When compiled, the task force recommendations with sup-
porting evidence, including original research, were circulated to
major international societies and other relevant bodies for peer
review and endorsement (31 endorsing societies are listed at the
end of this article).
Issues Addressed by the Task Force
The task force sought to differentiate sepsis from uncomplicated
infection and to update definitions of sepsis and septic shock to be
consistent with improved understanding of the pathobiology. A
definition is the description of an illness concept; thus, a definition
of sepsis should describe what sepsis “is.”This chosen approach
allowed discussion of biological concepts that are currently incom-
pletely understood, such as genetic influences and cellular abnor-
malities. The sepsis illness concept is predicated on infection as its
trigger, acknowledging the current challenges in the microbiologi-
cal identification of infection. It was not, however, within the task
force brief to examine definitions of infection.
The task force recognized that sepsis is a syndrome without,
at present, a validated criterion standard diagnostic test. There is
currently no process to operationalize the definitions of sepsis
and septic shock, a key deficit that has led to major variations in
reported incidence and mortality rates (see later discussion). The
task force determined that there was an important need for fea-
tures that can be identified and measured in individual patients
and sought to provide such criteria to offer uniformity. Ideally,
these clinical criteria should identify all the elements of sepsis
(infection, host response, and organ dysfunction), be simple to
obtain, and be available promptly and at a reasonable cost or bur-
den. Furthermore, it should be possible to test the validity of
these criteria with available large clinical data sets and, ultimately,
prospectively. In addition, clinical criteria should be available to
provide practitioners in out-of-hospital, emergency department,
and hospital ward settings with the capacity to better identify
patients with suspected infection likely to progress to a life-
threatening state. Such early recognition is particularly important
because prompt management of septic patients may improve
outcomes.4
In addition, to provide a more consistent and reproducible pic-
ture of sepsis incidence and outcomes, the task force sought to in-
tegrate the biology and clinical identification of sepsis with its epi-
demiology and coding.

Identified Challenges and Opportunities
Assessing the Validity of Definitions
When There Is No Gold Standard
Sepsis is not a specific illness but rather a syndrome encompassing
a still-uncertain pathobiology. At present, it can be identified by a
constellation of clinical signs and symptoms in a patient with sus-
pected infection. Because no gold standard diagnostic test exists,
the task force sought definitions and supporting clinical criteria that
were clear and fulfilled multiple domains of usefulness and validity.
Improved Understanding of Sepsis Pathobiology
Sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen
that may be significantly amplified by endogenous factors.14,15 The
original conceptualization of sepsis as infection with at least 2 of
the 4 SIRS criteria focused solely on inflammatory excess. How-
ever, the validity of SIRS as a descriptor of sepsis pathobiology has
been challenged. Sepsis is now recognized to involve early activa-
tion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses,16 along with
major modifications in nonimmunologic pathways such as cardio-
vascular, neuronal, autonomic, hormonal, bioenergetic, metabolic,
and coagulation,14,17,18 all of which have prognostic significance.
Organ dysfunction, even when severe, is not associated with sub-
stantial cell death.19
The broader perspective also emphasizes the significant bio-
logical and clinical heterogeneity in affected individuals,20 with
age, underlying comorbidities, concurrent injuries (including sur-
gery) and medications, and source of infection adding further
complexity.21 This diversity cannot be appropriately recapitulated
in either animal models or computer simulations.14 With further
validation, multichannel molecular signatures (eg, transcriptomic,
metabolomic, proteomic) will likely lead to better characterization
of specific population subsets.22,23 Such signatures may also help
to differentiate sepsis from noninfectious insults such as trauma or
pancreatitis, in which a similar biological and clinical host response
may be triggered by endogenous factors.24 Key concepts of sepsis
describing its protean nature are highlighted in Box 2.
Variable Definitions
A better understanding of the underlying pathobiology has been
accompanied by the recognition that many existing terms (eg, sep-
sis, severe sepsis) are used interchangeably, whereas others are
redundant (eg, sepsis syndrome) or overly narrow (eg, septicemia).
Inconsistent strategies in selecting International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and ICD-10 codes have com-
pounded the problem.
Sepsis
The current use of 2 or more SIRS criteria (Box 1) to identify sepsis
was unanimously considered by the task force to be unhelpful.
Changes in white blood cell count, temperature, and heart rate
reflect inflammation, the host response to “
danger”in the form of
infection or other insults. The SIRS criteria do not necessarily indi-
cate a dysregulated, life-threatening response. SIRS criteria are
present in many hospitalized patients, including those who never
develop infection and never incur adverse outcomes (poor dis-
criminant validity).25 In addition, 1 in 8 patients admitted to criti-
cal care units in Australia and New Zealand with infection and new
organ failure did not have the requisite minimum of 2 SIRS criteria
to fulfill the definition of sepsis (poor concurrent validity) yet had
protracted courses with significant morbidity and mortality.26
Discriminant validity and convergent validity constitute the 2
domains of construct validity; the SIRS criteria thus perform
poorly on both counts.
Organ Dysfunction or Failure
Severity of organ dysfunction has been assessed with various scor-
ing systems that quantify abnormalities according to clinical find-
ings, laboratory data, or therapeutic interventions. Differences in
these scoring systems have also led to inconsistency in reporting.
The predominant score in current use is the Sequential Organ Fail-
ure Assessment (SOFA) (originally the Sepsis-related Organ Failure
Assessment27) (Table 1).28 A higher SOFA score is associated with
an increased probability of mortality.28 The score grades abnormal-
ity by organ system and accounts for clinical interventions. How-
ever, laboratory variables, namely, PaO2, platelet count, creatinine
level, and bilirubin level, are needed for full computation. Further-
more, selection of variables and cutoff values were developed by
consensus, and SOFA is not well known outside the critical care
community. Other organ failure scoring systems exist, including
systems built from statistical models, but none are in common use.
Septic Shock
Multiple definitions for septic shock are currently in use. Further
details are provided in an accompanying article by Shankar-Hari
et al.13 A systematic review of the operationalization of current
definitions highlights significant heterogeneity in reported
mortality. This heterogeneity resulted from differences in the
clinical variables chosen (varying cutoffs for systolic or mean
blood pressure ± diverse levels of hyperlactatemia ± vasopressor
use ± concurrent new organ dysfunction ± defined fluid resuscita-
tion volume/targets), the data source and coding methods, and
enrollment dates.
Box 2. Key Concepts of Sepsis
•Sepsis is the primary cause of death from infection, especially if
not recognized and treated promptly. Its recognition mandates
urgent attention.
•Sepsis is a syndrome shaped by pathogen factors and host factors
(eg, sex, race and other genetic determinants, age, comorbidities,
environment) with characteristics that evolve over time. What
differentiates sepsis from infection is an aberrant or dysregulated
host response and the presence of organ dysfunction.
•Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction may be occult; therefore,
its presence should be considered in any patient presenting with
infection. Conversely, unrecognized infection may be the cause of
new-onset organ dysfunction. Any unexplained organ dysfunction
should thus raise the possibility of underlying infection.
•The clinical and biological phenotype of sepsis can be modified
by preexisting acute illness, long-standing comorbidities,
medication, and interventions.
•Specific infections may result in local organ dysfunction without
generating a dysregulated systemic host response.

A Need for Sepsis Definitions for the Public
and for Health Care Practitioners
Despite its worldwide importance,6,7 public awareness of sepsis is
poor.29 Furthermore, the various manifestations of sepsis make di-
agnosis difficult, even for experienced clinicians. Thus, the public
needs an understandable definition of sepsis, whereas health care
practitioners require improved clinical prompts and diagnostic ap-
proaches to facilitate earlier identification and an accurate quanti-
fication of the burden of sepsis.
Results/Recommendations
Definition of Sepsis
Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a
dysregulated host response to infection (Box 3). This new defini-
tionemphasizestheprimacyofthenonhomeostatichostresponse
to infection, the potential lethality that is considerably in excess of
astraightforwardinfection,andtheneedforurgentrecognition.As
described later, even a modest degree of organ dysfunction when
infection is first suspected is associated with an in-hospital mortal-
ity in excess of 10%. Recognition of this condition thus merits a
prompt and appropriate response.

Clinical Criteria to Identify Patients With Sepsis
The task force recognized that no current clinical measures reflect
the concept of a dysregulated host response. However, as noted
by the 2001 task force, many bedside examination findings and
routine laboratory test results are indicative of inflammation or
organ dysfunction.10 The task force therefore evaluated which
clinical criteria best identified infected patients most likely to
have sepsis. This objective was achieved by interrogating large
data sets of hospitalized patients with presumed infection,
assessing agreement among existing scores of inflammation
(SIRS)9 or organ dysfunction (eg, SOFA,27,28 Logistic Organ
Dysfunction System30) (construct validity), and delineating their
correlation with subsequent outcomes (predictive validity). In
addition, multivariable regression was used to explore the perfor-
mance of 21 bedside and laboratory criteria proposed by the 2001
task force.10
Full details are found in the accompanying article by Seymour
et al.12 In brief, electronic health record data of 1.3 million encoun-
ters at 12 community and academic hospitals within the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center health system in southwestern
Pennsylvania were studied. There were 148 907 patients with
suspected infection, identified as those who had body fluids
sampled for culture and received antibiotics. Two outcomes—
hospital mortality and mortality, ICU stay of 3 days or longer, or
both—were used to assess predictive validity both overall and
across deciles of baseline risk as determined by age, sex, and
comorbidity. For infected patients both inside and outside of the

ICU, predictive validity was determined with 2 metrics for each
criterion: the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) and the change in outcomes comparing patients
with a score of either 2 points or more or fewer than 2 points in
the different scoring systems9,27,30 across deciles of baseline risk.
These criteria were also analyzed in 4 external US and non-US
data sets containing data from more than 700 000 patients
(cared for in both community and tertiary care facilities) with
both community- and hospital-acquired infection.
In ICU patients with suspected infection in the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center data set, discrimination for hospital mor-
tality with SOFA (AUROC = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73-0.76) and the Logis-
tic Organ Dysfunction System (AUROC = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.76)
was superior to that with SIRS (AUROC = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.62-0.66).
The predictive validity of a change in SOFA score of 2 or greater was
similar (AUROC = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.70-0.73). For patients outside
the ICU and with suspected infection, discrimination of hospital
mortality with SOFA (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78-0.80) or
change in SOFA score (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78-0.79) was
similar to that with SIRS (AUROC = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75-0.77).
Because SOFA is better known and simpler than the Logistic
Organ Dysfunction System, the task force recommends using a
change in baseline of the total SOFA score of 2 points or more to
represent organ dysfunction (Box 3). The baseline SOFA score
should be assumed to be zero unless the patient is known to have
preexisting (acute or chronic) organ dysfunction before the onset
of infection. Patients with a SOFA score of 2 or more had an overall
mortality risk of approximately 10% in a general hospital popula-
tion with presumed infection.12 This is greater than the overall mor-
tality rate of 8.1% for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction,31
a condition widely held to be life threatening by the community
and by clinicians. Depending on a patient’
s baseline level of risk, a
SOFA score of 2 or greater identified a 2- to 25-fold increased risk of
dying compared with patients with a SOFA score less than 2.12
As discussed later, the SOFA score is not intended to be used
as a tool for patient management but as a means to clinically char-
acterize a septic patient. Components of SOFA (such as creatinine
or bilirubin level) require laboratory testing and thus may not
promptly capture dysfunction in individual organ systems. Other
elements, such as the cardiovascular score, can be affected by iat-
rogenic interventions. However, SOFA has widespread familiarity
within the critical care community and a well-validated relationship
to mortality risk. It can be scored retrospectively, either manually or
by automated systems, from clinical and laboratory measures often
performed routinely as part of acute patient management. The task
force noted that there are a number of novel biomarkers that can
identify renal and hepatic dysfunction or coagulopathy earlier than
the elements used in SOFA, but these require broader validation
before they can be incorporated into the clinical criteria describing
sepsis. Future iterations of the sepsis definitions should include an
updated SOFA score with more optimal variable selection, cutoff
values, and weighting, or a superior scoring system.
Screening for Patients Likely to Have Sepsis
A parsimonious clinical model developed with multivariable
logistic regression identified that any 2 of 3 clinical variables—
Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 or less, systolic blood pressure of
100 mm Hg or less, and respiratory rate 22/min or greater—offered
predictive validity (AUROC = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.82) similar to
that of the full SOFA score outside the ICU.12 This model was robust
to multiple sensitivity analyses including a more simple assessment
of altered mentation (Glasgow Coma Scale score <15) and in the
out-of-hospital, emergency department, and ward settings within
the external US and non-US data sets.
For patients with suspected infection within the ICU, the SOFA
score had predictive validity (AUROC = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73-0.76)
superior to that of this model (AUROC = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.64-0.68),
likely reflecting the modifying effects of interventions (eg, vaso-
pressors, sedative agents, mechanical ventilation). Addition of lac-
tate measurement did not meaningfully improve predictive validity
but may help identify patients at intermediate risk.
This new measure, termed qSOFA (for quick SOFA) and incor-
porating altered mentation, systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg
or less, and respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, provides simple
bedside criteria to identify adult patients with suspected infection
who are likely to have poor outcomes (Box 4). Because predictive
validity was unchanged (P = .55), the task force chose to empha-
size altered mentation because it represents any Glasgow Coma

Scale score less than 15 and will reduce the measurement burden.
Although qSOFA is less robust than a SOFA score of 2 or greater in
the ICU, it does not require laboratory tests and can be assessed
quickly and repeatedly. The task force suggests that qSOFA criteria
be used to prompt clinicians to further investigate for organ dys-
function, to initiate or escalate therapy as appropriate, and to con-
sider referral to critical care or increase the frequency of monitor-
ing, if such actions have not already been undertaken. The task
force considered that positive qSOFA criteria should also prompt
consideration of possible infection in patients not previously recog-
nized as infected.

Clinical Criteria to Identify Septic Shock

rent definitions were operationalized. This informed a Delphi pro-
cess conducted among the task force members to determine the
updated septic shock definition and clinical criteria. This process
was iterative and informed by interrogation of databases, as sum-
marized below.
The Delphi process assessed agreements on descriptions of
termssuchas“hypotension,”“
needforvasopressortherapy,”“
raised
lactate,”and “
adequate fluid resuscitation”for inclusion within the
new clinical criteria. The majority (n = 14/17; 82.4%) of task force
members voting on this agreed that hypotension should be de-
noted as a mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg according to
thepragmaticdecisionthatthiswasmostoftenrecordedindatasets
derivedfrompatientswithsepsis.Systolicbloodpressurewasused
asaqSOFAcriterionbecauseitwasmostwidelyrecordedintheelec-
tronic health record data sets.
A majority (11/17; 64.7%) of the task force agreed, whereas 2
(11.8%) disagreed, that an elevated lactate level is reflective of cel-
lular dysfunction in sepsis, albeit recognizing that multiple factors,
such as insufficient tissue oxygen delivery, impaired aerobic respi-
ration, accelerated aerobic glycolysis, and reduced hepatic clear-
ance, also contribute.32 Hyperlactatemia is, however, a reasonable
marker of illness severity, with higher levels predictive of higher
mortality.33 Criteria for “
adequate fluid resuscitation”or “need for
vasopressor therapy”could not be explicitly specified because
these are highly user dependent, relying on variable monitoring
modalities and hemodynamic targets for treatment.34 Other
aspects of management, such as sedation and volume status
assessment, are also potential confounders in the hypotension-
vasopressor relationship.
By Delphi consensus process, 3 variables were identified
(hypotension, elevated lactate level, and a sustained need for vaso-
pressor therapy) to test in cohort studies, exploring alternative
combinations and different lactate thresholds. The first database
interrogated was the Surviving Sepsis Campaign’
s international
multicenter registry of 28 150 infected patients with at least 2 SIRS
criteria and at least 1 organ dysfunction criterion. Hypotension was
defined as a mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg, the only
available cutoff. A total of 18 840 patients with vasopressor
therapy, hypotension, or hyperlactatemia (>2 mmol/L [18 mg/dL])
after volume resuscitation were identified. Patients with fluid-
resistant hypotension requiring vasopressors and with hyperlacta-
temia were used as the referent group for comparing between-
group differences in the risk-adjusted odds ratio for mortality. Risk
adjustment was performed with a generalized estimating equation
population-averaged logistic regression model with exchangeable
correlation structure.
Risk-adjusted hospital mortality was significantly higher
(P < .001 compared with the referent group) in patients with fluid-
resistant hypotension requiring vasopressors and hyperlactatemia
(42.3% and 49.7% at thresholds for serum lactate level of
>2 mmol/L [18 mg/dL] or >4 mmol/L [36 mg/dL], respectively)
compared with either hyperlactatemia alone (25.7% and 29.9%
mortality for those with serum lactate level of >2 mmol/L
[18 mg/dL] and >4 mmol/L [36 mg/dL], respectively) or with fluid-
resistant hypotension requiring vasopressors but with lactate level
of 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) or less (30.1%).
With the same 3 variables and similar categorization, the unad-
justed mortality in infected patients within 2 unrelated large elec-
tronic health record data sets (University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center [12 hospitals; 2010-2012; n = 5984] and Kaiser Permanente
Northern California [20 hospitals; 2009-2013; n = 54 135]) showed
reproducible results. The combination of hypotension, vasopressor
use, and lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) identified
patients with mortality rates of 54% at University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center (n = 315) and 35% at Kaiser Permanente Northern
California (n = 8051). These rates were higher than the mortality
rates of 25.2% (n = 147) and 18.8% (n = 3094) in patients with
hypotension alone, 17.9% (n = 1978) and 6.8% (n = 30 209) in
patients with lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) alone,
and 20% (n = 5984) and 8% (n = 54 135) in patients with sepsis at
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente

cal criteria correlate with ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes. The task
force also endorsed the recently published lay definition that
“
sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body’
s
response to infection injures its own tissues,”which is consistent
with the newly proposed definitions described above.35 To trans-
mit the importance of sepsis to the public at large, the task force
emphasizes that sepsis may portend death, especially if not recog-
nized early and treated promptly. Indeed, despite advances that
include vaccines, antibiotics, and acute care, sepsis remains the pri-
mary cause of death from infection. Widespread educational cam-
paigns are recommended to better inform the public about this
lethal condition.
Controversies and Limitations
There are inherent challenges in defining sepsis and septic shock.
First and foremost, sepsis is a broad term applied to an incom-
pletely understood process. There are, as yet, no simple and unam-
biguous clinical criteria or biological, imaging, or laboratory features
that uniquely identify a septic patient. The task force recognized
the impossibility of trying to achieve total consensus on all points.
Pragmatic compromises were necessary, so emphasis was placed
on generalizability and the use of readily measurable identifiers
that could best capture the current conceptualization of underlying
mechanisms. The detailed, data-guided deliberations of the task
force during an 18-month period and the peer review provided by
bodies approached for endorsement highlighted multiple areas for
discussion. It is useful to identify these issues and provide justifica-
tions for the final positions adopted.
Thenewdefinitionofsepsisreflectsanup-to-dateviewofpatho-
biology, particularly in regard to what distinguishes sepsis from un-
complicated infection. The task force also offers easily measurable
clinical criteria that capture the essence of sepsis yet can be trans-
lated and recorded objectively (Figure). Although these criteria
cannot be all-encompassing, they are simple to use and offer con-
sistencyofterminologytoclinicalpractitioners,researchers,admin-
istrators, and funders. The physiologic and biochemical tests re-
quiredtoscoreSOFAareoftenincludedinroutinepatientcare,and
scoring can be performed retrospectively.
The initial, retrospective analysis indicated that qSOFA could
be a useful clinical tool, especially to physicians and other practi-
tioners working outside the ICU (and perhaps even outside the
hospital, given that qSOFA relies only on clinical examination find-
ings), to promptly identify infected patients likely to fare poorly.
However, because most of the data were extracted from extracted
US databases, the task force strongly encourages prospective vali-
dation in multiple US and non-US health care settings to confirm its
robustness and potential for incorporation into future iterations of
the definitions. This simple bedside score may be particularly rel-
evant in resource-poor settings in which laboratory data are not
readily available, and when the literature about sepsis epidemiol-
ogy is sparse.
Neither qSOFA nor SOFA is intended to be a stand-alone defi-
nition of sepsis. It is crucial, however, that failure to meet 2 or more
qSOFA or SOFA criteria should not lead to a deferral of investigation
or treatment of infection or to a delay in any other aspect of care
deemed necessary by the practitioners. qSOFA can be rapidly
scored at the bedside without the need for blood tests, and it is
hoped that it will facilitate prompt identification of an infection that
poses a greater threat to life. If appropriate laboratory tests have
not already been undertaken, this may prompt testing to identify
biochemical organ dysfunction. These data will primarily aid patient
management but will also enable subsequent SOFA scoring. The
task force wishes to stress that SIRS criteria may still remain useful
for the identification of infection.
Some have argued that lactate measurement should be man-
dated as an important biochemical identifier of sepsis in an infected
patient. Because lactate measurement offered no meaningful
change in the predictive validity beyond 2 or more qSOFA criteria in
the identification of patients likely to be septic, the task force could
not justify the added complexity and cost of lactate measurement
alongside these simple bedside criteria. The task force recommen-
dations should not, however, constrain the monitoring of lactate as
a guide to therapeutic response or as an indicator of illness severity.

Our approach to hyperlactatemia within the clinical criteria for
septic shock also generated conflicting views. Some task force
members suggested that elevated lactate levels represent an
important marker of “
cryptic shock”in the absence of hypotension.
Others voiced concern about its specificity and that the nonavail-
ability of lactate measurement in resource-poor settings would
preclude a diagnosis of septic shock. No solution can satisfy all con-
cerns. Lactate level is a sensitive, albeit nonspecific, stand-alone
indicator of cellular or metabolic stress rather than “
shock.”
32 How-
ever, the combination of hyperlactatemia with fluid-resistant hypo-
tension identifies a group with particularly high mortality and
thus offers a more robust identifier of the physiologic and epide-
miologic concept of septic shock than either criterion alone. Identi-
fication of septic shock as a distinct entity is of epidemiologic rather
than clinical importance. Although hyperlactatemia and hypoten-
sion are clinically concerning as separate entities, and although
the proposed criteria differ from those of other recent consensus
statements,34 clinical management should not be affected. The
greater precision offered by data-driven analysis will improve
reporting of both the incidence of septic shock and the associated
mortality, in which current figures vary 4-fold.3 The criteria
may also enhance insight into the pathobiology of sepsis and
septic shock. In settings in which lactate measurement is not avail-
able, the use of a working diagnosis of septic shock using hypoten-
sion and other criteria consistent with tissue hypoperfusion
(eg, delayed capillary refill36) may be necessary.
Thetaskforcefocusedonadultpatientsyetrecognizestheneed
todevelopsimilarupdateddefinitionsforpediatricpopulationsand
the use of clinical criteria that take into account their age-
dependent variation in normal physiologic ranges and in patho-
physiologic responses.
Implications
The task force has generated new definitions that incorporate an
up-to-date understanding of sepsis biology, including organ dys-
function (Box 3). However, the lack of a criterion standard, similar
to its absence in many other syndromic conditions, precludes
unambiguous validation and instead requires approximate estima-
tions of performance across a variety of validity domains, as out-
lined above. To assist the bedside clinician, and perhaps prompt an
escalation of care if not already instituted, simple clinical criteria
(qSOFA) that identify patients with suspected infection who are
likely to have poor outcomes, that is, a prolonged ICU course and
death, have been developed and validated.
This approach has important epidemiologic and investigative
implications. The proposed criteria should aid diagnostic categori-
zation once initial assessment and immediate management
are completed. qSOFA or SOFA may at some point be used as
entry criteria for clinical trials. There is potential conflict with cur-
rent organ dysfunction scoring systems, early warning scores,
ongoing research studies, and pathway developments. Many of
these scores and pathways have been developed by consensus,
whereas an important aspect of the current work is the interroga-
tion of data, albeit retrospectively, from large patient populations.
The task force maintains that standardization of definitions
and clinical criteria is crucial in ensuring clear communication and
a more accurate appreciation of the scale of the problem of sep-
sis. An added challenge is that infection is seldom confirmed
microbiologically when treatment is started; even when micro-
biological tests are completed, culture-positive “sepsis” is
observed in only 30% to 40% of cases. Thus, when sepsis epide-

miology is assessed and reported, operationalization will neces-
sarily involve proxies such as antibiotic commencement or a clini-
cally determined probability of infection. Future epidemiology
studies should consider reporting the proportion of microbiology-
positive sepsis.
Greater clarity and consistency will also facilitate research and

to enact, so the recommendations provided in Table 2 demon-
strate how the new definitions can be applied in the interim within
the current ICD system.
The debate and discussion that this work will inevitably
generate are encouraged. Aspects of the new definitions do
indeed rely on expert opinion; further understanding of the biol-
ogy of sepsis, the availability of new diagnostic approaches, and
enhanced collection of data will fuel their continued reevaluation
and revision.
Conclusions
These updated definitions and clinical criteria should clarify long-
used descriptors and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely
management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing it. This
process, however, remains a work in progress. As is done with soft-
wareandothercodingupdates,thetaskforcerecommendsthatthe
new definition be designated Sepsis-3, with the 1991 and 2001 it-
erations being recognized as Sepsis-1 and Sepsis-2, respectively, to
emphasize the need for future iterations.
