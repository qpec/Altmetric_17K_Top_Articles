Background: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are an important public health challenge. 
The classification of baseball and softball as low contact sports and their association with 
extremity injuries cause individuals to overlook the risk of TBI in baseball and softball.
Purpose: To summarize our knowledge of the epidemiology and risk factors of TBIs 
associated with baseball and softball with an aim to better design and implement pre-
ventive strategies.
methods: A search algorithm containing keywords that were synonymous to the terms 
“TBI,” “baseball” was applied to the following nine databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, 
PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, PsychINFO, AMED, Cochrane library. Cited 
reference lists of identified articles were also consulted yielding a total of eighty-eight 
articles for full review. The search was concluded on November 14, 2016. The level of 
evidence was evaluated according to the guidelines from Strengthening the Reporting of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement.
Results: Twenty-nine articles published between 2000 and 2016 met the criteria for 
analysis. Collectively, they examined the years 1982–2015 and identified 242,731 
baseball-and softball-related TBIs. The most explored outcome of TBI was concussion. 
The average injury rate per 1,000 athletic exposures was 0.13 (range 0.03–0.46). The 
most common mechanism of injury was being struck by bat for younger players and 
being struck by ball for older athletes (adolescent and beyond). Rates of TBI were on 
average 4.17 times greater in games compared to practices. Females were on average 
2.04 times more likely to sustain a TBI than males. Severity of TBIs varied considerably 
from mild and returning to the field on the same day, to immediate death. Generally, 
there is poor compliance with helmet use and return-to-play post-concussion guidelines. 
 
An increase TBI rates was observed over time. Multifaceted preventive strategies must 
be implemented to reduce the frequency and burden of these injuries.
conclusion: It is difficult to compare the epidemiologic trends of TBI in baseball and 
softball due critical differences in the methods employed across the studies. Additional 
research is needed to provide a greater understanding of baseball- and softball-related 
TBI and to aid in the development of prevention and management modules.

iNtRODUctiON
Each year, over six million children play in organized baseball 
leagues and up to thirteen million more play non-organized 
baseball (1). Given that baseball/softball is most commonly 
played in North America, most literature to date comes from 
North America, with very little arising from Central America, 
Asia, the Caribbean, and other countries. Most injuries in 
baseball and softball involve the upper and lower extremities 
(2, 3). However, with balls being thrown at high speeds (4, 5), 
the use of bats and the potential for player to player collision, 
it is not surprising that baseball and softball players can suffer 
potentially serious injuries to the head and brain. The burden 
of head trauma related to baseball and softball requires further 
investigation. For example, in 2009, 38,942 patients with base-
ball-related head injuries were treated in American emergency 
rooms alone. However, many more individuals suffered head 
injuries but did not seek care in an emergency department (ED) 
(6). Previous papers have studied these injuries, but only as parts 
of larger reviews of TBIs across multiple sports and as such the 
amount of information is limited (7, 8). Given the incidence of 
head injuries and the potentially lifelong effects of TBIs, it is 
imperative to undertake steps directed toward the prevention 
of baseball-and softball-related TBIs. Before effective strategies 
can be implemented and evaluated, the factors associated with 
baseball and softball TBI must be well understood. The purpose 
of our study is to summarize the current published literature 
related to TBIs in baseball and softball, to identify avenues for 
injury prevention and to identify gaps in the literature giving 
potential insight into future research.

Protocol
Our methodology and reporting has been done according 
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (9). PRISMA is evidence 
based minimum checklist for reporting in systematic reviews 
and meta-analysis. PRISMA provides authors with a framework 
and ensures for high quality reporting in systematic reviews. 
 
It is recommended by the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors and is referred to in the Uniform Requirements 
for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (10).
article Selection criteria
Identified studies were manually reviewed for relevance through 
the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1). 
Peer-reviewed literature that focused on TBI or concussion in 
baseball, softball, or T-ball was included. All the following were 
excluded (1) studies that do not have samples that included base-
ball, softball, or T-ball players; (2) studies solely examining non-
TBI alone, such as only ocular, facial, or cardiac and extremities 
injuries; (3) original research studies that were not published in 
peer-reviewed journals; (4) review articles; (5) abstracts, com-
ments, case reports, newspaper articles, and conference notes; 
(6) laboratory studies on prevention methods (e.g., testing hard-
ness of various ball types via Hybrid III dummy).
information Sources
Using search terms including: “Traumatic brain injury,” “TBI,” 
“craniocerebral trauma,” “concussion,” “cerebral contusion,” 
“head injury,” “hemorrhage,” “hematoma,” “brain damage,” “mild 
traumatic brain injury,” “mTBI,” “penetrating brain,” “closed 
head injury,” “baseball,” “softball,” “MLB,” “major league base-
ball,” “minor league baseball,”” MiLB,” “tee ball,” and “t-ball,” all 
published articles related to TBI and baseball, softball, and T-ball 
were reviewed through Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, 
Healthstar, PsychINFO, AMED, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. 
Cited reference lists of identified articles were also consulted. 
 
The search concluded on November 14, 2016. Our Medline 
search strategy for articles from 1946 to November Week 1 2016 
is presented in Table 1.
Data extraction
Data from the included studies were extracted twice inde-
pendently using a standardized and piloted electronic form 
(Microsoft Excel). Any differences in extraction were resolved 
by consensus. Information was extracted on the publication 
(first author name, publication year), study details (country of 
origin, design, injury reporting system used, length of study, 
setting), TBI definition, sample size, use of protective equipment 
and outcomes (injury rate injury severity), and mechanism of 
injury. Studies were also categorized to MLB (a professional 
baseball organization in the United States and Canada with 30 
teams and 750 active players), Minor League Baseball (network 
of clubs that are each associated with a major league club; con-
sisting of approximately 7,500 players), Little League Baseball 
(organization for young baseball players ages 7–18), high school, 
university/collegiate, and by age groups (players ages 0–19 are 
considered as youth).
Summary measures
Figure 1 presents the consort diagram and the characteristics 
and overview of included studies are illustrated in a summary 
table. Specific definition of TBI, mechanism of injury, use of 
protective equipment, gender differences, post injury outcomes, 
TBI rates, and any additional trends the study observed were 
recorded and are also summarized in tables.
methodological Quality of Studies
The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE) statement (2008) was used to eval-
uate the overall strength of all 29 included studies (11). The 
checklist was designed to measure the methodological quality 
of observational studies, including cohort, case–control, and 
cross-sectional studies. Its use is endorsed by a growing number 
of biomedical journals and is recommended by the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (10).
The checklist consists of 22 criteria resulting in a maximum 
 
of 22 points, with higher scores corresponding to superior 
qualities. Articles with quality scores from 16–22 were considered 
“good,” 9–15 as “moderate” and less than 9 as “poor.” Articles were 
assessed by two research assistants and given scores were aver-
aged. The raters did not differ by more than three points in their

quality assessment of any single study, and different raters’ scores 
were averaged.
ReSULtS
Characteristics of the included studies and definitions of TBI 
are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Rates of injury, mechanisms 
of injury and protective equipment wear, and injury outcomes 
are summarized in Tables 4–6, respectively. Table 7 provides 
a framework to conceptualize, predict, prevent, and mitigate 
baseball- and softball-related TBIs.
Study Selection
Published between 1996 and 2016, the 29 studies collectively 
examined the years 1982–2016 (Table 2). Of the included 
studies, 23 were published after 2005, illustrating the increase 
of TBI research in recent years. Geographically, studies covered 
the United States (n = 27), Canada (n = 1), and New Zealand 
(n = 1). A variety of sources for TBIs in baseball and softball 
were identified including hospital or trauma center’s ED 
(n = 6), national and district injury surveillance/reporting 
systems (n = 17), MLB video coverage (n = 2), MLB electronic 
medical records or disabled list (n = 2), independent research-
ers (n = 1), and insurance claims (n = 1). Comprehensive 
data were also gathered from high school and collegiate 
level reporting systems using certified athletic trainers. 
Although each source provided a limited view of baseball- 
and softball-related TBIs, together they provided practical 
insight and allowed for the identification of patterns on the 
 
incidence of TBI.

Quality of Studies
The articles ranged in STROBE scores from 9 to 22, with an aver-
age of 19 and median of 20. All studies had moderate (n = 3) 
or good (n = 26) methodological quality. The most common 
deficiency among the included studies was the failure to describe 
efforts taken to address potential sources of bias (n = 9). Articles 
with methods described elsewhere corresponded to a lower 
score (n = 2).
injury characteristics
Overview
A total of 242,731 baseball- and softball-related TBIs [sum of 
column “#TBI(%)” in Table 2] were captured across the twenty-
nine studies included in this review. These do not represent 
the true number of TBIs in baseball and softball, but clearly 
identify TBI as a concern to baseball and softball players. For 
youth (under eighteen) baseball, TBIs accounted for 5.8% of all 
baseball-related injuries (25). Although a consistent definition 
of TBI was not found among the included studies, concussion 
was the most commonly identified outcome of interest (Table 3). 
Further, TBI rates varied according to sex (22), level of play 
 
(19, 20) (high school, collegiate, major, and minor leagues) and 
whether it was a game or practice (18, 28). The average injury 
rate (Table 4) per 1,000 athletic exposures (AE) was 0.13 (range 
0.03–0.46) (20, 33). The most common mechanisms of injury 
(Table 5) included being struck (by a ball or bat) (17) and col-
liding with another player (31). The distributions across these 
common mechanisms, however, varied according to age (17), 
gender (27), and level of play (20, 31). Finally, an increase in 
baseball- and softball-related TBIs was observed over time (26).
Changing Epidemiology
Despite the inclusion of many longitudinal studies in our 
review, few examined the changing epidemiological trends 
of baseball-and softball-related TBI. Nevertheless, the risk 
of concussion in high school boys’ baseball and girls’ softball 
increased between academic years 1997/1998 and 2011/2012 
(26, 33). In emergency rooms however, the relative frequency 
of baseball-related brain injuries observed in youth ages 5–19 
decreased from 1991 to 2008 (17). Importantly, the estimated 
number of total baseball related injuries in youth (i.e., sprains, 
soft tissue injuries, lacerations etc.) seen in emergency rooms 
also decreased between 1994 and 2006 (25).
Several studies using the NCAA database examined concus-
sion rates in women’s softball and men’s baseball. Total concussion 
rates per 1,000 AE in collegiate women’s softball were 0.14 (1998–
2004) (18), 0.19 (2005–2006) (19), 0.23 (2004–2009) (16), and 
0.26 (2011–2015) (23), suggesting an increase in concussion rate 
over time. In collegiate men’s baseball however, total concussion 
rates per 1,000 AE were 0.07 (1998–2004) (18), 0.09 (2005–2006) 
(19), 0.12 (2004–2009) (16), and 0.09 (2011–2015) (23).
Finally, it is important to note the growing research on TBI in 
recent years. Of the 29 included studies, 2 were published before 
2000, 4 were published 2000–2005, 9 were published between 
the years 2006–2010, and 14 studies were published after 2010 
(Table 2). This growing trend in TBI research may correspond 
to an increase in awareness and education surrounding TBI, and 
consequently influence the reported rate and incidence of injury.
Mechanisms of Injury
Mechanisms of injury were explored in thirteen studies (Table 5). 
Being struck by an implement (either ball or bat) was most the 
common mechanism of TBI among all age groups, and accounted 
for 75.4% (100,773/133,739) of reported TBIs in these studies 
(2–5, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 27, 28, 31, 37).
Eight studies identified the ball as the major cause of baseball- 
and softball-related TBI (2, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 28, 37). The percent-
age of TBIs due to being struck by the ball ranged from 17.5% (31) 
to 75% (13), with the majority of injuries resulting from pitched 
(48.5%) and batted (37.4%) balls (20). A study by Birchak et al. 
(13) found that being hit by a ball was 2.81 times more likely to 
affect the head than any other mechanism of injury. Being hit by 
a pitched ball resulted in a greater proportion of TBI in men’s 
baseball (26.1%) compared to women’s softball (5.2%) (27).

Collisions were another common mechanism of TBI (2, 31). 
Among high school and collegiate athletes, collision accounted 
for 55.0% (31) of TBIs in one study and 39% (2) in another. 
Furthermore, 29.6% of TBIs in US major and minor baseball 
leagues were due to collisions with another athlete (20).
For children ages 5–9, the bat was again identified as the main 
culprit of TBI. Being hit by a bat accounted to 53.8% of TBIs 
in boys and 60.9% in girls (17). Among 5–9 year-olds seen in 
the ED, being hit by bat was the most common mechanism of 
TBI for both male (53.8%) and female (60.9%) baseball players, 
often due to being too close to the batter (males: 26.1%, females: 
28.3%) (17). For children ages 10–19 year-olds however, the most 
common mechanism was being hit by the baseball for both male 
(58.0%) and female (70.1%) players (17).

Activity and Field Location
There were statistically significant differences in the number of 
TBIs based on the type of baseball activity players were engaged 
in at the time of injury (20). In the major and minor leagues, 
49.2% of TBIs occurred at the home plate (20). In collegiate 
women’s softball, the majority of TBIs (32%) occurred to the 
batter (28) while the majority of TBIs (30.3%) occurred to the 
middle infielder in collegiate men’s baseball (18). Among high 
school athletes, the proportion of concussion to the total number 
of baseball-related injuries did not differ dramatically according 
to player position (range 2.9–4.6%) (3). However, the majority 
 
of TBIs occurred to the batter in men’s baseball (50.6%) and to 
 
the catcher in women’s softball (29.7%) (19).
Use of Protective Equipment
The use of protective equipment during TBIs was only reported 
in five studies (Table 5) (2–5, 17). While helmets are mandatory 
in all formal baseball leagues (4, 5), recreational baseball play-
ers rarely used helmets (2, 17). Studies involving high school 
and collegiate teams, generally found poor compliance for the 
use of helmets, or any protective equipment (2, 3). Further, 
among the baseball-related TBI cases seen in the ED, only 6.7% 
reported the use of a helmet, 12.7% had no protection of any 
sort, and 74.1% did not specify whether protective equipment 
was worn (17).
Upon examination of catastrophic head injuries in high 
school and college baseball, 0/26 players wore a helmet at the 
time of injury, 9/26 players suffered a skull fracture, 3/26 players 
sustained a subdural hematoma, and 5/26 injuries were fatal 
(2). While helmet hit-by-pitch incidents are a leading cause of 
concussion in MLB, a retrospective case-control study found 
that 9/18 (50%) of helmet hit-by-pitch resulted in a concus-
sion diagnosis (4). In this study, the average pitch velocity that 
resulted in a concussion was 91.6 mph (compared to 90.8 mph 
for pitches that did not result in a concussion upon impact), 
no players observed loss of consciousness and the average days 
missed for concussed players was 14.2 (4).
High School vs. Collegiate Athletes
Eight studies, spanning the academic years 1995–2012, examined 
TBI of high school baseball and softball players (Table 2) (3, 19, 
26, 27, 31–33, 36). Injury rates per 1,000 AE (Table 4) ranged

from 0.03 (33) to 0.16 (27). Unanimously, the studies concluded 
that high school females were at a higher risk of TBIs than males, 
with average injury rates of 0.10 and 0.04 per 1,000 AE, respec-
tively (19, 26, 27, 31, 33, 36).
Collegiate baseball and softball was the focus of eight studies, 
and together, they covered the years 1988–2015 (16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 
28, 35, 38). Injury rates per 1,000 AE ranges from 0.03 in men’s 
baseball practices (19), to 0.42 in women’s softball competitions 
(23). As with high schools, these studies consistently concluded 
that females were at higher risk of TBIs than males, with total 
average injury rates of 0.08 and 0.18 per 1,000 AE, respectively 
(16, 19, 22, 23, 31).
Two additional studies compared TBIs in high schools and 
colleges across the US (2, 29). Overall, injury rates were generally 
greater for collegiate athletes compared to high school athletes 
(2, 19, 29).
Sex Differences
Fourteen studies examined gender differences in TBI with spe-
cific comparisons between baseball (males) and softball (females)

(Table 4) (16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26–29, 31–33, 36, 38). TBI rates (per 
1,000 AE) were on average 2.04 times greater in females playing 
softball compared to males playing baseball (16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 
26–28, 31, 33, 36, 38). Other research, that did not segregate males 
to baseball and females to softball (and included both sexes in 
baseball or softball) reinforced these findings illustrating females 
had a higher risk of TBI than males (13, 17). TBI injury rates were 
not available for youth under the age of 19 playing outside of an 
organized setting (i.e., outside of high school and little leagues).
Practice vs. Game Setting
In the eight studies that compared TBIs in practices and games, 
injury rates (per 1,000 AE) were found to be higher in a game 
setting (Table 4) (16, 18, 19, 23, 27, 28, 31, 38). Overall, the 
game-practice rate ratio was 4.17. The average rate ratio was 
greater for baseball (5.65; range 2.67–11.00) (19, 27) than for 
softball (2.58; range 0.44–5.29) (19).
The vast majority, 90.2% (n = 277) of TBI among professional 
baseball players in the major and minor leagues occurred in 
games, 1.6% (n = 5) in practice, 4.5% (n = 11) in spring training, 
and the remaining 3.6% (n = 11) from off-field, non-baseball 
injuries (20).
Among high school athletes, the proportion of concus-
sions relative to all baseball and softball injuries were higher 
in competition than in practice for men’s baseball (2.5% and 
1.8%, respectively), but lower in competition than in practice 
for women’s softball (0.04 and 8.9%, respectively) (32). Among 
collegiate athletes however, concussion represented a greater 
proportion of total injuries in competition than in practice 
for both baseball (4.2% of game injuries and 2.9% of practice 
injuries) and softball (6.4% of game injuries and 4.1% of practice 
injuries) (38).
Post Injury
The severity of baseball- and softball-related TBIs vary consider-
ably, from mild and returning to the field on the same day as 
injury, to immediate death (Table 6) (2, 36). In a descriptive 
epidemiologic study examining 100 US high schools and 180 
 
US colleges, Gessel et al. (19) found that 64.2% (1,279/1,992) of 
baseball and 68.8% (2,449/3,560) of softball players had symp-
toms resolved within 6 days following injury.
Seven other studies examined the recovering status of ath-
letes and time for symptom resolution, covering a total of 227 
TBIs (Table 6) (2, 4, 29–31, 34, 35). Generally, injuries were 
mild, with 28.6% (65/227) players making a full recovery and 
symptoms resolving within one week (2, 29, 31, 34). Moderate 
injuries, where symptoms resolved within 7–30 days following 
injury, accounted for 22.5% (51/227) of TBI (31, 34). 72 athletes 
(31.7%) had symptoms lasting less than 30 days, with exact time 
of symptom resolution unspecified (4, 30, 35). Injuries that 
required surgical procedures, resulted in disability or persisting 
symptoms were considered severe, and accounted for 14.1% 
(32/227) of TBI (2, 29, 34, 35). In total, eight athletes (3.5%) died 
following a TBI (2, 29). Of these deaths, three were fielders hit 
by a batted ball, one was a fielder colliding with another athlete, 
and one was a batter hit by a pitched ball (2). The mech

the remaining three fatalities are unspecified (29). Interestingly, 
more recent studies published in 2015 and 2016 did not report 
any fatalities (34, 35).
Among MLB players, 53% of concussions resulted in the 
player being placed on disabled leave (34). Compared to players 
on bereavement/paternity leave, concussed players that returned 
to play after they had recovered have significantly worse batting 
performance in nearly all metrics including: batting average, 
 
on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and home run percent-
age (34). Such differences, however, resolve 4–6 weeks after 
returning to play (34).
A study by Boden et al. (2) that focused on 26 catastrophic 
head injuries found that 5/26 (21.7%) players died from severe 
cerebral bleeding immediately after a head injury and 8/26 
(30.8%) required one or more surgical procedures. Recovery 
analysis revealed that 11/26 (42.3%) of athletes suffered from 
ongoing neurological deficiencies/symptoms, and only 4/26 
(15.4%) returned to competitive play (2). Further, Lawson 
et al. (25) noted that 5.8% of all baseball injuries that were 
brought to the ED were diagnosed with concussion/closed 
head injury, and 17.7% of the injuries that required hospital 
admission after ED visit were due to concussions/closed head 
injuries.
Returning to Play
Two concussion RTP guidelines were assessed for compliance 
rates among concussed high school baseball players; The 
1997 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) (39) and the 
2005 Prague (40) RTP guidelines (Table 6). This analysis 
revealed a 100% compliance rate with the AAN guidelines for 
athletes diagnosed with Grade I concussions, however, these 
rates dropped for both Grades II and III (36). Indeed, 56% 
of males and 32% of females with diagnosed with a Grade II 
concussion were non-compliant with the AAN RTP guide-
lines (36). Under the Prague RTP guidelines however, overall 
non-compliance rates dropped to 12% for both boys baseball 
and girls softball (36).
DiScUSSiON
This systematic review of research studies examining the 
relationship between baseball and softball and TBIs identified 
only twenty-nine articles on the topic. In part, this is because 
there were no baseball and softball injury data available until 
the formation of the National Center for Catastrophic Sports 
Injury Research (NCCSIR) in 1982 (29). The identified studies 
in our review found variance in the reported proportion of 
TBIs per injury case. This is not surprising when consider-
ing that there was no consistent definition of TBI among the 
included studies. To date, the vast majority of the current 
literature studied baseball- and softball-related TBIs among 
other baseball and softball injuries (i.e., musculoskeletal 
injuries) and/or other sports (i.e., baseball/softball included 
with the study of other sports such as hockey, football, soccer 
etc.), with only one article investigating solely TBIs in baseball 
players (20).
Several trends were observed. First, while being struck by a 
bat was the most common mechanism of injury for younger 
players (17), being struck by a ball was the most common 
mechanism for older athletes (adolescent and beyond) (2, 13, 
14, 17–20). Second, batters and catchers were at the highest risk 
of TBIs among all positions of play (18–20), with the majority 
of TBIs occurring at the home plate (19, 20). These positions 
also experience the highest overall injury rate in baseball, thus 
the proportion of TBIs to total injuries does not differ dramati-
cally across the different positions (3). Third, the current review 
suggests the rate of TBI in baseball and softball to be 0.03–0.46 
per 1,000 AE, with variations attributed to gender, setting, 
and levels of play (20, 33). Baseball and softball were found 
to have the lowest incidence of concussion (22, 23, 26), when 
reported alongside fifteen other sports. For example, the rate 
of TBI has been reported to be 0.75 per 1,000 AE in American 
football and 0.74 per 1,000 AE in ice hockey (23). Despite the 
seemingly low injury rate, concussions are among the top ten 
time-loss injuries in professional baseball (41), can be career

threatening for athletes (42) and have potentially catastrophic 
results, including immediate death (2). TBIs accounted for 
63.4% (26/41) of all catastrophic baseball injuries reported 
to the NCCSIR between 1982 and 2002 (2). It is important to 
note, however, that more recent studies did not report fatalities 
as a common outcome of baseball- and softball-related TBI 
 
(34, 35). This may be a result of increased awareness and edu-
cation surrounding sports-related TBI, improved equipment, 
and rule enhancement and/or rule changes to enhance the 
safety of the athletes. While fatalities seem to have decreased, 
the rate and incidence of TBI continues to increase in baseball 
and softball (16, 18, 19, 23). As such, the findings of this review 
support the need for comprehensive exploration and analysis 
 
of TBIs in baseball and softball.
Our review highlights the importance of TBIs in baseball 
 
and softball. It is imperative for both medical personal, individual 
athletes, and others involved in the game and its organization 
 
and implementation to exercise greater caution and develop bet-
ter awareness regarding the potential severity of TBIs, regardless 
of how minor the injury may first appear.
Collegiate athletes were more commonly injured than high 
school athletes, and the sustained TBIs were more prevalent 
during competition than practice (16, 19, 23, 27, 28, 31, 32, 38). 
This finding is consistent with the reports of eight other sports, 
including football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and wrestling 
(19). The disparity between competition and practice may be due 
to the increased likelihood of contact with other players or bases 
during games (28). This is supported by the finding that colli-
sions are among the most common mechanism of injury among 
players (2, 20, 31). In addition, a game setting fosters elevated 
competitiveness and aggression which has been found to put 
players at a higher risk of TBIs in other sports such as hockey 
 
(43, 44). It is reasonable to assume this finding translates to base-
ball and softball as well. An alternative explanation for the higher 
prevalence of TBIs found in games may be a result of the closer 
monitoring of athletes, resulting in more injuries being reported 
to health care professionals.
Physical differences related to athlete strength may contrib-
ute to why TBIs are more prominent among collegiate players 
compared to the high school population. Collegiate players 
may be colliding with greater forces or pitching at a greater 
velocity. However, there are conflicting views regarding the 
extent to which this may impact the proportion of concussion 
in total baseball and softball injuries between these two groups 
of players. One argument states that the greater intensity of 
collegiate level baseball and softball and the athlete’s enhanced 
speed and strength explains why a higher rate of concussion 
might be expected from collegiate athletes (15, 19). Conversely, 
the potential for more playing time, lower skill level, and lower 
quality of equipment of high school teams allows others to argue 
that higher proportions of concussion should be observed by 
high school players (45). The truth likely lies somewhere in 
between these opposing views and that the real difference in 
concussion proportions between high school and collegiate 
athletes are small.
This review found that while overall, based on reported cases, 
more males sustained TBIs than females, but females have a 
higher injury rate (16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 31, 32, 38). This 
is an interesting finding as female players are typically associ-
ated with softball where the balls are larger, but are less dense 
and have a softer core. Experimental studies suggest that softer 
balls reduce the impact response of head and chest models and 
should therefore be safer (46). Higher rates of concussion for 
females were also reported in other sports such as soccer and 
basketball (26), suggesting that cofounding factors may have 
contributed to the higher TBI prevalence observed in women’s 
softball. Females may be more likely to report an injury than 
males. Only 47% of high school football players suffering from 
concussion symptoms chose to report their injury (47), because 
they did not think their injuries were severe enough to warrant 
medical attention and/or feared that they would be removed 
from the game. In addition, North American societies have 
traditionally been more protective of female athletes, which 
may cause coaches, parents, and athletic trainers to treat TBIs 
in females more seriously than in males (19, 48). Alternatively, 
it has been suggested that there may be neuropsychological 
 
differences in the susceptibility to TBI and concussion symp-
toms among sexes (38, 49).
The findings of our review illustrate an increase in the rate 
of baseball- and softball-related TBIs over the past decade 
 
(12, 26, 28). This is consistent with overall increase in concus-
sion rates observed across all sports (including football, hockey, 
basketball, etc.) (22, 26). The increase in concussion rates may 
reflect a true increase in the risk of sports-related TBIs, but 
it may also be attributed, at least in part, to improvements in 
the identification, monitoring, and reporting of TBIs (22, 26). 
While emergency room visits for concussions are increasing, 
participation in organized team sports is decreasing (12), 
thus demonstrating the need of for effective injury prevention 
programs.

The findings of our review illustrate a need to prevent TBI in 
baseball and softball. Although prevention strategies may differ 
for different ages and levels of competition, these findings sup-
port the use of preventive measures to limit injury prevalence 
among these athletes. Further, despite the differences in softball 
and baseball, the mechanisms of injury are similar and therefore 
have similar avenues of injury prevention. A simple Haddon’s 
Matrix (1968) (50) was constructed to organize preventative 
measures (Table 7).

Developed by William Haddon Jr., the Haddon matrix is com-
monly used injury prevention research and intervention (50, 51).

The grid has four columns representing different influencing fac-
tors (host, agent, physical environment, social environment) that 
contribute to the injury process. The grid also consists of three 
rows, each representing different phases of an injury (pre-injury, 
injury event, post-injury). The matrix combines public health 
concepts of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention with 
the concepts of host-agent-environment as target of change for 
delivering public heath interventions (51). Each cell of the matrix 
represents a distinct locus for identifying intervention strategies 
for addressing a public health concern (51).
Applying the Haddon matrix to the threat of TBI in base 
ball 
and softball facilitates public health agencies and stakehold-
ers to conceptualize, predict, prevent, and mitigate injury 
(Table 7). The host column represents the person or persons at 
risk of injury. These factors include the age, sex, and strength 
of athletes, as well as an athlete’s knowledge of TBI and compli-
ance to return-to-play guidelines. The agents of injury include 
the ball, the bat, and a second player (via collision). Physical 
environment refers to the setting of where the injury occurs. 
These factors include the condition of the field, time of year, 
use of personal equipment, as well as access to appropriate 
medical care. Sociocultural and legal norms of a community 
constitute the social environment. Such factors include the 
public perception of helmet use, regulation and enforcement of 
protective gear use, and community response to TBI. Economic 
factors include the cost of protective gear, cost of medical care 
as well as insurance rates. Haddon’s matrix provides a frame-
work for understanding of the origins of injury and for iden-
tifying multiple countermeasures to address TBI in baseball 
 
and softball.
interventions for injury Prevention
In terms of specific interventions, we propose the following:
 
(A) Educate athletes, parents, and coaches about TBI; its symp-
toms and importance in preventing and reporting injuries. 
TBI in baseball and softball can have serious consequences 
including immediate death and permanent neurological 
effects (2). Thus, it is important for all participants to 
recognize the risks and potential threats of TBIs, and the 
necessity of reporting an injury regardless of how minor the 
injury appears to be upon first impressions. TBI education 
is a potential solution to reduce the reluctance of athletes 
to report injuries. Concussion educated soccer players, for 
example, are more likely to report a suspected concussion 
than uneducated players, thus reducing their risk for fur-
ther injury (52). Education can also be formulated around 
taking safety precautions to prevent TBIs. For instance, 
young players are especially prone to being hit by a bat due 
to standing too close to the batter; a practice that can easily 
be prevented with education around creating safe distances 
from the batter (17). Education needs to be directed broadly 
to players, coaches, trainers, parents, officials, and those 
responsible for the organization of baseball and softball like 
school officials and league directors.
 
(B) Enforcement of rules, laws, and the use of helmets. The 
Zackery Lysted Law (ZLL) (2009), named after a young 
athlete who is permanently disabled after sustaining a 
concussion due to prematurely returning to a play football, 
requires “school districts and non-profit organizations using 
school facilities to adopt policies for the management of 
concussion and head injury in youth sports” (53). Our study 
found that up to 55.6% of concussed baseball and softball 
athletes were non-compliant with RTP guidelines (36). This 
player non-compliance likely reflects a broader culture of 
non-compliance within the sports organizations and people 
such as team officials, coaches and trainers, parents, peers, 
and sponsors that create a permissive environment that does 
not discourse this sort of behavior amongst players. Since 
the numbers are reported from schools with a NATA affili-
ated certified athletic trainer (36), we suspect non-compliant 
rates to be even higher in schools without the guidance of 
a certified trainer. This is of major concern as pre-mature 
 
RTP has been shown to increase the risk of re-injury (54), 
result in more severe post-concussive symptoms (55) and 
decrease an athlete’s reaction time (56).
The most recent guidelines on concussion and sport 
devel 
oped in 2013 (57) require a thorough evaluation of 
their effectiveness. However, they are likely to be more 
com 
prehensive and have the potential to be more effective 
at reducing the burden of TBI and minimizing attrition from 
sport than earlier guidelines.
The effectiveness of helmets as a means of protection 
against TBI has raised some controversy. For instance, a 
2000 systematic review examining the effectiveness of 
helmets in preventing head and brain injuries in cyclists 
found that helmets reduce the risk of TBI by up to 88% 
(58). A more recent review, however, concludes that helmet 
use does not result in better clinical outcome or protec-
tion against concussion (59). Controversy surrounding 
helmet use against concussion may be a result of the lack 
of a standardized definition of concussion and/or a lack 
of standardization in examining helmet efficacy (59). 
Nevertheless, there is significant literature supporting the 
effectiveness of helmets in protecting against moderate to 
severe TBI resulting in disability or death (2, 59). In par-
ticular, helmets provide clear protection against open skull 
fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, and penetrating head 
injuries (2, 59–61). As such, we believe that it is important 
to enforced and encourage the use of helmets among all 
baseball and softball players.
 
(C) Engineering of new helmet, bat, and ball designs to minimize 
the force of an impact. The protective efficacy of helmets 
may vary by type and design (5, 59). As such, clinicians, 
scientists, and engineers must work together to create 
helmets that are effective in protecting athletes against 
TBI. The average pitch velocity of 86.2 mph among MLB 
players is considerably higher than the current standard 
test speed of 70 mph for faceguards (4, 5). In addition, the 
dominance of aluminum bats over wooden bats in modern 
day baseball and softball allows players to swing faster due 
to their lightweight. With the major culprit of TBIs in base-
ball and softball being the ball itself, advances in ball design 
that increase the speed of balls should be taken cautiously

to minimize injury risks. Recommendations for potential 
face guards on batting helmets should also be considered in 
reducing injury risk (62).
 
(D) Economic incentives and disincentives; fines, insurance 
rates, price of equipment, and medical care. Socioeconomic 
status, availability of financial resources and level of insur-
ance coverage available has shown to influence outcomes 
after TBI (63). Although not explored in the literature we 
reviewed, financial factors and economic limitations play 
a role in preventive efforts (63). For instance, the cost 
of medical care may be limiting factor to the number of 
athletes seeking professional help after an injury. The price 
of helmets and other protective gear may also contribute to 
the poor rates of helmet use, particularly in school districts 
with lower average income. Given that for every dollar that 
is spent on bicycle helmets, over $30 is saved in medical 
costs (64), this would be a good investment for all leagues 
and schools. Providing incentives and disincentives in the 
form of insurance policies for those complying with safety 
initiatives and lower rates of TBI can also potentially have 
beneficial effects.
 
(E) Surveillance and evaluation. Timely and accurate injury 
surveillance systems play a major factor in our understand-
ing of TBI rates and outcomes. They are also critical in 
studying the effectiveness of preventive strategies such as the 
ZLL. While recent examination of ZLL shows promise in 
reducing some sports-related TBIs (such as cycling) among 
youth, future empirical research is required to determine 
whether such legislations are effective in preventing TBIs 
in other sports (65). Efficient surveillance systems require 
investments by organized groups in sports to develop and to 
maintain. A willingness to act on the data that arises from 
such systems is also crucial in creating effective methods of 
injury prevention.
LimitatiONS
Study Limitations
There were several limitations to this systematic review. Dif-
ferences in the definition of TBI across the twenty-nine studies 
made the comparison between results challenging. Variability 
in the reporting of TBI adds further challenges, as the methods 
used to diagnose TBI across the studies remain unclear. In addi-
tion, although the included studies were subjected to quality 
assessment, we could not resolve any intrinsic problems with the 
design of the primary studies. While the majority of the stud-
ies attempted to use samples collected from a well-established 
database (i.e., NEISS, CHIRPP, RIO), all data collection methods 
have limits. For example, the database RIO is based on self-
reporting surveys, is highly subjective and prone to errors in 
injury diagnosis. Furthermore, most of the studies were limited 
to samples obtained from hospital emergency rooms or schools 
with a NATA affiliated certified athletic trainer, thus potentially 
underestimating the total number of injuries, especially mild 
ones. In spite of these limitations, this review provides the first 
systematic analysis of the epidemiology of TBI in baseball and 
softball, important avenues for prevention, and outlines current 
gaps in the literature.
Gaps in current Knowledge  
and Future Research
We identified several gaps in the current literature. First, no 
data were available for TBIs associated with T-ball. Second, 
only twelve studies reported the post injury outcomes and 
among those, the differences in the selected participants 
 
(i.e., ED visits, fatal head injuries) produced huge variations 
among presented results. As such, the current literature 
provides little information on the severity and outcomes of 
baseball- and softball-related TBIs. Third, although twenty-
nine studies were included, only thirteen explored details of 
injury (i.e., mechanism). Thus, it is important to note that 
very few studies focused specifically on baseball- and softball-
related TBIs, and there is currently little available information 
on the specific nature of TBIs acquired during baseball play. 
For example, the risk of TBI among informal play (i.e., on the 
playground, at home) remains largely unknown. Furthermore, 
of the studies that reported mechanisms of injury (n = 13), all 
reported on the biomechanical loading mechanism (i.e., hit by 
ball, hit by bat, player collision, sliding). No studies reported 
on the biochemical secondary injury mechanism (patho-
physiological damage leading to concussion, contusion, or 
hemorrhage). Given that fourteen of fifteen studies in softball 
reported on outcomes in females alone, there is considerable 
room for more research on males in softball. Geographic loca-
tion also remains a major limitation as twenty-seven of the 
twenty-nine included studies were based on populations in 
the United States. Future work should determine if systematic 
differences in how the game is played in different regions like 
the Caribbean countries or Japan have any effect on rates and 
causes of TBI. Similarly, the relationship between of social and 
economic factors and the rates of TBIs are largely unexplored. 
Moreover, more research should be directed to younger ages, 
t-ball related TBIs, and informal play. Finally, the results of our 
STROBE analysis demonstrate a need for authors to describe 
efforts taken to address potential sources of bias when report-
ing TBI in baseball and softball. Such information is not 
only necessary to direct future research but also important 
for the general public to take adequate measures of injury 
 
prevention.
cONcLUSiON
This systematic review found twenty-nine articles that detailed 
TBIs in baseball and softball covering participants of all ages. 
The most common mechanisms were struck by implement 
and collision with another player or object. The most explored 
outcome was concussion. Resistance to helmet use and non-
compliance with RTP guidelines remains a lingering concern, 
particularly among high school and collegiate athletes. There 
is a need for preventive measures to focus on education for all 
ages and for all players, parents, coaches, and league officials. 
All stakeholders should be aware of the ZLL and advances in

only provide a greater understanding to baseball- and softball-
related TBIs but also aid in the development of prevention and
