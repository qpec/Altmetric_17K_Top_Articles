Abstract
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, which results in vari-
ous organ pathologies. However, current treatment towards SLE is suboptimal.
Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to promote SLE recovery, but clinical applica-
tion can be limited by its haematopoiesis-stimulating effects. EPO-derived helix-B
peptide (ARA290) is non-erythrogenic but has been reported to retain the anti-
inflammatory and tissue-protective functions of EPO. Therefore, here we investi-
gated the effects and potential mechanisms of ARA290 on SLE. The administration
of ARA290 to pristane-induced SLE and MRL/lpr mice significantly suppressed the
level of serum antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies,
reduced the deposition of IgG and C3, and ameliorated the nephritis symptoms.
Moreover, the serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokine IL-6, MCP-1 and
TNF-a in SLE mice were reduced by ARA290. Further, ARA290 decreased the num-
ber of apoptotic cells in kidney. In vitro experiment revealed that ARA290 inhibited
the inflammatory activation of macrophages and promoted the phagocytotic func-
tion of macrophages to apoptotic cells. Finally, ARA290 did not induce haematopoi-
esis during treatment. In conclusion, ARA290 ameliorated SLE, which at least could
be partly due to its anti-inflammatory and apoptotic cell clearance promoting
effects, without stimulating haematopoiesis, suggesting that ARA290 could be a
hopeful candidate for SLE treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a persistent growing global
disease, whose incidence has almost increased 25% between 2003
and 2008 in the developed country.1 As a chronic multisystem
autoimmune disease, SLE can potentially lead to serious organ com-
plications, such as massive lymphadenopathy splenomegaly, among
which lupus nephritis is the most important cause of death.2 How-
ever, recent progress in the treatment of SLE has been rare, the only
new therapy approved for SLE during the last 50 years is beli-
mumab, suggesting that effort should be more focused on exploring
new therapies.3
SLE is a multifarious and chronic inflammatory autoimmune dis-
order with a wide range of clinical symptoms.4,5 In patients with
SLE, the immune system is subverted to against self-antigens and
the consequent persistent inflammatory response elicits a vicious
cycle of immune-cell activation and tissue damage.6 The deregulated
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6,

 play a key role in immune dysfunction, mediating tissue inflammation
and organ damage in SLE.7 TNF-a levels were found to increase in
patients with SLE and were associated with the disease activity of
SLE. The blocking of TNF-a function in patients with SLE decreased
the disease severity.8,9 In addition, in humans and mice with lupus
nephritis, IL-6 promoted autoantibody production and was correlated
with the SLE activity.10,11 Therefore, the restrain of the inflammatory
response could facilitate the improvement of SLE.
While much of the pathophysiology and therapy of SLE has
focused on autoimmune B and T cells of the adaptive immune sys-
tem, recently, phenotypic and functional abnormalities in macro-
phages are increasingly recognized to play a role in this complex
disease. Accumulated evidences suggested a more active role of
macrophages in mediating tissue inflammation and injury in SLE,
including
high
inflammatory
cytokine
production
and
defective
phagocytic capacity. In lupus, macrophages are recognized as a major
source of the inflammatory cytokines, which may promote the acti-
vation of autoreactive T and B cells. Moreover, macrophages in
lupus display a defective phagocytic function, enabling the aberrant
accumulation of apoptotic debris, which in turn can lead to a sequel
of autoimmune events. In healthy individuals, macrophages remove
dead and dying cells in an immune-silent way. The rapid elimination
of apoptotic cells by phagocytes can prevent cell membrane rupture
and the leakage of cell contents, to avoid the so-called secondary
necrosis of apoptotic cells.12,13 Following the phagocytosis of apop-
totic cells, macrophages can produce and release anti-inflammatory
cytokines, such as TGF-b,14 which play an immune regulatory role,
and avoid the activation of the immune response to autoantigens
and autoimmunity. However, in SLE, the ability of apoptotic cell
clearance is deficient, leading to the accumulation of the apoptotic
cells, resulting to the secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells and the
subsequent activation of self-immune response.15 Therefore, the reg-
ulation of macrophage function plays an important role in maintain-
ing
homeostasis
and inhibiting
the
occurrence of
autoimmune
diseases.
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a larvaceous cytoprotective glycoprotein
that was initially identified as an essential growth factor of haemo-
poiesis through the homodimer EPO receptor (EPOR2) and widely
applied to treat the anaemia.16 However, EPORs were found to be
expressed in macrophages,17-19 and EPO signalling inhibited inflam-
matory gene expression in macrophages.20,21 Moreover, recently, we
found that EPO promoted macrophage phagocytosis of dying cells
and the progression of SLE was ameliorated by exogenous EPO treat-
ment.22 In addition, accumulated studies had also shown that EPO
can be cytoprotective following tissue injury, indicating that EPO
treatment has pronounced anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic capac-
ities.23,24 Therefore, EPO might be a candidate drug for SLE therapy,
but the long-term use of EPO has been shown to raise the risk of
adverse side effects, such as thromboembolism and hypertension.25
Fortunately, recent studies have shown that EPO exerted its
anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective functions via the EPOR-CD131
complex. In contrast, the haematopoietic function of EPO is consid-
ered
to
act
through
the
high-affinity
homodimer
of
EPOR
subunit.26,27 Moreover, EPO derivatives, which only activate the
protective EPOR-CD131 complex but not the erythropoiesis EPOR
homodimer, have been developed.28,29 More recently, an EPO-
derived helix-B peptide, ARA290, which had been reported to retain
the cytoprotective properties but lack the erythropoietic activity was
reported. Compared to other EPO analogs, ARA290 is a small syn-
thetic peptide. Although ARA290 possesses a pretty short plasma
half-life, it can still exert biological functions in vivo.30-32 Patel
et al33 showed that ARA290 raises the phosphorylation of survival
pathway Art and inhibits the activation of pro-inflammatory glycogen
synthase kinase-3 and NF-jB. Furthermore, ARA290 had been
reported to show protective effect for several clinical diseases, such
as type II diabetes, small fibre neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and
renal ischaemia-reperfusion.34-36 However, the effect and potential
mechanisms of ARA290 on SLE remain unknown so this study here
sought to investigate the effects of ARA290 in SLE model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1
|
Mice and SLE induction
MRL/lpr mice were a kind gift from Dr. Yang, Institute of Immunol-
ogy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China, and C57BL/6 mice
were purchased from The Vital River (Beijing, China). Husbandry
environmental conditions consisted of 12-hours light, 12-hours dark-
ness, and ambient temperature of 20°C and relative humidity of
30%-60% at the Third Military Medical University (Chongqing,
China). The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the Third Military Medical University and were per-
formed according to the international and Chinese guidelines of ani-
mal research.
For pristane-induced SLE model, female C57BL/6 mice, at 10-
12 weeks of age, were given a single intraperitoneal injection of
0.5 mL of pristane (Sigma-Aldrich) to induce SLE-like autoimmunity.
At the end of the indicated experimental period, animals were killed
and specimens including blood, spleen, thymus and kidney were
collected.

ARA290 intervention
For therapy, MRL/lpr mice and C57BL/6 mice received intraperi-
toneal injection of ARA290 (peptide biochemical GmbH, Hangzhou,
China; endotoxin-free with N90% purity; 500 lg/kg/d) once daily
for 3 months (6 mice/group). And the same volume of PBS was
given to the control group (6 mice/group). The dosage of ARA290
was chosen according to our previous study.34,37

Histological assessment
For the assessment of renal histopathology, the mice were killed
after the indicated experimental period. Mice were deeply anaes-
thetized with
pentobarbital
sodium (50 mg/kg; Boster, Wuhan,
China) and were perfused with 4°C PBS and then with 4% 4°C
paraformaldehyde. Kidneys were post-fixed in 4% 4°C paraformalde-
hyde overnight and then cut into 2 equally long segments, embed-
ded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were sectioned (7 lm), and slides
were stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
For immunohistochemistry staining, the paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks were cut into 7 lm sections. After dewaxing, sections were
boiled (in a 600-W microwave oven) for 15 minutes in citrate buffer
(2.1 g sodium citrate/L, pH 6). The sections were cooled to room
temperature, and endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with 1%
hydrogen peroxidase (H2O2) in methanol for 15 minutes. To block
non-specific binding of immunoglobulins, sections were incubated
with 3% albumin bovine V. Thereafter, the sections were incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The following antibodies
were
used:
F4/80
(BM8,
ab16911;
Abcam,
Inc.),
C3
(11H9,
ab11862; Abcam, Inc.) and goat antimouse IgG antibody (ab97033;
Abcam, Inc.). After washing, the sections were incubated with corre-
sponding secondary antibodies for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the
Vecta-stain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) was
used for the avidin-biotin complex method according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Peroxidase activity was visualized with a DAB
Elite Kit (K3465, DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark). The sections were
lightly counterstained with haematoxylin and dehydrated through an
ethanol series to xylene and mounted.
TUNEL staining (Derma TACS, Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD,
USA) was performed to identify apoptotic cells in sections from the
kidneys according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

ELISA and biochemical parameters
Mouse anti-dsDNA Abs Kit (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX) and
antinuclear Abs ELISA Kits (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX) were
used to detect the serologic titres of anti-dsDNA, and antinuclear
Abs, respectively. Murine serum was prepared at a 1:100 dilution in
PBS, and 100 lL of the diluted serum was added to the 96-well
ELISA plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absor-
bance at 450 nm was measured with a Paradigm Multi-Mode
Plate Reader (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
The level of haemoglobin and the concentration of red blood
cells in mice peripheral blood were measured in Southwest hospital
(Chongqing, China).
For the assessment of urine, mice were individually kept in steril-
ized metabolic cages and urine samples were pooled over 24 hours.
The total urinary albumin was determined with an Albumin Assay Kit
(Jiancheng, Nanjing). The total protein in uria was determined by
Bradford method with BCA Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology,
Shanghai, China). The concentrations of creatinine and urea in the
urine and serum samples were measured with the Creatinine Assay
Kit and Urea Assay Kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was applied with a Mouse Inflammation CBA Kit
(BD
Pharmingen),
including
IL-6,
IL-10,
MCP-1,
IFN-c,
TNF-a,
IL-12p70 in serum according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow data were collected with Cell Quest Software and analysed
with FlowJo software for Windows (Treestar, Inc.)
For
immunostaining
and
flow
cytometry
of
bone
marrow
haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and haematopoietic progenitor
cells (HPCs), bone marrow cells were flushed from femurs and
stained with lineage antibodies, including CD5, CD8a, B220, CD11b,
GR-1 and Ly76, and stem cell markers, ckit, Scan1, CD34, FLT3 and
FcgR. Phenotypic populations were defined as long-term HSCs (LT-
HSCs) (Lin�/ckit+/Sca1+/Flt3�/CD34�), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs)
(Lin�/ckit+/Sca1+/Flt3�/CD34+),
multipotent
progenitors
(MPPs)
(Lin�/ckit+/Sca1+/Flt3+/CD34�),

ocyte-erythroid
progenitors
(MEPs)
(Lin�/ckit+/Sca1+/CD34�/
FccRlo). Dead cells were excluded by PI selection. Antibodies were
purchased from BioLegend. Negative controls were set by cells with-
out any antibody staining. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD
FACSCanto II, and the data were analysed with FlowJo software
(TreeStar).

Macrophage RAW 264.7 culture and
intervention
The immortalized murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was
grown in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing penicillin (100 U/mL), strepto-
mycin (100 U/mL) and 10% foetal calf serum at 37°C and 5% CO2.
To confirm effects of ARA290 on inflammatory response, 106 RAW
264.7 cells were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates in triplicates
and cultured overnight. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS,
and then, ARA290 was added to culture with or without 1 mg/mL
LPS overnight. Further, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine
were measured by semi-quantify PCR. The primers are as follows:
TNF-a (sense, TGA TCG GTC CCA ACA AGG A; antisense, TGC
TTG GTG GTT TGC TAC GA), iNOS (sense, TCT GTG CCT TTG CTC
ATG ACA; antisense, TGC TTC GAA CAT CGA ACG TC) and b-actin
(sense, CCG TCT TCC CCT CCA TCG T; antisense, ATC GTC CCA
GTT GGT TAC AAT GC).

Generation of apoptotic cells and the in vitro
phagocytosis assays
To generate apoptotic Jurkat cells, cells were cultured in RPMI with-
out FCS, and apoptosis was induced with 0.5 lg/mL staurosporine
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 hour. Afterwards, cells were washed 3 times
3332 |

 with PBS and resuspended in 10% FCS in RPMI. Staurosporine treat-
ment yielded a population with 90% apoptotic cells.
Before being fed to macrophages, apoptotic cells were labelled
with pHrodo
TM Green (pHrodo, Molecular Probes), a pH-sensitive
phagocytosis-dependent indicator that requires no wash steps or
quenchers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Macro-
phages were incubated with pHrodo-labelled apoptotic cells at a
ratio of 1:5 (macrophages: apoptosis cells) and cultured at 37°C for
60 minutes in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Meantime, macro-
phages were pretreated with ARA290 before co-incubation with
pHrodo-labelled apoptotic cells. After incubation, cells were resus-
pended and stained with fluorescence-labelled anti-F4/80 (BM8;
Sungene Biotech) and anti-CD11b (M1/70; Sungene Biotech). Then,
they were analysed by flow cytometry and the proportion of macro-
phages containing ingested apoptotic cells was determined.

RESULTS
3.1

ARA290 treatment Ameliorates Lupuslike
symptoms in pristane-induced SLE mice
We first investigated whether ARA290 altered the development of
lupuslike autoimmune disease with the pristane-induced murine
lupus model, which is characterized by the production of autoanti-
bodies and development of glomerulonephritis, resembling the key
features of human SLE. Moreover, pristane also leads to persistent
apoptosis of immature monocytes in ectopic lymphoid tissue that
forms in response to the hydrocarbon. Eight weeks following pris-
tane injection, ARA290 was given to this SLE mice once daily for
12 weeks (Figure 1A).
One of the most reliable criteria for SLE is an increase in antinu-
clear antigen autoantibodies in the serum.38 A significant decrease in
the serum concentrations of anti-dsDNA antibodies (ADA) and antin-
uclear antibodies (ANA) was observed in ARA290-treated SLE mice
compared to the control mice (Figure 1B). Another hallmark of SLE
is the deposition of autoantibodies as immune complexes in the kid-
ney, leading to inflammation and destruction of the glomeruli. Fol-
lowing ARA290 treatment, the deposition of IgG and complement
C3 in glomerulus was significantly reduced than in control mice (Fig-
ure 1C, D). Furthermore, reduced glomerular size and cellularity were
observed in kidney sections from ARA290-treated mice than from
their vehicle counterparts (Figure 1E). In line with the pathological
changes in the kidney, the levels of creatinine and blood urea nitro-
gen in serum were greatly decreased following ARA290 treatment
compared to the control (Figure 1F). Accordingly, reduced levels of
diuresis and urine albumin and increased levels of urine creatinine
were found in the ARA290-treated mice compared to that of the
vehicle control group (Figure 1G). In addition, the bodyweight of the
ARA290-treated SLE mice was greatly higher than that of the con-
trol SLE mice, indicating a better outcome. Collectively, these data
show that ARA290 treatment produces improvements in lupuslike
symptoms in pristane-induced SLE mice.

ARA290 treatment suppressed inflammatory
response in pristane-induced SLE mice
Inflammation plays a vital role in SLE development. In SLE, IL-6,
MCP-1, IFN-c and TNF-a promotes the progression of this dis-
ease.39-42 On the contrary, IL-10 and TGF-b are anti-inflammatory
cytokines, which are related to SLE recovery.14,43 As shown in Fig-
ure 2A, ARA290 treatment significantly decreased the serum levels
of IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF-a, and increased the serum levels of TGF-b,
suggesting an inflammation suppressing role of ARA290 in SLE.
Moreover,
macrophages
are
reported
to
contribute
to
the
pathogenesis of SLE and further studies have demonstrated that
macrophage infiltration to kidney is associated with poor outcome
of SLE. Then, we further investigated the macrophage accumula-
tion in SLE mouse kidney following ARA290 treatment. As shown
in Figure 2B, the infiltration of F4/80+ macrophages into the kid-
ney was much less evident in ARA290 group compared to control
group.
In addition, the enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes is
related with active inflammatory response and regarded as clinical
markers in lupus patients. In current investigation, we found the
weight of the spleen and lymph nodes of SLE mice was significant
reduced following ARA290 treatment compared to that of the con-
trol mice (Figure 2C).
Together,
these
data
demonstrate
that
ARA290
treatment
reduced the inflammatory response in pristane-induced SLE mice.

ARA290 Inhibited Inflammatory Macrophage
Activation but Promoted its Phagocytic Activity
Accumulated evidences suggested a more active role of macro-
phages in mediating tissue inflammation and injury in SLE, including
high inflammatory cytokine production and defective phagocytic
capacity.44,45
Then,
we
next
investigated
ARA290
effects
on
macrophage.
We first studied the ARA290 effects on inflammatory macro-
phage activation, and LPS was applied to stimulate macrophages. As
shown in Figure 3A, B, increased expression of TNF-a and iNOS
was detected following LPS stimulation, indicating an inflammatory
macrophage activation. And ARA290 dose-dependently suppressed
LPS-induced expression of TNF-a and iNOS (Figure 3A, B).
The defective apoptotic cell clearance has been linked to autoim-
mune disease, such as SLE, and the accumulation of apoptotic cells
and decreased phagocytotic ability of macrophages in SLE have been

 reported.46-48 Therefore, we further detected the impact of ARA290
on apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages in vitro by flow cytome-
try. As shown in Figure 3C, ARA290 dose-dependently promoted
macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. In line with this in vitro
observation, we also found that the accumulation of apoptotic cells
in kidney of pristane-induced SLE mice was greatly decreased by
ARA290 (Figure 3D).
Collectively, these data show that ARA290 suppressed macro-
phage inflammatory activation and promoted macrophage phagocy-
tosis of apoptotic cells.

ARA290 did not Stimulate Haematopoiesis
during SLE treatment
In addition, we detected whether ARA290 stimulates haematopoiesis
during SLE intervention. For pristane-induced SLE mice treatment,
ARA290 was given once daily for 12 weeks. Compared to the vehi-
cle control group, ARA290 administration did not increase the num-
bers of peripheral blood cell, the percentage of haemoglobin levels
and haematocrit (Figure 4A-D), implying that ARA290 did not stimu-
late haematopoiesis during SLE treatment.
To further investigate the effects of ARA290 on bone marrow
HSCs
and
HPCs,
C57BL/6
mice
were
treated
with
ARA290
(500 lg/kg/d, n = 4) or PBS (n = 4) for 28 days, and then, mice
were killed to take the bone marrow for the measurement of HSCs
and HPCs. Using flow cytometry and immunostaining of HSCs and
HPCs, we found that the absolute numbers of long-term (LT) HSCs,
short-term (ST) HSCs, and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs),
common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte-monocyte pro-
genitors (GMPs) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs)
were
comparable
between
the
treated
and
control
groups
(Figure 4E, F), indicating that the application of ARA290 has no sig-
nificant effects on the numbers of bone marrow haematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells.

ARA290 treatment Ameliorates Lupuslike
symptoms in MRL/lpr SLE mice
To verify the effect of ARA290 on SLE, we further analysed the effect
of ARA290 in the MRL/lpr SLE mice. Being a classic SLE animal model,
female MRL/lpr mice will spontaneously develop autoimmune syn-
dromes characterized by lupus nephritis, haematological changes, mas-
sive lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and autoantibody formation,
among which lupus nephritis is the key factor that leads to death.49
ARA290 was given to 8-week female MRL/lpr mice once daily for
12 weeks (Figure 5A). Like in pristane-induced SLE mice, ARA290
treatment greatly reduced the serum levels of ADA and ANA
(Figure 5B), decreased the glomerular size and cellularity in kidney (Fig-
ure 5C), improved the kidney functions (Figure 5D, E) and improved
the bodyweight (Figure 5F) in the MRL/lpr SLE mice. In addition,
ARA290 treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of IL-6,
MCP-1, TNF-a and IL-12p70, and increased the serum levels of TGF-b
and IL-10 in MRL/lpr SLE mice, suggesting an inflammation suppressing
role of ARA290 in SLE (Figure 5G). Furthermore, the enlargement of
spleen and lymph nodes was reduced by ARA290 as well (Figure 5H).
Collectively, these data show that ARA290 treatment produces
improvements in lupuslike symptoms and suppressed inflammation
in the MRL/lpr SLE mice.

DISCUSSION
Here, we have explored the effects of ARA290 on SLE mice. We
found that the administration of ARA290 to pristane-induced SLE
mice and MRL/lpr mice significantly suppressed the level of serum
ANAs and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, reduced the kidney deposi-
tion of IgG and C3, and ameliorated the nephritis symptoms. More-
over,
the
serum
concentrations
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokine,
such
as
IL-6,
MCP-1
and
TNF-a,
were
reduced,
but
the
anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-b was induced by ARA290 in SLE
mice. In addition, ARA290 decreased the number of apoptotic cells
in kidney of SLE mice. In vitro experiment revealed that ARA290
inhibited the inflammatory activation of macrophages and promoted
the
phagocytotic
function
of
macrophages
to
apoptotic
cells.
Finally, ARA290 did not induce haematopoiesis during treatment.
These data demonstrate that ARA290 ameliorated SLE, which at
least could be partly due to its anti-inflammatory and apoptotic cell
clearance promoting effects, without stimulating haematopoiesis,

 suggesting that ARA290 could be a hopeful candidate for SLE
treatment.
The increased evidence suggested a close link between pro-inflam-
matory cytokines and SLE. Specifically, up-regulated pro-inflammatory
cytokines caused an immune dysregulation and tissue damage.50,51 Fox
example, studies have revealed that elevated serum levels of TNF-a are
positively associated with disease activity as well as renal involvement
in patients with SLE.10,52 Moreover, IL-6 can be hoisted in the urine of
lupus nephritis patients, with higher levels correlating with active renal
inflammation and pathology.53,54 In addition, monocyte chemoattrac-
tant protein (MCP-1) is implicated in the activation of inflammatory
cells and has been suggested to affect the progression of lupus nephri-
tis (LN).55,56 Macrophages are the main origin of these inflammatory
cytokines in SLE. In the current study, our in vivo and in vitro studies
showed that ARA290 ameliorated inflammatory response in SLE mice
and, notably, suppressed the expression of TNF-a, IL-6, iNOS and
MCP-1 in macrophages, which suggested that ARA290 might alleviated
the
symptoms
of
SLE
via
regulating
macrophage
inflammatory
response; however, the definite mechanism between ARA290 and
macrophage inflammatory response needs further investigation.
Our study also provides forceful evidence that ARA290 signifi-
cantly promote the phagocytic ability of macrophages in vitro and
in vivo. SLE is associated with the deposition of apoptotic cells
in vivo.45 Defects in apoptotic cell clearance may result in secondary
necrosis and lead to autoimmunity.45,57 Research had reported that
macrophages are the main phagocytic cells. In 1980s, studies had
shown that the defect phagocytic function of macrophages would
lead to abnormal accumulation of apoptotic debris, considered to be
SLE macrophages in vivo abnormalities.58 Our previous study has
shown that EPO promotes macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic
cells.22 In line with this, here we found that the EPO-derived
ARA290 peptide also elevated the phagocytotic activity of macro-
phage to apoptotic cells in vitro. Furthermore, the apoptotic cell
accumulation in vivo was also reduced following ARA290 treatment
in SLE. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of ARA290 on SLE could
be partly due to its activity to promote apoptotic cell clearance.
In conclusion, our investigation here demonstrates that ARA290
ameliorated SLE, which at least could be partly due to its anti-inflam-
matory and apoptotic cell clearance promoting effects, without stim-
ulating haematopoiesis, suggesting that ARA290 could be a hopeful
candidate for SLE treatment.
