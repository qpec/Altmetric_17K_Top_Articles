IMPORTANCE Survivors of sepsis face long-term sequelae that diminish health-related quality
of life and result in increased care needs in the primary care setting, such as medication,
physiotherapy, or mental health care.
OBJECTIVE To examine if a primary care–based intervention improves mental health–related
quality of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted between February
2011 and December 2014, enrolling 291 patients 18 years or older who survived sepsis
(including septic shock), recruited from 9 intensive care units (ICUs) across Germany.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to usual care (n = 143) or to a 12-month
intervention (n = 148). Usual care was provided by their primary care physician (PCP) and
included periodic contacts, referrals to specialists, and prescription of medication, other
treatment, or both. The intervention additionally included PCP and patient training, case
management provided by trained nurses, and clinical decision support for PCPs by
consulting physicians.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in mental health–related
quality of life between ICU discharge and 6 months after ICU discharge using the Mental
Component Summary (MCS) of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36 [range, 0-100;
higher ratings indicate lower impairment; minimal clinically important difference,
5 score points]).
RESULTS The mean age of the 291 patients was 61.6 years (SD, 14.4); 66.2% (n = 192) were
men, and 84.4% (n = 244) required mechanical ventilation during their ICU stay (median
duration of ventilation, 12 days [range, 0-134]). At 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, 75.3%
(n = 219 [112 intervention, 107 control]) and 69.4% (n = 202 [107 intervention, 95 control]),
respectively, completed follow-up. Overall mortality was 13.7% at 6 months (40 deaths [21
intervention, 19 control]) and 18.2% at 12 months (53 deaths [27 intervention, 26 control]).
Among patients in the intervention group, 104 (70.3%) received the intervention at high levels
of integrity. There was no significant difference in change of mean MCS scores (intervention
group mean at baseline, 49.1; at 6 months, 52.9; change, 3.79 score points [95% CI, 1.05 to
6.54] vs control group mean at baseline, 49.3; at 6 months, 51.0; change, 1.64 score points
[95% CI, −1.22 to 4.51]; mean treatment effect, 2.15 [95% CI, −1.79 to 6.09]; P = .28).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among survivors of sepsis and septic shock, the use of a
primary care–focused team-based intervention, compared with usual care, did not improve
mental health–related quality of life 6 months after ICU discharge. Further research is needed
to determine if modified approaches to primary care management may be more effective.

S
epsis is a major health problem worldwide.1 It has been
estimated that sepsis occurred in 2% of hospitalized pa-
tients in the United States in 2008, and incidence is ex-
pected to increase further in the future, with an even higher
incidence in developing countries.2 The risk of dying from sep-
sis has decreased in recent decades, owing to earlier detec-
tion and more effective treatment.3 Although more patients
survive sepsis and are increasingly discharged from the
hospital,4 they often experience functional disability, cogni-
tive impairment, and psychiatric morbidity,5,6 resulting in di-
minished health-related quality of life,7 increased health care
costs,8,9 and burden on patients and their families.7,10
Many survivors of sepsis have multiple medical comor-
bidities that are typically managed in primary care. Yet inter-
ventions for managing sepsis sequelae in primary care have
not been developed.5,11 A systematic review of outpatient in-
terventions for patients surviving critical illnesses showed
heterogeneous and small effects on clinical outcomes such as
depression and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).12 Studies with post–intensive care unit (ICU) follow-
ups of 6 months or more are rare.7
The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to as-
sess whether a primary care–based intervention13 would im-
prove mental health–related quality of life among survivors of
sepsis compared with usual care.
Methods
Study Design and Population
A multicenter, unblinded, 2-group randomized clinical
trial was performed. The institutional review board of the
Jena University Hospital approved the study protocol (proto-
col available in Supplement 1). All patients and primary care
physicians (PCPs) in the study provided written informed
consent. Serious adverse events were reported to a data
and safety monitoring board. Patients were recruited in 9 ICU
study centers across Germany between February 2011 and
December 2013. Follow-up assessments were completed
in December 2014. Patients were eligible for inclusion if
they were adult (≥18 years) survivors of severe sepsis, (now
defined as “sepsis”14) or septic shock and fluent in the
German language.
Clinical diagnoses of sepsis were made by intensivists
according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes (R65.1/
R57.2) and American College of Chest Physicians/Society of
Critical Care Medicine consensus criteria.15 Baseline inter-
views of patients were conducted by the study team within 1
month of ICU discharge. The key exclusion criterion was cog-
nitive impairment, as determined by the Telephone Inter-
view of Cognitive Status (score ≤27).16 After determining
patient eligibility, the study team invited each patient’
s PCP
to participate in the trial.
RandomizationwasstratifiedbyICUstudycentersandper-
formed using computer-generated random permutated blocks
(block size range, 2-6) provided by an independent center for
clinical trials at the University of Leipzig.
Intervention
The intervention was based on the chronic care model.17 Its
core components included case management focusing on pro-
active patient symptom monitoring, clinical decision sup-
port for the PCP, and training for both patients and their PCPs
inevidence-basedcare.ThreenurseswithICUexperiencewere
trained as outpatient case managers for survivors of sepsis in
an8-hourworkshop.Thetrainingincludedinformationonsep-
sissequelae,communicationskills,telephonemonitoring,and
behavioral activation of patients that included goal setting
(SepsisCaseManagerManualinSupplement2).Eachcaseman-
ager worked with 38 to 65 patients, starting with a 60-minute
face-to-face training on sepsis sequelae (Sepsis Help Book in
Supplement 2) that took place a median of 8 days after ICU dis-
charge (interquartile range [IQR], 2-20). This was followed by
monthly telephone contact for 6 months, then once every 3
months for the final 6 months. Case managers monitored pa-
tients’symptomsusingvalidatedscreeningtools(SepsisMoni-
toring Checklist in Supplement 2) to assess critical illness poly-
neuropathy/myopathy,wasting,neurocognitivedeficits,PTSD,
depressive and pain symptoms, as well as patient self-
management behaviors focusing on physical activity and in-
dividual self-management goals. Each case manager re-
ported results to 1 of 3 assigned consulting physicians (medical
doctors with background in primary and critical care), who su-
pervisedthecasemanagersandprovidedclinicaldecisionsup-
port to the PCPs using a structured written report that in-
cludedtheSepsisMonitoringChecklist(Supplement2;eFigure
3inSupplement3).Thereportswerestratifiedbyurgencyusing
a traffic-light scheme: red signified “immediate intervention
recommended”; yellow, “intervention should be consid-
ered”; and green, “acceptable clinical status.” Evidence-
based sepsis aftercare training for the patients’PCPs was pro-
vided in person on an individual basis by the consulting
physicians (Sepsis PCP Manual in Supplement 2). Interven-
tion delivery was considered to have high integrity if the train-
ing was delivered both to patients and to PCPs and the pa-
tient was monitored 5 or more times.
Patients in the control group received care as usual from
their PCPs without additional information or monitoring.
Usual sepsis aftercare included periodic contacts, referrals to
specialists, and prescription of medication and therapeutic
aids at quantities comparable with those for other popula-
tions with multiple chronic conditions.18 In Germany, most
primary care practices are privately operated by 1 or 2 PCPs,
with limited access to specialist care.19 There are no outpa-
tient postsepsis/ICU follow-up clinics or national treatment
guidelines for sepsis aftercare in Germany.
Baseline Data and Outcomes
Baseline data were collected at in-person interviews with pa-
tients while they were still hospitalized. Further clinical data
were obtained from their ICU records. Since the majority of pa-
tients remained hospitalized and incapacitated, baseline data
collection of activities of daily living (ADL), physical func-
tion, and insomnia was not feasible.
The primary outcome was change in mental health–

ICU discharge, as assessed by the Mental Component Sum-
mary (MCS) score of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
(SF-36 [range, 0-100; higher scores indicate lower levels of
impairment20]). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscores and is valid
and reliable in both post-ICU discharge21 and German pri-
mary care populations.22
Secondary outcomes at 6 months were derived from
(1) the other SF-36 scales (range, 0-100; higher scores
indicate lower levels of impairment); (2) overall survival;
(3) mental health outcomes, including the Major Depression
Inventory (range, 0-50; higher scores indicate greater
impairment23), the Posttraumatic Symptom Scale (range, 10-
70; higher scores indicate greater impairment24), and the Tele-
phoneInterviewofCognitiveStatus(range,0-50;higherscores
indicate greater impairment16); (4) functional outcomes in-
cluding ADL (range, 0-11; higher scores indicate lower levels
of impairment25), the Extra Short Musculoskeletal Function
Assessment regarding physical function (XSFMA-F) and dis-
ability (XSMFA-B [range for both, 0-100; higher scores indi-
cate greater impairment26), the Graded Chronic Pain Scale in-
cluding a Disability Score and Pain Intensity (range, 0-100;
higher scores indicate greater impairment27), the Neuropa-
thy Symptom Score (range, 0-10; higher scores indicate greater
impairment28), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool
(range, 0-2; higher scores indicate greater impairment29) in-
cludingbodymassindex,30andtheRegensburgInsomniaScale
(range 0-40; higher scores indicate greater impairment31).
Process-related outcomes included the Patient Assess-
ment of Care for Chronic Conditions (range, 0-10; higher scores
indicatelowerlevelsofimpairment)32,33andmeasuresofmedi-
cation adherence, the modified Morisky questionnaire (range
1-5; higher scores indicate greater impairment,34 and the Short
Form for Medication Use (range, 0-12; higher scores indicate
greaterimpairment.35Inaddition,process-relateddatafromPCP
documentation were derived, including PCP contacts (No.), re-
ferrals to specialists (No.), level of nursing, inability to work
(days), remedies and therapeutic aids (No.), and length of
stay in the hospital and rehabilitation clinic (days). All 31 sec-
ondary outcomes prespecified in the statistical analysis plan
(Supplement 4) are reported in eTables 2-8 in Supplement 3.
In addition, we also included as secondary outcomes all
of the above measured at 12 months after ICU discharge.
Outcome assessment was conducted by nonblinded asses-
sors by telephone.
Initially, the MCS as well as the Physical Component Sum-
mary score of the SF-36 were chosen for primary outcome to
provideamulticomponentscorereflectinghealth-relatedqual-
ity of life (as noted in the study protocol13 and the ISRCTN
registration).However,basedonreviewoftheliterature12high-
lighting the importance of mental health outcomes in post-
ICU care, the primary outcome was specified to the MCS.
Statistical Analysis
The aim of the study was to detect a difference at 6 months of
5pointsormoreinmeanMCSscores,sincethisamountofchange
is thought to be clinically meaningful.22 A common standard
deviation of 10 was assumed on the basis of a typical German
population with acute and chronic diseases.36 At a 2-sided sig-
nificance level of α = .05, a total of 2 × 86 = 172 patients were
required to detect the above-mentioned effect with a power of
90%. Allowing for an additional approximately 40% for drop-
outs and mortality, an initial sample size of 287 was required.
The confirmatory test for the primary outcome was the
Welch t test for independent groups, which was run in the in-
tention-to-treatpopulation.Theconfirmatoryanalysesdidnot
consider intrapractice clustering because 155 (96.9%) of inter-
vention practices and 141 (95.1%) of control practices in-
cluded only 1 patient. The effect clustering and missing val-
ueswereexploredusing,forexample,linearmixedmodelsand
imputations by regression models. Details on methods and re-
sults of exploratory sensitivity analyses are provided in the
eMethods in Supplement 3.
All secondary outcome analyses were exploratory and not
adjustedformultipletests.Theseanalyseswereperformedusing
the t test, Fisher exact test, and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
test, as appropriate. Overall survival was estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, with study groups compared using the
log-rank test. A confirmatory and exploratory 2-sided signifi-
cancelevelofα = .05wasapplied,andeffectsizeestimateswith
95% confidence intervals were reported.
AllstatisticalanalyseswereperformedusingRversion3.2.3

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Atotalof361patientswereeligible,ofwhich291(80.6%)agreed
toparticipate,with148patientsrandomizedtotheintervention
and 143 patients to the control group (Figure). Overall, baseline
characteristics were well balanced (Table). The mean age of the
cohort was 61.6 years (SD, 14.4); 244 patients (84.4%) received
mechanical ventilation, and the median ICU length of stay was
26 days (IQR, 13-46). Mental health–related quality of life was
closetothatofthenormalpopulation(meanMCSscore,49.0[SD,
12.5]), physical health–related quality of life was low (mean SF-
36 [Physical Component Summary] score, 25.3 [SD, 8.8]); 68 of
281 (24.2%) had substantial depressive symptoms, 41 of 281
(14.6%) reported substantial PTSD symptoms, and 54 of 276
(19.6%)indicatedseverepain(Table).Amongtheentirecohort,
164 of 277 (59.2%) reported neuropathic symptoms.
Follow-up
All included 291 patients were cared for by 159 intervention
PCPs and 148 control PCPs. Because of some patient-initiated
PCP changes, the number of PCPs was slightly larger than the
number of patients (eMethods in Supplement 3). Among the
307assignedPCPs,294(95.8%)werewillingtoparticipate.Loss
to follow-up due to withdrawal or nonresponse totaled 66 pa-
tients (22.7%) at 6 months and an additional 18 patients (6.2%)
at 12 months after ICU discharge and was evenly distributed
across study groups (Figure).
Intervention Delivery
Of the 148 patients assigned to the intervention, 130 (87.8%)
received patient training from case managers; 125 (84.5%) of

theirPCPsreceivedtrainingfromaconsultingphysician.There
was a mean gap of 62.38 days (IQR, 36-99) between ICU dis-
charge and PCP training, caused by the wide range of patient
clinical courses. One hundred-four patients (70.3%) in the in-
terventiongroupreceivedtheplannedinterventionathighlev-
els of intervention integrity (eFigure 2 in Supplement 3). In-
complete intervention was usually attributable to death of the
patient (24 [54%] of those with fewer than 5 monitoring calls).
Reduction of motor function (204 [27.1%]) and pain intensity
(201 [27.2%]) were the postsepsis symptoms most rated “red”
(ie, “immediate intervention recommended”) in all 756 struc-
tured monitoring reports (eTable 10 in Supplement 3).
No adverse events related to the intervention were
reported.
Primary Outcome
There was no significant difference between groups in the
primary outcome: The mean change MCS score was 3.79
score points (95% CI, 1.05 to 6.54) for the intervention group
and 1.64 score points (95% CI, 1.22 to 4.51) for the control
group, leading to a mean treatment effect of 2.15 (95% CI,
−1.79 to 6.09); P = .28; baseline mean, 49.1 for intervention
vs 49.3 for control; 6-month mean, 52.9 for intervention vs
51.0 for control (all data related to n = 200 patients [n = 104
intervention, n = 96 control]), with both MCS scores available
at baseline and 6 months; due to rounding, change scores
presented may not add up precisely). These results were
unchanged in several sensitivity analyses (eTable 1 in
Supplement 3).

Secondary Outcomes
A total of 63 secondary outcomes were analyzed at both 6 and
12 months (including the 12-month MCS score).
A respective 28 (6 months) and 30 (12 months) outcomes
did not show significant differences (at an uncorrected α = .05)
between both groups, including physical health–related qual-
ity of life and mental health outcomes (eTable 2 and eTable 3
in Supplement 3). Overall mortality was 13.7% (n = 40) at 6
months after ICU discharge and 18.2% (n = 53) at 12 months af-
ter ICU discharge (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). If any, potential
intervention effects were observed in measures of functional
outcomes only: at 6 months, sepsis survivors receiving the in-
tervention had better physical functioning (mean XSFMA-F
score, 38.0 [95% CI, 32.5 to 43.5] vs 46.9 [95% CI, 40.9 to 52.9];
P = .04; difference, −8.9 [95% CI, −17.02 to −0.78]), less physi-
cal disability (mean XSFMA-B score, 42.5 [95% CI, 36.6 to 48.4]
vs 52.4 [95% CI, 46.2 to 58.7]; P = .03; difference, −9.9 [95% CI,
−18.49 to −1.31]), and fewer ADL impairments (mean, 8.6 [95%
CI, 8.0 to 9.1] vs 7.6 [95% CI, 7.0 to 8.2]; P = .03; difference, 1.0
[95% CI, 0.16 to 1.84]) than usual care. After adjusting for pre-
specified baseline covariates, these potential effects were per-
sistent. In addition, survivors of sepsis receiving the interven-
tionhadpotentiallyfewersleepimpairmentsat12monthsafter
ICU discharge than controls (mean Regensburg Insomnia Scale
score, 10.3 [95% CI, 9.2 to 11.4] vs 12.1 [95% CI, 10.8 to 13.4]; dif-
ference, −1.8 [95% CI, −3.5 to −0.10]).

Discussion
Among survivors of sepsis, a primary care–based interven-
tion,comparedwithusualcare,didnotimprovementalhealth–
related quality of life.
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, random-
ized controlled clinical trial of an intervention to improve out-
comes in survivors of sepsis in primary care.
This sample of survivors of sepsis had similar mean
agesandratesofexistingcomorbiditiesascomparedwithother
cohorts.38,39 The prevalence of depressive and PTSD symp-
toms was slightly less than that among other populations of
survivors of critical illness,40,41 whereas neuropathic symp-
toms and severe pain were more frequent.42,43 Physical func-
tion,asmeasuredbytheSF-36PhysicalFunctionsubscore,was
substantiallylowerthanintheGermanpopulation(mean,85.71
[SD, 22.1]; n = 2886)36 and also lower than in some compa-
rable cohorts44,45 and intervention studies.46,47 Thus, pa-
tients may have been more sensitive to the intervention’
s fo-
cus on increasing motivation to be physically active.
Study patients were exposed to longer durations of me-
chanical ventilation and ICU length of stay than reported in
other studies.4 ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical
ventilation were shown to generally be longer in Europe than
in the United States, especially in survivors of sepsis.48,49 In
addition, extensive ICU length of stay may have facilitated pa-
tient identification by the intensivists.
There was no evidence for a differential treatment effect
on the study’
s primary outcome, postsepsis MCS scores. This
finding is similar to those from previous trials of care man-
agement interventions following critical illness.12,46,47,50 The
absence of an intervention effect on the primary and most
secondary outcomes can be considered using the PICO
(Population, Intervention, Controls, Outcome) frameworks.51
Population
The studied cohort experienced heterogeneous clinical mul-
tiple conditions. This primary care–based intervention may
not have been sufficiently focused to address all their diverse
medical and psychological needs.52 Future trials may evalu-
ate interventions in different patient subgroups targeting
specific postsepsis sequelae. Larger samples should be
included to address smaller but potentially still clinically rel-
evant effects of primary care interventions.
Intervention
The exploratory analyses indicated no intervention effects on
mental health symptoms. These results may reflect lack of
intervention intensity and specificity or absence of clinically
effective interventions. However, there is growing evidence
that after critical illness, mental health outcomes can be
improved through effective psychological interventions tar-
geting specific syndromes.52,53
Controls
According to process data derived from control PCPs (eTable
8 in the Supplement), usual sepsis aftercare in Germany
seems to be highly intensive. PCP training and consultation
may have been insufficient to yield a meaningful improve-
ment in the level of care. Observational research may provide
more insights into existing usual sepsis aftercare in diverse
health care systems.
Outcome
The wide range of postsepsis sequelae may not be adequately
reflected in a rather global outcome measure, such as
change in SF-36 MCS score. Furthermore, the cohort’
s base-
line mental health–related quality of life was similar
to healthy population norms in Germany, reflecting a limited
potential for improvement in the MCS score. Last, the exclu-
sion of patients with more severe cognitive dysfunction
may have led to a ceiling effect compared with other trials.
For future trials, more specific primary outcomes should
be considered.
Up to years after the ICU discharge, many patients seem
to share their needs with a reliable medical professional.54
Yet the PCP is not involved systematically in post-ICU
care.55,56 This study may shed light on PCP relevance,
addressing major concerns recently identified as “barriers to
practice.”57 These include checks on transition from ICU
through to community reintegration, linkage, and clinical
decision support to primary care, inclusion of a case
manager, and educational information for patients and
PCPs. Compared with the large-scale PRACTICAL trial on
follow-up care in ICU clinics,47 this study defines a clear

function for the PCP in sepsis aftercare. Follow-up care com-
bining specialized ICU clinics and integrated PCPs may
improve outcomes.
This study’
s exploratory findings suggest possible im-
provements of physical function and ADL impairments. Ad-
ditional research is needed to confirm these results. Possible
mechanisms of action for these findings may include in-
creased patient motivation (despite the presence of pain) to
partake in physical activity owing to regular case manager tele-
phone calls with goal-setting and basic behavioral activation.
Increased PCP supportiveness in the intervention group may
also have motivated patients to be more proactive, possibly re-
flected by the increased rating in number of Patient Assess-
ment of Care for Chronic Conditions items (eTable 9 in
Supplement 3).
This study has strengths and limitations. It was possible
to enroll a large number of patients in spite of the challenges
of recruiting critically ill patients for research.58 Intervention
integrity went as planned59 (eFigure 2 in Supplement 3), in-
cluding the acceptance of an external medical consultant by
the patient’
s PCP. These findings are encouraging for further
interventions in the primary care setting.
Loss to follow-up was balanced between the groups and
low, in contrast to sample size calculations that allowed for
40% dropout. Baseline values were missing for some second-
ary outcomes owing to patients’severely impaired clinical
condition. A carryover effect (from treatment to control) may
have occurred for 1 PCP, inducing a bias toward a null effect.
Calling control patients to collect follow-up data may have
led to an intervention effect, possibly leading to underesti-
mation of the intervention effects.60 In addition, nonblinded
outcome assessments also may have biased the results.61 The
intervention is not generalizable to all survivors of sepsis in
various outpatient settings.
Conclusions
Among survivors of sepsis or septic shock, the use of a pri-
mary care–focused team-based intervention, compared with
usual care, did not improve mental health–related quality of
life 6 months after ICU discharge. Further research is needed
to determine if modified approaches to primary care manage-
ment may be more effective.
