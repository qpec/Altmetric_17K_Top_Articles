Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF trans-
membrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Advanced CF lung disease is characterized by chronic bacterial 
airway infection, neutrophilic inflammation, adherent mucus, and progressive bronchiectasis. Newborns 
with CF have little or no inflammation. The mechanism by which loss of CFTR-mediated chloride and 
bicarbonate transport leads to chronic airway infection remains uncertain. Recent work using a CF pig 
model shows that the lack of bicarbonate transport results in acidic airway surface liquid (ASL), impaired 
antimicrobial properties, and viscous mucus in newborn CF pigs (1–3). The resulting airway infections 
initiate a cascade of inflammation and airway wall remodeling that progressively destroys the lung and 
shortens lives (4, 5).
Efficient adeno-associated virus–mediated (AAV-mediated) gene therapy can potentially correct this 
defect and prevent lung infections. However, while gene therapy trials in humans have shown that aerosol-
ized AAV2 is safe, it is not efficient (6–8). A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial with 
a nonviral gene therapy vector (pGM169/GL67A) showed the feasibility of monthly delivery of a vector 
to this population and resulted in a small but significant improvement in lung function (9), indicating that 
enhancements in delivery could enable further progress.
AAV gene transfer efficiency can be modulated or improved by using different serotypes (10–15), site-di-
rected modifications of the capsid (16), and directed evolution (17, 18) of viral capsids. We previously 
reported a directed evolution process in primary cultures of human airway epithelia. Our innovative strategy 
used adenovirus to amplify AAV virions that successfully infected airway epithelia. We identified a capsid, 
The physiological components that contribute to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease are steadily being 
elucidated. Gene therapy could potentially correct these defects. CFTR-null pigs provide a relevant 
model to test gene therapy vectors. Using an in vivo selection strategy that amplifies successful 
capsids by replicating their genomes with helper adenovirus coinfection, we selected an adeno-
associated virus (AAV) with tropism for pig airway epithelia. The evolved capsid, termed AAV2H22, 
is based on AAV2 with 5 point mutations that result in a 240-fold increased infection efficiency. 
In contrast to AAV2, AAV2H22 binds specifically to pig airway epithelia and is less reliant on 
heparan sulfate for transduction. We administer AAV2H22-CFTR expressing the CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) cDNA to the airways of CF pigs. The transduced airways expressed 
CFTR on ciliated and nonciliated cells, induced anion transport, and improved the airway surface 
liquid pH and bacterial killing. Most gene therapy studies to date focus solely on Cl– transport as the 
primary metric of phenotypic correction. Here, we describe a gene therapy experiment where we not 
only correct defective anion transport, but also restore bacterial killing in CFTR-null pig airways.

termed AAV2.5T, which efficiently transduced CF human airway epithe-
lia. By combining beneficial properties of AAV5 and AAV2, this chimeric 
virus increased gene delivery efficiency 100-fold relative to AAV2 (17). 
Our objective herein was to investigate whether AAV-mediated CFTR 
gene transfer to the airway epithelia of CF pigs is sufficient to reverse the 
host defense defect in bacterial killing. Since AAV2.5T does not trans-
duce pig airway epithelia (19), we employed an in vitro–in vivo directed 
evolution strategy to select an AAV capsid that is capable of transducing 
pig airway epithelia. Our findings establish that efficient AAV gene trans-
fer of CFTR improves the early CF phenotypes of acidic ASL pH and 
bacterial killing defects in a relevant animal model of this human disease.
Results
Selection of  AAV with tropism for porcine airway epithelia. A pig in vitro–in 
vivo directed evolution-selection strategy was used to identify capsids with increased efficiency and specific-
ity for pig airway epithelium (Figure 1A). First, to enhance the specificity of the library for pig airway, we 
pooled several AAV capsid libraries, including a library of shuffled AAV1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -8, and -9 cap genes 
(20), an error-prone AAV2 library (21), and a library in which loops of the AAV capsid were diversified (22). 
The pooled library was selected in pig airway epithelia cultures for 3 rounds, and in each round, the sequenc-
es of AAV-mutant capsids able to successfully infect pig epithelia were recovered, amplified, and used to 
generate the next pool. After the third round of in vitro selection, the AAV library was mutagenized to 
increase capsid diversity of the library as previously described (17). Next, the library was aerosolized into the 
trachea of a non-CF 6-week-old pig. After 4 days, the pig was euthanized, and epithelial cells were isolated 
from the trachea and bronchi and infected with WT adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) to complete the AAV replica-
tion cycle. Recovered capsids were then cloned and repackaged to create the next library. This process was 
repeated twice for a total of 3 rounds of in vivo selection. Progression of the in vivo selection was monitored 
by evaluating the abundance of recovered AAV genomes by PCR (Figure 1B). Following 3 rounds of in vivo 
selection, AAV DNA from the recovered clones was isolated and sequenced. A single AAV capsid variant 
(AAV2H22) emerged, which was identical to AAV2 except for 5 amino acid changes (E67A, S207G, Q598L, 
I648V
, and V708I). This variant was previously found in a selection for enhanced infectivity of human glia 
in vitro (22). Interestingly, when selection was fully conducted in primary cultures of pig airway epithelia 
and not in vivo — although AAV2H22 was present — we selected primarily AAV6-based capsids (data not 
shown), suggesting that there could be biological differences between in vivo and in vitro approaches.
AAV2H22 transduces pig airway epithelia with higher efficiency than AAV1, AAV2, and AAV6. We next com-
pared the efficacy of recombinant, GFP-encoding AAV2H22 and AAV2 to transduce the apical surface of 
Figure 1. Selection of AAV2H22 with tropism for pig airway epithelia. (A) After 
3 rounds of in vitro selection to enrich for adeno-associated virus (AAV) with tro-
pism for pig airway, an in vivo selection strategy was taken. Plasmids encoding 
an AAV viral capsid library were transfected into 293 cells, along with adenovirus 
helper plasmids. The viral library was aerosolized into the pig trachea, and 3 
days later, the lungs were harvested and airway cells were isolated and infected 
with WT adenovirus (WT Ad). The capsid sequences for the successful AAVs 
were subcloned, and a new enriched viral library was made for each round. (B) 
Enrichment was monitored for in vivo rounds 4, 5, and 6 by assessing the num-
ber of viral genomes per cell after WT Ad amplification. (C) Pig airway epithelia 
were transduced with AAV2H22 that expressed GFP (blue line). Expression was

pig airway epithelia in vitro. AAV2H22-mediated expression of GFP pla-
teaued by 2 weeks, and it was 240 times more efficient than AAV2 (Figure 
1C). Next, we asked if AAV2H22 could transduce distal small airway epi-
thelia (<200-μm diameter) using our recently reported method to isolate, 
expand, and culture small airway epithelia (23). We found that AAV2H22 
efficiently transduced both large and small airway epithelia (Figure 1D). 
We also compared AAV2H22 to AAV1, a serotype previously shown to 
transduce airway epithelia better than AAV2 (24), and AAV6, a predom-
inant serotype selected from our in vitro evolution strategy. AAV1 and 
AAV6 showed minimal transduction of large and small airway epithelia (Figure 1D). These data demon-
strate the superiority of AAV2H22 as compared with existing naturally occurring AAV serotypes and, more-
over, suggest that the AAV2H22 selected in large airways is also functional in small airway epithelia.
We next asked whether AAV2H22 can correct CFTR function in organotypic airway epithelia cul-
tures. AAV2H22-CFTRΔR vector was produced to deliver CFTR minigene of 156 bp partial deletion at 
R-domain (CFTRΔR) cDNA to CF pig airway epithelia. This vector genome contains a CFTR minigene 
(CFTRΔR contains a 156-bp partial deletion at the R-domain; refs. 17, 25) under the direction of a short 
183-bp synthetic enhancer/promoter (F5Tg83) that has been 
shown to express efficiently in CF human airway epithelia and 
restore CFTR channel activity (26). Using this vector genome 
packaged into the AAV2H22 capsid, analysis of short-circuit 
current in Ussing chambers demonstrated that AAV2H22-CF-
TRΔR rescues cAMP-stimulated Cl– current (IsccAMP) in CF pig 
airway epithelia (Figure 1E).
AAV2H22 specifically binds and infects pig airway epithelia. We 
hypothesized that AAV2H22 may have evolved to have higher 
affinity for its receptor in pig airway epithelia than AAV2. To 
investigate this possibility, varying concentrations of AAV2 or 
AAV2H22 virions were allowed to bind to the apical surface of 
isolated pig airway epithelia at 4°C (Figure 2A). The binding 
curves of AAV2H22 differed from those of AAV2 and plateaued 
on airway epithelia. Saturation suggests that AAV2H22 binds 
to a receptor(s) and binding plateaus once all receptor sites are 
occupied. By contrast, AAV2 binding did not saturate (Figure 
Figure 2. AAV2H22 binds specifically to the apical surfaces of pig airway epi-
thelia. (A and B) AAV2H22 or AAV2 virions were allowed to bind the apical sur-
faces of pig airway (A) or alveolar (B) epithelia at the indicated doses for 1 hour 
at 4°C. In airway epithelia, AAV2H22 (blue) plateaued at 6 × 1010 VG, whereas 
AAV2 (green) did not reach saturation. In alveolar epithelia, both AAV2 and 
AAV2H22 saturated, but AAV2 had more apparent binding sites. n = 6–12. (C) 
Consistent with B, AAV2-GFP transduced pig alveolar epithelia more efficiently 
than AAV2H22-GFP. n = 6; *P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney nonparametric t test. (D) 
In contrast to pig, AAV2H22-GFP did not infect human airway epithelia. n =  3 
from different donors in 4 different experiments; *P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney

and HeLa cells. (A) The parental cell line CHO-K1, which expresses HSPG, and mutant cell line pgsD-677, 
which does not express HSPG, were transduced with AAV2-GFP, AAV5-GFP, or AAV2H22-GFP, and the num-
ber of GFP+ cells was determined. Data were quantified as a percentage of GFP+ CHO-K1 cells. n = 6; *P <

2A), suggesting either a highly abundant receptor or a nonspecific interaction 
(27, 28), and the latter is consistent with its lower transduction efficiency. We 
also compared AAV2 and AAV2H22 binding to pig alveolar epithelia (29). In 
contrast to airway epithelia, both AAV2 and AAV2H22 demonstrated saturated 
binding to alveolar epithelia, and binding plateaued at a higher concentration 
for AAV2 (Figure 2B). Consistent with specific binding to alveolar epithelia, 
AAV2-GFP transduced pig alveolar epithelia 26 times better than AAV2H22-
GFP (Figure 2C). Interestingly, comparison of AAV2H22 transduction between 
species showed that AAV2H22-GFP failed to transduce human airway epithe-
lia (Figure 2D). Together, these data show that selectively isolating an AAV 
capsid that successfully transduced the large conducting airway of pigs in vivo 
led to an AAV with stronger tropism for pig airway epithelia compared with 
alveolar epithelia.
AAV2H22 does not require heparan sulfate proteoglycans for transduction of  HeLa 
or CHO cells. Due to the differences in the binding of AAV2 and AAV2H22 in 
pig airway and alveolar epithelia, we hypothesized that AAV2H22 also utilizes 
a different primary attachment receptor from AAV2 in cell lines whose primary 
receptor is heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (27, 28). PgsD-677 cells (30) 
are unable to produce HSPG due to mutations in N-acetylglucosaminyltrans-
ferase and glucuronosyltransferase, enzymes required for the polymerization 
of heparan sulfate chains. We found that AAV2-GFP transduction dropped by 
approximately 83% in pgsD-677 cells compared with parental CHO-K1 cells, 
but AAV2H22-GFP was only partially inhibited (Figure 3A). As a control, 
transduction of AAV5-GFP, which uses sialic acid as a receptor (28), was not inhibited in pgsD-677 cells. 
This result indicates that AAV2H22-GFP transduces pgsD-677 cells via a receptor other than HSPG.
To further investigate the requirement for HSPG, HeLa cells were treated with heparinase I or hep-
arinase III to cleave HSPG at the linkage between hexosamines and O-sulfated iduronic acids or the 1–4 
linkages between glucosamine and glucuronic acid, respectively. Both heparinase I and III inhibited AAV2-
GFP gene transfer by more than 80%, whereas AAV2H22-GFP was inhibited by less than 50% (Figure 3B), 
further suggesting that AAV2H22 may utilize a non-HSPG receptor. By contrast, AAV5 was unaffected.
Finally, we tested whether AAV2H22 transduction could be inhibited by soluble heparin sodium salt 
from porcine intestinal mucosa, which should function as a soluble decoy receptor that competes for bind-
ing to the AAV2 capsid. When we incubated AAV2-GFP, AAV5-GFP, or AAV2H22-GFP with increasing 
concentrations of heparin, the concentration of heparin that reduced transduction to 50% (IC50) of AAV2-
GFP transduction was ~2 μg/ml of heparin, whereas AAV2H22-GFP transduction did not reach an IC50 
until ~9 μg/ml heparin (Figure 3C).
We had previously shown that HSPG are not present on the surface of airway epithelia (14). Moreover, 
treating the surface of airway epithelia with heparinase I or heparinase III had no effect on AAV2H22 
transduction (data not shown), suggesting that the difference seen in HeLa cells is not responsible for the 
increased efficiency on airway epithelia.
Together, these data suggest that AAV2H22 retains some ability to bind and utilize HSPGs for infec-
tion, but also has evolved to bind an additional receptor that is abundant in the pig airway epithelium.

amino acid identity of other serotypes (AAV1, -2, -6, -7, -8, and -9). We modeled the major capsid protein 
of AAV2H22, superimposed on its parent AAV2 (31), and found that the 2 mutations Q598L and V708I 
were predicted to lie on the capsid surface. The Q598L amino acid replacement is located in subloop 4 in 
the surface of the AAV2 capsid, one of the regions implicated in binding to the HSPG receptor (32, 33). 
Shen et al. found subloop 4 to be required for transduction and likely important for the interaction with 
other capsid regions (34). Position 708 is located in a plateau that interacts with the monoclonal antibody

A20 (35). Substitution at 708 prevents binding of AAV2 to A20 without interfering with HSPG binding or 
transduction efficiency (36). Three of the mutations in the evolved AAV2H22 virus were not predicted to 
reside on the surface of the virus (E67A, S207G, and I648V). Importantly, E67A is located in the capsid 
protein VP1, which has been shown to be important for endocytosis, endosomal escape, and trafficking 
through the endocytic pathway to the nucleus (37). Thus, the amino acid changes in the evolved AAV2H22 
may contribute to the increased tropism for pig airway epithelia.
We asked whether surface-exposed mutations in AAV2H22 are necessary or sufficient for transduc-
tion in pig airway epithelia. Individual mutations that occurred in AAV2H22 were introduced into AAV2 
by site-directed mutagenesis (Figure 4A). A Q598L or V708I mutation in AAV2-GFP was sufficient to 
enhance gene transfer to pig airway epithelia (Figure 4B); however, reverting these mutations back to WT 
within the evolved AAV2H22-GFP demonstrated that neither mutation was required for transduction of 
pig airway epithelia (Figure 4C). Interestingly, AAV2-GFP with the V708I substitution and AAV2H22-
GFP with L598 reverted back to Q598 both outperformed AAV2H22 (Figure 4, B and C). It is possible that 
some mutations were selected for functions other than their ability to infect pig airway epithelia (e.g., rep-
lication, packaging in 293 cells, or interaction with adenovirus). Moreover, the V708I mutation may have 
additional advantages in vivo, such as minimizing antibody neutralization as previously described (36). 
Next, we examined whether the non–surface-exposed mutations in AAV2H22 (E67A, S207G, and I648V) 
are required or sufficient to enhance gene transfer to pig airway epithelia using the same site-directed muta-
genesis strategy. We found that E67A enhanced AAV2-mediated gene transfer of GFP but is not required 
(Figure 4, D and E). This residue is close to the PLA2 catalytic domain (37) and, thus, may affect the ability 
of AAV2 to escape the endosome. Analysis of S207G demonstrates that this mutation was not sufficient for 
gene transfer, and more importantly, reverting the mutation back to 207S resulted in enhanced gene transfer 
by AAV2H22 (Figure 4, D and E). Thus, this mutation may have indirect effects that complement other 
mutations, or it may have evolved under a different selective pressure (e.g., replication, packaging in 293 
cells, or interaction with adenovirus). Finally, I648V enhanced gene transfer of AAV2, and the reversion 
mutant impaired gene transfer by AAV2H22. This mutation is in an interloop region of unknown function. 
In summary, these mutations may offer a comprehensive selective advantage in packaging, in vivo infec-
tion, and/or in vivo evasion of immunity. Future work may investigate the receptor used by this virus at the 
apical surface of airway epithelia.
AAV2H22 restores CFTR expression and activity in pig airway in vivo. In a proof-of-concept study, four 1-week-
old CF pigs received 1.96 × 1012 viral genomes (VG) of AAV2H22-CFTRΔR into the lungs via aerosol deliv-
ery and 6 age-matched CF pigs served as a control. Due to low in vitro transduction efficiency in pig airway 
epithelia cells, AAV2 was not examined in pigs in vivo. Two weeks later, the pigs were euthanized, and CFTR 
expression in tracheal airway was assessed. IHC on airway tissue sections revealed CFTR protein expression 
at the apical surface of ciliated cells in non-CF pigs (Figure 5A), and by contrast, no CFTR expression was 
detected in the control CF pig (Figure 5B). Importantly, the CF pigs that received AAV2H22-CFTRΔR exhib-
ited CFTR expression and localization similar to non-CF pigs (Figure 5, C and D).
Additionally, short-circuit current from the excised AAV2H22-CFTRΔR transduced trachea was mea-
sured in Ussing chambers, and we observed cAMP-stimulated Cl– current to be about half the current of 
non-CF pigs of similar age (Figure 5E). We also aerosolized, 1 × 1011 VG of AAV2H22-CFTRΔR in the 
right nostril of 1-week-old CF pigs, with the left nostril receiving vehicle control. Two weeks later, the 
freshly excised nasal septum was studied in Ussing chambers. Whereas the control left turbinate epithelia 
remained CF-like (38), the paired right turbinate epithelia exhibited a pronounced change in short-circuit 
current (Isc) after stimulation with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and forskolin that is consistent 
with reconstituted rescued CFTR expression (Figure 5F).
We have previously reported in newborn CF pigs (in vivo) that loss of CFTR-mediated HCO3
– secretion 
results in decreased ASL pH and impaired bacterial killing (1). We found that, in contrast to untreated CF 
pigs, AAVH22-mediated CFTRΔR expression restored the tracheal ASL pH alkalinity to levels observed in 
non-CF pigs of similar age (Figure 5G). Finally, to investigate the effect of AAV2H22-mediated CFTRΔR 
expression on host defense, we examined bacterial killing using bacteria-coated grids (1). S. aureus chemi-
cally linked to gold grids were placed on the surface of tracheal explants from AAV2H22-CFTRΔR–treated 
pigs or control pigs for 60 seconds. A fluorescent live/dead stain showed that 3-week-old CF pigs have 
impaired bacterial killing, whereas expression of CFTRΔR with AAV2H22 resulted in a partial rescue of 
bacterial killing (Figure 5H). These data demonstrate that CFTR gene therapy with AAV2H22 can restore

ASL pH to WT levels and partially correct the bacterial killing defect in CF pig airway epithelia. The par-
tial correction of bacterial killing could indicate regional differences in ASL pH restoration or additional 
defects in host defense.
Discussion
We developed a combined in vitro–in vivo strategy to select an AAV capsid with enhanced tropism and 
transduction efficiency for pig airway epithelia to test the hypothesis that gene transfer can restore CFTR 
expression and correct the functional defects observed in CF. Our in vivo selection approach involved AAV 
library administration to the live pig airway and rescue of successful infectious variants by subsequent ex 
vivo coinfection with a WT adenovirus. Our selection yielded an AAV capsid that is based on AAV2 with 
5 individual mutations. This viral capsid, termed AAV2H22, efficiently and selectively transduces pig air-
way epithelia. In addition, AAV2H22-delivered CFTRΔR partially corrects transepithelial anion transport, 
ASL pH, and bacterial killing defects in a relevant, large-animal CF model. In short, for the first time to 
our knowledge, we show that AAV-mediated gene transfer to the conducting airway epithelium in vivo can 
complement CFTR activity and enhance host defense in CF.
Evolution and viruses. For successful infection, viruses must both locate bona fide receptors and avoid 
decoys. We previously showed that AAVs need to bind a receptor that is internalized in order to initiate 
airway gene transfer (17, 19). At the same time, they must avoid being bound by abundant low-affinity 
receptors present on the mucus glycocalyx (39). Interestingly, we found that AAV2H22 is less dependent on 
heparan sulfate as a receptor and that higher doses of soluble heparin are required to inhibit its transduc-
tion. This result suggests that heparan sulfate binding in ASL may contribute to the decreased AAV2 gene 
transfer efficiency as compared with AAV2H22. The identity of the receptor or receptors for AAV2H22 
remains unknown. Of note, one of the mutations in the AAV2H22 capsid (L598Q) resides in subloop 4 and 
is reportedly important for AAV2 binding to the laminin-A receptor (40). Both heparan sulfate and lami-
nin-A are expressed primarily on the basolateral surface of airway epithelia, which is normally inaccessible 
for virus binding. Thus, our AAV2H22 avoids being bound to soluble heparan sulfate and sialic acids in 
mucins and is able to reach receptors on the apical surface that efficiently mediate gene transfer. A recent 
publication identified a previously uncharacterized type I transmembrane protein, KIAA0319L as the AAV 
receptor (AAVR) (41). AAVR was shown to be sufficient and required for different AAV serotypes. Howev-
er, we do not know if AAVR is expressed in pig airway epithelia.
Vectors for pig airways are different than for human airways. Translational progression for gene therapy tra-
ditionally begins with assessing a vector and transgene in vitro, is followed by efficacy analysis in a murine 
model of the target disease, progresses to safety studies in nonhuman primates, and finally investigates safe-
ty and efficacy in humans. Not surprisingly, some vectors that are promising in mice subsequently mediate 
low gene transfer efficacy in humans (6, 42, 43). Interestingly, when we selected for viruses that transduce 
human or pig airway epithelia, these viruses were efficient only on cells from the species from which they 
were selected. These results indicate that the selection pressures applied on viruses to transduce human and 
pig cells yield viruses with different receptor tropism, which can prevent transduction in other species. This 
is not surprising, based on the extensive literature for swine influenza viruses and how these viruses rarely 
evolve to infect humans (44).
A more subtle but surprising finding is the difference in binding and transduction efficacy between 
the large, small, and alveolar airway epithelia. Many viruses exhibit analogous regional tropism, but the 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Fortunately, advances in tissue-specific organotypic modeling 
may allow this to be addressed directly in the future. Moreover, these techniques may allow the use of 
targeted evolution in human lungs. It remains unclear which of these epithelia is the correct therapeutic 
target to alleviate CF pathology or, alternatively, whether submucosal glands represent the most physi-
ologically important site for CFTR correction, as submucosal glands from CF pigs and humans secrete 
mucus that is more viscous and acidic — and at lower volumes — than normal (45–47). We recently 
reported that, following methacholine stimulation, mucus in CF pigs is adherent to the opening of the 
submucosal glands and impairs mucociliary transport (48, 49). As a result, aerosolized AAV is unlikely 
to target the submucosal glands, given such complex chemical, biological, and structural barriers. How-
ever, future directed evolution studies will consider isolating regional epithelia and submucosal glands 
to identify whether AAV capsid variants with tropism for these tissues can be engineered and whether 
there is a difference between normal and CF animals. These future studies may offer tools that allow

us to directly address the importance of regional versus broad vector targeting in our preclinical model 
for CF gene therapy.
There are major challenges with developing biological therapies in animal models. First, if a virus is 
efficient in an animal model, it may not be efficient in humans. For example, AAV2 efficiently corrected 
hemophilia B in mice and dogs (50). However, it proved to be less efficient in humans (51). Moreover, 
similar to the pig specificity observed here, previous directed evolution on human airway epithelia yielded 
an AAV capsid that was efficient in human but not mouse or pig airway epithelia (17). Second, a biologic 
that is safe in animal models may not be safe in humans. For example, an immunomodulatory humanized 
agonistic anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody that was developed for multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and certain cancers was deemed to be safe in animal models (52). However, when tested in humans, the 
anti-CD28 antibody reacted with Tregs and produced adverse events (53). These examples illustrate that 
we need to change the vector design and assessment paradigm, where safety and efficacy of animal-specific 
biologics need to be tested in relevant animal models; however, we also need to recognize that the biologics 
may be different than the ones that will work in humans. Translational researchers will need to develop 
creative clinical experiments that minimize risk and allow for testing efficacy and safety in humans.
AAV strengths and limitations. A major strength of AAV is its impressive safety record in humans with 
CF. AAV2 that expresses CFTR has been aerosolized to more than 125 people with CF without any major 
adverse events (6, 7, 42, 54, 55). AAVs form an icosahedral capsid assembled from 60 capsid viral protein 
monomers (VP monomers). The capsid is composed of 3 VPs — VP1, VP2, and VP3 — with a stoichi-
ometry of 1:1:10. AAV contains a single-stranded DNA that, after nuclear uncoating, is converted into a 
transcriptionally competent double-stranded genome that persists episomally and integrates into the host 
genome at low efficiency (56). We now report an efficient AAV capsid with specificity for pig airway epi-
thelia in vitro and after airway administration in vivo, and a key question for future investigation will be the 
duration of subsequent gene expression in the lung following AAV delivery. Persistent CFTR expression 
will be desirable for treating CF lung disease, which starts at birth and progresses throughout the lifetime 
of people with CF. rAAV-mediated gene expression can, in general, be long lasting, and we and others have 
reported that AAV transduction of airway epithelia in vitro achieves transgene expression for months. The 
encouraging transduction efficiency of AAV2H22 and the level of CFTRΔR expression in CF pigs demon-
strated in these proof-of-concept studies motivate investigation of the hypothesis that AAV2H22-CFTRΔR 
could persist for months in the airways and prevent early lung disease. However, it is conceivable that 
repeated administration or permanent modification of airway progenitor cells may be needed for long-term 
CFTR maintenance (57). Lentiviruses stably integrate into the genome; however, they are more difficult to 
produce to high titer than AAV
, have unclear safety profiles in the lungs, and — similar to AAV — could 
benefit from progenitor cell delivery to maintain expression. A companion study by McCray and colleagues 
investigates the application of lentiviral vectors to deliver CFTR to newborn CF pig airways (58). Together, 
these approaches are expected to become part of a toolkit that will provide critically needed long-term 
solutions for people with CF.
Methods
Isolation, expansion, and culture of primary epithelial cells
Generation of gut-corrected CFTR−/− pigs has been previously reported (59). All human lung tissues were 
obtained from the University of Iowa Cell Culture Core Facility. Primary human and pig airway epithe-
lia from non-CF human donor lungs, CF pigs, and non-CF pigs (Exemplar Genetics) were isolated from 
trachea and bronchi of donor lungs as previously described (60). Cells were seeded onto collagen-coated, 
semipermeable membranes (Millipore) and grown at the air-liquid interface as previously described (60, 
61). Isolation, expansion, and culture of pig large proximal (including trachea and bronchi) and small 
distal (diameter ~200 μm) airway epithelia were performed as previously described (23, 29). Briefly, large 
and small airway cells were expanded by culturing in F media in the presence of 10 μM Y-27632, a ROCK 
inhibitor, and irradiated fibroblast feeder cells NIH-3T3-J2. After 2 passages of amplification, expanded 
cells were then seeded onto collagen-coated, semipermeable membranes in the absence of feeder cells and 
ROCK inhibitor and maintained in Small Airway Growth Media (Lonza) supplemented with 10 ng/ml 
keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) for 1 week, after which cells were maintained in USG media. Experi-
ments were performed on matched large and small airway epithelia isolated from the same animal and cul-

tured under identical conditions. Pig alveolar epithelia were isolated and cultured as previously described 
(29, 62, 63). Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC except AAV293 cells (Stratagene California) and cul-
tured as follows: HeLa, CHO-K1, and CHO pgsD-677 were cultured in IMDM (Mediatech), and AAV293 
cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco). All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2.
AAV library production
DNA shuffling and mutagenesis were used as previously described (17, 64–68) to create a viral library from 
the following AAV serotypes: AAV1, AAV2, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8, and AAV9. Additionally, a 
library was constructed from random peptide insertions into AAV2 surface loops, as previously described, 
to provide further diversity to the library (66).
Selection of evolved AAV specific for pig airway epithelia
A pig in vitro–in vivo evolution-selection strategy was used to identify capsids with improved efficiency and 
specificity for airway epithelium (Figure 1A).
In vitro selection in organotypic primary pig airway epithelia. The AAV library was inoculated on the apical 
surface of pig airway epithelial cultures at an MOI of 100 VG/cell diluted in EMEM (Invitrogen) at a total 
volume of 35 μl per epithelium. Three epithelia were used from 3 different non-CF pigs for each round of 
selection. The cultures were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in the presence of virus, followed by removal 
of the virus by aspiration and 2 washes with 250 μl of phosphate buffered saline. Three days after adding 
the AAV library to the cells, 100 pfu/cell of WT Ad5, diluted in EMEM for a final volume of 20 μl, was 
adsorbed to the basolateral surface of the airway epithelia. Forty hours after Ad5 infection, epithelia were 
freeze-thawed 3 times, followed by heat inactivation at 95°C for 10 minutes in a solution of 150 mM NaCl 
and 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Successful variants were cloned into pSub2 as previously described (69), repack-
aged in new libraries, and subjected to further rounds of selection for a total of 3 rounds in pig airway 
epithelial cultures (17).
In vivo selection in pigs. Although we initially attempted selection directly in vivo, no AAV capsids were 
recovered after round 3. Therefore, we took a preenrichment approach. After preselecting the virus library 
for 3 rounds in vitro in cultured pig airway epithelia, we subjected the resulting recovered variants to fur-
ther shuffling and mutagenesis. For each round of selection, 4- to 8-week-old non-CF pigs were sedated 
using ketamine (20 mg/kg, i.m. injection; Akorn, Inc), xylazine (2 mg/kg, i.m. injection; Biomeda-MTC), 
and propofol (2 mg/kg, i.v. injection; Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC), and then approximately 1 × 1011 viral 
genomes were aerosolized into the airways using a LABneb catheter control unit (Trudell Medical Interna-
tional) and an AeroProbe Intracorporeal Nebulizing Catheter, laboratory version (Trudell Medical Inter-
national). Three days after infection, the pig was sedated and then euthanized by intracardiac injection of 
Euthasol (Virbac Corporation). The lungs were removed, and airway epithelial cells were isolated from 
the trachea, carina, and primary bronchi and plated as previously described (60, 61). Four to 5 days after 
plating, WT Ad5 was added at a concentration of ~100 pfu/cell to allow the AAV variants that success-
fully infected the cells to replicate. Cells were harvested 36 hours later, DNA was isolated (Qiagen DNA 
Blood Kit), and PCR was performed to detect AAV DNA. Successful variants were cloned as previously 
described, repackaged in new libraries, and subjected to further rounds of selection (17). A total of 3 rounds 
of in vivo selection were performed.
AAV transduction assays
Self-complementary AAV1 (scAAV1), scAAV2, scAAV6, or scAAV2H22 vectors harboring enhanced GFP 
were diluted in EMEM and added to the apical surface of pig or human airway epithelia (10,000 VG/cell) 
or added to CHO-K1 and CHO pgsD-677 (10,000 VG/cell). Samples were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C, 
followed by 2 washes with PBS. GFP+ cells were visualized with an Olympus IX71 fluorescence micro-
scope (10× magnification, low-power field [LPF]; 20× magnification, high-power field [HPF]), and data 
were calculated as the number of GFP+ cells per field.
Viral binding assays
Virions of AAV2-CMV-eGFP or AAV2H22-CMV-eGFP were allowed to bind to the apical surface of pig 
airway or alveolar epithelia for 1 hour on ice followed by 2 washes with 250 μl of ice cold phosphate buff-
ered saline. Total DNA was extracted, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR Green 
 1 0

R E S E A R C H  A R T I C L E
Extract-N-Amp (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR primers were designed 
for the CMV promoter of the virus (5′-AAATCAACGGGACTTTCCAA-3′ and 5′-GGTTCACTAAAC-
GAGCTC-3′) and compared with known amounts of viral DNA standards to calculate the number of 
bound viral genomes. Electron microscopy of viral preparations established that less than 10% of the cap-
sids were empty, meaning they do not contain DNA.
Heparinase treatment
Heparinase I and heparinase III (H2519 and H8891, respectively; Sigma Aldrich) were diluted in phosphate 
buffered saline (with calcium and magnesium). HeLa cells were treated with heparinase I (0.01 milliIU/
mL) or heparinase III (0.001 milliIU) for 2 hours at 37ºC, followed by removal of the enzyme mixture and 
inoculation with 7.5 × 104 VG/cell of GFP-expressing AAV2, AAV5, or AAV2H22 diluted in EMEM for 
1 hour at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline to remove unbound virions. After 
culture in fresh medium for 24 hours, the number of GFP+ cells was determined by flow cytometry.
Heparin competition
Heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa (H3149-250KU, Sigma Aldrich) was diluted in 
EMEM at concentrations of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 μg/ml, and mixed with GFP-expressing AAV2, AAV5, 
or AAV2H22. The heparin and virus mixtures were incubated at 37ºC for 1 hour, followed by inoculation 
of the HeLa cells with the mixtures at a dose of 7.5 × 104 VG/cell for 1 hour at 37°C. After removal of the 
heparin and virus mixture, cells were cultured for 24 hours, and the number of GFP+ cells were determined 
by flow cytometry.
Three-dimensional modeling of the AAV capsid
Three-dimensional modeling of the AAV2 capsid was performed using PyMol (http://www.pymol.org/) 
and the published AAV2 VP3 X-ray crystallography structure (Protein Databank accession no. 1LP3; 
http://www.rcsb.org/) in order to identify surface-exposed amino acids (31).
Site-directed mutagenesis in AAV2 and evolved AAV2H22
Single nucleotide changes were engineered into AAV2 or AAV2H22 by site-directed mutagenesis using the 
QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) per the manufacturer’s recom-
mendation.
AAV-CFTR expression vector
A 4.88 kb recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) genome, which expresses CFTRΔR under the control of a short 
synthetic enhancer/promoter F5tg83 and synthetic polyadenylation signal vector (26), was packaged into 
the AAV2H22 capsid to produce the AAV2H22-CFTRΔR. The replication-competent AAV (rcAAV) 
library and rAAV vectors were packaged and purified via iodixanol gradient centrifugation as previously 
described. Viral vectors were harvested and titered via qPCR to obtain DNase-resistant genomic titers (16).
Electrophysiological measurements in freshly excised and cultured epithelia
Cultured pig airway epithelia. AAV2H22-CFTRΔR (5,000 VG/cell) was diluted in EMEM and added to the 
apical surface of pig airway epithelia. Two weeks after AAV transduction, cells were mounted in Ussing 
chambers and studied as previously described (70–72).
In vivo experiments. AAV2H22-CFTRΔR (1.96 × 1012 VG in 100 μl) was aerosolized into the lungs of 
1-week-old CF pigs (n = 3), and 1 × 1011 VG was aerosolized into one nare (n = 3). To improve the time 
course of gene expression, virus was administered in the presence of 200 μM doxorubicin (Calbiochem, 
ref. 73). Doxorubicin has been shown to effectively increase viral capsid ubiquitination and transduction of 
recombinant AAV type 2. Two weeks after infection, animals were euthanized and epithelial tissues were 
immediately excised from the trachea and the nasal turbinate/septum of the pigs. Tissues were studied in 
Ussing chambers as previously described (1, 48, 74, 75). Apical and basolateral chambers contained the 
same bathing solution containing (mM): 135 NaCl, 2.4 K2HPO4, 0.6 KH2PO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 
dextrose, 5 HEPES (pH = 7.4) at 37°C, and gassed with compressed air. CFTR-mediated Cl– current was 
measured using a previously described protocol (72). Cellular levels of cAMP were increased with forskolin 
(10μM) and IBMX (100 μM), and the cAMP-stimulated current was measured.

Immunofluorescence of pig airways
Two weeks after viral inoculation, the pigs were sedated with ketamine and xylazine and euthanized 
by intracardiac injection of Euthasol (Virbac). Tissues from the tracheal lobe were fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by 30% sucrose for 24 hours at 4oC. Excess 
sucrose was removed, and the tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) com-
pound (Tissue Tek by Sakura Finetek) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were then sectioned 
using a cryostat into 7-μm sections and mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Cryosectioned tissues were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
in PBS, and blocked in Super-Block (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 5% normal goat serum (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Tissue sections were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in anti-CFTR 
antibody 596 (CF Folding Consortium) and polyclonal antibody to ZO-1 or Cadherin (Invitrogen and 
Zymed, respectively) (all at 1:100 dilution), followed by secondary antibodies (goat anti–mouse Alexa 
Fluor 488 and goat anti–rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 [Molecular Probes; Invitrogen] at 1:1,000 dilution). 
Sections were mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) to visualize nuclei. 
Images were acquired using sequential scanning on an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal micro-
scope with a UPLSAPO ×60 oil lens.
Bacteria-killing assay
The S. aureus grid assay was performed as previously described (1). Briefly, gold grids (TEM grids, 200 
mesh, Ted Pella Inc.) were immersed in 1 mM 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (HS(CH2)10COOH, MUA, 
Sigma Aldrich) solution for 1 hour at room temperature, and then exposed to 1-ethyl-3-(3-diethylaminopro-
pyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (molar ratio 1:1) for 30 minutes to activate the 
carboxyl groups of MUA. Grids were then placed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 μg ml−1 streptavidin (Sigma 
Aldrich) for 30 minutes at 37°C and rinsed with PBS. S. aureus isolate 43SA was cultured to log-phase 
growth and 1 × 108 bacteria were mixed with 0.1 mg ml−1 N-hydroxysulphosuccinimide (sulpho-NHS)-bi-
otin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bacteria was immersed in 1 M glycine to 
quench the reaction and then rinsed with PBS. Streptavidin-coated grids were then incubated with bioti-
nylated bacteria for 30 minutes and rinsed in PBS. Bacteria-coated grids were placed on the airway surface 
in pigs in vivo. After removal from the airway surface, they were immediately (2–3 seconds) rinsed with 
PBS and then immersed in PBS containing the fluorescent indicators SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (Live/
Dead BacLight Bacterial Viability assay, Invitrogen). After 15 minutes, the grids were rinsed with PBS and 
placed on slides for imaging with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000). Images were 
automatically counted using ImageJ plugin ITCN (76).
Measurement of ASL pH
To assess pH in vivo, we used noninvasive dual lifetime referencing to interrogate a 3 × 3 mm planar optode 
(pH sensitive foil, PreSens GmbH) (77) applied directly to the tracheal surface as previously described (1). 
Briefly, a single channel pH meter (pH-1 mini; PreSens GmbH) was used to transmit and receive the exci-
tation and emission light. The tip of the fiber optic pH meter was kept at the same distance from the trache-
al surface in all samples and was confirmed by recording the amplitude registered by the device. Calibration 
before each set of measurements was done by placing the planar optode on the surface of a flat filter soaked 
in standard pH buffers. To minimize alterations in CO2 during placement of the probe, the experiments 
were done in an environment of 5% CO2.
Statistics
Unless otherwise noted, all data were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Error bars represent ±SD. 
Statistical significance was determined by Mann-Whitney nonparametric t test.
Study approval
All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee and were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines and regulations. All human 
lung tissues were obtained from the University of Iowa Cell Culture Core Facility, which acquired 
tissue from donors under an organ research donation protocol that was approved by the IRB of the 
University of Iowa.
