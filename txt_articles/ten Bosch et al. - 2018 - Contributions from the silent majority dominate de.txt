Abstract
Despite estimates that, each year, as many as 300 million dengue virus (DENV) infections
result in either no perceptible symptoms (asymptomatic) or symptoms that are sufficiently
mild to go undetected by surveillance systems (inapparent), it has been assumed that
these infections contribute little to onward transmission. However, recent blood-feeding
experiments with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes showed that people with asymptomatic and
pre-symptomatic DENV infections are capable of infecting mosquitoes. To place those
findings into context, we used models of within-host viral dynamics and human demo-
graphic projections to (1) quantify the net infectiousness of individuals across the spec-
trum of DENV infection severity and (2) estimate the fraction of transmission attributable
to people with different severities of disease. Our results indicate that net infectiousness
of people with asymptomatic infections is 80% (median) that of people with apparent or
inapparent symptomatic infections (95% credible interval (CI): 0–146%). Due to their
numerical prominence in the infectious reservoir, clinically inapparent infections in total
could account for 84% (CI: 82–86%) of DENV transmission. Of infections that ultimately
result in any level of symptoms, we estimate that 24% (95% CI: 0–79%) of onward trans-
mission results from mosquitoes biting individuals during the pre-symptomatic phase of
their infection. Only 1% (95% CI: 0.8–1.1%) of DENV transmission is attributable to

Author summary
Most dengue virus infections result in either no perceptible symptoms or symptoms that
are so mild that they go undetected by surveillance systems. It is unclear how much these
infections contribute to the overall transmission and burden of dengue. At an individual
level, we show that people with asymptomatic infections are approximately 80% as infec-
tious to mosquitoes as their symptomatic counterparts. At a population level, we show
that approximately 88% of infections result from people who display no apparent symp-
toms at the time of transmission. These results suggest that individuals undetected by sur-
veillance systems may be the primary reservoir of dengue virus transmission and that
policy for dengue control and prevention must be revised accordingly.
Introduction
Though often assumed benign, it is increasingly recognized that for many pathogens, clinically
inapparent infections can represent a sizeable portion of the infectious reservoir [1–3] and
contribute substantially to pathogen transmission [4]. Understanding the contribution to
transmission from people with inapparent infections is fundamental for inferring drivers of
transmission [3], estimating the timing and scope of outbreaks [5], planning and monitoring
control efforts [6], and assessing the feasibility of pathogen elimination [1,6].
Of the 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections that occur globally each year, an esti-
mated 300 million do not result in symptoms severe enough for a person to seek treatment
[7,8], meaning that they likely go undetected by most surveillance systems. The four closely
related DENV1-4 serotypes are transmitted predominantly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes [9],
and infection with one serotype is believed to be followed by short-term, heterologous cross-
immunity and life-long homologous immunity [10]. Based on observed positive correlations
between DENV viremia and disease severity [11–14], it has been assumed that the 300 million
annual clinically inapparent infections contribute little to onward transmission because their
viremia levels are too low to efficiently infect mosquitoes. On the other hand, high sero-conver-
sion rates coinciding with few reported cases in some areas suggest that inapparent infections
may contribute appreciably to silent DENV transmission [15]. Furthermore, recent blood-feed-
ing experiments with Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated that people with asymptomatic and
pre-symptomatic DENV infections are indeed capable of infecting mosquitoes [16].
Although these indications of a possible role of inapparent infections in DENV transmis-
sion have become more evident, the proportion of overall transmission for which they are
responsible is unknown. This potentially significant unknown has important implications for
policy given the difficulty of identifying people with inapparent infections, which may be a
critical technical limitation in the event that they contribute appreciably to transmission.

 We addressed this question by estimating the net infectiousness (NI) of DENV-infected indi-
viduals with different clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic infections, and quantify-
ing the relative contributions of these clinically distinct classes to the overall force of infection
(FoI) of DENV. Our approach involved three distinct steps (Fig 1). First, we estimated the net
infectiousness of different classes of DENV infections by combining class-specific estimates of
DENV viremia trajectories and class-specific estimates of the relationship between DENV vire-
mia and infectiousness to mosquitoes. Second, we estimated the proportion of infections of
each class by first quantifying the proportion of primary, secondary, and post-secondary DENV
infections in a population with a given level of transmission intensity. We then translated those
proportions of primary, secondary, and post-secondary infections into proportions of each
infection class based on estimates of those relationships from the literature. Third, we used a
novel formulation of DENV force of infection to combine estimates of individual-level net
infectiousness of each infection class and estimates of the proportion of each infection class in a
hypothetical population to estimate the proportional contribution of each infection class to
overall DENV force of infection.
Results
Definitions
We distinguished four classes of infections (Fig 2). We referred to the first class as “asymptom-
atic” (As), which we defined as people having absolutely no perceptible symptoms at any point
Fig 1. Flowchart of methodological framework. Our overall approach consisted of three steps, depicted in the three
columns. The products of all three combine to yield our estimate of the relative contribution to overall force of
infection from each infection class. Likewise, uncertainty in each component of the analysis is propagated into other
components of the analysis through repeated Monte Carlo sampling, with Monte Carlo samples from one portion of
the analysis flowing to others according to the arrows and providing the basis for credible intervals reported in the
Results section. Details of how the sub-steps indicated in this figure were performed are described in subsections of the
Materials and Methods section.

 during their infection [16]. The remaining people with symptomatic (S) infections were
divided into: (1) inapparent symptomatic (IS), people whose symptoms are sufficiently mild to
not disrupt their daily routine and thus do not prompt healthcare seeking [7,16]; and (2)
apparent symptomatic (AS) individuals, whose clinical presentation does disrupt their daily
routine according to the WHO definition of “at least fever and two dengue symptoms” [17].
Detected apparent symptomatic individuals (DAS) are identified by health surveillance sys-
tems if they seek clinical consultation and are diagnosed as a confirmed dengue case. Others
remain undetected (UAS) (Fig 2).
Net infectiousness (NI)
We quantified differences in the net infectiousness to mosquitoes of individuals with As, IS,
and AS infections. We modeled viral transmission dynamics of each of these infection types
by using a mechanistic model of the within-host dynamics of DENV fitted to plasma viral
titers over time for patients with S infections [18] and adjusted these trajectories using an
empirically informed distribution of correction ratios to model trajectories of As infections
[16]. Secondary (2˚) infections were parameterized to exhibit faster cell entry and acceler-
ated clearance of viral particles than primary (1˚) infections, consistent with theory for anti-
body-dependent enhancement and increased activation of the immune system [18]. This
resulted in a shorter duration of detectable, and potentially infectious, viremia [19–21].
Post-2˚ infections were excluded from consideration for our primary analysis due to a com-
bination of low risk of apparent disease and high rates of cross-reactive antibodies for this
group [22]. Nonetheless, because there is no conclusive evidence about viremia of post-2˚
infections [22], we performed a sensitivity analysis in which an upper limit for post-2˚ vire-
mia was assumed similar to that of 2˚ infections given that the dynamics of both are limited
by varying degrees of immunity (S1 Fig). Next, we applied logistic regression models [16] to
infer infectiousness to mosquitoes from human viral titers (S1 and S4 Tables, S2 Text) (see
Materials and Methods for details).
The median NI to Ae. aegypti of As infections was lower than that of S infections, but of simi-
lar magnitude (1˚: 87%, 95% CI: 0–151%; 2˚: 74%, 95% CI: 0–137%). The median NI of 1˚
infections was greater than that of corresponding 2˚ infections (As: 140%, 95% CI: 111–275%;

 S: 120%, 95% CI: 100–235%) (Fig 3). Approximately one quarter of the NI of S infections
occurred before symptom onset (1˚: 21%, 95% CI: 1–56%, 2˚: 27%, 95% CI: 0–97%). By calculat-
ing the probability that a random draw from the NI distribution of one infection class was
lower than a random draw from another class (Pr), we confirmed that As infections are more
likely to be less infectious than S infections (1˚: Pr = 0.55; 2˚: Pr = 0.58) and 2˚ infections are
more likely to be less infectious than 1˚ infections (As: Pr = 0.56; S: Pr = 0.62) (S2 Table). There
was wide variability in the NI of As infections, however, with both two-fold lesser or greater
infectiousness compared to S infections appearing probable (lesser, 1˚: 0.38, 2˚: 0.42; greater,
1˚: 0.16, 2˚: 0.20). Overall, 1˚ As infections were not significantly less infectious than 2˚ S infec-
tions (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.97).

 Relative contributions to force of infection (FoI)
Next, we estimated the proportion of each infection class in a hypothetical population and
derived each class’ relative contribution to FoI, the rate at which susceptible people become
infected. We assumed an equal probability of being bitten by Ae. aegypti across infection clas-
ses. To quantify the proportion of people with As, IS, UAS, and DAS infections (and thus the
pool of individuals who could potentially give rise to new infections among susceptibles), we
used estimates from a recent meta-analysis on published (As+IS):AS ratios for primary and
secondary infections (1˚: 82%, 95% CI: 81–84; 2˚: 76%, 95% CI: 74–78) [23]. Post-2˚ infections
were assessed separately, using studies compiled by [7]. A beta-binomial model of these pro-
portions was supported over a binomial model (deviance information criterion (DIC) bino-
mial: 163, beta-binomial: 34). We estimated the (As+IS):AS ratio among post-2˚ infections to
be higher than that of 1˚ and 2˚ infections (86%, 95% CI: 63–97). For all pre-exposure histories
we adopted an As:(IS+AS) ratio of 9.2% (95% CI: 4.4–14.0%), which reflects the proportion of
asymptomatic infections detected among cluster participants in [16] and a detection rate of AS
infections of 8% (95% CI: 5–15%) [24] (see sensitivity analysis for an assessment of the full
range of As:IS:AS ratios).
The proportion of individuals with a given pre-exposure history (e.g., no previous DENV
exposure, prior exposure to one serotype), or with temporary heterotypic immunity or perma-
nent homotypic immunity, depends on the age distribution and the history of local transmis-
sion intensity [25]. We considered scenarios for our hypothetical populations with
demographic characteristics of Brazil and Thailand, respectively, and simulated pre-exposure
history by age across values of time-averaged FoI [26] (Figs 4 and S2). Combining the afore-
mentioned inapparent ratios with realistic demographic scenarios in a location with a given
overall, time-averaged FoI, we derived formulas

for the FoI attributable to As infections that can be divided by the overall FoI as FoIAs / FoIAs+IS+UAS
+DAS to quantify the proportional contribution to FoI from the As class. The same approach can be
applied to derive the proportional contribution to FoI of any other infection class. The parameters in
Eq (1) are defined in S1 Table and account for different aspects of local dengue epidemiology and the
aforementioned descriptions of differential net infectiousness and prevalence of As, IS, and AS infec-
tions with distinct pre-exposure histories (see Materials and Methods for additional details).
Based on our metric of relative FoI, we estimated that 88% (95% CI: 77–92%) of human
DENV infections are attributable to individuals that do not present with apparent symp-
toms at the time when they are bitten by a susceptible mosquito (i.e., As, IS, and pre-symp-
tomatic AS) (Figs 5 and S3 for Thailand). We estimated that As and IS infections could
together be responsible for causing 84% (95% CI: 82–86%) of all human DENV infections,
reflecting a near one-to-one relationship with their representation in the population. Of the
remaining 16% (95% CI: 14–18%) of infections, 76% (95% CI: 21–100%) are attributable to
bites by mosquitoes on people whose infection eventually becomes apparent, and thus

 potentially detectable, after onset of symptoms. At a detection rate of 8% [24], an estimated
1.3% (95% CI: 1.1–1.4%) of total infections result from infected individuals after they are
detected by surveillance systems (0.8%, 95% CI: 0.7–0.9%; 2.5%, 95% CI: 2.1–2.7% at detec-
tion rates of 5% and 15% [24], respectively).
Sensitivity analysis
Data on viremia and infectiousness in asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and post-2˚ infections
are sparse [16], resulting in substantial uncertainty around our estimates. We performed a var-
iance-based sensitivity analysis [27] to identify the primary sources of uncertainty for estimat-
ing net infectiousness and the proportion of net infectiousness occurring prior to symptom
onset. Limited data on the viremia-to-infectiousness relationship of asymptomatic infections
drove the majority of uncertainty in estimates of their net infectiousness, whereas uncertainty
in time until symptom onset was responsible for the majority of uncertainty in estimates of the
proportion of net infectiousness prior to symptom onset (S4 Fig).
The estimated contributions to FoI by each infection class were robust across different trans-
mission settings (Fig 5) and in settings where DENV is newly emerging (S5 Fig), but not when
allowing for contributions to transmission from post-2˚ infections (S1 Fig). Under the assump-
tion that the net infectiousness of post-2˚ infections is equivalent to that of 2˚ infections, we esti-
mated the contribution of inapparent infections to be up to 11% (95% CI: 10–13%) higher than
if post-2˚ infections had not been assumed to contribute to transmission (S1 Fig). This increase
resulted from the relatively high proportion of IS infections among post-2˚ infections, who

susceptibility to infection and clinical outcome depend on pre-exposure history. Serohistory by age (A and C) is estimated using a system of ordinary differential
equations with state variables denoting the proportion of the population pre-exposed to 0–4 serotypes. Transition to pre-exposure state i occurs at rate iFoI. Individuals
entering a new pre-exposure state have temporary heterologous immunity (gray) to all serotypes before later becoming susceptible again to each serotype to which they
do not have a history of exposure. After four infections with four different serotypes, individuals are assumed fully immune (black) to all serotypes.

 made up a larger proportion of the infectious reservoir in more intense transmission settings.
Under the assumption that IS infections are more similar in their infectiousness to As than to
AS infections, the estimated contribution of inapparent infections was reduced from 84% to
73% (95% CI: 0–91%), reflecting a lower bound on this assumption. The impact of accounting
for the differential viral trajectories of severe dengue cases [18] was minor due to their small
numerical prominence [28], but their inclusion did increase the contribution of post-symptom-
atic DAS infections from 1.0% (95% CI: 0.8–1.1%) to 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8–3.6).
As:IS:UAS:DAS ratios can fluctuate in space and time; for instance, as a result of serotype
differences in virulence [7,23]. The contribution of inapparent (As+IS) infections across the
spectrum of As:IS:AS ratios is driven by the ratio of As to IS infections, with the total contribu-
tion of As+IS infections generally being similar to their numerical prominence in the infected
population (Fig 6). Although variability in As:IS:AS ratios likely does drive some variability in
the contribution of As+IS infections, our analysis suggests that their contribution is unlikely to
be less than 81% of their numerical prominence (Fig 6).
Discussion
Combined with recent empirical findings [16,18], our modeling analysis suggests that inappar-
ent infections contribute appreciably to DENV transmission and its disease burden via infection
of others who develop clinical symptoms. In large part, our results stem from the large numerical
prominence of As and IS DENV infections and the finding that differences in the viremia pro-
files of As and S infections are insufficient to result in considerable differences in net infectious-
ness. Moreover, our finding that approximately one quarter of an individual’s infectiousness
occurs prior to symptom onset supports the hypothesis that a large proportion of human-to-
mosquito transmission is silent; i.e., it happens when there is no detectable illness [15,16].
Fig 5. Mean contribution of each infection class to total force of infection (FoI). The contribution to the total FoI of
an infection class is derived from the ratio of FoI attributable to a given class and total FoI, as in Eq (1). The respective
net infectiousness is derived from the 3,000 random samples displayed in Fig 3. The infections are further distributed
according to the estimated proportion of net infectiousness to occur before and after symptom onset (pre-
symptomatic (Eq (5)) and post-symptomatic (hatched lines) (Eq (6)). The histogram shows the distribution of FoI
contributions by asymptomatic infections at FoI = 0.1, accounting for parameter uncertainty.

 The substantial role that inapparent infections play during dengue epidemics may result in
more rapid transmission and geographic spread [3] and, as a result, more widespread trans-
mission prior to case-driven outbreak detection and onset of control efforts [29]. The consid-
erable potential for pre-symptomatic transmission further impedes the use of case data to
predict whether an outbreak will occur and, if it does, what its final size will be [30]. Despite
increasing recognition of the importance of silent transmission to the epidemiology of a vari-
ety of pathogens, it is rarely taken into account in dengue models [31–34].
Our results also highlight the potential significance of a key uncertainty in projections of
the population-level impact of the recently licensed Dengvaxia vaccine, which is thought to
protect some vaccine recipients against apparent disease but not infection [35]. Although
spared from disease, our results imply that breakthrough infections in these individuals could
appreciably contribute to transmission and, therefore, limit the indirect effects of vaccination
[31,36]. If individuals with asymptomatic or inapparent infections are as infectious as their
apparent symptomatic counterparts, positive indirect effects of vaccine implementation in
highly endemic settings would be reduced [31,32]. Conversely, adverse effects of vaccination
in low-transmission settings, due to higher rates of severe disease in DENV-naïve vaccine
recipients [37], would be offset to some degree if inapparent infections are important contribu-
tors to transmission given that this would increase the projected indirect effects of vaccination
in those settings [31,32].
The contribution of silent infections to transmission helps explain the difficulty of carrying
out control efforts in response to reported cases, particularly in intense transmission settings

infectiousness.

 [29]. That approach could be further impeded by substantial inter-individual variability in
pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectiousness [29]. If some people with silent infections
are substantially more infectious than those with apparent infections, a significant portion of
DENV transmission clusters would not be detected or contained by traditional surveillance
efforts. Additional data are required to determine to what extent the observed variability in
infectiousness results from uncertainty in the data or variability among individuals [33,38].
Improving strategies with enhanced potential to prevent infections, silent or otherwise,
requires a deeper understanding of the spatial and temporal scales of transmission [39].
Our results underscore the need to resolve substantial uncertainties about within-host
DENV dynamics, in particular with respect to viremia and infectiousness of asymptomatic,
pre-symptomatic, and post-2˚ infections. An improved understanding of differences in vire-
mia profiles between 1˚ and 2˚ infections, and the mechanisms underlying those processes
requires more detailed immunological and viremia titer data, including quantifications of
infectious particles, particularly from earlier stages of the infection [38,40]. Similarly, a greater
understanding of the factors underlying differences in viral trajectories [38,41,42], infectious-
ness [41–43], and disease rates [23] between serotypes is needed to gain better, more context-
specific estimates of the contributions of silent transmission to DENV transmission. Further,
uncertainty about the net infectiousness of post-2˚ infections limits understanding of dengue
dynamics overall [44] and the contribution of silent transmission in particular. Acquiring this
kind of empirical data is complicated by the difficulty of identifying people in these classes
when they are viremic and the absence of diagnostic tools that reliably distinguish 2˚ from
post-2˚ infections [45]. Moreover, people with symptomatic infections may experience
impaired mobility [46] or otherwise modified interactions with mosquitoes, the impacts of
which on net transmission are presently not well understood. Resolving these uncertainties
and identifying effective strategies for mitigating the contributions of all infections, apparent
or not, to DENV transmission will require comprehensive studies that combine field work and
modeling to address the coupled nature of multiple transmission heterogeneities [33] (see S1
Text for a comprehensive discussion of additional limitations and research needs).
Conclusion
Heterogeneous infectiousness coupled with heterogeneity in disease symptoms is common
across a wide range of pathogens [47]. A more thorough, quantitative understanding of the
factors underlying these heterogeneities and their role in pathogen transmission is critical for a
more complete understanding of pathogen dynamics and, in turn, enhanced disease preven-
tion [48]. Our results advance understanding of these heterogeneities for dengue, showing that
they are significant at both individual and population levels. In particular, our findings suggest
that failing to acknowledge these coupled heterogeneities may significantly handicap under-
standing of DENV transmission dynamics, the effectiveness of dengue outbreak response
efforts, and the evaluation of novel interventions for dengue prevention and control. These
results show that additional emphasis on model-based approaches that bridge individual-level
infection and population-level transmission processes have the potential to provide valuable
insights for infectious disease prevention and control and for the identification of high-priority
needs for future data collection.
Materials and methods
Class-specific viremia dynamics
We modeled viremia trajectories (log10 cDNA copies/mL of plasma) using a model [18] of
virus and immune dynamics with four state variables—uninfected target cells (x), infected

dx

dt ¼ bxv � dy � azy

dt ¼ oy � kv
dz
dt ¼ Zyz:
ð2Þ
The parameter A denotes the daily production rate of target cells, which die at rate γ and
become infected proportional to the concentration of free viral particles at rate β, assuming
random mixing. Infected cells die at rate δ and are cleared of infection at a rate proportional to
the size of the immune response and the removal rate α. Free viral particles are produced by
infected cells at rate ω and are cleared at rate κ. The immune response grows proportional to
the number of infected cells at rate η. This model was fitted to individual plasma viral titers
from primary (1˚) and secondary (2˚) apparent symptomatic (AS) DENV-1 infections [21]
using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods [18]. We used n = 3,000 random samples from the
joint posteriors from that analysis to model viremia trajectories for 1˚ and 2˚ AS infections.
Inapparent symptomatic (IS) infections are assumed to have similar viremia as AS infections.
To adapt this approach to model viremia trajectories of As infections, we relied on the observa-
tion by Duong et al. [16] that log10 viral titers of As infections were lower on average than
those of S infections (76%, CI: 63–88%). To account for uncertainty in this relationship, we
took the ratio of 3,000 random samples from the normal distributions of symptomatic (mean:
6.27 +/- SE 0.14 log10 cDNA copies/mL) and asymptomatic observed viremia (mean: 4.75 +/-
SE 0.39 log10 cDNA copies/mL) and reduced each viremia trajectories of AS infections by a
random draw from the distribution of fractions to approximate the trajectories of As infec-
tions. In doing so, we assumed the duration of viremia to be similar in As and S infections on
the basis of limited data from the study performed by Duong et al. [16], which revealed no
detectable differences in the duration of viremia between A and S infections.
Class-specific viremia-infectiousness relationships
To describe the probability of infecting a mosquito given an individual’s viremia (V), we used
logistic regression models

ð3Þ
where β0 and β1 denote the logistic intercept and the slope coefficient for plasma viremia (log10
cDNA copies per mL), respectively [49] (see S2 Text for fits to alternative functional forms).
We fitted this relationship to data from DENV-infected symptomatic and asymptomatic indi-
viduals (S4 Table) and found these relationships to be significantly different across infection
classes (i.e., asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and post-symptomatic) but not with respect to
serotype or pre-exposure history (i.e., primary vs. post-primary infection) [16] (See S2 Text for
a formal comparison with other studies on DENV infectiousness [41,42]). Pre-symptomatic
individuals become symptomatic after their intrinsic incubation period (IIP) is over, at which
time they become subject to a significantly different relationship between viremia and infec-
tiousness (S1 Table). Each of 3,000 samples of symptomatic viremia trajectories had a corre-
sponding duration of the IIP as informed by the posterior distributions derived in [18]. These

 were paired within a given realization of the regression model with coefficients randomly
drawn from the multivariate normal distribution of best fit parameters (S1 Table), so as to
explicitly account for uncertainty in these estimates resulting from limited sample sizes in this
study, in particular for As infections [16]. The pre-symptomatic parameterization was used
before the IIP concludes, and the post-symptomatic parameterization was used afterwards.
For the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, the viremia-infectiousness relationship
remained the same over the course of the infection, because the concepts of IIP and onset of
symptoms do not apply to asymptomatic infections. To summarize the extent of infectiousness
of an individual over the entire course of their infection, we defined net infectiousness as the
integral of an infectiousness curve over time
NI ¼
Z
FðVðtÞÞdt:
ð4Þ
This quantity NI is proportional to the expected number of mosquitoes infected by a human
infection assuming that biting occurs at a constant rate over the course of the human infection.
By extension, the ratio of the net infectiousness of two individuals with two different types of
infections is identical to the ratio of the expected number of mosquitoes infected by people with
those respective types of infections. Given that we interpret the end of the intrinsic incubation
period (IIP) as the beginning of the symptomatic phase of the infection, we also used this distinc-
tion to estimate the proportion of infectiousness that occurs prior to symptom onset (NIPreS)

Proportion of 1˚, 2˚, and post-2˚ infections as a function of transmission
intensity
We calculated the proportion of the population previously exposed to 0 to 4 serotypes as a
function of the population’s age distribution and the time-averaged, serotype-specific FoI to
which the population is subject. The time-averaged FoI metric (defined below) that we used
was assumed to be constant with respect to virus serotype and space. Although DENV FoI is
known to exhibit substantial variation with respect to these factors [26,50], we simplified this
aspect of our analysis to reflect the average across a wide geographic area or across many reali-
zations of a complex temporal pattern of transmission.
Consistent with these assumptions and with the further assumption of FoI acting as a con-
stant hazard, we represented the proportion pre-exposed to i = 0. . .4 serotypes at age a as ei(a).
After acquiring infection at rate (4-i)FoI, an individual has temporary heterologous immunity
to all serotypes for a period of average duration σ-1. The probability that an individual of age a
has temporary heterologous immunity after exposure with i serotypes is represented by ri (a).
Individuals permanently retain immunity to serotypes to which they were previously exposed;

Proportion of infections of each class among 1˚, 2˚, and post-2˚ infections
As+IS:AS ratios for primary and secondary infections were derived from a recent meta-analysis
using cohort studies with laboratory-confirmed infections [23]. In brief, a literature search was
performed for dengue cohort studies that 1) reported the number of (As+IS) and AS infections
and 2) provided lab confirmation of apparent infections [22,52–59] (S3 Table). For a specific
time and place j, observed infections with pre-exposure to i serotypes (Oi) were assumed to
result from a binomial distribution Oi;jðAs þ ISÞ � BinomialðNi; ziljÞ; where Ni is the number
of subjects pre-exposed to i serotypes, zthe (As+IS):AS ratio, and λ the location- and time-spe-
cific force of infection. Similarly, the observed AS infections were assumed to result from
Oi;jðASÞ � BinomialðNi; ð1 � ziÞljÞ:The models were fit to the data in a Bayesian framework
with the R package RStan [60]. We assessed observations on post-2˚ infections [22,28], as col-
lated by [7] in a similar fashion and assumed the number of As+IS infections to have arisen
from a binomial distribution O�2ðAs þ ISÞ � BinomialðOAþIS þ OAS; x�2Þ: To account for
intrinsic variability in the rates, similar models assuming a beta-binomial distribution were
assessed and compared to the binomial model using DIC [61]. Given the scarcity of data and
the fact that these estimates comprise only a portion of our analysis, we did not estimate λi as
was done in [23]. Had we done so, we would expect our estimates of that quantity to be similar.
To calculate the proportions of infected people who have previously been exposed to zero
or one serotype and who experience either an asymptomatic (A) or symptomatic (S) infection,
we used Ei and our estimates of As:S ratios for a given pre-exposure history (yi= 9.2% for 1˚
and 2˚ infections, other options are assessed in Fig 6), resulting in

Theoretical formula for contribution of each infection class to force of
infection
Classical epidemiological theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission posits that FoI—i.e.,
the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected—is a function of a number of factors,
including infection prevalence among hosts (X) and the infectiousness of infected hosts [62]. On
a per capita basis, FoI = bmaY in Ross-Macdonald models, where b is the probability that a sus-
ceptible host becomes infected after being bitten by an infectious vector, m is the ratio of vectors
to hosts, a is the daily rate of at which a vector bites, and Y is the infection prevalence among vec-
tors. The latter depends further on the daily vector mortality rate g, the incubation period n in
the vector, human infection prevalence X, and the probability c that a susceptible mosquito
becomes infected upon biting an infectious host [62].
To account for the population stratification that is necessary for our analysis, we derived a
formula for the FoI that is more generalizable than the classic formula in that it allows for dis-
tinct contributions to FoI from different host groups (i.e., As, IS, UAS, and DAS infections
with different pre-exposure histories). Specifically, each host group differed in its infectious-
ness and its overall prevalence in the population. By separating contributions from different
host groups to mosquito infectiousness and, in turn, to the FoI on susceptible hosts, we calcu-
lated the proportional contribution of people with As infections to FoI by calculating the ratio
between the FoI resulting from As infections alone and the total FoI, and similarly for IS, UAS,
and DAS infections.
Differentiating between S and As infections, we can describe FoI as
FoIAs ¼ bma

FoISþAs ¼ bma

where ρ is the prevalence of S infections relative to As. The contribution of As infections fol-

which demonstrates the robustness of our results to different values of n, b, and m.
Under a Ross-Macdonald formulation, the time-invariant infection probability c relates to
net infectiousness (NI) according to NI ¼ c=i, where i� 1 represents the average duration of
the period of infectiousness. The prevalence Xi is proportional to the proportion of the popula-
tion that has temporary heterologous immunity, Ri, according to Xi ¼ Ris=i:The quantity Ri is

cXi ¼ NIsRi:
ð13Þ
Substituting Eq (13) into Eq (11) to further stratify infection classes and pre-exposure histo-
ries gives Eq (1) from the Results section, with p = 2 when assessing the impact of 1˚ and 2˚
infections on transmission and p = 4 when assessing the impact of 1˚, 2˚, and post-2˚ infec-
tions on transmission. To account for uncertainty in this metric, the relative FoI was calculated
for n = 3,000 random samples from the distributions of NI for each infection class.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of uncertainty in As:IS:AS ratios among
1˚ and 2˚ infections on the relative contributions to the overall FoI (Fig 6). Additionally, we exam-
ined what the contribution of inapparent infections to the FoI would be under the assumption
that post-2˚ infections are similarly infectious as 2˚ infections and using estimates from the meta-
analysis presented in S3 Table to estimate the proportion of post-2˚ infections to be apparent.
This and the assumption we effectively made in our primary analysis—i.e., that post-2˚ infections
make no contribution to transmission—represent two different extremes and therefore provide
bounds on the potential sensitivity of our results to alternative assumptions about the contribu-
tions to transmission from post-2˚ infections. Similarly, we addressed uncertainty around the net
infectiousness of IS infections by first assuming their net infectiousness to be similar to As infec-
tions rather than AS infections, as in the core analysis. We then examined the impact of severe AS
infections by adopting fitted dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) viremia trajectories [18], DHF
rates among S infections of 0.8% and 3% for primary and post-primary infections, respectively
[28], and the assumption that all DHF cases are detected. The latter assumption provides an
upper bound for the potential contribution of DAS infections for a given detection rate.
Variance-based sensitivity analysis
To assess the impact of the three main sources of uncertainty in deriving two outcome vari-
ables (Q), the net infectiousness and the proportion of infectiousness prior to symptoms, we
performed a variance-based sensitivity analysis [27]. The variance for both variables was mea-
sured under four different scenarios: 1) with all sources of uncertainty and 2–4) with all
sources of uncertainty except one. The contribution to the total variance is expressed by the
total-effect index

Here, X denotes a vector of uncertain model inputs and ~i denotes that uncertainty around all
inputs was included with the exclusion of i. For input i, we used the mean of the uncertainty
distribution for the quantity of interest. The three main sources of uncertainty are quantities
describing temporal patterns of viremia, the relationship between viremia and infectiousness,
and the duration of the intrinsic incubation period (IIP).
